[[Image:Triunphus Caesaris plate 1 - Andreani.jpg|thumb|''Triumphus Caesari'', by Andreani, after a painting by Mantegna]]

'''Andrea Andreani''' (1540–1623) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[engraver]] on wood, who was among the first printmakers in Italy to use [[chiaroscuro]], which required multiple colours.
 
Born and generally active in [[Mantua]] about 1540 (Brulliot says 1560) and died at [[Rome]] in 1623. His engravings are scarce and valuable, and are chiefly copies of [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Parmigianino]] and [[Titian]]. The most remarkable of his works are ''Mercury and Ignorance'', the ''Deluge'', ''Pharaoh's Host Drowned in the Red Sea'' (after Titian), the ''[[Triumphs of Caesar (Mantegna)|Triumph of Caesar]]'' (after Mantegna), and ''Christ retiring from the judgment-seat of Pilate'' after a relief by Giambologna. He was active 1584–1610 in Florence.<ref>ULAN</ref>
