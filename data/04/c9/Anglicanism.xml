On the contrary, with regard to the Irish branch, this view receives fresh support from our statements. Neither from what tradition tells us about the doctrines and institutions of the Celtic Church, nor from what we know or may fairly conjecture about her history, do we receive any support for the hypothesis that the Celtic Church during her golden age greatly resembled the Church of the apostolic era in institutions and dogma. Just as Britain was a part of the Roman Empire, so the British Church formed (during the fourth century) a branch of the Catholic Church of the West; and during the whole of that century, from the council of Arles (316) onward, took part in all proceedings concerning the Church. But the Irish branch of the Celtic Church was an offshoot of that British Church, and had sprung up as early as the fourth century. At the beginning of the seventh century the institutions of the Celtic Church on either side of the Irish Sea showed divergences from the Church of Rome which are well attested. These, on a closer view, admit of full explanation. Above all, we must not forget the fact that in the Roman Catholic Church the position of the Roman bishop during the fourth century and up to the time of Leo the Great (440-461) differed from that of Pope Gregory the Great (509-604) at the end of the sixth century. At the beginning of the seventh century rigid uniformity of institutions was regarded as an essential requirement of the ''unitas catholica ;'' but to the fourth century this idea was wholly foreign. Besides, many innovations took long to domesticate themselves with the distant branches of the Church.

Only the Britons were accused of practising a heterodox baptism; traces of an archaic liturgy in Wales find no counterpart in the eclectic, but largely Gallican, worship attested from Ireland; and the superiority of abbots to bishops appears to have been limited to some parts of Gaelic sphere of influence.&quot;</extension><extension extension_name='ref' group="note">In the<space/><italics><link type='external' href='https://books.google.com/books?id=pGLstPf5iJMC&amp;amp;pg=PA9&amp;amp;dq=Towards+the+end+of+the+sixth+century+a+great+spiritual+leader,+Gregory,+became+Pope.+He+inherited+a+Church+which+was+very+weak+and+disorganized.+Consequently+he+set+about+sending+key+people+throughout+the+continent+to+organize+this+Church,+and+bring+some+sense+of+cohesion.+To+these+islands+he+sent+St+Augustine...to+bring+the+wayward+Celtic+churches+into+line.+Then,+as+now,+the+life+of+those+in+the+British+Isles+tended+to+be+rather+separate+from+the+rest+of+the+continent.&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=heonU-rgK-rJygHrv4CYAw&amp;amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=Towards%20the%20end%20of%20the%20sixth%20century%20a%20great%20spiritual%20leader%2C%20Gregory%2C%20became%20Pope.%20He%20inherited%20a%20Church%20which%20was%20very%20weak%20and%20disorganized.%20Consequently%20he%20set%20about%20sending%20key%20people%20throughout%20the%20continent%20to%20organize%20this%20Church%2C%20and%20bring%20some%20sense%20of%20cohesion.%20To%20these%20islands%20he%20sent%20St%20Augustine...to%20bring%20the%20wayward%20Celtic%20churches%20into%20line.%20Then%2C%20as%20now%2C%20the%20life%20of%20those%20in%20the%20British%20Isles%20tended%20to%20be%20rather%20separate%20from%20the%20rest%20of%20the%20continent.&amp;amp;f=false'>Celtic Resource Book</link></italics><space/>(Church House Publishing, 2009), author Martin Wallace writes that &quot;it is important to remember that there was never any such thing as 'The Celtic Church'. It was never an organized system in the way that we understand churches today. Rather, each Celtic church was highly independent and if there was a relationship between any of them the relationship tended to be one of spiritual support through missionary endeavour, rather than through any particular church structure. It is also important to remember that the Celtic church life as it emerged in fifth-century Ireland would be quite different to that which emerged in nineteenth century Hebridean communities.

Celtic monks had a different type of tonsure or haircut.

The great body of the clergy and laity did not stand with Wilfrid. "To all," says Dr. Bright, "the See of Peter was a title of august and sacred import.

The Elizabethan Settlement stopped the radical Protestant tendencies under Edward VI by combining the more radical elements of the Second Prayer Book of 1552 with the conservative 'Catholic' First Prayer Book of 1549.

Historical studies on the period 1560-1660 written before the late 1960s tended to project the predominant conformist spirituality and doctrine of the 1660s on the ecclesiastical situation one hundred years before, and there was also a tendency to take polemically binary partitions of reality claimed by contestants studied (such as the dichotomies Protestant-'Popish' or 'Laudian'-'Puritan') at face value. Since the late 1960s these fallacies have been criticized. Studies on the subject written during the last forty-five years have, however, not reached any consensus on how to interpret this period in English church history. The extent to which one or several positions concerning doctrine and spirituality existed alongside with the more well-known and articulate Puritan movement and the Durham House Party, and the exact extent of continental Calvinism among the English elite and among the ordinary churchgoers from the 1560s to the 1620s are subjects of current and ongoing debate.<extension extension_name='ref'>For a study stressing the hegemony of continental Calvinism before the 1620's, see Tyacke, Nicholas:<space/><italics>Anti-Calvinists: The Rise of English Arminianism, c. 1590-1640</italics>, Clarendon Press, Oxford 1987; For a study perceiving an emerging self-conscious 'Prayer Book Episcopalism' distinct from, but a predecessor to,<space/><link><target>Restoration (England)</target><part>Restoration</part></link><space/>Anglicanism, see Maltby, Judith:<space/><italics>Prayer Book and People in Elizabethan and Early Stuart England</italics>, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1998.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>In 1662, under<space/><link><target>Charles II of England</target><part>King Charles II</part></link>, a revised<space/><link><target>Book of Common Prayer</target></link><space/>was produced, which was acceptable to high churchmen as well as some Puritans, and is still considered authoritative to this day.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="title">Welcome to the Book of Common Prayer</arg><arg name="author">Vicki K.

This use of a set order of service is not unlike the Catholic tradition. Traditionally the pattern was that laid out in the<space/><link><target>Book of Common Prayer</target></link>. Although many Anglican churches now use a wide range of modern service books written in the local language, the structures of the Book of Common Prayer are largely retained. Churches which call themselves Anglican will have identified themselves so because they use some form or variant of the Book of Common Prayer in the shaping of their worship.</paragraph><paragraph>Anglican worship, however, is as diverse as Anglican theology. A contemporary &quot;<link><target>low church</target></link>&quot; or Evangelical service may differ little from the worship of many mainstream non-Anglican Protestant churches. The service is constructed around a sermon focused on Biblical exposition and opened with one or more Bible readings and closed by a series of prayers (both set and extemporised) and hymns or songs. A &quot;<link><target>high church</target></link>&quot; or Anglo-Catholic service, by contrast, is usually a more formal<space/><link><target>liturgy</target></link><space/>celebrated by clergy in distinctive<space/><link><target>vestments</target></link><space/>and may be almost indistinguishable from a Roman Catholic service, often resembling the &quot;pre-Vatican II&quot;<space/><link><target>Tridentine Mass</target><part>Tridentine rite</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Between these extremes are a variety of styles of worship, often involving a robed choir and the use of the organ to accompany the singing and to provide music before and after the service. Anglican churches tend to have<space/><link><target>pew</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>or chairs and it is usual for the congregation to kneel for some prayers but to stand for hymns and other parts of the service such as the Gloria, Collect, Gospel reading, Creed and either the Preface or all of the Eucharistic Prayer. High Anglicans may genuflect or cross themselves in the same way as Roman Catholics.</paragraph><paragraph>Other more traditional Anglicans tend to follow the 1662<space/><link><target>Book of Common Prayer</target></link>, and retain the use of the King James Bible. This is typical in many Anglican cathedrals and particularly in<space/><link><target>Royal Peculiar</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>such as the<space/><link><target>Savoy Chapel</target></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>Queen's Chapel</target></link>. These services reflect the original Anglican doctrine and differ from the<space/><link><target>Traditional Anglican Communion</target></link><space/>in that they are in favour of women vicars and the ability of vicars to marry. These Anglican church services include classical music instead of songs, hymns from the<space/><link><target>New English Hymnal</target></link><space/>(usually excluding modern hymns such as Lord of the Dance), and are generally non-evangelical and formal in practice. Due to their association with royalty, these churches are generally host to staunch Anglicans who are strongly opposed to Catholicism.</paragraph><paragraph>Until the mid-20th century the main Sunday service was typically<space/><link><target>Morning Prayer (Anglican)</target><part>morning prayer</part></link>, but the<space/><link><target>Eucharist</target></link><space/>has once again become the standard form of Sunday worship in many Anglican churches; this again is similar to Roman Catholic practice. Other common Sunday services include an early morning Eucharist without music, an abbreviated Eucharist following a service of morning prayer and a service of<space/><link><target>Evening Prayer (Anglican)</target><part>evening prayer</part></link>, sometimes in the form of sung<space/><link><target>Evening Prayer (Anglican)</target><part>Evensong</part></link>, usually celebrated between 3 and 6&amp;nbsp;pm The late-evening service of<space/><link><target>Compline</target></link><space/>was revived in parish use in the early 20th century. Many Anglican churches will also have daily morning and evening prayer and some have midweek or even daily celebration of the Eucharist.</paragraph><paragraph>An Anglican service (whether or not a Eucharist) will include readings from the Bible that are generally taken from a standardised<space/><link><target>lectionary</target></link>, which provides for much of the Bible (and some passages from the<space/><link><target>Biblical apocrypha</target><part>Apocrypha</part></link>) to be read out loud in the church over a cycle of one, two or three years (depending on which eucharistic and office lectionaries are used, respectively). The<space/><link><target>sermon</target></link><space/>(or<space/><link><target>homily</target></link>) is typically about ten to twenty minutes in length, though it may be much longer in Evangelical churches.

The role of the crown in the Church of England is practically limited to the appointment of bishops, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, and even this role is limited, as the Church presents the government with a short list of candidates to choose from. This process is accomplished through collaboration with and consent of ecclesial representatives<space/><italics>(see<space/><link><target>Ecclesiastical Commissioners</target></link>)</italics>. The monarch has no constitutional role in Anglican churches in other parts of the world, although the prayer books of several countries where she is head of state maintain prayers for her as sovereign.</paragraph><paragraph>A characteristic of Anglicanism is that it has no international juridical authority. All thirty-nine provinces of the Anglican Communion are autonomous, each with their own<space/><link><target>primate (bishop)</target><part>primate</part></link><space/>and governing structure. These provinces may take the form of national churches (such as in Canada, Uganda, or Japan) or a collection of nations (such as the West Indies, Central Africa, or South Asia), or geographical regions (such as Vanuatu and Solomon Islands) etc. Within these Communion provinces may exist subdivisions, called<space/><link><target>ecclesiastical province</target><trail>s</trail></link>, under the jurisdiction of a metropolitan archbishop.</paragraph><paragraph>All provinces of the Anglican Communion consist of<space/><link><target>diocese</target><trail>s</trail></link>, each under the jurisdiction of a bishop.

Pope Benedict XVI has approved, within the Apostolic Constitution, a canonical structure that provides for Personal Ordinariates, which will allow former Anglicans to enter full communion with the Catholic Church while preserving elements of distinctive Anglican spiritual patrimony.

The announcement of this Apostolic Constitution brings to an end a period of uncertainty for such groups who have nurtured hopes of new ways of embracing unity with the Catholic Church.
