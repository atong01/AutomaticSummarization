'''Calreticulin''' also known as  '''calregulin''', '''CRP55''', '''CaBP3''', '''calsequestrin-like protein''', and '''endoplasmic reticulum resident protein 60''' (ERp60) is a [[protein]] that in humans is encoded by the ''CALR'' [[gene]].<ref name="pmid2365822">{{cite journal | vauthors = McCauliffe DP, Zappi E, Lieu TS, Michalak M, Sontheimer RD, Capra JD | title = A human Ro/SS-A autoantigen is the homologue of calreticulin and is highly homologous with onchocercal RAL-1 antigen and an aplysia "memory molecule" | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 86 | issue = 1 | pages = 332–5 | date = Jul 1990 | pmid = 2365822 | pmc = 296725 | doi = 10.1172/JCI114704 }}</ref><ref name="entrez">{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: calreticulin| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=811| accessdate = }}</ref>

Calreticulin is a multifunctional [[protein]] that binds [[calcium|Ca<sup>2+</sup>]] [[ion]]s (a [[second messenger]] in [[signal transduction]]), rendering it inactive. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> is bound with low [[chemical affinity|affinity]], but high [[valence (chemistry)|capacity]], and can be released on a signal (see [[inositol triphosphate]]). Calreticulin is located in storage compartments associated with the [[endoplasmic reticulum]].<ref name="entrez"/>

The term "Mobilferrin"<ref>{{MeshName|Mobilferrin}}</ref> is considered to be the same as calreticulin by some sources.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Beutler E, West C, Gelbart T | title = HLA-H and associated proteins in patients with hemochromatosis | journal = Molecular Medicine (Cambridge, Mass.) | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | pages = 397–402  | date = Jun 1997 | pmid = 9234244 | pmc = 2230203 | doi =  }}</ref>

== Function ==

Calreticulin binds to misfolded proteins and prevents them from being exported from the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] to the [[Golgi apparatus]].

A similar quality-control [[chaperone (protein)|molecular chaperone]], [[calnexin]], performs the same service for soluble proteins as does calreticulin.  Both proteins, calnexin and calreticulin, have the function of binding to [[oligosaccharide]]s containing terminal glucose residues, thereby targeting them for degradation.  In normal cellular function, trimming of glucose residues off the core oligosaccharide added during N-linked [[glycosylation]] is a part of protein processing.  If "overseer" enzymes note that residues are misfolded, proteins within the [[rough endoplasmic reticulum|rER]] will re-add glucose residues so that other calreticulin/calnexin can bind to these proteins and prevent them from proceeding to the Golgi.  This leads these aberrantly folded proteins down a path whereby they are targeted for degradation.

Studies on transgenic mice reveal that calreticulin is a cardiac embryonic gene that is essential during development.<ref name="pmid12445456">{{cite journal | vauthors = Michalak M, Lynch J, Groenendyk J, Guo L, Robert Parker JM, Opas M | title = Calreticulin in cardiac development and pathology | journal = Biochimica Et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1600 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 32–7 | date = Nov 2002 | pmid = 12445456 | doi = 10.1016/S1570-9639(02)00441-7 }}</ref>

Calreticulin and calnexin are also integral proteins in the production of [[MHC class I]] Proteins. As newly synthesized MHC class I α-chains enter the endoplasmic reticulum, calnexin binds on to them retaining them in a partly folded state.<ref>{{cite book | author = Murphy K |title=Janeway's Immunobiology | date = 2011 | publisher = Taylor & Francis | location = Oxford | isbn = 978-0815342434 | edition = 8th}}</ref> After the β2-microglobulin binds to the peptide-loading complex (PLC), calreticulin (along with [[ERp57]] takes over the job of chaperoning the MHC class I protein while the [[tapasin]] links the complex to the [[transporter associated with antigen processing]] (TAP) complex. This association prepares the MHC class I for binding an antigen for presentation on the cell surface.

=== Transcription regulation ===

Calreticulin is also found in the nucleus, suggesting that it may have a role in transcription regulation. Calreticulin binds to the [[synthetic peptide]] KLGFFKR, which is almost identical to an amino acid sequence in the [[DNA-binding domain]] of the superfamily of [[nuclear receptor]]s. The [[N-terminus|amino terminus]] of calreticulin interacts with the DNA-binding domain of the [[glucocorticoid receptor]] and prevents the receptor from binding to its specific [[glucocorticoid response element]]. Calreticulin can inhibit the binding of [[androgen receptor]] to its hormone-responsive DNA element and can inhibit androgen receptor and [[retinoic acid receptor]] transcriptional activities in vivo, as well as retinoic acid-induced neuronal differentiation. Thus, calreticulin can act as an important modulator of the regulation of gene transcription by nuclear hormone receptors.

== Clinical significance ==

Calreticulin binds to [[antibody|antibodies]] in certain sera of [[Lupus erythematosus|systemic lupus]] and [[Sjögren's syndrome|Sjogren]] patients that contain [[Anti-SSA/Ro autoantibodies|anti-Ro/SSA antibodies]]. Systemic lupus erythematosus is associated with increased autoantibody titers against calreticulin, but calreticulin is not a Ro/SS-A antigen. Earlier papers referred to calreticulin as an Ro/SS-A antigen, but this was later disproven. Increased autoantibody titer against human calreticulin is found in infants with complete congenital heart block of both the [[IgG]] and [[IgM]] classes.<ref>{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: CALR calreticulin| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=811| accessdate = }}</ref>

In 2013, two groups detected calreticulin mutations in a majority of [[Janus kinase 2|JAK2]]-negative/[[thrombopoietin receptor|MPL]]-negative patients with [[essential thrombocytosis]] and [[myelofibrosis|primary myelofibrosis]], which makes ''CALR'' mutations the second most common in [[myeloproliferative disease|myeloproliferative neoplasms]]. All mutations (insertions or deletions) affected the last exon, generating a reading [[Frameshift mutation|frame shift]] of the resulting protein, that creates a novel terminal peptide and causes a loss of endoplasmic reticulum [[ER retention|KDEL retention signal]].<ref name="pmid24325359">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nangalia J, Massie CE, Baxter EJ, Nice FL, Gundem G, Wedge DC, Avezov E, Li J, Kollmann K, Kent DG, Aziz A, Godfrey AL, Hinton J, Martincorena I, Van Loo P, Jones AV, Guglielmelli P, Tarpey P, Harding HP, Fitzpatrick JD, Goudie CT, Ortmann CA, Loughran SJ, Raine K, Jones DR, Butler AP, Teague JW, O'Meara S, McLaren S, Bianchi M, Silber Y, Dimitropoulou D, Bloxham D, Mudie L, Maddison M, Robinson B, Keohane C, Maclean C, Hill K, Orchard K, Tauro S, Du MQ, Greaves M, Bowen D, Huntly BJ, Harrison CN, Cross NC, Ron D, Vannucchi AM, Papaemmanuil E, Campbell PJ, Green AR | title = Somatic CALR mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms with nonmutated JAK2 | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 369 | issue = 25 | pages = 2391–405 | date = Dec 2013 | pmid = 24325359 | pmc = 3966280 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1312542 }}</ref><ref name="pmid24325356">{{cite journal | vauthors = Klampfl T, Gisslinger H, Harutyunyan AS, Nivarthi H, Rumi E, Milosevic JD, Them NC, Berg T, Gisslinger B, Pietra D, Chen D, Vladimer GI, Bagienski K, Milanesi C, Casetti IC, Sant'Antonio E, Ferretti V, Elena C, Schischlik F, Cleary C, Six M, Schalling M, Schönegger A, Bock C, Malcovati L, Pascutto C, Superti-Furga G, Cazzola M, Kralovics R | title = Somatic mutations of calreticulin in myeloproliferative neoplasms | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 369 | issue = 25 | pages = 2379–90 | date = Dec 2013 | pmid = 24325356 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1311347 }}</ref>

== Role in cancer ==

Calreticulin (CRT) is expressed in many cancer cells and plays a role to promote [[macrophage]]s to engulf hazardous cancerous cells. The reason why most of the cells are not destroyed is the presence of another molecule with signal [[CD47]], which blocks CRT.  Hence antibodies that block CD47 might be useful as a cancer treatment. In mice models of [[myeloid leukemia]] and [[non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma]], anti-CD47 were effective in clearing cancer cells while normal cells were unaffected.<ref name="pmid21178137">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chao MP, Jaiswal S, Weissman-Tsukamoto R, Alizadeh AA, Gentles AJ, Volkmer J, Weiskopf K, Willingham SB, Raveh T, Park CY, Majeti R, Weissman IL | title = Calreticulin is the dominant pro-phagocytic signal on multiple human cancers and is counterbalanced by CD47 | journal = Science Translational Medicine | volume = 2 | issue = 63 | pages = 63ra94 | date = Dec 2010 | pmid = 21178137 | pmc = 4126904 | doi = 10.1126/scitranslmed.3001375 | laysummary = http://med.stanford.edu/ism/2010/december/crt-signal.html | laysource = Stanford School of Medicine }}</ref>
