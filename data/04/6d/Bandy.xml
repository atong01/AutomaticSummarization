While modern ice hockey was created in Canada, a game more similar to bandy was played initially, after British soldiers introduced the game in the 19th century. At the same time that modern ice-hockey rules were formalized in<space/><link><target>British North America</target></link>, bandy rules were formulated in Europe. A cross between English and Russian rules developed, with the football-inspired English rules dominant, together with the Russian low border along most of the two sidelines.</paragraph><paragraph>Before Canadians introduced ice hockey into Europe in the late 19th century, &quot;<link><target>hockey</target></link>&quot; was another name for bandy,<extension extension_name='ref'>Nordisk Familjebok 10 Hassle-Infektera, Frlagshuset Norden AB, Malm 1952, &quot;Hockey&quot;, column 386</extension><space/>and still is in parts of Russia and Kazakhstan.</paragraph><paragraph>With football and bandy being dominant sports in parts of Europe, it was common for sports clubs to have both popular bandy and football sections, with athletes playing both sports but during different times of the year.

If both teams have scored an equal number of goals, then, with some exceptions, the game is a draw.</paragraph><paragraph>The primary rule is that the players (other than the goalkeepers) may not intentionally touch the ball with their heads, hands or arms during play. Although players usually use their sticks to move the ball around, they may use any part of their bodies other than their heads, hands or arms and may use their skates in a limited manner. Heading the ball will result in a five-minute penalty.</paragraph><paragraph>In typical game play, players attempt to propel the ball toward their opponents' goal through individual control of the ball, such as by<space/><link><target>dribbling</target></link>, passing the ball to a team-mate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent who controls the ball. However, physical contact between opponents is limited. Bandy is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play, or when play is stopped by the<space/><link><target>referee</target></link>. After a stoppage, play can recommence with a free stroke, a penalty shot or a corner stroke. If the ball has left the field along the sidelines, the referee must decide which team touched the ball last, and award a restart stroke to the opposing team, just like football's throw-in.</paragraph><paragraph>The rules do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper, but a number of player specialisations have evolved. Broadly, these include three main categories: forwards, whose main task is to score goals; defenders, who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and midfielders, who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards. Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to discern them from the single goalkeeper. These positions are further differentiated by which side of the field the player spends most time in. For example, there are central defenders, and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in these positions in any combination (for example, there may be three defenders, five midfielders, and two forwards), and the number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders would create a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse would create a slower, more defensive style of play. While players may spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time. The layout of the players on the pitch is called the team's<space/><italics>formation</italics>, and defining the team's formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the team's manager(s).</paragraph><heading level='2'>Rules</heading><heading level='3'>Overview</heading><paragraph>There are eighteen rules in official play. The same rules are designed to apply to all levels of bandy, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, veterans or women are permitted. The rules are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game.

A team of fewer than eight players may not start a game. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, but they are only allowed to do so within the penalty area in front of their own goal. Though there are a variety of positions in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the rules of the game.</paragraph><paragraph>Any number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game. Substitutions can be performed without notifying the referee and can be performed while the ball is in play. However, if the substitute enters the ice before his teammate has left it, this will result in a five-minute ban. A team can bring at the most four substitutes to the game and one of these is likely to be an extra goalkeeper.</paragraph><paragraph>A game is officiated by a referee, the authority and enforcer of the rules, whose decisions are final. The referee may be assisted by one or two assistant referees.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Equipment</heading><paragraph>The basic equipment players are required to wear include a pair of<space/><link><target>Ice skate</target><part>skates</part></link>, a<space/><link><target>helmet</target></link>, a mouth guard and, in the case of the goalkeeper, a face guard.

There is usually a 15-minute &quot;half-time&quot; break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time.</paragraph><paragraph>The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is commonly referred to as<space/><italics>stoppage time</italics><space/>or<space/><italics>injury time</italics>, and must be reported to the match secretary and the two captains. The referee alone signals the end of the match.</paragraph><paragraph>In league competitions games may end in a draw, but in some knockout competitions if a game is tied at the end of regulation time it may go into extra time, which consists of two further 15-minute periods. If the score is still tied after extra time, the game will be replayed. As an alternative, the extra two times 15-minutes may be played as &quot;golden goal&quot; which means that the first team that scores during the extra-time wins the game. If both extra periods are played without a scored goal, a penalty shootout will settle the game. The teams shoot five penalties each and if this doesn't settle the game, the teams shoot one more penalty each until one of them misses and the other scores.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Ball in and out of play</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Playing the ball in bandy</arg></template>Under the rules, the two basic states of play during a game are<space/><italics>ball in play</italics><space/>and<space/><italics>ball out of play</italics>. From the beginning of each playing period with a stroke-off (a set strike from the centre-spot by one team) until the end of the playing period, the ball is in play at all times, except when either the ball leaves the field of play, or play is stopped by the referee. When the ball becomes out of play, play is restarted by one of six restart methods depending on how it went out of play:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>Stroke-off</listitem><listitem>Goal-throw</listitem><listitem>Corner stroke</listitem><listitem>Free-stroke</listitem><listitem><link><target>Penalty shot</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Face-off#Other sports</target><part>Face-off</part></link></listitem></list><paragraph>If the time runs out while a team is preparing for a free-stroke or penalty, the strike should still be made but it must go into the goal by one shot to count as a goal. Similarly, a goal made via a corner stroke should be allowed, but it must be executed using only one shot in addition to the strike needed to put the ball in play.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Free-strokes and penalty shots</heading><paragraph>Free-strokes can be awarded to a team if a player of the opposite team offends any rule, for example, by hitting with the stick against the opponent's stick or skates. Free-strokes can also be awarded upon incorrect execution of corner-strikes, free-strikes, goal-throws, and so on. or the use of incorrect equipment, such as a broken stick.</paragraph><paragraph>Rather than stopping play, the<space/><link><target>referee</target></link><space/>may allow play to continue when its continuation will benefit the team against which an offence has been committed. This is known as &quot;playing an advantage&quot;. The referee may &quot;call back&quot; play and penalise the original offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue within a short period of time, typically taken to be four to five seconds. Even if an offence is not penalised because the referee plays an advantage, the offender may still be sanctioned (see below) for any associated misconduct at the next stoppage of play.</paragraph><paragraph>If a defender violently attacks an opponent within the penalty area, a penalty shot is awarded. Certain other offences, when carried out within the penalty area, result in a penalty shot provided there is a goal situation. These offences include a defender holding or hooking an attacker, or blocking a goal situation with a lifted skate, thrown stick or glove and so on. Also, the defenders (with the exception of the goal-keeper) are not allowed to kneel or lay on the ice. The final offences that might mandate a penalty shot are those of hitting or blocking an opponent's stick or touching the ball with the hands, arms, stick or head above the shoulders. If any of these actions is carried out in a non-goal situation, they shall be awarded with a free-stroke from one of the free-stroke spots at the penalty area line. A penalty shot should always be accompanied by a 5 or 10 minutes penalty (see below). If the penalty results in a goal, the penalty should be considered personal meaning that a substitute can be sent in for the penalised player. This does not apply in the event of a red card (see below).</paragraph><heading level='3'>Warnings and penalties</heading><paragraph><template><target>double image</target><arg>right</arg><arg>Blue card.svg</arg><arg>60</arg><arg>Red card.svg</arg><arg>60</arg><arg>Blue: 10 minutes penalty, red: [[match penalty]].</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>A ten minutes penalty is indicated through the use of a blue card and can be caused by protesting or behaving incorrectly, attacking an opponent violently or stopping the ball incorrectly to get an advantage.</paragraph><paragraph>The third time a player receives a penalty, it will be a personal penalty meaning he or she will miss the remainder of the match. A substitute can enter the field after five or ten minutes. A full game penalty can be received upon using abusive language or directly attacking an opponent and means that the player can neither play nor be substituted for the remainder of the game.

The Swedes contributed largely, and clubs sprang up around the capital of Oslo. Oslo, including neighbouring towns, is still today the region where bandy enjoys most popularity in Norway.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1912 the Norwegians played their first<space/><link><target>List of Norwegian bandy champions</target><part>National Championship</part></link>, which was played annually up to 1940. During WWII, illegal bandy was played in hidden places in forests, on ponds and lakes. In 1943, 44 and 45, illegal championships were held. In 1946 legal play resumed and still goes on. After WWII the number of teams rose, as well as attendance which regularly were in the thousands, but mild winters in the 1970s and 80s shrunk the league, and in 2003 only 5 clubs (teams) fought out the 1st division with low attendance numbers and little media coverage.</paragraph><paragraph>In recent years, the number of artificially frozen pitches have increased in Norway, and more sports clubs have reinvigorated their bandy sections with new men's and youth teams. Because of this, as well as an increase of Swedish players in Norway, the competitiveness of the game has risen, especially in the first division Eliteserien. The adult men's game in Norway today consists of Eliteserien with 8 teams, as well as 3 lower divisions. Bandy in Norway has also started to spread geographically, and while the sport is more popular than ice hockey in and around the capital Oslo, some clubs in apart locations in the 3rd division only have access to hockey rinks and therefor play rink bandy for home games. Compared to the past, attendance is still fairly low, but important Eliteserien matches can attract around 1000 spectators.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Russia</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Stadium Trud Arkhangelsk.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part><link><target>Trud Stadium (Arkhangelsk)</target><part>Trud Stadium</part></link><space/>in<space/><link><target>Arkhangelsk</target></link>.</part></link>In Russia bandy is known as hockey with a ball or simply Russian hockey.

Russians played this game using ordinary footwear, with sticks made out of juniper wood, only later were skates introduced. It was only in the second half of the 19th century that bandy became popular among the masses throughout the<space/><link><target>Russian Empire</target></link>. Traditionally the Russians used a longer skate blade than other nations, giving them the advantage of skating faster. However, they would find it more difficult to turn quickly. A bandy skate has a longer blade than a hockey skate, and the &quot;Russian skate&quot; even longer.</paragraph><paragraph>When the Federation of International Bandy was formed in 1955, with the Soviet Union as one of its founding members, the Russians largely adopted the international rules of the game developed in England in the 19th century, with one notable exception.
