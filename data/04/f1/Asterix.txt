'''''Asterix''''' or '''''The Adventures of Asterix''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Astérix'''''   or '''''Astérix le Gaulois'''}}, {{IPA-fr|asteʁiks lə ɡolwa|IPA}}) is a series of [[French comics]].  The series first appeared in the [[Franco-Belgian comics]] magazine ''[[Pilote]]'' on 29 October 1959.  It was written by [[René Goscinny]] and illustrated by [[Albert Uderzo]] until the death of Goscinny in 1977.  Uderzo then took over the writing until 2009, when he sold the rights to publishing company [[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette]]. As of 2015, 36 volumes have been released.

The series follows the exploits of a village of indomitable [[Gauls]] as they resist [[Roman Republic|Roman]] occupation. They do so by means of a magic potion, brewed by their [[druid]] called Getafix in the English translations, which gives the recipient superhuman strength. The protagonist, the titular character [[Asterix (character)|Asterix]], along with his friend [[Obelix]] have various adventures. The "ix" ending of both names (as well as all the other pseudo-Gaulish "ix" names in the series) alludes to the "rix" suffix (meaning "king") present in the names of many real Gaulish chieftains such as [[Vercingetorix]], [[Orgetorix]], and [[Dumnorix]]. (See [[Asterix#Character_names|below]] for further explanations of the character names.) Many of the stories have them travel to foreign countries, though others are set in and around their village. For much of the history of the series (Volumes 4 through 29), settings in Gaul and abroad alternated, with even-numbered volumes set abroad and odd-numbered volumes set in Gaul, mostly in the village.

The ''Asterix'' series is one of the most popular Franco-Belgian comics in the world, with the series being translated into over 100 languages, and it is popular in most European countries.<ref name="Time">{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1931169,00.html|title=Asterix at 50: The Comic Hero Conquers the World|date=November 19, 2009|newspaper=Time|first=Leo|last=Cendrowicz}}</ref>

The success of the series has led to the adaptation of several books into [[List of Asterix films|13 films]]: nine animated, and four live action. There have also been a number of [[List of Asterix games|games]] based on the characters, and a theme park near Paris, [[Parc Astérix]].

Prior to creating the ''Asterix'' series, Goscinny and Uderzo had previously had success with their series ''[[Oumpah-pah]]'', which was published in ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine.<ref name="Comic creator">{{cite web |url=http://lambiek.net/home.htm|title=René Goscinny|author= |date= |work= |publisher=Comic creator |accessdate=9 March 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100324201421/http://lambiek.net/home.htm| archivedate= 24 March 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
[[File:Uderzo dibujando a Asterix.jpg|thumb|[[Albert Uderzo]] drawing Astérix, in 1971.]]
''Astérix'' was originally serialised in ''[[Pilote]]'' magazine, in the very first issue published on 29 October 1959.<ref name="Pilote-1959">{{cite web | last =BDoubliées | title =Pilote année 1959 | url =http://bdoubliees.com/journalpilote/series1/asterix.htm | language = French }}</ref> In 1961 the first book was put together, titled ''[[Asterix the Gaul]]''. From then on, books were released generally on a yearly basis. Their success was exponential; the first book sold 6,000 copies in its year of publication; a year later, the second sold 20,000. In 1963, the third sold 40,000; the fourth, released in 1964, sold 150,000. A year later, the fifth sold 300,000; 1966's ''Asterix and the Big Fight'' sold 400,000 upon initial publication. The ninth Asterix volume, when first released in 1967, sold 1.2 million copies in two days.

Uderzo's first sketches portrayed Asterix as a huge and strong traditional Gaulish warrior. But Goscinny had a different picture in his mind. He visualized Asterix as a shrewd small sized warrior who would prefer intelligence over strength. However, Uderzo felt that the small sized hero needed a strong but dim companion to which Goscinny agreed. Hence, Obelix was born.<ref name="Kessler Peter">{{cite book |last1= Kessler |first1= Peter |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Asterix Complete Guide |trans_title= |url= |accessdate=11 March 2010 |format= |edition= First |series= |volume= |date=2 November 1995 |origyear= |publisher=Hodder Children's Books;  |location= |isbn=0-340-65346-9 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages= |trans_chapter= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}</ref> Despite the growing popularity of Asterix with the readers, the financial backing for Pilote ceased. Pilote was taken over by [[Dargaud|Georges Dargaud]].<ref name="Kessler Peter"/>

When Goscinny died in 1977, Uderzo continued the series alone on the demand of the readers who implored him to continue. He continued the series but on a less frequent basis. Most critics and fans of the series prefer Goscinny's albums.<ref name="beeb"/> Uderzo created his own publishing company, Les Editions [[Albert-René]], which published every album drawn and written by Uderzo alone since then.<ref name="Kessler Peter"/> However, [[Dargaud]], the initial publisher of the series, kept the publishing rights on the 24 first albums made by both Uderzo and Goscinny. In 1990, the Uderzo and Goscinny families decided to sue Dargaud to take over the rights. In 1998, after a long trial, Dargaud lost the rights to publish and sell the albums. Uderzo decided to sell these rights to Hachette instead of Albert-René, but the publishing rights on new albums were still owned by Albert Uderzo (40%), Sylvie Uderzo (20%) and Anne Goscinny (40%).

Although Uderzo declared he did not want anyone to continue the series after his death, which is similar to the request [[Hergé]] made regarding his ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', his attitude changed and in December 2008 he sold his stake to Hachette, which took over the company and now owns the rights.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In a letter published in the French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' in 2009, Uderzo's daughter, Sylvie, attacked her father's decision to sell the family publishing firm and the rights to produce new ''Astérix'' adventures after his death. She said "...the co-creator of ''Astérix'', France’s comic strip hero, has betrayed the Gaulish warrior to the modern-day Romans – the men of industry and finance”.<ref>{{cite news | last=Shirbon | first=Estelle | work=[[Reuters]] | date=14 January 2009 | accessdate=16 January 2009 | title=Asterix battles new Romans in publishing dispute| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSTRE50D46K20090114}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7831375.stm | title=Divisions emerge in Asterix camp | date=15 January 2009 | accessdate=16 January 2009 | work=[[BBC News Online]] | location=London| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090119011222/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7831375.stm| archivedate= 19 January 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> However, René Goscinny's daughter Anne also gave her agreement to the continuation of the series and sold her rights at the same time.

In January 2015, after the murders of seven cartoonists at the satirical Paris weekly Charlie Hebdo, presumably for their controversial work, Astérix creator Albert Uderzo came out of retirement to draw 2 Astérix pictures honoring the memories of the victims.

{{Div col end}}

''[[Asterix Conquers Rome]]'' is a comics adaptation of the animated film ''[[The Twelve Tasks of Asterix]]''. It was released in 1976, and was the 23rd volume to be published, but it has been rarely reprinted and is not considered to be [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] to the series. The only English translation ever to be published were in the ''Asterix Annual 1980'' and as a standalone volume in 1984.

In 2007, Les Editions Albert René released a tribute volume titled ''[[Astérix et ses Amis]]'', a 60-page volume of one-to-four-page short stories. It was a tribute to Albert Uderzo on his 80th birthday by 34 European cartoonists. The volume was translated into nine languages. {{as of|2010}}, it has not been translated into English.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asterix.com/edition/albums-hors-collection/asterix-et-ses-amis.html |title=Les albums hors collection - Astérix et ses Amis - Hommage à Albert Uderzo |publisher=Asterix.com |date= |accessdate=31 December 2010}}</ref>

==Synopsis and characters==
{{Main|List of Asterix characters}}
The main setting for the series is an unnamed coastal village in [[Armorica]] (present-day [[Brittany]]), a province of [[Gaul]] (modern France), in the year 50 BC. Julius Caesar has conquered nearly all of Gaul for the Roman Republic. The little Armorican village, however, has held out because the villagers can gain temporary superhuman strength by drinking a magic potion brewed by the local village druid, [[List of Asterix characters#Getafix|Getafix]]. His chief is [[List of Asterix characters#Vitalstatistix|Vitalstatistix]].

The main protagonist and hero of the village is [[Asterix (character)|Asterix]], who, because of his shrewdness, is usually entrusted with the most important affairs of the village. He is aided in his adventures by his rather fat and unintelligent friend, Obelix, who, because he fell into the druid's cauldron of the potion as a baby, has permanent superhuman strength (because of this, Getafix steadily refuses to allow Obelix to drink the potion, as doing so would have a dangerous and unpredictable result). Obelix is usually accompanied by [[List of Asterix characters#Dogmatix|Dogmatix]], his little dog. (Except for Asterix and Obelix, the names of the characters change with the language. For example, Obelix's dog's name is "Dogmatix" in English, but "Idéfix" in the original French edition.)

Asterix and Obelix (and sometimes other members of the village) go on various adventures both within the village and in far away lands. Places visited in the series include parts of Gaul ([[Lutetia]], [[Corsica]] etc.), neighbouring nations (Belgium, Spain, [[Great Britain|Britain]], Germany etc.), and far away lands (North America, Middle East, India etc.).

The series employs [[science-fiction]] and [[fantasy]] elements in the more recent books; for instance, the use of [[extraterrestrials]] in ''[[Asterix and the Falling Sky]]'' and the city of [[Atlantis]] in ''[[Asterix and Obelix All at Sea]]''.

==Humour==

The humour encountered in the ''Asterix'' comics is often centering on puns, caricatures, and [[tongue-in-cheek]] [[stereotype]]s of contemporary European nations and [[List of regions in France|French regions]]. Much of the humour in the initial Asterix books was French-specific, which delayed the translation of the books into other languages for fear of losing the jokes and the spirit of the story. Some translations have actually added local humour: In the Italian translation, the Roman legionaries are made to speak in 20th century Roman dialect and Obelix's famous "''Ils sont fous ces romains''" ("These Romans are crazy") is translated as "Sono pazzi questi romani", alluding to the Roman abbreviation ''[[SPQR]]''. In another example: [[Hiccups]] are written [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeically]] in French as "hips", but in English as "hic", allowing Roman legionaries in at least one of the English translations to [[declension|decline]] their hiccups in Latin ("hic, haec, hoc"). The newer albums share a more universal humour, both written and visual.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7049642.stm |title=The vital statistics of Asterix |author= |date=18 October 2007 |work= |publisher=BBC News|accessdate=10 March 2010 | location=London| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100208100111/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7049642.stm| archivedate= 8 February 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In spite of (or perhaps because of) this [[stereotyping]], and notwithstanding some alleged streaks of French [[chauvinism]], the humour has been very well received by European and Francophone cultures around the world.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

===Character names===

All the fictional characters in Asterix have names which are puns on their roles or personalities and which follow certain patterns specific to nationality. Certain rules are followed (most of the time) such as Gauls (and their neighbours) having an '-ix' suffix for the males and ending in '-a' for the females, for example, Chief [[List of Asterix characters#Vitalstatistix|Vitalstatistix]] (so called due to his portly stature) and his wife [[List of Asterix characters#Impedimenta|Impedimenta]] (often at odds with the chief). The male Roman names end in '-us', echoing Latin nominitive male singular form, as in [[List of Asterix characters#Romans|Gluteus Maximus]], a muscle-bound athlete whose name is literally the [[gluteus maximus|butt]] of the joke.  Gothic names (present-day Germany) end in "-ic", after Gothic chiefs such as [[Alaric (disambiguation)|Alaric]] and [[Theoderic]], for example [[Rhetoric]] the interpreter.  Greek names end in "-os" or "-es";  for example, [[Thermos]] the restaurateur. British names end in "-ax" and are often puns on the [[taxation]] associated with the later [[United Kingdom]], such as [[Value added tax|Valuaddedtax]] the druid and [[Selective employment tax|Selectivemploymentax]] the mercenary.  Other nationalities are treated to [[Pidgin]] translations from their language, like Huevos y Bacon, a Spanish chieftain (whose name, meaning [[eggs and bacon]], is often guidebook Spanish for tourists) or literary and other popular media references, like [[List of Asterix characters#Caricatures|Dubbelosix]] (a reference to [[James Bond]]'s codename 007).

Most of these jokes, and hence the names of the characters, are specific to the translation, for example, the druid [[List of Asterix characters#Getafix|Getafix]] is ''Panoramix'' in the original French and ''Miraculix'' in German.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asterix.com/the-a-to-z-of-asterix/characters/getafix.html|publisher=Asterix the official website|title=A to Z of Asterix: Getafix}}</ref> Even so, occasionally the wordplay has been preserved: Obelix's dog, known in the original French as ''Idéfix'' (from ''idée fixe'', a "fixed idea" or obsession), is called ''Dogmatix'' in English, which not only renders the original meaning strikingly closely ("dogmatic") but in fact adds another layer of wordplay with the syllable "Dog-" at the beginning of the name.

The name ''Asterix'', [[French language|French]] ''Astérix'', comes from ''{{lang|fr|astérisque}}'', meaning "[[asterisk]]", which is the typographical symbol '''*''' indicating a footnote, from the Greek word αστήρ (''aster''), meaning a "star"). His name is usually left unchanged in translations, aside from accents and the use of local [[alphabet]]s. For example, in [[Esperanto]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] it is ''Asteriks''. In Turkish he was first named ''Bücür'' meaning "shorty", but the name was then changed. An exception is in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], in which he is known as ''Ástríkur'' ("Rich of love"). In [[Sinhalese Language|Sinhalese]], the name is සූර පප්පා (''Soora Pappa''), which can be interpreted as "[[Hero]]".

For explanations of some of the other names, see [[List of Asterix characters]].

Hungarian-language books have been issued in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] for the [[Magyars|Hungarian]] minority living in [[Serbia]]. Although not a fully autonomous dialect, it slightly differs from the language of the books issued in Hungary. In Sri Lanka, the cartoon series was adapted into [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]] (''Singhalese'') as Sura Pappa, the only Sri Lankan translation of a foreign cartoon that managed to keep the spirit of the original series intact.<ref name="Asterix.com"/>

Most volumes have been translated into [[Latin]] and [[Attic Greek|Ancient Greek]] with accompanying teachers' guides as a way of teaching these ancient languages.

===English translation===
{{Main|English translations of Asterix}}
