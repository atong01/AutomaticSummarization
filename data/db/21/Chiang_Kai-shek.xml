Furthermore, his party was weakened in the war against Japan. Meanwhile, the Communists told different groups, such as peasants, exactly what they wanted to hear, and cloaked themselves in the cover of Chinese Nationalism.<extension extension_name='ref'>Odd Arne Westad,<space/><italics>Restless Empire: China and the World Since 1750</italics><space/>(2012) p. 291</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Chiang's government and army retreated to<space/><link><target>Taiwan</target></link>, where Chiang imposed<space/><link><target>martial law</target></link><space/>and persecuted people critical of his rule in a period known as the &quot;<link><target>White Terror (Taiwan)</target><part>White Terror</part></link>&quot;.

In early 1912, a dispute arose between Chen and Tao Chen-Chang, who was an influential member of the Revolutionary Alliance and who opposed both Sun Yat-sen and Chen. Tao sought to avoid escalating the quarrel by hiding in a hospital but was discovered there by Chiang. Chen dispatched assassins. Chiang may not have taken part in the act but would later assume responsibility to help Chen avoid trouble. Chen valued Chiang despite Chiang's by now legendary quick temper, believing that such bellicosity was useful in a military leader.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Taylor2009p24, 31"><template><target>Harvnb</target><arg>Taylor</arg><arg>2009</arg><arg name="pp">24, 31</arg></template></extension><space/>Alternatively, Professor Pichon Loh reports that Chiang may have killed Tao in the hospital with a pistol.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Cite book</target><arg name="last">Loh<space/></arg><arg name="first">Pichon<space/></arg><arg name="title">The Early Chiang Kai-shek<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Columbia University Press<space/></arg><arg name="year">1971<space/></arg><arg name="page">27</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Chiang's friendship with Chen Qimei signaled an association with Shanghai's criminal syndicate (the<space/><link><target>Green Gang</target></link><space/>headed by<space/><link><target>Du Yuesheng</target></link><space/>and Huang Jinrong).

At this time Sun remained largely sidelined; and, without arms or money, was soon expelled from Guangzhou and exiled again to Shanghai. He was restored to Guangzhou with mercenary help in 1920.

On June 16, 1923, Chen attempted to assassinate Sun and had his residence shelled. During a prolonged skirmish between the troops of these opposing forces, Sun and his wife<space/><link><target>Soong Ching-ling</target></link><space/>narrowly evaded heavy machine gun fire and were rescued by gunboats under Chiang's direction.

During his trip in Russia, Chiang met<space/><link><target>Leon Trotsky</target></link><space/>and other Soviet leaders, but quickly came to the conclusion that the Russian model of government was not suitable for China. Chiang later sent his eldest son, Ching-kuo, to study in Russia. After his father's split from the<space/><link><target>First United Front</target></link><space/>in 1927, Ching-kuo was forced to stay there, as a hostage, until 1937.

Having taken Nanjing in March (and briefly visited Shanghai, now under the control of his close ally Bai Chongxi), Chiang halted his campaign and prepared a violent break with Wang's leftist elements, which he believed threatened his control of the KMT.</paragraph><paragraph>Now with an established national government in Nanjing, and supported by conservative allies including<space/><link><target>Hu Hanmin</target></link>, Chiang's expulsion of the Communists and their Soviet advisers led to the beginning of the<space/><link><target>Chinese Civil War</target></link>.

The ultimate goal of the KMT revolution was democracy, which was not considered to be feasible in China's fragmented state. Since the KMT had completed the first step of revolution through seizure of power in 1928, Chiang's rule thus began a period of what his party considered to be &quot;political tutelage&quot; in Sun Yat-sen's name. During this so-called Republican Era, many features of a modern, functional Chinese state emerged and developed.</paragraph><paragraph>The decade of 1928 to 1937 saw some aspects of foreign<space/><link><target>imperialism</target></link>, concessions and privileges in China, moderated through diplomacy. The government acted to modernize the legal and penal systems, attempted to stabilize prices, amortize debts, reform the banking and currency systems, build railroads and highways, improve public health facilities, legislate against traffic in<space/><link><target>narcotic</target><trail>s</trail></link>, and augment industrial and agricultural production. Not all of these projects were successfully completed.

While much of the urban areas were now under the control of the KMT, much of the countryside remained under the influence of weakened yet undefeated warlords and Communists. Chiang often resolved issues of warlord obstinacy through military action, but such action was costly in terms of men and material. The 1930<space/><link><target>Central Plains War</target></link><space/>alone nearly bankrupted the Nationalist government and caused almost<space/><template><target>formatnum:250000</target></template><space/>casualties on both sides. In 1931,<space/><link><target>Hu Hanmin</target></link>, Chiang's old supporter, publicly voiced a popular concern that Chiang's position as both premier and president flew in the face of the democratic ideals of the Nationalist government. Chiang had Hu put under<space/><link><target>house arrest</target></link>, but he was released after national condemnation after which he left Nanjing and supported a rival government in<space/><link><target>Guangzhou</target></link>. The split resulted in a military conflict between Hu's Guangzhou government and Chiang's Nationalist government.

Following France's agreement to these demands, the withdrawal of Chinese troops began in March 1946. Despite the withdrawal, many Vietnamese who considered themselves as Chinese continued to fight against the French government. Some of Chiang's army stayed to assist the struggle. Many even went to study in China then return to fight for the cause. Ho Chi Minh would be one example.

Reportedly, General Okamura, before surrendering command of all Japanese military forces in Nanjing, offered Chiang control of all 1.5&amp;nbsp;million Japanese military and civilian support staff then present in China. Reportedly, Chiang seriously considered accepting this offer, but declined only in the knowledge that the United States would certainly be outraged by the gesture.

The inability of Li to coordinate KMT military forces led him to put into effect a plan of defense that he had contemplated in 1948. Instead of attempting to defend all of southern China, Li ordered what remained of the Nationalist armies to withdraw to Guangxi and Guangdong, hoping that he could concentrate all available defenses on this smaller, and more easily defensible, area. The object of Li's strategy was to maintain a foothold on the Chinese mainland in the hope that the United States would eventually be compelled to enter the war in China on the Nationalist side.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Gillin290"></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Final Communist advance</heading><paragraph>Chiang opposed Li's plan of defense because it would have placed most of the troops still loyal to Chiang under the control of Li and Chiang's other opponents in the central government. To overcome Chiang's intransigence Li began ousting Chiang's supporters within the central government. Yan Xishan continued in his attempts to work with both sides, creating the impression among Li's supporters that he was a &quot;stooge&quot; of Chiang, while those who supported Chiang began to bitterly resent Yan for his willingness to work with Li. Because of the rivalry between Chiang and Li, Chiang refused to allow Nationalist troops loyal to him to aid in the defense of Guangxi and Guangdong, with the result that Communist forces occupied Guangdong in October 1949.<extension extension_name='ref'>Gillin, Donald G.<space/><italics>Warlord: Yen Hsi-shan in Shansi Province 19111949</italics>.

Sato explained that the continued recognition of Japan towards the Nationalist government was due largely to the personal relationship that various members of the Japanese government felt towards Chiang.

For some, Chiang was a national hero who led the victorious<space/><link><target>Northern Expedition</target></link><space/>against the<space/><link><target>Beiyang government</target><part>Beiyang Warlords</part></link><space/>in 1927, achieving<space/><link><target>Chinese reunification (1928)</target><part>Chinese unification</part></link>, and who subsequently led China to ultimate victory against<space/><link><target>Empire of Japan</target><part>Japan</part></link><space/>in 1945. Some blamed him for not doing enough against the Japanese forces in the lead-up to, and during, the<space/><link><target>Second Sino-Japanese War</target></link>, preferring to withhold his armies for the fight against the Communists, or merely waiting and hoping that the United States would get involved. Some also see him as a champion of<space/><link><target>anti-Communism</target></link>, being a key figure during the formative years of the<space/><link><target>World Anti-Communist League</target></link>. During the<space/><link><target>Cold War</target></link>, he was also seen as the leader who led<space/><link><target>Free area of the Republic of China</target><part>Free China</part></link><space/>and the bulwark against a possible Communist invasion. However, Chiang presided over purges, political authoritarianism, and graft during his tenure in mainland China, and ruled throughout a period of imposed<space/><link><target>martial law</target></link>. His governments were accused of being corrupt even before he even took power in 1928. He also allied with known criminals like<space/><link><target>Du Yuesheng</target></link><space/>for political and financial gains. Some opponents charge that Chiang's efforts in developing Taiwan were mostly to make the island a strong base from which to one day return to mainland China, and that Chiang had little regard for the long-term prosperity and well-being of the<space/><link><target>Taiwanese people</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Today, Chiang's popularity in Taiwan is divided along political lines, enjoying greater support among Kuomintang supporters. He is generally unpopular among<space/><link><target>Democratic Progressive Party</target></link><space/>(DPP) voters and supporters. In sharp contrast to his son,<space/><link><target>Chiang Ching-kuo</target></link>, and to<space/><link><target>Sun Yat-sen</target></link>, his memory is rarely invoked by current political parties, including the Kuomintang.</paragraph><paragraph>In the United States and Europe, Chiang was often perceived negatively as the one who lost China to the Communists. His constant demands for Western support and funding also earned him the nickname of &quot;General Cash-My-Check&quot;. In the West he has been criticized for his poor military skills. He had a record of issuing unrealistic orders and persistently attempting to fight unwinnable battles, leading to the loss of his best troops.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Cite book</target><arg name="last">Fenby</arg><arg name="first">Jonathan</arg><arg name="title">History of Modern China</arg><arg name="pages">279</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>In recent years, there has been an attempt to find a more moderate interpretation of Chiang. Chiang is now increasingly perceived as a man simply overwhelmed by the events in China, having to fight simultaneously Communists, Japanese and provincial warlords while having to reconstruct and unify the country. His sincere, albeit often unsuccessful attempts to build a more powerful nation have been noted by scholars such as<space/><link><target>Jonathan Fenby</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Rana Mitter</target></link>. Mitter has observed that, ironically, today's China is closer to Chiang's vision than to<space/><link><target>Mao Zedong</target></link>'s. He argues that the Communists, since the 1980s, have essentially created the state envisioned by Chiang in the 1930s. Mitter concludes by writing that &quot;one can imagine Chiang Kai-shek's ghost wandering round China today nodding in approval, while Mao's ghost follows behind him, moaning at the destruction of his vision&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Cite book</target><arg name="last">Mitter</arg><arg name="first">Rana</arg><arg name="title">Modern China</arg><arg name="pages">73</arg></template></extension><space/><link><target>Liang Shuming</target></link><space/>opined that Chiang Kai-shek's &quot;greatest contribution was to make the CCP successful.

That inscribed in the genealogical records of his family is<space/><bold>Jiang Zhoutai</bold><space/>(<template><target>zh</target><arg name="c">蔣周泰</arg><arg name="w">'''Chiang Chou-tai'''</arg></template>). This so-called &quot;register name&quot; () is the one under which his extended relatives knew him, and the one he used in formal occasions, such as when he got married. In deference to tradition, family members did not use the register name in conversation with people outside of the family. In fact, the concept of real or original name is not as clear-cut in China as it is in the Western world.</paragraph><paragraph>In honor of tradition, Chinese families waited a number of years before officially naming their offspring. In the meantime, they used a &quot;milk name&quot; (), given to the infant shortly after his birth and known only to the close family. Thus, the actual name that Chiang received at birth was<space/><bold>Jiang Ruiyuan</bold><space/>(<template><target>zh</target><arg name="c">蔣瑞元</arg><arg name="w">'''Chiang Jui-yuan'''</arg></template>).</paragraph><paragraph>In 1903, the 16-year-old Chiang went to<space/><link><target>Ningbo</target></link><space/>to be a student, and he chose a &quot;school name&quot; (). This was actually the formal name of a person, used by older people to address him, and the one he would use the most in the first decades of his life (as the person grew older, younger generations would have to use one of the<space/><link><target>courtesy name</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>instead). (Colloquially, the school name is called &quot;big name&quot; (), whereas the &quot;milk name&quot; is known as the &quot;small name&quot; ().) The school name that Chiang chose for himself was Zhiqing (<template><target>zh</target><arg name="c">志清</arg><arg name="w">Chi-ching</arg></template>; means &quot;purity of intentions&quot;). For the next fifteen years or so, Chiang was known as<space/><bold>Jiang Zhiqing</bold><space/>(<link><target>Wade-Giles</target></link>:<space/><bold>Chiang Chi-ching</bold>). This is the name under which<space/><link><target>Sun Yat-sen</target></link><space/>knew him when Chiang joined the republicans in<space/><link><target>Guangzhou</target></link><space/>in the 1910s.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1912, when Jiang Zhiqing was in Japan, he started to use the name<space/><bold>Chiang Kai-shek</bold><space/>(<link><target>Chinese language</target><part>Chinese</part></link>: ;<space/><link><target>Pinyin</target></link>:<space/><template><target>Audio</target><arg>Zh-Jiang_Jieshi.ogg</arg><arg>'''Jiang Jieshi'''</arg></template>;<space/><link><target>Wade-Giles</target></link>: Chiang Chieh-shih) as a pen name for the articles that he published in a Chinese magazine he founded:<space/><italics>Voice of the Army</italics><space/>(<link><target>Chinese language</target><part>Chinese</part></link>: ). (<italics>Jieshi</italics><space/>is the<space/><link><target>Pinyin</target></link><space/>romanization of the name, based on<space/><link><target>Standard Chinese</target><part>Mandarin</part></link>, but the common romanized rendering is<space/><italics>Kai-shek</italics><space/>which is in<space/><link><target>Cantonese</target><part>Cantonese romanization</part></link>. As the republicans were based in Canton (a Cantonese speaking area, now commonly known as Guangzhou), Chiang became known by Westerners under the Cantonese romanization of his courtesy name, while the family name as known in English seems to be the Mandarin pronunciation of his Chinese family name, transliterated in<space/><link><target>Wade-Giles</target></link>)</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Cihu President Chiang Mausoleum entrance.JPG</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>The entrance to Chiang's tombsite at<space/><link><target>Tzuhu</target></link><space/>(Cihu) uses the official posthumous rendering of Chiang Kai-shek (''<link><target>Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts</target><part>from right to left</part></link>''): The President (space) Lord Chiang Mausoleum.</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>&quot;Kai-shek&quot; soon became his<space/><link><target>courtesy name</target></link><space/>(). Some think the name was chosen from the classic Chinese book the<space/><italics><link><target>I Ching</target></link></italics>; others note that the first character of his courtesy name is also the first character of the courtesy name of his brother and other male relatives on the same generation line, while the second character of his courtesy name<space/><italics>shi</italics><space/>(meaning &quot;stone&quot;) suggests the second character of his &quot;register name&quot;<space/><italics>tai</italics><space/>(the famous<space/><link><target>Mount Tai</target></link><space/>of China). Courtesy names in China often bore a connection with the personal name of the person. As the courtesy name is the name used by people of the same generation to address the person, Chiang soon became known under this new name.</paragraph><paragraph>Sometime in 1917 or 1918, as Chiang became close to<space/><link><target>Sun Yat-sen</target></link>, he changed his name from Jiang Zhiqing to<space/><bold>Jiang Zhongzheng</bold><space/>(<template><target>zh</target><arg name="c">蔣中正</arg><arg name="w">'''Chiang Chung-cheng'''</arg></template>). By adopting the name Chung-cheng (&quot;central uprightness&quot;), he was choosing a name very similar to the name of Sun Yat-sen, who was (and still is) known among Chinese as Zhongshan (meaning &quot;central mountain&quot;), thus establishing a link between the two. The meaning of uprightness, rectitude, or orthodoxy, implied by his name, also positioned him as the legitimate heir of Sun Yat-sen and his ideas. Not surprisingly, the Chinese Communists always rejected the use of this name and it is not well known in<space/><link><target>mainland China</target></link>. However, it was readily accepted by members of the<space/><link><target>Kuomintang</target><part>Chinese Nationalist Party</part></link><space/>and is the name under which Chiang Kai-shek is still commonly known in Taiwan. Often the name is shortened to &quot;Chung-cheng&quot; only (&quot;Zhongzheng&quot; in Pinyin). For many years passengers arriving at the<space/><link><target>Chiang Kai-shek International Airport</target></link><space/>were greeted by signs in Chinese welcoming them to the &quot;Chung Cheng International Airport&quot;. Similarly, the monument erected to Chiang's memory in Taipei, known in English as<space/><link><target>Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall</target></link>, was literally named &quot;Chung Cheng Memorial Hall&quot; in Chinese. In Singapore,<space/><link><target>Chung Cheng High School</target></link><space/>was named after him.</paragraph><paragraph>His name is also written in Taiwan as &quot;<bold>The Late President Lord Chiang</bold>&quot; (), where the one-character-wide space known as<space/><link><target>nuo tai</target></link><space/>shows respect; this practice has lost some popularity.
