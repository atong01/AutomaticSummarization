Peggy Goldwater reportedly hoped that her husband's Senate term, due to end in January 1981, would be his last. Goldwater decided to run, planning to make the term his last in the Senate. Goldwater faced a surprisingly tough battle for reelection. He was viewed by some as out of touch and vulnerable for several reasons; most importantly, because he had planned to retire in 1981, Goldwater had not visited many areas of Arizona outside of Phoenix and Tucson. He was also challenged by a formidable opponent, Bill Schulz, a former Republican turned Democrat and a wealthy<space/><link><target>real estate</target></link><space/>developer. Schulz was able to infuse massive amounts of money into the campaign from his own fortune.</paragraph><paragraph>Arizona's changing population also hurt Goldwater. The state's population had soared, and a huge portion of the electorate had not lived in the state when Goldwater was previously elected; hence, many voters were less familiar with Goldwater's actual beliefs, and he was on the defensive for much of the campaign. Early returns on election night seemed to indicate that Schulz would win. The counting of votes continued through the night and into the next morning. At around daybreak, Goldwater learned that he had been reelected thanks to<space/><link><target>absentee ballot</target><trail>s</trail></link>, which were among the last to be counted.<template><target>Sfn</target><arg><space/>Goldberg<space/></arg><arg><space/>1995<space/></arg><arg name="at"><space/>chapter 12</arg></template><space/>Goldwater's surprisingly close victory in 1980 came despite Reagan's 61% landslide over<space/><link><target>Jimmy Carter</target></link><space/>in Arizona.

Despite his reputation as a firebrand in the 1960s, by the end of his career he was considered a stabilizing influence in the Senate, one of the most respected members of either major party. Though Goldwater remained staunchly anti-communist and &quot;hawkish&quot; on military issues, he was a key supporter of the fight for ratification of the<space/><link><target>Panama Canal Treaty</target></link><space/>in the 1970s, which would give control of the canal zone to the Republic of<space/><link><target>Panama</target></link>.
