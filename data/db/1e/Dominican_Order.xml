Men of God were no longer expected to stay behind the walls of a cloister. Instead, they travelled among the people, taking as their examples the apostles of the primitive Church. Out of this ideal emerged two orders of mendicant friars: one, the Friars Minor, was led by<space/><link><target>Francis of Assisi</target></link>; the other, the Friars Preachers, by<space/><link><target>Dominic of Guzman</target></link>.

Dominic's new order was to be a<space/><link><target>preaching</target></link><space/>order, trained to preach in the<space/><link><target>vernacular</target></link><space/>languages. Rather than earning their living on vast farms as the monasteries had done, the new friars would survive by begging, &quot;selling&quot; themselves through persuasive preaching.</paragraph><paragraph>Dominic inspired his followers with loyalty to learning and virtue, a deep recognition of the spiritual power of worldly deprivation and the religious state, and a highly developed governmental structure.<extension extension_name='ref' name="ancdwq">Hinnebusch, The History of the Dominican Order, 7.</extension><space/>At the same time, Dominic inspired the members of his Order to develop a &quot;mixed&quot; spirituality. They were both active in preaching, and contemplative in study, prayer and meditation. The brethren of the Dominican Order were urban and learned, as well as contemplative and mystical in their spirituality. While these traits had an impact on the women of the Order, the nuns especially absorbed the latter characteristics and made those characteristics their own. In England, the Dominican nuns blended these elements with the defining characteristics of English Dominican spirituality and created a spirituality and collective personality that set them apart.</paragraph><paragraph>The Order's origins in battling heterodoxy influenced its later development and reputation.

Its purpose was revolutionary in the pastoral ministry of the Catholic Church. These priests were organized and well trained in religious studies. Dominic needed a frameworka ruleto organize these components. The Rule of St. Augustine was an obvious choice for the Dominican Order, according to Dominic's successor, Jordan of Saxony, because it lent itself to the &quot;salvation of souls through preaching&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref'>Hinnebusch, The History of the Dominican Order, 44.</extension><space/>By this choice, however, the Dominican brothers designated themselves not monks, but canons-regular.

The Dominican emphasis on learning and on charity distinguishes it from other monastic and mendicant orders. As the Order first developed on the European continent, learning continued to be emphasized by these friars and their sisters in Christ. These religious also struggled for a deeply personal, intimate relationship with God. When the Order reached England, many of these attributes were kept, but the English gave the Order additional, specialized characteristics. This topic is discussed below.<link><target>File:DominicanFriars.jpg</target><part>left</part><part>thumb</part><part>&quot;Dominican Friars for Life&quot; at the 2009<space/><link><target>March for Life (Washington, D.C.)</target><part>March for Life</part></link><space/>in<space/><link><target>Washington, DC</target></link></part></link></paragraph><paragraph>Dominic's search for a close relationship with God was determined and unceasing. He rarely spoke, so little of his interior life is known. What is known about it comes from accounts written by people near to him. St. Cecilia remembered him as cheerful, charitable and full of unceasing vigor. From a number of accounts, singing was apparently one of Dominic's great delights.<extension extension_name='ref'>Woods, 31-32.</extension><space/>Dominic practiced self-scourging and would mortify himself as he prayed alone in the chapel at night for 'poor sinners.'

Fundamentally, Dominic was &quot;...&amp;nbsp;a man of prayer who utilized the full resources of the learning available to him to preach, to teach, and even materially to assist those searching for the truth found in the gospel of Christ.

Humbert was a great lover of languages, and encouraged linguistic studies among the Dominicans, primarily Arabic, because of the missionary work friars were pursuing amongst those led astray or forced to convert by<space/><link><target>Muslims</target></link><space/>in the<space/><link><target>Middle East</target></link>.

His influence on the brotherhood permeated nearly every aspect of Dominican life. Albert was a scientist, philosopher, astrologer, theologian, spiritual writer, ecumenist, and diplomat. Under the auspices of Humbert of Romans, Albert molded the curriculum of studies for all Dominican students, introduced Aristotle to the classroom and probed the work of<space/><link><target>Neoplatonists</target></link>, such as<space/><link><target>Plotinus</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'>Woods, 38.</extension><space/>Indeed, it was the thirty years of work done by<space/><link><target>Thomas Aquinas</target></link><space/>and himself (12451274) that allowed for the inclusion of Aristotelian study in the curriculum of Dominican schools.<extension extension_name='ref'>Bennett, 66.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>One of Albert's greatest contributions was his study of<space/><link><target>Dionysus the Areopagite</target></link>, a mystical theologian whose words left an indelible imprint in the medieval period.

Thus, it is easier to state what God is not, than to state what God is:&quot;...&amp;nbsp;we affirm things of God only relatively, that is, casually, whereas we deny things of God absolutely, that is, with reference to what He is in Himself.

According to him, these are the tools that God uses to commune with a contemplative. Love in the soul is both the cause and result of true understanding and judgement. It causes not only an intellectual knowledge of God, but a spiritual and emotional knowledge as well. Contemplation is the means whereby one can obtain this goal of understanding. Things that once seemed static and unchanging become full of possibility and perfection. The contemplative then knows that God is, but she does not know what God is. Thus, contemplation forever produces a mystified, imperfect knowledge of God. The soul is exalted beyond the rest of God's creation but it cannot see God Himself.<extension extension_name='ref'>Hinnebusch, History of the Dominican Order, 299.

Meekness and charity guide Christians to acknowledge that they are nothing without the One (God/Christ) who created them, sustains them, and guides them. Thus, man then directs his path to that One, and the love for, and of, Christ guides man's very nature to become centered on the One, and on his neighbor as well.<extension extension_name='ref'>Ross, 169.</extension><space/>Charity is the manifestation of the pure love of Christ, both for and by His follower.</paragraph><paragraph>Although the ultimate attainment for this type of mysticism is union with God, it is not necessarily visionary, nor does it hope only for ecstatic experiences; instead, mystical life is successful if it is imbued with charity. The goal is just as much to become like Christ as it is to become one with Him.<extension extension_name='ref' name="vlctla"></extension><space/>Those who believe in Christ should first have faith in Him without becoming engaged in such overwhelming phenomena.</paragraph><paragraph>The Dominican Order was affected by a number of elemental influences. Its early members imbued the order with a mysticism and learning. The Europeans of the Order embraced ecstatic mysticism on a grand scale and looked to a union with the Creator. The English Dominicans looked for this complete unity as well, but were not so focused on ecstatic experiences. Instead, their goal was to emulate the moral life of Christ more completely. The Dartford nuns were surrounded by all of these legacies, and used them to create something unique. Though they are not called mystics, they are known for their piety toward God and their determination to live lives devoted to, and in emulation of, Him.</paragraph><paragraph>Dartford Priory was established long after the primary period of monastic foundation in England had ended.

Even on the eve of the Dissolution, Prioress Jane Vane wrote to Cromwell on behalf of a postulant, saying that though she had not actually been professed, she was professed in her heart and in the eyes of God.

This was also part of his legacy.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Although Albertus Magnus did much to instill mysticism in the Order of Preachers, it is a concept that reaches back to the Hebrew Bible. In the tradition of Holy Writ, the impossibility of coming face to face with God is a recurring motif, thus the commandment against graven images (Exodus 20.4-5). As time passed, Jewish and early Christian writings presented the idea of 'unknowing,' where God's presence was enveloped in a dark cloud. These images arose out of a confusing mass of ambiguous and ambivalent statements regarding the nature of God and man's relationship to Him.<extension extension_name='ref'>Woods, 45-47.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Other passages attest to the opposite circumstance: that of seeing God and talking with Him. Obviously, the conflict between seeing and not-seeing exists in early texts as well as later ones. It also permeates the Law, the Prophets, and the Writings. The consequence is a paradox that emerges repeatedly throughout Christian Scripture and the mysticism found in the early foundations of the Church.<extension extension_name='ref'>Woods, 48.</extension><link><target>File:St Catherine.

In Europe, in fact, it was often the female members of the Order, such as<space/><link><target>Catherine of Siena</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Mechthild of Magdeburg</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Christine of Stommeln</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Margaret Ebner</target></link>, and Elsbet Stagl,<extension extension_name='ref'>Woods, 110.</extension><space/>that gained reputations for having mystical experiences.

In spite of these doubts, women's houses dotted the countryside throughout Europe. There were seventy-four Dominican female houses in Germany, forty-two in Italy, nine in France, eight in Spain, six in Bohemia, three in Hungary, and three in Poland.<extension extension_name='ref' name="vyknsb">Lee, Nunneries, Learning, and Spirituality, 13.</extension><space/>Many of the German religious houses that lodged women had been home to communities of women, such as<space/><link><target>Beguines</target></link>, that became Dominican once they were taught by the traveling preachers and put under the jurisdiction of the Dominican authoritative structure. A number of these houses became centers of study and mystical spirituality in the 14th century. There were one hundred and fifty-seven nunneries in the Order by 1358. In that year, the number lessened due to disasters like the Black Death.<extension extension_name='ref'>Lee, Nunneries, Learning, and Spirituality, 14.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>In places besides Germany, convents were founded as retreats from the world for women of the upper classes. These were original projects funded by wealthy patrons, including other women. Among these was Countess Margaret of Flanders who established the monastery of Lille, while Val-Duchesse at Oudergern near Brussels was built with the wealth of Adelaide of Burgundy, Duchess of Brabant (1262).<extension extension_name='ref'>Hinnebusch, History of the Dominican Order, 337.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Female houses differed from male Dominican houses in a lack of apostolic work for the women. Instead, the sisters chanted the<space/><link><target>Liturgy of the Hours</target><part>Divine Office</part></link><space/>and kept all the monastic observances.<extension extension_name='ref'>Lee, Nunneries, Learning, and Spirituality, 70-73.</extension><space/>Their lives were often much more strict than their brothers' lives. The sisters had no government of their own, but lived under the authority of the general and provincial chapters of the Order. They were compelled to obey all the rules and shared in all the applicable privileges of the Order. Like the<space/><link><target>Priory of Dartford</target></link>, all Dominican nunneries were under the jurisdiction of friars. The friars served as their confessors, priests, teachers and spiritual mentors.<extension extension_name='ref'>Hinnebsch, History of the Domiican Order, 382</extension><link><target>File:Meczennicy Sandomierscy.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Dominican martyrs killed by Mongols during the<space/><link><target>second Mongol invasion of Poland</target></link><space/>in 1260.</part></link>Women could not be professed to the Dominican religious life before the age of thirteen. The formula for profession contained in the<space/><link><target>Constitutions of Montargis Priory</target></link><space/>(1250) demands that nuns pledge obedience to God, the Blessed Virgin, their prioress and her successors according to the Rule of St. Augustine and the institute of the Order, until death. The clothing of the sisters consisted of a white tunic and scapular, a leather belt, a black mantle, and a black veil. Candidates to profession were tested to reveal whether they were actually married women who had merely separated from their husbands. Their intellectual abilities were also tested. Nuns were to be silent in places of prayer, the cloister, the dormitory, and refectory. Silence was maintained unless the prioress granted an exception for a specific cause. Speaking was allowed in the common parlor, but it was subordinate to strict rules, and the prioress, subprioress or other senior nun had to be present.<extension extension_name='ref'>Lee, Nunneries, Learning, and Spirituality, 30.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Because the nuns of the Order did not preach among the people, the need to engage in study was not as immediate or intense as it was for men. They did participate, however, in a number of intellectual activities.<extension extension_name='ref'>Lee, Nunneries, Learning, and Spirituality, 31.</extension><space/>Along with sewing and embroidery, nuns often engaged in reading and discussing correspondence from Church leaders. In the Strassburg monastery of St. Margaret, some of the nuns could converse fluently in Latin. Learning still had an elevated place in the lives of these religious. In fact, Margarette Reglerin, a daughter of a wealthy Nuremberg family, was dismissed from a convent because she did not have the ability or will to learn.<extension extension_name='ref'>Hinnebusch, History of the Dominican Order, 384</extension></paragraph><paragraph>As heirs of the Dominican priory of Poissy in France, the Dartford sisters were also heirs to a tradition of profound learning and piety. Sections of translations of spiritual writings in Dartford's library, such as Suso's<space/><italics>Little Book of Eternal Wisdom</italics><space/>and Laurent du Bois'<space/><italics>Somme le Roi</italics>, show that the &quot;ghoostli&quot; link to Europe was not lost in the crossing of the Channel. It survived in the minds of the nuns. Also, the nuns shared a unique identity with Poissy as a religious house founded by a royal house. The English nuns were proud of this heritage, and aware that many of them shared in England's great history as members of the noble class, as seen in the next chapter.</paragraph><paragraph>Devotion to the Virgin Mary was another very important aspect of Dominican spirituality, especially for female members. As an Order, the Dominicans believed that they were established through the good graces of Christ's mother, and through prayers she sent missionaries to save the souls of nonbelievers.<extension extension_name='ref' name="pxxovl">Lee, Nunneries, Learning, and Spirituality, 152.</extension><space/>All Dominicans sang the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin each day and saluted her as their advocate.<extension extension_name='ref' name="pxxovl"></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>English Province</heading><paragraph>In<space/><link><target>England</target></link>, the Dominican Province began at the second general chapter of the Dominican Order in Bologna during the spring of 1221. Dominic dispatched twelve friars to England under the guidance of their English prior, Gilbert of Fresney. They landed in Dover on August 5, 1221. The province officially came into being at its first provincial chapter in 1230.<extension extension_name='ref'>William Hinnebusch.

It was also, however, a group of Englishmen. Its direct supervisors were from England, and the members of the English Province dwelt and labored in English cities, towns, villages, and roadways. English and European ingredients constantly came in contact. The international side of the province's existence influenced the national, and the national responded to, adapted, and sometimes constrained the international.<extension extension_name='ref'>William Hinnebusch.

Much of the information available is taken from visitation records.<extension extension_name='ref'>Maura O'Carroll, &quot;The Educational Organisation of the Dominicans in England and Wales 12211348: A Multidisciplinary Approach,&quot; Archivum Fratrum Praedicatorum 50 (1980): 32.</extension><space/>The &quot;visitation&quot; was a section of the province through which visitors to each priory could describe the state of its religious life and its studies to the next chapter. There were four such visits in England and WalesOxford, London, Cambridge and York.<extension extension_name='ref'>O'Carroll,33</extension><space/>All Dominican students were required to learn grammar, old and new logic, natural philosophy and theology. Of all of the curricular areas, however, theology was the most important. This is not surprising when one remembers Dominic's zeal for it.<extension extension_name='ref'>O'Carroll,57.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>English Dominican mysticism in the late medieval period differed from European strands of it in that, whereas European Dominican mysticism tended to concentrate on ecstatic experiences of union with the divine, English Dominican mysticism's ultimate focus was on a crucial dynamic in one's personal relationship with God. This was an essential moral imitation of the Savior as an ideal for religious change, and as the means for reformation of humanity's nature as an image of divinity. This type of mysticism carried with it four elements. First, spiritually it emulated the moral essence of Christ's life. Second, there was a connection linking moral emulation of Christ's life and humanity's disposition as images of the divine. Third, English Dominican mysticism focused on an embodied spirituality with a structured love of fellow men at its center. Finally, the supreme aspiration of this mysticism was either an ethical or an actual union with God.<extension extension_name='ref'>Ross, 160</extension></paragraph><paragraph>For English Dominican mystics, the mystical experience was not expressed just in one moment of the full knowledge of God, but in the journey of, or process of, faith. This then led to an understanding that was directed toward an experiential knowledge of divinity. It is important to understand, however, that for these mystics it was possible to pursue mystical life without the visions and voices that are usually associated with such a relationship with God.<extension extension_name='ref' name="vlctla"></extension><space/>They experienced a mystical process that allowed them, in the end, to experience what they had already gained knowledge of through their faith only.<extension extension_name='ref'>Ross, 163</extension></paragraph><paragraph>The center of all mystical experience is, of course, Christ. English Dominicans sought to gain a full knowledge of Christ through an imitation of His life. English mystics of all types tended to focus on the moral values that the events in Christ's life exemplified. This led to a &quot;progressive understanding of the meanings of Scripture--literal, moral, allegorical, and anagogical&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="jqmjge">Ross, 164</extension>that was contained within the mystical journey itself. From these considerations of Scripture comes the simplest way to imitate Christ: an emulation of the moral actions and attitudes that Jesus demonstrated in His earthly ministry becomes the most significant way to feel and have knowledge of God.<extension extension_name='ref' name="jqmjge"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The English concentrated on the spirit of the events of Christ's life, not the literality of events. They neither expected nor sought the appearance of the stigmata<extension extension_name='ref'>The appearance of<space/><link><target>Francis of Assisi</target><part>St. Francis</part></link>'s and<space/><link><target>Catherine of Siena</target></link>'s<space/><link><target>stigmata</target></link><space/>is well known.</extension><space/>or any other physical manifestation. They wanted to create in themselves that environment that allowed Jesus to fulfill His divine mission, insofar as they were able. At the center of this environment was love: the love that Christ showed for humanity in becoming human. Christ's love reveals the mercy of God and His care for His creation. English Dominican mystics sought through this love to become images of God. Love led to spiritual growth that, in turn, reflected an increase in love for God and humanity. This increase in universal love allowed men's wills to conform to God's will, just as Christ's will submitted to the Father's will.<extension extension_name='ref'>Clark, 83</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Concerning humanity as the image of Christ, English Dominican spirituality concentrated on the moral implications of image-bearing rather than the philosophical foundations of the<space/><link><target>imago Dei</target></link>. The process of Christ's life, and the process of image-bearing, amends humanity to God's image.<extension extension_name='ref'>Clark, 90-98. See also, Ross, 165</extension><space/>The idea of the &quot;image of God&quot; demonstrates both the ability of man to move toward God (as partakers in Christ's redeeming sacrifice), and that, on some level, man is always an image of God. As their love and knowledge of God grows and is sanctified by faith and experience, the image of God within man becomes ever more bright and clear.<extension extension_name='ref'>Ross,
