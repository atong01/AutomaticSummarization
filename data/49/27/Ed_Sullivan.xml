In November 1963, while in Heathrow Airport, Sullivan witnessed Beatlemania as the band returned from Sweden. At first he was reluctant to book the Beatles because the band didn't have a single released in the US at the time. But at the behest of a friend, legendary impresario<space/><link><target>Sid Bernstein</target></link>, Sullivan signed the group.

Later, when the band was slow to respond to a summons to the rehearsal stage, Sullivan commented, &quot;I guess the Crickets are not too excited to be on The Ed Sullivan Show.&quot; Holly, still annoyed by Sullivan's attitude, replied, &quot;I hope they're damn more excited than I am.&quot; Sullivan retaliated by cutting them from two numbers to one, then mispronounced Holly's name during the introduction. He also saw to it that Holly's guitar amplifier was turned off. Nevertheless, the band was received so well that Sullivan was forced to invite them back; Holly responded that Sullivan did not have enough money. Archival photographs taken during the appearance show Holly smirking and ignoring a visibly angry Sullivan.<extension extension_name='ref'>Moore, Gary (2011).<space/><italics>Hey Buddy: In Pursuit of Buddy Holly, My New Buddy John, and My Lost Decade of Music</italics>.
