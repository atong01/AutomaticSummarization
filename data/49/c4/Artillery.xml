Early artillery development focused on the ability to breach<space/><link><target>fortification</target><trail>s</trail></link>, and led to heavy, fairly immobile<space/><link><target>siege engine</target><trail>s</trail></link>. As technology improved, lighter, more mobile<space/><link><target>field artillery</target></link><space/>developed for battlefield use. This development continues today; modern<space/><link><target>self-propelled artillery</target></link><space/>vehicles are highly mobile weapons of great versatility providing the largest share of an army's total<space/><link><target>firepower</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>In its earliest sense, the word artillery referred to any group of soldiers primarily armed with some form of manufactured weapon or armour. Since the introduction of gunpowder and<space/><link><target>cannon</target></link>, the word &quot;artillery&quot; has largely meant cannon, and in contemporary usage, it usually refers to<space/><link><target>Explosive shell</target><part>shell</part></link>-firing guns,<space/><link><target>howitzer</target><trail>s</trail></link>,<space/><link><target>Mortar (weapon)</target><part>mortars</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Rocket artillery</target><part>rockets</part></link><space/>and guided missiles. In common speech, the word artillery is often used to refer to individual devices, along with their accessories and fittings, although these assemblages are more properly called &quot;equipments&quot;. However, there is no generally recognised generic term for a gun,<space/><link><target>howitzer</target></link>, mortar, and so forth: the United States uses &quot;artillery piece&quot;, but most English-speaking armies use &quot;gun&quot; and &quot;mortar&quot;. The projectiles fired are typically either &quot;shot&quot; (if solid) or &quot;shell&quot; (if not). &quot;Shell&quot; is a widely used generic term for a projectile, which is a component of<space/><link><target>ammunition</target><part>munitions</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>By association, artillery may also refer to the<space/><link><target>Combat Arms</target><part>arm of service</part></link><space/>that customarily operates such engines. In some armies one arm has operated field, coast, anti-aircraft artillery and some anti-tank artillery, in others these have been separate arms and in some nations coast has been a naval or marine responsibility. In the 20th Century technology based target acquisition devices, such as radar, and systems, such as sound ranging and flash spotting, emerged to acquire targets, primarily for artillery. These are usually operated by one or more of the artillery arms. The widespread adoption of indirect fire in the early 20th Century introduced the need for specialist data for field artillery, notably survey and meteorological, in some armies provision of these are the responsibility of the artillery arm.</paragraph><paragraph>Artillery originated for use against ground targetsagainst infantry, cavalry and other artillery. An early specialist development was coast artillery for use against enemy ships. The early 20th Century saw the development of a new class of artillery for use against aircraft.</paragraph><paragraph>Artillery is arguably the most lethal form of land-based armament currently employed, and has been since at least the early<space/><link><target>Industrial Revolution</target></link>.

Until the introduction of<space/><link><target>gunpowder</target></link><space/>into western warfare, artillery depended upon mechanical energy to operate, and this severely limited the kinetic energy of the projectiles, while also requiring the construction of very large apparatus to store sufficient energy. For comparison, a Roman 1st-century BC<space/><link><target>catapult</target></link><space/>using stones of 6.55&amp;nbsp;kg fired with a kinetic energy of 16,000 joules, while a mid-19th-century<space/><link><target>12-pounder gun</target></link><space/>firing projectiles of 4.1&amp;nbsp;kg fired the projectile with a kinetic energy of 240,000 joules.</paragraph><paragraph>From the<space/><link><target>Middle Ages</target></link><space/>through most of the<space/><link><target>modern era</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Cannon</target><part>artillery pieces</part></link><space/>on land were moved by<space/><link><target>Horse-drawn vehicle</target><part>horse-drawn</part></link><space/><link><target>gun carriage</target><trail>s</trail></link>.

Artillery used by naval forces has changed significantly also, with<space/><link><target>missile</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>replacing guns in<space/><link><target>surface warfare</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Over the course of military history, projectiles were manufactured from a wide variety of materials, made in a wide variety of shapes, and used different means of inflicting physical damage and<space/><link><target>Casualty (person)</target><part>casualties</part></link><space/>to defeat specific types of<space/><link><target>Targeting (warfare)</target><part>targets</part></link>. The engineering designs of the means of delivery have likewise changed significantly over time, and have become some of the most complex technological application today.</paragraph><paragraph>In some armies, the weapon of artillery is the projectile, not the equipment that fires it. The process of delivering fire onto the target is called gunnery. The actions involved in operating the piece are collectively called &quot;serving the gun&quot; by the &quot;detachment&quot; or gun crew, constituting either direct or indirect artillery fire. The manner in which artillery units or formations are employed is called artillery support, and may at different periods in history refer to weapons designed to be fired from ground-, sea-, and even air-based<space/><link><target>weapons platform</target><trail>s</trail></link>.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Crew</heading><paragraph>The term &quot;<link><target>Crew-served weapon</target><part>gunner</part></link>&quot; is used in some armed forces for the<space/><link><target>soldier</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>sailor</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>with the primary function of using artillery.<space/><link><target>Image:M777 Light Towed Howitzer 1.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>7-person gun crew firing a US<space/><link><target>M777 howitzer</target><part>M777 Light Towed Howitzer</part></link>,<space/><link><target>War in Afghanistan (2001present)</target><part>War in Afghanistan</part></link>, 2009.</part></link>The gunners and their guns are usually grouped in teams called either &quot;crews&quot; or &quot;detachments&quot;. Several such crews and teams with other functions are combined into a unit of artillery, usually called a<space/><link><target>Artillery battery</target><part>battery</part></link>, although sometimes called a company. In gun detachments, each role is numbered, starting with &quot;1&quot; the Detachment Commander, and the highest number being the Coverer, the second-in-command. &quot;Gunner&quot; is also the lowest rank and junior non-commissioned officers are &quot;Bombardiers&quot; in some artillery arms.</paragraph><paragraph>Batteries are roughly equivalent to a<space/><link><target>Company (military unit)</target><part>company</part></link><space/>in the infantry, and are combined into larger<space/><link><target>military organization</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>for administrative and operational purposes, either battalions or regiments, depending on the army.

Broadly, these effects fall into two categories, either to suppress or neutralize the enemy, or to cause casualties, damage, and destruction. This is mostly achieved by delivering high-explosive munitions to suppress, or inflict casualties on the enemy from<space/><link><target>Penetrating trauma</target><part>casing fragments and other debris</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>blast injury</target><part>blast</part></link>, or by destroying enemy positions, equipment, and vehicles. Non-lethal munitions, notably smoke, can also be used to suppress or neutralize the enemy by obscuring their view.</paragraph><paragraph>Fire may be directed by an<space/><link><target>artillery observer</target></link><space/>or other observer, including manned and unmanned aircraft pilots, or called onto<space/><link><target>Geographic coordinate system</target><part>map coordinates</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Military doctrine</target></link><space/>has played a significant influence on the core<space/><link><target>Engineering design process</target><part>engineering design</part></link><space/>considerations of artillery ordnance through its history, in seeking to achieve a balance between delivered volume of fire with ordnance mobility. However, during the modern period, the consideration of protecting the gunners also arose due to the late-19th-century introduction of the new generation of infantry weapons using<space/><link><target>Cylindro-conoidal bullet</target><part>conoidal bullet</part></link>, better known as the<space/><link><target>Mini ball</target></link>, with a range almost as long as that of field artillery.</paragraph><paragraph>The gunners' increasing proximity to and participation in direct combat against other combat arms and attacks by aircraft made the introduction of a gun shield necessary. The problems of how to employ a fixed or horse-towed gun in mobile warfare necessitated the development of new methods of transporting the artillery into combat. Two distinct forms of artillery developed: the towed gun, which was used primarily to attack or defend a fixed line; and the self-propelled gun, which was designed to accompany a mobile force and provide continuous fire support. These influences have guided the development of artillery ordnance, systems, organisations, and operations until the present, with artillery systems capable of providing support at ranges from as little as 100&amp;nbsp;m to the intercontinental ranges of<space/><link><target>ballistic missile</target><trail>s</trail></link>.

Indirect fire was the defining characteristic of 20th-century artillery and led to undreamt of changes in the amount of artillery, its tactics, organisation, and techniques, most of which occurred during World War I.</paragraph><paragraph>An implication of indirect fire and improving guns was increasing range between gun and target, this increased the time of flight and the vertex of the trajectory. The result was decreasing accuracy (the increasing distance between the target and the mean point of impact of the shells aimed at it) caused by the increasing effects of non-standard conditions. Indirect firing data was based on standard conditions including a specific muzzle velocity, zero wind, air temperature and density, and propellant temperature. In practice, this standard combination of conditions almost never existed, they varied throughout the day and day to day, and the greater the time of flight, the greater the inaccuracy. An added complication was the need for survey to accurately fix the coordinates of the gun position and provide accurate orientation for the guns. Of course, targets had to be accurately located, but by 1916, air photo interpretation techniques enabled this, and ground survey techniques could sometimes be used.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1914, the methods of correcting firing data for the actual conditions were often convoluted, and the availability of data about actual conditions was rudimentary or non-existent, the assumption was that fire would always be ranged (adjusted). British heavy artillery worked energetically to progressively solve all these problems from late 1914 onwards, and by early 1918, had effective processes in place for both field and heavy artillery. These processes enabled 'map-shooting', later called 'predicted fire'; it meant that effective fire could be delivered against an accurately located target without ranging. Nevertheless, the mean point of impact was still some tens of yards from the target-centre aiming point. It was not precision fire, but it was good enough for concentrations and barrages. These processes remain in use into the 21st Century with refinements to calculations enabled by computers and improved data capture about non-standard conditions.</paragraph><paragraph>The British<space/><link><target>major-general</target></link><space/><link><target>Henry Hugh Tudor</target></link><space/>pioneered armour and artillery cooperation at the breakthrough<space/><link><target>Battle of Cambrai (1917)</target><part>Battle of Cambrai</part></link>.

Indirect fire emerged at the beginning of the 20th century and was greatly enhanced by the development of<space/><link><target>predicted fire</target></link><space/>methods in World War I. However, indirect fire was area fire; it was and is not suitable for destroying point targets; its primary purpose is area suppression. Nevertheless, by the late 1970s precision munitions started to appear, notably the US 155mm Copperhead and its Soviet 152mm equivalent that had success in Indian service. These relied on laser designation to 'illuminate' the target that the shell homed onto. However, in the early 21st Century, the Global Positioning System (GPS) enabled relatively cheap and accurate guidance for shells and missiles, notably the US 155mm Excalibur and the 227mm GMLRS rocket. The introduction of these led to a new issue, the need for very accurate three dimensional target coordinates the mensuration process.</paragraph><paragraph>Weapons covered by the term 'modern artillery' include &quot;<link><target>cannon</target></link>&quot; artillery (such as<space/><link><target>howitzer</target></link>,<space/><link><target>mortar (weapon)</target><part>mortar</part></link>, and<space/><link><target>field gun</target></link>) and<space/><link><target>rocket artillery</target></link>.

However, base fuzes have been used with armour piercing shells and for squash head (HESH or HEP) anti-tank shells. At least one nuclear shell and its non-nuclear spotting version also used a multi-deck mechanical time fuze fitted into its base.</paragraph><paragraph>Impact fuzes were, and in some armies remain, the standard fuze for HE projectiles. Their default action is normally 'superquick', some have had a 'graze' action which allows them to penetrate light cover and others have 'delay'. Delay fuzes allow the shell to penetrate the ground before exploding. Armor- or concrete-piercing fuzes are specially hardened. During World War I and later, ricochet fire with delay or graze fuzed HE shells, fired with a flat angle of descent, was used to achieve airburst.</paragraph><paragraph>HE shells can be fitted with other fuzes. Airburst fuzes usually have a combined airburst and impact function. However, until the introduction of<space/><link><target>proximity fuze</target><trail>s</trail></link>, the airburst function was mostly used with cargo munitionsfor example, shrapnel, illumination, and smoke. The larger calibers of<space/><link><target>anti-aircraft</target></link><space/>artillery are almost always used airburst. Airburst fuzes have to have the fuze length (running time) set on them. This is done just before firing using either a wrench or a fuze setter pre-set to the required fuze length.</paragraph><paragraph>Early airburst fuzes used igniferous timers which lasted into the second half of the 20th century. Mechanical time fuzes appeared in the early part of the century. These required a means of powering them. The Thiel mechanism used a spring and escapement (i.e. 'clockwork'), Junghans used<space/><link><target>centrifugal force</target></link><space/>and gears, and Dixi used centrifugal force and balls. From about 1980, electronic time fuzes started replacing mechanical ones for use with cargo munitions.</paragraph><paragraph>Proximity fuzes have been of two types: photo-electric or radar. The former was not very successful and seems only to have been used with British<space/><link><target>anti-aircraft artillery</target></link><space/>'unrotated projectiles' (rockets) in World War II. Radar proximity fuzes were a big improvement over the mechanical (time) fuzes which they replaced. Mechanical time fuzes required an accurate calculation of their running time, which was affected by non-standard conditions. With HE (requiring a burst 20 to<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>30</arg><arg>ft</arg><arg>m</arg></template><space/>above the ground), if this was very slightly wrong the rounds would either hit the ground or burst too high. Accurate running time was less important with cargo munitions that burst much higher.</paragraph><paragraph>The first<space/><link><target>Proximity fuze</target><part>radar proximity fuzes</part></link><space/>(codenamed 'VT') were initially used against aircraft in World War II. Their ground use was delayed for fear of the enemy recovering 'blinds' (artillery shells which failed to detonate) and copying the fuze. The first proximity fuzes were designed to detonate about<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>30</arg><arg>ft</arg><arg>m</arg></template><space/>above the ground. These air-bursts are much more lethal against personnel than ground bursts because they deliver a greater proportion of useful fragments and deliver them into terrain where a prone soldier would be protected from ground bursts.</paragraph><paragraph>However, proximity fuzes can suffer premature detonation because of the moisture in heavy rain clouds. This led to 'controlled variable time' (CVT) after World War II. These fuzes have a mechanical timer that switched on the radar about 5 seconds before expected impact, they also detonated on impact.</paragraph><paragraph>The proximity fuze emerged on the battlefields of Europe in late December 1944.

Using solid-state electronics they were relatively cheap and reliable, and became the standard fitted fuze in operational ammunition stocks in some western armies. The early versions were often limited to proximity airburst, albeit with height of burst options, and impact. Some offered a go/no-go functional test through the fuze setter.</paragraph><paragraph>Later versions introduced induction fuze setting and testing instead of physically placing a fuze setter on the fuze. The latest, such as Junghan's DM84U provide options giving, superquick, delay, a choice of proximity heights of burst, time and a choice of foliage penetration depths.</paragraph><paragraph>A new type of artillery fuze will appear soon.

The shell is accelerated to a high velocity in a very short time by the rapid generation of gas from the burning propellant. This high pressure is achieved by burning the propellant in a contained area, either the chamber of a gun barrel or the combustion chamber of a rocket motor.</paragraph><paragraph>Until the late 19th century, the only available propellant was<space/><link><target>black powder</target></link>. Black powder had many disadvantages as a propellant; it has relatively low power, requiring large amounts of powder to fire projectiles, and created thick clouds of white smoke that would obscure the targets, betray the positions of guns, and make aiming impossible.

Early guncotton was unstable, however, and burned very fast and hot, leading to greatly increased barrel wear. Widespread introduction of smokeless powder would wait until the advent of the double-base powders, which combine nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin to produce powerful, smokeless, stable propellant.</paragraph><paragraph>Many other formulations were developed in the following decades, generally trying to find the optimum characteristics of a good artillery propellant; low temperature, high energy, non corrosive, highly stable, cheap, and easy to manufacture in large quantities.

Generally, anti-aircraft artillery and smaller-caliber (up to 3&quot; or 76.2&amp;nbsp;mm) guns use metal cartridge cases that include the round and propellant, similar to a modern rifle cartridge. This simplifies loading and is necessary for very high rates of fire. Bagged propellant allows the amount of powder to be raised or lowered, depending on the range to the target. It also makes handling of larger shells easier. Each requires a totally different type of breech to the other. A metal case holds an integral primer to initiate the propellant and provides the gas seal to prevent the gases leaking out of the breech; this is called obturation. With bagged charges, the breech itself provides obturation and holds the primer. In either case, the primer is usually percussion, but electrical is also used, and<space/><link><target>laser ignition</target></link><space/>is emerging.

Since the creation of modern indirect fire, different armies have done it differently at different times and in different places. Technology is often a factor, but so are militarysocial issues, the relationships between artillery and other arms, and the criteria by which military capability, efficiency, and effectiveness are judged. Cost is also an issue because artillery is expensive due to the large quantities of ammunition that it uses and its level of manpower.</paragraph><paragraph><bold>Communications</bold><space/>underpin the artillery system, they have to be reliable and in real-time to link the various elements. During the 20th century communications used flags, morse code by radio, line and lights, voice and<space/><link><target>teleprinter</target></link><space/>by line. Radio has included HF, VHF, satellite and radio relay as well as modern tactical trunk systems. In western armies at least radio communications are now usually encrypted.</paragraph><paragraph>The emergence of mobile and man-portable radios after World War I had a major impact on artillery because it enabled fast and mobile operations with observers accompanying the infantry or armoured troops. In World War II, some armies fitted their self-propelled guns with radios. However, sometimes in the first half of the 20th century, hardcopy artillery fire plans and map traces were distributed.</paragraph><paragraph>Data communications can be especially important for artillery because by using structured messages and defined data types fire control messages can be automatically routed and processed by computers. For example, a target acquisition element can send a message with target details which is automatically routed through the tactical and technical fire control elements to deliver firing data to the gun's laying system and the gun automatically laid. As tactical data networks become pervasive, they will provide any connected soldier with a means for reporting target information and requesting artillery fire.</paragraph><paragraph><bold>Command</bold><space/>is the authority to allocate resources, typically by assigning artillery formations or units. Terminology and its implications vary widely. However, very broadly, artillery units are assigned in direct support or in general support. Typically, the former mostly provide close support to manoeuvre units, while the latter may provide close support and or depth fire, notably counter-battery. Generally, 'direct support' also means that the artillery unit provides artillery observation and liaison teams to the supported units. Sometimes, direct support units are placed under command of the regiment/brigade they support. General support units may be grouped into artillery formations; for example, brigades, even divisions, or multi-battalion regiments, and usually under command of division, corps, or higher HQs. General support units tend to be moved to where they are most required at any particular time. Artillery command may impose priorities and constraints to support their combined arms commander's plans.</paragraph><paragraph><bold>Target acquisition</bold><space/>can take many forms, it is usually observation in real time, but may be the product of analysis. Artillery observation teams are the most common means of target acquisition. However, air observers have been use since the beginning of indirect fire and were quickly joined by air photography. Target acquisition may also be by anyone that can get the information into the artillery system. Targets may be visible to forward troops or in depth and invisible to them.</paragraph><paragraph>Observation equipment can vary widely in its complexity.</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>Unmanned air vehicles are the latest form of air observation, having been first introduced in the early 1960s.</listitem><listitem>The equipment available to observation teams has progressed from just prismatic compass, hand-held or tripod mounted binoculars and sometimes optical range-finders.</listitem><listitem>Special equipment for locating hostile artillery: flash spotting and notably<space/><link><target>sound ranging</target></link><space/>appeared in World War I the latter has been undergone increasing refinement as technology has improved.

This is vital when a target is within range of many fire units and the number of fire units needed depends on the nature of the target, and the circumstances and purpose of its engagement. Targeting is concerned with selecting the right weapons in the right quantities to achieve the required effects on the target. Allotment attempts to address the artillery dilemmaimportant targets are rarely urgent and urgent targets are rarely important. Of course importance is a matter of perspective; what is important to a divisional commander is rarely the same as what is important to an infantry platoon commander.<link><target>File:August 1984 - captured field guns in Jaji, Paktia.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Afghans with two captured artillery field guns in Jaji, 1984.</part></link>Broadly, there are two situations: fire against opportunity targets, and targets whose engagement is planned as part of a particular operation. In the latter situation, command assigns fire units to the operation and an overall artillery fire planner makes a plan, possibly delegating resources for some parts of it to other planners. Fire plans may also involve use of non-artillery assets, such as mortars and aircraft.</paragraph><paragraph>Control of fire against opportunity targets is an important differentiator between different types of artillery system. In some armies, only designated artillery HQs have the tactical fire control authority to order fire units to engage a target, all 'calls for fire' being requests to these HQs. This authority may also extend to deciding the type and quantity of ammunition to be used. In other armies, an 'authorised observer' (for example, artillery observation team or other target acquisition element) can order fire units to engage. In the latter case, a battery observation team can order fire to their own battery and may be authorised to order fire to their own battalion, and sometimes to many battalions. For example, a divisional artillery commander may authorise selected observers to order fire to the entire divisional artillery. When observers or cells are not authorised, they can still request fire.</paragraph><paragraph>Armies that apply forward tactical control generally put the majority of the more senior officers of artillery units forward in command observation posts or with the supported arm. Those that do not use this approach tend to put these officers close to the guns. In either case, the observation element usually controls fire in detail against the target, such as adjusting it onto the target, moving it, and coordinating it with the supported arm as necessary to achieve the required effects.</paragraph><paragraph><bold>Firing data</bold><space/>has to be calculated and is the key to indirect fire; the arrangements for this have varied widely. In the end, firing data has two components: quadrant elevation and<space/><link><target>azimuth</target></link>, to these may be added the size of propelling charge and the fuze setting. The process to produce firing data is sometimes called technical fire control. Before computers, some armies set the range on the gun's sights, which mechanically corrected it for the gun's muzzle velocity. For the first few decades of indirect fire, the firing data were often calculated by the observer, who then adjusted the fall of shot onto the target.</paragraph><paragraph>However, the need to engage targets at night, in depth, or hit the target with the first rounds quickly led to predicted fire being developed in World War I. Predicted fire existed alongside the older method. After World War II, predicted methods were invariably applied, but the fall of shot usually needed adjustment because of inaccuracy in locating the target, the proximity of friendly troops, or the need to engage a moving target. Target location errors were significantly reduced once laser rangefinders, orientation, and navigation devices were issued to observation parties.</paragraph><paragraph>In predicted fire, the basic geospatial data of range, angle of sight, and azimuth between a fire unit and its target was produced and corrected for variations from the 'standard conditions'. These variations included barrel wear, propellant temperature, different projectiles weights that all affected the muzzle velocity, and air temperature, density, wind speed &amp; direction, and rotation of the Earth that affect the shell in flight. The net effect of variations can also be determined by shooting at an accurately known point, a process called 'registration'.</paragraph><paragraph>All these calculations to produce a quadrant elevation (or range) and azimuth were done manually by highly trained soldiers using instruments, tabulated data, data of the moment, and approximations until battlefield computers started appearing in the 1960s and '70s. While some early calculators copied the manual method (typically substituting<space/><link><target>polynomials</target></link><space/>for tabulated data), computers use a different approach. They simulate a shell's trajectory by 'flying' it in short steps and applying data about the conditions affecting the trajectory at each step.

However, in the 1930s, the French moved it to battalion level and combined it with some tactical fire control. This was copied by the US. Nevertheless, most armies seemed to have retained it within firing batteries, and some duplicated the technical fire control teams in a battery to give operational resilience and tactical flexibility. Computers reduced the number of men needed and enabled decentralisation of technical fire control to autonomous sub-battery fire units, such as platoons, troops, or sections, although some armies had sometimes done this with their manual methods. Computation on the gun or launcher, integrated with their laying system, is also possible.<space/><link><target>MLRS</target></link><space/>led the way in this.<link><target>File:3rdMarineDivisionVietnam1968h.JPEG</target><part>thumb</part><part>Members of the<space/><link><target>3rd Marine Division (United States)</target><part>3rd Marine Division</part></link><space/>complete construction of M101 105 mm howitzer positions at a mountain-top<space/><link><target>fire support base</target></link>, Vietnam, 1968</part></link>A<space/><bold>fire unit</bold><space/>is the smallest artillery or mortar element, consisting of one or more weapon systems, capable of being employed to execute a fire assigned by a tactical fire controller. Generally it is a battery, but sub-divided batteries are quite common, and in some armies very common. On occasions a battery of 6 guns has been 6 fire units. Fire units may or may not occupy separate positions. Geographically dispersed fire units may or may not have an integral capability for technical fire control.</paragraph><paragraph><bold>Specialist services</bold><space/>provide data need for predicted fire. Increasingly, they are provided from within firing units. These services include:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>Survey: accurate fixation and orientation of the guns, historically this involved specialists within field artillery units and specialist units. In some armies mapping and amp supply has also been an artillery responsibility. Survey is also essential for some target acquisition devices. Traditional survey methods of measurement and calculation have been replaced by inertial orientation and navigators and GPS.</listitem><listitem>Meteorological data: historically these were usually divisional level specialist teams but advances in technology mean they are now increasingly part of artillery units.</listitem><listitem>Calibration: periodically establishing the &quot;normal&quot; muzzle velocity of each gun as it wears. Originally this involved special facilities and army level teams. Measurement using Doppler radar, introduced in the 1950s, started to simplify arrangements. Some armies now have a muzzle velocity measuring radar permanently fitted to every gun.</listitem></list><paragraph><bold>Logistic services</bold>, supply of artillery ammunition has always been a major component of military logistics. Up until World War I some armies made artillery responsible for all forward ammunition supply because the load of small arms ammunition was trivial compared to artillery. Different armies use different approaches to ammunition supply, which can vary with the nature of operations. Differences include where the logistic service transfers artillery ammunition to artillery, the amount of ammunition carried in units and extent to which stocks are held at unit or battery level. A key difference is whether supply is 'push' or 'pull'. In the former the 'pipeline' keeps pushing ammunition into formations or units at a defined rate. In the latter units fire as tactically necessary and replenish to maintain or reach their authorised holding (which can vary), so the logistic system has to be able to cope with surge and slack.</paragraph><paragraph>Artillery has always been equipment intensive and for centuries artillery provided its own artificers to maintain and repair their equipment. Most armies now place these services in specialist branches with specialist repair elements in batteries and units.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Classification of artillery</heading><paragraph>Artillery types can be categorised in several ways, for example by type or size of weapon or ordnance, by role or by organizational arrangements.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Types of ordnance</heading><paragraph>The types of cannon artillery are generally distinguished by the velocity at which they fire projectiles.Types of artillery:<link><target>File:PzH2000.Ger.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part><link><target>German Army</target></link><space/><link><target>PzH 2000</target></link><space/>self-propelled artillery</part></link><link><target>File:Boat U170 Skadovsk 2012 G1.jpg</target><part>thumbnail</part><part><link><target>Ukrainian Navy</target></link><space/>artillery boat ''Zhuk class'' U170 ''Skadovs'k''.<space/><link><target>Bay of Sevastopol</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Crimean Peninsula</target><part>Crimea</part></link>.</part></link></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Field artillery</target></link>: mobile weapons used to support armies in the field.

Naval artillery disappeared apart from that belonging to marines. However, two new branches of artillery emerged during that war and its aftermath, both used specialised guns (and a few rockets) and used direct not indirect fire, in the 1950s and 1960s both started to make extensive use of missiles:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>Anti-tank artillery, also under various organisational arrangements but typically either field artillery or a specialist branch and additional elements integral to infantry, etc., units. However, in most armies field and anti-aircraft artillery also had at least a secondary anti-tank role. After World War II anti-tank in Western armies became mostly the responsibility of infantry and armoured branches and ceased to be an artillery matter, with some exceptions.</listitem><listitem><link><target>Anti-aircraft artillery</target></link>, under various organisational arrangements including being part of artillery, a separate corps, even a separate service or being split between army for the field and airforce for home defence. In some cases infantry and the new armoured corps also operated their own integral light anti-aircraft artillery. Home defence anti-aircraft artillery often used fixed as well as mobile mountings. Some anti-aircraft guns could also be used as field or anti-tank artillery, providing they had suitable sights.</listitem></list><paragraph>However, the general switch by artillery to indirect fire before and during World War I led to a reaction in some armies. The result was accompanying or infantry guns. These were usually small, short range guns, that could be easily man-handled and used mostly for direct fire but some could use indirect fire. Some were operated by the artillery branch but under command of the supported unit. In World War II they were joined by self-propelled assault guns, although other armies adopted infantry or close support tanks in armoured branch units for the same purpose, subsequently tanks generally took on the accompanying role.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Equipment types</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Artillery gun crew-illustration.jpeg</target><part>right</part><part>thumb</part><part>Continental Artillery crew from the<space/><link><target>American Revolution</target></link><space/>handling a cannon.</part></link>The three main types of artillery &quot;gun&quot; are guns, howitzers and<space/><link><target>mortar (weapon)</target><part>mortars</part></link>. During the 20th century, guns and howitzers have steadily merged in artillery use, making a distinction between the terms somewhat meaningless. By the end of the 20th century, true guns with calibers larger than about 60&amp;nbsp;mm had become very rare in artillery use, the main users being tanks, ships, and a few residual anti-aircraft and coastal guns. The term &quot;cannon&quot; is a United States generic term that includes guns, howitzers and mortars; it is not used in other English speaking armies.</paragraph><paragraph>The traditional definitions differentiated between guns and howitzers in terms of maximum elevation (well less than 45 as opposed to close to or greater than 45), number of charges (one or more than one charge), and having higher or lower muzzle velocity, sometimes indicated by barrel length. These three criteria give eight possible combinations, of which guns and howitzers are but two. However, modern &quot;howitzers&quot; have higher velocities and longer barrels than the equivalent &quot;guns&quot; of the first half of the 20th century.</paragraph><paragraph>True guns are characterized by long range, having a maximum elevation significantly less than 45, a high muzzle velocity and hence a relatively long barrel, smooth bore (no rifling) and a single charge. The latter often led to fixed ammunition where the projectile is locked to the cartridge case. There is no generally accepted minimum muzzle velocity or barrel length associated with a gun.<space/><link><target>File:60 pounder Cape Helles June 1915.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>A British 60-pounder (<template><target>convert</target><arg>5</arg><arg>in</arg><arg>mm</arg><arg name="adj">on</arg></template>) gun at full recoil, in action during the<space/><link><target>Battle of Gallipoli</target></link>, 1915. Photo by<space/><link><target>Ernest Brooks (photographer)</target><part>Ernest Brooks</part></link>.</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>Howitzers can fire at maximum elevations at least close to 45; elevations up to about 70 are normal for modern howitzers. Howitzers also have a choice of charges, meaning that the same elevation angle of fire will achieve a different range depending on the charge used. They have rifled bores, lower muzzle velocities and shorter barrels than equivalent guns. All this means they can deliver fire with a steep angle of descent. Because of their multi-charge capability, their ammunition is mostly separate loading (the projectile and propellant are loaded separately).</paragraph><paragraph>That leaves six combinations of the three criteria, some of which have been termed<space/><link><target>gun howitzers</target></link>. A term first used in the 1930s when howitzers with a relatively high maximum muzzle velocities were introduced, it never became widely accepted, most armies electing to widen the definition of &quot;gun&quot; or &quot;howitzer&quot;. By the 1960s, most equipments had maximum elevations up to about 70, were multi-charge, had quite high maximum muzzle velocities and relatively long barrels.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>mortar (weapon)</target><part>Mortars</part></link><space/>are simpler. The modern mortar originated in World War I and there were several patterns. After that war, most mortars settled on the Stokes pattern, characterized by a short barrel, smooth bore, low muzzle velocity, elevation angle of firing generally greater than 45, and a very simple and light mounting using a &quot;baseplate&quot; on the ground. The projectile with its integral propelling charge was dropped down the barrel from the muzzle to hit a fixed firing pin. Since that time, a few mortars have become rifled and adopted breech loading.</paragraph><paragraph>There are other recognized typifying characteristics for artillery. One such characteristic is the type of obturation used to seal the chamber and prevent gases escaping through the breech. This may use a metal cartridge case that also holds the propelling charge, a configuration called &quot;QF&quot; or &quot;quickfiring&quot; by some nations. The alternative does not use a metal cartridge case, the propellant being merely bagged or in combustible cases with the breech itself providing all the sealing. This is called &quot;BL&quot; or &quot;breech loading&quot; by some nations.</paragraph><paragraph>A second characteristic is the form of propulsion. Modern equipment can either be towed or self-propelled (SP). A towed gun fires from the ground and any inherent protection is limited to a gun shield. Towing by horse teams lasted throughout World War II in some armies, but others were fully mechanized with wheeled or tracked gun towing vehicles by the outbreak of that war. The size of a towing vehicle depends on the weight of the equipment and the amount of ammunition it has to carry.</paragraph><paragraph>A variation of towed is portee, where the vehicle carries the gun which is dismounted for firing. Mortars are often carried this way. A mortar is sometimes carried in an armored vehicle and can either fire from it or be dismounted to fire from the ground. Since the early 1960s it has been possible to carry lighter towed guns and most mortars by helicopter. Even before that, they were parachuted or landed by glider from the time of the first airborne trials in the USSR in the 1930s.</paragraph><paragraph>In an SP equipment, the gun is an integral part of the vehicle that carries it. SPs first appeared during World War I, but did not really develop until World War II. They are mostly tracked vehicles, but wheeled SPs started to appear in the 1970s. Some SPs have no armor and carry little or no ammunition. Armoured SPs usually carry a useful ammunition load. Early armoured SPs were mostly a &quot;casemate&quot; configuration, in essence an open top armored box offering only limited traverse. However, most modern armored SPs have a full enclosed armored turret, usually giving full traverse for the gun. Many SPs cannot fire without deploying stabilizers or spades, sometimes hydraulic. A few SPs are designed so that the recoil forces of the gun are transferred directly onto the ground through a baseplate. A few towed guns have been given limited self-propulsion by means of an auxiliary engine.</paragraph><paragraph>Two other forms of tactical propulsion were used in the first half of the 20th century: Railways or transporting the equipment by road, as two or three separate loads, with disassembly and re-assembly at the beginning and end of the journey.<space/><link><target>Railway gun</target><part>Railway artillery</part></link><space/>took two forms, railway mountings for heavy and super-heavy guns and howitzers and armored trains as &quot;fighting vehicles&quot; armed with light artillery in a direct fire role. Disassembled transport was also used with heavy and super heavy weapons and lasted into the 1950s.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Caliber categories</heading><paragraph>A third form of artillery typing is to classify it as &quot;light&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;, &quot;heavy&quot; and various other terms. It appears to have been introduced in World War I, which spawned a very wide array of artillery in all sorts of sizes so a simple categorical system was needed. Some armies defined these categories by bands of calibers. Different bands were used for different types of weaponsfield guns, mortars, anti-aircraft guns and coast guns.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Modern operations</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:DD-SD-00-00118.JPEG</target><part>thumb</part><part>Two French Army Giat<space/><link><target>GCT 155mm</target></link><space/>(155mm AUF1) Self-propelled Guns, 40th Regiment d' Artillerie, with IFOR markings are parked at Hekon base, near Mostar, Bosnia-Herzegovina, in support of Operation Joint Endeavor.</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>List of countries in order of amount of artillery:<extension extension_name='ref'>Hackett, James, (ed.),<space/><italics>The Military Balance 2010</italics>, The International Institute for Strategic Studies, 2010; Note: Only conventional tube ordnance is given, in use with land forces</extension></paragraph><list type='numbered'><listitem>Russia - 26,121<extension extension_name='ref'>Hackett, James, (ed.),<space/><italics>The Military Balance 2010</italics>, The International Institute for Strategic Studies, 2010, p.223; Note: the number given is for Land Forces only.

It requires consideration of the type of fire support required and the extent of coordination with the supported arm. It involves decisions about:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>what effects are required, for example,<space/><italics>neutralization</italics><space/>or<space/><italics>suppression</italics>;</listitem><listitem>the proximity of and risks to own troops or non-combatants;</listitem><listitem>what types of munitions, including their fuzing, are to be used and in what quantities;</listitem><listitem>when the targets should be attacked and possibly for how long;</listitem><listitem>what methods should be used, for example,<space/><italics>converged</italics><space/>or<space/><italics>distributed</italics>, whether adjustment is permissible or surprise essential, the need for special procedures such as precision or danger close</listitem><listitem>how many fire units are needed and which ones they should be from those that are available (in range, with the required munitions type and quantity, not allotted to another target, have the most suitable line of fire if there is a risk to own troops or non-combatants);</listitem></list><paragraph>The<space/><italics>targeting</italics><space/>process is the key aspect of tactical fire control. Depending on the circumstances and national procedures it may all be undertaken in one place or may be distributed. In armies practicing control from the front, most of the process may be undertaken by a forward observer or other target acquirer. This is particularly the case for a smaller target requiring only a few fire units. The extent to which the process is formal or informal and makes use of computer based systems, documented norms or experience and judgement also varies widely armies and other circumstances.</paragraph><paragraph>Surprise may be essential or irrelevant. It depends on what effects are required and whether or not the target is likely to move or quickly improve its protective posture. During World War II UK researchers concluded that for impact fuzed munitions the relative risk were as follows:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>men standing 1</listitem><listitem>men lying 1/3</listitem><listitem>men firing from trenches 1/151/50</listitem><listitem>men crouching in trenches 1/251/100</listitem></list><paragraph>Airburst munitions significantly increase the relative risk for lying men, etc. Historically most casualties occur in the first 1015 seconds of fire, i.e. the time needed to react and improve protective posture, however, this is less relevant if airburst is used.</paragraph><paragraph>There are several ways of making best use of this brief window of maximum vulnerability:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>ordering the guns to fire together, either by executive order or by a &quot;fire at&quot; time. The disadvantage is that if the fire is<space/><italics>concentrated</italics><space/>from many dispersed<space/><italics>fire units</italics><space/>then there will be different times of flight and the first rounds will be spread in time. To some extent a large concentration offsets the problem because it may mean that only one round is required from each gun and most of these could arrive in the 15 second window.</listitem><listitem>burst fire, a rate of fire to deliver three rounds from each gun within 10 or 15 seconds, this reduces the number of guns and hence fire units needed, which means they may be less dispersed and have less variation in their times of flight. Smaller caliber guns, such as 105&amp;nbsp;mm, have always been able to deliver three rounds in 15 seconds, larger calibers firing fixed rounds could also do it but it wasn't until the 1970s that a multi-charge 155&amp;nbsp;mm howitzer,<space/><link><target>FH-70</target></link><space/>first gained the capability.</listitem><listitem>multiple round simultaneous impact (MRSI).</listitem><listitem><italics>time on target</italics>, fire units fire at the time less their time of flight, this works well with prearranged scheduled fire but is less satisfactory for opportunity targets because it means delaying the delivery of fire by selecting a 'safe' time that all or most fire units can achieve. It can be used with both the previous two methods.</listitem></list><heading level='3'>Counter-battery fire</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Counter-battery fire</arg></template>Modern<space/><bold>Counter-battery fire</bold><space/>developed in<space/><link><target>World War I</target></link>, with the objective of defeating the enemy's artillery. Typically such fire was used to suppress enemy batteries when they were or were about to interfere with the activities of friendly forces (such as to prevent enemy defensive artillery fire against an impending attack) or to systematically destroy enemy guns. In World War I the latter required air observation. The first indirect counter-battery fire was in May 1900 by an observer in a balloon.</paragraph><paragraph>Enemy artillery can be detected in two ways, either by direct observation of the guns from the air or by ground observers (including specialist reconnaissance), or from their firing signatures. This includes radars tracking the shells in flight to determine their place of origin, sound ranging detecting guns firing and resecting their position from pairs of microphones or cross-observation of gun flashes using observation by human observers or opto-electronic devices, although the widespread adoption of 'flashless' propellant limited the effectiveness of the latter.</paragraph><paragraph>Once hostile batteries have been detected they may be engaged immediately by friendly artillery or later at an optimum time, depending on the tactical situation and the counter-battery policy. Air strike is another option. In some situations the task is to locate all active enemy batteries for attack using a counter-battery fire at the appropriate moment in accordance with a plan developed by artillery intelligence staff. In other situations counter-battery fire may occur whenever a battery is located with sufficient accuracy.</paragraph><paragraph>Modern counter-battery target acquisition uses unmanned aircraft,<space/><link><target>counter-battery radar</target></link>, ground reconnaissance and sound-ranging. Counter-battery fire may be adjusted by some of the systems, for example the operator of an unmanned aircraft can 'follow' a battery if it moves. Defensive measures by batteries include frequently changing position or constructing defensive earthworks, the tunnels used by North Korea being an extreme example. Counter-measures include air defence against aircraft and attacking counter-battery radars physically and electronically.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:PzH2000Munition.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>200px</part><part>right</part><part>Modern artillery ammunition.

The 'Field Artillery System' above gives a more comprehensive description. Modern field artillery (postWorld War I) has three distinct parts: the<space/><link><target>forward observer</target></link><space/>(or FO), the<space/><link><target>fire direction center</target></link><space/>(FDC) and the actual guns themselves. The forward observer observes the target using tools such as<space/><link><target>binoculars</target></link>,<space/><link><target>laser rangefinder</target><trail>s</trail></link>, designators and call back fire missions on his radio, or relays the data through a portable computer via an encrypted digital radio connection protected from jamming by computerized frequency hopping. A lesser known part of the team is the FAS or Field Artillery Survey team which setups up the &quot;Gun Line&quot; for the cannons. Today most artillery battalions use a(n) &quot;Aiming Circle&quot; which allows for faster setup and more mobility. FAS teams are still used for checks and balances purposes and if a gun battery has issues with the &quot;Aiming Circle&quot; a FAS team will do it for them.</paragraph><paragraph>The FO can communicate directly with the battery FDC, of which there is one per each<space/><link><target>Artillery battery</target><part>battery</part></link><space/>of 48 guns. Otherwise the several FOs communicate with a higher FDC such as at a Battalion level, and the higher FDC prioritizes the targets and allocates fires to individual batteries as needed to engage the targets that are spotted by the FOs or to perform preplanned fires.</paragraph><paragraph>The Battery FDC computes firing dataammunition to be used, powder charge, fuse settings, the direction to the target, and the quadrant elevation to be fired at to reach the target, what gun will fire any rounds needed for adjusting on the target, and the number of rounds to be fired on the target by each gun once the target has been accurately locatedto the guns. Traditionally this data is relayed via radio or wire communications as a warning order to the guns, followed by orders specifying the type of ammunition and fuse setting, direction, and the elevation needed to reach the target, and the method of adjustment or orders for fire for effect (FFE). However, in more advanced artillery units, this data is relayed through a digital radio link.</paragraph><paragraph>Other parts of the field artillery team include meteorological analysis to determine the temperature, humidity and pressure of the air and wind direction and speed at different altitudes. Also radar is used both for determining the location of enemy artillery and mortar batteries and to determine the precise actual strike points of rounds fired by battery and comparing that location with what was expected to compute a registration allowing future rounds to be fired with much greater accuracy.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Time on Target</heading><paragraph>A technique called Time on Target was developed by the British Army in North Africa at the end of 1941 and early 1942 particularly for counter-battery fire and other concentrations, it proved very popular. It relied on BBC time signals to enable officers to synchronize their watches to the second because this avoided the need to use military radio networks and the possibility of losing surprise, and the need for field telephone networks in the desert.<extension extension_name='ref'>The Development of Artillery Tactics and Equipment, Brigadier AL Pemberton, 1950, The War Office, pg 129</extension><space/>With this technique the time of flight from each fire unit (battery or troop) to the target is taken from the range or firing tables, or the computer and each engaging fire unit subtracts its time of flight from the TOT to determine the time to fire. An executive order to fire is given to all guns in the fire unit at the correct moment to fire. When each fire unit fires their rounds at their individual firing time all the opening rounds will reach the target area almost simultaneously. This is especially effective when combined with techniques that allow fires for effect to be made without preliminary adjusting fires.</paragraph><heading level='3'>MRSI</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:MRSI-trajectories.svg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Illustration of different trajectories used in MRSI: For any muzzle velocity there is a steeper (&gt; 45, solid line) and a lower (&lt;45, dashed line) trajectory. On these different trajectories, the shells have different flight times.</part></link>This is a modern version of the earlier &quot;<link><target>time on target</target></link>&quot; concept in which fire from different weapons was timed to arrive on target at the same time. It is possible for artillery to fire several shells per gun at a target and have all of them arrive simultaneously, which is called MRSI (Multiple Rounds Simultaneous Impact). This is because there is more than one trajectory for the rounds to fly to any given target: typically one is below 45 degrees from horizontal and the other is above it, and by using different size propelling charges with each shell, it is possible to create multiple trajectories. Because the higher trajectories cause the shells to arc higher into the air, they take longer to reach the target and so if the shells are fired on these trajectories for the first volleys (starting with the shell with the most propellant and working down) and then after the correct pause more volleys are fired on the lower trajectories, the shells will all arrive at the same time. This is useful because many more shells can land on the target with no warning. With traditional volleys along the same trajectory, anybody at the target area may have time (however long it takes to reload and re-fire the guns) to take cover between volleys. However, guns capable of burst fire can deliver several rounds in 10 seconds if they use the same firing data for each, and if guns in more than one location are firing on one target they can use Time on Target procedures so that all their shells arrive at the same time and target.</paragraph><paragraph>To engage targets using MRSI requires two things, firstly guns with the requisite rate of fire and sufficiently different size propelling charges, secondly a fire control computer that has been designed to compute such missions and the data handling capability that allows all the firing data to be produced, sent to each gun and then presented to the gun commander in the correct order. The number of rounds that can be delivered in MRSI depends primarily on the range to the target and the rate of fire, for maximum rounds the range is limited to that of lowest propelling charge that will reach the target.</paragraph><paragraph>Examples of guns with a rate of fire that makes them suitable for MRSI includes UK's<space/><link><target>AS-90</target></link>,<space/><link><target>South Africa</target></link>'s<space/><link><target>Denel G6</target><part>Denel G6-52</part></link><space/>(which can land six rounds simultaneously at targets at least<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>25</arg><arg>km</arg><arg>0</arg><arg name="abbr">on</arg></template><space/>away),<space/><link><target>Germany</target></link>'s<space/><link><target>Panzerhaubitze 2000</target></link><space/>(which can land five rounds simultaneously at targets at least<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>17</arg><arg>km</arg><arg>0</arg><arg name="abbr">on</arg></template><space/>away)<space/><link><target>Slovakia</target></link>'s<space/><link><target>155mm SpGH ZUZANA</target><part>155&amp;nbsp;mm SpGH ZUZANA model 2000</part></link>.

It is unclear how many fire control computers have the necessary capabilities.</paragraph><paragraph>Two-round MRSI firings were a popular artillery demonstration in the 1960s, where well trained detachments could show off their skills for spectators.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Air burst</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Air burst</arg></template>The destructiveness of artillery bombardments can be enhanced when some or all of the shells are set for airburst, meaning that they explode in the air above the target instead of upon impact. This can be accomplished either through time<space/><link><target>Fuse (explosives)</target><part>fuse</part><trail>s</trail></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>proximity fuse</target><trail>s</trail></link>. Time fuses use a precise timer to detonate the shell after a preset delay. This technique is tricky and slight variations in the functioning of the fuse can cause it to explode too high and be ineffective, or to strike the ground instead of exploding above it. Since December 1944 (<link><target>Battle of the Bulge</target></link>), proximity fuzed artillery shells have been available that take the guesswork out of this process. These embody a miniature, low powered<space/><link><target>radar</target></link><space/>transmitter in the fuse to detect the ground and explode them at a predetermined height above it. The return of the weak radar signal completes an electrical circuit in the fuze which explodes the shell. The proximity fuse itself was developed by the British to increase the effectiveness of<space/><link><target>anti-aircraft warfare</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>This is a very effective tactic against infantry and light vehicles, because it scatters the<space/><link><target>fragmentation (weaponry)</target><part>fragmentation</part></link><space/>of the shell over a larger area and prevents it from being blocked by terrain or entrenchments that do not include some form of robust overhead cover. Combined with TOT or MRSI tactics that give no warning of the incoming rounds, these rounds are especially devastating because many enemy soldiers are likely to be caught in the open. This is even more so if the attack is launched against an assembly area or troops moving in the open rather than a unit in an entrenched tactical position.</paragraph><heading level='2'>See
