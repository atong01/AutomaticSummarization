Advanced Chemistry was founded in 1987 by Toni L, Linguist, Gee-One, DJ Mike MD (Mike Dippon) and MC Torch.

They were one of the first groups to rap in German (although their name is in English). Furthermore, their songs tackled controversial social and political issues, distinguishing them from early German hip hop group &quot;<link><target>Die Fantastischen Vier</target></link>&quot; (The Fantastic Four), which had a more light-hearted, playful, party image.<extension extension_name='ref' name="lqomwy"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The rivalry between Advanced Chemistry and Die Fantastischen Vier has served to highlight a dichotomy in the routes that hip hop has taken in becoming a part of the German soundscape. While Die Fantastischen Vier may be said to view hip hop primarily as an aesthetic art form, Advanced Chemistry understand hip hop as being inextricably linked to the social and political circumstances under which it is created. For Advanced Chemistry, hip hop is a vehicle of general human emancipation,.<extension extension_name='ref' name="ReferenceA">Brown, Timothy S. &quot;'Keeping it Real' in a Different 'Hood:(African-) Americanization and Hip-hop in Germany.&quot; In The Vinyl Ain'tFinal: Hip Hop and the Globalization of Black Popular Culture, ed. by Dipannita Basu and Sidney J.

This single was the first of its kind to go beyond simply imitating US rap and addressed the current issues of the time. Fremd im eigenen Land which translates to foreign in my own country dealt with the widespread racism that non-white German citizens faced. This change from simple imitation to political commentary was the start of German identification with rap.<extension extension_name='ref' name="lqomwy"></extension><extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://nomadicwax.com/2007/12/16/hip-hop-in-germany/'>Hip hop in Germany : Nomadic Wax</link></extension><space/>The sound of Fremd im eigenen Land was influenced by the 'wall of noise' created by Public Enemy's producers, The Bomb Squad.<extension extension_name='ref'><link><target>The Bomb Squad</target></link></extension></paragraph><paragraph>After the reunification of Germany, an abundance of anti-immigrant sentiment emerged, as well as attacks on the homes of refugees in the early 90's. Advanced Chemistry came to prominence in the wake of these actions because of their pro-multicultural society stance in their music. Advanced Chemistry's attitudes revolve around their attempts to create a distinct &quot;Germanness&quot; in hip hop, as opposed to imitating American hip hop as other groups had done. Torch has said, &quot;What the Americans do is exotic for us because we don't live like they do. What they do seems to be more interesting and newer. But not for me. For me it's more exciting to experience my fellow Germans in new contexts...For me, it's interesting to see what the kids try to do that's different from what I know.&quot;<space/><extension extension_name='ref'>Brown, Timothy S.

It is quite possibly the feelings of alienation from the pure-blooded German demographic that drive Advanced Chemistry to attack nationalistic ideologies by asserting their &quot;Germanness&quot; as a group composed primarily of ethnic others. The response to this pseudo-German authenticity can be seen in what<space/><link><target>Andy Bennett</target></link><space/>refers to as &quot;alternative forms of local hip hop culture which actively seek to rediscover and, in many cases, reconstruct notions of identity tied to cultural roots.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="Bennett">Bennett, Andy. &quot;Hip-Hop am Main, Rappin' on the Tyne: Hip-hop Culture as a Local Construct in Two European Cities.&quot; In That's the Joint!: The Hip-hop Studies Reader, 177-200.

This cultural binary illustrates that rap has taken different routes in Germany and that, even among an already isolated immigrant population, there is still disunity and, especially, disagreement on the relative importance of assimilation versus cultural defiance. According to German hip hop enthusiast 9@home, Advanced Chemistry is part of a &quot;hip-hop movement [which] took a clear stance for the minorities and against the [marginalization] of immigrants who...might be German on paper, but not in real life,&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>9@home. &quot;German Hip Hop 1: Advanced Chemistry.&quot; Leave Your Nine at Home. 13 Oct. 2007.

This is important in two ways. First, although no single country comes close to matching the amounts spent on recorded music in the United States, these markets are nonetheless economically significant. Germany, for instance, is the largest single market in western Europe, with estimated annual sales of U.S. $3.74 billion in 1996. This represents around 30 percent of reported U.S. sales and makes Germany the third biggest music market in the world.<extension extension_name='ref'>Michell, Tony Global Noise (Rap and Hip-Hop outside the USA) Published by Wesleyan University Press, Middletown CT. 06549 (C)2001</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Advanced Chemistry frequently rapped about their lives and experiences as children of immigrants,<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.atlantic-times.com/archive_detail.php?recordID=828'>The Atlantic Times :: Archive</link></extension><space/>exposing the marginalization experienced by most ethnic minorities in Germany, and the feelings of frustration and resentment that being denied a German identity can cause.<extension extension_name='ref'>Bennett, Andy. &quot;Hip-Hop am Main, Rappin' on the Tyne: Hip-hop Culture as a Local Construct in Two European Cities.&quot; In That's the Joint!: The Hip-hop Studies Reader, 177-200.
