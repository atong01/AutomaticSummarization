Robert Roy MacGregor was born at the head of nearby Loch Katrine, and his well known cattle stealing exploits took him all around the area surrounding Aberfoyle. It is recorded, for example, that in 1691, the MacGregors raided every barn in the village of Kippen and stole all the villagers' livestock!<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last">Hood</arg><arg name="first">John</arg><arg name="title">Old Aberfoyle, Thornhill and the Forth Villages</arg><arg name="year">2000</arg><arg name="publisher">Stenlake Publishing</arg><arg name="location">Catrine, Ayrshire</arg><arg name="isbn">9781840331103</arg><arg name="page">3</arg><arg name="url">http://www.stenlake.co.uk/books/view_book.php?ref</arg></template></extension><space/>There currently stands a tree in the village that MacGregor was reputed to have climbed and hid in to escape the clutches of the law. Also, Mary, Queen of Scots, visited nearby Inchmahome Priory often as a child, and during her short reign. She also used the priory during her short reign, particularly in 1547, where she felt safe from the English Army.</paragraph><paragraph>However, the most local historical figure is the Reverend<space/><link><target>Robert Kirk (folklorist)</target><part>Robert Kirk</part></link>, born in 1644.

It was after this, while Kirk was minister of Aberfoyle parish, that he died in unusual circumstances.</paragraph><paragraph>Kirk had long believed that the local Doon Hill was the gateway to the &quot;Secret Commonwealth&quot;, or the land of the Fairies. It was a place that Kirk visited often, taking daily walks there from his manse. The story goes that the Fairies of Doon Hill were angry with the Rev. Kirk for going into the domain of the Unseelie court, where he had been warned not to go, and decided to imprison him in Doon Hill&amp;nbsp; for one night in May 1692, the Rev. Kirk went out for a walk to the hill, in his nightshirt. Some accounts claim that he simply vanished, however he suddenly collapsed. He was found and brought home, but died soon afterwards. He was buried in his own kirkyard, although local legends claim that the fairies took his body away, and the coffin contains only stones. The huge pine tree that still stands at the top of Doon Hill is said to contain Kirk's imprisoned spirit.</paragraph><paragraph>Kirk's cousin, Graham of Duchray, was then to claim that the spectre of Kirk had visited him in the night, and told him that he had been carried off by the Fairies. Having left his widow expecting a child, the spectre of Kirk told Graham that he would appear at the baptism, whereupon Graham was to throw an iron knife at the apparition, thus freeing Kirk from the Fairies' clutches. However, when Kirk's spectre appeared, Graham was apparently too shocked by the vision to throw the knife, and Kirk's ghost faded away forever.</paragraph><paragraph>Today, visitors to Doon Hill write their wishes on pieces of white silk, or other white cloth, and tie them to the branches of the trees for the Fairies to grant. Unfortunately some people tie plastic confectionery wrappers instead, which slightly spoils the magic of the location and may harm the ecology of the forest. It is also said that if one runs around the great 'Minister's Pine' tree at the summit seven times, then the Fairies will appear. Some people have tried this and afterwards claim to have seen apparitions. Others merely get a bit dizzy and fall over.</paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>List of places in Stirling (district)</target></link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>reflist</target></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>External links</heading><paragraph><template><target>Commons category</target><arg>Aberfoyle, Stirling</arg></template></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><template><target>Cite EB1911</target><arg name="wstitle">Aberfoyle</arg></template></listitem></list><paragraph><template><target>Stirling Towns &amp; Villages</target></template></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Category:Villages in Stirling (council area)</target></link></paragraph></article>
