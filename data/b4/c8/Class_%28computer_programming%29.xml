It results in a layered design where clients of an interface use the methods declared in the interface. An interface places no requirements for clients to invoke the operations of one interface in any particular order. This approach has the benefit that client code can assume that the operations of an interface are available for use whenever the client has access to the object.<space/><template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="reason">Source needed for whole paragraph...this is a rather specific statement about OOP methodology.</arg><arg name="date">April 2012</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='4'>Example</heading><paragraph>The buttons on the front of your television set are the interface between you and the electrical wiring on the other side of its plastic casing.

For example, a &quot;subscriber&quot; role describes the way instances of the class &quot;Person&quot; participate in a &quot;subscribes-to&quot; association with the class &quot;Magazine&quot;. Also, a &quot;Magazine&quot; has the &quot;subscribed magazine&quot; role in the same association. Association role multiplicity describes how many instances correspond to each instance of the other class of the association. Common multiplicities are &quot;0..1&quot;, &quot;1..1&quot;, &quot;1..*&quot; and &quot;0..*&quot;, where the &quot;*&quot; specifies any number of instances.<extension extension_name='ref' name="ibmuml"></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Taxonomy of classes</heading><paragraph>There are many categories of classes, some of which overlap.</paragraph><heading level='3'><template><target>Anchor</target><arg>Abstract_and_concrete_classes</arg><arg>Abstract_and_Concrete</arg></template>Abstract and concrete</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Abstract type</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>In a language that supports inheritance, an<space/><bold>abstract class</bold>, or<space/><italics>abstract base class</italics><space/>(ABC), is a class that cannot be instantiated because it is either labeled as abstract or it simply specifies<space/><link><target>abstract method</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>(or<space/><italics>virtual methods</italics>).

Instances of classes can be inspected at run time to verify that the system is performing as expected.

When developers need to change the behavior of an object they can localize the change to just that object and its component parts. This reduces the potential for unwanted side effects from maintenance enhancements.</paragraph><paragraph>Software re-use is also a major benefit of using Object classes. Classes facilitate re-use via inheritance and interfaces. When a new behavior is required it can often be achieved by creating a new class and having that class inherit the default behaviors and data of its superclass and then tailor some aspect of the behavior or data accordingly. Re-use via interfaces (also known as methods) occurs when another object wants to invoke (rather than create a new kind of) some object class. This method for re-use removes many of the common errors that can make their way into software when one program re-uses code from another.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last">Jacobsen</arg><arg name="first">Ivar</arg><arg name="title">Object Oriented Software Engineering</arg><arg name="year">1992</arg><arg name="publisher">Addison-Wesley ACM Press</arg><arg name="isbn">0-201-54435-0</arg><arg name="author2">Magnus Christerson<space/></arg><arg name="author3">Patrik Jonsson<space/></arg><arg name="author4">Gunnar Overgaard<space/></arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>These benefits come with a cost of course. One of most serious obstacles to using object classes has been performance. Interpreted environments that support languages such as Smalltalk and CLOS provided rapid development but the resulting code was not nearly as fast as what could be achieved in some procedural languages such as C. This has been partly addressed by the development of object-oriented languages that are not interpreted such as C++ and Java.<extension extension_name='ref'>Java uses a Virtual Machine architecture which gives it some of the advantages of an interpreted environment but with efficiency and benefits (e.g. strong typing) of compiled environments.</extension><space/>Also, due to<space/><link><target>Moore's law</target></link><space/>the processing power of computers has increased to the point where efficient code is not as critical for most systems as it was in the past. Still, no matter how well designed the language, there will always be an inevitable bit of required extra overhead to create a class rather than use procedural code and in some circumstances, especially where performance or memory are required to be optimal, that using object classes may not be the best approach.</paragraph><paragraph>Also, getting the benefits of object classes requires that they be used appropriately and that requires training.
