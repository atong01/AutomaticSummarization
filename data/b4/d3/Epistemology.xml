According to the theory that knowledge is justified true belief, in order to know that a given proposition is true, one must not only believe the relevant true proposition, but one must also have a good reason for doing so. One implication of this would be that no one would gain knowledge just by believing something that happened to be true. For example, an ill person with no medical training, but with a generally optimistic attitude, might believe that he will recover from his illness quickly. Nevertheless, even if this belief turned out to be true, the patient would not have<space/><italics>known</italics><space/>that he would get well since his belief lacked justification.</paragraph><paragraph>The definition of knowledge as justified true belief was widely accepted until the 1960s.

That is, Gettier contended that while justified belief in a true proposition is necessary for that proposition to be known, it is not sufficient. As in the diagram, a true proposition can be believed by an individual (purple region) but still not fall within the &quot;knowledge&quot; category (yellow region).</paragraph><paragraph>According to Gettier, there are certain circumstances in which one does not have knowledge, even when all of the above conditions are met. Gettier proposed two<space/><link><target>thought experiment</target><trail>s</trail></link>, which have come to be known as &quot;Gettier cases,&quot; as<space/><link><target>counterexample</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>to the classical account of knowledge. One of the cases involves two men, Smith and Jones, who are awaiting the results of their applications for the same job. Each man has ten coins in his pocket. Smith has excellent reasons to believe that Jones will get the job and, furthermore, knows that Jones has ten coins in his pocket (he recently counted them). From this Smith infers, &quot;the man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket.&quot; However, Smith is unaware that he also has ten coins in his own pocket. Furthermore, Smith, not Jones, is going to get the job. While Smith has strong evidence to believe that Jones will get the job, he is wrong. Smith has a justified true belief that a man with ten coins in his pocket will get the job; however, according to Gettier, Smith does not<space/><italics>know</italics><space/>that a man with ten coins in his pocket will get the job, because Smith's belief is &quot;...true by virtue of the number of coins in<space/><italics>Jones's</italics><space/>pocket, while Smith does not know how many coins are in Smith's pocket, and bases his belief...on a count of the coins in Jones's pocket, whom he falsely believes to be the man who will get the job.&quot; (see<extension extension_name='ref' name="gettier"></extension><space/>p.&amp;nbsp;122.) These cases fail to be knowledge because the subject's belief is justified, but only happens to be true by virtue of luck. In other words, he made the correct choice (in this case predicting an outcome) for the wrong reasons. This example is similar to those often given when discussing belief and truth, wherein a person's belief of what will happen can coincidentally be correct without his or her having the actual knowledge to base it on.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Responses to Gettier</heading><paragraph>The responses to Gettier have been varied. Usually, they have involved substantial attempts to provide a definition of knowledge different from the classical one, either by recasting knowledge as justified true belief with some additional fourth condition, or as something else altogether.<template><target>clarify</target><arg name="date">December 2014</arg></template>Yet a good counter-argument to Gettier's cases, is that unless they pulled out the coins and recounted them, they couldn't have KNOWN, because the knowledge was based on past events. As time passes, so too does circumstances; for one could have dropped a coin after the other counted them, also without his knowledge, and he would be aware of this variable; thus couldn't truly believe this; ergo, the counter case is null.</paragraph><heading level='5'>Infallibilism, indefeasibility</heading><paragraph>In one response to Gettier, the American philosopher<space/><link><target>Richard Kirkham</target></link><space/>has argued that the only definition of knowledge that could ever be immune to all counterexamples is the<space/><link><target>infallibilism</target><part>infallibilist</part></link><space/>one.<extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.centenary.edu/attachments/philosophy/aizawa/courses/epistemologyf2008/kirkham1984.pdf</extension><space/>To qualify as an item of knowledge, goes the theory, a belief must not only be true and justified, the justification of the belief must<space/><italics>necessitate</italics><space/>its truth. In other words, the justification for the belief must be infallible.</paragraph><paragraph>Yet another possible candidate for the fourth condition of knowledge is<space/><italics>indefeasibility.</italics><space/>Defeasibility theory maintains that there should be no overriding or defeating truths for the reasons that justify one's belief. For example, suppose that person<space/><italics>S</italics><space/>believes he saw Tom Grabit steal a book from the library and uses this to justify the claim that Tom Grabit stole a book from the library. A possible defeater or overriding proposition for such a claim could be a true proposition like, &quot;Tom Grabit's identical twin Sam is currently in the same town as Tom.&quot; When no defeaters of one's justification exist, a subject would be epistemelogically justified.</paragraph><paragraph>The Indian philosopher<space/><link><target>B K Matilal</target></link><space/>has drawn on the<space/><link><target>Navya-Nyya</target></link><space/><link><target>fallibilism</target></link><space/>tradition to respond to the Gettier problem. Nyaya theory distinguishes between<space/><italics>know p</italics><space/>and<space/><italics>know that one knows p</italics><space/>these are different events, with different causal conditions. The second level is a sort of implicit inference that usually follows immediately the episode of knowing p (knowledge<space/><italics>simpliciter</italics>). The Gettier case is examined by referring to a view of<space/><link><target>Gangesha Upadhyaya</target></link><space/>(late 12th century), who takes any true belief to be knowledge; thus a true belief acquired through a wrong route may just be regarded as knowledge simpliciter on this view. The question of justification arises only at the second level, when one considers the knowledgehood of the acquired belief. Initially, there is lack of uncertainty, so it becomes a true belief. But at the very next moment, when the hearer is about to embark upon the venture of<space/><italics>knowing whether he knows p</italics>, doubts may arise. &quot;If, insome Gettier-like cases, I am wrong in my inference about the knowledgehood of the given occurrent belief (for the evidence may be pseudo-evidence), then I am mistaken about the truth of my belief and this is in accordance with Nyaya fallibilism: not all knowledge-claims can be sustained.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="Matilal"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="author"><space/>[[Bimal Krishna Matilal]]

According to reliabilism, a belief is justified (or otherwise supported in such a way as to count towards knowledge) only if it is produced by processes that typically yield a sufficiently high ratio of true to false beliefs. In other words, this theory states that a true belief counts as knowledge only if it is produced by a reliable belief-forming process.</paragraph><paragraph>Reliabilism has been challenged by Gettier cases. Another argument that challenges reliabilism, like the Gettier cases (although it was not presented in the same short article as the Gettier cases), is the case of Henry and the barn faades. In the thought experiment, a man, Henry, is driving along and sees a number of buildings that resemble barns. Based on his perception of one of these, he concludes that he has just seen barns. While he has seen one, and the perception he based his belief that the one he saw was of a real barn, all the other<space/><link><target>barn</target></link>-like buildings he saw were faades. Theoretically, Henry does not know that he has seen a barn, despite both his belief that he has seen one being true and his belief being formed on the basis of a reliable process (i.e. his vision), since he only acquired his true belief by accident.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite journal</target><arg name="title">Appearing as Irreducible in Perception<space/></arg><arg name="first">Alan H.<space/></arg><arg name="last">Goldman<space/></arg><arg name="journal">Philosophy and Phenomenological Research<space/></arg><arg name="volume">37<space/></arg><arg name="issue">2<space/></arg><arg name="date">December 1976<space/></arg><arg name="pages">147–164<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">International Phenomenological Society<space/></arg><arg name="jstor">2107188</arg><arg name="doi">10.2307/2107188<space/></arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='5'>Other responses</heading><paragraph><link><target>Robert Nozick</target></link><space/>has offered the following definition of knowledge:<italics>S</italics><space/>knows that<space/><italics>P</italics><space/>if and only if:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><italics>P</italics>;</listitem><listitem><italics>S</italics><space/>believes that<space/><italics>P</italics>;</listitem><listitem>if<space/><italics>P</italics><space/>were false,<space/><italics>S</italics><space/>would not believe that<space/><italics>P</italics>;</listitem><listitem>if<space/><italics>P</italics><space/>is true,<space/><italics>S</italics><space/>will believe that<space/><italics>P</italics>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Nozick"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="author"><space/>Robert Nozick

Usually this is understood to be a causal link. Such causation, to the extent that it is &quot;outside&quot; the mind, would count as an external, knowledge-yielding condition.

Though Descartes could doubt his senses, his body and the world around him, he could not deny his own existence, because he was able to doubt and must exist in order to do so. Even if some &quot;evil genius&quot; were to be deceiving him, he would have to exist in order to be deceived. This one sure point provided him with what he would call his Archimedean point, in order to further develop his foundation for knowledge.

A priori knowledge is often contrasted with posteriori knowledge, which is knowledge gained by experience. A way to look at the difference between the two is through an example. Bruce Russell gives two propositions in which the reader decides which one he believes more. Option A: All crows are birds. Option B: All crows are black. If you believe option A, then you are a priori justified in believing it because you don't have to see a crow to know it's a bird. If you believe in option B, then you are posteriori justified to believe it because you have seen many crows therefore knowing they are black.
