The Italian forces at Bardia and on the Egyptian border were now cut off from the retreating Axis.

All operable equipment was put into immediate service. Rommel's<space/><link><target>Panzer Army Africa</target></link><space/>had a force of 320 German tanks; 50 of these were the light<space/><link><target>Panzer II</target></link><space/>model.

This was of less concern to Rommel, who was by now accustomed to fighting from a numerically smaller position. The Axis had, however, temporarily established more-or-less air parity with the Western Desert Air Force.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Map of siege of Tobruk 1942.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Situation in &quot;the Cauldron&quot;, 27 May 1942</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>Early in the afternoon of 26 May 1942, Rommel attacked first and the<space/><link><target>Battle of Gazala</target></link><space/>commenced. Italian infantry supplemented with small numbers of armoured forces assaulted the Gazala fortifications from the west. The intention was to give the impression that this was the main assault. Under the cover of darkness that night the bulk of his motorized and armoured forces drove south to skirt the left flank of the British, coming up and attacking to the north the following morning. Throughout the day a running armour battle occurred, where both sides took heavy losses. The attempted encirclement of the Gazala position failed and the Germans lost a third of their medium tanks. Renewing the attack on the morning of 28 May, Rommel concentrated on encircling and destroying separate units of the British armour. Repeated British counterattacks threatened to cut off and destroy the Afrika Korps. Running low on fuel, Rommel assumed a defensive posture, forming &quot;the Cauldron&quot;. He made use of the extensive British minefields to shield his western flank. Meanwhile, Italian infantry cleared a path through the mines to provide supplies. On 30 May Rommel resumed the offensive, attacking westwards to link with elements of Italian X Corps, which had cleared a path through the Allied minefields to establish a supply line. On 2 June 90th Light Division and the<space/><italics>Trieste</italics><space/>Division again assaulted the Free French strongpoint at<space/><link><target>Battle of Bir Hakeim</target><part>Bir Hakeim</part></link>, but the defenders continued to thwart the attack until finally breaking on 11 June.

As the central and eastern<space/><link><target>Mediterranean</target></link><space/>was dominated by the Axis airfields in Greece and Crete, almost all the allied supplies had to be shipped around the<space/><link><target>Cape of Good Hope</target></link><space/>at the southern tip of Africa, and back up the east coast of Africa to Egypt. Though the route was significantly longer, the British and now Americans provided the Eighth Army with a great deal of supplies. Meanwhile, allied forces based at<space/><link><target>Malta</target></link><space/>were recovering from the attacks they had suffered and were beginning to intercept more supplies at sea. Furthermore, with decreased duties flying cover for convoys to Malta the Desert Air Force began interdicting Axis supply vessels in Tobruk, Bardia and Mersa Matruh. Most of the supplies reaching the Axis troops still had to be landed at Benghazi and Tripoli, and the enormous distances supplies had to travel to reach the forward troops meant that a rapid resupply and reorganisation of the Axis army could not be done unless Rommel returned to his base at Tobrukwhich he was unwilling to do, because it would give the initiative back to the British. Further, hampering Rommel's plans was the fact that the Italian divisions received priority on supplies, with the Italian authorities shipping material for the Italian formations at a much higher rate than for German formations.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Rommel</arg><arg>1982</arg><arg name="p">267</arg></template><space/>The Italian HQ desired their own forces be resupplied first.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Rommel</arg><arg>1982</arg><arg name="p">268</arg></template><link><target>File:Rommel at a staff conference in the Western Desert.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Rommel at a staff conference in the<space/><link><target>Libyan Desert</target><part>Western Desert</part></link>, 1942</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>The British, themselves preparing for a renewed drive, replaced C-in-C Auchinleck with General<space/><link><target>Harold Alexander</target></link>.

Rommel decided to launch an attack with the 15th and 21st Panzer Division, 90th Light Division, and the Italian XX Motorized Corps in a drive through the southern flank of the El Alamein lines. The terrain here was without any easily defensible features and so open to attack.

After passing the El Alamein line to the south, Rommel drove north at the Alam el Halfa Ridge, just as Montgomery had anticipatedinto a mine-strewn area with patches of quicksand. Under heavy fire from British artillery and aircraft, and in the face of well prepared positions that Rommel could not hope to outflank due to lack of fuel, the attack stalled. By 2 September, Rommel realized the battle was unwinnable, and decided to withdraw.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Carver</arg><arg>1962</arg><arg name="p">67</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Montgomery had made preparations to cut the Germans off in their retreat, but in the afternoon of 2 September he visited Corps commander<space/><link><target>Brian Horrocks</target></link><space/>and gave orders to allow the Germans to retire.

The British losses, except tank losses of 68, were much less, further adding to the numerical inferiority of Panzer Army Afrika. The Desert Air Force inflicted the highest proportions of damage to Rommel's forces. He now realized the war in Africa could not be won. Another blow to Rommel occurred on 1 September when the Luftwaffe's<space/><link><target>Hans-Joachim Marseille</target></link>, one of the greatest fighter aces of the entire war, was killed attempting to bailout of his burning fighter near Sidi Abdal Rahman, following an engine failure.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Rommel</arg><arg>1982</arg><arg name="p">286</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='5'>Second Battle of El Alamein</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Destroyed Panzer IIIs near Tel el Eisa 1942.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Destroyed Panzer IIIs near Tel el Eisa, El Alamein 1942</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>In September British raiding parties attacked important harbours and supply points. The flow of supplies successfully ferried across the Mediterranean had fallen to a dismal level. Some two-thirds of the supplies embarked for Africa were destroyed at sea. In addition, Rommel's health was failing and he took sick leave in Italy and Germany from late September. Thus, he was not present when the<space/><link><target>Second Battle of El Alamein</target></link><space/>began on 23 October 1942. Although he returned immediately, it took him two vital days to reach his HQ in Africa. The defensive plan at El Alamein was more static in nature than Rommel preferred, but with shortages of motorized units and fuel, he had felt it was the only possible plan.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Rommel</arg><arg>1982</arg><arg name="p">298</arg></template>The defensive line had strong fortifications and was protected with a large minefield that in turn was covered with machine guns and artillery.

Rommel's main concern was to counterattack in full force and throw the British out of the defensive lines, which was in his view the only chance the Axis had of avoiding defeat.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Rommel</arg><arg>1982</arg><arg name="p">306</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>The counterattack was launched early on 26 October but those British units that had penetrated the defensive line inflicted heavy losses on Rommel's armour at the position code-named<space/><italics>Snipe</italics><space/>(often misnamed<space/><italics>Kidney Ridge</italics><space/>due to faulty interpretation of the ring contour&amp;nbsp; it was actually a depression).

Rommel immediately counterattacked with what tanks he had available in an attempt to encircle the pocket during 2 November, but the heavy Allied fire stopped the attempt. By this time Panzer Army Africa had only one-third of its initial strength remaining, with only 35 tanks left operational, virtually no fuel or ammunition and with the British in complete command of the air.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Rommel</arg><arg>1982</arg><arg name="p">319</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>On 3 November Montgomery chose to wait for more reinforcements to be brought up.

Although this order demanded the impossible and virtually ensured the destruction of Panzer Army Africa, Rommel could not bring himself to disobey a direct order. The Axis forces held on desperately.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Rommel</arg><arg>1982</arg><arg name="p">322</arg></template><space/>This decision to comply with Hitler's order was rescinded by Rommel a day later as his position further crumbled, but the delay was costly in terms of his ability to get his forces out of Egypt.

By midday the Italian XX Motorised Corps was surrounded, and several hours later was completely destroyed. This left a 20&amp;nbsp;km gap in Rommel's line, with British armoured and motorized units pouring through, threatening the entire Panzer Army Africa with encirclement. At this point Rommel could no longer uphold the no-retreat order and ordered a general retreat. On 4 November he could wait no more, and began withdrawing, but he was unable at this point to extract the unmotorised forces on the right or southern aspect of his line.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Rommel</arg><arg>1982</arg><arg name="p">326</arg></template><space/>12 hours later early on 5 November he received authorization by Hitler to withdraw. Hitler's indifference to the survival of Rommel's men was what began to shake Rommel's faith in the Fuhrerby the time Rommel was recalled from Africa for good in 1943, his attitude towards the dictator was bitter, though he continued to rely on him for political support.</paragraph><heading level='4'>End of Africa campaigns</heading><heading level='5'>Retreat across Africa</heading><paragraph>As Rommel attempted to withdraw his forces before the British could cut off his retreat, he was forced to fight a series of delaying actions. A large portion of his Italian infantry divisions were not motorised, nor were Ramcke's parachutists, and they had to march. With severe shortages of water, these units were all lost, though Ramcke and 600 of his men provided their own way out when they surprised a British supply column in the night and captured the transports and fuel. Heavy rains slowed movements and grounded the Desert Air Force, which aided the withdrawal. Those parts of Panzerarmee Africa that were motorized slipped away from El Alamein, but were under pressure from the pursuing Eighth Army. A series of short delaying actions were fought over the coastal highway, but no line could be held for any length of time, as Rommel lacked the armour and fuel to defend his open southern flank.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Lewin</arg><arg>1998</arg><arg name="p">190</arg></template><space/>Despite orders from Hitler and<space/><link><target>Benito Mussolini</target><part>Mussolini</part></link><space/>to stand and fight to the bitter end, Rommel continued to do the only thing sensible, and moved his army west, abandoning Halfaya Pass, Sollum, Mersa Brega and El Agheila.

Rommel defended his decision, pointing out that if he tried to assume a defensive position the Allies would destroy his forces and take the airfields anyway; the retreat saved the lives of his remaining men and shortened his supply lines. By now, Rommel's remaining forces fought in reduced strength combat groups, whereas the Allied forces had great numerical superiority and control of the air. Upon his arrival in<space/><link><target>Tunisia</target></link>, Rommel noted with some bitterness the reinforcements, including the 10th Panzer Division, arriving in Tunisia following the Allied invasion of Morocco. He felt these could have made all the difference at El Alamein.

The allies could be allowed to extend themselves deep into France where a battle for control would be fought, allowing the Germans to envelop the allied forces in a pincer movement, cutting off their avenue of retreat.

Rommel's strategy of an impregnable, armor-supported defense line was scoffed at by most of his fellow commanders including von Rundstedt, but his support from Hitler and Goebbels meant he could put all of it into effect except the Panzer divisions; however, these were, in his view, the most critical parts of the plan.</paragraph><paragraph>The Allies staged elaborate deceptions for<space/><link><target>D-Day</target></link><space/>(see<space/><link><target>Operation Fortitude</target></link>), giving the impression that the landings would be at Calais.

They trudged to the top and descended, and honour was satisfied, but the 41-year-old commander led his officers up and down the slope twice more before he let them fall out.

Rommel first displayed this type of initiative during the First World War as a junior officer in Belgium and later in the mountains of northern Italy. There he found a sudden, bold, decisive move could reap large dividends. This was reinforced by Rommel's experiences at the head of the 7th Panzer Division during the invasion of France in 1940, where it was clear that his presence at the forefront of the battle was instrumental in creating successful outcomes. But at times in North Africa his absence from a position of communication made command of the battles of the Afrika Korps very difficult.

Rommel was sent to Africa to shore up a crumbling situation created under the direction of the Italian command, and though he was nominally subordinate to the Italians for much of the campaign, he was under no illusions as to why he was there. Further, he enjoyed direct access with the highest German political authority, which allowed him a certain degree of autonomy from his Italian counterparts; since he was directing their troops in battle as well as his own, this was bound to cause hostility among Italian commanders. Conversely, as the Italian command had control over the supplies of the forces in Africa, they resupplied Italian units preferentially, which was a source of resentment for Rommel and his staff. Rommel's direct and abrasive manner did nothing to smooth these issues.<extension extension_name='ref'>&quot;Diario storico del Comando Supremo&quot;, vol.5 to 9, Italian Army General Staff Historical Office</extension><extension extension_name='ref'>&quot;Verbali delle riunioni tenute dal Capo di SM Generale&quot;, vol.2 and 3, Italian Army General Staff Historical Office</extension></paragraph><paragraph>While certainly much less proficient than Rommel in their leadership, aggressiveness, tactical outlook and mobile warfare skills, Italian commanders were competent in logistics, strategy and artillery doctrine: their troops were ill-equipped but well-trained.
