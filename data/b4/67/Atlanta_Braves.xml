The home uniforms consist of a standard white uniform, a red, military appreciation jersey worn with the standard white pants, and a cream alternate uniform. The road uniforms consist of a standard gray uniform, and an alternate navy blue jersey worn with the standard gray pants.</paragraph><paragraph>The white home uniform, introduced in 1987, is the primary home uniform. The jersey has &quot;Braves&quot; written in script across the breastplate with the tomahawk logo underneath. The jersey also includes piping around the collar and down the front of the jersey and around the bottom of the sleeves. Player numbers appear on the back of the jersey with a nameplate above. The Braves script, player numbers, and piping are red with a navy blue border. The tomahawk is primarily red with blue and yellow detail and a navy blue border. The white pants have identical piping to the jersey about the belt loops and down the outside seam of the pants. The player names consist of navy blue lettering sewn to a white nameplate. The player names originally used vertically arched lettering but, since 2006, the team has used radially arched lettering. The white uniform is paired with the standard home cap. It is a red brimmed, navy blue cap with a white embroidered &quot;script A&quot; logo. The home batting helmet is identical to the primary home cap.</paragraph><paragraph>The gray road uniforms are the primary road uniform. The uniforms are identical to the white home uniforms with the exception of the &quot;Braves&quot; script, which is replaced by the &quot;Atlanta&quot; script. Player names are sewn to a gray nameplate. The primary uniforms are very similar to the uniforms that the Braves wore from 1946 to 1965during their latter years in Boston and throughout their tenure in Milwaukee.</paragraph><paragraph>The red, military appreciation jersey was introduced on February 5, 2014. The jerseys feature navy blue piping with a white border, the Braves script in blue with white stars, and the American Flag on the left sleeve. The updated red jerseys will not include the tomahawk logo. The jerseys will be worn for five home games in 2014: April 26 vs. the Cincinnati Reds (military family night), June 13 vs. the LA Angels of Anaheim (celebrating the Army), July 26 vs. the San Diego Padres (celebrating the Marines), Aug. 30 vs. the Miami Marlins (celebrating the Navy), and Sept. 19 vs. NY Mets (celebrating the Air Force).<extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.ajc.com/news/sports/baseball/braves-to-honor-military-with-alternative-jerseys/ndDzJ/</extension><space/>The jerseys will be paired with camouflage caps.<extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.ajc.com/gallery/sports/baseball/braves-introduce-alternate-jersey/gCHSL/#4510217</extension><space/>The military appreciation jerseys replace the red jerseys introduced in 2005.<extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.ajc.com/news/sports/baseball/braves-home-red-jerseys-dropped-from-lineup/ndFBp/</extension><space/>Worn with the white pants, these jerseys included the same elements as the white jerseys, with the Braves script, player numbers, and piping in navy blue with a white border. The tomahawk was primarily blue, with red and yellow detail and a white border. The player names consisted of white lettering sewn to a red nameplate. These jerseys were paired with an alternate home cap, which was a red brimmed, navy blue cap with a red, embroidered &quot;script A&quot; logo with a tomahawk, outlined in white. The alternate cap did not have a matching batting helmet. The red alternate jerseys were worn for Sunday home games from 2005 - 2011. The only exceptions to this were the opening game of the 2005<space/><link><target>National League Division Series</target><part>NLDS</part></link>, which was played on a Wednesday, and on Memorial Day in 2006. The 2006 Memorial Day game is also the only time the red jerseys were paired with the primary home cap. With the introduction of the cream uniform in 2012, the red jerseys were worn for Friday night home games from 2012 - 2013. However, the Braves chose to wear the traditional white jerseys for their 2012 home opener, which took place on Friday, April 13.</paragraph><paragraph>The cream alternate uniforms were introduced in February 2012 as a tribute to the Braves' first season in Atlanta in 1966. The jersey includes the &quot;Braves&quot; script across the breastplate, but the player number replaces the tomahawk underneath the &quot;Braves&quot; script on the left placket. Player numbers and the &quot;Braves&quot; script are in red with a navy blue border. The player names consist of navy blue lettering sewn to a cream nameplate. The jersey has a thin, navy piping about the collar and down the front of the jersey. There is no piping around the sleeves. The cream pants include piping identical to the jersey down the outside seam. The left sleeve of the jersey has a &quot;crossed tomahawk&quot; logo that replaces the &quot;screaming Indian&quot; logo that appeared on the 1966 jerseys. The new logo has two, primarily red, crossed tomahawks. Underneath the tomahawks is a blue circle outlined in red, with &quot;1876&quot; in red above (commemorating the year the franchise was founded), and &quot;Atlanta Braves&quot; in white below. The cream uniforms are paired with the standard home cap and are worn for Saturday and Sunday home games.</paragraph><paragraph>The alternate navy blue road jerseys were introduced on opening night of the 2008 season against the Washington Nationals. Worn with the gray road pants, the jerseys feature the &quot;Atlanta&quot; script on the breastplate in navy blue with a white outline. The tomahawk is primarily navy blue with red and yellow detail and a white border. The player numbers are blue with white borders and the player names are white letters sewn to a navy blue nameplate. The navy blue jerseys have no piping either on the sleeves or around the collar.</paragraph><paragraph>From 1987 to 2008, the red brimmed, primary home cap was also worn on the road. However, when the navy blue jerseys were introduced in 2008, they were paired with a navy blue cap, similar to the team's road cap worn from 1966 to 1971. While the red brimmed cap was still primarily worn with the gray road uniforms, the team sometimes wore the navy blue cap with the gray jerseys, and the red brimmed cap was occasionally worn with the navy blue jerseys. The red brimmed home batting helmets were also worn on the road from 1987 through 2008. Beginning in 2009, the navy blue cap became the official road cap and was paired with a navy blue road batting helmet.</paragraph><paragraph>Unlike the home uniforms, which are worn based on a schedule, the road uniforms are chosen on game day by the starting pitcher. However, they are also subject to<space/><link><target>Major League Baseball</target></link><space/>rules requiring the road team to wear uniforms that contrast with the uniforms worn by the home team. Due to this rule, the gray uniforms are worn when the home team chooses to wear navy blue, and sometimes when the home team chooses to wear black.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Logos</heading><paragraph>From 1912 to 1989 the Braves logo consisted of the head of a Native American. From 1912 to 1956 it was a Native American with a headdress, and thereafter a laughing Native American with a mohawk and one feather in his hair. In 1990 the logo was changed to just the word &quot;Braves&quot; in cursive with a tomahawk below it.<template><target>see</target><arg>Native American mascot controversy#Atlanta Braves</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>Achievements</heading><heading level='3'>Awards</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Atlanta Braves award winners and league leaders</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='3'>Team records</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>List of Atlanta Braves team records</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='3'>Team captains</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Johnny Evers</target></link><space/>1914-1917</listitem><listitem><link><target>Eddie Matthews</target></link><space/>1965-1966</listitem><listitem><link><target>Hank Aaron</target></link><space/>1969-1976</listitem><listitem><link><target>Dale Murphy</target></link><space/>1987-1990</listitem></list><heading level='3'>Retired numbers</heading><paragraph><template><target>See also</target><arg>List of Major League Baseball retired numbers</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>The Braves have retired eleven numbers in the history of the franchise, including most recently<space/><link><target>Chipper Jones</target></link>' number 10 in 2013,<space/><link><target>John Smoltz</target></link>'s number 29 in 2012,<space/><link><target>Bobby Cox</target></link>'s number 6 in 2011,<space/><link><target>Tom Glavine</target></link>'s number 47 in 2010, and<space/><link><target>Greg Maddux</target></link>'s number 31 in 2009.
