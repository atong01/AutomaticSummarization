He sends a gang of thugs, led by his flunky assistant Taggart (<link><target>Slim Pickens</target></link>), to scare them away, prompting the townsfolk to demand that Governor William J.<space/><link><target>Le Petomane</target></link><space/>(<link><target>Mel Brooks</target></link>) appoint a new<space/><link><target>Sheriffs in the United States</target><part>sheriff</part></link>.

He defeats and befriends Mongo (<link><target>Alex Karras</target></link>), an immensely strong, slow-thinking (but surprisingly philosophical) henchman sent by Taggart and Lyle to kill Bart, and then beats German seductress-for-hire Lili von Shtupp (<link><target>Madeline Kahn</target></link>) at her own game. Lamarr is furious that his plans keep failing and decides to destroy Rock Ridge with a newly recruited and diverse army of thugs.</paragraph><paragraph>Bart gathers the town, along with the railroad workers, three miles east of Rock Ridge to build a fake town as a diversion. The workers labor all night to build a perfect replica, but with no people in it Bart realises it won't fool Lamarr's villains. Ordering the townspeople to make &quot;exact replicas of themselves,&quot; Bart leaves with Jim and Mongo to construct a tollbooth. The booth delays the raiding party when they have to go back for &quot;a shitload of dimes.&quot;</paragraph><paragraph>Once through the tollbooth, Lamarr's villains attack the fake town populated with dummies, which Bart boobytrapped with several dynamite bombs. Bart tries setting off the bombs but is unsuccessful as the detonator does not work. Jim is given the task of exploding the bombs, and fires his pistol at them. After the bombs explode, launching bad guys skyward, the Rock Ridgers attack the villains.</paragraph><paragraph>The resulting fight between the townsfolk and Lamarr's army of thugs breaks the<space/><link><target>fourth wall</target></link>, literally. The fight spills out from the Warner Bros. film lot into a neighboring musical set being directed by Buddy Bizarre (<link><target>Dom DeLuise</target></link>), then into the studio<space/><link><target>Refectory</target><part>commissary</part></link>, and ultimately into the surrounding streets (specifically, Olive Avenue in<space/><link><target>Burbank, California</target><part>Burbank</part></link>).

Unfortunately, he sees on the movie screen that Bart has arrived outside the theatre. Bart ends up killing Lamarr by shooting him in the groin. Bart and Jim then go into the theatre to watch the end of the film, where Bart decides to leave Rock Ridge, much to the sadness of the townspeople and the railroad workers, for his work there is done. As he rides off, he finds Jim (who still has the popcorn that he bought at the theatre), and the two decide to go off to &quot;nowhere special.&quot; They ride a short distance out of town, hand their horses off to the movie's<space/><link><target>Wrangler (profession)</target><part>wranglers</part></link><space/>and are driven away in a limousine into the sunset.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Cast</heading><paragraph><template><target>col-begin</target></template><template><target>col-break</target></template></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Cleavon Little</target></link><space/>as Sheriff Bart</listitem><listitem><link><target>Gene Wilder</target></link><space/>as Jim, the &quot;Waco Kid&quot;</listitem><listitem><link><target>Harvey Korman</target></link><space/>as Hedley Lamarr</listitem><listitem><link><target>Madeline Kahn</target></link><space/>as Lili von Shtupp, the &quot;Teutonic Titwillow&quot;</listitem><listitem><link><target>Slim Pickens</target></link><space/>as Taggart</listitem><listitem><link><target>Dom DeLuise</target></link><space/>as Buddy Bizarre</listitem><listitem><link><target>Mel Brooks</target></link><space/>as Gov.

Whether good, bad or mild, nothing was thrown out. [[Woody Allen]]'s comedy, though very much a product of our Age of Analysis, recalls the wonder and discipline of people like [[Buster Keaton|Keaton]] and [[Laurel and Hardy]]. Mr. Brooks's sights are lower. His brashness is rare, but his use of anachronism and anarchy recalls not the great film comedies of the past, but the middling ones like the Hope-Crosby [[Road to...|"Road" pictures]].
