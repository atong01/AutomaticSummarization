The United States government evacuated hundreds more Aleuts from the western chain and the Pribilofs during WWII, placing them in internment camps in southeast Alaska, where many died. The<space/><link><target>Aleut Restitution Act of 1988</target></link><space/>was an attempt by<space/><link><target>United States Congress</target><part>Congress</part></link><space/>to compensate the survivors. There is a book written by Nick L. Golodoff called &quot;Attu Boy&quot; that describes his imprisonment by the Japanese. Overview of the book, &quot;In the quiet of morning, exactly six months after Pearl Harbor, the Japanese touched down on American soil. Landing on the remote Alaska island of Attu, they assailed an entire village, holding the Alaskan villagers for two months and eventually corralling all survivors into a freighter bound for Japan. One of those survivors, Nick Golodoff, became a prisoner of war at just six years old. He was among the dozens of Unangan Attu residents swept away to Hokkaido, and one of only twenty-five to survive. Attu Boy tells Golodoffs story of these harrowing years as he found both friendship and cruelty at the hands of the Japanese. It offers a rare look at the lives of civilian prisoners and their captors in WWII-era Japan. It also tells of Golodoffs bittersweet return to a homeland torn apart by occupation and forced internments. Interwoven with other voices from Attu, this richly illustrated memoir is a testament to the struggles, triumphs, and heartbreak of lives disrupted by war. &quot;</paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>Aleutian Islands campaign</target><part>World War II campaign</part></link><space/>by the United States to retake Attu and Kiska was a significant component of the operations in the<space/><link><target>Pacific Ocean theater of World War II</target><part>Pacific theater</part></link>.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Recorded uprising</heading><paragraph>In May 1784, local Aleut revolted on Amchitka against the Russian traders. The Russians had a small trading post there. According to what Aleut people said, in an account recorded by Japanese castaways and published in 2004, otters were decreasing year by year. Their share in the return for the furs they made also were decreasing, as Russian ships stopped coming to the island. The Japanese learned that the Aleut felt the situation was at crisis. The leading Aleuts negotiated with the Russians, saying they had failed to deliver enough supplies in return for furs. Nezimov, leader of the Russians ordered two of his men, Stephano () and Kazhimov () to kill his mistress Oniishin (), who was the Aleut chief's daughter, because he doubted that Oniishin had tried to dissuade her father and other leaders from pushing for more goods.</paragraph><paragraph>That evening, hundreds of Aleut men gathered on a mountain and marched to the Russians' houses. When five Russians opened fire, the Aleuts ran away. The next day the Aleut returned, but escaped again when the Russians started firing. While the men attempted another attack the next day, they yelled and moved more quickly towards the house. As Russians opened fire, they started to run away again. After they ran, Russians noticed that all the men had left the village. The Russians took around 40 women and children hostage, forcing the Aleut to surrender. The Russians killed four Aleut leaders.</paragraph><paragraph>After they had been killed, the Aleut began to move from Amchitka to neighboring islands.Nevizimov, leader of the Russian group, was jailed after the whole incident was reported to Russian officials.<extension extension_name='ref' name="kodayu">Yamashita, Tsuneo.<space/><italics>Daikokuya Kodayu</italics>(Japanese), 2004.

Historically carving was a male art and leadership attribute; in todays world it is an art of both sexes. Most commonly the carvings of ivory and wood originated as part of making hunting weapons. Other carvings depicted the animals of their world, which were so important: such as seals and whales.

The tradition began in prehistoric times. The main method of basketry was false embroidery (overlay). Strands of grasses or reeds were overlaid upon the basic weaving surface, to obtain a plastic effect. Basketry was an art reserved for women.<extension extension_name='ref' name="AAUA"></extension><space/>Early Aleut women created baskets and woven mats of exceptional technical quality, using only their thumbnail, grown long and then sharpened, as a tool. Today, Aleut weavers continue to produce woven grass pieces of a remarkable cloth-like texture, works of modern art with roots in ancient tradition. Birch bark, puffin feathers, and baleen are also commonly used by the Aleut in basketry. The Aleut term for grass basket is<space/><italics>qiigam aygaaxsii</italics>.

The<space/><link><target>Atka people</target></link><space/>believed that another people lived in their land before them. They portrayed such ancients in their masks, which show anthropomorphic creatures named in their language. Knut Bergsland says their word means like those found in caves. Masks were generally carved from wood and were decorated with paints made from berries or other natural products. Feathers were inserted into holes carved out for extra decoration. These masks were used in ceremonies ranging from dances to praises, each with its own meaning and purpose.<extension extension_name='ref' name="AAUA"></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Tattoos and piercings</heading><paragraph>The tattoos and piercings of the Aleut people demonstrated accomplishments as well as their religious views. They believed their body art would please the spirits of the animals and make any evil go away. The body orifices were believed to be pathways for the entry of evil entities. By piercing their orifices: the nose, the mouth, and ears, they would stop evil entities,<space/><italics>khoughkh</italics>, from entering their bodies (Osborn, 52). Body art also enhanced their beauty, social status, and spiritual authority.</paragraph><paragraph>Before the 19th century, piercings and tattoos were very common among the Aleut people, especially among women. Piercings, such as the nose pin, were common among both men and women and were usually performed a few days after birth. The ornament was made of various materials, a piece of bark or bone, or an eagles feather shaft. From time to time, adult women decorated the nose pins by hanging pieces of amber and coral from strings on it; the semi-precious objects dangled down to their chins.</paragraph><paragraph>Piercing ears was also very common. The Aleuts pierced holes around the rim of their ears with dentalium shells (tooth shells or tusk shells), bone, feathers, dried bird wings or skulls and/or amber. Materials associated with birds were important, as birds were considered to defend animals in the spirit world. A male would wear sea lion whiskers in his ears as a trophy of his expertise as a hunter. Worn for decorative reasons, and sometimes to signify social standing, reputation, and the age of the wearer, Aleuts would pierce their lower lips with walrus ivory and wear beads or bones. The individual with the most piercings held the highest respect.</paragraph><paragraph>Tattooing for women began when they reached physical maturity, or menstruation, at about age 20. Men traditionally received their first tattoo after killing their first animal, another rite of passage. Sometimes tattoos signaled social class. For example, the daughter of a rich, famous ancestor or father would work hard at her tattoos to show the accomplishments of that ancestor or father. They would sew, or prick, different designs on the chin, the side of the face, or under the nose.</paragraph><paragraph>The Russians arrived in the Aleutian Islands in 1786 and were active there, with small trading settlements and religious missions, through the mid-19th century. They often enslaved the natives, forcing them to work for them. Their influence disrupted Aleut life, and many of the traditional customs disappeared.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="last">Krutak</arg><arg name="first">Lars</arg><arg name="title">Tattooing and Piercing among the Alaskan Aleut</arg><arg name="url">http://www.larskrutak.com/articles/Aleut/</arg><arg name="accessdate">28 April 2011</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Aleut clothing</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Aleut sax.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Imitation of the ''sax'', a traditional Aleut coat made from bird skins and sea otter fur.</part></link><link><target>File:Parka (Kamleika) Aleutian Islands.JPG</target><part>thumb</part><part>A<space/><link><target>Kamleika</target></link>, or seal skin coat</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>The Aleut people developed in one of the harshest climates in the world, and learned to create and protect warmth. Both men and women wore parkas that extended below the knees. The women wore the skin of seal or sea-otter, and the men wore bird skin parkas, the feathers turned in or out depending on the weather. When the men were hunting on the water, they wore waterproof parkas made from seal or sea-lion guts, or the entrails of bear, walrus, or whales. Parkas had a hood that could be cinched, as could the wrist openings, so water could not get in. Men wore breeches made from the esophageal skin of seals. Children wore parkas made of downy eagle skin with tanned bird skin caps.<extension extension_name='ref'><italics>Enthnohistory</italics>: Gross &amp; Khera pg. 33, 34</extension><space/>They called these parkas<space/><italics>kameikas,</italics><space/>meaning raingear in the English language.(Aleut Corp.

The men brought home the skins and prepared them by soaking them in urine and stretching them. The women undertook the sewing (<italics>Enthnohistory:</italics><space/>Gross &amp; Khera pg. 32). Preparation of the gut for clothing involved several steps. The prepared intestines were turned inside out. A bone knife was used to remove the muscle tissue and fat from the walls of the intestine. The gut was cut and stretched, and fastened to stakes to dry. It was then cut and sewn to make waterproof parkas, bags, and other receptacles (Turner, Ch. 5, pg. 70). On some hunting trips, the men would take several women with them. They would catch birds and prepare the carcasses and feathers for future use. They caught Puffins, Lunda Cirrhata, Fratercula Corniculata, Guillemots, and Cephus &amp; Murres.<extension extension_name='ref'>Lucien M.

There were three main kinds of harpoon that the Aleuts used: a simple harpoon, with a head that kept its original position in the animal after striking, a compound (toggle-head) harpoon in which the head took a horizontal position in the animal after penetration, and the throwing-lance used to kill large animals.<extension extension_name='ref' name="AIA"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The simple Aleut harpoon consisted of four main parts: the wooden shaft, the bone foreshaft, and the bonehead (tip) with barbs pointed backward. The barbed head was loosely fitted into the socket of the foreshaft so that when the animal was stabbed, it pulled the head away from the rest of the harpoon. The sharp barbs penetrated with ease, but could not be pulled out. The bone tip is fastened to a length of braided twine meanwhile; the hunter held the other end of the twine in his hand.<extension extension_name='ref' name="AIA"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The compound harpoon was the most prevalent weapon of the Aleut people. Also known as the toggle-head spear, it was about the same size as the simple harpoon and used to hunt the same animals, however, this harpoon provided a more efficient and lethal weapon. This harpoon separated into four parts. The longest part was the shaft with the thicker stalk closer to the tip of the harpoon. The shaft was fitted into the socket of the fore shaft and a bone ring was then placed over the joint to hold the two pieces together, as well as, protecting the wooden shaft from splitting. Connected to the fore shaft of the harpoon is the toggle head spear tip. This tip was made of two sub shafts that break apart on impact with an animal. The upper sub shaft held the razor stone head and attached to the lower sub shaft with a small braided twine loop. Once the tip penetrates the animal the upper sub head broke off from the rest of the shaft, however, since it was still connected with the braided loop it rotated the head into a horizontal position inside the animals body so that it could not get away from the hunter.<extension extension_name='ref' name="AIA"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The throwing-lance may be distinguished from a harpoon because of the fact that all its pieces are fixed and immovable. A lance is formerly a weapon of war and it was also used to kill large marine animals after it has already been harpooned. The Throwing lance usually consisted of three parts: a wooden shaft, a bone ring or belt, and the compound head that was made with a barbed bonehead and a stone tip. The length of the compound head was equivalent to the distance between the planes of a mans chest to his back. The lance would penetrate the chest and pass through the chest cavity and exit from the back. The bone ring was designed to break after impact so that the shaft could be used again for another kill.<extension extension_name='ref' name="AIA"></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Burial practices</heading><paragraph><link><target>Archeologists</target></link><space/>have found many different types of burials, dating from a variety of periods, in the Aleutian Islands.
