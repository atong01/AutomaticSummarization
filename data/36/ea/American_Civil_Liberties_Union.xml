Local affiliates of the ACLU are active in all 50 states and Puerto Rico. The ACLU provides legal assistance in cases when it considers<space/><link><target>civil liberties</target></link><space/>to be at risk. Legal support from the ACLU can take the form of direct legal representation, or preparation of<space/><italics><link><target>amicus curiae</target></link></italics><space/><link><target>brief (law)</target><part>briefs</part></link><space/>expressing legal arguments (when another law firm is already providing representation).</paragraph><paragraph>When the ACLU was founded in 1920, its focus was on<space/><link><target>freedom of speech</target></link>, primarily for anti-war protesters. During the 1920s, the ACLU expanded its scope to include protecting the free speech rights of artists and striking workers, and working with the<space/><link><target>National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</target></link><space/>(NAACP) to decrease<space/><link><target>racism</target></link><space/>and discrimination. During the 1930s, the ACLU started to engage in work combating<space/><link><target>police misconduct</target></link><space/>and for<space/><link><target>Native American rights</target></link>. Most of the ACLU's cases came from the<space/><link><target>Communist Party of the United States</target><part>Communist party</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Jehovah's Witnesses</target></link>. In 1940, the ACLU leadership was caught up in the<space/><link><target>Red Scare</target></link>, and voted to exclude<space/><link><target>Communist</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>from its leadership positions. During<space/><link><target>World War II</target></link>, the ACLU defended Japanese-American citizens, unsuccessfully trying to prevent their forcible relocation to<space/><link><target>Japanese American internment</target><part>internment camps</part></link>. During the<space/><link><target>Cold War</target></link>, the ACLU headquarters was dominated by anti-communists, but many local affiliates defended members of the Communist Party.</paragraph><paragraph>By 1964, membership had risen to 80,000, and the ACLU participated in efforts to expand<space/><link><target>civil liberties</target></link>. In the 1960s, the ACLU continued its decades-long effort to enforce<space/><link><target>separation of church and state</target></link>. It defended several<space/><link><target>anti-war activist</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>during the<space/><link><target>Vietnam War</target></link>. The ACLU was involved in the<space/><italics><link><target>Miranda v.

United States</target><part>New York Times</part></link></italics><space/>case, which established new protections for newspapers reporting on government activities. In the 1970s and 1980s, the ACLU ventured into new legal areas, defending homosexuals, students, prisoners, and the poor. In the twenty-first century, the ACLU has fought the teaching of<space/><link><target>creationism</target></link><space/>in public schools and challenged some provisions of<space/><link><target>Patriot Act</target><part>anti-terrorism legislation</part></link><space/>as infringing on privacy and civil liberties.</paragraph><paragraph>In addition to representing persons and organizations in lawsuits, the ACLU lobbies for policies that have been established by its board of directors.

The Court ruled in favor of the ACLU, stating that, &quot;the LAPD cannot arrest people for sitting, lying, or sleeping on public sidewalks in Skid Row.&quot; Enforcement of section 41.18(d) 24 hours a day against persons who have nowhere else to sit, lie, or sleep, other than on public streets and sidewalks, is breaking these amendments. The Court said that the anti-camping ordinance is &quot;one of the most restrictive municipal laws regulating public spaces in the United States&quot;. Jones and the ACLU wanted a compromise in which the LAPD is barred from enforcing section 41.18(d) (arrest, seizure, and imprisonment) in Skid Row between the hours of 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. and 6:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. The compromise plan permits the homeless to sleep on the sidewalk, provided they are not &quot;within 10 feet of any business or residential entrance&quot; and only between these hours. One of the motivations for the compromise is the shortage of space in the prison system. Downtown development business interests and the Central City Association (CCA) were against the compromise. Police Chief William Bratton said the case had slowed the police effort to fight crime and clean up Skid Row, and that when he was allowed to clean up Skid Row, real estate profited.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/444/444.F3d.1118.04-55324.html</arg><arg name="title">444 F.3d 1118</arg><arg name="publisher">Bulk.resource.org</arg><arg name="accessdate">August 15, 2012</arg></template></extension><space/>On September 20, 2006, the Los Angeles City Council voted to reject the compromise.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite news</target><arg name="url">http://articles.latimes.com/2006/sep/20/opinion/oe-westwater20</arg><arg name="title">Handing skid row to the drug dealers</arg><arg name="work">Los Angeles Times</arg><arg name="date">September 20, 2006</arg><arg name="accessdate">August 15, 2012</arg><arg name="first">Brady</arg><arg name="last">Westwater</arg></template></extension><space/>On October 3, 2006, police arrested Skid Row's transients for sleeping on the streets for the first time in months.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://colorlines.com/archives/2007/10/lapd_gentrifies_skid_row.html</arg><arg name="title">LAPD Gentrifies Skid Row</arg><arg name="publisher">Colorlines</arg><arg name="date">October 3, 2007</arg><arg name="accessdate">August 15, 2012</arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite news</target><arg name="last">Fox<space/></arg><arg name="first">Margalit<space/></arg><arg name="url">http://articles.boston.com/keyword/skid-row<space/></arg><arg name="title">Articles about Skid Row<space/></arg><arg name="work">The Boston Globe<space/></arg><arg name="date">December 1, 2011<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">August 15, 2012<space/></arg><arg name="deadurl">yes<space/></arg><arg name="archiveurl">https://web.archive.org/20140725103459/http://articles.boston.com/keyword/skid-row<space/></arg><arg name="archivedate">25 July 2014<space/></arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>In 2006, the ACLU of Washington State joined with a pro-gun rights organization, the<space/><link><target>Second Amendment Foundation</target></link>, and prevailed in a lawsuit against the North Central Regional Library District (NCRL) in Washington for its policy of refusing to disable restrictions upon an adult patron's request.
