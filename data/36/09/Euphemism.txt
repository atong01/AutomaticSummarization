A '''euphemism''' is a generally innocuous word or expression used in place of one that may be found [[Profanity|offensive]] or suggest something unpleasant.<ref>{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/euphemism |title=Euphemism |dictionary=Webster's Online Dictionary}}</ref> Some euphemisms are intended to amuse; while others use bland, inoffensive terms for things the user wishes to downplay. Euphemisms are used to refer to [[Taboo word|taboo topics]] (such as disability, sex, excretion, and death) in a polite way, or to mask [[profanity]].<ref>{{cite web|title=euphemism (n.) |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=euphemism |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=7 January 2014}}</ref>

There are three [[Opposite (semantics)|antonyms]] of euphemism: ''[[dysphemism]]'', ''[[dysphemism|cacophemism]]'', and ''[[loaded language]]''. Dysphemism can be either offensive or merely ironic; cacophemism is deliberately offensive. Loaded language evokes a visceral response beyond the meaning of the words.

==Etymology==
''Euphemism'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|εὐφημία}} (''euphemia''), meaning "the use of words of good omen", which in turn is derived from the Greek root-words ''eû'' ({{lang|grc|εὖ}}), "good, well" and ''phḗmē'' (φήμη) "prophetic speech; rumour, talk".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=fh/mh φήμη], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref>  Etymologically, the ''eupheme'' is the opposite of the ''[[blasphemy|blaspheme]]'' "evil-speaking." The term ''euphemism'' itself was used as a euphemism by the ancient Greeks, meaning "to keep a holy silence" (speaking well by not speaking at all).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=euphemism&allowed_in_frame=0|title=''Euphemism" Etymology|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref>

==Formation==

===Phonetic modification===

Phonetic euphemism is used to replace profanities, giving them the intensity of a mere interjection.
* Shortening or "clipping" the term ("Jeez" for Jesus, "What the—" for "What the hell")
* Mispronunciations, such as "[[Frak (expletive)|Frak]]", "[[Frig (interjection)|Frig]]" "What the fudge", "What the truck", "Oh my gosh", "Frickin", "Darn", "Oh, shoot", "Be-yotch", etc.
* Using the first letter ("SOB", "What the eff", "BS"). Sometimes, the word "word" is added after it ("F word", "S word", "B word"). Also, the letter can be phonetically respelled, for example, the word "piss" was shortened to "pee" in this way.

===Figures of speech===
* [[Ambiguous]] statements (''it'' for excrement, ''the situation'' or "a girl in trouble" for pregnancy, ''going to the other side'' for death, ''do it'' or ''come together'' in reference to a [[Sexual intercourse#In humans|sexual act]], ''[[tired and emotional]]'' for drunkenness)
* [[Understatement]]s ("asleep" for "dead", "drinking" for "consuming alcohol", "hurt" for "injured", etc.)
* [[Metaphor]]s ("beat the meat", "choke the chicken", "take a dump", "drain the main vein").
* Comparisons ("buns" for "buttocks", "weed" for "cannabis").
* [[Metonymy]] ("lose a person" for "coping with a person's death", "pass away" for "die", "men's room" for "men's toilet").

===Rhetoric===
Euphemism may be used as a [[Rhetorical strategies|rhetorical strategy]], in which case its goal is to change the [[Valence (psychology)|valence]] of a description from positive to negative.

===Slang===
Using a less harsh term with similar meaning. For instance, "screwed up" is a euphemism for "fucked up"; "hook-up", "we hooked up", or "laid" for [[sexual intercourse]]

There is some disagreement over whether certain terms are or are not euphemisms. For example, sometimes the phrase ''visually impaired'' is labeled as a [[political correctness|politically correct]] euphemism for ''blind''. However, [[visual impairment]] can be a broader term, including, for example, people who have partial sight in one eye, those with uncorrectable mild to moderate poor vision, or even those who wear glasses, a group that would be excluded by the word ''blind''.

===Evolution===<!-- [[Euphemism treadmill]] redirects here. -->
Euphemisms may be formed in a number of ways. [[Periphrasis]], or [[circumlocution]], is one of the most common: to "speak around" a given word, [[Implicature|implying]] it without saying it. Over time, circumlocutions become recognized as established euphemisms for particular words or ideas.

To alter the pronunciation or spelling of a taboo word (such as a [[swear word]]) to form a euphemism is known as ''taboo deformation'', or "minced oath". In [[American English]], words that are unacceptable on television such as ''[[fuck]]'', may be represented by deformations such as ''freak'', even in children's cartoons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fcc.gov/guides/obscenity-indecency-and-profanity |title=Obscene, Indecent and Profane Broadcasts |publisher=U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] |work=FCC.gov |accessdate=2014-01-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209153728/http://www.fcc.gov/guides/obscenity-indecency-and-profanity |archivedate=2013-12-09 |deadurl=no}}</ref>  Some examples of [[rhyming slang]] may serve the same purpose: to call a person a ''berk'' sounds less offensive than to call a person a ''[[cunt]]'', though ''berk'' is short for ''[[Berkeley Hunt]]'', which rhymes with ''cunt''.<ref>http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/berk Collins Dictionary, definition of "berk"/"burk", retrieved 22 July 2014.</ref>

[[Bureaucracy|Bureaucracies]] frequently spawn euphemisms of a more deliberate nature, ''[[doublespeak]]'' expressions. For example, in the past the US military called contamination by [[Radionuclide|radioactive isotopes]] ''[[sunshine units]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McCool |first=W.C. | publication-date = 1957-02-06 |title=Return of Rongelapese to their Home Island&nbsp;— Note by the Secretary |publisher=[[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] |url=http://worf.eh.doe.gov/ihp/chron/A43.PDF |accessdate=2007-11-07}}</ref>  A practical death sentence in the Soviet Union during the [[Great Purge]] often used the clause "imprisonment ''without right to correspondence'':" the person sentenced never had a chance to correspond because soon after imprisonment he would be shot.<ref>Solzhenitsyn, Alexander (1974). The Gulag Archipelago I. New York, NY: Harper Perennial. p. 6. ISBN 0-06-092103-X</ref> As early as 1939, Nazi official [[Reinhard Heydrich]] used the term [[Sonderbehandlung]] (translated into English as "special treatment") to mean [[summary execution]], most likely by hanging, of persons who proved 'disciplinary problems' to the Nazis even before the Nazis began the [[Holocaust|systematic extermination of the Jews]]. Heinrich Himmler, aware that the word had come to be known to mean murder, replaced that euphemism with one in which Jews would be "guided" (to their deaths) through the slave-labor and extermination camps.<ref>http://www.holocaust-history.org/quick-facts/special-treatment.shtml</ref> after having been "evacuated" to their doom. Such was part of the superficially-innocuous formulation [[Endlösung der Judenfrage]] which became infamous to the entire world during the Nuremberg Trials.<ref>http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005477</ref>

A euphemism may often devolve into a taboo word itself, through the linguistic process known as ''pejoration'' or ''[[semantic change]]'' described by [[W.V.O. Quine]],<ref>{{cite book|first=W.V. |last=Quine |title=Quiddities |publisher=[[Belknap Press]] |year=1987 |pages=53–54}}</ref> and more recently dubbed the "euphemism treadmill" by Harvard professor [[Steven Pinker]].<ref>{{cite news|archiveurl=https://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-04-06/news/1994096202_1_dutch-words-language |title=The game of the name |newspaper=Baltimore Sun |archivedate=1994-04-06 |url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/1994_04_03_newyorktimes.pdf |date=1994-04-03 |accessdate=2011-01-19}}</ref> For instance, ''Toilet'' is an 18th-century euphemism, replacing the older euphemism ''House-of-Office'', which in turn replaced the even older euphemisms ''privy-house'' or ''bog-house''.<ref name="Bell 1953">{{cite book|last=Bell |first=Vicars Walker |title=On Learning the English Tongue |year=1953 |publisher=Faber & Faber |quote=The Honest Jakes or Privy has graduated via Offices to the final horror of Toilet. |page=19}}</ref><!--|url=http://books.google.co.nz/books?id=1-8WAAAAIAAJ&q=toilet#search_anchor--> In the 20th century, where the words ''lavatory'' or ''[[toilet]]'' were deemed inappropriate (e.g. in the United States), they were sometimes replaced with ''bathroom'' or ''water closet,'' which in turn became ''restroom'', ''W.C.'', or ''washroom''. The [[S-word]] appears to have originally been a euphemism for defecation in Pre-Germanic, as the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European root]] *''skined-'', from which it was derived, meant to cut off.<ref name="ringe">{{cite book| last=Ringe |first=Don | authorlink=Donald Ringe| title=From Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic|publisher=Oxford University Press  |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-19-955229-0}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
{{Main|Doublespeak}}

Doublespeak is a term sometimes used for deliberate euphemistic misuse of incorrect words to disguise unacceptable [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]], as in a "Ministry of Peace" which wages war, a "Ministry of Love" which imprisons and tortures. It is a portmanteau of the terms "[[newspeak]]" and "[[doublethink]]", which originate from George Orwell's novel ''[[1984 (book)|1984]]''.

The "[[Dead Parrot sketch]]" from ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' contains an extensive list of euphemisms for death, including many cited above, referring to the deceased parrot that the character played by [[John Cleese]] had purchased.

The word euphemism itself can be used as a euphemism. In the animated TV special ''[[Halloween Is Grinch Night]]'' (See [[Dr. Seuss]]), a child asks to go to the ''euphemism'', where ''euphemism'' is being used as a euphemism for ''[[outhouse]]''. This euphemistic use of "euphemism" also occurred in the play ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' where a character requests, "Martha, will you show her where we keep the, uh, euphemism?"

In Wes Anderson's film ''[[Fantastic Mr. Fox (film)|Fantastic Mr. Fox]]'', the replacement of swear words by the word "cuss" became a humorous motif throughout the film.

In [[Tom Hanks]]' web series ''[[Electric City (web series)|Electric City]]'', the use of profanity has been censored by the word "expletive".

In [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[Foundation series]], the curses of the scientist [[Ebling Mis]] have all been replaced with the word "unprintable". In fact, there is only one case of his curses being referred to as such, leading some readers to mistakenly assume that the euphemism is Ebling's, rather than Asimov's. The same word has also been used in his short story "[[Flies (Asimov short story)|Flies]]".
