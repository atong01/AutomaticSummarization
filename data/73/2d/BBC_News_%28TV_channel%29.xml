Sky News claimed that a number of British cable operators had been incentivised to carry News 24 (which, as a licence-fee funded channel was made available to such operators for free) in preference to the commercial Sky News. However, in September 1999 the<space/><link><target>European Commission</target></link><space/>ruled against a complaint made by Sky News that the publicly funded channel was unfair and illegal under EU law. The Commission ruled that the<space/><link><target>Television licence</target><part>licence fee</part></link><space/>should be considered state aid but that such aid was justified due to the public service remit of the BBC and that it did not exceed actual costs.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.reckon.co.uk/open/BBC_News_24'>BBC News 24 (State aid)</link><space/>Reckon Regulation &amp; Competition Economics LLP</extension></paragraph><paragraph>The channel's journalistic output has been overseen by Controller of the channel,<space/><link><target>Kevin Bakhurst</target></link>, since 16 December 2005.

The new designs also featured a dynamic set of titles for the channel; the globe would begin spinning from where the main story was taking place, while the headline scrolled around in a ribbon; this was occasionally replaced by the BBC News logo. The titles concluded with a red globe surrounded by a red stylised clamshell and BBC News ribbons forming above the BBC News logo.</paragraph><paragraph>Bulletins on BBC One moved into a new set in January 2003 although retained the previous ivory Lambie-Nairn titles until February 2004.

Various images, originally ivory numbers fully animated against a deep red background, were designed to fit the pace of the channel, and the music soon gained notoriety, and was often satirised and parodied in popular culture, perhaps most famously by comic<space/><link><target>Bill Bailey</target></link><space/>who likened the theme music to an &quot;apocalyptic<space/><link><target>rave</target></link>&quot;. Images of life around the UK were added in replacement later with the same music, together with footage of the newsroom and exterior of Television Centre. The 2003 relaunch saw a small change to this style with less of a metropolitan feel to the footage.</paragraph><paragraph>A new sequence was introduced on 28 March 2005, designed and created by<space/><link><target>Red Bee Media</target></link><space/>and directed by Mark Chaudoir. The full version ran for 60 seconds, though only around 30 seconds were usually shown on air. The music was revised completely but the biggest change came in the footage used reflecting the methods and nature of newsgathering, while a strong emphasis was placed on the BBC logo itself. Satellite dishes are shown transmitting and receiving red &quot;data streams&quot;. In production of the countdown sequence, Clive Norman filmed images around the United Kingdom, Richard Jopson in the United States, while BBC News cameramen filmed images from<space/><link><target>Iraq</target></link>, Beijing (<link><target>Great Wall of China</target></link>),<space/><link><target>Bund of Shanghai</target></link>, Africa, as well as areas affected by the<space/><link><target>2004 Indian Ocean earthquake</target><part>2004 Asian Tsunami</part></link><space/>and others.</paragraph><paragraph>The sequence has since seen several remixes to the music and a change in visuals to focus more on the well-known journalists, with less footage of camera crews and production teams. Changes have also seen the channel logo included during the sequences and at the end, as well as the fonts used for the time. The conclusion of the countdown was altered in 2008 to feature the new presentation style, rather than a data stream moving in towards the camera. Also in 2008, the graphic for the countdown changed, resembling<space/><link><target>BBC One Rhythm and Movement Idents</target></link>, due to the logo being in a red square in inferior-left corner.</paragraph><paragraph>To coincide with the move of BBC News to<space/><link><target>Broadcasting House#Second phase</target><part>Broadcasting House</part></link>, on 18 March 2013 the countdown was updated again along with several other presentation elements. Three of the most striking features of the new countdown include music performed by the<space/><link><target>BBC Concert Orchestra</target></link>, a redesign of the &quot;data streams&quot; and the ending of the sequence no longer fading to the BBC News globe and logo, but instead stopping with a time-lapse shot outside the corporation's headquarters. The countdown was also extended back to 90 seconds, of which approximately 86 were seen before the first hour from Broadcasting House.</paragraph><paragraph>A full three-minute version of the countdown music was made available on<space/><link><target>BBC News Online</target></link><space/>and David Lowe's own website after a remix on 16 May 2006.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/4992088.stm'>News 24 'releases' countdown music</link><space/>BBC News Online, 18 May 2006</extension></paragraph><paragraph>An international version of the countdown was launched on BBC World News on 5 September 2005 featuring more international content and similar music. Various changes have been made to the music and visuals since then, with presentation following the style of BBC News. The visuals in the sequence were updated on 10 May 2010. In June 2011, further imagery was added relating to recent events, including the conflict in Libya and views of outside 10 Downing Street.
