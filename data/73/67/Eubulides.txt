'''Eubulides''' ({{lang-el|Εὑβουλίδης}}; fl. 4th century BCE) of [[Miletus]] was a [[philosopher]] of the [[Megarian school]], and a pupil of [[Euclid of Megara]].  He is famous for his [[paradox]]es.

==Life==
Eubulides was a pupil of [[Euclid of Megara]],<ref name="diog1">Diogenes Laërtius, ii. 108</ref> the founder of the [[Megarian school]]. He was a contemporary of [[Aristotle]], against whom he wrote with great bitterness.<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, ii. 109; Athenaeus, viii, 50 354c; Aristocles, in Eusebius ''[[Praeparatio Evangelica]]'' xv. 2</ref> He taught logic to [[Demosthenes]],<ref>Plutarch, ''Vit. X Orat.''; Apuleius, ''Orat. de Mag.''; Photius, ''Bibliotheca'', 265</ref> and he is also said to have taught [[Apollonius Cronus]], the teacher of [[Diodorus Cronus]], and the historian [[Euphantus]]. He may have been the author of a book about [[Diogenes of Sinope]].<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 20. However, there may be confusion with an unknown "Eubulus" who is mentioned as an author of work about Diogenes at vi. 30</ref>

==Paradoxes of Eubulides==
Eubulides is most famous for inventing the forms of seven famous [[paradoxes]],<ref name="diog1"/><ref>{{cite web| url=http://philosophy.about.com/od/Philosophical-Questions-Puzzle/a/Paradoxes-Of-Eubulides.htm |title=Paradoxes of Eubulides |publisher=About.com (New York Times)  |author=Andrea Borghini |accessdate=2012-09-04}}</ref> some of which, however, are also ascribed to [[Diodorus Cronus]]:<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, ii. 111</ref>
#[[Liar paradox|The Liar (''pseudomenos'') paradox]]:<br>A man says: "What I am saying now is a [[lie]]." If the statement is true, then he is lying, even though the statement is true. If the statement is a lie, then he is not actually lying, even though the statement is a lie. Thus, if the speaker is lying, he tells the truth, and vice versa.
#The Masked Man (''egkekalummenos'') paradox:<br>"Do you know this masked man?" "No." "But he is your father. So - do you not know your own father?"
#The Electra (''Elektra'') paradox:<br>[[Electra]] doesn't know that the man approaching her is her brother, [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]].  Electra knows her brother.  Does Electra know the man who is approaching?
#The Overlooked Man (''dialanthanôn'') paradox:<br>Alpha ignored the man approaching him and treated him as a stranger.  The man was his father.  Did Alpha ignore his own father and treat him as a stranger?
#[[Sorites paradox|The Heap (''sôritês'') paradox]]:<br>A single grain of sand is certainly not a heap.  Nor is the addition of a single grain of sand enough to transform a non-heap into a heap: when we have a collection of grains of sand that is not a heap, then adding but one single grain will not create a heap. And yet we know that at some point we will have a heap.
#The Bald Man (''phalakros'') paradox:<br>A man with a full head of hair is obviously not bald.  Now the removal of a single hair will not turn a non-bald man into a bald one.  And yet it is obvious that a continuation of that process must eventually result in baldness.
#The Horns (''keratinês'') paradox:<br>What you have not lost, you have. But you have not lost horns. Therefore you have horns.

The first paradox ([[Liar paradox|the Liar]]) is probably the most famous, and is similar to the famous paradox of [[Epimenides paradox|Epimenides the Cretan]]. The second, third and fourth paradoxes are variants of a single paradox and relate to the problem of what it means to "know" something and the identity of objects involved in an affirmation.  The fifth and sixth paradoxes are also a single paradox and is usually thought to relate to the vagueness of language.<ref>"This phenomenon at the heart of the [sorites] paradox is now recognised as the phenomenon of vagueness." {{sep entry|sorites-paradox|Sorites Paradox|Dominic Hyde}}</ref> The final paradox attacks presumptions involved in a proposition, and is related to the [[syllogistic fallacy]].

These paradoxes were very well known in ancient times, some are alluded to by Eubulides' contemporary [[Aristotle]]<ref>Aristotle, ''Sophistici Elenchi'', 24, 25, 22</ref> and even partially by [[Plato]].<ref>Plato, ''Euthydemus''</ref>  [[Aulus Gellius]] mentions how the discussion of such paradoxes was considered (for him) after-dinner entertainment at the [[Saturnalia]],<ref>Aulus Gellius, xviii. 2. 9</ref> but [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], on the other hand, considered them a waste of time: "Not to know them does no harm, and mastering them does no good."<ref>Seneca, ''Epistles'', 45. 8</ref>
