Keaton chose not to reprise the role due to Burton stepping down as director.<space/><link><target>William Baldwin</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Ethan Hawke</target></link><space/>were initially considered for Keaton's replacement, before Kilmer joined the cast.

However, Two-Face escapes. Edward Nygma, a researcher at<space/><link><target>Wayne Enterprises</target></link>, develops a device to beam television directly to a person's brain; Bruce Waynewith whom Nygma is obsessedrejects the invention, noting that it &quot;raises too many questions&quot;, and Nygma angrily resigns from his position after killing his supervisor Fred Stickley, and forging his suicide note and footage. Everybody except Bruce is convinced it was a genuine suicide.

After meeting Batman-obsessed psychiatrist<space/><link><target>Dr. Chase Meridian</target></link>, Bruce invites her to a charity circus event. There, Two-Face and his henchmen storm the event in an attempt to discover Batman's secret identity, and in the process murder<space/><italics>The Flying Graysons</italics>, a family of acrobats who attempt to stop him.

Dick then declares his intention to kill Two-Face and avenge his family's murder, and when he discovers Bruce's secret identity as Batman, he insists on becoming his partner, &quot;<link><target>Robin (comics)</target><part>Robin</part></link>&quot;. Meanwhile, Nygma becomes a criminal known as the &quot;<link><target>Riddler</target></link>&quot;, the master of puzzles and quizzes and forms an alliance with Two-Face. The two work together to steal capital for the mass production and promotion of Nygma's television device. Using his device, Nygma can read and control people's minds, and steal their<space/><link><target>intelligence quotient</target></link>. At a business party, Nygma discovers Bruce's secret identity. Two-Face then attacks the party and almost succeeds in killing Batman, but Robin arrives just in time to save his life. Meanwhile, Chase realizes her love for Bruce surpasses her obsession with Batman, but soon discovers that they are one and the same. However, Two-Face and the Riddler later assault Wayne Manor. The Riddler enters the<space/><link><target>Batcave</target></link><space/>and destroys most of the equipment, while Two-Face kidnaps Chase; Bruce, meanwhile, is left another riddle.</paragraph><paragraph>After solving the last riddle, Batman and Robin locate Two-Face and the Riddler's lair, Claw Island, where both are separated upon reaching the island. Robin then encounters Two-Face and manages to beat him to the ground; realizing that he does not have it in him to commit murder, Robin helps the villain back up. Two-Face pulls out a pistol and captures Robin. Meanwhile, Batman manages to make his way into the Riddler's lair, where Robin and Chase are revealed as hostages, bound, gagged with duct tape and held over a watery chasm, giving Batman a choice of saving just one hostage. Batman finds a way to save both hostages, and manages to destroy the brainwave-collecting device. The device's malfunction drives the Riddler into a<space/><link><target>mental breakdown</target></link><space/>in the process. During the battle, while Two-Face tosses his coin to decide Batman's fate, Batman throws a handful of coins towards him, which causes him to lose his balance and fall to his death while searching for his coin. The Riddler is sent to<space/><link><target>Arkham Asylum</target></link>, and Chase is asked to consult on his case. Nygma offers to reveal the identity of Batman to her, but he believes that he himself is Batman, due to his damaged memories. Chase then meets Bruce Wayne outside and tells him his secret is safe.

In this scene he is appreciated as the GNN news (Bruce watching in the Batcomputer) attacking Batman and Two-Face after the battle in the Subway and after that Bruce talking to Alfred turns into the dilemma of continuing to be Batman and try a normal life with Chase. Like the deleted Helicopter fight sequence, this scene also makes reference to Batman himself being &quot;a killer&quot;, and in the original production screenplay, this scene was to contain footage from<space/><italics><link><target>Batman Returns</target></link></italics>, specifically taken from the rooftop fight scene with Catwoman.

It involved Bruce waking up after being shot in the head by Two-Face, temporarily wiping a part of his memory; he has forgotten his origin and life as the Dark Knight. Alfred takes him to the Batcave, which has been destroyed by the Riddler. They stand on the platform where the<space/><link><target>Batmobile</target></link><space/>was, and Alfred says, &quot;Funny they did not know about the cave beneath the cave.&quot; The platform then rotates downward to another level where the<space/><link><target>sonar</target></link>-modification equipment is kept, from the special<space/><link><target>Batsuit</target></link><space/>to the hi-tech weaponry. Bruce then discovers the cavern where he first saw the image that inspired him to become Batman a giant bat. Inside he finds his father's Red Diary. It reminds him of the injustices committed against his family, and of how, in his small way, he felt responsible and helpless. The giant bat then appears and Bruce raises his arms and the shot shows that they are one. Bruce now remembers who he is and goes with Alfred to solve the riddles left throughout the film. Screenwriter<space/><link><target>Akiva Goldsman</target></link><space/>admitted the scene was very theatrical on the special edition DVD and felt it would have made a difference to the final cut. The bat was designed and created by<space/><link><target>Rick Baker (makeup artist)</target><part>Rick Baker</part></link>, who was in charge of the make-up of Two-Face. This scene appears in a rough form on the special edition DVD and is briefly mentioned in the comic adaptation.</listitem><listitem>The fight scene between Two-Face and Robin on Claw Island was originally longer.</listitem><listitem>The original ending was similar in style to the previous Batman films, which had involved a scene with Alfred in the limousine, the camera tracking upward through the Gotham cityscape, followed by a rooftop shot involving a silhouetted hero (Batman in the original, Catwoman in<space/><italics><link><target>Batman Returns</target></link></italics>) facing the Bat Signal. When Alfred drives Doctor Chase Meridian back to Gotham she asks him &quot;Does it ever end, Alfred?. &quot;Alfred replies, &quot;No, Doctor Meridian, not in this lifetime...&quot; The<space/><link><target>Bat-Signal</target></link><space/>shines on the night sky and Batman is standing on a pillar looking ahead. Robin then comes into shot and joins his new partner. They both leap off the pillar, towards the camera. A rough edit of the first half of the scene appears on the special edition DVD, but not in its entirety. The sequence with Batman and Robin at the end of this scene is not to be confused with a commercial for the video game, whose appears in a teaser trailer for the video game, which is on the VHS release of this film, released in the UK on December 3, 1995.</listitem></list><heading level='2'>Release</heading><heading level='3'>Box office</heading><paragraph><italics>Batman Forever</italics><space/>opened in 2,842 theaters in the United States on June 16, 1995, making $52.8 million in its opening weekend,<extension extension_name='ref' name="box"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url"><space/>http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id</arg><arg name="title"><space/>Batman Forever<space/></arg><arg name="publisher"><space/>[[Box Office Mojo]]<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate"><space/>2008-08-16</arg></template></extension><space/>breaking<space/><italics><link><target>Jurassic Park (film)</target><part>Jurassic Park</part></link></italics>s record for highest opening weekend gross of all-time (it was surpassed two years later by<space/><italics><link><target>The Lost World: Jurassic Park</target></link></italics><template><target>'</target></template>s $72.1 million).<extension extension_name='ref' name="dom"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url"><space/>http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2</arg><arg name="title"><space/>1995 Domestic Grosses<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Box Office Mojo</arg><arg name="accessdate"><space/>2008-08-16</arg></template></extension><space/>The film went on to gross $184 million in North America, and $152.5 million in other countries, totaling $336.53 million.<space/><italics>Batman Forever</italics><space/>was declared a huge financial success.<extension extension_name='ref' name="box"></extension><space/>The film earned more money than its predecessor<space/><italics><link><target>Batman Returns</target></link></italics>,<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url"><space/>http://www.boxofficemojo.com/showdowns/chart/?id</arg><arg name="title"><space/>Batman Battle<space/></arg><arg name="work"><space/>[[Box Office Mojo]]<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate"><space/>2008-08-16</arg></template></extension><space/>and was the second-highest (behind<space/><italics><link><target>Toy Story</target></link></italics>) grossing film of 1995, in the U.S.<extension extension_name='ref' name="dom"></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Critical reaction<space/><template><target>anchor</target><arg>Critics</arg></template></heading><paragraph>On<space/><link><target>Rotten Tomatoes</target></link>, the film received a rating of 41%, based on 58 reviews, with the site's critical consensus reading, &quot;Loud, excessively busy, and often boring,<space/><italics>Batman Forever</italics><space/>nonetheless has the charisma of Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones to offer mild relief.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url"><space/>http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/batman_forever/<space/></arg><arg name="title"><space/>Batman Forever<space/></arg><arg name="work"><space/>[[Rotten Tomatoes]]<space/></arg><arg name="publisher"><space/>[[Flixster]]<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate"><space/>2012-07-05</arg></template></extension><space/>On<space/><link><target>Metacritic</target></link>, the film has a score of 51 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url"><space/>http://www.metacritic.com/movie/batman-forever<space/></arg><arg name="title"><space/>Batman Forever (1995): Reviews<space/></arg><arg name="work"><space/>[[Metacritic]]<space/></arg><arg name="publisher"><space/>[[CBS Interactive]]<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate"><space/>2008-08-16</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Peter Travers</target></link><space/>said &quot;<italics>Batman Forever</italics><space/>still gets in its licks.
