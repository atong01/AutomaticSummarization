{{DISPLAYTITLE:''ad hominem''}}
An '''''ad hominem''''' ([[Latin]] for "to the man" or "to the person"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ad%20hominem|title=Ad hominem|work=The Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated|accessdate=19 February 2013}}</ref>), short for '''''argumentum ad hominem''''', is an attack on an argument made by attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, rather than attacking the argument directly. When used inappropriately, it is a logical [[fallacy]] in which a claim or argument is dismissed on the basis of some irrelevant fact or supposition about the author or the person being criticized.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aphilosopher.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/42-fallacies.pdf |title=42 Fallacies: Ad Hominem |author=Dr. Michael C.

Fallacious ''ad hominem'' reasoning is normally categorized as an [[informal fallacy]],<ref name="one">{{cite book |author=[[Doug Walton|Walton, Douglas]] |title=Informal Logic: A Pragmatic Approach |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=190}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Bowell|first1=Tracy|last2=Kemp|first2=Gary|title=Critical Thinking: A Concise Guide|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, Oxon|isbn=0-415-47183-4|pages=210–213}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Irving M.|last=Copi|title=Informal Logic|isbn=0-02-324940-4|publisher=Macmillan|year=1986|pages=112–113}}</ref> more precisely as a [[genetic fallacy]], a subcategory of [[fallacies of irrelevance]].

== Types ==
{{See also|List of fallacies}}

===Abusive===
Abusive ''ad hominem'' usually involves attacking the traits of an opponent as a means to invalidate their arguments. Equating someone's character with the soundness of their argument is a [[logical fallacy]].

''Ad hominem'' abuse is not to be confused with slander or libel, which employ falsehoods and are not necessarily leveled to undermine otherwise sound stands with character attacks.

===Tu quoque===
{{Main|Tu quoque}}
''Ad hominem tu quoque'' (literally: "You also") refers to a claim that the source making the argument has spoken or acted in a way inconsistent with the argument. In particular, if Source A criticizes the actions of Source B, a ''tu quoque'' response is that Source A has acted in the same way.  This argument is false because it does not disprove the premise; if the premise is true then Source A may be a [[hypocrite]], but this does not make the statement less credible from a logical perspective.  Indeed, Source A may be in a position to provide personal testimony to support the argument.

For example, a father may tell his son not to start smoking as he will regret it when he is older, and the son may point out that his father is or was a smoker. This does not alter the fact that his son may regret smoking when he is older.

===Circumstantial===
''Ad hominem circumstantial'' points out that someone is in circumstances such that they are disposed to take a particular position. ''Ad hominem'' circumstantial constitutes an attack on the bias of a source. This is fallacious because a disposition to make a certain argument does not make the argument false; this overlaps with the [[genetic fallacy]] (an argument that a claim is incorrect due to its source).<ref name="Walton (1998) p18-21">{{cite book |last=Walton |first=Douglas |title=Ad Hominem Arguments |publisher=University of Alabama Press |year=1998 |isbn=0-8173-0922-5 |pages=18–21}}</ref>

The circumstantial fallacy applies only where the source taking a position is only making a logical argument from premises that are generally accepted. Where the source seeks to convince an audience of the truth of a premise by a claim of authority or by personal observation, observation of their circumstances may reduce the evidentiary weight of the claims, sometimes to zero.<ref name="Fallacy Files">{{cite web |url=http://www.fallacyfiles.org/adhomine.html |title=Argumentum ad Hominem |accessdate=2007-09-10 |work=Fallacy Files |last=Curtis |first=Gary N.| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070920193815/http://www.fallacyfiles.org/adhomine.html| archivedate= 20 September 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

'''Examples''':

1. [[Mandy Rice-Davies]]'s famous testimony during the [[Profumo Affair]], "He would [say that], wouldn't he?", is an example of a valid circumstantial argument. Her point was that a man in a prominent position, accused of an affair with a [[callgirl]], would deny the claim whether it was true or false.  His denial, in itself, provides little evidence against the claim of an affair.  Note, however, that this argument is valid only insofar as it devalues the denial; it does ''not'' bolster the original claim.  To construe invalid evidence of the denial as valid evidence of the original claim is fallacious (on several different bases, including that of ''argumentum ad hominem''); however likely the man in question would be to deny an affair that did in fact happen, he is no less likely to deny an affair that never happened.

2. Glassner suggests that Bennett is somehow unqualified to criticize rap music because of positions Bennett has taken on other issues. However wrong Bennett may have been on other issues, such as the funding of public television or illegitimacy, that does not mean that his criticisms of rap were mistaken.<ref name="Fallacy Files">{{cite web |url=http://www.fallacyfiles.org/adhomine.html |title=Argumentum ad Hominem |accessdate=2007-09-10 |work=Fallacy Files |last=Curtis |first=Gary N.| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070920193815/http://www.fallacyfiles.org/adhomine.html| archivedate= 20 September 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Guilt by association===
{{Main|Association fallacy}}
Guilt by association can sometimes also be a type of ''ad hominem'' fallacy if the argument attacks a source because of the similarity between the views of someone making an argument and other proponents of the argument.<ref name="Walton (1998) p18-21"/>

This form of the argument is as follows:
# Source S makes claim C.
# Group G, which is currently viewed negatively by the recipient, also makes claim C.
# Therefore, source S is viewed by the recipient of the claim as associated to the group G and inherits how negatively viewed it is.

An example of this fallacy could be "My opponent for office just received an endorsement from the Puppy Haters Association. Is that the sort of person you would want to vote for?"

===Ad feminam===
''Ad feminam'' is defined as appealing to irrelevant considerations about women, in particular, prejudices against them or stereotypes about them, rather than giving an answer to the contentions they made. [[Merriam-Webster]] attests the usage of the term since 1963.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ad%20feminam|title=Ad feminam|work=The Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |edition=Fourth |year=2000 (updated in 2009) |chapter=ad feminam |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/ad+feminam}}</ref>

== Non-fallacious ''ad hominem'' reasoning ==
When a statement is challenged by making an ''ad hominem'' attack on its author, it is important to draw a distinction between whether the statement in question was ''an argument'' or ''a statement of fact'' (''testimony''). In the latter case the issues of the credibility of the person making the statement may be crucial.<ref name="Fallacy Files"/>

== Criticism of ''ad hominem'' as a fallacy ==

[[Doug Walton]],  Canadian academic and author, has argued that ''ad hominem'' reasoning is not always fallacious, and that in some instances, questions of personal conduct, character, motives, etc., are legitimate and relevant to the issue,<ref>{{cite book |author=Walton, Douglas |title=Informal Logic: A Pragmatic Approach |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=170}}</ref> as when it directly involves hypocrisy, or actions contradicting the subject's words.

The philosopher [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] has argued that ''ad hominem'' reasoning (discussing facts about the speaker or author relative the the value of his statements) is essential to understanding certain moral issues due to the connection between individual persons and morality (or moral claims), and contrasts this sort of reasoning with the apodictic reasoning (involving facts beyond dispute or clearly established) of philosophical naturalism.<ref name=Taylor />
