This would keep the bombers out of range of Soviet ground-based defences installed around the target area, allowing the warhead to &quot;dash&quot; in at high speed.</paragraph><paragraph>There would have to be a balance between the size of the warhead, the need for it to be carried by any of the three V-bomber types in use, and that it should be able to reach Mach 3. At the time the only strategic warheads available in the UK were the<space/><link><target>Orange Herald</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Green Bamboo</target></link>, both of which were very large weapons demanding a large missile fuselage.

The large girth of Blue Steel was determined by the<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>45</arg><arg>in</arg><arg>m</arg></template><space/>implosion sphere diameter of Green Bamboo.</paragraph><paragraph>Avro proposed that Blue Steel would evolve over time, subsequent versions increasing speed (to Mach 4.5) and range. The ultimate Blue Steel would be a<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>900</arg><arg>nmi</arg><arg>km</arg><arg name="abbr">on</arg></template><space/>range weapon that could be launched by the supersonic<space/><link><target>Avro 730</target></link><space/>under development. They were told to limit themselves to the specification of OR.1132.<extension extension_name='ref' name="BSP"></extension><space/>The project was delayed by the need to develop the<space/><link><target>stainless steel</target></link><space/>fabrication techniques; this would have been gained in building the Avro 730 but that had been cancelled by then. Elliots guidance system was plagued by accuracy problems delaying test flights.</paragraph><paragraph>As it turned out, neither of the originally-proposed UK-designed warheads were actually fitted, being superseded by<space/><link><target>Red Snow</target></link>, an Anglicised variant of the U.S.<space/><link><target>B28 nuclear bomb</target><part>W-28 thermonuclear warhead</part></link><space/>of 1.1 Mt yield. Red Snow was smaller and lighter than the earlier warhead proposals. The missile was fitted with a state-of-the-art<space/><link><target>inertial navigation</target></link><space/>unit. This system allowed the missile to strike within 100 metres of its designated target. In addition, the pilots of the<space/><link><target>Avro Vulcan</target></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>Handley Page Victor</target></link><space/>bombers could tie their systems into those of the missile and make use of the guidance system to help plot their own flight plan, since the unit in the missile was more advanced than that in the aircraft.</paragraph><paragraph>Blue Steel emerged as a pilotless, winged aircraft roughly the size of the experimental<space/><link><target>Saunders-Roe SR.53</target></link><space/><link><target>interceptor aircraft</target><part>interceptor</part></link>, with clipped<space/><link><target>delta wing</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and small<space/><link><target>Canard (aeronautics)</target><part>canard</part></link><space/>foreplanes. It was powered by a two-chamber<space/><link><target>Armstrong Siddeley</target></link><space/><link><target>Armstrong Siddeley Stentor</target><part>Stentor Mark 101</part></link><space/>rocket engine, burning a combination of<space/><link><target>hydrogen peroxide</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>kerosene</target></link>. The fuel was a considerable operational problem, because fuelling the missile before launch took nearly half an hour, and was quite hazardous.</paragraph><paragraph>On launch the rocket engine's first chamber developing<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>24000</arg><arg>lbf</arg><arg>kN</arg><arg name="abbr">on</arg></template><space/>thrust would power the missile along a predetermined course to the target at around<space/><link><target>Mach number</target><part>Mach</part></link><space/>1.5. Once close to the target, the second chamber of the engine (6,000&amp;nbsp;lb) would accelerate the missile to Mach 3. Over the target the engine would cut out and the missile would free-fall before detonating its warhead as an<space/><link><target>air burst</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>To speed the trials at<space/><link><target>Woomera Test Range</target><part>Woomera</part></link>, the test rounds were flown there by Victors and Vulcans in Operation Blue Ranger. The trials began in 1960 about the time the original requirement expected the weapon to be in service.</paragraph><paragraph>Blue Steel finally entered service in February<space/><link><target>1963 in aviation</target><part>1963</part></link>, being carried by<space/><link><target>Avro Vulcan</target><part>Vulcans</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Handley Page Victor</target><part>Victors</part></link>, although its limitations were already apparent. The short range of the missile meant that the V bombers were still vulnerable to enemy<space/><link><target>surface-to-air missile</target><trail>s</trail></link>. A replacement for Blue Steel, the Mark 2, was planned with increased range and a<space/><link><target>ramjet</target></link><space/>engine, but was cancelled in<space/><link><target>1960 in aviation</target><part>1960</part></link><space/>to minimise delays to the Mk.1. The UK sought to acquire the much longer-ranged<space/><link><target>United States Air Force</target></link><space/><link><target>AGM-48 Skybolt</target></link><space/>air-launched ballistic missile, and was greatly frustrated when that weapon was cancelled in late<space/><link><target>1962 in aviation</target><part>1962</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Blue Steel required up to seven hours of launch preparation, and was highly unreliable; the Royal Air Force estimated in 1963 that half the missiles would fail to fire and would have to be dropped over their targets, contradicting their purpose of serving as standoff weapons. Even as it deployed Blue Steel, a high-altitude weapon, that year the government decided that because of anti-aircraft missiles' increasing effectiveness, V bombers would have to convert from high-altitude to low-altitude attacks.<extension extension_name='ref' name="baylis1995"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="title">Ambiguity and Deterrence: British Nuclear Strategy 1945-1964<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Clarendon Press<space/></arg><arg name="author">Baylis, John<space/></arg><arg name="year">1995<space/></arg><arg name="location">Oxford<space/></arg><arg name="isbn">0-19-828012-2</arg></template></extension><template><target>rp</target><arg>349–351</arg></template><space/>With no effective long-range weapon the original Blue Steel served on after a crash programme of minor modifications to permit a low-level launch at<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>1000</arg><arg>ft</arg><arg>m</arg><arg name="abbr">on</arg></template>, even though its usefulness in a hot war was likely limited.
