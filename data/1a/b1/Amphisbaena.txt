The '''amphisbaena''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|m|f|ɪ|s|ˈ|b|iː|n|ə}}, plural: '''amphisbaenae''') is a [[mythological]], [[ant]]-eating [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] with a head at each end. The creature is alternately called the '''amphisbaina''', '''amphisbene''', '''amphisboena''', '''amphisbona''', '''amphista''', '''amfivena''', '''amphivena''', or '''anphivena''' (the last two being feminine), and is also known as the "Mother of Ants".{{citation needed (lead)|date=January 2014}} Its name comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''amphis'', meaning "both ways", and ''bainein'', meaning "to go".{{citation needed (lead)|date=January 2014}} According to [[Greek mythology]], the amphisbaena was spawned from the blood that dripped from the [[Gorgon]] [[Medusa]]'s head as [[Perseus]] flew over the [[Libyan Desert]] with it in his hand, after which [[Cato the Younger|Cato]]'s army then encountered it along with other serpents on the march.<ref>[https://cuwomensresourcecenter.wordpress.com/2013/07/08/monstrous-mondays-the-amphisbaena-serpent/ When Cato the Younger’s army marched through Libya]</ref> Amphisbaenae fed off of the corpses left behind. The amphisbaena has been referred to by various [[poet]]s such as [[Nicander]], [[John Milton]], [[Alexander Pope]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Alfred Tennyson|Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], and [[A. E. Housman]];as a mythological and legendary creature, it has been referenced by [[Lucan (poet)|Lucan]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Isidore of Seville]], and [[Thomas Browne]], the last of whom debunked its existence.{{citation needed (lead)|date=January 2014}}

This early description of the amphisbaena depicts a venomous, dual-headed snakelike creature. However, [[Medieval]] and later drawings often show it with two or more scaled feet, particularly chicken feet, and feathered wings.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Some{{Who|date=January 2015}} even depict it as a horned, dragon-like creature with a serpent-headed tail and small, round ears, while others have both "necks" of equal size so that it cannot be determined which is the rear head.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Many descriptions of the amphisbaena say its eyes glow like candles or lightning, but the poet [[Nicander]] seems to contradict this by describing it as "always dull of eye". He also says: "From either end protrudes a blunt chin; each is far from each other." [[Nicander]]'s account seems to be referring to what is indeed called the [[Amphisbaenia]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

== Habitat ==
The amphisbaena is said to make its home in the [[desert]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

== Folk medicine ==
In ancient times, the supposedly dangerous amphisbaena had many uses in the art of [[folk medicine]] and other such remedies. It was said{{By whom|date=January 2015}} that expecting women wearing a live amphisbaena around their necks would have safe pregnancies; however, if one's goal was to cure ailments such as [[arthritis]] or the [[common cold]], one should wear only its skin.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} By eating the meat of the amphisbaena, one could supposedly attract many lovers of the opposite sex, and slaying one during the [[full moon]] could give power to one who is pure of heart and mind.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} [[Lumberjacks]] suffering from cold weather on the job could nail its carcass or skin to a tree to keep warm, while in the process allowing the tree to be felled more easily.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

== Origins ==
In ''The Book of Beasts'', [[T.H. White]] suggests that the creature derives from sightings of the [[Amphisbaenia|worm lizards]] of the same name.<ref>[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/HistSciTech/subcollections/BestiaryAbout.html The Book of Beasts]</ref> These creatures are found in the Mediterranean countries where many of these legends originated.
