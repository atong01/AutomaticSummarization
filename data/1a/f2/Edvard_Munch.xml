Christian was a doctor and medical officer who married Laura, a woman half his age, in 1861. Edvard had an elder sister, Johanne Sophie, and three younger siblings: Peter Andreas, Laura Catherine, and Inger Marie. Both Sophie and Edvard appear to have inherited their artistic talent from their mother.

Often ill for much of the winters and kept out of school, Edvard would draw to keep himself occupied. He was tutored by his school mates and his aunt. Christian Munch also instructed his son in history and literature, and entertained the children with vivid ghost-stories and the tales of American writer<space/><link><target>Edgar Allan Poe</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>harvnb</target><arg>Prideaux</arg><arg>2005</arg><arg name="p">17</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>As Edvard remembered it, Christian's positive behavior toward his children was overshadowed by his morbid<space/><link><target>pietism</target></link>. Munch wrote, &quot;My father was temperamentally nervous and obsessively religiousto the point of psychoneurosis. From him I inherited the seeds of madness.

The oppressive religious milieu, plus Edvard's poor health and the vivid ghost stories, helped inspire his macabre visions and nightmares; the boy felt that death was constantly advancing on him.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>harvnb</target><arg>Prideaux</arg><arg>2005</arg><arg name="p">19</arg></template></extension><space/>One of Munch's younger sisters was diagnosed with mental illness at an early age.

Some early works are reminiscent of<space/><link><target>douard Manet</target><part>Manet</part></link>. Many of these attempts brought him unfavorable criticism from the press and garnered him constant rebukes by his father, who nonetheless provided him with small sums for living expenses.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Pr_p34"></extension><space/>At one point, however, Munch's father, perhaps swayed by the negative opinion of Munch's cousin Edvard Diriks (an established, traditional painter), destroyed at least one painting (likely a nude) and refused to advance any more money for art supplies.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>harvnb</target><arg>Eggum</arg><arg>1984</arg><arg name="p">43</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Munch also received his father's ire for his relationship with<space/><link><target>Hans Jger</target></link>, the local nihilist who lived by the code &quot;a passion to destroy is also a creative passion&quot; and who advocated suicide as the ultimate way to freedom.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>harvnb</target><arg>Prideaux</arg><arg>2005</arg><arg name="pp">71, 74</arg></template></extension><space/>Munch came under his malevolent, anti-establishment spell. &quot;My ideas developed under the influence of the<space/><link><target>Bohemianism</target><part>bohemians</part></link><space/>or rather under Hans Jger.

He was unsettled by the sexual revolution going on at the time and by the independent women around him. He later turned cynical concerning sexual matters, expressed not only in his behavior and his art, but in his writings as well, an example being a long poem called<space/><italics>The City of Free Love</italics>.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>harvnb</target><arg>Prideaux</arg><arg>2005</arg><arg name="p">72</arg></template></extension><space/>Still dependent on his family for many of his meals, Munch's relationship with his father remained tense over concerns about his bohemian life.</paragraph><paragraph>After numerous experiments, Munch concluded that the Impressionist idiom did not allow sufficient expression. He found it superficial and too akin to scientific experimentation. He felt a need to go deeper and explore situations brimming with emotional content and expressive energy. Under Jger's commandment that Munch should &quot;write his life&quot;, meaning that Munch should explore his own emotional and psychological state, the young artist began a period of reflection and self-examination, recording his thoughts in his &quot;soul's diary&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>harvnb</target><arg>Prideaux</arg><arg>2005</arg><arg name="p">83</arg></template></extension><space/>This deeper perspective helped move him to a new view of his art. He wrote that his painting<space/><italics><link><target>The Sick Child</target></link></italics><space/>(1886), based on his sister's death, was his first &quot;soul painting&quot;, his first break from Impressionism. The painting received a negative response from critics and from his family, and caused another &quot;violent outburst of moral indignation&quot; from the community.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>harvnb</target><arg>Prideaux</arg><arg>2005</arg><arg name="p">88</arg></template></extension><space/></paragraph><paragraph>Only his friend Christian Krohg defended him:<extension extension_name='blockquote'>He paints, or rather regards, things in a way that is different from that of other artists. He sees only the essential, and that, naturally, is all he paints. For this reason Munch's pictures are as a rule &quot;not complete&quot;, as people are so delighted to discover for themselves. Oh, yes, they are complete. His complete handiwork. Art is complete once the artist has really said everything that was on his mind, and this is precisely the advantage Munch has over painters of the other generation, that he really knows how to show us what he has felt, and what has gripped him, and to this he subordinates everything else.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>harvnb</target><arg>Eggum</arg><arg>1984</arg><arg name="pp">52–53</arg></template></extension></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Munch continued to employ a variety of brushstroke technique and color palettes throughout the 1880s and early 1890s, as he struggled to define his style.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>harvnb</target><arg>Eggum</arg><arg>1984</arg><arg name="p">46</arg></template></extension><space/>His idiom continued to veer between<space/><link><target>Naturalism (arts)</target><part>naturalistic</part></link>, as seen in<space/><italics>Portrait of Hans Jger</italics>, and<space/><link><target>Impressionism</target><part>impressionistic</part></link>, as in<space/><italics>Rue Lafayette</italics>.
