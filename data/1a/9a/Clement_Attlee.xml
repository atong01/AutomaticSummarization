He became the first Labour Prime Minister ever to serve a full five-year term, as well as the first to command a Labour majority in<space/><link><target>Parliament of the United Kingdom</target><part>Parliament</part></link>, and remains the longest-ever serving Leader of the Labour Party.</paragraph><paragraph>First elected to Parliament in 1922 as the<space/><link><target>Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)</target><part>MP</part></link><space/>for<space/><link><target>Limehouse (UK Parliament constituency)</target><part>Limehouse</part></link>, Attlee rose quickly to become a minister in the minority government led by<space/><link><target>Ramsay MacDonald</target></link><space/>in 1924. In 1931, after Labour suffered a heavy election defeat, he was elected its<space/><link><target>Deputy Leader of the Labour Party (UK)</target><part>Deputy Leader</part></link>. Four years later, he became the Leader of the Labour Party after the resignation of<space/><link><target>George Lansbury</target></link>. At first advocating pacificism and appeasement, he later reversed his position and by 1938 became a strong critic of<space/><link><target>Neville Chamberlain</target></link>'s attempts to appease<space/><link><target>Adolf Hitler</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Benito Mussolini</target></link>. He subsequently took Labour into the Churchill war ministry in 1940. Initially serving as<space/><link><target>Lord Privy Seal</target></link>, he was appointed Deputy Prime Minister two years later. With the end of the<space/><link><target>Second World War</target></link><space/>in Europe in May 1945, the coalition government was dissolved and Attlee led Labour to win a huge majority in the ensuing general election two months later.</paragraph><paragraph>The government he led built the<space/><link><target>post-war consensus</target></link>, based upon the assumption that<space/><link><target>full employment</target></link><space/>would be maintained by<space/><link><target>Keynesian economics</target><part>Keynesian policies</part></link><space/>and that a greatly enlarged system of social services would be created aspirations that had been outlined in the wartime<space/><link><target>Beveridge Report</target></link>. Within this context, his government undertook the nationalisation of public utilities and major industries, as well as the creation of the<space/><link><target>National Health Service</target></link>. After initial<space/><link><target>Conservative Party (UK)</target><part>Conservative</part></link><space/>opposition to Keynesian fiscal policy, this settlement was broadly accepted by all parties for over three decades until<space/><link><target>Margaret Thatcher</target></link><space/>became Prime Minister in 1979. His government also presided over the<space/><link><target>decolonisation</target></link><space/>of a large part of the<space/><link><target>British Empire</target></link>, granting<space/><link><target>British India</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Burma</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Ceylon</target></link><space/>independence, as well as ending the British Mandates of<space/><link><target>British Mandate of Palestine</target><part>Palestine</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>British Mandate of Jordan</target><part>Jordan</part></link>. He strongly supported the<space/><link><target>Cold War</target></link><space/>against Soviet Communism. When the budgetary crisis forced Britain out of Greece in 1947 he called on Washington to counter the<space/><link><target>Soviet Union</target></link><space/>with the<space/><link><target>Truman Doctrine</target></link>. He avidly supported the<space/><link><target>Marshall Plan</target></link><space/>to rebuild Western Europe with American money, and the<space/><link><target>NATO</target></link><space/>military alliance against the Soviet bloc. He sent British troops to fight in the<space/><link><target>Malayan Emergency</target></link><space/>in 1948. After leading Labour to a narrow victory in 1950, he sent British troops to fight in the<space/><link><target>Korean War</target></link>. Attlee was narrowly defeated by Churchill in 1951; he retired as Labour leader after losing the 1955 General Election and was elevated to the<space/><link><target>House of Lords</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>In public, Attlee appeared modest and unassuming; he was ineffective at public relations and lacked charisma. His strengths emerged behind the scenes, especially in committees where his depth of knowledge, quiet demeanour, objectivity and pragmatism proved decisive. He saw himself as spokesman on behalf of his entire party, and successfully kept its multiple factions in harness. His reputation among scholars in recent decades has been much higher than during his years as Prime Minister, thanks to his role in forging the<space/><link><target>welfare state</target></link><space/>and opposing<space/><link><target>Stalin</target></link><space/>in the Cold War.<extension extension_name='ref'>Nicklaus Thomas-Symonds,<space/><italics>Attlee: a Life in Politics</italics><space/>(2010), pp 24, 127</extension></paragraph><paragraph>In 2004<space/><link><target>Historical rankings of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom</target><part>he was voted</part></link><space/>the greatest British Prime Minister of the 20th Century by a poll of 139 academics organised by<space/><link><target>MORI</target><part>Ipsos MORI</part></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId</arg><arg name="title">Rating British Prime Ministers</arg><arg name="publisher">Ipsos MORI</arg><arg name="date">29 November 2004</arg><arg name="accessdate">2 October 2011</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Early life and education</heading><paragraph>Attlee was born in<space/><link><target>Putney</target></link>, Surrey (now part of London), the seventh of eight children.

It has been a victory for brute force. At every stage of the proceedings there have been time limits laid down by the owner and ruler of armed force.

He has overturned the balance of power in Europe. He has destroyed the last fortress of democracy in Eastern Europe which stood in the way of his ambition.

It was Attlee's government that decided Britain should have an independent atomic weapons programme, and work began on it in 1947.

Independent British atomic research was prompted partly by the US<space/><link><target>McMahon Act</target></link>, which nullified wartime expectations of postwar US-British collaboration in nuclear research, and prohibited Americans from communicating nuclear technology even to allied countries. British atomic bomb research was kept secret even from some members of Attlee's own cabinet, whose loyalty or discretion seemed uncertain.<extension extension_name='ref'>Peter Hennessy,<space/><italics>Cabinets and the Bomb</italics>, (Oxford University Press, 2007.)</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Though a socialist, Attlee still believed in the British Empire of his youth.
