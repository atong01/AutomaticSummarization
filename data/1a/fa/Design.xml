In theory, the plan should anticipate and compensate for potential problems in the execution process. Design involves problem-solving and<space/><link><target>creativity</target></link>. In contrast, production involves a routine or pre-planned process. A design may also be a mere plan that does not include a production or engineering processes although a working knowledge of such processes is usually expected of designers. In some cases, it may be unnecessary and/or impractical to expect a designer with a broad<space/><link><target>multidisciplinary</target></link><space/>knowledge required for such designs to also have a detailed<space/><link><target>Division of labour</target><part>specialized</part></link><space/>knowledge of how to produce the product.</paragraph><paragraph>Design and production are intertwined in many<space/><link><target>creative professional</target></link><space/>careers, meaning problem-solving is part of execution and the reverse. As the cost of rearrangement increases, the need for separating design from production increases as well. For example, a high-budget project, such as a<space/><link><target>skyscraper</target></link>, requires separating (design)<space/><link><target>architect</target><trail>ure</trail></link><space/>from (production)<space/><link><target>construction</target></link>. A Low-budget project, such as a<space/><link><target>Multifunction printer</target><part>locally printed</part></link><space/>office party invitation<space/><link><target>Flyer (pamphlet)</target><part>flyer</part></link>, can be rearranged and printed dozens of times at the low cost of a few sheets of paper, a few drops of ink, and less than one hour's pay of a<space/><link><target>desktop publishing</target><part>desktop publisher</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>This is not to say that production never involves problem-solving or creativity, nor that design always involves creativity. Designs are rarely perfect and are sometimes repetitive. The imperfection of a design may task a production position (e.g.<space/><link><target>production artist</target></link>,<space/><link><target>construction worker</target></link>) with utilizing creativity or problem-solving skills to compensate for what was overlooked in the design process. Likewise, a design may be a simple repetition (copy) of a known preexisting solution, requiring minimal, if any, creativity or problem-solving skills from the designer.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:BPMN-DiscussionCycle.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>An example of a business workflow process using<space/><link><target>Business Process Modeling Notation</target></link>.</part></link></paragraph><heading level='3'>Process design</heading><paragraph>&quot;Process design&quot; (in contrast to &quot;design process&quot; mentioned<space/><link><target>#Design as a process</target><part>above</part></link>) refers to the planning of routine steps of a process aside from the expected result.
