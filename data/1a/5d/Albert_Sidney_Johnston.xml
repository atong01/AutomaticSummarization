As the Confederate forces overran the Union camps, Johnston seemed to be everywhere, personally leading and rallying troops up and down the line on his horse. At about 2:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., while leading one of those charges against a Union camp near the &quot;Peach Orchard&quot;, he was wounded, taking a bullet behind his right knee. He apparently did not think the wound was serious at the time, or even possibly did not feel it, and so he sent his personal physician away to attend to some wounded captured Union soldiers instead. It is possible that Johnston's duel in 1837 had caused nerve damage or numbness to his right leg and that he did not feel the wound to his leg as a result. The bullet had in fact clipped a part of his<space/><link><target>popliteal artery</target></link><space/>and his boot was filling up with blood. Within a few minutes, Johnston was observed by his staff to be nearly fainting. Among his staff was<space/><link><target>Isham G. Harris</target></link>, the<space/><link><target>Governor of Tennessee</target></link>, who had ceased to make any real effort to function as governor after learning that<space/><link><target>Abraham Lincoln</target></link><space/>had appointed<space/><link><target>Andrew Johnson</target></link><space/>as military governor of Tennessee. Seeing Johnston slumping in his saddle and his face turning deathly pale, Harris asked: &quot;General, are you wounded?&quot; Johnston glanced down at his leg wound, then faced Harris and replied in a weak voice his last words: &quot;Yes... and I fear seriously.&quot; Harris and other staff officers removed Johnston from his horse and carried him to a small ravine near the &quot;Hornets Nest&quot; and desperately tried to aid the general by trying to make a<space/><link><target>tourniquet</target></link><space/>for his leg wound, but little could be done by this point since he had already lost so much blood. He soon lost consciousness and bled to death a few minutes later. It is believed that Johnston may have lived for as long as one hour after receiving his fatal wound. Harris and the other officers wrapped General Johnston's body in a blanket so as not to damage the troops' morale with the sight of the dead general. Johnston and his wounded horse, named Fire Eater, were taken to his field headquarters on the Corinth road, where his body remained in his tent until the Confederate Army withdrew to Corinth the next day, April 7, 1862. From there, his body was taken to the home of Colonel William Inge, which had been his headquarters in Corinth. It was covered in the Confederate flag and lay in state for several hours.<extension extension_name='ref'>Sword, pp. 270-73, 443-46; Cunningham, pp. 273-76; Smith, pp. 26-34.
