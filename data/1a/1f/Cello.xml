Monteverdi referred to the instrument as &quot;basso de viola da braccio&quot; in<space/><italics>Orfeo</italics><space/>(1607). Although the first<space/><link><target>bass violin</target></link>, possibly invented as early as 1538, was most likely inspired by the viol, it was created to be used in consort with the violin. The bass violin was actually often referred to as a<space/><italics>&quot;violone,&quot;</italics><space/>or &quot;large viola,&quot; as were the viols of the same period. Instruments that share features with both the bass violin and the<space/><italics>viola da gamba</italics><space/>appear in Italian art of the early 16th century.</paragraph><paragraph>The invention of wire-wound<space/><link><target>String (music)</target><part>strings</part></link><space/>(fine wire around a thin gut core), around 1660 in<space/><link><target>Bologna</target></link>, allowed for a finer bass sound than was possible with purely gut strings on such a short body. Bolognese makers exploited this new technology to create the cello, a somewhat smaller instrument suitable for solo repertoire due to both the timbre of the instrument and the fact that the smaller size made it easier to play<space/><link><target>virtuoso</target><part>virtuosic</part></link><space/>passages. This instrument had disadvantages as well, however. The cello's light sound was not as suitable for church and ensemble playing, so it had to be doubled by<space/><link><target>organ (music)</target><part>organ</part></link>,<space/><link><target>theorbo</target></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>violone</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Around 1700, Italian players popularized the cello in northern Europe, although the bass violin (basse de violon) continued to be used for another two decades in France.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">November 2007</arg></template><space/>Many existing bass violins were literally cut down in size to convert them into cellos according to the smaller pattern developed by<space/><link><target>Stradivarius</target></link>, who also made a number of old pattern large cellos (the 'Servais').<extension extension_name='ref' name="vrzuok">Cyr 1982</extension><space/>The sizes, names, and tunings of the cello varied widely by geography and time.<extension extension_name='ref' name="vrzuok"></extension><space/>The size was not standardized until around 1750.</paragraph><paragraph>Despite similarities to the<space/><link><target>viol</target><part>viola da gamba</part></link>, the cello is actually part of the<space/><link><target>viola da braccio</target></link><space/>family, meaning &quot;viol of the arm,&quot; which includes, among others, the<space/><link><target>violin</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>viola</target></link>.

Note the absence of fine-tuning pins on the tailpiece.</part></link><link><target>Baroque</target></link><space/>era cellos differed from the modern instrument in several ways. The neck has a different form and angle, which matches the baroque bass-bar and stringing. Modern cellos have an endpin at the bottom to support the instrument (and transmit some of the sound through the floor),<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">July 2013</arg></template><space/>while Baroque cellos are held only by the calves of the player. Modern bows curve in and are held at the frog; Baroque bows curve out and are held closer to the bow's point of balance. Modern strings normally have a metal core, although some use a synthetic core; Baroque strings are made of<space/><link><target>Catgut</target><part>gut</part></link>, with the G and C strings wire-wound. Modern cellos often have fine-tuners connecting the strings to the tailpiece, which make it much easier to tune the instrument, but such pins are rendered ineffective by the flexibility of the gut strings used on Baroque cellos. Overall, the modern instrument has much higher string tension than the Baroque cello,<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">July 2013</arg></template><space/>resulting in a louder, more projecting tone, with fewer overtones.</paragraph><paragraph>Few educational works specifically devoted to the cello existed before the 18th century, and those that do exist contain little value to the performer beyond simple accounts of instrumental technique.

The cello section, in standard orchestral seating, is located on stage left (the audience's right) in the front, opposite the first violin section. However, some orchestras and conductors prefer switching the positioning of the viola and cello sections. The<space/><italics>principal</italics><space/>cellist is the section leader, determining bowings for the section in conjunction with other string principals, and playing solos. Principal players always sit closest to the audience.</paragraph><paragraph>The cellos are a critical part of orchestral music; all symphonic works involve the cello section, and many pieces require cello soli or solos. Much of the time, cellos provide part of the harmony for the orchestra. Often, the cello section plays the melody for a brief period, before returning to the harmony. There are also cello<space/><link><target>concerto</target><trail>s</trail></link>, which are orchestral pieces that feature a solo cellist accompanied by an entire orchestra.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Solo</heading><paragraph><template><target>Listen</target><arg name="filename">20091104 Alisa Weilerstein - Kodály's Sonata for Solo Cello, Op. 8 - 3.

Bach the BACH.Bow is particularly suited to it: and it was developed with this in mind, polyphonic playing being required, as well as monophonic.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Michael Bach, Cello with BACH.Bow.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Michael Bach, Cello with<space/><link><target>curved bow</target><part>BACH.Bow</part></link></part></link></paragraph><heading level='2'>Physics</heading><heading level='3'>Physical aspects</heading><paragraph>When a string is bowed or plucked, it vibrates and moves the air around it, producing sound waves. Because the string is quite thin, not much air is moved by the string itself, and consequently if the string was not mounted on a hollow body, the sound would be weak. In acoustic stringed instruments such as the cello, this lack of volume is solved by mounting the vibrating string on a larger hollow wooden body. The vibrations are transmitted to the larger body, which can move more air and produce a louder sound. Different designs of the instrument produces variations in the instruments vibrational patterns and thus changes the character of the sound produced.<extension extension_name='ref'>Cowling, Elizabeth.

Shortening a string stiffens it by increasing its curvature during a distortion and subjecting it to larger net forces. Shortening the string also reduces its mass. Since a stiffer string with a smaller mass vibrates faster, shortening a string increases the pitch. Because of this effect, you can raise and change the pitch of a string by pressing it against the fingerboard in the cellos neck and effectively shortening it.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Bloomfield, Louis A 2001. pp 241-244"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>A loud beating sound results between these nearby frequencies; this is known as the wolf tone because it is an unpleasant growling sound. The wood resonance appears to be split into two frequencies by the driving force of the sounding string. These two periodic resonances beat with each other. This wolf tone must be eliminated or significantly reduced for the cello to play the nearby notes with a pleasant tone. This can be accomplished by modifying the cello front plate, attaching a wolf eliminator, or moving the sound post.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Berg, Richard E 2005. pp 314, 329">Berg, Richard E.

Most cellists earn their living from a mixture of performance and teaching jobs. The first step to getting most performance jobs is by playing at an<space/><link><target>audition</target></link>. In some styles of music, cellists may be asked to<space/><link><target>sight reading</target><part>sight read</part></link><space/>printed music or perform standard repertoire with an ensemble.</paragraph><paragraph>In classical music, cellists audition for playing jobs in orchestras and for admission into university or Conservatory programs or degrees. At a classical cello audition, the performer typically plays a movement from a Bach suite or a movement from a concerto and a variety of excerpts from the orchestral literature. Orchestral auditions are typically held in front of a panel that includes the<space/><link><target>conductor (music)</target><part>conductor</part></link>, the<space/><link><target>Concertmaster</target></link>, the Principal cellist and other principal players.</paragraph><paragraph>The most promising candidates are invited to return for a second or third round of auditions, which allows the conductor and the panel to compare the best candidates. Performers may be asked to sight read orchestral music. The final stage of the audition process in some orchestras is a<space/><italics>test week</italics>, in which the performer plays with the orchestra for a week or two, which allows the conductor and principal players to see if the individual can function well in an actual performance setting.</paragraph><paragraph>Performance jobs include playing as a freelancer in small groups, playing in a<space/><link><target>chamber music</target></link><space/>group, large ensembles, or performing solo music, either live onstage or as a session player for radio or TV broadcasts or for recordings; and working as the employee of an orchestra, big band, or recording studio. Many cello players find extra work by substituting (&quot;subbing&quot;) for cellists who are double-booked or ill. It is hard for many cello players to be able to find full-time, full-year work at a single job. About the closest that a cellist can come to this is in the case of those who win an audition at a professional orchestra. Even full-time orchestra jobs do not usually last for the entire year. When the orchestra stops playing (which is often in the summer), orchestral cellists have to find other work, either as a teacher or coach, or in another group.</paragraph><paragraph>Teaching work for cellists includes giving private lessons in the home or at colleges and universities; coaching cellists who are preparing for recordings or auditions; doing group coaching at music camps or for youth ensembles; and working as a high school music teacher. Due to the limited number of full-time orchestral jobs, many classical cellists are not able to find full-time work with a single orchestra. Some cellists increase their employ-ability by learning several different styles, such as folk or pop.</paragraph><paragraph>In some cases, cellists supplement their performing and teaching income with other related music jobs, such as working as a stringed instrument repairer (luthier); as a contractor who hires musicians for orchestras or big bands, composing music, songwriting, conducting, or organizing festivals (e.g.,<space/><link><target>Julian Armour</target></link>).</paragraph><heading level='2'>Famous cellos</heading><paragraph><template><target>See also</target><arg>Category:Individual cellos</arg></template><link><target>File:Servais Stradivarius.jpg</target><part>right</part><part>thumbnail</part><part>150px</part><part>The Servais Stradivarius is preserved in the<space/><link><target>Smithsonian Institution</target></link>'s<space/><link><target>National Museum of American History</target></link></part></link>Specific instruments are famous (or become famous) for a variety of reasons.
