It is an educational process rather than a relaxation technique or form of exercise.

After doctors found no physical cause, Alexander reasoned that he was doing something to himself while speaking to cause his problem. His self-observation in multiple mirrors revealed that he was contracting his whole body prior to<space/><link><target>phonation</target></link><space/>in preparation for all verbal response. He developed the hypothesis that this habitual pattern of pulling the head backwards and downwards needlessly disrupted the normal working of the total postural, breathing and vocal mechanisms. After experimenting to develop his ability to stop the unnecessary and habitual contracting in his neck, he found that his problem with recurrent voice loss was resolved. While on a recital tour in New Zealand (1895) he began to realise the wider significance of head carriage for overall physical functioning.<space/><template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">December 2010</arg></template><space/>Further, Alexander observed that many individuals commonly tightened the<space/><link><target>musculature</target></link><space/>of the upper torso as he had done, in anticipation of many other activities besides speech.</paragraph><paragraph>Alexander believed his work could be applied to improve individual health and well being. He further refined his technique of self-observation and re-training to teach his discoveries to others. He explained his reasoning in four books published in 1918, 1923, 1931 (1932 in the UK) and 1942. He also trained teachers to teach his work from 1930 until his death in 1955. Teacher training was interrupted during World War II between 1941 and 1943, when Alexander accompanied children and teachers of the Little School to Stow, Massachusetts to join his brother, A. R. Alexander, who also taught his brother's technique. In the 1960s, there was enough interest to start the first dedicated school, called The American Center for the Alexander Technique, in New York City.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Levine"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last"><space/>Levine<space/></arg><arg name="first"><space/>Andrew<space/></arg><arg name="year"><space/>1998<space/></arg><arg name="title"><space/>The Bodywork and Massage Sourcebook<space/></arg><arg name="publisher"><space/>[[Lowell House]]<space/></arg><arg name="pages"><space/>209–234<space/></arg><arg name="isbn"><space/>9780737300987</arg></template><space/>In 1987, The North American Society of Teachers of the Alexander Technique was established to maintain high teaching standards.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Famous people who have studied the Alexander Technique include actors<space/><link><target>Michael Caine</target></link>,<space/><link><target>John Cleese</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Jamie Lee Curtis</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Judi Dench</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Suzanna Hamilton</target></link>,<space/><link><target>William Hurt</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Jeremy Irons</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Hugh Jackman</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Sir Ben Kingsley</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Kevin Kline</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Patti Lupone</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Paul Newman</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Mary Steenburgen</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Hilary Swank</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Robin Williams</target></link>; musicians<space/><link><target>Madonna (entertainer)</target><part>Madonna</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Paul McCartney</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Yehudi Menuhin</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Sting (musician)</target><part>Sting</part></link>; playwright<space/><link><target>George Bernard Shaw</target></link>; writers<space/><link><target>Roald Dahl</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Robertson Davies</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Aldous Huxley</target></link>; and Nobel Prize winner for medicine and physiology<space/><link><target>Nikolaas Tinbergen</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last">Rodenburg</arg><arg name="first">Kelly McEvenue ; [foreword by Patsy</arg><arg name="title">The actor and the Alexander technique</arg><arg name="year">2002</arg><arg name="publisher">Palgrave, Macmillan</arg><arg name="location">New York</arg><arg name="isbn">0312295154</arg><arg name="pages">xx</arg><arg name="edition">1st Palgrave Macmillan</arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last">Munden</arg><arg name="first">John B.

The technique is applied dynamically to everyday movements, as well as actions selected by students.</paragraph><paragraph>Actions such as sitting, squatting, lunging or walking are often selected by the teacher. Other actions may be selected by the student, tailored to their interests or work activities such as hobbies, computer use, lifting, driving or performance in acting, sports, speech or music. Alexander teachers often use themselves as examples. They demonstrate, explain, and analyze a student's moment to moment responses as well as using mirrors, video feedback or classmate observations. Guided modelling with light hand contact is the primary tool for detecting and guiding the way past unnecessary effort. Suggestions for improvements are often student-specific.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Arnold 1997"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="last"><space/>Arnold<space/></arg><arg name="first"><space/>Joan<space/></arg><arg name="author2">Hope Gillerman<space/></arg><arg name="title"><space/>Frequently Asked Questions<space/></arg><arg name="publisher"><space/>American Society for the Alexander Technique<space/></arg><arg name="year"><space/>1997<space/></arg><arg name="url"><space/>http://www.alexandertech.org/misc/faq.html<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2 May 2007<space/></arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Exercise as a teaching tool is deliberately omitted because of a common mistaken assumption that there exists a &quot;correct&quot; position. There are only two specific exercises practiced separately; the first is lying<space/><link><target>Supine position#Semi-supine</target><part>semi-supine</part></link>; resting in this way uses &quot;mechanical advantage&quot; as a means of releasing cumulative muscular tension. This position is sometimes referred to as &quot;constructive rest&quot;, or &quot;the balanced resting state&quot;. It's also a specific time to practice Alexander's principle of<space/><link><target>conscious</target></link><space/>&quot;directing&quot; without &quot;doing.&quot; The second exercise is the &quot;Whispered Ah,&quot; which is used to co-ordinate and free breathing &amp; vocal production.</paragraph><paragraph>Freedom, efficiency and patience are the prescribed values. Proscribed are unnecessary effort, self-limiting habits as well as mistaken perceptual assumptions. Students are led to change their largely automatic routines that are interpreted by the teacher to currently or cumulatively be physically limiting, inefficient or not in keeping with anatomical structure. The Alexander teacher provides verbal coaching while monitoring, guiding and preventing unnecessary habits at their source with a specialized hands-on assistance.
