'''Empedocles''' ({{IPAc-en|ɛ|m|ˈ|p|ɛ|d|ə|k|l|iː|z|}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἐμπεδοκλῆς}} {{IPA-grc|empedoklɛ̂ːs|}}, ''Empedoklēs''; c. 490 – c. 430 BC) was a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic philosopher]] and a citizen of [[Agrigento|Agrigentum]], a Greek city in [[Sicily]]. Empedocles' philosophy is best known for being the originator of the [[Cosmogony|cosmogenic]] theory of the four [[Classical elements]]. He also proposed powers called Love and Strife which would act as forces to bring about the mixture and separation of the elements. These physical speculations were part of a history of the universe which also dealt with the origin and development of life. Influenced by the [[Pythagoreans]], he supported the doctrine of [[reincarnation]]. Empedocles is generally considered the last Greek philosopher to record his ideas in verse. Some of his work survives, more than in the case of any other Presocratic philosopher. Empedocles' death was mythologized by ancient writers, and has been the subject of a number of literary treatments.

==Life==
[[File:Temple of Hera - Agrigento - Italy 2015.JPG|left|thumb|The temple of [[Hera]] at [[Agrigentum]], built when Empedocles was a young man, c. 470 BC.]]
Empedocles was born, c. 490 BC, at [[Agrigentum]] (Acragas) in [[Sicily]] to a distinguished family.<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 51</ref> Very little is known about his life. His father Meto seems to have been instrumental in overthrowing the tyrant of Agrigentum, presumably [[Thrasydaeus]] in 470 BC. Empedocles continued this tradition by helping to overthrow the succeeding [[oligarchic]] government. He is said to have been magnanimous in his support of the poor;<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 73</ref> severe in persecuting the overbearing conduct of the [[oligarchy|oligarchs]];<ref>Timaeus, ap. Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 64, comp. 65, 66</ref> and he even declined the sovereignty of the city when it was offered to him.<ref>Aristotle ap. Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 63; compare, however, Timaeus, ap. Diogenes Laërtius, 66, 76</ref>

His brilliant oratory,<ref>Satyrus, ap. Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 78; Timaeus, ap. Diogenes Laërtius, 67</ref> his penetrating knowledge of nature, and the reputation of his marvellous powers, including the curing of diseases, and averting epidemics,<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 60, 70, 69; Plutarch, ''de Curios. Princ.'', ''adv. Colotes''; Pliny, ''H. N.'' xxxvi. 27, and others</ref> produced many myths and stories surrounding his name. He was said to have been a magician and controller of storms, and he himself, in his famous poem ''Purifications'' seems to have promised miraculous powers, including the destruction of evil, the curing of old age, and the controlling of wind and rain.

Empedocles was acquainted or connected by friendship with the physicians [[Pausanias of Sicily|Pausanias]]<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 60, 61, 65, 69</ref> (his [[eromenos]]<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 60: "Pausanias, according to [[Aristippus]] and [[Satyrus the Peripatetic|Satyrus]], was his eromenos"</ref>) and [[Acron]];<ref>Pliny, ''Natural History'', xxix.1.4–5; cf. Suda, ''Akron''</ref> with various [[Pythagoras|Pythagoreans]]; and even, it is said, with [[Parmenides]] and [[Anaxagoras]].<ref>Suda, ''Empedocles''; Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 55, 56, etc.</ref> The only pupil of Empedocles who is mentioned is the [[sophist]] and [[rhetorician]] [[Gorgias]].<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 58</ref>

[[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]] and [[Dicaearchus]] spoke of the journey of Empedocles to the [[Peloponnese]], and of the admiration, which was paid to him there;<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 71, 67; Athenaeus, xiv.</ref> others mentioned his stay at [[Athens]], and in the newly founded colony of [[Thurii]], 446 BC;<ref>Suda, ''Akron''; Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 52</ref> there are also fanciful reports of him travelling far to the east to the lands of the [[Magi]].<ref>Pliny, ''H. N.'' xxx. 1, etc.</ref>

According to [[Aristotle]], he died at the age of sixty (c. 430 BC), even though other writers have him living up to the age of one hundred and nine.<ref>Apollonius, ap. Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 52, comp. 74, 73</ref> Likewise, there are myths concerning his death: a tradition, which is traced to [[Heraclides Ponticus]], represented him as having been removed from the Earth; whereas others had him perishing in the flames of Mount Etna.<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 67, 69, 70, 71; Horace, ''ad Pison.'' 464, etc.</ref>

A contemporary ''Life of Empedocles'' by [[Xanthus (historian)|Xanthus]] has been lost.

==Works==
[[File:Empedokles fragment Physika I 262–300.jpg|thumb|right|A piece of the Strasbourg Empedocles papyrus in the [[Bibliothèque nationale et universitaire]], Strasbourg]]
Empedocles is considered the last Greek philosopher to write in verse and the surviving fragments of his teaching are from two poems, ''Purifications'' and ''On Nature''. Empedocles was undoubtedly acquainted with the didactic poems of [[Xenophanes]] and [[Parmenides]]<ref>Hermippus and Theophrastus, ap. Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 55, 56</ref>&nbsp;– allusions to the latter can be found in the fragments,&nbsp;– but he seems to have surpassed them in the animation and richness of his style, and in the clearness of his descriptions and diction. [[Aristotle]] called him the father of [[rhetoric]], and, although he acknowledged only the [[Meter (poetry)|meter]] as a point of comparison between the poems of Empedocles and the epics of [[Homer]], he described Empedocles as Homeric and powerful in his diction.<ref>Aristotle, ''Poetics'', 1, ap. Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 57.</ref> [[Lucretius]] speaks of him with enthusiasm, and evidently viewed him as his model.<ref>See especially Lucretius, i. 716, etc.</ref> The two poems together comprised 5000 lines.<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 77</ref> About 550 lines of his poetry survive, although because ancient writers rarely mentioned which poem they were quoting, it is not always certain to which poem the quotes belong. Some scholars now believe that there was only one poem, and that the ''Purifications'' merely formed the beginning of ''On Nature''.<ref>Simon Trépanier, (2004), ''Empedocles: An Interpretation'', Routledge.</ref>

===''Purifications''===
We possess only about 100 lines of his ''Purifications''. It seems to have given a mythical account of the world which may, nevertheless, have been part of Empedocles' philosophical system. The first lines of the poem are preserved by [[Diogenes Laërtius]]:

<blockquote>
Friends who inhabit the mighty town by tawny Acragas<br>
which crowns the citadel, caring for good deeds,<br>
greetings; I, an immortal God, no longer mortal,<br>
wander among you, honoured by all,<br>
adorned with holy diadems and blooming garlands.<br>
To whatever illustrious towns I go,<br>
I am praised by men and women, and accompanied<br>
by thousands, who thirst for deliverance,<br>
some ask for prophecies, and some entreat,<br>
for remedies against all kinds of disease.<ref>[[Diels–Kranz numbering system|DK]] frag. B112 (Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 61)</ref>
</blockquote>

It was probably this work which contained a story about [[souls]],<ref>Frag. B115 (Plutarch, ''On Exile'', 607 C–E; Hippolytus, vii. 29)</ref> where we are told that there were once spirits who lived in a state of bliss, but having committed a crime (the nature of which is unknown) they were punished by being forced to become mortal beings, [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]] from body to body. [[Human]]s, animals, and even plants are such spirits. The moral conduct recommended in the poem may allow us to become like [[Pantheon (gods)|gods]] again.

===''On Nature''===
There are about 450 lines of his poem ''On Nature'' extant, including 70 lines which have been reconstructed from some papyrus scraps known as the ''Strasbourg Papyrus''. The poem originally consisted of 2000 lines of [[hexameter]] verse,<ref>Suda, ''Empedocles''</ref> and was addressed to [[Pausanias of Sicily|Pausanias]].<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 60</ref> It was this poem which outlined his philosophical system. In it, Empedocles explains not only the nature and history of the universe, including his theory of the four [[classical element]]s, but he describes theories on causation, perception, and thought, as well as explanations of terrestrial phenomena and biological processes.

==Philosophy==
[[File:Empedocles-2-sized.jpg|right|thumb|Empedocles as portrayed in the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]]]]
Although acquainted with the theories of the [[Eleatics]] and the [[Pythagoreans]], Empedocles did not belong to any one definite school. An [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] in his thinking, he combined much that had been suggested by [[Parmenides]], [[Pythagoras]] and the [[Ionian school (philosophy)|Ionian school]]s. He was a firm believer in [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic mysteries]], as well as a scientific thinker and a precursor of [[physics|physical science]]. Aristotle mentions Empedocles among the Ionic philosophers, and he places him in very close relation to the [[atomism|atomist]] philosophers and to [[Anaxagoras]].<ref>Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', i. 3, 4, 7, ''Phys.'' i. 4, ''de General, et Corr.'' i. 8, ''de Caelo'', iii. 7.</ref>

According to House (1956)<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/aristotlespoetic032945mbp|page=32|title=Aristotles Poetics|year=1956|author=Humphry House}}</ref>
:Another of the fragments of the dialogue ''On the Poets'' ([[Aristotle]]) treats more fully what is said in Poetics ch. i about ''Empedocles'', for though clearly implying that he was not a poet, Aristotle there says he is [[Homeric]], and an artist in language, skilled in metaphor and in the other devices of poetry.

Empedocles, like the Ionian philosophers and the atomists, continued the tradition of tragic thought which tried to find the basis of the relationship of the one and many. Each of the various philosophers, following Parmenides, derived from the Eleatics the conviction that an existence could not pass into non-existence, and vice versa. Yet, each one had his peculiar way of describing this relation of Divine and mortal thought and thus of the relation of the One and the Many. In order to account for change in the world, in accordance with the ontological requirements of the Eleatics, they viewed changes as the result of mixture and separation of unalterable fundamental realities. Empedocles held that the four elements (Water, Air, Earth, and Fire) were those unchangeable fundamental realities, which were themselves transfigured into successive worlds by the powers of Love and Strife (Heraclitus had explicated the Logos or the "unity of opposites"). <ref>James Luchte, Early Greek Thought: Before the Dawn, Bloomsbury, 2011.</ref>

===The four elements===
Empedocles established four ultimate [[classical elements|elements]] which make all the structures in the world—[[Fire (classical element)|fire]], [[Air (classical element)|air]], [[Water (classical element)|water]], [[Earth (classical element)|earth]].<ref>Frag. B17 (Simplicius, ''Physics'', 157–159)</ref> Empedocles called these four elements "roots", which he also identified with the mythical names of [[Zeus]], [[Hera]], [[Persephone|Nestis]], and [[Aidoneus]]<ref>Frag. B6 (Sextus Empiricus, ''Against the Mathematicians'', x, 315)</ref> (e.g., "Now hear the fourfold roots of everything: enlivening Hera, Hades, shining Zeus. And Nestis, moistening mortal springs with tears."<ref>[[Peter Kingsley (scholar)|Peter Kingsley]], in ''Ancient Philosophy, Mystery, and Magic: Empedocles and Pythagorean Tradition'' (Oxford University Press, 1995).</ref>) Empedocles never used the term "element" ({{lang-el|στοιχεῖον}}, ''stoicheion''), which seems to have been first used by [[Plato]].<ref>Plato, ''Timaeus'', 48b–c</ref> According to the different proportions in which these four indestructible and unchangeable elements are combined with each other the difference of the structure is produced. It is in the aggregation and segregation of elements thus arising, that Empedocles, like the atomists, found the real process which corresponds to what is popularly termed growth, increase or decrease. Nothing new comes or can come into being; the only change that can occur is a change in the juxtaposition of element with element. This theory of the four elements became the standard [[dogma]] for the next two thousand years.

===Love and Strife===
{{distinguish2|the Greek deities [[Aphrodite|of love]] and [[Eris (mythology)|strife]]}}
[[File:Empedocles cosmic cycle concept map.svg|300px|right|thumb|Empedocles cosmic cycle is based on the conflict between love and strife]]
The four elements, however, are simple, eternal, and unalterable, and as change is the consequence of their mixture and separation, it was also necessary to suppose the existence of moving powers to bring about mixture and separation. The four elements are both eternally brought into union and parted from one another by two divine powers, [[Love]] and [[Wikt:strife|Strife]]. Love ({{lang|grc|φιλότης}}) is responsible for the attraction of different forms of matter, and Strife ({{lang|grc|νεῖκος}}) is the cause for their separation.<ref>Frag. B35, B26 (Simplicius, ''Physics'', 31–34)</ref> If these elements make up of the universe, then Love and Strife explain their variation and harmony. Love and Strife are attractive and repulsive forces, respectively, which is plainly observable in human behavior, but also pervade the universe. The two forces wax and wane their dominance but neither force ever wholly disappears from the imposition of the other.

===The sphere of Empedocles===
As the best and original state, there was a time when the pure elements and the two powers co-existed in a condition of rest and inertness in the form of a sphere. The elements existed together in their purity, without mixture and separation, and the uniting power of Love predominated in the sphere: the separating power of Strife guarded the extreme edges of the sphere.<ref>Frag. B35 (Simplicius, ''Physics'', 31–34; ''On the Heavens'', 528–530)</ref> Since that time, strife gained more sway and the bond which kept the pure elementary substances together in the sphere was dissolved. The elements became the world of phenomena we see today, full of contrasts and oppositions, operated on by both Love and Strife. The sphere being the embodiment of pure existence is the embodiment or representative of [[God]]. Empedocles assumed a cyclical universe whereby the elements return and prepare the formation of the sphere for the next period of the universe.

===Cosmogony===
Since the time of the sphere, Strife has gained more sway; and the actual world is full of contrasts and oppositions, due to the combined action of both principles. Empedocles attempted to explain the separation of elements, the formation of earth and sea, of Sun and Moon, of atmosphere. He also dealt with the first origin of plants and animals, and with the [[physiology]] of humans. As the elements entered into combinations, there appeared strange results&nbsp;– heads without necks, arms without shoulders.<ref>Frag. B57 (Simplicius, ''On the Heavens'', 586)</ref> Then as these fragmentary structures met, there were seen horned heads on human bodies, bodies of oxen with human heads, and figures of [[intersexuality|double sex]].<ref>Frag. B61 (Aelian, ''On Animals'', xvi 29)</ref> But most of these products of natural forces disappeared as suddenly as they arose; only in those rare cases where the parts were found to be adapted to each other, did the complex structures last. Thus the organic universe sprang from spontaneous aggregations, which suited each other as if this had been intended. Soon various influences reduced the creatures of double sex to a male and a female, and the world was replenished with organic life. It is possible to see this theory as an anticipation of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory of [[natural selection]], although Empedocles was not trying to explain [[evolution]].<ref>Ted Everson (2007), ''The gene: a historical perspective'' page 5. Greenwood</ref>

===Perception and knowledge===
Empedocles is credited with the first comprehensive theory of light and vision. He put forward the idea that we see objects because light streams out of our eyes and touches them. While flawed in hindsight, this became the fundamental basis on which later Greek philosophers and mathematicians, such as [[Euclid]], would construct some of the most important theories on light, vision and optics.<ref name = Ep1>''[[Let There be Light]]'' 7 August 2006 01:50 BBC Four</ref>

Knowledge is explained by the principle that the elements in the things outside us are perceived by the corresponding elements in ourselves.<ref>Frag. B109 (Aristotle, ''On the Soul'', 404b11–15)</ref> Like is known by like. The whole body is full of [[Sweat pore|pores]] and hence [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] takes place over the whole frame. In the organs of sense these pores are specially adapted to receive the effluences which are continually rising from bodies around us; and in this way [[perception]] is explained.<ref name="frag100">Frag. B100 (Aristotle, ''On Respiration'', 473b1–474a6)</ref> Thus in vision, certain particles go forth from the eye to meet similar particles given forth from the object, and the resultant contact constitutes vision.<ref>Frag. B84 (Aristotle, ''On the Senses and their Objects'', 437b23-438a5)</ref> Perception is not merely a passive reflection of external objects.

Empedocles noted the limitation and narrowness of human perceptions. We see only a part, but fancy that we have grasped the whole. But the senses cannot lead to truth; thought and reflection must look at the thing on every side. It is the business of a philosopher, while laying bare the fundamental difference of elements, to display the identity that exists between what seem unconnected parts of the universe.<ref>Frag. B2 (Sextus Empiricus, ''Against the Mathematicians'', vii. 123–125)</ref>

===Respiration===
In a famous fragment,<ref name="frag100"/> Empedocles attempted to explain the phenomena of [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] by means of an elaborate analogy with the [[Water thief|clepsydra]] or [[water clock]], an ancient device for transmitting liquids from one vessel to another.<ref name="barnes313">[[Jonathan Barnes]] (2002), ''The Presocratic Philosophers'', page 313. Routledge</ref> This fragment has sometimes been connected to a passage in [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' where Aristotle refers to people who twisted wineskins and captured air in clepsydras to demonstrate that [[Vacuum|void]] does not exist.<ref>Aristotle, ''Physics'', 213a24–7</ref> There is however, no evidence that Empedocles performed any experiment with clepsydras.<ref name="barnes313"/> The fragment certainly implies that Empedocles knew about the [[Matter|corporeality]] of air, but he says nothing whatever about the void.<ref name="barnes313"/> The clepsydra was a common utensil and everyone who used it must have known, in some sense, that the invisible air could resist liquid.<ref name="guthrie224">[[W. K. C. Guthrie]], (1980), ''A history of Greek philosophy II: The Presocratic tradition from Parmenides to Democritus'', page 224. Cambridge University Press</ref>

===Reincarnation===
Like [[Pythagoras]], Empedocles believed in the [[transmigration of the soul]], that souls can be reincarnated between humans, animals and even plants.<ref>Frag. B127 (Aelian, ''On Animals'', xii. 7); Frag. B117 (Hippolytus, i. 3.2)</ref> For Empedocles, all living things were on the same spiritual plane; plants and animals are links in a chain where humans are a link too. Empedocles urged a [[vegetarian]] lifestyle, since the bodies of animals are the dwelling places of punished souls.<ref>Sextus Empiricus, ''Against the Mathematicians'', ix. 127; Hippolytus, vii. 21</ref> Wise people, who have learned the secret of life, are next to the [[divinity|divine]],<ref>Clement of Alexandria, ''Miscellanies'', iv. 23.150</ref> and their souls, free from the cycle of reincarnations, are able to rest in happiness for eternity.<ref>Clement of Alexandria, ''Miscellanies'', v. 14.122</ref>

==Death and literary treatments==
[[File:Aetna1.jpg|right|thumb|[[Mount Etna]] in Sicily, the legendary location of Empedocles' alleged suicide]]
[[Diogenes Laërtius]] records the legend that Empedocles died by throwing himself into [[Mount Etna]] in Sicily, so that the people would believe his body had vanished and he had turned into an immortal god;<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 69</ref> the volcano, however, threw back one of his bronze sandals, revealing the deceit. Another legend maintains that he threw himself into the volcano to prove to his disciples that he was immortal; he believed he would come back as a god after being consumed by the fire. [[Horace]] also refers the death of Empedocles in his work "''[[Ars Poetica]]''" and admits poets the right to destroy themselves.<ref>Horace, "''[[Ars Poetica]]''", 465–466</ref>

In ''Icaro-Menippus'', a comedic dialogue written by the second century satirist [[Lucian of Samosata]], Empedocles’ final fate is re-evaluated. Rather than being incinerated in the fires of Mount Etna, he was carried up into the heavens by a volcanic eruption. Although a bit singed by the ordeal, Empedocles survives and continues his life on the Moon, surviving by feeding on dew.

Empedocles' death has inspired two major modern literary treatments. Empedocles' death is the subject of [[Friedrich Hölderlin]]'s play ''Tod des Empedokles'' (''[[The Death of Empedocles]]''), two versions of which were written between the years 1798 and 1800. A third version was made public in 1826. In [[Matthew Arnold]]'s poem ''Empedocles on Etna'', a narrative of the philosopher's last hours before he jumps to his death in the crater first published in 1852, Empedocles predicts:

<blockquote>
To the elements it came from <br>
Everything will return. <br>
Our bodies to earth,<br>
Our blood to water,<br>
Heat to fire,<br>
Breath to air.
</blockquote>

In his ''[[A History of Western Philosophy|History of Western Philosophy]]'', [[Bertrand Russell]] quotes an unnamed poet on the subject&nbsp;– "Great Empedocles, that ardent soul, Leapt into Etna, and was roasted whole."<ref>Bertrand Russell, ''A History of Western Philosophy'', 1946, [http://books.google.gr/books?id=Ey94E3sOMA0C&pg=PA60&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 60]</ref>

In 2006, a massive underwater volcano off the coast of Sicily was named [[Empedocles (volcano)|Empedocles]].<ref>BBC News, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5108360.stm ''Underwater volcano found by Italy''], 23 June 2006</ref>
