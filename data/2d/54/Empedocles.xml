Each of the various philosophers, following Parmenides, derived from the Eleatics the conviction that an existence could not pass into non-existence, and vice versa. Yet, each one had his peculiar way of describing this relation of Divine and mortal thought and thus of the relation of the One and the Many. In order to account for change in the world, in accordance with the ontological requirements of the Eleatics, they viewed changes as the result of mixture and separation of unalterable fundamental realities. Empedocles held that the four elements (Water, Air, Earth, and Fire) were those unchangeable fundamental realities, which were themselves transfigured into successive worlds by the powers of Love and Strife (Heraclitus had explicated the Logos or the &quot;unity of opposites&quot;).<space/><extension extension_name='ref'>James Luchte, Early Greek Thought: Before the Dawn, Bloomsbury, 2011.</extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>The four elements</heading><paragraph>Empedocles established four ultimate<space/><link><target>classical elements</target><part>elements</part></link><space/>which make all the structures in the world<link><target>Fire (classical element)</target><part>fire</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Air (classical element)</target><part>air</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Water (classical element)</target><part>water</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Earth (classical element)</target><part>earth</part></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'>Frag.

It is in the aggregation and segregation of elements thus arising, that Empedocles, like the atomists, found the real process which corresponds to what is popularly termed growth, increase or decrease. Nothing new comes or can come into being; the only change that can occur is a change in the juxtaposition of element with element.

Love (<template><target>lang</target><arg>grc</arg><arg>φιλότης</arg></template>) is responsible for the attraction of different forms of matter, and Strife (<template><target>lang</target><arg>grc</arg><arg>νεῖκος</arg></template>) is the cause for their separation.<extension extension_name='ref'>Frag.

Love and Strife are attractive and repulsive forces, respectively, which is plainly observable in human behavior, but also pervade the universe. The two forces wax and wane their dominance but neither force ever wholly disappears from the imposition of the other.</paragraph><heading level='3'>The sphere of Empedocles</heading><paragraph>As the best and original state, there was a time when the pure elements and the two powers co-existed in a condition of rest and inertness in the form of a sphere.

The elements became the world of phenomena we see today, full of contrasts and oppositions, operated on by both Love and Strife.

Empedocles attempted to explain the separation of elements, the formation of earth and sea, of Sun and Moon, of atmosphere. He also dealt with the first origin of plants and animals, and with the<space/><link><target>physiology</target></link><space/>of humans.

Thus the organic universe sprang from spontaneous aggregations, which suited each other as if this had been intended.
