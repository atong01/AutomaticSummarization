A '''Christmas tree''' is a decorated tree, usually an [[evergreen]] [[pinophyta|conifer]] such as [[spruce]], [[pine]], or [[fir]] or an artificial tree of similar appearance, associated with the celebration of [[Christmas]].

The custom of the Christmas tree developed in [[early Modern history of Germany|early modern Germany]] (where it is today called ''Weihnachtsbaum'' or ''Christbaum'' or "Tannenbaum") with predecessors that can be traced to the 16th and possibly 15th century, in which devout Christians brought decorated trees into their homes.<ref name="History.com">{{cite web |title=History of Christmas Trees |url=http://www.history.com/topics/history-of-christmas-trees |publisher=[[History (TV channel)|History]] |accessdate=15 December 2012 }}</ref><ref>Christmas trees were hung in [[St. George's Church, Sélestat]] since 1521:[http://www.selestat.fr/spip_noel/IMG/pdf/histoire_des_decorations_de_l_arbre_de_noel.pdf Selestat.fr - Office de la Culture de Sélestat - The history of the Christmas tree since 1521]</ref>  It acquired popularity beyond [[Germany]] during the second half of the 19th century, at first among the upper classes.<ref name="Weber-Kellermann">{{cite book |author=Ingeborg Weber-Kellermann |title=Das Weihnachtsfest.

The tree was traditionally decorated with edibles such as apples, nuts, or other foods. In the 18th century, it began to be illuminated by candles which were ultimately replaced by [[Christmas lights]] after the advent of [[electrification]]. Today, there are a wide variety of [[Christmas ornament|traditional ornaments]], such as [[garland]], [[tinsel]], and [[candy cane]]s. An angel or star might be [[tree-topper|placed at the top of the tree]] to represent the [[archangel]] [[Gabriel]] or the [[Star of Bethlehem]] from the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]].<ref name="Mandryk2005"/><ref name="Jones2011"/>

The Christmas tree has also been known as the "[[Yule]]-tree", especially in discussions of its folkloric origins.<ref>{{cite book |author=Daniel J.

[[File:yggdrasil.jpg|thumb|upright| From ''Northern Antiquities'', an English translation of the [[Prose Edda]] from 1847. Painted by Oluf Olufsen Bagge.]]
While it is clear that the modern Christmas tree originated during the [[German Renaissance|Renaissance]] of [[early Modern history of Germany|early modern Germany]], there are a number of speculative theories as to its ultimate origin. Its 16th-century origins are sometimes associated with Protestant Christian reformer [[Martin Luther]] who is said to have first added lighted candles to an [[evergreen]] tree.<ref name="History.com"/><ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ikyr6IrlD5wC&pg=PA119 |author=Helen Haidle |title=Christmas Legends to Remember' |year=2002 |isbn=978-1-56292-534-5 |page=119 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://booheyheyks.google.com/books?id=YDx3g-05fNoC&lpg=PA22 |author=Debbie Trafton O'Neal, David LaRochelle |title=Before and After Christmas |publisher=Augsburg Fortress |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8066-4156-0 |page=22 }}</ref>

It is frequently traced to the symbolism of trees in pre-Christian winter rites, in particular through the story of [[Donar's Oak]] and the popularized story of [[Saint Boniface]] and the conversion of the German pagans, in which Saint Boniface cuts down an oak tree that the German pagans worshipped, and replaces it with an evergreen tree, telling them about how its triangular shape reminds humanity of the [[Trinity]] and how it points to heaven.<ref>{{cite book|author=Fritz Allhoff, Scott C. Lowe|title=Christmas|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|year=2010|quote=His biographer, Eddius Stephanus, relates that while Boniface was serving as a missionary near Geismar, Germany, he had enough of the locals' reverence for the old gods. Taking an axe to an oak tree dedicated to Norse god Thor, Boniface chopped the tree down and dared Thor to zap him for it. When nothing happened, Boniface pointed out a young fir tree amid the roots of the oak and explained how this tree was a more fitting object of reverence as it pointed towards the Christian heaven and its triangular shape was reminiscent of the Christian trinity.}}</ref><ref>The story, not recounted in the ''[[hagiography|vitae]]'' written in his time, appears in a [[BBC]] Devon website, "Devon Myths and Legends", and in a number of educational storybooks, including ''St. Boniface and the Little Fir Tree: A Story to Color'' by Jenny Melmoth and Val Hayward (Warrington: Alfresco Books 1999 ISBN 1-873727-15-1), ''The Brightest Star of All: Christmas Stories for the Family'' by Carrie Papa (Abingdon Press 1999 ISBN 978-0-687-64813-9) and [http://books.google.com/books?id=BdEAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA207 "How Saint Boniface Kept Christmas Eve"] by Mary Louise Harvey in ''The American Normal Readers: Fifth Book'', 207-22. Silver, Burdett and Co. 1912.</ref>

According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', "The use of evergreen trees, wreaths, and garlands to symbolize eternal life was a custom of the ancient Egyptians, Chinese, and Hebrews. Tree worship was common among the pagan Europeans and survived their conversion to Christianity in the Scandinavian customs of decorating the house and barn with evergreens at the New Year to scare away the devil and of setting up a tree for the birds during Christmastime."<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2012 |title=Christmas tree |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/115737/Christmas-tree }}</ref>

Alternatively, it is identified with the "[[tree of life (biblical)|tree of paradise]]" of medieval [[mystery play]]s that were given on 24 December, the commemoration and [[name day]] of [[Adam and Eve]] in various countries. In such plays, a tree decorated with apples (to represent the forbidden fruit) and wafers (to represent the [[Eucharist]] and redemption) was used as a setting for the play. Like the [[Nativity scene|Christmas crib]], the Paradise tree was later placed in homes. The apples were replaced by round objects such as shiny red balls.<ref name="Dues"/><ref name="Karas"/><ref name="Lazowski">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HIhIPIYLQ6QC&pg=PA204 |author=Philip Lazowski |title=Understanding Your Neighbor's Faith |publisher=KTAV Publishing House |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-88125-811-0 |pages=203–04 }}</ref><ref name="Foley">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XstmMVLDzIIC&pg=PA18 |author=Michael P.

They hung wafers on it (symbolizing the host, the Christian sign of redemption); in a later tradition, the wafers were replaced by cookies of various shapes. Candles, too, were often added as the symbol of Christ. In the same room, during the Christmas season, was the [[Christmas pyramid]], a triangular construction of wood, with shelves to hold Christmas figurines, decorated with evergreens, candles, and a star. By the 16th century, the Christmas pyramid and paradise tree had merged, becoming the Christmas tree. |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |year=2003 }}</ref>

====Georgia====
[[File:Chichilaki Georgian christmass tree.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Chichilaki]], a Georgian Christmas tree variety.]]

The [[Georgians]] have their own traditional Christmas tree called [[Chichilaki]], made from dried up [[hazelnut]] or [[walnut]] branches that are shaped to form a small coniferous tree. These pale-colored ornaments differ in height from {{convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} to {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}. Chichilakis are most common in the [[Guria]] and [[Samegrelo]] regions of Georgia near the [[Black Sea]], but they can also be found in some stores around the capital of [[Tbilisi]].
[[Georgians]] believe that [[Chichilaki]] resembles the famous beard of [[St. Basil the Great]], who is thought to visit people during [[Christmas]] similar to the [[Santa Claus]] tradition.

====Poland====
There was an old [[pagan]] custom of suspending at the ceiling a branch of fir, spruce or pine called [[Podłaźniczka]] associated with [[Koliada]]. The branches were decorated with apples, nuts, cookies, colored paper, stars made of straw, ribbons and colored wafers. Some people believed that the tree had magical powers that were linked with harvesting and success in the next year.

In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, these traditions were almost completely replaced by the German custom of decorating the Christmas tree.

====Scandinavia and Germany====

In [[Norse mythology]], the oak was sacred to the thunder god, [[Thor]].  [[Thor's Oak]] was a [[sacred tree]] of the Germanic [[Chatti]] tribe. According to legend, the [[Christianisation]] of the heathen tribes by [[Saint Boniface]] was marked by the oak's being replaced by the [[fir]] (whose triangular shape symbolizes the [[Trinity]]) as a "sacred" tree.<ref>{{cite web |title= The Chronological History of the Christmas Tree |url= http://www.christmasarchives.com/trees.html |work= The Christmas Archives |last= von Staufer |first= Maria |accessdate= 2010-02-07}}</ref>

====Estonia and Latvia====
[[File:Franz Skarbina Unter dem Weihnachtsbaum.jpg|thumb|200px|Girl with Christmas tree, painting 1892 by [[Franz Skarbina]] (1849-1910)]]
Customs of erecting decorated trees in wintertime can be traced to Christmas celebrations in Renaissance-era [[guild]]s in [[Northern Germany]] and [[Livonia]]. The first evidence of decorated trees associated with Christmas Day are trees in guildhalls decorated with sweets to be enjoyed by the apprentices and children. In [[Livonia]] (present-day [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]]), in 1441, 1442, 1510 and 1514, the [[Brotherhood of Blackheads]] erected a tree for the holidays in their guild houses in [[Riga]] and Reval (now [[Tallinn]]). On the last night of the celebrations leading up to the holidays, the tree was taken to the [[Town Hall Square, Tallinn|Town Hall Square]] where the members of the brotherhood danced around it.<ref>{{cite book |author=Friedrich Amelung |title=Geschichte der Revaler Schwarzenhäupter: von ihrem Ursprung an bis auf die Gegenwart: nach den urkundenmäßigen Quellen des Revaler Schwarzenhäupter-Archivs 1, Die erste Blütezeit von 1399–1557  |language=de|trans_title=History of the Tallinn Blackheads: from their origins until the present day: from the testimonial sources of the Tallinn Blackheads archive. 1: The first golden age of 1399–1557 |location=[[Tallinn|Reval]] |publisher=Wassermann |year=1885 }}</ref> A [[Bremen]] guild chronicle of 1570 reports that a small tree decorated with "apples, nuts, dates, pretzels and paper flowers" was erected in the guild-house for the benefit of the guild members' children, who collected the dainties on Christmas Day.<ref name="Weber-Kellermann"/> In 1584, the pastor and chronicler [[Balthasar Russow]] in his ''{{lang|gml|Chronica der Provinz Lyfflandt}}'' (1584) wrote of an established tradition of setting up a decorated [[Picea abies|spruce]] at the market square where the young men "went with a flock of maidens and women, first sang and danced there and then set the tree aflame".

After the [[Protestant Reformation]], such trees are seen in the houses of upper-class Protestant families as a counterpart to the Catholic [[Nativity scene|Christmas cribs]]. This transition from the guild hall to the bourgeois family homes in the Protestant parts of Germany ultimately gives rise to the modern tradition as it developed in the 18th and 19th centuries.

===18th to early 20th centuries===

====Germany====
[[File:Die Gartenlaube (1888) Nr49 Beilage.jpg|thumb|200px| A little Christmas tree on the table, painting by Ludwig Blume-Siebert in 1888]]

By the early 18th century, the custom had become common in towns of the upper [[Rhineland]], but it had not yet spread to rural areas. Wax candles, expensive items at the time, are found in attestations from the late 18th century.

Along the lower Rhine, an area of Roman Catholic majority, the Christmas tree was largely regarded as a Protestant custom. As a result, it remained confined to the upper Rhineland for a relatively long period of time. The custom did eventually gain wider acceptance beginning around 1815 by way of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] officials who emigrated there following the [[Congress of Vienna]].

In the 19th century, the Christmas tree was taken to be an expression of [[Culture of Germany|German culture]] and of ''{{lang|de|[[Gemütlichkeit]]}}'', especially among [[ethnic Germans|emigrants]] overseas.<ref>{{cite book |author=Johannes Marbach |title=Die heilige Weihnachtszeit nach Bedeutung, Geschichte, Sitten und Symbolen|language=German |trans_title=The holy Christmas season for meaning, history, customs and symbols |year=1859 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FXhEAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA416 |page=416 |quote=''{{lang|de|Was ist auch eine deutsche Christenfamilie am Christabend ohne Christbäumchen?

A decisive factor in winning general popularity was the German army's decision to place Christmas trees in its barracks and military hospitals during the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. Only at the start of the 20th century did Christmas trees appear inside churches, this time in a new brightly lit form.<ref name="Hermelink">{{cite book |author=Jan Hermelink |chapter=Weihnachtsgottesdienst |trans_chapter=Christmas worship |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=WOrt4xXGSKcC&pg=PA290 |editor=Christian Grethlein |editor2=Günter Ruddat |title=Liturgisches Kompendium|language=German |publisher=Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht |year=2003 |isbn=978-3-525-57211-5 |page=290 }}</ref>

====Adoption by European nobility====
[[File:Woonkamer vol keurig geklede kinderen die bij de kerstboom dansen.jpg|thumb|200px| Christmas tree painting 1877 by H. J. Overbeek]]
In the early 19th century, the custom became popular among the nobility and spread to royal courts as far as Russia. [[Princess Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg]] introduced the Christmas tree to [[Vienna]] in 1816, and the custom spread across Austria in the following years. In [[France]], the first Christmas tree was introduced in 1840 by the [[Prince Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orléans|duchesse d'Orléans]]. In Denmark a Danish newspaper claims that the first attested Christmas tree was lit in 1808 by countess Wilhemine of Holsteinborg. It was the aging countess who told the story of the first Danish Christmas tree to the Danish writer [[Hans Christian Andersen]] in 1865. He had published a fairy-tale called ''[[The Fir-Tree]]'' in 1844, recounting the fate of a fir-tree being used as a Christmas tree.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/307946:Kronik--Danmarks-foerste-juletrae-blev-taendt-i-1808 |work=Kristelig Dagblad |title=Danmarks første juletræ blev tændt i 1808 |date=December 17, 2008 }}</ref>

Although the tradition of decorating the home with evergreens was long established, the custom of decorating an entire small tree was unknown in Britain until some two centuries ago. At the time of the [[personal union]] with [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]], [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]'s German-born wife, [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]], introduced a Christmas tree at a party she gave for children in 1800.<ref>[http://www.thamesweb.co.uk/christmas/christmas_tree.html At Queen's Lodge, Windsor]</ref> The custom did not at first spread much beyond the royal family.<ref>In 1829 the diarist [[Charles Greville (diarist)|Greville]], visiting [[Panshanger]] country house, describes three small Christmas trees "such as is customary in Germany" which [[Dorothea Lieven|Princess Lieven]] had put up. {{cite book|last=Hole|first=Christine|title=English Custom and Usage|year=1950|publisher=B.T.Batsford Ltd|location=London|pages=16}}</ref> Queen Victoria as a child was familiar with it and a tree was placed in her room every Christmas.

The lyrics sung in the United States to the German tune ''{{lang|de|[[O Tannenbaum]]}}'' begin "O Christmas tree", giving rise to the mistaken idea that the [[German language|German]] word ''{{lang|de|Tannenbaum}}'' (fir tree) means "Christmas tree", the German word for which is instead ''{{lang|de|Weihnachtsbaum}}''.

When Johnson was Vice President of the Edison Electric Light Company, a predecessor of Con Edison, he created the first known electrically illuminated Christmas tree at his home in New York City in 1882. Edward H. Johnson became the Father of Electric Christmas Tree Lights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldchristmastreelights.com/history.htm |title=A Brief History of Electric Christmas Lighting in America|publisher=www.oldchristmastreelights|accessdate=2014}}</ref>

In [[Russia]], the Christmas tree was banned shortly after the [[October Revolution]]{{fact|date=September 2015}} but then reinstated as a ''New-year spruce'' ({{lang|ru|Новогодняя ёлка, ''Novogodnyaya yolka''}}) in 1935. It became a fully secular icon of the [[New Year]] holiday, for example, the crowning star was regarded not as a symbol of Bethlehem Star, but as the [[Red star|Red Star]]. Decorations, such as figurines of airplanes, bicycles, space rockets, [[cosmonaut]]s, and characters of Russian fairy tales, were produced. This tradition persists after the fall of the USSR, with the [[Novy God|New Year holiday]] outweighing the Christmas (7 January) for a wide majority of Russian people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.levada.ru/27-04-2012/1-maya-sobirayutsya-prazdnovat-59-rossiyan |title=1 мая собираются праздновать 59% россиян |trans_title=May 1 going to celebrate 59% of Russians |date=April 27, 2012 |accessdate=December 2, 2012 |language=Russian |quote=New Year is among the most important holidays for 81% of Russians, while Christmas is such only for 19%, ranking after [[Victory Day]], [[Easter]], [[International Women's Day]]. }}</ref>

The TV special ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'' (1965) was influential on the pop culture surrounding the Christmas tree. [[Aluminum Christmas tree]]s were popular during the early 1960s in the US. They were satirized in the Charlie Brown show and came to be seen as symbolizing the commercialization of Christmas. The term  ''Charlie Brown Christmas tree'', describing any poor-looking or malformed little tree, also derives from the 1965 TV special, based on the appearance of [[Charlie Brown]]'s Christmas tree.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/|title = Materialism and the Modern U.S. Christmas|last = Belk|first = Russell|date = 2000|journal = Advertising & Society Review|accessdate = October 5, 2014|doi = |pmid = }}</ref>

Since the early 20th century, it has become common in many cities, towns, and department stores to put up public Christmas trees outdoors, such as the [[Macy's Great Tree]] in [[Atlanta]] (since 1948), the [[Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree]] in New York City, and the large Christmas tree at [[Victoria Square, Adelaide|Victoria Square]] in [[Adelaide]].

The use of fire retardant allows many indoor public areas to place real trees -and be compliant with code.   Licensed applicants of fire retardant solution spray the tree, tag the tree, and provide a certificate for inspection.  Real trees are popular with high end visual merchandising displays  around the world.  Leading global retailers like Apple often place real trees in their window display.  In 2009 Apple placed 2 Fraser fir for every store in the world.  The trees were supplied from North Pole Xmas Trees in Nashua NH USA.  In addition, using a real tree rather than a fake reflects a greater corporate responsibility to the environment.

The United States' [[National Christmas Tree (United States)|National Christmas Tree]] has been lit each year since 1923 on the South Lawn of the [[White House]]. Today,{{clarify|date=February 2012}} the lighting of the National Christmas Tree is part of what has become a major holiday event at the White House. President [[Jimmy Carter]] lit only the crowning star atop the tree in 1979 in honour of the Americans being [[Iran hostage crisis|held hostage in Iran]].<ref name="npspp">{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/whho/historyculture/lighting-of-the-national-christmas-tree-history.htm |title=Lighting of the National Christmas Tree |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |accessdate=April 5, 2009 }}</ref> The same was true in 1980, except that the tree was fully lit for 417 seconds, one second for each day the hostages had been in captivity.<ref name="npspp"/>

During most of the 1970s and 1980s, the largest decorated Christmas tree in the world was put up every year on the property of the ''[[National Enquirer]]'' in [[Lantana, Florida]]. This tradition grew into one of the most spectacular and celebrated events in the history of southern Florida, but was discontinued on the death of the paper's founder in the late 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Flashback Blog: The World's Largest Decorated Christmas Tree |work=[[The Palm Beach Post]] |date=December 3, 2009 |url=http://www.historicpalmbeach.com/flashback/2009/12/the-worlds-largest-decorated-christmas-tree |accessdate=March 4, 2010 }}</ref>

In some cities, a [[Festival of Trees]] is organized around the decoration and display of multiple trees as charity events.

The giving of Christmas trees has also often been associated with the end of hostilities. After the signing of the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]] in 1918 the city of [[Manchester]] sent a tree, and £500 to buy chocolate and cakes, for the children of the much-bombarded town of [[Lille]] in northern France.<ref>'Manchester's Gift To Lille..(FROM G. WARD PRICE.)' ''The Times'' (London, England),21 December 1918, p.7</ref> In some cases the trees represent special commemorative gifts, such as in [[Trafalgar Square]] in [[London]], where the City of [[Oslo]], [[Norway]] presents a tree to the people of London as a token of appreciation for the British support of Norwegian resistance during the [[World War II|Second World War]]; in [[Boston]], where the tree is a gift from the province of [[Nova Scotia]], in thanks for rapid deployment of supplies and rescuers to the 1917 [[Halifax Explosion|ammunition ship explosion]] that levelled the city of [[Halifax (former city)|Halifax]]; and in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], where the main civic Christmas tree is an annual gift from the city of [[Bergen]], in thanks for the part played by soldiers from Newcastle in liberating Bergen from [[Nazism|Nazi]] occupation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newcastle.gov.uk/core.nsf/a/twintownbergen |title=Town twinning: Bergen, Norway |publisher=[[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle City Council]] }}</ref> Norway also annually gifts a Christmas tree to [[Washington, D.C.]] as a symbol of friendship between Norway and the US and as an expression of gratitude from Norway for the help received from the US during World War II.<ref>{{cite news |title=DC: Christmas Tree Lighting at Union Station |url=http://www.norway.org/News_and_events/Christmas-2012/DC-Christmas-Tree-Lighting-at-Union-Station/ |publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] |accessdate=December 2, 2012 }}</ref>

}}

[[File:Candle on Christmas tree 3.jpg|thumb|A candle on a Christmas tree]]
Both setting up and taking down a Christmas tree are associated with specific dates. Traditionally, Christmas trees were not brought in and decorated until [[Christmas Eve]] (24 December){{Citation needed |date=December 2011}} or, in the traditions celebrating Christmas Eve rather than [[Twelve Days of Christmas|the first day of Christmas]], 23 December, and then removed the day after [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]] (5 January); to have a tree up before or after these dates was even considered bad luck.{{Citation needed |date=December 2011}}

In many areas, it has become customary to set up one's Christmas tree at the beginning of the [[Advent]] season.<ref>{{cite book |author=Peter Mazar |title=School Year, Church Year: Customs and Decorations for the Classroom |year=2000 |publisher=Liturgy Training Publications |isbn=1568542402 |pages=161 }}</ref> Some families in the U.S. and Canada will put up a Christmas tree a week prior to American [[Thanksgiving]] (the fourth Thursday of November), and Christmas decorations can show up even earlier in retail stores, often the day after [[Halloween]] (31 October). Some households do not put up the tree until the second week of December, and leave it up until 6 January ([[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]]). In Germany, traditionally the tree is put up on 24 December and taken down on 7 January, though many start one or two weeks earlier, and in Roman Catholic homes the tree may be kept until February 2 (Candlemas).{{why |date=December 2012}}{{citation needed |date=December 2012}}

In [[Italy]] and [[Argentina]], along with many countries in Latin America, the Christmas tree is put up on 8 December ([[Immaculate Conception|Immaculate Conception day]]) and left up until 6 January. In Australia, the Christmas tree is usually put up on 1 December, which occurs about a week before the school summer holidays; except for South Australia, where most people put up their tree after the Adelaide Christmas Pageant in late November.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Some traditions suggest that Christmas trees may be kept up until no later than 2 February, the feast of the [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]] (Candlemas), when the Christmas season effectively closes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.holytrinitygerman.org/postepiphanycustoms.html |title=Customs of the Weeks after Epiphany |publisher=Holy Trinity (German) Catholic Church, Boston |accessdate=December 2, 2012 }}</ref> Superstitions say that it is a bad sign if Christmas greenery is not removed by Candlemas Eve.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/holidays/christmas/superstitions.asp |title=Christmas Superstitions |date=December 2006 |publisher=[[Snopes.com]] }}</ref>

[[File:Christmas market, Strasbourg (5226805005).jpg|thumb|||Christmas ornaments at the [[Christmas market]], Strasbourg ]]

Christmas ornaments are decorations (usually made of glass, metal, wood, or ceramics) that are used to  decorate a Christmas tree. The first decorated trees were adorned with apples, white candy canes and pastries in the shapes of stars, hearts and flowers.  [[Glass]] baubles were first made in [[Lauscha]], [[Germany]],  garlands of glass beads and [[tin]] figures that could be hung on trees. The popularity of these decorations grew into the production of glass figures made by highly skilled [[artisans]] with [[clay]] molds.

The ornaments were hand-painted and topped with a cap and hook.<ref name="ReferenceA">Ace Collins ''Stories Behind the Great Traditions of Christmas''. 2003; Zondervan.</ref>
Tinsel and several types of garland or ribbon are commonly used to decorate a Christmas tree. Silvered [[saran (plastic)|saran]]-based tinsel was introduced later. Delicate mold-blown and painted colored glass Christmas ornaments were a speciality of the glass factories in the [[Thuringian Forest]], especially in [[Lauscha]] in the late 19th century, and have since become a large industry, complete with famous-name designers. Baubles are another common decoration, consisting of small hollow glass or plastic spheres coated with a thin metallic layer to make them reflective, with a further coating of a thin pigmented polymer in order to provide coloration. Lighting with electric lights ([[Christmas lights|fairy lights]]) is commonly done. A [[tree-topper]], sometimes an angel but more frequently a star, completes the decoration.

Individuals' decorations typically include a mix of family traditions and personal tastes; even a small unattractive ornament, if passed down from a parent or grandparent, may come to carry considerable emotional value and be given a place of pride on the tree. Conversely, trees decorated by professional designers for department stores and other institutions will usually have a "theme"; a set of predominant colours, multiple instances of each type of ornament, and larger decorations that may be more complicated to set up correctly. Some churches decorate with Chrismon trees, which use handmade ornaments depicting various [[Chrismon]] symbols.

Many people also decorate outdoor trees with food that birds and other wildlife will enjoy, such as garlands made from unsalted popcorn or cranberries, orange halves, and seed-covered [[suet]] cakes.

Because candles were used to light trees until electric bulbs came about, a mat (UK) or skirt (US) was often placed on the floor below the tree to collect [[wax]] drippings and also any needles that fell. Even when dripless candles, electric lights and artificial trees have been used, a skirt is still usually used as a decorative feature: among other things, it hides the [[Christmas tree stand]], which may be unsightly yet an important safety feature of home trees.<ref>{{cite web|title=Safety in the holidays|url=http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/Christmastrees/farm-safety/|accessdate=25 November 2013}}</ref> What began as ordinary cloth has now often become much more ornate, some having [[embroidery]] or being put together like a [[quilt]].

A [[nativity scene]], model train, or [[Christmas village]] may be placed on the mat or skirt. As Christmas presents arrive, they are generally placed underneath the tree on the tree skirt (depending on tradition, all Christmas gifts, or those too large to be hung on the tree, as in "presents on the tree" of the song "[[I'll Be Home for Christmas]]").

Generally, the difference between a mat and skirt is simply that a mat is placed ''under'' the Christmas tree stand, while a skirt is placed ''over'' it, having a hole in the middle for the trunk, with a slot cut to the outside edge so that it can be placed around the tree (beneath the branches) easily. A plain mat of fabric or plastic may also be placed under the stand and skirt to protect the floor from scratches or water.

A Christmas tree stand is an object designed to support a cut, natural Christmas tree or an artificial Christmas tree. Christmas tree stands appeared as early as 1876 and have had various designs over the years. Those stands designed for natural trees have a water reservoir to hydrate the live tree. Artificial Christmas trees usually have a plastic or metal stand, with three legs shaping like a Y.

In the 1940s and 1950s [[flocking (texture)|flocking]] was very popular on the [[West Coast of the United States]]. There were home flocking kits that could be used with vacuum cleaners. In the 1980s some trees were sprayed with fluffy white flocking to simulate snow. Typically it would be sprayed all over the tree from the sides, which produced a look different from real snow, which settles in clumps atop branches. Flocking can be done with a professional sprayer at a tree lot (or an artificial tree's manufacturer), or at home from a spray can. This tradition seems to be most popular on the west coast and southern parts of the United States. Because flock contains flame retardants, a flocked tree can be placed in a public building in accordance with local [[fire safety]] codes.

In the late 1800s and, most probably, long before, home-made white Christmas trees were made by wrapping strips of cotton batting around leafless branches creating the appearance of a snow-laden tree. This family tradition eliminated killing and care of a live tree and needle drop in the house while providing a beautiful way of displaying ornaments. After Christmas, the cotton batting was unwrapped and stored with the Christmas presents and the branches were burnt or discarded. It is thought these home-made white trees at least, in part, inspired flocking popularized by Hollywood films in the late 1930s.

[[File:Christmas tree for sale.jpg|thumb|Undecorated Christmas trees for sale]]
Each year, 33 to 36 million Christmas trees are produced in America, and 50 to 60 million are produced in Europe. In 1998, there were about 15,000 growers in America (a third of them "choose and cut" farms). In that same year, it was estimated that Americans spent $1.5 billion on Christmas trees.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apsnet.org/education/feature/1225tree/top.htm |title=The Christmas Tree |accessdate=December 8, 2006 |author=Gary A.

===Natural trees===
{{See also|Christmas tree cultivation}}
The most commonly used species are [[fir]] (''Abies''), which have the benefit of not shedding their needles when they dry out, as well as retaining good foliage colour and scent; but species in other [[genus|genera]] are also used.

In northern [[Europe]] most commonly used are:

* [[Picea abies|Norway spruce]] ''Picea abies'' (the original tree, generally the cheapest)
* [[Abies alba|Silver fir]] ''Abies alba''
* [[Abies nordmanniana|Nordmann fir]] ''Abies nordmanniana''
* [[Noble fir]] ''Abies procera''
* [[Picea omorika|Serbian spruce]] ''Picea omorika''
* [[Scots pine]] ''Pinus sylvestris''
* [[Stone pine]] ''Pinus pinea'' (as small table-top trees)
* [[Swiss pine]] ''Pinus cembra''

In [[North America]], [[Central America]] and [[South America]] most commonly used are:

* [[Douglas-fir]] ''Pseudotsuga menziesii''
* [[Abies balsamea|Balsam fir]] ''Abies balsamea''
* [[Fraser Fir]] ''Abies fraseri''
* [[Abies grandis|Grand fir]] ''Abies grandis''
* [[Abies guatemalensis|Guatemalan fir]] ''Abies guatemalensis''
* [[Noble fir]] ''Abies procera''
* [[Abies magnifica|Red fir]] ''Abies magnifica''
* [[Abies concolor|White fir]] ''Abies concolor''
* [[Colorado Pinyon|Pinyon pine]] ''Pinus edulis''
* [[Jeffrey pine]] ''Pinus jeffreyi''
* [[Scots pine]] ''Pinus sylvestris''
* [[Stone pine]] ''Pinus pinea'' (as small table-top trees)
* [[Araucaria heterophylla|Norfolk Island pine]] ''Araucaria heterophylla''

Several other species are used to a lesser extent. Less-traditional conifers are sometimes used, such as [[Sequoiadendron giganteum|giant sequoia]], [[Leyland cypress]], [[Cupressus macrocarpa|Monterey cypress]] and [[Juniperus virginiana|eastern juniper]]. Various types of [[spruce]] tree are also used for Christmas trees (including the [[Picea pungens|blue spruce]] and, less commonly, the [[Picea glauca|white spruce]]); but spruces (unlike firs) begin to lose their needles rapidly upon being cut, and spruce needles are often sharp, making decorating uncomfortable. [[Pinus virginiana|Virginia pine]] is still available on some tree farms in the southeastern United States, however its winter colour is faded. The long-needled [[Pinus strobus|eastern white pine]] is also used there, though it is an unpopular Christmas tree in most parts of the country, owing also to its faded winter coloration and limp branches, making decorating difficult with all but the lightest ornaments. Norfolk Island pine is sometimes used, particularly in [[Oceania]], and in [[Australia]], some species of the genera ''[[Casuarina]]'' and ''[[Allocasuarina]]'' are also occasionally used as Christmas trees. But, by far, the most common tree is the [[Pinus radiata|Monterey pine]]. ''[[Adenanthos sericeus]]'' or Albany woolly bush is commonly sold in southern Australia as a potted living Christmas tree. [[Tsuga|Hemlock]] species are generally considered unsuitable as Christmas trees due to their poor needle retention and inability to support the weight of lights and ornaments.

Some trees, frequently referred to as "living Christmas trees", are sold live with roots and soil, often from a [[plant nursery]], to be stored at nurseries in planters or planted later outdoors and enjoyed (and often decorated) for years or decades. Others are produced in a container and sometimes as [[topiary]] for a porch or patio. However, when done improperly, the combination of root loss caused by digging, and the indoor environment of high temperature and low humidity is very detrimental to the tree's health; additionally, the warmth of an indoor climate will bring the tree out of its natural winter [[dormancy]], leaving it little protection when put back outside into a cold outdoor climate. Often Christmas trees are a large attraction for living animals, including mice and spiders. Thus, the survival rate of these trees is low.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/plants/other/seasonal/hgic1751.html |title= Living Christmas Trees |publisher=[[Clemson University]] |accessdate=July 12, 2010 }}</ref> However, when done properly, replanting provides higher survival rates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.for.msu.edu/extension/ExtDocs/xmastree.htm |title=Christmas tree |publisher=Department of Forestry, [[Michigan State University]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120315150004/http://www.for.msu.edu/extension/ExtDocs/xmastree.htm |archivedate=15 March 2012 }}</ref>

European tradition prefers the open aspect of naturally grown, unsheared trees, while in North America (outside western areas where trees are often wild-harvested on public lands)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blm.gov/co/st/en/BLM_Information/newsroom/2004/blm_and_forest_service0.html |title=BLM and Forest Service Christmas tree permits available |publisher=[[Bureau of Land Management]] |date=November 30, 2004 |accessdate=December 18, 2012 }}</ref> there is a preference for close-sheared trees with denser foliage, but less space to hang decorations.

In the past, Christmas trees were often harvested from wild forests, but now almost all are commercially grown on [[tree farm]]s. Almost all Christmas trees in the United States are grown on Christmas tree farms where they are cut after about ten years of growth and new trees planted. According to the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]'s agriculture census for 2007, 21,537 farms were producing conifers for the cut Christmas tree market in America, {{convert|5717.09|km2|acre|0}} were planted in Christmas trees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/2007/Online_Highlights/Specialty_Crops/speccrop.pdf |title=2007 Census of Agriculture: Specialty Crops (Volume 2, Subject Series, Part 8) |at=Table 1, page 1 |date=November 2009 |format=PDF |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]}}</ref>

The life cycle of a Christmas tree from the seed to a {{convert|2|m|ft|0|sing=on}} tree takes, depending on species and treatment in cultivation, between 8 and 12 years. First, the seed is extracted from cones harvested from older trees. These seeds are then usually grown in nurseries and then sold to Christmas tree farms at an age of 3–4 years. The remaining development of the tree greatly depends on the climate, soil quality, as well as the cultivation and how the trees are tended by the Christmas tree farmer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weihnachtsbaumversand.de/Wissenswertes:_:35.html |title=Unsere kleine Baumschule — Wissenswertes |trans_title=Our little nursery: Trivia |language=de |year=2010 |accessdate=December 18, 2012}}</ref>

The debate about the environmental impact of artificial trees is ongoing. Generally, natural tree growers contend that artificial trees are more environmentally harmful than their natural counterparts.<ref name="hayes"/> However, trade groups such as the [[American Christmas Tree Association]], continue to refute that artificial trees are more harmful to the environment, and maintain that the PVC used in Christmas trees has excellent recyclable properties.<ref name="acta">{{cite web |url=http://www.christmastreeassociation.org/Article%20Pages/facts-on-pvc-used-in-artificial-christmas-trees |title=Facts on PVC Used in Artificial Christmas Trees |publisher=[[American Christmas Tree Association]] |accessdate=December 21, 2008 }}</ref>

Most artificial trees are made of recycled PVC rigid sheets using tin stabilizer in the recent years. In the past, [[lead]] was often used as a stabilizer in PVC, but is now banned by Chinese laws.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}
The use of lead stabilizer in Chinese imported trees has been an issue of concern among politicians and scientists over recent years.

Under the [[Marxist-Leninist atheism|Marxist-Leninist]] doctrine of [[state atheism]] in the Soviet Union, after its foundation in 1917, Christmas celebrations—along with other religious holidays—were prohibited as a result of the Soviet [[Anti-religious campaign during the Russian Civil War|antireligious campaign]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://asia.rbth.com/articles/2010/12/15/and_so_is_this_christmas05210.html|title=And so, is this Christmas?|date=15 Dec 2010|author=Jennifer Eremeeva|work=[[Russia Beyond the Headlines]]|quote=Russian Christians adhere to the Eastern Orthodox calendar, which lags 13 days behind the modern day calendar. This discrepancy was corrected in 1918, by the fledgling Bolshevik regime, but Christmas never reverted to December 25th in Russia, because the Bolsheviks began a systematic campaign to phase out traditional religious holidays and replace them with Soviet ones. Christmas was shifted to New Year’s Eve. At the beginning, stringent measures were put in place to see off any holdover of the old days: Christmas trees, introduced to Russia by Tsar Peter The Great in the 17th Century, were banned in 1916 by the Holy Synod as too German. The Bolsheviks kept the tree ban in place.
