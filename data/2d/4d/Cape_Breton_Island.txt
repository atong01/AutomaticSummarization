'''Cape Breton Island''' ({{lang-fr|île du Cap-Breton}}—formerly ''[[Île-Royale (New France)|Île Royale]]'', [[Scottish Gaelic]]: ''Ceap Breatainn'' or ''Eilean Cheap Bhreatainn'', [[Míkmaq language|Míkmaq]]: ''Únamakika'', simply: ''Cape Breton'') is an [[island]] on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast of [[North America]].  The name probably derives from Cap Breton near Bayonne, or to the name ''Breton'', the [[Anglicisation|Anglicized]] version of the French historical region, ''[[Brittany|Bretagne]]''.<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Cape Breton}}</ref>

Cape Breton Island is part of the province of [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]].<ref name=EB1911/> The {{convert|10311|km2|abbr=on}} island accounts for 18.7% of the total area of Nova Scotia.  Although physically separated from the [[Nova Scotia peninsula]] by the [[Strait of Canso]], it is artificially connected to mainland Nova Scotia by the  {{convert|1385|m|ft|abbr=on}} long rock-fill [[Canso Causeway]].  The island is located east-northeast of the mainland with its northern and western [[coast]]s fronting on the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]]; its western coast also forming the eastern limits of the [[Northumberland Strait]]. The eastern and southern coasts front the Atlantic Ocean; its eastern coast also forming the western limits of the [[Cabot Strait]]. Its landmass slopes upward from south to north, culminating in the [[highland]]s of its northern cape. One of the world's larger salt water lakes, [[Bras d'Or Lake|Bras d'Or]] ("Arm of Gold" in French), dominates the centre of the island.

The island is divided into four of Nova Scotia's eighteen counties: [[Cape Breton County, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton]], [[Inverness County, Nova Scotia|Inverness]], [[Richmond County, Nova Scotia|Richmond]], and [[Victoria County, Nova Scotia|Victoria]]. Their total population at the [[Canada 2011 Census|2011 census]] numbered 135,974 "Cape Bretoners"; this is approximately 15% of the provincial population.<ref name="Table from Statistics Canada"/>  Cape Breton Island has experienced a decline in population of approximately 4.4% since the previous census in 2006.  Approximately 75% of the island's population is located in the [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality]] (CBRM) which includes all of [[Cape Breton County, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton County]] and is often referred to as [[Industrial Cape Breton]], given the history of [[coal]] mining and steel manufacturing in this area, which was Nova Scotia's industrial heartland throughout the 20th century.

The island contains five [[Indian reserve|reserves]] of the [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq Nation]], these being: [[Eskasoni First Nation|Eskasoni]], [[Membertou First Nation|Membertou]], [[Wagmatcook First Nation|Wagmatcook]], [[Whycocomagh 2|Waycobah]], and [[Potlotek First Nation|Potlotek/Chapel Island]]. Eskasoni is the largest in both population and land area.

==History==

Cape Breton Island's first residents were most likely [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic maritime natives]], ancestors of the [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], the people who were inhabiting the island at the time of European arrival.  [[John Cabot]] reportedly visited the island in 1497.<ref name=EB1911/> However, historians are unclear as to whether Cabot first visited [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] or Cape Breton Island. This discovery is commemorated by Cape Breton's [[Cabot Trail]], and by the ''Cabot's Landing Historic Site & Provincial Park'', located near the village of [[Dingwall, Nova Scotia|Dingwall]].

In about 1521–22, the Portuguese under [[João Álvares Fagundes]] established a fishing colony on the island. As many as two hundred settlers lived in a village, the name of which is not known, located according to some historians at what is now present day [[Ingonish, Nova Scotia|Ingonish]] on the island's northeastern peninsula.  The fate of this Portuguese colony is unknown, but it is mentioned as late as 1570.<ref>de Souza, Francisco; ''Tratado das Ilhas Novas'', 1570</ref>

During the [[Anglo-French War (1627–1629)|Anglo-French War]] of 1627 to 1629, under [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], by 1629 the [[David Kirke|Kirkes]] took [[Quebec City]]; Sir James Stewart<ref name=EB1911/> of Killeith, [[Lord Ochiltree]] planted a colony on Cape Breton Island at [[Baleine, Nova Scotia]]; and Alexander’s son, [[William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling]], established the first incarnation of [[Nova Scotia|"New Scotland"]] at [[Port Royal, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia|Port Royal]]. This set of Scottish triumphs which left [[Cape Sable Island|Cape Sable]] as the only major French holding in North America was not destined to last.<ref>Roger Sarty and Doug Knight. Saint John Fortifications: 1630-1956. New Brunswick Military Heritage Series. 2003. p. 18.</ref>  Charles I’s haste to make peace with France on the terms most beneficial to him meant that the new North American gains would be bargained away in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1632)]].<ref>Nichols, 2010. p. xix</ref>{{Full|date=August 2014}}

The French quickly defeated the Scottish at [[Baleine, Nova Scotia|Baleine]], and established the first permanent settlements on Île Royale: present day [[Englishtown, Nova Scotia|Englishtown]] (1629) and [[St. Peter's, Nova Scotia|St. Peter's]] (1630). These settlements lasted almost continuously until [[Nicolas Denys]] left in 1659.  Île Royale then remained vacant for more than fifty years, until the communities along with [[Louisbourg (community)|Louisbourg]] were established in 1713.

===Île Royale===
[[File:Naval Ensign of the Kingdom of France.svg|thumb|left|100px|French Naval Ensign (pure white) flown over the Colony of Île Royale.]]
Known as "'''Île Royale'''" to the French, the island also saw active settlement by [[France]].  After the French ceded their colonies on [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and the [[Acadia]]n mainland to the British by the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713, the French relocated the population of [[Placentia, Newfoundland and Labrador|Plaisance, Newfoundland]], to [[Île-Royale (New France)|Île Royale]] and the French [[garrison]] was established in the central eastern part at [[Fort Sainte Anne (Nova Scotia)|Sainte Anne]].  As the harbour at Sainte Anne experienced icing problems, it was decided to construct a much larger fortification at [[Fortress of Louisbourg|Louisbourg]] to improve defences at the entrance to the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] and to defend France's fishing fleet on the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland|Grand Banks]].<ref>[http://www.cmhg.gc.ca/cmh/en/page_103.asp ''Canadian Military Heritage'']; vol.1, Chapter 6: Soldiers of the Atlantic Seaboard, p103. Government of Canada, 2004-04-26</ref> The French also built the [[Louisbourg Lighthouse]] in 1734, the first lighthouse in Canada and one of the first in North America.  In addition to Cape Breton Island, the French colony of Île Royale also included [[Prince Edward Island|Île Saint-Jean]], today called [[Prince Edward Island]].

[[File:British burninng warship Prudent and capturing Bienfaisant. Siege of Louisbourg 1758. Maritime Museum of the Atlantic, M55.7.1.jpg|300px|thumb|right|[[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)]]]]

Louisbourg itself was one of the most important commercial and military centres in New France.  Louisbourg was captured by New Englanders<ref name=EB1911/> with British naval assistance in [[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)|1745]]<ref name="timeline" /> and by British forces in 1758. The French population of Île Royale was deported to France after each siege. While French settlers returned to their homes in Île Royale after the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] was signed in 1748,<ref name=timeline>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/acadian/timeline.html |title=The Acadians – Timeline |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2004 |website=The Acadians |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref> the fortress was demolished after the [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)|second siege]]. Île Royale remained formally part of [[New France]] until it was ceded to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] by the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763. It was then merged with the adjacent, British colony of Nova Scotia (present day peninsular Nova Scotia and [[New Brunswick]]). [[Acadians]] that had been [[Expulsion of the Acadians|expelled]] from [[Nova Scotia]] and Île Royale were permitted to settle in Cape Breton beginning in 1764,<ref name="timeline" /> and established communities in north-western Cape Breton, near [[Cheticamp]], and southern Cape Breton, on and near [[Isle Madame]].

Some of the first British-sanctioned settlers on the island following the [[Seven Years' War]] were [[Ireland|Irish]], although upon settlement they merged with local French communities to form a culture rich in music and tradition.  From 1763 to 1784, the island was administratively part of the colony of [[Nova Scotia]]<ref name=EB1911/> and was governed from [[Halifax (former city)|Halifax]].

The first permanently settled [[Scottish people|Scottish]] community on Cape Breton Island was [[Judique, Nova Scotia|Judique]], settled in 1775 by Michael Mor MacDonald. He spent his first winter using his upside-down boat for shelter, which is reflected in the architecture of the village's Community Centre. He composed a song about the area called "O's alainn an t-aite", or "Fair is the Place."

===Colony of Cape Breton===
[[File:British-Red-Ensign-1707.svg|thumb|100px|Flag of the Colony of Cape Breton 1784–1801.]]
[[File:Civil Ensign of the United Kingdom.svg|thumb|100px|Flag of the Colony of Cape Breton 1801–1820.]]
In 1784, Britain split the colony of Nova Scotia into three separate colonies:  New Brunswick, Cape Breton Island, and present-day peninsular Nova Scotia, in addition to the adjacent colonies of [[Prince Edward Island|St. John's Island]] (renamed Prince Edward Island in 1798) and [[History of Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]].  The colony of Cape Breton Island had its capital at [[Sydney, Nova Scotia|Sydney]] on its namesake harbour fronting on Spanish Bay and the [[Cabot Strait]]. Its first Lieutenant-Governor was [[Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres]] (1784–1787) and his successor was [[William Macarmick]] (1787).

A number of [[United Empire Loyalists]] emigrated to the Canadian colonies, including Cape Breton.  [[David Mathews]], the former [[Mayor of New York City]] during the [[American Revolution]], emigrated with his family to Cape Breton in 1783.  He succeeded Macarmick as head of the colony and served from 1795 to 1798.<ref>Dictionary of Canadian Biography, Volume IV http://biographi.ca/en/bio.php?id_nbr=2054 Retrieved October 12, 2013</ref>

From 1799 to 1807, the military commandant was [[John Despard]],<ref>http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=2837</ref> brother of [[Edward Despard|Edward]].<ref>Despard, John; ''The Companion to British History'', Routledge</ref>

An order forbidding the granting of land in Cape Breton, issued in 1763, was removed in 1784. The mineral rights to the island were given over to the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] by an order-in-council. The British government had intended that the Crown take over the operation of the mines when Cape Breton was made a colony, but this was never done, probably because of the rehabilitation cost of the mines. The mines were in a neglected state, caused by careless operations dating back at least to the time of the final fall of Louisbourg.

Large-scale shipbuilding began in the 1790s, beginning with [[schooner]]s for local trade moving in the 1820s to larger [[brig]]s and [[brigantine]]s, mostly built for British shipowners. Shipbuilding peaked in the 1850s, marked in 1851 by the [[full rigged ship]] ''[[Lord Clarendon (ship)|Lord Clarendon]]'', the largest wooden ship ever built in Cape Breton.

===Merger with Nova Scotia===

In 1820, the colony of Cape Breton Island was merged for the second time with Nova Scotia.  This development is one of the factors which led to large-scale industrial development in the Sydney Coal Field of eastern Cape Breton County. By the late 19th century, as a result of the faster shipping, expanding fishery and industrialization of the island, exchanges of people between the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and Cape Breton increased, beginning a cultural exchange that continues to this day.

During the first half of the 19th century, Cape Breton Island experienced an influx of [[Highland Scots]] numbering approximately 50,000 as a result of the [[Highland Clearances]].  Today, the descendants of the Highland Scots dominate Cape Breton Island's culture, particularly in rural communities.  To this day, [[Canadian Gaelic|Gaelic]] is still the first language of a number of elderly Cape Bretoners.{{cn|date=September 2015}} The growing influence of English-dominated media from outside the Scottish communities saw the use of this language erode quickly during the 20th century. Many of the Scots who immigrated there were either Roman Catholics or Presbyterians, which can be seen in a number of island landmarks and place names.

The 1920s were some of the most violent times in Cape Breton. They were marked by several severe labour disputes.  The famous murder of [[William Davis (miner)|William Davis]] by strike breakers, and the seizing of the [[New Waterford, Nova Scotia|New Waterford]] power plant by striking miners led to a major union sentiment that persists to this day in some circles. [[William Davis Miners' Memorial Day]] is celebrated in coal mining towns to commemorate the deaths of miners at the hands of the coal companies.

===20th century===

The turn of the 20th century saw Cape Breton Island at the forefront of scientific achievement with the now-famous activities launched by inventors [[Alexander Graham Bell]] and [[Guglielmo Marconi]].

Following his successful invention of the [[telephone]] and being relatively wealthy, Bell acquired land near [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia|Baddeck]] in 1885, largely due to surroundings reminiscent of his early years in [[Scotland]]. He established a summer estate complete with research laboratories, working with deaf people—including [[Helen Keller]]—and continued to invent. Baddeck would be the site of his experiments with [[hydrofoil]] technologies as well as the [[Aerial Experiment Association]], financed by his wife, which saw the first powered flight in the [[British Empire]] when the [[AEA Silver Dart|AEA ''Silver Dart'']] took off from the ice-covered waters of [[Bras d'Or Lake]]. Bell also built the forerunner to the [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]] and experimented with breeding sheep.

Marconi's contributions to Cape Breton Island were also quite significant, as he used the island's geography to his advantage in transmitting the first North American trans-[[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] [[radio]] message from a station constructed at Table Head in [[Glace Bay, Nova Scotia|Glace Bay]] to a receiving station at [[Poldhu]] in [[Cornwall]], [[England]]. Marconi's pioneering work in Cape Breton marked the beginning of modern radio technology. Marconi's station at Marconi Towers, on the outskirts of Glace Bay, became the chief communication centre for the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] in World War I through to the early years of World War II.

Promotions for tourism beginning in the 1950s recognized the importance of the Scottish culture to the province, and the provincial government started encouraging the use of Gaelic once again. The establishment of funding for the [[Gaelic College of Celtic Arts and Crafts]] and formal Gaelic [[language courses]] in public schools are intended to address the near-loss of this culture to English [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]].
 
In the 1960s, the [[Fortress of Louisbourg]] was partially reconstructed by [[Parks Canada]]. Since 2009, this [[National Historic Site of Canada]] has attracted an average of 90&nbsp;000 visitors per year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.krausehouse.ca/krause/FortressOfLouisbourgVisitationNumbers.htm |title=Fortress of Louisbourg Visitation Numbers |last1=Krause |first1=Eric R.|date=July 30, 2014|publisher=Krause House Info-Research Solutions |accessdate=August 8, 2014}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Sydney, Nova Scotia.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Sydney waterfront, focal point of the largest population centre on Cape Breton Island.]]
The island measures {{convert|10311|km2|0}} in area, making it the [[List of islands by area|77th largest island in the world]] and [[List of Canadian islands by area|Canada's 18th largest island]]. Cape Breton Island is composed mainly of [[rock (geology)|rocky]] [[shore]]s, rolling [[farm]]land, [[glacier|glacial]] [[valley]]s, barren [[headlands and bays|headlands]], [[mountain]]s, [[Woodland|woods]] and [[plateau]]s.  Geological evidence suggests that at least part of the island was originally joined with present-day [[Scotland]] and [[Norway]], now separated by millions of years of [[continental drift]].

The northern portion of Cape Breton Island is dominated by the [[Cape Breton Highlands]], commonly shortened to simply the "Highlands", which are an extension of the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian mountain chain]].  The Highlands comprise the northern portions of [[Inverness County, Nova Scotia|Inverness]] and [[Victoria County, Nova Scotia|Victoria counties]].  In 1936 the federal government established the [[Cape Breton Highlands National Park]] covering {{convert|949|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} across the northern third of the Highlands. The [[Cabot Trail]] scenic highway also encircles the coastal perimeter of the plateau.

Cape Breton Island's hydrological features include the [[Bras d'Or Lake]] system, a salt-water [[fjord]] at the heart of the island, and [[freshwater]] features including [[Lake Ainslie]], the [[Margaree River]] system, and the [[Mira River (Nova Scotia)|Mira River]]. Innumerable smaller [[river]]s and [[stream]]s drain into the Bras d'Or Lake [[estuary]] and onto the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Atlantic coasts.

Cape Breton Island is joined to the mainland by the [[Canso Causeway]], which was completed in 1955, enabling direct [[road]] and [[rail transport|rail]] [[traffic]] to and from the island, but requiring [[marine traffic]] to pass through the [[Canso Canal]] at the eastern end of the [[causeway]].

Cape Breton Island is divided into four counties: [[Cape Breton County, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton]], [[Inverness County, Nova Scotia|Inverness]], [[Richmond County, Nova Scotia|Richmond]], and [[Victoria County, Nova Scotia|Victoria]].

==Demographics==
[[File:Glace Bay Shul, August 2012.jpg|thumb|200px|The former Congregation Sons of Israel synagogue, in Glace Bay. In 1902, the synagogue was the first purpose built synagogue in Nova Scotia. It permanently closed in July 2010. To the left is the also closed Talmud Torah community centre. This was the location of the Hebrew school and functions like Bar Mitzvah and wedding dinners.]]

The island's residents can be grouped into five main cultures; [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], [[Acadian]],  [[Ireland|Irish]], and [[England|English]], with respective languages  [[Canadian Gaelic|Gaelic]] (Scottish and Irish), [[Míkmaq language|Mi'kmaq]], [[French language|French]], and [[English language|English]].  English is now the primary spoken language, though Mi'kmaq, Gaelic and French are still heard.

Later [[Human migration|migration]]s of [[Black Loyalist]]s, [[Italians]], and [[Eastern Europe]]ans mostly settled in the eastern part of the island around the Industrial Cape Breton region. The population of Cape Breton Island has been in decline for almost two decades with an increasing population exodus in recent years due to economic conditions.

According to the Census of Canada, the population of Cape Breton Island in 2011 was 135,974,<ref name="Table from Statistics Canada"/> a 4.4% decline from 142,298 in 2006, and a 14.1% decline from 158,260 in 1996.

Much of the recent economic history of Cape Breton Island can be tied to the coal industry.

The island has two major coal deposits:

* the Sydney Coal Field in the southeastern part of the island along the Atlantic Ocean drove the Industrial Cape Breton economy throughout the 19th and 20th centuries—until after [[World War II]], its industries were the largest private employers in Canada.
* the Inverness Coal Field in the western part of the island along the Gulf of St. Lawrence is significantly smaller but hosted several mines.

[[Sydney, Nova Scotia|Sydney]] has traditionally been the main port, with various facilities in a large, sheltered, natural harbour. It is the island's largest commercial centre and home to the ''[[Cape Breton Post]]'' daily newspaper, as well as one television station, [[CJCB-TV]] (CTV),{{refn|group="Note"|[[CBIT-TV]] (CBC) existed from 1972 until July 31, 2012, when the CBC closed down its over-the-air analog transmitters in small markets.

[[Glace Bay, Nova Scotia|Glace Bay]] is the second largest urban community in population and was the island's main coal mining centre until its last mine ceased operation in the 1980s. Glace Bay served as the hub of the Sydney & Louisburg Railway and also as a major fishing port. At one time, Glace Bay was known as the largest town in Nova Scotia, based on population.

[[Port Hawkesbury]] has risen to prominence since the completion of the Canso Causeway and [[Canso Canal]] created an artificial deep-water port, allowing extensive petrochemical, pulp and paper, and gypsum handling facilities to be established.  The Strait of Canso is completely navigable to [[Seawaymax]] vessels, and Port Hawkesbury is open to the deepest-draught vessels on the world's oceans.  Large marine vessels may also enter Bras d'Or Lake through the Great Bras d'Or channel, whereas small craft have the additional use of the Little Bras d'Or channel or [[St. Peters Canal]]. The St. Peters Canal is no longer used by commercial shipping on Cape Breton Island, but is an important waterway for recreational vessels.

The industrial Cape Breton area faced several challenges with the closure of the [[Cape Breton Development Corporation]]'s (DEVCO) [[coal mine]]s and the [[Sydney Steel Corporation]]'s (SYSCO) [[steel mill]].  In recent years, the Island's residents have been attempting to diversify the area economy by investing in tourism developments, [[call centre]]s, and small businesses, as well as manufacturing ventures in such fields as auto parts, pharmaceuticals, and window glazings.

While the [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality]] is in transition from an industrial to a service-based economy, the rest of Cape Breton Island outside the industrial area surrounding Sydney-Glace Bay has been more stable, with a mixture of fishing, forestry, small-scale agriculture, and tourism.

Tourism in particular has grown throughout the post-[[World War II|Second World War]] era, especially the growth in vehicle-based touring, which was furthered by the creation of the [[Cabot Trail]] scenic drive.  The scenery of the island is rivalled in northeastern North America by only [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]];{{Citation needed|reason=Subjective?|date=September 2013}} and Cape Breton Island tourism marketing places a heavy emphasis on its [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Gaels|Gaelic]] heritage through events such as the Celtic Colours Festival, held each October, as well as promotions through the [[Gaelic College of Celtic Arts and Crafts]].

Whale-watching is a popular attraction for tourists. Whale-watching cruises are operated by numerous vendors from Baddeck to Cheticamp. The most popular species of whale found in Cape Breton's waters is the [[Pilot whale]].

The primary east-west road on the island is [[Nova Scotia Highway 105|Highway 105]], the [[Trans-Canada Highway]], although [[Nova Scotia Trunk 4|Trunk 4]] is also heavily used.  [[Nova Scotia Highway 125|Highway 125]] is an important arterial route around Sydney Harbour in the [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality]]. The [[Cabot Trail]], circling the Cape Breton Highlands, and [[Nova Scotia Trunk 19|Trunk 19]], along the western coast of the island, are important secondary roads. Railway connections between the port of Sydney to [[Canadian National Railway]] in [[Truro, Nova Scotia|Truro]] are maintained by the [[Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway]].

The [[Cabot Trail]] is a scenic road circuit around and over the [[Cape Breton Highlands]] with spectacular coastal vistas; over 400,000 visitors drive the Cabot Trail each summer and fall.  Coupled with the [[Fortress of Louisbourg]], it has driven the growth of the tourism industry on the island in recent decades. The ''[[Condé Nast Publications|Condé Nast]]'' travel guide has rated Cape Breton Island as one of the best island destinations in the world.

==Traditional music==
{{main|Cape Breton fiddling}}

Cape Breton is well known for its traditional fiddle music, which was brought to North America by [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[immigrants]] during the [[Highland Clearances]].  The traditional style has been well preserved in Cape Breton, and [[céilidh]]s have become a popular attraction for summer tourists.  [[Inverness County, Nova Scotia|Inverness County]] in particular has a heavy concentration of musical activity, with regular performances in communities such as [[Mabou, Nova Scotia|Mabou]] and [[Judique, Nova Scotia|Judique]]. Judique is recognized as 'Baile nam Fonn', (literally: Village of Tunes) or the 'Home of Celtic Music', featuring the Celtic Music Interpretive Centre. Performers who have received significant recognition outside of Cape Breton include [[Bruce Guthro]], [[Buddy MacMaster]], [[Natalie MacMaster]], [[Ashley MacIsaac]], [[The Rankin Family]], [[Aselin Debison]], Lee Cremo, and the [[Barra MacNeils]].

[[The Men of the Deeps]] are a male choral group of current and former miners from the industrial Cape Breton area.

People from Cape Breton have also achieved a number of firsts in [[Canadian politics]] and governance. These include [[Mayann Francis]] of  [[Whitney Pier]], the first [[Black Nova Scotians|Black]] [[Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia]], and [[Elizabeth May]] of [[Margaree Harbour, Nova Scotia|Margaree Harbour]], the first member of the [[Green Party of Canada]] elected to the [[Canadian House of Commons]].
