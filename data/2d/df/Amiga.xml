Nine years later, vendors are still struggling to make systems that work like 1985 Amigas.

The analog output is connected to a low-pass filter, which filters out high-frequency aliases when the Amiga is using a lower sampling rate (see<space/><link><target>Nyquist limit</target></link>). The brightness of the Amiga's power LED is used to indicate the status of the Amiga's low-pass filter. The filter is active when the LED is at normal brightness, and deactivated when dimmed (or off on older A500 Amigas). On Amiga 1000 (and first Amiga 500 and Amiga 2000 model), the power LED had no relation to the filter's status, and a wire needed to be manually soldered between pins on the sound chip to disable the filter. Paula can read directly from the system's<space/><link><target>Random-access memory</target><part>RAM</part></link>, using direct memory access (DMA), making sound playback without CPU intervention possible.</paragraph><paragraph>Although the hardware is limited to four separate sound channels, software such as<space/><italics><link><target>OctaMED</target></link></italics><space/>uses software mixing to allow eight or more virtual channels, and it was possible for software to mix two hardware channels to achieve a single 14-bit resolution channel by playing with the volumes of the channels in such a way that one of the source channels contributes the most significant bits and the other the least.</paragraph><paragraph>The quality of the Amiga's sound output, and the fact that the hardware is ubiquitous and easily addressed by software, were standout features of Amiga hardware unavailable on PC platforms for years.

Caps Lock and Control share space to the left of A. Missing are the Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down keys: These are accomplished on Amigas by pressing shift and the appropriate arrow key. The Amiga keyboard adds a Help key, which a function key usually acts as on PCs (usually F1). In addition to the Control and Alt modifier keys, the Amiga has 2 'Amiga' keys, rendered as 'Open Amiga' and 'Closed Amiga' similar to the Open/Closed Apple logo keys on Apple II keyboards. The left is used to manipulate the operating system (moving screens and the like) and the right delivered commands to the application. The absence of Num lock frees space for more math symbols around the number pad. Contemporary Macintosh computers, for comparison, lack function keys completely.</paragraph><paragraph>The mouse has two buttons like Windows, but unlike Windows pressing and holding the right button replaces the system<space/><link><target>status line</target></link><space/>at the top of the screen with a Maclike<space/><link><target>menu bar</target></link>.
