[...]Human Rights: In the early 2000s, Bulgaria '''generally has been rated highly on the issue of human rights'''. However, some exceptions exist. Although the media have a record of unbiased reporting, Bulgaria’s lack of specific legislation protecting the media from state interference is a theoretical weakness.

Meanwhile,<space/><link><target>Zhelyu Zhelev</target></link>, a communist-era dissident from the new democratic party -<space/><link><target>Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)</target><part>Union of Democratic Forces</part></link><space/>(abbreviated in Bulgarian as SDS), was elected President by the Assembly in 1990. In the first years after the change of regime, Bulgarian politics had to (re)establish the foundations of a democratic society in the country after nearly fifty years of de facto totalitarian communism. The so-called period of transition (from a Soviet socialist model to an economic structure focused on development through economic growth) began in the early 1990s. The politics of Bulgaria was aimed at joining the European Union and the NATO fold, as the alliances were recognised to have political agendas similar to the goals of the new Bulgarian democracy.</paragraph><paragraph>In contemporary Bulgaria, the government and its leader - the Prime Minister, have more political influence and significance than the President. Thus, the parliamentary elections set the short-term social and political environment in the country since the cabinet (chosen by the Prime Minister and approved by the parliament) decides how the country is governed while the President can only make suggestions and impose vetoes.</paragraph><paragraph>In the first parliamentary elections held under the new<space/><link><target>constitution of Bulgaria</target></link>, in<space/><link><target>Bulgarian parliamentary election, 1991</target><part>October 1991</part></link>, the<space/><link><target>Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)</target><part>Union of Democratic Forces</part></link><space/>(SDS) party won a plurality of the seats, having won 110 out of the 240 seats, and created a cabinet alone with the support of the<space/><link><target>Movement for Rights and Freedoms</target></link><space/>a liberal party (in Bulgarian abbreviated: DPS) which is widely perceived as a party of the ethnic Turks minority in Bulgaria. Yet, their government collapsed in late 1992, and was succeeded by a technocratic team put forward by the<space/><link><target>Bulgarian Socialist Party</target></link><space/>(BSP), which served until 1994 when it also collapsed. The President dissolved the government and appointed a provisional one to serve until early parliamentary elections could be held in December.</paragraph><paragraph>BSP won convincingly these elections in<space/><link><target>Bulgarian parliamentary election, 1994</target><part>December 1994</part></link><space/>with a majority of 125 seats out of the 240. Due to the severe economic crisis in Bulgaria during their government, BSP's cabinet collapsed and in 1997 a caretaker cabinet was appointed by the President, again, to serve until early parliamentary elections could be held in April 1997.</paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>Bulgarian parliamentary election, 1997</target><part>April 1997</part></link><space/>elections resulted in a landslide victory for the SDS, winning a majority of 137 seats in parliament, and allowing them to form the<space/><link><target>Kostov Government</target><part>next government</part></link>.

In opposition were the two previously governing parties - the Socialist Party and the Union of Democratic Forces. In the four years in opposition the SDS suffered the defection of numerous splinter groups. The ruling party NDSV itself<space/><link><target>Sakskoburggotski Government#Changes on February 23, 2005</target><part>ruptured</part></link><space/>into a pro-right core and a pro-liberal<space/><link><target>New Time (Bulgarian political party)</target><part>fringe</part></link><space/>group.

This was the first time since 1989 that a ruling party was re-elected; in the past painful and unpopular reforms had to be implemented. However, as GERB received only 97 of the 240 seats, and failed to make a coalition, they refused the mandate, handing it down to the next party BSP.
