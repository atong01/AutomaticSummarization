A '''constitutional monarchy''', '''limited monarchy''' or '''parliamentary monarchy''' (also called a '''[[crowned republic]]''') {{sfn|Boyce|2008|p=1}}{{sfn|McCannon|2006|pp=177–178}}<ref group="lower-alpha" name="alternatives"/> is a form of government in which [[Government|governing]] powers of the [[monarch]] are restricted by a [[constitution]].<ref>Jerome Blum et al., ''The European World'' (1970) 1:267–68</ref>

A constitutional monarchy may refer to a system in which the monarch acts as a non-party political [[head of state]] under the [[constitution]], whether written or [[Uncodified constitution|unwritten]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.cqpress.com/teps/encyps_315.1|title=Constitutional Monarchy|work=The Encyclopedia of Political Science|publisher= CQ Press |year=2011}}</ref> While most monarchs may hold formal [[reserve power]]s and the government may officially take place in the monarch's name, they do not set [[public policy]] or choose political leaders. Political scientist [[Vernon Bogdanor]], paraphrasing [[Thomas Macaulay]], has defined a constitutional monarch as "a sovereign who reigns but does not rule".<ref name="bogdanor-1996">{{cite journal |url=http://pa.oxfordjournals.org/content/49/3/407 |title=The Monarchy and the Constitution |author=[[Vernon Bogdanor]] |journal=[[Parliamentary Affairs]] |year=1996 |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=407–422 |doi=10.1093/pa/49.3.407}}, excerpted from {{cite book |title=The Monarchy and the Constitution |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |author=[[Vernon Bogdanor]] |year=1995}}</ref> In addition to acting as a visible symbol of national unity, a constitutional monarch may hold formal powers such as [[dissolution of parliament|dissolving parliament]] or giving [[Royal Assent]] to legislation. However, the exercise of such powers is generally a formality rather than an opportunity for the sovereign to enact personal political preference. In ''[[The English Constitution]]'', British political theorist [[Walter Bagehot]] identified three main political rights which a constitutional monarch could freely exercise: the right to be consulted, the right to advise, and the right to warn. Some constitutional monarchs, however, retain significant power and influence and play an important political role.

The [[United Kingdom]] and [[Commonwealth realm|fifteen of its former colonies]] are constitutional monarchies with a [[Westminster system]] of government. Three states&nbsp;– [[Malaysia]], [[Cambodia]] and the [[Holy See]]&nbsp;– employ true [[Elective monarchy|elective monarchies]], where the ruler is periodically selected by a small, [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] [[electoral college]].

The {{As of|June 2013|alt=most recent}} country to transition from an absolute to a constitutional monarchy was [[Bhutan]], in 2007–08.

== Constitutional and absolute monarchy ==
In England, the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 led to a constitutional monarchy restricted by laws such as the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] and the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], although limits on the power of the monarch ('a limited monarchy') are much older than that (see [[Magna Carta]]). At the same time, in Scotland, the [[Convention of Estates (1689)|Convention of Estates]] enacted the [[Claim of Right Act 1689]] which placed similar limits on the Scottish monarchy. With the Hanoverian accession in Britain onwards, monarchs saw their powers pass further to their ministers, and Royal neutrality in politics became cemented from around the start of the reign of [[Queen Victoria]] (though she had her personal favorites) and enlargements to the franchise. Today, the role is by convention effectively ceremonial.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/HowtheMonarchyworks/Whatisconstitutionalmonarchy.aspx| accessdate=11 March 2010| title=What is constitutional monarchy?| publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy}}</ref> Instead, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] and the [[Government of the United Kingdom|Government]] - chiefly in the office of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] - exercise their powers under [[Royal Prerogative|'Royal (or Crown) Prerogative']]: on behalf of the monarch and through powers still formally possessed by the Monarch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/monarchy/| accessdate=13 September 2011| title=Monarchy - Background| publisher=politics.co.UK}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/crown-prerogative/| accessdate=13 September 2011| title=Crown Prerogative | publisher=Official website of the UK Parliament}}</ref> No person may accept significant public office without swearing an [[Oath of Allegiance (United Kingdom)|oath of allegiance to the Queen]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/rp2001/rp01-116.pdf |title=RESEARCH PAPER 01/116|format=PDF|website=parliament.uk}}</ref>  With few exceptions, the monarch is bound by [[constitutional convention (custom)|convention]] to act on the [[advice (constitutional)|advice]] of the Government.

Constitutional monarchy occurred first in continental Europe, briefly in the early years of the [[French Revolution]], but much more widely afterwards. [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] is considered the first monarch proclaiming ''himself'' as an embodiment of the nation, rather than as a divinely-appointed ruler; this interpretation of monarchy is germane to continental constitutional monarchies. G.W.F. [[Hegel]], in his ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]'' (1820), gave it a philosophical justification that concurred with evolving contemporary political theory and the Protestant Christian view of natural law. Hegel's forecast of a constitutional monarch with very limited powers whose function is to embody the national character and provide constitutional continuity in times of emergency was reflected in the development of constitutional monarchies in Europe and Japan. His forecast of the form of government suitable to the modern world may be seen as prophetic: the largely ceremonial offices of president in some modern [[parliamentary republic]]s in Europe and Israel can be perceived as elected or appointed versions of Hegel's constitutional monarch; the Russian and French presidents, with their stronger powers, may also be regarded in Hegelian terms as wielding powers suitable to the embodiment of the national will.{{citation needed|date= February 2014}}

== Executive monarchy versus ceremonial monarchy ==
There exist at least two different types of constitutional monarchies in the modern world — executive and ceremonial. In executive monarchies, the monarch wields significant (though not absolute) power. The monarchy under this system of government is a powerful political (and social) institution. By contrast, in ceremonial monarchies, the monarch holds little actual power or direct political influence.
 
Executive monarchies: [[Bhutan]], [[Bahrain]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Monaco]], [[Morocco]], [[Tonga]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]].

Ceremonial monarchies: [[Andorra]], [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Australia]], [[The Bahamas]], [[Barbados]], [[Belgium]], [[Belize]], [[Cambodia]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[Grenada]], [[Jamaica]], [[Japan]], [[Lesotho]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Malaysia]],  the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], [[Solomon Islands]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Thailand]], [[Tuvalu]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

Ceremonial and executive monarchy, should not be confused with democratic and non-democratic monarchical systems. For example, in Liechtenstein and Monaco, the ruling monarchs wield significant executive power.  However, they are ''not'' absolute monarchs, and these countries are generally reckoned as democracies.

== Modern constitutional monarchy ==
As originally conceived, a constitutional monarch was head of the [[executive branch]] and quite a powerful figure, even though his or her power was limited by the constitution and the elected parliament. Some of the framers of the US Constitution may have envisaged the president as an elected constitutional monarch, as the term was then understood, following [[Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu's]] account of the separation of powers.<ref>[[Baron de Montesquieu]], ''The Spirit of Laws''. Legal Classics Library, 1924.</ref>

The present-day concept of a constitutional monarchy developed in the United Kingdom, where the democratically elected parliaments, and their leader, the [[prime minister]], exercise power, with the monarchs having ceded power and remaining as a titular position. In many cases the monarchs, while still at the very top of the political and social hierarchy, were given the status of "servants of the people" to reflect the new, egalitarian position. In the course of [[France]]'s [[July Monarchy]], [[Louis-Philippe I, King of the French|Louis-Philippe I]] was styled "King of the French" rather than "King of France".

Following the [[Unification of Germany]], [[Otto von Bismarck]] rejected the British model. In the constitutional monarchy established under the [[Constitution of the German Empire]] which Bismarck inspired, the [[Kaiser]] retained considerable actual executive power, while the [[Reichskanzler|Imperial Chancellor]] needed no parliamentary vote of confidence and ruled solely by the imperial mandate. However this model of constitutional monarchy was discredited and abolished following Germany's defeat in the [[First World War]]. Later, [[Kingdom of Italy|Fascist Italy]] could also be considered as a constitutional monarchy, in that there was a [[King of Italy|king]] as the titular head of state while actual power was held by [[Benito Mussolini]] under a constitution. This eventually discredited the Italian monarchy and led to its abolition in 1946. After the Second World War, surviving European monarchies almost invariably adopted some variant of the constitutional monarchy model originally developed in Britain.

Nowadays a [[parliamentary democracy]] that is a constitutional monarchy is considered to differ from one that is a [[republic]] only in detail rather than in substance. In both cases, the titular head of state—monarch or president—serves the traditional role of embodying and representing the nation, while the government is carried on by a cabinet composed predominantly of elected [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]].

However, three important factors distinguish monarchies such as the [[United Kingdom]] from systems where greater power might otherwise rest with [[Parliament]]. These are: the [[Royal Prerogative]] under which the monarch may exercise power under certain very limited circumstances; [[Sovereign Immunity]] under which the monarch may ''do no wrong'' under the law because the [[responsible government]] is instead deemed accountable; and the monarch may not be subject to the same taxation or property use restrictions as most citizens. Other privileges may be nominal or ceremonial (e.g., where the executive, judiciary, police or armed forces act on the authority of or owe [[allegiance]] to the Crown).

Today slightly more than a quarter of constitutional monarchies are [[Western European]] countries, including the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Norway]], [[Denmark]], [[Spain]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Monaco]], [[Liechtenstein]], and [[Sweden]]. However, the two most populous constitutional monarchies in the world are in Asia: Japan and Thailand. In these countries the [[prime minister]] holds the day-to-day powers of governance, while the King or Queen (or other monarch, such as a Grand Duke, in the case of Luxembourg, or Prince in the case of Monaco and Liechtenstein) retains residual (but not always insignificant) powers. The powers of the monarch differ between countries. In Denmark and in Belgium, for example, the Monarch formally appoints a representative to preside over the creation of a [[coalition government]] following a parliamentary election, while in [[Norway]] the King chairs special meetings of the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]].

In nearly all cases, the monarch is still the nominal chief executive, but is bound by convention to act on the advice of the Cabinet. Only a few monarchies (most notably [[Japan]] and [[Sweden]]) have amended their constitutions so that the monarch is no longer even the nominal chief executive.

There are sixteen constitutional monarchies under Queen [[Elizabeth II]], which are known as [[Commonwealth realm]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchAndCommonwealth/QueenandCommonwealth/WhatisaCommonwealthRealm.aspx|title=Website of the British Monarchy: What is a Commonwealth realm?|accessdate=19 September 2010}}</ref> Unlike some of their continental European counterparts, the Monarch and her Governors-General in the Commonwealth realms hold significant "reserve" or "prerogative" powers, to be wielded in times of extreme emergency or constitutional crises, usually to uphold parliamentary government. An instance of a Governor-General exercising such power occurred during the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]], when the Australian Prime Minister, [[Gough Whitlam]], was dismissed by the Governor-General. The Australian senate had threatened to block the Government's [[budget]] by refusing to pass the necessary appropriation bills. On 11 November 1975, Whitlam intended to call a half-Senate election in an attempt to break the deadlock. When he sought the Governor-General's approval of the election, the Governor-General instead dismissed him as Prime Minister, and shortly thereafter installed leader of the opposition [[Malcolm Fraser]] in his place. Acting quickly before all parliamentarians became aware of the change of government, Fraser and his allies secured passage of the appropriation bills, and the Governor-General dissolved Parliament for a [[double dissolution]] election. Fraser and his government were returned with a massive majority. This led to much speculation among Whitlam's supporters as to whether this use of the Governor-General's reserve powers was appropriate, and whether [[Republicanism in Australia|Australia should become a republic]]. Among supporters of constitutional monarchy, however, the experience confirmed the value of the monarchy as a source of checks and balances against elected politicians who might seek powers in excess of those conferred by the constitution, and ultimately as a safeguard against dictatorship.

In Thailand's constitutional monarchy, the monarch is recognized as the Head of State, Head of the Armed Forces, Upholder of the Buddhist Religion, and Defender of the Faith. The current King, [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]], is the longest reigning current monarch in the world and in all of Thailand's history.<ref name="longestthai">{{cite web |year=1996 |url=http://www.worldhop.com/Journals/J5/ROYAL.HTM |title=A Royal Occasion speeches |publisher=Worldhop.com Journal |accessdate=2006-07-05}}</ref> Bhumibol has reigned through several political changes in the Thai government. He has played an influential role in each incident, often acting as mediator between disputing political opponents. (See Bhumibol's role in [[Bhumibol Adulyadej#Role in Thai politics|Thai Politics]].) Among the powers retained by the monarch under the constitution, [[Lèse majesté in Thailand|lèse majesté]] protects the image of the monarch and enables him to play a role in politics. It carries strict criminal penalties for violators. Generally, the Thai people are reverent of Bhumibol. Much of his social influence arises from this reverence and from the socio-economic improvement efforts undertaken by the royal family.

In both the United Kingdom and elsewhere, a frequent debate centers on when it is appropriate for a monarch to use his or her political powers. When a monarch does act, political controversy can often ensue, partially because the neutrality of the crown is seen to be compromised in favour of a [[partisan (political)|partisan]] goal, while some [[political scientist]]s champion the idea of an "interventionist monarch" as a check against possible illegal action by politicians.  For instance, the monarch of the United Kingdom can theoretically exercise an absolute veto over legislation by withholding Royal Assent.  However, no monarch has done so since 1708, and it is widely believed that this and many of the monarch's other political powers are [[lapsed power]]s.

There are currently 44 monarchies, and most of them are constitutional monarchies.

== Former constitutional monarchies ==
* The [[Anglo-Corsican Kingdom]] was a brief period in the [[history of Corsica]] (1794–1796) when the island broke with [[Revolutionary France]] and sought military protection from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. Corsica became an independent kingdom under [[George III]] of the United Kingdom, but with its own elected parliament and a written constitution guaranteeing local autonomy and democratic rights.
* [[Brazil]] from 1815 (United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and Algarves) until 1822, with the proclamation of independence and rise of the [[Empire of Brazil]] by [[Pedro I of Brazil]]. The empire ended in 1889, when [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] was deposed by a military coup.
* [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] until 1946 when [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Tsar Simeon]] was deposed by the communist assembly.
* Many [[Commonwealth republic]]s were constitutional monarchies for some period after their independence.
* The [[Grand Principality of Finland]] was a constitutional monarchy though its ruler, [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], was simultaneously an [[Autocracy|autocrat]] and [[Absolute monarchy|absolute ruler]] in Russia.
* [[France]], several times during the 19th century. [[Napoleon I of France|Napoléon Bonaparte]] proclaimed himself Emperor of the French in what was ostensibly a constitutional monarchy, though modern historians often coin his reign as an absolute monarchy.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} The [[Bourbon Restoration]] (under [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] and [[Charles X of France|Charles X]]), the [[July Monarchy]] (under [[Louis-Philippe]]), and the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] (under [[Napoleon III]]) were also constitutional monarchies, although the power of the monarch varied considerably between them.
* The [[German Empire]] from 1871 to 1918, (as well as earlier confederations, and the monarchies it consisted of) was also a constitutional monarchy—see [[Constitution of the German Empire]].
* [[Greece]] until 1973 when [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II]] was deposed by the [[Greek military junta of 1967–74|military government]]. The decision was formalized by a [[Greek plebiscite, 1974|plebiscite]] December 8, 1974.
* [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Hawaii]], which was an absolute monarchy from its founding in 1810, transitioned to a constitutional monarchy in 1840 when [[Kamehameha III|King Kamehameha III]] promulgated the kingdom's [[1840 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii|first constitution]]. This constitutional form of government continued until the monarchy was overthrown in 1893 in [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii#Republic.2C American annexation.2C statehood|American conspiracy]].
* The [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. In 1848–1849 and 1867–1918 as part of [[Austria-Hungary]]. In the interwar period (1920–1944) [[Hungary]] remained a constitutional monarchy without a reigning monarch.
* [[Iceland]]. The Act of Union, a December 1, 1918 agreement with Denmark, established Iceland as a sovereign kingdom united with Denmark under a common king. Iceland abolished the monarchy and became a republic on June 17, 1944 after the Icelandic constitutional referendum, May 24, 1944.
* [[Iran]] under [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi]] was a constitutional monarchy, which had been originally established during the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution]] in 1906.
* [[Italy]] until June 2, 1946, when a referendum proclaimed the end of the Kingdom and the beginning of the Republic.
* [[Korean Empire]] proclaimed in October 1897 to the Annexation of Korea by Japan on August 20, 1910. It succeeded the Joseon Dynasty.
* The [[Kingdom of Laos]] was a constitutional monarchy until 1975, when [[Savang Vatthana|Sisavang Vatthana]] was forced to abdicate by the communist [[Pathet Lao]].
* [[Mexico]] was twice an Empire. The [[First Mexican Empire]] was from July 21, 1822, to March 19, 1823, with [[Agustín de Iturbide]] serving as emperor. Then, with the help of the Austrian and Spanish crowns, [[Napoleon III of France]] installed [[Maximilian of Habsburg]] as [[Second Mexican Empire|Emperor of Mexico]]. This attempt to create a European-style monarchy lasted three years, from 1864 to 1867.
* [[Montenegro]] until 1918 when it merged with [[Serbia]] and other areas to form [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].
* [[Kingdom of Mysore]]{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}
* [[Nepal]] until May 28, 2008, when [[Gyanendra of Nepal|King Gyanendra]] was deposed, and the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal was declared.
*[[Ottoman Empire]] from 1876 till 1878 and again from 1908 until the dissolution of the empire in 1922.
* The [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], formed after the [[Union of Lublin]] in 1569 and lasting until the final partition of the state in 1795, operated much like many modern European constitutional monarchies (into which it was officially changed by the establishment of the [[Constitution of May 3, 1791]], which historian [[Norman Davies]] calls "the first constitution of its kind in Europe").<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jrVW9W9eiYMC&pg=PA699 |first=Norman |last=Davies |title=Europe: A History |year=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=699 |isbn=0-19-820171-0}}</ref> The legislators of the unified state truly did not see it as a monarchy at all, but as ''a republic under the presidency of the King''. Poland–Lithuania also followed the principle of "Rex regnat et non gubernat", had a bicameral parliament, and a collection of entrenched legal documents amounting to a constitution along the lines of the modern [[United Kingdom]]. The King was elected, and had the duty of maintaining the people's rights.
* [[Portugal]] was a monarchy since 1139 and a constitutional monarchy from 1822 to 1828 and again from 1834 until 1910, when [[Manuel II of Portugal|Manuel II]] was overthrown by a military coup.
* [[Kingdom of Romania]] From its establishment in 1881 until 1947 when [[Michael I of Romania|Michael I]] was forced to abdicate at gunpoint by the communists.
* [[Kingdom of Serbia]] until 1918, when it merged with the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs into the unitary Yugoslav Kingdom, that was led by the Serbian [[Karadjordjevic]] dynasty.
* The West African [[Songhai Empire]] was considered a powerful constitutional monarchy before annexation by [[Morocco]] and later [[France]], when it became a colony and presently, a secular [[Sufist]] republic.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}
* [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] from 1918 (as [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]) until 1929 and from then (as [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]) until 1944 when under pressure from the Allies [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]] recognized the communist government.

== Unique constitutional monarchies ==
* [[Andorra]] is the only monarchy where the head of state is vested [[Coregency|jointly in two individuals]] ("Co-Princes"): the [[Bishop of Urgell]] and the [[President of France]].
* [[Andorra]], [[Monaco]] and [[Liechtenstein]] are the only countries with a reigning [[Prince]].
* [[Japan]] is the only country with an [[Emperor]].
* [[Luxembourg]] is the only country with a [[Grand Duke]].

{{Reflist
 | group = lower-alpha
 | refs = <ref name="alternatives">The terms ''[[crowned republic]]'' and ''parliamentary monarchy'' are used by some sources to distinguish one type of constitutional monarchy from another, but because the terms have no widely adopted meanings, different authorities define the terms in such a way that the definitions may overlap between publications. While the Australian [[Republic Advisory Committee]] used the term ''crowned republic'' to describe a constitutional monarchy where the monarch's role is ceremonial and all royal prerogatives are prescribed by custom and law in such a way that the monarch has little or no discretion over governmental and constitutional issues (and with it have framed the usage of the term in Australia) {{harv|Patmore|2009|p=105}}, ''parliamentary monarchy'' has been used to describe both a system where the monarch's powers are restricted (as in a crowned republic) {{harv|Schmitt|2008|pp=313&ndash;314}} and also where the powers of the monarch are less constrained by custom than is true of most modern European constitutional monarchies {{harv|Orr|2002|p=3}}. Note also that [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarchies]] may employ parliaments, as is the case in [[Oman]].
</ref>
<ref name="Belgium">Belgium is the only existing popular monarchy — a system in which the monarch's title is linked to the people rather than a state. The title of Belgian kings is not ''King of Belgium'', but instead ''King of the Belgians''. Another unique feature of the Belgian system is that the new monarch does not automatically assume the throne at the death or abdication of his predecessor; he only becomes monarch upon taking a constitutional oath.
