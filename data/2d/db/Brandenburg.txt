'''Brandenburg''' ({{Audio|De-Brandenburg.ogg|<small>listen</small>}}; {{lang-nds|Brannenborg}}, [[Lower Sorbian language|Lower Sorbian]]: ''Bramborska''; [[Upper Sorbian language|Upper Sorbian]]: ''Braniborska'') is one of the sixteen [[states of Germany|federated states]] of [[Germany]]. The capital is [[Potsdam]].

It lies in the east of the country and is one of the federal states that was re-created in 1990 upon the [[German reunification|reunification]] of the former [[West Germany]] and [[East Germany]]. Brandenburg surrounds but does not include the national capital and city-state [[Berlin]].

Originating in the medieval [[Northern March]], the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] [[Brandenburg-Prussia|grew]] to become the core of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], which would later become the [[Free State of Prussia]]. The [[East Brandenburg|eastern third]] of historic Brandenburg (''Ostbrandenburg/[[Neumark]]'') was ceded to [[Poland]] [[Oder-Neisse border|in 1945]].

==History==<!-- This section is linked from [[Theodor Fontane]] -->
{{History of Brandenburg and Prussia}}
{{Main|Margraviate of Brandenburg}}
In late medieval and early modern times, Brandenburg was one of seven [[prince-elector|electoral states]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and, along with Prussia, formed the original core of the [[German Empire]], the first unified German state. Governed by the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] dynasty from 1415, it contained the future German capital Berlin. After 1618 the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] and the [[Duchy of Prussia]] were combined to form [[Brandenburg-Prussia]], which was ruled by the same branch of the [[House of Hohenzollern]]. In 1701 the state was elevated as the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. Franconian [[Nuremberg]] and [[Ansbach]], Swabian [[Burg Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]], the eastern European connections of Berlin, and the status of Brandenburg's ruler as [[prince-elector]] together were instrumental in the rise of that state.

===Early Middle Ages===
{{Main|Northern March}}
Brandenburg is situated in territory known in antiquity as [[Magna Germania]], which reached to the Vistula river. By the 7th century, [[Slavic peoples]] are believed to have settled in the Brandenburg area. The Slavs expanded from the east, possibly driven from their homelands in present-day Ukraine and perhaps Belarus by the invasions of the [[Huns]] and [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]]. They relied heavily on river transport. The two principal Slavic groups in the present-day area of Brandenburg were the [[Hevelli]] in the west and the [[Sprevane]] in the east.

Beginning in the early 10th century, [[Henry the Fowler]] and his successors conquered territory up to the [[Oder River]]. Slavic settlements such as Brenna<ref>{{Cite book|last=Barford|first=Paul M.|title=The Early Slavs: Culture and Society in Early Medieval Eastern Europe|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca|year=2001|pages=421|isbn=0-8014-3977-9}}</ref> ([[Brandenburg an der Havel]]), Budusin<ref>{{Cite book|last=Institut für Sorbische Volksforschung in Bautzen|title=Lětopis Instituta za serbski ludospyt|publisher=Domowina|location=Bautzen|year=1962|isbn=}}</ref> ([[Bautzen]]), and Chośebuz<ref>{{Cite book|last=Room|first=Adrian|title=Placenames of the World|publisher=McFarland & Company|location=Jefferson|year=2006|pages=433|isbn=0-7864-2248-3}}</ref> ([[Cottbus]]) came under [[Holy Roman Empire|imperial]] control through the installation of margraves. Their main function was to defend and protect the eastern [[marches]]. In 948 Emperor [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] established margraves to exert imperial control over the pagan Slavs west of the Oder River. Otto founded the Bishoprics of [[Bishopric of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] and [[Bishopric of Havelberg|Havelberg]]. The [[Northern March]] was founded as a northeastern border territory of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. However, a great uprising of [[Wends]] drove imperial forces from the territory of present-day Brandenburg in 983. The region returned to the control of Slavic leaders.

===12th century===
[[File:Prignitz 07-13 img15 Demerthin.jpg|thumb|Demerthin Castle in Gumtow]]
During the 12th century, the [[Ottonian]] German kings and emperors re-established control over the mixed Slav-inhabited lands of present-day Brandenburg, although some Slavs like the [[Sorbs]] in [[Lusatia]] adapted to [[Germanization]] while retaining their distinctiveness. The Roman Catholic Church brought bishoprics which, with their walled towns, afforded protection from attacks for the townspeople. With the monks and bishops, the history of the town of [[Brandenburg (town)|Brandenburg an der Havel]], which was the first center of the state of Brandenburg, began. In 1134, in the wake of a German [[Northern Crusade|crusade]] against the [[Wends]], the German magnate, [[Albert the Bear]], was granted the [[Northern March]] by the Emperor [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothar III]]. He formally inherited the town of Brandenburg and the lands of the Hevelli from their last Wendish ruler, [[Pribislav of Brandenburg|Pribislav]], in 1150. After crushing a force of Sprevane who occupied the town of Brandenburg in the 1150s, Albert proclaimed himself ruler of the new [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]]. Albert, and his descendants the [[House of Ascania|Ascanians]], then made considerable progress in conquering, colonizing, Christianizing, and cultivating lands as far east as the Oder. Within this region, Slavic and German residents intermarried. During the 13th century, the Ascanians began acquiring territory east of the Oder, later known as the [[Neumark]] (see also [[Altmark]]).

===Late Middle Ages===
[[File:Belzig Burg 2.JPG|thumb|Eisenhardt Castle in [[Bad Belzig]]]]
{{Main|Margraviate of Brandenburg}}
In 1320, the Brandenburg Ascanian line came to an end, and from 1323 up until 1415 Brandenburg was under the control of the [[Wittelsbach]]s of [[Bavaria]], followed by the [[House of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] Dynasties. Under the Luxembourgs, the [[Margrave of Brandenburg]] gained the status of a [[prince-elector]] of the Holy Roman Empire. In the period 1373-1415, Brandenburg was a part of the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]]. In 1415, the Electorate of Brandenburg was granted by Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] to the [[House of Hohenzollern]], which would rule until the end of World War I. The Hohenzollerns established their capital in Berlin, by then the economic center of Brandenburg.

===16th and 17th centuries===
{{Main|Brandenburg-Prussia}}
[[File:Schloss Oranienburg - Jan 2013.jpg|thumb|[[Oranienburg Palace]]]]
Brandenburg converted to Protestantism in 1539 in the wake of the [[Protestant Reformation]], and generally did quite well in the 16th century, with the expansion of trade along the Elbe, Havel, and Spree Rivers. The Hohenzollerns expanded their territory by acquiring the [[Duchy of Prussia]] in 1618, the [[Duchy of Cleves]] (1614) in the [[Rhineland]], and territories in [[Westphalia]]. The result was a sprawling, disconnected country known as [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] that was in poor shape to defend itself during the [[Thirty Years' War]].

Beginning near the end of that devastating conflict, however, Brandenburg enjoyed a string of talented rulers who expanded their territory and power in Europe. The first of these was [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]], the so-called "Great Elector", who worked tirelessly to rebuild and consolidate the nation. He moved the royal residence to [[Potsdam]]. At the [[Treaty of Westphalia]], his envoy [[Joachim Friedrich von Blumenthal]] negotiated the acquisition of several important territories such as [[Halberstadt]]. Under the [[Treaty of Oliva]] Christoph Caspar [[von Blumenthal]](son of the above) negotiated the incorporation of the [[Duchy of Prussia]] into the Hohenzollern inheritance.

===Kingdom of Prussia and united Germany===
{{Main|Kingdom of Prussia|Province of Brandenburg}}
[[File:Potsdam Sanssouci Palace.jpg|thumb|[[Sanssouci Palace]], the former summer palace of [[Frederick the Great]], today a [[World Heritage site]]]]

When Frederick William died in 1688, he was followed by his son [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick]], third of that name in Brandenburg. As the lands that had been acquired in Prussia were outside the boundaries of the Holy Roman Empire, Frederick assumed (as Frederick I) the title of "[[King in Prussia]]" (1701). Although his self-promotion from margrave to king relied on his title to the Duchy of Prussia, Brandenburg was still the most important portion of the kingdom. However, this combined state is known as the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].

Brandenburg remained the core of the Kingdom of Prussia, and it was the site of the kingdom's capitals, Berlin and Potsdam. When Prussia was subdivided into provinces in 1815, the territory of the Margraviate of Brandenburg became the [[Province of Brandenburg]], again subdivided into the [[Regierungsbezirk Frankfurt|government regions of Frankfurt]] and [[Potsdam (region)|of Potsdam]]. In 1881, the City of Berlin was separated from the Province of Brandenburg. However, industrial towns ringing Berlin lay within Brandenburg, and the growth of the region's industrial economy brought an increase in the population of the province. The Province of Brandenburg had an area of {{convert|39039|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} and a population of 2.6 million (1925). After World War II, the [[Neumark (region)|Neumark]], the part of Brandenburg east of the [[Oder-Neisse Line]], was transferred to [[Poland]]; and its native German population expelled. The remainder of the province became a state in the [[Soviet Zone of occupation in Germany]] when Prussia was dissolved in 1947.

===East Germany and reunified Germany===
{{Main|German reunification}}
Since the foundation of [[East Germany]] in 1949 Brandenburg formed one of its component states. The State of Brandenburg was completely dissolved in 1952 by the [[Council of Ministers of the GDR|Socialist government of East Germany]], doing away with all component states. The East German government then divided Brandenburg among several ''Bezirke'' or districts. (See [[Administrative division of the German Democratic Republic]]). Most of Brandenburg lay within the [[Cottbus (Bezirk)|Bezirke of Cottbus]], [[Frankfurt (Bezirk)|Frankfurt]], or [[Potsdam (Bezirk)|Potsdam]], but parts of the former province passed to the [[Schwerin (Bezirk)|Schwerin]], [[Neubrandenburg (Bezirk)|Neubrandenburg]] and [[Magdeburg (Bezirk)|Magdeburg districts]] (town [[Havelberg]]). East Germany relied heavily on [[lignite]] (the lowest grade of coal) as an energy source, and lignite strip mines marred areas of southeastern Brandenburg. The industrial towns surrounding Berlin were important to the East German economy, while rural Brandenburg remained mainly agricultural.

The present State of Brandenburg was re-established on 3 October 1990 upon German re-unification.<ref>[http://www.verfassungen.de/de/ddr/ddr90-laeeinf.htm Ländereinführungsgesetz (1990)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The newly elected Landtag of Brandenburg first met on 26 October 1990.<ref>[http://www.brandenburg-geburtstag.de/aktuell/historischer-kalender/]</ref> As in other former parts of East Germany, the lack of modern infrastructure and exposure to West Germany's competitive market economy brought widespread unemployment and economic difficulty. In the recent years, however, Brandenburg's infrastructure has been modernized and unemployment has slowly declined.

In 1995, the governments of Berlin and Brandenburg proposed to merge the states in order to form a new state with the name of "Berlin-Brandenburg", though some suggested calling the proposed new state "Prussia". The merger was rejected in a [[plebiscite]] in 1996 – while West Berliners voted for a merger, East Berliners and Brandenburgers voted against it.

==Geography==
{{See also|Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region|List of places in Brandenburg}}
Brandenburg is bordered by [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] in the north, [[Poland]] in the east, the [[Free State of Saxony|Freistaat Sachsen]] in the south, [[Saxony-Anhalt]] in the west, and [[Lower Saxony]] in the northwest.

The [[Oder River]] forms a part of the eastern border, the [[Elbe|Elbe River]] a portion of the western border. The main rivers in the state itself are the [[Spree]] and the [[Havel]]. In the southeast, there is a wetlands region called the [[Spreewald]]; it is the northernmost part of [[Lusatia]], where the [[Sorbs]], a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] people, still live. These areas are bilingual, i.e., German and [[Sorbian language|Sorbian]] are both used.

===Protected areas===
Brandenburg is known for its well-preserved natural environment and its ambitious natural protection policies which began in the 1990s. 15 large protected areas were designated following [[German reunification|Germany's reunification]]. Each of them is provided with state-financed administration and a park ranger staff, who guide visitors and work to ensure nature conservation. Most protected areas have visitor centers.
