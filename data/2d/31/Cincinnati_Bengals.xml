However, possibly as an insult to<space/><link><target>Art Modell</target></link>, or possibly as an homage to his own start as a head coach to the<space/><link><target>Massillon Washington High School</target><part>Massillon Tigers</part></link>, Brown chose the exact shade of orange used by his former team. He added black as the secondary color. Brown chose a very simple logo: the word &quot;BENGALS&quot; in black lettering. One of the potential helmet designs Brown rejected was a striped motif that was similar to the helmets adopted by the team in<space/><link><target>1981 in sports</target><part>1981</part></link><space/>and which is still in use to this day; however, that design featured yellow stripes on a turquoise helmet which were more uniform in width.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1966, the American Football League agreed to<space/><link><target>AFL-NFL merger</target><part>a merger</part></link><space/>with its older and more established rival, the<space/><link><target>National Football League</target></link>. Among the terms of the merger was that the AFL was permitted to add one additional franchise. One of the reasons the NFL agreed to this was that they wanted an even number of clubs in the merged league, so a team needed to be added that brought the combined total number clubs in the merged league to twenty-six teams. The NFL was content for that team to be in the American Football League because it meant that the existing nine AFL clubs were the ones that had to provide players in the ensuing<space/><link><target>expansion draft</target></link><space/>and the NFL owners preferred for the ensuing dilution of talent to occur in what they have always considered to be an inferior league.<template><target>cn</target><arg name="date">September 2015</arg></template><space/>For the AFL, a key motive behind their agreement to accept a new team was that the guarantee of an eventual place in the NFL meant the league could charge a steep expansion fee of $10 million - 400 times the $25,000 the original eight owners paid when they founded the league in 1960. The cash from the new team provided the American Football League with the funds needed to pay the indemnities required to be paid by the AFL to the NFL, as stipulated by the merger agreement.</paragraph><paragraph>Prior to the merger being announced, Brown had not seriously considered joining the American Football League, and was not a supporter of what he openly regarded to be an inferior competition, once famously stating that &quot;I didn't pay ten million dollars to be in the AFL.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.conigliofamily.com/PaulBrown.htm</arg><arg name="title">Paul Brown</arg><arg name="publisher">Conigliofamily.com</arg><arg name="accessdate">2013-12-16</arg></template></extension><space/>However, with the announcement of the merger, Brown realized that the AFL expansion franchise would likely be his only realistic path back into the NFL in the short to medium term. He ultimately acquiesced to joining the AFL when after learning that the team was guaranteed to become an NFL franchise after the merger was competed in 1970.</paragraph><paragraph>There was also a complication:<space/><link><target>Major League Baseball</target></link>'s<space/><link><target>Cincinnati Reds</target></link><space/>were in need of a facility to replace the antiquated, obsolete<space/><link><target>Crosley Field</target></link>, which they had used since<space/><link><target>1912 Major League Baseball season</target><part>1912</part></link>.

This was especially impressive since two of the teams swept by the Bengals (the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens) had both made it to the AFC Championship Game the previous season. Marvin Lewis was rewarded for the accomplishment with the NFL Coach of the Year Award. In the<space/><link><target>2010 NFL season</target><part>2010 season</part></link>, the Bengals posted a 412 record. The next season, the Bengals improved to 97 and clinched a playoff spot.

When Paul Brown was fired by<space/><link><target>Art Modell</target></link>, Brown still owned the equipment used by Cleveland. So after the firing, Paul Brown packed up all his equipment, which he then used for his new team in Cincinnati. The Cleveland Browns' team colors were brown, orange, and white, then they changed to white, black, and orange, and their helmets were solid orange with a white dorsal stripe over the crest.</paragraph><paragraph>The Bengals' team colors were orange, black, and white, and their helmets were a similar shade of orange, with the only variations being the word &quot;Bengals&quot; in block letters on either side of the helmet and no stripe on the helmet. The Cincinnati Bengals were unique in the NFL as they did not have uniform numbers on the players sleeves until the 1980 season. The team did not discard their Cleveland-like uniforms until 1981. During that year, a then-unique uniform design was introduced. Although the team kept black jerseys, white jerseys, and white pants, they were now trimmed with orange and black tiger stripes. The team also introduced the orange helmets with black tiger stripes that are still in use today.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1997, the Bengals designed a logo consisting of a leaping tiger, and it was added to the uniform sleeves. Another alternate logo consisted of a Bengal's head facing to the left. However, the orange helmet with black tiger stripes continued to be the team's primary trademark. In 2004, a new tiger stripe pattern and more accents were added to the uniforms. The black jerseys now featured orange tiger-striped sleeves and white side panels, while the white jerseys began to use black tiger-striped sleeves and orange shoulders. A new logo consisting of an orange &quot;B&quot; covered with black tiger stripes was introduced. The team also started rotating black pants and debuted an alternate orange jersey, with white side panels and black tiger-striped sleeves. The Bengals have worn their black uniforms at home throughout their history, with some exceptions such as the 1970 season when the Bengals wore white at home for the entire season, and most of the 1971 season. Since 2005, the Bengals wear white for September home games where the heat could become a factor.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Mascots</heading><paragraph>The team's official mascot is a<space/><link><target>bengal tiger</target></link><space/>named Who Dey.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.bengals.com/fanzone/whodey.html</arg><arg name="title">Bengals Mascot "Who Dey"<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Bengals.com</arg><arg name="accessdate">2012-08-15</arg></template></extension><space/>Aside from Who Dey, the team also has the<space/><link><target>Cincinnati BenGals</target></link>, the team's<space/><link><target>NFL Cheerleading</target><part>cheerleading squad</part></link>,<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.bengals.com/cheerleaders/index.html</arg><arg name="title">Ben-Gals Cheerleaders Home</arg><arg name="publisher">Bengals.com</arg><arg name="accessdate">2012-08-15</arg></template></extension><space/>which is known for having<space/><link><target>Laura Vikmanis</target></link>, the oldest cheerleader in league history.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1349473/Laura-Vikmanis-42-NFLs-oldest-cheerleader-Can-younger-girls.html</arg><arg name="title">Laura Vikmanis, 42, is NFL's oldest cheerleader: Can she keep up with younger girls?</arg><arg name="publisher">Dailymail.co.uk</arg><arg name="date">2011-01-22</arg><arg name="accessdate">2012-07-09</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Contributions to NFL culture</heading><heading level='3'>No-Huddle Offense</heading><paragraph>A<space/><bold><link><target>No-Huddle Offense</target></link></bold><space/>was commonly used by all teams when time in the game was running low. However,<space/><link><target>Sam Wyche</target></link>, the head coach of the Bengals in 1988, along with offensive coordinator<space/><link><target>Bruce Coslet</target></link>, made the high-paced offense the standard modality for the ball club regardless of time remaining. By quickly setting up for the next play (often within 510 seconds after the last play despite being afforded 45 seconds) this hindered the other team's defense from substituting situational players, regrouping for tactics, and, some suggest, increased the defense's rate of fatigue (This is attributed to the belief that the offense dictates when a play starts so they tend to be more mentally relaxed and prepared for the start of a play where the defense must remain on a higher level of alert before the play starts). In response the NFL instituted several rules related to this tactic:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>Allowing the defense ample time for substitutions (if offensive substitutions are made);</listitem><listitem>If a player's injury causes the play-clock to stop, the player must sit out at least one play; and</listitem><listitem>Charging a time-out to a team when a player is injured within a certain time period of the game.</listitem></list><paragraph>The hurry-up tactic was used by the franchise during the late 1980s while Sam Wyche was the coach. A rival for AFC supremacy during this time was the<space/><link><target>Buffalo Bills</target></link>, coached by<space/><link><target>Marv Levy</target></link>, who also used a version of the no-huddle offense starting with the 1989 season. The Bengals had beaten the Bills three times in 1988 (pre-season, regular season, and the AFC Championship Game). Marv Levy threatened to fake injuries if the Bengals used the &quot;no-huddle&quot; in the AFC Championship. Coach Wyche was notified that the Commissioner had ordered the &quot;no-huddle&quot; illegal for the game. The official notified Wyche and the Bengals' team just two hours before the game kickoff. Wyche asked to talk directly to the Commissioner and word immediately came back that the &quot;no-huddle&quot; would not be penalized. Coach Levy didn't fake injuries in the game, but installed his version the next year, 1989. The Bengals first used the &quot;no-huddle&quot; in 1984. Most of the high-profile games (the various games for AFC titles and regular season games) between the two led to these changes in NFL rules. Wyche also first used the timeout periods as an opportunity to bring his entire team to the sideline to talk to all eleven players, plus substitutes, at one time. This also allowed trainers time to treat a cut or bruise and equipment managers time to repair an equipment defect.</paragraph><heading level='3'>West Coast offense/Paul Brown's Offense</heading><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>West Coast Offense</target></link><space/>is the popular name for the high-percentage passing scheme designed by former Bengals assistant<space/><link><target>Bill Walsh (American football coach)</target><part>Bill Walsh</part></link>.

Beer vendors who carried full cases of bottled local beer up and down the steep upper stairs of what was then Riverfront Stadium would call out &quot;Hudy&quot;, &quot;Berger&quot; and other local beer names. Raucous fans would often chant back and forth with them as the vendors called out. During the 1980 season the banter with the Hudepohl vendors grew organically into the now famous (Hu-Dey) -Who They?- chant.<extension extension_name='ref'>This is an eye witness account from a Cincinnati Bengals season ticket holder.
