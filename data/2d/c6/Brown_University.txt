'''Brown University''' is a [[Private university|private]] [[Ivy League]] [[Doctoral university|research university]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Rhode Island]]. Founded in 1764 as "The College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations," Brown is the [[List of Colonial Colleges|seventh-oldest institution]]  of [[higher education]] in the [[United States]] and one of the nine [[Colonial Colleges]] established before the [[American Revolution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=B0180 |title=Encyclopedia Brunoniana &#124; Bicentennial celebration |publisher=Brown University |accessdate=July 9, 2009}}</ref> At its foundation, Brown was the first college in the [[United States]] to accept students regardless of their religious affiliation.<ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], p. 30.</ref> Its [[engineering]] program, established in 1847, was the first in what is now known as the [[Ivy League]]. Brown's [[Brown University#History#New Curriculum|New Curriculum]]—sometimes referred to in education theory as the Brown Curriculum—was adopted by faculty vote in 1969 after a period of student lobbying; the New Curriculum eliminated mandatory "general education" distribution requirements, made students "the architects of their own syllabus," and allowed them to take any course for a grade of satisfactory or unrecorded no-credit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=C0780|title=Encyclopedia Brunoniana &#124; Curriculum |publisher=Brown University |accessdate=December 27, 2014}}</ref>  In 1971, Brown's coordinate women's institution, [[Pembroke College (Brown University)|Pembroke College]], was fully merged into the university. 

Undergraduate admissions is among the most selective in the country, with an acceptance rate of 8.5 percent for the class of 2019.<ref name="ReferenceB">Aleksandra Lifshits, "8.5 percent admit rate for class of 2019 breaks University record", ''The Brown Daily Herald'', April 1, 2015; sourcing admissions dean James Miller</ref> The University comprises [[The College of Brown University|The College]], the [[Graduate School of Brown University|Graduate School]], [[Alpert Medical School]], the [[Brown University School of Engineering|School of Engineering]], the School of Public Health, and the School of Professional Studies (which includes the [[IE Business School|IE]] Brown Executive MBA program). Brown's international programs are organized through the [[Watson Institute for International Studies]], and is academically affiliated with the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]] and the [[Rhode Island School of Design]]. The [[Brown University#Brown/RISD Dual Degree Program|Brown/RISD Dual Degree Program]], offered in conjunction with the [[Rhode Island School of Design]], is a five-year course that awards degrees from both institutions.

Brown's main campus is located in the [[College Hill Historic District (Providence, Rhode Island)|College Hill Historic District]] in the city of Providence, the third largest city in [[New England]]. The University's neighborhood is a federally listed architectural district with a dense concentration of ancient buildings. On the western edge of the campus, Benefit Street contains "one of the finest cohesive collections of restored seventeenth- and eighteenth-century architecture in the United States".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.providenceri.com/ONS/neighborhoods/college-hill|title=Providence, Rhode Island - Neighborhood Services - College Hill|publisher=City of Providence|accessdate=October 8, 2014}}</ref>

Prominent alumni include current chair of the Federal Reserve [[Janet Yellen]] '67 and president of the World Bank [[Jim Yong Kim]] '82.

==History==
{{Main|History of Brown University}}

===The foundation and the charter===
[[File:Stephen Hopkins.jpg|thumb|right|159x159px|[[Stephen Hopkins (politician)|Stephen Hopkins]], first chancellor of Brown, governor of Rhode Island, and signer of the [[Declaration of Independence]]]]
[[File:Brown University Ezra Stiles Charter large.jpg|thumb|right|170px|The [[Ezra Stiles]] copy of the Brown University Charter of 1764]]
The origins of Brown University may be dated to 1761 when three residents of [[Newport, Rhode Island]], drafted a petition to the [[Rhode Island General Assembly|General Assembly]] of the colony:<ref>[[#Dexter|Dexter (1916)]], pp. 24–25.</ref>
<blockquote>''"Your Petitioners propose to open a literary institution or School for instructing young Gentlemen in the Languages, Mathematics, Geography & History, & such other branches of Knowledge as shall be desired. That for this End ... it will be necessary ... to erect a public Building or Buildings for the boarding of the youth & the Residence of the Professors."''</blockquote>

The three petitioners were [[Ezra Stiles]], pastor of Newport's [[Clarke Street Meeting House|Second Congregational Church]] and future president of [[Yale University|Yale]]; [[William Ellery|William Ellery, Jr.]], future signer of the [[Declaration of Independence]]; and [[Josias Lyndon]], future governor of the colony. Stiles and Ellery would two years later be co-authors of the Charter of the College. The editor of Stiles's papers observes that, "This draft of a petition connects itself with other evidence of Dr. Stiles's project for a Collegiate Institution in Rhode Island, before the charter of what became Brown University."<ref>[[#Dexter|Dexter (1916)]], p. 25.</ref>

In 1762 there is further documentary evidence that Stiles was making plans for a college. On January 20, Chauncey Whittelsey, pastor of the First Church of New Haven, answered a letter from Stiles:<ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 13–14.</ref>

<blockquote>''"The week before last I sent you the Copy of Yale College Charter. ... Should you make any Progress in the Affair of a Colledge, I should be glad to hear of it; I heartily wish you Success therein."''</blockquote>

The Philadelphia Association of Baptist Churches also had an eye on Rhode Island, home of the mother church of their denomination, the [[First Baptist Church in America]], founded in Providence in 1638 by [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]]. The Baptists were as yet unrepresented among colonial colleges—the [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]] had Harvard and Yale, the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] had the College of New Jersey (later [[Princeton University|Princeton]]), and the [[Church of England|Episcopalians]] had the [[College of William and Mary]] and King's College (later [[Columbia University|Columbia]]). Writing in 1784, Isaac Backus, historian of the New England Baptists and an inaugural Trustee of Brown, described the October 1762 resolution taken at Philadelphia:<ref>Isaac Backus, ''A History of New-England'', 3 vols (Boston, 1777-96), vol. 2, quoted in [[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], p. 8.</ref>

<blockquote>''"The Philadelphia Association obtained such an acquaintance with our affairs, as to bring them to an apprehension that it was practicable and expedient to erect a college in the Colony of Rhode-Island, under the chief direction of the Baptists; ... Mr. [[James Manning (minister)|James Manning]], who took his first degree in New-Jersey college in September, 1762, was esteemed a suitable leader in this important work."''</blockquote>

Manning arrived at [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] in July 1763 and was introduced to Stiles, who agreed to write the Charter for the College. Stiles's first draft was read to the [[Rhode Island General Assembly|General Assembly]] in August 1763 and rejected by Baptist members who worried that the College Board of Fellows would underrepresent the Baptists. A revised Charter, written by Stiles and Ellery, was adopted by the Assembly on March 3, 1764.

In September 1764 the inaugural meeting of the College Corporation was held at Newport. Governor [[Stephen Hopkins (politician)|Stephen Hopkins]] was chosen chancellor, former and future governor [[Samuel Ward (American statesman)|Samuel Ward]] was vice chancellor, [[John Tillinghast]] treasurer, and [[Thomas Eyres]] secretary. The Charter stipulated that the Board of Trustees comprise 22 Baptists, five [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], five Episcopalians, and four Congregationalists. Of the 12 Fellows, eight should be Baptists—including the College president—"and the rest indifferently of any or all Denominations."<ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 502–503; the Charter and its drafts and associated documents are printed in [[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 493–507; and in [[#Guild|Guild (1867)]], pp. 119–146.</ref>

The Charter was not, as is sometimes supposed, the grant of [[King George III]], but rather an Act of the colonial General Assembly. In two particulars the Charter may be said to be a uniquely progressive document. First, where other colleges had curricular strictures against opposing doctrines, Brown's Charter asserted that "Sectarian differences of opinions, shall not make any Part of the Public and Classical Instruction." Second, according to University historian Walter Bronson, "the instrument governing Brown University recognized more broadly and fundamentally than any other the principle of denominational cooperation."<ref name="Bronson, pp. 29-33"/> The oft-repeated statement that Brown's Charter alone prohibited a religious test for College membership is inaccurate; other college charters were also liberal in that particular.

[[James Manning (minister)|James Manning]] was sworn in as the College's first president in 1765 and served until 1791. In 1770 the College moved from [[Warren, Rhode Island]], to the crest of [[College Hill, Providence, Rhode Island|College Hill]] overlooking Providence. [[Solomon Drowne]], a freshman in the class of 1773, wrote in his diary on March 26, 1770:<ref>Quoted in [[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 54–55.</ref>
<blockquote>''"This day the Committee for settling the spot for the College, met at the New-Brick School House, when it was determined it should be set on ye Hill opposite Mr. John Jenkes; up the Presbyterian Lane."''</blockquote>
Presbyterian Lane is the present College Street. The eight-acre site, in two parcels, had been purchased by the Corporation for £219, mainly from [[Moses Brown]] and [[John Brown (Rhode Island)|John Brown]], the parcels having "formed a part of the original home lots of their ancestor, [[Chad Brown (minister)|Chad Brown]], and of George Rickard, who bought them from the Indians." [[University Hall (Brown University)|University Hall]]—known until 1823 as "The College Edifice"—was modelled on [[Nassau Hall]] at the College of New Jersey. Its construction was managed by the firm of Nicholas Brown and Company, which spent £2844 in the first year building the College Edifice and the adjacent President's House.<ref>[[#Guild|Guild (1867)]], pp. 233–236 & 299.</ref><ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 55–56.</ref>[[File:Nicholas Brown Jr by Chester Harding 1836.jpg|thumb|right|230x230px|[[Nicholas Brown, Jr.|Nicholas Brown, Junior]], founder of the [[Providence Athenaeum]], co-founder of [[Butler Hospital]], philanthropist, progressive, and [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]]. Following his major gift in 1804, the College was renamed Brown University. Painting by [[Chester Harding (painter)|Chester Harding]], 1836]]

'''The Brown family'''

The Brown family—[[Nicholas Brown (Brown University)|Nicholas Brown]], his son [[Nicholas Brown, Jr.|Nicholas Brown, Junior]], class of 1786, [[John Brown (Rhode Island)|John Brown]], [[Joseph Brown (astronomer)|Joseph Brown]], and [[Moses Brown]]—were instrumental in moving the College to Providence and securing its endowment. Joseph became a professor of natural philosophy at the College, John served as its treasurer from 1775 to 1796, and Nicholas, Junior, succeeded his uncle as treasurer from 1796 to 1825.

On September 8, 1803, the Corporation voted, "That the donation of $5000 Dollars, if made to this College within one Year from the late Commencement, shall entitle the donor to name the College." In a letter dated September 6, 1804, that appeal was answered by College treasurer Nicholas Brown, Junior, and the Corporation honored its promise: "In gratitude to Mr. Brown, the Corporation at the same meeting voted, 'That this College be called and known in all future time by the Name of Brown University'."<ref name="Bronson, pp. 29-33">[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 29–33.</ref> Over the years, the benefactions of Nicholas Brown, Junior, would total nearly $160,000, an enormous sum for that period, and included the buildings Hope College and Manning Hall, built 1821-22 and 1834-35.

It is sometimes erroneously supposed that Brown University was "named after" John Brown, whose commercial activity included the transportation of African slaves. In fact, Brown University was named for Nicholas Brown, Junior—philanthropist, founder of the [[Providence Athenaeum]], co-founder of [[Butler Hospital]], and, crucially, an [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]]. Under the guidance of his uncle [[Moses Brown]], one of the leading abolitionists of his day, Nicholas Brown, Junior, became a financier of the movement.<ref>{{cite web |author= Howell, Ricardo |date=July 2001 |url= http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Info/Slavery.html |title= Slavery, the Brown Family of Providence and Brown University |publisher= Brown University News Service |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080409001105/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Info/Slavery.html |archivedate= April 9, 2008 }}</ref> (The opposing attitudes to the slave trade within the Brown family—from John Brown's unapologetic participation, to Moses and Nicholas Brown's activist opposition—are described in Ricardo Howell, "Slavery, the Brown Family of Providence and Brown University" (2001, published online at Brown.edu), and in Charles Rappleye, ''Sons of Providence: The Brown Brothers, the Slave Trade, and the American Revolution'' (New York, 2006)).

'''The American Revolution'''

In the fall of 1776, with British vessels patrolling Narragansett Bay, the College library was moved out of Providence for safekeeping. On December 7, 1776, six thousand British and Hessian troops under the command of Sir Peter Parker sailed into Newport harbor. In a letter written after the war, College president Manning said:<ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 66–67.</ref>
<blockquote>''"The royal Army landed on Rhode Island & took possession of the same: This brought their Camp in plain View from the College with the naked Eye; upon which the Country flew to Arms & marched for Providence, there, unprovided with Barracks they marched into the College & dispossessed the Students, about 40 in Number."''</blockquote>

"In the claim for damages presented by the Corporation to the United States government," says the University historian, "it is stated that the American troops used it for barracks and hospital from December 10, 1776, to April 20, 1780, and that the French troops used it for a hospital from June 26, 1780, to May 27, 1782."<ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], p. 68.</ref> The French troops were those of the [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Comte de Rochambeau]].

===The New Curriculum===
In 1850, Brown President [[Francis Wayland]] wrote: "The various courses should be so arranged that, insofar as practicable, every student might study what he chose, all that he chose, and nothing but what he chose."<ref>{{cite web

|accessdate=December 5, 2007
|work=About Brown
}}</ref> Adopted in 1969, the New Curriculum is a milestone in the University's history and is seen as the realization of Wayland's vision.

The [[curriculum]] was the result of a paper written by [[Ira Magaziner]] and Elliot Maxwell titled "Draft of a Working Paper for Education at Brown University."<ref>{{cite web

|publisher=Brown University Library |display-authors=etal}}</ref> The paper came out of a year-long Group Independent Study Project (GISP) involving 80 students and 15 professors. The GISP was inspired by student-initiated experimental schools, especially [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco State College]], and sought ways to "put students at the center of their education" and "teach students how to think rather than just teaching facts."<ref name="bdh_newcurr">{{cite news

|title=The New Curriculum Then
|accessdate=December 5, 2007 }}</ref>

The paper made concrete proposals for the new curriculum, including [[interdisciplinary]] freshman-year courses that would introduce "modes of thought," with instruction from faculty brought together from different disciplines. The aim was to transform the traditional survey course—often experienced passively by first-year students—into a more engaging process, an investigation of the intellectual and philosophical connections between disciplines. A grading option of Satisfactory/No Credit would be introduced to encourage students to try courses outside their grade-point comfort zone. In practice, this grading innovation of the New Curriculum—sometimes misunderstood and mischaracterized—has been its most successful component, responsible, in the decades since its adoption, for uncounted career-changing decisions—studio art swapped for neuroscience, biology swapped for anthropology, mathematics swapped for playwriting (and [[Pulitzer Prize]]s).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia

In the spring of 1969, following student rallies in support of reform, University president Ray Heffner appointed the Special Committee on Curricular Philosophy, tasked with developing specific reforms. The resulting report, called the Maeder Report after its committee chair, was presented to the faculty, which voted the New Curriculum into existence on May 7, 1969. Its key features included:<ref name="bdh_newcurr" />
* Modes of Thought courses for first-year students
* The introduction of interdisciplinary courses
* The abandonment of "general education" distribution requirements
* The Satisfactory/No Credit grading option
* The ABC/No Credit grading system, which eliminated pluses, minuses, and D's; a grade of "No Credit" would not appear on external transcripts.

The Modes of Thought course, a key component in the original conception of the New Curriculum, was early on discontinued, but all of the other elements are still in place. In 2006 the reintroduction of plus/minus grading was broached by persons concerned about grade inflation. After a canvassing of alumni, faculty, and students, including the original authors of the Magaziner-Maxwell Report, the idea was rejected by the College Curriculum Council.<ref>{{cite web

|title=Brown Houses
|accessdate=December 21, 2007
|publisher=Brown University}}</ref> The College Hill campus was built contemporarily with the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century precincts that surround it, so that University buildings blend with the architectural fabric of the city. The only indicator of "campus" is a brick and wrought-iron fence on Prospect, George, and Waterman streets, enclosing the College Green and Front Green. The character of Brown's urban campus is, then, European organic rather than American landscaped.

===Main campus===
{{further|List of Brown University buildings}}
The main campus, comprising 235 buildings and {{convert|143|acre|km2}}, is on College Hill in Providence's [[East Side, Providence, Rhode Island|East Side]]. It is reached from downtown principally by three extremely steep streets—College, Waterman, and [[Angell Street|Angell]]—which run through the Benefit Street historic district and the campus of the [[Rhode Island School of Design]]. College Street, culminating with Van Wickle Gates at the top of the hill, is especially beautiful, and is the setting for the Convocation and Commencement processions.

[[File:BrownUniversity-OpeningConvocation.jpg|thumb|225x225px|At Convocation, new students march through Van Wickle Gates, built 1900-01, designed by [[Howard Hoppin|Hoppin and Ely]] of Providence and [[Howard Hoppin|Hoppin and Koen]] of New York.<ref>In later sources the architects are variously given as Hoppin & Koen of New York, or Hoppin & Ely of Providence, or both. The Hoppins were brothers; in 1895 Ely had taken Francis's place in the Providence firm. ''The Brown Alumni Monthly'' (December 1900, p. 67) says both firms were the designers; ''The American Institute of Architects Quarterly Bulletin'' (vol. 4, 1903, p. 123) shows Hoppin & Ely, with Hoppin & Koen as "associated architects"</ref> The gates were the gift of Augustus Stout Van Wickle, class of 1876, who also gave the [[FitzRandolph Gateway]] at Princeton, built 1905, as a memorial to his ancestor Nathaniel FitzRandolph]]
'''Van Wickle Gates'''
{{Main|Van Wickle Gates}}
The Van Wickle Gates, dedicated on June 18, 1901, have a pair of smaller side gates that are open year round, and a large central gate that is opened two days a year for Convocation and Commencement. At Convocation the gate opens inward to admit the procession of new students. At Commencement the gate opens outward for the procession of graduates.<ref>Mitchell, Martha. (1993). "[http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=V0020 Van Wickle Gates]." ''Encyclopedia Brunoniana''</ref> A Brown superstition is that students who walk through the central gate a second time prematurely will not graduate, although walking backwards is said to cancel the hex. Members of the [[Brown University Band]] famously flout the superstition by walking through the gate three times too many, as they annually play their role in the Commencement parade.

[[File:BrownUniversity-CarrieTower.jpg|thumb|left|223x223px|Carrie Tower, built 1904 in [[English Baroque]] style, is a memorial to Caroline Mathilde Brown, granddaughter of [[Nicholas Brown, Jr.|Nicholas Brown]], class of 1786, for whom the University is named]]
The core green spaces of the main campus are the Front (or "Quiet") Green, the College (or "Main") Green, and the Ruth J. Simmons Quadrangle (until 2012 called Lincoln Field). The old buildings on these three greens are the most photographed.

Adjacent to this older campus are, to the south, academic buildings and residential quadrangles, including Wriston, Keeney, and Gregorian quadrangles; to the east, Sciences Park occupying two city blocks; to the north, connected to Simmons Quadrangle by The Walk, academic and residential precincts, including the life sciences complex and the Pembroke Campus; and to the west, on the slope of College Hill, academic buildings, including List Art Center and the Hay and Rockefeller libraries. Also on the slope of College Hill, contiguous with Brown, is the campus of the [[Rhode Island School of Design]].

[[File:BrownUniversity-JohnHayLibrary.jpg|thumb|right|211x211px|The [[John Hay Library]], built 1910, designed by [[Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge]] in the [[English Renaissance]] style, is home to rare books, special collections, and the University archives]]

The John Hay Library is the second oldest library on campus. It was opened in 1910 and named for [[John Hay]] (class of 1858, private secretary to [[Abraham Lincoln]] and Secretary of State under two Presidents) at the request of his friend [[Andrew Carnegie]], who contributed half of the $300,000 cost of the building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=J0080 |title=From Martha Mitchell's ''Encyclopedia Brunoniana'': John Hay Library |publisher=Brown.edu |accessdate=April 1, 2012}}</ref> It is now the repository of the University's archives, rare books and manuscripts, and special collections.

'''John Carter Brown Library'''
{{Main|John Carter Brown Library}}
The John Carter Brown Library, founded in 1846, is administered separately from the University, but has been located on the Main Green of the campus since 1904. It is generally regarded as the world's leading collection of primary historical sources pertaining to the Americas before 1825. It houses a very large percentage of the titles published before that date about the discovery, settlement, history, and natural history of the New World. The "JCB", as it is known, published the 29-volume ''Bibliotheca Americana'', a principal bibliography in the field. Typical of its noteworthy holdings is the best preserved of the eleven surviving copies of the [[Bay Psalm Book]] the earliest extant book printed in British North America and the most expensive printed book in the world.<ref>BBC News, "Bay Psalm Book is most expensive printed work at $14.2m," [http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-25115524]; [http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/2013/the-bay-psalm-book-sale-n09039/The-Bay-Psalm-Book/2013/10/census-of-copies-of-.html]</ref> There is also a very fine Shakespeare [[First Folio]], added to the collection by John Carter Brown's widow (a Shakespeare enthusiast) on the grounds that it includes ''[[The Tempest]]'', a play set in the New World. The JCB holdings comprise more than 50,000 early titles and about 16,000 modern books, as well as prints, manuscripts, maps, and other items in the library's specialty.

===Haffenreffer Museum===
{{Main|Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology}}
The exhibition galleries of the Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology, Brown's teaching museum, are located in Manning Hall on the campus's main green. Its one million artifacts, available for research and educational purposes, are located at its Collections Research Center in Bristol, RI.  The museum's goal is to inspire creative and critical thinking about culture by fostering interdisciplinary understanding of the material world. It provides opportunities for faculty and students to work with collections and the public, teaching through objects and programs in classrooms and exhibitions. The museum sponsors lectures and events in all areas of anthropology, and also runs an extensive program of outreach to local schools.

The "Walk" connects Pembroke Campus to the main campus.  It is a succession of green spaces extending from Ruth Simmons Quadrangle (Lincoln Field) in the south to the Pembroke College monument on Meeting Street in the north.  It is bordered by departmental buildings and the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts. A focal point of The Walk will be the [[Maya Lin]]-designed water-circulating topographical sculpture of Narragansett Bay, to be installed in 2014 next to the Institute for the Study of Environment and Society.

===Pembroke campus===
The [[Pembroke College in Brown University|Women's College in Brown University]], known as Pembroke College, was founded in October 1891. When it merged with Brown in 1971, the Pembroke Campus was absorbed into the Brown campus. The Pembroke campus is centered on a quadrangle that fronts on Meeting Street, where a garden and monument—with scale-model of the quadrangle in bronze—compose the formal entry to the campus. The Pembroke campus is among the most pleasing spaces at Brown, with noteworthy examples of Victorian and Georgian architecture. The west side of the quadrangle comprises Pembroke Hall (1897), Smith-Buonanno Hall (1907, formerly Pembroke Gymnasium), and Metcalf Hall (1919); the east side comprises Alumnae Hall (1927) and Miller Hall (1910); the quadrangle culminates on the north with Andrews Hall (1947) and its terrace and garden. Pembroke Hall, originally a classroom building and library, now houses the Cogut Center for the Humanities.

[[File:BrownUniversity-OrwigMusicBuilding.jpg|thumb|left|253x253px|The Orwig Music Library in the former Isaac Gifford Ladd house, built 1850, acquired in 1969 when Brown bought the buildings and grounds of [[Bryant University]] on the southeast edge of the Brown campus]]
East Campus, centered on Hope and Charlesfield streets, was originally the site of [[Bryant University]]. In 1969, as Bryant was preparing to move to Smithfield, Rhode Island, Brown bought their Providence campus for $5 million. This expanded the Brown campus by {{convert|10|acre|m2}} and 26 buildings, included several historic houses, notably the Isaac Gifford Ladd house, built 1850 (now Brown's Orwig Music Library), and the Robert Taft House, built 1895 (now King House). The area was named East Campus in 1971.

[[Thayer Street]] runs through Brown's main campus, north to south, and is College Hill's reduced-scale counterpart to [[Harvard Square]] or Berkeley's [[Telegraph Avenue]]. Restaurants, cafes, bistros, tavernas, pubs, bookstores, second-hand shops, and the like abound. Tourists, people-watchers, buskers, and students from Providence's six colleges make the scene. Half a mile south of campus is Thayer Street's hipper cousin, [[Wickenden Street]]. More picturesque and with older architecture, it features galleries, pubs, specialty shops, artist-supply stores, and a regionally famous coffee shop that doubles as a film set (for [[Woody Allen]] and others).

[[Brown Stadium]], built in 1925 and home to the football team, is located approximately a mile to the northeast of the main campus.  Marston Boathouse, the home of the crew teams, lies on the Blackstone/Seekonk River, to the southeast of campus. Brown's Warren Alpert Medical School is situated in the historic [[Jewelry District (Providence)|Jewelry District of Providence]], near the medical campus of Brown's teaching hospitals, [[Rhode Island Hospital]], [[Women & Infants Hospital of Rhode Island|Women and Infants Hospital]], and Hasbro Children's Hospital. Other University research facilities in the Jewelry District include the Laboratories for Molecular Medicine.

Brown's School of Public Health occupies a landmark modernist building overlooking Memorial Park on the Providence Riverwalk. Brown also owns {{convert|376|acre|km2|sing=on}} the [[Mount Hope (Rhode Island)|Mount Hope Grant]] in Bristol, Rhode Island, an important [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[King Philip's War]] site. Brown's [[Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology]] Collection Research Center, particularly strong in Native American items, is located in the Mount Hope Grant.

{{Main|List of Presidents of Brown University}}
Brown's current president [[Christina Hull Paxson]] took office in 2012. She had previously been dean of the [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs|Woodrow Wilson School]] at [[Princeton University]] and a past-chair of Princeton's economics department.<ref>{{cite web|author=&nbsp; |url=http://news.brown.edu/pressreleases/2012/03/paxson |title=Economist Christina Hull Paxson elected 19th president of Brown University &#124; Brown University News and Events |publisher=News.brown.edu |date=March 2, 2012 |accessdate=April 1, 2012|others=Media Contact: Marisa Quinn}}</ref> In 2014 and 2015 Paxson will preside during the year-long celebration of the 250th anniversary of Brown's founding. Her immediate predecessor as president was Ruth J. Simmons, the first [[African American]] president of an Ivy League institution. Simmons will remain at Brown as a professor of Comparative Literature and Africana Studies.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ruth Simmons Resigning|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/15/ruth-simmons-resigning-brown_n_964174.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=September 9, 2011|first=Alana|last=Horowitz}}</ref>

===The College===
{{Main|The College of Brown University}}
Founded in 1764, the College is the oldest school of Brown University. About 6,400 undergraduate students are currently enrolled in the College, and 79 concentrations (majors) are offered. Completed concentrations of undergraduates by area are social sciences 42 percent, humanities 26 percent, life sciences 17 percent, and physical sciences 14 percent.<ref name="brown.edu">{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Institutional_Research/documents/QuickReference09-10.pdf|title=Home|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=October 8, 2014}}</ref> The concentrations with the greatest number of students are Biology, History, and International Relations. Brown is one of the few schools in the United States with an undergraduate concentration (major) in [[Egyptology]]. Undergraduates can also design an independent concentration if the existing programs do not align with their curricular focus.

35 percent of undergraduates pursue graduate or professional study immediately, 60 percent within 5 years, and 80 percent within 10 years.<ref name="admit-facts">{{cite web|author=Brown University |url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/factsandfigures.html |title=Brown University Office of Admission facts and figures |publisher=Brown.edu |accessdate=April 1, 2012}}</ref> For the Class of 1998, 75 percent of all graduates have since enrolled in a graduate or professional degree program.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Institutional_Research/documents/UndergraduateOutcomes2008.pdf|title=Home|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=October 8, 2014}}</ref> The degrees acquired were doctoral 22 percent, master's 35 percent, medicine 28 percent, and law 14 percent.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The highest fields of employment for graduates of the College are business 36 percent, education 19 percent, health/medical 6 percent, arts 6 percent, government 6 percent, and communications/media 5 percent.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The language of the College Charter has been interpreted as discouraging the establishment professional schools. Brown and Princeton are the only Ivy League colleges with neither business school nor law school.

[[File:BrownUniversity-ListArtBuilding.jpg|thumb|right|208x208px|The List Art Center, built 1969-71, designed by [[Philip Johnson]], houses the Department of Visual Art and the David Winton Bell Gallery, and is adjacent to the campus of the [[Rhode Island School of Design]]]]

===Brown/RISD Dual Degree Program===
Brown's near neighbor on College Hill is the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] (RISD), America's top-ranked art college.<ref>{{cite web|title=RISD Ranks #1 for Fine Arts Grad Programs|url=http://www.risd.edu/About/News/RISD_Ranks_1.aspx|accessdate=9 March 2015|date=15 March 2011}}</ref> Brown and RISD students can cross-register at the two institutions, with Brown students permitted to take as many as four courses at RISD that count towards a Brown degree. The two institutions partner to provide various student-life services and the two student bodies compose a synergy in the College Hill cultural scene.

The Brown/RISD Dual Degree Program, among the most selective in the country, offered admission to 17 of the 512 applicants for the class entering in autumn 2015, an acceptance rate of 3.3 percent.<ref name="ReferenceC">news.brown.edu/articles/2015/03/admission; sourcing admissions dean James Miller</ref> It combines the complementary strengths of the two institutions, integrating studio art at RISD with the entire spectrum of Brown's departmental offerings. Students are admitted to the Dual Degree Program for a course lasting five years and culminating in both the Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) degree from Brown and the Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) degree from RISD. Prospective students must apply to the two schools separately and be accepted by separate admissions committees. Their application must then be approved by a third Brown/RISD joint committee.

Admitted students spend the first year in residence at RISD completing its "foundation course," and the second year in residence at Brown. Another year at each school ensues, with the fifth year spent according to the student's electives. Program participants are noted for their creative and original approach to cross-disciplinary opportunities, combining, for example, industrial design with engineering, or anatomical illustration with human biology, or philosophy with sculpture, or architecture with urban studies. An annual "BRDD Exhibition" is a well-publicized and heavily attended event, drawing interest and attendees from the wider world of industry, design, the media, and the fine arts.

===Theatre and playwriting===

Brown's theatre and playwriting programs are among of the best-regarded in the country. Since 2003 eight different Brown graduates have either won (four times) or been nominated for (six times) the [[Pulitzer Prize]]—including winners [[Lynn Nottage]] '86, [[Ayad Akhtar]] '93, [[Nilo Cruz]] '94, and [[Quiara Alegría Hudes]] '04; and nominees [[Sarah Ruhl]] '97 (twice), [[Gina Gionfriddo]] '97 (twice), [[Stephen Karam]] '02, and [[Jordan Harrison]] '03. In ''American Theater'' magazine's 2009 ranking of the most-produced American plays, Brown graduates occupied four of the top five places—Peter Nachtrieb '97, Rachel Sheinkin '89, Sarah Ruhl '97, and Stephen Karam '02.<ref>Kathy Borchers, "Brown University turning out one exceptional playwright after another," Associated Press (''Providence Journal''), December 18, 2009; [http://www.playbill.com/features/article/most-produced-plays]</ref>

The undergraduate concentration (major) encompasses programs in theatre history, performance theory, playwriting, dramaturgy, acting, directing, dance, speech, and technical production. Applications for doctoral and master's degree programs are made through the University Graduate School. Master's degrees in acting and directing are pursued in conjunction with the Rep MFA program, which partners with one of the country's great regional theatres, [[Trinity Repertory Company]], home of the last longstanding resident acting company in the country.<ref>Molly Lederer, "Trinity Rep is still shining after 50 years," ''East Side Monthly'', Oct. 2013, p. 17</ref> Trinity Rep's present artistic director [[Curt Columbus]] succeeded [[Oskar Eustis]] in 2006, when Eustis was chosen to lead New York's [[The Public Theater|Public Theater]].

The many performance spaces available to Brown students include the Chace and Dowling theaters at Trinity Rep; the McCormack Family, Lee Strasberg, Rites and Reason, Ashamu Dance, Stuart, and Leeds theatres in University departments; the Upstairs Space and Downstairs Space belonging to the wholly student-run [[Production Workshop]]; and Alumnae Hall, used by Brown University Gilbert & Sullivan and by [[Brown Opera Productions]]. Production design courses utilize the John Street Studio of [[Eugene Lee (designer)|Eugene Lee]], three-time [[Tony Award]]-winner.

===Writing programs===

Writing at Brown—fiction, non-fiction, poetry, playwriting, screenwriting, electronic writing, mixed media, and the undergraduate writing proficiency requirement—is catered for by various centers and degree programs, and a faculty that has long included nationally and internationally known authors. The undergraduate concentration (major) in literary arts offers courses in fiction, poetry, screenwriting, literary hypermedia, and translation. Graduate programs include the fiction and poetry MFA writing programs in the literary arts department, and the MFA playwriting program in the theatre arts and performance studies department. The non-fiction writing program is offered in the English department. Screenwriting and cinema narrativity courses are offered in the departments of literary arts and modern culture and media. The undergraduate writing proficiency requirement is supported by the Writing Center.

===Author prizewinners===

Alumni authors take their degrees across the spectrum of degree concentrations, but a gauge of the strength of writing at Brown is the number of major national writing prizes won. To note only winners since the year 2000: [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]]-winners [[Jeffrey Eugenides]] '82 (2003) and [[Marilynne Robinson]] '66 (2005); British [[Orange Prize]]-winners [[Marilynne Robinson]] '66 (2009) and [[Madeline Miller]] '00 (2012); [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]]-winners [[Nilo Cruz]] '94 (2003), [[Lynn Nottage]] '86 (2009), [[Quiara Alegría Hudes]] '04 (2012), and [[Ayad Akhtar]] '93 (2013); [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography|Pulitzer Prize for Biography]]-winner [[David Kertzer]] '69 (2015); [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer Prize for Journalism]]-winners [[James Risen]] '77 (twice, 2002, 2006), [[Mark Maremont]] '80 (twice, 2003, 2007), [[Gareth Cook]] '91 (2005), Peter Kovacs '77 (2006), Stephanie Grace '86 (2006), Mary Swerczek '98 (2006), Jane B. Spencer '99 (2006), [[Usha Lee McFarling]] '89 (2007), James Bandler '89 (2007), Amy Goldstein '75 (2009), and [[David Rohde]] '90 (twice, 1996, 2009).

===Computer science===
Teaching of computer science began at Brown in 1956 when an IBM machine was installed and computing courses were offered through the departments of Economics and Applied Mathematics. In January 1958 an IBM650 was added, the only one of its type between Hartford and Boston. In 1960 Brown's first computer building, designed by [[Philip Johnson]], was opened on George Street and an IBM7070 computer installed the next year. It was given full Departmental status in 1979. In 2009, IBM and Brown announced the installation of a supercomputer (by teraflops standards), the most powerful in the southeastern New England region.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.brown.edu/articles/2009/11/supercomputer|title=Brown, IBM Unveil Multimillion-Dollar Supercomputer - News from Brown|work=brown.edu|accessdate=July 24, 2015}}</ref>
The [[Hypertext Editing System]]s, [[Hypertext Editing System|HES]] and [[FRESS]], were invented in the 1960s at Brown by [[Andries van Dam]], [[Ted Nelson]], and [[Bob Wallace]], with Nelson coining the word ''[[hypertext]]''. Van Dam's students were instrumental in the origin of the [[XML]], [[XSLT]], and related Web standards. Brown alumni who have distinguished themselves in the computer sciences and industry are listed in the Notable people section, below. They include a principal architect of the [[Macintosh Operating System]], a principal architect of the [[Intel 80386]] microprocessor line, the [[Windows 95|Microsoft Windows 95]] project chief, a CEO of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], the current head of the [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]], the inaugural chair of the [[Computing Community Consortium]], and design chiefs at [[Pixar]] and [[Industrial Light & Magic]], protegees of graphics guru [[Andries van Dam]]. The character "Andy" in the animated film ''Toy Story'' is taken to be an homage to Van Dam from his students employed at Pixar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/trivia|title=IMDB trivia for Toy Story page|work=IMDb|accessdate=October 8, 2014}}</ref> Van Dam denies this, but a copy of his book (''Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice'') appears on Andy's bookshelf in the film. Brown computer science graduate and ''[[Heroes (TV series)|Heroes]]'' actor [[Masi Oka]] '97, was an animator at [[Industrial Light & Magic]].

The department today is home to [[Cave Automatic Virtual Environment|The CAVE]]. This project is a [[virtual reality]] room used for everything from three-dimensional drawing classes to tours of the [[circulatory system]] for medical students. In 2000 students from Brown's Technology House converted the south face of the Sciences Library into a [[Tetris]] game, the first high-rise-building Tetris ever attempted. Code named La Bastille, the game used a [[personal computer]] running [[Linux]], a radio-frequency video game controller, eleven circuit boards, a 12-story data network, and over 10,000 Christmas lights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bastilleweb.techhouse.org/ |title=La Bastille: A Tech House Art Installation |publisher=Bastilleweb.techhouse.org |date=April 14, 2000 |accessdate=April 1, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web

===The Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology===
The Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World pursues fieldwork and excavations, regional surveys, and academic study of the archaeology and art of the ancient Mediterranean, Egypt, and Western Asia from the Levant to the Caucasus. The Institute has a very active fieldwork profile, with faculty-led excavations and regional surveys presently in Petra, Jordan, in West-Central Turkey, at Abydos in Egypt, and in Sudan, Italy, Mexico, Guatemala, Montserrat in the West Indies, and Providence, Rhode Island.

The Institute's faculty includes cross-appointments from the departments of Egyptology, Assyriology, Classics, Anthropology, and History of Art and Architecture. Faculty research and publication areas include Greek and Roman art and architecture, landscape archaeology, urban and religious architecture of the Levant, Roman provincial studies, the Aegean Bronze Age, and the archaeology of the Caucasus. The Institute offers visiting teaching appointments and postdoctoral fellowships which have, in recent years, included Near Eastern Archaeology and Art, Classical Archaeology and Art, Islamic Archaeology and Art, and Archaeology and Media Studies.

'''Egyptology and Assyriology'''

Facing the Joukowsky Institute, across the Front Green, is the Department of Egyptology and Assyriology, formed in 2006 by the merger of Brown's renowned departments of Egyptology and History of Mathematics. It is one of only a handful of such departments in the United States. The curricular focus is on three principal areas: Egyptology (the study of the ancient languages, history, and culture of Egypt), Assyriology (the study of the ancient lands of present-day Iraq, Syria, and Turkey), and the history of the ancient exact sciences (astronomy, astrology, and mathematics). Many courses in the department are open to all Brown undergraduates without prerequisite, and include archaeology, languages, history, and Egyptian and Mesopotamian religions, literature, and science. Students concentrating (majoring) in the department choose a track of either Egyptology or Assyriology. Graduate level study comprises three tracks to the doctoral degree: Egyptology, Assyriology, or the History of the Exact Sciences in Antiquity.

Three Brown undergraduate concentrations (majors) are hosted by the Watson Institute—Development Studies, International Relations, and Public Policy.  Graduate programs offered at the Watson Institute include the Graduate Program in Development (Ph.D.) and the Public Policy Program (M.P.A).  The Institute also offers Post Doctoral, professional development and global outreach programming.  In support of these programs, the Institute houses various centers, including the Brazil Initiative, Brown-India Initiative, China Initiative, Middle East Studies center, The Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS) and the Taubman Center for Public Policy. In recent years, the most internationally cited product of the Watson Institute has been its [[Casualties of the Iraq War|Costs of War Project]], first released in 2011 and continuously updated. The Project comprises a team of economists, anthropologists, political scientists, legal experts, and physicians, and seeks to calculate the economic costs, human casualties, and impact on civil liberties of the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan since 2001.

===The School of Engineering===
{{main|Brown University School of Engineering}}

Established in 1847, Brown's engineering program is the oldest in the Ivy League and the third oldest civilian engineering program in the country, preceded only by [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] (1824) and [[Union College]] (1845). In 1916 the departments of electrical, mechanical, and civil engineering were merged into a Division of Engineering, and in 2010 the division was elevated to a School of Engineering.

Engineering at Brown is especially interdisciplinary. The School is organized without the traditional departments or boundaries found at most schools, and follows a model of connectivity between disciplines—including biology, medicine, physics, chemistry, computer science, the humanities and the social sciences. The School practices an innovative clustering of faculties in which engineers team with non-engineers to bring a convergence of ideas.

===IE Brown Executive MBA Dual Degree Program===
Since 2009 Brown has developed an Executive MBA program in conjunction with one of the leading Business Schools in Europe; [[IE Business School]] in Madrid. This relationship has since strengthen till both institutions offering a dual degree program.<ref>{{cite web |author= Brown's website |date=October 2014 |url= http://brown.edu/professional/executive/iebrown-mba/ |title= IE Brown Executive MBA |publisher= Brown University News Service |archiveurl= http://brown.edu/professional/executive/iebrown-mba/ |archivedate= October 30, 2014 }}</ref> In this partnership, Brown provides its traditional coursework while IE provides most of the business-related subjects making a differentiated alternative program to other Ivy League's EMBAs.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Patrick|title=Brown University Gets Into the MBA Game|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-05-23/brown-university-gets-into-the-mba-game|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=9 March 2015|date=May 23, 2014}}</ref> The cohort typically consist of 25-30 EMBA candidates from some 20 countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iebrown.com/faqs.php|title=IE Brown Executive MBA - Faqs - IE Brown Executive MBA|work=iebrown.com|accessdate=July 24, 2015}}</ref>

'''The Pembroke Center'''
{{Main|Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women}}
The Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women was established at Brown in 1981 by [[Joan Wallach Scott]] as a research center on gender. It was named for Pembroke College, the former women's coordinate college at Brown, and is affiliated with Brown's [[Sarah Doyle Women's Center]]. It supports the undergraduate concentration in [[Gender]] and [[Human sexuality|Sexuality]] Studies, post-doctoral research fellowships, the annual Pembroke Seminar, and other academic programs. The Center also manages various collections, archives, and resources, including the Elizabeth Weed Feminist Theory Papers and the Christine Dunlap Farnham Archive.

'''The Graduate School'''
{{Main|Brown University Graduate School}}
Established in 1887, the Graduate School has around 2,000 students studying over 50 disciplines. 20 different [[master's degrees]] are offered as well as [[Ph.D.]] degrees in over 40 subjects ranging from [[applied mathematics]] to [[public policy]].  Overall, admission to the Graduate School is most competitive with an acceptance rate of about 18 percent.

===Alpert Medical School===
{{Main|Alpert Medical School}}
The University's medical program started in 1811, but the school was suspended by President Wayland in 1827 after the program's faculty declined to live on campus (a new requirement under Wayland). In 1975, the first M.D. degrees from the new Program in Medicine were awarded to a graduating class of 58 students. In 1991, the school was officially renamed the Brown University School of Medicine, then renamed once more to Brown Medical School in October 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://med.brown.edu/timeline/ |title=History of the Brown Medical School |publisher=Med.brown.edu |accessdate=June 6, 2012}}</ref> In January 2007, Warren Alpert donated $100 million to Brown Medical School, in recognition of which its name was changed to the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University.

In 2014 ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' ranked Brown's medical school the 5th most selective in the country, with an acceptance rate of 2.9 percent.<ref name=usnews.com>{{cite web|last1=Smith-Barrow|first1=Delece|title=10 Medical Schools With the Lowest Acceptance Rates|url=http://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/the-short-list-grad-school/articles/2014/03/27/10-medical-schools-with-the-lowest-acceptance-rates|publisher=U.S. News and World Report LP|date=March 27, 2014}}</ref>

The medical school is known especially for its eight-year [[Program in Liberal Medical Education]] (PLME), inaugurated in 1984. One of the most selective programs of its type in the country, it offered admission to 90 of the 2,216 applicants for the class entering in autumn 2015, an acceptance rate of 4.1 percent.<ref name="ReferenceC"/> Since 1976, the Early Identification Program (EIP) has encouraged Rhode Island residents to pursue careers in medicine by recruiting sophomores from [[Providence College]], [[Rhode Island College]], the [[University of Rhode Island]], and [[Tougaloo College]]. In 2004, the school once again began to accept applications from premedical students at other colleges and universities via [[AMCAS]] like most other medical schools. The medical school also offers combined degree programs leading to the M.D./[[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], M.D./[[Master of Public Health|M.P.H.]] and M.D./[[Master of Public Policy|M.P.P.]] degrees.

===The Marine Biological Laboratory===
{{Main|Marine Biological Laboratory}}
The [[Marine Biological Laboratory]] (MBL) is an independent research institution established in 1882 at Woods Hole, Massachusetts. The laboratory is linked to 54 current or past [[Nobel Laureates]] who have been research or teaching faculty. Since 2005 the MBL and Brown have collaborated in a Ph.D. program in biological and environmental sciences that combines faculty at both institutions, including the faculties of the Ecosystems Center, the Bay Paul Center, the Program in Cellular Dynamics, and the Marine Resources Center.

==Student life==

=== Residential and Greek societies ===
[[File:BrownUniversity-LaddObservatory.jpg|thumb|right|270px|[[Ladd Observatory]], built 1890-91, is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]]]

About 12 percent of Brown students are in fraternities and sororities. There are 11 residential Greek houses: six fraternities ([[Alpha Epsilon Pi]], [[Delta Phi]], Delta Tau, [[Phi Kappa Psi]], [[Sigma Chi]], and [[Theta Delta Chi]]; three sororities ([[Alpha Chi Omega]], [[Kappa Alpha Theta]], and [[Kappa Delta]]), one co-ed house ([[Zeta Delta Xi]]), and one co-ed literary society ([[Alpha Delta Phi#The Society|Alpha Delta Phi]]). [[Phi Sigma Kappa]] fraternity was present on campus from 1906 to 1939, but was unable to reactivate after WWII due to wartime losses.<ref name="ATPS">{{cite book |last1= Rand |first1= Frank Prentice |last2= Watts |first2= Ralph |last3= Sefton |first3= James E. |title= All The Phi Sigs – A History |publisher= Grand Chapter of Phi Sigma Kappa |year= 1993}}</ref> All recognized Greek-letter organizations are located on campus in Wriston Quadrangle in University-owned housing. They are overseen by the Greek Council.

An alternative to Greek-letter organizations are the program houses organized by themes. As with Greek houses, the residents of program houses select their new members, usually at the start of the Spring semester. Examples of program houses are [[St. Anthony Hall]] (located in King House), Buxton International House, the Machado [[French language|French]]/[[Hispanic]] House, Technology House, Harambee (African culture) House, Social Action House and [[Interfaith]] House.

Currently, there are three student cooperative houses at Brown. Two of them, Watermyn and Finlandia on Waterman Street, are owned by the [[Brown Association for Cooperative Housing]] (BACH), an non-profit corporation owned by its members. The third co-op, West House, is located in a Brown-owned house on Brown Street. The three organizations run a vegetarian co-op for the larger community.

=== Societies and clubs ===

The earliest societies at Brown were devoted to oration and debate. The Pronouncing Society is mentioned in the diary of [[Solomon Drowne]], class of 1773, who was voted its president in 1771. It seems to have disappeared during the [[Revolutionary War]]. We next hear of the Misokosmian Society, founded in 1794 and renamed the Philermenian Society in 1798. This was effectively a secret society with membership limited to 45. It met fortnightly to hear speeches and debate and thrived until the Civil War; in 1821 its library held 1594 volumes. In 1799 a chapter of the Philandrian Society, also secret, was established at the College. In 1806 the United Brothers was formed as an egalitarian alternative to the Philermenian Society. "These two great rivals," says the University historian, "divided the student body between them for many years, surviving into the days of President Sears. A tincture of political controversy sharpened their rivalry, the older society inclining to the aristocratic Federals, the younger to the Republicans, the democrats of that day. ... The students continuing to increase in number, they outran the constitutional limits of both societies, and a third, the Franklin Society, was established in 1824; it never had the vitality of the other two, however, and died after ten years."<ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], p. 181.</ref> Other nineteenth century clubs and societies, too numerous to treat here, are described in Bronson's history of the University.<ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 120, 147–148, 180–182, 239–244, 348–349 & 483–484.</ref>

[[File:BrownUniversity-Poster1914.jpg|thumb|right|160px|upright|The sesquicentennial poster]]
The Cammarian Club—founded in 1893 and taking its name from the Latin for lobster, its members' favorite dinner food—was at first a semi-secret society which "tapped" 15 seniors each year. In 1915, self-perpetuating membership gave way to popular election by the student body, and thenceforward the Club served as the ''de facto'' undergraduate student government. In 1971, unaccountably, it voted the name Cammarian Club out of existence, thereby amputating its tradition and longevity. The successor and present-day organization is the generically-named Undergraduate Council of Students.

[[Societas Domi Pacificae]], known colloquially as "Pacifica House," is a present-day, self-described secret society, which nonetheless publishes a website and an email address. It claims a continuous line of descent from the Franklin Society of 1824, citing a supposed intermediary "Franklin Society" traceable in the nineteenth century. But the intermediary turns out to be, on closer inspection, the well-known Providence Franklin Society, a civic organization unconnected to Brown whose origins and activity are well-documented. It was founded in 1821 by merchants William Grinnell and Joseph Balch, Jr., and chartered by the General Assembly in January 1823.<ref>Rhode Island Historical Society, "Providence Franklin Society Records, 1826-1922," published online at [http://www.rihs.org/mssinv/Mss162.htm]</ref> The "Pacifica House" account of this (conflated) Franklin Society cites published mentions of it in 1859, 1876, and 1883. But the first of these (Rhees 1859, see footnote ''infra'') is merely a sketch of the 1824 Brown organization; the second (Stockwell 1876) is a reference-book article on the Providence Franklin Society itself; and the third is the Providence Franklin Society's own publication, which the "Pacifica House" reference mis-ascribes to "Franklin Society," dropping the word "Providence."<ref>The three cited items of "evidence" in Pacifica House publicity are William J. Rhees, ''Manual of Public Libraries, Institutions and Societies in the United States'' (Philadelphia, 1859), pp. 437-8; Thomas B. Stockwell, ''A History of Public Education in Rhode Island, from 1636 to 1876'' (Providence, 1876), p. 246; and Providence Franklin Society, ''Report on the Geology of Rhode Island'' (Providence, 1887, commissioned 1883), for which see, e.g., ''Bulletin of the United States Geological Survey'', no. 127 (Washington, 1896), p. 821)</ref>

=== Resource centers ===
Brown University has several resource centers on campus. The centers often act as sources of support as well as safe spaces for students to explore certain aspects of their identity. Additionally, the centers often provide physical spaces for students to study and have meetings. Although most centers are identity-focused, some provide academic support as well.

[[File:BrownUniversity-PartridgeHall.jpg|thumb|left|The Brown Center for Students of Color]]

The [[Brown Center for Students of Color]] (BCSC) is a space that provides support for students [[People of color|of color]]. Established in 1972 at the demand of student protests, the BCSC encourages students to engage in critical dialogue, develop leadership skills, and promote [[social justice]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/students-of-color/about/frequently-asked-questions-faqs|website=Brown Center for Students of Color|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=November 17, 2014}}</ref> The center houses various programs for students to share their knowledge and engage in discussion.

The [[Sarah Doyle Women's Center]] aims to provide a space for members of the Brown community to examine and explore issues surrounding [[gender]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to the Sarah Doyle Women's Center|url=http://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/sarah-doyle-center/|website=Sarah Doyle Women's Center|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=November 26, 2014}}</ref> The center was named after one of the first women to attend Brown University, [[Sarah Doyle]].

=== Controversy Over ADA Mental Health Discrimination ===

Like many colleges, Brown mandates forced medical leaves for students expressing feelings of self-harm, depression, schizophrenia, or other forms of Mental Illness. Controversy arises within the college as to whether Brown follows the US Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, with Brown's own newspaper, The Brown Daily Herald, criticizing the University's policy behind readmission from psychological medical leave.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.browndailyherald.com/2012/09/19/newlon-145-a-pattern-of-prejudice/|title=Newlon '14.5: A pattern of prejudice|author=Cara Newlon|work=Brown Daily Herald|accessdate=July 24, 2015}}</ref> According to a 2010 article in The Brown Daily Herald, even Dean of Student Life & Chair of the Medical Leave Readmission Committee, Maria Suarez, admits that'“I wish we had more resources to connect with students,” Suarez said. “The support is there, but it is student-initiated.”'<ref name="crystalvanceguerra">{{cite web|url=http://www.browndailyherald.com/2010/09/27/psychological-leavetakers-miss-u-contact/|title=Psychological leave-takers miss U. contact|author=Crystal Vance Guerra|work=Brown Daily Herald|accessdate=July 24, 2015}}</ref> However, Suarez has been widely criticized within and outside the University as being non-compliant with American ADA laws, often denying students readmission for little to no reason.<ref name="caranewlon,usatodaycollege">{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2013/11/04/univ-medical-leaves-unhelpful/3359813/|title=Policies hamper students' return from mental health leave|author=Cara Newlon, USA TODAY College|date=November 4, 2013|work=USA TODAY|accessdate=July 24, 2015}}</ref> Moreover, the University leaves students with few guidelines on how to become readmitted; students report that very little communication is made with the University during a leave of absence, and that the University does not aid disabled students in their progress. One mentally disabled student alleges, after 5 semesters of mandatory leave, that: "One of the administrators [Suarez], he claims, told him: "You should consider yourself lucky because Brown's better than other schools. At least you're not getting kicked out of Brown."'<ref name="caranewlon,usatodaycollege"/> The psychological leave readmission process takes place once every 6 months, and requires only a student's statement and a psychiatrist's or psychologist's statement of well-being, with no interview. Many students report that the process is not through enough to judge one's own progress in mental health, thereby violating ADA rights; the denial letters are often short and generic, with one sentence changed at most for multiple denials.<ref name="crystalvanceguerra"/>
