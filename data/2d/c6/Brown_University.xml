The aim was to transform the traditional survey courseoften experienced passively by first-year studentsinto a more engaging process, an investigation of the intellectual and philosophical connections between disciplines. A grading option of Satisfactory/No Credit would be introduced to encourage students to try courses outside their grade-point comfort zone. In practice, this grading innovation of the New Curriculumsometimes misunderstood and mischaracterizedhas been its most successful component, responsible, in the decades since its adoption, for uncounted career-changing decisionsstudio art swapped for neuroscience, biology swapped for anthropology, mathematics swapped for playwriting (and<space/><link><target>Pulitzer Prize</target><trail>s</trail></link>).<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite encyclopedia</target><arg name="last">Mitchell

In 1799 a chapter of the Philandrian Society, also secret, was established at the College. In 1806 the United Brothers was formed as an egalitarian alternative to the Philermenian Society. &quot;These two great rivals,&quot; says the University historian, &quot;divided the student body between them for many years, surviving into the days of President Sears. A tincture of political controversy sharpened their rivalry, the older society inclining to the aristocratic Federals, the younger to the Republicans, the democrats of that day. ... The students continuing to increase in number, they outran the constitutional limits of both societies, and a third, the Franklin Society, was established in 1824; it never had the vitality of the other two, however, and died after ten years.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'><link><target>#Bronson</target><part>Bronson (1914)</part></link>, p. 181.</extension><space/>Other nineteenth century clubs and societies, too numerous to treat here, are described in Bronson's history of the University.<extension extension_name='ref'><link><target>#Bronson</target><part>Bronson (1914)</part></link>, pp. 120, 147148, 180182, 239244, 348349 &amp; 483484.</extension></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:BrownUniversity-Poster1914.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>160px</part><part>upright</part><part>The sesquicentennial poster</part></link>The Cammarian Clubfounded in 1893 and taking its name from the Latin for lobster, its members' favorite dinner foodwas at first a semi-secret society which &quot;tapped&quot; 15 seniors each year.

But the intermediary turns out to be, on closer inspection, the well-known Providence Franklin Society, a civic organization unconnected to Brown whose origins and activity are well-documented.
