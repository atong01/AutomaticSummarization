'''Daniel Robert''' "'''Danny'''" '''Elfman''' (born May 29, 1953)<ref name=FamilySearch-CABirth-1953>{{cite web|title=Daniel Robert Elfman - California, Birth Index|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:VGF4-PPS|website=[[FamilySearch]]|accessdate=24 December 2014}}</ref> is an American composer, singer, songwriter, and record producer. He is known as the lead singer and songwriter for the rock band [[Oingo Boingo]], from 1976 to 1995 and later for scoring music for television and film and creating [[The Simpsons Theme|''The Simpsons'' main title theme]] as well as the [[Batman (1989 film)|1989 ''Batman'' film]] theme. He has scored the majority of his long-time friend [[Tim Burton]]'s films.

Elfman re-entered the film industry in 1976, initially as an actor. He made his film scoring debut in 1982 for the film ''[[Forbidden Zone]]'' directed by his older brother [[Richard Elfman]]. He has since been nominated for four [[Academy Award]]s and won a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] for Best Instrumental Composition Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media for Tim Burton's ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096895/awards|title=Batman (1989) Awards, IMDB.com |accessdate=27 September 2012}}</ref> and an [[Emmy Award]] for his ''[[Desperate Housewives]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/234561|title=Composer Danny Elfman Scores First Emmy Award}}</ref> theme. Elfman was honored with the Richard Kirk Award at the 2002 [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] Film and TV Awards; the award is given annually to a composer who has made significant contributions to film and television music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/233117|title= Top Film, TV, Cable Composers Honored at BMI's Annual Film/TV Awards|publisher=bmi.com|accessdate=2010-10-28}}</ref> He was also inducted as a [[Disney Legends|Disney Legend]] in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lincoln|first=Ross|title=George Lucas, Danny Elfman, Others To Be Honored At D23 2015|url=http://deadline.com/2015/07/george-lucas-others-to-be-named-disney-legend-at-d23-2015-1201475685/|publisher=Deadline|date=July 14, 2015|accessdate=August 4, 2015}}</ref>

==Early life and career==
Danny Elfman was born in Los Angeles, California, into a Jewish family.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/node/28977 |title=Interview: Danny Elfman &#124; The Jewish Chronicle |publisher=Thejc.com |date=2010-03-04 |accessdate=2014-08-26}}</ref> He is the son of [[Blossom Elfman]] ([[married and maiden names|née]] Bernstein), a writer and teacher, and Milton Elfman, a teacher who was in the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/34/Danny-Elfman.html|title=Danny Elfman profile at FilmReference.com|publisher=Filmreference.com|accessdate=2011-01-02}}</ref> He was raised in a racially mixed community in the [[Baldwin Hills, Los Angeles|Baldwin Hills]] area of Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elfman.filmmusic.com/elfman_la_times.html|title=Elfman in L.A.|publisher=Elfman.filmmusic.com|accessdate=2011-01-02}}</ref> He spent much of his time in the local movie theatre, adoring the music of such film composers as [[Bernard Herrmann]] and [[Franz Waxman]]. Stating that he hung out with the "band geeks" in high school, he started a [[ska]] band. After dropping out of high school, he followed his brother [[Richard Elfman|Richard]] to [[France]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzine.com/2008/05/oingo-boingo|title=Buzzine|publisher=Buzzine|date=2009-05-07|accessdate=2011-01-02}}</ref> where he performed with Le Grand Magic Circus, an [[avant-garde]] musical theater group. Violin in tow, Elfman next journeyed to [[Africa]] where he traveled through [[Ghana]], [[Mali]], and [[Republic of Upper Volta|Upper Volta]], absorbing new musical styles, including the Ghanaian [[highlife]] genre which would eventually influence his own music. {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

He contracted [[malaria]] during his one-year stay and was often sick. Eventually he returned home to the United States, where he began to take Balinese music lessons at [[California Institute of the Arts|CalArts]]. During this time, he was romantically involved with [[Kim Gordon]], who would later go on to form [[Sonic Youth]]. He was never officially a student at the institute; nonetheless, the instructor encouraged him to continue learning. Elfman stated, "He just laughed, and said, 'Sit. Play.' I continued to sit and play for a couple years."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boingo.org/articles/VideoEntertainment.html|title=Video Entertainment Magazine interview, April 4, 1996|publisher=Boingo.org|date=1996-04-04|accessdate=2011-01-02}}</ref> At this time, his brother was forming a new musical theater group.

==Oingo Boingo==
{{Main|Oingo Boingo}}
In 1972 Richard Elfman founded the American [[New wave music|new wave]] band/[[performance art]] group, originally called '''The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo'''. They played several shows throughout the 1970s until Richard Elfman left the band to become a filmmaker. As a send-off to the band's original concept, Richard Elfman created the film ''[[Forbidden Zone]]'' based on their stage performances. Danny Elfman composed his first score for the film and played the role of [[Satan]] (the other band members played his minions). By the time the movie was completed, they had taken the name [[Oingo Boingo]] and begun recording and touring as a rock group. From 1976 and on, it was led by Danny Elfman, until 1995 when they suddenly retired. The semi-theatrical music and comedy troupe had transformed into a [[ska]]-influenced new wave band in 1979, and then changed again towards a more guitar-oriented [[Rock music|rock]] sound, in the late 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}.  Oingo Boingo, still led by Danny Elfman, performed as themselves in the 1986 movie [[Back to School]]. Additionally, Danny Elfman and Oingo Bongo guitarist Steve Bartek reunited on October 31, 2015 to perform the song "Dead Man's Party" during an encore at a Halloween celebration at the Hollywood Bowl "for the first time in 20 years to the day," as Elfman said to the audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/11/01/danny-elfman-dead-mans-party}}</ref>

==Elfman and Tim Burton==
In 1985, [[Tim Burton]] and [[Paul Reubens]] invited Elfman to write the [[Film score|score]] for their first feature film, ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]''. Elfman was apprehensive at first because of his lack of formal training, but with orchestration assistance from Oingo Boingo guitarist and arranger [[Steve Bartek]], he achieved his goal of emulating the mood of such composers as [[Nino Rota]] and [[Bernard Herrmann]].<ref name="multiple">{{cite web|url=http://www.boingo.org/articles/FanfareArticle.html|title=Fanfare Article|publisher=Boingo.org|accessdate=2011-01-02}}</ref> In the booklet for the first volume of ''Music for a Darkened Theatre'', Elfman described the first time he heard his music played by a full [[orchestra]] as one of the most thrilling experiences of his life. Elfman immediately developed a rapport with Burton<ref name="multiple"/> and has gone on to score all but two of Burton's major studio releases: ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'' which was under production while Elfman and Burton were having a serious disagreement,<ref name=Danny>Salisbury, Burton, pp.137-144</ref> and ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd]]''. Elfman also provided the singing voice for [[Jack Skellington]] in Tim Burton's ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' and the voices of both Barrel and the "Clown with the Tear-Away Face". Years later he provided the voice for Bonejangles the skeleton in ''[[Corpse Bride]]''.

Burton has said of his relationship with Elfman: "We don't even have to talk about the music. We don't even have to intellectualize – which is good for both of us, we're both similar that way. We're very lucky to connect" (Breskin, 1997).

==Musical influences==
Modern classicist composers, including [[Béla Bartók]], [[Philip Glass]], [[Lou Harrison]], [[Carl Orff]], [[Harry Partch]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Maurice Ravel]], [[Erik Satie]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]] have influenced the style of Elfman's music.<ref name="americancomposers">{{cite web|url=http://www.americancomposers.org/elfman_interview.htm|title=An interview with composer Danny Elfman|publisher=American Composers|first=Jessica|last=Lustig|accessdate=May 7, 2012}}</ref> Elfman cited his first time noticing film music being when he heard [[Bernard Hermann]]'s score to ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' as an eleven-year-old and being a fan of film music since then. Other influences based in film music include [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]], [[Max Steiner]], [[David Tamkin]], and [[Franz Waxman]].<ref name="americancomposers"/><ref name="artistdirect"/> Also, [[Nino Rota]] served as a significant influence and was the main inspiration for Elfman's score to ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]''.<ref name="artistdirect">{{cite web |url=http://www.artistdirect.com/entertainment-news/article/danny-elfman-talks-tim-burton-scores-bernard-herrmann-s-influence-and-more/8196173|title=Danny Elfman Talks Tim Burton Scores, Bernard Hermann's Influence and More|publisher=ARTIST direct|date=December 14, 2010|first=Rick|last=Florino|accessdate=May 7, 2012}}</ref>

==Recent works==
Elfman recently composed the music for the [[Cirque du Soleil]] Show [[Iris (Cirque du Soleil)|Iris]], which was performed at the [[Dolby Theatre]] in Hollywood. The production began on July 21, 2011, and ended on January 19, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/en/past/shows/iris/default.aspx|title=Cirque du Soleil website|accessdate=2014-04-08}}</ref> This is Elfman's most significant non-film work since he composed ''[[Serenada Schizophrana]]'' for the [[American Composers Orchestra]]. It was conducted by [[John Mauceri]] on its recording and by Steven Sloane at its premiere at [[Carnegie Hall]] in [[New York City]] on February 23, 2005. After its premiere, it was recorded in studio and released onto [[Super Audio CD|SACD]] on October 3, 2006. The meeting with Mauceri proved fruitful as the composer was encouraged then to write a new concert piece for Mauceri and the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra. Elfman composed an "overture to a non-existent musical" and called the piece "The Overeager Overture". He also continues to compose his film scores in addition to these other projects. In November 2010, it was reported that Danny Elfman is writing the music for a planned musical based on the life of [[Harry Houdini]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Vozick-Levinson|first=Simon|title=Aaron Sorkin writing Hugh Jackman's Houdini musical: Composer Danny Elfman has 'high hopes'|work=Popwatch.EW.com|date=November 2, 2010|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/11/02/hugh-jackman-houdini-musical|accessdate=December 4, 2010}}</ref> But, as of January 2012, he was no longer attached to the project.<ref>{{cite web|last=Potts|first=Kimberly|title=Hugh Jackman, Aaron Sorkin Teaming for 'Houdini' musical|work=thewrap.com|date=January 4, 2012|url=http://www.thewrap.com/media/article/hugh-jackman-aaron-sorkin-teaming-houdini-musical-34065}}</ref>

In October 2013, Elfman returned to the stage to sing his vocal parts to a handful of ''Nightmare Before Christmas'' songs as part of a concert titled ''Danny Elfman's Music from the Films of Tim Burton''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ng|first=David|title=Danny Elfman concert of Tim Burton film music adds third performance|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-danny-elfman-tim-burton-third-concert-20130918,0,701643.story|accessdate=October 10, 2013|newspaper=September 18, 2013|date=September 18, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Danny Elfman's Music from the Films of Tim Burton|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/orchestras/events/1392|publisher=BBC Concert Orchestra|accessdate=October 10, 2013}}</ref> He composed the film score for ''[[Oz the Great and Powerful]]'' (2013), and composed additional music for ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015).

==Personal life==
Elfman has three children: Lola (born 1979), Mali (born 1984), and Oliver (born 2005). On November 29, 2003, he married actress [[Bridget Fonda]]. In 1997, he scored ''[[A Simple Plan (film)|A Simple Plan]]'', his only score for one of her films to date (although he did compose a cue for the film ''[[Army of Darkness]]'', in which Fonda has a cameo). In the late 1960s and early 1970s, he dated [[Sonic Youth]]'s [[Kim Gordon]].

He is the uncle of actor [[Bodhi Elfman]], who is married to actress [[Jenna Elfman]].

Describing his politics during the 1980s, Elfman said, "I'm not a doomist. My attitude is always to be critical of what's around you, but not ever to forget how lucky we are. I've traveled around the world. I left thinking I was a revolutionary. I came back real [[right-wing]] patriotic. Since then, I've kind of mellowed in between."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boingo.org/articles/Encyclopedia.html |title=Encyclopedia of Pop, Rock and Soul |publisher=Boingo.org |date=1955-05-29 |accessdate=2013-02-02}}</ref> In 2008, he expressed support for [[Barack Obama]] and said that [[Sarah Palin]] was his "worst nightmare".<ref>{{cite news|title=Battling Our Greatest Fear|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/danny-elfman/battling-our-greatest-fea_b_139246.html|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=2008-10-30}}</ref>
===Hearing damage===
When asked during a 2007 phone-in interview on [[XETRA-FM]] if he ever had any notions of performing in an [[Oingo Boingo]] reunion, Elfman immediately rejected the idea and stated that in the last few years with the band he had begun to develop significant and irreversible [[hearing impairment|hearing damage]] as a result of his continuous exposure to the high noise levels involved in performing in a [[rock music|rock]] band. He went on to say that he believes his hearing damage is partially due to a [[Genetics|genetic]] predisposition to hearing loss, and that he will never return to the stage for fear of worsening not only his condition but also that of his band mates. 

However, Elfman did indeed return to the stage at the Hollywood Bowl on October 31, 2015 to perform Dead Man's Party as the encore to an evening featuring the full length score and performances from Nightmare Before Christmas. <ref>{{Cite web|title = Watch: Danny Elfman Plays Oingo Boingo’s ‘Dead Man’s Party’ for First Time in 20 Years {{!}}|url = http://www.rockcellarmagazine.com/2015/11/01/danny-elfman-dead-mans-party-performance-hollywood-bowl-watch-video-oingo-boingo/|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}</ref> <!-- see talk page -->
