It was at<space/><link><target>Chalcedon</target></link><space/>that the emperor, through the Imperial delegates, enforced harsh disciplinary measures against Pope Dioscorus in response to his boldness. In 449, Pope Dioscorus headed the 2nd Council of Ephesus, called the &quot;<link><target>Robber Council</target></link>&quot; by Chalcedonian historians.

So, due to the above-mentioned, especially in the consecutive sequences of events, the Hierarchs of Alexandria were considered holding too much of power from one hand, and on the other hand, due to the conflict of the Schools of Theology, there would be an impasse and a scapegoat, i.e. Pope Dioscorus. The Tome of Leo has been widely criticized (surprisingly by Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox scholars) in the past 50 years as a much less than perfect orthodox theological doctrine.</paragraph><paragraph>It is also to be noted that by anathemizing Pope Leo because of the tone and content of his tome, as per Alexandrine Theology perception, Pope Dioscorus was found guilty of doing so without due process; in other words, the Tome of Leo was not a subject of heresy in the first place, but it was a question of questioning the reasons behind not having it either acknowledged or read at the<space/><link><target>Second Council of Ephesus</target></link><space/>in AD 449. Pope Dioscorus of Alexandria was never labeled as heretic by the council's canons.</paragraph><paragraph>Copts also believe that the Pope of Alexandria was forcibly prevented from attending the third congregation of the council from which he was ousted, apparently the result of a conspiracy tailored by the Roman delegates.<extension extension_name='ref'>Romanides, John S.<space/><link type='external' href='http://www.romanity.org/htm/rom.06.en.orthodox_and_oriental_orthodox_consultation.htm'>Leo of Rome's Support of Theodoret</link>.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Before the current positive era of Eastern and Oriental Orthodox dialogues, Chalcedonians sometimes used to call the non-Chalcedonians &quot;<link><target>Monophysitism</target><part>monophysites</part></link>&quot;, though the Coptic Orthodox Church in reality regards monophysitism as a heresy.

Christianity became a national religion of Ethiopia, under the dominion of the Church of Alexandria, in the 4th century.

On 13 July 1948, the Coptic Church of Alexandria and the<space/><link><target>Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido Church</target></link><space/>reached an agreement concerning the relationship between the two churches. In 1950, the<space/><link><target>Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido Church</target></link><space/>was granted autocephaly by<space/><link><target>Pope Joseph II of Alexandria</target></link>, head of the Coptic Orthodox Church. Five Ethiopian bishops were immediately consecrated by the Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of All Africa, and were empowered to elect a new Patriarch for their church. This promotion was completed when Joseph II consecrated the first Ethiopian-born Archbishop,<space/><link><target>Abuna Basilios</target></link>, as head of the Ethiopian Church on 14 January 1951.

With the fall of Emperor<space/><link><target>Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia</target></link><space/>in 1974, the new Marxist government arrested Abuna Theophilos and secretly executed him in 1979. The Ethiopian government then ordered the Ethiopian Church to elect<space/><link><target>Abuna Takla Haymanot</target></link><space/>as Patriarch of Ethiopia. The Coptic Orthodox Church refused to recognize the election and enthronement of Abuna Takla Haymanot on the grounds that the Synod of the Ethiopian Church had not removed Abuna Theophilos, and that the Ethiopian government had not publicly acknowledged his death, and he was thus still legitimate Patriarch of Ethiopia. Formal relations between the two churches were halted, although they remained in communion with each other.</paragraph><paragraph>After the death of Abuna Takla Haymanot in 1988,<space/><link><target>Abune Merkorios</target></link><space/>who had close ties to the<space/><link><target>Derg</target></link><space/>(Communist) government was elected Patriarch of Ethiopia.
