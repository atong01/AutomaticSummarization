In [[navy|naval]] terminology, a '''destroyer''' is a fast maneuverable long-endurance [[warship]] intended to escort larger vessels in a [[Naval fleet|fleet]], [[convoy]] or [[Carrier battle group|battle group]] and defend them against smaller powerful short-range attackers. They were originally developed in the late 19th century as a defence against [[torpedo boat]]s, and by the time of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1904, these "torpedo boat destroyers" (TBD) were "large, swift, and powerfully armed torpedo boats designed to destroy other torpedo boats."<ref>Gove p. 2412</ref> Although the term "destroyer" had been used interchangeably with "TBD" and "torpedo boat destroyer" by navies since 1892, the term "torpedo boat destroyer" had been generally shortened to simply "destroyer" by nearly all navies by the [[First World War]].<ref>Lyon p. 8, 9</ref>

Before [[World War II]], destroyers were light vessels with little endurance for unattended ocean operations; typically a number of destroyers and a single [[destroyer tender]] operated together. After the war, the advent of the guided missile allowed destroyers to take on the surface combatant roles previously filled by battleships and cruisers. This resulted in larger and more powerful [[guided missile destroyer]]s more capable of independent operation.

At the start of the 21st century, destroyers are the heaviest [[surface combatant]] ships in general use, with only three nations (including the [[United States Navy|United States]], [[Russian Navy|Russia]], and [[Peruvian Navy|Peru]]) operating the heavier class [[cruiser]]s, with no [[battleship]]s or true [[battlecruiser]]s remaining.<ref>Although the Russian {{sclass-|Kirov|battlecruiser|4}} are sometimes classified as battlecruisers, due to their displacement they are described by Russia as large missile cruisers.</ref> Modern destroyers, also known as [[guided missile destroyer]]s, are equivalent in [[tonnage]] but vastly superior in firepower to cruisers of the World War II era, capable of carrying [[nuclear missile|nuclear tipped]] [[cruise missile]]s. Guided missile destroyers such as the [[Arleigh Burke-class destroyer|''Arleigh Burke'' class]] are actually larger and more heavily armed than most previous ships classified as guided missile cruisers, due to their massive size at {{convert|510|ft|m}} long, displacement (9200&nbsp;tons) and armament of over 90 missiles.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120301123441/http://www.armybase.us/2010/04/northrop-grumman-christened-its-28th-aegis-guided-missile-destroyer-william-p-lawrence-ddg-110/ Northrop Grumman christened its 28th Aegis guided missile destroyer, William P.

The emergence and development of the destroyer was related to the invention of the self-propelled [[torpedo]] in the 1860s. A navy now had the potential to destroy a superior enemy battle fleet using steam launches to launch torpedoes. Fast boats armed with torpedoes were built and called [[torpedo boat]]s. The first seagoing vessel designed to fire the self-propelled [[Torpedo#Self-propelled torpedoes|Whitehead torpedo]] was the 33-ton {{HMS|Lightning|1876|6}} in 1876. She was armed with two drop collars to launch these weapons; these were replaced in 1879 by a single torpedo tube in the bow. By the 1880s, the type had evolved into small ships of 50–100 tons, fast enough to evade enemy picket boats.

At first, the danger to a battle fleet was considered to exist only when at anchor, but as faster and longer-range torpedoes were developed, the threat extended to cruising at sea. In response to this new threat, more heavily gunned picket boats called "catchers" were built which were used to escort the battle fleet at sea. They needed significant seaworthiness and endurance to operate with the battle fleet, and as they necessarily became larger, they became officially designated "torpedo boat destroyers", and by the First World War were largely known as "destroyers" in English. The anti-torpedo boat origin of this type of ship is retained in its name in other languages, including [[French language|French]] (''contre-torpilleur''), [[Italian language|Italian]] (''cacciatorpediniere''), [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (''contratorpedeiro''), [[Czech language|Czech]] (''torpédoborec''), [[Greek language|Greek]] (''antitorpiliko'',''αντιτορπιλικό''), and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] (''torpedobootjager'').<ref>Lyon p.  8</ref>

Once destroyers became more than just catchers guarding an anchorage, it was realized that they were also ideal to take over the role of torpedo boats themselves, so they were fitted with torpedo tubes as well as guns. At that time, and even into [[World War I]], the only function of destroyers was to protect their own battle fleet from enemy torpedo attacks and to make such attacks on the battleships of the enemy. The task of escorting merchant convoys was still in the future.

=== Early designs ===
[[File:Kotaka.jpg|thumb|230px|The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s ''Kotaka'' (1887)]]
An important development came with the construction of HMS ''Swift'' in 1884, later redesignated TB 81.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.battleships-cruisers.co.uk/torpedo_boats.htm |title=Torpedo Boats |publisher=Battleships-Cruisers.co.uk}}</ref> This was a large (137 ton) torpedo boat with four [[QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss|47&nbsp;mm quick-firing guns]] and three torpedo tubes. At {{convert|23.75|kn|lk=in}}, while still not fast enough to engage torpedo boats reliably, the ship at least had the armament to deal with them.

Another forerunner of the torpedo boat destroyer was the Japanese ''torpedo boat''<ref>Jentschura p. 126</ref> {{ship|Japanese warship|Kotaka||2}} (''Falcon''), built in 1885.<ref>{{cite book |last=Evans and Peattie |first=David C. and Mark R. |title=''Kaigun: Strategy, Tactics, and Technology in the Imperial Japanese Navy, 1887–1941'' |year=1997 |publisher=[[Naval Institute Press]] |location=Annapolis, Maryland  |isbn=0-87021-192-7}}</ref> Designed to Japanese specifications and ordered from the London [[Yarrow shipyards]] in 1885, she was transported in parts to Japan, where she was assembled and launched in 1887.

In her trials in 1889, ''Kotaka'' demonstrated that she could exceed the role of coastal defense, and was capable of accompanying larger warships on the high seas. The Yarrow shipyards, builder of the parts for the ''Kotaka'', "considered Japan to have effectively invented the destroyer".<ref>{{cite book |last=Howe |first=Christopher |title=''The Origins of Japanese Trade Supremacy: Development and Technology in Asia from 1540 to the Pacific War'' |year=1996 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, Illinois |isbn=0-226-35485-7}}</ref>

=== Torpedo gunboat ===
{{Main|Torpedo gunboat}}
[[File:HMS Spider.png|thumb|HMS ''Spider'', an early model of torpedo gunboat]]
The first vessel designed for the explicit purpose of hunting and destroying torpedo boats was the [[torpedo gunboat]]. Essentially very small [[cruiser]]s, torpedo gunboats were equipped with torpedo tubes and an adequate gun armament, intended for hunting down smaller enemy boats. By the end of the 1890s torpedo gunboats were made obsolete by their more successful contemporaries, the [[torpedo boat destroyers]], which were much faster.

The first example of this was {{HMS|Rattlesnake|1886|6}}, designed by [[Nathaniel Barnaby]] in 1885, and commissioned in response to the [[Panjdeh Incident|Russian War scare]].<ref name="L&W">{{cite book |last=Lyon & Winfield |title=The Sail and Steam Navy List|chapter=10|pages=82–3}}</ref> The gunboat was armed with torpedoes and designed for hunting and destroying smaller [[torpedo boat]]s. Exactly {{convert|200|ft|m}} long and {{convert|23|ft|m}} in beam, she displaced 550 tons. Built of steel, ''Rattlesnake'' was un-armoured with the exception of a {{fraction|3|4}}-inch protective deck. She was armed with a single [[BL 4 inch naval gun Mk I – VI|4-inch/25-pounder breech-loading gun]], six [[QF 3 pounder Hotchkiss|3-pounder QF guns]] and four {{convert|14|in|mm|adj=on}} torpedo tubes, arranged with two fixed tubes at the bow and a set of torpedo dropping carriages on either side. Four torpedo reloads were carried.<ref name="L&W" />

A number of torpedo gunboat classes followed, including the ''Grasshopper'' class, the {{sclass-|Sharpshooter|torpedo gunboat|4}}, the {{sclass-|Alarm |torpedo gunboat|4}} and the {{sclass-|Dryad|torpedo gunboat|4}} - all built for the [[Royal Navy]] during the 1880s and the 1890s.

[[Fernando Villaamil]], second officer of the Ministry of the [[Spanish Navy|Navy of Spain]], designed his own torpedo gunboat to combat the threat from the torpedo boat.<ref>[http://www.spanamwar.com/Vilamil.htm#prof Biography of Villaamil]</ref> He asked several British shipyards to submit proposals capable of fulfilling these specifications. In 1885 the Spanish Navy chose the design submitted by the shipyard of James and George Thomson of [[Clydebank]], near the [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrow]] shipyards. {{ship|Spanish warship|Destructor|1886|2}} (''Destroyer'' in Spanish) was laid down at the end of the year, launched in 1886, and commissioned in 1887.

She displaced 348 tons, and was equipped with [[triple-expansion engine]]s generating {{convert|3784|ihp|0|abbr=on}}, for a maximum speed of {{convert|22.6|kn|km/h}},<ref name=dest>[http://sites.google.com/site/rlmbuquesdeguerra/contratorpedero-destructor#prof ''Contratorpedero Destructor''] {{es}}</ref> which made her one of the faster ships in the world in 1888.<ref>Illustrated Naval and Military Magazine: A monthly journal devoted to all subjects connected with Her Majesty's land and sea forces, 1888, v 9, page 280</ref> She was armed with one {{convert|90|mm|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} Spanish-designed [[Hontoria]] [[Breech-loading weapon|breech-loading]] gun,<ref name=Bernie>Fitzsimmons, Bernard: ''The Illustrated encyclopedia of 20th century weapons and warfare.''

In terms of gunnery, speed and dimensions, the specialised design to chase torpedo boats and her high seas capabilities, ''Destructor'' was an important precursor to the torpedo boat destroyer.<ref>[http://www.quarterdeck.org/100th/DDs.htm#prof From an article about the American ''Greyhounds'']</ref>

The torpedo gunboats in practice failed in their primary objective, as they were not fast enough to keep up with torpedo boats. They were phased out with the introduction of the first destroyers in the 1890s.

== Development of the modern destroyer ==
[[File:HMS Havock (1893).jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Havock|1893|6}} the first modern destroyer, commissioned in 1894]]
The first ships to bear the formal designation "torpedo boat destroyer" (TBD) were the {{sclass-|Daring|destroyer (1893)|4}} of two ships and {{sclass-|Havock|destroyer|4}} of two ships of the [[Royal Navy]].

Early [[torpedo gunboat]] designs lacked the range and speed to keep up with the fleet they were supposed to protect. In 1892, the [[Third Sea Lord]], [[Rear Admiral]] [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Jackie Fisher]] ordered the development of a new type of ships equipped with the then novel [[water-tube boiler]]s and [[British ordnance terms#QF|quick-firing]] small calibre guns. Six ships to the specifications circulated by the Admiralty were ordered initially, comprising three different designs each produced by a different shipbuilder: {{HMS|Daring|1893|6}} and {{HMS|Decoy|1894|6}} from [[John I. Thornycroft & Company]], {{HMS|Havock|1893|6}} and {{HMS|Hornet|1893|6}} from [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrows]], and {{HMS|Ferret|1893|6}} and {{HMS|Lynx|1894|6}} from [[Cammell Laird|Laird, Son & Company]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The British Destroyer|author=Captain T.D. Manning|publisher=Putnam and Co|year=1961}}</ref>

These torpedo boat destroyers all featured a turtleback (i.e. rounded) [[forecastle]] that was characteristic of early British TBDs. {{HMS|Daring|1893|6}} and {{HMS|Decoy|1894|6}} were both built by [[Thornycroft]], displaced 260 tons (287.8 tons full load) and were 185 feet in length. They were armed with one [[QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun|12-pounder gun]] and three 6-pounder guns, with one fixed 18-in torpedo tube in the bow plus two more torpedo tubes on a revolving mount abaft the two funnels. Later the bow torpedo tube was removed and two more 6-pounder guns added instead. They produced 4,200&nbsp;hp from a pair of Thornycroft water-tube boilers, giving them a top speed of 27 knots, giving the range and speed to travel effectively with a battle fleet. In common with subsequent early Thornycroft boats, they had sloping sterns and double rudders.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lyon|first=David|title=The First Destroyers|year=1996|isbn=1-84067-364-8}}</ref>

The French navy, an extensive user of torpedo boats, built its first torpedo boat destroyer in 1899, with the {{sclass-|Durandal|destroyer|0}} 'torpilleur d'escadre'. The [[United States]] commissioned its first torpedo boat destroyer, {{USS|Bainbridge|DD-1|6}}, Destroyer No. 1, in 1902 and by 1906 there were 16 destroyers in service with the US Navy.<ref>Simpson p. 151</ref>

=== Subsequent improvements ===
[[File:Yarrow plan.png|thumb|right|Builders' plans for the British {{sclass-|Charger|destroyer|4}}, built 1894-5.]]
Torpedo Boat Destroyer designs continued to evolve around the turn of the 20th century in several key ways. The first was the introduction of the [[steam turbine]]. The spectacular unauthorized demonstration of the turbine powered ''[[Turbinia]]'' at the 1897 Spithead Navy Review, which, significantly, was of torpedo boat size, prompted the Royal Navy to order a prototype turbine powered destroyer, {{HMS|Viper|1899|6}} of 1899. This was the first turbine warship of any kind and achieved a remarkable {{convert|36|kn|km/h|0}} on sea trials. By 1910 the turbine had been widely adopted by all navies for their faster ships.

The second development was the replacement of the torpedo-boat-style turtleback foredeck by a raised [[forecastle]] for the new {{sclass2-|River|destroyer|2}}s built in 1903, which provided better sea-keeping as well as more space below deck.

The British experimented with oil propulsion for the {{sclass2-|Tribal|destroyer (1905)|4}} of 1905 but switched temporarily back to coal for the later {{sclass-|Beagle|destroyer|4}} in 1909. Other navies also adopted oil, for instance the USN with the {{sclass-|Paulding|destroyer|4}} of 1909.
In spite of all this variety, destroyers adopted a largely similar pattern. The hull was long and narrow, with a relatively shallow draft. The bow was either raised in a forecastle or covered under a turtleback; underneath this were the crew spaces, extending 1/4 to 1/3 the way along the hull. Aft of the crew spaces was as much engine space as the technology of the time would allow: several boilers and engines or turbines. Above deck, one or more quick-firing guns were mounted in the bows, in front of the bridge; several more were mounted amidships and astern. Two tube mountings (later on, multiple mountings) were generally found amidships.

Between 1892 and 1914 destroyers became markedly larger: initially 420&nbsp;tons with a length of {{convert|250|ft|m}} for the US Navy's first {{sclass-|Bainbridge|destroyer|4}} of torpedo boat destroyers,<ref>Lyon p. 121</ref> up to the First World War with {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=on}} long destroyers displacing 1000&nbsp;tons was not unusual. However, construction remained focused on putting the biggest possible engines into a small hull, resulting in a somewhat flimsy construction. Often hulls were built of steel only 1/8&nbsp;in thick.

By 1910 the steam-driven displacement (that is, not [[Planing (sailing)|hydroplaning]]) torpedo boat had become redundant as a separate type. Germany nevertheless continued to build such boats until the end of World War I, although these were effectively small coastal destroyers. In fact Germany never distinguished between the two types, giving them pennant numbers in the same series and never giving names to destroyers. Ultimately the term ''torpedo boat'' came to be attached to a quite different vessel – the very fast hydroplaning motor driven [[Motor Torpedo Boat|MTB]].

== Early use and World War I ==
The torpedo boat destroyer's initial purpose was to protect against torpedo boats, but navies soon appreciated the flexibility of the fast, multi-purpose vessel that resulted. Vice-Admiral Sir Baldwin Walker laid down destroyer duties for the Royal Navy:<ref>Brett, Bernard: "History of World Sea Power", Deans International (London) 1985. ISBN 0-603-03723-2</ref>

Early destroyers were extremely cramped places to live, being "without a doubt magnificent fighting vessels... but unable to stand bad weather."<ref>Grant p. 136</ref> During the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1904, the commander of the torpedo boat destroyer IJN ''Akatsuki''<ref>Grant, image, frontispiece</ref><ref>Lyon p. 58</ref><ref>Jentschura p. 132 (''Akatsuki'' built by ''Yarrow & Co.'' in 1902; 224' long, displaced 415 tons, two 18" , two 3" guns, four 57&nbsp;mm Quick Firing Guns, complement 60 officers/men. Sunk by mine at ''Port Arthur'' on 17 May 1904)</ref> described "being in command of a destroyer for a long period, especially in wartime... is not very good for the health." Stating that he had originally been strong and healthy, he continued, "life on a destroyer in winter, with bad food, no comforts, would sap the powers of the strongest men in the long run. A ''destroyer'' is always more uncomfortable than the others, and rain, snow, and ''sea-water'' combine to make them damp; in fact, in bad weather there is not a dry spot where one can rest for a moment."<ref name="Grant">Grant p. 102, 103</ref>

The Japanese destroyer commander finished with, "Yesterday I looked at myself in a mirror for a long time; I was disagreeably surprised to see my face thin, full of wrinkles, and as old as though I were fifty. My clothes (uniform) cover nothing but a skeleton, and my bones are full of [[rheumatism]]."<ref name="Grant" />

Although officially classified as a ''torpedo boat'' in 1898 by the US Navy, {{USS|Porter|TB-6|6}}, a {{convert|175|ft|m|adj=on}} long all steel vessel displacing 165 tons, was described by her commander, LT. John C. Fremont, as "...a compact mass of machinery not meant to keep the sea nor to live in... as five sevenths of the ship are taken up by machinery and fuel, whilst the remaining two sevenths, fore and aft, are the crew's quarters; officers forward and the men placed aft. And even in those spaces are placed anchor engines, steering engines, steam pipes, etc. rendering them unbearably hot in tropical regions."<ref>Simpson p. 100</ref>

=== Combat ===
[[File:HMS Loyal (1913) IWM SP 001136.jpg|300px|thumb|{{HMS|Loyal|1913|6}}, of the {{sclass-|Laforey|destroyer (1913)|4}}.]]
The torpedo boat destroyer's first major use in combat came during the Japanese surprise attack on the Russian fleet anchored in [[Battle of Port Arthur|Port Arthur]] at the opening of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] on 8 February 1904.

Three destroyer divisions attacked the Russian fleet in port, firing a total of 18 torpedoes. However, only two Russian battleships were seriously damaged due to the proper deployment of torpedo nets. The Russian flagship, the battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Tsesarevich||2}}, which had her nets deployed, had at least four enemy torpedoes "hung up" in them,<ref>Grant p. 42</ref> other warships were similarly saved from further damage by the Russian navy's proper use of [[torpedo nets]].<ref>Grant p. 33, 34, 40</ref>

While capital ship engagements were scarce in World War I, destroyer units were almost continually engaged in raiding and patrol actions. The first shot of the war at sea was fired on 5 August 1914 by a destroyer of the 2nd Flotilla, {{HMS|Lance|1914|6}}, in an engagement with the German auxiliary [[minelayer]] {{SS|Königin Luise|1913|6}}.

Destroyers were involved in the skirmishes that prompted the [[Battle of Heligoland (1914)|Battle of Heligoland Bight]], and filled a range of roles in the [[Battle of Gallipoli]], acting as troop’s transports and fire support vessels, as well as their fleet-screening role. Over 80 British destroyers and 60 German torpedo-boats took part in the [[Battle of Jutland]], which involved pitched small-boat actions between the main fleets, and several foolhardy attacks by unsupported destroyers on capital ships. Jutland also concluded with a messy night action between the German [[High Seas Fleet]] and part of the British destroyer screen.

[[File:Wickes dd75.jpg|thumb|left|{{USS|Wickes|DD-75|6}}, a {{sclass-|Wickes|destroyer|2}}]]
The threat evolved by [[World War I]] with the development of the [[submarine]], or [[U-boat]]. The submarine had the potential to hide from gunfire and close underwater to fire torpedoes. Early-war destroyers had the speed and armament to intercept submarines before they submerged, either by gunfire or by ramming. Destroyers also had a shallow enough draft that torpedoes would find it difficult to hit them.

[[File:HMS Badger (1911).jpg|300px|thumb|{{HMS|Badger|1911|6}} was the first destroyer to successfully ram a submarine.]]
The desire to attack submarines underwater led to rapid destroyer evolution during the war; they were quickly equipped with strengthened bows for ramming, [[depth charge]]s and [[hydrophone]]s for identifying submarine targets. The first submarine casualty to a destroyer was the German {{SMU|U-19|Germany|2}}, rammed by {{HMS|Badger|1911|6}} on 29 October 1914. While ''U-19'' was only damaged, the next month {{HMS|Garry|3=2}} successfully sank {{SMU|U-18|Germany|2}}. The first depth-charge sinking was on 4 December 1916, when {{SMU|UC-19|3=2}}<ref>''U-Boats Destroyed'', Paul Kemp (1997), ISBN 1-85409-515-3</ref> was sunk by HMS ''Llewellyn''.

The submarine threat meant that many destroyers spent their time on anti-submarine patrol; once Germany adopted [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] in January 1917, destroyers were called on to escort merchant [[convoy]]s. US Navy destroyers were among the first American units to be dispatched upon the American entry to the war, and a squadron of Japanese destroyers even joined Allied patrols in the Mediterranean. Patrol duty was far from safe; of the 67 British destroyers lost in the war, collisions accounted for 18, while 12 were wrecked.

At the end of the war the state-of-the-art was represented by the British [[V and W-class destroyer|W-class]].

== Inter-war & World War II ==
[[File:Velox.jpg|right|thumb|V-class destroyer, {{HMS|Velox|D34|6}}]]
The trend during World War I had been towards larger destroyers with heavier armaments. A number of opportunities to fire at capital ships had been missed during the War, because destroyers had expended all their torpedoes in an initial salvo. The British [[V and W-class destroyer|V and W classes]] of the late war had sought to address this by mounting six torpedo tubes in two triple mounts, instead of the four or two on earlier models. The 'V' and 'W's set the standard of destroyer building well into the 1920s.

[[File:Uranami II.jpg|left|thumb|''Fubuki''-class destroyer, {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Uranami||2}}]]The next major innovation came with the Japanese {{sclass-|Fubuki|destroyer|4}} or 'special type', designed in 1923 and delivered in 1928. The design was initially noted for its powerful armament of six five-inch (127&nbsp;mm) guns and three triple torpedo mounts. The second batch of the class gave the guns high-angle turrets for anti-aircraft warfare, and the {{convert|24|in|cm|adj=on}} oxygen-fueled 'Long Lance' [[Type 93 torpedo]]. The later {{sclass-|Hatsuharu|destroyer|4}} of 1931 further improved the torpedo armament by storing its reload torpedoes close at hand in the superstructure, allowing reloading within 15 minutes.

Most other nations replied with similar larger ships. The US {{sclass-|Porter|destroyer|4}} adopted twin five-inch (127&nbsp;mm) guns, and the subsequent {{sclass-|Mahan|destroyer|4}} and {{sclass-|Gridley|destroyer|4}} (the latter of 1934) increased the number of torpedo tubes to 12 and 16 respectively.

[[File:Fantasque.jpg|thumb|France's {{sclass-|Fantasque|destroyer|4}}, the fastest destroyer class ever built.]]
In the Mediterranean, the Italian Navy's building of very fast light cruisers of the {{sclass2-|Condottieri|cruiser|4}} prompted the French to produce exceptional destroyer designs. The French had long been keen on large destroyers, with their {{sclass-|Chacal|destroyer|4}} of 1922 displacing over 2,000&nbsp;tons and carrying 130&nbsp;mm guns; a further three similar classes were produced around 1930. The {{sclass-|Fantasque|destroyer|4}} of 1935 carried five {{convert|138|mm|in}} guns and nine torpedo tubes, but could achieve speeds of {{convert|45|knot|km/h|0}}, which remains the record speed for a steamship and for any destroyer.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The Italians' own destroyers were almost as swift, most Italian designs of the 1930s being rated at over {{convert|38|knot|km/h|0}}, while carrying torpedoes and either four or six 120&nbsp;mm guns.

Germany started to build destroyers again during the 1930s as part of Hitler's rearmament program. The Germans were also fond of large destroyers, but while the initial [[German World War II destroyers|Type 1934]] displaced over 3,000&nbsp;tons, their armament was equal to smaller vessels. This changed from the Type 1936 onwards, which mounted heavy {{convert|150|mm|in}} guns. German destroyers also used innovative high-pressure steam machinery: while this should have helped their efficiency, it more often resulted in mechanical problems.

Once German and Japanese rearmament became clear, the British and American navies consciously focused on building destroyers that were smaller but more numerous than those used by other nations. The British built a series of destroyers (the {{sclass2-|A|destroyer|4||1929}} to {{sclass2-|I|destroyer|4}}) which were about 1,400&nbsp;tons standard displacement, had four {{convert|4.7|in|mm|0|sing=on}} guns and eight torpedo tubes; the American {{sclass-|Benson|destroyer|4}} of 1938 similar in size, but carried five {{convert|5|in|mm|0|sing=on}} guns and ten torpedo tubes. Realizing the need for heavier gun armament, the British built the {{sclass2-|Tribal|destroyer (1936)|4}} of 1936 (sometimes called ''Afridi'' after one of two lead ships). These ships displaced 1,850&nbsp;tons and were armed with eight {{convert|4.7|in|mm|0|sing=on}} guns in four twin turrets and four torpedo tubes. These were followed by the [[J, K and N-class destroyer|J-class]] and L-class destroyers, with six {{convert|4.7|in|mm|0|sing=on}} guns in twin turrets and eight torpedo tubes.

Anti-submarine sensors included [[sonar]] (or ASDIC), although training in their use was indifferent. Anti-submarine weapons changed little, and ahead-throwing weapons, a need recognized in World War I, had made no progress.

During the 1920s and 1930s destroyers were often deployed to areas of diplomatic tension or humanitarian disaster. British and American destroyers were common on the Chinese coast and rivers, even supplying landing parties to protect colonial interests.

By [[World War II]] the threat had evolved once again. Submarines were more effective, and [[aircraft]] had become important weapons of naval warfare; once again the early-war fleet destroyers were ill-equipped for combating these new targets. They were fitted with new light [[anti-aircraft]] guns, [[radar]], and [[Hedgehog (weapon)|forward-launched ASW]] weapons, in addition to their existing [[dual-purpose gun]]s, [[depth charge]]s, and [[torpedo]]es. In most cases torpedo and/or dual-purpose gun armament was reduced to accommodate new [[anti-air warfare|anti-air]] and [[anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] weapons. By this time the destroyers had become large, multi-purpose vessels, expensive targets in their own right. As a result, casualties on destroyers were among the highest.

The need for large numbers of anti-submarine ships led to the introduction of smaller and cheaper specialized anti-submarine warships called [[corvette]]s and [[frigate]]s by the [[Royal Navy]] and [[destroyer escort]]s by the [[USN]]. A similar programme was belatedly started by the Japanese (see {{sclass-|Matsu|destroyer|2}}). These ships had the size and displacement of the original torpedo boat destroyers that the contemporary destroyer had evolved from.

[[File:Blyskawica l d.jpg|thumb|[[Polish Navy|Polish]] destroyer {{ORP|Błyskawica}}, currently preserved as a [[museum ship]] in [[Gdynia]].]]
Some conventional destroyers were completed in the late 1940s and 1950s which built on wartime experience. These vessels were significantly larger than wartime ships and had fully automatic main guns, unit Machinery, radar, sonar, and antisubmarine weapons such as the [[Squid (weapon)|Squid mortar]]. Examples include the British {{sclass-|Daring|destroyer (1949)|4}}, US {{sclass-|Forrest Sherman|destroyer|4}}, and the Soviet {{sclass-|Kotlin|destroyer|2}}s.

Some World War II–vintage ships were modernized for anti-submarine warfare, and to extend their service lives, to avoid having to build (expensive) brand-new ships. Examples include the US [[FRAM I]] programme and the British [[Type 15 frigate]]s converted from fleet destroyers.

The advent of [[surface-to-air missile]]s and [[surface-to-surface missile]]s, such as the [[Exocet]], in the early 1960s changed naval warfare. [[Guided missile destroyer]]s (DDG in the US Navy) were developed to carry these weapons and protect the fleet from air, submarine and surface threats. Examples include the Soviet {{sclass-|Kashin|destroyer|4}}, the British {{sclass2-|County|destroyer|4}}, and the US {{sclass-|Charles F. Adams|destroyer|4}}.

== Operators ==
[[File:HMS Daring-1.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Daring|D32|6}}, a [[Type 45 destroyer|Type 45]] [[guided missile destroyer]] of the [[Royal Navy]].]]
In the [[US Navy]], fleet destroyers operate in support of [[carrier battle group]]s, surface action groups, amphibious groups and replenishment groups. The destroyers currently in use by the US Navy are the {{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer|4}}. Destroyers (with a DD [[hull classification symbol]]) primarily perform anti-submarine warfare duty while [[guided missile]] destroyers (DDGs) are multi-mission ([[anti-submarine]], [[anti-aircraft]] and anti-surface warfare) surface combatants, with an emphasis on anti-surface warfare.

The addition of [[cruise missile]] launchers has greatly expanded the role of the destroyer in strike and land-attack warfare. As the expense of heavier surface combatants has generally removed them from the fleet, destroyer tonnage has grown (a modern ''Arleigh Burke''-class destroyer has the same tonnage as a [[World War II]] [[light cruiser]]). Many modern destroyer designs delegate their anti-submarine role to embarked helicopters, which in addition to anti-submarine warfare can also be used for maritime rescue and vertical replenishment.

In October 2013 the first of three U.S. {{sclass-|Zumwalt|destroyer|4}} of destroyers left dry dock, the destroyer built with specific structural angles and a superstructure wrapped in a carbon fiber composite canopy to reduce its radar detectability by a factor of 50.<ref name=CNN20131029 /> The ship, with 80 missiles and a crew of 150, will include two Advanced Gun Systems (AGS) that can fire rocket-powered, computer-guided shells to destroy targets {{convert|63|mi|km}} away.<ref name=CNN20131029>{{cite web |url=http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2013/10/29/bigger-faster-deadlier-navy-launches-new-stealth-destroyer/ |title=Bigger, Lighter, Deadlier!

The [[Royal Navy]] operates the [[Type 45 destroyer|Type 45]], or ''Daring'' class, stealth destroyer which displaces roughly 7,200 tonnes. A class of six ships is envisaged. They are equipped with the UK variant of the [[PAAMS|Principal Anti-Air Missile System]] (PAAMS) and [[BAE Systems]] [[SAMPSON]] radar. The Royal Navy also operates a [[Type 82 destroyer|Type 82]] destroyer for training use.

The [[Italian Navy]] and the [[French Navy]] each operate two {{sclass2-|Horizon|frigate|2}}s and operate new [[FREMM multipurpose frigate]]s. These stealthy ships are armed with anti-ship missiles and [[MBDA Aster|Aster]] surface-to-air missiles. The Italian navy also operates two {{sclass-|Durand de la Penne|destroyer|2}}s. The French navy also operates six {{sclass-|Georges Leygues|frigate|2}}s and two {{sclass-|Cassard|frigate|2}}s. The French Navy applies the term "first-class frigate" to ''Georges Leygues'', ''Cassard'', ''Horizon'', and FREMM class ships and uses the NATO [[hull classification symbol]] "D 6xx" to place them in the destroyer type. Italy classifies the FREMM with the NATO designation of "F" for frigate.

[[File:HMCS Algonquin (DDG 283)2.jpg|thumb|left|{{HMCS|Algonquin|DDH 283|6}}, an {{sclass-|Iroquois|destroyer|2}} of the [[Royal Canadian Navy]]]]
The [[Canadian Forces Maritime Command|Royal Canadian Navy]] operates the {{sclass-|Iroquois|destroyer|2}}s, a class of four [[helicopter]]-carrying, anti-aircraft, [[guided missile]] destroyers (with three remaining in service). They were originally fitted out for [[anti-submarine warfare]], but the entire class underwent major retrofits in the 1990s which re-purposed the ships as area air-defence destroyers.

[[File:INS Kolkata.jpg|thumb|right|{{sclass-|Kolkata|destroyer|2}}]]
The [[Indian Navy]] operates two {{sclass-|Kolkata|destroyer|2}}s. These ships are armed with [[Brahmos]] missiles, which have a range of {{convert|300|km|mi}}, in the anti-ship role. ([[Barak 8 (missile)|Barak-8]]) system is installed to counter airborne threats. Along with the ''Kolkata'' class, Indian Navy operates, the {{sclass-|Delhi|destroyer|5}} and {{sclass-|Rajput|destroyer|0}} destroyers. These destroyers also carry anti-submarine rockets and torpedoes. The destroyers have the capability to carry two Sea King helicopters. The ''Kolkata'' class will be augmented by the new [[Visakhapatnam-class destroyer|P15B class of destroyers]] (''Visakhapatnam''-class destroyer) the construction of which was started in 2014.

[[File:Luyang II (Type 052C) Class Destroyer.JPG|thumb|right|A [[People's Liberation Army Navy|Chinese Navy]] [[Type 052C destroyer|''Luyang'' II class (Type 052C)]] destroyer]]
Since 2003, the [[Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy]] has launched the [[Type 052B destroyer|''Luyang'' I]], [[Type 052C destroyer|''Luyang'' II]] and [[Type 051C destroyer|''Luzhou'' classes]]. The latter two are armed with long range air defense missiles, the indigenous HQ-9 and the Russian S-300 respectively. China also operates two [[Type 052D destroyer|''Luyang'' III]]-class destroyers, six [[Type 051 destroyer|''Luda'']]-class destroyers, two [[Type 052 destroyer|''Luhu'']]-class destroyers, and one [[Type 051B destroyer|''Luhai'']]-class destroyer.

[[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force|Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force]] operates the {{sclass-|Atago|destroyer|0}} and {{sclass-|Kongō|destroyer|0}} destroyers which both employ the Aegis combat system. Japan also operates a {{sclass-|Shirane|destroyer|2}}, two {{sclass-|Hatakaze|destroyer|0}} destroyers, four {{sclass-|Akizuki|destroyer|0}} destroyers, five {{sclass-|Takanami|destroyer|0}} destroyers, nine {{sclass-|Murasame|destroyer|0||1994}} destroyers, eight {{sclass-|Asagiri|destroyer|0}} destroyers, three {{sclass-|Hatsuyuki|destroyer|0}} destroyers, six {{sclass-|Abukuma|destroyer escort|0}} destroyers, and three {{sclass-|Shimayuki|destroyer|0}} destroyers for training use.

The [[Republic of Korea Navy]] operates several classes of destroyers including the {{sclass-|Sejong the Great|destroyer|4}} (KDX-III), the {{sclass-|Chungmugong Yi Sun-shin|destroyer|4}} (KDX-II) and {{sclass-|Gwanggaeto the Great|destroyer|4}} (KDX-I) of destroyers. The KDX-III is equipped with the [[Aegis combat system]], [[Goalkeeper CIWS]], [[Hyunmoo]] [[cruise missile]] and the [[Hae Sung]] [[anti-ship missile]].

[[File:AdmiralVinogradov2009.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Russian Navy]] {{sclass-|Udaloy|destroyer|2}}]]
The [[Russian Navy]] and the People's Liberation Army Navy of the [[People's Republic of China]] operate the {{sclass-|Sovremenny|destroyer|4}}, a class of large multi-purpose missile destroyers. They are powered by pressure-fired boilers, making them capable of speeds in excess of {{convert|30|kn|km/h|0}}. Their armament consists of eight [[SS-N-22 Sunburn]] anti-ship missiles, launchers for [[SA-N-7 Gadfly]] anti-air missiles and two AK-130 twin-barreled 130&nbsp;mm automatic naval guns which can fire laser-guided shells. While they also carry 533&nbsp;mm torpedo tubes and [[RBU-6000]] rocket launchers for use against submarines, their primary mission is to attack surface ships. Their anti-aircraft missiles have a surface attack mode, and both the 130&nbsp;mm guns and the torpedoes are useful against ships at close range.

The modern {{sclass-|Udaloy|destroyer|2}} destroyers of the [[Russian Navy]] can displace about 7,900 tonnes, can travel at {{convert|35|kn|km/h|0}}, and have a maximum range of 10,500&nbsp;nm (19,450&nbsp;km) at {{convert|14|kn|km/h|0}}. The original class (''Udaloy I'') was designed for [[anti-submarine warfare]], which can be seen in their two quadruple launchers of the [[Metel Anti-Ship Complex]] (SS-N-14), two quadruple {{convert|533|mm|in|0}} launchers equipped with either the [[Type 53 torpedo]] on the ''Udaloy I'' class or [[RPK-2 Viyuga]] (SS-N-15) on the ''Udaloy II'' class, and the two [[RBU-6000]] anti-submarine launchers. The ''II'' class is Russia's only multipurpose destroyer. The armament of the class has been modified. The Metal Anti-Ship Complex is replaced with eight [[P-270 Moskit]] (SS-N-22 Sunburn) [[supersonic]] [[sea-skimming]] [[anti-ship missile]]. For [[air defense]], each ''Udaloy'' is armed with four [[AK-630]] [[CIWS]]s, mounted parallel to each other mid ship. They also have two [[Kashtan]] CIWSs, each capable of engaging six targets automatically by either its armament of two [[GSh-6-30]] [[Gatling gun]]s or four [[9M311]] (SA-N-11) [[surface-to-air missile]]s. Finally, 64 [[Tor missile system#3695 Kinzhal|3K95 Kinzhal]] (SA-N-9) medium-range [[point defense]] SAMs can be fired from [[vertical launching system]]. Russia also operates a single {{sclass-|Kashin|destroyer|2}}.

[[File:USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000) at night.jpg|thumb|{{USS|Zumwalt|DDG-1000|6}}, the lead ship of the DD(X) class.]]

The last US Navy {{sclass-|Spruance|destroyer|2}} in service, {{USS|Cushing|DD-985|6}}, was decommissioned on September 21, 2005. The {{sclass-|Zumwalt|destroyer|4}} is planned to replace them; on November 1, 2001, the US Navy announced the issuance of a revised Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Future Surface Combatant Program. Formerly known as DD 21, the program was renamed DD(X) (and later renamed to DDG-1000) to more accurately reflect the program purpose, which is to produce a family of advanced technology surface combatants, not a single ship class. DD(X), also called ''Zumwalt'' class, is much larger than traditional destroyers, nearly three thousand tons heavier than a {{sclass-|Ticonderoga|cruiser}} (15,610&nbsp;long tons,<ref name="navy-Zumwalt">[http://www.navy.mil/navydata/fact_display.asp?cid=4200&tid=900&ct=4 Destroyers – DDG fact file].

It will potentially employ advanced weaponry and an all-electric Integrated Power System; however, the construction program was subsequently reduced to just two [[Marine vessel|vessels]], and there is currently only funding for three in total. With the retirement of the ''Spruance'' class, the US Navy began commissioning an advanced variant of the ''Arleigh Burke'' class with expanded ASW capabilities, the ''Arleigh Burke'' Flight IIA, beginning with {{USS|Oscar Austin|DDG-79|6}}. {{As of|2012}}, 34 of these vessels are in service, with more under construction.

The [[Royal Australian Navy]] is currently building three {{sclass-|Hobart|destroyer|2}}s. These ships are to replace the aging {{sclass-|Adelaide|frigate|2}}s. Their design is similar to that of the ''Arleigh Burke''-class destroyer and the ''Alvaro de Bazan''-class destroyer. They will also use the AEGIS Combat System. The first unit, {{HMAS|Hobart|DDH 39|0}}, will be commissioned in June 2017.

The [[German Navy]] is currently building four {{sclass-|F125|frigate|2}}s. Although classified by Germany as frigates, they are destroyers in terms of size and strength.{{citation needed|date=July 2015|reason= No citation for this comparison}} They are to replace the aging {{sclass-|Bremen|frigate|2}}s. The first unit, FGS ''Baden-Wurttemberg'' F125, will be commissioned in 2016 with "F" being the NATO hull classification for a frigate.

The [[People's Liberation Army Navy]] is currently adding ten more ships of the [[Type 052D destroyer]] class. Three more units scheduled to be delivered by 2016. Development has also begun for the [[Type 055 destroyer]]. These ships are expected to carry a Chinese version of the AEGIS combat system.

The [[Islamic Republic of Iran Navy]] is currently adding four more {{sclass-|Moudge|frigate|0}} frigates to its fleet.
