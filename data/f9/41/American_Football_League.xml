</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><bold>American Football League</bold><space/>(<bold>AFL</bold>) was a major professional<space/><link><target>American football</target></link><space/>league that operated from 1960 until 1969, when it merged with the<space/><link><target>National Football League</target></link><space/>(NFL). The upstart AFL operated in direct competition with the more established NFL throughout its existence.</paragraph><paragraph>The AFL was created by a number of owners who had been refused NFL expansion franchises or had minor shares of NFL franchises. The AFL's original lineup saw an Eastern division of the<space/><link><target>New York Jets</target><part>New York Titans</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Boston Patriots</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Buffalo Bills</target></link>, and the<space/><link><target>Houston Oilers</target></link><space/>along with a Western division of the<space/><link><target>Los Angeles Chargers</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Denver Broncos</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Oakland Raiders</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Kansas City Chiefs</target><part>Dallas Texans</part></link>. The league first gained attention by signing 75% of the<space/><link><target>1960 NFL Draft</target><part>NFL's first-round draft choices in 1960</part></link>, including Houston's successful signing of All-American<space/><link><target>Billy Cannon</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>While the first years of the AFL saw uneven competition and low attendance, the league was buttressed by a generous television contract with<space/><link><target>American Broadcasting Company</target><part>ABC</part></link><space/>(followed by a contract with<space/><link><target>National Broadcasting Company</target><part>NBC</part></link><space/>for games starting with the 1965 season) that broadcast the more offense-oriented football league nationwide.

The transformation of the struggling Titans into the<space/><link><target>New York Jets</target></link><space/>under new ownership further solidified the league's reputation among the major media.</paragraph><paragraph>As fierce competition made player salaries skyrocket in both leagues, especially after a series of &quot;raids,&quot; the leagues agreed to a<space/><link><target>AFL-NFL merger</target><part>merger in 1966</part></link>. Among the conditions were a common draft and a championship game played between the two league champions, which would eventually become known as the<space/><link><target>Super Bowl</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>The AFL and NFL operated as separate leagues until 1970, with separate regular season and playoff schedules except for the championship game. During this time the AFL added the<space/><link><target>Miami Dolphins</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Cincinnati Bengals</target></link>.

The NFL's initial reaction was not as openly hostile as it had been with the earlier<space/><link><target>All-America Football Conference</target></link><space/>(Bell had even given his public approval), yet individual NFL owners soon began a campaign to undermine the new league.

When the two leagues merged in 1970, all ten AFL franchises and their statistics became part of the new NFL. Every other professional league that had competed against the NFL before the AFL-NFL merger had folded completely: the three previous leagues named &quot;American Football League&quot; and the<space/><link><target>All-America Football Conference</target></link>. From an earlier AFL (19361937), only the Cleveland Rams (now the<space/><link><target>St. Louis Rams</target></link>) joined the NFL and are currently operating, as are the<space/><link><target>Cleveland Browns</target></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>San Francisco 49ers</target></link><space/>from the AAFC. A third AAFC team, the<space/><link><target>Baltimore Colts (19471950)</target><part>Baltimore Colts</part></link><space/>(not related to the 19531983 Baltimore Colts or to the current Indianapolis Colts franchise), played only one year in the NFL, disbanding at the end of the 1950 season.<extension extension_name='ref' name="cross"></extension><space/>The league resulting from the merger was a 26-team juggernaut (since expanded to 32) with television rights covering all of the<space/><link><target>Big Three television networks</target></link><space/>and teams in close proximity to almost all of the top 40 metropolitan areas, a fact that has precluded any other competing league from gaining traction since the merger; failed attempts to mimic the AFL's success included the<space/><link><target>World Football League</target></link><space/>(197475),<space/><link><target>United States Football League</target></link><space/>(198385),<space/><link><target>XFL</target></link><space/>(2001) and<space/><link><target>United Football League (2009)</target><part>United Football League</part></link><space/>(20092012).</paragraph><paragraph>The AFL was also the most successful of numerous upstart leagues of the 1960s and 1970s that attempted to challenge a major professional league's dominance. All nine teams that were in the AFL at the time the merger was agreed upon were accepted into the league intact (as was the tenth team added between the time of the merger's agreement and finalization). For comparison, the<space/><link><target>World Hockey Association</target></link><space/>(197279) managed to have four of its six remaining teams merged into the<space/><link><target>National Hockey League</target></link>, which actually caused the older league to contract a franchise, but WHA teams were forced to disperse the majority of their rosters and restart as expansion teams. The merged WHA teams were also not financially sound, as three of the four were forced to relocate within 20 years. The<space/><link><target>American Basketball Association</target></link><space/>(196776) managed to have only four of its teams merged into the National Basketball Association, and the rest of the league was forced to fold. The<space/><link><target>Continental League</target></link>, a proposed third league for<space/><link><target>Major League Baseball</target></link><space/>that was to begin play in 1961, never played a single game.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Rule changes</heading><paragraph>The NFL adopted some of the innovations introduced by the AFL immediately and a few others in the years following the merger. One was including the names on player jerseys. The older league also adopted the practice of using the stadium scoreboard clocks to keep track of the official game time, instead of just having a<space/><link><target>stopwatch</target></link><space/>used by the referee. The AFL played a 14-game schedule for its entire existence, starting in 1960. The NFL, which had played a 12-game schedule since 1947, changed to a 14-game schedule in 1961, a year after the American Football League instituted it. The AFL also introduced the<space/><link><target>two-point conversion</target></link><space/>to professional football thirty-four years before the NFL instituted it in 1994 (college football had adopted the two-point conversion in the late 1950s). All of these innovations pioneered by the AFL, including its more exciting style of play and colorful uniforms, have essentially made today's professional football more like the<space/><italics>AFL</italics><space/>than like the old-line NFL. The AFL's challenge to the NFL also laid the groundwork for the<space/><link><target>Super Bowl</target></link>, which has become the standard for championship contests in the United States of America.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Television</heading><paragraph>The NFL also adapted how the AFL used the growing power of televised football games, which were bolstered with the help of major network contracts (first with<space/><link><target>American Broadcasting Company</target><part>ABC</part></link><space/>and later with<space/><link><target>NBC</target></link>). With that first contract with ABC, the AFL adopted the first-ever cooperative television plan for professional football, in which the proceeds were divided equally among member clubs. It featured many outstanding games, such as the classic 1962 double-overtime American Football League championship game between the<space/><link><target>Kansas City Chiefs</target><part>Dallas Texans</part></link><space/>and the defending champion<space/><link><target>Tennessee Titans</target><part>Houston Oilers</part></link>. At the time it was the longest<space/><link><target>Professional American football championship games</target><part>professional football championship game</part></link><space/>ever played. The AFL also appealed to fans by offering a flashier style of play (just like the ABA in basketball), compared to the more conservative game of the NFL. Long passes (&quot;bombs&quot;) were commonplace in AFL offenses, led by such talented quarterbacks as<space/><link><target>John Hadl</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Daryle Lamonica</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Len Dawson</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Despite having a national television contract, the AFL often found itself trying to gain a foothold, only to come up against roadblocks. For example, CBS-TV, which broadcast NFL games, ignored and did not report scores from the innovative AFL, on orders from the NFL. It was only after the merger agreement was announced that CBS began to give AFL scores.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Expanding and reintroducing the sport to more cities</heading><paragraph>The AFL took advantage of the burgeoning popularity of football by locating teams in major cities that lacked NFL franchises. Hunt's vision not only brought a new professional football league to<space/><link><target>California</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>New York</target></link>, but introduced the sport to<space/><link><target>Colorado</target></link>, restored it to<space/><link><target>Texas</target></link><space/>and later to fast-growing<space/><link><target>Florida</target></link>, as well as bringing it to<space/><link><target>New England</target></link><space/>for the first time in 12 years. Buffalo, having lost its<space/><link><target>Buffalo (NFL)</target><part>original NFL franchise</part></link><space/>in 1929 and turned down by the NFL at least twice (1940 and<space/><link><target>Buffalo Bills (AAFC)</target><part>1950</part></link>) for a replacement, returned to the NFL with the merger. The return of football to Kansas City was the first time that city had seen professional football since the NFL's<space/><link><target>Kansas City Blues/Cowboys</target></link><space/>of the 1920s; the arrival of the Chiefs, and the contemporary arrival of the<space/><link><target>Arizona Cardinals</target><part>St. Louis Football Cardinals</part></link>, brought professional football back to Missouri for the first time since the temporary<space/><link><target>St. Louis Gunners</target></link><space/>of 1934.</paragraph><paragraph>If not for the AFL, at least 17 of today's NFL teams would probably never have existed: the ten teams from the AFL, and seven clubs that were instigated by the AFL's presence to some degree. Three NFL franchises were awarded as a direct result of the AFL's competition with the older league: the Minnesota Vikings, who were awarded to Max Winter in exchange for dropping his bid to join the AFL; the Atlanta Falcons, whose franchise went to Rankin Smith to dissuade him from purchasing the AFL's<space/><link><target>Miami Dolphins</target></link>; and the New Orleans Saints, because of successful anti-trust legislation which let the two leagues merge, and was supported by several Louisiana politicians.</paragraph><paragraph>In the case of the Dallas Cowboys, the NFL had long sought to return to the Dallas area after the<space/><link><target>Dallas Texans (NFL)</target><part>Dallas Texans</part></link><space/>folded in 1952, but was originally met with strong opposition by<space/><link><target>Washington Redskins</target></link><space/>owner<space/><link><target>George Preston Marshall</target></link>, who had enjoyed a monopoly as the only NFL team to represent the American South. Marshall later changed his position after future-Cowboys owner<space/><link><target>Clint Murchison</target></link><space/>bought the rights to Washington's fight song &quot;<link><target>Hail to the Redskins</target></link>&quot; and threatened to prevent Marshall from playing it at games. By then, the NFL wanted to quickly award the new Dallas franchise to Murchison so the team could immediately begin play and complete with the AFL's Texans. As a result, the Cowboys played its inaugural season in 1960 without the benefit of the<space/><link><target>1960 NFL Draft</target><part>NFL draft</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>As part of the merger agreement, additional expansion teams would be awarded by 1970 or soon thereafter to bring the league to 28 franchises; this requirement was fulfilled when the<space/><link><target>Seattle Seahawks</target></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>Tampa Bay Buccaneers</target></link><space/>began play in 1976. In addition, had it not been for the existence of the Oilers from 1960 to 1996, the<space/><link><target>Houston Texans</target></link><space/>also would likely not exist today; the 2002 expansion team restored professional football in Houston after the original charter AFL member Oilers relocated to become the<space/><link><target>Tennessee Titans</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Kevin Sherrington of<space/><italics><link><target>The Dallas Morning News</target></link></italics><space/>has argued that the presence of AFL and the subsequent merger radically altered the fortunes of the<space/><link><target>Pittsburgh Steelers</target></link>, saving the team &quot;from stinking&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref' name="DallasNews20110201"></extension><space/>Before the merger, the Steelers had long been one of the NFL's worst teams.

This apparently was meant to assert that the AFL could not achieve parity as long as it had to compete with the NFL in the draft. But the 1968 Jets had less than a handful of &quot;common draftees&quot;. Their stars were honed in the AFL, many of them since the Titans days. As noted below, the AFL got its share of stars long before the &quot;common draft&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>Players who chose the AFL to develop their talent included<space/><link><target>Lance Alworth</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Ron Mix</target></link><space/>of the<space/><link><target>San Diego Chargers</target><part>Chargers</part></link>, who had also been drafted by the NFL's<space/><link><target>San Francisco 49ers</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>History of the Indianapolis Colts</target><part>Baltimore Colts</part></link><space/>respectively.

The home teams alternated each year by division, so in 1968 the Jets hosted the Raiders, even though Oakland had a better record (this was changed in 1969). In 1963, the Buffalo Bills and Boston Patriots finished tied with identical records of 761 in the AFL East Division. There was no tie-breaker protocol in place, so a one-game playoff was held in War Memorial Stadium in December. The visiting Patriots defeated the host Bills 268. The Patriots traveled to San Diego as the Chargers completed a three-game season sweep over the weary Patriots with a 5110 victory. A similar situation occurred in the 1968 season, when the Oakland Raiders and the Kansas City Chiefs finished the regular season tied with identical records of 122 in the AFL West Division. The Raiders beat the Chiefs 416 in a division playoff to qualify for the AFL Championship Game. In 1969, the final year of the independent AFL, Professional Football's first &quot;<link><target>Wild card (sports)</target><part>wild card</part></link>&quot; playoffs were conducted. A four-team playoff was held, with the second-place teams in each division playing the winner of the other division. The Chiefs upset the Raiders in Oakland 177 in the league's Championship, the final AFL game played. The Kansas City Chiefs were the first Super Bowl champion to win two road playoff games and the first wildcard team to win the Super Bowl, although the term &quot;wildcard&quot; was coined by the media, and not used officially until several years later.</paragraph><heading level='2'>AFL Championship Games</heading><table class="wikitable" style="font-size: 95%"><tablerow><tablecell
