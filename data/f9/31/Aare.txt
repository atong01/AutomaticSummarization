The '''Aare''' ({{IPA-de|ˈaːrə}}) or '''Aar''' is a [[tributary]] of the [[High Rhine]] and the longest [[river]] that both rises and ends entirely within [[Switzerland]].<ref name=CVDE>{{harvnb|Bridgwater|Aldrich|1968|p=11}}</ref><ref name=GH/>

Its total length from its source to its junction with the [[Rhine]] comprises about 295<ref name="eb"/> km (183 miles),<ref name=CVDE /> during which distance it descends {{convert|1565|m|ft|abbr=on}}, draining an area of {{convert|17779|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, almost entirely within Switzerland, and accounting for close to half the area of the country, including all of [[Central Switzerland]].<ref name="eb">{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=4}}</ref> 
There are more than 40 [[hydroelectric plant]]s along the course of the Aare River.<ref name=cohen/>

The [[hydronymy|river's name]] dates to at least the [[La Tène period]], and it is attested as ''Nantaror'' "Aare valley" in the [[Berne zinc tablet]] which dates back to [[Roman Gaul]]. 
The name was Latinized as  ''Arula/Arola/Araris''<ref>{{harvnb|Kristol|Cattin|Meroni|Schmid|2005|p=73}}</ref>{{refn| group = nb |The river ''[[Obringa]]'', mentioned by [[Ptolemy]] (2.7.9) as a tributary of the Rhine, has been identified with either the [[Moselle (river)|Mosel]] or the Aare<ref>{{harvnb|Forbiger|1848|p=126f}}</ref>}}

The Aare rises in the great [[Aargletschers]] (Aare Glaciers) of the [[Bernese Alps]], in the [[canton of Bern]] and west of the [[Grimsel Pass]].<ref name="CVDE"/> The [[Unteraargletscher]] (Lower Aare-Glacier) is the main source of the water, for the source [[Lake Grimsel]],<ref name=GH>{{harvnb|Gresswell|Huxley|1965|p=27}}</ref> along with the [[Finsteraarhorn|Finsteraargletscher]], [[Oberaargletscher]] (Upper Aare-Glacier),<ref name=GH/> and [[Lauteraarhorn|Lauteraargletscher]].<ref name=cohen>{{harvnb|Cohen|1998|p=1}}</ref> It runs east to the Grimsel [[Hostel|Hospice]], below the [[Finsteraarhorn]], and then northwest through the [[Haslital]], forming on the way the magnificent Handegg Waterfall, {{convert|46|m|ft|abbr=on}}, past [[Guttannen]]. Between [[Innertkirchen]] and [[Meiringen]], the river carves through a [[limestone]] ridge in the [[Aare Gorge]] or ''Aareschlucht''.<ref name=CVDE /> It is here that the Aare proves itself to be more than just a river, as it attracts thousands of tourists annually to the causeways through the gorge.<ref name=GH/>

A little past Meiringen, near [[Brienz]], the river expands into [[Lake Brienz]]. Near the west end of the lake it receives its first important [[tributary]], the [[Lütschine]]. It then runs across the swampy plain of the Bödeli between [[Interlaken]] and [[Unterseen]] before flowing into [[Lake Thun]].<ref name=CVDE />

Near the west end of Lake Thun, the river receives the waters of the [[Kander (Switzerland)|Kander]], which has just been joined by the [[Simme]]. Lake Thun marks the [[head of navigation]].<ref name=cohen/> On flowing out of the lake it passes through [[Thun]], and then flows through the city of [[Bern]], passing beneath [[List of Aare bridges in Bern|eighteen bridges]] and around the steeply-flanked peninsula on which the [[Old City of Berne|Old City]] is located. The river soon changes its northwesterly flow for a due westerly direction, but after receiving the [[Saane/Sarine|Saane or Sarine]] it turns north until it nears [[Aarberg]]. There, in one of the major Swiss engineering feats of the 19th century, the [[Jura water correction]], the river, which had previously rendered the countryside north of Bern a [[swampland]] through frequent flooding, was diverted by the [[Hagneck Canal]] into the [[Lake of Bienne]]. From the upper end of the lake, at [[Nidau]], the river issues through the [[Nidau-Büren channel]], also called the Aare Canal,<ref name=GH/> and then runs east to [[Büren, Solothurn|Büren]]. The lake absorbs huge amounts of eroded gravel and snowmelt that the river brings from the Alps, and the former swamps have become fruitful plains: they are known as the "vegetable garden of Switzerland".

From here the Aare flows northeast for a long distance, past the ambassador town [[Solothurn]]<ref name=CVDE /> (below which the Grosse [[Emme (river)|Emme]] flows in on the right), Aarburg (where it is joined by the Wigger), [[Olten]], [[Aarau]],<ref name=CVDE /> near which is the junction with the [[Suhre]], and Wildegg, where the [[Bünz]] falls in on the right. A short distance further, below [[Brugg]] it receives first the [[Reuss (river)|Reuss]], and shortly afterwards the [[Limmat]]. It now turns due north, and soon becomes itself a tributary of the [[Rhine]], which it surpasses in volume when the two rivers unite at [[Koblenz, Switzerland|Koblenz]] (Switzerland), opposite [[Waldshut-Tiengen|Waldshut]], Germany.  The Rhine, in turn, empties into the [[North Sea]] after crossing into the [[Netherlands]].
