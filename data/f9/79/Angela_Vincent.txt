'''Angela Vincent''' (born 1942) is a professor at [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]] of [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]]. She is the head of a research group, which is located in the West Wing within the John Radcliffe Hospital, and works on a wide range of [[biology|biological]] disciplines encompassing [[molecular biology]], [[biochemistry]], cellular [[immunology]] and intracellular [[neurophysiology]]. The group's research is focused on autoimmune and [[genetic disorder]]s of the neuromuscular junction, peripheral nerves and more recently the exciting field of central nervous system diseases. The principal autoimmune diseases studied are [[myasthenia gravis]], the [[Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome]], [[limbic encephalitis]], other types of [[autoimmune encephalitis]] and acquired [[neuromyotonia]].

Her contributions are mainly on the roles of antibodies directed against [[ion channels]], proteins complexed to ion channels, such as LGI1, CASPR2 and Contactin-2, within [[neurons]], [[glia]] and the [[nerve]]-[[muscle]] junction in the pathogenesis of above-mentioned diseases.

She has demonstrated that transfer of these [[antibody|antibodies]] across the [[placenta]] from the [[pregnant]] [[woman]] to the [[fetus]] [[in utero]] can cause developmental abnormalities. She has also worked on the principal gene [[mutation]]s causing neuromuscular diseases.

In 2009 she presented the [[Leslie Oliver Oration]] at [[Queen's Hospital]].<ref>[http://www.bhrhospitals.nhs.uk/neuro/neuro4ha.php?id=1034 The Second Leslie Oliver Oration]</ref> In 2011, she was made a FRS.
