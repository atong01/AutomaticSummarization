The Anti-Lebanon mountains mark the border between Syria and Lebanon; the range has peaks of over 10,000&amp;nbsp;ft., and intercepts precipitations from the Mediterranean sea, so that the region of Damascus is sometimes subject to droughts. However, in ancient times this was mitigated by the Barada River, which originates from mountain streams fed by melting snow. Damascus is surrounded by Ghouta, an oasis where many vegetables, cereals fruits have been farmed since ancient times. Maps of Roman Syria indicate that the Barada river emptied into a lake of some size east of Damascus; today it is called Bahira Atayba, the hesitant lake, because in years of severe drought it does not even exist.<extension extension_name='ref' name="romeartlover"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The modern city has an area of<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>105</arg><arg>km2</arg><arg name="abbr">on</arg></template>, out of which<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>77</arg><arg>km2</arg><arg name="abbr">on</arg></template><space/>is urban, while<space/><link><target>Jabal Qasioun</target></link><space/>occupies the rest.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="publisher">Damascus Metropolitan Area Urban Planning and Development<space/></arg><arg name="url">http://dma-upd.org/PublicFiles/File/Discussion%20Papers/02_Strategy%20and%20Frameworks%20for%20the%20Damascus%20City%20Urbanization%20to%20Guide%20the%20City%20Master%20Plan%20Revision_R1.pdf?lang</arg><arg name="title">DMA-UPD Discussion Paper Series No.2<space/></arg><arg name="date">October 2009<space/></arg><arg name="page">2<space/></arg><arg name="archiveurl">https://web.archive.org/web/20121028075616/http://dma-upd.org/PublicFiles/File/Discussion%20Papers/02_Strategy%20and%20Frameworks%20for%20the%20Damascus%20City%20Urbanization%20to%20Guide%20the%20City%20Master%20Plan%20Revision_R1.pdf?lang</arg><arg name="archivedate">2012-10-28</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Barada river in Damascus (April 2009).jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>upright</part><part>One of the rare periods the<space/><link><target>Barada</target></link><space/>river is high, seen here next to the<space/><link><target>Four Seasons Hotel Damascus</target><part>Four Seasons</part></link><space/>hotel in downtown Damascus</part></link>The old city of Damascus, enclosed by the city walls, lies on the south bank of the river<space/><link><target>Barada</target></link><space/>which is almost dry (<template><target>convert</target><arg>3</arg><arg>cm</arg><arg>0</arg><arg name="abbr">on</arg></template><space/>left).

Within the first six months of Abbasid rule, revolts began erupting in the city, albeit too isolated and unfocused to present a viable threat. Nonetheless, the last of the prominent Umayyads were executed, the traditional officials of Damascus ostracized, and army generals from the city were dismissed. Afterward, the Umayyad family cemetery was desecrated and the city walls were torn down, reducing Damascus into a provincial town of little importance. It roughly disappeared from written records for the next century and the only significant improvement of the city was the Abbasid-built treasury dome in the Umayyad Mosque in 789.
