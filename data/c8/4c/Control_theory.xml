The usual objective of control theory is to control a system, often called the<space/><italics><link><target>Plant (control theory)</target><part>plant</part></link></italics>, so its output follows a desired control signal, called the<space/><italics><link><target>reference</target></link></italics>, which may be a fixed or changing value. To do this a<space/><italics><link><target>Controller (control theory)</target><part>controller</part></link></italics><space/>is designed, which monitors the output and compares it with the reference. The difference between actual and desired output, called the<space/><italics>error</italics><space/>signal, is applied as<space/><link><target>feedback</target></link><space/>to the input of the system, to bring the actual output closer to the reference. Some topics studied in control theory are<space/><link><target>Stability theory</target><part>stability</part></link><space/>(whether the output will converge to the reference value or oscillate about it),<space/><link><target>controllability</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>observability</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Extensive use is usually made of a diagrammatic style known as the<space/><link><target>block diagram</target></link>. The<space/><link><target>transfer function</target></link>, also known as the system function or network function, is a mathematical representation of the relation between the input and output based on the<space/><link><target>differential equation</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>describing the system.</paragraph><paragraph>Although a major application of control theory is in<space/><link><target>control systems engineering</target></link>, which deals with the design of<space/><link><target>process control</target></link><space/>systems for industry, other applications range far beyond this.

In practical applications these three elements are typically contained in one unit. A standard example of a measuring unit is a<space/><link><target>resistance thermometer</target></link>. The compare and compute functions are completed within the controller, which may be implemented electronically by<space/><link><target>proportional control</target></link>, a<space/><link><target>PI controller</target></link>,<space/><link><target>PID controller</target></link>, bistable, hysteretic control or<space/><link><target>programmable logic controller</target></link>. Older controller units have been mechanical, as in a<space/><link><target>centrifugal governor</target></link><space/>or a<space/><link><target>carburetor</target></link>. The correct function is completed with a final control element. The final control element changes an input or output in the control system that affects the manipulated or controlled variable.</paragraph><heading level='3'>An example</heading><paragraph>An example of a control system is a car's<space/><link><target>cruise control</target></link>, which is a device designed to maintain vehicle speed at a constant<space/><italics>desired</italics><space/>or<space/><italics>reference</italics><space/>speed provided by the driver. The<space/><italics>controller</italics><space/>is the cruise control, the<space/><italics>plant</italics><space/>is the car, and the<space/><italics>system</italics><space/>is the car and the cruise control. The system output is the car's speed, and the control itself is the engine's<space/><link><target>throttle</target></link><space/>position which determines how much power the engine delivers.</paragraph><paragraph>A primitive way to implement cruise control is simply to lock the throttle position when the driver engages cruise control. However, if the cruise control is engaged on a stretch of flat road, then the car will travel slower going uphill and faster when going downhill. This type of controller is called an<space/><italics><link><target>open-loop controller</target></link></italics><space/>because there is no<space/><link><target>feedback</target></link>; no measurement of the system output (the car's speed) is used to alter the control (the throttle position.) As a result, the controller cannot compensate for changes acting on the car, like a change in the slope of the road.</paragraph><paragraph>In a<space/><italics><link><target>closed-loop controller</target><part>closed-loop control system</part></link></italics>, data from a sensor monitoring the car's speed (the system output) enters a controller which continuously subtracts the quantity representing the speed from the reference quantity representing the desired speed. The difference, called the error, determines the throttle position (the control). The result is to match the car's speed to the reference speed (maintain the desired system output). Now, when the car goes uphill, the difference between the input (the sensed speed) and the reference continuously determines the throttle position. As the sensed speed drops below the reference, the difference increases, the throttle opens, and engine power increases, speeding up the vehicle. In this way, the controller dynamically counteracts changes to the car's speed. The central idea of these control systems is the<space/><italics>feedback loop</italics>, the controller affects the system output, which in turn is measured and fed back to the controller.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Classification</heading><heading level='3'>Linear versus nonlinear control theory</heading><paragraph>The field of control theory can be divided into two branches:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><italics><link><target>Linear control theory</target></link></italics><space/>- This applies to systems made of devices which obey the<space/><link><target>superposition principle</target></link>, which means roughly that the output is proportional to the input.

A major subclass is systems which in addition have parameters which do not change with time, called<space/><italics><link><target>linear time invariant</target></link></italics><space/>(LTI) systems. These systems are amenable to powerful<space/><link><target>frequency domain</target></link><space/>mathematical techniques of great generality, such as the<space/><link><target>Laplace transform</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Fourier transform</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Z transform</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Bode plot</target></link>,<space/><link><target>root locus</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Nyquist stability criterion</target></link>.

These systems are often governed by<space/><link><target>nonlinear differential equation</target><trail>s</trail></link>. The few mathematical techniques which have been developed to handle them are more difficult and much less general, often applying only to narrow categories of systems.

To abstract from the number of inputs, outputs and states, the variables are expressed as vectors and the differential and algebraic equations are written in matrix form (the latter only being possible when the dynamical system is linear). The state space representation (also known as the &quot;time-domain approach&quot;) provides a convenient and compact way to model and analyze systems with multiple inputs and outputs. With inputs and outputs, we would otherwise have to write down Laplace transforms to encode all the information about a system. Unlike the frequency domain approach, the use of the state-space representation is not limited to systems with linear components and zero initial conditions. &quot;State space&quot; refers to the space whose axes are the state variables.

Controllability is related to the possibility of forcing the system into a particular state by using an appropriate control signal. If a state is not controllable, then no signal will ever be able to control the state. If a state is not controllable, but its dynamics are stable, then the state is termed<space/><italics>stabilizable</italics>. Observability instead is related to the possibility of<space/><italics>observing</italics>, through output measurements, the state of a system. If a state is not observable, the controller will never be able to determine the behaviour of an unobservable state and hence cannot use it to stabilize the system. However, similar to the stabilizability condition above, if a state cannot be observed it might still be detectable.</paragraph><paragraph>From a geometrical point of view, looking at the states of each variable of the system to be controlled, every &quot;bad&quot; state of these variables must be controllable and observable to ensure a good behaviour in the closed-loop system. That is, if one of the<space/><link><target>eigenvalues</target></link><space/>of the system is not both controllable and observable, this part of the dynamics will remain untouched in the closed-loop system. If such an eigenvalue is not stable, the dynamics of this eigenvalue will be present in the closed-loop system which therefore will be unstable. Unobservable poles are not present in the transfer function realization of a state-space representation, which is why sometimes the latter is preferred in dynamical systems analysis.</paragraph><paragraph>Solutions to problems of uncontrollable or unobservable system include adding actuators and sensors.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Control specification</heading><paragraph>Several different control strategies have been devised in the past years.

Stability, of course, is always present: the controller must ensure that the closed-loop system is stable, regardless of the open-loop stability. A poor choice of controller can even worsen the stability of the open-loop system, which must normally be avoided. Sometimes it would be desired to obtain particular dynamics in the closed loop: i.e. that the poles have &lt;math&gt;Re[\lambda] &lt; -\overline{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;, where<space/><extension extension_name='math'>\overline{\lambda}</extension><space/>is a fixed value strictly greater than zero, instead of simply asking that &lt;math&gt;Re[\lambda]&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;.</paragraph><paragraph>Another typical specification is the rejection of a step disturbance; including an<space/><link><target>integrator</target></link><space/>in the open-loop chain (i.e. directly before the system under control) easily achieves this. Other classes of disturbances need different types of sub-systems to be included.</paragraph><paragraph>Other &quot;classical&quot; control theory specifications regard the time-response of the closed-loop system: these include the<space/><link><target>rise time</target></link><space/>(the time needed by the control system to reach the desired value after a perturbation), peak<space/><link><target>overshoot (signal)</target><part>overshoot</part></link><space/>(the highest value reached by the response before reaching the desired value) and others (<link><target>settling time</target></link>, quarter-decay).

A<space/><link><target>robust control</target><trail>ler</trail></link><space/>is such that its properties do not change much if applied to a system slightly different from the mathematical one used for its synthesis. This specification is important: no real physical system truly behaves like the series of differential equations used to represent it mathematically.

This can be done off-line: for example, executing a series of measures from which to calculate an approximated mathematical model, typically its<space/><link><target>transfer function</target></link><space/>or matrix. Such identification from the output, however, cannot take account of unobservable dynamics. Sometimes the model is built directly starting from known physical equations: for example, in the case of a<space/><link><target>Damping#Example: massspringdamper</target><part>mass-spring-damper</part></link><space/>system we know that<space/><extension extension_name='math'><space/>m \ddot{{x}}(t) = - K x(t) - \Beta \dot{x}(t)</extension>. Even assuming that a &quot;complete&quot; model is used in designing the controller, all the parameters included in these equations (called &quot;nominal parameters&quot;) are never known with absolute precision; the control system will have to behave correctly even when connected to physical system with true parameter values away from nominal.</paragraph><paragraph>Some advanced control techniques include an &quot;on-line&quot; identification process (see later). The parameters of the model are calculated (&quot;identified&quot;) while the controller itself is running: in this way, if a drastic variation of the parameters ensues (for example, if the robot's arm releases a weight), the controller will adjust itself consequently in order to ensure the correct performance.</paragraph><list type='def'><listitem><defkey>Analysis</defkey></listitem></list><paragraph>Analysis of the robustness of a SISO (single input single output) control system can be performed in the frequency domain, considering the system's transfer function and using<space/><link><target>Nyquist diagram</target><part>Nyquist</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Bode diagram</target><trail>s</trail></link>.
