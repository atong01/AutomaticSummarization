He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good.

Self-interested competition in the free market, he argued, would tend to benefit society as a whole by keeping prices low, while still building in an incentive for a wide variety of goods and services. Nevertheless, he was wary of businessmen and warned of their &quot;conspiracy against the public or in some other contrivance to raise prices&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref'>Smith, A., 1976,<space/><italics>The Glasgow edition</italics>, vol. 2a, p. 145, 158.</extension><space/>Again and again, Smith warned of the collusive nature of business interests, which may form cabals or<space/><link><target>Monopoly</target><part>monopolies</part></link>, fixing the highest price &quot;which can be squeezed out of the buyers&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref'>Smith, A., 1976,<space/><italics>The Glasgow edition</italics>, vol. 2a, p. 79.</extension><space/>Smith also warned that a business-dominated political system would allow a conspiracy of businesses and industry against consumers, with the former scheming to influence politics and legislation.

Samuelson<extension extension_name='ref'>Samuelson, P.&amp;nbsp;A./Nordhaus, William&amp;nbsp;D., 1989, idem, p. 825.</extension><space/>concluded: &quot;Smith was unable to prove the essence of his invisible-hand doctrine. Indeed, until the 1940s no one knew how to prove, even to state properly, the kernel of truth in this proposition about perfectly competitive market.&quot;</paragraph><paragraph>Very differently, classical economists see in Smith's first sentences his programme to promote &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;. Taking up the<space/><link><target>Physiocracy</target><part>physiocratical</part></link><space/>concept of the economy as a circular process means that to have growth the inputs of period2 must excel the inputs of period1. Therefore, the outputs of period1 not used or usable as input of period2 are regarded as unproductive labour as they do not contribute to growth. This is what Smith had learned in France with<space/><link><target>Franois Quesnay</target><part>Quesnay</part></link>. To this French insight that unproductive labour should be pushed back to use more labour productively, Smith added his own proposal, that productive labour should be made even more productive by deepening the<space/><link><target>division of labour</target></link>. Deepening the division of labour means under competition lower prices and thereby extended markets. Extended markets and increased production lead to a new step of reorganising production and inventing new ways of producing which again lower prices, etc., etc.. Smith's central message is therefore that under dynamic competition a growth machine secures &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;. It predicted England's evolution as the workshop of the World, underselling all its competitors. The opening sentences of the &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; summarise this policy:</paragraph><paragraph><extension extension_name='blockquote'><paragraph>The annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annually consumes ... .

But avarice and ambition in the rich, in the poor the hatred of labour and the love of present ease and enjoyment, are the passions which prompt to invade property, passions much more steady in their operation, and much more universal in their influence. Wherever there is great property there is great inequality. For one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor, and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many. The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and prompted by envy, to invade his possessions. It is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of that valuable property, which is acquired by the labour of many years, or perhaps of many successive generations, can sleep a single night in security. He is at all times surrounded by unknown enemies, whom, though he never provoked, he can never appease, and from whose injustice he can be protected only by the powerful arm of the civil magistrate continually held up to chastise it. The acquisition of valuable and extensive property, therefore, necessarily requires the establishment of civil government. Where there is no property, or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days' labour, civil government is not so necessary. Civil government supposes a certain subordination. But as the necessity of civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable property, so the principal causes which naturally introduce subordination gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable property. (...) Men of inferior wealth combine to defend those of superior wealth in the possession of their property, in order that men of superior wealth may combine to defend them in the possession of theirs. All the inferior shepherds and herdsmen feel that the security of their own herds and flocks depends upon the security of those of the great shepherd or herdsman; that the maintenance of their lesser authority depends upon that of his greater authority, and that upon their subordination to him depends his power of keeping their inferiors in subordination to them. They constitute a sort of little nobility, who feel themselves interested to defend the property and to support the authority of their own little sovereign in order that he may be able to defend their property and to support their authority. Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all.&quot; (Source: The Wealth of Nations, Book 5, Chapter 1, Part 2)</extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>In British Imperial debates</heading><paragraph>Smith's<space/><link type='external' href='http://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN17.html#B.IV,%20Ch.7,%20Of%20Colonies'>chapter on colonies</link><space/>in turn would help shape British imperial debates from the mid-nineteenth century onward.<space/><italics>The Wealth of Nations</italics><space/>would become an ambiguous text regarding the imperial question.

Included in his requirements of a government is to enforce contracts and provide justice system, grant patents and copy rights, provide public goods such as infrastructure, provide national defence and regulate banking. It was the role of the government to provide goods &quot;of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual&quot; such as roads, bridges, canals, and harbours. He also encouraged invention and new ideas through his patent enforcement and support of infant industry monopolies. He supported public education and religious institutions as providing general benefit to the society. Finally he outlined how the government should support the dignity of the monarch or chief magistrate, such that they are equal or above the public in fashion. He even states that monarchs should be provided for in a greater fashion than magistrates of a republic because &quot;we naturally expect more splendor in the court of a king than in the mansion-house of a<space/><link><target>doge</target></link>&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>harvnb</target><arg>Smith</arg><arg>1977</arg><arg name="loc">bk.
