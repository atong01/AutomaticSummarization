'''''The Time in Between''''' is a novel by [[Canada|Canadian]] author [[David Bergen]]. It deals with a man named Charles Boatman, who mysteriously returns to [[Vietnam]], where he had been a soldier earlier in his life, and his children, Ada and Jon, who also go to Vietnam to search for him.

Although generally called a [[war novel]], the author states that he "[doesn't] see ''The Time in Between'' as a war novel".<ref>[http://www.mcclelland.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780771011788]</ref>

''The Time in Between'' was the recipient of the 2005 [[Scotiabank Giller Prize]].
