The<space/><link><target>Apollo 1</target><part>AS-204 mission</part></link>, also known as &quot;Apollo 1&quot;, was intended to be the first manned flight of the Apollo program, scheduled to launch in February 1967. However, a fire in the cabin during a January 1967 test killed the crew. Manned flights were then suspended for 19 months, while the cause of the accident was investigated, and improvements were made to the spacecraft and safety procedures. Apollo 7 essentially fulfilled Apollo 1's mission.<space/></paragraph><paragraph>The Apollo 7 crew was commanded by<space/><link><target>Wally Schirra</target><part>Walter M.

Aside from the last event, which remained a mystery despite postflight testing of the commutator, all of the problems on Apollo 7 were quickly resolved and some of them also involved equipment or procedures that would not be used on subsequent missions.</paragraph><paragraph>Apollo promised the best food preparation yet seen on a manned spacecraft. For the first time, astronauts had both hot and cold water to prepare meals with (the food came in freeze-dried vacuum packs that would be injected with water or else eaten dry followed by a sip of water) and Wally Schirra, who had had only toothpaste-like tubes for food on his<space/><link><target>Mercury-Atlas 8</target><part>Mercury flight</part></link>, described the food as &quot;Still does not match home cooking, but it comes a lot closer than space food used to.&quot; Thirty-three meals were provided for the three crewmen, allowing them three meals a day for each of the 11 days in space. Even so, the astronauts complained that there was more food than they could eat and that most of it was too sweet, although the menus had been prepared based on their personal preferences. Apollo 7 was also the only time so-called &quot;astronaut ice cream&quot;, which went on to become a staple of hobby shops, was carried on an actual flight.</paragraph><paragraph>Early fears that the movement of the astronauts inside the CM would make it hard for the spacecraft's attitude control system to stabilize it proved unfounded, and they reported that motion was &quot;incredibly easy&quot; with no gravity to work against.

Tension with Schirra began with the launch decision, when flight managers decided to launch with a less than ideal abort option for the early part of the ascent. Once in orbit, the spacious cabin may have induced some crew<space/><link><target>motion sickness</target></link>, which had not been an issue in the earlier, smaller spacecraft. The crew were unhappy with their food selections, especially the high energy sweets. They also found the waste collection system cumbersome (requiring 30 minutes to use) and smelly. But the worst problem occurred when Schirra developed a severe<space/><link><target>Common cold</target><part>head cold</part></link>. As a result, he became irritable with requests from<space/><link><target>Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center#Gemini and Apollo (1965-1975)</target><part>Mission Control</part></link><space/>and all three astronauts began &quot;talking back&quot; to the CAPCOM. An early example was this exchange after Mission Control requested that a TV camera be turned on in the spacecraft:<link><target>Image:Walter Schirra on Apollo 7.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part><link><target>Walter Schirra</target></link><space/>looks out the rendezvous window in front of the commander's station on the ninth day of the mission</part></link><extension extension_name='blockquote'>SCHIRRA: You've added two burns to this flight schedule, and you've added a urine water dump; and we have a new vehicle up here, and I can tell you at this point TV will be delayed without any further discussion until after the rendezvous.<xhtml:br></xhtml:br>CAPCOM (<link><target>Jack Swigert</target></link>): Roger.

They perceived a risk that their eardrums might burst due to the sinus pressure from their colds, and they wanted to be able to pinch their noses and blow to equalize the pressure as it increased during reentry. This would have been impossible wearing the helmets, as the new Apollo helmets were a continuous &quot;fishbowl&quot; type without a moveable visor, unlike previous helmets. However, on repeated occasions over the course of the mission, Schirra was instructed that the helmets should be worn for safety reasons. In the final exchange on the subject, Mission Control made it clear to Schirra that he would be expected to account for flouting instructions:<extension extension_name='blockquote'>CAPCOM Number 1 (Deke Slayton): Okay.
