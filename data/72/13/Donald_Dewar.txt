'''Donald Campbell Dewar''' (21 August 1937 – 11 October 2000) was a Scottish politician, the inaugural [[First Minister of Scotland]] and an advocate of [[History of Scottish devolution|Scottish devolution]].

Dewar first entered politics as the Labour [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Aberdeen South (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberdeen South]] following the [[United Kingdom general election, 1966|1966 general election]]. After losing his seat in [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970]], he served in the [[House of Commons (United Kingdom)|House of Commons]] again from [[Glasgow Garscadden by-election, 1978|1978]] until his death in 2000.<ref>Chambers Biographical Dictionary, 2007</ref> He served as [[Secretary of State for Scotland]] in [[Prime Minister (UK)|British Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]]'s [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] from 1997 to 1999, successfully campaigning for a [[Scottish Parliament]] in the [[Scottish devolution referendum, 1997|1997 Scottish devolution referendum]]. 

Having led the Labour campaign in the run-up to the first [[Scottish Parliament general election, 1999|Scottish Parliament election]], he subsequently became the [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSP) for [[Glasgow Anniesland (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Anniesland]] on 6 May 1999, and was appointed [[Scottish Labour Party#Organisation|Leader of the Scottish Labour Party]] a day later and became the first Scottish First Minister as the head of a devolved coalition government with the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]]. 

He died of a [[Cerebral hemorrhage|brain hemorrhage]] while in office, and was succeeded as First Minister and Scottish Labour leader by [[Henry McLeish]].

==Biography==
Dewar was born in [[Glasgow]] on 21 August 1937 as the only child of Alisdair (1897–1973) and Mary (''née'' Bennett). His father was a [[dermatologist]] and former general practitioner. Both Dewar's parents had ill health during his childhood; his father contracted [[tuberculosis]] and his mother suffered from a benign [[brain tumour]] when Donald was young.<ref>Allan 2000, para. 5</ref> He attended the [[Glasgow Academy]], and was admitted to the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1957, where he gained a [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|MA]] degree in History in 1961, a second-class [[Bachelor of Laws|LLB]] degree in 1964, and was an editor of the ''[[Glasgow University Guardian]]''. Dewar met several future politicians at the university [[Glasgow University Dialectic Society|Dialectic Society]], including [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] (who would later become leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]), Sir [[Menzies Campbell]] (who would later become leader of the [[Liberal Democrats]]) and [[Derry Irvine, Baron Irvine of Lairg|Derry Irvine]] (who would serve as [[Lord Chancellor]] in the same cabinet as Dewar). At university, he also served as chair of the [[Glasgow University Labour Club]] and president of the [[Glasgow University Union]].

On 20 July 1964, Dewar married Alison Mary McNair, with whom he had two children: a daughter, Marion, and a son, Ian. In 1972, McNair separated from Dewar and took up a relationship with the Scottish lawyer [[Derry Irvine, Baron Irvine of Lairg|Derry Irvine]]. Dewar and his wife divorced in 1973, and he never remarried.

}}</ref> Dewar and Irvine never reconciled, even though they later served in the same [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] from May 1997 until 1999.

==Member of Parliament==
He worked as a [[solicitor]] in Glasgow after graduating from university, and was also a member of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], and he soon turned his sights towards being elected to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]]. In 1962, he was selected as the Labour candidate for the [[Aberdeen South (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberdeen South]] constituency. In the 1964 general election, he unsuccessfully contested the marginal seat of Aberdeen South. He contested it again in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1966|1966 general election]] at the age of 28, at which time he won it—defeating [[Priscilla Tweedsmuir]] by 1799 votes.

In his maiden speech to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that year, Dewar spoke against a proposed increase on potato tax. His speech became his first political success: the tax was repealed in 1967. Also in 1967, Dewar was made a [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to the [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills|Education Secretary]] [[Anthony Crosland]], with whom Dewar later confessed to having never establishing a rapport—saying Crosland was a "very odd man". Dewar remained in that position at the Department of Education until 1969, in which year Dewar opposed a visit to Aberdeen by the Springbok rugby team and staged a silent vigil near the team's ground. In April 1968, he was proposed for a [[Minister of State]] position by [[Roy Jenkins]], but was not appointed. Dewar lost his parliamentary seat to [[Iain Sproat]] at the Conservative victory in the 1970 general election by over 1000 votes.

===Out of parliament===
Dewar spent much of the 1970s looking for another parliamentary seat. He hosted a Friday evening talk show on [[Radio Clyde]], and in June 1971 was beaten by [[Dennis Canavan]] when he applied for the seat of [[West Stirlingshire]]. He worked as a [[solicitor]] for much of that decade and became a reporter on children's panels and was involved with the Lanarkshire local authority. Dewar became a partner in Ross Harper Murphy, in 1975.

In September 2009, Dennis Canavan said Dewar reacted callously when his son was diagnosed with [[skin cancer]] in 1989. The disease eventually killed him. Canavan said Dewar remarked, "Oh no! That's all we need. He was mad enough before but I shudder to think what he'll be like now."<ref>''The Herald'' 2009</ref>

===Return to Westminster===
Donald Dewar was selected for the seat [[Glasgow Garscadden (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Garscadden]] by a majority of three, after Dewar's friend the veteran Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers MP [[William Small (Scottish politician)|Willie Small]] died unexpectedly. He was returned at a [[Glasgow Garscadden by-election, 1978|by-election]] on 13 April 1978, an important victory which was seen as halting the rise of the [[Scottish National Party]]. In Scotland's first referendum on devolution, held in March 1979, he campaigned for a "Yes" vote alongside the Conservative [[Alick Buchanan-Smith (1932–1991)|Alick Buchanan-Smith]] and the Liberal [[Russell Johnston (politician)|Russell Johnston]]. Though they won a narrow majority, it fell short of the 40 per cent required, accelerating the fall of the Labour Government, in May 1979.

===Opposition===
Dewar gained a parliamentary platform as chairman of the [[Scottish Affairs Select Committee]]. After a year honing his inquisitorial skills, he joined the front bench in November 1980 as a Scottish affairs spokesman when Michael Foot became party leader. In 1981, as the Labour Party tore itself apart in a civil war, Dewar was almost deselected in his constituency by hard-left activists, but he fought off the move. He rose quickly through the ranks, becoming Shadow Scottish Secretary in November 1983. On 21 December 1988, Dewar was in Lockerbie after the bombing of [[Pan Am Flight 103]],<ref>The Scottish Government, 1998</ref> as the member of the Shadow Cabinet in charge of Scottish affairs. In 1992 John Smith made him Shadow [[Social security|Social Security]] Secretary and three years later Dewar was made a Chief Whip for the Labour Party by [[Tony Blair]].

===In government===
At the 1997 general election he became MP for [[Glasgow Anniesland (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Anniesland]], which was largely the same constituency with minor boundary changes. Labour won this election, and he was given the post of [[Secretary of State for Scotland]]. He was able to start the devolution process, and worked endlessly on creating the [[Scotland Act 1998|Scotland Act]], popularly known as Smith's "unfinished business". When ratified, this was to give Scotland its first [[Scottish Parliament|Parliament]] for nearly 300 years.

===First Minister of Scotland===

{{Quote box|quote='There shall be a Scottish parliament.' Through long years, those words were first a hope, then a belief, then a promise. Now they are a reality.|source=—Dewar, at the official opening of the Scottish Parliament on 1 July 1999.<ref>Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations</ref>|width=22em}}
[[File:Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II at the opening of the Scottish Parliament.jpg|thumb|left|Dewar (left) with [[Queen Elizabeth II]] at the opening of the [[Scottish Parliament]], July 1999]]
The first elections to the [[Scottish Parliament]] were held on 6 May 1999, with Dewar leading the Scottish Labour Party against their main opponents, the SNP under [[Alex Salmond]]. He was elected as the [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSP) for [[Glasgow Anniesland (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Anniesland]], becoming both MP and MSP for this constituency. Although Scottish Labour won more seats than any other party, they did not have a majority in Parliament to allow them to form an Executive without the help of a smaller party. A deal was agreed with the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats]] to form a coalition, with Dewar agreeing to their demand for the abolition of up-front tuition fees for university students.<ref>''The Guardian'', 1999</ref>

On 13 May, Dewar was nominated as First Minister, and was officially appointed by the Queen on 17 May at a ceremony in the [[Palace of Holyroodhouse]]. He later travelled to the [[Court of Session]] to be sworn in by the Lord President and receive the [[Great Seal of Scotland]].<ref>''BBC News'', 1999a</ref>

On 16 June, Dewar set out the legislative programme for the Executive which included: an Education bill to improve standards in Scottish schools; land reform to give right of access to the countryside, a bill to abolish the feudal system of land tenure; and a bill to establish [[National Parks]] in Scotland.<ref>''BBC News'', 1999b</ref>

===Death and funeral===
[[File:Wfm donald dewar statue.jpg|thumb|right|upright|In 2002, a {{convert|9|ft|spell=in|adj=on}} bronze statue of Dewar was erected outside Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall in a ceremony attended by Prime Minister Tony Blair and Scottish politicians.<ref>''BBC News'' 2002</ref>]]
In April 2000, Dewar was admitted to hospital for tests on his heart, following a previous test where a minor irregularity was discovered.<ref>''BBC News'' 2000a</ref> In May 2000, he had surgery to repair a leaking heart valve, and was forced to take a three-month break from Parliament, with [[Deputy First Minister of Scotland|Deputy First Minister]], [[Jim Wallace, Baron Wallace of Tankerness|Jim Wallace]] taking over as Acting First Minister.<ref>''BBC News'' 2000b</ref> He returned to work on 14 August 2000.<ref>''BBC News'' 2000c</ref>

Dewar dealt with the exam results fiasco and the lorry drivers' strike, and attended the Labour party conference in Brighton in September, but at the end of September told the historian Tom Devine in [[Dublin]] that if there was no surge of the energy of old, he would have to reappraise the situation within a few months.<ref>[http://www.electricscotland.com/history/donald_dewar.htm "Donald Dewar"], ''Electronic Scotland'', October 2000''</ref>

On 10 October 2000 around lunchtime, Dewar sustained a fall. He seemed fine at first but later that day suffered a massive [[brain haemorrhage]] which was possibly triggered by the [[anticoagulant]] medication he was taking after the heart surgery. He died the following day, in Edinburgh's [[Western General Hospital]], never having regained consciousness. He was 63 years old.

Dewar's funeral service was held at [[Glasgow Cathedral]], amid scenes of mourning unknown for a politician in Scotland's largest city. He was cremated on 18 October 2000, and his ashes were scattered at [[Lochgilphead]] in [[Argyll]].

<blockquote>"Although he has become something of a political legend, Donald would have abhorred any attempt to turn him into some kind of secular saint. He would have been horrified at a Diana-style out-pouring of synthetic grief at his untimely death."&nbsp;— [[Iain MacWhirter]], ''[[Sunday Herald]]'', 15 October 2000.
</blockquote>

===Controversies===
[[File:Kelvingrove Art Gallery and MuseumDSCF0239 01.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Head of Donald Dewar by [[Archie Forrest]] in the [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]], Glasgow]]
One of the first scandals to hit the new Scottish Parliament occurred when allegations that the lobbying arm of public relations company Beattie Media had privileged access to ministers were published, prompting Dewar to ask the standards committee to investigate the reports.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/458002.stm "Probe launched into lobbying allegations"], ''BBC News''</ref> The Minister for Finance, [[Jack McConnell]], was called to appear before the standards committee during the investigation although he was later cleared of any wrongdoing and the committee declared there was no evidence he had been influenced from lobbying by Beattie Media.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/492536.stm "Scotland Standards watchdog clears McConnell"] ''BBC News''</ref>

Dewar also threatened to sack any minister or aide who briefed the media against another member of the Scottish Executive, following public rows between Jack McConnell and the [[Minister of Health and Community Care]], [[Susan Deacon]] over the budget allocated to health .<ref>[http://www.cipfa.org.uk/publicfinance/search_details.cfm?News_id=5659&keysearch=McConnell Public Finance- 14 July 2000]</ref>

Dewar, a left of centre politician representing one of Glasgow's peripheral housing estates with high levels of deprivation, amassed a personal fortune well in excess of £2,000,000 including public utility shares, antiques and artwork worth over £400,000.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1332575/2m-legacy-of-Dewar-the-canniest-of-Scots.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Tara | last=Womersley | title=£2m legacy of Dewar, the canniest of Scots | date=2 July 2001}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Dewar's work for the Scottish Parliament has led him to be called the "[[Father of the Nation]]".<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/966880.stm | work=BBC News | title='Father of nation' dies | date=11 October 2000 | accessdate=29 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-father-of-the-nation-who-made-good-on-the-unfinished-business-of-devolution-634618.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=The Father of the Nation, who made good on the unfinished business of devolution | first=Andrew | last=Grice | date=12 October 2000 | accessdate=29 March 2010}}</ref>

In May 2002, then-Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] unveiled a statue of Dewar at the top of Glasgow's [[Buchanan Street]]. In keeping with his famous unkempt appearance, it showed Dewar wearing a slightly crushed jacket. The statue was taken down in October 2005 to be cleaned and was re-erected on {{convert|6|ft|m|sing=on}} high plinth in December in an effort to protect it. On the base of the statue were inscribed the opening words of the Scotland Act: "There Shall Be A Scottish Parliament", a phrase to which Dewar himself famously said, "I like that!"

Dewar called the [[New Parliament House, Edinburgh|Royal High School]] on [[Calton Hill]] in [[Edinburgh]] a "[[Scottish nationalist|nationalist]] [[shibboleth]]", mainly because it had been the proposed site of the [[Scottish Assembly]] in the [[Scottish devolution referendum, 1979|1979 referendum]]. Dewar's opposition to the Calton Hill site partly contributed to the selection of the [[Holyrood, Edinburgh|Holyrood]] site, [[Scottish Parliament Building#Problems|which proved expensive]].

The First ScotRail [[British Rail Class 334|Class 334]] train ''334001'' was named ''Donald Dewar'' in his memory.
