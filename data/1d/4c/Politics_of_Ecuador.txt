{{Politics of Ecuador}}
The '''Politics of Ecuador''' are [[multi-party system|multi-party]].  The central government polity is a four-yearly [[republic|elected]] [[presidential system|presidential]], unicameral [[representative democracy]]. The [[President of Ecuador]] is [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] on a [[multi-party system]], leading a cabinet with further [[executive power]]. [[Legislative power]] is not limited to the [[National Assembly (Ecuador)|National Assembly]] as it may to a lesser degree be exercised by the executive which consists of the President convening an appointed executive cabinet.  Subsequent acts of the National Assembly are supreme over Executive Orders where sufficient votes have been cast by the legislators. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.

The [[constitution of Ecuador]] provides for a four-year term of office for the President, Vice President, and members of the National Assembly with concurrent elections. Presidents and legislators may be re-elected immediately. Citizens must be at least 16 years of age to vote: [[suffrage]] is universal and compulsory for literate persons aged 18 to 65 and optional for 16 and 17 years of age and other eligible voters.

==Political conditions==
Ecuador's [[political party|political parties]] have historically been small, loose organizations that depended more on populist, often charismatic, leaders to retain support than on programs or ideology. Frequent internal splits have produced extreme factionalism. However, a pattern has emerged in which administrations from the center-left alternate with those from the center-right. Although Ecuador's political [[elite]] is highly factionalized along regional, ideological, and personal lines, a strong desire for consensus on major issues often leads to compromise. Opposition forces in Congress are loosely organized, but historically they often unite to block the administration's initiatives and to remove cabinet ministers.

Constitutional changes enacted by a specially elected National Constitutional Assembly in 1998 took effect on August 10, 1998. The new constitution strengthens the executive branch by eliminating mid-term congressional elections and by circumscribing Congress' power to challenge cabinet ministers. Party discipline is traditionally weak, and routinely many deputies switch allegiance during each Congress. However, after the new Constitution took effect, the Congress passed a Code of Ethics which imposes penalties on members who defy their party leadership on key votes.

Beginning with the 1996 election, the more indigenous, less Spanish-rooted, ethnic groups abandoned their traditional policy of shunning the official political system and participated actively. The indigenous population has established itself as a significant force in Ecuadorian politics, as shown by the selection of indigenous representative [[Nina Pacari]], who led the indigenous political party, Pachakutik, as second vice president of the 1998 Congress.

A presidential [[Ecuadorian general election, 2006|election]] was held on 15 October 2006 and November 26, 2006. [[Rafael Correa]] defeated [[Alvaro Noboa]] in a [[Two-round system|run-off election]], or second and final round. Correa won with 56.8% of the vote.<ref>"Ecuador Exit Polls Show Correa Wins Presidential Vote (Update2)" Bloomberg</ref> There was an [[2010 Ecuador crisis|attempted coup]] against President Rafael Correa in 2010.

==Judicial branch==
New justices of the Supreme Court are elected by the sitting members of the court.  A bare majority of Congress, acting in a special session called by former President [[Lucio Gutiérrez]] in December, 2004, ousted 27 of the 31 justices and replaced them with new members chosen by Congress, notwithstanding the lack of any provisions permitting impeachment of Supreme Court justices by Congress and the specific provisions giving the Court the power to select new members. Earlier, in November 2004, Congress replaced the majority of judges on the country's Electoral Court and Constitutional Court by a similar process.

After the adoption of a new Constitution in 2008, the judicial branch of the country was completely renewed. Now it has a cooperative leadership having a judicial and an administrative head. First you have the National Court of Justice, which seats 21 judges elected for a period of 9 years. They are elected by the Judiciary Council based on a merits contest held by that office. They are the final stage of any judicial process serving as a Court of Cassation and create binding precedent based on Triple Reiterative Rulings from the Chambers of the Court. The President of the Court is elected amongst the members of the Court for a Period of 3 years where he will represent the Judicial Branch before the State. The current president of the National Court of Justice is Dr. Carlos Ruiz.

Second, you have the administrative branch of the Judicial Power, which consists of The Judiciary Council. The Council is formed by 9 Vocals who are elected by the Branch of Transparency and Social Control, which is formed by the Control Authorities of the State. The Vocals are elected also by a merits contest and it shall be formed by six experts in law and 3 experts in management, economics and other related areas. However, after the National Referendum that took place on the 5th of May in 2011, the proposition impulsed by the government of Mr. Correa won and now the Judiciary Council change its formation making a constitutional amendment. Currently a Tri-Party Commission is serving as a Transitional Council with delegates from the Legislative, Executive and Transparency Branch, to reform the broken judicial system of the Country.

Finally it is wise to say that there exist a Constitutional Court. However it does not exercise legal revision, but rather constitutional control of situations where constitutional rights are violated. Also they are the sole body in the State to interpret what the Constitution says.
