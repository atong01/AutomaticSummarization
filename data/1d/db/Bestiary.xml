Originating in the<space/><link><target>Ancient history</target><part>Ancient world</part></link>, bestiaries were made popular in the<space/><link><target>Middle Ages</target></link><space/>in illustrated volumes that described various animals, birds and even rocks. The<space/><link><target>natural history</target></link><space/>and illustration of each beast was usually accompanied by a moral lesson. This reflected the belief that the world itself was the Word of God, and that every living thing had its own special meaning. For example, the<space/><link><target>pelican</target></link>, which was believed to tear open its breast to bring its young to life with its own blood, was a living representation of<space/><link><target>Jesus</target></link>.

They and other authors freely expanded or modified pre-existing models, constantly refining the moral content without interest or access to much more detail regarding the factual content. Nevertheless, the often fanciful accounts of these beasts were widely read and generally believed to be true. A few observations found in bestiaries, such as the<space/><link><target>Bird migration</target><part>migration</part></link><space/>of birds, were discounted by the natural philosophers of later centuries, only to be rediscovered in the modern scientific era.</paragraph><paragraph>Mediaeval bestiaries are remarkably similar in sequence of the animals of which they treat. Bestiaries were particularly popular in<space/><link><target>England</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>France</target></link><space/>around the 12th century and were mainly compilations of earlier texts.

Descriptions of the animals included the physical characteristics associated with the creature, although these were often physiologically incorrect, along with the Christian morals that the animal represented. The description was then normally followed with an artistic illustration of the animal as described in the bestiary.</paragraph><paragraph>Bestiaries were organized in different ways based upon the text. The descriptions could be organized by animal groupings, such as terrestrial and marine creatures, or presented in an alphabetical manner. However, the texts gave no distinction between existing and imaginary animals. Descriptions of creatures such as<space/><link><target>dragons</target></link>,<space/><link><target>unicorns</target></link>,<space/><link><target>basilisk</target></link>,<space/><link><target>griffin</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>caladrius</target></link><space/>were common in such works and found intermingled amongst accounts of bears, boars, deer, lions, and elephants.</paragraph><paragraph>This lack of separation has often been associated with the assumption that people during this time believed in what the modern period classifies as nonexistent or &quot;<link><target>imaginary creatures</target></link>&quot;. However, this assumption is currently under debate, with various explanations being offered.</paragraph><paragraph>Some scholars, such as Pamela Gravestock, have written on the theory that Medieval people didn't actually think such creatures existed but instead focused on the belief in the importance of the Christian morals these creatures represented and that the importance of the moral didn't change regardless if the animal existed or not. Other scholars have suggested that the grouping of existing and nonexistent creatures was because of the importance of the word of the Church during this time and that, even if the bestiary accounts of certain animals was found to not exist, it was crucial to continue believing in the animal because of the claim the Church made to its existence. To state that the animal in question didn't exist was to defy the truth of the word of the Church.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="reason">looks like there used to be a reference here, perhaps it's one of the sources below?<space/></arg><arg name="date">November 2014</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>The contents of Medieval bestiaries were often obtained and created from combining older textual sources and accounts of animals, such as the<space/><italics><link><target>Physiologus</target></link></italics>, with newer observations and writings.
