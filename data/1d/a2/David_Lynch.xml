When this project never came about, Lynch decided to work on a film alone, and so purchased the cheapest 16mm camera that he could find in order to do so.

As he would later relate, &quot;So I called up Bart [Wasserman] and said, 'Bart, the film is a disaster. The camera was broken and what I've done hasn't turned out.' And he said, 'Don't worry, David, take the rest of the money and make something else for me. Just give me a print.'

When you sleep, you don't control your dream. I like to dive into a dream world that I've made or discovered; a world I choose&amp;nbsp;...

Lynch stated that &quot;It was a fantastic decade in a lot of ways&amp;nbsp;... there was something in the air that is not there any more at all. It was such a great feeling, and not just because I was a kid. It was a really hopeful time, and things were going up instead of going down. You got the feeling you could do anything.
