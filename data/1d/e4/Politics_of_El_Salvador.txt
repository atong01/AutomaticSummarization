[[El Salvador]] elects its [[head of state]] &ndash; the [[President of El Salvador]] &ndash;  directly through a fixed-date general election whose winner is decided by absolute majority.  If an absolute majority (50% + 1) is not achieved by any candidate in the first round of a presidential election, then a run-off pool election is conducted 30 days later between the two candidates who obtained the most votes in the first round.  The presidential period is five years. Consecutive re-election is not permitted, though previously elected presidents may run for a second, non-consecutive term.
