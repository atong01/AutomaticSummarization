[[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral]] '''Arthur Phillip''' {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Royal Navy|RN]]}} (11 October 1738{{spaced ndash}}31 August 1814) was a [[Royal Navy]] officer, the first [[Governor of New South Wales]] and founder of the British penal colony that later became the city of [[Sydney]], Australia.<ref name=LifeMagazine1944-05-22>{{cite news |url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=bk8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA91&dq=%22Thomas+Gilbert%22+captain+pacific&num=100#v=onepage&q=%22Thomas%20Gilbert%22%20captain%20pacific&f=false

After much experience at sea, Phillip sailed with the [[First Fleet]] as Governor-designate of the proposed British penal colony of New South Wales. In January 1788, he selected its location to be [[Port Jackson]] (encompassing Sydney Harbour).<ref name="On this day">{{cite web|publisher=[[Australian Geographic]] |title=On this day: Arthur Phillip born|author=Leila Berney |url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/blogs/on-this-day/2014/10/on-this-day-arthur-phillip-born|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>

Phillip was a far-sighted governor who soon saw that New South Wales would need a civil administration and a system for emancipating the convicts. But his plan to bring skilled tradesmen on the voyage had been rejected, and he faced immense problems of labour, discipline and supply. Also his friendly attitude towards the aborigines was sorely tested when they killed his gamekeeper, and he was not able to assert a clear policy about them.

The arrival of the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second]] and [[Third Fleet (Australia)|Third]] Fleets placed new pressures on the scarce local resources, but by the time Phillip sailed home in December 1792, the colony was taking shape, with official land-grants and systematic farming and water-supply.

Phillip retired in 1805, but continued to correspond with his friends in New South Wales and to promote the colony's interests.

==Early life==
Arthur Phillip was born on 11 October 1738, the younger of two children to Jacob Phillip and Elizabeth Breach. His father Jacob was born in Frankfurt, Germany. He was a languages teacher who may also have served in the Royal Navy as an [[able seaman]] and purser's steward. His mother Elizabeth was the widow of an [[ordinary seaman]], John Herbert, who had served in Jamaica aboard HMS ''Tartar'' and died of disease on 13 August 1732. At the time of Arthur Phillip's birth, his family maintained a modest existence as tenants near [[Cheapside]] in the [[City of London]].<ref>Pembroke 2013, p.5</ref>

There are no surviving records of Phillip's early childhood. His father Jacob died in 1739, after which the Phillip family may have fallen on hard times.<ref>Parker 2009, pp.2–3</ref> On 22 June 1751 he was accepted into the [[Royal Hospital School|Greenwich Hospital School]], a charity school for the sons of indigent seafarers.<ref name="autogenerated1">Pembroke 2013, p.9</ref> In keeping with the school's curriculum, his education was focused on literacy, arithmetic and navigational skills, including cartography. He was a competent student and something of a perfectionist. His headmaster, Rev. Francis Swinden observed that in personality, Phillip was "unassuming, reasonable, business-like to the smallest degree in everything he undertakes".<ref>Correspondence, Rev. Francis Swinden, 22 June 1753, cited in Pembroke 2013, p.12</ref>

Phillip remained at the Greenwich School for two and a half years, considerably longer than the average student stay of twelve months.<ref>Parker 2009, p.4</ref> At the end of 1753 he was granted a seven-year indenture as an apprentice aboard ''Fortune'', a 210-ton whaling boat commanded by merchant mariner Wiliam Readhead. He left the Greenwich School on 1 December and spent the winter aboard ''Fortune'' awaiting the commencement of the 1754 whaling season.<ref>Pembroke 2013, p.12</ref>

==First voyages==
{{Further2|[[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War]]}}
Phillip spent the summer of 1754 hunting whales near [[Svalbard]] in the [[Barents Sea]].<ref name="Tink30">Tink 2009, pp. 30–31</ref> As an apprentice, his responsibilities included [[flensing|stripping blubber]] from whale carcasses and helping to pack it into barrels.<ref>Pembroke 2013, p.15</ref> Food was scarce and ''Fortune''{{'}}s thirty crew members supplemented their diet with bird's eggs, [[scurvy grass]] and where possible, reindeer.<ref>Frost 1987, p.16</ref> The ship returned to England on 20 July 1754. The whaling crew were paid off and replaced with twelve sailors for a winter voyage to the Mediterranean. As an apprentice, Phillip remained aboard as ''Fortune'' undertook an outward trading voyage to Barcelona and Livorno carrying salt and raisins, returning via Rotterdam with a cargo of grains and citrus.<ref>Frost 1987, p.22</ref> The ship returned to England in April 1755 and sailed immediately for Svalbard for that year's whale hunt. Phillip was still a member of the crew, but abandoned his apprenticeship when the ship returned to England on 27 July.<ref>Frost 1987, p.25</ref> On 16 October he enlisted in the Royal Navy and was assigned the rank of ordinary seaman aboard the 68-gun {{HMS|Buckingham|1751|6}}.<ref name="Parker5">Parker 2009, p.5</ref>

[[File:HMSBuckingham.jpg|250px|thumb|left|HMS ''Buckingham'', Phillip's first posting after joining the Navy in 1755. Vessel pictured on the stocks at Deptford Dockyard, c.1751.]]
As a member of ''Buckingham''{{'}}s crew, Phillip saw action in the [[Seven Years' War]], including the [[Battle of Minorca (1756)|Battle of Minorca]] in 1756. By 1762 he had transferred to {{HMS|Stirling Castle|1742|6}}, and was promoted to Lieutenant in recognition of active service in the [[Battle of Havana (1762)|Battle of Havana]].<ref name="Tink30"/> The War ended in 1763 and Phillip returned to England on half pay. In July 1763 he married Margaret Denison, a widow 16 years his senior, and established a farm in [[Lyndhurst, Hampshire]]. The marriage was unhappy, and the couple separated in 1769 when Phillip returned to the Navy.<ref name="Tink30"/> The following year he was posted as second lieutenant aboard {{HMS|Egmont|1768|6}}, a newly built 74-gun [[ship of the line]].<ref name="Tink30"/>

In 1774 Phillip joined the [[Portuguese Navy]] as a captain, serving in the [[Spanish-Portuguese War, 1776-1777|War against Spain]]. While with the Portuguese Navy, Phillip commanded a frigate, the ''Nossa Senhora do Pilar.'' On this ship he took a detachment of troops from [[Rio de Janeiro]] to [[Colonia do Sacramento]] on the [[Rio de la Plata]] (opposite [[Buenos Aires]]) to relieve the garrison there. This voyage also conveyed a consignment of convicts assigned to carry out work at Colonia. During a storm encountered in the course of the voyage, the convicts assisted in working the ship and, on arrival at Colonia, Phillip recommended that they be rewarded for saving the ship by remission of their sentences.<ref>[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=51BTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PT164&dq=%22Gazeta+de+Lisboa%22+Philips&hl=en&sa=X&ei=_3OXVbGROKXWmAXOsYD4CA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22Gazeta%20de%20Lisboa%22%20Philips&f=false ''Gazeta de Lisboa,'' 3 de Abril de 1787:] Maurine Goldston-Morris, OAM, ''The Life of Admiral Arthur Phillip, RN, 1738–1814,'' Naval Historical Society of Australia Monograph No.58, Garden Island [1997].</ref> A garbled version of this eventually found its way into the English press when Phillip was appointed in 1786 to lead the expedition to Sydney.<ref>See for example, ''The World,'' 16 April 1789: "BOTANY BAY.— Mr. ''Philip,'' who has this command, has the aid of experience. He had a similar expedition entrusted him by PORTUGAL, to carry convicts to South America.".</ref> Phillip played a leading part in the capture of the [[Spanish ship San Agustín (1768)|Spanish ship San Agustín]], on 19 April 1777, off Santa Catarina. The ''San Agustin'' was commissioned into the Portuguese Navy as the ''Santo Agostinho'', and command of her was given to Phillip. The action was reported in the English press: <blockquote>
Madrid, Aug. 28. Letters from Lisbon bring the following Account from Rio Janeiro: That the St. Augustine, of 70 Guns, having been separated from the Squadron of M. Casa Tilly, was attacked by two Portugueze Ships, against which they defended themselves for a Day and a Night, but being next Day surrounded by the Portugueze Fleet, was obliged to surrender.<ref>''The St. James's Chronicle, The London Chronicle, The Daily Advertiser, The Gazetteer and The Public Advertiser,'' 16 September 1777.</ref></blockquote>

In 1778 Britain was again at war, and Phillip was recalled to active service, and in 1779 obtained his first command, HMS ''Basilisk''. He was promoted to [[post-captain]] on 30 November 1781 and given command of {{HMS|Europa|1765|6}}.<ref>{{cite news |title =East India Trade | work =The World | page =3 | publisher =B.

In July 1782, in a change of government, [[Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney|Thomas Townshend]] became Secretary of State for Home and American Affairs, and assumed responsibility for organising an expedition against Spanish America. Like his predecessor, Lord Germain, he turned for advice to Arthur Phillip.<ref>Viscount Keppel, First Lord of the Admiralty, to Townshend, 25 September 1782; Clements Library (Ann Arbor), Sydney Papers, 9; British Library, India and Oriental, H 175, f.237.

Phillip learnt of this in April when he put in for storm repairs at Rio de Janeiro. Phillip wrote to Townshend from Rio de Janeiro on 25 April 1783, expressing his disappointment that the ending of the American War had robbed him of the opportunity for naval glory in South America.<ref>India Office Records, H 175, f.237; quoted in ''Alan Frost, Convicts & Empire: A Naval Question, 1776 1811,'' Melbourne, Oxford University Press, 1980, p.209. Phillip used the contemporary Portuguese spelling for Montevideo.</ref>

After his return to England from India in April 1784, Phillip remained in close contact with Townshend, now Lord Sydney, and the Home Office Under Secretary, Evan Nepean. From October 1784 to September 1786 he was employed by Nepean, who was in charge of the Secret Service relating to the Bourbon Powers, France and Spain, to spy on the French naval arsenals at Toulon and other ports.<ref>Frost 1987, pp. 129–133</ref> There was fear that Britain would soon be at war with these powers as a consequence of the [[Batavian Revolution]] in the Netherlands.<ref>Frost 1980, pp.115–116, 129</ref>

==Colonial service==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2011}}
At this time, [[Lord Sandwich]], together with the President of the Royal Society, Sir [[Joseph Banks]], was advocating establishment of a British colony in New South Wales.<ref>James Matra to Banks, 28 July 1783, British Library Additional MS 33979: 206. Cited in Frost 1995, p.110</ref> A colony there would be of great assistance to the British Navy in facilitating attacks on the Spanish possessions in Chile and Peru, as Banks's collaborators, James Matra, Captain Sir George Young and Sir John Call pointed out in written proposals on the subject. The British Government took the decision to found the Botany Bay colony in mid-1786. Lord Sydney, as Secretary of State for the Home Office, was the minister in charge of this undertaking, and in September 1786 he appointed Phillip commodore of the fleet which was to transport the convicts and soldiers who were to be the new settlers to Botany Bay. Upon arrival there, Phillip was to assume the powers of Captain General and Governor in Chief of the new colony. A subsidiary colony was to be founded on [[Norfolk Island]], as recommended by Sir John Call, to take advantage for naval purposes of that island's native flax and timber.

In October 1786, Phillip was appointed captain of {{HMS|Sirius|1786|6}} and named Governor-designate of [[New South Wales]], the proposed British colony on the east coast of Australia, by [[Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney|Lord Sydney]], the [[Home Secretary]].

Phillip had a very difficult time assembling the fleet which was to make the eight-month sea voyage to Australia. Everything a new colony might need had to be taken, since Phillip had no real idea of what he might find when he got there. There were few funds available for equipping the expedition. His suggestion that people with experience in farming, building and crafts be included was rejected. Most of the 772 convicts (of whom 732 survived the voyage) were petty thieves from the London slums. Phillip was accompanied by a contingent of [[Royal Marines|marines]] and a handful of other officers who were to administer the colony.

The 11 ships of the First Fleet set sail on 13 May 1787.  The leading ship, {{HMS|Supply|1759|6}} reached [[Botany Bay]] setting up camp on the [[Cronulla sand dunes, Kurnell Peninsula|Kurnell Peninsula]],<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/15100 The Voyage of Governor Phillip to Botany Bay] With an Account of the Establishment of the Colonies of [[Port Jackson]] and [[Norfolk Island]] (1789) – from [[Project Gutenberg]]</ref> on 18 January 1788. Phillip soon decided that this site, chosen on the recommendation of [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]], who had accompanied [[James Cook]] in 1770, was not suitable, since it had poor soil, no secure anchorage and no reliable water source. After some exploration Phillip decided to go on to Port Jackson, and on 26 January the marines and convicts were landed at [[Sydney Cove]], which Phillip named after Lord Sydney.

===Governor of New South Wales===
Shortly after establishing the settlement at Port Jackson, on 15 February 1788, Phillip sent Lieutenant [[Philip Gidley King]] with 8 free men and a number of convicts to establish the second British colony in the Pacific at [[Norfolk Island]]. This was partly in response to a perceived threat of losing Norfolk Island to the French and partly to establish an alternative food source for the new colony.
[[File:Arthur Phillip - Project Gutenberg eText 12992.jpg|thumbnail|left|Arthur Phillip]]
The early days of the settlement were chaotic and difficult. With limited supplies, the cultivation of food was imperative, but the soils around Sydney were poor, the climate was unfamiliar, and moreover very few of the convicts had any knowledge of agriculture. The colony was on the verge of outright [[starvation]] for an extended period. The marines, poorly disciplined themselves in many cases, were not interested in convict discipline. Almost at once, therefore, Phillip had to appoint overseers from among the ranks of the convicts to get the others working. This was the beginning of the process of convict emancipation which was to culminate in the reforms of [[Lachlan Macquarie]] after 1811.

Phillip showed in other ways that he recognised that [[New South Wales]] could not be run simply as a prison camp. Lord Sydney, often criticised as an ineffectual incompetent, had made one fundamental decision about the settlement that was to influence it from the start. Instead of just establishing it as a military prison, he provided for a civil administration, with courts of law. Two convicts, [[Henry Kable|Henry]] and [[Susannah Holmes (convict)|Susannah Kable]], sought to sue Duncan Sinclair, the captain of [[Alexander (1783 ship)|''Alexander'']], for stealing their possessions during the voyage. Convicts in Britain had no right to sue, and Sinclair had boasted that he could not be sued by them. Despite this, the court found for the plaintiffs and ordered the captain to make restitution for the loss of their possessions.<ref>{{cite web|title= Cable v. Sinclair [1788] NSWKR 7; [1788] NSWSupC 7|publisher=Macquarie University Law School|url=http://www.law.mq.edu.au/research/colonial_case_law/nsw/cases/case_index/1788/cable_v_sinclair/|accessdate=1 July 2015}}</ref>

Further, soon after Lord Sydney appointed him governor of New South Wales Arthur Phillip drew up a detailed memorandum of his plans for the proposed new colony. In one paragraph he wrote: "The laws of this country [England] will of course, be introduced in [New] South Wales, and there is one that I would wish to take place from the moment his Majesty's forces take possession of the country: That there can be no slavery in a free land, and consequently no slaves."<ref>Britton (ed.) 1978, p. 53</ref> Nevertheless, Phillip believed in discipline; floggings and hangings were commonplace, although Philip commuted many death sentences.

Phillip also had to adopt a policy towards the [[Eora]] [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal people]], who lived around the waters of [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]].<ref name="On this day"/> Phillip ordered that they must be well-treated, and that anyone killing Aboriginal people would be hanged. Phillip befriended an Eora man called [[Bennelong]],<ref name="On this day"/> and later took him to England. On the beach at [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]], a misunderstanding arose and Phillip was speared in the shoulder: but he ordered his men not to retaliate.<ref>{{cite book |title =The Governors of New South Wales | first =Andrew | last =Tink | editor=Cavalier, Rodney | year =2009 | publisher =The Federation Press | pages =42–43  | isbn =9781862877436}}</ref> Phillip went some way towards winning the trust of the Eora, although they remained wary of the settlers. Soon, a virulent disease, smallpox that was believed to be on account of the white settlers, and other European-introduced epidemics, ravaged the Eora population.

The Governor's main problem was with his own military officers, who wanted large grants of land, which Phillip had not been authorised to grant. [[Scurvy]] broke out, and in October 1788 Phillip had to send ''Sirius'' to [[Cape Town]] for supplies, and strict rationing was introduced, with thefts of food punished by hanging. Arthur Phillip quoted "The living conditions need to improve or my men won't work as hard, so I have come to a conclusion that I must hire surgeons to fix the convicts."

===Stabilising the colony===
Phillip insisted that no retaliation be taken to avenge his own non-fatal spearing. Convict John MacIntyre had been fatally speared during a hunting exposition by unknown aborigines apparently without provocation. MacIntyre swore on his death bed that he had done them no harm, but marine officer [[Watkin Tench]] was suspicious of the claim.  Tench was sent on a punitive expedition but finding no Aborigines other than [[Bennelong]] took no action.<ref name=tench>{{cite book | title=A Complete Account of the Settlement at Port Jackson | author=Watkin Tench | url=http://setis.library.usyd.edu.au/ozlit/pdf/p00044.pdf}}</ref>

Phillip, growing frustrated with the burdens of upholding a colony and his health suffering, resigned soon after this episode.<ref name="sbs.com.au">

By 1790 the situation had stabilised. The population of about 2,000 was adequately housed and fresh food was being grown. Phillip assigned a convict, [[James Ruse]], land at [[Rose Hill, New South Wales|Rose Hill]] (now [[Parramatta, New South Wales|Parramatta]]) to establish proper farming, and when Ruse succeeded he received the first land grant in the colony. Other convicts followed his example. ''Sirius'' was wrecked in March 1790 at the satellite settlement of [[Norfolk Island]], depriving Phillip of vital supplies. In June 1790 the Second Fleet arrived with hundreds more convicts, most of them too sick to work.

[[File:ArthurPhillipStatueSydney gobeirne.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Arthur Phillip in the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney]]]]
By December 1790 Phillip was ready to return to England, but the colony had largely been forgotten in London and no instructions reached him, so he carried on. In 1791 he was advised that the government would send out two convoys of convicts annually, plus adequate supplies. But July, when the vessels of the [[Third Fleet (Australia)|Third Fleet]] began to arrive, with 2,000 more convicts, food again ran short, and he had to send the ship ''[[Atlantic (1783 ship)|Atlantic]]'' to [[Calcutta]] for supplies.<ref>Hunter, Chapter XXIII</ref>

By 1792 the colony was well established, though Sydney remained an unplanned huddle of wooden huts and tents. The [[whaling|whaling industry]] was established, ships were visiting Sydney to trade, and convicts whose sentences had expired were taking up farming. [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John Macarthur]] and other officers were importing sheep and beginning to grow wool. The colony was still very short of skilled farmers, craftsmen and tradesmen, and the convicts continued to work as little as possible, even though they were working mainly to grow their own food.

In late 1792 Phillip, whose health was suffering, relinquished his governorship and sailed for England on the ship ''[[Atlantic (1783 ship)|Atlantic]]'', taking with him many specimens of plants and animals. He also took Bennelong and his friend [[Yemmerrawanne]], another young Indigenous Australian who, unlike Bennelong, would succumb to English weather and disease and not live to make the journey home. The European population of New South Wales at his departure was 4,221, of whom 3,099 were convicts. The early years of the colony had been years of struggle and hardship, but the worst was over, and there were no further famines in New South Wales. Phillip arrived in London in May 1793. He tendered his formal resignation and was granted a pension of £500 a year.<ref>Michael Pembroke, ''Arthur Phillip – Sailor, Mercenary, Governor, Spy,'' Melbourne, Hardie Grant Books, 2013.</ref>

==Later life==
Phillip's estranged wife, Margaret, had died in 1792 and was buried in St Beuno's Churchyard, Llanycil, Bala, Merionethshire.<ref>Michael Flynn, "New perspectives on Arthur Phillip, first Governor of New South Wales [Series of parts]: Part 1: Wives, graves and ghosts."  Descent, Volume 43 Issue 2 (June 2013) : 65–81.</ref>  In 1794 Phillip married Isabella Whitehead, and lived for a time at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. His health gradually recovered and in 1796 he went back to sea, holding a series of commands and responsible posts in the wars against the French. In January 1799 he became a Rear-Admiral. In 1805, aged 67, he retired from the Navy with the rank of [[Admiral of the Blue]], and spent most of the rest of his life at Bath. He continued to correspond with friends in New South Wales and to promote the colony's interests with government officials. He died in Bath in 1814.<ref>{{cite news |last=Broughton |first=W. |title=Sydney: Sitting Magistrate W. Broughton Esq. |work=The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser |page=2 |publisher=G. Howe |date=1 April 1815 |url=http://ndpbeta.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/629090 |accessdate=11 August 2007}}</ref>

Phillip was buried in [[Church of St Nicholas, Bathampton|St Nicholas's Church]], [[Bathampton]]. Forgotten for many years, the grave was discovered in 1897<ref>[http://www.stnicholasandstmarys.org.uk/ St Nicholas Church, Bathampton], Burial place of Arthur Phillip</ref> and the Premier of New South Wales, [[Henry Parkes|Sir Henry Parkes]], had it restored. An annual service of remembrance is held here around Phillip's birthdate by the [[Britain–Australia Society]] to commemorate his life.

In 2007, [[Geoffrey Robertson|Geoffrey Robertson QC]] alleged that Phillip's remains are no longer in St Nicholas Church, Bathampton and have been lost: "...Captain Arthur Phillip is not where the ledger stone says he is: it may be that he is buried somewhere outside, it may simply be that he is simply lost. But he is not where Australians have been led to believe that he now lies."<ref>[http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=262243&_cobr=optus# Lost the plot<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

[[Percival Serle]] wrote of Phillip in his ''Dictionary of Australian Biography'': 
{{quote|Steadfast in mind, modest, without self seeking, Phillip had imagination enough to conceive what the settlement might become, and the common sense to realize what at the moment was possible and expedient. When almost everyone was complaining he never himself complained, when all feared disaster he could still hopefully go on with his work. He was sent out to found a convict settlement, he laid the foundations of a great dominion.<ref name=ps-dab>{{cite web |last=Serle |first=Percival |title=Phillip, Arthur (1738–1814), admiral, and first governor of New South Wales |url=http://gutenberg.net.au/dictbiog/0-dict-biogP-Q.html#phillip1 |work=Dictionary of Australian Biography |publisher=Project Gutenberg Australia |accessdate=3 March 2011 |year=1949}}</ref>}}
