Lord Sydney, as Secretary of State for the Home Office, was the minister in charge of this undertaking, and in September 1786 he appointed Phillip commodore of the fleet which was to transport the convicts and soldiers who were to be the new settlers to Botany Bay. Upon arrival there, Phillip was to assume the powers of Captain General and Governor in Chief of the new colony. A subsidiary colony was to be founded on<space/><link><target>Norfolk Island</target></link>, as recommended by Sir John Call, to take advantage for naval purposes of that island's native flax and timber.</paragraph><paragraph>In October 1786, Phillip was appointed captain of<space/><template><target>HMS</target><arg>Sirius</arg><arg>1786</arg><arg>6</arg></template><space/>and named Governor-designate of<space/><link><target>New South Wales</target></link>, the proposed British colony on the east coast of Australia, by<space/><link><target>Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney</target><part>Lord Sydney</part></link>, the<space/><link><target>Home Secretary</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Phillip had a very difficult time assembling the fleet which was to make the eight-month sea voyage to Australia.

His suggestion that people with experience in farming, building and crafts be included was rejected.

With limited supplies, the cultivation of food was imperative, but the soils around Sydney were poor, the climate was unfamiliar, and moreover very few of the convicts had any knowledge of agriculture. The colony was on the verge of outright<space/><link><target>starvation</target></link><space/>for an extended period. The marines, poorly disciplined themselves in many cases, were not interested in convict discipline. Almost at once, therefore, Phillip had to appoint overseers from among the ranks of the convicts to get the others working. This was the beginning of the process of convict emancipation which was to culminate in the reforms of<space/><link><target>Lachlan Macquarie</target></link><space/>after 1811.</paragraph><paragraph>Phillip showed in other ways that he recognised that<space/><link><target>New South Wales</target></link><space/>could not be run simply as a prison camp. Lord Sydney, often criticised as an ineffectual incompetent, had made one fundamental decision about the settlement that was to influence it from the start. Instead of just establishing it as a military prison, he provided for a civil administration, with courts of law. Two convicts,<space/><link><target>Henry Kable</target><part>Henry</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Susannah Holmes (convict)</target><part>Susannah Kable</part></link>, sought to sue Duncan Sinclair, the captain of<space/><link><target>Alexander (1783 ship)</target><part>''Alexander''</part></link>, for stealing their possessions during the voyage. Convicts in Britain had no right to sue, and Sinclair had boasted that he could not be sued by them.

But July, when the vessels of the<space/><link><target>Third Fleet (Australia)</target><part>Third Fleet</part></link><space/>began to arrive, with 2,000 more convicts, food again ran short, and he had to send the ship<space/><italics><link><target>Atlantic (1783 ship)</target><part>Atlantic</part></link></italics><space/>to<space/><link><target>Calcutta</target></link><space/>for supplies.<extension extension_name='ref'>Hunter, Chapter XXIII</extension></paragraph><paragraph>By 1792 the colony was well established, though Sydney remained an unplanned huddle of wooden huts and tents.

He also took Bennelong and his friend<space/><link><target>Yemmerrawanne</target></link>, another young Indigenous Australian who, unlike Bennelong, would succumb to English weather and disease and not live to make the journey home. The European population of New South Wales at his departure was 4,221, of whom 3,099 were convicts. The early years of the colony had been years of struggle and hardship, but the worst was over, and there were no further famines in New South Wales. Phillip arrived in London in May 1793.
