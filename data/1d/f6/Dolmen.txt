A '''dolmen''', also known as a '''cromlech''', '''portal tomb''', '''portal grave''' or '''quoit''', is a type of single-chamber [[megalith#tomb|megalithic tomb]], usually consisting of two or more [[megalith]]s supporting a large flat horizontal capstone ("table"), although there are also more complex variants. Most date from the early [[Neolithic]] (4000-3000 BCE). Dolmens were typically covered with earth or smaller stones to form a [[tumulus]]. In many instances, that covering has weathered away, leaving only the stone "skeleton" of the burial mound intact.

It remains unclear when, why, and by whom the earliest dolmens were made. The oldest known dolmens are in Western Europe, where they were set in place around 7000 years ago. Archaeologists still do not know who erected these dolmens, which makes it difficult to know why they did it. They are generally all regarded as tombs or burial chambers, despite the absence of clear evidence for this. Human remains, sometimes accompanied by artifacts, have been found in or close to the dolmens which could be scientifically dated using [[Radiocarbon dating]]. However, it has been impossible to prove that these remains date from the time when the stones were originally set in place.<ref>Lewis, S. (2009) ''Guide to the Menhirs and other Megaliths of Central Brittany'', Nezert Books, ISBN 978–952–270–595–2</ref>

== Etymology ==
The word ''dolmen'' has a confused history. The word entered archaeology when [[Théophile Corret de la Tour d'Auvergne]] used it to describe megalithic tombs in his ''Origines gauloises'' using the spelling ''dolmin'' (the current spelling was introduced about a decade later and had become standard in French by about 1885).<ref>{{cite book|last=Bakker|first=Jan Albert|title=Megalithic Research in the Netherlands, 1547–1911|year=2009|publisher=Sidestone Press|isbn=978-9088900341 |page=36}}</ref><ref>Corret de la Tour d'Auvergne, {{google books|vmpAAAAAcAAJ|Origines gauloises. Celles des plus anciens peuples de l'Europe puisées dans leur vraie source ou recherche sur la langue, l'origine et les antiquités des Celto-bretons de l'Armorique, pour servir à l'histoire ancienne et moderne de ce peuple et à celle des Français|page=PR1}}, 1796–97.</ref> The [[OED]] does not mention "dolmin" in English and gives its first citation for "dolmen" from a book on [[Brittany]] in 1859, describing the word as "The French term, used by some English authors, for a [[cromlech]] ...".  The name was supposedly derived from a [[Breton language]] term meaning "stone table" but doubt has been cast on this, and the OED describes its origin as "Modern French". A book on [[Cornwall|Cornish]] antiquities from 1754 said that the current term in the [[Cornish language]] for a cromlech was ''tolmen'' ("hole of stone") and the OED says that "There is reason to think that this was the term inexactly reproduced by Latour d'Auvergne [sic] as ''dolmen'', and misapplied by him and succeeding French archaeologists to the ''cromlech''".<ref>[[OED]] "Dolmen", 1st edition, 1897</ref>  Nonetheless it has now replaced cromlech as the usual English term in archaeology, when the more technical and descriptive alternatives are not used.

Dolmens are known by a variety of names in other languages, including {{lang-ga|dolmain}}, [[Galician language|Galician]] and {{lang-pt|anta}}, {{lang-de|Hünengrab/Hünenbett}}, {{lang-ab|Adamra}}, [[Adyghe language|Adyghe]] Ispun, ''dysse'' ([[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]), ''dös'' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]), {{lang-ko|고인돌}} ''goindol'', and {{lang-he|גַלעֵד}}. [[:wikt:Granja|Granja]] is used in [[Portugal]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Spain]]. The rarer forms ''anta'' and ''ganda'' also appear. In the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]], they are attributed to the ''[[jentil]]ak'', a race of giants.

The [[etymology]] of the {{lang-de|Hünenbett, Hünengrab}} and {{lang-nl|Hunebed}} all evoke the image of [[Giant (mythology)|giants]] building the structures. Of other [[Celtic languages]], {{lang-cy|[[cromlech]]}} was borrowed into English and ''quoit'' is commonly used in English in [[Cornwall]].

=== Asia ===

==== Korea ====

The largest concentration of dolmen in the world is found on the [[Korean peninsula]]. With an estimated 35,000 dolmen, Korea alone accounts for nearly 40% of the world’s total.

The largest distribution of these is on the west coast area of [[South Korea]], an area that would eventually become host to the [[Mahan confederacy]] and be united under the rule of the ancient kingdom of [[Baekje]] at one time.

Three specific UNESCO World Heritage sites at [[Gochang, Hwasun and Ganghwa Dolmen Sites|Gochang, Hwasun and Ganghwa]] ( Hwasun – {{Coord|34.9775414|126.931551|display=inline}}) by themselves account for over 1,000 dolmen.<ref>UNESCO World Heritage List. "Gochang, Hwasun and Ganghwa Dolmen Sites." http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/977</ref>

The Korean word for dolmen is '''goindol''' ({{hangul|고인돌}}) "supported stone". Serious studies of the Korean megalithic monuments were not undertaken until relatively recently, well after much research had already been conducted on dolmen in other regions of the world. After 1945, new research is being conducted by Korean scholars.

Korean dolmen exhibit a morphology distinct from the Atlantic European dolmen.<ref name="JR">Joussaume, Roger ''Dolmens for the Dead''  Batsford Ltd (Jan 1988) ISBN 978-0-7134-5369-0 p. 141–142</ref>

In 1981 a curator of [[Seoul]]'s [[National Museum of Korea]], Gon'gil Ji, classified Korean dolmen into two general types: northern and southern. The boundary between them falls at the [[Bukhan River]] although examples of both types are found on either side.  Northern style dolmens stand above ground with a four sided chamber and a megalithic roof (also referred to as "table type"), while southern style dolmens are normally built into the ground and contain a stone chest or pit covered by a rock slab.<ref name="JR"/>

Korean dolmen can also be divided into three main types: the table type, the go-table type and the unsupported capstone type. The dolmen in [[Ganghwa Island|Ganghwa]] is a northern-type, table-shaped dolmen and is the biggest stone of this kind in South Korea, measuring 2.6 by 7.1 by 5.5 metres. There are many sub-types and different styles.<ref>''Megalithic Cultures in Asia'', Kim Byung-mo, 1982, Hanyang University Press</ref> Southern type dolmen are associated with burials but the reason for building northern style dolmen is uncertain.{{sfn|Holcombe|2011|p=79}}

Due to the vast numbers and great variation in styles, no absolute chronology of Korean dolmen has yet been established. It is generally accepted that the Korean megalithic culture emerged from the late [[Neolithic]] age, during which agriculture developed on the peninsula, and flourished throughout the [[Bronze Age]]. Thus, it is estimated that the Korean dolmen were built in the first millennium BC.

How and why Korea has produced so many dolmen are still poorly understood. There is no current conclusive theory on the origin of Korea's megalithic culture, and so it is difficult to determine the true cultural character of Korean dolmen. A few northern style dolmens are found in [[Manchuria]] and the [[Shandong Peninsula]]. Off the peninsula, similar specimens can be found in smaller numbers, but they are often considerably larger than the Korean dolmen.<ref>Joussaume, Roger ''Dolmens for the Dead''  Batsford Ltd (Jan 1988) ISBN 978-0-7134-5369-0 p. 280</ref> It is a mystery why this culture flourished so extensively only on the Korean peninsula and its vicinity in [[Northeast Asia]].

[[File:Dolmen Russia r.Jane.JPG|thumb|Dolmen in the Zhane river valley, Russia]]
{{see also|Dolmens of North Caucasus|Dolmens of Russia}}
Over 3,000 dolmens and other structures can be found in the North-Western Caucasus region in Russia, where more and more dolmens are discovered in the mountains each year. These Dolmens are related to the Maykop culture. This great city of Dolmens was built along the shores of the Black Sea from Maykop down to Sochi. The inhabitants were metal workers. The Dolmens were vaults or safes of stone, with a narrow circular entrance that could be tapped with a round screw of stone. Supposedly the dolmens were used to hide and protect metal objects: gold, silver, bronze, jewels and some other treasure. Trade of these objects was done with Persia, Assyria, Egypt and Crete.The Dolmen City was pillaged and sacked by Scythian invaders in the early first millennium BC. The metal workers were enslaved.

==== Middle East ====
Dolmens are also found in [[Israel]], [[Syria]] and [[Jordan]]. Numerous large dolmens can be viewed in the Israeli National park at [[Gamla]].<ref>http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=30954</ref><ref>Oldest archaeological org in Israel: http://www.hadashot-esi.org.il/report_detail_eng.aspx?id=1164&mag_id=115</ref>

There are many examples of flint dolmens in the historical villages of [[Johfiyeh]] and [[Natifah]] in northern [[Jordan]]. The greatest number of dolmens are around Madaba, like the ones at Al Faiha village, 10&nbsp;km to the west of Madaba city {{YouTube|pdI37Izo4UM|see Madaba dolmens}}. Two dolmens are in Hisbone, and the most have been found at Zarqa Ma'in at Al-Murayghat, which are being destroyed by gravel quarries {{YouTube|X5qv06H7AwA|see where have all the dolmens gone?}} .

==== Horn of Africa ====
In northern [[Somalia]], the town of Aw Barkhadle, named in honour of the 13th century scholar and saint [[Yusuf bin Ahmad al-Kawneyn]] (Aw Barkhadle), is surrounded by a number of ancient structures. Among these are dolmens, burial mounds, [[menhir]]s (standing stones), and [[stela]]e.<ref name="Btgpb">{{cite book|last=Briggs|first=Phillip|title=Somaliland|year=2012|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=1841623717|page=98|url=http://www.google.com/books?id=M6NI2FejIuwC}}</ref>

In northern [[Tunisia]], [[Dougga]] is an important ancient site, which contains a [[necropolis]] with dolmens. The settlement also features a sanctuary dedicated to [[Baal#Ba.27al of Carthage|Ba'al Hammon]], neo-Punic stelae, the mausoleum, architectural fragments, and a temple dedicated to [[Masinissa]], the remains of which were found during archaeological excavations.

=== Europe ===
{{see also|Dolmens of Western Pomerania}}
[[Megalithic]] [[tomb]]s are found from the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[North Sea]] coasts south to Spain and Portugal. ''Hunebedden'' are [[chamber tomb]]s similar to dolmens and date to the middle [[Neolithic]] ([[Funnelbeaker culture]], 4th millennium BC). They consist of a [[Megalithic architectural elements|kerb]] surrounding an [[Oval (geometry)|oval]] mound, which covered a [[rectangle|rectangular]] chamber of stones with the entrance on one of the long sides. Some have a more complex layout and include an entrance passage giving them a T-shape. It has been suggested that this means they are related to the [[passage grave]]s found in [[Denmark]] and elsewhere.

The Wikipedia image is many years more recent than the educational website image.</ref>]]
Dolmen sites fringe the [[Irish Sea]] and are found in south-east [[Ireland]], [[Wales]], Devon and Cornwall. In Ireland, however, more dolmens are found on the west coast, particularly in the [[The Burren|Burren]]—and [[Connemara]], which includes some of the better-known examples, such as [[Poulnabrone dolmen]]. Examples, such as the [[Annadorn Dolmen|Annadorn dolmen]], have also been found in northern Ireland, where they may have co-existed with the [[court cairn]] tombs.

Many examples appear on the [[Channel Islands]] of [[Jersey]] and [[Guernsey]], such as La Pouquelaye de Faldouet, La Sergenté, and La Hougue des Géonnais. The term Houge derives from the [[Old Norse]] word ''haugr,'' meaning a mound or barrow. The most famous of these sites is [[La Hougue Bie]], a 6,000-year-old neolithic site that sits inside a large mound; later a chapel was built on the top of the mound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.viking.no/e/france/contribution.html |title=The Scandinavian Contribution in Normandy |publisher=Viking.no |date=|accessdate=2013-03-15}}</ref>

Amongst the vast Neolithic collections of the [[Carnac stones]] in [[Brittany]], [[France]], several dozen dolmens are found. And all around the country, several dolmens still stand, such as the ones of Passebonneau and des Gorces near [[Saint-Benoît-du-Sault]].

Various [[menhir]]s and dolmens are located around the [[Mediterranean]] islands of [[Malta]] and [[Gozo]]. Pottery uncovered in these structures allowed the attribution of the monuments to the Tarxien cemetery culture of the [[Early Bronze Age]].<ref>Journal of European Archaeology (JEA), 5 (1997); Emilia Pásztor and Curt Roslund: ''Orientation of Maltese dolmens''.</ref> This later culture is not to be confused with the [[Neolithic]] inhabitants of Malta, who built the [[Tarxien Temples]] circa [[3100 BC]].

In [[France]], important megalithic zones are situated in Brittany, Vendée, Quercy and in the south of France (Languedoc, Rouergue and Corsica). More than 10,000 dolmens and menhirs cover a large part of the country (west and south). Importants menhirs alignments in Brittany (Carnac's alignments count more than 1,000 menhirs)

In Spain dolmens can be found in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] (such as ''Axeitos'', pictured below), [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and [[Navarre]] (like the ''Sorgin Etxea'') and the basque name for theme is ''Trikuharri'' or ''Jentiletxe'', [[Catalonia]] (like [[Cova d'en Daina]] or ''Creu d'en Cobertella''), [[Andalusia]] (like the ''[[Cueva de Menga]]'') and [[Extremadura]] (like "Dolmen de Lácara").

Dolmens can be found across Portugal, from simple ones <ref>{{cite web|author=Česky |url= http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Dolmen#Portugal |title=Dolmen – Wikimedia Commons |publisher= Commons.wikimedia.org |date=|accessdate=2013-03-15}}</ref> to the more complex examples of megalithic architecture, such as the [[Almendres Cromlech]] or the [[Anta Grande do Zambujeiro]].

In [[Mecklenburg]] and [[Pomerania]]/[[Pomorze]] in (Germany) and (Poland), [[Drenthe]] (Netherlands), large numbers of these graves were disturbed when harbours, towns, and cities were built. The boulders were used in construction and road building. Others, such as the [[Harhoog]], in [[Sylt]], were moved to new locations. There are still many thousands left today in Europe.
[[File:Dolmen di Avola.JPG|left|thumb|250px|Dolmen of ''Avola'', Sicily]]
[[File:Dolmenmontebubbonia.jpg|right|thumb|Dolmen of ''Monte Bubbonia'', Sicily]] 
In Italy dolmens can be found in [[Apulia]], [[Sardinia]] and in [[Sicily]]. In this latter region there are small dolmens located in '''''Mura Pregne''''' (Palermo), '''Sciacca''' (Agrigento), '''''Monte Bubbonia''''' (Caltanissetta), '''Butera''' (Caltanissetta),  '''''Cava dei Servi''''' (Ragusa), '''''Cava Lazzaro''''' (Siracusa), '''[[Avola]]''' (Siracusa).<ref>Salvatore Piccolo, ''Ancient Stones'', op. cit.</ref> 
[[File:The Cava dei Servi dolmen (Ragusa-Sicily).jpg|right|thumb|250px|Dolmen of ''Cava dei Servi'', Sicily]]In the area named '''''Cava dei Servi''''' was found an atypical dolmen, away from the trilithic characteristic shape; it's a semi oval monument formed by four rectangular slabs fixed into the ground. Another three slabs are on top, leaning in such a way they reduce the surface and form a ''false dome''; two large parallelepiped boulders complete the construction. This type of prehistoric architecture is present in a vast area of the Mediterranean (Spain, Sardinia, Apulia, Malta) and in the ''Cava dei Servi'' monument, is evidence of use as a tomb.<ref>Salvatore Piccolo, ''ibidem'', pages 13 onwards.</ref>

In Turkey, there are some dolmens in the Regions of Lalapasa and Suloglu in the Province of Edirne and the Regions of KOfcaz, Kirklareli and Demirkoy in the Province of  Kirklareli, in the Eastern Thrace. They have been studied by Prof. Dr. Engin Beksaç, since 2004. And also,  some of so-called monuments are in the different regions of Anatolia, in Turkey.

There are interesting dolmens in the regions related to the [[Sakar Mountain|Sakar]] and [[Rhodope Mountains|Rhodope]] and [[Strandja Mountain|Strandzha]] Mountains in Bulgaria.

The largest dolmen in Europe is the [[Brownshill Dolmen]] in [[County Carlow]], Ireland. Its capstone weighs about 150 tonnes.<ref>{{cite book | last=Weir|first= A| year=1980 |title=Early Ireland. A Field Guide | publisher=Blackstaff Press | location=Belfast | page=101}}</ref>

[[Lanyon Quoit]] is a dolmen in Cornwall, 2 miles southeast of Morvah. It stands next to the road leading from Madron to Morvah.  The capstone rested at 7 feet high with dimensions of 9 feet by 17.5 feet weighing 13.5 tons.
