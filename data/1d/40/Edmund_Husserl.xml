This '<link><target>a priori and a posteriori</target><part>a priori</part></link>' interconnection of bodies, given in perception, is what founds the interconnection of consciousnesses known as transcendental intersubjectivity, which Husserl would go on to describe at length in volumes of unpublished writings. There has been a debate over whether or not Husserl's description of ownness and its movement into intersubjectivity is sufficient to reject the charge of solipsism, to which Descartes, for example, was subject. One argument against Husserl's description works this way: instead of infinity and the Deity being the ego's gateway to the Other, as in Descartes, Husserl's ego in the<space/><italics>Cartesian Meditations</italics><space/>itself becomes transcendent.

He analyzes the psychological process needed to obtain the concept of number and then tries to build up a systematical theory on this analysis. To achieve this he uses several methods and concepts taken from his teachers. From Weierstrass he derives the idea that we generate the concept of number by counting a certain collection of objects.</paragraph><paragraph>From Brentano and Stumpf he takes over the distinction between<space/><italics>proper</italics><space/>and<space/><italics>improper</italics><space/>presenting. In an example Husserl explains this in the following way: if you are standing in front of a house, you have a proper, direct presentation of that house, but if you are looking for it and ask for directions, then these directions (e.g. the house on the corner of this and that street) are an indirect, improper presentation. In other words, you can have a proper presentation of an object if it is actually present, and an improper (or symbolic as he also calls it) if you only can indicate that object through signs, symbols, etc. Husserl's<space/><italics><link><target>Logical Investigations (Husserl)</target><part>Logical Investigations</part></link></italics><space/>(19001901) is considered the starting point for the formal theory of wholes and their parts known as<space/><link><target>mereology</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>citation</target><arg name="first">Peter<space/></arg><arg name="last">Simons<space/></arg><arg name="author-link">Peter Simons (professor)<space/></arg><arg name="title">Parts: A Study in Ontology<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Oxford University Press<space/></arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Another important element that Husserl took over from Brentano is<space/><link><target>intentionality</target></link>, the notion that the main characteristic of<space/><link><target>consciousness</target></link><space/>is that it is always intentional. While often simplistically summarised as &quot;aboutness&quot; or the relationship between mental acts and the external world, Brentano defined it as the main characteristic of<space/><italics>mental phenomena</italics>, by which they could be distinguished from<space/><italics>physical phenomena</italics>. Every mental phenomenon, every psychological act, has a content, is directed at an object (the<space/><italics><link><target>intentional object</target></link></italics>). Every belief, desire, etc. has an object that it is about: the believed, the wanted. Brentano used the expression &quot;intentional inexistence&quot; to indicate the status of the objects of thought in the mind. The property of being intentional, of having an intentional object, was the key feature to distinguish mental phenomena and physical phenomena, because physical phenomena lack intentionality altogether.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">October 2013</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='3'>The elaboration of phenomenology</heading><paragraph>Some years after the 19001901 publication of his main work, the<space/><italics>Logische Untersuchungen</italics><space/>(<italics>Logical Investigations</italics>), Husserl made some key conceptual elaborations which led him to assert that in order to study the structure of consciousness, one would have to distinguish between the act of consciousness and the phenomena at which it is directed (the objects as intended). Knowledge of<space/><link><target>essence</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>would only be possible by &quot;<link><target>bracketing (phenomenology)</target><part>bracketing</part></link>&quot; all assumptions about the existence of an external world. This procedure he called<space/><italics><link><target>epoch</target></link></italics>. These new concepts prompted the publication of the<space/><italics>Ideen</italics><space/>(<italics>Ideas</italics>) in 1913, in which they were at first incorporated, and a plan for a second edition of the<space/><italics>Logische Untersuchungen</italics>.</paragraph><paragraph>From the<space/><italics>Ideen</italics><space/>onward, Husserl concentrated on the ideal, essential structures of consciousness. The metaphysical problem of establishing the reality of what we perceive, as distinct from the perceiving subject, was of little interest to Husserl in spite of his being a<space/><link><target>Transcendental idealism</target><part>transcendental idealist</part></link>. Husserl proposed that the world of objects and ways in which we direct ourselves toward and perceive those objects is normally conceived of in what he called the &quot;natural standpoint&quot;, which is characterized by a belief that objects exist distinct from the perceiving subject and exhibit properties that we see as emanating from them. Husserl proposed a radical new phenomenological way of looking at objects by examining how we, in our many ways of being intentionally directed toward them, actually &quot;constitute&quot; them (to be distinguished from materially creating objects or objects merely being figments of the imagination); in the Phenomenological standpoint, the object ceases to be something simply &quot;external&quot; and ceases to be seen as providing indicators about what it is, and becomes a grouping of perceptual and functional aspects that imply one another under the idea of a particular object or &quot;type&quot;. The notion of objects as real is not expelled by phenomenology, but &quot;bracketed&quot; as a way in which we regard objects<template><target>emdash</target></template>instead of a feature that inheres in an object's essence founded in the relation between the object and the perceiver. In order to better understand the world of appearances and objects, phenomenology attempts to identify the invariant features of how objects are perceived and pushes attributions of reality into their role as an attribution about the things we perceive (or an assumption underlying how we perceive objects). The major dividing line in Husserl's thought is the turn to transcendental idealism.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Boer1978"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="author">Theodorus Boer</arg><arg name="title">The Development of Husserl's Thought</arg><arg name="url">http://books.google.com/books?id</arg><arg name="accessdate">18 April 2013</arg><arg name="date">31 December 1978</arg><arg name="publisher">Springer</arg><arg name="isbn">978-90-247-2039-2</arg><arg name="page">121</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>In a later period, Husserl began to wrestle with the complicated issues of<space/><link><target>intersubjectivity</target></link>, specifically, how communication about an object can be assumed to refer to the same ideal entity (<italics><link><target>Cartesian Meditations</target></link></italics>, Meditation V).

He identified several different kinds of names. For example, there are names that have the role of properties that uniquely identify an object. Each of these names expresses a meaning and designates the same object. Examples of this are &quot;the victor in Jena&quot; and &quot;the loser in Waterloo&quot;, or &quot;the equilateral triangle&quot; and &quot;the equiangular triangle&quot;; in both cases, both names express different meanings, but designate the same object. There are names which have no meaning, but have the role of designating an object: &quot;Aristotle&quot;, &quot;Socrates&quot;, and so on. Finally, there are names which designate a variety of objects. These are called &quot;universal names&quot;; their meaning is a &quot;<link><target>concept</target></link>&quot; and refers to a series of objects (the extension of the concept). The way we know sensible objects is called &quot;<link><target>Noumenon</target><part>sensible intuition</part></link>&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>Husserl also identifies a series of &quot;formal words&quot; which are necessary to form<space/><link><target>Sentence (linguistics)</target><part>sentences</part></link><space/>and have no sensible correlates. Examples of formal words are &quot;a&quot;, &quot;the&quot;, &quot;more than&quot;, &quot;over&quot;, &quot;under&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;group&quot;, and so on. Every sentence must contain formal words to designate what Husserl calls &quot;formal categories&quot;. There are two kinds of categories: meaning categories and formal-<link><target>ontological</target></link><space/>categories. Meaning categories relate judgments; they include forms of<space/><link><target>Grammatical conjunction</target><part>conjunction</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Logical disjunction</target><part>disjunction</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Plural</target><part>forms of plural</part></link>, among others. Formal-ontological categories relate objects and include notions such as set,<space/><link><target>Cardinal number (linguistics)</target><part>cardinal number</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Ordinal number (linguistics)</target><part>ordinal number</part></link>, part and whole, relation, and so on. The way we know these categories is through a faculty of understanding called &quot;categorial intuition&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>Through sensible intuition our<space/><link><target>consciousness</target></link><space/>constitutes what Husserl calls a &quot;situation of affairs&quot; (<italics>Sachlage</italics>). It is a passive constitution where objects themselves are presented to us. To this situation of affairs, through categorial intuition, we are able to constitute a &quot;state of affairs&quot; (<italics>Sachverhalt</italics>). One situation of affairs through objective acts of consciousness (acts of constituting categorially) can serve as the basis for constituting multiple states of affairs. For example, suppose<space/><italics>a</italics><space/>and<space/><italics>b</italics><space/>are two sensible objects in a certain situation of affairs. We can use it as basis to say, &quot;<italics>a</italics>&lt;<italics>b</italics>&quot; and &quot;<italics>b</italics>&gt;<italics>a</italics>&quot;, two judgments which designate the same state of affairs.

Mathematics, on the other hand, is formal ontology; it studies all the possible forms of being (of objects). Hence for both logic and mathematics, the different formal categories are the objects of study, not the sensible objects themselves. The problem with the psychological approach to mathematics and logic is that it fails to account for the fact that this approach is about formal categories, and not simply about abstractions from sensibility alone. The reason why we do not deal with sensible objects in mathematics is because of another faculty of understanding called &quot;categorial abstraction.&quot; Through this faculty we are able to get rid of sensible components of judgments, and just focus on formal categories themselves.</paragraph><paragraph>Thanks to &quot;eidetic intuition&quot; (or &quot;essential intuition&quot;), we are able to grasp the possibility, impossibility, necessity and contingency among concepts and among formal categories. Categorial intuition, along with categorial abstraction and eidetic intuition, are the basis for logical and mathematical knowledge.</paragraph><paragraph>Husserl criticized the logicians of his day for not focusing on the relation between subjective processes that give us objective knowledge of pure logic.

In the same letter, Frege used the review of Schrder's book to analyze Husserl's notion of the sense of reference of concept words. Hence Frege recognized, as early as 1891, that Husserl distinguished between sense and reference. Consequently, Frege and Husserl independently elaborated a theory of sense and reference before 1891.</paragraph><paragraph>Commentators argue that Husserl's notion of<space/><link><target>noema</target></link><space/>has nothing to do with Frege's notion of sense, because<space/><italics>noemata</italics><space/>are necessarily fused with<space/><link><target>noesis</target><part>noeses</part></link><space/>which are the conscious activities of consciousness.<space/><italics>Noemata</italics><space/>have three different levels:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>The substratum, which is never presented to the consciousness, and is the support of all the properties of the object;</listitem><listitem>The<space/><italics>noematic</italics><space/>senses, which are the different ways the objects are presented to us;</listitem><listitem>The<space/><link><target>Modal logic</target><part>modalities</part></link><space/>of being (possible, doubtful, existent, non-existent, absurd, and so on).</listitem></list><paragraph>Consequently, in intentional activities, even non-existent objects can be constituted, and form part of the whole noema.

Moreover, Husserl did not maintain that predicates of sentences designate concepts. According to Frege the reference of a sentence is a truth value; for Husserl it is a &quot;state of affairs.&quot; Frege's notion of &quot;sense&quot; is unrelated to Husserl's noema, while the latter's notions of &quot;meaning&quot; and &quot;object&quot; differ from those of Frege.</paragraph><paragraph>In detail, Husserl's conception of logic and mathematics differs from that of Frege, who held that<space/><link><target>arithmetic</target></link><space/>could be derived from logic.

Husserl pointed out that the failure of<space/><link><target>Anti-psychologism</target><part>anti-psychologists</part></link><space/>to defeat psychologism was a result of being unable to distinguish between the foundational, theoretical side of logic, and the applied, practical side.

Psychologists have also not been successful in showing how from<space/><link><target>Inductive reasoning</target><part>induction</part></link><space/>or psychological processes we can justify the absolute certainty of logical principles, such as the principles of identity and non-contradiction. It is therefore futile to base certain logical laws and principles on uncertain processes of the mind.</paragraph><paragraph>This confusion made by psychologism (and related disciplines such as<space/><link><target>Biological determinism</target><part>biologism</part></link><space/>and anthropologism) can be due to three specific prejudices:</paragraph><paragraph>1. The first prejudice is the supposition that logic is somehow normative in nature. Husserl argues that logic is theoretical, i.e., that logic itself proposes<space/><italics>a priori</italics><space/>laws which are themselves the basis of the normative side of logic. Since mathematics is related to logic, he cites an example from mathematics: If we have a formula like &quot;(a + b)(a b) = a b&quot; it does not tell us how to think mathematically. It just expresses a truth. A proposition that says: &quot;The product of the sum and the difference of a and b<space/><italics>should</italics><space/>give us the difference of the squares of a and b&quot; does express a normative proposition, but this normative statement<space/><italics>is based on</italics><space/>the theoretical statement &quot;(a + b)(a b) = a b&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>2. For psychologists, the acts of judging,<space/><link><target>reason</target><trail>ing</trail></link>, deriving, and so on, are all psychological processes. Therefore, it is the role of psychology to provide the foundation of these processes. Husserl states that this effort made by psychologists is a &quot;metbasis eis llo gnos&quot; (<link><target>Ancient Greek</target><part>Gr.</part></link><space/>, &quot;a transgression to another field&quot;).<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">September 2010</arg></template><space/>It is a metbasis because psychology cannot possibly provide any foundations for<space/><italics>a priori</italics><space/>laws which themselves are the basis for all the ways we should think correctly. Psychologists have the problem of confusing intentional activities with the object of these activities. It is important to distinguish between the act of judging and the judgment itself, the act of counting and the number itself, and so on. Counting five objects is undeniably a psychological process, but the number 5 is not.</paragraph><paragraph>3. Judgments can be true or not true. Psychologists argue that judgments are true because they become &quot;evidently&quot; true to us. This evidence, a psychological process that &quot;guarantees&quot; truth, is indeed a psychological process. Husserl responds by saying that truth itself as well as logical laws always remain valid regardless of psychological &quot;evidence&quot; that they are true. No psychological process can explain the<space/><italics>a priori</italics><space/>objectivity of these<space/><link><target>logical truth</target><trail>s</trail></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>From this criticism to psychologism, the distinction between psychological acts and their intentional objects, and the difference between the normative side of logic and the theoretical side, derives from a<space/><link><target>Platonism</target><part>platonist</part></link><space/>conception of logic. This means that we should regard logical and mathematical laws as being independent of the human mind, and also as an autonomy of meanings. It is essentially the difference between the real (everything subject to time) and the ideal or irreal (everything that is atemporal), such as logical truths, mathematical entities, mathematical truths and meanings in general.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Influence</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Grabmal Edmund Husserl Freiburg Gnterstal.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>250px</part><part>Husserl's gravestone at<space/><link><target>Freiburg</target><part>Freiburg Gnterstal</part></link></part></link>David Carr of<space/><link><target>Yale University</target></link><space/>commented in 1970 on Husserl's following: &quot;It is well known that Husserl was always disappointed at the tendency of his students to go their own way, to embark upon fundamental revisions of phenomenology rather than engage in the communal task&quot; as originally intended by the radical new science.<extension extension_name='ref'>Carr, David (1970) &quot;Translator's Introduction&quot; xvxlii, at xxv, to Edmund Husserl,<space/><italics>The Crisis of European Science and Transcendental Phenomenology</italics>.
