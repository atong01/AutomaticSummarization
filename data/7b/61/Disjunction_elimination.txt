:''For the [[theorem]] of [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]] which expresses Disjunction elimination, see [[Case analysis]]''.

In [[propositional logic]], '''disjunction elimination'''<ref>https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Rule_of_Or-Elimination</ref><ref>http://www.cs.gsu.edu/~cscskp/Automata/proofs/node6.html</ref> (sometimes named '''proof by cases''', '''case analysis''', or '''or elimination'''), is the [[validity|valid]] [[argument form]] and [[rule of inference]] that allows one to eliminate a [[logical disjunction|disjunctive statement]] from a [[formal proof|logical proof]]. It is the [[inference]] that  if a statement <math>P</math> implies a statement <math>Q</math> and a statement <math>R</math> also implies <math>Q</math>, then if either <math>P</math> or <math>R</math> is true, then <math>Q</math> has to be true. The reasoning is simple: since at least one of the statements P and R is true, and since either of them would be sufficient to entail Q, Q is certainly true.

:If I'm inside, I have my wallet on me.
:If I'm outside, I have my wallet on me.
:It is true that either I'm inside or I'm outside.
:Therefore, I have my wallet on me.

It is the rule can be stated as:

:<math>\frac{P \to Q, R \to Q, P \or R}{\therefore Q}</math>

where the rule is that whenever instances of "<math>P \to Q</math>", and "<math>R \to Q</math>" and "<math>P \or R</math>" appear on lines of a proof, "<math>Q</math>" can be placed on a subsequent line.

== Formal notation ==
The ''disjunction elimination'' rule may be written in [[sequent]] notation:

: <math>(P \to Q), (R \to Q), (P \or R) \vdash Q</math>

where <math>\vdash</math> is a [[metalogic]]al symbol meaning that <math>Q</math> is a [[logical consequence|syntactic consequence]] of <math>P \to Q</math>, and <math>R \to Q</math> and <math>P \or R</math> in some logical system;

and expressed as a truth-functional [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] or theorem of propositional logic:

:<math>(((P \to Q) \and (R \to Q)) \and (P \or R)) \to Q</math>

where <math>P</math>, <math>Q</math>, and <math>R</math> are propositions expressed in some [[formal system]].
