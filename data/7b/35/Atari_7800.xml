The reality was that a contractual issue arose in that GCC had not been paid for their development of the 7800.

In May 1985, Jack relented and paid GCC the overdue payment.

Depending on various parameters, each individual sprite can use from 1 to 12 colors, with 3 colors (plus a 4th &quot;transparency&quot; color) being the most common. In this format, the sprite is referenced to one of 8 palettes, where each palette holds 3 assignable colors. There is also an assignable background color, which will be visible wherever another object has not covered it up. In total the system can utilize 25 colors on a scanline at one time.<extension extension_name='ref' name="atarimuseum.com">http://www.atarimuseum.com/ahs_archives/archives/archives-techdocs-7800.htm</extension></paragraph><paragraph>The graphics resolution, color palette assignments, and background color can be adjusted in between scanlines.

While the inclusion of 2600 hardware is required to maintain compatibility with the older system, this drove up production costs and reduced available space on the 7800s motherboard. As such, the 7800 does not include additional hardware for generating sound as it does with graphics and the sound hardware is considered the weakest part of the system.</paragraph><paragraph>To compensate for this, GCCs engineers allowed games to include a<space/><link><target>Atari POKEY</target><part>POKEY audio chip</part></link><space/>in the cartridge which substantially improved the audio quality. To ensure software developers had an economical means of producing better sound than TIA, GCC had originally planned to make a low-cost, high performance sound chip, GUMBY, which could also be placed in 7800 cartridges to enhance its sound capabilities further. This project was cancelled when Atari was sold to Jack Tramiel.</paragraph><paragraph>Despite having the capability to support sound chips in cartridges, almost no 7800 cartridges feature POKEY hardware for enhanced sound.<space/><italics>Ballblazer</italics>, released in 1987, uses the POKEY to generate all music and sound effects. Similarly,<space/><italics><link><target>Commando (video game)</target><part>Commando</part></link></italics>, released in 1989, uses a POKEY to generate in-game music while the TIA generates the game's sound effects for a total of 6 channels of sound.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Lockout features</heading><paragraph>Following the debate over<space/><italics><link><target>Custer's Revenge</target></link></italics>, an Atari 2600 VCS title with adult themes, Atari had concerns over similar adult titles finding their way onto the 7800 and displaying adult graphics on the significantly improved graphics of the MARIA chip.<template><target>citation-needed</target><arg name="date">August 2015</arg></template><space/>To combat this, they included a digital signature protection method which prevented unauthorized 7800 games from being played on the system.</paragraph><paragraph>When a cartridge was inserted into the system, the 7800 BIOS included code which would generate a digital signature of the cartridge ROM and compare it to the signature stored on the cartridge. If a correct signature was located on the cartridge, the 7800 would operate in 7800 mode, granting the game access to MARIA and other features. If a signature was not located, the 7800 remained in 2600 mode and MARIA was unavailable. All 7800 games released in North America had to be digitally signed by Atari. This digital signature code is not present in PAL 7800s, which use various heuristics to detect 2600 cartridges, due to export restrictions.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">October 2013</arg></template><space/>The signing utility was found and released by Classic Gaming Expo in 2001.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="last">Boris</arg><arg name="first">Dan</arg><arg name="title">The Encryption Issue</arg><arg name="url">http://atarihq.com/danb/a7800.shtml#encryption</arg><arg name="work">Atari 7800 Tech Page</arg><arg name="accessdate">2 October 2013</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Backward compatibility</heading><paragraph>The Atari 7800 differs from the 2600 in several key areas. It features a full Atari SALLY 6502 processor whereas the 2600 VCS has a stripped-down 6507 processor running at a slower speed. It has additional<space/><link><target>RAM</target></link><space/>(Random Access Memory) and the ability to access more cartridge data at one time than the 2600. The most substantial difference, however, is a graphics architecture which differs markedly from either the Atari 2600 VCS or Ataris 8-bit line of computers.</paragraph><paragraph>The 7800's compatibility with the Atari 2600 is made possible by including many of the same chips used in the Atari 2600. When operating in 2600 mode to play Atari 2600 titles, the 7800 uses a Television Interface Adapter (TIA) chip to generate graphics and sound. The processor is slowed to 1.19&amp;nbsp;MHz, enabling the 7800 to mirror the performance of the 2600's stripped-down 6507 processor. RAM is limited to 128 bytes found in the RIOT and game data is accessed in 4K blocks.</paragraph><paragraph>When in 7800 mode (signified by the appearance of the full-screen Atari logo), the graphics are generated entirely by the MARIA graphics processing unit, all system RAM is available and game data is accessed in larger 48K blocks. The systems SALLY 6502 runs at its normal 1.79&amp;nbsp;MHz instead of the reduced speed of 2600 mode. The 2600 chips are used in 7800 mode to generate sound as well as switch and controller interfaces.</paragraph><paragraph>The Atari 7800 does not support backward compatibility for Atari 5200 games or accessories.</paragraph><heading level='3'>System revisions</heading><paragraph>Prototypes:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>Atari 3600, original model number</listitem><listitem>Atari CX-9000 Video Computer System</listitem></list><paragraph>Production:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>Atari CX7800, two joystick ports on lower front panel.

The lack of awareness of the system, the lack of understanding of the hardware, and fears about the digital signature lockout initially caused concerns.

When the original digital signature generating software was turned over to the Atari community, development of new Atari 7800 titles began. In addition, the Atari community has slowly uncovered the original 7800 development tools and released them into the public domain. New tools, documentation, source code and utilities for development have since been created which has sponsored additional homebrew development. Several new commercial Atari 7800 titles such as Beef Drop, B*nQ, Pac Man Collection, Combat 1990, Santa Simon, and Space War have been created and released.</paragraph><paragraph>System compatible hardware has also been produced for the system. Among these was the Cuttle Cart II, a device that allowed the Atari 7800 to read MMC cards containing binary files of Atari 7800 programs. The Cuttle Cart II has enabled more people to play the entire 2600 and 7800 library on an original system as well as binaries of unreleased games and new homebrew titles. The Cuttle Cart II was a success by homebrew standards, selling out both production runs and commanding high prices on eBay.</paragraph><paragraph>A more recent development is the Atari 7800 expansion module developed by Legacy Engineering with a high scores save feature (with compatible games), additional RAM capabilities, as well as vastly improved sound capabilities using the<space/><link><target>POKEY</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Yamaha YM2151</target><part>YM2151</part></link><space/>sound chips.
