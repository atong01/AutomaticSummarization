As fragile nations are unable to equitably and effectively perform the functions of a state, these countries are much more prone to violent unrest and mass inequality. Additionally, in countries with high levels of inequality (a common problem in countries with inadequate governing institutions), much higher growth rates are needed to reduce the rate of poverty when compared with other nations. Not to mention, after removing China and India from the equation, up to 70% of the world's poor live in fragile states by some definitions of fragility.

Recognizing the problems that plagued the LDCs over the past decade, the conference formulated a new set of national and international policies to accelerate the growth rates of the poorest nations. These new principles were embodied in the &quot;Paris Declaration and Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>United Nations.<space/><link type='external' href='http://www.cinu.org.mx/temas/desarrollo/dessocial/ldc/ldc2_en.pdf'>&quot;Paris Declaration and Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1900s&quot;</link>, 1992.</extension></paragraph><paragraph><bold><italics>4th UN LDC Conference</italics></bold></paragraph><paragraph>The most recent conference, held in May 2011 in Istanbul, recognized that the nature of development had fundamentally changed since the 1st conference held almost 30 years earlier. In the 21st century, the capital flow into emerging economies has increasingly become dominated by foreign direct investment and remittances, as opposed to bilateral and multilateral assistance. Moreover, since the 80s, significant structural changes have taken place on the international stage. With the creation of the G-20 conference of the largest economic powers, including many nations in the Global South, formerly &quot;undeveloped&quot; nations are now able to have a much larger say in international relations. Furthermore, the conference recognized that in the midst of a deep global recession, coupled with multiple crises (energy, climate, food, etc.), the international community would have fewer resources to aid the LDCs. Thus, the UN considered the participation of a wide range of stakeholders (not least the LDCs themselves), crucial to the formulation of the conference.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Organizations working to end extreme poverty</heading><heading level='3'>International organizations</heading><heading level='4'>World Bank</heading><paragraph>In 2013, the Board of Governors of the<space/><link><target>World Bank Group</target></link><space/>(WBG) set two overriding goals for the WBG to commit itself to in the future. First, to end extreme poverty by 2030, an objective that echoes the sentiments of the UN and the Obama administration. Additionally, the WBG set an interim target of reducing extreme poverty to below 9 percent by 2020. Second, to focus on growth among the bottom 40 percent of people, as opposed to standard GDP growth. This commitment ensures that the growth of the developing world lifts people out of poverty, rather than exacerbating inequality.<extension extension_name='ref' name="worldbank1"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>As the World Bank's primary focus is on delivering economic growth to enable equitable prosperity, its developments programs are primarily commercial-based in nature, as opposed to the UN. Since the World Bank recognizes better jobs will result in higher income and thus, less poverty, the WBG seeks to support employment training initiatives, small business development programs and strong labor protection laws. However, since much of the growth in the developing world has been inequitable, the World Bank has also begun teaming with client states to map out trends in inequality and to propose public policy changes that can level the playing field.<extension extension_name='ref'>World Bank.<space/><link type='external' href='http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty/overview#2'>&quot;Poverty Overview&quot;</link>, 2014.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Moreover, the World Bank engages in a variety of nutritional, transfer payments and transport-based initiatives. Children who experience under-nutrition from conception to two years of age have a much higher risk of physical and mental disability. Thus, they are often trapped in poverty and are unable to make a full contribution to the social and economic development of their communities as adults. The WBG estimates that as much as 3% of GDP can be lost as a result of under-nutrition among the poorest nations. To combat undernutrition, the WBG has partnered with UNICEF and the WHO to ensure all small children are fully feed. The WBG also offers conditional cash transfers to poor households who meet certain requirements such as maintaining children's healthcare or ensuring school attendance. Finally, the WBG understands investment in public transportation and better roads is key to breaking rural isolation, improving access to healthcare and providing better job opportunities for the World's poor.<extension extension_name='ref'>World Bank.<space/><link type='external' href='http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2013/02/05/povertyreductioninpractice'>&quot;Poverty Reduction in Practice: How and Where We Work&quot;</link>, February 19, 2013.</extension></paragraph><heading level='4'>UN</heading><paragraph><bold><italics>1.
