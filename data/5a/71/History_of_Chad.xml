Early in the 19th century, Baguirmi fell into decay and was threatened militarily by the nearby kingdom of Ouaddai.

Early in the 12th century, groups in the region rallied to<space/><link><target>Abd al-Karim Sabun</target></link>, who overthrew the ruling<space/><link><target>Tunjur</target></link><space/>group, transforming Ouaddai in an Islamic<space/><link><target>sultan</target><trail>ate</trail></link>.

Sabun's successors were less able than he, and Darfur took advantage of a disputed political succession in 1838 to put its own candidate in power. This tactic backfired when Darfur's choice,<space/><link><target>Muhammad Sharif of Ouaddai</target><part>Muhammad Sharif</part></link>, rejected Darfur and asserted his own authority.

The more conservative<space/><link><target>Chadian Democratic Union</target></link><space/>(UDT) was founded in November 1947 and represented French commercial interests and a bloc of traditional leaders composed primarily of Muslim and<space/><link><target>Ouaddai Kingdom</target><part>Ouaddaan</part></link><space/>nobility.

Already in January 1962 he banned all political parties except his own PPT, and started immediately concentrating all power in his own hands. His treatment of opponents, real or imagined, was extremely harsh, filling the prisons with thousands of political prisoners.</paragraph><paragraph>What was even worse was his constant discrimination against the central and northern regions of Chad, where the southern Chadian administrators came to be perceived as arrogant and incompetent. This resentment at last exploded in a tax revolt on November 1, 1965, in the<space/><link><target>Gura Prefecture</target></link>, causing 500 deaths. The year after saw the birth in<space/><link><target>Sudan</target></link><space/>of the<space/><link><target>FROLINAT</target><part>National Liberation Front of Chad</part></link><space/>(FROLINAT), created to militarily oust Tombalbaye and the Southern dominance. It was the start of a bloody civil war.</paragraph><paragraph>Tombalbaye resorted to calling in French troops; while moderately successful, they were not fully able to quell the insurgency.

As a consequence on April 13, 1975, several units of N'Djamena's<space/><link><target>gendarmerie</target></link><space/><link><target>Chadian coup of 1975</target><part>killed Tombalbaye during a coup</part></link>.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Military rule (1975&amp;ndash;78)</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Malloum's military government</arg></template>The<space/><link><target>coup d'tat</target></link><space/>that terminated Tombalbaye's government received an enthusiastic response in<space/><link><target>N'Djamena</target></link>.

Malloum was ousted from the presidency, but the resulting civil war amongst the 11 emergent factions was so widespread that it rendered the central government largely irrelevant. At that point, other African governments decided to intervene.</paragraph><paragraph>A series of four international conferences held first under Nigerian and then<space/><link><target>Organization of African Unity</target></link><space/>(OAU) sponsorship attempted to bring the Chadian factions together.

However, Goukounis January 1981 statement that Chad and<space/><link><target>Libya</target></link><space/>had agreed to work for the realization of complete unity between the two countries generated intense international pressure and Goukouni's subsequent call for the complete withdrawal of external forces.</paragraph><heading level='2'>The Habr era (1982&amp;ndash;90)</heading><list type='ident'><listitem><italics>see:<space/><link><target>Chadian-Libyan conflict</target></link></italics></listitem></list><paragraph>Libya's partial withdrawal to the<space/><link><target>Aozou Strip</target></link><space/>in northern Chad cleared the way for Habr's forces to enter NDjamena in June.

In September 1984, the French and the Libyan governments announced an agreement for the mutual withdrawal of their forces from Chad.

Goukouni also began to rally toward Habr, and with his support Habr successfully expelled Libyan forces from most of Chadian territory. A cease-fire between Chad and Libya held from 1987 to 1988, and negotiations over the next several years led to the 1994 International Court of Justice decision granting Chad sovereignty over the Aouzou strip, effectively ending Libyan occupation.</paragraph><heading level='2'>The Dby era</heading><heading level='3'>Rise to power</heading><paragraph>However, rivalry between<space/><link><target>Hadjerai</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Zaghawa people</target><part>Zaghawa</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Gorane</target></link><space/>groups within the government grew in the late 1980s.

Government forces clashed violently with rebel forces, including the Movement for Democracy and Development, MDD, National Revival Committee for Peace and Democracy (CSNPD), Chadian National Front (FNT) and the Western Armed Forces (FAO), near<space/><link><target>Lake Chad</target></link><space/>and in southern regions of the country. Earlier French demands for the country to hold a National Conference resulted in the gathering of 750 delegates representing political parties (which were legalized in 1992), the government, trade unions and the army to discuss the creation of a pluralist democratic regime.</paragraph><paragraph>However, unrest continued, sparked in part by large-scale killings of civilians in southern Chad. The CSNPD, led by<space/><link><target>Kette Moise</target></link><space/>and other southern groups entered into a peace agreement with government forces in 1994, which later broke down. Two new groups, the<space/><link><target>Armed Forces for a Federal Republic</target></link><space/>(FARF) led by former Kette ally<space/><link><target>Laokein Barde</target></link><space/>and the Democratic Front for Renewal (FDR), and a reformulated MDD clashed with government forces from 1994 to 1995.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Multiparty elections</heading><paragraph>Talks with political opponents in early 1996 did not go well, but Dby announced his intent to hold presidential elections in June. Dby won the countrys first multi-party presidential elections with support in the second round from opposition leader Kebzabo, defeating General Kamougue (leader of the 1975 coup against Tombalbaye). Dbys MPS party won 63 of 125 seats in the January 1997 legislative elections. International observers noted numerous serious irregularities in presidential and legislative election proceedings.</paragraph><paragraph>By mid-1997 the government signed peace deals with FARF and the MDD leadership and succeeded in cutting off the groups from their rear bases in the Central African Republic and Cameroon. Agreements also were struck with rebels from the National Front of Chad (FNT) and Movement for Social Justice and Democracy in October 1997. However, peace was short-lived, as FARF rebels clashed with government soldiers, finally surrendering to government forces in May 1998. Barde was killed in the fighting, as were hundreds of other southerners, most civilians.</paragraph><paragraph>Since October 1998, Chadian Movement for Justice and Democracy (MDJT) rebels, led by<space/><link><target>Youssuf Togoimi</target></link><space/>until his death in September 2002, have skirmished with government troops in the Tibesti region, resulting in hundreds of civilian, government, and rebel casualties, but little ground won or lost. No active armed opposition has emerged in other parts of Chad, although Kette Moise, following senior postings at the Ministry of Interior, mounted a smallscale local operation near<space/><link><target>Moundou</target></link><space/>which was quickly and violently suppressed by government forces in late 2000.</paragraph><paragraph>Dby, in the mid-1990s, gradually restored basic functions of government and entered into agreements with the<space/><link><target>World Bank</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>International Monetary Fund</target><part>IMF</part></link><space/>to carry out substantial economic reforms. Oil exploitation in the southern Doba region began in June 2000, with World Bank Board approval to finance a small portion of a project, the<space/><link><target>Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development Project</target></link>, aimed at transport of Chadian crude through a 1000-km. buried pipeline through Cameroon to the<space/><link><target>Gulf of Guinea</target></link>. The project established unique mechanisms for World Bank, private sector, government, and civil society collaboration to guarantee that future oil revenues benefit local populations and result in poverty alleviation. Success of the project depended on<space/><link type='external' href='http://go.worldbank.org/5MGHQ1ZQ01'>multiple monitoring efforts</link><extension extension_name='ref'>International Advisory Group, External Compliance Monitoring Group, Collge de Contrle et de Surveillance des Revenues Ptroliers (CCSRP), World Bank Inspection Panel, Comit Technique National de Suivi et de Contrle (CTNSC).</extension><space/>to ensure that all parties keep their commitments.

Having accused the government of fraud, six opposition leaders were arrested (twice) and one opposition party activist was killed following the announcement of election results. However, despite claims of government corruption, favoritism of Zaghawas, and abuses by the security forces, opposition party and labor union calls for general strikes and more active demonstrations against the government have been unsuccessful. Despite movement toward democratic reform, power remains in the hands of a northern ethnic oligarchy.</paragraph><paragraph>In 2003, Chad began receiving refugees from the<space/><link><target>Darfur</target></link><space/>region of western Sudan.
