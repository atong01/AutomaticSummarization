[[Image:Lorenz attractor yb.svg|thumb|200px|right||A plot of Lorenz's [[strange attractor]] for values ρ=28, σ = 10, β = 8/3. The butterfly effect or sensitive dependence on initial conditions is the property of a [[dynamical system]] that, starting from any of various arbitrarily close alternative [[initial condition]]s on the attractor, the [[iteration#mathematics|iterated points]] will become arbitrarily spread out from each other.]]

In [[chaos theory]], the '''butterfly effect''' is the sensitive dependence on [[initial condition]]s in which a small change in one state of a deterministic [[nonlinear system]] can result in large differences in a later state. The name of the effect, coined by [[Edward Lorenz]], is derived from the metaphorical example of the details of a hurricane (exact time of formation, exact path taken) being influenced by minor perturbations such as the flapping of the wings of a distant [[butterfly]] several weeks earlier. Lorenz discovered the effect when he observed that runs of his [[Numerical weather prediction|weather model]] with initial condition data that was rounded in a seemingly inconsequential manner would fail to reproduce the results of runs with the unrounded initial condition data. A very small change in initial conditions had created a significantly different outcome.

The butterfly effect is exhibited by very simple systems. For example, the [[randomness]] of the outcomes of throwing [[dice]] depends on this characteristic to amplify small differences in initial conditions—the precise direction, thrust, and orientation of the throw—into significantly different dice paths and outcomes, which makes it virtually impossible to throw dice exactly the same way twice.

==History==
[[Chaos theory]] and the sensitive dependence on initial conditions were described in the literature in a particular case of the [[three-body problem]] by [[Henri Poincaré]] in 1890.<ref name="wolframscience.com">[http://www.wolframscience.com/reference/notes/971c Some Historical Notes: History of Chaos Theory]</ref> He later proposed that such phenomena could be common, for example, in meteorology.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Steves |first1=Bonnie |last2=Maciejewski | first2=AJ |date=September 2001 |title=The Restless Universe Applications of Gravitational N-Body Dynamics to Planetary Stellar and Galactic Systems |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=-wa120qRW5wC |location=USA |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=0750308222 |accessdate=January 6, 2014 }}</ref>

In 1898,<ref name="wolframscience.com"/> [[Jacques Hadamard]] noted general divergence of trajectories in spaces of negative curvature. [[Pierre Duhem]] discussed the possible general significance of this in 1908.<ref name="wolframscience.com"/> The idea that one [[butterfly]] could eventually have a far-reaching [[ripple effect]] on subsequent historic events made its earliest known appearance in "[[A Sound of Thunder]]", a 1952 short story by [[Ray Bradbury]] about time travel ([[Butterfly effect in popular culture#Literature and print|see Literature and print here]]).

In 1961, Lorenz was running a numerical computer model to redo a weather prediction from the middle of the previous run as a shortcut. He entered the initial condition 0.506 from the printout instead of entering the full precision 0.506127 value. The result was a completely different weather scenario.<ref>{{cite book |first=James |last=Gleick |title=Chaos: Making a New Science |location= |publisher=Viking |year=1987 |isbn=0-8133-4085-3 |page=16}}</ref> In 1963 Lorenz published a theoretical study of this effect in a highly cited, seminal paper called ''Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow''<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lorenz|first=Edward N.|title=Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences|date=March 1963|volume=20|issue=2|pages=130–141|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0469%281963%29020%3C0130%3ADNF%3E2.0.CO%3B2|accessdate=3 June 2010|doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020<0130:DNF>2.0.CO;2|bibcode = 1963JAtS...20..130L|issn=1520-0469}}</ref><ref>[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Deterministic+non-periodic+flow&author=E.+N.+Lorenz&publication_year=1963 Google Scholar citation record]</ref> (the calculations were performed on a [[Royal McBee]] [[LGP-30]] computer).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~smillie/ComputerAndMe/Part19.html |title=Part19 |publisher=Cs.ualberta.ca |date=1960-11-22 |accessdate=2014-06-08}}</ref><ref name="Lorenz1963" /> Elsewhere he stated {{quote| text=One meteorologist remarked that if the theory were correct, one flap of a [[Gull|sea gull]]'s wings would be enough to alter the course of the weather forever.

According to Lorenz, when he failed to provide a title for a talk he was to present at the 139th meeting of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1972, Philip Merilees concocted ''Does the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?'' as a title.<ref>[http://eaps4.mit.edu/research/Lorenz/Butterfly_1972.pdf Lorenz: "Predictability", AAAS 139th meeting, 1972] Retrieved May 22, 2015</ref> Although a butterfly flapping its wings has remained constant in the expression of this concept, the location of the butterfly, the consequences, and the location of the consequences have varied widely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.ap42.com/2011/08/03/the-butterfly-effect-variations-on-a-meme/|title=The Butterfly Effects: Variations on a Meme|accessdate=3 August 2011|work=[http://blog.ap42.com AP42 ...and everything]}}</ref>

The phrase refers to the idea that a butterfly's wings might create tiny changes in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] that may ultimately alter the path of a [[tornado]] or delay, accelerate or even prevent the occurrence of a tornado in another location. The butterfly does not power or directly create the tornado. The term is not intended to imply—as is often misconstrued—that the flap of the butterfly's wings ''causes'' the tornado. The flap of the wings is a part of the initial conditions; one set of conditions leads to a tornado while the other set of conditions doesn't. The flapping wing represents a small change in the initial condition of the system, which cascades to large-scale alterations of events (compare: [[domino effect]]). Had the butterfly not flapped its wings, the trajectory of the system might have been vastly different—it's possible that the set of conditions without the butterfly flapping its wings is the set that leads to a tornado.

The butterfly effect presents an obvious challenge to prediction, since initial conditions for a system such as the weather can never be known to complete accuracy. This problem motivated the development of [[ensemble forecasting]], in which a number of forecasts are made from perturbed initial conditions.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Woods|first=Austin|title=Medium-range weather prediction: The European approach; The story of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts |page=118 |location=New York |publisher=Springer |year=2005 |isbn=978-0387269283 }}</ref>

Some scientists have since argued that the weather system is not as sensitive to initial condition as previously believed.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Orrell|first=David| last2=Smith | first2 = Leonard | last3=Barkmeijer | first3 = Jan | last4 = Palmer | first4 = Tim | title=Model error in weather forecasting|journal=Nonlinear Proc.

==Theory and mathematical definition==
[[Poincaré recurrence theorem|Recurrence]], the approximate return of a system towards its initial conditions, together with sensitive dependence on initial conditions, are the two main ingredients for chaotic motion. They have the practical consequence of making [[complex system]]s, such as the [[weather]], difficult to predict past a certain time range (approximately a week in the case of weather) since it is impossible to measure the starting atmospheric conditions completely accurately.

A [[dynamical system]] displays sensitive dependence on initial conditions if points arbitrarily close together separate over time at an exponential rate. The definition is not topological, but essentially metrical.

If ''M'' is the [[State space (dynamical system)|state space]] for the map <math>f^t</math>, then <math>f^t</math> displays sensitive dependence to initial conditions if for any x in ''M'' and any δ&nbsp;>&nbsp;0, there are y in ''M'', with distance ''d''(. , .) such that <math>0 < d(x, y) < \delta </math> and such that

:<math>d(f^\tau(x), f^\tau(y)) > \mathrm{e}^{a\tau} \, d(x,y)</math>

for some positive parameter ''a''. The definition does not require that all points from a neighborhood separate from the base point ''x'', but it requires one positive [[Lyapunov exponent]].

The simplest mathematical framework exhibiting sensitive dependence on initial conditions is provided by a particular parametrization of the [[logistic map]]:

:<math>x_{n+1} = 4 x_n (1-x_n) , \quad 0\leq x_0\leq 1,</math>

which, unlike most chaotic maps, has a [[closed-form solution]]:

:<math>x_{n}=\sin^{2}(2^{n} \theta \pi)</math>

where the [[initial condition]] parameter <math>\theta</math> is given by <math>\theta = \tfrac{1}{\pi}\sin^{-1}(x_0^{1/2})</math>. For rational <math>\theta</math>, after a finite number of [[iterated function|iterations]] <math>x_n</math> maps into a [[periodic point|periodic sequence]]. But almost all <math>\theta</math> are irrational, and, for irrational <math>\theta</math>, <math>x_n</math> never repeats itself &ndash; it is non-periodic. This solution equation clearly demonstrates the two key features of chaos &ndash; stretching and folding: the factor 2<sup>''n''</sup> shows the exponential growth of stretching, which results in sensitive dependence on initial conditions (the butterfly effect), while the squared sine function keeps <math>x_n</math> folded within the range&nbsp;[0,&nbsp;1].

==Examples==
The butterfly effect is most familiar in terms of [[weather]]; it can easily be demonstrated in standard weather prediction models, for example.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/11/chaos-and-climate/ |title=Chaos and Climate |publisher=RealClimate |date= |accessdate=2014-06-08}}</ref>

The potential for sensitive dependence on initial conditions (the butterfly effect) has been studied in a number of cases in [[Semiclassical physics|semiclassical]] and [[quantum mechanics|quantum physics]] including atoms in strong fields and the anisotropic [[Kepler problem]].<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Postmodern Quantum Mechanics |first=E.
