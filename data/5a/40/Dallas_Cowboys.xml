Angry with Marshall, Breeskin approached Murchisons attorney to sell him the rights to the song before the expansion vote in 1959. Murchison purchased &quot;Hail to the Redskins&quot; for $2,500. Before the vote to award franchises in 1959, Murchison revealed to Marshall that he owned the song and Marshall could not play it during games.

Despite dropping 2 of their last 3 regular season games, the Cowboys would clinch their first number 1 NFC seed in 12 years which also granted them a first round bye and homefield advantage throughout the playoffs. However they would lose in the Divisional Round 21-17 to the eventual Super Bowl Champion Giants.</paragraph><paragraph>In the tumultuous 2008 season, the Cowboys started off strong, going 30 for the second straight year, en route to a 41 start.

Despite entering December with a record of 83, Dallas lost its slim grip on 1st place in the division with losses to the New York Giants and San Diego. Talks of past December collapses resurfaced, and another collapse in 2009 seemed validated. However, the Dallas team surged in the final three weeks of the season with a 2417 victory at the Superdome, ending New Orleans' previously unbeaten season in week 15. For the first time in franchise history, Dallas posted back-to-back shutouts when they beat division rivals Washington (170) and Philadelphia (240) to end the season. In the process, the Cowboys clinched their second NFC East title in three years as well as the third seed in the NFC Playoffs. Six days later, in the wild-card round of the playoffs, Dallas played the Eagles in a rematch of week 17. The Cowboys defeated the Eagles for the first Cowboys' post-season win since the 1996 season, ending a streak of six consecutive NFL post-season losses.

In week 2 Dallas traveled to San Francisco to play the 49ers. In the middle of the 2nd quarter, while the Cowboys trailed 107, Tony Romo suffered a rib injury and was replaced by Jon Kitna. Kitna threw 1 Touchdown and 2 interceptions until Romo returned in the 3rd quarter as Dallas trailed 177. Romo then threw 3 touchdown passes to Miles Austin as the Cowboys rallied to send the game into overtime.

In Week 5 they lost a shootout to eventual AFC Champion Denver Broncos 51-48. They battled it out with Philadelphia for control of the division throughout the season. In December however they lost 2 crucial back to back games to Chicago and Green Bay. They were very successful in division games having a 5-0 division record heading into another Week 17 showdown for the NFC East crown against the Eagles. That included beating Washington 24-23 on Week 16 thanks to late game heroics of<space/><link><target>Tony Romo</target></link>. However Romo received a severe back injury in that game which prematurely ended his season. The Cowboys called upon backup QB<space/><link><target>Kyle Orton</target></link><space/>to lead them into battle on the final week of the season. Orton was unsuccessful who threw a game ending interception to the Eagles which allowed Philly to win 24-22. Dallas ended the year at 8-8 for the third year in a row.

This was Seattle's 2nd loss at home in the past 3 seasons. The streak was ended by division rival Washington on Week 8 where the Redskins won in overtime 20-17. Romo's back became once again injured in that game. He would miss the next week where the Cowboys lost at home to the Arizona Cardinals 28-17 where backup QB<space/><link><target>Brandon Weeden</target></link><space/>started.

Both teams were vying for first place in the division with identical 8-3 records. The Eagles got off to a fast start and the Cowboys were unable to catch up, losing 33-10. They would rebound the next week where on the road Thursday night game they defeated Chicago 41-28 for their 9th win of the year to clinch their first winning season since 2009. This was the first time that Dallas played on back to back Thursdays. Week 15 was a rematch against 1st place Philadelphia. This time it was the Cowboys who got off to a fast start going up 21-0. Then the Eagles put up 24 answered points but Dallas came back to win 38-27 to go into first place for the first time in the season and improve to 10-4. Going into their Week 16 matchup at home against Indianapolis, Dallas was in a position to clinch their first division title since 2009 by defeating the Colts thanks to the Eagles losing that week to the Redskins. They would not disappoint as they blew out the Colts 42-7 to become the 2014 NFC East Champions, eliminating the Eagles from the playoffs. Dallas would end the regular season with a 12-4 record and an 8-0 away record when they won on the road against Washington 44-17. They would also finish December 4-0 which was huge for the Cowboys since they had struggled in the recent years in the month of December.</paragraph><paragraph>On January 4, 2015, the Cowboys, as the number 3 seed, hosted the number 6 seed<space/><link><target>Detroit Lions</target></link><space/>in the wild card round of the<space/><link><target>2014&amp;ndash;15 NFL playoffs</target><part>NFL playoffs</part></link>. In the game, the Lions got off to a hot start, going up 14-0 in the first quarter. Dallas initially struggled on both sides of the ball. However, towards the end of the second quarter Romo threw a 76-yard touchdown pass to Terrance Williams.<space/><link><target>Matt Prater</target></link><space/>of the Lions would kick a field goal before halftime to go up 17-7. Dallas came out swinging to start the second half by picking off Detroit quarterback<space/><link><target>Matthew Stafford</target></link><space/>on the first play of the third quarter. However, the Cowboys failed to capitalize on the turnover, as Dan Bailey missed a field goal during Dallas's ensuing drive. Detroit then kicked another field goal to make the score 20-7. A DeMarco Murray touchdown later in that quarter closed the gap to 20-14. A 51-yard Bailey field goal almost 3 minutes into the fourth quarter trimmed the Cowboys' deficit to 3. The Lions got the ball back and started driving down the field. On 3rd down-and-1 of that Lions drive, Stafford threw a 17-yard pass intended for Lions tight end<space/><link><target>Brandon Pettigrew</target></link>, but the ball hit Cowboys linebacker<space/><link><target>Anthony Hitchens</target></link><space/>in the back a fraction of a second before he ran into Pettigrew. The play was initially flagged as defensive pass interference against Hitchens. However, the penalty was then nullified by the officiating crew. The Cowboys got the ball back on their 41-yard line and had a successful 59-yard drive which was capped off by a 8-yard touchdown pass from Romo to Williams to give the Cowboys their first lead of the game at 24-20. The Lions got the ball back with less than 2:30 to play in regulation. Stafford fumbled the ball at the 2 minute mark. The fumble was recovered by Cowboys defensive end<space/><link><target>DeMarcus Lawrence</target></link>, who then fumbled the ball which was recovered by the Lions. Lawrence would redeem himself by sacking Stafford on a 4th down-and-3 play. The sack led to Stafford fumbling the ball again, which Lawrence recovered to seal the game for the Cowboys, who won 24-20. This was the first time in franchise playoff history that that Dallas had been down by 10 or more points at halftime and rallied to win the game. The following week, the Cowboys traveled to<space/><link><target>Lambeau Field</target></link><space/>in<space/><link><target>Green Bay, Wisconsin</target></link><space/>to play the<space/><link><target>Green Bay Packers</target><part>Packers</part></link><space/>in the divisional round. Despite having a 14-7 halftime lead, the Cowboys fell to the Packers 26-21, thus ending their season. The season ended on an overturned call of a completed catch by Dez Bryant. The catch was challenged by the Packers, and the referees overturned the call because of the &quot;Calvin Johnson rule.&quot;</paragraph><paragraph>During the 2015 offseason the Cowboys allowed running back<space/><link><target>DeMarco Murray</target></link><space/>to become a free agent.

During the same season, the Cowboys also wore their 196063 road jersey with a silver helmet for one game as part of a league-wide &quot;throwback&quot; policy.</paragraph><paragraph>During the 1995 season, the team wore the navy &quot;Double-Star&quot; jersey for games at Washington and Philadelphia and permanently switched to solid color socks (royal blue for the white uniform, and navy blue for the dark uniform). The navy &quot;Double-Star&quot; jersey was not seen again until the NFL's<space/><italics>Classic Throwback Weekend</italics><space/>on Thanksgiving Day 2001&amp;ndash;2003.</paragraph><paragraph>In 2004, the Cowboys resurrected their original 19601963 uniform on Thanksgiving Day. This uniform became the team's alternate or &quot;third jersey&quot; and was usually worn at least once a year, primarily Thanksgiving Day. Two exceptions were when the Cowboys wore their normal white uniforms on Thanksgiving in 2007 and 2008. While the team didn't wear the throwback uniform exactly on Thanksgiving Day in those two years, Dallas wore them on a date around Thanksgiving for those two years. In 2007 Dallas wore the throwback uniform on November 29, 2007 against the Green Bay Packers. In 2008 Dallas wore the throwback uniform on November 23, 2008 against the San Francisco 49ers. The team went back to wearing this uniform at home on Thanksgiving Day in 2009 while their opponent was the Oakland Raiders who wore their AFL Legacy Weekend throwbacks. Dallas wore this alternate uniform on October 11, 2009 as part of one of the NFL's AFL Legacy Weekends when they traveled to Kansas City to play the Chiefs who were sporting their AFL Dallas Texans' uniforms. This created a rare game in which neither team wore a white jersey and the first time the Cowboys wore the alternative uniform as a visiting team. The 19601963 uniform may also be used on other special occasion. Other instances include the 2005 Monday Night game against the Washington Redskins when the team inducted Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, and Michael Irving into the Cowboys Ring of Honor, and the 2006 Christmas Day game against the Philadelphia Eagles.</paragraph><paragraph>In 2013, the NFL issued a new helmet rule stating that players will no longer be allowed to use alternate helmets due to the league's enhanced concussion awareness. This caused the Cowboys' white 1960s throwback helmets to become non-compliant. The team instead decided to wear their normal blue jerseys at home for Thanksgiving.<extension extension_name='ref' name="2013BlueJerseys"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.dallascowboys.com/news/article-NickEatman/Cowboys-To-Wear-Blue-Jerseys-At-Home-Thursday/9ed90bd1-5be2-4e84-92c8-6dd43ee6fe77<space/></arg><arg name="title">Cowboys To Wear Blue Jerseys At Home Thursday<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Dallas Cowboys<space/></arg><arg name="date">November 26, 2013<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">November 28, 2013</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='4'>Home/road jersey history</heading><paragraph>In 1964, Tex Schramm started the tradition of the Cowboys wearing their white jersey at home, contrary to an unofficial rule that teams should wear colored jerseys at home.

Various other teams, be it an NFC East rival or teams not from the same division as the Dallas Cowboys, followed suit in the 1980s. A couple other division rivals such as the New York Giants and the Cardinals (formerly in their time as their existence in St. Louis) have purposely worn white at home against the Cowboys in the past. The New York Giants for portions of the 1980s, carried from head coach Ray Perkins to Bill Parcells, wore white at home against the Cowboys but after a period of time stopped. The now Arizona Cardinals, back when they were in St. Louis, were one of the first teams to try doing this trick when the Cowboys visited the Cardinals at Busch Stadium. The<space/><link><target>Carolina Panthers</target></link>, who came into existence in 1995, used to attempt the gimmick (regardless of whether the purpose of beating the early season heat was to be had) until 2006. One of the more recent examples of the &quot;curse&quot; happened in 2008 when the 14<space/><link><target>St. Louis Rams</target></link><space/>chose to wear their white uniforms at home, forcing the Cowboys to wear road blue uniforms. The Rams would upset the Cowboys 3414. It was the first time the Rams wore white at home since (moving to St. Louis) their existence in Los Angeles where they also used to do the same on some occasion against Dallas. On October 16, 2011, the Cowboys wore their road blue jerseys against the<space/><link><target>New England Patriots</target></link><space/>for the first time since December 27, 2009, against the Redskins; the Patriots defeated the Cowboys 2016.

In 2001, the Cowboys wore blue at home for the first time in years, but it was an older design of the blue jersey. Dallas would lose the game, but again wore the older blue jersey at home on Thanksgiving the next year and won.

Since 2009, the Cowboys returned to wearing blue at home on Thanksgiving only (From 2009&amp;ndash;2012, the team again decided to go with an older-styled blue uniform as they had in previous years on Thanksgiving, and since 2013 have worn the newer-styled blue jersey).</paragraph><heading level='2'>Stadiums</heading><heading level='3'>Cotton Bowl</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Cotton Bowl (stadium)</arg></template><link><target>Image:CottonBowl.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>The main entrance of the Cotton Bowl</part></link>The Cotton Bowl is a stadium which opened in 1932 and became known as &quot;The House That Doak Built&quot; due to the immense crowds that former SMU running back Doak Walker drew to the stadium during his college career in the late 1940s.

In the 2010s, the Redskins have struggled to consistently compete for the Division title, but still play the Cowboys particularly tough, posting impressive, upset victories against Dallas in both 2013 and 2014, despite being outclassed by the Cowboys in the overall standings.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Philadelphia Eagles</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Cowboys–Eagles rivalry</arg></template>The competition with Philadelphia has been particularly intense since the late 1970s, when the long-moribund Eagles returned to contention. In January 1981, the two teams faced off in the NFC Championship, with Philadelphia winning 207. A series of other factors heightened tensions during the 1980s and 1990s, including several provocative actions by Philadelphia fans and Eagles head coach<space/><link><target>Buddy Ryan</target></link>. Among these were the 1989 &quot;<link><target>Bounty Bowl</target><trail>s</trail></link>,&quot; in which Ryan allegedly placed a bounty on Dallas kicker<space/><link><target>Luis Zendejas</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Veterans Stadium</target></link><space/>fans pelted the Cowboys with snowballs and other debris. A 1999 game at Philadelphia saw Eagles fans cheering as Michael Irvin lay motionless and possibly paralyzed on the field. In 2008 the rivalry became more intense when in the last game of the year in which both teams could clinch a playoff spot with a victory, the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Cowboys 446. The following season, the Cowboys avenged that defeat by beating the Eagles three times: twice during the regular season to claim the title as NFC East champions and once more in a wild-card playoff game by a combined score of 7830, including a 240 shutout in week 17. That three game sweep was Dallas' first over any opponent and the longest winning streak against the Eagles since 19921995 when Dallas won seven straight matches against Philadelphia. During the 2013 season Dallas won the first meeting 17-3 at<space/><link><target>Lincoln Financial Field</target></link><space/>in Philadelphia. They would meet again in Week 17 at the Cowboys<space/><link><target>AT&amp;T Stadium</target></link><space/>with the winner clinching the 2013 NFC East Title. The Cowboys came into the game at a disadvantage with starting quarterback<space/><link><target>Tony Romo</target></link><space/>out with a season ending back injury which put backup<space/><link><target>Kyle Orton</target></link><space/>as the starter. It was a tight game with the Eagles up 24-22 with less than 2 minutes to go in regulation. Orton got the ball and started driving down the field when he was intercepted by the Eagles defense which ended the game and the Cowboys season. Dallas leads the regular season all-time series 63-49. In 2014, the Cowboys and Eagles both won against each other on the road, with Philadelphia posting a dominant 33-10 win on Thanksgiving Day in Dallas, and Dallas returning the favor two weeks later by defeating the Eagles 38-27 in Philadelphia. The second game between these rivals clenched a playoff spot for Dallas and led to formerly first place Philadelphia missing out on the post-season.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Pittsburgh Steelers</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Cowboys–Steelers rivalry</arg></template><space/>The two teams met in the first regular season game the Cowboys ever played in 1960 (a 3528 loss to the<space/><link><target>Pittsburgh Steelers</target><part>Steelers</part></link>), the first-ever regular season victory for the expansion Cowboys in 1961, and would later meet in three Super Bowls, all of them closely contested events.

The Cowboys won<space/><link><target>Super Bowl XXX</target></link><space/>in January 1996.

San Francisco has played Dallas in seven postseason games. The Cowboys defeated the 49ers in the 1970 and 1971 NFC Championship games, and again in the 1972 Divisional Playoff Game. The 1981 NFC Championship Game in San Francisco, which saw the 49ers'<space/><link><target>Joe Montana</target></link><space/>complete a game-winning pass to<space/><link><target>Dwight Clark</target></link><space/>in the final minute (now known as<space/><link><target>The Catch (American football)</target><part>The Catch</part></link>) is one of the most famous games in NFL history. The rivalry became even more intense during the 19921994 seasons. San Francisco and Dallas faced each other in the NFC Championship Game three separate times. Dallas won the first two match-ups, and San Francisco won the third. In each of these pivotal match-ups, the game's victor went on to win the Super Bowl. Both the Cowboys and the 49ers are second all time in<space/><link><target>Super Bowl</target></link><space/>victories to the<space/><link><target>Pittsburgh Steelers</target></link><space/>with five each.

Instead, the team has a<space/><link><target>Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor</target><part>&quot;Ring of Honor&quot;</part></link>, which is on permanent display encircling the field. Originally at Texas Stadium, the ring is now on display at<space/><link><target>Cowboys Stadium</target></link><space/>in Arlington. The first inductee was Bob Lilly in 1975 and by 2005, the ring contained 17 names, all former Dallas players except for one head coach and one general manager/president. Although the team does not officially retire jersey numbers, some are kept &quot;unofficially inactive&quot;, so it is uncommon to find any current players wearing the number of one of the<space/><bold>&quot;Ring of Honor&quot;</bold><space/>inductees. For instance, the jersey numbers of inductees Aikman (8), Staubach (12), Hayes and Smith (22), Irvin (88), and Lilly (74) were not worn during the 2008 season. For the 2010 season, number 88 was issued to rookie<space/><link><target>Dez Bryant</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>The Ring of Honor has been a source of controversy over the years. Tex Schramm was believed to be a &quot;one-man committee&quot; in choosing inductees and many former Cowboys players and fans felt that Schramm deliberately excluded linebacker<space/><link><target>Lee Roy Jordan</target></link><space/>because of a bitter contract dispute the two had during Jordan's playing days. When Jerry Jones bought the team he inherited Schramm's Ring of Honor &quot;power&quot; and immediately inducted Jordan.</paragraph><paragraph>Jones also has sparked controversy regarding his decisions in handling the &quot;Ring of Honor&quot;. For four years he was unsuccessful in convincing Tom Landry to accept induction. Meanwhile, he refused to induct Tex Schramm (even after Schramm's induction to the Pro Football Hall of Fame). In 1993, thanks in part to the efforts of Roger Staubach as an intermediary, Landry accepted induction and had a ceremony on the day of that year's Cowboys-Giants game (Landry had played and coached for the Giants). In 2003, Jones finally chose to induct Tex Schramm. Schramm and Jones held a joint press conference at Texas Stadium announcing the induction. Unfortunately, Schramm did not live to see his ceremonial induction at the Cowboys-Eagles game that fall.</paragraph><paragraph>Some of the more recent inductees were Troy Aikman, all-time NFL leading rusher Emmitt Smith, and Michael Irvin, known as &quot;The Triplets&quot;. The Cowboys waited until Smith had retired as a player before inducting Aikman and Irvin, so all three could be inducted together, which occurred during halftime at a Monday Night Football home game against the arch-rival Washington Redskins on September 19, 2005.</paragraph><paragraph>The most recent inductees are Defensive end<space/><link><target>Charles Haley</target></link>, Offensive Lineman<space/><link><target>Larry Allen</target></link>, and Wide Receiver<space/><link><target>Drew Pearson (American football)</target><part>Drew Pearson</part></link><space/>on November 6, 2011 against the<space/><link><target>Seattle Seahawks</target></link><space/>during Halftime.</paragraph><paragraph>Safety Darren Woodson will be inducted on November 1, 2015.</paragraph><heading level='3'>All-time first-round draft picks</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>List of Dallas Cowboys first-round draft picks</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>Head coaches and staff</heading><heading level='3'>Head coaches</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>List of Dallas Cowboys head coaches</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='3'>Current staff</heading><paragraph><template><target>Dallas Cowboys staff</target></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>Radio and television</heading><paragraph>As of 2010, the Cowboys' flagship radio station is<space/><link><target>KRLD-FM</target></link>.<space/><link><target>Brad Sham</target></link><space/>is the team's longtime<space/><link><target>sports commentator</target><part>play-by-play voice</part></link>.
