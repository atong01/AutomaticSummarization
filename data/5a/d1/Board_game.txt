A '''board game''' is a [[tabletop game]] that involves counters or pieces moved or placed on a pre-marked surface or "board", according to a set of rules. Games can be based on pure [[Strategy game|strategy]], [[Game of chance|chance]] (e.g., rolling [[dice]]), or a mixture of the two, and usually have a goal that a player aims to achieve. Early board games represented a battle between two armies, and most modern board games are still based on defeating opposing players in terms of counters, winning position, or accrual of points (often expressed as in-game currency).

There are many varieties of board games. Their representation of real-life situations can range from having no inherent theme (e.g., [[checkers]]), to having a specific theme and narrative (e.g., ''[[Cluedo]]''). Rules can range from the very simple (e.g., [[Tic-tac-toe]]), to those describing a game universe in great detail (e.g., ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'') {{ndash}} although most of the latter are [[role-playing game]]s where the board is secondary to the game, serving to help visualize the game [[scenario]].

The time required to learn to play or master a game varies greatly from game to game. Learning time does not necessarily correlate with the number or complexity of rules; some games having profound strategies (e.g. [[chess]] or [[Go (board game)|Go]]) possess relatively simple rulesets. <!-- https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ruleset -->

===Ancient board games===
[[File:Anonymous-Astana Graves Wei Qi Player.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|''Woman Playing Go'', [[Astana Tombs|Astana Cemetery]], [[Turpan]] (c. 744)]]
Board games have been played in most cultures and societies throughout history. A number of important historical sites, artifacts, and documents shed light on early board games such as:

===In United States===
In seventeenth and eighteenth century colonial America, the agrarian life of the country left little time for game playing though [[draughts]] ([[checkers]]), [[bowling]], and card games were not unknown. The Pilgrims and Puritans of New England frowned on game playing and viewed dice as instruments of the devil. When the Governor William Bradford discovered a group of non-Puritans playing stool-ball, pitching the bar, and pursuing other sports in the streets on Christmas Day, 1622, he confiscated their implements, reprimanded them, and told them their devotion for the day should be confined to their homes.

In ''Thoughts on Lotteries'' (1826) [[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote: <blockquote>Almost all these pursuits of chance [i.e., of human industry] produce something useful to society. But there are some which produce nothing, and endanger the well-being of the individuals engaged in them or of others depending on them. Such are games with cards, dice, billiards, etc. And although the pursuit of them is a matter of natural right, yet society, perceiving the irresistible bent of some of its members to pursue them, and the ruin produced by them to the families depending on these individuals, consider it as a case of insanity, quoad hoc, step in to protect the family and the party himself, as in other cases of insanity, infancy, imbecility, etc., and suppress the pursuit altogether, and the natural right of following it. There are some other games of chance, useful on certain occasions, and injurious only when carried beyond their useful bounds. Such are insurances, lotteries, raffles, etc. These they do not suppress, but take their regulation under their own discretion.</blockquote>

The board game ''Traveller's Tour Through the United States'' and its sister game ''Traveller’s Tour Through Europe'' were published by New York City bookseller [[F. & R. Lockwood]] in 1822 and today claims the distinction of being the first board game published in the United States.<ref name=fv/>

As the United States shifted from agrarian to urban living in the nineteenth century, greater leisure time and a rise in income became available to the middle class. The American home, once the center of economic production, became the [[wikt:locus|locus]] of entertainment, enlightenment, and education under the supervision of mothers. Children were encouraged to play board games that developed literacy skills and provided moral instruction.<ref name="Jensen">{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1026/is_6_160/ai_80864307/pg_1?tag=content;col1 |last=Jensen |first=Jennifer |title=Teaching Success Through Play: American Board and Table Games, 1840-1900 |work=Magazine Antiques |publisher=bnet |year=2003 |accessdate=2009-02-07}}</ref>

The earliest board games published in the United States were based upon Christian morality. ''[[The Mansion of Happiness]]'' (1843), for example, sent players along a path of virtues and vices that led to the Mansion of Happiness (Heaven).<ref name="Jensen" /> ''The Game of Pope or Pagan, or The Siege of the Stronghold of Satan by the Christian Army'' (1844) pitted an image on its board of a [[Hindu]] woman committing ''[[suttee]]'' against missionaries landing on a foreign shore. The missionaries are cast in white as "the symbol of innocence, temperance, and hope" while the pope and pagan are cast in black, the color of "gloom of error, and...grief at the daily loss of empire".<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2pitMiJJLX8C&pg=PA261&dq=Fessenden+Culture+and+Religion+Pope+and+Pagan&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html |last=Fessenden |first=Tracy |title=Culture and Redemption: Religion, the Secular, and American Literature |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2007 |pages=271 |accessdate=2009-02-07}}</ref>

[[File:District Messenger Boy Box Cover 1886.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|''Game of the [[telegraph boys|District Messenger Boy]]'' (1886) was one of the first board games based on materialism and capitalism published in the United States.]]

Commercially produced board games in the mid-nineteenth century were monochrome prints laboriously hand-colored by teams of low paid young factory women. Advances in paper making and printmaking during the period enabled the commercial production of relatively inexpensive board games. The most significant advance was the development of [[chromolithography]], a technological achievement that made bold, richly colored images available at affordable prices. Games cost as little as US$.25 for a small boxed card game to $3.00 for more elaborate games.

American Protestants believed a virtuous life led to success, but the belief was challenged mid-century when Americans embraced materialism and capitalism. The accumulation of material goods was viewed as a divine blessing. In 1860, ''[[The Checkered Game of Life]]'' rewarded players for mundane activities such as attending college, marrying, and getting rich. Daily life rather than eternal life became the focus of board games. The game was the first to focus on secular virtues rather than religious virtues,<ref name="Jensen" /> and sold 40,000 copies its first year.<ref name="Hofer">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=icYtGRUZrZUC&pg=PP1&dq=Margaret+Hofer+The+Games+We+Played&lr=&num=50&as_brr=3&as_pt=BOOKS&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html |last=Hofer |first=Margaret K. |title=The Games We Played: The Golden Age of Board & Table Games |publisher=Princeton Architectural Press |year=2003 |accessdate=2009-02-07}}</ref>

''Game of the District Messenger Boy, or Merit Rewarded'' is a board game published in 1886 by the New York City firm of [[McLoughlin Brothers]]. The game is a typical roll-and-move track board game. Players move their tokens along the track at the spin of the arrow toward the goal at track's end. Some spaces on the track will advance the player while others will send him back.

In the affluent 1880s, Americans witnessed the publication of [[Horatio Alger, Jr.|Algeresque]] [[rags to riches]] games that permitted players to emulate the capitalist heroes of the age. One of the first such games, ''The Game of the District Messenger Boy'', encouraged the idea that the lowliest messenger boy could ascend the corporate ladder to its topmost rung. Such games insinuated that the accumulation of wealth brought increased social status.<ref name="Jensen" /> Competitive capitalistic games culminated in 1935 with ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'', the most commercially successful board game in United States history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://boardgames.lovetoknow.com/History_of_the_Game_Monopoly |author=Weber, Susan, and Susie McGee |title=History of the Game Monopoly |date=n.d. |accessdate=2009-02-03| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090210050138/http://boardgames.lovetoknow.com/History_of_the_Game_Monopoly| archivedate= 10 February 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

McLoughlin Brothers published similar games based on the telegraph boy theme including ''Game of the Telegraph Boy, or Merit Rewarded'' (1888). Greg Downey notes in his essay, "Information Networks and Urban Spaces: The Case of the Telegraph Messenger Boy" that families who could afford the deluxe version of the game in its [[chromolithography|chromolithographed]], wood-sided box would not "have sent their sons out for such a rough apprenticeship in the working world."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurians.org/Nov_99/info_networks.html |author=Downey, Greg |title=Information Networks and Urban Spaces: The Case of the Telegraph Messenger Boy |publisher=Mercurians |work=Antenna |date=November 1999 |accessdate=2009-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20080807161116/http://www.mercurians.org/Nov_99/info_networks.html |archivedate=7 August 2008 }}</ref>

[[Margaret Hofer]] described the period of 1880s-1920s as the Gold Age of board gaming in America.<ref name=fv/>

===Recent developments===
Around the year 2000 the board gaming industry began significant growth with companies such as Fantasy Flight Games, Z-Man Games, and Indie Boards and Cards churning out new games to be sold to a growing worldwide audience.<ref name="board game resurgence">{{cite web|url=http://www.shutupshow.com/post/34426556753/su-sd-present-the-board-game-golden-age |title=The Board Game Golden Age |first=Quinti  |last=Smith |date=October 2012 |accessdate=2013-05-10}}</ref>

==Luck, strategy, and diplomacy==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}
Many board games involve both luck and strategy. But an important feature of them is the amount of randomness/[[luck]] involved, as opposed to skill. Some games, such as chess, depend almost entirely on player skill. But many children's games are decided purely by luck: for example, ''[[Candy Land]]'' and ''[[Snakes and Ladders]]'' require no decisions by the players. A player may be hampered by a few poor rolls of the [[dice]] in [[backgammon]], ''Monopoly'', ''[[Risk (game)|Risk]]'', or [[cribbage]], but over many games a skilled player will win more often. While some purists consider luck to be an undesirable component of a game, others counter that elements of luck can make for far more diverse and multi-faceted strategies, as concepts such as [[expected value]] and [[risk management]] must be considered.

A second aspect is the game information available to players. Some games (chess being a classic example) are ''[[perfect information]]'' games: each player has complete information on the state of the game. In other games, such as ''[[Tigris and Euphrates]]'' or ''[[Stratego]]'', some information is hidden from players. This makes finding the best move more difficult, and may involve estimating probabilities by the opponents.

Another important aspect of some games is [[diplomacy]], that is, players making deals with one another. Two-player games usually do not involve diplomacy ([[cooperative games]] being the exception). Thus, negotiation generally features only in games with three or more players. An important facet of ''[[The Settlers of Catan]]'', for example, is convincing players to trade with you rather than with opponents. In ''[[Risk (game)|Risk]]'', two or more players may team up against others. ''Easy'' diplomacy involves convincing other players that someone else is winning and should therefore be teamed up against. ''Advanced'' diplomacy (e.g. in the aptly named game ''[[Diplomacy (board game)|Diplomacy]]'') consists of making elaborate plans together, with the possibility of betrayal.

Luck may be introduced into a game by a number of methods. The most common method is the use of [[dice]], generally six-sided. These can decide everything from how many steps a player moves their token, as in ''Monopoly'', to how their forces fare in battle, as in ''[[Risk (game)|Risk]]'', or which resources a player gains, as in ''The Settlers of Catan''. Other games such as ''[[Sorry! (game)|Sorry!]]'' use a deck of special [[Playing card|card]]s that, when shuffled, create randomness. ''[[Scrabble]]'' does something similar with randomly picked letters. Other games use spinners, timers of random length, or other sources of randomness. Trivia games have a great deal of randomness based on the questions a player must answer. [[German-style board game]]s are notable for often having less luck element than many North American board games.

==Board games and other media==
Many board games are now available as [[video game]]s, which can include the computer itself as one of several players, or as a sole opponent. Many board games can now be played [[Internet|online]] against a computer and/or other players. Some [[website]]s allow play in [[real time (media)|real time]] and immediately show the opponents' moves, while others use [[email]] to notify the players after each move.<ref name="chessbyemail">{{cite web |url=http://www.u3abroadbeach.com/chess-by-email.html |title=U3a International Chess by Email |accessdate=2014-10-08}}</ref> The [[internet]] and cheaper home printing has also influenced board games via print-and-play games that may be purchased and printed.<ref name="printplay">{{cite web |url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamecategory/1120/print-play |title=Print & Play |accessdate=2014-10-08}}</ref> Some games use external media such as audio cassettes or [[DVD]]s in accompaniment to the game.<ref name="dvdgames">{{cite web |url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/7348/dvd-board-games |title=DVD Board Games |accessdate=2014-10-08}}</ref><ref name="cassettegames">{{cite web |url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/7477/audio-cassette-board-games |title=Audio Cassette Board Games |accessdate=2014-10-08}}</ref>

[[File:Nepomuk 280 - Osadníci z Katanu.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The modern German board game ''[[The Settlers of Catan]]'' is printed in 30 languages and sold 15 million by 2009.]]
While the board gaming market is estimated to be smaller than that for [[video games]], it has also experienced significant growth from the late 1990s.<ref name=guardian2014oct/> A 2012 article in ''[[The Guardian]]'' described board games as "making a come back".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/dec/09/board-games-comeback-freeman|title=Why board games are making a comeback|author=Will Freeman|work=the Guardian}}</ref> Another from 2014 gave an estimate that put the growth of board game market at "between 25% and 40% annually" since 2010, and described the current time as the "[[golden era]] for board games".<ref name=guardian2014oct>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/25/board-games-internet-playstation-xbox|title=Board games' golden age: sociable, brilliant and driven by the internet|author=Owen Duffy|work=the Guardian}}</ref> The rise in board game popularity has been attributed to quality improvement (more elegant mechanics and graphics) as well as increased availability thanks to sales through the Internet.<ref name=guardian2014oct/>

A dedicated field of research into gaming exists, known as [[game studies]] or ludology.

While there has been a fair amount of scientific research on the psychology of older board games (e.g., [[chess]], [[Go (board game)|Go]], [[mancala]]), less has been done on contemporary board games such as ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'', ''[[Scrabble]]'', and ''[[Risk (game)|Risk]]''.<ref>{{cite book | author=Gobet, Fernand | author-link=Fernand Gobet | author2=de Voogt, Alex|author3= Retschitzki, Jean | title=Moves in mind: The psychology of board games | publisher=Psychology Press | year=2004 | isbn=1-84169-336-7}}</ref> Much research has been carried out on chess, in part because many tournament players are publicly ranked in national and international lists, which makes it possible to compare their levels of expertise. The works of [[Adriaan de Groot]], William Chase, [[Herbert A. Simon]], and [[Fernand Gobet]] have established that knowledge, more than the ability to anticipate moves, plays an essential role in chess-playing.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Linearly arranged board games have been shown to improve children's spatial numerical understanding. This is because the game is similar to a [[number line]] in that they promote a linear understanding of numbers rather than the innate logarithmic one.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~siegler/sieg-ram09.pdf | title=Playing Linear Number Board Games—But Not Circular Ones—Improves Low-Income Preschoolers’ Numerical Understanding}}</ref>

Research studies show that board games such as Chutes and Ladders result in children showing significant improvements in aspects of basic number skills such as counting, recognizing numbers, numerical estimation and number comprehension. They also practice fine motor skills each time they grasp a game piece.<ref>{{cite web|last1=LeFebvre|first1=J.E|title=Parenting the preschooler|url=http://parenting.uwex.edu/parenting-the-preschooler/documents/board_games.pdf|website=UW Extension|accessdate=10 March 2015}}</ref> Playing board games has also been tied to improving children's [[executive skills]].<ref>{{cite web|title=How Family Game Night Makes Kids Into Better Students|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/07/how-family-game-night-makes-kids-into-better-students/374525/|accessdate=23 April 2015}}</ref>

Additionally, board games can be therapeutic. [[Bruce Barrymore Halpenny|Bruce Halpenny]], a [[games inventor]] said when interviewed about his game: <blockquote>With crime you deal with every basic human emotion and also have enough elements to combine action with melodrama. The player’s imagination is fired as they plan to rob the train. Because of the gamble they take in the early stage of the game there is a build up of tension, which is immediately released once the train is robbed. Release of tension is therapeutic and useful in our society, because most jobs are boring and repetitive.<ref name=TRN1976 >Stealing the show.  ''Toy Retailing News'', Volume 2 Number 4 (December 1976), p. 2</ref></blockquote>

Playing games have been suggested as a viable addition to traditional educational curriculum.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Christopher|last1=Harris|title=Meet the New School Board: Board Games Are Back--And They're Exactly What Your Curriculum Needs|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ850549|journal=School Library Journal|date= n.d. |issn=0362-8930|pages=24–26|volume=55|issue=5|accessdate=23 April 2015}}</ref>

==Categories==
A common division of board games is into [[German-style board game|European-]] (also known as German-) and [[American-style board game|American-style]] games.<ref name=fv/>
