He digested, interpreted, and systematized the whole of Aristotle's works, gleaned from the Latin translations and notes of the Arabian commentators, in accordance with Church doctrine.

The latter is in substance a more didactic repetition of the former.</paragraph><paragraph>Albert's activity, however, was more philosophical than theological (see<space/><link><target>Scholasticism</target></link>). The philosophical works, occupying the first six and the last of the 21 volumes, are generally divided according to the<space/><link><target>Aristotelianism</target><part>Aristotelian</part></link><space/>scheme of the sciences, and consist of interpretations and condensations of Aristotle's relative works, with supplementary discussions upon contemporary topics, and occasional divergences from the opinions of the master.

His industry in every department was great, and though we find in his system many gaps which are characteristic of scholastic philosophy, his protracted study of Aristotle gave him a great power of systematic thought and exposition. An exception to this general tendency is his Latin treatise &quot;De falconibus&quot; (later inserted in the larger work,<space/><italics>De Animalibus</italics>, as book 23, chapter 40), in which he displays impressive actual knowledge of a) the differences between the<space/><link><target>birds of prey</target></link><space/>and the other kinds of birds; b) the different kinds of<space/><link><target>falcon</target><trail>s</trail></link>; c) the way of preparing them for the<space/><link><target>Hunting</target><part>hunt</part></link>; and d) the cures for sick and wounded falcons.<extension extension_name='ref'>An Smets, &quot;Le rception en langue vulgaire du &quot;De falconibus&quot; d'Albert le Grand,&quot; in:<space/><italics>Medieval Forms of Argument: Disputation and Debate</italics>, ed.

Most of his written musical observations are found in his commentary on Aristotle's<space/><italics>Poetics</italics>. He rejected the idea of &quot;<link><target>Musica universalis</target><part>music of the spheres</part></link>&quot; as ridiculous: movement of astronomical bodies, he supposed, is incapable of generating sound. He wrote extensively on proportions in music, and on the three different subjective levels on which<space/><link><target>plainchant</target></link><space/>could work on the human soul: purging of the impure; illumination leading to contemplation; and nourishing perfection through contemplation. Of particular interest to 20th-century music theorists is the attention he paid to silence as an integral part of music.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Metaphysics of morals</heading><paragraph>Both of his early treatises,<space/><italics>De natura boni</italics><space/>and<space/><italics>De bono</italics>, start with a metaphysical investigation into the concepts of the good in general and the physical good. Albert refers to the physical good as<space/><italics>bonum naturae</italics>. Albert does this before directly dealing with the moral concepts of metaphysics. In Albert's later works, he says in order to understand human or moral goodness, the individual must first recognize what it means to be good and do good deeds. This procedure reflects Albert's preoccupations with neo-Platonic theories of good as well as the doctrines of Pseudo-Dionysius.<extension extension_name='ref'>Cunningham, Stanley.

Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University Of America Press, 2008 p.242</extension><space/>With his development of friendship throughout his work this is evident that friendship ideals and morals took relevance as his life went on. Albert comments on Aristotle's view of friendship with a quote from<space/><link><target>Cicero</target></link>, who writes, &quot;friendship is nothing other than the harmony between things divine and human, with goodwill and love. Albert agrees with this commentary but he also adds in harmony or agreement.<extension extension_name='ref'>Cunningham, Stanley. Reclaiming Moral Agency: The Moral Philosophy of Albert the Great. Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University Of America Press, 2008 p.243</extension><space/>Albert calls this harmony,<space/><italics>consensiom</italics>, itself a certain kind of movement within the human spirit. Albert fully agrees with Aristotle in the sense that friendship is a virtue. Albert relates the inherent metaphysical contentedness between friendship and moral goodness. Albert describes several levels of goodness; the useful (<italics>utile</italics>), the pleasurable (<italics>delectabile</italics>) and the authentic or unqualified good (<italics>honestum</italics>). Then in turn there are three levels of friendship based on each of those levels. Friendship based on usefulness (<italics>amicitia utilis</italics>), friendship based on pleasure (<italics>amicitia delectabilis</italics>), and friendship rooted in unqualified goodness (<italics>amicitia honesti</italics>;<space/><italics>amicitia quae fundatur super honestum</italics>).<extension extension_name='ref'>Cunningham, Stanley.
