The area which consisted of Counties Tyrone and Fermanagh, Londonderry County Borough, and portions of Counties Londonderry and Armagh had less than a quarter of the total population of Northern Ireland yet generated not far short of three-quarters of the complaints of discrimination...The unionist government must bear its share of responsibility. It put through the original gerrymander which underpinned so many of the subsequent malpractices, and then, despite repeated protests, did nothing to stop those malpractices continuing. The most serious charge against the Northern Ireland government is not that it was directly responsible for widespread discrimination, but that it allowed discrimination on such a scale over a substantial segment of Northern Ireland.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last">Whyte</arg><arg name="first">John</arg><arg name="title">Contemporary Irish Studies</arg><arg name="editor">Gallagher, Tom; O'Connell, James</arg><arg name="publisher">Manchester University Press</arg><arg name="location">Manchester</arg><arg name="year">1983</arg><arg name="chapter">How much discrimination was there under the unionist regime, 1921–68?</arg><arg name="isbn">0-7190-0919-7</arg><arg name="url">http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/discrimination/whyte.htm#chap1</arg></template></extension></extension></paragraph><paragraph>A<space/><link><target>civil rights</target></link><space/>demonstration in 1968 led by the<space/><link><target>Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association</target></link><space/>was banned by the Government and blocked using force by the<space/><link><target>Royal Ulster Constabulary</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="DiscrimChron"></extension><space/>The events that followed the August 1969<space/><link><target>Apprentice Boys</target></link><space/>parade resulted in the<space/><link><target>Battle of the Bogside</target></link>, when Catholic rioters fought the police, leading to widespread civil disorder in Northern Ireland and is often dated as the starting point of<space/><link><target>the Troubles</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>On Sunday 30 January 1972, 13 unarmed civilians were shot dead by British paratroopers during a civil rights march in the<space/><link><target>Bogside</target></link><space/>area.

Today, the fortifications form a continuous promenade around the city centre, complete with cannon, avenues of mature trees and views across Derry. Historic buildings within the city walls include St Augustine's Church, which sits on the city walls close to the site of the original monastic settlement; the copper-domed Austin's department store, which claims to the oldest such store in the world; and the imposing Greek Revival Courthouse on Bishop Street.
