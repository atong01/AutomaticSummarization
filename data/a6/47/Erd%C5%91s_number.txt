The '''Erdős number''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈɛrdøːʃ}}) describes the "collaborative distance" between mathematician {{nobr|[[Paul Erdős]]}} and another person, as measured by authorship of [[List of important publications in mathematics|mathematical papers]].

The same principle has been applied in other fields where a particular individual has collaborated with a large and broad number of peers. The [[American Mathematical Society]] provides a free online tool to determine the Erdős number of every mathematical author listed in the [[Mathematical Reviews]] catalogue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/collaborationDistance.html|title=

== Overview ==
Paul Erdős (1913–1996) was an influential mathematician who spent a large portion of his later life writing papers with a large number of colleagues, working on solutions to outstanding mathematical problems.<ref name="newman2001">{{cite journal|last=Newman|first=M.

The idea of the Erdős number was originally created by the mathematician's friends as a tribute to his enormous output. However, in later years it gained prominence as a tool to study how mathematicians cooperate to find answers to unsolved problems. Several projects are devoted to studying connectivity among researchers, using the Erdős number as a proxy.<ref name="Erdős Number Project">{{cite web|url=http://www.oakland.edu/enp|title=Erdös Number Project|publisher=Oakland University}}</ref> For example, Erdős [[collaboration graph]]s can tell us how authors cluster, how the number of co-authors per paper evolves over time, or how new theories propagate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oakland.edu/enp/trivia/|title=Facts about Erdös Numbers and the Collaboration Graph|work=Erdös Number Project|publisher=Oakland University}}</ref>

Several studies have shown that leading mathematicians tend to have particularly low Erdős numbers.<ref name="trails">{{cite journal

==Definition and application in mathematics==
[[File:Erdosnumber.png|thumb|If [[Alice and Bob|Alice]] collaborates with Paul Erdős on one paper, and with Bob on another, but Bob never collaborates with Erdős himself, then Alice is given an Erdős number of 1 and Bob is given an Erdős number of 2, as he is two steps from Erdős.]]
To be assigned an Erdős number, someone must be a coauthor of a research paper with another person who has a finite Erdős number.  Paul Erdős has an Erdős number of zero. Anybody else's Erdős number is {{math|''k'' + 1}} where {{math|''k''}} is the lowest Erdős number of any coauthor.

Erdős wrote around 1,500 mathematical articles in his lifetime, mostly co-written. He had 511 direct collaborators;<ref name="Erdős Number Project"/> these are the people with Erdős number 1.  The people who have collaborated with them (but not with Erdős himself) have an Erdős number of 2 (9267 people as of 2010<ref name="Erdős Number Project File Erdos2">[https://files.oakland.edu/users/grossman/enp/Erdos2.html Erdos2], Version 2010, October 20, 2010.</ref>), those who have collaborated with people who have an Erdős number of 2 (but not with Erdős or anyone with an Erdős number of 1) have an Erdős number of 3, and so forth. A person with no such coauthorship chain connecting to Erdős has an Erdős number of [[infinity]] (or an [[defined and undefined|undefined]] one). Since the death of Paul Erdős, the lowest Erdős number that a new researcher can obtain is 2.

There is room for ambiguity over what constitutes a link between two authors. The [[American Mathematical Society]] collaboration distance calculator uses data from [[Mathematical Reviews]], which includes most mathematics journals but covers other subjects only in a limited way, and which also includes some non-research publications{{fact|date=August 2015}}. The Erdős Number Project web site says:
{{quote|... Our criterion for inclusion of an edge between vertices u and v is some research collaboration between them resulting in a published work. Any number of additional co-authors is permitted,...}}
but they do not include non-research publications such as elementary textbooks, joint editorships, obituaries, and the like.  The “Erdős number of the second kind” restricts assignment of Erdős numbers to papers with only two collaborators.<ref>Grossman ''et al.''  "[http://www.oakland.edu/?id=9569&sid=243#en2k Erdős numbers of the second kind]," in ''Facts about Erdős Numbers and the Collaboration Graph''. [http://www.oakland.edu/enp The Erdős Number Project], [[Oakland University]], USA. Retrieved July 25, 2009.</ref>

The Erdős number was most likely first defined in print by Casper Goffman, an [[Mathematical analysis|analyst]] whose own Erdős number is 2.<ref name="Erdős Number Project File Erdos2"/> Goffman published his observations about Erdős' prolific collaboration in a 1969 article entitled "''And what is your Erdős number?''"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Goffman|first=Casper|title=And what is your Erdős number?|journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]]|volume=76|year=1969|doi=10.2307/2317868|page=791|jstor=2317868|issue=7}}</ref> See also some comments in an obituary by Michael Golomb.<ref>[http://www.math.purdue.edu/about/purview/fall96/paul-erdos.html Erdős' obituary by Michael Golomb]</ref>

The median Erdős number among [[Fields medal]]ists is as low as 3.<ref name="paths"/> Fields medalists with Erdős number 2 include [[Atle Selberg]], [[Kunihiko Kodaira]], [[Klaus Roth]], [[Alan Baker (mathematician)|Alan Baker]], [[Enrico Bombieri]], [[David Mumford]], [[Charles Fefferman]], [[William Thurston]], [[Shing-Tung Yau]], [[Jean Bourgain]], [[Richard Borcherds]], [[Manjul Bhargava]], [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] and [[Terence Tao]].  There are no Fields medalists with Erdős number 1,<ref name="paths">{{cite web|url=http://www.oakland.edu/enp/erdpaths/|title=Paths to Erdös|work=The Erdös Number Project|publisher=Oakland University}}</ref> however [[Endre Szemerédi]] is an [[Abel Prize]] Laureate with Erdős number 1.<ref name="trails"/>

Erdős numbers have been a part of the [[folklore]] of mathematicians throughout the world for many years. Among all working mathematicians at the turn of the millennium who have a finite Erdős number, the numbers range up to 15, the median is 5, and the mean is 4.65;<ref name="Erdős Number Project"/> almost everyone with a finite Erdős number has a number less than 8.  Due to the very high frequency of interdisciplinary collaboration in science today, very large numbers of non-mathematicians in many other fields of science also have finite Erdős numbers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oakland.edu/enp/erdpaths/ |title=Some Famous People with Finite Erdős Numbers | first=Jerry | last=Grossman |accessdate=1 February 2011}}</ref>  For example, political scientist [[Steven Brams]] has an Erdős number of 2. In biomedical research, it is common for statisticians to be among the authors of publications, and many statisticians can be linked to Erdős via [[John Tukey]], who has an Erdős number of 2.  Similarly, the prominent geneticist [[Eric Lander]] and the mathematician [[Daniel Kleitman]] have collaborated on papers,<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=search&term=lander+kleitman A dictionary-based approach for gene annotation.

According to Alex Lopez-Ortiz, all the [[Fields Medal|Fields]] and [[Nevanlinna Prize|Nevanlinna prize]] winners during the three cycles in 1986 to 1994 have Erdős numbers of at most 9.

Earlier mathematicians published fewer papers than modern ones, and more rarely published jointly written papers.  The earliest person known to have a finite Erdős number is either [[Richard Dedekind]] (born 1831, Erdős number 7) or [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius]] (born 1849, Erdős number 3), depending on the standard of publication eligibility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oakland.edu/?id=9602&sid=243|title=Paths to Erdös - The Erdös Number Project- Oakland University|work=oakland.edu}}</ref> It seems that older historic figures such as [[Leonhard Euler]] (born 1707) do not (yet) have finite Erdős numbers.

Tompa<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tompa|first=Martin|title=Figures of merit|journal=ACM SIGACT News|volume=20|issue=1|pages=62–71|year=1989|doi=10.1145/65780.65782}} {{cite journal|last=Tompa|first= Martin|title=Figures of merit: the sequel|journal=ACM SIGACT News|volume=21|issue=4|pages=78–81|year=1990|doi=10.1145/101371.101376}}</ref> proposed a [[directed graph]] version of the Erdős number problem, by orienting edges of the collaboration graph from the alphabetically earlier author to the alphabetically later author and defining the ''monotone Erdős number'' of an author to be the length of a [[longest path]] from Erdős to the author in this directed graph. He finds a path of this type of length 12.

Also, [[Michael Barr (mathematician)|Michael Barr]] suggests "rational Erdős numbers", generalizing the idea that a person who has written p joint papers with Erdős should be assigned Erdős number 1/p. From the collaboration multigraph of the second kind (although he also has a way to deal with the case of the first kind)—with one edge between two mathematicians for ''each'' joint paper they have produced—form an electrical network with a one-ohm resistor on each edge. The total resistance between two nodes tells how "close" these two nodes are.

It has been argued that "for an individual researcher, a measure such as Erdős number captures the structural properties of [the] network whereas the [[h-index|''h''-index]] captures the citation impact of the publications," and that "One can be easily convinced that ranking in coauthorship networks should take into account both measures to generate a realistic and acceptable ranking."<ref name=Dixit>Kashyap Dixit, S Kameshwaran, Sameep Mehta, Vinayaka Pandit, N Viswanadham, ''[http://domino.research.ibm.com/library/cyberdig.nsf/papers/2B600A90C54E51B18525755800283D37/$File/RR_ranking.pdf Towards simultaneously exploiting structure and outcomes in interaction networks for node ranking]'', IBM Research Report R109002, February 2009; also appeared as {{Cite journal | doi = 10.1145/1871437.1871470| pmc = | pmid =   | last1 = Kameshwaran | first1 = S. | last2 = Pandit | first2 = V. | last3 = Mehta | first3 = S. | last4 = Viswanadham | first4 = N. | last5 = Dixit | first5 = K. | title = Outcome aware ranking in interaction networks | pages = 229-238| year = 2010 | isbn = 978-1-4503-0099-5| journal = Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management (CIKM '10)}}</ref>

In 2004 William Tozier, a mathematician with an Erdös number of 4, auctioned off a co-authorship on [[eBay]], hence providing the buyer with an Erdös number of 5. The winning bid of $1031 was posted by a Spanish mathematician, who however did not intend to pay but just placed the bid to stop what he considered a mockery.<ref>Clifford A.

==Variations==
A number of variations on the concept have been proposed to apply to other fields.

The best known is [[Bacon number]] (as in the game [[Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon]]), connecting actors that appeared in a film together to the actor [[Kevin Bacon]]. [[Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon#History|It was created in 1994]], 25 years after Goffman's article on the Erdős number.

A small number of people are connected to both Erdős and Bacon and thus have an [[Erdős–Bacon number]], which combines the two numbers by taking their sum. One example is the actress-mathematician [[Danica McKellar]], best known for playing Winnie Cooper on the TV series, ''[[The Wonder Years]]''. 
Her Erdős number is 4<ref>McKellar's co-author L. Chayes published a paper with E.H. Lieb, who in turn co-authored a paper with D.J. Kleitman, a co-author of Paul Erdős.</ref> and her Bacon number is 2.<ref>Danica McKellar 
was in "The Year That Trembled" (2002) with James Kisicki , who was in "Telling Lies in America" (1997)  with Kevin Bacon.</ref> The lowest known
Erdős–Bacon number is 3 – for [[Daniel Kleitman]], a mathematics professor at MIT – his Erdős number is 1 and his Bacon number is 2.<ref>Daniel J. Kleitman, [http://www.ams.org/notices/199804/review-saul.pdf "My Career in the Movies,"], ''[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]'', '''45''', 502 (April 1998)</ref>

Further generalization is possible. For example, Erdős–Bacon–Sabbath numbers include the band [[Black Sabbath]] in the measure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://erdosbaconsabbath.com/|title=EBS Project|work=erdosbaconsabbath.com}}</ref> The lowest known Erdős–Bacon–Sabbath number is 8, a value shared by physicist [[Stephen Hawking]],<ref>[http://ebs.rosschurchley.com/stephen-hawking/ The EBS project - Stephen Hawking]</ref> neuroscientist [[Daniel Levitin]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://erdosbaconsabbath.com/daniel-levitin/|title=EBS Project|work=erdosbaconsabbath.com}}</ref> and inventor [[Ray Kurzweil]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://erdosbaconsabbath.com/ray-kurzweil/|title=EBS Project|work=erdosbaconsabbath.com}}</ref> all of whom have an Erdős number of 4, a Bacon number of 2, and a Sabbath number of 2.

English mathematician [[Peter Swinnerton-Dyer]] has an Erdős-Morphy number of 5.
