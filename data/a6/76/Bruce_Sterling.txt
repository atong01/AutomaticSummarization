'''Michael Bruce Sterling''' (born April 14, 1954) is an American [[science fiction author]] who is best known for his novels and his work on the ''[[Mirrorshades]]'' anthology. This work helped to define the [[cyberpunk]] genre.<ref name="egs">[http://www.egs.edu/faculty/bruce-sterling/biography/ Bruce Sterling] faculty page at [[European Graduate School]]</ref>

==Writings==
Sterling, along with [[William Gibson]], [[Rudy Rucker]], [[John Shirley]], [[Lewis Shiner]], and [[Pat Cadigan]], is one of the founders of the cyberpunk movement in science fiction. In addition, he is one of the subgenre's chief [[ideological]] promulgators. This has earned him the nickname "Chairman Bruce".<ref>{{cite web|author=Nisi Shawl |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/books/2008758249_br22sterling.html |title=Books &#124; "The Caryatids": four clones need a home &#124; Seattle Times Newspaper |publisher=Seattletimes.nwsource.com |date=2009-02-19 |accessdate=2010-01-01}}</ref> He was also one of the first organizers of the [[Turkey City Writer's Workshop]], and is a frequent attendee at the [[Sycamore Hill Writer's Workshop]]. He won [[Hugo Award]]s for his novelettes ''[[Bicycle Repairman]]'' and ''[[Taklamakan (story)|Taklamakan]]''.

His first novel, ''Involution Ocean'', published in 1977, features the world Nullaqua where all the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] is contained in a single, miles-deep [[Impact crater|crater]]. The story concerns a ship sailing on the [[ocean]] of dust at the bottom, which hunts creatures called dustwhales that live beneath the surface. It is partially a science-fictional [[pastiche]] of ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' by [[Herman Melville]].

From the late 1970s onwards, Sterling wrote a series of stories set in the [[Shaper/Mechanist universe]]: the [[solar system]] is colonised, with two major warring factions. The Mechanists use a great deal of computer-based mechanical technologies; the Shapers do [[genetic engineering]] on a massive scale. The situation is complicated by the eventual contact with [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[civilization]]s; humanity eventually splits into many subspecies, with the implication that many of these effectively vanish from the [[galaxy]], reminiscent of [[Technological singularity|The Singularity]] in the works of [[Vernor Vinge]]. The Shaper/Mechanist stories can be found in the collection ''Crystal Express'' and the collection ''Schismatrix Plus'', which contains the original novel ''Schismatrix'' and all of the stories set in the Shaper/Mechanist universe. [[Alastair Reynolds]] identified ''Schismatrix'' and the other Shaper/Mechanist stories as one of the greatest influences on his own work.<ref name="ar">{{cite web |url=http://www.impactlab.net/2008/04/16/bruce-sterling-at-the-innovations-forum/ |title=The World According to Bruce Sterling |publisher=Impact Lab |accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref>

In the 1980s, Sterling edited the science fiction critical [[fanzine]] [[Cheap Truth]], under the alias of Vincent Omniaveritas. He wrote a column called ''[[Catscan (magazine column)|Catscan]]'', for the now-defunct science fiction critical magazine, ''SF Eye''.

He recently contributed a chapter to ''Sound Unbound: Sampling Digital Music and Culture'' (The MIT Press, 2008) edited by Paul D. Miller a.k.a. [[DJ Spooky]]. He also contributed, along with Lewis Shiner, to the short story "[[Mozart in Mirrorshades]]".

From April 2009 through May 2009, he was an editor at [[Cool Tools]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/003672.php |title=Cool Tools: New Editor, Same Deal |publisher=Kk.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-01}}</ref>

Since October 2003<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2003/10/hello_world/ |title=HELLO WORLD &#124; Beyond The Beyond |publisher=Wired.com |date=2003-10-30 |accessdate=2010-01-01}}</ref> Sterling has blogged at [http://blog.wired.com/sterling/ "Beyond the Beyond"], which is hosted by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''.

His most recent novel (as of 2013) is ''Love Is Strange'' (December 2012), a Paranormal Romance (40k).

===Projects===
He has been the instigator of three projects which can be found on the Web -
* The [[Dead Media Project]] - A collection of "research notes" on dead media technologies, from [[Inca]]n [[quipu]]s, through Victorian [[phenakistoscope]]s, to the departed [[video game]] and home computers of the 1980s. The Project's homepage, including Sterling's original ''Dead Media Manifesto'' can be found at http://www.deadmedia.org
* The [[Viridian Design Movement]] - his attempt to create a "green" design movement focused on high-tech, stylish, and ecologically sound design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigpicture.tv/index.php?id=83&cat=&a=224 |title=Big Picture Business |publisher=Bigpicture.tv |date= |accessdate=2012-12-09}}</ref> The Viridian Design home page, including Sterling's ''Viridian Manifesto'' and all of his ''Viridian Notes'', is managed by [[Jon Lebkowsky]] at http://www.viridiandesign.org. The Viridian Movement helped to spawn the popular "bright green" environmental weblog [[Worldchanging]]. WorldChanging contributors include many of the original members of the Viridian "curia".
* Embrace the Decay - a web-only art piece commissioned by the LA Museum of Contemporary Art in 2003.<ref>[http://www.moca.org/museum/dg_detail.php?&dgDetail=bsterling "DIGITAL GALLERY: Bruce Sterling: Embrace the Decay"], ''moca.org''</ref> Incorporating contributions solicited through The Viridian Design 'movement', Embrace the Decay was the most visited piece/page at LA MOCA's Digital Gallery, and included contributions from Jared Tarbell of [http://www.levitated.net/ levitated.net] and co-author of several books on advanced Flash programming, and Monty Zukowski, creator of the winning 'decay algorithm' sponsored by Bruce.

===Neologisms===
Sterling has a habit of coining [[neologisms]] to describe things which he believes will be common in the future, especially items which already exist in limited numbers.
* In the December 2005 issue of Wired magazine, Sterling coined the term buckyjunk. Buckyjunk refers to future, difficult-to-recycle consumer waste made of carbon nanotubes (a.k.a. buckytubes, based on buckyballs or [[fullerene|buckminsterfullerene]]).
* In July 1989, in ''SF Eye #5'', he was the first to use the word "[[slipstream (genre)|slipstream]]" to refer to a type of speculative fiction between traditional science fiction and fantasy and mainstream literature.
* In December 1999 he coined the term "Wexelblat disaster", for a disaster caused when a natural disaster triggers a secondary, and more damaging, failure of human technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.viridiandesign.org/notes/101-125/00120.html |title=Viridian Note 00120: Viridian Disasters (Storms in France) |publisher=Viridiandesign.org |date=1999-12-27 |accessdate=2010-01-01}}</ref>
* In his book ''Zeitgeist'' (2000), he introduced the term [[Major consensus narrative]] as an explanatory [[synonym]] for [[truth]].
* In August 2004 he suggested a type of technological device (he called it "[[spime]]") that, through pervasive [[RFID]] and [[GPS]] tracking, can track its history of use and interact with the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.viridiandesign.org/notes/401-450/00422_the_spime.html |title=Viridian Note |publisher=Viridiandesign.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-01}}</ref>
* In the speech where he offered "spime", he noted that the term "[[blobject]]", with which he is sometimes credited, was passed on to him by industrial designer [[Karim Rashid]]. The term may originally have been coined by [[Steven Skov Holt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2005/julaug/features/curve.html |title=STANFORD Magazine: July/August 2005 > Thrown a Curve |publisher=Stanfordalumni.org |date=2003-07-02 |accessdate=2010-01-01}}</ref>
* He discussed and expanded on [[Sophia Al Maria]]'s  neologism  "Gulf Futurism" in his column for Wired Magazine "Beyond The Beyond" <ref>{{cite web|author=Bruce SterlingEmail Author |url=http://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2012/11/gulf-futurism/ |title=Gulf Futurism &#124; Beyond The Beyond |publisher=Wired.com |date=1999-12-07 |accessdate=2012-12-09}}</ref>
