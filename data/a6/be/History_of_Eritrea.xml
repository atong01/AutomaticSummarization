Other scholars, including the former Attorney-General of Ethiopia,<space/><link><target>Baraket Selassie</target><part>Bereket Habte Selassie</part></link>, contend that, &quot;religious tensions here and there...were exploited by the British, [but] most Eritreans (Christians and Moslems) were united in their goal of freedom and independence.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="un"></extension><space/>Almost immediately after the federation went into effect, however, these rights began to be abridged or violated. These pleas for independence and referendum augured poorly for the US, Britain and Ethiopia, as a confidential American estimate of Independence Party support amounted to 75% of Eritrea.<extension extension_name='ref'>Department of State, Incoming Telegram, received 1949-08-22, From Addis Ababa, signed MERREL, to Secretary of State, No. 171, 1949-08-19</extension></paragraph><paragraph>The details of Eritrea's association with Ethiopia were established by the<space/><link><target>UN General Assembly</target></link><space/>Resolution 390A (V) of 2 December 1950. It called for Eritrea and Ethiopia to be linked through a loose federal structure under the sovereignty of the Emperor. Eritrea was to have its own administrative and judicial structure, its own flag, and control over its domestic affairs, including police, local administration, and taxation.<extension extension_name='ref' name="un"></extension><space/>The federal government, which for all intents and purposes was the existing imperial government, was to control foreign affairs (including commerce), defense, finance, and transportation. As a result of a long history of a strong landowning peasantry and the virtual absence of serfdom in most parts of Eritrea, the bulk of Eritreans had developed a distinct sense of cultural identity and superiority vis--vis Ethiopians. This combined with the introduction of modern democracy into Eritrea by the British administration gave Eritreans a desire for political freedoms alien to Ethiopian political tradition. From the start of the federation, however, Haile Selassie attempted to undercut Eritreas independent status, a policy that alienated many Eritreans. The Emperor pressured Eritreas elected chief executive to resign, made Amharic the official language in place of Arabic and Tigrinya, terminated the use of the Eritrean flag, imposed censorship, and moved many businesses out of Eritrea. Finally, in 1962 Haile Selassie pressured the Eritrean Assembly to abolish the Federation and join the Imperial Ethiopian fold, much to the dismay of those in Eritrea who favored a more liberal political order.</paragraph><heading level='2'>War for independence</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Eritrean War of Independence</arg></template><link><target>Image:LocationEthiopia before1993.png</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>Map of Eritrea attached to Ethiopia.</part></link>Militant opposition to the incorporation of Eritrea into Ethiopia had begun in 1958 with the founding of the<space/><link><target>Eritrean Liberation Movement</target></link><space/>(ELM), an organization made up mainly of students, intellectuals, and urban wage laborers.

In contrast to the ELM, from the outset the ELF was bent on waging armed struggle on behalf of Eritrean independence. The ELF was composed mainly of Eritrean Muslims from the rural lowlands on the western edge of the territory. In 1961 the ELF's political character was vague, but radical Arab states such as<space/><link><target>Syria</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Iraq</target></link><space/>saw Eritrea as a predominantly Muslim region struggling to escape Ethiopian oppression and imperial domination. These two countries therefore supplied military and financial assistance to the ELF.</paragraph><paragraph>The ELF initiated military operations in 1961 and intensified its activities in response to the dissolution of the federation in 1962. By 1967 the ELF had gained considerable support among peasants, particularly in Eritrea's north and west, and around the port city of<space/><link><target>Massawa</target></link>. Haile Selassie attempted to calm the growing unrest by visiting Eritrea and assuring its inhabitants that they would be treated as equals under the new arrangements. Although he doled out offices, money, and titles mainly to Christian highlanders in the hope of co-opting would-be Eritrean opponents in early 1967, the imperial secret police of Ethiopia also set up a wide network of informants in Eritrea and conducted disappearances, intimidations and assassinations among the same populace driving several prominent political figures into exile. Imperial police fired live ammunition killing scores of youngsters during several student demonstrations in Asmara in this time. The imperial army also actively perpetrated massacres until the ousting of the Emperor by the Derg in 1974.<link><target>File:Eritrean Independence War.gif</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>Map of the<space/><link><target>Eritrean War of Independence</target></link></part></link>By 1971 ELF activity had become enough of a threat that the emperor had declared<space/><link><target>martial law</target></link><space/>in Eritrea. He deployed roughly half of the Ethiopian army to contain the struggle. Internal disputes over strategy and tactics eventually led to the ELF's fragmentation and the founding in 1972 of the<space/><link><target>Eritrean People's Liberation Front</target></link><space/>(EPLF). The leadership of this multi-ethnic movement came to be dominated by leftist, Christian dissidents who spoke Tigrinya, Eritrea's predominant language. Sporadic armed conflict ensued between the two groups from 1972 to 1974, even as they fought Ethiopian forces. By the late 1970s, the EPLF had become the dominant armed Eritrean group fighting against the Ethiopian Government, and<space/><link><target>Isaias Afewerki</target></link><space/>had emerged as its leader. Much of the material used to combat Ethiopia was captured from the army.</paragraph><paragraph>By 1977 the EPLF seemed poised to drive the Ethiopians out of Eritrea. However, that same year a massive airlift of<space/><link><target>Soviet Union</target><part>Soviet</part></link><space/>arms to Ethiopia enabled the Ethiopian Army to regain the initiative and forced the EPLF to retreat to the bush. Between 1978 and 1986 the Derg launched eight unsuccessful major offensives against the independence movement. In 1988 the EPLF captured<space/><link><target>Afabet</target></link>, headquarters of the Ethiopian Army in northeastern Eritrea, putting approximately a third of the Ethiopian Army out of action and prompting the Ethiopian Army to withdraw from its garrisons in Eritrea's western lowlands. EPLF fighters then moved into position around<space/><link><target>Keren, Eritrea</target><part>Keren</part></link>, Eritrea's second-largest city. Meanwhile, other dissident movements were making headway throughout Ethiopia. At the end of the 1980s the Soviet Union informed Mengistu that it would not renew its defense and cooperation agreement. With the withdrawal of Soviet support and supplies, the Ethiopian Army's morale plummeted, and the EPLF, along with other Ethiopian rebel forces, began to advance on Ethiopian positions.

The EPLF attended the July conference as an observer and held talks with the new transitional government regarding Eritrea's relationship to Ethiopia. The outcome of those talks was an agreement in which the Ethiopians recognized the right of the Eritreans to hold a referendum on independence.</paragraph><paragraph>Although some EPLF cadres at one time espoused a Marxist ideology, Soviet support for Mengistu had cooled their ardor. The fall of<space/><link><target>communist</target></link><space/>regimes in the former Soviet Union and the<space/><link><target>Eastern Bloc</target></link><space/>convinced them it was a failed system. The EPLF now says it is committed to establishing a democratic form of government and a free-market economy in Eritrea. The United States agreed to provide assistance to both Ethiopia and Eritrea, conditional on continued progress toward democracy and human rights.</paragraph><paragraph>In May 1991 the EPLF established the Provisional Government of Eritrea (PGE) to administer Eritrean affairs until a referendum was held on independence and a permanent government established.

Amongst the terms of the agreement was the establishment of a UN peacekeeping operation, known as the<space/><link><target>United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea</target></link><space/>(UNMEE); with over 4,000 UN peacekeepers. The UN established a temporary security zone consisting of a 25-kilometre<space/><link><target>demilitarized zone</target><part>demilitarized buffer zone</part></link><space/>within Eritrea, running along the length of the disputed border between the two states and patrolled by UN troops. Ethiopia was to withdraw to positions held before the outbreak of hostilities in May 1998. The Algiers agreement called for a final demarcation of the disputed border area between Eritrea and Ethiopia by the assignment of an independent, UN-associated body known as the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission (EEBC), whose task was to clearly identify the border between the two countries and issue a final and binding ruling. The peace agreement would be completed with the implementation of the Border Commission's ruling, which would also end the task of the peacekeeping mission. After extensive study, the Commission issued a final border ruling in April 2002, which awarded some territory to each side, but Badme (the flash point of the conflict) was awarded to Eritrea. The Commission's decision was rejected by Ethiopia. The border question remains in dispute, with Ethiopia refusing to withdraw its military from positions in the disputed areas, including Badme, while a &quot;difficult&quot; peace remains in place.</paragraph><paragraph>The UNMEE mission was formally abandoned in July 2008, after experiencing serious difficulties in sustaining its troops after fuel stoppages.</paragraph><paragraph>Furthermore, Eritrea's diplomatic relations with<space/><link><target>Djibouti</target></link><space/>were briefly severed during the border war with Ethiopia in 1998 due to a dispute over Djibouti's intimate relation with Ethiopia during the war but were restored and normalized in 2000.

Amnesty International notes that in a country where the average life expectancy is 61 or 62, this means many spend their entire adult lives in the army, frequently facing hard labor and meager wages. Women have fled the army because they are denied the opportunity to start a family if they remain in the Eritrean military, and Eritrean army officers also have the right to have sex with subordinate female soldiers, as it's not legally considered rape. Every month about 3,000 people flee the East African country. According to a recent United Nations report, more than 84 percent of Eritreans who have sought asylum around the world have been recognized as refugees deserving asylum status.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Continuing border conflicts</heading><paragraph><template><target>see also</target><arg>2008 Djiboutian–Eritrean border conflict</arg><arg>2010 Eritrea–Ethiopia border skirmish</arg></template>On 19 June 2008 the BBC published a time line of the conflict and reported that the &quot;Border dispute rumbles on&quot;:<template><target>quote</target><arg>
