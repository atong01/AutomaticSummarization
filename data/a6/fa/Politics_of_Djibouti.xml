The party system and parliament are dominated by the conservative<space/><link><target>People's Rally for Progress</target></link>. In April 2010, a new national constitution was approved. The president serves as the head of state, and is popularly elected for single five year terms. Government is headed by the prime minister, who is appointed by the president and the Council of Ministers. There is also a 65-member chamber of deputies, where representatives are popularly elected for terms of five years. Administratively, the country is divided into five regions and one city, with eleven additional<space/><link><target>Districts of Djibouti</target><part>district</part></link><space/>subdivisions.

By the time of the national assembly elections in December 1992, only three had qualified. They are the<space/><italics>Rassemblement Populaire Pour le Progres</italics><space/>(<link><target>People's Rally for Progress</target></link>) (RPP) which was the only legal party from 1981 until 1992, the<space/><italics>Parti du Renouveau Dmocratique</italics><space/>(The<space/><link><target>Party for Democratic Renewal</target></link>) (PRD), and the<space/><italics>Parti National Dmocratique</italics><space/>(<link><target>National Democratic Party (Djibouti)</target><part>National Democratic Party</part></link>) (PND). Only the RPP and the PRD contested the national assembly elections, and the PND withdrew, claiming that there were too many unanswered questions on the conduct of the elections and too many opportunities for government fraud. The RPP won all 65 seats in the national assembly, with a turnout of less than 50% of the electorate.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1999, President Aptidon's chief of staff, head of security, and key adviser for over 20 years,<space/><link><target>Ismail Omar Guelleh</target></link><space/>was elected to the Presidency as the RPP candidate.<extension extension_name='ref' name="IRIN"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="title">DJIBOUTI: Guelleh sworn in for second presidential term<space/></arg><arg name="url">http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID</arg><arg name="publisher">IRIN Africa<space/></arg><arg name="date">May 9, 2005<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">March 20, 2013<space/></arg></template></extension><space/>He received 74% of the vote, the other 26% going to opposition candidate<space/><link><target>Moussa Ahmed Idriss</target></link>, of the<space/><link><target>Unified Djiboutian Opposition</target></link><space/>(ODU).

Guelleh took the oath of office as the second President of the Republic of Djibouti on May 8, 1999, with the support of an alliance between the RPP and the government-recognized section of the Afar-led FRUD.<link><target>File:Dileita Mohamed Dileita detail 090114-F-3682S-269.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>upright</part><part><link><target>Dileita Mohamed Dileita</target></link>, former Prime Minister of Djibouti, Vice-President of the<space/><link><target>People's Rally for Progress</target></link><space/>(RPP), and President of the Union for a Presidential Majority (UMP).</part></link>Currently, political power is shared by a Somali Issa president and an Afar prime minister, with cabinet posts roughly divided.
