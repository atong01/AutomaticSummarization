Such software is referred to as a<space/><italics>disk</italics><space/>operating system when the storage devices it manages are made of rotating platters, such as<space/><link><target>floppy disk</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>hard disk</target><trail>s</trail></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>In the early days of<space/><link><target>microcomputer</target><trail>s</trail></link>,<space/><link><target>computer memory</target></link><space/>space was often limited, so the disk operating system was an extension of the operating system. This component was only loaded if needed.

On the<space/><link><target>PC compatible</target></link><space/>platform, an entire family of operating systems was called<space/><italics>DOS</italics>.</paragraph><heading level='2'>History</heading><paragraph>In the early days of computers, there were no disk drives, floppies or modern flash storage devices. Early storage devices such as<space/><link><target>Digital delay line</target><part>delay line</part><trail>s</trail></link>,<space/><link><target>punched card</target><trail>s</trail></link>,<space/><link><target>paper tape</target></link>,<space/><link><target>magnetic tape</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>magnetic drum</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>were used instead. And in the early days of microcomputers, paper tape or<space/><link><target>audio cassette tape</target></link><space/>(see<space/><link><target>Kansas City standard</target></link>) or nothing were used instead. In the latter case, program and data entry was done at<space/><link><target>front panel</target></link><space/>switches directly into memory or through a<space/><link><target>computer terminal</target></link><space/>/ keyboard, sometimes controlled by a<space/><link><target>read-only memory</target></link><space/>(ROM)<space/><link><target>BASIC</target></link><space/>interpreter; when power was turned off after running the program, the information so entered vanished.</paragraph><paragraph>Both<space/><link><target>hard disk</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>floppy disk</target></link><space/>drives require software to manage rapid access to block storage of sequential and other data. When microcomputers rarely had expensive disk drives of any kind, the need to have software to manage such devices (the disks) carried much status. To have one or the other was a mark of distinction and prestige, and so was having the Disk sort of an Operating System. As prices for both disk hardware and operating system software decreased, there were many such microcomputer systems.</paragraph><paragraph>Mature versions of the<space/><link><target>Commodore 64</target><part>Commodore</part></link>,<space/><link><target>SWTPC</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Atari 8-bit family</target><part>Atari</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Apple Computer</target><part>Apple</part></link><space/><link><target>home computer</target></link><space/>systems all featured a disk operating system (actually called 'DOS' in the case of the Commodore 64 (<italics><link><target>CBM DOS</target></link></italics>), Atari 800 (<italics><link><target>Atari DOS</target></link></italics>), and Apple II machines (<italics><link><target>Apple DOS</target></link></italics>)), as did (at the other end of the hardware spectrum, and much earlier)<space/><link><target>IBM</target></link>'s<space/><link><target>System/360</target></link>,<space/><link><target>System/370</target><part>370</part></link><space/>and (later)<space/><link><target>System/390</target><part>390</part></link><space/>series of<space/><link><target>IBM mainframe</target><part>mainframe</part><trail>s</trail></link><space/>(e.g.,<space/><link><target>DOS/360</target></link>:<space/><bold><italics>D</italics>'isk<space/></bold>O<bold>perating<space/></bold>S<bold>ystem / 360<italics><space/>and<space/><link><target>VSE (operating system)</target><part>DOS/VSE</part></link>:<space/></italics></bold>D<bold>isk<space/></bold>O<bold>perating<space/></bold>S<bold>ystem /<space/></bold>V<bold>irtual<space/></bold>S<bold>torage<space/></bold>E<italics>'xtended</italics>).
