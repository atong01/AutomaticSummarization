Many of the generic forms of documentary, for example the biopic or profile; or the observational piece. These generic forms are explored on the University of Winchester Journalism Department 'features web' where 'long form journalism' is classified by genre or content, rather than in terms of production as film, radio or 'print'.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://journalism.winchester.ac.uk/?page=299'>University of Winchester Journalism Department Feature Writing and Documentary Making</link></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>History</heading><heading level='3'>Pre-1900</heading><paragraph>Early film (pre-1900) was dominated by the novelty of showing an event. They were single-shot moments captured on film: a train entering a station, a boat docking, or factory workers leaving work. These short films were called &quot;actuality&quot; films; the term &quot;documentary&quot; was not coined until 1926. Many of the first films, such as those made by<space/><link><target>Auguste and Louis Lumire</target></link>, were a minute or less in length, due to technological limitations.</paragraph><paragraph>Films showing many people (for example, leaving a factory) were often made for commercial reasons: the people being filmed were eager to see, for payment, the film showing them.

Until 1906, the year of his last film, Doyen recorded more than 60 operations. Doyen said that his first films taught him how to correct professional errors he had been unaware of. For scientific purposes, after 1906 Doyen combined 15 of his films into three compilations, two of which survive, the six-film series<space/><italics>Extirpation des tumeurs encapsules</italics><space/>(1906), and the four-film<space/><italics>Les Oprations sur la cavit crnienne</italics><space/>(1911).

More recent examples include<space/><italics><link><target>Point of Order (film)</target><part>Point of Order</part></link></italics><space/>(1964), directed by<space/><link><target>Emile de Antonio</target></link><space/>about the McCarthy hearings, and<space/><italics><link><target>The Atomic Cafe</target></link></italics><space/>which is made entirely out of found footage that various agencies of the U.S. government made about the safety of nuclear radiation (for example, telling troops at one point that it is safe to be irradiated as long as they keep their eyes and mouths shut).

The poetic mode moved away from continuity editing and instead organized images of the material world by means of associations and patterns, both in terms of time and space. Well-rounded characters&quot;lifelike people&quot;were absent; instead, people appeared in these films as entities, just like any other, that are found in the material world. The films were fragmentary, impressionistic, lyrical. Their disruption of the coherence of time and spacea coherence favored by the fiction films of the daycan also be seen as an element of the modernist counter-model of cinematic narrative. The &quot;real world&quot;Nichols calls it the &quot;historical world&quot;was broken up into fragments and aesthetically reconstituted using film form. Examples of this style include Joris Ivens'<space/><italics>Rain</italics><space/>(1928), which records a passing summer shower over Amsterdam; Lszl Moholy-Nagy's<space/><italics>Play of Light: Black, White, Grey (1930)</italics>, in which he films one of his own kinetic sculptures, emphasizing not the sculpture itself but the play of light around it; Oskar Fischinger's abstract animated films; Francis Thompson's<space/><italics>N.Y., N.Y.</italics><space/>(1957), a city symphony film; and Chris Marker's<space/><italics>Sans Soleil</italics><space/>(1982).</paragraph><paragraph>Expository documentaries speak directly to the viewer, often in the form of an authoritative commentary employing voiceover or titles, proposing a strong argument and point of view. These films are rhetorical, and try to persuade the viewer. (They may use a rich and sonorous male voice.) The (voice-of-God) commentary often sounds 'objective' and omniscient. Images are often not paramount; they exist to advance the argument. The rhetoric insistently presses upon us to read the images in a certain fashion. Historical documentaries in this mode deliver an unproblematic and 'objective' account and interpretation of past events.</paragraph><paragraph>Examples: TV shows and films like A&amp;E Biography; America's Most Wanted; many science and nature documentaries; Ken Burns' The Civil War (1990); Robert Hughes' The Shock of the New (1980); John Berger's Ways Of Seeing (1974). Also, Frank Capra's wartime Why We Fight series; Pare Lorentz's The Plow That Broke The Plains (1936)</paragraph><heading level='3'>Observational documentaries</heading><paragraph>Observational documentaries attempt to simply and spontaneously observe lived life with a minimum of intervention. Filmmakers who worked in this subgenre often saw the poetic mode as too abstract and the expository mode as too didactic. The first observational docs date back to the 1960s; the technological developments which made them possible include mobile lighweight cameras and portable sound recording equipment for synchronized sound. Often, this mode of film eschewed voice-over commentary, post-synchronized dialogue and music, or re-enactments. The films aimed for immediacy, intimacy, and revelation of individual human character in ordinary life situations.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Types of documentaries</heading><paragraph><bold>Participatory documentaries</bold><space/>believe that it is impossible for the act of filmmaking to not influence or alter the events being filmed. What these films do is emulate the approach of the anthropologist: participant-observation. Not only is the filmmaker part of the film, we also get a sense of how situations in the film are affected or altered by her presence. Nichols: &quot;The filmmaker steps out from behind the cloak of voice-over commentary, steps away from poetic meditation, steps down from a fly-on-the-wall perch, and becomes a social actor (almost) like any other. (Almost like any other because the filmmaker retains the camera, and with it, a certain degree of potential power and control over events.)&quot; The encounter between filmmaker and subject becomes a critical element of the film. Rouch and Morin named the approach cinma vrit, translating Dziga Vertov's kinopravda into French; the &quot;truth&quot; refers to the truth of the encounter rather than some absolute truth.</paragraph><paragraph><bold>Reflexive documentaries</bold><space/>do not see themselves as a transparent window on the world; instead they draw attention to their own constructedness, and the fact that they are representations. How does the world get represented by documentary films? This question is central to this subgenre of films. They prompt us to &quot;question the authenticity of documentary in general.&quot; It is the most self-conscious of all the modes, and is highly skeptical of 'realism'. It may use Brechtian alienation strategies to jar us, in order to 'defamiliarize' what we are seeing and how we are seeing it.</paragraph><paragraph><bold>Performative documentaries</bold><space/>stress subjective experience and emotional response to the world. They are strongly personal, unconventional, perhaps poetic and/or experimental, and might include hypothetical enactments of events designed to make us experience what it might be like for us to possess a certain specific perspective on the world that is not our own, e.g. that of black, gay men in Marlon Riggs's<space/><italics>Tongues Untied</italics><space/>(1989) or Jenny Livingston's<space/><italics>Paris Is Burning</italics><space/>(1991). This subgenre might also lend itself to certain groups (e.g. women, ethnic minorities, gays and lesbians, etc.) to 'speak about themselves.' Often, a battery of techniques, many borrowed from fiction or avant-garde films, are used. Performative docs often link up personal accounts or experiences with larger political or historical realities.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Translation of documentaries</heading><paragraph>There are several challenges associated with translation of documentaries, the main two are: working conditions and problems with terminology.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Working conditions</heading><paragraph>Documentary translators very often have to meet tight deadlines. Normally, the translator has between five and seven days to hand over the translation of a 90-minute programme. Dubbing studios typically give translators a week to translate a documentary, but in order to earn a good salary, translators have to deliver their translations in a much shorter period, usually when the studio decides to deliver the final programme to the client sooner or when the broadcasting channel sets a tight deadline, e.g. on documentaries discussing the latest news.<extension extension_name='ref'>Matamala, A.

Bristol, UK: Multilingual Matters, p. 110-111.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Another problem is the lack of postproduction script or the poor quality of the transcription. A correct transcription is essential for a translator to do their work properly, however many times the script is not even given to the translator, which is a major impediment since documentaries are characterised by &quot;the abundance of terminological units and very specific proper names&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Matamala, A. 2009 pp. 109-120">Matamala, A. (2009). Main Challenges in the Translation of Documentaries. In J. Cintas (Ed.), New Trends in Audiovisual Translation (pp. 109-120). Bristol, UK: Multilingual Matters, p. 111</extension><space/>When the script is given to the translator, it is usually poorly transcribed or outright incorrect making the translation unnecessary difficult and demanding because all of the proper names and specific terminology have to be correct in a documentary programme in order for it to be a reliable source of information, hence the translator has to check every term on their own. Such mistakes in proper names are for instance: &quot;Jungle Reinhard instead of Django Reinhart, Jorn Asten instead of Jane Austen and Magnus Axle instead of Aldous Huxley&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Matamala, A. 2009 pp. 109-120"></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Terminology</heading><paragraph>The process of translation of a documentary programme requires working with very specific, often scientific terminology. Documentary translators usually are not specialist in a given field, therefore they are compelled to undertake extensive research whenever asked to make a translation of a specific documentary programme in order to understand it correctly and deliver the final product free of mistakes and inaccuracies. Generally, documentaries contain a large amount of specific terms, with which translators have to familiarise themselves on their own, for example:</paragraph><paragraph><extension extension_name='blockquote'>The documentary<space/><italics>Beetles, Record Breakers</italics><space/>makes use of 15 different terms to refer to beetles in less than 30 minutes (longhorn beetle, cellar beetle, stag beetle, burying beetle or gravediggers, sexton beetle, tiger beetle, bloody nose beetle, tortoise beetle, diving beetle, devils coach horse, weevil, click beetle, malachite beetle, oil beetle, cockchafer), apart from mentioning other animals such as horseshoe bats or meadow brown butterflies.<extension extension_name='ref'>Matamala, A.

Bristol, UK: Multilingual Matters, p. 113</extension></extension></paragraph><paragraph>This poses a real challenge for the translators because they have to render the meaning, i.e. find an equivalent, of a very specific, scientific term in the target language and frequently the narrator uses a more general name instead of a specific term and the translator has to rely on the image presented in the programme to understand which term is being discussed in order to transpose it in the target language accordingly.<extension extension_name='ref'>Matamala, A.

Bristol, UK: Multilingual Matters, p. 113-114</extension><space/>Additionally, translators of minorised languages often have to face another problem: some terms may not even exist in the target language. In such case they have to create new terminology or consult specialists to find proper solutions. Also, sometimes the official nomenclature differs from the terminology used by actual specialists, which leaves the translator to decide between using the official vocabulary that can be found in the dictionary, or rather opting for spontaneous expressions used by real experts in real situations.<extension extension_name='ref'>Matamala, A.
