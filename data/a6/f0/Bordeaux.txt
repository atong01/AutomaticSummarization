'''Bordeaux''' ({{IPA-fr|bɔʁdo}}; [[Gascon language|Gascon]]: ''Bordèu''; {{lang-eu|Bordele}}) is a port city on the [[Garonne]] River in the [[Gironde]] [[Departments of France|department]] in southwestern [[France]].

The municipality ([[Communes of France|commune]]) of Bordeaux proper has a population of 241,287 (2012).<ref name="commune_pop">{{cite web |url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau.asp?reg_id=0&ref_id=nattef01214 |title=Taille des communes les plus peuplées en 2012 |publisher=[[INSEE]] |accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref> Together with its [[suburb]]s and [[satellite town]]s Bordeaux is the center of the [[Urban Community of Bordeaux|Bordeaux Métropole]], which with 737,492 inhabitants (as of 2012) is the 9th largest in France. It is the capital of the [[Aquitaine]] region, as well as the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of the [[Gironde]] department. Its inhabitants are called "Bordelais" (for men) or "Bordelaises" (women). The term "Bordelais" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.

The city's nicknames are "La perle d'Aquitaine" (The Pearl of Aquitaine), and "La Belle Endormie" (Sleeping Beauty) in reference to the old center which had black walls due to pollution. Nowadays, this is not the case. In fact, a part of the city, Le Port de La Lune, was almost completely renovated.

Bordeaux is the world's major wine industry capital. It is home to the world's main wine fair, {{ill|fr|Vinexpo|Vinexpo Bordeaux}},<ref>[http://www.vinexpo.com/en/a-propos/historique] {{wayback|df=yes|url=http://www.vinexpo.com/en/a-propos/historique |date=20120312003120 }}</ref> while the wine economy in the metro area takes in 14.5&nbsp;billion euros each year. [[Bordeaux wine]] has been produced in the region since the 8th century. The historic part of the city is on the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage List]] as "an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble" of the 18th century.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_pictures/6249110.stm |title=In pictures: New World Heritage sites |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=28 June 2007 |accessdate=5 May 2009}}</ref>

[[File:Bituriges Vivisci.jpg|thumb|left|Coins of the [[Bituriges Vivisci]], 5th–1st century BC, derived from the coin designs of [[Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul]]. [[Cabinet des Médailles]].]]

In historical times, around 300 BCE it was the settlement of a [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic tribe]], the [[Bituriges Vivisci]], who named the town ''Burdigala'', probably of Aquitainian origin. The name Bourde is still the name of a river south of the city.

In 107 BCE, the [[Battle of Burdigala]] was fought by the Romans who were defending the [[Allobroges]], a [[Gauls|Gallic tribe]] allied to Rome, and the [[Tigurini]] led by [[Divico]]. The Romans were defeated and their commander, the [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Lucius Cassius Longinus (consul 107 BC)|Lucius Cassius Longinus]], was killed in the action.

The city fell under [[ancient Rome|Roman]] rule around 60 BC, its importance lying in the commerce of [[tin]] and [[lead]] towards Rome. Later it became capital of [[Gallia Aquitania|Roman Aquitaine]], flourishing especially during the [[Severan dynasty]] (3rd century). In 276 it was sacked by the [[Vandals]]. Further ravage was brought by the same Vandals in 409, the [[Visigoths]] in 414 and the [[Franks]] in 498, beginning a period of obscurity for the city.

[[File:Merovingian tremisses minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint Etienne late 6th century.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Tremissis|tremisses]] minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint-Étienne, late 6th century. [[British Museum]].]]
In the late 6th century, the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Francia|kingdom of the Franks]], but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish [[Duchy of Vasconia]]. Circa 585, a certain Gallactorius is cited as count of Bordeaux and fighting the Basques.

The city was plundered by the troops of [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi|Abd er Rahman]] in 732 after storming the fortified city and overwhelming the Aquitanian garrison. [[Odo the Great|Duke Eudes]] mustered a force ready to engage the Umayyads outside Bordeaux, eventually taking on them in the [[Battle of the River Garonne]] somewhere near the river Dordogne, described as taking a heavy death toll. After duke Eudes's defeat, the Aquitanian duke could still save part of its troops and keep his grip on Aquitaine after the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]].

In 735, the Aquitanian duke Hunald led a rebellion after his father Eudes's death, at which Charles responded by sending an expedition that captured and plundered Bordeaux again, but it was not retained for long. The following year, the Frankish commander descended again over Aquitaine, but clashed in battle with the Aquitanians and left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745, Aquitaine faced yet another expedition by Charles' sons Pepin and Carloman against Hunald, the Aquitanian ''princeps'' (or duke) strong in Bordeaux. Hunald was defeated, and his son [[Waiofar|Waifer]] replaced him, who in turn confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).

During the last stage of the [[Pepin the Short#Expansion of the Frankish realm|war against Aquitaine]] (760-768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to King [[Pepin the Short]]'s troops. Next to Bordeaux, Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (''Frontiacus'', ''Franciacus'') on a hill across the border with the Basques (''Wascones''), where Basque commanders came over to vow loyalty to him (769).

In 778, [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin (or Sihimin)]] was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupo]], and possibly leading to the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]] that very year. In 814, Seguin was made Duke of Vasconia, but he was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress or sympathise with a Basque rebellion. Under the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]], sometimes the [[Count of Bordeaux|Counts of Bordeaux]] held the title concomitantly with that of [[Duke of Gascony|Duke of Vasconia]]. They were meant to keep the Basques in check  and defend the mouth of the [[Garonne]] from the [[Viking]]s when the latter appeared c. 844 in the region of Bordeaux. In Autumn 845, count [[Seguin II of Gascony|Seguin II]] marched on the Vikings assaulting Bordeaux and Saintes, but was captured and put to death. There are no bishops mentioned during the whole 8th century and part of the 9th in Bordeaux.

From the 12th to the 15th century, Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] with the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in [[Le Mans]], who became, within months of their wedding, King [[Henry II of England]]. The city flourished, primarily due to the wine trade, and the [[Bordeaux Cathedral|cathedral of St. André]] was built. It was also the capital of an independent state under [[Edward, the Black Prince]] (1362–1372), but in the end, after the [[Battle of Castillon]] (1453), it was annexed by France which extended its territory. The ''Château Trompette'' (Trumpet Castle) and the ''Fort du Hâ'', built by [[Charles VII of France]], were the symbols of the new domination, which however deprived the city of its wealth by halting the wine commerce with England.

In 1462, Bordeaux obtained a parliament, but regained importance only in the 16th century when it became the center of the distribution of sugar and slaves from the [[Caribbean|West Indies]] along with the traditional wine.<ref>''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'', "Bordeaux struggles with slave past", 28 September 2009.</ref>

Bordeaux adhered to the [[Fronde]], being effectively annexed to the Kingdom of France only in 1653, when the army of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] entered the city.
[[File:Edouard Manet 026.jpg|thumb|[[Édouard Manet]]: ''Harbour at Bordeaux'', 1871]]
[[File:Bordeaux rue Sainte-Catherine avril 1905.jpg|thumb|right|Rue Sainte-Catherine in 1905]]

The 18th century was the golden age of Bordeaux. Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. [[Victor Hugo]] found the town so beautiful he once said: "Take [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]], add [[Antwerp]], and you have Bordeaux". [[Baron Haussmann]], a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] to transform a then still quasi-medieval [[Paris]] into a "modern" capital that would make France proud.

In 1814, towards the end of the [[Peninsula war]], the [[Duke of Wellington]]  sent [[William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford|William Beresford]] with two divisions, who seized Bordeaux without much resistance on 12 March. Bordeaux was largely anti-[[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]] and had a majority that supported the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], so the British troops were treated as liberators.

In 1870, at the beginning of the [[Franco-Prussian war]] against [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the French government relocated to Bordeaux from Paris. This happened again during the [[World War I|First World War]] and again very briefly during the [[World War II|Second World War]], when it became clear that Paris would soon fall into German hands. However, on the last of these occasions the French capital was soon moved again to [[Vichy]]. In May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, [[Aristides de Sousa Mendes]], who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.

From 1940 to 1943, the [[Regia Marina|Italian Royal Navy]] (''[[Regia Marina]] Italiana'') established [[BETASOM]], a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the [[Battle of the Atlantic (1939–1945)|Battle of the Atlantic]] from this base, which was also a major base for German [[U-boat]]s as headquarters of [[12th U-boat Flotilla]]. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.

== Geography ==
Bordeaux is located close to the European [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the river [[Garonne]], and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. In Bordeaux, the [[Garonne]] River is accessible to [[ocean liner]]s. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.

=== Climate ===
Bordeaux's climate is usually classified as an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''); however, the summers tend to be warmer and the winters milder than most areas of similar classification. Substantial summer rainfall prevents its climate from being classified as [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]].

Winters are mild because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches {{convert|21|to|22|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}. The average seasonal winter temperature is {{convert|7.1|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, but recent winters have been warmer than this. Frosts in the winter are commonplace, occurring several times during a winter, but snowfall is very rare, occurring only once every three years. The average summer seasonal temperature is {{convert|20.7|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. The [[2003 European heat wave|summer of 2003]] set a record with an average temperature of {{convert|23.3|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.<ref>GHCN climate, GISS world climate averages, 1971–2000</ref>

== Economy ==

Bordeaux is a major centre for business in [[France]] as it has the 6th largest metropolitan population in [[France]].

As of 2014, the GDP of Bordeaux is €32.7 Billion.

=== Wine ===
{{Main|Bordeaux wine}}
[[File:Sauternes 04.jpg|thumb|Sauternes vineyard]]

The vine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-1st century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since then.<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Hugh |title=World Atlas of Wine |edition=4th|year=1994 |place=London |publisher=Octopus Publishing Group Ltd |page=13}}</ref>

Bordeaux now has about {{convert|116160|ha|acre}} of [[vineyard]]s, 57 [[appellations]], 10,000 wine-producing châteaux and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intowine.com/bordeaux.html|title=Bordeaux Wine Region in France: World's Most Famous Fine Wine Region|publisher=IntoWine.com|accessdate=23 October 2009}}</ref> Bordeaux produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five ''premier cru'' ([[First Growth|first growth]]) red wines (four from Médoc and one, Château Haut-Brion, from Graves), established by the [[Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855]]:
The first growths are:

*[[Château Lafite Rothschild|Château Lafite-Rothschild]]
*[[Château Margaux]]
*[[Château Latour]]
*[[Château Haut-Brion]]
*[[Château Mouton Rothschild|Château Mouton-Rothschild]]

: In 1855 Mouton-Rothschild was ranked a Second Growth. In 1973, it was elevated to First Growth status.<ref>MacNeil, K. (2001). The Wine Bible. New York, NY: Workman.</ref>

Both red and [[Wine|white wines]] are made in Bordeaux. Red Bordeaux is called [[claret]] in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Merlot]], [[Cabernet Franc]], [[Petit verdot]], [[Malbec]], and, less commonly in recent years, [[Carménère]]. White Bordeaux is made from [[Sauvignon blanc]], [[Sémillon]], and [[Muscadelle]]. [[Graves#Sauternes AOC and Barsac AOC|Sauternes]] is a subregion of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, [[dessert wine]]s such as [[Château d'Yquem]].

Because of a wine glut ([[wine lake]]) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and [[vine pull schemes]], the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meanwhile however, the global demand for the first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.

=== Others ===
The [[Laser Mégajoule]] will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing [[Research|fundamental research]] and the development of the [[laser]] and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] technologies. This project, carried by the [[Minister of Defence (France)|French Ministry of Defence]], involves an investment of 2&nbsp;billion euros. The "Road of the lasers", a major project of [[regional planning]], promotes regional investment in optical and laser related industries leading to the Bordeaux area having the most important concentration of optical and laser expertise in Europe.

20,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault]], [[EADS Sogerma]], [[Snecma]], [[Thales Group|Thales]], SNPE, and others. The [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault Falcon]] private jets are built there as well as the [[military aircraft]] [[Dassault Rafale|Rafale]] and [[Dassault Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000]], the [[Airbus A380]] [[cockpit]], the [[Booster (rocketry)|boosters]] of [[Ariane 5]], and the [[M51 (missile)|M51 SLBM]] [[missile]].

Tourism, especially [[wine tourism]], is a major industry.

Access to the port from the Atlantic is via the [[Gironde estuary]]. Almost 9 million tons of goods arrive and leave each year.

== Population ==
At the January 2011 census, there were 239,399 inhabitants in the city proper ([[Communes of France|commune]]) of Bordeaux. Bordeaux in its hey day had a population of 262,662 in 1968.<ref name="commune_pop2">{{cite web |url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau.asp?reg_id=0&ref_id=nattef01214|title=Taille des communes les plus peuplées en 2012 |publisher=INSEE |accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref> The majority of the population is French, but there are sizable groups of [[Italian people|Italians]], [[Spanish people|Spaniards]] (Up to 20% of the Bordeaux population claim some degree of Spanish heritage), [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Germans]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.

The built-up area has grown for more than a century beyond the municipal borders of Bordeaux due to [[urban sprawl]], so that by the January 2011 census there were 1,140,668 people living in the overall [[Metropolitan Area (France)|metropolitan area]] of Bordeaux,<ref name="AU10_pop" /> only a fifth of whom lived in the city proper.

Bordeaux is classified "City of Art and History". The city is home to 362 ''[[monuments historiques]]'' (only Paris has more in France) with some buildings dating back to Roman times. Bordeaux has been inscribed on [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage List]] as ''"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble"''.

Bordeaux is home to one of Europe's biggest 18th-century architectural urban areas, making it a sought-after destination for tourists and cinema production crews. It stands out as one of the first French cities, after [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], to have entered an era of [[urbanism]] and metropolitan big scale projects, with the team Gabriel father and son, architects for King [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], under the supervision of two intendants (Governors), first [[Nicolas-François Dupré de Saint-Maur]] then the Marquis (Marquess) de Tourny.

=== Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas ===
Europe’s longest-span [[vertical-lift bridge]], the [[Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas]], was opened in 2013 in Bordeaux, spanning the River Garonne. The central lift span is 117&nbsp;m long and can be lifted vertically up to 53&nbsp;m to let tall ships pass underneath. The €160 million bridge was inaugurated by President [[François Hollande]] and Mayor [[Alain Juppé]] on 16 March 2013. The bridge was named after the late [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]], who was a former Prime Minister and [[Mayor (France)|Mayor]] of Bordeaux.

=== Shopping ===
Bordeaux has many shopping options. In the heart of Bordeaux is ''[[Sainte-Catherine Street (Bordeaux)|Rue Sainte-Catherine]]''. This pedestrian-only shopping street has {{convert|1.2|km|mi|sp=us}} of shops, restaurants and cafés; it is also one of the longest shopping streets in Europe. ''Rue Sainte-Catherine'' starts at ''Place de la Victoire'' and ends at ''Place de la Comédie'' by the ''Grand Théâtre''. The shops become progressively more upmarket as one moves towards ''Place de la Comédie'' and the nearby ''Cours de l'Intendance'' is where one finds the more exclusive shops and boutiques.

== Culture ==
[[File:GrandTheatreBordeaux2.jpg|thumb|[[Grand Théâtre de Bordeaux|Grand Théâtre]]]]

Bordeaux is also the first city in France to have created, in the 1980s, an architecture exhibition and research center, ''[[Arc en rêve]]''.
Bordeaux offers a large number of cinemas, theatres and is the home of the [[Grand Théâtre de Bordeaux|Opéra national de Bordeaux]]. There are many music venues of varying capacity. The city also offers several festivals throughout the year.

== Transport ==

=== Road ===
Bordeaux is an important road and [[Interchange (road)|motorway junction]]. The city is connected to Paris by the [[A10 autoroute (France)|A10]] motorway, with Lyon by the [[A89 autoroute|A89]], with Toulouse by the [[A62 autoroute|A62]], and with Spain by the [[A63 autoroute|A63]]. There is a {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Beltway|ring road]] called the "Rocade" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.

[[File:Bordeaux Pont de Pierre.jpg|thumb|Pont-de-Pierre]]

Bordeaux has five road bridges that cross the [[Garonne]], the [[Pont de pierre (Bordeaux)|Pont de pierre]] built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the [[Pont Saint Jean]], just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the [[Pont d'Aquitaine]], a suspended bridge downstream from downtown, and the [[Pont François Mitterrand]], located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the [[Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas]], was constructed in 2009–2012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a [[vertical-lift bridge]] with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.
Another bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.<ref>[http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc | La CUB<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Lacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. [[Bike lane|Cycle lanes]] and [[bus lane]]s that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid [[Bicycle sharing system]] with automated stations has been established in 2010.

=== Rail ===
The main [[railway station]], [[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]], near the center of the city, has 4&nbsp;million passengers a year. It is served by the French national ([[SNCF]]) railway's high speed train, the [[TGV]], that gets to Paris in three hours, with connections to major European centers such as [[Lille]], Brussels, [[Amsterdam]], [[Cologne]], Geneva and London. The [[TGV]] also serves [[Toulouse]] and [[Irun]] from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to [[Nantes]], Nice, [[Marseille]] and [[Lyon]]. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains ([[Transport express régional|TER]]) operated by the [[SNCF]] to [[Arcachon]], [[Limoges]], [[Agen]], [[Périgueux]], [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]], Le Médoc, Angoulême and [[Bayonne]].

Historically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by [[Gustave Eiffel]], to bring trains across the river direct into [[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]]. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.

The two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of {{convert|30|km/h|0|abbr=on}} became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has 4 tracks and allows trains to pass at {{convert|60|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://aquitaine.fr/politiques-regionales/transports/pont-ferroviaire-de-bordeaux.html Pont Ferroviaire de Bordeaux] on aquitaine.fr</ref> During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.

=== Air ===
Bordeaux is served by an [[international airport]], [[Bordeaux – Mérignac Airport|Aéroport de Bordeaux Mérignac]], located {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city center in the suburban city of [[Mérignac, Gironde|Mérignac]].

=== Trams, buses and boats ===
[[File:Aéroport Bx Mérignac.JPG|thumb|[[Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport]]]]
[[File:Bordeaux-lawn-track-&-vines1.jpg|thumb|Tramway in Bordeaux]]
Bordeaux has an important public transport system called [[Tram et Bus de la CUB]] (TBC). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:
* 3 [[Tramway de Bordeaux|tram lines]] ([[Bordeaux Tramway Line A|A]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line B|B]] and [[Bordeaux Tramway Line C|C]])
* 75 [[Bus lines in Bordeaux|bus routes]], all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)
* 13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)
* An [[Trolleybus|electric bus]] shuttle in the city center
* A boat shuttle on the Garonne river
This network is operated from 5&nbsp;am to 1&nbsp;am.

There had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the [[Tramway de Bordeaux]] system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses ground-level power supply technology [[Ground-level power supply|(APS)]], a new cable-free technology developed by French company [[Alstom]] and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with [[Limited-access road|limited access]] for cars.

=== Taxi ===
There are more than 400 [[taxicab]]s in Bordeaux.

== Sport ==
[[File:Bordeaux Stade Lescure entrée.JPG|thumb|Entrance to the Stade Chaban-Delmas]]
The 35,000-capacity [[Stade Chaban-Delmas]] is the largest stadium in Bordeaux. It was a venue for the [[FIFA World Cup]] in 1938 and 1998, as well as the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]]. In the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the [[Battle of Bordeaux (football)|Battle of Bordeaux]]. The ground was formerly known as the ''Stade du Parc Lescure'' until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]].

There are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, both playing at the Stade Chaban-Delmas. [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Girondins de Bordeaux]] is the [[association football|football]] team, currently playing in [[Ligue 1]] in the [[Football in France|French football]] championship. [[Union Bordeaux Bègles]] is a [[rugby union|rugby]] team in the [[Top 14]] in the [[National Rugby League (France)|Ligue Nationale de Rugby]].
Skateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a beautiful quai which runs along the Gironde river. On the Quai there is a skatepark divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skatepark is very well maintained by the municipal workers.

A [[New Bordeaux stadium|new stadium]] has been open in 2015 to replace the Chaban-Delmas stadium. It has a capacity of 42500 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nouveau-stade-bordeaux.com/|title=Le Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux : la plus grande scène de l'Atlantique – Matmut Atlantique|work=nouveau-stade-bordeaux.com}}</ref>

Bordeaux is also the home of one of the strongest [[cricket]] teams in France and are the current champions of the South West League.

There is a {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} wooden [[velodrome]], Vélodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of [[UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics|UCI Track Cycling World Cup]] events.
