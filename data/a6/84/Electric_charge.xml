There are two types of electric charges:<space/><link><target>proton</target><part>positive</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>electron</target><part>negative</part></link>. Positively charged substances are repelled from other positively charged substances, but attracted to negatively charged substances; negatively charged substances are repelled from negative and attracted to positive. An object is negatively charged if it has an excess of<space/><link><target>electron</target><trail>s</trail></link>, and is otherwise positively charged or uncharged. The<space/><link><target>Systeme International</target><part>SI</part></link><space/>derived unit of electric charge is the<space/><link><target>coulomb</target></link><space/>(C), although in electrical engineering it is also common to use the<space/><link><target>ampere-hour</target></link><space/>(Ah), and in<space/><link><target>chemistry</target></link><space/>it is common to use the<space/><link><target>elementary charge</target></link><space/>(<italics>e</italics>) as a unit.

Thus macroscopic objects tend toward being neutral overall, but macroscopic objects are rarely perfectly net neutral.</paragraph><paragraph>Sometimes macroscopic objects contain ions distributed throughout the material, rigidly bound in place, giving an overall net positive or negative charge to the object. Also, macroscopic objects made of conductive elements, can more or less easily (depending on the element) take on or give off electrons, and then maintain a net negative or positive charge indefinitely. When the net electric charge of an object is non-zero and motionless, the phenomenon is known as<space/><link><target>static electricity</target></link>. This can easily be produced by rubbing two dissimilar materials together, such as rubbing<space/><link><target>amber</target></link><space/>with<space/><link><target>fur</target></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>glass</target></link><space/>with<space/><link><target>silk</target></link>. In this way non-conductive materials can be charged to a significant degree, either positively or negatively. Charge taken from one material is moved to the other material, leaving an opposite charge of the same magnitude behind. The law of<space/><italics><link><target>conservation of charge</target></link></italics><space/>always applies, giving the object from which a negative charge has been taken a positive charge of the same magnitude, and vice versa.</paragraph><paragraph>Even when an object's net charge is zero, charge can be distributed non-uniformly in the object (e.g., due to an external<space/><link><target>electromagnetic field</target></link>, or bound polar molecules). In such cases the object is said to be<space/><link><target>Polarization density</target><part>polarized</part></link>. The charge due to polarization is known as<space/><link><target>bound charge</target></link>, while charge on an object produced by electrons gained or lost from outside the object is called<space/><italics>free charge</italics>. The motion of electrons in conductive<space/><link><target>metal</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>in a specific direction is known as<space/><link><target>electric current</target></link>.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Units</heading><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>International System of Units</target><part>SI</part></link><space/>unit of<space/><link><target>quantity of electricity</target><part>quantity of electric charge</part></link><space/>is the<space/><link><target>coulomb</target></link>, which is equivalent to about<space/><template><target>val</target><arg>6.242</arg><arg name="e">18</arg><arg name="u">''[[elementary charge|e]]''</arg></template><space/>(<italics>e</italics><space/>is the charge of a proton).

This was before the discovery of the particle by<space/><link><target>J. J. Thomson</target><part>J.J. Thomson</part></link><space/>in 1897. The unit is today treated as nameless, referred to as &quot;elementary charge&quot;, &quot;fundamental unit of charge&quot;, or simply as &quot;e&quot;.

Franklin imagined electricity as being a type of invisible fluid present in all matter; for example, he believed that it was the<space/><link><target>glass</target></link><space/>in a<space/><link><target>Leyden jar</target></link><space/>that held the accumulated charge. He posited that rubbing insulating surfaces together caused this fluid to change location, and that a flow of this fluid constitutes an electric current. He also posited that when matter contained too little of the fluid it was &quot;negatively&quot; charged, and when it had an excess it was &quot;positively&quot; charged. For a reason that was not recorded, he identified the term &quot;positive&quot; with vitreous electricity and &quot;negative&quot; with resinous electricity.<space/><link><target>William Watson (scientist)</target><part>William Watson</part></link><space/>arrived at the same explanation at about the same time.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Static electricity and electric current</heading><paragraph><link><target>Static electricity</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>electric current</target></link><space/>are two separate phenomena.

An electrostatic discharge creates a change in the charge of each of the two objects.

All electrified bodies are found to be either vitreously or resinously electrified.</paragraph><paragraph>It is the established convention of the scientific community to define the vitreous electrification as positive, and the resinous electrification as negative. The exactly opposite properties of the two kinds of electrification justify our indicating them by opposite signs, but the application of the positive sign to one rather than to the other kind must be considered as a matter of arbitrary convention, just as it is a matter of convention in<space/><link><target>mathematical diagram</target></link><space/>to reckon positive distances towards the right hand.</paragraph><paragraph>No force, either of attraction or of repulsion, can be observed between an electrified body and a body not electrified.<extension extension_name='ref'><link><target>James Clerk Maxwell</target></link><space/><italics>A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism</italics>, pp. 32-33, Dover Publications Inc., 1954 ASIN: B000HFDK0K, 3rd ed. of 1891</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Actually, all bodies are electrified, but may appear not to be so by the relative similar charge of neighboring objects in the environment.

The attraction and repulsion forces are codified by<space/><link><target>Coulomb's Law</target></link><space/>(attraction falls off at the square of the distance, which has a corollary for acceleration in a gravitational field, suggesting that gravitation may be merely electrostatic phenomenon between relatively weak charges in terms of scale).
