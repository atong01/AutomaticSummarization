The '''Brezhnev Doctrine''' was a [[Soviet foreign policy]], first and most clearly outlined by [[S. Kovalev]] in a September 26, 1968, ''[[Pravda]]'' article, entitled ''Sovereignty and the International Obligations of Socialist Countries''. [[Leonid Brezhnev]] reiterated it in a speech at the Fifth Congress of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] on November 13, 1968, which stated: 
[[File:EasternBloc BasicMembersOnly.svg|thumb|upright|[[Eastern Bloc]]]]
:When forces that are hostile to socialism try to turn the development of some socialist country towards capitalism, it becomes not only a problem of the country concerned, but a common problem and concern of all socialist countries.

This doctrine was announced to retroactively justify the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in August 1968 that ended the [[Prague Spring]], along with earlier [[Soviet Armed Forces|Soviet military]] interventions, such as the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|invasion of Hungary in 1956]]. These interventions were meant to put an end to liberalization efforts and uprisings that had the potential to compromise Soviet [[hegemony]] inside the [[Eastern Bloc]], which was considered by the Soviets to be an essential defensive and strategic buffer in case hostilities with [[NATO]] were to break out.   

In practice, the policy meant that only limited independence of the [[satellite state]]s' communist parties was allowed and that no country would be allowed to compromise the cohesiveness of the Eastern Bloc in any way.  That is, no country could leave the [[Warsaw Pact]] or disturb a ruling [[communist party]]'s monopoly on power. Implicit in this doctrine was that the leadership of the [[Soviet Union]] reserved, for itself, the right to define "[[socialism]]" and "[[capitalism]]". Following the announcement of the Brezhnev Doctrine, numerous treaties were signed between the Soviet Union and its satellite states to reassert these points and to further ensure inter-state cooperation. The principles of the doctrine were so broad that the Soviets even used it to justify their military intervention in the non-Warsaw Pact nation of [[Soviet–Afghan War|Afghanistan in 1979]]. The Brezhnev Doctrine stayed in effect until it was finally ended with the [[Soviet reaction to the Polish crisis of 1980–81]],<ref>Wilfried Loth.
