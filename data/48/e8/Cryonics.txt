'''Cryonics''' (from Greek κρύος 'kryos-' meaning 'cold') is the [[cryopreservation|low-temperature preservation]] of animals and humans who cannot be sustained by contemporary medicine, with the hope that healing and [[wikt:resuscitate|resuscitation]] may be possible in the future.<ref>

==Premises==
A central [[premise]] of cryonics is that [[long-term memory]], personality, and [[Personal identity|identity]] are stored in durable [[Cell (biology)|cell]] structures and patterns within the [[Human brain|brain]] that do not require continuous brain activity to survive.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mayford M, Siegelbaum SA, and Kandel ER | title=Synapses and Memory Storage | url = http://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/4/6/a005751.full.pdf | quote = Procedural and declarative memories differ dramatically.
They use a different logic (unconscious vs. conscious recall) and they are stored in different
areas of the brain. Nevertheless, these two disparate memory processes share several molecular
steps and an overall molecular logic. Both are created in at least two stages: one that does not
require the synthesis of new proteins and one that does. In both, short-term memory involves covalent
modification of preexisting proteins and changes in the strength of preexisting synaptic
connections, whereas long-term memory requires the synthesis of new proteins and the
growth of new connections. Moreover, both forms of memory use PKA, mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK), CREB-1, and CREB-2 signaling pathways to convert short-term to long-term
memory. Finally, both forms appear to use morphological changes at synapses to stabilize
long-term memory | journal=Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol |date=April 10, 2012 |doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a005751}}</ref> This premise is generally accepted in medicine; it is known that under certain conditions the brain can stop functioning and still later recover with retention of long-term memory.<ref>{{cite book

==Obstacles to success==

=== Preservation injury ===
Long-term cryopreservation can be achieved by cooling to near 77.15 [[Kelvin]] (approximately -196.01[[degree Celsius|°C]]), the [[boiling point]] of [[liquid nitrogen]]. It is a common mistaken belief that cells will lyse (burst) due to the formation of ice crystals within the cell, since this only occurs if the freezing rate exceeds the osmotic loss of water to the extracellular space.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mazur P |title=Freezing of living cells: mechanisms and implications |journal=The American Journal of Physiology |volume=247 |issue=3 Pt 1 |pages=C125–42 |date=September 1984 |pmid=6383068 |url=http://ajpcell.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=reprint&pmid=6383068}}</ref> However, damage from freezing can still be serious; ice may still form between cells, causing mechanical and chemical damage. Cryonics organizations use [[cryoprotectant]]s to reduce this damage. Cryoprotectant solutions are circulated through blood vessels to remove and replace water inside cells with chemicals that prevent freezing. This can reduce damage greatly,<ref>{{cite book| url = http://www.alcor.org/Library/html/braincryopreservation1.html| accessdate = 2006-03-17| title = New Brain Study Shows Reduced Tissue Damage| last = Platt| first = Charles| publisher = CryoCare Foundation| year = 1995| work = CryoCare Report| edition = 4}}</ref> but freezing of the entire body still causes injuries that are not reversible with present technology. The difficulties of recovering complex organisms from a frozen state have been long known.  Attempts to recover large frozen mammals by simply rewarming were abandoned by 1957.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Smith Audrey U | year = 1957 | title = Problems in the Resuscitation of Mammals from Body Temperatures Below 0 degrees C | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

When used at high concentrations, cryoprotectants stop ice formation completely. Cooling and solidification without crystal formation is called [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|vitrification]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fahy GM, MacFarlane DR, Angell CA, Meryman HT |title=Vitrification as an approach to cryopreservation |journal=Cryobiology |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=407–26 |date=August 1984 |pmid=6467964 |doi=10.1016/0011-2240(84)90079-8}}</ref> The first cryoprotectant solutions able to vitrify at very slow cooling rates while still being compatible with tissue survival were developed in the late 1990s by [[Cryobiology|cryobiologists]] [[Greg Fahy|Gregory Fahy]] and [[Brian Wowk]] for the purpose of banking transplantable organs.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fahy GM, Wowk B, Wu J |title=Cryopreservation of organs by vitrification: perspectives and recent advances |journal=Cryobiology |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=157–78 |date=April 2004 |pmid=15094092 |doi=10.1016/j.cryobiol.2004.02.002|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cryobiol.2005.03.002 |title=Corrigendum to "Cryopreservation of organs by vitrification: perspectives and recent advances" [Cryobiology 48 (2004) 157–178] |year=2005 |last1=Fahy |first1=G |last2=Wowk |first2=B |last3=Wu |first3=J |last4=Phan |first4=J |last5=Rasch |first5=C |last6=Chang |first6=A |last7=Zendejas |first7=E |journal=Cryobiology |volume=50 |page=344 |issue=3}}</ref> These solutions were adopted for use in cryonics by the [[Alcor Life Extension Foundation]], for which they are believed to permit [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|vitrification]] of some parts of the human body, especially the brain.<ref>{{cite web | title = New Cryopreservation Technology | publisher = Alcor Life Extension Foundation | date=October 2005 | url = http://www.alcor.org/Library/html/newtechnology.html | accessdate = 2007-04-29}}</ref> This has allowed animal brains to be vitrified, warmed back up, and examined for ice damage using light and [[Electron microscope|electron microscopy]].

Vitrification in cryonics is different from vitrification in mainstream cryobiology because vitrification in cryonics is not reversible with current technology. It is only structural vitrification. When successful, it can prevent freezing injury in some body parts, but at the price of toxicity caused by cryoprotectant chemicals. The nature of this toxicity is still poorly understood. Cryonicists assume that toxicity is more subtle and repairable than obvious structural damage that would otherwise be caused by freezing. If, for example, toxicity is due to [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] [[protein]]s, those proteins could be repaired or replaced.

=== Ischemic injury ===
[[Ischemia]] means inadequate or absent blood circulation that deprives tissue of oxygen and nutrients. At least several minutes of ischemia is a typical part of cryonics because of the common legal requirement that cryonics procedures do not begin until after blood circulation stops. The heart must stop beating so that [[legal death]] can be declared. When there is advance notice of impending [[legal death]], it is sometimes possible to deploy a team of technicians to perform a “standby procedure”. The team artificially restores blood circulation and breathing using techniques similar to [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] as soon as possible after the heart stops.<ref>{{cite web

Often in cryonics the brain is without oxygen for many minutes at warm temperatures, or even hours if the heart stops unexpectedly. This causes ischemic injury to the brain and other tissues that makes resuscitation impossible by present medical technology. Cryonicists justify preservation under such conditions by noting recent advances that allow brain resuscitation after longer periods of ischemia than the traditional 4-to-6-minute limit, and persistence of brain structure and even some brain cell function after long periods of [[clinical death]].<ref name = "Donaldson-1976">{{cite book

===Revival===
Those who believe that revival may someday be possible generally look toward advanced [[bioengineering]], [[molecular nanotechnology]],<ref>Nanofactory Collaboration http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory</ref> or [[nanomedicine]]<ref>Robert A. Freitas Jr., Nanomedicine, Landes Bioscience; Vol I (1999), Vol IIA (2003) [http://www.nanomedicine.com Nanomedicine.com]</ref> as key technologies. Revival would require repairing damage from lack of oxygen, cryoprotectant toxicity, thermal stress (fracturing), freezing in tissues that do not successfully vitrify, and reversing the effects that caused the patient's death. In many cases extensive [[Regeneration (biology)|tissue regeneration]] would be necessary. Hypothetical revival scenarios generally envision repairs being performed by vast numbers of microscopic organisms or devices.<ref>{{cite book

[[Mind uploading]] is another possibility that is frequently discussed. Transferring the information content of a cryopreserved brain into an artificial brain may be no more or less feasible than re-growing a biological body, especially to a society with technology capable of reviving cryopreserved brain tissue.

It has sometimes been written that cryonics revival will be a [[LIFO (computing)|last in, first out]] process. People cryopreserved in the future, with better technology, may require less advanced technology to be revived because they will have been cryopreserved with better technology that caused less damage to tissue. In this view, preservation methods would get progressively better until eventually they are demonstrably reversible, after which medicine would begin to reach back and revive people cryopreserved by more primitive methods. Revival of people cryopreserved by early cryonics technology may require centuries, if it is possible at all.<ref name = "Donaldson-1976"/> The "last in, first out" view of cryonics has been criticized because the quality of cryopreservation depends on many factors other than the era in which cryopreservation takes place.<ref>{{cite web

Survival would then depend on whether preserved brain information was sufficient to permit restoration of all or part of the personal identity of the original person, with [[amnesia]] being the final dividing line between success and failure.

==Neuropreservation==
[[Neuropreservation]] is cryopreservation of the brain, often within the head, with surgical removal and disposal (usually cremation) of the rest of the body. Neuropreservation, sometimes called “neuro,” is one of two distinct preservation options in cryonics, the other being "whole body" preservation.

Neuropreservation is motivated by the [[Human brain|brain]]'s role as the primary repository of memory and personal identity. (For instance, spinal cord injury victims, organ transplant patients, and amputees retain their personal identity.) It is also motivated by the belief that reversing any type of cryonic preservation is so difficult and complex that any future technology capable of it must by its nature be capable of generalized [[regeneration (biology)|tissue regeneration]], including growth of a new body around a repaired brain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alcor.org/Library/html/caseforneuropreservation.html |title=The Case for Neuropreservation |publisher=Alcor.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web

| title = The Neuropreservation Option: Head First into the Future}}</ref>  Some suggested revival scenarios for whole body patients even involve discarding the original body and regenerating a new body because tissues are so badly damaged by the preservation process. These considerations, along with lower costs, easier transportation in emergencies, and the specific focus on brain preservation quality, have motivated many cryonicists to choose neuropreservation.

The advantages and disadvantages of neuropreservation are often debated among cryonics advocates. Critics of neuropreservation note that the body is a record of much life experience. While few cryonicists doubt that a revived neuro patient would be the same person, there are wider questions about how a regenerated body might feel different from the original.<ref>{{cite book

| accessdate = 2006-03-16}}</ref> Partly for these reasons (as well as for better public relations), the [[Cryonics Institute]] preserves only whole bodies. Some proponents of neuropreservation agree with these concerns, but still feel that lower costs and better brain preservation justify concentrating preservation efforts on the brain. About two-thirds of the patients stored at Alcor are neuropreservation patients. Although the [[American Cryonics Society]] no longer offers the neuropreservation option, about half of their patients are "neuros".

==Legal issues==
Legally, cryonics patients are treated as [[deceased]] persons.<ref>[http://www.evidencebasedcryonics.org/2012/02/23/legal-protection-of-cryonics-patients-part-1/ Legal Protection of Cryonics Patients, Part 1], INSTITUTE FOR EVIDENCE BASED CRYONICS</ref><ref>[http://www.evidencebasedcryonics.org/2012/05/05/legal-protection-of-cryonics-patients-part-2/  Legal Protection of Cryonics Patients, Part 2], INSTITUTE FOR EVIDENCE BASED CRYONICS</ref><ref>[http://www.alcor.org/Library/html/legalstatus.html   The Legal Status of Cryonics Patients], Alcor Life Extension Foundation</ref><ref>[http://www.cryonics.org/documents/CS_Agreement.html CRYONIC SUSPENSION AGREEMENT], Cryonics Institute</ref><ref>[http://www.alcor.org/Library/pdfs/signup-CryopreservationAgreement.pdf Cryopreservation Agreement], Alcor Life Extension Foundation</ref> A long established legal tradition, the concept of "lost persons," permits a person who has been declared legally dead to later be declared legally alive.  Cryonics providers tend to be treated as medical research institutes.
In France, cryonics is not considered a legal mode of body disposal;<ref>http://www.leparticulier.fr/jcms/c_101664/conseil-d-etat-du-06/01/2006-n-260307-cryogenisation-interdiction</ref> only burial, cremation, and formal donation to science are allowed. However, bodies may legally be shipped to other, less restrictive countries for cryonic freezing.<ref>{{cite news|last=Chrisafis|first=Angelique|title=Freezer failure ends couple's hopes of life after death|url=http://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/mar/17/france.internationalnews|accessdate=8 January 2014|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=16 March 2006}}</ref>

==Standby services and transportation==
Standby and transportation is a critical phase in a cryopreservation process.  Cryonics patients need a professional response team to stand ready for suspended animation, when the patients are declared legally dead.  Standby services include stabilization, cooling, and other procedures to ensure that the damage to the patient during transportation is minimal.  Some cryonics services providers may provide standby as well as transportation services to their client.<ref>[http://www.alcor.org/BecomeMember/standby.html COMPREHENSIVE MEMBER STANDBY], Alcor Life Extension Foundation</ref><ref>[http://www.cryonics.org/resources/shipping-cryonics-patients Shipping a Cryonics Patients], Cryonics Institute</ref>

==Ethical considerations==
Cryonics views [[legal death]] as a perhaps sometimes pragmatically useful but fundamentally flawed and usually incorrect diagnosis which has no theoretical or philosophical justification. "Legal death" is usually just another name for a set of symptoms that have proven resistant to treatment by contemporary medicine. If death is not an event that happens suddenly when the heart stops (and "legal death" is often pronounced) this raises philosophical questions about what exactly death is. In 2005 an ethics debate in the medical journal, Critical Care, noted “…few if any patients pronounced dead by today’s physicians are in fact truly dead by any scientifically rigorous criteria.”<ref>{{cite book

Ethical and [[theological]] opinions of cryonics tend to pivot on the issue of whether cryonics is regarded as [[interment]] or medicine. If cryonics is interment, then religious beliefs about death and [[afterlife]] may come into consideration. Resuscitation may be deemed impossible by those with religious beliefs because the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] is gone, and according to most religions only a deity can resurrect the dead. Cryonics advocates say theological dismissal of cryonics because it is interment is a [[circular argument]] because calling cryonics "interment" presumes ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' that cryonics cannot work.<ref>{{cite web

authored a paper entitled “Cryonic-Hibernation in Light of the Bioethical Principles of Beauchamp and Childress.” Tandy considered the four bioethical factors or principles articulated by philosophers Beauchamp and Childress as they apply to cryonics. These four principles are 1) respect for autonomy; 2) nonmaleficence; 3) beneficence; and 4) justice. Tandy concluded that in respect to all four principles “biomedical professionals have a strong (not weak) and actual (not prima facie, but binding) obligation to help insure cryonic-hibernation of the cryonics patient.”<ref>

==History==

===20th century===
In 1922 Alexander Yaroslavsky, member of Russian immortalists-biocosmists movement, wrote "Anabiosys Poem". 
However, the modern era of cryonics began in 1962 when Michigan college physics teacher [[Robert Ettinger]] proposed in a privately published book, ''The Prospect of Immortality'',<ref>{{cite book | first= Robert C.W. | last= Ettinger|  year= 1964 | title= The Prospect of Immortality| edition= First | publisher= Doubleday|url = http://www.cryonics.org/book1.html | isbn= 0-9743472-3-X}}</ref> that freezing people may be a way to reach future medical technology. (The book was republished in 2005 and remains in print.) Even though freezing a person is apparently fatal, Ettinger argued that what appears to be fatal today may be reversible in the future. He applied the same argument to the process of dying itself, saying that the early stages of [[clinical death]] may be reversible in the future. Combining these two ideas, he suggested that freezing recently deceased people may be a way to save lives. In 1955 [[James Lovelock]] was able to reanimate rats frozen at 0 Celsius using microwave diathermy.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1365902/ |pages=541–546 |journal=The Journal of Physiology |date=June 28, 1955 |first1=R.K. |last1=Andjus |first2=J.E |last2=Lovelock |volume=128 |issue=3 |title=Reanimation of rats from body temperatures between 0 and 1C by microwave diathermy |PMC=1365902 |pmid=13243347}}</ref>

Slightly before Ettinger’s book was complete, Evan Cooper<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.cryonet.org/cgi-bin/dsp.cgi?msg=23124
| title = Ev Cooper
| publisher = cryonet.org
| accessdate = 2006-03-17}}</ref> (writing as Nathan Duhring) privately published a book called ''Immortality: Physically, Scientifically, Now'' that independently suggested the same idea. Cooper founded the Life Extension Society (LES) in 1964 to promote freezing people. Ettinger came to be credited as the originator of cryonics, perhaps because his book was republished by Doubleday in 1964 on recommendation of [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Fred Pohl]], and received more publicity. Ettinger also stayed with the movement longer. Nevertheless, Alcor's in-house historian, R. Michael Perry, has written “Evan Cooper deserves the principal credit for forming an organized cryonics movement.”<ref>{{cite web

Cooper’s [[Life Extension Society]] became the seed tree for cryonics societies throughout the United States where local cryonics advocates would get together as a result of contact through the LES mailing list. The actual word “cryonics” was invented by Karl Werner, then a student in the studio of William Katavolos at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, NY, in 1965 in conjunction with the founding of the Cryonics Society of New York (CSNY)<ref name="perry history">{{cite web

This was followed by the founding of the Cryonics Society of Michigan (CSM) and Cryonics Society of California (CSC) in 1966, and Bay Area Cryonics Society (BACS) in 1969 (renamed the [[American Cryonics Society]], or ACS, in 1985). Neither CSNY nor CSC are currently in operation. CSM eventually became the Immortalist Society, a non-profit affiliate of the [[Cryonics Institute]] (CI), a cryonics service organization founded by Ettinger in 1976. Alcor now has more current cryonics patients than any other organization, 139 as of July 31, 2015.<ref>

Although there was at least one earlier aborted case, it is generally accepted that the first person frozen with intent of future resuscitation was [[James Bedford]], a 73-year-old psychology professor frozen under crude conditions by CSC on January 12, 1967. The case made the cover of a limited print run of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine before the presses were stopped to report the death of three astronauts in the [[Apollo 1]] fire instead. Bedford is still frozen today at Alcor.<ref name="perry history"/>

The oldest cryonics society still in existence is the [[American Cryonics Society]] (ACS). This [[Tax exemption|tax-exempt]] [[501(c)(3)]] membership organization was incorporated in 1969 as the Bay Area Cryonics Society (BACS) by a group of cryonics advocates that included two prominent Bay Area physicians, M. Coleman Harris and Grace Talbot. The first suspensions under BACS auspices were performed in 1974 by Trans Time, Inc., a for-profit company started by BACS members. BACS researcher Paul Segall, working with Jerry Leaf of CryoVita, developed a medical model to induce hypothermia shortly after pronouncement of death. Segall later went on to pioneer blood substitutes for use in both cryonic suspension and in mainstream medicine.

In 1972 the Alcor Society for Solid State Hypothermia ([[Alcor Life Extension Foundation|ALCOR]]) was established by [[Fred and Linda Chamberlain]] as a nonprofit cryonics organization.<ref name="irs letter">{{cite web

| work = IRS
| year = 1972
| publisher = Alcor Life Extension Foundation
| accessdate = 2009-08-23
| title = Alcor IRS letter}}</ref> In 1977, the name was changed to the Alcor Life Extension Foundation. In 1982, the Institute for Advanced Biological Studies (IABS), founded by [[Mike Darwin]] and Steve Bridge in Indiana, merged with Alcor. During the 1980s, Darwin worked with [[UCLA]] cardiothoracic surgery researcher [[Jerry Leaf]] at Alcor to develop a medical model for cryonics procedures. They pioneered the first consistent use of a cryonics procedure now known as a “standby”, in which a team waits to begin life support procedures at the bedside of a cryonics patient as soon as possible after the heart stops.

Cryonics suffered a major setback in 1979 when it was discovered that nine bodies stored by the head of the CSC, Robert Nelson, in a cemetery in [[Chatsworth, California]], had thawed due to depletion of funds by relatives, after being maintained for a year and a half at the personal expense of Nelson.<ref name="perry history"/><ref>[http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=354 "Mistakes Were Made"], ''[[This American Life]]'', 18 April 2008.</ref> Some of the bodies had apparently thawed years earlier without notification. Nelson was sued, and negative publicity slowed cryonics growth for years afterward. Of 17 documented cryonics cases between 1967 and 1973, only James Bedford remains [[cryopreservation|cryopreserved]] today. Strict financial controls and requirements adopted in response to the Chatsworth scandal have resulted in the successful maintenance of almost all cryonics cases since that era.

Cryonics received new support in the 1980s when MIT engineer [[Eric Drexler]] started publishing papers and books foreseeing the new field of [[molecular nanotechnology]]. His 1986 book, ''[[Engines of Creation]]'', included an entire chapter on cryonics applications.<ref name="Note7">{{cite book

On July 24, 1988, a Ph.D. in [[computer science]] named Kevin Brown started an [[electronic mailing list]] called ''CryoNet''<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.cryonet.org/
| title = CryoNet
| accessdate = 2006-03-17}}</ref> that became a powerful tool of communication for the cryonics community.

There have been numerous, often transient, for-profit companies involved in cryonics. For-profit companies were often paired or affiliated with non-profit groups they served. Some of these companies, with non-profits they served in parentheses, were Cryonic Interment, Inc. (CSC), Cryo-Span Corporation (CSNY), Cryo-Care Equipment Corporation (CSC and CSNY), Manrise Corporation (Alcor), CryoVita, Inc. (Alcor), BioTransport, Inc. (Alcor), Trans Time, Inc.<ref>{{cite web

The cryonics field seems to have largely consolidated around three non-profit groups, Alcor Life Extension Foundation, Cryonics Institute (CI), and the American Cryonics Society (ACS), all deriving significant income from bequests and donations. In 2006, a non-profit called the Cryonics Society was formally incorporated but the group is devoted solely to promotion and public education of the cryonics concept.

===21st century===
As research in the 1990s revealed in greater detail the damaging effects of freezing, there was a trend to use higher concentrations of glycerol [[cryoprotectant]] to prevent freezing injury. In 2001 Alcor began using [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|vitrification]], a technology borrowed from mainstream organ preservation research, in an attempt to completely prevent ice formation during cooling. Initially the technology could only be applied to the head when separated from the body. In 2005 Alcor began treating the whole body with their vitrification solution in a procedure called "neurovitrification with whole body cryoprotection".<ref>{{cite web

== In popular culture ==
[[Suspended animation in fiction]] is a popular theme in science fiction and fantasy settings, appearing in literature, comic books, films, and television. A survey in Germany found that about half of the respondents were familiar with cryonics, and about half of those familiar with cryonics had learned of the subject from television or film.<ref name="pmid24499638">{{cite journal | author=Kaiser S1, Gross D1, Lohmeier J1, Rosentreter M1, Raschke J2 | title=Attitudes and acceptance toward the technology of cryonics in Germany | journal=INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT IN HEALTH CARE | volume=5 | year=2014 | pages=1–7 | doi = 10.1017/S0266462313000718 | id= | pmid=24499638 | issue=1}}</ref>

The best known cryopreserved patient is baseball player [[Ted Williams]]. The [[urban legend]] suggesting [[Walt Disney]] was cryopreserved is false; he was cremated and interred at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/disney/info/wd-ice.htm|title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Disney (Suspended Animation)|work=snopes.com}}</ref><ref name="mentalfloss">{{cite web|title=The Truth About Walt Disney and Cryogenics|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/54196/disney-ice-truth-about-walt-disney-and-cryogenics/|work=mentalfloss.com}}</ref> [[Robert A. Heinlein]], who wrote enthusiastically of the concept in ''[[The Door into Summer]]'', was cremated and had his ashes distributed over the Pacific Ocean. [[Timothy Leary]] was a long-time cryonics advocate, and signed up with a major cryonics provider. He changed his mind, however, shortly before his death, and so was not cryopreserved.
