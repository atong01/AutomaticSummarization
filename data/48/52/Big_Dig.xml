The old elevated Central Artery crossing is to the right.</part></link>Another important motivation for the final form of the Big Dig was the abandonment of the Massachusetts Department of Public Works' intended expressway system through and around Boston. The Central Artery, as part of Mass. DPW's Master Plan of 1948, was originally planned to be the downtown Boston stretch of<space/><link><target>Interstate 95 in Massachusetts</target><part>Interstate 95</part></link>, and was signed as such; a bypass road called the Inner Belt, was subsequently renamed<space/><link><target>Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)</target><part>Interstate 695</part></link>. (The law establishing the<space/><link><target>Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956</target><part>Interstate highway system</part></link><space/>was enacted in 1956.) The<space/><link><target>Inner Belt District</target></link><space/>was to pass to the west of the downtown core, through the neighborhood of<space/><link><target>Roxbury, Boston</target><part>Roxbury</part></link><space/>and the cities of<space/><link><target>Brookline, Massachusetts</target><part>Brookline</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Cambridge, Massachusetts</target><part>Cambridge</part></link>, and<space/><link><target>Somerville, Massachusetts</target><part>Somerville</part></link>. Earlier controversies over impact of the Boston extension of the<space/><link><target>Massachusetts Turnpike</target></link>, particularly on the heavily populated neighborhood of<space/><link><target>Brighton, Boston</target><part>Brighton</part></link>, and the additional large amount of housing that would have had to be destroyed led to<space/><link><target>freeway and expressway revolts</target><part>massive community opposition</part></link><space/>to both the Inner Belt and the Boston section of I-95.</paragraph><paragraph>Building demolition and land clearances for I-95 through the neighborhoods of Roxbury,<space/><link><target>Jamaica Plain</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Roslindale</target></link><space/>led to secession threats by<space/><link><target>Hyde Park, Boston</target><part>Hyde Park</part></link>, Boston's youngest and southernmost neighborhood. By 1972, with only a minimum of work done on the I-95 right of way and none on the potentially massively disruptive Inner Belt, Governor<space/><link><target>Francis Sargent</target></link><space/>put a moratorium on highway construction within the<space/><link><target>Massachusetts Route 128</target><part>MA-128</part></link><space/>corridor, except for a short stretch of Interstate 93. In 1974, the remainder of the Master Plan was canceled, leaving Boston with a severely overstressed expressway system for the existing traffic.</paragraph><paragraph>With ever-increasing traffic volumes funneled onto I-93 alone, the Central Artery became chronically gridlocked. The Sargent moratorium led to the rerouting of I-95 away from Boston around the MA-128 beltway and the conversion of the cleared land in the southern part of the city into the<space/><link><target>Southwest Corridor Park</target><part>Southwest Corridor linear park</part></link>, as well as a new right-of-way for the<space/><link><target>Orange Line (MBTA)</target><part>Orange Line</part></link><space/>subway and<space/><link><target>Amtrak</target></link>. Parts of the planned I-695 right-of-way remain unused and under consideration for future mass-transit projects.</paragraph><paragraph>The original 1948 Master Plan included a Third Harbor Tunnel plan that was hugely controversial in its own right, because it would have disrupted the<space/><link><target>Maverick Square</target></link><space/>area of<space/><link><target>East Boston</target></link>. It was never built.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Mixing of traffic</heading><paragraph>A major reason for the all-day congestion was that the Central Artery carried not only northsouth traffic, but much eastwest traffic as well. Boston's Logan Airport lies across<space/><link><target>Boston Harbor</target></link><space/>in East Boston, and before the Big Dig the only access from downtown was through the paired<space/><link><target>Callahan Tunnel</target><part>Callahan</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Sumner Tunnel</target><part>Sumner</part></link><space/>tunnels. Traffic on the major highways from west of Bostonthe Massachusetts Turnpike and<space/><link><target>Storrow Drive</target></link>mostly traveled on portions of the Central Artery to reach these tunnels. Getting between the Central Artery and the tunnels involved short diversions onto city streets, increasing local congestion.</paragraph><paragraph>The final Big Dig plan, then, combined several projectsthe depression and improvement of the Central Artery, the construction of a third Harbor tunnel (now known as the<space/><link><target>Ted Williams Tunnel</target></link>), and massive interchange improvements to the Massachusetts Turnpike and several other major routes in the area. While only one net lane in each direction was added to the northsouth I-93, several new eastwest lanes were added to untangle the traffic. Eastwest traffic on the Massachusetts Turnpike now proceeds directly through the Ted Williams Tunnel to Logan Airport and Route 1A beyond, with new exits in South Boston along the way. Traffic between Storrow Drive and the Callahan and Sumner Tunnels uses a short portion of I-93, but additional lanes and direct connections are provided for this traffic.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Mass transit</heading><paragraph>A number of<space/><link><target>public transportation</target></link><space/>projects were included as part of an<space/><link><target>environmental mitigation</target></link><space/>for the Big Dig. The most expensive was the building of the Phase II<space/><link><target>Silver Line (MBTA)</target><part>Silver Line</part></link><space/>tunnel under<space/><link><target>Fort Point Channel</target></link>, done in coordination with Big Dig construction.

To reach these tunnels, traffic on the major highways from west of Bostonthe<space/><link><target>Massachusetts Turnpike</target></link><space/>and Storrow Drivetraveled on portions of the Central Artery. Getting between the Central Artery and the tunnels also involved short stretches on city streets, increasing local congestion and causing backups on the highway.</paragraph><paragraph>The Big Dig untangled this co-mingled traffic. While only one net lane in each direction was added to the northsouth I-93, several new eastwest lanes became available. Eastwest traffic on the Massachusetts Turnpike/I-90 now proceeds directly through the Ted Williams Tunnel to Logan Airport and Route 1A beyond. Traffic between Storrow Drive and the Callahan and Sumner Tunnels still uses a short portion of I-93, but additional lanes and direct connections are provided for this traffic.</paragraph><paragraph>The result was a 62% reduction in vehicle hours of travel on I-93, the airport tunnels, and the connection from Storrow Drive, from an average 38,200 hours per day before construction (19941995) to 14,800 hours per day in 20042005, after the project was largely complete.<extension extension_name='ref' name="impactreport"><link type='external' href='http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf'></link><space/>Transportation Impacts of MTA and CAT project, February 2006, Table 3-6<space/><template><target>wayback</target><arg name="url">http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf<space/></arg><arg name="date">20130701231207<space/></arg></template></extension><space/>The savings for travelers was estimated at $166 million annually in the same 20042005 time frame.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf'>Transportation Impacts of MTA and CAT project, February 2006, p. 24</link><space/><template><target>wayback</target><arg name="url">http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf<space/></arg><arg name="date">20130701231207<space/></arg></template></extension><space/>Travel times on the Central Artery northbound during the afternoon peak hour were reduced 85.6%.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf'>Transportation Impacts of MTA and CAT project, February 2006, Table 3-1</link><space/><template><target>wayback</target><arg name="url">http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf<space/></arg><arg name="date">20130701231207<space/></arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>A 2008<space/><italics>Boston Globe</italics><space/>report asserted that waiting time for the majority of trips actually increased as a result of<space/><link><target>induced demand</target><part>demand induced</part></link><space/>by the increased road capacity.
