The '''byte''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|aɪ|t}}) is a [[units of information|unit of digital information]] that most commonly consists of eight [[bit]]s. Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single [[character (computing)|character]] of text in a computer<ref name = Bemer1962>{{citation

The size of the byte has historically been hardware dependent and no definitive standards existed that mandated the size. The [[de facto standard|''de facto'' standard]] of eight bits is a convenient [[power of two]] permitting the values 0 through 255 for one byte.  The international standard [[IEC 80000-13]] codified this common meaning. Many types of applications use information representable in eight or fewer bits and processor designers optimize for this common usage. The popularity of major commercial computing architectures has aided in the ubiquitous acceptance of the 8-bit size.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/internet_history/#1964|title=Computer History Museum - Exhibits - Internet History - 1964|publisher = Computer History Museum}}</ref>

The unit ''[[Octet (computing)|octet]]'' was defined to explicitly denote a sequence of 8 bits because of the ambiguity associated at the time with the byte.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_BinaryInformationandRepresentationBitsBytesNibbles-3.htm|title=The TCP/IP Guide - Binary Information and Representation}}</ref> The usage of the term ''octad(e)'' for 8 bits is no longer common today.<ref name="Philips_1971">{{cite web|title=Philips - Philips Data Systems' product range - April 1971|publisher=Philips|date=1971|url=http://www.intact-reunies.nl/pdf/product1971.pdf|accessdate=2015-08-03}}</ref><ref name="Williams_1969">{{cite web|title=British Commercial Computer Digest: Pergamon Computer Data Series|first=R.

==History==
The term ''byte'' was coined by [[Werner Buchholz]] in July 1956, during the early design phase for the [[IBM 7030|IBM Stretch]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/IBM/Stretch/102636400.txt|title= Timeline of the IBM Stretch/Harvest era (1956–1961) | publisher = Computer History | date=July 1956|author=Werner Buchholz}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/B/byte.html|title=byte definition}}</ref> computer, which had addressing to the bit and variable field length (VFL) instructions with a byte size encoded in the instruction.
It is a deliberate respelling of ''bite'' to avoid accidental mutation to ''bit''.<ref name=Bemer1962/>

Early computers used a variety of four-bit [[binary coded decimal]] (BCD) representations and the [[Sixbit|six-bit]] codes for printable graphic patterns common in the [[U.S. Army]] ([[Fieldata]]) and Navy. These representations included alphanumeric characters and special graphical symbols. These sets were expanded in 1963 to seven bits of coding, called the [[ASCII|American Standard Code for Information Interchange]] (ASCII) as the [[Federal Information Processing Standard]], which replaced the incompatible teleprinter codes in use by different branches of the U.S. government and universities during the 1960s. ASCII included the distinction of upper- and lowercase alphabets and a set of [[control character]]s to facilitate the transmission of written language as well as printing device functions, such as page advance and line feed, and the physical or logical control of data flow over the transmission media. During the early 1960s, while also active in ASCII standardization, IBM simultaneously introduced in its product line of [[System/360]] the eight-bit [[Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code]] (EBCDIC), an expansion of their [[BCD (6-bit)|six-bit binary-coded decimal (BCDIC)]] representation used in earlier card punches.<ref name="ibmebcdic">{{cite web

The prominence of the System/360 led to the ubiquitous adoption of the eight-bit storage size, while in detail the EBCDIC and ASCII encoding schemes are different.

In the early 1960s, AT&T introduced [[digital telephony]] first on long-distance [[trunk line]]s.  These used the eight-bit [[µ-law algorithm|µ-law encoding]].  This large investment promised to reduce transmission costs for eight-bit data.

The development of [[eight-bit]] [[microprocessor]]s in the 1970s popularized this storage size. Microprocessors such as the [[Intel 8008]], the direct predecessor of  the [[Intel 8080|8080]] and the [[Intel 8086|8086]], used in early personal computers, could also perform a small number of operations on the [[4bit|four-bit]] pairs in a byte, such as the decimal-add-adjust (DAA) instruction. A four-bit quantity is often called a [[nibble]], also ''nybble'', which is conveniently represented by a single [[hexadecimal]] digit.

The term ''[[Octet (computing)|octet]]'' is used to unambiguously specify a size of eight bits. It is used extensively in [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] definitions.

Historically, the term ''octad'' or ''octade'' was used to denote 8 bits as well at least in Western Europe;<ref name="Williams_1969"/><ref name="Philips_1971"/> however, this usage is no longer common today. The exact origin of the term is unclear, but it can be found in British, Dutch and German sources of the 1960s and 1970s, and throughout the documentation of [[Philips]] mainframe computers.

==Unit symbol==
{{Bit and byte prefixes}}
The unit symbol for the byte is specified in IEC 80000-13, [[IEEE 1541]] and the Metric Interchange Format<ref>[http://people.csail.mit.edu/jaffer/MIXF Metric-Interchange-Format]</ref> as the upper-case character ''B''.

In the [[International System of Units]] (SI), ''B'' is the symbol of the [[Decibel|bel]], a unit of logarithmic power ratios named after [[Alexander Graham Bell]], creating a conflict with the IEC specification. It is also not consistent with the SI convention that only units named after persons should be capitalized. However, there is little danger of confusion because the bel is a rarely used unit. It is used primarily in its decadic fraction, the [[decibel]] (dB), for [[signal strength]] and [[sound pressure level]] measurements, while a unit for one tenth of a byte, the decibyte, can only be used in derived units, such as transmission rates.

The unit symbol kB is commonly used for [[kilobyte]], but may be confused with the still often-used abbreviation of kb for [[kilobit]]. IEEE 1541 specifies the lower case character b as the symbol for [[bit]]; however, IEC 80000-13 and Metric-Interchange-Format specify the symbol as ''bit'', e.g., Mbit (megabit), providing disambiguation from B for byte.

The lowercase letter o for [[Octet (computing)|octet]] is defined as the symbol for octet in IEC 80000-13 and is commonly used in languages such as [[French language|French]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iec.ch/si/binary.htm|title=When is a kilobyte a kibibyte? And an MB an MiB? | date= |work=The International System of Units and the IEC |publisher=[[International Electrotechnical Commission]] |accessdate=August 30, 2010}})</ref> and [[Romanian language|Romanian]], and is also combined with metric prefixes for multiples, for example ''ko'' and ''Mo''.

==Unit multiples==
[[File:Binaryvdecimal.svg|thumb|right|250px|Percentage difference between decimal and binary interpretations of the unit prefixes grows with increasing storage size]]

{{See also|Binary prefix}}
Considerable confusion exists about the meanings of the [[SI prefix|SI (or metric) prefixes]] used with the unit byte, especially concerning the prefixes ''kilo'' (k or K), ''mega'' (M), and ''giga'' (G). Computer memory is designed in a binary architecture, multiples are expressed in [[power of two|powers of 2]]. In some fields of the software and computer hardware industries the SI-prefixed quantities of byte and bits are used with a meaning of binary multiples of powers, while producers of computer storage devices prefer strict adherence to SI multiples. For example, a computer disk drive capacity of 100&nbsp;gigabytes is specified when the disk contains 93&nbsp;gibibytes of storage space.

While the numerical difference between the decimal and binary interpretations is relatively small for the prefixes [[Kilo-|kilo]] and [[Mega-|mega]], it grows to over 20% for prefix [[yotta]]. The linear-log graph at right illustrates the difference versus storage size up to an [[exa]]byte.

==Common uses==
Many [[programming language]]s defined the [[data type]] ''byte''.

The [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] programming languages define ''byte'' as an "''addressable unit of data storage large enough to hold any member of the basic character set of the execution environment''" (clause 3.6 of the C standard). The C standard requires that the integral data type ''char'' must hold at least 256 different values, and is represented by at least eight bits (clause 5.2.4.2.1).

In addition, the C and C++ standards require that there are no "gaps" between two bytes. This means every bit in memory is part of a byte.<ref>

Various implementations of C and C++ reserve 8, 9, 16, 32, or 36 bits for the storage of a byte.<ref>

The actual number of bits in a particular implementation is documented as ''CHAR_BIT'' as implemented in the file [[limits.h]].

[[Java (programming language)|Java's]] primitive <code>byte</code> data type is always defined as consisting of 8 bits and being a signed data type, holding values from −128 to 127.

.NET programming languages, such as C#, define both an unsigned ''byte'' and a signed ''sbyte'', holding values from 0 to 255, and -128 to 127, respectively.

In data transmission systems, the byte is defined as a contiguous sequence of bits in a serial data stream, representing is the smallest distinguished unit of data. A transmission unit might include start bits, stop bits, or [[parity bit]]s, and thus could vary from 7 to 12 bits to contain a single [[7-bit ASCII]] [[ASCII code|code]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
