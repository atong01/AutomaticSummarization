Bruce Wayne returns home to<space/><link><target>Gotham City</target></link><space/>at the age of twenty-five from training abroad in martial arts, manhunting, and science for the past 12 years, and James Gordon moves to Gotham with his wife, Barbara, after a transfer from<space/><link><target>Chicago</target></link>.

He is reluctantly drawn into a brawl with her violent pimp and is attacked by several prostitutes, including dominatrix<space/><link><target>Catwoman</target><part>Selina Kyle</part></link>. Two police officers shoot and take him in their squad car, but a dazed and bleeding Bruce breaks his handcuffs and causes a crash, dragging the police to a safe distance before fleeing. He reaches<space/><link><target>Wayne Manor</target></link><space/>barely alive and sits before his fathers bust, requesting guidance in his war on crime. A bat crashes through a window and settles on the bust, giving him the inspiration to become a bat.</paragraph><paragraph>Gordon soon works to rid corruption from the force, but, on orders from<space/><link><target>Gillian B. Loeb</target><part>Commissioner Gillian Loeb</part></link>, several officers attack him, including Flass, who personally threatens Gordons pregnant wife. In revenge, the recovering Gordon tracks Flass down, beats and humiliates him, leaving him naked and handcuffed in the snow.</paragraph><paragraph>As Gordon becomes a minor celebrity for several brave acts, Batman strikes for the first time, attacking a group of thieves. Batman soon works up the ladder, even attacking Flass while he was accepting a drug dealers bribe. After Batman interrupts a dinner party attended by many of Gothams corrupt politicians and crime bosses to announce his intention to bring them to justice, including<space/><link><target>Carmine Falcone</target><part>Carmine &quot;The Roman&quot; Falcone</part></link>, Loeb orders Gordon to bring him in by any means necessary.</paragraph><paragraph>As Gordon tries in vain to catch him, Batman attacks Falcone, stripping him naked and tying him up in his bed after dumping his car in the river, further infuriating the mob boss.

Essen holds Batman at gunpoint while Gordon is momentarily dazed, but Batman disarms her and flees to an abandoned building.</paragraph><paragraph>Claiming the building has been scheduled for demolition, Loeb orders a bomb dropped on it, forcing Batman into the fortified basement, abandoning his belt as the explosives inside catch fire. A trigger-happy<space/><link><target>SWAT</target></link><space/>team led by Branden is sent in, whom Batman attempts to trap in the basement. They soon escape and, after tranquillising Branden, Batman dodges as the rest open fire, barely managing to survive after two bullet wounds. Enraged as the teams carelessly fired bullets injure several people outside, Batman beats the team into submission and, after using a device to attract the bats of his cave to him, he flees amid the chaos. Selina Kyle, after witnessing him in action, dons a costume of her own to begin a life of crime.</paragraph><paragraph>Gordon has a brief affair with Essen, while Batman intimidates a mob drug dealer for information. The dealer comes to Gordon to testify against Flass, who is brought up on charges. Upset with Gordon's exploits, Loeb blackmails Gordon against pressing charges with proof of his affair. After bringing Barbara with him to interview Bruce Wayne, investigating his connection to Batman, Gordon confesses the affair to her.</paragraph><paragraph>Batman sneaks into Falcones manor, overhearing a plan against Gordon, but is interrupted when Selina Kyle, hoping to build a reputation after her robberies were pinned on Batman, attacks Falcone and his bodyguards, aided from afar by Batman. Identifying Falcones plan as the morning comes, the uncostumed Bruce leaves to help.</paragraph><paragraph>While leaving home, Gordon spots a motorcyclist enter his garage. Suspicious, Gordon enters to see Johnny Vitti, Falcones nephew, and his thugs holding his family hostage. Gordon decisively shoots the thugs and chases Vitti, who has fled with the baby. The mysterious motorcyclist, now revealed to the reader as Bruce Wayne, rushes out to chase Vitti. Gordon blows out Vitti's car tire on a bridge and the two fight hand-to-hand, with Gordon losing his glasses, before Vitti and James Gordon Junior fall over the side. Bruce leaps over the railing and saves the baby. Gordon realizes that he is standing before an unmasked Batman, but says that he is &quot;practically blind without [his] glasses,&quot; and lets Bruce go.</paragraph><paragraph>In the final scenes of the comic, Flass turns on Loeb, supplying Dent with evidence and testimony, and Loeb resigns.
