In a [[dynamical system]], '''bistability''' means the system has two [[stable equilibrium (disambiguation)|stable equilibrium states]].  Something that is '''bistable''' can be resting in either of two states. These rest states need not be symmetric with respect to [[Energy storage|stored energy]].  In terms of [[potential energy]], a bistable system has two [[local minimum|local minima]] of potential energy separated by a peak (local maximum).

In a [[conservative force]] field, bistability stems from the fact that the [[potential energy]] has three [[equilibrium point]]s. Two of them are [[minimum|minima]] and one is a [[maximum]].  By mathematical arguments, the maximum must lie between the two minima.  At rest, a particle will be in one of the minimum equilibrium positions, because that corresponds to the state of lowest energy. The maximum can be visualized as a barrier between them.

A system can transition from one state of minimal energy to the other if it is given enough activation energy to penetrate the barrier (compare [[activation energy]] and [[Arrhenius equation]] for the chemical case). After the barrier has been reached, the system will relax into the other minimum state in a time called the [[relaxation time]]. 

Bistability is widely used in [[digital electronics]] devices to store [[binary number|binary]] data. It is the essential characteristic of the [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]], a circuit widely used in latches and some types of [[semiconductor memory]].  A bistable device can store one [[binary digit|bit]] of binary data, with one state representing a "0" and the other state a "1".  It is also used in [[relaxation oscillator]]s, [[multivibrator]]s, and the [[Schmitt trigger]].
[[Optical bistability]] is an attribute of certain optical devices where two resonant transmissions states are possible and stable, dependent on the input.

==Mathematical modelling==

In the mathematical language of dynamic systems analysis, one of the simplest bistable systems is

<math>
\frac{dy}{dt} = y (1-y^2).
</math>

This system describes a ball rolling down a curve with shape <math>\frac{y^4}{4} - \frac{y^2}{2}</math>, and has three steady-states: <math> y = 1 </math>, <math> y = 0 </math>, and <math> y = -1</math>.  The middle steady-state <math>y=0</math> is unstable, while the other two states are stable.  The direction of change of <math>y(t)</math> over time depends on the initital condition <math>y(0)</math>.  If the initial condition is positive (<math>y(0)>0</math>), then the solution <math>y(t)</math> approaches 1 over time, but if the initial condition is negative (<math>y(0)< 0</math>), then <math>y(t)</math> approaches -1 over time. Thus, the dynamics are "bistable".

==In biological and chemical systems==
Bistability is key for understanding basic phenomena of cellular functioning, such as decision-making processes in [[cell cycle]] progression, [[cellular differentiation]],<ref name=Ghaffarizadeh>{{cite journal |author = Ghaffarizadeh A, Flann NS, Podgorski GJ |year = 2014 |title = Multistable switches and their role in cellular differentiation networks |journal = BMC Bioinformatics |volume = 15 |pages = S7+ |doi = 10.1186/1471-2105-15-s7-s7 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/S7/S7 |pmid = 25078021 |pmc = 4110729}}</ref> and [[apoptosis]]. It is also involved in loss of cellular homeostasis associated with early events in [[cancer]] onset and in [[prion]] diseases as well as in the origin of new species ([[speciation]]).<ref name=Wilhelm>{{cite journal |author = Wilhelm, T |year = 2009 |title = The smallest chemical reaction system with bistability |journal = BMC Systems Biology |volume = 3 |pages = 90 |doi = 10.1186/1752-0509-3-90 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/90 |pmid = 19737387 |pmc = 2749052}}</ref>

Bistability can be generated by a positive feedback loop with an ultrasensitive regulatory step.  Positive feedback loops, such as the simple X activates Y and Y activates X motif, essentially links output signals to their input signals and have been noted to be an important regulatory motif in cellular signal transduction because positive feedback loops can create switches with an all-or-nothing decision.<ref name="O. Brandman, J. E 2005">O. Brandman, J. E. Ferrell Jr., R. Li, T. Meyer, Science 310, 496 (2005)</ref>  Studies have shown that numerous biological systems, such as ''Xenopus'' oocyte maturation,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ferrell JE Jr., Machleder EM|title=The biochemical basis of an all-or-none cell fate switch in Xenopus oocytes.|journal=Science|date=1998|volume=280|issue=5365|pages=895–8|pmid=9572732|accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref> mammalian calcium signal transduction, and polarity in budding yeast, incorporate temporal (slow and fast) positive feedback loops, or more than one feedback loop that occurs at different times.<ref name="O. Brandman, J. E 2005"/> Having two different temporal positive feedback loops or “dual-time switches” allows for (a) increased regulation: two switches that have independent changeable activation and deactivation times; and (b) linked feedback loops on multiple timescales can filter noise.<ref name="O. Brandman, J. E 2005"/>

Bistability can be modified to be more robust and to tolerate significant changes in concentrations of reactants, while still maintaining its "switch-like" character.  Feedback on both the activator of a system and inhibitor make the system able to tolerate a wide range of concentrations.  An example of this in cell biology is that activated CDK1 (Cyclin Dependent Kinase 1) activates its activator Cdc25 while at the same time inactivating its inactivator, Wee1, thus allowing for progression of a cell into mitosis.  Without this double feedback, the system would still be bistable, but would not be able to tolerate such a wide range of concentrations.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ferrell JE Jr.|title=Feedback regulation of opposing enzymes generates robust, all-or-none bistable responses|journal=Current Biology|year=2008|volume=18|issue=6|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MiamiImageURL&_cid=272099&_user=10&_pii=S0960982208001814&_check=y&_origin=&_coverDate=25-Mar-2008&view=c&wchp=dGLzVlV-zSkzk&md5=68c1e4cd1871b9bbf09f2ade972e0d04/1-s2.0-S0960982208001814-main.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.02.035}}</ref>

A prime example of bistability in biological systems is that of [[Sonic hedgehog]] (Shh), a secreted signaling molecule, which plays a critical role in development. Shh functions in diverse processes in development, including patterning limb bud tissue differentiation. The Shh signaling network behaves as a bistable switch, allowing the cell to abruptly switch states at precise Shh concentrations. ''gli1'' and ''gli2'' transcription is activated by Shh, and their gene products act as transcriptional activators for their own expression and for targets downstream of Shh signaling.<ref>Lai, K., M.J. Robertson, and D.V. Schaffer, The sonic hedgehog signaling system as a bistable genetic switch. Biophys J, 2004. 86(5): p. 2748-57.</ref> Simultaneously, the Shh signaling network is controlled by a negative feedback loop wherein the Gli transcription factors activate the enhanced transcription of a repressor (Ptc). This signaling network illustrates the simultaneous positive and negative feedback loops whose exquisite sensitivity helps create a bistable switch.

Bistability can only arise in biological and chemical systems if three necessary conditions are fulfilled: positive [[feedback]], a mechanism to filter out small stimuli and a mechanism to prevent explosions.<ref name=Wilhelm/>

Bistable chemical systems have been studied extensively to analyze relaxation kinetics, [[non-equilibrium thermodynamics]], [[stochastic resonance]], as well as [[climate change]].<ref name=Wilhelm/> In bistable spatially extended systems the onset of local correlations and propagation of traveling waves have been analyzed.<ref name=Elf>{{cite journal |last1 = Elf |first1 = J. | last2 = Ehrenberg| first2 = M. |year = 2004 |title = Spontaneous separation of bi-stable biochemical systems into spatial domains of opposite phases |journal = Systems Biology (Stevenage) |volume = 1 |number = 2| pages = 230–236 |pmid = 17051695 | doi=10.1049/sb:20045021}}</ref><ref name=Kochanzyck>{{cite journal |last1 = Kochanczyk |first1 = M. |last2 = Jaruszewicz |first2 = J. |last3 = Lipniacki |first3 = T. |title = Stochastic transitions in a bistable reaction system on the membrane |journal = Journal of the Royal Society Interface |volume = 10 |number = 84 |pages = 20130151 |pmid = 23635492 |pmc = 3673150 |doi =  10.1098/rsif.2013.0151}}</ref>

Bistability is often accompanied by [[hysteresis]]. On a population level, if many realisations of a bistable system are considered (e.g. many bistable cells ([[speciation]])<ref name=Nielsen>{{cite journal |author = Nielsen |last2 = Dolganov |first2 = Nadia A. |last3 = Rasmussen |first3 = Thomas |last4 = Otto |first4 = Glen |last5 = Miller |first5 = Michael C. |last6 = Felt |first6 = Stephen A. |last7 = Torreilles |first7 = Stéphanie |last8 = Schoolnik |first8 = Gary K. |editor1-last = Isberg |year = 2010 |editor1-first = Ralph R. |title = A Bistable Switch and Anatomical Site Control Vibrio cholerae Virulence Gene Expression in the Intestine |journal = PLOS Pathogens |volume = 6 |issue = 9 |pages = 1 |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1001102
|url=http://www.plospathogens.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1001102 |pmid = 20862321 |pmc = 2940755|display-authors=etal}}</ref>), one typically observes [[bimodal distribution]]s.

== In mechanical systems ==
Bistability as applied in the design of mechanical systems is more commonly said to be "over centre"—that is, work is done on the system to move it just past the peak, at which point the mechanism goes "over centre" to its secondary stable position. The result is a toggle-type action- work applied to the system below a threshold sufficient to send it 'over center' results in no change to the mechanism's state.

[[spring (device)|Springs]] are a common method of achieving an "over centre" action. A spring attached to a simple two position ratchet-type mechanism can create a button or plunger that is clicked or toggled between two mechanical states. Many [[Ballpoint Pen|ballpoint]] and [[Rollerball Pen|rollerball]] retractable pens employ this type of bistable mechanism.

An even more common example of an over-center device is an ordinary electric wall switch.  These switches are often designed to snap firmly into the "on" or "off" position once the toggle handle has been moved a certain distance past the center-point.

A [[ratchet (device)|ratchet-and-pawl]] is an elaboration -- a multi-stable "over center" system used to create irreversible motion.  The pawl goes over center as it is turned in the forward direction. In this case, "over center" refers to the ratchet being stable and "locked" in a given position until clicked forward again; it has nothing to do with the ratchet being unable to turn in the reverse direction.
