'''Edith of England''' ({{lang-ang|Ēadgȳð}}) (910 – 26 January 946), also spelt '''Eadgyth''' or '''Ædgyth''', was the daughter of [[Edward the Elder]], and the wife of [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor]].

==Life==
Edith was born to the reigning English king [[Edward the Elder]] by his second wife, [[Ælfflæd, wife of Edward the Elder|Ælfflæd]], and hence was granddaughter of [[Alfred the Great]].  Nothing is known of her until in order to seal an alliance between two Saxon kingdoms, her half-brother, King [[Athelstan of England]], sent two of his sisters (Eadgyth and [[Eadgifu of Wessex]]) to Germany, instructing the Duke of Saxony (later [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor]]) to choose whichever one pleased him best. Otto chose Edith and married her in 930. The remaining sister Algiva or Adiva was married to a "king near the Jupiter mountains" (the [[Alps]]). The precise identity of the husband of this sister is debated.

In 936 [[Henry the Fowler|King Henry I]] of Germany died and his eldest son, Eadgyth's husband,  was crowned at [[Aachen]] as [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Otto I]].   There is a surviving report of the ceremony by [[Widukind of Corvey]] which makes no mention of his wife having been crowned at this point, but according to [[Thietmar of Merseburg]]'s chronicle Eadgyth was nevertheless [[Anointing|anointed]] as queen, albeit in a separate ceremony.   As queen, Eadgyth undertook the usual state duties of "First lady":  when she turns up in the records it is generally in connection with gifts to the state's [[List of Imperial abbeys|favoured monasteries]] or memorials to holy women and [[saints]].   In this respect she seems to have been more diligent than her now widowed and subsequently sainted mother-in-law [[Matilda of Ringelheim|Queen Matilda]] whose own charitable activities only achieve a single recorded mention from the period of Eadgyth's time as queen.   There was probably rivalry between the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] [[:de:Mauritiuskloster|Monastery of St Maurice]] founded at [[Magdeburg]] by Otto and Eadgyth in 937, a year after coming to the throne and Matilda's foundation at [[Quedlinburg Abbey]], intended by her as a memorial to her husband, the late [[Henry the Fowler|King Henry I]].

Eadgyth accompanied her husband on his travels, though not during battles.   She spent the hostilities of 939 at [[Lorsch Abbey]]

Like her brother, Athelstan, Edith was devoted to the cult of [[Oswald of Northumbria|Saint Oswald]] and was instrumental in introducing this cult into Germany after her marriage to the emperor.  Her lasting influence may have caused certain monasteries and churches in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] to be dedicated to this saint.<ref name="GuardianEadgyth20Jan10">{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/jan/20/alfred-great-granddaughter-remains-wessex|last=Kennedy|first=Maev|date=20 January 2010|title=Remains of Alfred the Great's granddaughter returned / Coming home: the Saxon queen lost for 1,000 years|pages=5|accessdate=20 January 2010 | location=London | work=The Guardian}}</ref>

Eadgyth's death at a relatively young age, in her early thirties, was unexpected.

==Children==
Edith and Otto's children were:
* [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia]] (930 – 6 September 957).
* [[Liutgarde]] (931 – 18 November 953), married [[Conrad the Red]].

==Tomb==
Her tomb is located in the [[Cathedral of Magdeburg]]. A lead coffin inside a stone sarcophagus with her name on it was found and opened in 2008 by archaeologists during work on the building. An inscription recorded that it was the body of Eadgyth, reburied in 1510. It was examined in 2009, then brought to [[Bristol]], England, for tests in 2010. Professor [[Mark Horton (archaeologist)|Mark Horton]] of [[University of Bristol|Bristol University]] said that "this may prove to be the oldest complete remains of an English royal." The investigations at Bristol, applying [[Technetium-99m|isotope]] tests on tooth enamel, checked whether she was born and brought up in [[Wessex]] and [[Mercia]], as written history has indicated.<ref name="GuardianEadgyth20Jan10" /><ref name="DiscoveryNewsSatter">{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20100123012854/http://news.discovery.com/archaeology/english-princess-bones.html|title=Discovery News|last=Satter|first=Raphael G.|date=20 January 2010|work=Bones of early English princess found in Germany|accessdate=21 January 2010}} Retrieved from Internet Archive 14 February 2014.</ref> Testing on the bones revealed that they are the remains of Eadgyth, from study made of the enamel of the teeth in her upper jaw.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20100617043529/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/england/bristol/10332975.stm German cathedral bones 'are Saxon queen Eadgyth, BBC News, 16 June 2010] Retrieved from Internet Archive 14 February 2014.</ref> Testing of the enamel revealed that the individual entombed at Magdeburg had spent time as a youth in the [[chalk]]y uplands of [[Wessex]].<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/jun/17/saxon-princess-remains-german-cathedral Remains of first king of England's sister found in German cathedral, The Guardian, 17 June 2010]</ref>

"Tests on these isotopes can give a precise record of where the person lived up to the age of 14," noted ''The Times'' of London in its story on the testing. "In this case they showed that the woman in the casket had spent the first years of her life drinking water that came from springs on the [[chalk]] hills of southern England. This matched exactly the historical records of Eadgyth’s early life."<ref>''The Times'', Simon de Bruxelles, 17 June 2010</ref>

The bones "are the oldest surviving remains of an English royal burial," Bristol University announced in a press release.<ref>[http://bristol.ac.uk/news/2010/7073.html Bones confirmed as those of Saxon Princess Eadgyth, University of Bristol, 17 June 2010]</ref>

Following the tests the bones were re-interred in Magdeburg Cathedral on 22 October 2010.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/0,1518,724628,00.html Königin Editha im Magdeburger Dom bestattet] in: [[Spiegel Online]] vom 22. Oktober 2010</ref>
