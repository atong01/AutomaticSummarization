{{Politics of Estonia}}
The Republic of Estonia gained its independence from the [[Russian Empire]] on 24 February 1918 and established diplomatic relations with many countries via membership of the [[League of Nations]]. The forcible incorporation of Estonia into the Soviet Union in 1940 was not generally recognised by the international community and the [[Estonian diplomatic service]] continued to operate in some countries. Following the restoration of independence from the [[Soviet Union]], [[Russia]] was one of the first nations to re-recognize [[Estonia]]'s independence (the first country to do so was [[Iceland]] on 22 August 1991). Estonia's immediate priority after regaining its independence was the withdrawal of [[Russia]]n (formerly Soviet) forces from Estonian territory. In August 1994, this was completed. However, relations with Moscow have remained strained primarily because [[Russia]] decided not to ratify the border treaty it had signed with Estonia in 1999.

==Trends following re-independence==
Since regaining independence, Estonia has pursued a foreign policy of close cooperation with Western European nations. [[Image:GW Bush, TH Ilves 2006-2.jpg|thumb|270px|left|President [[Toomas Hendrik Ilves]] and President [[George W. Bush]], in Estonia 2006.]] The two most important policy objectives in this regard have been accession into [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]], achieved in March and May 2004 respectively. Estonia's international realignment toward the West has been accompanied by a general deterioration in relations with [[Russia]], most recently demonstrated by the controversy surrounding relocation of the [[Bronze Soldier]] WWII memorial in Tallinn.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6604647.stm | work=BBC News | title=Estonia blames Russia for unrest | date=29 April 2007 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref>  Estonia has become an increasingly strong supporter of deepening European integration. The decision to participate in the preparation of a [[financial transaction tax]] in 2012 reflects this shift in Estonia’s EU policy.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.fiia.fi/en/publication/288/estonia_strives_to_be_at_the_core_of_the_eu/ | work=[[The Finnish Institute of International Affairs]] | title=Estonia strives to be at the core of the EU | date=17 October 2012 | accessdate=14 January 2013}}</ref>

An important element in Estonia's post-independence reorientation has been closer ties with the [[Nordic countries]], especially [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]]. Indeed, Estonians consider themselves a Nordic people due to being [[Finno-Ugric]] people like the Finns rather than [[Balts]],<ref>[http://web-static.vm.ee/static/failid/220/eesti_elu.pdf  Estonian foreign ministry publication], 2004</ref><ref>[http://web-static.vm.ee/static/failid/273/Eesti%20elu.pdf  Estonian foreign ministry publication], 2002</ref> based on their historical ties with [[Denmark]] and particularly [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]]. In December 1999 Estonian foreign minister (and since 2006, [[president of Estonia]]) [[Toomas Hendrik Ilves]] delivered a speech entitled "Estonia as a Nordic Country" to the [[Swedish Institute for International Affairs]].<ref>[http://www.vm.ee/eng/nato/1210.html NATO :: NATO :: Estonia as a Nordic Country<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 2003, the [[foreign ministry]] also hosted an exhibit called "Estonia: Nordic with a Twist".<ref>[http://www.sm.ee/eng/pages/goproweb0689 Estonia - Nordic with a Twist<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> And in 2005, Estonia joined the [[European Union]]'s [[Nordic Battle Group]]. It has also shown continued interest in becoming a full member in the [[Nordic Council]].

Whereas in 1992 Russia accounted for 92% of Estonia's international trade,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/WorldwideFreedom/bg2060.cfm|title=The Estonian Economic Miracle|work=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref> today there is extensive economic interdependence between Estonia and its Nordic neighbors: three quarters of [[foreign investment]] in Estonia originates in the Nordic countries (principally Finland and Sweden), to which Estonia sends 42% of its exports (as compared to 6.5% going to Russia, 8.8% to Latvia, and 4.7% to Lithuania). On the other hand, the Estonian political system, its [[flat tax|flat rate]] of income tax, and its non-welfare-state model distinguish it from the other Nordic states, and indeed from many other European countries.<ref>http://www.investinestonia.com/pdf/ForeignTrade2007.pdf Foreign investment</ref>

Estonia is a party to 181 international organizations, including the [[Bank for International Settlements|BIS]], [[Council of the Baltic Sea States|CBSS]], [[Council of Europe|CE]], [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council|EAPC]], [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development|EBRD]], [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe|ECE]], [[European Union|EU]] (member since 1 May 2004), [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]], [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|IBRD]], [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]], [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|ICRM]], [[International Finance Corporation|IFC]], [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|IFRCS]], [[International Hydrographic Organization|IHO]], [[International Labour Organization|ILO]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[International Maritime Organization]], [[Interpol (organization)|Interpol]], [[IOC]], [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]] (observer), [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] (correspondent), [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]], [[International Trade Union Confederation|ITUC]], [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation|NATO]], [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons|OPCW]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], [[Partnership for Peace|PFP]], [[United Nations|UN]], [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|UNCTAD]], [[UNESCO]], [[United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina|UNMIBH]], [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UNMIK]], [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organization|UNTSO]], [[Universal Postal Union|UPU]], [[World Customs Organization|WCO]], [[Western European Union|WEU]] (associate partner), [[World Health Organization|WHO]], [[World Intellectual Property Organization|WIPO]], [[World Meteorological Organization|WMO]], [[World Trade Organization|WTO]].

==International disputes==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2009}}
Estonian and Russian negotiators reached a technical border agreement in December 1996. The border treaty was initialed in 1999. On 18 May 2005 Estonian Foreign Minister [[Urmas Paet]] and his Russian colleague [[Sergei Lavrov]] signed in Moscow the [http://web-static.vm.ee/static/failid/394/Est-Rus_border_treaty.pdf “Treaty between the Government of the Republic of Estonia and the Government of the Russian Federation on the Estonian-Russian border”] and the “Treaty between the Government of the Republic of Estonia and the Government of the Russian Federation on the Delimitation of the Maritime Zones in the Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Narva”. The [[Riigikogu]] (Estonian Parliament) ratified the treaties on 20 June 2005 and the President of Estonia [[Arnold Rüütel]] announced them on 22 June 2005. On 31 August 2005 Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] gave a written order to the Russian Foreign Ministry to notify the Estonian side of “Russia’s intention not to participate in the border treaties between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Estonia”. On 6 September 2005 the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Federation forwarded a note to Estonia, in which Russia informed that it did not intend to become a party to the border treaties between Estonia and Russia and did not consider itself bound by the circumstances concerning the object and the purposes of the treaties.

==Diplomatic relationships==

As of February 2012, Estonia has not established diplomatic relations with three countries: [[North Korea]], [[Sudan]], and [[Burma]]. Foreign minister [[Urmas Paet]] has indicated that after the [[2011–2012 Burmese political reforms]] Estonia is reconsidering its stance in regard to the government in Burma and is now considering establishing formal diplomatic relations.<ref>[http://www.postimees.ee/756800/millise-kahe-riigiga-pole-eestil-diplomaatilisi-suhteid/ "Millise kahe riigiga pole Eestil diplomaatilisi suhteid?"] ''[[Postimees]]'' 1. march 2012. {{et icon}}</ref>

Russia recognised Estonia via the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Estonian)|Tartu Peace Treaty]] on the 2nd of February, 1920. Russian-Estonian relations were re-established in January 1991, when the presidents [[Boris Yeltsin]] of [[RSFSR]] and [[Arnold Rüütel]] of the Republic of Estonia met in Tallinn and signed a treaty governing the relations of the two countries after the anticipated independence of Estonia from the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>Kristina Kallas, ''[http://www.ut.ee/ABVKeskus/eesti/eesti-vene.doc Eesti Vabariigi ja Vene Föderatsiooni riikidevahelised läbirääkimised aastatel 1990–1994]'' - Tartu 2000</ref><ref>[[Eesti Ekspress]]: ''[http://www.ekspress.ee/viewdoc/41763F52B461B81DC22572C800232248 Ta astus sajandist pikema sammu - Boriss Jeltsin 1931-2007]'', 25 April 2007</ref> The treaty guaranteed the right to freely choose their citizenship for all residents of the former [[Estonian SSR]].

Russia re-recognised the Republic of Estonia on 24 August 1991 after the failed [[Soviet coup attempt]], as one of the first countries to do so. The Soviet Union recognised the independence of Estonia on 6 September. Estonia's ties with Boris Yeltsin weakened since the Russian leader's initial show of solidarity with the Baltic states in January 1991. Issues surrounding the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic republics and Estonia's denial of automatic citizenship to persons who settled in Estonia in 1941-1991 and well offspring<ref>Citizenship Act of Estonia (§ 5.
