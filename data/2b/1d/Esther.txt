'''Esther''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|s|t|ər|}}; {{Hebrew Name|אֶסְתֵּר|Ester|ʼEstēr}}), born '''Hadassah''', is the eponymous heroine of the [[Book of Esther]].

According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], Esther was a [[Jewish]] queen of the [[Persian king]] [[Ahasuerus#Book of Esther|Ahasuerus]]. Ahasuerus is traditionally identified with [[Xerxes I]] during the time of the [[Achaemenid empire]]. Her story is the basis for the celebration of [[Purim]] in Jewish tradition.

==In the Bible==
{{Main|Book of Esther}}
King Ahasuerus ([[Xerxes I]]<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/967-ahasuerus "Ahasuerus", ''Jewish Encyclopedia'']</ref>) held a 180-day feast in [[Susa]] (Shoushan). While in "high spirits" from the wine, he ordered his queen, [[Vashti]], to appear before him and his guests to display her beauty. But when the attendants delivered the king's command to Queen Vashti, she refused to come. Furious at her refusal to obey, the king asked his wise men what should be done. One of them said that all the women in the empire would hear that "The King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not." Then these women would despise their husbands, which would cause many problems in the kingdom. Therefore it would be prudent to depose Vashti.<ref name=je>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5872-esther "Esther", ''Jewish Encyclopedia'']</ref>

Many beautiful maidens were then brought before the king in order that he might choose a successor to the unruly Vashti. The King chose Esther, an orphan daughter of a Benjaminite named Abihail. Esther was originally named Hadassah, meaning myrtle. She had spent her life among the Jewish exiles in Persia, where she lived under the protection of her cousin [[Mordecai]].<ref name=je/> When [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] gave permission for the exiles to return unto Jerusalem, she stayed with Mordecai.

Mordecai was the son of Jair, a Benjamite, who had been carried into captivity together with [[Jeconiah]] by Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon. Mordecai became chief minister of Ahasuerus and lived in the Persian capital of [[Susa]].<ref name=Mordecai>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10983-mordecai "Mordecai", ''Jewish Encyclopedia'']</ref> One day, while sitting at the gate of the king's palace, Mordecai overheard a plot of two [[eunuchs]], [[Bigthan and Teresh]], to kill the king. Having informed the king through Esther of the conspiracy, Mordecai brought about the execution of the two conspirators, and the event was recorded in the royal chronicles.<ref name=Mordecai/>

The grand vizier, [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]] the [[Agagite]],<ref name="agagite" group="note">A descendant of the [[Amalekite]] people, of King [[Agag]], whom [[King Saul]] of Israel was commanded by the prophet [[Samuel the Prophet|Samuel]] to utterly destroy because of their wickedness; but Saul chose to spare their king instead.({{bibleverse||1Samuel|15:1-33|HE|}})  Haman's hatred of the Jews may have had its root in this event.</ref> commanded Mordecai to do obeisance to him. Upon Mordecai's refusal to prostrate himself, Haman informed the king that the Jews were a useless and turbulent people and inclined to disloyalty, and he promised to pay 10,000 silver talents into the royal treasury for the permission to pillage and exterminate this alien race. The king then issued a proclamation ordering the confiscation of Jewish property and a general extermination of all the Jews within the empire.<ref name=je/>

Mordecai tore his robes and put ash on his head (signs of mourning or grieving) on hearing this news. Sheltered in the harem, Esther was unaware of the decree until Mordecai advised her of it through Hathach, one of the king's chamberlains.<ref name=Sidnie/> He informed her that she should not think that she would escape simply because she was in the palace. At the request of Esther, Mordecai instituted at Susa a general fast for three days.<ref name=Mordecai/>

[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn - Ahasuerus, Haman and Esther - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|260px|''[[Ahasuerus and Haman at the Feast of Esther]]'', by [[Rembrandt]]]]
Esther could not approach the king without being summoned, on pain of death, and the king had not summoned her in thirty days, implying that she may have fallen out of favor.<ref name=Crawford/> Nevertheless, at the end of the three days, Esther dressed in her royal apparel and went before the king. When the king asked her what her request was, she invited the king and Haman come to a banquet she had prepared. At the banquet they accepted her invitation to dine with her again on the following day. Haman, carried away by the joy that this honour gave him, issued orders for the erection of a gallows on which he purposed to hang the hated Mordecai.<ref name=McMahon>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05549a.htm McMahon, Arthur. "Esther." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 11 Apr. 2015]</ref>

But that night the king, being sleepless, ordered the chronicles of the nation to be read to him. Recalling that Mordecai had never been rewarded for his service in revealing the plot of the eunuchs, he asked Haman, the next day, to suggest a suitable reward for one "whom the king desired to honour". Thinking it was himself that the king had in mind, Haman suggested the use of the king's apparel and insignia. These the king ordered to be bestowed on Mordecai.<ref name=McMahon/>

Only at the second dinner party, when the king was sufficiently beguiled by her charms, did Esther reveal for the first time her identity as a Jew, and accused Haman of the plot to destroy her and her people. The king ordered that Haman should be hanged on the gallows prepared for Mordecai, and, confiscating his property, bestowed it upon the intended victim.<ref name=McMahon/> The king then appointed Mordecai as his prime minister, and issued a decree authorizing the Jews to defend themselves.<ref name=Crawford/>

==Purim==
{{Main|Purim}}
The Jews established an annual feast, the feast of [[Purim]], in memory of their deliverance. Haman set the date of Adar 13 to commence his campaign against the Jews. This determined the date of the festival of Purim.<ref name=Crawford>[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/esther-bible Crawford, Sidnie White. "Esther: Bible", Jewish Women's Archive]</ref>

==Origin and meaning of the name Esther==
It has been conjectured that the name Esther is derived from a reconstructed [[Medes|Median]] word ''astra'' meaning [[Myrtus|myrtle]].<ref>{{Cite book

An alternative view is that ''Esther'' is derived from the [[theonym]] [[Ishtar]]. The [[Book of Daniel]] provides accounts of Jews in exile being assigned names relating to [[Babylonia]]n gods and "[[Mordecai]]" is understood to mean servant of [[Marduk]], a Babylonian god. "Esther" may have been a different Hebrew interpretation from the [[Proto-Semitic]] root "star/'morning/evening star'",<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 9781139469340| editor-last = Woodard| editor-first = Roger D.| title = The Ancient Languages of Syria-Palestine and Arabia| date = 2008-04-10|  last = Huehnergard | first = John | chapter = Appendix 1: Afro-Asiatic | pages = 225–246}}</ref> which descended with the /th/ into the [[Ugaritic]] ''Athtiratu''<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Brill| isbn = 9004157697| last = Rahmouni| first = Aïcha| last2=Ford|first2=J.

[[Robert Dick Wilson|Wilson]], who identified [[Ahasuerus]] with [[Xerxes I]] and [[Vashti]] with [[Amestris]], suggested that both "Amestris" and "Esther" derived from Akkadian ''Ammi-Ishtar'' or ''Ummi-Ishtar''.<ref>[http://net.bible.org/dictionary.php?word=Ahasbai ''NeXtBible Study Dictionary'', entry "Ahasbai"]</ref> Hoschander alternatively suggested ''Ishtar-udda-sha'' ("Ishtar is her light") as the origin with the possibility of ''-udda-sha'' being connected with the similarly sounding Hebrew name Hadassah. These names however remain unattested in sources, and come from the original [[Babylonian Empire]] from 2000 BCE,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} not the [[Chaldean Empire]] or [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] of the Book of Esther.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The [[Targum]]<ref>Targum to Esther 2:7</ref> connects the name with the Persian word for "star", ''ستاره''  ''setareh'', explaining that Esther was so named for being as beautiful as the [[Venus|Morning Star]].
In the [[Talmud]] (Tractate [[Yoma]] 29a), Esther is compared to the "morning star", and is considered the subject of [[Psalm 22]], because its introduction is a "song for the morning star".

==Interpretations==
{{Further|Esther in rabbinic literature}}

Dianne Tidball argues that while [[Vashti]] is a "feminist icon", Esther is a [[Postfeminism|post-feminist]] icon.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = [[Christian Focus Publications]]| isbn = 9781857926712| last = Tidball| first = Dianne| title = Esther, a True First Lady: A Post-Feminist Icon in a Secular World| date = 2001}}</ref>

[[Abraham Kuyper]] notes some "disagreeable aspects" to her character&nbsp;— that she should not have agreed to take [[Vashti]]'s place, that she refrained from saving her nation until her own life was threatened, and that she carries out bloodthirsty vengeance.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = [[Zondervan]]| isbn = 9780310864875| last = Kuyper| first = Abraham| title = Women of the Old Testament| date = 2010-10-05| pages= 175–176|authorlink=Abraham Kuyper}}</ref>

The tale opens with Esther as beautiful and obedient, but also a relatively passive figure. During the course of the story, she evolves into someone who takes a decisive role in her own future and that of her people.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nc-i_pQsiW8C&pg=PA708&dq=esther+bible&hl=en&sa=X&ei=oNApVYjtKdH5yQSUh4GwBQ&ved=0CCEQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=esther%20bible&f=false Coogan, Michael David; Brettler, Marc Zvi; Newsom, Carol Ann and Perkins,Pheme. ''The New Oxford Annotated Bible'', Oxford University Press, 2007, ISBN 9780195288803]</ref> According to Sidnie White Crawford, "Esther's position in a male court mirrors that of the Jews in a Gentile world, with the threat of danger ever present below the seemingly calm surface." <ref name=Sidnie>[https://books.google.com/books?id=2Vo-11umIZQC&pg=PA329&dq=esther+bible&hl=en&sa=X&ei=HdYpVdfqO4OeyASck4CgDA&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAzgU#v=onepage&q=esther%20bible&f=false Crawford, Sidnie White. "Esther", ''Eerdmans Commentary on the Bible'', (James D. G. Dunn, John William Rogerson, eds.), Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2003, ISBN 9780802837110]</ref> Esther is related to [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] in that both represent a "type" for Jews living in Diaspora, and hoping to live a successful life in an alien environment.

===Esther as rhetorical model===
Since she used only [[rhetoric]] to convince the king to save her people, Esther has been interpreted as a model for a successful rhetoric of marginalized groups persuading those who have power over them. According to Susan Zaeske, the story of Esther is a "rhetoric of exile and empowerment that, for millennia, has notably shaped the discourse of marginalized peoples such as Jews, women, African Americans.”<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zaeske|first1=Susan|title=Unveiling Esther as a Pragmatic Radical Rhetoric|journal=Philosophy and Rhetoric|date=2003|volume=33|issue=3|page=194}}</ref> 
Zaeske argues that Esther speaks not only for women but for a multi-gender oppressed group and does it in such a way that “depicts rhetorical dynamics, not only of Jews living in a foreign court, but also of women coping in a society intensely hostile to their gender.”{{sfn|Zaeske, p.197}}  In this way, Esther’s rhetoric has been interpreted not as strictly feminist rhetoric or strictly Jewish rhetoric but rhetoric of intersectional exiled or marginalized groups.{{sfn|Zaeske, p.199}}

==Canonicity in Christianity==
The status of Esther as a [[Biblical canon|canonical book]] of the Bible has historically been under dispute. For example, in the first several centuries of Christianity, Esther does not appear in the lists of books produced by Melito, Athanasius, Cyril, Gregory of Nazianzus, and others. Additionally, no copies of Esther were found at Qumran in the contents of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. Nevertheless, by the fourth century CE, the majority of Western churches accepted Esther as a part of their Bibles.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Baker Academic| isbn = 9780801047107| last = McDonald| first = Lee Martin| title = The Biblical Canon: Its Origin, Transmission, and Authority| date = 2006-11-01| pages = 56, 109, 128, 131}}</ref>

Esther is also commemorated as a matriarch in the [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|Calendar of Saints]] of the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] on May 24. She is also recognized as a saint in the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox]] Churches.
