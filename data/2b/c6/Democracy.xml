The rising commercial class that had supported the Tudor monarchy in the 16th century led the revolutionary battle in the 17th, and succeeded in establishing the supremacy of Parliament and, eventually, of the House of Commons. What emerged as the distinctive feature of modern constitutionalism was not the insistence on the idea that the king is subject to law (although this concept is an essential attribute of all constitutionalism). This notion was already well established in the Middle Ages. What was distinctive was the establishment of effective means of political control whereby the rule of law might be enforced. Modern constitutionalism was born with the political requirement that representative government depended upon the consent of citizen subjects.... However, as can be seen through provisions in the 1689 Bill of Rights, the English Revolution was fought not just to protect the rights of property (in the narrow sense) but to establish those liberties which liberals believed essential to human dignity and moral worth. The "rights of man" enumerated in the English Bill of Rights gradually were proclaimed beyond the boundaries of England, notably in the American Declaration of Independence of 1776 and in the French Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789.</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>In North America, representative government began in<space/><link><target>Jamestown, Virginia</target></link>, with the election of the<space/><link><target>House of Burgesses</target></link><space/>(forerunner of the<space/><link><target>Virginia General Assembly</target></link>) in 1619.

Under a parliamentary democracy, government is exercised by delegation to an executive ministry and subject to ongoing review, checks and balances by the legislative parliament elected by the people.<extension extension_name='ref'>Keen, Benjamin, A History of Latin America.

This is done through a Vote of No Confidence where the legislature decides whether or not to remove the Prime Minister from office by a majority support for his or her dismissal.<extension extension_name='ref' name="O'Neil, Patrick H 2010">O'Neil, Patrick H.

In other parliamentary democracies extra elections are virtually never held, a minority government being preferred until the next ordinary elections. An important feature of the parliamentary democracy is the concept of the &quot;loyal opposition&quot;. The essence of the concept is that the second largest political party (or coalition) opposes the governing party (or coalition), while still remaining loyal to the state and its democratic principles.</paragraph><heading level='5'>Presidential</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Presidential system</arg></template>Presidential Democracy is a system where the public elects the president through free and fair elections. The president serves as both the head of state and head of government controlling most of the executive powers. The president serves for a specific term and cannot exceed that amount of time. Elections typically have a fixed date and aren't easily changed. The president has direct control over the cabinet, specifically appointing the cabinet members.<extension extension_name='ref' name="O'Neil, Patrick H 2010"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The president cannot be easily removed from office by the legislature, but he or she cannot remove members of the legislative branch any more easily.

The main idea about Creative Democracy is that democracy encourages individual capacity building and the interaction among the society. Dewey argues that democracy is a way of life in his work of &quot;&quot;Creative Democracy: The Task Before Us&quot;<space/><extension extension_name='ref'>http://pages.uoregon.edu/koopman/courses_readings/dewey/dewey_creative_democracy.pdf</extension><space/>and an experience built on faith in human nature, faith in human beings, and faith in working with others. Democracy, in Dewey's view, is a<space/><link><target>Morality</target><part>moral ideal</part></link><space/>requiring actual effort and work by people; it is not an institutional concept that exists outside of ourselves. &quot;The task of democracy&quot;, Dewey concludes, &quot;is forever that of creation of a freer and more humane experience in which all share and to which all contribute&quot;.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Non-governmental</heading><paragraph>Aside from the public sphere, similar democratic principles and mechanisms of voting and representation have been used to govern other kinds of groups.

Democratic political figures are not supreme rulers but rather temporary guardians of an empty place. Any claim to substance such as the collective good, the public interest or the will of the nation is subject to the competitive struggle and times of for gaining the authority of office and government. The essence of the democratic system is an empty place, void of real people which can only be temporarily filled and never be appropriated. The seat of power is there, but remains open to constant change. As such, what &quot;democracy&quot; is or what is &quot;democratic&quot; progresses throughout history as a continual and potentially never ending process of social construction.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">March 2014</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>In 2010 a study by a German military think tank has analyzed how<space/><link><target>peak oil</target></link><space/>might change the global economy.
