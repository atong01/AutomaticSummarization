A book is much easier to read, to find a page that you want, and to flip through. A scroll is more awkward to use. The Christian<space/><link><target>author</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>may also have wanted to distinguish their writings from the pagan and Judaic texts written on scrolls. In addition, some metal books were made, that required smaller pages of metal, instead of an impossibly long, unbending scroll of metal.

Traditionally, book papers are off-white or low-white papers (easier to read), are opaque to minimise the show-through of text from one side of the page to the other and are (usually) made to tighter<space/><link><target>caliper</target></link><space/>or thickness specifications, particularly for case-bound books. Different paper qualities are used depending on the type of book:<space/><link><target>Machine finished coated paper</target><trail>s</trail></link>,<space/><link><target>woodfree uncoated paper</target><trail>s</trail></link>,<space/><link><target>coated fine paper</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>special fine paper</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>are common paper grades.</paragraph><paragraph>Today, the majority of books are printed by<space/><link><target>offset lithography</target></link>.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date"><space/>July 2015</arg></template><space/>When a book is printed the pages are laid out on the plate so that after the printed sheet is folded the pages will be in the correct sequence. Books tend to be manufactured nowadays in a few standard sizes. The<space/><link><target>Book size</target><part>sizes of books</part></link><space/>are usually specified as &quot;trim size&quot;: the size of the page after the sheet has been folded and trimmed. The standard sizes result from sheet sizes (therefore machine sizes) which became popular 200 or 300 years ago, and have come to dominate the industry. British conventions in this regard prevail throughout the English-speaking world, except for the USA. The European book manufacturing industry works to a completely different set of standards.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Current processes</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Urval av de bocker som har vunnit Nordiska radets litteraturpris under de 50 ar som priset funnits.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Book covers</part></link>Some books, particularly those with shorter runs (i.e. fewer copies) will be printed on sheet-fed offset presses, but most books are now printed on web presses, which are fed by a continuous roll of paper, and can consequently print more copies in a shorter time. As the production line circulates, a complete &quot;book&quot; is collected together in one stack, next to another, and another.</paragraph><paragraph>A<space/><bold><link><target>web press</target></link></bold><space/>carries out the folding itself, delivering bundles of signatures (sections) ready to go into the gathering line. Notice that when the book is being printed it is being printed one (or two) signatures at a time, not one complete book at a time. Excess numbers are printed to make up for any spoilage due to &quot;make-readies&quot; or test pages to assure final print quality.</paragraph><paragraph>A<space/><bold>make-ready</bold><space/>is the preparatory work carried out by the pressmen to get the printing press up to the required quality of<space/><link><target>Impression (publishing)</target><part>impression</part></link>. Included in make-ready is the time taken to mount the plate onto the machine, clean up any mess from the previous job, and get the press up to speed. As soon as the pressman decides that the printing is correct, all the make-ready sheets will be discarded, and the press will start making books. Similar make readies take place in the folding and binding areas, each involving spoilage of paper.</paragraph><paragraph>After the signatures are folded and gathered, they move into the<space/><bold><link><target>bindery</target></link></bold>. In the middle of last century there were still many trade binders stand-alone binding companies which did no printing, specializing in binding alone. At that time, because of the dominance of letterpress printing, typesetting and printing took place in one location, and binding in a different factory. When type was all metal, a typical book's worth of type would be bulky, fragile and heavy. The less it was moved in this condition the better: so printing would be carried out in the same location as the typesetting. Printed sheets on the other hand could easily be moved. Now, because of increasing<space/><link><target>Automation</target><part>computerization</part></link><space/>of preparing a book for the printer, the typesetting part of the job has flowed upstream, where it is done either by separately contracting companies working for the publisher, by the publishers themselves, or even by the authors. Mergers in the book manufacturing industry mean that it is now unusual to find a bindery which is not also involved in book printing (and vice versa).</paragraph><paragraph>If the book is a<space/><link><target>hardcover</target><part>hardback</part></link><space/>its path through the bindery will involve more points of activity than if it is a<space/><link><target>paperback</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Unsewn binding, is now increasingly common. The signatures of a book can also be held together by &quot;Smyth sewing&quot; using needles, &quot;McCain sewing&quot;, using drilled holes often used in schoolbook binding, or &quot;notch binding&quot;, where gashes about an inch long are made at intervals through the fold in the spine of each signature. The rest of the binding process is similar in all instances. Sewn and notch bound books can be bound as either hardbacks or paperbacks.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Finishing</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Urval av de bocker som har vunnit Nordiska radets litteraturpris under de 50 ar som priset funnits (3).jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Book pages</part></link>&quot;Making cases&quot; happens off-line and prior to the book's arrival at the binding line. In the most basic case-making, two pieces of cardboard are placed onto a glued piece of cloth with a space between them into which is glued a thinner board cut to the width of the spine of the book. The overlapping edges of the cloth (about 5/8&quot; all round) are folded over the boards, and pressed down to adhere. After case-making the stack of cases will go to the<space/><link><target>foil stamping</target></link><space/>area for adding decorations and type.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Digital printing</heading><paragraph>Recent developments in book manufacturing include the development of digital printing. Book pages are printed, in much the same way as an office copier works, using<space/><link><target>toner</target></link><space/>rather than ink. Each book is printed in one pass, not as separate signatures. Digital printing has permitted the manufacture of much smaller quantities than offset, in part because of the absence of make readies and of spoilage. One might think of a web press as printing quantities over 2000, quantities from 250 to 2000 being printed on sheet-fed presses, and digital presses doing quantities below 250. These numbers are of course only approximate and will vary from supplier to supplier, and from book to book depending on its characteristics. Digital printing has opened up the possibility of print-on-demand, where no books are printed until after an order is received from a customer.</paragraph><heading level='3'>E-book</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>e-book</arg></template>The term e-book is a contraction of &quot;electronic book&quot;; it refers to a book-length publication in digital form.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.builderbill-diy-help.com/what-is-an-ebook.html'>&quot;An E-Book is an electronic book&quot; Author= Bill Bradley</link></extension><space/>An e-book is usually made available through the internet, but also on CD-ROM and other forms.

The difference from a modern<space/><link><target>public library</target></link><space/>lies in the fact that they were usually not funded from public sources. It is estimated that in the city of Rome at the end of the 3rd century there were around 30 public libraries.
