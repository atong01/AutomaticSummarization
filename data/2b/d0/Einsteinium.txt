'''Einsteinium''' is a [[synthetic element]] with symbol '''Es''' and [[atomic number]] 99. It is the seventh [[transuranic element]], and an [[actinide]].

Einsteinium was discovered as a component of the debris of the [[Ivy Mike|first hydrogen bomb]] explosion in 1952, and named after [[Albert Einstein]]. Its most common [[isotope]] einsteinium-253 (half life 20.47 days) is produced artificially from decay of californium-253 in a few dedicated high-power [[nuclear reactor]]s with a total yield on the order of one milligram per year. The reactor synthesis is followed by a complex process of separating einsteinium-253 from other actinides and products of their decay. Other isotopes are synthesized in various laboratories, but at much smaller amounts, by bombarding heavy actinide elements with light ions. Owing to the small amounts of produced einsteinium and the short half-life of its most easily produced isotope, there are currently almost no practical applications for it outside of basic scientific research. In particular, einsteinium was used to synthesize, for the first time, 17 atoms of the new element [[mendelevium]] in 1955.

Einsteinium is a soft, silvery, [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] [[metal]]. Its chemistry is typical of the late actinides, with a preponderance of the +3 [[oxidation state]]; the +2 oxidation state is also accessible, especially in solids. The high radioactivity of einsteinium-253 produces a visible glow and rapidly damages its crystalline metal lattice, with released heat of about 1000 [[watt]]s per gram. Difficulty in studying its properties is due to einsteinium-253's conversion to [[berkelium]] and then [[californium]] at a rate of about 3% per day. The isotope of einsteinium with the longest half life, einsteinium-252 (half life 471.7 days) would be more suitable for investigation of physical properties, but it has proven far more difficult to produce and is available only in minute quantities, and not in bulk.<ref>[http://periodic.lanl.gov/99.shtml Einsteinium]. periodic.lanl.gov</ref> Einsteinium is the element with the highest atomic number which has been observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form, and this was the common short-lived isotope einsteinium-253.<ref name=h1579/>

Like all synthetic [[transuranic element]]s, isotopes of einsteinium are very [[radioactivity|radioactive]] and are considered highly dangerous to health on ingestion.<ref name=CRC/>

==History==
[[File:Ivy Mike - mushroom cloud.jpg|thumb|left|Einsteinium was first observed in the fallout from the ''Ivy Mike'' nuclear test.]]
[[File:Einstein1921 by F Schmutzer 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The element was named after [[Albert Einstein]].]]
[[File:Albert Ghiorso ca 1970.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The element was discovered by a team headed by [[Albert Ghiorso]].]]
Einsteinium was [[discovery of the chemical elements|first identified]] in December 1952 by [[Albert Ghiorso]] and co-workers at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in collaboration with the [[Argonne National Laboratory|Argonne]] and [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] National Laboratories, in the fallout from the ''[[Ivy Mike]]'' nuclear test. The test was carried out on November 1, 1952 at [[Enewetak Atoll]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]] and was the first successful test of a [[hydrogen bomb]].<ref name="Ghiorso"/> Initial examination of the debris from the explosion had shown the production of a new isotope of [[plutonium]], {{Nuclide|Pu|Z=94|A=244}}, which could only have formed by the absorption of six [[neutron]]s by a [[uranium-238]] nucleus followed by two [[beta decay]]s.
:<math>\mathrm{^{238}_{\ 92}U\ \xrightarrow [-2\ \beta^-]{+\ 6\ (n,\gamma)} \ ^{244}_{\ 94}Pu}</math>
At the time, the multiple neutron absorption was thought to be an extremely rare process, but the identification of {{Nuclide2|Pu|Z=94|A=244}} indicated that still more neutrons could have been captured by the uranium nuclei, thereby producing new elements heavier than [[californium]].<ref name="Ghiorso">{{cite journal|first = Albert|last = Ghiorso|authorlink = Albert Ghiorso|date = 2003 |title = Einsteinium and Fermium|journal = Chemical and Engineering News|url = http://pubs.acs.org/cen/80th/einsteiniumfermium.html|volume = 81|issue = 36|doi = 10.1021/cen-v081n036.p174|pages = 174}}</ref>

Ghiorso and co-workers analyzed filter papers which had been flown through the explosion cloud on airplanes (the same sampling technique that had been used to discover {{Nuclide|Pu|Z=94|A=244}}).<ref name=s39>[[#Seaborg|Seaborg]], p. 39</ref> Larger amounts of radioactive material were later isolated from coral debris of the atoll, which were delivered to the U.S.<ref name="Ghiorso"/> The separation of suspected new elements was carried out in the presence of a [[citric acid]]/[[ammonium]] [[buffer solution]] in a weakly acidic medium ([[pH]] ≈ 3.5), using [[ion exchange]] at elevated temperatures; fewer than 200 atoms of einsteinium were recovered in the end.<ref name=em>John Emsley [http://books.google.com/books?id=j-Xu07p3cKwC&pg=PA133 Nature's building blocks: an A-Z guide to the elements], Oxford University Press, 2003, ISBN 0-19-850340-7 pp. 133–135</ref> Nevertheless, element 99 (einsteinium), namely its <sup>253</sup>Es isotope, could be detected via its characteristic high-energy [[alpha decay]] at 6.6 MeV.<ref name = "Ghiorso"/> It was produced by the [[neutron capture|capture]] of 15 [[neutron]]s by [[uranium-238]] nuclei followed by seven beta-decays, and had a [[half-life]] of 20.5 days. Such multiple neutron absorption was made possible by the high neutron flux density during the detonation, so that newly generated heavy isotopes had plenty of available neutrons to absorb before they could disintegrate into lighter elements. Neutron capture initially raised the [[mass number]] without changing the [[atomic number]] of the nuclide, and the concomitant beta-decays resulted in a gradual increase in the atomic number:<ref name="Ghiorso"/>

===Physical===
[[File:EinsteiniumGlow.JPG|thumb|upright|Glow due to the intense radiation from ~300 µg of <sup>253</sup>Es.<ref>[[#Haire|Haire]], p. 1580</ref>]]
Einsteinium is a synthetic, silvery-white, radioactive metal. In the [[periodic table]], it is located to the right of the actinide [[californium]], to the left of the actinide [[fermium]] and below the lanthanide [[holmium]] with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Its density of 8.84 g/cm<sup>3</sup> is lower than that of californium (15.1 g/cm<sup>3</sup>) and is nearly the same as that of holmium (8.79 g/cm<sup>3</sup>), despite atomic einsteinium being much heavier than holmium. The melting point of einsteinium (860&nbsp;°C) is also relatively low – below californium (900&nbsp;°C), fermium (1527&nbsp;°C) and holmium (1461&nbsp;°C).<ref name=CRC>Hammond C. R.

Contrary to the lighter actinides californium, berkelium, curium and americium which crystallize in a double [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]] structure at ambient conditions, einsteinium is believed to have a [[Cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic]] (''fcc'') symmetry with the space group ''Fm{{overline|3}}m'' and the lattice constant ''a'' = 575 pm. However, there is a report of room-temperature hexagonal einsteinium metal with ''a'' = 398 pm and ''c'' = 650 pm, which converted to the ''fcc'' phase upon heating to 300&nbsp;°C.<ref name=ev/>

The self-damage induced by the radioactivity of einsteinium is so strong that it rapidly destroys the crystal lattice,<ref name=g1268/> and the energy release during this process, 1000 watts per gram of <sup>253</sup>Es, induces a visible glow.<ref name=h1579>[[#Haire|Haire]], p. 1579</ref> These processes may contribute to the relatively low density and melting point of einsteinium.<ref Name="ES_METALL">{{cite journal|last1=Haire|first1=R.

The metal is divalent and has a noticeably high volatility.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kleinschmidt|first1=Phillip D.|last2=Ward|first2=John W.|last3=Matlack|first3=George M.|last4=Haire|first4=Richard G.|title=Henry's Law vaporization studies and thermodynamics of einsteinium-253 metal dissolved in ytterbium|journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics|volume=81|pages=473|date=1984|doi=10.1063/1.447328|bibcode = 1984JChPh..81..473K }}</ref> In order to reduce the self-radiation damage, most measurements of solid einsteinium and its compounds are performed right after thermal annealing.<ref name=s52>[[#Seaborg|Seaborg]], p. 52</ref> Also, some compounds are studied under the atmosphere of the reductant gas, for example H<sub>2</sub>O+[[hydrogen chloride|HCl]] for EsOCl so that the sample is partly regrown during its decomposition.<ref name=s60/>

Apart from the self-destruction of solid einsteinium and its compounds, other intrinsic difficulties in studying this element include scarcity – the most common <sup>253</sup>Es isotope is available only once or twice a year in sub-milligram amounts – and self-contamination due to rapid conversion of einsteinium to berkelium and then to californium at a rate of about 3.3% per day:<ref name="ES_F3"/><ref Name="ES2O3"/><ref name=s55>[[#Seaborg|Seaborg]], p. 55</ref>

Thus, most einsteinium samples are contaminated, and their intrinsic properties are often deduced by extrapolating back experimental data accumulated over time. Other experimental techniques to circumvent the contamination problem include selective optical excitation of einsteinium ions by a tunable laser, such as in studying its luminescence properties.<ref name=s76>[[#Seaborg|Seaborg]], p. 76</ref>

===Chemical===
Like all actinides, einsteinium is rather reactive. Its trivalent [[oxidation state]] is most stable in solids and aqueous solution where it induced pale pink color.<ref name="HOWI_1956">[[#Holleman|Holleman]], p. 1956</ref> The existence of divalent einsteinium is firmly established, especially in solid phase; such +2 state is not observed in many other actinides, including [[protactinium]], [[uranium]], [[neptunium]], plutonium, curium and berkelium.

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of einsteinium}}
Nineteen [[nuclide]]s and three [[nuclear isomer]]s are known for einsteinium with atomic weights ranging from 240 to 258. All are radioactive and the most stable nuclide, <sup>252</sup>Es, has a half-life of 471.7 days.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ahmad|first1=I|title=Half-life of the longest-lived einsteinium isotope-252Es|journal=Journal of Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry|volume=39|pages=1509|date=1977|doi=10.1016/0022-1902(77)80089-4|issue=9|last2=Wagner|first2=Frank}}</ref> Next most stable isotopes are <sup>254</sup>Es (half-life 275.7 days),<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McHarris|first1=William|last2=Stephens|first2=F.|last3=Asaro|first3=F.|last4=Perlman|first4=I.|title=Decay Scheme of Einsteinium-254|journal=Physical Review|volume=144|pages=1031|date=1966|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.144.1031|issue=3|bibcode = 1966PhRv..144.1031M }}</ref> <sup>255</sup>Es (39.8 days) and <sup>253</sup>Es (20.47 days).

===Nuclear fission===
Einsteinium has a high rate of [[nuclear fission]] that results in a low [[critical mass]] for a sustained [[nuclear chain reaction]]. This mass is 9.89 kilograms for a bare sphere of <sup>254</sup>Es isotope, and can be lowered to 2.9 or even 2.26 kilograms, respectively, by adding a 30 centimeter thick steel or water reflector. However, even this small critical mass greatly exceeds the total amount of einsteinium isolated thus far, especially of the rare <sup>254</sup>Es isotope.<ref name="irsn">Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire, [http://ec.europa.eu/energy/nuclear/transport/doc/irsn_sect03_146.pdf "Evaluation of nuclear criticality safety data and limits for actinides in transport"], p. 16.</ref>

===Natural occurrence===
Because of the short half-life of all isotopes of einsteinium, any [[Primordial nuclide|primordial]] einsteinium, that is einsteinium that could possibly be present on the Earth during its formation, has decayed by now.

Einsteinium-247 (half-life 4.55 minutes) was produced by irradiating americium-241 with carbon or uranium-238 with nitrogen ions.<ref name="Binder">Harry H.

===Synthesis in nuclear explosions===
[[File:ActinideExplosionSynthesis.png|thumb|300px|left|Estimated yield of transuranium elements in the U.S. nuclear tests Hutch and Cyclamen.<ref name=s40/>]]
The analysis of the debris at the 10-[[TNT equivalent|megaton]] ''Ivy Mike'' nuclear test was a part of long-term project. One of the goals of which was studying the efficiency of production of transuranium elements in high-power nuclear explosions. The motivation for these experiments was that synthesis of such elements from uranium requires multiple neutron capture. The probability of such events increases with the [[neutron flux]], and nuclear explosions are the most powerful man-made neutron sources, providing densities of the order 10<sup>23</sup> neutrons/cm<sup>2</sup> within a microsecond, or about 10<sup>29</sup> neutrons/(cm<sup>2</sup>·s). In comparison, the flux of the HFIR reactor is 5{{e|15}} neutrons/(cm<sup>2</sup>·s). A dedicated laboratory was set up right at [[Enewetak Atoll]] for preliminary analysis of debris, as some isotopes could have decayed by the time the debris samples reached the mainland U.S. The laboratory was receiving samples for analysis as soon as possible, from airplanes equipped with paper filters which flew over the atoll after the tests. Whereas it was hoped to discover new chemical elements heavier than fermium, none of these were found even after a series of megaton explosions conducted between 1954 and 1956 at the atoll.<ref name=s39/>

The atmospheric results were supplemented by the underground test data accumulated in the 1960s at the [[Nevada National Security Site|Nevada Test Site]], as it was hoped that powerful explosions conducted in confined space might result in improved yields and heavier isotopes. Apart from traditional uranium charges, combinations of uranium with americium and [[thorium]] have been tried, as well as a mixed plutonium-neptunium charge, but they were less successful in terms of yield and was attributed to stronger losses of heavy isotopes due to enhanced fission rates in heavy-element charges. Product isolation was problematic as the explosions were spreading debris through melting and vaporizing the surrounding rocks at depths of 300–600 meters. Drilling to such depths to extract the products was both slow and inefficient in terms of collected volumes.<ref name=s39/><ref name=s40>[[#Seaborg|Seaborg]], p. 40</ref>

Among the nine underground tests that were carried between 1962 and 1969,<ref>These were codenamed: "Anacostia" (5.2 [[TNT equivalent|kilotons]], 1962), "Kennebec" (<5 kilotons, 1963), "Par" (38 kilotons, 1964), "Barbel" (<20 kilotons, 1964), "Tweed" (<20 kilotons, 1965), "Cyclamen" (13 kilotons, 1966), "Kankakee" (20-200 kilotons, 1966), "Vulcan" (25 kilotons, 1966) and "Hutch" (20-200 kilotons, 1969)</ref><ref>[http://www.nv.doe.gov/library/publications/historical/DOENV_209_REV15.pdf United States Nuclear Tests July 1945 through September 1992], DOE/NV--209-REV 15, December 2000.</ref> the last one was the most powerful and had the highest yield of transuranium elements. Milligrams of einsteinium that would normally take a year of irradiation in a high-power reactor, were produced within a microsecond.<ref name=s40/> However, the major practical problem of the entire proposal was collecting the radioactive debris dispersed by the powerful blast. Aircraft filters adsorbed only about 4{{e|-14}} of the total amount, and collection of tons of corals at Enewetak Atoll increased this fraction by only two orders of magnitude. Extraction of about 500 kilograms of underground rocks 60 days after the Hutch explosion recovered only about 1{{e|-7}} of the total charge. The amount of transuranium elements in this 500-kg batch was only 30 times higher than in a 0.4&nbsp;kg rock picked up 7 days after the test which demonstrated the highly non-linear dependence of the transuranium elements yield on the amount of retrieved radioactive rock.<ref name=s43>[[#Seaborg|Seaborg]], p. 43</ref> Shafts were drilled at the site before the test in order to accelerate sample collection after explosion, so that explosion would expel radioactive material from the epicenter through the shafts and to collecting volumes near the surface. This method was tried in two tests and instantly provided hundreds kilograms of material, but with actinide concentration 3 times lower than in samples obtained after drilling. Whereas such method could have been efficient in scientific studies of short-lived isotopes, it could not improve the overall collection efficiency of the produced actinides.<ref name=s44>[[#Seaborg|Seaborg]], p. 44</ref>

Although no new elements (apart from einsteinium and fermium) could be detected in the nuclear test debris, and the total yields of transuranium elements were disappointingly low, these tests did provide significantly higher amounts of rare heavy isotopes than previously available in laboratories.<!-- About 6{{e|9}} atoms of <sup>257</sup>Fm could be recovered after the Hutch detonation. These were then used in the studies of thermal-neutron induced fission of <sup>257</sup>Fm, and in discovery of a new fermium isotope. <sup>258</sup>Fm. Also, the rare <sup>250</sup>Cm isotope was synthesized in large quantities, which would have been otherwise very difficult to produce in nuclear reactors from its progenitor <sup>249</sup>Cm – the half-life of <sup>249</sup>Cm (64 minutes) is much too short for months-long reactor irradiations, but is very "long" on the timescale of an explosion.--><ref name=s47>[[#Seaborg|Seaborg]], p. 47</ref>

===Separation===
[[File:Elutionskurven Fm Es Cf Bk Cm Am.png|thumb|[[Elution]] curves: chromatographic separation of Fm(100), Es(99), Cf, Bk, Cm and Am]]
Separation procedure of einsteinium depends on the synthesis method. In the case of light-ion bombardment inside a cyclotron, the heavy ion target is attached to a thin foil, and the generated einsteinium is simply washed off the foil after the irradiation. However, the produced amounts in such experiments are relatively low.<ref name=h1583>[[#Haire|Haire]], p. 1583</ref> The yields are much higher for reactor irradiation, but there, the product is a mixture of various actinide isotopes, as well as lanthanides produced in the nuclear fission decays. In this case, isolation of einsteinium is a tedious procedure which involves several repeating steps of cation exchange, at elevated temperature and pressure, and chromatography. Separation from berkelium is important, because the most common einsteinium isotope produced in nuclear reactors, <sup>253</sup>Es, decays with a half-life of only 20 days to <sup>249</sup>Bk, which is fast on the timescale of most experiments. Such separation relies on the fact that berkelium easily oxidizes to the solid +4 state and precipitates, whereas other actinides, including einsteinium, remain in their +3 state in solutions.<ref name=h1584>[[#Haire|Haire]], pp. 1584–1585</ref>

Separation of trivalent actinides from lanthanide fission products can be done by a cation-exchange resin column using a 90% water/10% ethanol solution saturated with [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) as [[eluant]]. It is usually followed by [[anion-exchange chromatography]] using 6 [[molar concentration|molar]] HCl as eluant. A cation-exchange resin column (Dowex-50 exchange column) treated with ammonium salts is then used to separate fractions containing elements 99, 100 and 101. These elements can be then identified simply based on their elution position/time, using α-hydroxyisobutyrate solution (α-HIB), for example, as eluant.<ref name=book2>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=U4rnzH9QbT4C&pg=PA11|pages=9–11|title=The new chemistry|author=Hall, Nina|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2000|isbn=0-521-45224-4}}</ref>

Separation of the 3+ actinides can also be achieved by solvent extraction chromatography, using bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (abbreviated as HDEHP) as the stationary organic phase, and nitric acid as the mobile aqueous phase. The actinide elution sequence is reversed from that of the cation-exchange resin column. The einsteinium separated by this method has the advantage to be free of organic complexing agent, as compared to the separation using a resin column.<ref name=book2/>

===Preparation of the metal===
Einsteinium is highly reactive and therefore strong reducing agents are required to obtain the pure metal from its compounds.<ref name=h1588>[[#Haire|Haire]], p. 1588</ref> This can be achieved by reduction of einsteinium(III) fluoride with metallic [[lithium]]:
:EsF<sub>3</sub> + 3 Li → Es + 3 LiF

However, owing to its low melting point and high rate of self-radiation damage, einsteinium has high vapor pressure, which is higher than that of lithium fluoride. This makes this reduction reaction rather inefficient. It was tried in the early preparation attempts and quickly abandoned in favor of reduction of einsteinium(III) oxide with [[lanthanum]] metal:<ref name=ev>{{cite journal|last1=Haire|first1=R|title=Preparation, properties, and some recent studies of the actinide metals|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=5235830|doi=10.1016/0022-5088(86)90554-0|date=1986|pages=379|volume=121|journal=Journal of the Less Common Metals}}</ref><ref name="ES_METALL"/><ref name=h1590>[[#Haire|Haire]], p. 1590</ref>

===Organoeinsteinium compounds===
The high radioactivity of einsteinium has a potential use in [[radiation therapy]], and organometallic complexes have been synthesized in order to deliver einsteinium atoms to an appropriate organ in the body. Experiments have been performed on injecting einsteinium [[citrate]] (as well as fermium compounds) to dogs.<ref name=h1579/> Einsteinium(III) was also incorporated into beta-diketone [[Chelation|chelate]] complexes, since analogous complexes with lanthanides previously showed strongest UV-excited [[luminescence]] among metallorganic compounds. When preparing einsteinium complexes, the Es<sup>3+</sup> ions were 1000 times diluted with Gd<sup>3+</sup> ions. This allowed reducing the radiation damage so that the compounds did not disintegrate during the period of 20 minutes required for the measurements. The resulting luminescence from Es<sup>3+</sup> was much too weak to be detected. This was explained by the unfavorable relative energies of the individual constituents of the compound that hindered efficient energy transfer from the chelate matrix to Es<sup>3+</sup> ions. Similar conclusion was drawn for other actinides americium, berkelium and fermium.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nugent|first1=Leonard J.|last2=Burnett|first2=J. L.|last3=Baybarz|first3=R. D.|last4=Werner|first4=George Knoll|last5=Tanner|first5=S. P.|last6=Tarrant|first6=J. R.|last7=Keller|first7=O.

Luminescence of Es<sup>3+</sup> ions was however observed in inorganic hydrochloric acid solutions as well as in organic solution with di(2-ethylhexyl)orthophosphoric acid. It shows a broad peak at about 1064 nanometers (half-width about 100&nbsp;nm) which can be resonantly excited by green light (ca. 495&nbsp;nm wavelength). The luminescence has a lifetime of several microseconds and the quantum yield below 0.1%. The relatively high, compared to lanthanides, non-radiative decay rates in Es<sup>3+</sup> were associated with the stronger interaction of f-electrons with the inner Es<sup>3+</sup> electrons.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Beitz|first1=J|last2=Wester|first2=D|last3=Williams|first3=C|title=5f state interaction with inner coordination sphere ligands: Es<sup>3+</sup> ion fluorescence in aqueous and organic phases|journal=Journal of the Less Common Metals|volume=93|pages=331|date=1983|doi=10.1016/0022-5088(83)90178-9|issue=2}}</ref>

==Applications==
There is almost no use for any isotope of einsteinium outside of basic scientific research aiming at production of higher [[transuranic elements]] and [[transactinides]].<ref>[http://education.jlab.org/itselemental/ele099.html It's Elemental – The Element Einsteinium]. Retrieved 2 December 2007.</ref>

In 1955, mendelevium was synthesized by irradiating a target consisting of about 10<sup>9</sup> atoms of <sup>253</sup>Es in the 60-inch cyclotron at Berkeley Laboratory. The resulting <sup>253</sup>Es(α,n)<sup>256</sup>Md reaction yielded 17 atoms of the new element with the atomic number of 101.<ref name=discovery>{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.98.1518|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=e53sNAOXrdMC&pg=PA101|isbn=978-981-02-1440-1|title=New Element Mendelevium, Atomic Number 101|date=1955|last1=Ghiorso|first1=A.|last2=Harvey|first2=B.|last3=Choppin|first3=G.|last4=Thompson|first4=S.|last5=Seaborg|first5=G.|journal=Physical Review|volume=98|pages=1518|issue=5|bibcode = 1955PhRv...98.1518G }}</ref>

The rare isotope [[einsteinium-254]] is favored for production of [[superheavy element|ultraheavy elements]] because of its large mass, relatively long half-life of 270 days, and availability in significant amounts of several micrograms.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schadel|first1=M|last2=Bruchle|first2=W|last3=Brugger|first3=M|last4=Gaggeler |first4=H|last5=Moody|first5=K|last6=Schardt|first6=D|last7=Summerer|first7=K|last8=Hulet|first8=E|last9=Dougan|first9=A|first10=R |last10=Dougan|first11=J |last11=Landrum|first12=R |last12=Lougheed|first13=J |last13=Wild|first14=G |last14=O'Kelley|first15=R |last15=Hahn

Einsteinium-254 was used as the calibration marker in the chemical analysis spectrometer ("[[Surveyor 5#Alpha-scattering surface analyzer|alpha-scattering surface analyzer]]") of the [[Surveyor 5]] lunar probe. The large mass of this isotope reduced the spectral overlap between signals from the marker and the studied lighter elements of the lunar surface.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.158.3801.635|title=Chemical Analysis of the Moon at the Surveyor V Landing Site|date=1967|last1=Turkevich|first1=A.

==Safety==
Most of the available einsteinium toxicity data originates from research on animals. Upon ingestion by rats, only about 0.01% einsteinium ends in the blood stream. From there, about 65% goes to the bones, where it remains for about 50 years, 25% to the lungs (biological half-life about 20 years, although this is rendered irrelevant by the short half-lives of einsteinium isotopes), 0.035% to the testicles or 0.01% to the ovaries – where einsteinium stays indefinitely. About 10% of the ingested amount is excreted. The distribution of einsteinium over the bone surfaces is uniform and is similar to that of plutonium.<ref>{{cite book|author=International Commission on Radiological Protection|title=Limits for intakes of radionuclides by workers, Part 4|issue=4|volume=19|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WTxcCV4w0VEC&pg=PA18|isbn=0-08-036886-7|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|date=1988|pages=18–19}}</ref>
