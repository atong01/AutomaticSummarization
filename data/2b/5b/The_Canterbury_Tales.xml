In 1386 Chaucer became Controller of Customs and Justice of Peace and then three years later in 1389 Clerk of the King's work. It was during these years that Chaucer began working on his most famous text, The Canterbury Tales. The tales (mostly written in<space/><link><target>verse (poetry)</target><part>verse</part></link>, although some are in<space/><link><target>prose</target></link>) are presented as part of a story-telling contest by a group of pilgrims as they travel together on a journey from London to Canterbury in order to visit the shrine of Saint<space/><link><target>Thomas Becket</target></link><space/>at<space/><link><target>Canterbury Cathedral</target></link>.

He uses the tales and the descriptions of its characters to paint an ironic and critical portrait of English society at the time, and particularly of the Church. Chaucer's use of such a wide range of classes and types of people was without precedent in English. Although the characters are fictional, they still offer a variety of insights into the customs and practices of the time. Often, such insight leads to a variety of discussions and disagreements to people in the 14th century. For example, although a variety of social classes are represented in these stories and all pilgrims on a spiritual quest, it is apparent that they are more concerned with worldly things than spiritual. Structurally, the collection resembles<space/><italics><link><target>The Decameron</target></link></italics>, which Chaucer may have read during his first diplomatic mission to<space/><link><target>Italy in the Middle Ages</target><part>Italy</part></link><space/>in 1372.</paragraph><paragraph>It is sometimes argued that the greatest contribution<space/><italics>The Canterbury Tales</italics><space/>made to<space/><link><target>English literature</target></link><space/>was in popularizing the literary use of the<space/><link><target>vernacular</target></link>, English, rather than French, Italian or<space/><link><target>Latin</target></link>.

It is obvious, however, that Chaucer borrowed portions, sometimes very large portions, of his stories from earlier stories, and that his work was influenced by the general state of the literary world in which he lived. Storytelling was the main entertainment in England at the time, and storytelling contests had been around for hundreds of years. In 14th-century England the English Pui was a group with an appointed leader who would judge the songs of the group. The winner received a crown and, as with the winner of the<space/><italics>Canterbury Tales</italics>, a free dinner.

A quarter of the tales in<space/><italics>Canterbury Tales</italics><space/>parallel a tale in the<space/><italics>Decameron</italics>, although most of them have closer parallels in other stories.

Whence we may conclude that Chaucer and Petrarch met at Padua early in 1373; that Petrarch told Chaucer the story by word of mouth, either in Italian or French; and that Chaucer shortly after obtained a copy of Petrarch's Latin version, which he kept constantly before him whilst making his own translation.</italics></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Genre and structure</heading><paragraph><link><target>Image:Canterbury-Cathedral-Church-of-England-1890-1900.jpg</target><part></part><part>thumb</part><part>300px</part><part><link><target>Canterbury Cathedral</target></link><space/>from the north west<space/><link><target>circa</target></link><space/>18901900 (retouched from a black &amp; white photograph)</part></link><italics>Canterbury Tales</italics><space/>is a collection of stories built around a frame narrative or<space/><link><target>frame tale</target></link>, a common and already long established genre of its period.

This idea is reinforced when the Miller interrupts to tell his tale after the Knight has finished his. Having the Knight go first, gives one the idea that all will tell their stories by class, with the Knight going first, followed by the Monk, but the Miller's interruption makes it clear that this structure will be abandoned in favour of a free and open exchange of stories among all classes present.

Medieval schools of rhetoric at the time encouraged such diversity, dividing literature (as<space/><link><target>Virgil</target></link><space/>suggests) into high, middle, and low styles as measured by the density of rhetorical forms and vocabulary. Another popular method of division came from<space/><link><target>St. Augustine</target></link>, who focused more on audience response and less on subject matter (a Virgilian concern). Augustine divided literature into &quot;majestic persuades&quot;, &quot;temperate pleases&quot;, and &quot;subdued teaches&quot;. Writers were encouraged to write in a way that kept in mind the speaker, subject, audience, purpose, manner, and occasion. Chaucer moves freely between all of these styles, showing favouritism to none. He not only considers the readers of his work as an audience, but the other pilgrims within the story as well, creating a multi-layered rhetorical puzzle of ambiguities. Chaucer's work thus far surpasses the ability of any single medieval theory to uncover.<extension extension_name='ref'>Cooper, 2224.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>With this Chaucer avoids targeting any specific audience or social class of readers, focusing instead on the characters of the story and writing their tales with a skill proportional to their social status and learning. However, even the lowest characters, such as the Miller, show surprising rhetorical ability, although their subject matter is more lowbrow. Vocabulary also plays an important part, as those of the higher classes refer to a woman as a &quot;lady&quot;, while the lower classes use the word &quot;wenche&quot;, with no exceptions. At times the same word will mean entirely different things between classes. The word &quot;pitee&quot;, for example, is a noble concept to the upper classes, while in the<space/><italics>Merchant's Tale</italics><space/>it refers to sexual intercourse. Again, however, tales such as the<space/><italics>Nun's Priest's Tale</italics><space/>show surprising skill with words among the lower classes of the group, while the<space/><italics>Knight's Tale</italics><space/>is at times extremely simple.<extension extension_name='ref'>Cooper, 2425.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Chaucer uses the same meter throughout almost all of his tales, with the exception of<space/><italics>Sir Thopas</italics><space/>and his prose tales.

His meter would later develop into the heroic meter of the 15th and 16th centuries and is an ancestor of<space/><link><target>iambic pentameter</target></link>.

Within a number of his descriptions, his comments can appear complimentary in nature, but through clever language, the statements are ultimately critical of the pilgrim's actions. It is unclear whether Chaucer would intend for the reader to link his characters with actual persons. Instead, it appears that Chaucer creates fictional characters to be general representations of people in such fields of work.

In this unruly place, the rules of tale telling are established, themselves to be both disordered and broken; here the tales of game and earnest, solas and sentence, will be set and interrupted. Here the sacred and profane adventure begins, but does not end. Here, the condition of peril is as prominent as that of protection. The act of pilgrimaging itself consists of moving from one urban space, through liminal rural space, to the next urban space with an ever fluctuating series of events and narratives punctuating those spaces. The goal of pilgrimage may well be a religious or spiritual space at its conclusion, and reflect a psychological progression of the spirit, in yet another kind of emotional space.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>Jost, Jean.

The movie opens with a group of medieval pilgrims journeying through the Kentish countryside as a narrator speaks the opening lines of the<space/><italics>General Prologue</italics>. The scene then makes a<space/><link><target>Match cut#Notable examples</target><part>now-famous transition</part></link><space/>to the time of World War II. From that point on, the film follows a group of strangers, each with his or her own story and in need of some kind of redemption, who are making their way to Canterbury together. The film's main story takes place in an imaginary town in Kent and ends with the main characters arriving at Canterbury Cathedral, bells pealing and Chaucer's words again resounding.<space/><italics>A Canterbury Tale</italics><space/>is recognised as one of the Powell-Pressburger team's most poetic and artful films. It was produced as wartime propaganda, using Chaucer's poetry, referring to the famous pilgrimage, and offering photography of Kent to remind the public of what made Britain worth fighting for. In one scene a local historian lectures an audience of British soldiers about the pilgrims of Chaucer's time and the vibrant history of England.<extension extension_name='ref'>Ellis, Steve,<space/><italics>Chaucer at Large</italics>, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2000, pp. 6465.
