At Waikiki Beach he developed his surfing and swimming skills. In his youth, Kahanamoku preferred a traditional surf board, which he called his &quot;papa nui&quot;, constructed after the fashion of ancient Hawaiian &quot;olo&quot; boards. Made from the wood of a<space/><link><target>koa</target></link><space/>tree, it was<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>16</arg><arg>ft</arg><arg>m</arg></template><space/>long and weighed<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>114</arg><arg>lb</arg><arg>kg</arg></template>. The board was without a<space/><link><target>Skeg#Surfing</target><part>skeg</part></link>, which had yet to be invented. In his later career, he would often use smaller boards but always preferred those made of wood.</paragraph><paragraph>On August 11, 1911, Kahanamoku was timed at 55.4 seconds in the<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>100</arg><arg>yd</arg><arg>m</arg></template><space/><link><target>freestyle swimming</target><part>freestyle</part></link>, beating the existing world record by 4.6 seconds, in the salt water of Honolulu Harbor.
