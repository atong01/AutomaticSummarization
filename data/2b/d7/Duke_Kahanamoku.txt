'''Duke Paoa Kahinu Mokoe Hulikohola Kahanamoku''' (August 24, 1890 – January 22, 1968) was a [[Native Hawaiian|Kānaka Maoli]] (Native Hawaiian) competition swimmer, who is widely credited with popularizing the ancient Hawaiian sport of [[surfing]].{{According to whom|date=October 2015}} He was born towards the end of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]], just before the [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|overthrow]], living well into [[Hawaii Admission Act|statehood]] as a United States citizen. He was a five-time Olympic medalist in [[Swimming at the Summer Olympics|swimming]].  Duke was also a [[law enforcement]] officer, an actor, a beach volleyball player and businessman.<ref name="Hall">{{cite book |title=Duke: A Great Hawaiian |last=Hall |first=Sandra Kimberly. |year=2004 |publisher=Bess Press |location=Honolulu, HI |isbn=1-57306-230-8 |pages= |url= }}</ref>

His name "Duke" has often been confused with a [[royal title]]; however, it was his given name, passed down from his father. His grandparents were attendants to the [[House of Kamehameha|Kamehamehas]]. While not a formal member of the royal family, he was descended from [[Alapainui]], who ruled [[Hawaii Island]].

==Early years==
According to Kahanamoku, he was born in [[Honolulu]] at [[Haleʻākala]], the home of [[Bernice Pauahi Bishop]] which was later converted into the Arlington Hotel.<ref name="Nendel">{{cite book |title= Duke Kahanamoku: Twentieth Century Hawaiian Nonarch |year=2006 |publisher=ProQuest | pages =1–13 |last=Nendel |first=James D. |last2= The Pennsylvania State University | ISBN =0-542-84320-X |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rSKo0rK3xYsC}}</ref> He had five brothers and three sisters, including [[Samuel Kahanamoku]]. In 1893, the family moved to Kālia, Waikiki (near the present site of the [[Hilton Hawaiian Village]]), to be closer to his mother's parents and family. Duke grew up with his siblings and 31 Paoa cousins.<ref name="Hall"/>{{rp|17}} Duke attended the Waikiki Grammar School, Kaahumanu School, and the [[Kamehameha Schools]], although he never graduated because he had quit to help support the family.<ref name="Gardiner">{{cite web |url= http://www.calodges.org/ncrl/duke-k.html |title=Duke Kahanamoku Paoa |author=Herbert G. Gardiner, PGS, Grand Historian |accessdate=March 22, 2011 }}</ref>

"Duke" was not a title or a nickname, but a [[given name]]. He was named after his father, Duke Halapu Kahanamoku, who was christened by Bernice Pauahi Bishop in honor of [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh]], who was visiting Hawaii at the time. His father was a policeman. His mother Julia Pa{{okina}}akonia Lonokahikina Paoa was a deeply religious woman with a strong sense of family ancestry.

Even though not of the formal Hawaiian Royal Family, his parents were from prominent Hawaiian [[ohana]] (family); the Kahanamoku and the Paoa ohana were considered to be lower-ranking nobles, who were in service to the ''[[aliʻi]] nui'' or royalty.<ref name="Nendel"/> His paternal grandfather was Kahanamoku and his grandmother, Kapiolani Kaoeha (sometimes spelled ''Kahoea''), a descendant of [[Alapainui]]. They were ''kahu'', retainers and trusted advisors of the Kamehamehas, to whom they were related. His maternal grandparents Paoa, son of Paoa Hoolae and Hiikaalani, and Mele Uliama were also of aliʻi descent.<ref name="Hall"/>{{rp|9}}<ref name="Brennan1968">{{cite book|last=Brennan|first=Joe|title=Duke of Hawaii|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BfTR8QtYHj8C{{dead link|date=October 2015}}|year=1968|publisher= |location= |pages=74–76}}</ref>

Growing up on the outskirts of Waikiki, Kahanamoku spent his youth as a bronzed beach boy. At Waikiki Beach he developed his surfing and swimming skills. In his youth, Kahanamoku preferred a traditional surf board, which he called his "papa nui", constructed after the fashion of ancient Hawaiian "olo" boards. Made from the wood of a [[koa]] tree, it was {{convert|16|ft|m}} long and weighed {{convert|114|lb|kg}}. The board was without a [[Skeg#Surfing|skeg]], which had yet to be invented. In his later career, he would often use smaller boards but always preferred those made of wood.

On August 11, 1911, Kahanamoku was timed at 55.4 seconds in the {{convert|100|yd|m}} [[freestyle swimming|freestyle]], beating the existing world record by 4.6 seconds, in the salt water of Honolulu Harbor. He also broke the record in the {{convert|220|yd|m|abbr=on}} and equaled it in the {{convert|50|yd|m|abbr=on}}. But the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU), in disbelief, would not recognize these feats until many years later. The AAU initially claimed that the judges must have been using alarm clocks rather than stopwatches and later claimed that ocean currents aided Kahanamoku.<ref>[http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/BioRC "Duke Kahanamoku.

==Career==
[[File:Duke Kahanamoku 1920.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Duke Kahanamoku with longboard, Los Angeles, 1920]]

Kahanamoku easily qualified for the U.S. Olympic swimming team in 1912.  At the [[1912 Summer Olympics]] in Stockholm, he won a gold medal in the [[Swimming at the 1912 Summer Olympics – Men's 100 metre freestyle|100-meter freestyle]], and a silver medal with the second-place U.S. team in the [[Swimming at the 1912 Summer Olympics – Men's 4 × 200 metre freestyle relay|men's 4×200-meter freestyle relay]].  During the [[1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Olympics]] in Antwerp, he won gold medals both in the 100 meters (bettering fellow Hawaiian [[Pua Kealoha]]) and in the relay.  He finished the 100 meters with a silver medal during the [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympics]] in Paris, with the gold going to [[Johnny Weissmuller]] and the bronze to Duke's brother, [[Samuel Kahanamoku]].  At age 34, this was Kahanamoku's last Olympic medal.<ref name=Murphy/> He also was an alternate for the U.S. water polo team at the [[1932 Summer Olympics]].

Between Olympic competitions, and after retiring from the Olympics, Kahanamoku traveled internationally to give swimming exhibitions. It was during this period that he popularized the sport of surfing, previously known only in Hawaii, by incorporating surfing exhibitions into these visits as well. His surfing exhibition at Sydney's [[Freshwater Beach]] on December 24, 1914 is widely regarded as a seminal event in the development of surfing in Australia.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Osmond, Gary. | year = 2010 | title = 'Honolulu Māori': Racial Dimensions of Duke Kahanamoku's Tour of Australia and New Zealand | url =  | journal = New Zealand Journal of History | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–34 }}</ref> The board that Kahanamoku built from a piece of pine from a local hardware store is retained by the Freshwater Surf Club.  There is a statue of Kahanamoku on the Northern headland of Freshwater Beach, New South Wales.  He made surfing popular in mainland America first in 1912 while in Southern California.

During his time living in Southern California, Kahanamoku performed in Hollywood as a background actor and a character actor in several films. In this way, he made connections with people who could further publicize the sport of surfing. Kahanamoku was involved with the [[Los Angeles Athletic Club]], acting as lifeguard and competing on both swimming and water polo teams.

While living in [[Newport Beach, California]] on June 14, 1925, Kahanamoku rescued eight men from a fishing vessel that capsized in heavy surf while attempting to enter the city's harbor.<ref>{{cite news |author= |author2= |title=Kahanamoku Helps Save 13 in Launch.

Using his surfboard, he was able to make quick trips back and forth to shore to increase the number of sailors rescued.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hawaiianswimboat.com/duke6.html |title=Biography: Corona Del Mar Save |accessdate=November 21, 2008 |author=Gault-Williams, Malcolm |work=Legendary Surfers |publisher=Hawaiianswimboat.com}}</ref> Two other surfers saved four more fishermen. Newport's police chief at the time called Duke's efforts "the most superhuman surfboard rescue act the world has ever seen". It also caused U.S. lifeguards to begin using surfboards in their water rescues.<ref name="Men's Journal"/>

In 1940, he married Nadine Alexander, who accompanied him when he traveled. Kahanamoku was the first person to be inducted into both the [[Swimming Hall of Fame]] and the [[Surfing Hall of Fame]]. The [[Duke Kahanamoku Invitational Surfing Championship]]s are named in his honor. He is a member of the [[United States Olympic Hall of Fame|U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame]]. He served as sheriff of [[Honolulu, Hawaii]] from 1932 to 1961, serving 13 consecutive terms. During this period, he also appeared in a number of television programs and films, such as ''[[Mister Roberts (1955 film)|Mister Roberts]]'' (1955).

Kahanamoku was a friend and surfing companion of heiress [[Doris Duke]], who built a home (now a museum) on Oahu named [[Shangri La (Doris Duke)|Shangri-la]].

== ''Duncan v. Kahanamoku'' ==

Kahanamoku was the ''[[pro forma]]'' defendant in the landmark [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case ''[[Duncan v. Kahanamoku]]''. While Kahanamoku was a [[military police]] officer during [[World War II]], he arrested Duncan for public intoxication. At the time, Hawaii, not yet a state, was being administered under the [[Hawaiian Organic Act]] which effectively instituted [[martial law]] on the island. Duncan was therefore tried by a military tribunal and appealed to the Supreme Court. In a ''post hoc'' ruling, the court ruled that trial by military tribunal was, in this case, [[unconstitutional]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

== Death and legacy ==
[[File:Duke statue.jpg|thumb|Bronze statue of Duke Kahanamoku at Kuhio Beach, Waikiki]]
Kahanamoku died of a heart attack on January 22, 1968, at the age of 77.<ref>{{cite news |author= |author2= |title=Duke Kahanamoku Dies at 77. Leading Swimmer of His Time. Olympic Swimming Champion of '12 and '20 in Freestyle.

Reverend [[Abraham Akaka]], the pastor of [[Kawaiahao Church]], performed the service. A group of beach boys sang Hawaiian songs, including "[[Aloha Oe]]." His ashes were scattered into the ocean.

Hawaii music promoter [[Kimo Wilder McVay]] capitalized on Kahanamoku's popularity by naming his Waikiki showroom "Duke Kahanamoku's," and giving Kahanamoku a piece of the financial action in exchange for the use of his name. It was a major Waikiki showroom in the 1960s and is remembered as the home of [[Don Ho]] & The Aliis from 1964 through 1969.

Kahanamoku's name is also used by Duke's Canoe Club & Barefoot Bar, a beachfront bar and restaurant in the [[Outrigger Hotels & Resorts|Outrigger]] Waikiki on the Beach Hotel. There is a chain of restaurants named after him in California and Hawaii called Duke's. A bronze statue at Waikiki beach in Honolulu honors his memory. It shows Kahanamoku standing in front of his surfboard with his arms outstretched. Many honor him by placing [[Lei (garland)|lei]]s on his statue. There is a webcam watching the statue, allowing visitors from around the world to wave to their friends.

On August 24, 2002, which was also the 112th anniversary of the birth of Duke Kahanamoku, a 37-cent first-class letter rate postage stamp of the United States Postal Service with Duke's picture on it, was issued. The First Day Ceremony was held at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Waikiki and was attended by thousands. At this ceremony, attendees could attach the Duke stamp to an envelope and get it canceled with a First Day of Issue postmark. These First Day Covers are very collectable.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060209204134/http://www.usps.com/news/2002/philatelic/sr02_048.htm Father Of International Surfing To Be Honored On New Postage Stamp]. USPS. July 30, 2002</ref>

On February 28, 2015, a monument featuring a replica of Kahanamoku's surfboard was unveiled at New Brighton beach, [[Christchurch]], [[New Zealand]] in honour of the 100th anniversary of Kahanamoku's visit to New Brighton.<ref>[http://www.3news.co.nz/sport/new-brighton-honours-surfing-legend-2015022818#axzz3jiVMOu00 New Brighton Honours Surfing Legend] TV3, 2015</ref>

On August 24, 2015, a [[Google Doodle]] honored the 125th anniversary of Duke Kahanamoku's birthday.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Plucinska|first1=Joanna|title=New Google Doodle Honors Duke Kahanamoku, the Father of Surfing|url=http://time.com/4007604/duke-kahanamoku/|website=Time Inc.|publisher=Time Inc.|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}</ref>
