'''Electronic mail''', most commonly called '''email''' or '''e-mail''' since around 1993,<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=electronic+mail%2Ce-mail&year_start=1980&year_end=1995&corpus=15&smoothing=0&share= |title=Google Ngram Viewer |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2013-04-21}}</ref> is a method of exchanging digital messages from an author to one or more recipients. Email operates across the [[Internet]] or other [[computer network]]s.

Some early email systems required the author and the recipient to both be [[Online and offline|online]] at the same time, in common with [[instant messaging]]. Today's email systems are based on a [[store-and-forward]] model. Email [[Server (computing)|servers]] accept, forward, deliver, and store messages. Neither the users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously; they need connect only briefly, typically to a [[Message transfer agent|mail server]], for as long as it takes to send or receive messages.

Historically, the term ''electronic mail'' was used generically for any electronic document transmission. For example, several writers in the early 1970s used the term to describe [[fax]] document transmission.<ref>Ron Brown, Fax invades the mail market, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Ry64sjvOmLkC&pg=PA218 New Scientist], Vol. 56, No. 817 (Oct., 26, 1972), pages 218–221.</ref><ref>Herbert P. Luckett, What's News: Electronic-mail delivery gets started, [http://books.google.com/books?id=cKSqa8u3EIoC&pg=PA85 Popular Science], Vol. 202, No. 3 (March 1973); page 85</ref> As a result, it is difficult to find the first citation for the use of the term with the more specific meaning it has today.

An Internet email message consists of three components, the message ''envelope'', the message ''header'', and the message ''body''. The message header contains control information, including, minimally, an originator's [[email address]] and one or more recipient addresses. Usually descriptive information is also added, such as a subject header field and a message submission date/time stamp.

Originally an [[ASCII]] text-only communications medium, Internet email was extended by [[Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions]] (MIME)
to carry text in other  character sets and multi-media content attachments. [[International email]], with internationalized email addresses using [[UTF-8]], has been standardized, but not yet widely adopted.

Electronic mail predates the inception of the Internet and was in fact a crucial tool in creating it,<ref>{{Harv|Partridge|2008}}</ref> but the history of modern, global Internet email services reaches back to the early [[ARPANET]]. Standards for encoding email messages were proposed as early as 1973 (RFC 561). Conversion from ARPANET to the Internet in the early 1980s produced the core of the current services. An email message sent in the early 1970s looks quite similar to a basic text message sent on the Internet today.

Email is an [[information and communications technology]]. It uses technology to communicate a digital message over the Internet. Users use email differently, based on how they think about it. There are many software platforms available to send and receive. Popular email platforms include Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo! Mail, Outlook, and many others.<ref>http://dir.yahoo.com/business_and_economy/business_to_business/communications_and_networking/internet_and_world_wide_web/email_providers/free_email/</ref>

Network-based email was initially exchanged on the ARPANET in extensions to the [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), but is now carried by the [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] (SMTP), first published as [[Internet standard]] 10 (RFC 821) in 1982. In the process of transporting email messages between systems, SMTP communicates delivery parameters using a message ''envelope'' separate from the message (header and body) itself.

==Spelling==
Electronic mail has several English [[spelling]] options:

==Origin==
The [[AUTODIN]] network, first operational in 1962, provided a message service between 1,350 terminals, handling 30 million messages per month, with an average message length of approximately 3,000 characters. Autodin was supported by 18 large computerized switches, and was connected to the [[United States General Services Administration]] Advanced Record System, which provided similar services to roughly 2,500 terminals.<ref name="NAS USPS">USPS Support Panel, Louis T Rader, Chair, Chapter IV: Systems, [http://books.google.com/books?id=5TQrAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA27 Electronic Message Systems for the U.S. Postal Service], National Academy of Sciences, Washington, D.C., 1976; pages 27–35.</ref>

===Host-based mail systems===

These original messaging systems had widely different features and ran on systems that were incompatible with each other. Most of them only allowed communication between users logged into the same host or "mainframe", although there might be hundreds or thousands of users within an organization.

===LAN email systems===
In the early 1980s, networked [[personal computer]]s on [[LAN]]s became increasingly important. Server-based systems similar to the earlier mainframe systems were developed. Again, these systems initially allowed communication only between users logged into the same server infrastructure. Examples include:
* [[cc:Mail]]
* [[Lantastic]]
* [[WordPerfect Office]]
* [[Microsoft Mail]]
* [[Banyan VINES]]
* [[Lotus Notes]]
Eventually these systems too could link different organizations as long as they ran the same email system and proprietary protocol.<ref>with various vendors supplying gateway software to link these incompatible systems</ref>

===Email networks===
To facilitate electronic mail exchange between remote sites and with other organizations, telecommunication links, such as dialup modems or leased lines, provided means to transport email globally, creating local and global networks.
* In 1971 the first [[ARPANET]] email was sent,<ref>{{cite web|title=The First Network Email|url=http://openmap.bbn.com/~tomlinso/ray/firstemailframe.html|author=Ray Tomlinson}}</ref> and through RFC 561, RFC 680, RFC 724, and finally 1977's RFC 733, became a standardized working system.
* PLATO IV was networked to individual terminals over leased data lines prior to the implementation of personal notes in 1974.<ref name=wooley/>
* Unix mail was networked by 1978's [[uucp]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cm.bell-labs.com/7thEdMan/vol2/uucp.bun |title=Version 7 Unix manual: "UUCP Implementation Description" by D. A. Nowitz, and "A Dial-Up Network of UNIX Systems" by D. A. Nowitz and M. E. Lesk |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref> which was also used for [[USENET]] newsgroup postings, with similar headers
* BerkNet, the Berkeley Network, written by [[Eric Schmidt]] in 1978 and included first in the Second Berkeley Software Distribution provided support for sending and receiving messages over serial communication links. The Unix mail tool was extended to send messages using BerkNet.<ref name="berknet"/> 
* The [[delivermail]] tool written by [[Eric Allman]] in 1979 and 1980 (and shipped in 4BSD) provided support for routing mail over different networks including Arpanet, UUCP, and BerkNet. (It also provided support for mail user aliases.)<ref name="joy-4bsd">Setting up the Fourth Berkeley Software Tape, William N. Joy, Ozalp Babaoglu, Keith Sklower, University of California, Berkeley, 1980.</ref>
* The mail client included in 4BSD (1980) was extended to provide interoperability between a variety of mail systems.<ref name="shoens-mail">Mail(1), UNIX Programmer's Manual, 4BSD, University of California, Berkeley, 1980.</ref>
* [[BITNET]] (1981) provided electronic mail services for educational institutions. It was based on the IBM VNET email system.<ref>[http://www.livinginternet.com/u/ui_bitnet.htm "BITNET History"], livinginternet.com</ref>
* In 1984, IBM PCs running DOS could link with [[FidoNet]] for email and shared bulletin board posting.

===Attempts at interoperability===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2010}}
Early interoperability among independent systems included:
* [[ARPANET]], a forerunner of the Internet, defined protocols for dissimilar computers to exchange email.
* [[uucp]] implementations for Unix systems, and later for other operating systems, that only had dial-up communications available.
* [[CSNET]], which initially used the UUCP protocols via dial-up to provide networking and mail-relay services for non-ARPANET hosts.
* [[Novell]] developed the [[Message Handling System]] (MHS) protocol<ref>[http://books.google.co.nz/books?id=vxcEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA64&lpg=PA64&dq=novell+mhs+email&source=bl&ots=dpcx3cgjXy&sig=QVA_TN-gtu4WsO27c9eGUsVx_Kw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sfzAU5jFHoislAWYjYHYDg&ved=0CEcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=novell%20mhs%20email&f=false "Delivering the Enterprise Message], 19 Sep 1994, Daniel Blum, Network World</ref><ref>[http://www.networkworld.com/archive/1994/94-03-07hot_.html ''"...offers improved performance, greater reliability and much more flexibility in everything from communications hardware to scheduling..."''], 03/07/94, Mark Gibbs,

* The [[Coloured Book protocols]] on [[United Kingdom|UK]] academic networks until 1992
* [[X.400]] in the 1980s and early 1990s was promoted by major vendors, and mandated for government use under [[GOSIP]], but abandoned by all but a few in favor of [[Internet]] [[SMTP]] by the mid-1990s.

===From SNDMSG to MSG===
In the early 1970s, Ray Tomlinson updated an existing utility called [[SNDMSG]] so that it could copy messages (as files) over the network. [[Lawrence Roberts (scientist)|Lawrence Roberts]] The project manager for the ARPANET development, took the idea of READMAIL, which dumped all "recent" messages onto the user's terminal, and wrote a programme for [[TOPS-20#TENEX|TENEX]] in [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]] macros called ''RD'', which permitted access to individual messages.<ref name="livinginternet1">{{cite web|url=http://www.livinginternet.com/e/ei.htm |title=Email History |publisher=Livinginternet.com |date=1996-05-13 |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref> Barry Wessler then updated RD and called it ''NRD''.<ref>[http://www.ir.bbn.com/~craig/email.pdf "The Technical Development of Internet Email"] Craig Partridge, April–June 2008, p.5</ref>

Marty Yonke rewrote NRD to include reading, access to SNDMSG for sending, and a help system, and called the utility ''WRD'', which was later known as ''BANANARD''. John Vittal then updated this version to include three important commands: ''Move'' (combined save/delete command), ''Answer'' (determined to whom a reply should be sent) and ''Forward'' (sent an email to a person who was not already a recipient). The system was called ''MSG''. With inclusion of these features, MSG is considered to be the first integrated modern email programme, from which many other applications have descended.<ref name="livinginternet1"/>

===ARPANET mail===
Experimental email transfers between separate computer systems began shortly after the creation of the [[ARPANET]] in 1969.<ref name="thvv" /> [[Ray Tomlinson]] is generally credited as having sent the first email across a network, initiating the use of the "[[At sign|@]]" sign to separate the names of the user and the user's machine in 1971, when he sent a message from one [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] [[DEC-10]] computer to another DEC-10. The two machines were placed next to each other.<ref name="firstnetworkemail"/><ref>Wave New World,Time Magazine, October 19, 2009, p.48</ref> Tomlinson's work was quickly adopted across the ARPANET, which significantly increased the popularity of email. 

Initially addresses were of the form, ''username@hostname''<ref>RFC 805, 8 February 1982, Computer Mail Meeting Notes</ref> but were extended to "username@host.domain" with the development of the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS).

As the influence of the ARPANET spread across academic communities, [[Gateway (telecommunications)|gateways]] were developed to pass mail to and from other networks such as [[CSNET]], [[JANET NRS|JANET]], [[BITNET]], [[X.400]], and [[FidoNet]]. This often involved addresses such as:
:hubhost!middlehost!edgehost!user@uucpgateway.somedomain.example.com
which routes mail to a user with a "[[UUCP#Mail routing|bang path]]" address at a UUCP host.

==Operation==
The diagram to the right shows a typical sequence of events<ref>{{cite video|title=How E-mail Works|medium=internet video|publisher=howstuffworks.com|year=2008|url=http://www.webcastr.com/videos/informational/how-email-works.html}}</ref> that takes place when sender [[Placeholder names in cryptography|Alice]] transmits a message using a [[E-mail client|mail user agent]] (MUA) addressed to the [[email address]] of the recipient.
<span style="float:right">[[File:email.svg|400px|Email operation]]</span>
# The MUA formats the message in email format and uses the submission protocol, a profile of the [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] (SMTP), to send the message to the local [[mail submission agent]] (MSA), in this case ''smtp.a.org''.
# The MSA determines the destination address provided in the SMTP protocol (not from the message header), in this case ''bob@b.org''. The part before the @ sign is the ''local part'' of the address, often the [[username]] of the recipient, and the part after the @ sign is a [[domain name]]. The MSA resolves a domain name to determine the fully qualified domain name of the [[Message transfer agent|mail server]] in the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS).
# The [[DNS server]] for the domain ''b.org'' (''ns.b.org'') responds with any [[MX record]]s listing the mail exchange servers for that domain, in this case ''mx.b.org'', a [[message transfer agent]] (MTA) server run by the recipient's ISP.<ref>[https://dnsdb.cit.cornell.edu/explain_mx.html "MX Record Explanation"], it.cornell.edu</ref>
# smtp.a.org sends the message to mx.b.org using SMTP. This server may need to forward the message to other MTAs before the message reaches the final [[message delivery agent]] (MDA).
# The MDA delivers it to the [[Email Mailbox|mailbox]] of user ''bob''.
# Bob's MUA picks up the message using either the [[Post Office Protocol]] (POP3) or the [[Internet Message Access Protocol]] (IMAP).

In addition to this example, alternatives and complications exist in the email system:
* Alice or Bob may use a client connected to a corporate email system, such as [[IBM]] [[Lotus Notes]] or [[Microsoft]] [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Exchange]]. These systems often have their own internal email format and their clients typically communicate with the email server using a vendor-specific, proprietary protocol. The server sends or receives email via the Internet through the product's Internet mail gateway which also does any necessary reformatting. If Alice and Bob work for the same company, the entire transaction may happen completely within a single corporate email system.
* Alice may not have a MUA on her computer but instead may connect to a [[webmail]] service.
* Alice's computer may run its own MTA, so avoiding the transfer at step 1.
* Bob may pick up his email in many ways, for example logging into mx.b.org and reading it directly, or by using a webmail service.
* Domains usually have several mail exchange servers so that they can continue to accept mail even if the primary is not available.

Many MTAs used to accept messages for any recipient on the Internet and do their best to deliver them. Such MTAs are called ''[[open mail relay]]s''. This was very important in the early days of the Internet when network connections were unreliable.{{cn|date=July 2015}}  However, this mechanism proved to be exploitable by originators of [[email spam|unsolicited bulk email]] and as a consequence open mail relays have become rare,<ref name="IMCR-016">{{cite web|url=http://www.imc.org/ube-relay.html |title=Allowing Relaying in SMTP: A Series of Surveys |accessdate=2008-04-13 |last=Hoffman |first=Paul |date=2002-08-20 |work=IMC Reports |publisher=[[Internet Mail Consortium]] |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070118121843/http://www.imc.org/ube-relay.html |archivedate=2007-01-18 }}</ref> and many MTAs do not accept messages from open mail relays.

==Message format {{anchor|Internet Message Format}}==
The Internet email message format is now defined by RFC 5322, with multi-media content attachments being defined in RFC 2045 through RFC 2049, collectively called ''[[Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions]]'' or ''MIME''. RFC 5322 replaced the earlier RFC 2822 in 2008, and in turn RFC 2822 in 2001 replaced RFC 822 – which had been the standard for Internet email for nearly 20 years. Published in 1982, RFC 822 was based on the earlier RFC 733 for the [[ARPANET]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Ken|last=Simpson|title=An update to the email standards|date=October 3, 2008|publisher=MailChannels Blog Entry|url= http://blog.mailchannels.com/2008/10/update-to-email-standards.html}}</ref>

Internet email messages consist of two major sections, the message header and the message body.  The header is structured into [[Field (computer science)|fields]] such as From, To, CC, Subject, Date, and other information about the email. The body contains the message, as unstructured text, sometimes containing a [[signature block]] at the end. The header is separated from the body by a blank line.

===Message header===
<!-- This section is linked from [[Bracket]] -->
Each message has exactly one [[Header (computing)|header]], which is structured into [[Field (computer science)|fields]]. Each field has a name and a value. RFC 5322 specifies the precise syntax.

Informally, each line of text in the header that begins with a [[Printable characters|printable character]] begins a separate field. The field name starts in the first character of the line and ends before the separator character ":". The separator is then followed by the field value (the "body" of the field). The value is continued onto subsequent lines if those lines have a space or tab as their first character. Field names and values are restricted to 7-bit [[ASCII]] characters. Non-ASCII values may be represented using MIME [[MIME#Encoded-Word|encoded words]].

====Header fields====
Email header fields can be multi-line, and each line should be at most 78 characters long and in no event more than 998 characters long.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322|title=RFC 5322, Internet Message Format|author=P. Resnick, Ed.|date=October 2008|publisher=IETF}}</ref> Header fields defined by RFC 5322 can only contain [[US-ASCII]] characters; for encoding characters in other sets, a syntax specified in RFC 2047 can be used.<ref>{{cite web|last=Moore|first=K|title=MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part Three: Message Header Extensions for Non-ASCII Text|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2047|publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]|accessdate=2012-01-21| date=November 1996 }}</ref> Recently the IETF EAI working group has defined some standards track extensions,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6532|title=RFC 6532, Internationalized Email Headers|author=A Yang, Ed.|date=February 2012|publisher=IETF|ISSN=2070-1721}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6531|title=RFC 6531, SMTP Extension for Internationalized Email Addresses|author=J. Yao, Ed., W. Mao, Ed.|date=February 2012|publisher=IETF|ISSN=2070-1721}}</ref> replacing previous experimental extensions, to allow [[UTF-8]] encoded [[Unicode]] characters to be used within the header. In particular, this allows email addresses to use non-ASCII characters. Such characters must only be used by servers that support these extensions.

The message header must include at least the following fields:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section-3.6 |title=RFC 5322, 3.6. Field Definitions |publisher=Tools.ietf.org |date=October 2008|accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref>
* ''From'': The [[email address]], and optionally the name of the author(s). In many email clients not changeable except through changing account settings.
* ''Date'': The local time and date when the message was written. Like the ''From:'' field, many email clients fill this in automatically when sending. The recipient's client may then display the time in the format and time zone local to him/her.

The message header should include at least the following fields:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section-3.6.4 |title=RFC 5322, 3.6.4. Identification Fields |publisher=Tools.ietf.org |date=October 2008|accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref>
* ''Message-ID'': Also an automatically generated field; used to prevent multiple delivery and for reference in In-Reply-To: (see below).
* ''In-Reply-To'': [[Message-ID]] of the message that this is a reply to. Used to link related messages together. This field only applies for reply messages.

RFC 3864 describes registration procedures for message header fields at the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]]; it provides for [http://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/perm-headers.html permanent] and [http://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/prov-headers.html provisional] message header field names, including also fields defined for MIME, netnews, and http, and referencing relevant RFCs. Common header fields for email include:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5064 |title=RFC 5064 |publisher=Tools.ietf.org|date=December 2007 |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref>
* ''To'': The email address(es), and optionally name(s) of the message's recipient(s). Indicates primary recipients (multiple allowed), for secondary recipients see Cc: and Bcc: below.
* ''Subject'': A brief summary of the topic of the message. [[E-mail subject abbreviations|Certain abbreviations]] are commonly used in the subject, including [[E-mail subject abbreviations|"RE:" and "FW:"]].
* ''Bcc'': [[Blind carbon copy]]; addresses added to the SMTP delivery list but not (usually) listed in the message data, remaining invisible to other recipients.
* ''Cc'': [[Carbon copy]]; Many email clients will mark email in one's inbox differently depending on whether they are in the To: or Cc: list.
* [[Content-Type]]: Information about how the message is to be displayed, usually a [[MIME]] type.
* ''Precedence'': commonly with values "bulk", "junk", or "list"; used to indicate that automated "vacation" or "out of office" responses should not be returned for this mail, e.g. to prevent vacation notices from being sent to all other subscribers of a mailing list. [[Sendmail]] uses this header to affect prioritization of queued email, with "Precedence: special-delivery" messages delivered sooner. With modern high-bandwidth networks delivery priority is less of an issue than it once was. [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Microsoft Exchange]] respects a fine-grained automatic response suppression mechanism, the X-Auto-Response-Suppress header.<ref>Microsoft, Auto Response Suppress, 2010, [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee219609(v=EXCHG.80).aspx microsoft reference], 2010 Sep 22</ref>
* ''References'': [[Message-ID]] of the message that this is a reply to, and the message-id of the message the previous reply was a reply to, etc.
* ''Reply-To'': Address that should be used to reply to the message.
* ''Sender'': Address of the actual sender acting on behalf of the author listed in the From: field (secretary, list manager, etc.).
* ''Archived-At'': A direct link to the archived form of an individual email message.

Note that the ''To:'' field is not necessarily related to the addresses to which the message is delivered. The actual delivery list is supplied separately to the transport protocol, [[SMTP]], which may or may not originally have been extracted from the header content. The "To:" field is similar to the addressing at the top of a conventional letter which is delivered according to the address on the outer envelope. In the same way, the "From:" field does not have to be the real sender of the email message. Some mail servers apply [[email authentication]] systems to messages being relayed. Data pertaining to server's activity is also part of the header, as defined below.

SMTP defines the ''trace information'' of a message, which is also saved in the header using the following two fields:<ref>{{cite IETF|title=Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|rfc=5321|author=[[John Klensin]]|sectionname=Trace Information|section=4.4| date=October 2008 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}</ref>
* ''Received'': when an SMTP server accepts a message it inserts this trace record at the top of the header (last to first).
* ''Return-Path'': when the delivery SMTP server makes the ''final delivery'' of a message, it inserts this field at the top of the header.

Other header fields that are added on top of the header by the receiving server may be called ''trace fields'', in a broader sense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/apps-discuss/current/msg04115.html|title=Trace headers|author=John Levine|date=14 January 2012|work=email message|publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]|accessdate=16 January 2012|quote=there are many more trace headers than those two}}</ref>
* ''Authentication-Results'': when a server carries out authentication checks, it can save the results in this field for consumption by downstream agents.<ref>This extensible field is defined by RFC 7001, that also defines an [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] registry of [http://www.iana.org/assignments/email-auth/ Email Authentication Parameters].</ref>
* ''Received-SPF'': stores results of [[Sender Policy Framework|SPF]] checks in more detail than Authentication-Results.<ref>RFC 7208.</ref>
* ''Auto-Submitted'': is used to mark automatically generated messages.<ref>Defined in RFC 3834, and updated by RFC 5436.</ref>
* ''VBR-Info'': claims [[Vouch by Reference|VBR]] whitelisting<ref>RFC 5518.</ref>

===Message body===
====Content encoding====
Email was originally designed for 7-bit [[ASCII]].<ref>{{cite book|title=TCP/IP Network Administration|year=2002|isbn=978-0-596-00297-8|author=Craig Hunt|publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]]|page=70}}</ref> Most email software is [[8-bit clean]] but must assume it will communicate with 7-bit servers and mail readers. The [[MIME]] standard introduced character set specifiers and two content transfer encodings to enable transmission of non-ASCII data: [[quoted printable]] for mostly 7 bit content with a few characters outside that range and [[base64]] for arbitrary binary data. The [[8BITMIME]] and [[BINARY]] extensions were introduced to allow transmission of mail without the need for these encodings, but many [[mail transport agent]]s still do not support them fully. In some countries, several encoding schemes coexist; as the result, by default, the message in a non-Latin alphabet language appears in non-readable form (the only exception is coincidence, when the sender and receiver use the same encoding scheme). Therefore, for international [[character set]]s, [[Unicode]] is growing in popularity.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

====Plain text and HTML====
Most modern graphic [[email client]]s allow the use of either [[plain text]] or [[HTML#HTML email|HTML]] for the message body at the option of the user. [[HTML email]] messages often include an automatically generated plain text copy as well, for compatibility reasons.

Advantages of HTML include the ability to include in-line links and images, set apart previous messages in [[block quote]]s, wrap naturally on any display, use emphasis such as [[underline]]s and [[italics]], and change [[font]] styles. Disadvantages include the increased size of the email, privacy concerns about [[web bug]]s, abuse of HTML email as a vector for [[phishing]] attacks and the spread of [[malware|malicious software]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Email policies that prevent viruses|url=http://advosys.ca/papers/mail-policies.html}}</ref>

Some web based [[mailing list]]s recommend that all posts be made in plain-text, with 72 or 80 [[characters per line]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://helpdesk.rootsweb.com/listadmins/plaintext.html |title=When posting to a RootsWeb mailing list... |publisher=Helpdesk.rootsweb.com |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.openbsd.org/mail.html |title=...Plain text, 72 characters per line... |publisher=Openbsd.org |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref> for all the above reasons, but also because they have a significant number of readers using [[List_of_email_clients#Text-based|text-based email clients]] such as [[Mutt (email client)|Mutt]].

Some [[Microsoft]] [[email client]]s allow rich formatting using their proprietry [[Rich Text Format]] (RTF), but this should be avoided unless the recipient is guaranteed to have a compatible [[email client]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/138053 |title=How to Prevent the Winmail.dat File from Being Sent to Internet Users |publisher=Support.microsoft.com |date=2010-07-02 |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref>

==Servers and client applications==
[[File:Mozilla Thunderbird 3.1.png|thumb|right|300px|The interface of an email client, [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]].]]
<!-- This section is linked from [[Catch-all (Mail)]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] -->
Messages are exchanged between hosts using the [[SMTP|Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] with software programs called [[mail transfer agent]]s (MTAs); and delivered to a mail store by programs called [[mail delivery agent]]s (MDAs, also sometimes called local delivery agents, LDAs). Users can retrieve their messages from servers using standard protocols such as [[Post Office Protocol|POP]] or [[IMAP]], or, as is more likely in a large [[corporation|corporate]] environment, with a [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] protocol specific to [[Novell Groupwise]], [[Lotus Notes]] or [[Microsoft Exchange Server]]s. Webmail interfaces allow users to access their mail with any standard [[web browser]], from any computer, rather than relying on an email client. Programs used by users for retrieving, reading, and managing email are called [[mail user agent]]s (MUAs).

Mail can be stored on the [[client (computing)|client]], on the [[Server (computing)|server]] side, or in both places. Standard formats for mailboxes include [[Maildir]] and [[mbox]]. Several prominent email clients use their own proprietary format and require conversion software to transfer email between them. Server-side storage is often in a proprietary format but since access is through a standard protocol such as [[IMAP]], moving email from one server to another can be done with any [[Mail user agent|MUA]] supporting the protocol.

Accepting a message obliges an MTA to deliver it,<ref>In practice, some accepted messages may nowadays not be delivered to the recipient's InBox, but instead to a Spam or Junk folder which, especially in a corporate environment, may be inaccessible to the recipient</ref> and when a message cannot be delivered, that MTA must send a [[bounce message]] back to the sender, indicating the problem.

===Filename extensions===
Upon reception of email messages, [[email client]] applications save messages in operating system files in the file system. Some clients save individual messages as separate files, while others use various database formats, often proprietary, for collective storage. A historical standard of storage is the ''[[mbox]]'' format. The specific format used is often indicated by special [[filename extension]]s:
;<tt>eml</tt>
:Used by many email clients including [[Novell GroupWise]], [[Microsoft Outlook Express]], [[Lotus notes]], [[Windows Mail]], [[Mozilla Thunderbird]], and Postbox. The files are [[plain text]] in [[MIME]] format, containing the email header as well as the message contents and attachments in one or more of several formats.
;<tt>emlx</tt>
:Used by [[Apple Mail]].
;<tt>msg</tt>
:Used by [[Microsoft Outlook|Microsoft Office Outlook]] and [[OfficeLogic|OfficeLogic Groupware]].
;<tt>mbx</tt>
:Used by [[Opera Mail]], [[KMail]], and [[Apple Mail]] based on the [[mbox]] format.

Some applications (like [[Apple Mail]]) leave attachments encoded in messages for searching while also saving separate copies of the attachments. Others separate attachments from messages and save them in a specific directory.

Mobile devices, such as [[smart cell phone]]s and [[tablet computer]]s, commonly have the ability to receive email. Since users may always have their mobile device with them, users may access email significantly faster on these devices than through other methods, such as [[desktop computer]]s or [[laptop]]s.

===URI scheme mailto===
{{main|mailto}}
The [[URI scheme]], as registered with the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]], defines the <tt>mailto:</tt> scheme for SMTP email addresses. Though its use is not strictly defined, URLs of this form are intended to be used to open the new message window of the user's mail client when the URL is activated, with the address as defined by the URL in the ''To:'' field.<ref>RFC 2368 section 3 : by Paul Hoffman in 1998 discusses operation of the "mailto" URL.</ref>

==Types==
===Web-based email===
{{main|Webmail}}
Many email providers have a web-based email client (e.g. [[AOL Mail]], [[Gmail]], [[Outlook.com]] and [[Yahoo! Mail]]). This allows users to log into the email account by using any compatible [[web browser]] to send and receive their email. Mail is typically not downloaded to the client, so can't be read without a current Internet connection.

===POP3 email services===
The [[Post Office Protocol]] 3 (POP3) is a mail access protocol used by a client application to read messages from the mail server. Received messages are often deleted from the [[server (computing)|server]]. POP supports simple download-and-delete requirements for access to remote mailboxes (termed maildrop in the POP RFC's).<ref name="Windows to Linux">{{cite book | last = Allen | first = David | title = Windows to Linux | publisher = Prentice Hall | year = 2004 | location = | page =192 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=UD0h_GqgbHgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=network%2B+guide+to+networks&hl=en&src=bmrr&ei=hMnATfmmA8j00gGMsOC2Cg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CE8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>

===IMAP email servers===
The [[Internet Message Access Protocol]] (IMAP) provides features to manage a mailbox from multiple devices. Small portable devices like [[smartphones]] are increasingly used to check email while travelling, and to make brief replies, larger devices with better keyboard access being used to reply at greater length. IMAP shows the headers of messages, the sender and the subject and the device needs to request to download specific messages. Usually mail is left in folders in the mail server.

===MAPI email servers===
[[MAPI|Messaging Application Programming Interface]] (MAPI) is a messaging architecture and an API based on the Component Object Model (COM) for Microsoft Windows.

==Use==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2007}}

===Flaming===
[[Flaming (Internet)|Flaming]] occurs when a person sends a message with angry or antagonistic content. The term is derived from the use of the word Incendiary to describe particularly heated email discussions. Flaming is assumed to be more common today because of the ease and impersonality of email communications: confrontations in person or via telephone require direct interaction, where social norms encourage civility, whereas typing a message to another person is an indirect interaction, so civility may be forgotten.

===Email bankruptcy===
{{main|Email bankruptcy}}
Also known as "email fatigue", email bankruptcy is when a user ignores a large number of email messages after falling behind in reading and answering them. The reason for falling behind is often due to information overload and a general sense there is so much information that it is not possible to read it all. As a solution, people occasionally send a boilerplate message explaining that the email inbox is being cleared out. [[Harvard University]] law professor [[Lawrence Lessig]] is credited with coining this term, but he may only have popularized it.<ref>{{cite news|title=All We Are Saying.|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/weekinreview/23buzzwords.html?ref=weekinreview|publisher=New York Times|date=December 23, 2007|accessdate=2007-12-24|first=Grant|last=Barrett}}</ref>

===In business===
Email was widely accepted by the business community as the first broad electronic communication medium and was the first 'e-revolution' in business communication. Email is very simple to understand and like postal mail, email solves two basic problems of communication: logistics and synchronization (see below).

LAN based email is also an emerging form of usage for business. It not only allows the business user to download mail when ''offline'', it also allows the small business user to have multiple users' email IDs with just ''one email connection''.

====Pros====
* ''The problem of logistics'': Much of the business world relies on communications between people who are not physically in the same building, area, or even country; setting up and attending an in-person meeting, [[telephone call]], or [[conference call]] can be inconvenient, time-consuming, and costly. Email provides a method of exchanging information between two or more people with no set-up costs and that is generally far less expensive than a physical meeting or phone call.
* ''The problem of synchronisation'': With [[Real-time computing|real time]] communication by meetings or phone calls, participants must work on the same schedule, and each participant must spend the same amount of time in the meeting or call. Email allows [[asynchrony]]: each participant may control their schedule independently.

====Cons====
{{Original research|section|date=June 2009}}
Most business workers today spend from one to two hours of their working day using email: reading, ordering, sorting, 're-contextualizing' fragmented information, and writing email.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smallbiztrends.com/2007/06/email-has-right-to-privacy-why-small-businesses-care.html|title=Email Right to Privacy – Why Small Businesses Care| date=2007-06-19|publisher=Anita Campbell}}</ref> The use of email is increasing worldwide:
* ''Information overload'': Email is a [[push technology]] – the sender controls who receives the information. Convenient availability of [[mailing list]]s and use of "copy all" can lead to people receiving unwanted or irrelevant information of no use to them.
* ''Inconsistency'': Email can duplicate information. This can be a problem when a large team is working on documents and information while not in constant contact with the other members of their team.

Despite these disadvantages, email has become the most widely used medium of communication within the business world. A 2010 study on workplace communication by Paytronics found 83% of U.S. knowledge workers felt email was critical to their success and productivity at work.<ref name=om>By Om Malik, GigaOm. "[http://gigaom.com/collaboration/is-email-a-curse-or-a-boon/ Is Email a Curse or a Boon?]" September 22, 2010. Retrieved October 11, 2010.</ref>

====Research on email marketing====
Marketing research suggests that opt-in email marketing can be viewed as useful by consumers if it contains information such as special sales offerings and new product information. Offering interesting hyperlinks or generic information on consumer trends is less useful.<ref>Martin, Brett A. S., Joel Van Durme, Mika Raulas, and Marko Merisavo (2003), [http://www.basmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Martin-et-al-2003.pdf "E-mail Marketing: Exploratory Insights from Finland"], ''Journal of Advertising Research'', 43 (3), 293–300.</ref> This research by Martin et al. (2003) also shows that if consumers find email marketing useful, they are likely to visit a store, thereby overcoming limitations of Internet marketing such as not being able to touch or try on a product.

===Mobile===
Email has become widely used on smart phones. Mobile apps for email increase accessibility to the medium. While before users could only access email on computers, it is now possible for users to check their email out of the home and out of the library while on the go. Alerts can also be sent to the phone to notify them immediately of new messages. This has given email the ability to be used for more frequent communication between users and allowed them to check their email and write messages throughout the day.

It was found that US adults check their email more than they browse the web or check their [[Facebook]] accounts, making email the most popular activity for users to do on their smart phones. 78% of the respondents in the study revealed that they check their email on their phone.<ref>[http://marketingland.com/smartphone-activities-study-email-web-facebook-37954 Matt McGee. March 28, 2013. Email Is Top Activity On Smartphones, Ahead Of Web Browsing & Facebook (Study)]</ref> It was also found that 30% of consumers use only their smartphone to check their email, and 91% were likely to check their email at least once per day on their smartphone. However, the percentage of consumers using email on smartphone ranges and differs dramatically across different countries. For example, in comparison to 75% of those consumers in the US who used it, only 17% in India did.<ref>[http://www.emailmonday.com/mobile-email-usage-statistics Jordan van Rijn. April 2014. The ultimate mobile email statistics overview]</ref>

==Problems==

===Attachment size limitation===
{{Main|Email attachment}}
Email messages may have one or more attachments, i.e. MIME parts intended to provide copies of files. Attachments serve the purpose of delivering binary or text files of unspecified size. In principle there is no technical intrinsic restriction in the [[#Message format|InternetMessage Format]], [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]] protocol or [[MIME]] limiting the size or number of attachments. In practice, however, email service providers implement various limitations on the permissible size of files or the size of an entire message.

Furthermore, due to technical reasons, often a small attachment can increase in size when sent,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2009.01.exchangeqa.aspx?pr=blog|title=Exchange 2007: Attachment Size Increase,...|date=2010-03-25|publisher=TechNet Magazine, Microsoft.com US}}</ref> which can be confusing to senders when trying to assess whether they can or cannot send a file by email, and this can result in their message being rejected.

As larger and larger file sizes are being created and traded, many users are either forced to upload and download their files using an [[FTP server]], or more popularly, use online file sharing facilities or services, usually over web-friendly [[HTTP]], in order to send and receive them.

===Information overload===
A December 2007 [[New York Times]] blog post described information overload as "a $650 Billion Drag on the Economy",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/20/is-information-overload-a-650-billion-drag-on-the-economy|title=Is Information Overload a $650 Billion Drag on the Economy?|date=2007-12-20|publisher=New York Times|first=Steve|last=Lohr|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> and the New York Times reported in April 2008 that "E-MAIL has become the bane of some people's professional lives" due to information overload, yet "none of the current wave of high-profile Internet start-ups focused on email really eliminates the problem of email overload because none helps us prepare replies".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/technology/20digi.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&oref=slogin|title=Struggling to Evade the E-Mail Tsunami|date=2008-04-20|publisher=New York Times|first=Randall|last=Stross|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> GigaOm posted a similar article in September 2010, [http://gigaom.com/collaboration/is-email-a-curse-or-a-boon/ highlighting research] that found 57% of knowledge workers were overwhelmed by the volume of email they received.<ref name="om"/> Technology investors reflect similar concerns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foundrygroup.com/blog/archives/2008/04/did-darwin-skip-over-email.php|title=Did Darwin Skip Over Email?|date=2008-04-28|publisher=Foundry Group}}</ref>

In October 2010, CNN published an article titled "Happy Information Overload Day" that compiled research about ''email overload'' from IT companies and productivity experts. According to Basex, the average knowledge worker receives 93 messages per day. Subsequent studies have reported higher numbers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Radicati|first=Sara|title=Email Statistics Report, 2010|url=http://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Email-Statistics-Report-2010-2014-Executive-Summary2.pdf}}</ref> Marsha Egan, an email productivity expert, called email technology both a blessing and a curse in the article. She stated, "Everyone just learns that they have to have it dinging and flashing and open just in case the boss e-mails," she said. "The best gift any group can give each other is to never use e-mail urgently. If you need it within three hours, pick up the phone."<ref>{{cite news|last=Gross|first=Doug|title=Happy Information Overload Day!|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-10-20/tech/information.overload.day_1_mails-marsha-egan-rss?_s=PM:TECH|work=CNN|date=July 26, 2011}}</ref>

===Spamming and computer viruses===
The usefulness of email is being threatened by four phenomena: [[email bomb]]ardment, [[E-mail spam|spamming]], [[phishing]], and [[Computer worm|email worms]].

Spamming is unsolicited commercial (or bulk) email. Because of the minuscule cost of sending email, spammers can send hundreds of millions of email messages each day over an inexpensive Internet connection. Hundreds of active spammers sending this volume of mail results in [[information overload]] for many computer users who receive voluminous unsolicited email each day.<ref name="R">Rich Kawanagh. The top ten email spam list of 2005. ITVibe news, 2006, January 02, [http://itvibe.com/news/3837/ ITvibe.com]</ref><ref>How Microsoft is losing the war on spam [http://dir.salon.com/story/tech/feature/2005/01/19/microsoft_spam/index.html Salon.com]</ref>

Email worms use email as a way of replicating themselves into vulnerable computers. Although the [[Morris (computer worm)|first email worm]] affected [[UNIX]] computers, the problem is most common today on the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system.

The combination of spam and worm programs results in users receiving a constant drizzle of junk email, which reduces the usefulness of email as a practical tool.

A number of [[anti-spam techniques (email)|anti-spam techniques]] mitigate the impact of spam. In the [[United States]], [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] has also passed a law, the [[Can Spam Act of 2003]], attempting to regulate such email. [[Australia]] also has very strict spam laws restricting the sending of spam from an Australian ISP,<ref>Spam Bill 2003 ([http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/bd/2003-04/04bd045.pdf PDF])</ref> but its impact has been minimal since most spam comes from regimes that seem reluctant to regulate the sending of spam.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Email spoofing===
{{Main|Email spoofing}}
[[Email spoofing]] occurs when the email message header is designed to make the message appear to come from a known or trusted source. [[Email spam]] and [[phishing]] methods typically use spoofing to mislead the recipient about the true message origin.

===Email bombing===
{{main|Email bomb}}

[[Email bomb]]ing is the intentional sending of large volumes of messages to a target address. The overloading of the target email address can render it unusable and can even cause the mail server to crash.

===Privacy concerns===
{{Main|Internet privacy}}

Today it can be important to distinguish between Internet and internal email systems. Internet email may travel and be stored on networks and computers without the sender's or the recipient's control. During the transit time it is possible that third parties read or even modify the content. Internal mail systems, in which the information never leaves the organizational network, may be more secure, although [[information technology]] personnel and others whose function may involve monitoring or managing may be accessing the email of other employees.

Email privacy, without some security precautions, can be compromised because:
* email messages are generally not encrypted.
* email messages have to go through intermediate computers before reaching their destination, meaning it is relatively easy for others to intercept and read messages.
* many Internet Service Providers (ISP) store copies of email messages on their mail servers before they are delivered. The backups of these can remain for up to several months on their server, despite deletion from the mailbox.
* the "Received:"-fields and other information in the email can often identify the sender, preventing anonymous communication.

There are [[cryptography]] applications that can serve as a remedy to one or more of the above. For example, [[Virtual Private Network]]s or the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor anonymity network]] can be used to encrypt traffic from the user machine to a safer network while [[GNU Privacy Guard|GPG]], [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]], SMEmail,<ref> [http://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1002.3176 SMEmail – A New Protocol for the Secure E-mail in Mobile Environments], Proceedings of the Australian Telecommunications Networks and Applications Conference (ATNAC'08), pp. 39–44, Adelaide, Australia, Dec. 2008.</ref> or [[S/MIME]] can be used for [[end-to-end principle|end-to-end]] message encryption, and SMTP STARTTLS or SMTP over [[Transport Layer Security]]/Secure Sockets Layer can be used to encrypt communications for a single mail hop between the SMTP client and the SMTP server.

Additionally, many [[mail user agent]]s do not protect logins and passwords, making them easy to intercept by an attacker. Encrypted authentication schemes such as [[Simple Authentication and Security Layer|SASL]] prevent this.

Finally, attached files share many of the same hazards as those found in [[Peer-to-peer|peer-to-peer filesharing]]. Attached files may contain [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojans]] or [[Computer virus|viruses]].

===Tracking of sent mail===
The original SMTP mail service provides limited mechanisms for tracking a transmitted message, and none for verifying that it has been delivered or read. It requires that each mail server must either deliver it onward or return a failure notice (bounce message), but both software bugs and system failures can cause messages to be lost. To remedy this, the [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] introduced [[Delivery Status Notification]]s (delivery receipts) and [[Return receipt#Email|Message Disposition Notifications]] (return receipts); however, these are not universally deployed in production. (A complete Message Tracking mechanism was also defined, but it never gained traction; see RFCs 3885<ref>[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3885 RFC 3885], ''SMTP Service Extension for Message Tracking''</ref> through 3888.<ref>[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3888 RFC 3888], ''Message Tracking Model and Requirements''</ref>)

Many ISPs now deliberately disable non-delivery reports (NDRs) and delivery receipts due to the activities of spammers:
* Delivery Reports can be used to verify whether an address exists and so is available to be spammed
* If the spammer uses a forged sender email address ([[email spoofing]]), then the innocent email address that was used can be flooded with NDRs from the many invalid email addresses the spammer may have attempted to mail. These NDRs then constitute spam from the ISP to the innocent user

In the absence of standard methods, a range of system based around the use of [[web bug]]s have been developed. However, these are often seen as underhand or raising privacy concerns,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940CE0D9143AF931A15752C1A9669C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=print|title=Software That Tracks E-Mail Is Raising Privacy Concerns|author=Amy Harmon|publisher=The New York Times|date=2000-11-22|accessdate=2012-01-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://email.about.com/od/emailbehindthescenes/a/html_return_rcp.htm |title=About.com |publisher=Email.about.com |date=2013-12-19 |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webdevelopersnotes.com/tips/yahoo/notification-when-yahoo-email-is-opened.php |title=Webdevelopersnotes.com |publisher=Webdevelopersnotes.com |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref> and only work with e-mail clients that support rendering of HTML.

==U.S. government==
The U.S. state and federal governments have been involved in electronic messaging and the development of email in several different ways.

Starting in 1977, the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) recognized that electronic messaging and electronic transactions posed a significant threat to First Class mail volumes and revenue. The USPS explored an electronic messaging initiative in 1977 and later disbanded it. Twenty years later, in 1997, when email volume overtook postal mail volume, the USPS was again urged to embrace email, and the USPS declined to provide email as a service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1780716/can-technology-save-us-postal-service|title=Can Technology Save The U.S. Postal Service?|work=Fast Company}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V131/N60/emaillab.html|title=Can an MIT professor save the USPS? - The Tech|work=mit.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fedtechmagazine.com/article/2013/01/why-united-states-postal-service-taking-cues-silicon-valley|title=Why the USPS Is Taking Cues from Silicon Valley|work=FedTech}}</ref> The USPS initiated an experimental email service known as [[E-COM]]. E-COM provided a method for the simple exchange of text messages. In 2011, shortly after the USPS reported its state of financial bankruptcy, the USPS Office of Inspector General (OIG) began exploring the possibilities of generating revenue through email servicing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cmsw.mit.edu/usps-can-save-itself/|title=Shiva Ayyadurai: USPS can save itself|work=MIT Comparative Media Studies/Writing}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2012/01/13/could-email-save-snail-mail-or-is-the-internet-too-reliant-on-the-usps/|title=Could Email Save Snail Mail, Or Is The Internet Too Reliant on the USPS?|date=6 March 2012|work=BostInno}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/2012/03/02/dear-usps/V4GJ8w9UCcfV4v0WiVjvmK/story.html|title=‘Dear USPS . . .’|work=BostonGlobe.com}}</ref> Electronic messages were transmitted to a post office, printed out, and delivered as hard copy. To take advantage of the service, an individual had to transmit at least 200 messages. The delivery time of the messages was the same as First Class mail and cost 26 cents. Both the [[Postal Regulatory Commission]] and the [[Federal Communications Commission]] opposed E-COM. The FCC concluded that E-COM constituted common carriage under its jurisdiction and the USPS would have to file a [[tariff]].<ref>In re Request for declaratory ruling and investigation by Graphnet Systems, Inc., concerning the proposed E-COM service, FCC Docket No. 79-6 (September 4, 1979)</ref> Three years after initiating the service, USPS canceled E-COM and attempted to sell it off.<ref>[http://icubes.in/blog/resources/history-of-the-united-states-postal-service-usps/ History of the United States Postal Service, USPS], 13 November 2014</ref><ref>Hardy, Ian R; [https://archive.org/web/*/http:/www.ifla.org/documents/internet/hari1.txt The Evolution of ARPANET Email]; 1996-05-13; History Thesis Paper; University of California at Berkeley</ref><ref>James Bovard, The Law Dinosaur: The US Postal Service, CATO Policy Analysis (February 1985)</ref><ref name="JayAkkad">{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~almeroth/classes/F04.176A/homework1_good_papers/jay-akkad.html |title=Jay Akkad, The History of Email |publisher=Cs.ucsb.edu |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/2000/gg00188.pdf |title=US Postal Service: Postal Activities and Laws Related to Electronic Commerce, GAO-00-188 |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/ota/Ota_4/DATA/1982/8214.PDF |title=Implications of Electronic Mail and Message Systems for the U.S. Postal Service , Office of Technology Assessment, Congress of the United States, August 1982 |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref>

The early ARPANET dealt with multiple email clients that had various, and at times incompatible, formats. For example, in the [[Multics]], the "@" sign meant "kill line" and anything before the "@" sign was ignored, so Multics users had to use a command-line option to specify the destination system.<ref name="thvv"/> The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] [[DARPA]] desired to have uniformity and interoperability for email and therefore funded efforts to drive towards unified inter-operable standards. This led to David Crocker, John Vittal, Kenneth Pogran, and [[Austin Henderson]] publishing RFC 733, "Standard for the Format of ARPA Network Text Message" (November 21, 1977), a subset of which provided a stable base for common use on the ARPANET, but which was not fully effective, and in 1979, a meeting was held at BBN to resolve incompatibility issues. [[Jon Postel]] recounted the meeting in RFC 808, "Summary of Computer Mail Services Meeting Held at BBN on 10 January 1979" (March 1, 1982), which includes an appendix listing the varying email systems at the time. This, in turn, led to the release of David Crocker's RFC 822, "Standard for the Format of ARPA Internet Text Messages" (August 13, 1982).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livinginternet.com/e/ei.htm |title=Email History, How Email was Invented, Living Internet |publisher=Livinginternet.com |date=1996-05-13 |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref> RFC 822 is a small adaptation of RFC 733's details, notably enhancing the [[host (network)|host]] portion, to use [[Domain Name]]s, that were being developed at the same time.

The [[National Science Foundation]] took over operations of the ARPANET and Internet from the Department of Defense, and initiated [[NSFNet]], a new [[backbone network|backbone]] for the network. A part of the NSFNet AUP forbade commercial traffic.<ref>{{cite web|author=Robert Cannon |url=http://www.cybertelecom.org/notes/internet_history80s.htm |title=Internet History |publisher=Cybertelecom |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref> In 1988, [[Vint Cerf]] arranged for an interconnection of [[MCI Mail]] with NSFNET on an experimental basis. The following year [[Compuserve]] email interconnected with NSFNET. Within a few years the commercial traffic restriction was removed from NSFNETs AUP, and NSFNET was privatised.

In the late 1990s, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] grew concerned with fraud transpiring in email, and initiated a series of procedures on spam, fraud, and phishing.<ref>[http://www.cybertelecom.org/spam/Spamref.htm Cybertelecom : SPAM Reference] {{wayback|url=http://www.cybertelecom.org/spam/Spamref.htm |date=20140919090804 }}</ref> In 2004, FTC jurisdiction over spam was codified into law in the form of the [[Can Spam Act|CAN SPAM Act.]]<ref>{{cite web|author=Robert Cannon |url=http://www.cybertelecom.org/spam/canspam.htm |title=Can Spam Act |publisher=Cybertelecom |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref> Several other U.S. federal agencies have also exercised jurisdiction including the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] and the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]].

NASA has provided email capabilities to astronauts aboard the Space Shuttle and International Space Station since 1991 when a [[Macintosh Portable]] was used aboard [[Space Shuttle]] mission [[STS-43]] to send the first email via [[AppleLink]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cowing |first=Keith |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewnews.html?id=213 |title=2001: A Space Laptop &#124; SpaceRef – Your Space Reference |publisher=Spaceref.com |date=2000-09-18 |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macobserver.com/columns/thisweek/2004/20040831.shtml |title=The Mac Observer – This Week in Apple History – August 22–31: "Welcome, IBM.
