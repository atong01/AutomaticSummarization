The number of Praetors elected varied through history, generally increasing with time. During the republic, six or eight were generally elected each year to serve judicial functions throughout Rome and other governmental responsibilities. In the absence of the Consuls, a Praetor would be given command of the garrison in Rome or in Italy. Also, a Praetor could exercise the functions of the Consuls throughout Rome, but their main function was that of a judge. They would preside over trials involving criminal acts as well as grant court orders or validate &quot;illegal&quot; acts as acts of administering justice. As a Praetor, a magistrate was escorted by six lictors, and wielded<space/><link><target>imperium</target></link>. After a term as Praetor, the magistrate would serve as a provincial governor in the office of Propraetor, wielding Propraetor imperium, commanding the provinces legions, and possessing ultimate authority within his province(s).<extension extension_name='ref'>Jo-Ann Shelton, As the Romans did: a sourcebook in Roman Social History.

The first was the Praetor Peregrinus, who was the chief judge in trials involving one or more foreigners. The other was the Praetor Urbanus, the chief judicial office in Rome. He had the power to overturn any verdict by any other courts, and served as judge in cases involving criminal charges against provincial governors. The Praetor Urbanus was not allowed to leave the city for more than ten days.

Consuls were responsible for the city's political agenda, commanded large-scale armies and controlled important provinces.

They also were the supreme commanders in the Roman army, with each being granted two legions during their consular year. Consuls also exercised the highest juridical power in the Republic, being the only office with the power to override the decisions of the Praetor Urbanus. Only laws and the decrees of the Senate or the People's assembly limited their powers, and only the veto of a fellow consul or a tribune of the plebs could supersede their decisions.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">July 2012</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>A consul was escorted by twelve lictors, owned imperium and wore the toga praetexta. Because the consul was the highest executive office within the Republic, they had the power to veto any action or proposal by any other magistrate, save that of the Tribune of the Plebs. After a consulship, a consul was assigned one of the more important provinces and acted as the governor in the same way that a<space/><link><target>Propraetor</target></link><space/>did, only owning Proconsular imperium.

These Propraetors and Proconsuls held near autocratic authority within their selected province or provinces. Because each governor held equal imperium to the equivalent magistrate, they were escorted by the same number of lictors (12) and could only be vetoed by a reigning Consul or Praetor.

This was the only office in the Roman Republic whose term was a period of eighteen months instead of the usual twelve. Censors were elected every five years and although the office held no military imperium, it was considered a great honour. The censors took a regular census of the people and then apportioned the citizens into voting classes on the basis of income and tribal affiliation. The censors enrolled new citizens in tribes and voting classes as well. The censors were also in charge of the membership roll of the Senate, every five years adding new senators who had been elected to the requisite offices. Censors could also remove unworthy members from the Senate. This ability was lost during the dictatorship of Sulla. Censors were also responsible for construction of public buildings and the moral status of the city.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">July 2012</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Censors also had financial duties, in that they had to put out to tender projects that were to be financed by the state.

The Tribune was an office first created to protect the right of the common man in Roman politics and served as the head of the<space/><link><target>Plebeian Council</target></link>. In the mid-to-late Republic, however, plebeians were often just as, and sometimes more, wealthy and powerful than patricians. Those who held the office were granted<space/><link><target>sacrosanctity</target></link><space/>(the right to be legally protected from any physical harm), the power to rescue any plebeian from the hands of a patrician magistrate, and the right to veto any act or proposal of any magistrate, including another tribune of the people and the consuls. The tribune also had the power to exercise capital punishment against any person who interfered in the performance of his duties. The tribunes could even convene a Senate meeting and lay legislation before it and arrest magistrates. Their houses had to remain open for visitors even during the night, and they were not allowed to be more than a day's journey from Rome. Due to their unique power of sacrosanctity, the Tribune had no need for lictors for protection and owned no imperium, nor could they wear the toga praetexta.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">July 2012</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>Princeps senatus</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Princeps senatus</arg></template>Another office not officially a step in the<space/><italics>cursus honorum</italics><space/>was the<space/><italics>princeps senatus</italics>, an extremely prestigious office for a patrician. The<space/><italics>princeps senatus</italics><space/>served as the leader of the Senate and was chosen to serve a five-year term by each pair of Censors every five years. Censors could, however, confirm a<space/><italics>princeps senatus</italics><space/>for a period of another five years. The<space/><italics>princeps senatus</italics><space/>was chosen from all Patricians who had served as a Consul, with former Censors usually holding the office. The office originally granted the holder the ability to speak first at session on the topic presented by the presiding magistrate, but eventually gained the power to open and close the senate sessions, decide the agenda, decide where the session should take place, impose order and other rules of the session, meet in the name of the senate with embassies of foreign countries, and write in the name of the senate letters and dispatches.

In times of emergencies, the Senate would declare that a dictator was required, and the current consuls would appoint a dictator. This was the only decision that could not be vetoed by the Tribune of the Plebs. The dictator was the sole exception to the Roman legal principles of having multiple magistrates in the same office and being legally able to be held to answer for actions in office. Essentially by definition, only one dictator could serve at a time, and no dictator could ever be held legally responsible for any action during his time in office for any reason.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">July 2012</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>The dictator was the highest magistrate in degree of imperium and was attended by twenty-four lictors (as were the former Kings of Rome). Although his term lasted only six months instead of twelve (except for the Dictatorships of Sulla and<space/><link><target>Julius Caesar</target><part>Caesar</part></link>), all other magistrates reported to the dictator (except for the tribunes of the plebs - although they could not veto any of the dictator's acts), granting the dictator absolute authority in both civil and military matters throughout the Republic. The Dictator was free from the control of the Senate in all that he did, could execute anyone without a trial for any reason, and could ignore any law in the performance of his duties. The Dictator was the sole magistrate under the Republic that was truly independent in discharging his duties. All of the other offices were extensions of the Senate's executive authority and thus answerable to the Senate. Since the Dictator exercised his own authority, he did not suffer this limitation, which was the cornerstone of the office's power.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">July 2012</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>When a Dictator entered office, he appointed to serve as his second-in-command a<space/><italics>magister equitum</italics>, the Master of the Horse, whose office ceased to exist once the Dictator left office. The magister equitum held Praetorian imperium, was attended by six lictors, and was charged with assisting the Dictator in managing the State. When the Dictator was away from Rome, the magister equitum usually remained behind to administer the city. The magister equitum, like the Dictator, had unchallengeable authority in all civil and military affairs, with his decisions only being overturned by the Dictator himself.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">July 2012</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>The Dictatorship was definitively abolished in 44 BC after the assassination of Gaius Julius Caesar (<link><target>Lex Antonia</target></link>).</paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Career</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>List of topics related to ancient Rome</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Political institutions of Rome</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Constitution of the Roman Republic</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Roman Empire</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Roman Republic</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Roman Senate</target></link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>Reflist</target></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>External links</heading><paragraph><template><target>Commons category</target><arg>Cursus honorum inscriptions</arg></template></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><link type='external' href='http://www.vroma.org/~bmcmanus/romangvt.html'>Diagram of the ''cursus honorum''</link></listitem><listitem><link type='external' href='http://www.livius.org/ct-cz/cursus/cursus_honorum.html'>Livius.org: Cursus honorum</link></listitem></list><paragraph><template><target>Ancient Rome topics</target></template><template><target>Italic title</target></template></paragraph><paragraph>|</paragraph><paragraph><template><target>DEFAULTSORT:Cursus Honorum</target></template><link><target>Category:Ancient Roman government</target></link><link><target>Category:Roman law</target></link><link><target>Category:Cursus honorum</target></link></paragraph></article>
