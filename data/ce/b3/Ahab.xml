The first encounter is with<space/><link><target>Elijah</target></link>, whom Ahab refers to as &quot;the troubler of Israel&quot; (1 Kings 18:17), in which Elijah predicts a drought (1 Kings 17:1). This encounter ends with Elijah victorious over the official<space/><link><target>Baal</target></link><space/>prophets of Israel in a contest held for the sake of the Israelites and their king, Ahab. The contest ends when Elijah's God consumes the offering which the Baal worshipers could not induce their god to touch, after which Elijah slaughters the Baal prophets (1 Kings 18:1740). The second encounter is between Ahab and an unnamed prophet in 1 Kings 20:22. The third is again between Ahab and an unnamed prophet who condemns Ahab for his actions in a battle that had just taken place (1 Kings 20:34-43). The fourth is when Elijah confronts Ahab over Ahab's and Jezebel's execution of<space/><link><target>Naboth</target></link><space/>and usurpation of the latter's ancestral vineyard (1 Kings 21,1-16). Upon the prophet's remonstration (&quot;Hast thou killed and also taken possession?&quot; (1 Kings, 21,19)), Ahab displayed sincere remorse (1 Kings 21,27). The fifth encounter is with<space/><link><target>Micaiah</target></link>, the prophet who, when asked for advice on a military campaign, first assures Ahab he will be successful and ultimately gives Ahab a glimpse into God's plan for Ahab to die in battle (1 Kings 22).<extension extension_name='ref'>Achtemeier, Paul (Editor), The HarperCollins Bible Dictionary, (New York: HarperCollins, 1996), p. 18.</extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Death of Ahab</heading><paragraph>Three years later, war broke out east of the<space/><link><target>Jordan River</target></link>, and Ahab with Jehoshaphat of Judah went to recover<space/><link><target>Battle of Ramoth-Gilead</target><part>Ramoth-Gilead</part></link>. During this battle Ahab disguised himself, but was mortally wounded by an unaimed arrow (1 Kings 22). The Hebrew Bible says that dogs licked his blood, according to the prophecy of Elijah. But the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Old Testament) adds that &quot;pigs&quot; also licked his blood, symbolically making him unclean to the Israelites, who abstained from pork.

This reign is one which faces opposition from several prophets of<space/><link><target>Yahweh</target></link><space/>throughout as well as various consequences because of his marriage to Jezebel, because of his worship of Baal, disobedience to prophetic warnings and words, and also because of the murder of Naboth. The murder of<space/><link><target>Naboth</target></link><space/>(see<space/><link><target>Jezebel (biblical)</target><part>Jezebel</part></link>), an act of royal encroachment, stirred up popular resentment just as the new cult aroused the opposition of the Israelite prophets, including Elijah and Micaiah. Indeed, he is referred to, for this and other things, as being &quot;more evil than all the kings before him&quot; (1 Kings 16:30). The followers of Yahweh found their champion in Elijah; his denunciation of the royal dynasty of Israel and his emphatic insistence on the worship of Yahweh and Yahweh alone, illustrated by the contest between Yahweh and Baal on<space/><link><target>Mount Carmel</target></link><space/>(1 Kings 18), form the keynote to a period which culminated in the accession of<space/><link><target>Jehu</target></link>, an event in which Elijah's chosen disciple<space/><link><target>Elisha</target></link><space/>was the leading figure.</paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Captain Ahab</target></link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>reflist</target></template></paragraph><list type='def'><listitem><defkey>Attribution</defkey></listitem></list><list type='bullet'><listitem><template><target>EB1911</target><arg name="wstitle">Ahab</arg></template></listitem></list><heading level='2'>External links</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link type='external' href='http://www.archaeowiki.org/Ahab'>Ahab</link>Archaeowiki.org</listitem></list><paragraph><template><target>s-start</target></template><template><target>s-hou</target><arg>[[Omrides|House of Omri]]</arg></template><template><target>s-bef</target><arg name="before">[[Omri (King of Israel)|Omri]]</arg></template><template><target>s-ttl</target><arg name="title">[[Kings of Israel (Samaria)#Royal Houses of Israel|King of Israel]]</arg><arg name="years">874–853 BC</arg></template><template><target>s-aft</target><arg name="after">[[Ahaziah of Israel|Ahaziah]]</arg></template><template><target>s-end</target></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>IsraeliteKings</target><arg name="collapsed">yes</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>Authority control</target></template><link><target>Category:850s BC deaths</target></link><link><target>Category:9th-century BC biblical rulers</target></link><link><target>Category:Deaths by arrow wounds</target></link><link><target>Category:Kings of ancient Israel</target></link><link><target>Category:Year of birth unknown</target></link><link><target>Category:Monarchs killed in action</target></link><link><target>Category:9th-century BC Hebrew people</target></link></paragraph></article>
