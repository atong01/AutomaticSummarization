This ambiguous terminology is usually clarified by context. To refer explicitly to the technical meaning of &quot;at bat&quot; described above, the term &quot;official at bat&quot; is sometimes used.</paragraph><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>Reflist</target></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Batting order (baseball)</target><part>Batting order</part></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>At bats with runners in scoring position</target></link></listitem></list><paragraph><template><target>Baseball</target></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>DEFAULTSORT:At Bat</target></template><link><target>Category:Baseball statistics</target></link><link><target>Category:Batting (baseball)</target></link></paragraph></article>
