'''Anguilla''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|ŋ|ˈ|ɡ|w|ɪ|l|ə}} {{respell|ang|GWIL|ə}}) is a [[British Overseas Territories|British overseas territory]] in the [[Caribbean]].<ref name="Introduction ::Anguilla">{{cite web|title=Introduction ::Anguilla|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/av.html}}</ref> It is one of the most northerly of the [[Leeward Islands]] in the [[Lesser Antilles]], lying east of [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Virgin Islands]] and directly north of [[Saint Martin]]. The territory consists of the main island of Anguilla itself, approximately 16 miles (26&nbsp;km) long by 3 miles (5&nbsp;km) wide at its widest point, together with a number of much smaller islands and [[cay]]s with no permanent population. The island's capital is [[The Valley, Anguilla|The Valley]]. The total land area of the territory is 35 square miles (90&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>),<ref name="facts">{{cite web|title=Anguilla Facts|url=http://www.gov.ai/anguillafacts.php|publisher=Government of Anguilla|accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref> with a population of approximately 13,500 (2006 estimate).

Anguilla has become a popular [[tax haven]], having no capital gains, estate, profit or other forms of direct taxation on either individuals or corporations. In April 2011, faced with a mounting deficit, it introduced a 3% "Interim Stabilisation Levy", Anguilla's first form of [[income tax]].<ref>{{cite web|author=KPMG |url=http://www.kpmg.com/global/en/issuesandinsights/articlespublications/taxation-international-executives/anguilla/pages/default.aspx|title=Tax TIES: Anguilla - Overview and introduction |publisher=KPMG |date= |accessdate=2011-04-01}}</ref>

{{anchor|Etymology}}

== Name ==
The name Anguilla is an [[Anglicization of names|anglicised]] or [[Latinization of names|latinate]] form of earlier [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''{{lang|es|anguila}}'', [[French language|French]] ''{{lang|fr|anguille}}'', or [[Italian language|Italian]] ''{{lang|it|anguilla}}'', all meaning "[[eel]]" in reference to the island's shape.{{sfnp|Martin|1839}} For similar reasons, it was formerly known as '''Snake''' or '''Snake Island'''.{{sfnp|Martin|1839}}{{sfnp|EB|1878}}{{sfnp|EB|1911}}

== History ==
{{Main|History of Anguilla}}
[[File:Wallblake House, The Valley.jpg|thumb|[[Wallblake House]]]]
Anguilla was first settled by [[Amerindian]] tribes who migrated from South America. The earliest Native American artefacts found on Anguilla have been dated to around 1300&nbsp;{{sc|bc}}; remains of settlements date from {{sc|ad}}&nbsp;600.<ref>''Caribbean Islands'', Sarah Cameron (Footprint Travel Guides), p. 466 ([https://books.google.com/?id=G74-rZzX64cC Google Books])</ref> The [[Arawak]] name for the island seems to have been '''Malliouhana'''. The date of European invasion and colonisation is uncertain: some sources claim that [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] sighted the island during his second voyage in 1493, while others state that the island was first "discovered" (for colonisation) by the [[Kingdom of France|French]] explorer [[René Goulaine de Laudonnière]] in 1564.<ref name=gov>{{citation |contribution=Anguilla's History |contribution-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813051037/http://gov.ai/elections/anguillahistory.htm |publisher=Government of Anguilla |title=The Anguilla House of Assembly Elections<!--sic--> |date=2007 |accessdate=9 June 2015 }}.</ref>

Traditional accounts state that Anguilla was first colonised by [[Kingdom of England|English]] settlers from [[Saint Kitts]] beginning in 1650.{{sfnp|Martin|1839}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Historical Geography of the British Colonies: The West Indies|author=Charles Prestwood Lucas|page=143|isbn=978-1-4590-0868-7|publisher=General Books LLC|year=2009}}</ref> In this early colonial period, however, Anguilla sometimes served as a place of refuge and recent scholarship focused on Anguilla has placed greater significance on other Europeans and [[creole peoples|creoles]] migrating from [[St. Kitts|St. Christopher]],<ref>Cooper, V.O. 1998. St. Kitts:  The Launching Pad for Leeward Islands Creoles. In St. Kitts and the Atlantic Creoles, the Texts of Samuel Augustus Mathews in Perspective, P. Baker and A. Bruyn (eds.). London:  University of Westminster Press.</ref> [[Barbados]], [[Nevis]] and [[Antigua]]. The French temporarily took over the island in 1666 but returned it to English control under the terms of the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]] the next year. A Major John Scott who visited in September, 1667, wrote of leaving the island "in good condition" and noted that in July, 1668, "200 or 300 people fled thither in time of war."<ref>British Colonial and State Papers 1661-1668, 16 November 1667 and 9 July 1668.</ref>

It is likely that some of these early Europeans brought enslaved Africans with them. Historians confirm that [[Atlantic slave trade|African slaves]] lived in the region in the early 17th century. For example, Africans from [[Senegal]] lived in St. Christopher in 1626. By 1672 a slave depot existed on the island of Nevis, serving the [[Leeward Islands]]. While the time of African arrival in Anguilla is difficult to place precisely, archival evidence indicates a substantial African presence of at least 100 slaves by 1683. These seem to have come from Central Africa as well as West Africa.<ref name="Walicek, Don E 2009. pp. 349-372">Walicek, Don E.  2009.  "The Founder Principle and Anguilla's Homestead Society," Gradual Creolization: Studies Celebrating Jacques Arends, ed. by M. van den Berg, H. Cardoso, and R. Selbach.  (Creole Language Library Series 34), Amsterdam: John Benjamins, pp. 349-372.</ref>

Attempts by the French to capture the island during the [[War of Austrian Succession]] ([[Battle of Anguilla|1745]]) and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1796) ended in failure.<ref name=gov/>

During the early colonial period, Anguilla was administered by the British through Antigua; in 1825, it was placed under the administrative control of nearby Saint Kitts.<ref name=gov/> In 1967, Britain granted Saint Kitts and [[Nevis]] full internal autonomy. Anguilla was also incorporated into the new unified dependency, named [[Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla]], against the wishes of many Anguillians. This led to two Anguillian Revolutions in 1967 and 1969 headed by [[Ronald Webster]]. The island briefly operated as the independent "[[Republic of Anguilla]]". The goal of the revolution was not independence per se, but rather independence from Saint Kitts and Nevis and a return to being a British colony.  British authority was fully restored in July 1971 and in 1980 Anguilla was finally allowed to secede from Saint Kitts and Nevis and become a separate British [[Crown colony]] (now a [[British overseas territory]]).<ref name="Introduction ::Anguilla"/>

== Governance ==
[[File:EU OCT and OMR map en.png|thumb|right|Map of the European Union in the world with overseas countries and territories and outermost regions]]

===Political system===
{{Main|Politics of Anguilla}}
{{See also|Law of Anguilla}}
Anguilla is an internally self-governing [[British overseas territory|overseas territory]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. Its politics take place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[Dependent territory|dependency]], whereby the [[Chief Minister]] is the [[head of government]], and of a [[wikt:pluriform|pluriform]] multi-party system.

The [[United Nations Committee on Decolonization]] includes Anguilla on the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]]. The territory's constitution is Anguilla Constitutional Order 1 April 1982 (amended 1990). [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[Anguilla House of Assembly|House of Assembly]]. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. {{clear left}}

===Defence===
Anguilla being a dependency of the UK, the UK is responsible for its military defence, although there are no active [[garrison]] or armed forces present. Anguilla has a small [[marine police]] force, comprising around 32 personnel, which operates one M160-class fast [[patrol boat]].

== Population ==

=== Demographics ===
{{Main|Demographics of Anguilla}}
The majority of residents (90.08%) are black, the descendants of slaves transported from Africa. Growing minorities include whites at 3.74% and people of mixed race at 4.65% (figures from 2001 census).

72% of the population is Anguillian while 28% is non-Anguillian (2001 census). Of the non-Anguillian population, many are citizens of the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[St Kitts & Nevis]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Nigeria]].

2006 and 2007 saw an influx of large numbers of [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[India]]n and [[Mexican people|Mexican]] workers, brought in as labour for major tourist developments due to the local population not being large enough to support the labour requirements.

=== Religion ===
Christian churches did not have a consistent or strong presence during the initial period of English colonisation. Spiritual and religious practices of Europeans and Africans tended to reflect their regional origins. As early as 1813, Christian ministers formally ministered to enslaved Africans and promoted literacy in English among converts.<ref>Walicek, Don E. 2011. "Christianity, Literacy, and Creolization in Nineteenth-Century Anguilla." In Anansi's Defiant Webs, Contact, Continuity, Convergence, and Complexity in the Language, Literatures and Cultures of the Greater Caribbean, ed. by N. Faraclas, R. Severing, et al. Willemstad: University of Curaçao and Fundashon pa Planifikashon di Idioma, pp. 181-189.</ref> The [[Wesleyan]] (Methodist) [[Missionary Society of England]] built churches and schools in 1817.<ref>Hodge, S. Wilfred (2003). Bethel- the road - and due west. In Wilbert Forker (Ed.), Born in slavery: A story of Methodism in Anguilla and its influence in the Caribbean (pp. 20-29). Edinburgh: Dunedin Academic Press.</ref>

According to the 2001 census, [[Christianity]] is Anguilla's predominant religion, with 29.0 percent of the population practising [[Anglicanism]]. Another 23.9 percent are [[Methodist]]. Other churches on the island include [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]], [[Baptist]], [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] (served by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint John's - Basseterre]], with see at Saint John on [[Antigua and Barbuda]]) and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (0.7%).<ref name="statistics census">{{cite web|url=http://gov.ai/statistics/census/Demography%20&%20Culture%20tables.htm|title=Persons by Religion, Census 1992 and 2001 (Table 14)|publisher=Statistics Department of Anguilla|accessdate=2008-04-16}}</ref> Between 1992 and 2001 the number of followers of the [[Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee)|Church of God]] and [[Pentecostal Churches]] increased considerably. There are at least 15 churches on the island, several of architectural interest. Although a minority on the island, it is an important location to followers of [[Rastafari movement|Rastafarian]] religion – Anguilla is the birthplace of [[Robert Athlyi Rogers]], author of [[Holy Piby|The Holy Piby]] which has had a strong influence on Rastafarian beliefs. Various other religions are practised as well.<ref name="statistics census"/>

=== Languages ===
{{Main|Anguillian Creole}}
[[File:Sandy Ground Anguilla.jpg|thumb|Overlooking [[Sandy Ground, Anguilla|Sandy Ground]], Anguilla]]
Today most people in Anguilla speak a British-influenced variety of "Standard" English. Other languages are also spoken on the island, including varieties of Spanish, Chinese and the languages of other immigrants. However, the most common language other than Standard English is the island's own English-lexifier Creole language (not to be confused with [[Antillean Creole]] ('French Creole'), spoken in (ex-)French islands such as [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]]). It is referred to locally by terms such as "dialect" (pronounced "dialek"), Anguilla Talk or "Anguillian". It has its main roots in early varieties of English and West African languages, and is similar to the dialects spoken in English-speaking islands throughout the Eastern Caribbean, in terms of its structural features and to the extent of being considered one single language.<ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=aig Ethnologue report for language code: aig]</ref>

Linguists who are interested in the origins of Anguillian and other Caribbean Creoles point out that some of its grammatical features can be traced to African languages while others can be traced to European languages. Three areas have been identified as significant for the identification of the linguistic origins of those forced migrants who arrived before 1710: the [[Gold Coast (region)|Slave Coast]], the [[Slave Coast]] and the Windward Coast.<ref>Singler, John. 1993. African influence upon Afro-American language varieties: A consideration of sociohistorical factors.  In Africanisms in Afro-American language varieties, S. Mufwene and n. Condon (eds.), 235-253.  Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press.</ref>

Sociohistorical information from Anguilla's archives suggest that Africans and Europeans formed two distinct, but perhaps overlapping speech communities in the early phases of the island's colonisation. "Anguillian" is believed to have emerged as the language of the masses as time passed, slavery was abolished and locals began to see themselves as "belonging" to Anguillian society.<ref name="Walicek, Don E 2009. pp. 349-372"/>

== Culture ==
[[File:Cap Juluca - Anguilla.jpg|thumb|right|The beach at the Cap Juluca resort on Maundays Bay]]
[[File:Anguilla-Island Harbour.jpg|thumb|right|Island Harbour]]
The [[Anguilla National Trust]] (ANT) was established in 1988 and opened its offices in 1993 charged with the responsibility of preserving the heritage of the island, including its cultural heritage. The Trust has programmes encouraging Anguillian writers and the preservation of the island's history. In 2015, ''Where I See The Sun – Contemporary Poetry in Anguilla'' A New Anthology by [[Lasana M. Sekou]] was published by House of Nehesi Publishers.<ref>http://theanguillian.com/2015/05/where-i-see-the-sun-anthology-available-in-anguilla/</ref> Among the forty three poets in the unprecedented collection are Rita Celestine-Carty, [[Bankie Banx]], John T. Harrigan, Patricia J. Adams, Fabian Fahie, Dr. Oluwakemi Linda Banks, and Reuel Ben Lewi.<ref>http://soualiganewsday.com/local/soualiga-newsday-features/item/3890-think-and-know-where-i-see-the-sun-–-contemporary-poetry-in-anguilla.html</ref>

The island's cultural history begins with the [[Taíno people|Taino]] Indians. Artifacts have been found around the island, telling of life before European settlers arrived.

As throughout the [[Caribbean]], holidays are a cultural fixture. Anguilla's most important holidays are of historic as much as cultural importance – particularly the anniversary of the emancipation (previously August Monday in the Park), celebrated as the Summer Festival. [[United Kingdom|British]] festivities, such as the [[Queen's Official Birthday|Queen's birthday]], are also celebrated.

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Anguillian cuisine}}
Anguillian cuisine is influenced by native Caribbean, African, Spanish, French and English cuisines.<ref name="UsaToday">Robinson, Peg.

Due to its internationally recognised culinary community, the island has enjoyed a reputation as "the culinary capital of the Caribbean." This reputation was reinforced with the publication of the '''''(WE) Are Anguilla Cookbook,''''' a guide to the cuisine of Anguilla featuring emerging and established local chefs, who share both their signature dishes and personal anecdotes regarding the island’s epicurean culture. A publishing contract was secured by The Britto Agency, which had conceived the idea for the book itself.

=== Music ===
{{Main|Music of Anguilla}}

The island's burgeoning musical community made history with the recording of '''Sounds of Anguilla (Volume 1)'', '''''the first album ever comprised solely of artists from a single Caribbean island representing multiple musical genres: pop, [[reggae]], hip-hop, [[soca music]] and R&B. The production was the brainchild of [[Marvet Britto]] of the Britto Agency, the island's global public relations and brand-architecture firm. Britto secured a recording contract with Massenburg and both served as executive producers along with Haydn Hughes, at that time the Parliamentary Secretary Responsible for Tourism'''''. ''Sounds of Anguilla (Volume 1)''' debuted on iTunes on June 30, 2015 and included celebrated Anguillian musicians such as [[Bankie Banx]], Amalia Watty, True Intentions and Gerswin Lake and The Parables.

=== Education ===
{{main|Saint James School of Medicine}}

A branch of the [[Saint James School of Medicine]] was established in 2011 in Anguilla,<ref>{{cite news|title=Saint James Medical School Officially Opened|url=http://www.festival.ai/article/view/10024/1/135|work=The Anguillian|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331160505/http://www.festival.ai/article/view/10024/1/135|archivedate=9 January 2015}}</ref> It is a [[private university|private]], [[For-profit school|for-profit]] medical school headquartered in [[Park Ridge, Illinois|Park Ridge]], [[Illinois]].

=== Sports ===
[[File:Sailing-in-anguilla.jpg|thumb|right|A modern [[square rigger]] viewed from Long Bay]]
{{See also|Sailing in Anguilla|Cricket in the West Indies|Rugby union in Anguilla}}
[[Boat racing]] has deep roots in Anguillian culture and is the [[national sport]].
 
There are regular sailing [[regattas]] on national holidays, such as Carnival, which are contested by locally built and designed boats. These boats have names and have sponsors that print their logo on their sails.

As in many other former [[British Colony|British Colonies]], [[cricket]] is also a popular sport. Anguilla is the home of [[Omari Banks]], who played for the [[West Indies Cricket Team]], while [[Cardigan Connor]] played first-class cricket for English county side [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] and was 'chef de mission' (team manager) for Anguilla's [[Commonwealth Games]] team in 2002.

[[Rugby union]] is represented in Anguilla by the Anguilla Eels RFC, who were formed in April 2006.<ref>[http://www.news.ai/gl//article.php?story=20060425160749670 Rugby in Anguilla!], Anguilla News</ref> The Eels have been finalists in the St. Martin tournament in November 2006 and semi finalists in 2007, 2008, 2009 and Champions in 2010. The Eels were formed in 2006 by Scottish club national second row Martin Welsh, Club Sponsor and President of the AERFC Ms Jacquie Ruan, and Canadian standout Scrumhalf Mark Harris (Toronto Scottish RFC).

Anguilla is also the home of [[Zharnel Hughes]], who specialises in the 100m and 200m sprint. He won the 100m in the [[2013 CARIFTA Games]] in a time of 10.44 seconds, despite his time being some way below his PB.<ref>[[2013 CARIFTA Games]]</ref>

Anguilla is a flat, low-lying island of [[coral]] and [[limestone]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]], east of [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Virgin Islands]]. It is directly north of [[Saint Martin]], separated from that island by the [[Anguilla Channel]]. The [[soil]] is generally thin and poor, supporting  [[scrubland|scrub]] [[tropical]] and [[forest]] vegetation.

Anguilla is noted for its spectacular and ecologically important [[coral reef]]s and beaches. Apart from the main island of Anguilla itself, the territory includes a number of other smaller islands and [[cays]], mostly tiny and uninhabited. Some of these are:
* [[Anguillita]]
* [[Dog Island, Anguilla|Dog Island]]
* [[Prickly Pear Cays]]

Anguilla's thin arid soil being largely unsuitable for agriculture, the island has few land-based [[natural resources]]. Its main industries are tourism, [[offshore companies|offshore incorporation and management]], [[offshore bank]]ing, [[captive insurance]] and fishing.

Before the 2008 world-wide crisis the economy of Anguilla was expanding rapidly, especially the tourism sector which was driving major new developments in partnerships with multi-national companies.

Anguilla's currency is the [[East Caribbean dollar]], though the [[US dollar]] is also widely accepted. The exchange rate is fixed to the US dollar at US$1 = EC$2.70.

The economy, and especially the tourism sector, suffered a setback in late 1995 due to the effects of [[Hurricane Luis]] in September but recovered in 1996. Hotels were hit particularly hard during this time. Another economic setback occurred during the aftermath of [[Hurricane Lenny]] in 2000.<ref>{{Cite book|title=South America, Central America and the Caribbean 2003|publisher=Routledge|page=52|year=2002|isbn=978-1-85743-138-4|edition=11}}</ref>

Anguilla's financial system comprises 7 banks,<ref>[http://thebanks/banks-by-country/Anguilla List of Banks in Anguilla]</ref> 2 money services businesses, more than 40 company managers, more than 50 insurers, 12 brokers, more than 250 captive intermediaries, more than 50 mutual funds and 8 trust companies.<ref>[http://www.fsc.org.ai/market.shtml Market Participants]</ref>

Anguilla's tourism industry received a major boost when it was selected to host the [[World Travel Awards]] in December 2014. Known as "the Oscars of the travel industry," the awards ceremony was held at the [[CuisinArt Resort and Spa]] and was hosted by award-winning actress [[Vivica A. Fox]]. Anguilla was voted the '''World's Leading Luxury Island Destination''' from a short list of top-tier candidates such as St. Barts, Maldives and Mauritius. The event marked a first in the island's history and was arranged and organised by [[Marvet Britto]] of the Britto Agency, which oversees Global Brand Strategy and Public Relations for the island.

Anguilla aims to obtain 15% of its energy from [[solar power]] so it is less reliant on expensive imported diesel. The [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]] is helping the government gather the information it needs to change the territory's legislation, so it can integrate renewables into its grid. [[Barbados]], have also made good progress in switching to renewables, but many other SIDS are still at the early stages of planning how to integrate renewable energy into their grids. “For a small island we’re very far ahead,” said Beth Barry, Coordinator of the Anguilla Renewable Energy Office. "We’ve got an Energy Policy and a draft Climate Change policy and have been focussing efforts on the question of [[sustainable energy]] supply for several years now. As a result we have a lot of information we can share with other islands.”<ref>Fry, Carolyn. 28 June 2012.
