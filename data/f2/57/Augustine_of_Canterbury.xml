Kent was the dominant power in southeastern Britain. Since the eclipse of King<space/><link><target>Ceawlin of Wessex</target></link><space/>in 592, thelberht was the leading Anglo-Saxon ruler; Bede refers to thelberht as having<space/><link><target>imperium</target></link><space/>(overlordship) south of the<space/><link><target>Humber</target><part>River Humber</part></link>. Trade between the Franks and thelberht's kingdom was well established, and the<space/><link><target>language barrier</target></link><space/>between the two regions was apparently only a minor obstacle, as the interpreters for the mission came from the Franks. Lastly, Kent's proximity to the Franks allowed support from a Christian area.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Brooks7">Brooks<space/><italics>Early History of the Church of Canterbury</italics><space/>pp. 67</extension><space/>There is some evidence, including Gregory's letters to Frankish kings in support of the mission, that some of the Franks felt that they had a claim to overlordship over some of the southern British kingdoms at this time. The presence of a Frankish bishop could also have lent credence to claims of overlordship, if Bertha's Bishop Liudhard was felt to be acting as a representative of the Frankish church and not merely as a spiritual advisor to the queen. Frankish influence was not merely political; archaeological remains attest to a cultural influence as well.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Kirby27">Kirby<space/><italics>Earliest English Kings</italics><space/>p. 27</extension></paragraph><paragraph>In 595, Gregory chose Augustine, who was the prior of the<space/><link><target>San Gregorio Magno al Celio</target><part>Abbey of St Andrew's</part></link><space/>in Rome, to head the mission to Kent.<extension extension_name='ref' name="ASE104"></extension><space/>The pope selected monks to accompany Augustine and sought support from the Frankish royalty and clergy in a series of letters, of which some copies survive in Rome.

Gregory thanked King<space/><link><target>Chlothar II</target></link><space/>of<space/><link><target>Neustria</target></link><space/>for aiding Augustine.
