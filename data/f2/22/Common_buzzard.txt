The '''common buzzard''' (''Buteo buteo'') is a medium-to-large [[bird of prey]], whose range covers most of Europe and extends into Asia. It is usually resident year-round, except in the coldest parts of its range, and in the case of one subspecies.{{dubious|date=January 2014}}{{fix|text=The map shows something else}}

==Description==
The common buzzard measures between {{convert|40|and|58|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length with a {{convert|109|-|136|cm|in|abbr=on}} wingspan and a body mass of {{convert|427|-|1364|g|lb|abbr=on}}, making it a medium-sized [[Bird of prey|raptor]].<ref name=CRC/><ref name=RaptorsWorld/>

This broad-winged raptor has a wide variety of plumages, and in Europe can be confused with the similar [[rough-legged buzzard]] (''Buteo lagopus'') and the only distantly related [[European honey buzzard]] (''Pernis apivorus''), which mimics the common buzzard's plumage for a degree of protection from [[northern goshawk]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The plumage can vary in Britain from almost pure white to black, but is usually shades of brown, with a pale 'necklace' of feathers.

==Systematics==
The common buzzard was first described by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in his [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|Systema naturae]] in 1758 as ''Falco buteo''.<ref name=Linnaeus1758/> Buzzard subspecies fall into two groups.
The western ''Buteo'' group is mainly resident or short-distance [[bird migration|migrants]]. They are:
* ''Buteo buteo buteo'': most of Europe
* ''B. b. rothschildi'': [[Azores]]
* ''B. b. insularum'': [[Canary Islands]]<!-- BirdConservInt14:203 -->
* ''B. b. pojana'': [[Corsica]] and [[Sardinia]]
* ''B. b. menetriesi'': [[Caucasus]]
* ''B. b. harterti'': [[Madeira]], doubtfully distinct from nominate ''buteo''

The eastern ''vulpinus'' group includes
* ''B. b. vulpinus'' ('''steppe buzzard'''): [[Eurasia]]: migrant breeder

==Behavior==

The common buzzard breeds in [[woodland]]s, usually on the fringes, but favours hunting over open land. It eats mainly small [[mammal]]s, and will come to [[carrion]]. A great opportunist, it adapts well to a varied diet of pheasant, rabbit, other small mammals to medium mammals, snakes and lizards, and can often be seen walking over recently ploughed fields looking for worms and insects.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Buzzards do not normally form [[flocks]], but several may be seen together on [[Bird migration|migration]] or in good habitat. The [[Victorian era|Victorian]] writer on [[Dartmoor]], [[William Crossing]], noted he had on occasions seen flocks of 15 or more at some places. Though a rare occurrence, as many as 20 buzzards can be spotted in one field area, approximately {{convert|30|m|ft}} apart, so cannot be classed as a flock in the general sense, consisting of birds without a mate or territory. They are fiercely territorial, and, though rare, fights do break out if one strays onto another pair's territory, but dominant displays of aggression will normally see off the interloper. Pairs mate for life. To attract a mate (or impress his existing mate) the male performs a ritual aerial display before the beginning of spring. This spectacular display is known as 'the roller coaster'. He will rise high up in the sky, to turn and plummet downward, in a spiral, twisting and turning as he comes down. He then rises immediately upward to repeat the exercise.

The call is a plaintive ''peea-ay'', similar to a cat's [[Cat communication#Meow|meow]].

==Status==
In parts of its range it is increasing in numbers. In [[Ireland]] it became extinct about 1910, but began to slowly recolonise the country in the 1950s, and is now a common and familiar sight over much of Ireland.

==Steppe buzzard==
The steppe buzzard, ''B. (b.) vulpinus'' breeds from east Europe{{where|date=February 2014}} eastward to the Far East, excluding Japan. It is a long-distance [[bird migration|migrant]], excepting some north [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] birds, and winters in Africa, India and southeastern Asia. In the open country favoured on the wintering grounds, steppe buzzards are often seen perched on roadside telephone poles.

The steppe buzzard is some times split off as a separate species, ''B. vulpinus''. Compared to the nominate form, it is slightly smaller ({{convert|45|â€“|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} long), longer winged and longer tailed. There are two colour morphs: the rufous form which gives this subspecies its scientific name (''vulpes'' is Latin for "fox"), and a dark grey form.

The tail of ''vulpinus'' is paler than the nominate form, and often quite rufous, recalling North American [[red-tailed hawk]]. The upper wings have pale primary patches, and the primary flight feathers are also paler when viewed from below. Adults have a black trailing edge to the wings, and both morphs often have plain underparts, lacking the breast band frequently seen in ''B. b. buteo''.
