=== Success and hiatus ===
She starred in four films in 2000: ''[[Reindeer Games]]'', ''[[The Yards]]'', ''[[The Legend of Bagger Vance]]'' and ''[[Men of Honor]]'', and was briefly considered a new "[[It girl]]". Theron has said of this period in her career that, "I kept finding myself in a place where directors would back me but studios didn't. [I began] a love affair with directors, the ones I really, truly admired. I found myself making really bad movies, too. ''Reindeer Games'' was not a good movie, but I did it because I loved [[John Frankenheimer]]."<ref>Johnathan Van Meter (October 2004).

Following a three-year hiatus from the big screen, Theron returned to the spotlight in 2011 with ''[[Young Adult (film)|Young Adult]]''. Directed by Jason Reitman, the film earned critical acclaim especially for Theron's performance. She was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] and several other high profile awards. Theron played the [[Queen (Snow White)|Evil Queen Ravenna, Snow White's evil stepmother]], in the film ''[[Snow White & the Huntsman]]'', which began production in 2011 and was released in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/11/charlize-theron-to-play-evil-queen-in-snow-white-and-the-huntsman-_n_807192.html|title=Charlize Theron To Play Evil Queen In 'Snow White And The Huntsman'|work=The Huffington Post}}</ref>

In 2011, she described her process for becoming the characters in her film:
{{quote|When I'm figuring out a character, for me it's easy, since once I say yes to something, I become super-obsessed about it – and I have an obsessive nature in general. How I want to play it starts at that moment. It's a very lonely, internal experience. I think about [the character] all the time – I observe things, I see things and file things [in my head], everything geared to what I'm going to do. I'm obsessed with the human condition. You read the script and become obsessed with [a character's] nature, her habits. When the camera rolls, it's time to do my job, to do the honest truth. You can't do that part of the [character-creation] work when you're [in the middle of] making the film.

The Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project (CTAOP) was created in 2007 by Theron, Academy Award winning actor and UN Messenger of Peace, in an effort to support African youth in the fight against HIV/AIDS. CTAOP's mission is to help keep African youth safe from HIV/AIDS. The project is committed to supporting community-engaged organizations that address the key drivers of the disease. Although the geographic scope of CTAOP is Sub-Saharan Africa, the primary concentration has mostly been Charlize's home country of South Africa. CTAOP's approach is based on the belief that community-based organizations on the ground understand the social and structural relationships of their communities better than anyone. By supporting these organizations through grant giving, networking, and spotlighting their work, CTAOP enables communities to mobilize and empower themselves to prevent HIV.<ref name="CTAOP">{{cite web|url=http://www.charlizeafricaoutreach.org|title=Message from Charlize}}</ref>
