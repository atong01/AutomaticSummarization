Ter-Petrosyan had been elected head of government in 1990, when the<space/><link><target>National Democratic Union of Armenia</target><part>National Democratic Union party</part></link><space/>defeated the Armenian Communist Party. Ter-Petrosyan was re-elected in 1996.

Kocharyan was successful in riding out the unrest. In May 2000,<space/><link><target>Andranik Margaryan</target></link><space/>replaced<space/><link><target>Aram Sargsyan</target></link><space/>as Prime Minister.</paragraph><paragraph>Kocharyan's re-election as president in 2003 was followed by widespread allegations of ballot-rigging. He went on to propose controversial constitutional amendments on the role of parliament. These were rejected in a referendum the following May at the same time as parliamentary elections which left Kocharyan's party in a very powerful position in parliament. There were mounting calls for the President's resignation in early 2004 with thousands of demonstrators taking to the streets in support of demands for a referendum of confidence in him.</paragraph><paragraph>The unicameral parliament (also called the<space/><link><target>National Assembly of Armenia</target><part>National Assembly</part></link>) is dominated by a coalition, called &quot;Unity&quot; (Miasnutyun), between the<space/><link><target>Republican Party of Armenia</target><part>Republican</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>People's Party of Armenia</target><part>Peoples</part></link><space/>Parties and the Agro-Technical Peoples Union, aided by numerous independents.<space/><link><target>Armenian Revolutionary Federation</target><part>Dashnaksutyun</part></link>, which was outlawed by Ter-Petrosyan in 199596 but legalized again after Ter-Petrosyan resigned, also usually supports the government. A new party, the<space/><link><target>Republic (Armenia)</target><part>Republic Party</part></link>, is headed by ex-Prime Minister<space/><link><target>Aram Sargsyan</target></link>, brother of<space/><link><target>Vazgen Sargsyan</target></link>, and has become the primary voice of the opposition, which also includes the<space/><link><target>Armenian Communist Party</target></link>, the<space/><link><target>National Unity (Armenia)</target><part>National Unity party</part></link><space/>of<space/><link><target>Artashes Geghamyan</target></link>, and elements of the former Ter-Petrosyan government.</paragraph><paragraph>The Government of Armenia's stated aim is to build a Western-style<space/><link><target>parliamentary democracy</target></link><space/>as the basis of its<space/><link><target>form of government</target></link>. However, international observers have questioned the fairness of Armenia's parliamentary and presidential elections and constitutional referendum since 1995, citing polling deficiencies, lack of cooperation by the<space/><link><target>Electoral Commission (Armenia)</target><part>Electoral Commission</part></link>, and poor maintenance of electoral lists and polling places. For the most part however, Armenia is considered one of the more pro-democratic nations in the<space/><link><target>Commonwealth of Independent States</target></link>. Observers noted, though, that opposition parties and candidates have been able to mount credible campaigns and proper polling procedures have been generally followed. Elections since 1998 have represented an improvement in terms of both fairness and efficiency, although they are still considered to have fallen short of international standards. The new constitution of 1995 greatly expanded the powers of the executive branch and gives it much more influence over the judiciary and municipal officials.</paragraph><paragraph>The observance of human rights in Armenia is uneven and is marked by shortcomings.<space/><link><target>Police brutality</target></link><space/>allegedly still goes largely unreported, while observers note that defendants are often beaten to extract confessions and are denied visits from relatives and lawyers. Public demonstrations usually take place without government interference, though one rally in November 2000 by an opposition party was followed by the arrest and imprisonment for a month of its organizer. Freedom of religion is not always protected under existing law. Nontraditional churches, especially the<space/><link><target>Jehovah's Witnesses</target></link>, have been subjected to harassment, sometimes violently. All churches apart from the<space/><link><target>Armenian Apostolic Church</target></link><space/>must register with the government, and proselytizing was forbidden by law, though since 1997 the government has pursued more moderate policies. The government's policy toward conscientious objection is in transition, as part of Armenia's accession to the Council of Europe. Most of Armenia's ethnic<space/><link><target>Azeri</target></link><space/>population was deported in 19881989 and remain refugees, largely in Azerbaijan. Armenia's record on discrimination toward the few remaining<space/><link><target>national minorities</target></link><space/>is generally good. The government does not restrict internal or international travel. Although freedom of the press and speech are guaranteed, the government maintains its monopoly over television and radio broadcasting.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Government</heading><paragraph>Armenia became independent from the<space/><link><target>Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic</target></link><space/>on 28 May 1918 as the<space/><link><target>First Republic of Armenia</target></link>.
