Both the B-25A and B-25B series entered AAF service. The B-25B was operational in 1942. Combat requirements lead to further developments. Before the year was over, NAA was producing the B-25C and B-25D series at different plants. Also in 1942, the manufacturer began design work on the cannon-armed B-25G series. The NA-100 of 1943 and 1944 was an interim armament development at the Kansas City complex known as the B-25D2. Similar armament upgrades by U.S-based commercial modification centers involved about half of the B-25G series. Further development led to the B-25H, B-25J and B-25J2. The gunship design concept dates to late 1942 and NAA sent a field technical representative to the SWPA. The factory produced B-25G entered production during the NA-96 order followed by the redesigned B-25H gunship. The B-25J reverted to the bomber role, but it, too, could be outfitted as a strafer (pictured above).</paragraph><paragraph>North American Aviation manufactured the greatest number of aircraft in World War II.

The aircrafts potential as a ground-<link><target>attack aircraft</target></link><space/>emerged. The jungle environment reduced the usefulness of medium-level bombing, and made low-level attack the best tactic. Using similar mast height level tactics and skip bombing, the B-25 proved itself to be a capable anti-shipping weapon and sank many enemy sea vessels of various types. An ever-increasing number of forward firing guns made the B-25 a formidable strafing aircraft for island warfare. The strafer versions were the B-25C1/D1, the B-25J1 and with the NAA strafer nose, the J2 sub-series.</paragraph><paragraph>In Burma, the B-25 was often used to attack Japanese communication links, especially bridges in central Burma. It also helped supply the<space/><link><target>Battle of Imphal</target><part>besieged troops at Imphal</part></link><space/>in 1944. The China Air Task Force, the Chinese American Composite Wing, the First Air Commando Group, the 341st Bomb Group, and eventually, the relocated 12th Bomb Group, all operated the B-25 in the<space/><link><target>China Burma India Theater</target></link><space/>(CBI).

The PBJ had its origin in an inter-service agreement of mid-1942 between the Navy and the USAAF exchanging the Boeing Renton plant for the Kansas plant for B-29 production. The<space/><link><target>Boeing XPBB Sea Ranger</target></link><space/>flying boat competing for B-29 engines, was cancelled in exchange for part of the Kansas City Mitchell production. Other terms included the inter-service transfer of 50 B-25C and 152 B-25D to the Navy. The bombers carried Navy<space/><link><target>bureau number</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>(BuNos), beginning with BuNo 34998. The first PBJ-1 arrived in February 1943 and nearly all reached Marine Corps squadrons, beginning with Marine Bombing Squadron 413 (VMB-413). Following the AAFAC format, the Marine Mitchells had search<space/><link><target>radar</target></link><space/>in a retractable radome replacing the ventral turret. Later D and J series had nose mounted APS-3 radar; and later still, J and H series mounted radar in the starboard wingtip. The large quantities of B-25H and J series became known as PBJ-1H and PBJ-1J respectively. These aircraft often operated along with earlier PBJ series in Marine squadrons.</paragraph><paragraph>The PBJs were operated almost exclusively by the Marine Corps as land-based bombers.

Eight VMB squadrons were flying PBJs by the end of 1943, forming the initial Marine medium bombardment group. Four more squadrons were in the process of formation in late 1945, but had not yet deployed by the time the war ended.</paragraph><paragraph>Operational use of the Marine Corps PBJ-1s began in March 1944. The Marine PBJs operated from the Philippines, Saipan,<space/><link><target>Iwo Jima</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Okinawa</target></link><space/>during the last few months of the Pacific war. Their primary mission was the long range<space/><link><target>interdiction</target></link><space/>of enemy shipping trying to run the blockade which was strangling Japan. The weapon of choice during these missions was usually the five-inch HVAR rocket, eight of which could be carried.
