'''April''' is the fourth [[month]] of the [[year]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]], the fifth in the early [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and one of four months with a length of 30 days.

April ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-April.ogg|ˈ|eɪ|p|r|I|l}} {{respell|AY|pril}}) is commonly associated with the season of [[Spring (season)|spring]] in parts of the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and [[autumn]] in parts of the [[Southern Hemisphere]], where it is the seasonal equivalent to [[October]] in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.

April starts on the same day of the week as July in all years, and January in leap years.

==Name and origin==
[[File:Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry avril.jpg|right|thumb|April from the ''[[Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry]]'']]

The Romans gave this month the [[Latin]] name ''[[Aprilis]]''<ref name=Chambers>"April" in ''[[Chambers's Encyclopædia]]''. London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol. 1, p. 497.</ref> but the derivation of this name is uncertain. The traditional etymology is from the verb ''aperire'', "to open", in allusion to its being the season when trees and flowers begin to "open", which is supported by comparison with the modern Greek use of ἁανοιξις (anoixis) (opening) for spring. Since some of the Roman months were named in honor of divinities, and as April was sacred to the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], her [[Veneralia]] being held on the first day, it has been suggested that Aprilis was originally her month '''Aphrilis''', from her equivalent Greek goddess name [[Aphrodite]] (''Aphros''), or from the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] name ''Apru''. [[Jacob Grimm]] suggests the name of a hypothetical god or hero, ''Aper'' or ''Aprus''.<ref>Jacob Grim ''Geschichte der deutschen Sprache''. Cap. "Monate"</ref>

April was the second month of the earliest [[Roman calendar]], before ''[[Ianuarius]]'' and ''[[Februarius]]'' were added by King [[Numa Pompilius]] about 700&nbsp;BC. It became the fourth month of the calendar year (the year when twelve months are displayed in order) during the time of the [[decemvirs]] about 450&nbsp;BC, when it also was given 29 days. The 30th day was added during the reform of the calendar undertaken by [[Julius Caesar]] in the mid-40s BC, which produced the Julian calendar.

The [[Anglo-Saxons]] called April ''Oster-monath'' or ''Eostur-monath''. The [[Venerable Bede]] says in ''[[The Reckoning of Time]]'' that this month ''Eostur'' is the root of the word [[Easter]]. He further states that the month was named after a goddess ''[[Eostre]]'' whose feast was in that month. It is also attested by [[Einhard]] in his work, [[Vita Karoli Magni]].


[[St George]]'s day is the twenty-third of the month; and [[St Mark]]'s Eve, with its superstition that the ghosts of those who are doomed to die within the year will be seen to pass into the church, falls on the twenty-fourth.

In [[History of China|China]] the symbolic ploughing of the earth by the emperor and princes of the blood took place in their third month, which frequently corresponds to April.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} In [[Finnish language|Finnish]] April is ''huhtikuu'', meaning ''[[slash-and-burn]] moon'', when [[gymnosperm]]s for beat and burn clearing of farmland were felled.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In [[Slovene language|Slovene]], the most established traditional name is ''mali traven'', meaning the month when plants start growing. It was first written in 1466 in the [[Škofja Loka manuscript]].<ref name="KoledarDPG2007">{{cite journal |url=http://www.dobrova-polhovgradec.si/doc/priponke/koledar%20prir%2007%20zadnji.pdf |title=Koledar prireditev v letu 2007 in druge informacije občine Dobrova–Polhov Gradec |language=Slovenian |trans_title=The Calendar of Events and Other Information of the Municipality of Dobrova–Polhov Gradec <!-- |issn=C505-5857 --> |publisher=Municipality of Dobrova-Polhov Gradec |year=2006}}</ref>'

Aprilis had 30 days, until Numa when it had 29 days, until Julius when it became 30 days long.
Aphrodite is the Greek goddess of love and beauty. She is identified with the Roman goddess Venus
