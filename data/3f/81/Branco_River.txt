The '''Branco River''' ({{lang-pt|Rio Branco}}; Engl: ''White River'') is the principal [[Tributary|affluent]] of the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] from the north. It is enriched by many streams from the [[Tepui]] highlands which separate [[Venezuela]] and [[Guyana]] from [[Brazil]]. Its two upper main tributaries are the [[Uraricoera River|Uraricoera]] and the [[Takutu River|Takutu]].<ref name=WDL1>{{cite web|title=Map of the Branco or Parimé River and of the Caratirimani Uararicapará Majari, Tacutú and Mahú Rivers|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/816|publisher=World Digital Library|accessdate=27 April 2013}}</ref> The latter almost links its sources with those of the [[Essequibo River|Essequibo]].

The Branco flows nearly south, and finds its way into the Negro through several channels and a chain of [[lagoon]]s similar to those of the latter river.  It is {{convert|350|mi|km}} long, up to its Uraricoera [[confluence]].  It has numerous [[island]]s, and, {{convert|235|mi|km}} above its mouth, it is broken by a bad series of rapids.

[[File:Meeting of waters from the air manaus brazil.JPG|left|thumb|Confluence of the Rio Branco with the Rio Negro.]]The river is referred to as "branco" (white) because of inorganic sediments carried in the water.<ref>[http://www.amazonian-fish.co.uk/indexc30.html Comparison between white and black waters]</ref> [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] mentions this peculiar coloration in [http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S011.htm "On the Rio Negro,"] a paper read at the 13 June 1853 meeting of the [[Royal Geographical Society]], in which he says: "[The Rio Branco] is white to a remarkable degree, its waters being actually milky in appearance." [[Alexander von Humboldt]] attributed the color to the presence of [[silicate]]s in the water, principally [[mica]] and [[talc]].<ref name = "Humboldt">[https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/h/humboldt/alexander/travels/chapter25.html  Alexander von Humboldt, ''Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America During the Years 1799-1804,'' (chapter 25). Henry G. Bohn, London, 1853.]</ref> There is a visible contrast with the waters of the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] at the confluence of the two rivers, the Rio Negro's waters being [[Blackwater river|darkened]] by suspended organic debris containing [[tannin]] and [[humic acid]].
