'''Embroidery''' is the [[handicraft]] of decorating [[Textile|fabric]] or other materials with [[sewing needle|needle]] and [[yarn|thread or yarn]]. Embroidery may also incorporate other materials such as [[metal]] strips, [[pearl]]s, [[bead]]s, [[quill]]s, and  [[sequin]]s. Embroidery is most often used on caps, hats, coats, blankets, dress shirts, denim, stockings, and golf shirts. Embroidery is available with a wide variety of [[yarn|thread or yarn]] color.

The basic techniques or [[Embroidery stitch|stitches]] on surviving examples of the earliest embroidery—[[chain stitch]], [[buttonhole stitch|buttonhole or blanket stitch]], [[running stitch]], [[satin stitch]], [[cross stitch]]—remain the fundamental techniques of hand embroidery today.

===Origins===
Embroidery has been dated to the [[Warring States period]]
(5th-3rd century BC) of [[History of China|ancient China]].<ref>Gillow and Bryan 1999, p. 178</ref>
The process used to tailor, patch, mend and reinforce cloth fostered the development of sewing techniques, and the decorative possibilities of sewing led to the art of embroidery.<ref>Gillow and Bryan 1999, p. 12</ref> In a garment from [[Migration period]] Sweden, roughly 300–700 CE, the edges of bands of trimming are reinforced with running stitch, back stitch, stem stitch, tailor's buttonhole stitch, and whipstitching, but it is uncertain whether this work simply reinforced the seams or should be interpreted as decorative embroidery.<ref name="Coatsworth">Coatsworth, Elizabeth: "Stitches in Time: Establishing a History of Anglo-Saxon Embroidery", in Netherton and Owen-Crocker 2005, p. 2</ref>

The remarkable stability of basic embroidery stitches has been noted:
{{blockquote|It is a striking fact that in the development of embroidery ... there are no changes of materials or techniques which can be felt or interpreted as advances from a primitive to a later, more refined stage. On the other hand, we often find in early works a technical accomplishment and high standard of craftsmanship rarely attained in later times.<ref>Marie Schuette and Sigrid Muller-Christensen, ''The Art of Embroidery'' translated by Donald King, Thames and Hudson, 1964, quoted in Netherton and Owen-Crocker 2005, p. 2</ref>}}

===Global Use and Techniques===
Elaborately embroidered clothing, religious objects, and household items often were seen as a mark of wealth and status, as in the case of [[Opus Anglicanum]], a technique used by professional workshops and guilds in medieval [[England]].<ref>Levey and King 1993, p. 12</ref> Embroidery was also produced for every day use all over the world. In English culture, centuries old examples survive showing that embroidery was a skill marking a girl's path into womanhood as well conveying rank and social standing.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/ngv-embroidery-exhibition-imagine-a-12yearold-spending-two-years-on-this-20150324-1m699n.html |title=NGV embroidery exhibition: imagine a 12-year-old spending two years on this... |last=Power |first=Lisa |date=27 March 2015 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |access-date=30 May 2015}}</ref>

Many of these items used materials that were accessible to non-professionals. Examples include [[Hardanger]] from Norway, [[Drawn thread work#Poltava-style drawnwork|Merezhka]]  from [[Ukraine]], [[Mountmellick embroidery]] from Ireland,  [[Nakshi kantha]] from [[Bangladesh]] and [[West Bengal]], and [[Brazilian embroidery]]. Many techniques had a practical use such as [[Sashiko]] from [[Japan]], which was used as a way to reinforce clothing.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Islamic World===

In the 16th century, in the reign of the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Akbar]], his chronicler [[Abu al-Fazl ibn Mubarak]] wrote in the famous [[Ain-i-Akbari]]:
"His majesty (Akbar) pays much attention to various stuffs; hence [[Iran]]i, [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], and [[Mongolia]]n articles of wear are in much abundance especially textiles embroidered in the patterns of ''Nakshi'', ''Saadi'', ''Chikhan'', ''Ari'', ''Zardozi'', ''Wastli'', ''Gota'' and ''Kohra''. The imperial workshops in the towns of [[Lahore]], [[Agra]], [[Fatehpur Sikri|Fatehpur]] and [[Ahmedabad]] turn out many masterpieces of workmanship in fabrics, and the figures and patterns, knots and variety of fashions which now prevail astonish even the most experienced travelers. Taste for fine material has since become general, and the drapery of embroidered fabrics used at feasts surpasses every description."<ref>[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/201104/mughal.maal.htm Saudi Aramco World : Mughal Maal<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Embroidery was an important art in the Medieval Islamic world. The 17th century [[Turkish people|Turkish]] traveler [[Evliya Çelebi]] called it the "craft of the two hands". Because embroidery was a sign of high social status in Muslim societies, it became widely popular. In cities such as [[Damascus]], [[Cairo]] and [[Istanbul]], embroidery was visible on [[handkerchief]]s, uniforms, flags, [[calligraphy]], shoes, [[robe]]s, tunics, horse trappings, slippers, sheaths, pouches, covers, and even on [[leather]] [[Belt (clothing)|belts]]. Craftsmen embroidered items with [[gold]] and [[silver]] thread. Embroidery cottage industries, some employing over 800 people, grew to supply these items.<ref>[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200703/the.skill.of.the.two.hands.htm Saudi Aramco World : The Skill of the Two Hands]</ref>

===Automation===
The development of machine embroidery and its [[mass production]] came about in stages in the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The earliest machine embroidery used a combination of machine [[loom]]s and teams of women embroidering the textiles by hand. This was done in France by the mid-1800s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Knight |first=Charles |title=Pictorial Gallery of Arts |year=1858 |location=England}}</ref> The manufacture of [[St. Gallen Embroidery|machine-made embroideries]] in [[St. Gallen]] in eastern Switzerland flourished in the latter half of the 19th century.<ref>Röllin, Peter.

==Classification==

Embroidery can be classified according to whether the design is stitched ''on top of'' or ''through'' the foundation fabric, and by the relationship of stitch placement to the fabric.

In free embroidery, designs are applied without regard to the weave of the underlying fabric.  Examples include [[crewel embroidery|crewel]] and traditional Chinese and Japanese embroidery.

[[Image:Cross stitch embroidery.jpg|left|thumb|[[Cross-stitch]] [[counted-thread embroidery]].  Tea-cloth, [[Hungary]], mid-20th century]]

[[Counted-thread embroidery]] patterns are created by making stitches over a predetermined number of threads in the foundation fabric. Counted-thread embroidery is more easily worked on an [[even-weave]] foundation fabric such as embroidery [[canvas]], [[aida cloth]], or specially woven [[cotton]] and [[linen]] fabrics although non-evenweave linen is used as well. Examples include [[needlepoint]] and some forms of [[blackwork embroidery]].
[[File:Hardanger embroidery.png|right|thumb|[[Hardanger embroidery|Hardanger]], a [[whitework]] technique. Contemporary.]]

In [[canvas work]] threads are stitched through a fabric mesh to create a dense pattern that completely covers the foundation fabric. Traditional canvas work such as [[Bargello (needlework)|bargello]] is a counted-thread technique.<ref>Gillow and Bryan 1999, p. 198</ref> Since the 19th century, printed and hand painted canvases, on which the printed or painted image serves as a guide to the placement of the various thread or yarn colors, have eliminated the need for counting threads.  These are particularly suited to pictorial rather than geometric designs such as those deriving from the [[Berlin wool work]] craze of the early 19th century.<ref>Embroiderers' Guild 1984, p. 54</ref><ref>Berman 2000</ref><ref name="RDCW">Readers Digest 1979, p. 112-115</ref>

In [[drawn thread work]] and [[cutwork]], the foundation fabric is deformed or cut away to create holes that are then embellished with embroidery, often with thread in the same color as the foundation fabric.  These techniques are the forerunners of [[needlelace]].  When created with white thread on white linen or cotton, this work is collectively referred to as [[whitework]].<ref>Readers Digest 1979, pp. 74-91</ref>

==Materials==
[[Image:Patiala Phulkari.jpg|thumb| [[Phulkari]] from the [[Punjab region]] of India. Phulkari embroidery, popular since at least the 15th century, is traditionally done on hand-spun cotton cloth with simple darning stitches using silk floss.]]
[[File:Bayeux Tapestry scene55 Eustach.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Laid threads, a surface technique in wool on linen. The [[Bayeux Tapestry]], 11th century.]]

The fabrics and yarns used in traditional embroidery vary from place to place. [[Wool]], [[linen]], and [[silk]] have been in use for thousands of years for both fabric and yarn.  Today, [[embroidery thread]] is manufactured in [[cotton]], [[rayon]], and [[novelty yarn]]s as well as in traditional wool, linen, and silk.  [[Ribbon]] embroidery uses narrow ribbon in silk or silk/[[organza]] blend ribbon, most commonly to create floral motifs.<ref>van Niekerk 2006</ref>

Surface embroidery techniques such as chain stitch and [[couching|couching or laid-work]] are the most economical of expensive yarns; couching is generally used for [[goldwork]].  Canvas work techniques, in which large amounts of yarn are buried on the back of the work, use more materials but provide a sturdier and more substantial finished textile.<ref name="RDCW" />

In both canvas work and surface embroidery an [[embroidery hoop]] or frame can be used to stretch the material and ensure even stitching tension that prevents pattern distortion. Modern canvas work tends to follow symmetrical counted stitching patterns with designs emerging from the repetition of one or just a few similar stitches in a variety of hues. In contrast, many forms of surface embroidery make use of a wide range of stitching patterns in a single piece of work.<ref>Readers Digest 1979, pp. 1-19, 112-117</ref>

==Machine==
[[Image:Machine chain stitch.jpg|right|thumb|Commercial machine embroidery in [[chain stitch]] on a [[voile]] curtain, China, early 21st century.]]

Contemporary embroidery is stitched with a [[computer]]ized embroidery machine using patterns digitized with [[embroidery software]]. In [[machine embroidery]], different types of "fills" add texture and design to the finished work. [[Machine embroidery]] is used to add [[logo]]s and [[monogram]]s to business shirts or jackets, gifts, and team apparel as well as to decorate household linens, draperies, and decorator fabrics that mimic the elaborate hand embroidery of the past.

There has also been a development in free hand machine embroidery, new machines have been designed that allow for the user to create free-motion embroidery which has its place in textile arts, quilting, dressmaking, home furnishings and more. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.toyotaoekakiworld.com/sewing-ideas/using-flowers-and-plans-to-inspire-free-motion-embroidery/}}</ref>

== Qualifications ==
City and Guilds qualification<ref>http://www.cityandguilds.com/qualifications-and-apprenticeships/creative#fil=uk&acc=11820-creativetechniques</ref> in Embroidery allows embroiderers to become recognized for their skill. This qualification also gives them the credibility to teach. For example, the notable textiles artist, [[Kathleen Laurel Sage- Textiles Artist]],<ref>http://www.kathleenlaurelsage.co.uk/a-little-about-me/</ref> began her teaching career by getting the City and Guilds Embroidery 1 and 2 qualifications. She has now gone on to write a book on the subject.<ref>http://www.tudorrosepatchwork.co.uk/embroidered-soldered-and-heat-zapped-surfaces-by-kathleen-laurel-sage-p-8679.html</ref>
