The battle was the climax of a<space/><link><target>Mediterranean campaign of 1798</target><part>naval campaign</part></link><space/>that had ranged across the Mediterranean during the previous three months, as a large French convoy sailed from<space/><link><target>Toulon</target></link><space/>to<space/><link><target>Alexandria</target></link><space/>carrying an expeditionary force under then General<space/><link><target>Napoleon Bonaparte</target></link>. In the battle, the British fleet, led by Rear-Admiral Sir<space/><link><target>Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson</target><part>Horatio Nelson</part></link>, decisively defeated the French under Vice-Admiral<space/><link><target>Franois-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Napoleon</target><part>Napoleon Bonaparte</part></link><space/>sought to invade Egypt as the first step in a campaign against<space/><link><target>British India</target></link><space/>in an effort to drive Britain out of the<space/><link><target>French Revolutionary Wars</target></link>. As Bonaparte's fleet crossed the Mediterranean, it was pursued by a British force under Nelson, who had been sent from the British fleet in the<space/><link><target>Tagus</target></link><space/>to learn the purpose of the French expedition and defeat it. For more than two months, he chased the French, on several occasions only missing them by a matter of hours. Bonaparte, aware of Nelson's pursuit, enforced absolute secrecy about his destination and was able to capture<space/><link><target>Malta</target></link><space/>and then land in Egypt without interception by the British naval forces.</paragraph><paragraph>With the French army ashore, the French fleet anchored in Aboukir Bay,<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>20</arg><arg>mi</arg><arg>km</arg></template><space/>northeast of Alexandria. Commander Vice-Admiral<space/><link><target>Franois-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers</target></link><space/>believed he had established a formidable defensive position. When the British fleet arrived off Egypt on 1 August and discovered Brueys's dispositions, Nelson ordered an immediate attack. His ships advanced on the French line and split into two divisions as they approached. One cut across the head of the line and passed between the anchored French and the shore while the other engaged the seaward side of the French fleet. Trapped in a crossfire, the leading French warships were battered into surrender during a fierce three-hour battle, while the centre succeeded in repelling the initial British attack. As British reinforcements arrived, the centre came under renewed assault and at 22:00 the French flagship<space/><link><target>French ship Orient (1791)</target><part>''Orient''</part></link><space/>exploded. With Brueys dead, and his<space/><link><target>vanguard</target></link><space/>and centre defeated, the rear division of the French fleet attempted to break out of the bay, but ultimately only two<space/><link><target>ships of the line</target></link><space/>and two<space/><link><target>frigate</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>escaped, from a total of 17 ships engaged.</paragraph><paragraph>The battle reversed the strategic situation between the two nations' forces in the Mediterranean and entrenched the Royal Navy in the dominant position it would retain for the rest of the war. It also encouraged other European countries to turn against France, and was a factor in the outbreak of the<space/><link><target>War of the Second Coalition</target></link>.
