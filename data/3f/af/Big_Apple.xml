Two dusky stable hands were leading a pair of thoroughbreds around the "cooling rings" of adjoining stables at the Fair Grounds in New Orleans and engaging in desultory conversation.

"Well, you'd better fatten up them skinners or all you'll get from the apple will be the core," was the quick rejoinder.<ref>[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/first_big_apple_explanation_february_18_1924/ First “Big Apple” explanation: February 18, 1924].
