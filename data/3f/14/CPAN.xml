Some of these perform bootstrapping tasks, such as<space/><link><target>ExtUtils::MakeMaker</target></link>, which is used for building and installing other extension modules; others, like<space/><link><target>CGI.pm</target></link>, are merely commonly used. The authors of Perl do not expect this limited group to meet every need, however.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Role</heading><paragraph>The CPAN's main purpose is to help programmers locate modules and programs not included in the Perl standard distribution. Its structure is decentralized. Authors maintain and improve their own modules. Forking, and creating competing modules for the same task or purpose is common. There is no formal bug tracking system, but there is a third-party bug tracking system that CPAN designated as the suggested official method of reporting issues with modules. Continuous development on modules is rare; many are abandoned by their authors, or go years between new versions being released. Sometimes a maintainer will be appointed to an abandoned module. They can release new versions of the module, and accept patches from the community to the module as their time permits. CPAN has no<space/><link><target>revision control system</target></link>, although the source for the modules is often stored on<space/><link><target>GitHub</target></link>. Also, the complete history of the CPAN and all its modules is available as the<space/><link type='external' href='https://github.com/gitpan'>GitPAN</link><space/>project, allowing to easily see the complete history for all the modules and for easy maintenance of forks. CPAN is also used to distribute new versions of Perl, as well as related projects, such as<space/><link><target>Parrot virtual machine</target><part>Parrot</part></link>.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Structure</heading><paragraph>Files on the CPAN are referred to as<space/><italics>distributions</italics>. A distribution may consist of one or more modules, documentation files, or programs packaged in a common archiving format, such as a<space/><link><target>gzip</target><trail>ped</trail></link><space/><link><target>tar file format</target><part>tar</part></link><space/>archive or a<space/><link><target>ZIP file format</target><part>ZIP</part></link><space/>file. Distributions will often contain installation scripts (usually called<space/><italics>Makefile.PL</italics><space/>or<space/><italics>Build.PL</italics>) and test scripts which can be run to verify the contents of the distribution are functioning properly. New distributions are uploaded to the Perl Authors Upload Server, or PAUSE (see the section<space/><link><target>#Uploading distributions with PAUSE</target><part>Uploading distributions with PAUSE</part></link>).</paragraph><paragraph>In 2003, distributions started to include metadata files, called<space/><italics>META.<link><target>YAML</target><part>yml</part></link></italics>, indicating the distribution's name, version, dependencies, and other useful information; however, not all distributions contain metadata. When metadata is not present in a distribution, the PAUSE's software will usually try to analyze the code in the distribution to look for the same information; this is not necessarily very reliable.</paragraph><paragraph>With thousands of distributions, CPAN needs to be structured to be useful. Distributions on the CPAN are divided into 24 broad<space/><italics>chapters</italics><space/>based on their purpose, such as<space/><italics><link><target>Internationalization</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Locale</target></link></italics>;<space/><italics><link><target>Archiving</target></link>,<space/><link><target>data compression</target><part>Compression</part></link>, And<space/><link><target>data conversion</target><part>Conversion</part></link></italics>; and<space/><italics><link><target>Mail</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Usenet</target></link><space/>News</italics>. Distributions can also be browsed by author. Finally, the natural hierarchy of Perl module names (such as &quot;Apache::DBI&quot; or &quot;Lingua::EN::Inflect&quot;) can sometimes be used to browse modules in the CPAN.</paragraph><paragraph>CPAN module distributions usually have names in the form of<space/><italics>CGI-Application-3.1</italics><space/>(where the<space/><bold>::</bold><space/>used in the module's name has been replaced with a dash, and the version number has been appended to the name), but this is only a convention; many prominent distributions break the convention, especially those that contain multiple modules. Security restrictions prevent a distribution from ever being replaced, so virtually all distribution names do include a<space/><link><target>version number</target></link>.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Components</heading><heading level='3'>Mirrors</heading><paragraph>The heart of CPAN is its worldwide network of more than 260 mirrors in more than 60 countries.<extension extension_name='ref' name="mirror"></extension><space/>CPAN's master site has over 149 direct public mirrors. Each site contains up to the full 3.9<space/><link><target>gigabyte</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>of data, or a subset of it if the mirror's maintainer wishes to selectively choose.<extension extension_name='ref' name="home"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Most mirrors update themselves hourly, daily or bidaily from the CPAN master site.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.cs.uu.nl/stats/mirmon/cpan.html</arg><arg name="title">CPAN Status and Statistics</arg><arg name="accessdate">2010-05-09</arg></template></extension><space/>Some sites are major FTP servers which mirror lots of other software, but others are simply servers owned by companies that use Perl heavily. There are at least two mirrors on every continent except Antarctica.</paragraph><paragraph>For more information on CPAN mirrors, see<space/><link type='external' href='http://mirrors.cpan.org/'>mirrors.cpan.org</link>.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Search engines</heading><paragraph>Several search engines have been written to help Perl programmers sort through the CPAN. The most popular and official is<space/><link type='external' href='http://search.cpan.org/'>search.cpan.org</link>, which includes textual search, a browsable index of modules, and extracted copies of all distributions currently on the CPAN. Other CPAN search engines that have been set up are:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><link type='external' href='https://metacpan.org/'>metacpan.org</link><space/>- A modern CPAN search site, with an open source backend.</listitem><listitem><link type='external' href='http://grep.cpan.me/'>grep.cpan.me</link><space/>- CPAN-&gt;GREP, a site that allows you to search code on CPAN, also open source.</listitem><listitem><link type='external' href='http://backpan.perl.org/'>backpan.perl.org</link><space/>- A complete history of all dists ever uploaded to CPAN.</listitem></list><heading level='3'>Testers</heading><paragraph>CPAN Testers are a group of volunteers, who will download and test distributions as they are uploaded to CPAN. This enables the authors to have their modules tested on many platforms and environments that they would otherwise not have access to, thus helping to promote portability, as well as a degree of quality. Smoke testers send reports, which are then collated and used for a variety of presentation websites, including the main reports site, statistics and dependencies.</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><link type='external' href='http://www.cpantesters.org/'>CPAN Testers Reports</link><space/>co-ordinates and collects testing results for all CPAN uploads on various platforms.</listitem><listitem><link type='external' href='http://stats.cpantesters.org'>CPAN Testers Statistics</link><space/>provides statistical analysis and monitoring of the CPAN Testing infrastructure.</listitem><listitem><link type='external' href='http://wiki.cpantesters.org'>CPAN Testers Wiki</link><space/>contains useful help and advice for getting started as a smoke tester, as well as planning for CPAN Testers 2.0</listitem><listitem><link type='external' href='http://deps.cpantesters.org/'>CPAN Dependencies</link>, which combines data from META.yml files and the CPAN testers to graphically show a module's dependencies and attempt to calculate how likely it is to work on a particular platform.</listitem><listitem><link type='external' href='http://devel.cpantesters.org/'>CPAN Testers Development</link><space/>contains the links to all the supporting tools, data and source that are used to maintain the CPAN Testers infrastructure.</listitem></list><heading level='3'>Other supporting websites</heading><paragraph>A family of other loosely integrated support websites have been created as the CPAN has grown in size and scale.

CPAN.pm is mainly an interactive shell which can be used to search for, download, and install distributions. An interactive shell called<space/><xhtml:tt>cpan</xhtml:tt><space/>is also provided in the Perl core, and is the usual way of running CPAN.pm. After a short configuration process and mirror selection, it uses tools available on the user's computer to automatically download, unpack, compile, test, and install modules. It is also capable of updating itself.</paragraph><paragraph>More recently, an effort to replace CPAN.pm with something cleaner and more modern has resulted in the CPANPLUS (or CPAN++) set of modules. CPANPLUS separates the back-end work of downloading, compiling, and installing modules from the interactive shell used to issue commands. It also supports several advanced features, such as cryptographic signature checking and test result reporting. Finally, CPANPLUS can uninstall a distribution. CPANPLUS was added to the Perl core in version 5.10.0.</paragraph><paragraph>Both modules can check a distribution's<space/><link><target>coupling (computer science)</target><part>dependencies</part></link><space/>and can be set to recursively install any<space/><link><target>prerequisite</target><trail>s</trail></link>, either automatically or with individual user approval. Both support FTP and HTTP and can work through firewalls and proxies.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Uploading distributions with PAUSE</heading><paragraph>Authors can upload new distributions to the CPAN through the<space/><italics>Perl Authors Upload Server</italics><space/>(<link type='external' href='http://pause.perl.org/pause/query'>PAUSE</link>). To do so, they must<space/><link type='external' href='https://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=request_id'>request a PAUSE account</link>. Registration information can be found at the<space/><link type='external' href='https://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=pause_04about#registering'>PAUSE faq</link></paragraph><paragraph>Registrations are manually reviewed, so the process may take a week or longer.</paragraph><paragraph>Once registered, the new PAUSE account has a directory in the CPAN under<space/><italics>authors/id/(first letter)/(first two letters)/(author ID)</italics>. They may use a web interface at<space/><link type='external' href='https://pause.perl.org'>pause.perl.org</link>, or the PAUSE ftp server to upload files to their directory and delete them. PAUSE will warn an administrator if a user uploads a module that already exists, unless they are listed as a<space/><italics>co-maintainer</italics>. This can be specified through PAUSE's web interface.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Influence</heading><paragraph>Experienced Perl programmers often comment that half of Perl's power is in the CPAN.
