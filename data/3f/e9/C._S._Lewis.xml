The New House is almost a major character in my story.
I am the product of long corridors, empty sunlit rooms,

distant noises of gurgling cisterns and pipes,
and the noise of wind under the tiles. Also, of endless books.</poem>

Lewis's brother had enrolled there three years previously. The school was closed not long afterwards due to a lack of pupils; the headmaster Robert &quot;Oldie&quot; Capron was soon after committed to a psychiatric hospital. Lewis then attended<space/><link><target>Campbell College</target></link><space/>in the east of Belfast about a mile from his home, but he left after a few months due to respiratory problems. He was then sent to the health-resort town of<space/><link><target>Malvern, Worcestershire</target><part>Malvern</part></link>, Worcestershire, where he attended the preparatory school Cherbourg House, which Lewis calls &quot;Chartres&quot; in his autobiography. It was during this time that Lewis abandoned his childhood Christian faith and became an atheist, becoming interested in mythology and the occult.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Lewis</arg><arg>1966b</arg><arg name="p">56</arg></template><space/>In September 1913, Lewis enrolled at<space/><link><target>Malvern College</target></link>, where he remained until the following June. He found the school socially competitive.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Lewis</arg><arg>1966a</arg><arg name="p">107</arg></template><space/>After leaving Malvern, he studied privately with William T. Kirkpatrick, his father's old tutor and former headmaster of<space/><link><target>Lurgan College</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>As a teenager, Lewis was wonder-struck by the songs and legends of what he called<space/><italics>Northernness</italics>, the ancient literature of Scandinavia preserved in the<space/><link><target>Icelandic sagas</target></link>. These legends intensified an inner longing he later called &quot;joy&quot;. He also grew to love nature; its beauty reminded him of the stories of the North, and the stories of the North reminded him of the beauties of nature. His teenage writings moved away from the tales of Boxen, and he began using different art forms, including<space/><link><target>epic poetry</target></link><space/>and opera, to try to capture his new-found interest in<space/><link><target>Norse mythology</target></link><space/>and the natural world. Studying with Kirkpatrick (&quot;The Great Knock&quot;, as Lewis afterwards called him) instilled in him a love of<space/><link><target>Greek literature</target></link><space/>and mythology and sharpened his debate and reasoning skills.

Paddy was killed in action in 1918 and Lewis kept his promise. Paddy had earlier introduced Lewis to his mother, Jane King Moore, and a friendship quickly sprang up between Lewis, who was eighteen when they met, and Jane, who was forty-five. The friendship with Moore was particularly important to Lewis while he was recovering from his wounds in hospital, as his father did not visit him.</paragraph><paragraph>Lewis lived with and cared for Moore until she was hospitalised in the late 1940s. He routinely introduced her as his mother, and referred to her as such in letters. Lewis' own mother had died when he was a child, and his father was distant, demanding, and eccentric, and he developed a deeply affectionate friendship with Moore.</paragraph><paragraph>Speculation regarding their relationship re-surfaced with the 1990 publication of<space/><link><target>A. N. Wilson</target></link>'s biography of Lewis. Wilson (who never met Lewis) attempted to make a case for their having been lovers for a time. Wilson's biography was not the first to address the question of Lewis's relationship with Moore.<space/><link><target>George Sayer</target></link><space/>knew Lewis for 29 years, and he had sought to shed light on the relationship during the period of 14 years prior to Lewis's conversion to Christianity. In his biography<space/><italics>Jack: A Life of C. S. Lewis</italics>, he wrote:<template><target>quote</target><arg>Were they lovers? [[Owen Barfield]], who knew Jack well in the 1920s, once said that he thought the likelihood was "fifty-fifty." Although she was twenty-six years older than Jack, she was still a handsome woman, and he was certainly infatuated with her. But it seems very odd, if they were lovers, that he would call her "mother." We know, too, that they did not share the same bedroom. It seems most likely that he was bound to her by the promise he had given to Paddy and that his promise was reinforced by his love for her as his second mother.<ref>Sayer, George (1997).

In the first five chapters of<space/><italics>Mere Christianity</italics><space/>Lewis discusses the idea that people have a standard of behaviour to which they expect people to adhere. This standard has been called Universal Morality or<space/><link><target>Natural Law</target></link>. Lewis claims that people all over the earth know what this law is and when they break it. He goes on to claim that there must be someone or something behind such a universal set of principles.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Lindskoog</arg><arg>2001</arg><arg name="p">144</arg></template><extension extension_name='blockquote'>These then are the two points that I wanted to make. First, that human beings, all over the earth, have this curious idea that they ought to behave in a certain way, and cannot really get rid of it. Secondly, that they do not in fact behave in that way. They know the Law of Nature; they break it. These two facts are the foundation of all clear thinking about ourselves and the universe we live in.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Lewis</arg><arg>1997</arg><arg name="p">21</arg></template></extension>Lewis also portrays Universal Morality in his works of fiction. In<space/><italics>The Chronicles of Narnia</italics><space/>he describes Universal Morality as the &quot;deep magic&quot; which everyone knew.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Lindskoog</arg><arg>2001</arg><arg name="p">146</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>In the second chapter of<space/><italics>Mere Christianity</italics><space/>Lewis recognises that &quot;many people find it difficult to understand what this Law of Human Nature&amp;nbsp;... is&quot;. And he responds first to the idea &quot;that the Moral Law is simply our herd instinct&quot; and second to the idea &quot;that the Moral Law is simply a social convention&quot;. In responding to the second idea Lewis notes that people often complain that one set of moral ideas is better than another, but that this actually argues for there existing some &quot;Real Morality&quot; to which they are comparing other moralities. Finally he notes that sometimes differences in moral codes are exaggerated by people who confuse differences in beliefs about morality with differences in beliefs about facts:</paragraph><paragraph><template><target>quote</target><arg name="I have met people who exaggerate the differences, because they have not distinguished between differences of morality and differences of belief about facts. For example, one man said to me, "Three hundred years ago people in England were putting witches to death. Was that what you call the Rule of Human Nature or Right Conduct?" But surely the reason we do not execute witches is that we do not believe there are such things. If we did&nbsp;– if we really thought that there were people going about who had sold themselves to the devil and received supernatural powers from him in return and were using these powers to kill their neighbours or drive them mad or bring bad weather, surely we would all agree that if anyone deserved the death penalty, then these filthy [[quisling]]s did. There is no difference of moral principle here: the difference is simply about matter of fact. It may be a great advance in knowledge not to believe in witches: there is no moral advance in not executing them when you do not think they are there. You would not call a man humane for ceasing to set mousetraps if he did so because he believed there were no mice in the house.{{sfn|Lewis|1997|p">26}}</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Lewis also had fairly progressive views on the topic of &quot;animal morality&quot;, in particular the suffering of animals, as is evidenced by several of his essays: most notably,<space/><italics>On Vivisection</italics><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="title"><space/>Irish Anti-Vivisection Society<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2 August 2009<space/></arg><arg name="url"><space/>http://www.irishantivivisection.org/cslewis.html</arg></template></extension><space/>and &quot;On the Pains of Animals.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Citation</target><arg name="title">CS Lewis's theology of animals<space/></arg><arg name="journal">[[Anglican Theological Review]]</arg><arg name="date">Winter 1998</arg><arg name="first">Andrew</arg><arg name="last">Linzey</arg><arg name="url"><space/>http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3818/is_199801/ai_n8802633/<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">1 April 2009</arg><arg name="postscript">.</arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Cite news</target><arg name="title">CS Lewis: animal theology</arg><arg name="publisher">BBC<space/></arg><arg name="work"><space/>Religion & Ethics<space/></arg><arg name="url">http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/people/cslewis_14.shtml</arg><arg name="accessdate">1 April 2009</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Legacy</heading><paragraph><link><target>Image:Statue of C.S.
