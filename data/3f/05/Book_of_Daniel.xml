The most fundamental is a genre division between the court tales of chapters 16 and the apocalyptic visions of 712. The second is a language division between the<space/><link><target>Biblical Hebrew</target><part>Hebrew</part></link><space/>of chapters 1 and 812, and the<space/><link><target>Biblical Aramaic</target><part>Aramaic</part></link><space/>of chapters 27.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Collins</arg><arg>1984</arg><arg name="p">28</arg></template><template><target>sfn</target><arg>Provan</arg><arg>2003</arg><arg name="p">665</arg></template><space/>This language division is reinforced by the<space/><link><target>Chiastic structure</target><part>chiastic</part></link><space/>arrangement of the Aramaic chapters (see below). Various suggestions have been made by scholars to explain the fact that the genre division does not coincide with the other two. However, the most reasonable proposal is that put forward by Collins: the language division and concentric structure of chapters 2-6 are artificial literary devices designed to bind the two halves of the book together.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Collins</arg><arg>1984</arg><arg name="p">30-31</arg></template><space/>It should also be noted that the time settings of chapters 16 show a progression from Babylonian to<space/><link><target>Media (region)</target><part>Median times</part></link>, which is repeated (Babylonian to Persian) in chapters 712.

When the wise men protest that this is beyond the power of any man he sentences all, including Daniel and his friends, to death. Daniel receives an explanatory vision from God: Nebuchadnezzar had seen an enormous statue with a head of gold, breast and arms of silver, belly and thighs of bronze, legs of iron, and feet of mixed iron and clay, then saw the statue destroyed by a rock that turned into a mountain filling the whole earth. Daniel explains the dream to the king: the statue symbolized four successive kingdoms, starting with Nebuchadnezzar, all of which would be crushed by God's kingdom, which would endure forever. Nebuchadnezzar acknowledges the supremacy of Daniel's god, raises him over all his wise men, and places him and his companions over the province of Babylon.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Seow</arg><arg>2003</arg><arg name="p">31-33</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='3'>The fiery furnace (chapter 3)</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego</arg></template>Daniel's companions Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refuse to bow to King Nebuchadnezzar's golden statue and are thrown into a fiery furnace.

The Persian army which captured Babylon was under the command of a certain Gobryas (or Gubaru), on behalf of Cyrus, the Persian king. The author of Daniel may have introduced the reference to a Mede in order to fulfill Isaiah and Jeremiah, who prophesied that the Medes would overthrow Babylon, confusing the events of 539 with those of 520 BCE, when Darius I captured Babylon after an uprising.
