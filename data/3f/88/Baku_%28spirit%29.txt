{{nihongo|'''Baku'''|獏{{lang|en| or }}貘}} are Japanese supernatural beings that devour dreams and nightmares. According to legend, they were created by the spare pieces that were left over when the gods finished creating all other animals.They have a long history in Japanese folklore and art, and more recently have appeared in Japanese [[anime]] and [[manga]] (see examples cited below).

The Japanese term ''baku'' has two current meanings, referring to both the traditional dream-devouring creature and to the zoological [[tapir]] (e.g., the [[Malayan tapir|Malayan Tapir]]).<ref name="nakagawa">Nakagawa Masako 1999 "Sankai ibutsu: An early seventeenth-century Japanese illustrated manuscript". ''Sino-Japanese Studies'', 11:24-38. Pages 33–34.</ref>  In recent years, there have been changes in how the baku is depicted.

==History and description==
The traditional Japanese nightmare-devouring baku originates in [[Chinese folklore]] and was familiar in Japan as early as the [[Muromachi]] period (14th-15th century).<ref>Hori Tadao 2005 "Cultural note on dreaming and dream study in the future: Release from nightmare and development of dream control technique," ''Sleep and Biological Rhythms'' 3 (2), 49–55.</ref> Hori Tadao has described the dream-eating abilities attributed to the traditional baku and relates them to other preventatives against nightmare such as [[amulet]]s. [[Kaii-Yōkai Denshō Database]], citing a 1957 paper, and Mizuki also describe the dream-devouring capacities of the traditional baku.<ref>Mizuki, Shigeru 2004 ''Mujara 5: Tōhoku, Kyūshū-hen'' (in Japanese). Japan: Soft Garage. page 137. ISBN 4-86133-027-0.</ref>

An early 17th-century Japanese manuscript, the ''Sankai Ibutsu'' ({{nihongo2|山海異物}}), describes the baku as a shy, Chinese mythical [[Chimera (mythology)|chimera]] with an [[elephant]]’s trunk, [[rhinoceros]] eyes, an [[ox]] tail, and [[tiger]] paws, which protected against pestilence and evil, although eating nightmares was not included among its abilities.<ref name="nakagawa"/> However, in a 1791 Japanese wood-block illustration, a specifically dream-destroying baku is depicted with an elephant’s head, tusks, and trunk, with horns and tiger’s claws.<ref>Kern, Adam L. 2007 ''Manga from the Floating World: Comicbook culture and the kibyoshi of Edo Japan''. Cambridge: Harvard University Asian Center. Page 236, figure 4.26.</ref> The elephant’s head, trunk, and tusks are characteristic of baku portrayed in classical era (pre-[[Meiji period|Meiji]]) Japanese wood-block prints (see illustration) and in shrine, temple, and [[netsuke]] carvings.<ref>{{nihongo2|[http://www.sirasaki.co.jp/baku/baku.html 夢貘まくら]}}.

Legend has it, that a person who wakes up from a bad dream can call out to baku. A child having a nightmare in Japan will wake up and repeat three times “Baku-san, come eat my dream.” Legends say that the baku will come into the child’s room and devour the bad dream, allowing the child to go back to sleep peacefully. However, calling to the baku must be done sparingly, because if he remains hungry after eating one’s nightmare, he may also devour their hopes and desires as well, leaving them to live an empty life. The baku can also be summoned for protection from bad dreams prior to falling asleep at night. To this day, it remains common for Japanese children to keep a baku talisman at their bedside.<ref>M.Reese:"The Asian traditions and myths".pg.60</ref><ref>Hadland Davis F., "Myths and Legends of Japan" (London: G.
