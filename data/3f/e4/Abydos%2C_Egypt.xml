Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection</part></link>The temple of Seti I was built on entirely new ground half a mile to the south of the long series of temples just described. This surviving building is best known as the Great Temple of Abydos, being nearly complete and an impressive sight. A principal purpose of the temple was that of a memorial temple to the king Seti I, as well as reverence of the early pharaohs, which is incorporated within as part of the &quot;Rite of the Ancestors&quot;. The long list of the pharaohs of the principal dynastiesrecognized by Setiare carved on a wall and known as the &quot;<link><target>Abydos King List</target></link>&quot; (showing the<space/><link><target>cartouche</target></link><space/>name of many dynastic pharaohs of Egypt from the first,<space/><link><target>Narmer</target></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>Menes</target></link>, until his time)- with the exception of those noted above. There were significant names deliberately left out of the list. So rare as an almost complete list of pharaoh names, the Table of Abydos, re-discovered by<space/><link><target>William John Bankes</target></link>, has been called the &quot;Rosetta Stone&quot; of Egyptian archaeology, analogous to the<space/><link><target>Rosetta Stone</target></link><space/>for Egyptian writing, beyond the<space/><link><target>Narmer Palette</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="autogenerated1">Misty Cryer, &quot;Travellers in Egypt - William John Bankes&quot; (2006), TravellersinEgypt.org, web:<space/><link type='external' href='http://www.travellersinegypt.org/archives/2004/10/william_john_bankes.html'>TravEgypt-WJB</link>: re-discovered Table of Abydos.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>There also were seven chapels built for the worship of the pharaoh and principal deities, being the &quot;state&quot; deities Ptah, Re-Horakhty, and (centrally positioned) Amun-Re; the remaining three chapels are dedicated to the Abydos triad of Osiris, Isis and Horus. The rites recorded in the deity chapels represent the first complete form of the Daily Ritual, which was performed throughout temples daily in Egypt throughout the pharaonic period. At the back of the temple is an enigmatic structure known as the<space/><link><target>Osireion</target></link>, which served as a cenotaph for Seti-Osiris, and is thought to be connected with the worship of<space/><link><target>Osiris</target></link><space/>as an &quot;Osiris tomb&quot; (Caulfield,<space/><italics>Temple of the Kings</italics>). It is possible that from those chambers led out the great Hypogeum for the celebration of the Osiris mysteries, built by Merenptah (Murray,<space/><italics>The Osireion at Abydos</italics>). The temple was originally<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>550</arg><arg>ft</arg><arg>m</arg><arg name="abbr">on</arg></template><space/>long, but the forecourts are scarcely recognizable, and the part still in good condition is about<template><target>convert</target><arg>250</arg><arg>ft</arg><arg>m</arg><arg name="abbr">on</arg></template><space/>long and<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>350</arg><arg>ft</arg><arg>m</arg><arg name="abbr">on</arg></template><space/>wide, including the wing at the side. Magazines for food and offerings storage were built to either side of the forecourts, as well as a small palace for the king and his retinue, to the southeast of the first forecourt (Ghazouli, The Palace and Magazines Attached to the Temple of Sety I at Abydos and the Facade of This Temple.<space/><bold>ASAE</bold><space/>58 (1959)).</paragraph><paragraph>Except for the list of pharaohs and a<space/><link><target>panegyric</target></link><space/>on<space/><link><target>Ramesses II</target></link>, the subjects are not historical, but religious in nature, dedicated to the transformation of the king after his death. The temple reliefs are celebrated for their delicacy and artistic refinement, utilizing both the archaism of earlier dynasties with the vibrancy of late 18th Dynasty reliefs. The sculptures had been published mostly in hand copy, not facsimile, by<space/><link><target>Auguste Mariette</target></link><space/>in his<space/><italics>Abydos</italics>, I.

Rows of small pits, tombs for the servants of the pharaoh surround the royal chamber, many dozens of such burials being usual.

Evidence of human sacrifices exists in the early tombs, but this practice was changed into symbolic offerings later.</paragraph><paragraph>By the end of the second dynasty the type of tomb constructed changed to a long passage bordered with chambers on either side, the royal burial being in the middle of the length.

The contents of the tombs have been nearly destroyed by successive plunderers; but enough remained to show that rich jewellery was placed on the mummies, a profusion of vases of hard and valuable stones from the royal table service stood about the body, the store-rooms were filled with great jars of wine, perfumed ointments, and other supplies, and tablets of ivory and of ebony were engraved with a record of the yearly annals of the reigns. The seals of various officials, of which over 200 varieties have been found, give an insight into the public arrangements.<extension extension_name='ref'>Petrie,<space/><italics>Royal Tombs</italics>, i. and ii.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>The cemetery of private persons began during the first dynasty with some pit-tombs in the town.
