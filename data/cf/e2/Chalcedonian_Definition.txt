The '''Chalcedonian Definition''' (also '''Confession''' or '''Creed of Chalcedon''') was adopted in A.D. 451 at the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in [[Early centers of Christianity#Western Anatolia|Asia Minor]]. That council was the fourth of the [[first seven Ecumenical Councils]], which are accepted by [[Chalcedonian]] churches ([[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Catholic]], and most [[Protestant]] churches).  It is the first Council ''not'' recognized by any of the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] churches, which may be classified as [[Non-Chalcedonianism|non-Chalcedonian]].

The [[dogmatic definition|Definition]] defines that Christ is 'acknowledged in two natures', which 'come together into one person and one [[hypostatic union|hypostasis]]'. The formal definition of 'two natures' in Christ was understood by the critics of the council at the time, and is understood by many historians and theologians today, to side with western and Antiochene [[Christology]] and to diverge from the teaching of [[Cyril of Alexandria]], who always stressed that Christ is 'one'. However, a modern analysis of the sources of the creed (by A. de Halleux, in Revue Theologique de Louvain 7, 1976) and a reading of the acts, or proceedings, of the council (recently translated into English) show that the bishops considered Cyril the great authority and that even the language of 'two natures' derives from him.

==Oriental Orthodox dissent==

The Chalcedonian Definition was written amid controversy between the western and eastern churches over the meaning of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] (see [[Christology]]), the ecclesiastical influence of the [[Byzantine emperor|emperor]], and the supremacy of the Bishop of [[Diocese of Rome|Rome]]. The western churches readily accepted the creed, but some eastern churches did not.

It became standard orthodox doctrine.  However the [[Coptic Church of Alexandria]] dissented, holding to [[Cyril of Alexandria]]'s preferred formula for the oneness of Christâ€™s nature in the incarnation of God the Word as "out of two natures".<ref name="BG">Bindley, T.Herbert & Green, F.W. ''The Oecumenical Documents of the Faith'' Methuen (1950) pp. 91-92</ref> Cyril's language is not consistent and he may have countenanced the view that it is possible to contemplate in theory two natures after the incarnation,<ref name="BG"/> but the Church of Alexandria felt that the Definition should have stated that Christ be acknowledged "out of two natures" rather than "in two natures".

This [[Miaphysitism|miaphysite]] position, historically characterised by Chalcedonian followers as "[[monophysitism]]" though this is denied by the dissenters, formed the basis for the distinction from other churches of the Coptic Church of Egypt and [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church|Ethiopia]] and the "[[Syriac Orthodox Church|Jacobite]]" churches of [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syria]] and [[Armenian Orthodox Church|Armenia]] (see [[Oriental Orthodoxy]]).

==English translation==
The key section runs:<br>
<blockquote>Following, then, the holy Fathers, we all unanimously teach that our Lord Jesus Christ is to us One and the same Son, the Self-same Perfect in Godhead, the Self-same Perfect in Manhood; truly God and truly Man; the Self-same of a rational soul and body; co-essential with the Father according to the Godhead, the Self-same co-essential with us according to the Manhood; like us in all things, sin apart; before the ages begotten of the Father as to the Godhead, but in the last days, the Self-same, for us and for our salvation (born) of Mary the Virgin [[Theotokos]] as to the Manhood; One and the Same Christ, Son, Lord, Only-begotten; acknowledged in Two Natures unconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly, inseparably; the difference of the Natures being in no way removed because of the Union, but rather the properties of each Nature being preserved, and (both) concurring into One Person and One Hypostasis; not as though He were parted or divided into Two Persons, but One and the Self-same Son and Only-begotten God, Word, Lord, Jesus Christ; even as from the beginning the prophets have taught concerning Him, and as the Lord Jesus Christ Himself hath taught us, and as the Symbol of the Fathers hath handed down to us.<ref>https://archive.org/stream/MN41552ucmf_1/MN41552ucmf_1_djvu.txt</ref>
