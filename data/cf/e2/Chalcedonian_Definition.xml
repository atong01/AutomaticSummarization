The formal definition of 'two natures' in Christ was understood by the critics of the council at the time, and is understood by many historians and theologians today, to side with western and Antiochene<space/><link><target>Christology</target></link><space/>and to diverge from the teaching of<space/><link><target>Cyril of Alexandria</target></link>, who always stressed that Christ is 'one'. However, a modern analysis of the sources of the creed (by A. de Halleux, in Revue Theologique de Louvain 7, 1976) and a reading of the acts, or proceedings, of the council (recently translated into English) show that the bishops considered Cyril the great authority and that even the language of 'two natures' derives from him.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Oriental Orthodox dissent</heading><paragraph>The Chalcedonian Definition was written amid controversy between the western and eastern churches over the meaning of the<space/><link><target>Incarnation (Christianity)</target><part>Incarnation</part></link><space/>(see<space/><link><target>Christology</target></link>), the ecclesiastical influence of the<space/><link><target>Byzantine emperor</target><part>emperor</part></link>, and the supremacy of the Bishop of<space/><link><target>Diocese of Rome</target><part>Rome</part></link>.
