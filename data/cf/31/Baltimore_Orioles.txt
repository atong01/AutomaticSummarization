The '''Baltimore Orioles''' are an American professional [[baseball]] team based in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. The Orioles compete in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) as a member of the [[American League]] (AL) [[American League East|East]] division. One of the AL's eight charter franchises when the league was established in 1901 with President [[Ban Johnson]]; this particular franchise spent its first year as a major league club in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] as the '''Milwaukee Brewers''' before moving to [[St. Louis, Missouri]] to become the '''[[St. Louis Browns]]'''. After 52 often-beleaguered years in St. Louis, the franchise was purchased in November 1953 by Baltimore business interests led by Clarence Miles. The franchise officially moved to Baltimore for the 1954 season and adopted the historic "Orioles" name in honor of the [[Baltimore Oriole|official state bird of Maryland]]. The Orioles name had also been used by several previous major and minor league baseball clubs in Baltimore, including the franchise that would eventually become the [[New York Yankees]]. [[List of baseball nicknames|Nicknames]] for the team include the '''"O's"''' and the '''"Birds"'''.

The Orioles experienced their greatest success from 1964 to 1983 and have won a total of nine division championships (1969–1971, 1973–1974, 1979, 1983, 1997, 2014), six pennants (1966, 1969–1971, 1979, 1983), three [[World Series]] championships (1966, 1970, 1983), two [[Major League Baseball wild card|wild card]] berths (1996 and 2012), and five [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player Awards]] ([[third baseman]] [[Brooks Robinson]] in 1964, [[outfielder]] [[Frank Robinson]] in 1966, [[first baseman]] [[Boog Powell]] in 1970, and [[shortstop]] [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] in 1983 and 1991).

One of the most historic major league franchises, the O's suffered a stretch of 14 straight losing seasons from 1998 to 2011. However, the team has posted winning seasons since 2012, when the O's qualified for the postseason for the first time since 1997. After missing the playoffs in 2013 they gained a berth in 2014, clinching a division title then advancing to the [[American League Championship Series]] for the first time in 17 years after sweeping the [[Detroit Tigers]] in the [[2014 American League Division Series]]. The Orioles are also well known for their successful stadium, the trend-setting [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]], which opened in 1992 in [[downtown Baltimore]].

==History==
{{Main|History of the Baltimore Orioles}}
The modern Orioles franchise can trace its roots back to the original Milwaukee Brewers of the [[minor league|minor]] [[Western League (U.S. baseball)|Western League]], beginning in 1894 when the league reorganized. The Brewers were there when the WL renamed itself the [[American League]] in 1900.

===Milwaukee Brewers===
At the end of the 1900 season, the American League removed itself from baseball's National Agreement (the formal understanding between the NL and the minor leagues). Two months later, the AL declared itself a competing major league. As a result of several franchise shifts, the Brewers were one of only two Western League teams that didn't fold, move or get kicked out of the league (the other being the [[Detroit Tigers]]). In its first game in the American League, the team lost to the [[1901 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] 14–13 after blowing a nine-run lead in the 9th inning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1901/04251901.htm |title=Events of Thursday, April 25, 1901 |publisher=Retrosheet.org |date=April 25, 1902 |accessdate=November 23, 2012}}</ref> To this day, it is a major league record for the biggest deficit overcome that late in the game.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://blogs.wsj.com/numbersguy/baseballs-biggest-ninth-inning-comebacks-385/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Baseball's Biggest Ninth-Inning Comebacks | first=Carl | last=Bialik | date=July 28, 2008}}</ref> During the first American League season in 1901, they finished last (eighth place) with a record of 48–89. Its lone Major League season, the team played at [[Lloyd Street Grounds]], between 16th and 18th Streets in [[Milwaukee]].

===St. Louis Browns===

The Miles-Krieger ([[Gunther Brewing Company]])-Hoffberger group renamed their new team the Baltimore Orioles soon after taking control of the franchise. The name has a rich history in Baltimore, having been used by a [[Baltimore Orioles (19th century)|National League team]] in the 1890s. In 1901, Baltimore and McGraw were awarded an expansion franchise in the growing American League, naming the team the Orioles. After a battle with Ban Johnson, the Head of the American League in 1902, McGraw took many of the top players including Dan McGann,Roger Bresnahan and Joe McGinnity to the New York Giants.  As an affront to Johnson, McGraw kept the black and orange colors of the New York Giants, which San Francisco wears to this day. In 1903, the rest of the team was transferred to New York in 1903, becoming the [[New York Yankees]]. As a member of the high-minor league level [[International League]], the [[Baltimore Orioles (minor league)|Orioles]] competed at what is now known as the AAA level from 1903 to 1953. Their large postseason crowds at their temporary home, [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Municipal Stadium]], caught the attention of the major leagues, leading to a new MLB franchise in Baltimore.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

====Seeds of success (1954–1959)====
After starting the [[1954 Major League Baseball season|1954 campaign]] with a two-game split against the [[1954 Detroit Tigers season|Tigers]] in [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Detroit]], the [[1954 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] returned to Baltimore on April 15 to a welcoming parade that wound through the streets of [[Downtown Baltimore|downtown]], with an estimated 350,000 spectators lining the route. In its first-ever home opener at [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]] later in the afternoon, they treated a sellout crowd of 46,354 to a 3–1 victory over the [[1954 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]]. The remainder of the season would not be as pleasant, with the team enduring 100 losses while avoiding the AL cellar by only three games. With fellow investors both frustrated with his domination of the franchise's business operations and dissatisfied with yet another seventh-place finish, Clarence Miles resigned in early November 1955. Real estate developer [[James Keelty|James Keelty, Jr.]] succeeded him as president with investment banker [[Joseph Iglehart]] the new board chairman.

The seeds of long-term success were planted on September 14, 1954, when the Orioles hired [[Paul Richards (baseball)|Paul Richards]] to become the ballclub's manager and general manager. He laid the foundation for what would years later be called the '''''Oriole Way'''''. The instruction of baseball fundamentals became uniform in every detail between all classes within the organization. Players were patiently refined until fundamentally sound instead of being hastily advanced to the next level.

For the remainder of the 1950s, the Orioles crawled up the standings, reaching as high as fifth place with a [[1957 Baltimore Orioles season|76–76]] record in 1957. Richards succeeded in stocking the franchise with a plethora of young talent which included [[Dave Nicholson]], [[Pete Ward]], [[Ron Hansen (baseball)|Ron Hansen]] (1960 AL [[Rookie of the Year (award)|Rookie of the Year]]), [[Milt Pappas]], [[Jerry Adair]], [[Steve Barber]] (20 wins in 1963), [[Boog Powell]], [[Dave McNally]] and [[Brooks Robinson]]. Unfortunately, Richards also had the tendency to recklessly spend money on individuals with dubious baseball skills. This became a major problem as bidding wars between the ballclubs to land the best amateur players escalated signing bonuses.

The solution came on November 5, 1958, when [[Lee MacPhail]] was appointed general manager, allowing Richards to focus on his managerial duties. MacPhail added much needed discipline to the [[scout (sport)|scouting]] staff by establishing cross-checkers who thoroughly evaluated young hopefuls to determine whether they were worthy of being tendered a contract. He also accepted the title of president after Keelty resigned in mid-December 1959.

====Pennant contenders (1960–1965)====
One month prior to the end of the 1961 season, Richards resigned as the team's skipper to become the general manager of the expansion [[Houston Astros|Houston Colt 45s]]. A [[1960 Major League Baseball season|year earlier]], he succeeded in establishing the [[1960 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] as a legitimate contender when they stood atop the AL standings as late as early September before finishing in second place at 89–65.

In 1964, the [[1964 Baltimore Orioles season|Birds]], piloted by [[Hank Bauer]] in his first year of managing the ballclub, were involved in a tight pennant race against the [[1964 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] and [[1964 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]]. They ended up in third place with a 97–65 record, only two games out. It has been suggested that they would likely have advanced to the [[1964 World Series|Fall Classic]] had it not been for a minor wrist injury that sidelined Powell for two weeks in late August.<ref>Halberstam, David. ''October 1964''. New York: Villard Books, 1994.</ref> Nevertheless, Robinson enjoyed a breakout season with a league-high 118 RBIs and won the [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|AL Most Valuable Player Award]].

The television/radio network of [[CBS]]' purchase of a majority stake in the Yankees on September 9 of that same year resulted in a change to the ownership situation in Baltimore. Iglehart, the Orioles' largest shareholder at 32% and owner of a sizable amount of CBS stock, straightened out his conflict of interest issues on May 25, 1965 by selling his 64,000 shares in the ball-club to the [[National Bohemian|National Brewing Company]], an original team investor which finally had controlling interest at 65%. Brewery president [[Jerold Hoffberger]] became the Orioles' new chairman of the board. Hoffberger's first action was installing [[Frank Cashen]], the Director of Advertising for the National Brewery, as Senior Vice President & Chief Operating Officer for the Orioles.

With the benefit of a deep talent pool and superior scouts, the franchise continued to make improvements at the major league level. Three months before the start of the 1963 season, the [[1963 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] stabilized its infield by acquiring [[Luis Aparicio]] in a transaction that involved sending a trio of homegrown players (Hansen, Nicholson and Ward) to the White Sox. They also scoured the minor leagues for selections in the [[Rule 5 draft]] ([[Paul Blair (baseball)|Paul Blair]] from the [[New York Mets|Mets]] in 1962, [[Moe Drabowsky]] from the Cardinals in 1965) and claims off waivers ([[Curt Blefary]], 1965 [[AL Rookie of the Year]], from the Yankees in 1963).

====Milt Pappas for Frank Robinson====
[[File:Antonio Tobias Mendez.jpg|thumb|[[Frank Robinson]] statue by [[Antonio Tobias Mendez]].]]
On December 9, 1965, the Orioles traded pitcher [[Milt Pappas]] (and several others) to the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in exchange for slugging outfielder [[Frank Robinson]].{{citation needed||date=May 2015}} The following year, Robinson won the [[American League Most Valuable Player]] award, thus becoming the first (and so far only) man to win the MVP in each league (Robinson won the NL MVP in 1961, leading the Reds to the pennant).{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} In addition to winning the 1966 MVP, Robinson also won the [[Triple crown (baseball)|Triple Crown]] (leading the American League in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in), a feat also achieved the following season by [[1962 Boston Red Sox season|Boston's]] [[Carl Yastrzemski]]. The [[1966 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] won their first-ever American League championship in 1966, and in a major upset, swept the [[1966 World Series|World Series]] by out-dueling the [[1966 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] aces [[Sandy Koufax]] and [[Don Drysdale]]. The only home run ball ever hit completely out of Memorial Stadium was slugged by Robinson on Mother's Day in 1966, off [[1966 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] pitcher [[Luis Tiant]]. It cleared the left field single-deck portion of the grandstand. A flag was later erected near the spot the ball cleared the back wall, with simply the word "HERE" upon it. The flag is now in the Baltimore Orioles Museum.

Pappas went 30–29 in a little over two years with the Reds before being traded. Although he would go on to have back-to-back 17-win seasons for the [[Chicago Cubs]] in 1971 and 1972, including a no-hitter in the latter season, this did not help the [[1970 Cincinnati Reds season|Reds]], who ended up losing the [[1970 World Series]] to Robinson and the Orioles. This trade has become renowned as one of the most lopsided in baseball history, including a mention by [[Susan Sarandon]] in her opening soliloquy in the 1988 film ''[[Bull Durham]]'': "Bad trades are a part of baseball. I mean, who can forget Frank Robinson for Milt Pappas?"{{citation needed||date=May 2015}}

====Glory years (1966–1983)====
In the 1960s, the Orioles farm system produced an especially large number of high-quality players and coaches and laid the foundation for two decades of on-field success. This period included eighteen consecutive winning seasons (1968–1985) -- a run of success that saw the Orioles become the envy of the league, and the winningest team in baseball.

During this period, the Orioles played baseball the '''''"Oriole Way"''''', an organizational ethic best described by longtime farm hand and coach [[Cal Ripken, Sr.]]'s phrase '''"'''perfect''' practice makes perfect!"''' The ''Oriole Way'' was a belief that hard work, professionalism, and a strong understanding of fundamentals were the keys to success at the major league level. It was based on the belief that if every coach, at every level, taught the game the same way, the organization could produce "replacement parts" that could be substituted seamlessly into the big league club with little or no adjustment. Elaborations on the Oriole way include pitching coach and manager Ray Miller's maxim "Work fast, change speeds, and throw strikes" and manager Earl Weaver's maxim "Pitching, defense and three-run homers."
"
The ''"Oriole Way"'' began flourishing in 1966 after the Robinson-for-Pappas deal, as Robinson won the "Triple Crown Award". His Orioles would easily sweep the [[1966 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] in the [[1966 World Series]]. After a mediocre [[1967 Baltimore Orioles season|1967 season]], [[Hank Bauer]] would be replaced by [[Earl Weaver]] halfway into 1968. The [[1968 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] would finish second in the American League. This would only be a prelude to 1969, when the [[1969 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] won 109&nbsp;games and easily won the newly created [[American League East]] division title. [[Mike Cuellar]] shared the Cy Young Award with Detroit's [[Denny McLain]]. After sweeping [[1969 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota]] in the [[1969 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]], Baltimore was shocked by losing to the [[1969 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] in a five-game [[1969 World Series|World Series]]. The next year, [[Boog Powell]] won the MVP and the Orioles won another 108&nbsp;games. After sweeping the [[1970 Minnesota Twins season|Twins]] once again in the [[1970 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], the Orioles won the [[1970 World Series]] by defeating the [[1970 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]]' [[Big Red Machine]] in five games.

In 1971, the [[1971 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] won another division title thanks to four 20-game winners on their pitching staff (Cuellar, [[Jim Palmer]], [[Pat Dobson]], and [[Dave McNally]]). After defeating the young [[1971 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland A's]] in the [[1971 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], the Orioles would lose a heartbreaking seven-game [[1971 World Series|World Series]] to the [[1971 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]]. The [[1972 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] would miss the playoffs in 1972, but rebounded to win the division in 1973 and 1974. Each time, they would lose to Oakland in the ALCS. During this stretch, the Orioles began to phase out their veteran infield by replacing [[Davey Johnson]] and [[Brooks Robinson]] with younger stars [[Bobby Grich]] and [[Doug DeCinces]], respectively. Johnson would be dealt along with [[Johnny Oates]] to the [[Atlanta Braves]] for catcher and 1971 [[National League Rookie of the Year]] [[Earl Williams (1970s catcher)|Earl Williams]]. Although Williams had hit 63 home runs in two seasons with Atlanta, he would only hit 36 homers in two seasons with the Orioles.

In 1975, the Birds acquired slugger [[Lee May]] in a trade with Houston, and traded [[Dave McNally]], [[Rich Coggins]] and minor-league pitcher Bill Kirkpatrick to [[Montreal Expos|Montreal]] for star outfielder [[Ken Singleton]], and future 20-game winner [[Mike Torrez]]. Jim Palmer won the Cy Young Award, but the [[1975 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] lost the division title to the [[1975 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] and their mega-rookies [[Fred Lynn]] and [[Jim Rice]]. The 1976 season brought [[Reggie Jackson]] and [[Ken Holtzman]] from a trade with Oakland, but the [[1976 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] only won 88&nbsp;games. It was this season when the Orioles made a trade that brought them players such as [[Tippy Martinez]] and [[Rick Dempsey]]. This young foundation, along with the departures of the unhappy Jackson and Holtzman, would create the basis for 1977. The [[1977 Baltimore Orioles season|"No Name Orioles"]], along with Rookie of the Year [[Eddie Murray]], won 97&nbsp;games and finished tied for second place with [[1977 Boston Red Sox season|Boston]]. After finishing fourth in 1978, the [[1979 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] finally won the division in 1979 thanks to strong play from Ken Singleton and Cy Young winner [[Mike Flanagan (baseball)|Mike Flanagan]]. The Orioles defeated the [[1979 California Angels season|Angels]] in the [[1979 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], but lost to [[1979 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh]] in another [[1979 World Series|stunning World Series]]. This started a short period of heartbreak for Baltimore that would nevertheless culminate in a championship.

The [[1980 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] won 100&nbsp;games in 1980 thanks to Cy Young winner [[Steve Stone (baseball)|Steve Stone]], but the [[1980 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] won 103&nbsp;games. Although [[1981 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore]] had the best overall record in the AL East in 1981, they finished second in each half. As a result, they were out of the playoffs due to the postseason structure that year because of the [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|strike]]. The 1982 campaign saw Baltimore eliminated on the final weekend of the season by the [[1982 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]]. In an unforgettable scene, despite the season-ending loss eliminating them from the playoffs, fans stayed to honor the retiring [[Earl Weaver]], who would be succeeded by [[Joe Altobelli]]. In 1983, Altobelli would lead the Orioles to 98 wins and a division title thanks to MVP [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]]. The [[1983 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] defeated the [[1983 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] in the [[1983 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] thanks to a 10th-inning homer by [[Tito Landrum]] in the deciding game. The Orioles won the [[1983 World Series|World Series]] in five games by defeating the [[1983 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]].

During their most productive years and only World Series championships thus far, the Orioles saw three of its players named MVP: Frank Robinson in 1966; Boog Powell in 1970; and Cal Ripken, Jr. in 1983. Additionally, Brooks Robinson was named Most Valuable Player in 1964, just two years before the 1966–1983 golden era began. The pitching staff was phenomenal, with four pitchers winning six [[Cy Young Awards]] (Mike Cuellar in 1969; Jim Palmer in 1973, 1975, and 1976; Mike Flanagan in 1979; and Steve Stone in 1980). In 1971, the team's four starting pitchers, McNally, Cuellar, Palmer, and Pat Dobson, all won 20&nbsp;games, a feat that has not been replicated. In that year, the Birds went on to post a 101–61 record for their third-straight AL East title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/al/baltios/orioles.html |title=Baltimore Orioles (1954-Present) |publisher=Sportsecyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=November 23, 2012}}</ref> Also during this stretch three players were named [[American League Rookie of the Year|rookies of the year]]: [[Al Bumbry]] (1973); Eddie Murray (1977); and Cal Ripken, Jr. (1982). One might date the glory years of the Orioles dating back to 1964, which would include two third-place seasons, 1964–65, in which the Orioles won 97 and 94&nbsp;games, respectively, and a year in which third-baseman Brooks Robinson won his [[Most Valuable Player Award]] (1964). The glory years of the Orioles effectively ended when the [[1984 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]], a divisional rival at the time, went 35–5 to open the 1984 season on the way to winning the World Series, in which Hall-of-Fame pitcher Jim Palmer retired during the 1984 season.

====Final seasons at Memorial Stadium (1984–1991)====
[[Image:Baltimore Memorial Stadium 1991.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Orioles hosting one of the final games at Memorial Stadium in 1991.]]
After winning the [[1983 World Series]], the Orioles spent the next five years in steady decline, finishing 1986 in last place for the first time since the franchise moved to Baltimore. The [[1988 Baltimore Orioles season|team]] hit bottom in 1988 when it started the season 0–21, en route to 107 losses and the worst record in the majors that year. The Orioles surprised the baseball world the following year by spending most of the summer in first place until September when the [[1989 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]] overtook them and seized the AL East title on the final weekend of the regular season. The next two years were spent below the .500 mark, highlighted only by Cal Ripken, Jr. winning his second [[AL MVP Award]] in 1991. The [[1991 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] said goodbye to Memorial Stadium, the team's home for 38&nbsp;years, at the end of the 1991 campaign.

[[Image:Baltimore Orioles wordmark 1988 to 1994.png|thumb|left|150px|The Orioles wordmark from 1988 to 1994]]

====Camden Yards opens (1992–1993)====
{{main|1992 Baltimore Orioles season|1993 Baltimore Orioles season}}
Opening to much fanfare in 1992, [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]] was an instant success, spawning other retro-designed major league ballparks within the next two decades. The stadium became the site of the [[1993 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1993 All-Star Game]]. The Orioles returned to contention in those first two seasons at Camden Yards, only to finish in third place both times.

=====Angelos takes over=====
Also in 1993, with then-owner [[Eli Jacobs]] forced to divest himself of the franchise, Baltimore-based attorney [[Peter Angelos]], along with the ownership syndicate he headed, was awarded the Orioles in [[United States bankruptcy court|bankruptcy court]] in [[New York City]], returning the team to local ownership for the first time since 1979.

====Strike year (1994)====
{{main|1994 Baltimore Orioles season}}
After the 1993 season, the Orioles acquired first baseman [[Rafael Palmeiro]] from the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. The Orioles, who spent all of 1994 chasing the [[1994 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]], occupied second place in the new five-team AL East when the [[1994–95 Major League Baseball strike|players strike]], which began on August 11, forced the eventual cancellation of the season.

====Ripken breaks the streak (1995)====
[[File:2131 on the warehouse wall.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The numbers on the Orioles' warehouse changed from 2130 to 2131 to celebrate Cal Ripken, Jr. passing Lou Gehrig's consecutive games played streak.]]
{{main|1995 Baltimore Orioles season}}
The labor impasse would continue into the spring of 1995. Almost all of the major league clubs held spring training using [[strikebreaker|replacement players]], with the intention of beginning the [[1995 Major League Baseball season|season]] with them. The Orioles, whose owner was a labor union lawyer, were the lone dissenters against creating an ersatz team, choosing instead to sit out spring training and possibly the entire season. Had they fielded a substitute team, [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]]'s consecutive games streak would have been jeopardized. The replacements questions became moot when the strike was finally settled.

The Ripken countdown resumed once the season began. Ripken finally broke [[Lou Gehrig]]'s consecutive games streak of 2,130&nbsp;games in a nationally televised game on September 6. This was later voted the all-time baseball moment of the 20th century by fans from around the country in 1999. Ripken finished his streak with 2,632 straight games, finally sitting on September 20, 1998, the [[1998 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] final home game of the season against the [[1998 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] at Camden Yards.

The Orioles finished two games under .500 (71-73) in third place in [[Phil Regan (baseball)|Phil Regan]]'s only season of managing the ballclub.

====Playoff years (1996–1997)====

=====1996 season=====
{{main|1996 Baltimore Orioles season}}
Before the 1996 season, Angelos hired [[Pat Gillick]] as general manager. Given the green light to spend heavily on established talent, Gillick signed several premium players like [[B.J. Surhoff]], [[Randy Myers]], [[David Wells]] and [[Roberto Alomar]]. Under new manager [[Davey Johnson]] and on the strength of a then-major league record 257 home runs in a single season, the Orioles returned to the playoffs after a twelve-year absence by clinching the AL wild card berth. Alomar set off a firestorm in September when he spat into home plate umpire [[John Hirschbeck]]'s face during an argument in Toronto. He was later suspended for the first five games of the 1997 season, even though most wanted him banned from the postseason. After dethroning the defending American League champion [[1996 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] 3–1 in the [[1996 American League Division Series|Division Series]], the Orioles fell to the [[1996 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] 4–1 in an [[1996 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] notable for right field umpire [[Rich Garcia]]'s failure to call fan interference in the first game of the series, when 11-year-old Yankee fan [[Jeffrey Maier]] reached over the outfield wall to catch an in-play ball, which was scored as a home run for [[Derek Jeter]], tying the game at 4-4 in the eighth inning. Absent Maier's interference, it appeared as if the ball might have been off the wall or caught by right fielder [[Tony Tarasco]]. The Yankees went on to win the game in extra innings on an ensuing walk-off home run by Bernie Williams.

=====1997 season=====
{{main|1997 Baltimore Orioles season}}

The Orioles went "wire-to-wire" (first place from start to finish) in winning the AL East title in 1997. After eliminating the [[1997 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]] 3–1 in the [[1997 American League Division Series|Division Series]], the team lost again in the [[1997 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], this time to the underdog [[1997 Cleveland Indians season|Indians]] 4–2, with each Oriole loss by only a run. Johnson resigned as manager after the season, largely due to a spat with Angelos concerning Alomar's fine for missing a team function being donated to Johnson's wife's charity.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/orioles/longterm/memories/davey/articles/poorcomm.htm | work=The Washington Post|title=Poor Communication at Heart of Feud  | date=May 12, 1998}}</ref> Pitching coach [[Ray Miller (baseball manager)|Ray Miller]] replaced Johnson.

====Beginning of a downturn (1998–2002)====

=====1998 season=====
{{main|1998 Baltimore Orioles season}}

With Miller at the helm, the Orioles found themselves not only out of the playoffs, but also with a losing season. When Gillick's contract expired in 1998, it was not renewed. Angelos brought in [[Frank Wren]] to take over as GM. The Orioles added volatile slugger [[Albert Belle]], but the team's woes continued in the 1999 season, with stars like [[Rafael Palmeiro]], [[Roberto Alomar]], and [[Eric Davis (baseball)|Eric Davis]] leaving in free agency. After a second straight losing season, Angelos fired both Miller and Wren. He named [[Syd Thrift]] the new GM and brought in former Cleveland manager [[Mike Hargrove]].

=====1999 season=====
{{main|1999 Baltimore Orioles season}}

[[File:Baltimore Orioles.svg|150px|right|thumb|Logo from 1999 to 2008.]]In a rare event on March 28, 1999, the Orioles staged an [[1999 Baltimore Orioles – Cuban national baseball team exhibition series|exhibition series]] against the [[Cuba national baseball team|Cuban national team]] in [[Havana]]. The Orioles won the game 3–2 in 11 innings. They were the first Major League team to play in Cuba since 1959, when the [[1959 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] faced the [[1959 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] in an exhibition. The Cuban team visited Baltimore in May 1999. Cuba won the second game 10–6.

=====2000–2002 seasons=====
{{main|2000 Baltimore Orioles season}}
Cal Ripken, Jr. achieved his 3000th hit early in the season. A fire sale occurred late in the season, where the Orioles traded away many veterans for unproven young players and minor league prospects. The Orioles called up many of their AAA players to finish the season. The only acquired player that would have a long-term career with the organization was [[Melvin Mora]].

{{main|2001 Baltimore Orioles season}}
This was Cal Ripken, Jr.'s final season. His number (8) was retired in a ceremony before the final home game of the season.

{{main|2002 Baltimore Orioles season}}

====Post-Ripken era and downfall (2003–2011)====

=====2003–2004 seasons=====
[[File:Baltimore Orioles wordmark 1995 to 2008.png|right|thumb|This version of the script logo has been on the front of the home jerseys since 2004.]]
{{main|2003 Baltimore Orioles season|2004 Baltimore Orioles season}}
In an effort to right the Orioles' sinking ship, changes began to sweep through the organization in 2003. General manager [[Syd Thrift]] was fired and to replace him, the Orioles hired [[Jim Beattie]] as executive vice-president and [[Mike Flanagan (baseball)|Mike Flanagan]] as the vice president of baseball operations. After another losing season, manager [[Mike Hargrove]] was not retained and Yankees coach [[Lee Mazzilli]] was brought in as the new manager. The team signed powerful hitters in SS [[Miguel Tejada]], C [[Javy López]], and former Oriole 1B [[Rafael Palmeiro]]. The following season, the Orioles traded for OF [[Sammy Sosa]].

=====2005 season=====
[[File:CamdenYards 2005-05-08.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The Orioles taking on the Kansas City Royals at home in 2005.]]
{{main|2005 Baltimore Orioles season}}

The team got hot early in 2005 and jumped out in front of the AL East division, holding onto first place for 62 straight days. However, turmoil on and off the field began to take its toll as the Orioles started struggling around the All-Star break, dropping them close to the surging [[2005 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] and [[2005 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]]. Injuries to Lopez, Sosa, [[Luis Matos]], [[Brian Roberts]], and [[Larry Bigbie]] came within weeks of each other, and the team grew increasingly dissatisfied with the "band-aid" moves of the front office and manager Mazzilli to help them through this period of struggle. Various minor league players such as Single-A Frederick OF [[Jeff Fiorentino]] were brought up in place of more experienced players such as OF [[David Newhan]], who had batted .311 the previous season.

After starting the season 42–28 (.600), the Orioles finished the season with a stretch of 32–60 (.348), ending at 74–88 (.457). Only the [[2005 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] (.346) had a worse winning percentage for the season than did the Orioles for the final 92&nbsp;games. The club's major off-season acquisition, [[Sammy Sosa]], posted his worst performance in a decade, with 14 home runs and a .221 batting average. The Orioles did not attempt to re-sign him. The Orioles also allowed Palmeiro to file for free agency and publicly stated they would not re-sign him. On August 25, pitcher [[Sidney Ponson]] was arrested for DUI, and on September 1, the Orioles moved to void his contract (on a morals clause) and released him. The [[Major League Baseball Players Association]] filed a grievance on Ponson's behalf and the case was sent to arbitration and was eventually resolved.

=====2006 season=====
{{main|2006 Baltimore Orioles season}}

In the [[2006 World Baseball Classic]], the Orioles contributed more players than any other major league team, with eleven players suiting up for their home nations. [[Érik Bédard]] and [[Adam Loewen]] pitched for [[Canada national baseball team|Canada]]; [[Rodrigo López (baseball)|Rodrigo López]] and [[Gerónimo Gil]] (released before the season began by the club) played for [[Mexico national baseball team|Mexico]]; [[Daniel Cabrera]] and [[Miguel Tejada]] for the [[Dominican Republic national baseball team|Dominican Republic]]; [[Javy López]] and [[Luis Matos]] for [[Puerto Rico national baseball team|Puerto Rico]]; [[Bruce Chen]] for [[Panama national baseball team|Panama]]; [[Ramón Hernández]] for [[Venezuela national baseball team|Venezuela]]; and [[John Stephens (baseball)|John Stephens]] for [[Australia national baseball team|Australia]]. The Orioles finished the 2006 season with a record of 70 wins and 92 losses, 27&nbsp;games behind the AL East-leading [[2006 New York Yankees season|Yankees]].

=====2007 season=====
{{main|2007 Baltimore Orioles season}}

On June 18, the Orioles fired [[Sam Perlozzo]] after losing eight straight games. He was replaced on interim basis by [[Dave Trembley]]. On June 22, Miguel Tejada's consecutive-games streak came to an end due to an injury, the fifth-longest streak in major league history. [[Aubrey Huff]] became the first Oriole to hit for the cycle at home, on June 29 against the Angels. On July 7, [[Érik Bédard]] struck out 15 batters in a game against the [[2007 Texas Rangers season|Texas Rangers]] to tie a franchise record held by [[Mike Mussina]]. On July 31, 2007, [[Andy MacPhail]] named Dave Trembley as the Orioles manager through the remainder of the 2007 season, and advised him to "Keep up the good work."<ref>[http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=ap-orioles-perlozzo&prov=ap&type=lgns ] {{wayback|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=ap-orioles-perlozzo&prov=ap&type=lgns |date=20150620052653 }}</ref> Facing the [[2007 Texas Rangers season|Texas Rangers]] in a doubleheader at Camden Yards on August 22, the Orioles surrendered 30 runs in the first game-a modern-era record for a single game-in a 30–3 defeat. The Orioles led the game 3–0 after three innings of play. Sixteen of Texas' thirty runs were scored in the final two innings. The Orioles would also fall in the nightcap, 9–7.

=====2008 season=====
{{main|2008 Baltimore Orioles season}}

The Orioles began the 2008 season in a rebuilding mode under President of Baseball Operations [[Andy MacPhail]]. The Orioles traded away star players [[Miguel Tejada]] to the [[Houston Astros|Astros]] and ace [[Érik Bédard]] to the [[Seattle Mariners]] for prized prospect [[Adam Jones (baseball)|Adam Jones]], lefty reliever [[George Sherrill]], and minor league pitchers [[Kam Mickolio]], [[Chris Tillman]], and Tony Butler. The Orioles started off the first couple weeks of the season near the top of their division as players such as [[Nick Markakis]] and newcomer [[Luke Scott]] led the team offensively. Although the Orioles hovered around .500 for much of the season, they had fallen back by September and were over 20&nbsp;games behind the first place [[2008 Tampa Bay Rays season|Tampa Bay Rays]]. They finished the season losing 11 of their final 12&nbsp;games and 28 of their final 34. The team finished last for the first time since their 1988 season. After the season ended, the Orioles showcased altered uniforms, with a circular 'Maryland' patch added to the left-hand sleeve of all jerseys and the grey road jerseys displaying Baltimore across the chest for the first time since 1972.

=====2009 season=====
{{main|2009 Baltimore Orioles season}}
[[File:Nick Markakis.jpg|thumb|right|Adam Jones and Nick Markakis, Orioles v. Tampa Bay Rays, Camden Yards, April 12, 2009.]]

On June 30, the Orioles rallied to score 10 runs against [[2009 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] after facing a 10–1 deficit in the 7th inning, winning the game by 11–10, setting a Major League Baseball record for the largest comeback by a last-place team over a first-place team.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090630&content_id=5618964&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb |title=O's stage historic comeback vs. Red Sox |publisher=mlb.mlb.com |date= June 30, 2009 |accessdate= April 9, 2011}}</ref>
However, the team finished the 2009 season with 64 wins and 98 losses, making it the worst record in the 2009 American League season. Despite this, Manager [[Dave Trembley]] was re-hired for the 2010 season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20091002&content_id=7287970&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb |title=Orioles pick up option on Trembley |publisher= mlb.mlb.com |accessdate=April 9, 2011 }}</ref>
Centerfielder Adam Jones was named to the [[2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2009 All Star team]] and awarded a Gold Glove award for his defensive play.

=====2010 season=====
{{main|2010 Baltimore Orioles season}}

On April 12, the team set a club record for the lowest paid attendance in Camden Yards history, only 9,129 attended the game versus the [[2010 Tampa Bay Rays season|Tampa Bay Rays]]
<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wbaltv.com/sports/23130983/detail.html |title=Orioles Set Attendance Low, Lose To Rays – Sports News Story |publisher=wbaltv.com |accessdate=April 9, 2011}}</ref> The Orioles then went 2–16 to begin the [[2010 Major League Baseball season|season]], one of the worst openings in MLB history. For much of the first half of the season, they had the worst record in the league.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

On June 4, the Orioles replaced [[Dave Trembley]] as manager with third base coach [[Juan Samuel]] as interim manager.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wbaltv.com/r/23791247/detail.html |title=O's Fire Trembley, Samuel To Replace Him - Baltimore News Story |publisher=wbaltv.com |date=June 4, 2010 |accessdate=April 9, 2011 }}</ref> They did well at first, but then they started losing again.

Showalter's arrival produced, or coincided with, a turnaround; the Birds went 34–24 in August, September and October.

[[File:Orioles Win May 13 2010.JPG|right|thumb|The Orioles celebrate a 6–5 victory over the Mariners at Camden Yards on May 13, 2010.]]

=====2011 season=====
{{main|2011 Baltimore Orioles season}}

On February 4, the Orioles signed free agent [[Vladimir Guerrero]] to be the team's designated hitter. Guerrero hit 29 home runs and had a .300 batting average in the 2010 season with the Texas Rangers. He has a career average of .320 and 436 home runs.

The Orioles 2011 record was 69–93, the 14th consecutive losing season for the franchise dating back to 1998. The highlight of the season was their final game on September 28, when they defeated the [[2011 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] 4-3 thanks to 9th inning heroics by [[Nolan Reimold]] and [[Robert Andino]]. The Orioles victory prevented the Red Sox from earning the wild card berth as part of "[[Game 162]]", one of the most dramatic nights in Major League Baseball history. On November 8, the Orioles announced the hiring of [[Dan Duquette]] as the vice president of baseball operations (de facto GM) in the hopes of turning the corner.

====Return to success (2012-present)====

=====2012 season=====
{{main|2012 Baltimore Orioles season}}

The Orioles finished the first half of the 2012 season with a winning record for only the second time since 1998, with a record of 45-40 before the All-Star break. On May 6, the Orioles played a 17-inning game against the [[2012 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]], the first game since 1925 in which both teams used a position player as a pitcher. The Orioles won that game, and designated hitter [[Chris Davis (baseball)|Chris Davis]] received the win. The Orioles won their 81st game on September 13, ending the streak of 14 straight years with a losing record, as well as ensuring that the team would spend the entire year with a record of .500 or higher. On September 16, they won their 82nd game, securing the first season with a winning record since 1997.

On September 21, closer [[Jim Johnson (right-handed pitcher)|Jim Johnson]] earned his 46th save of the season, setting a new Orioles franchise record for saves by one pitcher in a single season. It was previously held by [[Randy Myers]], who had 45 saves in 1997. Johnson became the tenth player to record 50 saves in Major League history. He finished the regular season with 51 saves.

With the win against the [[Boston Red Sox]] on September 30 and the loss of the [[2012 Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim season|Los Angeles Angels]] to the [[2012 Texas Rangers season|Texas Rangers]] in the second game of a double header, the Orioles clinched a playoff berth. This season marked the Orioles return to postseason play.

The Orioles finished the regular season in second place in the AL East with a record of 93-69, reversing the 69-93 record from the previous year. Despite a poor run differential (+7, the lowest of all playoff teams in 2012), they benefited from a 29-9 record in games decided by one run and a 16-2 record in extra-inning games. They went on the road to face the team that finished first in the Wild Card race, the Texas Rangers for a [[2012 American League Wild Card Game|one-game playoff series]] on October 5, winning 5-1 to advance to the [[2012 American League Division Series|ALDS]] against the [[2012 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] on October 7.

The season was also distinctive for the fact that Orioles became the only team in MLB history, since 1900, never to have lost a game due to an opponent's walk-off hit.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Despite a regular season of avoiding walk-off losses, they lost in Game 3 of the ALDS when Yankee [[Raúl Ibañez]] hit his own record-setting, game-winning home run in the bottom of the 12th inning. The Orioles would lose the 2012 [[American League Division Series]] in five games.

=====2013 season=====
{{main|2013 Baltimore Orioles season}}
During the home opener on April 5, first baseman [[Chris Davis (baseball)|Chris Davis]] set a new MLB record with 16 RBI's during the first four games of a season, as well as becoming the fourth player ever to hit home runs in the first four games, including a grand slam in the fourth. On September 13, Davis hit his 50th home run of the season, against the [[2013 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]], tying [[Brady Anderson]] for the most home runs in Orioles history. Davis would break Anderson's record four days later against the [[2013 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]]. His 51st home run also tied Anderson's record of 92 extra-base hits in a single season, a record he would again break four days later. Davis would go on to finish the season with 53 home runs.

On September 18, the Orioles played their 114th errorless game of the season, setting a new MLB record for the most errorless games in one season since 1900.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130919&content_id=61061100&vkey=news_bal&c_id=bal |title=Orioles set errorless game record in victory |last=Mastrodonato |first=Jason |date=September 18, 2013 |accessdate=September 19, 2013}}</ref> They played 119&nbsp;games without an error, ending on September 27.

On September 20, the Orioles played the [[2013 Tampa Bay Rays season|Tampa Bay Rays]] in an 18 inning game that lasted 6&nbsp;hours, 54&nbsp;minutes, a new record for the longest game in terms of time for both franchises, as well as innings for the Rays. The Rays won 5-4.

While the Orioles would ultimately miss the playoffs in 2013, they finished with a record of 85-77, tying the [[2013 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] for third place in the AL East. By posting winning records in 2012 and 2013, the Orioles achieved the feat of back-to-back winning seasons for the first time since 1996 and 1997.

=====2014 season=====
{{main|2014 Baltimore Orioles season}}
On September 16, the Orioles clinched the division for the first time since 1997 with a win against the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] as well as making it back to the postseason for the second time in three years. The Orioles finished the 2014 season with a 96-66 record and went on to sweep the Detroit Tigers in the ALDS.  In doing so they defeated three former Cy Young winners in Max Scherzer, Justin Verlander and David Price. They were then in turn swept by the [[Kansas City Royals]] in the ALCS.

=====2015 season=====

On April 26, the Orioles scored 18 runs against the [[Boston Red Sox]], the most runs they had scored in a single game, since they defeated the [[Cleveland Indians]] 18-9<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/scoreboard/20060419.html|title=Major League Baseball : Scoreboard|work=mlb.com|accessdate=June 19, 2015}}</ref> on April 19, 2006.

==Uniform==
[[File:ALE-Uniform-Orioles.png|thumb|The 2012 uniforms. Left to right: Home, Away, Saturday (away with gray pants), Friday (away with gray pants.).]]
The Orioles' home uniform is white with the word "Orioles" written across the chest. The road uniform is gray with the word "Baltimore" written across the chest. A long campaign of several decades was waged by numerous fans and sportswriters to return the name of the city to the "away" jerseys which was used since the 1950s and had been formerly dropped during the 1970s era of [[Edward Bennett Williams]] when the ownership was continuing to market the team also to fans in the nations' capital region after the moving of the former [[Washington Senators (1961–71)|Washington Senators]] in 1971. After several decades, approximately 20% of the teams' attendance came from the metro Washington area. An alternate uniform is black with the word "Orioles" written across the chest. The Orioles wear their black alternate jerseys for Friday night games with the alternate "O's" cap, whether at home or on the road; the cartoon bird batting helmet is still used with this uniform (see description on home and road design).

For 2012, the team unveiled its new uniforms. There was a change to the cap insignia, with the cartoon Oriole returning. Home caps are white in front and black at the back with an orange bill, while the road caps are all black with an orange bill. The Orioles also introduced a new alternate orange uniform to be worn on Saturday home games throughout the 2012 season.

In 2013, ESPN ran a "Battle of the Uniforms" contest between all 30 Major League Clubs. Despite using a ranking system that had the Orioles as a #13 seed, the Birds beat the #1 seed Cardinals in the championship round.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/9293168/orioles-win-title|title=Battle of the Uniforms:  Orioles win title|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=June 19, 2015}}</ref>

On June 27, 2014, the Orioles announced since their win in New York against the [[New York Yankees]] they will wear their 'new orange' jerseys every Saturday for the rest of the [[2014 Baltimore Orioles season|2014 season]] both home and away. They have since continued to wear the orange jerseys on select Saturday road games.

===Radio===
In Baltimore, Orioles games on radio can be heard over [[WJZ-FM]] (105.7&nbsp;FM, The Fan). [[Fred Manfra]] and [[Joe Angel]] alternate as [[play-by-play]] announcers. WJZ-FM also feeds the games to  a [[Baltimore Orioles Radio Network| network]] of 36 stations, covering Washington, D.C. and all or portions of [[Maryland]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Delaware]], [[Virginia]], [[West Virginia]], and [[North Carolina]].

The Orioles have had their games broadcast on WBAL for much of the team's history in Baltimore over three separate stints (1957 to 1978, 1988 to 2006, and 2011 to 2014). Previous radio flagships for the Orioles have been [[WCBM]] (680 AM) from 1954 to 1956, and again for the 1987 season; WFBR (1300 AM, now [[WJZ (AM)|WJZ]]) from 1979 through 1986; and [[WJZ-FM]] 105.7 The Fan (105.7 FM) from 2007 through 2010, and 2015 through the present.

===Television===
The [[Mid-Atlantic Sports Network]] (MASN), co-owned by the Orioles and the Washington Nationals, is the team's exclusive television broadcaster. MASN airs almost the entire slate of regular season games. Some exceptions include [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Saturday afternoon games]] on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[WBFF]] or ''[[Major League Baseball on ESPN|Sunday Night Baseball]]'' on [[ESPN]]. Many MASN telecasts in conflict with Nationals' game telecasts air on an alternate MASN2 feed. MASN also produces an over-the-air package of games for broadcast locally by [[CBS]]–owned [[WJZ-TV]] (channel 13); these broadcasts are branded as '''"O's TV"'''. Veteran sportscaster [[Gary Thorne]] is the current lead television announcer, with [[Jim Hunter (sportscaster)|Jim Hunter]] as his backup along with Hall of Fame member and former Orioles pitcher [[Jim Palmer]] and former Oriole infielder [[Mike Bordick]] as color analysts, who almost always work separately. All telecasts on MASN and WJZ-TV are shown in [[High-definition television|high-definition]].

As part of the settlement of a television broadcast rights dispute with [[Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic]], the Orioles severed their Comcast ties at the end of the 2006 season. Comcast SportsNet had been the Orioles' cable partner since 1984, when it was Home Team Sports.

WJZ-TV has been the Orioles' broadcast TV home since 1994. The station has previously carried the team from their arrival in Baltimore in 1954 through 1978; in the first four seasons, WJZ-TV shared coverage with Baltimore's other two stations, [[WMAR-TV]] and [[WBAL-TV]]. The games moved to WMAR from 1979 through 1993 before returning to WJZ-TV.  From 1994 to 2009, some Orioles games aired on [[WNUV]].

Six former Oriole franchise radio announcers have received the Hall of Fame's [[Ford C. Frick Award]] for excellence in broadcasting: [[Chuck Thompson]] (who was also the voice of the old NFL [[History of the Baltimore Colts|Baltimore Colts]]); [[Jon Miller]] (now with the [[San Francisco Giants]]); [[Ernie Harwell]], [[Herb Carneal]]; [[Bob Murphy (announcer)|Bob Murphy]] and [[Harry Caray]] (as a St. Louis Browns announcer in the 1940s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.paperofrecord.com/paper_view.asp?PaperId=834&RecordId=1&PageId=7750536&iZyNetId={2E6BBCCF-5CD0-46CC-A586-07221F6521B4}&iOrder=2&iOrderDir=0&iCurrentBlock=1 |title=About Paper of Record |publisher=paperofrecord.com |accessdate= April 9, 2011 }}</ref>).

Other former Baltimore announcers include [[Josh Lewin]] (currently with [[New York Mets]]), [[Bill O'Donnell (sportscaster)|Bill O'Donnell]], [[Tom Marr]], Scott Garceau, [[Mel Proctor]], [[Michael Reghi]], former major league catcher [[Buck Martinez]] (now [[Toronto Blue Jays]] play-by-play), and former Oriole players including Brooks Robinson, pitcher [[Mike Flanagan (baseball)|Mike Flanagan]] and outfielder [[John Lowenstein]]. In 1991, the Orioles experimented with longtime TV writer/producer [[Ken Levine (TV personality)|Ken Levine]] as a play-by-play broadcaster. Levine was best noted for his work on TV shows such as ''[[Cheers]]'' and ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', but only lasted one season in the Orioles broadcast booth.

==Musical traditions==

==="O!"===
Since its introduction at games by the "Roar from 34", led by [[Wild Bill Hagy]] and others, in the late 1970s, it has been a tradition at Orioles games for fans to yell out the "Oh" in the line "Oh, say does that Star-Spangled Banner yet wave" in "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]". "The Star-Spangled Banner" has special meaning to Baltimore historically, as it was written during the [[Battle of Baltimore]] in the [[War of 1812]] by [[Francis Scott Key]], a Baltimorean. "O" is not only short for "Oriole", but the vowel is also a stand-out aspect of the [[Baltimorese|Baltimorean accent]].

The tradition is often carried out at other sporting events, both professional or amateur, and even sometimes at non-sporting events where the anthem is played, throughout the [[Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area|Baltimore/Washington area]] and beyond. Fans in Norfolk, Virginia, chanted "O!" even before the [[Norfolk Tides|Tides]] became an Orioles affiliate. The practice caught some attention in the spring of 2005, when fans performed the "O!" cry at [[Washington Nationals]] games at [[RFK Stadium]]. The "O!" chant is also common at sporting events for the various [[Maryland Terrapins]] teams at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]]. At [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]]'s induction into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]], the crowd, comprising mostly Orioles fans, carried out the "O!" tradition during [[Tony Gwynn]]'s daughter's rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner". Additionally, a faint but audible "O!" could be heard on the television broadcast of Barack Obama's pre-inaugural visit to Baltimore as the National Anthem played before his entrance. A resounding "O!" bellowed from the nearly 30,000 Ravens fans that attended the November 21, 2010 away game at the [[Carolina Panthers]]' [[Bank of America Stadium]] in Charlotte, North Carolina.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Edward|title='It was like a home game' vs. Panthers, said Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-11-22/sports/bs-sp-ravens-notebook-1122-20101121_1_ravens-quarterback-joe-flacco-ed-reed-panthers-fans|work=The Baltimore Sun|accessdate=May 28, 2011}}</ref>

==="Thank God I'm a Country Boy"===
It has been an Orioles tradition since 1975 to play [[John Denver]]'s "[[Thank God I'm a Country Boy]]" during the [[seventh inning stretch]].

In the edition of July 5, 2007 of Baltimore's weekly sports publication ''Press Box'', an article by Mike Gibbons covered the details of how this tradition came to be.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.pressboxonline.com/story.cfm?id=2189 |title=Baltimore’s Seventh-Inning Tradition Within a Tradition |date=July 5, 2007 |first=Mike |last=Gibbons |publisher= pressboxonline.com |accessdate=April 9, 2011 }}</ref> During "Thank God I'm a Country Boy", Charlie Zill, then an usher, would put on overalls, a straw hat, and false teeth and dance around the club level section (244) that he tended to. He also has an orange violin that spins for the fiddle solos. He went by the name Zillbilly and had done the skit from the 1999 season until shortly before he died in early 2013. During a nationally televised game on September 20, 1997, Denver himself danced to the song atop the Orioles' dugout, one of his final public appearances before dying in a plane crash three weeks later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-10-14/features/1997287024_1_orioles-dugout-country-boy-fans |title=John Denver At Camden Yards &#124; 7th-inning stretch belonged to Denver Orioles: Time after time, 'Thank God I'm a Country Boy' got the stadium rocking. And when the man himself joined in, it was magic. - Baltimore Sun |publisher=Articles.baltimoresun.com |date=October 14, 1997 |accessdate=November 23, 2012}}</ref>

==="Orioles Magic" and other songs===
Songs from notable games in the team's history include "[[One Moment in Time]]" for Cal Ripken's record-breaking game in 1995, as well as the theme from ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'', "There You'll Be" by [[Faith Hill]], during his final game in 2001. The theme from ''[[Field of Dreams]]'' was played at the last game at Memorial Stadium in 1991, and the song "Magic to Do" from the stage musical ''[[Pippin (musical)|Pippin]]'' was used that season to commemorate "Orioles Magic" on 33rd Street. During the Orioles' heyday in the 1970s, a club song, appropriately titled "Orioles Magic (Feel It Happen)", was composed by Walt Woodward,<ref name=BaltSun>{{cite news |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/videogallery/81640911/Entertainment/Orioles-Magic-song-by-Walt-Woodward |title= Orioles Magic (Feel It Happen) |publisher= The Baltimore Sun |author= Walt Woodward  |date=  1970 |accessdate= October 12, 2014}}</ref> and played when the team ran out until Opening Day of 2008. Since then, the song (a favorite among all fans, who appreciated its references to [[Wild Bill Hagy]] and [[Earl Weaver]]) is only played (along with a video featuring several Orioles stars performing the song) after wins. Also it's been a tradition to play Y.M.C.A by The Village People during pitching changes and during the late innings of a game.

===The First Army Band===
During the Orioles' final homestand of the season, it is a tradition to display a replica of the 15-star, 15-stripe [[American flag]] at Camden Yards. Prior to 1992, the 15-star, 15-stripe flag flew from Memorial Stadium's center-field flagpole in place of the 50-star, 13-stripe flag during the final homestand. Since the move to Camden Yards, the former flag has been displayed on the batters' eye. During the Orioles' final home game of the season, [[The United States Army Field Band]] from [[Fort Meade]] performs the [[Star-Spangled Banner|National Anthem]] prior to the start of the game. The Band has also played the National Anthem at the finales of three [[World Series]] in which the Orioles played in: [[1970 World Series|1970]], [[1971 World Series|1971]] and [[1979 World Series|1979]]. They are introduced as the "First Army Band" during the pregame ceremonies.

==PA announcer==
For 23&nbsp;years, [[Rex Barney]] was the [[Public address|PA announcer]] for the Orioles. His voice became a fixture of both Memorial Stadium and Camden Yards, and his expression "Give that fan a contract", uttered whenever a fan caught a [[foul ball]], was one of his trademarks&nbsp;– the other being his distinct "Thank Yooooou..." following every announcement (he was also known on occasion to say "Give that fan an error" after a dropped foul ball). Barney died on August 12, 1997, and in his honor that night's game at Camden Yards against the Oakland Athletics was held without a public–address announcer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/chronology/1997AUGUST.stm |title=August 1997 |publisher=baseballlibrary.com |accessdate=November 23, 2012 }}</ref>

Barney was replaced as Camden Yards' PA announcer by Dave McGowan, who held the position until December 2011.

Lifelong Orioles fan and former [[MLB Fan Cave]] resident Ryan Wagner is the current PA announcer after being chosen out of a field of more than 670 applicants in the 2011–2012 offseason.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://baltimore.orioles.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120221&content_id=26781434&vkey=pr_bal&c_id=bal |title=Ryan Wagner selected as new voice of Oriole Park &#124; orioles.com: News |publisher=Baltimore.orioles.mlb.com |date=February 21, 2012 |accessdate=November 23, 2012}}</ref>

==Postseason appearances==
Of the eight original American League teams, the Orioles were the last of the eight to win the [[World Series]], doing so in [[1966 World Series|1966]] with its four–game sweep of the heavily favored [[1966 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]]. When the Orioles were the St. Louis Browns, they played in only one World Series, the [[1944 World Series|1944 matchup]] against their Sportsman's Park tenants, the [[1944 St. Louis Cardinals season|Cardinals]]. The Orioles won the first-ever [[American League Championship Series]] in 1969, and in 2012 the Orioles beat the Texas Rangers in the inaugural American League [[Major League Baseball wild-card game|Wild Card game]], where for the first time two Wild Card teams faced each other during postseason play.
