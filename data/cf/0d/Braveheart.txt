Gibson portrays [[William Wallace]], a 13th-century Scottish warrior who led the Scots in the [[First War of Scottish Independence]] against King [[Edward I of England]]. The story is based on [[Blind Harry]]'s [[epic poem]] ''[[The Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant Campioun Schir William Wallace]]'' and was [[film adaptation|adapted]] for the screen by [[Randall Wallace]].

The film was nominated for ten [[Academy Award]]s at the [[68th Academy Awards]] and won five: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Makeup|Best Makeup]], [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].

== Plot ==
In 1280, [[Edward I of England|King Edward "Longshanks"]] ([[Patrick McGoohan]]) invades and conquers [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] following the death of [[Alexander III of Scotland]], who left no heir to the throne. Young William Wallace (James Robinson) witnesses Longshanks' treachery, survives the deaths of his father ([[Sean Lawlor]]) and brother (Sandy Nelson), and is taken abroad on a [[pilgrimage]] throughout Europe by his paternal Uncle Argyle ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]]), where he is educated. Years later, Longshanks grants his noblemen land and privileges in Scotland, including ''Prima Nocte'' (or ''[[droit du seigneur]]'', the right of the lord to have sex with female subjects on their wedding nights). Meanwhile, Wallace ([[Mel Gibson]]) returns to Scotland and is reunited with his childhood friend, Hamish Campbell ([[Brendan Gleeson]]). Wallace falls in love with his other childhood friend, Murron MacClannough ([[Catherine McCormack]]); they marry in secret so she will not have to spend the night with the local English lord. Wallace rescues Murron from being raped by English soldiers, but as she fights off their second attempt, Murron is captured and publicly executed. In retribution, Wallace leads his clan to [[Action at Lanark|slaughter the English garrison]] in his hometown and send the occupying garrison at [[Lanark]] back to England.

This enrages Longshanks, who orders his son, [[Edward II of England|Prince Edward]] ([[Peter Hanly]]), to stop Wallace by any means necessary. Wallace rebels against the English, and as his legend spreads, hundreds of Scots from the surrounding clans join him. Wallace then leads his army to victory at [[Battle of Stirling Bridge|Stirling]] and then sacks the city of [[York]], killing Longshanks' nephew ([[Richard Leaf]]) and sending his decapitated head to the king. Wallace seeks the assistance of [[Robert the Bruce]] ([[Angus Macfadyen]]), the son of nobleman [[Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale|Robert the Elder]] ([[Ian Bannen]]) and a contender for the Scottish crown. Robert is dominated by his father, who wishes to secure the throne for his son by submitting to the English. Worried by the threat of the rebellion, Longshanks sends his son's wife, [[Isabella of France]] ([[Sophie Marceau]]), to try to negotiate with Wallace, hoping Wallace will kill her and thus draw the French king to declare war. Wallace refuses the bribe sent with Isabella by Longshanks, but after meeting him in person, Isabella becomes enamored of Wallace. Meanwhile, Longshanks prepares an army to invade Scotland.

Warned of the coming invasion by Isabella, Wallace implores the Scottish nobility that immediate action is needed to counter the threat and to take back the country. Leading the English army himself, Longshanks confronts the Scots at [[Falkirk]] where noblemen Lochlan (John Murtagh) and Mornay ([[Alun Armstrong]]) betray Wallace. The Scots lose the [[Battle of Falkirk|battle]], and Morrison ([[Tommy Flanagan (actor)|Tommy Flanagan]]) and Campbell, senior ([[James Cosmo]]) die at the battle. As Wallace charges toward the departing Longshanks on horseback, he is intercepted by one of the king's lancers, who turns out to be Robert. Remorseful, Robert gets Wallace to safety before the English can capture him. Wallace kills Lochlan and Mornay for their betrayal, and wages a guerrilla war against the English for the next seven years, assisted by Isabella, with whom he eventually has an affair. Robert, intending to join Wallace and commit troops to the war, sets up a meeting with him in [[Edinburgh]]. However, Robert's father has conspired with other nobles to capture and hand over Wallace to the English. Learning of his treachery, Robert disowns his father. Isabella exacts revenge on the now terminally ill Longshanks by telling him she is pregnant with Wallace's child, and intent on ending Longshanks' line and ruling in his son's place.

In [[London]], Wallace is brought before an English magistrate ([[David Gant]]), tried for [[high treason]], and condemned to public torture and beheading. Even whilst being [[hanged, drawn and quartered]], Wallace refuses to submit to the king. As cries for mercy come from the watching crowd deeply moved by the Scotsman's valor, the magistrate offers him one final chance, asking him only to utter the word, "Mercy", and be granted a quick death. Wallace instead shouts, "Freedom!", and the judge orders his death. Moments before being [[decapitation|decapitated]], Wallace sees a vision of Murron in the crowd, smiling at him.

In 1314, Robert, now Scotland's king, leads a Scottish army before a ceremonial line of English troops on the fields of [[Battle of Bannockburn|Bannockburn]], where he is to formally accept English rule. As he begins to ride toward the English, he stops and invokes Wallace's memory, imploring his men to fight with him as they did with Wallace. Robert then leads his army into battle against the stunned English, winning the Scots their freedom.

== Production ==
[[File:Scott Neeson on the set of Braveheart, 1995.jpg|thumb|Gibson (right) on set with 20th Century Fox executive [[Scott Neeson]]]]

Gibson's production company, [[Icon Productions]], had difficulty raising enough money even if he were to star in the film. [[Warner Bros.]] was willing to fund the project on the condition that Gibson sign for another ''[[Lethal Weapon]]'' sequel, which he refused. [[Paramount Pictures]] only agreed to American and Canadian distribution of ''Braveheart'' after [[20th Century Fox]] partnered for international rights.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117926430.html | title = Mel tongue-ties studios| author = Michael Fleming | publisher = |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]] | date = 25 July 2005}}</ref> The production budget has been estimated by IMDb at US$72 million.

While the crew spent six weeks shooting on location in Scotland, the major battle scenes were shot in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] using members of the [[Reserve Defence Forces|Irish Army Reserve]] as extras. To lower costs, Gibson had the same extras, up to 1,600 in some scenes, portray both armies. The reservists had been given permission to grow beards and swapped their military uniforms for medieval garb.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unison.ie/meath_chronicle/stories.php3?ca=41&si=1031035&issue_id=9666 |title=''Braveheart'' 10th Chance To Boost Tourism In Trim|work= Meath Chronicle|date= August 28, 2003|accessdate= April 30, 2007}}</ref>

According to Gibson, he was inspired by the big screen epics he had loved as a child, [[William Wyler]]'s ''[[The Big Country]]'' (1958) and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' (1960).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

''Braveheart'' was shot in the [[anamorphic format]] with [[Panavision]] C- and E-Series lenses.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Chris Probst | title=Cinematic Transcendence| journal=[[American Cinematographer]] | publisher=[[American Society of Cinematographers]] | volume=77 | issue=6 | page=76 | location=[[Los Angeles, California]], United States | date=1 June 1996 | issn=0002-7928 }}</ref>

Gibson toned down the film's battle scenes to avoid an [[NC-17]] rating from the [[MPAA]]; the final version was rated R for "brutal [[medieval warfare]]".<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.filmratings.com/ | title = Reasons for Movie Ratings (CARA)

In addition to English, the film's primary language, [[French language|French]], [[Latin]], and [[Scottish Gaelic]] are spoken.

The score has gone on to be one of the most commercially successful soundtracks of all time. It received considerable acclaim from film critics and audiences and was nominated for a number of awards, including the [[Academy Award]], [[Saturn Award]], [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]], and [[Golden Globe Award]].

=== Effect on tourism ===

In 1996, the year after the film was released, the annual three-day "Braveheart Conference" at [[Stirling Castle]] attracted fans of ''Braveheart'', increasing the conference's attendance to 167,000 from 66,000 in the previous year.<ref>{{cite book | last=Zumkhawala-Cook | first=Richard | year=2008 | title=Scotland as We Know It: Representations of National Identity in Literature, Film and Popular Culture | publisher=McFarland | isbn=978-0-7864-4031-3 | page=147 }}</ref> In the following year, research on visitors to the [[Stirling]] area indicated that 55% of the visitors had seen ''Braveheart''.

Of all visitors who saw ''Braveheart'', 39% said the film influenced in part their decision to visit Stirling, and 19% said the film was one of the main reasons for their visit.<ref>{{cite book | last1=MacLellan | first1=Rory | last2=Smith | first2=Ronnie | year=1998 | title=Tourism in Scotland | publisher=Cengage Learning EMEA | isbn=978-1-86152-089-0 | page=230 }}</ref> In the same year, a tourism report said that the "''Braveheart'' effect" earned Scotland ₤7 million to ₤15 million in tourist revenue, and the report led to various national organizations encouraging international film productions to take place in Scotland.<ref>{{cite book | last=Martin-Jones | first=David | year=2009 | title=Scotland: Global Cinema – Genres, Modes, and Identities | publisher=Edinburgh University Press | isbn=978-0-7486-3391-3 | page=14 }}</ref>

The film generated huge interest in [[Scotland]] and in [[Scottish history]], not only around the world, but also in Scotland itself. Fans came from all over the world to see the places in Scotland where William Wallace fought, also to the places in Scotland and Ireland used as locations in the film. At a ''Braveheart'' Convention in 1997, held in [[Stirling]] the day after the [[Scottish Parliament#History|Scottish Devolution]] vote and attended by 200 delegates from around the world, ''Braveheart'' author Randall Wallace, Seoras Wallace of the Wallace Clan, Scottish historian David Ross and Bláithín FitzGerald from Ireland gave lectures on various aspects of the film. Several of the actors also attended including James Robinson (Young William), Andrew Weir (Young Hamish), Julie Austin (the young bride) and Mhairi Calvey (Young Murron).

=== Awards and honors ===

''Braveheart'' was nominated for many awards during the 1995 Oscar season, though it wasn't viewed by many as a major contender such as ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'', ''[[Il Postino: The Postman]]'', ''[[Leaving Las Vegas]]'', ''[[Sense and Sensibility (film)|Sense and Sensibility]]'', and ''[[The Usual Suspects]]''. It wasn't until after the film won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director]] at the [[53rd Golden Globe Awards]] that it was viewed as a serious Oscar contender. When the nominations were announced for the [[68th Academy Awards]], ''Braveheart'' received ten Academy Award nominations, and a month later, won five.<ref name="Oscars1996">{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/68th-winners.html |title=The 68th Academy Awards (1996) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=2011-10-23|work=oscars.org|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6AscWv4DN |archivedate = 2012-09-23|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

[[File:BraveStatue 1200x1600.jpg|thumb|right|Tom Church's ''Freedom'' statue.]]
In 1997, a 12-ton [[sandstone]] statue depicting Mel Gibson as William Wallace in ''Braveheart'' was placed in the car park of the [[Wallace Monument]] near [[Stirling]], [[Scotland]]. The statue, which was the work of Tom Church, a [[Stonemasonry|monumental mason]] from [[Brechin]],<ref name="courer">{{cite web|url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2009/10/16/newsstory13954661t0.asp |work=[[The Courier]] |title=Wallace statue back at home of sculptor|accessdate=17 October 2009|date=16 October 2009}}</ref> included the word "Braveheart" on Wallace's shield.

After repairs were made, the statue was encased in a cage every night to prevent further vandalism. This only incited more calls for the statue to be removed, as it then appeared that the Gibson/Wallace figure was imprisoned. The statue was described as "among the most loathed pieces of public art in Scotland".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/williamwallace/They-may-take-our-lives.2565370.jp |title=They may take our lives but they won't take Freedom |author=Kevin Hurley |work=[[Scotland on Sunday]] |date=19 September 2004 |accessdate=16 October 2009}}</ref> In 2008, the statue was returned to its sculptor to make room for a new visitor centre being built at the foot of the Wallace Monument.<ref name="bbc_statue_removed">{{cite news |title=Wallace statue back with sculptor |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/tayside_and_central/8310614.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=16 October 2009 |accessdate=16 October 2009}}</ref>

== Historical inaccuracy ==

Randall Wallace, who wrote the screenplay, has acknowledged [[Blind Harry]]'s 15th century [[epic poem]] ''The Acts and Deeds of Sir William Wallace, Knight of Elderslie'' as a major inspiration for the film.<ref name="anderson">{{cite book|author=Anderson, Lin| title=Braveheart: From Hollywood to Holyrood| publisher=Luath Press Ltd|date=2005|page= 27}}</ref> In defending his script, Randall Wallace has said, "Is Blind Harry true?

Sharon Krossa notes that the film contains numerous historical errors, beginning with the wearing of [[belted plaid]] by Wallace and his men. In that period "no Scots ... wore belted plaids (let alone [[kilt]]s of any kind)." Moreover, when Highlanders finally did begin wearing the belted plaid, it was not "in the rather bizarre style depicted in the film". She compares the inaccuracy to "a film about Colonial America showing the colonial men wearing 20th century business suits, but with the jackets worn back-to-front instead of the right way around."<ref>{{cite web| last = Krossa| first = Sharon L.| title = Braveheart Errors: An Illustration of Scale| url=http://medievalscotland.org/scotbiblio/bravehearterrors.shtml| accessdate = 2009-06-15 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20131009105036/http://medievalscotland.org:80/scotbiblio/bravehearterrors.shtml

In the DVD audio commentary of ''Braveheart'', Mel Gibson acknowledges many of the historical inaccuracies but defends his choices as director, noting that the way events were portrayed in the film was much more "cinematically compelling" than the historical fact or conventional mythos.

=== ''Jus primae noctis'' ===
[[Edward I of England|Edward Longshanks]], King of England, is shown invoking ''[[Droit du seigneur|Jus primae noctis]]'', allowing the Lord of a medieval estate to take the virginity of his serfs' maiden daughters on their wedding nights. Critical medieval scholarship regards this supposed right as a myth, "the simple reason why we are dealing with a myth here rests in the surprising fact that practically all writers who make any such claims have never been able or willing to cite any trustworthy source, if they have any."<ref>{{cite book|last=Classen|first=Albrecht|title=The medieval chastity belt: a myth-making process|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=r_hncxYRQIoC&pg=PA147|year=2007|publisher=Macmillan|page=151|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130609130238/http://books.google.com/books?id=r_hncxYRQIoC&pg=PA147|archivedate=2013-06-09|isbn=9781403975584}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/weddings/customs/droit.asp |title=Urban legends website |publisher=Snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-20}}</ref>

=== Occupation and independence ===
The film suggests Scotland had been under English occupation for some time, at least during Wallace’s childhood, and in the run-up to the [[Battle of Falkirk]] Wallace says to the younger Bruce, “[W]e'll have what none of us have [''sic''] ever had before, a country of our own.” In fact Scotland had been [[Wars of Scottish Independence#Background|invaded by England]] only the year before Wallace's rebellion; prior to the death of [[Alexander III of Scotland|King Alexander III]] it had been a fully separate kingdom.<ref name=traquair/>

=== Portrayal of William Wallace ===
As [[John Shelton Lawrence]] and [[Robert Jewett]] write, "Because [William] Wallace is one of Scotland's most important national heroes and because he lived in the very distant past, much that is believed about him is probably the stuff of legend. But there is a factual strand that historians agree to", summarized from Scots scholar [[Matt Ewart]]:
{{Quote|Wallace was born into the gentry of Scotland; his father lived until he was 18, his mother until his 24th year; he killed the sheriff of [[Lanark]] when he was 27, apparently after the murder of his wife; he led a group of commoners against the English in a very successful battle at Stirling in 1297, temporarily receiving appointment as [[Guardian of Scotland|guardian]]; Wallace's reputation as a military leader was ruined in the same year of 1297, leading to his resignation as guardian; he spent several years of exile in France before being captured by the English at [[Glasgow]], this resulting in his trial for treason and his cruel execution.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lawrence |first1=John Shelton |last2=Jewett |first2=Robert |title=The Myth of the American Superhero |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-8028-4911-3 |page=163}}</ref> }}

[[Canitz|A.E. Christa Canitz]] writes about the historical William Wallace further: "[He] was a younger son of the Scottish gentry, usually accompanied by his own chaplain, well-educated, and eventually, having been appointed [[Guardian of Scotland|Guardian of the Kingdom of Scotland]], engaged in diplomatic correspondence with the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic cities]] of [[Free City of Lübeck|Lübeck]] and [[History of Hamburg|Hamburg]]". She finds that in ''Braveheart'', "any hint of his descent from the lowland gentry (i.e., the lesser nobility) is erased, and he is presented as an economically and politically marginalized Highlander and 'a farmer'—as one with the common peasant, and with a strong spiritual connection to the land which he is destined to liberate."<ref name="Canitz">{{cite book | year=2005 | last=Canitz | first=A.

Brewer |pages=127–142 | isbn=978-1-84384-012-1 }}</ref>

[[Colin McArthur]] writes that ''Braveheart'' "constructs Wallace as a kind of modern, [[nationalist]] [[guerrilla]] leader in a period half a millennium before the appearance of nationalism on the historical stage as a concept under which disparate classes and interests might be mobilised within a nation state."  Writing about ''Braveheart''{{'}}s "omissions of verified historical facts", McArthur notes that Wallace made "overtures to Edward I seeking less severe treatment after his defeat at Falkirk", as well as "the well-documented fact of Wallace's having resorted to [[conscription]] and his willingness to hang those who refused to serve."<ref>{{cite book |last=McArthur |first=Colin |year=1998 |chapter=''Braveheart'' and the Scottish Aesthetic Dementia |editor-first=Tony |editor-last=Barta |title=Screening the Past: Film and the Representation of History |publisher=Praeger |pages=167–187  |isbn=978-0-275-95402-4}}</ref>  Canitz posits that depicting "such lack of class solidarity" as the conscriptions and related hangings "would contaminate the movie's image of Wallace as the morally irreproachable ''[[primus inter pares]]'' among his peasant fighters."<ref name="Canitz"/>

=== Portrayal of Isabella of France ===
[[Isabella of France]] is shown having an affair with Wallace after the [[Battle of Falkirk]]. She later tells Edward I she is pregnant, implying that her son, [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], was a product of the affair. In reality, Isabella was three years old and living in France at the time of the Battle of Falkirk, was not married to Edward II until he was already king, and Edward III was born seven years after Wallace died.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Ewan | first=Elizabeth | date=October 1995 | title=Braveheart |journal=The American Historical Review | publisher=Indiana University Press | location=Bloomington | volume=100 |issue=4 | pages=1219–21 | issn=0002-8762 | oclc=01830326 | doi=10.2307/2168219}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last=White | first=Caroline | title=The 10 most historically inaccurate movies | publisher=The Times | url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article6738785.ece | date=4 August 2009 | accessdate=2009-08-05 | location=London | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110615070116/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article6738785.ece | archivedate=15 June 2011}}</ref> (This aspect of the plot may however have been inspired by [[Sydney Goodsir Smith]]'s play ''The Wallace: A Triumph In Five Acts'', which unhistorically has Isabella present at the Battle of Falkirk longing for a "real man".) At that time it would also have been unusual to send a woman on a diplomatic mission into a war zone.

=== Portrayal of Robert the Bruce ===

[[File:Brave mel.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Mel Gibson as William Wallace wearing [[Isatis tinctoria|woad]].]]

[[Robert the Bruce]] did change sides between the Scots loyalists and the [[England|English]] more than once in the earlier stages of the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]], but he never betrayed Wallace directly, and he probably did not fight on the English side at the [[Battle of Falkirk]] (although this claim is made by one important medieval source, [[John of Fordun]]'s chronicle). Later, the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] was not a spontaneous battle; he had already been fighting a guerrilla campaign against the English for eight years.  His title before becoming king was [[Earl of Carrick]], not Earl of Bruce.<ref name=traquair/>

=== Portrayal of Longshanks and Prince Edward ===
The actual Edward I was ruthless and temperamental, but the film exaggerates his character for effect. Edward enjoyed poetry and harp music, was a devoted and loving husband to his wife [[Eleanor of Castile]], and as a religious man he gave generously to charity. The film's scene where he scoffs cynically at Isabella for distributing gold to the poor after Wallace refuses it as a bribe would have been unlikely. Also, Edward died on campaign two years after Wallace's execution, not in bed at his home.<ref name=traquair/>

The depiction of the future [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] as an [[effeminate]] homosexual drew accusations of [[homophobia]] against Gibson. {{quote|We cut a scene out, unfortunately. . . where you really got to know that character [Edward II] and to understand his plight and his pain. . . . But it just stopped the film in the first act so much that you thought, 'When's this story going to start?'<ref>{{cite news|work=USA Today|date= May 24, 1995|title=Gibson has faith in family and freedom|author=Della Cava, Marco R. }}</ref>{{better source|date=October 2012}}}} The actual Edward II, who fathered five children by two different women, was rumoured to have had sexual affairs with men, including [[Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Piers Gaveston]], who lived on into the reign of Edward II. The Prince's male lover Phillip was loosely based on Piers Gaveston.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Gibson defended his depiction of Prince Edward as weak and ineffectual, saying:
{{quote|I'm just trying to respond to history. You can cite other examples – [[Alexander the Great]], for example, who conquered the entire world, was also a homosexual. But this story isn't about Alexander the Great. It's about Edward II.<ref>{{cite news|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=May 21, 1995| title=Mel Gibson Dons Kilt and Directs|author= Stein, Ruth}}</ref>}}

In response to Longshank's [[defenestration]] of the Prince's male lover Phillip, Gibson replied: "The fact that King Edward throws this character out a window has nothing to do with him being gay ... He's terrible to his son, to everybody."<ref>{{citation| work = Daily News| title = Gay Alliance has Gibson's 'Braveheart' in its sights| date = 11 May 1995| url = http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/gossip/1995/05/11/1995-05-11_gay_alliance_has_gibson_s__b.html| accessdate = 13 February 2010}}</ref>
Gibson asserted that the reason Longshanks kills his son's lover is because the king is a "[[Psychopathy|psychopath]]".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/1995-05-25/film/icon/ | title=Icon: Mel Gibson talks about Braveheart, movie stardom, and media treachery | author=Matt Zoller Seitz | publisher= |work=Dallas Observer |date=May 25, 1995 | accessdate=August 19, 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071222002830/http://www.dallasobserver.com/1995-05-25/film/icon/|archivedate=2007-12-22}}</ref>  Gibson expressed bewilderment that some filmgoers would laugh at this murder.

=== Wallace's military campaign ===
"MacGregors from the next glen" joining Wallace shortly after the [[action at Lanark]] is dubious, since it is questionable whether [[Clan Gregor]] existed at that stage, and when they did emerge their traditional home was [[Glen Orchy]], some distance from Lanark.<ref>{{cite book|authors=Way, George & Squire, Romily|title= Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia|date= 1994|pages= 220–221}}</ref>

Wallace did win an important victory at the [[Battle of Stirling Bridge]], but the version in ''Braveheart'' is highly inaccurate, as it was filmed without a bridge (and without [[Andrew Moray]], joint commander of the Scots army, who was fatally injured in the battle). Later, Wallace did carry out a large-scale raid into the north of England, but he did not get as far south as York, nor did he kill Longshanks' nephew.<ref name=traquair/>  (However this was not as wide of the mark as Blind Harry, who has Wallace making it as far south as [[St. Albans]], and only refraining from attacking London after the English queen came out to meet him.)<ref name=Riddy/>

The "Irish conscripts" at the [[Battle of Falkirk]] are also unhistorical; there were no Irish troops at Falkirk (although many of the English army were actually [[Welsh people|Welsh]]), and it is anachronistic to refer to conscripts in the Middle Ages (although there were [[feudal]] levies).<ref name=traquair/>

== Accusations of Anglophobia ==
Sections of the English media accused the film of harbouring [[Anglophobia]]. ''[[The Economist]]'' called it "[[Xenophobia|xenophobic]]",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/PrinterFriendly.cfm?story_id=6941798 |title=Economist.com |publisher=Economist.com |date=18 May 2006 |accessdate=2009-02-27|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110629214649/http://www.economist.com/PrinterFriendly.cfm?story_id=6941798 |archivedate=2011-06-29 }}</ref> and [[John Sutherland (author)|John Sutherland]] writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated that: "''Braveheart'' gave full rein to a toxic Anglophobia".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2003/aug/11/religion. world | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=John Sutherland | date=11 August 2003 | accessdate=2010-04-26}} {{dead link|date=May 2014}}</ref><ref name="timesonline1">{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article546776.ece |title=''Braveheart'' battle cry is now but a whisper |publisher=Times Online |date= 24 July 2005|accessdate=2009-02-27 | location=London |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110629142251/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article546776.ece |archivedate=2011-06-29 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book
