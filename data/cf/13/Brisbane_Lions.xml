The club is based in<space/><link><target>Brisbane</target></link>, Queensland. The club was formed in 1996 from the merger of the<space/><link><target>Fitzroy Football Club</target><part>Fitzroy Lions</part></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>Brisbane Bears</target></link>.

However, the club was on extremely shaky financial ground and did not have many opportunities to generate revenue.</paragraph><paragraph>In contrast, the<space/><link><target>Fitzroy Football Club</target><part>Fitzroy Lions</part></link>, a foundation club of the VFL/AFL, had been among the bottom teams of the league for the better part of the last four decades. They had finished in last place for two successive seasons, although they contained a number of promising young players. The club was in serious trouble off the field as well. It had not had a permanent home since 1966 and had been on the verge of folding as early as 1986.</paragraph><paragraph>By the start of the 1996 season, Fitzroy was almost at the end of its financial tether. The club's directors agreed in principle to merge with<space/><link><target>North Melbourne Football Club</target><part>North Melbourne</part></link><space/>as the &quot;North-Fitzroy Kangaroos&quot;. However, that proposal was rejected 151 by the AFL Commission, reportedly out of concern that a merged all-Victorian club would be too powerful. Instead, Fitzroy was placed into administration, and its administrator accepted an offer to merge with Brisbane. The merged team would be based in Brisbane, and Bears coach<space/><link><target>John Northey</target></link><space/>would become coach of the merged club. However, it adopted a logo and guernsey based largely on those of Fitzroy.</paragraph><paragraph>The Brisbane Lions were officially launched on 1 November 1996, joining the national competition in 1997.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Beginnings: 19972000</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:2006 AFL Brisbane Lions.jpg</target><part>200px</part><part>thumb</part><part>Brisbane Lions logo from 2001 to 2009</part></link>In their first year as a combined club the Lions made the finals, finishing in eighth position after being defeated by the<space/><link><target>St Kilda Football Club</target></link><space/>in a qualifying final.

Early in the contest the Lions lost both ruckman Beau McDonald and utility player Martin Pike (who had already had nine possessions in the first quarter) to injury and had to complete the match with a limited bench. Despite not scoring a goal in the first quarter, the undermanned Lions overcame a spirited Collingwood in the closest grand final in 15 years. Controversy surrounded the awarding of the Norm Smith medal for best player in the grand final to Collingwood captain Nathan Buckley. The voting panel cast its votes 20 minutes before the conclusion of the match. However, Lions captain Michael Voss was dominant in the final quarter to lead his team to victory and many speculated that, had voting taken place at the final siren, Voss may have won the award over Buckley.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite news</target><arg name="url">http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/09/29/1033283388725.html</arg><arg name="title">AFL needs fine-tuning on medals</arg><arg name="first">Rohan<space/></arg><arg name="last">Connolly</arg><arg name="date">30 September 2002</arg><arg name="location">Melbourne</arg><arg name="work">The Age</arg></template></extension><space/>The voting procedure was changed for subsequent grand finals.</paragraph><paragraph>In 2002, Brisbane Lions midfielder<space/><link><target>Simon Black</target></link><space/>won the Brownlow Medal for best and fairest player of the 2002 season.<extension extension_name='ref' name="GF"></extension><template><target>rp</target><arg>508</arg></template>Accordingly, the Brisbane Lions became the first grand finalist in VFL/AFL history to have three Brownlow Medallists in its line-up, the three being 1996 winner Michael Voss,<extension extension_name='ref' name="GF"></extension><template><target>rp</target><arg>508</arg></template><space/>2001 winner Jason Akermanis and 2002 winner Simon Black.</paragraph><paragraph>In 2002 former Brisbane lawyer Michael Bowers became chief executive officer as part of a move to turn around the club's problematic finances.<extension extension_name='ref' name="GF"></extension><template><target>rp</target><arg>51</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>With a number of players under an injury cloud and having lost to Collingwood in a qualifying final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground three weeks previously the Lions went into the game as underdogs.

This was followed up by wins over North by 31 points and Fremantle by 22 points. The winning streak would eventually be snapped by a defeat from the Bulldogs by 63 points.
