Only ethnic dominance, the case where the largest ethnic group comprises a majority of the population, increased the risk of civil war. A country characterized by ethnic dominance has nearly twice the chance of a civil war. However, the combined effects of ethnic and religious fractionalization, i.e. the greater chance that any two randomly chosen people will be from separate ethnic or religious groups, the less chance of a civil war, were also significant and positive, as long as the country avoided ethnic dominance. The study interpreted this as stating that minority groups are more likely to rebel if they feel that they are being dominated, but that rebellions are more likely to occur the more homogeneous the population and thus more cohesive the rebels.

In 19th-century Europe, the length of civil wars fell significantly, largely due to the nature of the conflicts as battles for the power center of the state, the strength of centralized governments, and the normally quick and decisive intervention by other states to support the government. Following<space/><link><target>World War II</target></link><space/>the duration of civil wars grew past the norm of the pre-19th century, largely due to weakness of the many postcolonial states and the intervention by major powers on both sides of conflict.

Like Western states of previous centuries, the new ex-colonies lacked autonomous bureaucracies, which would make decisions based on the benefit to society as a whole, rather than respond to<space/><link><target>Political corruption</target><part>corruption</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>nepotism</target></link><space/>to favor a particular interest group. In such a situation, factions manipulate the state to benefit themselves or, alternatively, state leaders use the bureaucracy to further their own self-interest. The lack of credible governance was compounded by the fact that most colonies were economic loss-makers at independence, lacking both a productive economic base and a taxation system to effectively extract resources from economic activity. Among the rare states profitable at decolonization was India, to which scholars credibly argue that<space/><link><target>Uganda</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Malaysia</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Angola</target></link><space/>may be included. Neither did imperial powers make territorial integration a priority, and may have discouraged nascent nationalism as a danger to their rule.

However, international norms towards sovereignty changed in the wake of WWII in ways that support and maintain the existence of weak states.

Further, the international community offers<space/><link><target>development aid</target></link><space/>to weak states, which helps maintain the facade of a functioning modern state by giving the appearance that the state is capable of fulfilling its implied responsibilities of control and order.<extension extension_name='ref'>Hironaka, 2005, pp. 6</extension><space/>The formation of a strong<space/><link><target>international law</target></link><space/>regime and norms against territorial aggression is strongly associated with the dramatic drop in the number of interstate wars, though it has also been attributed to the effect of the Cold War or to the changing nature of economic development. Consequently, military aggression that results in territorial annexation became increasingly likely to prompt international condemnation, diplomatic censure, a reduction in international aid or the introduction of economic sanction, or, as in the case of 1990<space/><link><target>invasion of Kuwait</target></link><space/>by<space/><link><target>Ba'athist Iraq</target><part>Iraq</part></link>, international military intervention to reverse the territorial aggression.<extension extension_name='ref'>Hironaka, 2005, p. 16</extension><space/>Similarly, the international community has largely refused to recognize secessionist regions, while keeping some secessionist self-declared states such as<space/><link><target>Somaliland</target></link><space/>in diplomatic recognition limbo. While there is not a large body of academic work examining the relationship, Hironaka's statistical study found a correlation that suggests that every major international anti-secessionist declaration increased the number of ongoing civil wars by +10%, or a total +114% from 1945 to 1997.<extension extension_name='ref'>Hironaka, 2005, pp. 37-40</extension><space/>The diplomatic and legal protection given by the international community, as well as economic support to weak governments and discouragement of secession, thus had the unintended effect of encouraging civil wars.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:LTTE Sea Tigers attack vessel by sunken SL freighter.JPG</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>A fast attack boat of the<space/><link><target>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</target><part>rebel LTTE</part></link><space/>in<space/><link><target>Sri Lanka</target></link><space/>in 2003 passes the hulk of an LTTE supply ship that had been sunk by government aircraft,<space/><link><target>Sri Lankan Civil War</target></link><space/>(1983-2009)</part></link>There has been an enormous amount of international intervention in civil wars since 1945 that some have argued served to extend wars. While intervention has been practiced since the international system has existed, its nature changed substantially. It became common for both the state and opposition group to receive foreign support, allowing wars to continue well past the point when domestic resources had been exhausted. Superpowers, such as the European<space/><link><target>great powers</target></link>, had always felt no compunction in intervening in civil wars that affected their interests, while distant regional powers such as the United States could declare the interventionist<space/><link><target>Monroe Doctrine</target></link><space/>of 1821 for events in its Central American &quot;backyard&quot;. However, the large population of weak states after 1945 allowed intervention by former colonial powers, regional powers and neighboring states who themselves often had scarce resources. On average, a civil war with interstate intervention was 300% longer than those without. When disaggregated, a civil war with intervention on only one side is 156% longer, while when intervention occurs on both sides the average civil war is longer by an additional 92%. If one of the intervening states was a superpower, a civil war is a further 72% longer; a conflict such as the<space/><link><target>Angolan Civil War</target></link>, in which there is two-sided foreign intervention, including by a superpower (actually, two superpowers in the case of Angola), would be 538% longer on average than a civil war without any international intervention.<extension extension_name='ref'>Hironaka, 2005, pp. 50-51</extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Effect of the Cold War</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Berlin 1990 75540011.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>Fall and demolition of the<space/><link><target>Berlin Wall</target></link><space/>at<space/><link><target>Checkpoint Charlie</target></link><space/>(1990)</part></link>The<space/><link><target>Cold War</target></link><space/>(19451989) provided a global network of material and ideological support that often helped perpetuate civil wars, which were mainly fought in weak ex-colonial states rather than the relatively strong states that were aligned with the<space/><link><target>Warsaw Pact</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>North Atlantic Treaty Organization</target></link>. In some cases,<space/><link><target>superpower</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>would superimpose Cold War ideology onto local conflicts, while in others local actors using Cold War ideology would attract the attention of a superpower to obtain support. Using a separate statistical evaluation than used above for interventions, civil wars that included pro- or anti-communist forces lasted 141% longer than the average non-Cold War conflict, while a Cold War civil war that attracted superpower intervention resulted in wars typically lasting over three times as long as other civil wars.
