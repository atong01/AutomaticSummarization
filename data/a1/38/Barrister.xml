A barrister speaks in court and presents the case before a judge or jury. In some jurisdictions, a barrister receives additional training in evidence law, ethics, and court practice and procedure. In contrast, a solicitor generally meets with clients, does preparatory and administrative work and provides legal advice. In this role, he or she may draft and review legal documents, interact with the client as necessary, prepare evidence, and generally manage the day-to-day administration of a lawsuit. A solicitor can provide a crucial support role to a barrister when in court, such as managing large volumes of documents in the case or even negotiating a settlement outside the courtroom while the trial continues inside.</paragraph><paragraph>There are other essential differences. A barrister will usually have<space/><link><target>rights of audience</target></link><space/>in the higher courts, whereas other legal professionals will often have more limited access, or will need to acquire additional qualifications to have such access. In countries where there is a split between the roles of barrister and solicitor; whereas, the barrister in<space/><link><target>Civil law (legal system)</target><part>civil law</part></link><space/>jurisdictions is responsible for appearing in trials or pleading cases before the courts.</paragraph><paragraph>Barristers usually have particular knowledge of case law, precedent, and the skills to &quot;build&quot; a case. When a solicitor in general practice is confronted with an unusual point of law, they may seek the &quot;opinion of counsel&quot; on the issue.<extension extension_name='ref'>In<space/><link><target>insurance</target></link><space/>contracts there is often the requirement to seek the expert opinion of counsel where the policy contains what is known as &quot;a<space/><link><target>QC clause</target></link>&quot;.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>In most countries, barristers operate as sole practitioners, and are prohibited from forming partnerships or from working as a barrister as part of a corporation. (In 2009, the Clementi Report recommended the abolition of this restriction in England and Wales.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.legal-services-review.org.uk/content/report/index.htm<space/></arg><arg name="title">Clementi report<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Legal-services-review.org.uk<space/></arg><arg name="date">2009-11-06<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2012-03-12</arg></template></extension>) However, barristers normally band together into &quot;<link><target>Chambers (law)</target><part>chambers</part></link>&quot; to share clerks (administrators) and operating expenses.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.shensmithbarristers.co.uk/</arg><arg name="title">Client Access to Barristers</arg><arg name="author">Sunil Rupasinha, road traffic barrister</arg><arg name="publisher">ShenSmith Barristers</arg></template></extension><space/>Some chambers grow to be large and sophisticated, and have a distinctly corporate feel. In some jurisdictions, barristers may be employed by firms of solicitors, banks, or corporations as in-house legal advisers.</paragraph><paragraph>In contrast, solicitors and attorneys work directly with the clients and are responsible for engaging a barrister with the appropriate expertise for the case. Barristers generally have little or no direct contact with their 'lay clients', particularly without the presence or involvement of the solicitor. All correspondence, inquiries, invoices, and so on, will be addressed to the solicitor, who is primarily responsible for the barrister's fees.</paragraph><paragraph>In court, barristers are often visibly distinguished from solicitors by their apparel. For example, in Ireland, England, and Wales, a barrister usually wears a horsehair wig, stiff collar,<space/><link><target>Bands (neckwear)</target><part>bands</part></link>, and a gown.

Barristers once enjoyed a monopoly on appearances before the higher courts, but in<space/><link><target>Great Britain</target></link><space/>this has now been abolished, and solicitor advocates can generally appear for clients at trial. Increasingly, firms of solicitors are keeping even the most advanced advisory and litigation work in-house for economic and client relationship reasons. Similarly, the prohibition on barristers taking instructions directly from the public has also been widely abolished. But, in practice, direct instruction is still a rarity in most jurisdictions, partly because barristers with narrow specializations, or who are only really trained for advocacy, are not prepared to provide general advice to members of the public.</paragraph><paragraph>Historically, barristers have had a major role in trial preparation, including drafting<space/><link><target>pleading</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and reviewing evidence. In some areas of law, that is still the case. In other areas, it is relatively common for the barrister to receive the brief from the instructing solicitor to represent a client at trial only a day or two before the proceeding. Part of the reason for this is cost. A barrister is entitled to a 'brief fee' when a brief is delivered, and this represents the bulk of her/his fee in relation to any trial. They are then usually entitled to a 'refresher' for each day of the trial after the first. But if a case is settled before the trial, the barrister is not needed and the brief fee would be wasted. Some solicitors avoid this by delaying delivery of the brief until it is certain the case will go to trial.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Justification for a split profession</heading><paragraph>Some benefits of maintaining the split include:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>Having an independent barrister reviewing a course of action gives the client a fresh and independent opinion from an expert in the field distinct from solicitors who may maintain ongoing and long-term relationships with the client.<extension extension_name='ref'>This view was expressed by Sir Owen Dixon, Chief Justice of Australia,<space/><link type='external' href='http://www.nswbar.asn.au/docs/about/what_is/dixon.php'>on his swearing in as Chief Justice</link></extension><space/></listitem><listitem>In many jurisdictions, judges are appointed from the bar.

They make up about 14 per cent of the bar in New South Wales.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Canada</heading><paragraph>In Canada (except<space/><link><target>Quebec</target></link>), the professions of barrister and solicitor are fused, and many lawyers refer to themselves with both names, even if they do not practise in both areas.<extension extension_name='ref'>Stephen Waddams,<space/><italics>Introduction to the Study of Law</italics>, 7th ed (Toronto: Carswell, 2010) at 128.</extension><space/>In colloquial parlance within the Canadian legal profession, lawyers often term themselves as &quot;litigators&quot; (or &quot;barristers&quot;), or as &quot;solicitors&quot;, depending on the nature of their law practice though some may in effect practise as both litigators and solicitors. However, &quot;litigators&quot; would generally perform all litigation functions traditionally performed by barristers and solicitors; in contrast, those terming themselves &quot;solicitors&quot; would generally limit themselves to legal work not involving practice before the courts (not even in a preparatory manner as performed by solicitors in England), though some might practise before chambers judges.

However, a number of areas of non-contentious<space/><link><target>private law</target></link><space/>are not monopolized by notaries so that attorneys often specialise in handling either trials, cases, advising, or non-trial matters. The only disadvantage is that attorneys cannot draw up<space/><link><target>public instrument</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>that have the same force of law as<space/><link><target>act (document)</target><part>notarial acts</part></link>. Most large law firms in Quebec offer the full range of legal services of law firms in common-law provinces. Intending Quebec attorneys must earn a bachelor's degree in civil law, pass the provincial bar examination, and successfully complete a legal internship to be admitted to practice. Attorneys are regulated by the Quebec Law Society (<italics>Barreau du Qubec</italics>).</paragraph><heading level='3'>France</heading><paragraph>In France,<space/><italics>avocates</italics>, or attorneys, were, until the 20th century, the equivalent of barristers.

Since the 14th century and during the course of the 19th in particular, French barristers competed in territorial battles over respective areas of legal practice against the<space/><italics>conseil juridique</italics><space/>(chamber-counselor) and<space/><italics>avou</italics><space/>(solicitor), and expanded to become the generalist legal practitioner.

French attorneys may specialize as litigators (trial lawyers) and legal consultants (advising lawyers), known respectively as<space/><italics>avocat plaidant</italics><space/>and<space/><italics>avocat-conseil</italics>. All intending attorneys must pass a legal practice examination and two-year traineeship to be admitted to general practice and enrolled, but to have rights of audience at a given court, an attorney must join that court's bar (<italics>barreau</italics>) by passing its specific bar examination.

Under the Act, the Bar Council of India is the supreme regulatory body to regulate the legal profession in India and also to ensure the compliance of the laws and maintenance of professional standards by the legal profession in the country.

Therefore, each law degree holder must be enrolled with a (single) State Bar Council to practise in India. However, enrollment with any State Bar Council does not restrict the Barrister from appearing before any court in India, even though it is beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the State Bar Council which he is enrolled in.The advantage with having the State Bar Councils is that the work load of the Bar Council of India can be divided into these various State Bar Councils and also that matters can be dealt with locally and in an expedited manner. However, for all practical and legal purposes, the Bar Council of India retains with it, the final power to take decisions in any and all matters related to the legal profession on the whole or with respect to any The process for being entitled to practise in India is twofold. First, the applicant must be a holder of a law degree from a recognized institution in India (or from one of the four recognised Universities in the United Kingdom) and second, must pass the enrollment qualifications of the Bar Council of the state where he/she seeks to be enrolled. For this purpose, the Bar Council of India has an internal Committee whose function is to supervise and examine the various institutions conferring law degrees and to grant recognition to these institutions once they meet the required standards. In this manner the Bar Council of India also ensures the standard of education required for practising in India are met with. As regards the qualification for enrollment with the State Bar Council, while the actual formalities may vary from one State to another, yet predominately they ensure that the application has not been a bankrupt /criminal and is generally fit to practise before courts of India.Enrollment with a Bar Council also means that the law degree holder is recognized as a Barrister and is required to maintain a standards of conduct and professional demeanor at all times, both on and off the profession. The Bar Council of India also prescribes &quot;Rules of Conduct&quot; to be observed by the Barristers in the courts, while interacting with clients and even otherwise.</paragraph><paragraph>In<space/><link><target>Law of Pakistan</target><part>Pakistan</part></link><space/>a graduated can qualify as a Barrister after completion of a<space/><link><target>Master of Laws</target></link><space/>degree, six months pupillage under a senior Barrister in his chambers and afterwards to go for Bar admission test, the Bar Council of the relevant province examine him that he is fit or not to become as an Barrister and is not convicted.

They are usually employed in the higher courts, particularly in the Appeal Courts where they often appear as specialist counsel. South African solicitors (attorneys) follow a practice of referring cases to Counsel for an opinion before proceeding with a case, when Counsel in question practises as a specialist in the case law at stake. Aspiring advocates currently spend one year in pupillage (formerly only six months) before being admitted to the bar in their respective provincial or judicial jurisdictions. The term 'Advocate' is sometimes used in South Africa as a title, e. g.
