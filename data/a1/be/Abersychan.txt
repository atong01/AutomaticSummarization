'''Abersychan''' is a settlement and [[community (Wales)|community]] north of [[Pontypool]] in [[Torfaen]], [[Wales]], and lies within the boundaries of the [[Monmouthshire (historic)|historic county of Monmouthshire]] and the [[Preserved counties of Wales|preserved county]] of [[Gwent (county)|Gwent]].

Abersychan lies in the narrow northern section of the [[Afon Lwyd]] valley.

The town includes two schools; [[Abersychan Comprehensive School]] and Victoria Primary School; together with various shops and other amenities including Abersychan Rugby Club.

Abersychan was the birthplace of the politicians [[Roy Jenkins]], [[Don Touhig]] and [[Paul Murphy (UK politician)|Paul Murphy]] (MP for Torfaen), and of the [[rugby football]]ers [[Wilfred Hodder]], [[Candy Evans]] and [[Bryn Meredith]].

==History==
Abersychan was a thriving industrial centre in the 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly for iron production. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
The principal ironworks were built by the [[British Iron Company]] in 1825; the works passed to the New British Iron Company in 1843 and to the [[Ebbw Vale]] Company in 1852, before closing in 1889.

On 6 February 1890, an underground [[explosion]] at Llanerch Colliery killed 176.<ref>{{cite web|title=Llanerch Colliery, Abersychan|url=http://www.welshcoalmines.co.uk/Gwent/LlanerchColliery.htm|work=Welsh Coal Mines|accessdate=14 October 2010}}</ref>
