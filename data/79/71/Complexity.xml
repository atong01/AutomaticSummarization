An axiomatic approach to<space/><link><target>Kolmogorov complexity</target></link><space/>based on<space/><link><target>Blum axioms</target></link><space/>(Blum 1967) was introduced by Mark Burgin in the paper presented for publication by<space/><link><target>Andrey Kolmogorov</target></link><space/>(Burgin 1982).

Instead, of proving similar theorems, such as the basic invariance theorem, for each particular measure, it is possible to easily deduce all such results from one corresponding theorem proved in the axiomatic setting. This is a general advantage of the axiomatic approach in mathematics. The axiomatic approach to Kolmogorov complexity was further developed in the book (Burgin 2005) and applied to software metrics (Burgin and Debnath, 2003; Debnath and Burgin, 2003).<space/></listitem></list><list type='bullet'><listitem>In<space/><link><target>information processing</target></link>, complexity is a measure of the total number of<space/><link><target>property</target><part>properties</part></link><space/>transmitted by an object and detected by an<space/><link><target>observation</target><part>observer</part></link>.
