It is useful to study sets naively at an early stage of mathematics in order to develop facility for working with them. Furthermore, a firm grasp of set theory's concepts from a naive standpoint is a step to understanding the motivation for the formal axioms of set theory. As a matter of convenience, usage of naive set theory and its formalism prevails even in higher mathematics &amp;ndash; including in more formal settings of set theory itself.</paragraph><paragraph>Sets are defined informally and a few of their properties are investigated.

Today, when mathematicians talk about &quot;set theory&quot; as a field, they usually<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">December 2012</arg></template><space/>mean axiomatic set theory. Informal applications of set theory in other fields are sometimes referred to as applications of &quot;naive set theory&quot;, but usually are understood to be justifiable in terms of an<space/><link><target>axiomatic system</target></link><space/>(normally<space/><link><target>ZermeloFraenkel set theory</target></link>).</paragraph><heading level='3'>Consistency</heading><paragraph>A naive set theory is not necessarily inconsistent, if it correctly specifies the sets allowed to be considered. This can be done by the means of definitions, which are implicit axioms. It is possible to state all the axioms explicitly, as in the case of Halmos'<space/><italics>Naive Set Theory</italics>, which is actually an informal presentation of the usual axiomatic<space/><link><target>ZermeloFraenkel set theory</target></link>. It is &quot;naive&quot; in that the language and notations are those of ordinary informal mathematics, and in that it doesn't deal with consistency or completeness of the axiom system.</paragraph><paragraph>Likewise, an axiomatic set theory is not necessarily consistent, i.e. not necessarily free of paradoxes. It follows from<space/><link><target>Gdel's incompleteness theorems</target></link><space/>that a sufficiently complicated system, in<space/><link><target>first order logic</target></link>, which includes most common axiomatic set theories, cannot be proved consistent from within the theory itself, provided it actually is consistent. However, the common axiomatic systems are generally believed to be consistent, and they do exclude, via the axioms,<space/><italics>some</italics><space/>paradoxes, like Russell's paradox. It is just not known, and never will be, if there are<space/><italics>no</italics><space/>paradoxes at all in these theories or in any first-order set theory.</paragraph><paragraph>The term<space/><italics>naive set theory</italics><space/>is still today also used in some literature<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">December 2012</arg></template><space/>to refer to the set theories studied by Frege and Cantor, rather than to the informal counterparts of modern axiomatic set theory.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Utility</heading><paragraph>The choice between an axiomatic approach and other approaches is largely a matter of convenience. In everyday mathematics the best choice may be informal use of axiomatic set theory. References to particular axioms typically then occurs only when tradition demands it, e.g. the<space/><link><target>axiom of choice</target></link><space/>is often mentioned when used. Likewise, formal proofs occur only when exceptional circumstances warrant it. This informal usage of axiomatic set theory can have (depending on notation) precisely the<space/><italics>appearance</italics><space/>of the naive set theory outlined below, and is considerably easier, both to read and to write, including in the formulation of most statements and proofs and lines of discussion, and is probably less error-prone for most people than a strictly formal approach.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Sets, membership and equality</heading><paragraph>In naive set theory, a<space/><bold>set</bold><space/>is described as a well-defined collection of objects. These objects are called the<space/><bold>elements</bold><space/>or<space/><bold>members</bold><space/>of the set. Objects can be anything: numbers, people, other sets, etc. For instance, 4 is a member of the set of all even<space/><link><target>integer</target><trail>s</trail></link>. Clearly, the set of even numbers is infinitely large; there is no requirement that a set be finite.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Passage with the set definition of Georg Cantor.png</target><part>thumb</part><part>Passage with the original set definition of Georg Cantor</part></link>The definition of sets goes back to<space/><link><target>Georg Cantor</target></link>.

The term &quot;well-defined&quot; in &quot;well-defined collection of objects&quot; cannot, by itself, guarantee the consistency and unambiguity of what exactly constitutes and what does not constitute a set. Attempting to achieve this would be the realm of axiomatic set theory or of axiomatic<space/><bold>class theory</bold>.</paragraph><paragraph>The problem, in this context, with informally formulated set theories, not derived from (and implying) any particular axiomatic theory, is that there may be several widely differing formalized versions, that have both different sets and different rules for how new sets may be formed, that all conform to the original informal definition. For example, Cantor's verbatim definition allows for considerable freedom in what constitutes a set. On the other hand, it is unlikely that Cantor was particularly interested in sets containing cats and dogs, but rather only in sets containing purely mathematical objects. An example of such a class of sets could be the<space/><link><target>Von Neumann universe</target></link>. But even when fixing the class of sets under consideration, it is not always clear which rules for set formation are allowed without introducing paradoxes.</paragraph><paragraph>For the purpose of fixing the discussion below, the term &quot;well-defined&quot; should instead be interpreted as an<space/><italics>intention</italics>, with either implicit or explicit rules (axioms or definitions), to rule out inconsistencies. The purpose is to keep the often deep and difficult issues of consistency away from the, usually simpler, context at hand. An explicit ruling out of<space/><italics>all</italics><space/>conceivable inconsistencies (paradoxes) cannot be achieved for an axiomatic set theory anyway, due to Gdel's second incompleteness theorem, so this does not at all hamper the utility of naive set theory as compared to axiomatic set theory in the simple contexts considered below. It merely simplifies the discussion. Consistency is henceforth taken for granted unless explicitly mentioned.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Membership</heading><paragraph>If<space/><italics>x</italics><space/>is a member of a set<space/><italics>A</italics>, then it is also said that<space/><italics>x</italics><space/><bold>belongs to</bold><space/><italics>A</italics>, or that<space/><italics>x</italics><space/>is in<space/><italics>A</italics>.
