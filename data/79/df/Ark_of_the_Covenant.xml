During the crossing, the river grew dry as soon as the feet of the priests carrying the Ark touched its waters, and remained so until the priestswith the Arkleft the river after the people had passed over (Josh. 3:15-17; 4:10, 11, 18).

On the seventh day, the seven priests sounding the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the Ark compassed the city seven times and, with a great shout, Jericho's wall fell down flat and the people took the city (Josh. 6:16-20). After the defeat at<space/><link><target>Ai (Bible)</target><part>Ai</part></link>, Joshua lamented before the Ark (Josh. 7:6-9).

The Ark was taken by the<space/><link><target>Philistines</target></link><space/>(1 Sam. 4:3-11) who subsequently sent it back after retaining it for seven months (1 Sam. 5:7, 8) because of the events said to have transpired.</paragraph><paragraph>After their first defeat at<space/><link><target>Eben-ezer</target></link>, the Israelites had the Ark brought from Shiloh, and welcomed its coming with great rejoicing. In the second battle, the Israelites were again defeated, and the Philistines captured the Ark (1 Sam. 4:3-5, 10, 11). The news of its capture was at once taken to Shiloh by a messenger &quot;with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.&quot; The old priest, Eli, fell dead when he heard it; and his daughter-in-law, bearing a son at the time the news of the capture of the Ark was received, named him<space/><link><target>Ichabod</target></link>explained as &quot;The glory has departed Israel&quot; in reference to the loss of the Ark (1 Sam. 4:12-22).</paragraph><paragraph>The Philistines took the Ark to several places in their country, and at each place misfortune befell them (1 Sam. 5:1-6).

When he reached the mountain, Jeremiah found a cave-dwelling; he carried the tent, the ark, and the incense-altar into it, then blocked up the entrance. Some of his companions came to mark out the way, but were unable to find it. When Jeremiah learnt of this he reprimanded them. "The place shall remain unknown", he said, "until God finally gathers his people together and shows mercy to them. The Lord will bring these things to light again, and the glory of the Lord will appear with the cloud, as it was seen both in the time of Moses and when Solomon prayed that the shrine might be worthily consecrated."
