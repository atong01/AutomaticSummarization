In modern times, the scope of<space/><italics>philosophy</italics><space/>has become limited to more generic or abstract inquiries, such as ethics and metaphysics, in which logic plays a major role. Today's philosophy tends to exclude empirical study of the natural world by means of the scientific method. In contrast, Aristotle's philosophical endeavors encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry.</paragraph><paragraph>In the larger sense of the word, Aristotle makes philosophy coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as &quot;science&quot;. Note, however, that his use of the term<space/><italics>science</italics><space/>carries a different meaning than that covered by the term &quot;scientific method&quot;. For Aristotle, &quot;all science (<italics>dianoia</italics>) is either practical, poetical or theoretical&quot; (<italics>Metaphysics</italics><space/>1025b25). By practical science, he means ethics and politics; by poetical science, he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts; by theoretical science, he means physics, mathematics and metaphysics.</paragraph><paragraph>If logic (or &quot;analytics&quot;) is regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy, the divisions of Aristotelian philosophy would consist of: (1)<space/><link><target>Logic</target></link>; (2) Theoretical Philosophy, including Metaphysics, Physics and Mathematics; (3) Practical Philosophy and (4) Poetical Philosophy.</paragraph><paragraph>In the period between his two stays in Athens, between his times at the Academy and the Lyceum, Aristotle conducted most of the scientific thinking and research for which he is renowned today. In fact, most of Aristotle's life was devoted to the study of the objects of natural science. Aristotle's metaphysics contains observations on the nature of numbers but he made no original contributions to mathematics. He did, however, perform<space/><link><target>original research</target></link><space/>in the natural sciences, e.g., botany, zoology, physics, astronomy, chemistry, meteorology, and several other sciences.</paragraph><paragraph>Aristotle's writings on science are largely qualitative, as opposed to quantitative. Beginning in the 16th century, scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences, and Aristotle's work in this area was deemed hopelessly inadequate. His failings were largely due to the absence of concepts like mass, velocity, force and temperature. He had a conception of speed and temperature, but no quantitative understanding of them, which was partly due to the absence of basic experimental devices, like clocks and thermometers.</paragraph><paragraph>His writings provide an account of many scientific observations, a mixture of precocious accuracy and curious errors. For example, in his<space/><italics><link><target>History of Animals</target></link></italics><space/>he claimed that human males have more teeth than females.<extension extension_name='ref'>Aristotle,<space/><italics>History of Animals</italics>, 2.3.</extension><space/>In a similar vein,<space/><link><target>John Philoponus</target></link>, and later<space/><link><target>Galileo Galilei</target><part>Galileo</part></link>, showed by simple experiments that Aristotle's theory that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philoponus/#2.2<space/></arg><arg name="title">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Plato.stanford.edu<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">26 April 2009</arg></template></extension><space/>On the other hand, Aristotle refuted<space/><link><target>Democritus</target></link>'s claim that the<space/><link><target>Milky Way</target></link><space/>was made up of &quot;those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun's rays,&quot; pointing out (correctly, even if such reasoning was bound to be dismissed for a long time) that, given &quot;current astronomical demonstrations&quot; that &quot;the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun, then&amp;nbsp;... the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>Aristotle,<space/><italics>Meteorology</italics><space/>1.8, trans.

Today's scientific method assumes that such thinking without sufficient facts is ineffective, and that discerning the validity of one's hypothesis requires far more rigorous experimentation than that which Aristotle used to support his laws.</paragraph><paragraph>Aristotle also had some scientific blind spots. He posited a<space/><link><target>geocentrism</target><part>geocentric cosmology</part></link><space/>that we may discern in selections of the<space/><italics>Metaphysics</italics>, which was widely accepted up until the 16th century.

For instance, he founded logic as a formal science and created foundations to biology that were not superseded for two millennia. Moreover, he introduced the fundamental notion that nature is composed of things that change and that studying such changes can provide useful knowledge of underlying constants.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Geology</heading><paragraph>As quoted from<space/><link><target>w:Charles Lyell</target><part>Charles Lyell's</part></link><space/><italics><link><target>Principles of Geology</target></link></italics>:<extension extension_name='blockquote'><paragraph>He [Aristotle] refers to many examples of changes now constantly going on, and insists emphatically on the great results which they must produce in the lapse of ages.

The concluding observation is as follows: 'As time never fails, and the universe is eternal, neither the Tanais, nor the Nile, can have flowed for ever. The places where they rise were once dry, and there is a limit to their operations, but there is none to time.

Thus the material cause of a table is wood, and the material cause of a car is rubber and steel. It is not about action. It does not mean one domino knocks over another domino.</listitem><listitem>The<space/><link><target>formal cause</target></link><space/>is its form, i.e., the arrangement of that matter. It tells us what a thing is, that any thing is determined by the definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i.e., macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the whole-part causation. Plainly put, the formal cause is the idea existing in the first place as exemplar in the mind of the sculptor, and in the second place as intrinsic, determining cause, embodied in the matter. Formal cause could only refer to the essential quality of causation. A simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist, architect, or engineer to create his drawings.</listitem><listitem>The<space/><link><target>efficient cause</target></link><space/>is &quot;the primary source&quot;, or that from which the change under consideration proceeds. It identifies 'what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed' and so suggests all sorts of agents, nonliving or living, acting as the sources of change or movement or rest. Representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect, this covers the modern definitions of &quot;cause&quot; as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs. So, take the two dominoes, this time of equal weighting, the first is knocked over causing the second also to fall over.</listitem><listitem>The<space/><link><target>final cause</target></link><space/>is its purpose, or that for the sake of which a thing exists or is done, including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities. The final cause or teleos is the purpose or function that something is supposed to serve. This covers modern ideas of motivating causes, such as volition, need, desire, ethics, or spiritual beliefs.</listitem></list><paragraph>Additionally, things can be causes of one another, causing each other reciprocally, as hard work causes fitness and vice versa, although not in the same way or function, the one is as the beginning of change, the other as the goal. (Thus Aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect). Moreover, Aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects; its presence and absence may result in different outcomes. Simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event. Our two dominoes require someone or something to intentionally knock over the first domino, because it cannot fall of its own accord.</paragraph><paragraph>Aristotle marked two modes of causation: proper (prior) causation and accidental (chance) causation. All causes, proper and incidental, can be spoken as potential or as actual, particular or generic. The same language refers to the effects of causes, so that generic effects assigned to generic causes, particular effects to particular causes, operating causes to actual effects. Essentially, causality does not suggest a temporal relation between the cause and the effect.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Optics</heading><paragraph>Aristotle held more accurate theories on some optical concepts than other philosophers of his day.

It is &quot;from what is spontaneous&quot; (but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance). For a better understanding of Aristotle's conception of &quot;chance&quot; it might be better to think of &quot;coincidence&quot;: Something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place, but with the result of another thing (not intended) taking place.</paragraph><paragraph>For example: A person seeks donations. That person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum. However, if the person seeking the donations met the person donating, not for the purpose of collecting donations, but for some other purpose, Aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance. It must be unusual that something happens by chance. In other words, if something happens all or most of the time, we cannot say that it is by chance.</paragraph><paragraph>There is also more specific kind of chance, which Aristotle names &quot;luck&quot;, that can only apply to human beings, because it is in the sphere of moral actions.

In that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality (<italics><link><target>Dunamis</target><part>dynamis</part></link></italics>) and actuality (<italics><link><target>entelecheia</target></link></italics>) in association with the matter and the form.</paragraph><paragraph>Referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing, or being acted upon, if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (<italics>dynamei</italics>) plant, and if is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either 'act' (<italics>poiein</italics>) or 'be acted upon' (<italics>paschein</italics>), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate&amp;nbsp; being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise&amp;nbsp; acting).</paragraph><paragraph>Actuality is the fulfillment of the end of the potentiality. Because the end (<italics>telos</italics>) is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end.

When we look at an apple, for example, we see an apple, and we can also analyze a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other.</paragraph><paragraph>Plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things.

Aristotle argued that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things. According to Aristotle, if a universal exists, either as a particular or a relation, then there must have been, must be currently, or must be in the future, something on which the universal can be predicated. Consequently, according to Aristotle, if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time, then it does not exist.</paragraph><paragraph>In addition, Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals. As Plato spoke of the world of the forms, a location where all universal forms subsist, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated.

First, the actual retaining of the experience in the<space/><link><target>mnemonic</target></link><space/>&quot;imprint&quot; that can develop from sensation. Second, the intellectual anxiety that comes with the &quot;imprint&quot; due to being impressed at a particular time and processing specific contents. These abilities can be explained as memory is neither sensation nor thinking because is arises only after a lapse of time. Therefore, memory is of the past,<space/><template><target>sfn</target><arg>Bloch</arg><arg>2007</arg><arg name="p">25</arg></template><space/>prediction is of the future, and sensation is of the present. The retrieval of our &quot;imprints&quot; cannot be performed suddenly. A transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences, both for our previous experience and present experience.</paragraph><paragraph>Aristotle proposed that slow-witted people have good memory because the fluids in their brain do not wash away their memory organ used to imprint experiences and so the &quot;imprint&quot; can easily continue. However, they cannot be too slow or the hardened surface of the organ will not receive new &quot;imprints&quot;. He believed the young and the old do not properly develop an &quot;imprint&quot;. Young people undergo rapid changes as they develop, while the elderly's organs are beginning to decay, thus stunting new &quot;imprints&quot;. Likewise, people who are too quick-witted are similar to the young and the image cannot be fixed because of the rapid changes of their organ.

For all that this man will choose, if the choice is based on his knowledge, are good things and their contraries are bad. And since everybody chooses most of all what conforms to their own proper dispositions (a just man choosing to live justly, a man with bravery to live bravely, likewise a self-controlled man to live with self-control), it is clear that the intelligent man will choose most of all to be intelligent; for this is the function of that capacity.

The consensus is that Andronicus of Rhodes collected the esoteric works of Aristotle's school which existed in the form of smaller, separate works, distinguished them from those of Theophrastus and other Peripatetics, edited them, and finally compiled them into the more cohesive, larger works as they are known today.<extension extension_name='ref'>Anagnostopoulos, G., &quot;Aristotle's Works and Thoughts&quot;,<space/><italics>A Companion to Aristotle</italics><space/>(Blackwell Publishing, 2009), p. 16.
