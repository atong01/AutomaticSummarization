{{Quantities of bytes}}
The '''exabyte''' is a multiple of the unit [[byte]] for [[Computer data storage|digital information]]. The [[SI prefix|prefix]] ''[[exa-|exa]]'' indicates multiplication by the sixth power of 1000 (10<sup>18</sup>) in the [[International System of Units]] (SI).  Therefore, one exabyte is one [[quintillion]] [[byte]]s ([[Long and short scales|short scale]]). The symbol for the exabyte is '''EB'''.

: 1 EB = {{gaps|1000<sup>6</sup>|bytes}} = {{gaps|10<sup>18</sup>|bytes}} = {{gaps|1|000|000|000|000|000|000|B}} = 1000&nbsp;[[petabyte]]s = {{gaps|1|[[1,000,000|million]]|[[terabytes]]}} = {{gaps|1|[[1,000,000,000|billion]]|[[gigabytes]]}}.

A related unit, the [[exbibyte]], using a [[binary prefix]], is equal to {{gaps|1024<sup>6</sup>|bytes}}, about 15% larger.

==Usage examples and size comparisons==
* A processor with a [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] address bus can [[address space|address]] 16 [[exbibyte]]s of memory,<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/zos/basics/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.zos.zconcepts/zconcepts_102.htm | title=A brief history of virtual storage and 64-bit addressability | accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref> which is over 18&nbsp;exabytes.
* The world's technological capacity to store information grew from 2.6 ("optimally compressed") exabytes in 1986 to 15.8 in 1993, over 54.5 in 2000, and to 295 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2007. This is equivalent to less than one [[Compact disc|CD]] (650&nbsp;MB) per person in 1986 (539&nbsp;MB per person), roughly four in 1993, 12 in 2000, and almost 61 in 2007. Piling up the imagined 404 billion CDs from 2007 would create a stack from the [[earth]] to the [[moon]] and a quarter of this distance beyond (with 1.2&nbsp;mm thickness per CD).<ref name="HilbertLopez2011">Martin Hilbert and Priscila López, "[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/60 The World’s Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information]", ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', 332(6025), 2011: 60–65; see also [http://www.martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html "free access to the study"] and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIKPjOuwqHo "video animation"].</ref>
* The world's technological capacity to receive information through one-way [[broadcast]] networks was 432&nbsp;exabytes of information in 1986, 715 exabytes in 1993, 1,200 exabytes in 2000, and 1,900 in 2007 (and with all the preceding examples assuming that those figures represent "optimally compressed" data).<ref name="HilbertLopez2011"/>
* The world's effective capacity to exchange information through two-way [[telecommunication]] networks was 0.281&nbsp;exabytes of information in 1986, 0.471 in 1993, 2.2 in 2000, and 65 exabytes in 2007 (yet again, all such amounts listed are strictly working off the basis that the data was in an "optimally compressed" form).<ref name="HilbertLopez2011"/>
* In 2004, the global monthly [[Internet traffic]] passed 1&nbsp;exabyte for the first time. In January 2007, Bret Swanson of the [[Discovery Institute]] coined the term ''exaflood'' for a supposedly impending flood of exabytes that would cause the Internet's [[congestive collapse]].<ref name="DISC">{{Cite web| url=http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=3869 | title=The Coming Exaflood | author=Bret Swanson | date=2007-01-20 | publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]] | accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|author=Grant Gross |date=2007-11-24 |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,139885-pg,1/article.html |title=Internet Could Max Out in 2 Years, Study Says |publisher=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] |accessdate=2007-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20071126041511/http://www.pcworld.com:80/article/id,139885-pg,1/article.html |archivedate=26 November 2007 }}</ref> Nevertheless, the global Internet traffic has continued its [[exponential growth]], undisturbed, and {{as of|2010|03|lc=y}} it is estimated at 21&nbsp;exabytes per month.<ref>[http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2361820,00.asp Cisco Systems]</ref>

* According to the February 2013 update of Cisco VNI Forecast for 2012–17, annual global IP traffic will pass the zettabyte threshold by the end of 2016. In 2016, global IP traffic will reach 1.3&nbsp;zettabytes per year or 110.3&nbsp;exabytes per month.

* A gram of [[DNA]] theoretically can hold 455 exabytes.
* According to the [[CSIRO]], in the next decade, [[astronomer]]s expect to be processing 10 [[petabytes]] of data every hour from the [[Square Kilometre Array]] (SKA) telescope.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.csiro.au/news/ps3ng.html | title=From Molecules to the Milky Way: Dealing with the Data Deluge | accessdate=2007-11-10}}</ref> The array is thus expected to generate approximately one exabyte every four days of operation.
