Almost all sectors became open to foreign investment although agricultural products remained protected.</paragraph><paragraph>The original idea of his then<space/><link><target>Minister of Finance</target></link>, Rudolf Homes, was that the country should import agricultural products in which it was not competitive, like<space/><link><target>maize</target></link>,<space/><link><target>wheat</target></link>,<space/><link><target>cotton</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>soybeans</target></link><space/>and export the ones in which it had an advantage, like<space/><link><target>fruits</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>flowers</target></link>.

The first five years of liberalization were characterized by high economic growth rates of between 4% and 5%. The<space/><link><target>Ernesto Samper</target></link><space/>administration (199498) emphasized social welfare policies which targeted Colombia's lower income population. These reforms led to higher government spending which increased the fiscal deficit and public sector debt, the financing of which required higher interest rates. An over-valued peso inherited from the previous administration was maintained.</paragraph><paragraph>The economy slowed, and by 1998 GDP growth was only 0.6%. In 1999, the country fell into its first recession since the<space/><link><target>Great Depression</target></link>. The economy shrank by 4.5% with unemployment at over 20%. While unemployment remained at 20% in 2000, GDP growth recovered to 3.1%.</paragraph><paragraph>The administration of President<space/><link><target>Andrs Pastrana Arango</target></link>, when it took office on 7 August 1998, faced an economy in crisis, with the difficult internal security situation and global economic turbulence additionally inhibiting confidence. As evidence of a serious recession became clear in 1999, the government took a number of steps. It engaged in a series of controlled devaluations of the peso, followed by a decision to let it float. Colombia also entered into an agreement with the<space/><link><target>International Monetary Fund</target></link><space/>which provided a $2.7 billion guarantee (extended funds facility), while committing the government to budget discipline and structural reforms.</paragraph><paragraph>By early 2000 there had been the beginning of an economic recovery, with the export sector leading the way, as it enjoyed the benefit of the more competitive exchange rate, as well as strong prices for<space/><link><target>petroleum</target></link>, Colombia's leading export product. Prices of<space/><link><target>coffee</target></link>, the other principal export product, have been more variable.</paragraph><paragraph>Economic growth reached 3.1% during 2000 and inflation was 9.0% although unemployment has yet to significantly improve. Colombia's international reserves have remained stable at around $8.35 billion, and Colombia has successfully remained in international capital markets. Colombia's total foreign debt at the end of 1999 was $34.5 billion with $14.7 billion in private sector and $19.8 billion in public sector debt. Major international<space/><link><target>credit rating</target></link><space/>organizations have dropped Colombian<space/><link><target>government debt</target><part>sovereign debt</part></link><space/>below investment grade, primarily as a result of large fiscal deficits, which current policies are seeking to close.</paragraph><paragraph>Former president<space/><link><target>lvaro Uribe</target></link><space/>(elected 7 August 2002) introduced several economic reforms, including measures designed to reduce the public-sector deficit below 2.5% of GDP in 2004. The government's economic policy and<space/><link><target>democratic security</target></link><space/>strategy have engendered a growing sense of confidence in the economy, particularly within the business sector, and GDP growth in 2003 was among the highest in<space/><link><target>Latin America</target></link>, at over 4%.

By 2012, the tourism industry is small but growing rapidly.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Economy - Overview</heading><paragraph>Colombia's economy has experienced rapid increase over the past three years despite a serious armed conflict. The economy continues to grow in part because of austere government budgets, focused efforts to reduce public debt levels, an export-oriented growth strategy, an improved security situation in the country, and high commodity prices. Ongoing economic problems facing President Uribe range from reforming the pension system to reducing high unemployment, and to achieving congressional passage of a fiscal transfers reform. New exploration is needed to offset declining<space/><link><target>oil production</target></link>. International and domestic financial analysts note with concern the growing central government deficit, which hovers at 5% of GDP. However, the government's economic policy and democratic security strategy have engendered a growing sense of confidence in the economy, particularly within the business sector. Unlike other Latin-American countries like Argentina or Venezuela, Colombia's conservative government for a long time did not reduce its incredibly high inequality.

The Colombian Company of Air Navigation, formed in 1919, was the second commercial airline in the world. It was not until the 1940s that Colombias air transportation began growing significantly in the number of companies, passengers carried, and kilometers covered. In the early 2000s, an average of 72 percent of the passengers transported by air go to national destinations, while 28 percent travel internationally. One notable feature is that after the reforms of the beginning of the 1990s, the number of international passengers tripled by 2003. In 1993 the construction, administration, operation, and maintenance of the main airports transferred to departmental authorities and the private sector, including companies specializing in air transportation. Within this process, in 2006 the International Airport Operator (Opain), a Swiss-Colombian consortium, won the concession to manage and develop Bogots El Dorado International Airport. In addition to El Dorado, Colombias international airports are Palo Negro in Bucaramanga, Simn Bolvar in Santa Marta, Ernesto Colombia: A Country Study 172 Cortissoz in Barranquilla, Rafael Nez in Cartagena, Jos Mara Crdova in Rionegro near Medelln, Alfonso Bonilla Aragn in Cali, Alfredo Vsquez Cobo in Leticia, Matecaa in Pereira, Gustavo Rojas Pinilla in San Andrs, and Camilo Daza in Ccuta (see fig. 5). In 2006 Colombia was generally reported to have a total of 984 airports, of which 103 had paved runways and 883 were unpaved. The Ministry of Transportation listed 581 airports in 2007, but it may have used a different methodology for counting them.<extension extension_name='ref' name="lcweb2.loc.gov"></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Taxation in Colombia</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Economic history of Colombia</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>List of companies of Colombia</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>List of Colombian departments by GDP</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Economy of South America</target></link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>Reflist</target><arg>30em</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>External links</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link type='external' href='http://www.freetrade.org/pubs/FTBs/FTB-032.html'>A U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement: Strengthening Democracy and Progress in Latin America</link></listitem><listitem><link type='external' href='http://www.investincolombia.com.co/colombia-economy'>Colombia Economy report - Official Investment portal</link></listitem></list><paragraph><template><target>SACN</target></template><template><target>World Trade Organization</target></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>South America in topic</target><arg>Economy of</arg></template><template><target>Colombia topics</target><arg name="state">collapsed</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>DEFAULTSORT:Economy Of Colombia</target></template><link><target>Category:World Trade Organization member economies</target><part>Colombia</part></link><link><target>Category:Economy of Colombia</target><part></part></link></paragraph></article>
