Despite his origins, his eloquence in conversation and in his poetry (which he shared with colleagues) was something new at the time. With his gradual flowering as a poet emerged a certain boldness and self-confidence.

== Early career ==
Charles began his career as a contemporary and urban performance poet on the British [[cabaret]] circuit. His performances were considered original, with Charles described as having a natural ironic wit which appealed to talent scouts. In 1981 Charles climbed on stage at a [[Teardrop Explodes]] concert and recited a humorous, but derogatory, poem about the band's singer. He was invited to open subsequent gigs for the group and went on to perform as a support act in pubs and clubs for the following three years,<ref>''Q magazine'', April 1987, David Housham "Craig Charles: Compulsive Listening", pp. 25–26</ref> and at events such as the ''Larks in the Park'' music festival at [[Sefton Park]] (1982). He performed poetry at Liverpool's [[Everyman Theatre]] (1983) with such poets as [[Roger McGough]] and [[Adrian Henri]].

Charles was involved in the Liverpool music scene, writing and singing lyrics for a number of local rock bands.<ref>Craig Charles, Introduction to ''No Other Blue'', Penguin Books Ltd, London, 1997</ref> In 1980, he played keyboards, bass and provided voice in the rock band ''Watt 4''.<ref>''Daily Post'', 16 September 2003, Chris Brown [http://webspace.webring.com/people/wj/junostar/CCicnetwork.html "A club that rocked when punk was in its prime"], Liverpool</ref> He performed his political rap lyrics as a 'Wordsmith'.

This was his first professional engagement.<ref>The Craig Charles Funk and Soul Show, BBC Radio 6 Music, 12 May 2012</ref> He recorded a further Peel Session in 1984.<ref>AL Peters, "Craig Charles The Wordsmith, ''The John Peel Radio Show'', 1984", [http://www.groovinrecords.co.uk/ Groovin' Records]</ref>

Charles realised he was using poetry as a vehicle for his sense of humour and progressed into stand-up comedy. He was part of the ''[[Red Wedge]]'' comedy tour in 1986, which aimed to raise awareness of the social problems of the time, in support of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. He also performed his first one-man show in 1986,<ref>[http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/sta/search/detaile.cfm?EID=19588 ''Raising the Roof for the Gateway Exchange''], 29 August 1986, Edinburgh Festival Fringe</ref> which premiered in Edinburgh, and then toured internationally.<ref>''The Glasgow Herald'', 13 August 1987, Andrew Young [http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19870813&id=yDpAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WFkMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2116,2850085 ''The Fringe: Craig Charles'']</ref> Charles was a guest on programmes including [[Janice Long]]'s [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] show,<ref>[http://www.mrsoulsbury.com/2011/04/april-podcast-with-craig-charles-and.html ''The Soulsbury Show''], 22 April 2011, Mr Soulsbury]</ref> and was a regular panellist on [[Ned Sherrin]]'s chat show ''[[Loose Ends (radio)|Loose Ends]]'' (1987–88) on [[BBC Radio 4]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Champion of funk soul brothers|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/champion-of-funk-soul-brothers-6151442.html|publisher=The Independent, 7 March 2005 | location=London|first=Ian|last=Burrell|date=7 March 2005}}</ref>

Charles reads the audiobook editions of the ''Red Dwarf'' novel ''[[Last Human]]'', and his book ''The Log: A Dwarfer's Guide to Everything'', and he regularly attends sci-fi, comedy and memorabilia conventions in connection with the ''Red Dwarf'' franchise. During ''Back to Earth'', Charles' character, Lister, visits the set of ''Coronation Street'' where he meets the actor Craig Charles.<ref>''Blokely'', 7 November 2012, James York & Richard Luck [http://blokely.com/entertainment/craig-charles-interview-red-dwarf-x " Craig Charles: Funk & Soul x Sci-fi"]</ref> On 2 May 2015, Grant Naylor announced that an eleventh and a twelfth series of Red Dwarf had been commissioned with Craig Charles returning as Lister.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-32572639</ref>

=== ''Robot Wars'' ===
Charles notably presented the cult TV hit ''[[Robot Wars (TV series)|Robot Wars]]'' on BBC2 (1998–2003) and Channel 5 (2003–04), from series 2 until its conclusion at series 7, which included two ''Extreme'' series and numerous 'specials'. Charles was the main host and presided over the arena in which teams of amateur engineers battled their home-made radio-controlled robots against each other, and against the house robots. Charles introduced the show, enthusiastically announced the results of the battles and spoke to the contestants after the main events. He ended each episode with a short ''Robot Wars''-themed poem. Charles' son, Jack, appeared on the show on several occasions, and was a contestant on "Team Nemesis" during series 4. Charles also hosted the ''Robot Wars Live'' UK tour, in 2001 and shows performed at the [[Wembley Arena]].

=== ''Takeshi's Castle'' ===
Charles provided the English [[voice-over]] commentary for the [[Challenge TV|Challenge]] and [[Ftn]] (2002–04) rebroadcast of the popular game show ''[[Takeshi's Castle#United Kingdom|Takeshi's Castle]]'' originally by [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] in [[Japan]]. In each episode, between 100 and 142 contestants attempted to pass a series of wacky and near-impossible physical challenges to reach the Show Down at the castle against a [[Japan]]ese actor [[Takeshi Kitano]] for a chance to win large cash prizes. Charles co-wrote the programme and commentated throughout all 122 episodes of the four series, and also some special and "best of" episodes. He provided comedy insights into the contestants' abilities, which were designed to appeal to adult audiences, as well as younger viewers - and also coined the term "Keshi Heads" to describe fans of the show.

Charles' commentary was so well received that the reboot featuring [[Dick and Dom]] on the voice-overs did not fare as well because he wasn't there, according to complaints that Challenge received via social media. To this day, the Challenge rebroadcasts of ''Takeshi's Castle'' regularly place in the weekly top 10 for ratings with an average of 130,000 viewers per episode.

=== Rape allegation and acquittal ===
In July 1994, Charles and a friend were arrested and [[Remand (detention)|remanded]] in custody for several months on a rape charge.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Independent|date= 4 January 1997|first=James|last= Rampton |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/profile-craig-charles-the-inside-story-1281538.html |title=Profile: Craig Charles: The Inside Story|location=London}}</ref> In March 1995, both men were acquitted in their trial. After being cleared, Charles spoke of the need to restore anonymity for those accused of rape. He stated that "the fact that my name and address along with my picture can appear on the front of the papers before the so-called 'victim' has even signed a statement proves that anonymity for rape defendants is a must and that the law must be changed."<ref>{{cite news|work= News at Ten|date= 3 March 1995|title=Craig Charles cleared of rape}}</ref> While in prison, Charles was attacked by a man wielding a knife.<ref>{{cite news|date=31 July 2003|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3055859.stm|title= The trauma of being falsely accused|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 December 2006 | location=London}}</ref>

In August, Charles was arrested and released on bail pending further enquiries, and in September he accepted a [[Police caution|caution]] for possession of a [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971|Class A drug]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=22 September 2006
