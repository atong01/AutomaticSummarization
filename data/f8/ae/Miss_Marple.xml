This early version of Miss Marple is a gleeful gossip and not an especially nice woman. The citizens of St. Mary Mead like her but are often tired by her nosy nature and how she seems to expect the worst of everyone. In later books she becomes more modern and a kinder person.</paragraph><paragraph>Miss Marple solves difficult crimes because of her shrewd intelligence, and St. Mary Mead, over her lifetime, has given her seemingly infinite examples of the negative side of human nature. Crimes always remind her of a parallel incident, although acquaintances may be bored by analogies that often lead her to a deeper realization about the true nature of a crime. She also has a remarkable ability to latch onto a casual comment and connect it to the case at hand. In several stories, she is able to rely on her acquaintance with<space/><link><target>Sir Henry Clithering</target></link>, a retired commissioner of the<space/><link><target>Metropolitan Police</target></link>, for official information when required.</paragraph><paragraph>Miss Marple never married and has no close living relatives. Her nephew, the &quot;well-known author&quot; Raymond West appears in some stories including<space/><italics>Sleeping Murder</italics><space/>and<space/><italics>Ingots of Gold</italics>, which also feature his wife Joan, a modern artist (though prior to their marriage she is referred to as &quot;Joyce Lemprire&quot;, in the<space/><italics>The Thirteen Problems</italics><space/>stories). Raymond overestimates himself and underestimates his aunt's mental acuity. Miss Marple employs young women (Clara, Emily, Alice, Esther, Gwenda and Amy) from a nearby orphanage, whom she trains for service as general housemaids after the retirement of her long-time maid-housekeeper faithful Florence. She was briefly looked after by her irritating maid, Miss Knight. In her later years, companion Cherry Baker, first introduced in<space/><italics>The Mirror Crack'd From Side to Side</italics>, lives in.</paragraph><paragraph>Miss Marple has never worked for her living and is of independent means, although she benefits in her old age from the financial support of Raymond West, her nephew (<italics><link><target>A Caribbean Mystery</target></link></italics>, 1964). She is not herself from the aristocracy or landed gentry, but is quite at home among them and would probably have been happy to describe herself as &quot;genteel&quot;; indeed, a<space/><italics><link><target>gentlewoman</target></link></italics>. Miss Marple may thus be considered a female version of that staple of British detective fiction, the<space/><link><target>gentleman detective</target></link>. She demonstrates a remarkably thorough education, including some art courses that involved study of human anatomy through the study of human cadavers. In<space/><italics><link><target>They Do It with Mirrors</target></link></italics><space/>(1952), it is revealed that Miss Marple grew up in a<space/><link><target>cathedral close</target></link>, and that she studied at an Italian finishing school with Americans Ruth Van Rydock and Caroline &quot;Carrie&quot; Louise Serrocold.</paragraph><paragraph>While Miss Marple is described as 'an old lady' in many of the stories, her age is mentioned in &quot;At Bertram's Hotel&quot;, where it is said she visited the hotel when she was fourteen and almost sixty years have passed since then. Excluding &quot;Sleeping Murder&quot;, 41 years passed between the first and last-written novels, and many characters grow and age. An example would be the Vicar's nephew. In<space/><italics>The Murder at the Vicarage</italics>, the Reverend Clement's nephew Dennis is a teenager. In<space/><italics>The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side</italics>, it is mentioned that the nephew is now grown and successful and has a career. The effects of aging are seen on Miss Marple, such as needing a vacation after illness in<space/><italics><link><target>A Caribbean Mystery</target></link></italics>.</paragraph><paragraph>Little is known about Marple's background, except that she has two younger sisters. One of them is the mother of<space/><link><target>Raymond West (character)</target><part>Raymond</part></link>, and the other is mother to Mabel Denham, a young woman who was accused of poisoning her husband Geoffrey (<italics><link><target>The Thirteen Problems#The Thumb Mark of St. Peter</target><part>The Thumb Mark of St. Peter</part></link></italics>).</paragraph><heading level='2'>Novels featuring Miss Marple</heading><list type='numbered'><listitem><italics><link><target>The Murder at the Vicarage</target></link></italics><space/>(1930)</listitem><listitem><italics><link><target>The Body in the Library</target></link></italics><space/>(1942)</listitem><listitem><italics><link><target>The Moving Finger</target></link></italics><space/>(1943)</listitem><listitem><italics><link><target>A Murder is Announced</target></link></italics><space/>(1950)</listitem><listitem><italics><link><target>They Do It with Mirrors</target></link></italics>, or<space/><italics>Murder with Mirrors</italics><space/>(1952)</listitem><listitem><italics><link><target>A Pocket Full of Rye</target></link></italics><space/>(1953)</listitem><listitem><italics><link><target>4.50 from Paddington</target></link></italics>, or<space/><italics>What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw!</italics><space/>(1957)</listitem><listitem><italics><link><target>The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side</target></link></italics>, or<space/><italics>The Mirror Crack'd</italics><space/>(1962)</listitem><listitem><italics><link><target>A Caribbean Mystery</target></link></italics><space/>(1964)</listitem><listitem><italics><link><target>At Bertram's Hotel</target></link></italics><space/>(1965)</listitem><listitem><italics><link><target>Nemesis (Agatha Christie novel)</target><part>Nemesis</part></link></italics><space/>(1971)</listitem><listitem><italics><link><target>Sleeping Murder</target></link></italics><space/>(written around 1940, published 1976)</listitem></list><heading level='2'>Miss Marple short story collections</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><italics><link><target>The Thirteen Problems</target></link></italics><space/>(short story collection featuring Miss Marple, also published as<space/><italics>The Tuesday Club Murders</italics>) (1932)</listitem><listitem><italics><link><target>Miss Marple's Final Cases and Two Other Stories</target></link></italics><space/>(short stories collected posthumously, also published as<space/><italics>Miss Marple's Final Cases</italics>, but only six of the eight stories actually feature Miss Marple) (written between 1939 and 1954, published 1979)</listitem><listitem><italics>Miss Marple: The Complete Short Stories</italics>, published 1985, includes 20 from 4 sets:<space/><italics><link><target>The Tuesday Club Murders</target></link></italics>,<space/><italics><link><target>The Regatta Mystery</target></link></italics>,<space/><italics><link><target>Three Blind Mice and Other Stories</target></link></italics>, and<space/><italics><link><target>Double Sin and Other Stories</target></link></italics>.</listitem></list><paragraph>Miss Marple also appears in<space/><italics>Greenshaw's Folly</italics>, a short story traditionally included as part of the Poirot collection<space/><italics><link><target>The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding</target></link></italics><space/>(1960).

These were popular and successful light comedies, but were disappointing to Christie herself. Nevertheless, Agatha Christie dedicated the novel<space/><italics><link><target>The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side</target></link></italics><space/>to Rutherford.</paragraph><paragraph>Rutherford presented the character as a bold and eccentric old lady, different from the prim and birdlike character Christie created in her novels. As penned by Christie, Miss Marple has never worked for a living, but the character as portrayed by Margaret Rutherford briefly works as a cook, a hotelier, a painter, a stage actress, a banker, and possibly as a pub landlady, a brewer and an architect. Her education and genteel background are hinted at when she mentions her awards at marksmanship, fencing and equestrianism (although these hints are played for comedic value).</paragraph><paragraph><italics><link><target>Murder, She Said</target></link></italics><space/>(1961, directed by<space/><link><target>George Pollock (director)</target><part>George Pollock</part></link>) was the first of four British MGM productions starring Rutherford. This first film was based on the 1957 novel<space/><italics>4:50 from Paddington</italics><space/>(U.S. title,<space/><italics>What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw!</italics>), and the changes made in the plot were typical of the series. In the film, Mrs. McGillicuddy is cut from the plot. Miss Marple herself sees an apparent murder committed on a train running alongside hers. Likewise, it is Miss Marple herself who poses as a maid to find out the facts of the case, not a young friend of hers who has made a business of it.</paragraph><paragraph>The other Rutherford films, all directed by Pollock, were<space/><italics><link><target>Murder at the Gallop</target></link></italics><space/>(1963), based on the 1953 Hercule Poirot novel<space/><italics><link><target>After the Funeral</target></link></italics><space/>(in this film, she is identified as Miss JTV Marple, though there was no indication as to what the extra initials might stand for);<space/><italics><link><target>Murder Most Foul</target></link></italics><space/>(1964), based on the 1952 Poirot novel<space/><italics><link><target>Mrs McGinty's Dead</target></link></italics>; and<space/><italics><link><target>Murder Ahoy!</target></link></italics><space/>(1964). The last film is not based on any Christie work but displays a few plot elements from<space/><italics>They Do It With Mirrors</italics><space/>(viz., the ship is used as a reform school for wayward boys and one of the teachers uses them as a crime force), and there is a kind of salute to<space/><italics>The Mousetrap</italics>. Rutherford also appeared briefly as Miss Marple in the spoof Hercule Poirot adventure<space/><italics><link><target>The Alphabet Murders</target></link></italics><space/>(1965).</paragraph><paragraph>The music to all four films was composed and conducted by<space/><link><target>Ron Goodwin</target></link><space/>and is still played on radio today. The same theme is used on all four films with slight variations on each. The main theme has a distinct 1960s feel to it and is known to be a highly complex piece of music due to the quick playing of the<space/><link><target>violin</target></link>. The score was written within a couple of weeks by Goodwin who was approached by<space/><link><target>George Pollock (director)</target><part>George Pollock</part></link><space/>after Pollock had heard about him from<space/><link><target>Stanley Black</target></link>. Black had worked with Pollock on &quot;Stranger in Town&quot; in 1957 and years previously<space/><link><target>Stanley Black</target></link><space/>had used<space/><link><target>Ron Goodwin</target></link><space/>as his orchestrator.</paragraph><paragraph>Rutherford, who was 70 years old when the first film was made, insisted that she wear her own clothes during the filming of the movie, as well as having her real-life husband,<space/><link><target>Stringer Davis</target></link>, appear alongside her as the character 'Mr Stringer'. The Rutherford films are frequently repeated on television in Germany, and in that country Miss Marple is generally identified with Rutherford's quirky portrayal.<extension extension_name='ref' name="autogenerated1"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/mystery/marple2/shoes.html</arg><arg name="title">Filling Miss Marple's Shoes</arg><arg name="first">Phil</arg><arg name="last">Clymer</arg><arg name="accessdate">2012-03-07</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Angela Lansbury</heading><paragraph>In 1980,<space/><link><target>Angela Lansbury</target></link><space/>played Miss Marple in<space/><italics><link><target>The Mirror Crack'd</target></link></italics><space/>(EMI, directed by<space/><link><target>Guy Hamilton</target></link>), based on Christie's 1962 novel.
