It has been speculated<template><target>By whom</target><arg name="date">April 2014</arg></template><space/>that Commodore had already sold out the remaining stocks of Amiga 500s, before the run up to the profitable Christmas sales period. In order to make enough A500s before Christmas, Commodore used stocks of the new 8A revision motherboards destined for the A500+. Many users were unaware that they were purchasing anything other than a standard Amiga 500. Although the Amiga 500+ was an improvement to the Amiga 500, it was minor. It was discontinued and replaced by the<space/><link><target>Amiga 600</target></link><space/>in summer 1992, making it the shortest lived Amiga model.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Reason for design</heading><paragraph>Commodore created the A500+ for a couple of reasons. The first was cost reduction; minor changes were made to the motherboard to make it cheaper to produce. It was also so that Commodore could introduce the new version of the<space/><link><target>AmigaOS</target><part>Amiga Operating system</part></link>, 2.04.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Compatibility problems</heading><paragraph>Due to the new Kickstart, quite a few popular games (such as<space/><link><target>Treasure Island Dizzy</target></link>,<space/><link><target>SWIV</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge</target></link>) failed to work on the Amiga 500+, and some people took them back to dealers demanding an original Kickstart 1.3 Amiga 500. This problem was solved by third parties who produced Kickstart<space/><link><target>Read-only memory</target><part>ROM</part></link><space/><link><target>switching boards</target></link>, that could allow the Amiga 500+ to be downgraded to Kickstart 1.2 or 1.3. It also encouraged game developers to use better programming habits, which was important since Commodore already had plans for the introduction of the next-generation<space/><link><target>Amiga 1200</target></link><space/>computer. A program, Relokick, was also released (and included with an issue of CU Amiga) which loaded a<space/><link><target>Kickstart (Amiga)</target><part>Kickstart</part></link><space/>1.3 ROM image into memory and booted the machine into Kickstart 1.3, allowing incompatible software to run. In some cases, updated compatible versions of games were later released, such as budget versions of Lotus 1 and SWIV.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Technical specifications</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Motorola 68000</target></link><space/><link><target>central processing unit</target><part>CPU</part></link><space/>running at<space/><template><target>nowrap</target><arg>7.09 MHz</arg></template><space/>(PAL) /<space/><template><target>nowrap</target><arg>7.16 MHz</arg></template><space/>(NTSC), like its predecessor</listitem><listitem>1 MB of<space/><link><target>Chip RAM</target></link><space/>(very early versions came with 512&amp;nbsp;<link><target>Kibibyte</target><part>KB</part></link>.)</listitem><listitem>Kickstart 2.04 (v37.175)</listitem><listitem>Workbench 37.67 (release 2.04)</listitem><listitem>Built in battery backed RTC (Real Time Clock)</listitem><listitem>Full<space/><link><target>Enhanced Chip Set</target><part>ECS</part></link><space/>chipset including new version of the<space/><link><target>MOS Technology Agnus</target><part>Agnus</part></link><space/>chip and<space/><link><target>Original Amiga chipset#Denise</target><part>Denise</part></link><space/>chip</listitem></list><heading level='2'>See also</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Amiga models and variants</target></link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>Footnotes</heading><paragraph><template><target>reflist</target></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>CBM_computers</target></template><template><target>Amiga hardware</target></template><template><target>AmigaOS</target></template></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Category:Amiga</target></link></paragraph></article>
