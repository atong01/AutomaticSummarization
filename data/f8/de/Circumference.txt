'''Circumference''' (from Latin ''circumferentia'', meaning "carrying around") is the linear distance around the [[Edge_(geometry)|edge]] of a closed [[curve]] or circular object.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~pwbrock/files/UNIT9.3.pdf | title =Perimeter, Area and Circumference | author =[[San Diego State University]] | publisher =[[Addison-Wesley]] | year =2004}}</ref> The circumference of a [[circle]] is of special importance in [[geometry]] and [[trigonometry]]. Informally "circumference" may also refer to the edge itself rather than to the length of the edge. Circumference is a special case of [[perimeter]]: the perimeter is the length around any closed figure, but conventionally "perimeter" is typically used in reference to a [[polygon]] while "circumference" typically refers to a [[continuously differentiable]] curve.

== Circumference of a circle ==

The circumference of a circle is the distance around it. The term is used when measuring physical objects, as well as when considering abstract geometric forms.

=== Relationship with Pi ===
The circumference of a [[circle]] relates to one of the most important [[mathematical constant]]s in all of [[mathematics]]. This [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]], [[pi]], is represented by the [[Greek letter]] [[Pi (letter)|{{pi}}]]. The numerical value of {{pi}} is 3.14159 26535 89793 ... (see {{OEIS2C|id=A000796}}). Pi is defined as the [[ratio]] of a circle's circumference {{math|''C''}} to its [[diameter]] {{math|''d''}}:

:<math> \pi = \frac{C}{d}</math>

Or, equivalently, as the ratio of the circumference to twice the [[radius]]. The above formula can be rearranged to solve for the circumference:

:<math>{C}=\pi\cdot{d}=2\pi\cdot{r}.\!</math>

The use of the mathematical constant {{pi}} is ubiquitous in mathematics, engineering, and science. The constant ratio of circumference to radius <math>{C}/{r} = 2\pi</math> also has many uses in mathematics, engineering, and science. These uses include but are not limited to [[radian]]s, [[computer programming]], and [[physical constants]]. The Greek letter {{tau}} (tau) is sometimes used to represent this constant, but is not generally accepted as proper notation.

== Circumference of an ellipse ==
The [[ellipse#Circumference|circumference of an ellipse]] can be expressed in terms of the [[complete elliptic integral of the second kind]].

== Circumference of a graph ==
In [[graph theory]] the circumference of a [[graph (mathematics)|graph]] refers to the longest [[cycle (graph theory)|cycle]] contained in that graph.
