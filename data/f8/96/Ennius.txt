==Biography==
[[File:Ny Carlsberg Glyptothek - Doppelherme Vergil-Ennius.jpg|thumb|[[Ny Carlsberg Glyptothek Copenhagen]]. Double herm with the portrait of the Roman poets [[Virgil]] or Ennius]]

Ennius was born at Rudiae, an old [[Italic peoples|Italian]] (predominantly [[Osci|Oscan]])<ref>Young Sellar, William, The Roman Poets of the Republic, Cambridge University Press, 2011, ISBN 978-1-108-02982-7, p. 64: an old Italian town (the epithet "vetustae" is applied to it by Silius) which had been partially Hellenised, but still retained its native traditions and the use of the Oscan language</ref> town historically founded by the [[Messapians]]. Here [[Oscan language|Oscan]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Latin language|Latin]] languages were in contact with one another; according to [[Aulus Gellius]] 17.17.1, Ennius referred to this heritage by saying he had "three hearts" (''Quintus Ennius tria corda habere sese dicebat, quod loqui Graece et Osce et Latine sciret'').

Ennius continued the nascent literary tradition by writing [[praetexta]]e, [[tragedy|tragedies]], and [[Fabula palliata|palliatae]], as well as his most famous work, a historic epic called the ''[[Annales (Ennius)|Annales]]''. Other minor works include the  ''Epicharmus'',  the ''Euhemerus'', the ''Hedyphagetica'', and ''Saturae''.

The ''Epicharmus'' presented an account of the gods and the physical operations of the [[universe]].  In it, the poet dreamed he had been transported after [[death]] to some place of heavenly enlightenment.

The ''Euhemerus'' presented a [[theology|theological]] doctrine of a vastly different type in a mock-simple prose style modelled on the Greek of [[Euhemerus]] of Messene and several other theological writers.  According to this doctrine, the gods of [[Mount Olympus (Mountain)|Olympus]] were not supernatural powers still actively intervening in the affairs of [[man|men]], but great [[general]]s, [[Politician|statesmen]] and [[inventor]]s of olden times commemorated after death in extraordinary ways.

The ''Hedyphagetica'' took much of its substance from the [[gastronomy|gastronomical]] [[Epic poetry|epic]] of [[Archestratus|Archestratus of Gela]].  The eleven extant [[hexameter]]s have prosodical features avoided in the more serious ''Annales''.

The remains of six books of ''Saturae'' show a considerable variety of metres.  There are signs that Ennius varied the metre sometimes even within a composition.  A frequent theme was the social life of Ennius himself and his upper-class Roman friends and their intellectual conversation.

The ''[[Annales (Ennius)|Annales]]'' was an [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] in fifteen books, later expanded to eighteen, covering Roman history from the fall of [[Troy]] in 1184 BC down to the censorship of [[Cato the Elder]] in 184 BC.  It was the first Latin poem to adopt the [[dactylic hexameter]] metre used in Greek epic and didactic poetry,<ref>{{cite web|title=FJCL Latin Literature Study Guide|url=http://www.fjcl.org/uploads/4/3/4/0/4340783/latin_lit_study_guide.pdf|publisher=Florida Junior Classical League|accessdate=2 March 2014}}</ref> leading it to become the standard metre for these genres in Latin poetry.  The ''Annals'' became a school text for Roman schoolchildren, eventually supplanted by [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]''. About 600 lines survive. A copy of the work is among the Latin rolls of the [[Herculaneum]] library.

Ennius was said to have considered himself a reincarnation of [[Homer]].<ref>[[Michael Grant (author)|Michael Grant]], in a footnote to "On the Good Life" by Cicero, Penguin Books, 1971.</ref>  Early in the poem Homer appears to the narrator, claiming that Ennius now has Homer's soul, which has also once been a peacock (frr. 4-14 Warmington, scholia to Perseus 6.9-11).
