'''Biostatistics''' (or '''biometry''') is the application of [[statistics]] to a wide range of topics in [[biology]]. The science of biostatistics encompasses the design of biological [[experiment]]s, especially in [[medicine]], [[pharmacy]], [[agriculture]] and [[fisheries|fishery]]; the collection, summarization, and analysis of data from those experiments; and the interpretation of, and inference from, the results. A major branch of this is medical biostatistics,<ref>{{cite book|title=Medical Biostatistics|author=[[Abhaya Indrayan]]|publisher=CRC Press|year=2012|ISBN= 978-1-4398-8414-0}}</ref> which is exclusively concerned with medicine and health.

== History ==
Biostatistical reasoning and modeling were of critical importance to the foundation theories of modern biology. In the early 1900s, after the rediscovery of [[Gregor Mendel]]'s [[Mendelian inheritance]] work, the gaps in understanding between [[genetics]] and evolutionary [[Darwinism]] led to vigorous debate among biometricians, such as [[Walter Frank Raphael Weldon|Walter Weldon]] and [[Karl Pearson]], and Mendelians, such as [[Charles Benedict Davenport|Charles Davenport]], [[William Bateson]] and [[Wilhelm Johannsen]]. By the 1930s, statisticians and models built on statistical reasoning had helped to resolve these differences and to produce the neo-Darwinian [[modern evolutionary synthesis]].

The leading figures in the establishment of [[population genetics]] and this synthesis all relied on statistics and developed its use in biology.
* [[Ronald Fisher]] developed several basic statistical methods in support of his work studying the field experiments at [[Rothamsted Research]], including in his 1930 book ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]''
* [[Sewall G. Wright]] developed [[F-statistics]] and methods of computing them 
* [[J. B. S. Haldane]]'s book, ''The Causes of Evolution'', reestablished natural selection as the premier mechanism of evolution by explaining it in terms of the mathematical consequences of Mendelian genetics.

These individuals and the work of other biostatisticians, [[mathematical biology|mathematical biologists]], and statistically inclined geneticists helped bring together [[evolutionary biology]] and [[genetics]] into a consistent, coherent whole that could begin to be [[Statistics|quantitative]]ly modeled.

In parallel to this overall development, the pioneering work of [[D'Arcy Thompson]] in ''On Growth and Form'' also helped to add quantitative discipline to biological study.

Despite the fundamental importance and frequent necessity of statistical reasoning, there may nonetheless have been a tendency among biologists to distrust or deprecate results which are not [[qualitative data|qualitatively]] apparent. One anecdote describes [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]] banning the [[Friden, Inc.|Friden calculator]] from his department at [[Caltech]], saying "Well, I am like a guy who is prospecting for gold along the banks of the Sacramento River in 1849. With a little intelligence, I can reach down and pick up big nuggets of gold. And as long as I can do that, I'm not going to let any people in my department waste scarce resources in [[placer mining]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tilsonfunds.com/MungerUCSBspeech.pdf|title=Academic Economics: Strengths and Faults After Considering Interdisciplinary Needs|author=Charles T.

== Scope and training programs ==
Almost all educational programmes in biostatistics are at [[postgraduate]] level. They are most often found in schools of public health, affiliated with schools of medicine, forestry, or agriculture, or as a focus of application in departments of statistics.

In the [[United States]], where several universities have dedicated biostatistics departments, many other top-tier universities integrate biostatistics faculty into statistics or other departments, such as [[epidemiology]]. Thus, departments carrying the name "biostatistics" may exist under quite different structures. For instance, relatively new biostatistics departments have been founded with a focus on [[bioinformatics]] and [[computational biology]], whereas older departments, typically affiliated with schools of [[public health]], will have more traditional lines of research involving epidemiological studies and [[clinical trial]]s as well as bioinformatics. In larger universities where both a statistics and a biostatistics department exist, the degree of integration between the two departments may range from the bare minimum to very close collaboration. In general, the difference between a statistics program and a biostatistics program is twofold: (i) statistics departments will often host theoretical/methodological research which are less common in biostatistics programs and (ii) statistics departments have lines of research that may include biomedical applications but also other areas such as industry ([[quality control]]), business and [[economics]] and biological areas other than medicine.

== Recent developments in modern biostatistics ==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
The advent of modern computer technology and relatively cheap computing resources have enabled computer-intensive biostatistical methods like [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrapping]] and [[Resampling (statistics)|resampling]] methods. 
Furthermore, new biomedical technologies like [[DNA microarray|microarrays]], [[DNA sequencing|next generation sequencers]] (for genomics) and [[mass spectrometers|mass spectrometry]] (for proteomics) generate enormous amounts of (redundant) data that can only be analyzed with biostatistical methods. For example, a microarray can measure all the genes of the human genome simultaneously, but only a fraction of them will be differentially expressed in diseased vs. non-diseased states. One might encounter the problem of multicolinearity: Due to high intercorrelation between the predictors (in this case say genes), the information of one predictor might be contained in another one. It could be that only 5% of the predictors are responsible for 90% of the variability of the response. In such a case, one would apply the biostatistical technique of dimension reduction (for example via principal component analysis). Classical statistical techniques like linear or logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis do not work well for high dimensional data (i.e. when the number of observations n is smaller than the number of features or predictors p: n < p). As a matter of fact, one can get quite high R<sup>2</sup>-values despite very low predictive power of the statistical model. These classical statistical techniques (esp. least squares linear regression) were developed for low dimensional data (i.e. where the number of observations n is much larger than the number of predictors p: n >> p). In cases of high dimensionality, one should always consider an independent validation test set and the corresponding residual sum of squares (RSS) and R<sup>2</sup> of the validation test set, not those of the training set.

In recent times, [[random forests]] have gained popularity. This technique, invented by the statistician Leo Breiman, generates a lot of decision trees randomly and uses them for classification (In classification the response is on a nominal or ordinal scale, as opposed to regression where the response is on a ratio scale). Decision trees have of course the advantage that you can draw them and interpret them (even with a very basic understanding of mathematics and statistics). Random Forrests have thus been used for clinical decision support systems.

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is a new method for analyzing biological high throughput experiments. With this method, one does not consider the perturbation of single genes but of whole (functionally related) gene sets. These gene sets might be known biochemical pathways or otherwise functionally related genes. The advantage of this approach is that it is more robust: It is more likely that a single gene is found to be falsely perturbed than it is that a whole pathway is falsely perturbed. Furthermore, one can integrate the accumulated knowledge about biochemical pathways (like the [[JAK-STAT signaling pathway]]) using this approach.

==Applications of biostatistics==
* [[Public health]], including [[epidemiology]], [[health services research]], [[nutrition]], [[environmental health]] and healthcare policy & management.
* Design and analysis of [[clinical trial]]s in [[medicine]]
* Assessment of severity state of a patient with prognosis of outcome of a disease.
* [[Population genetics]], and [[statistical genetics]] in order to link variation in [[genotype]] with a variation in [[phenotype]]. This has been used in agriculture to improve crops and farm animals ([[animal breeding]]). In biomedical research, this work can assist in finding candidates for [[gene]] [[alleles]] that can cause or influence predisposition to disease in [[human genetics]]
* Analysis of [[genomics]] data, for example from [[microarray]] or [[proteomics]] experiments.<ref>{{cite book|title=Statistical Analysis of Gene Expression Microarray Data|author=Helen Causton, John Quackenbush and Alvis Brazma|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Microarray Gene Expression Data Analysis: A Beginner's Guide|author=Terry Speed|publisher=Chapman & Hall/CRC|year=2003}}</ref> Often concerning diseases or disease stages.<ref>{{cite book|title=Medical Biostatistics for Complex Diseases|author=Frank Emmert-Streib and Matthias Dehmer|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2010|ISBN= 3-527-32585-9}}</ref>
