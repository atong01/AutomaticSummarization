I was also hustling my own strip and trying to get it published. Before we got to Publishers Syndicate, I went to [[United Media|United Feature]] in New York City with two strips — ''Barney's Beat'' and ''Josie''. [United Feature] told me they liked them both, and they'd like to see more samples, because I didn't bring much. I brought maybe six dailies of ''Barney's Beat'' and six dailies of ''Josie''. That posed a problem for me. I knew I couldn't handle both strips and still keep up with the comic book work, because a syndicated bit was very risky. So, I decided to shelve ''Josie'', and concentrated on ''Willie Lumpkin''. [When that strip ended after] a year, maybe a year and a half[,] I quickly submitted the Josie strip back to the publishers and Harold Anderson, and he sent it back and said, 'It's not what we're looking for, Dan, but keep up the good work,' or words of that kind. Then is when I decided to take it to Archie to see if they could do it as a comic book. I showed it to [[Richard Goldwater]], and he showed it to his father, and a day or two later I got the OK to do it as a comic book.<ref name</arg></template><link><target>File:Lapick inking decarlo archie.png</target><part>left</part><part>400px</part><part>thumb</part><part>Original art panels from &quot;The Reformer&quot; in ''<link><target>Archie's Girls Betty and Veronica</target></link>'' No. 157 (Jan. 1969), featuring (l. to r.)<space/><link><target>Veronica Lodge</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Archie Andrews (comics)</target><part>Archie Andrews</part></link>.<space/><link><target>Penciler</target><part>Penciled</part></link><space/>by DeCarlo,<space/><link><target>inker</target><part>inked</part></link><space/>by<space/><link><target>Rudy Lapick</target></link>.</part></link>Josie was introduced in<space/><italics><link><target>Archie's Pals and Gals</target><part>Archie's Pals 'n' Gals</part></link></italics><space/>No. 23.
