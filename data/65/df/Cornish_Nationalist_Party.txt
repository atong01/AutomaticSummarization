The '''Cornish Nationalist Party''' (CNP), {{lang-kw|Party Kenethlegek Kernow}}, is a [[political party]], founded by Dr [[James Whetter]], who campaigned for [[independence]] for [[Cornwall]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://partikenethlekkernewek.fortunecity.com/index1.html |title=Cornwall's full potential as an independent nation|publisher=Partikenethlekkernewek.fortunecity.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-20}}</ref> It was formed by people who left Cornwall's main nationalist party [[Mebyon Kernow]] on 28 May 1975,<ref name="autogenerated1">''Mebyon Kernow and Cornish Nationalism'' by Dick Cole, Bernard Deacon, and Gary Tregidda</ref> but it is no longer for independence.<ref name="westbriton">{{cite news |author=DaveCDM |title=The Cornish Nationalist Party reforms as a political party |url=http://www.westbriton.co.uk/Cornish-Nationalist-Party-reforms-political-party/story-23025116-detail/story.html|newspaper=[[The West Briton]] |date=2014-10-01 |accessdate=2014-10-21 }}</ref>

A separate party with a similar name (Cornish National Party)<ref name="autogenerated1"/> existed from 1969.<ref>[http://www.gosw.gov.uk/gosw/docs/254795/dev_of_language_literature.doc In 1969 a CNP was formed.] {{wayback|url=http://www.gosw.gov.uk/gosw/docs/254795/dev_of_language_literature.doc |date=20060318114902 }}</ref>

The split with [[Mebyon Kernow]] was based on the same debate that was occurring in most of the other political parties campaigning for [[self-governance|autonomy]] from the [[United Kingdom]] at the time (such as the [[Scottish National Party]] and [[Plaid Cymru]]): whether to be a [[centre-left]] party, appealing to the electorate on a [[social democracy|social democratic]] line, or whether to appeal emotionally on a [[centre-right]] cultural line. Originally, another subject of the split was whether to embrace [[devolution]] as a first step to full [[independence]] (or as the sole step if this was what the electorate wished) or for it to be "all or nothing".<ref name="westbriton" />

The CNP essentially represented a more [[right-wing]] outlook from those who disagree that economic arguments were more likely to win votes than cultural. The CNP worked to preserve the identity of Cornwall and improve its economy, and encouraged links with Cornish people overseas and with other regions with distinct identities. It also gave support to the Cornish language and commemorated [[Thomas Flamank]], a leader of the [[Cornish Rebellion of 1497|Cornish Rebellion]] in 1497, at an annual ceremony at [[Bodmin]] on 27 June each year.

While the CNP were not a racist organisation, there was a perceived image problem from the similarly-styled BNP (the [[nativism (politics)|nativist]] [[British National Party]]). The CNP was for some time seen as more of a pressure group, as it did not put up candidates for any elections, although its visibility and influence within Cornwall is negligible. {{As of|2012}}, it is now registered on the UK political parties register, and so [[Mebyon Kernow]] is no longer the only registered political party based in Cornwall. In April 2009, a news story reported that the CNP had re-formed following a conference in Bodmin;<ref name="westbriton" /> however, it did not contest any elections that year.

Whetter and the CNP still publish a quarterly journal, ''The Cornish Banner'' (''An Baner Kernewek''), within the actions of the Roseland Institute.

A newspaper article and a revamp of the party website in October 2014 state that the party is now to contest elections once more.<ref name="westbriton" />
 
John Le Bretton, vice-chairman of the party, said: "The CNP supports the retention of Cornwall council as a Cornwall-wide authority running Cornish affairs and we call for the British government in Westminster to devolve powers to the council so that decisions affecting Cornwall can be made in Cornwall".

The party's policies include the following:

*Calling for more legislative powers to be given to Cornwall Council. The authority should effectively become the Cornish government, with town and parish councils acting as local government.

*Cornwall council should have a reduction in councillors, with a standardisation of electoral areas and constituencies in throughout Cornwall.

*The Westminster government should appoint a Minister for Cornwall and confirm there will be no further plans to have any parliamentary constituency covering part of Cornwall and Devon.<ref>[http://www.thecnp.co.uk The CNP website]</ref>
