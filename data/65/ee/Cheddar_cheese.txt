'''Cheddar cheese''' is a relatively hard, off-white (or orange if spices such as [[annatto]] are added), sometimes "sharp" (i.e., acidic)-tasting, natural [[cheese]].

==History==
The cheese originates from the village of [[Cheddar, Somerset|Cheddar]] in [[Somerset]], south west England. [[Cheddar Gorge]] on the edge of the village contains a number of [[cave]]s, which provided the ideal humidity and steady temperature for maturing the cheese.<ref name=indy/> Cheddar cheese traditionally had to be made within {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}} of [[Wells Cathedral]].<ref name=curdswhey/>

Cheddar has been produced since at least the 12th century. A [[pipe rolls|pipe roll]] of [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]] from 1170 records the purchase of {{convert|10240|lb|abbr=on}} at a [[Farthing (British coin)|farthing]] per pound (totaling [[£sd|£10.13s.4d]], about £10.67 in [[Decimal Day|decimal currency]]).<ref>{{Cite web| title=History| work=Cheddar Gorge Cheese Company | url=http://www.cheddargorgecheeseco.co.uk/acatalog/about-cheddar-gorge.html | accessdate=1 August 2009}}</ref>  
[[Charles I of England|Charles I]] (1600–1649) also bought cheese from the village.<ref name=indy/>
[[Ancient Rome|Romans]] may have brought the recipe to Britain from the [[Cantal]] region of France.<ref>{{cite book| last1 = Barthélemy| first1 = Roland| last2 = Sperat-Czar| first2 = Arnaud| title = Guide du fromage: Choisir, reconnaître, goûter 1200 fromages du monde| year = 2003| isbn = 978-2-01-236867-5| page = 89 }}</ref>

Central to the modernisation and standardisation of Cheddar cheese was the 19th-century Somerset dairyman [[Joseph Harding]].<ref name="History">{{Cite web| title=History of Cheddar Cheese | work=Icons of England | url=http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/cheddar-cheese/biography/history-of-cheddar-finished | accessdate=9 May 2007}}</ref>
For his technical innovations, promotion of dairy hygiene, and volunteer dissemination of modern cheese-making techniques, he has been dubbed "the father of Cheddar cheese".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Heeley |first=Anne |author2=Mary Vidal |title=Joseph Harding, Cheddar Cheese-Maker |year=1996 |publisher=Friends of the Abbey Barn |location=Glastonbury }}</ref>
Harding introduced new equipment to the process of cheese-making, including his "revolving breaker" for curd cutting, saving much manual effort.<ref>''Transactions of the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland'', [[Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland]], 1866-7 volume 1, Aberdeen</ref><ref>Christabel Susan Lowry Orwin, Edith Holt Whetham, "History of British Agriculture, 1846–1914", ''Agriculture'' (1964), page 145</ref>
The "Joseph Harding method" was the first modern system for Cheddar production based upon scientific principles. Harding stated that Cheddar cheese is "not made in the field, nor in the [[byre]], nor even in the cow, it is made in the dairy".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gourmetbritain.com/encyclo_entry.php?item=2391 |title=Encyclopedia – Harding, Joseph |publisher=Gourmet Britain |accessdate=23 June 2009}}</ref> His wife and he were behind the introduction of the cheese into Scotland and North America. His sons, Henry and William Harding, were responsible for introducing Cheddar cheese production to Australia<ref>{{cite book | title=From Artisans to "Factories": The Interpenetration of Craft and Industry in English Cheese-Making 1650–1950 | first1=Richard | last1=Blundel | first2=Angela | last2=Tregear | publisher=Enterprise and Society | date=17 October 2006}}</ref> and facilitating the establishment of the cheese industry in New Zealand, respectively.

During the [[Second World War]], and for nearly a decade after, most milk in Britain was used for the making of one single kind of cheese nicknamed "government Cheddar" as part of war economies and [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|rationing]].<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.cooksinfo.com/government-cheddar-cheese |title=Government Cheddar Cheese |publisher= Practically Edible |accessdate=30 April 2011}}</ref> This almost resulted in wiping out all other cheese production in the country. Before the [[First World War]], more than 3,500 cheese producers were in Britain; fewer than 100 remained after the Second World War.<ref>{{Cite news| url= http://www.thestar.com/News/article/264784 | title= Cool Britannia rules the whey  |last=Potter |first=Mich | publisher= |work= [[Toronto Star]] | date= 9 October 2007 | accessdate= 4 January 2009}}</ref>

According to a [[United States Department of Agriculture]] researcher, Cheddar cheese is the world's most popular variety of cheese, and the most studied type of cheese in scientific publications.<ref>{{cite news |last=Tunick |first=Michael H. |date=23 February 2014 |title=The biggest cheese?

==Process==
[[File:Cheese curds 2.jpg|thumb|left|A bowl of [[cheese curds]]]]
{{Main|Manufacture of cheddar cheese}}

The [[curd]]s and [[whey]] are separated using [[rennet]], an enzyme complex normally produced from the stomachs of newborn calves (in [[vegetarian]] or [[kosher]] cheeses, bacterial, yeast or mould-derived [[chymosin]] is used).<ref name=telegraph /><ref>{{Cite web| url= http://www.vegsoc.org/info/cheese.html | publisher= [[Vegetarian Society]] | title= Information Sheet – Cheese & Rennet | accessdate= 10 March 2008}}</ref>

"Cheddaring" refers to an additional step in the production of Cheddar cheese where, after heating, the curd is kneaded with salt, cut into cubes to drain the whey, and then stacked and turned.<ref name="telegraph">{{Cite news| url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/wine/main.jhtml?xml=/wine/2005/06/18/edsavvy18.xml | publisher= | work= The Daily Telegraph | title= Savvy shopper: Cheddar | date= 18 June 2005 | accessdate= 10 March 2008 | location=London | first=Harry | last=Mount}}</ref> Strong, extra-mature Cheddar, sometimes called vintage, needs to be matured for up to 15 months. The cheese is kept at a constant temperature, often requiring special facilities. As with other hard cheese varieties produced worldwide, [[cave]]s provide an ideal environment for maturing cheese; still, today, some Cheddar cheese is matured in the caves at [[Wookey Hole Caves|Wookey Hole]] and [[Cheddar Gorge]]. Additionally, some versions of Cheddar cheese are [[Smoking (cooking)|smoked]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Hbuso0owJMAC&pg=PT171|title=American Cheeses|work=google.com}}</ref><ref>Kelly Jaggers, ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=2xUCxt9ucKQC&pg=PA104 Moufflet: More Than 100 Gourmet Muffin Recipes That Rise to Any Occasion]'',  p. 104.</ref>

==Character==
[[File:MidSomerset Show 170803.jpg|left|thumb|Cheddar cheeses on display at the Mid Somerset Show]]
The ideal quality of the original Somerset Cheddar was described by Joseph Harding in 1864 as "close and firm in texture, yet mellow in character or quality; it is rich with a tendency to melt in the mouth, the flavour full and fine, approaching to that of a hazelnut".<ref>''Transactions of the New-York State Agricultural Society for the Year 1864'', page 232, volume 14 1865, Albany</ref>

Cheddar made in the classical way tends to have a sharp, pungent flavour, often slightly earthy. Its texture is firm, with farmhouse traditional Cheddar being slightly crumbly; it should also, if mature, contain large [[cheese crystals]] consisting of [[calcium lactate]]&nbsp;– often precipitated when matured for times longer than six months.<ref name="Phadungath">{{Cite thesis | last= Phadungath | first = Chanokphat| title = The Efficacy of Sodium Gluconate as a Calcium Lactate Crystal Inhibitor in Cheddar Cheese | type = |chapter = | url = http://purl.umn.edu/116278 | year = 2011 | publisher = University of Minnesota | accessdate = 12 October 2013}}</ref>

Cheddar can be a deep to pale yellow (off-white) colour, or a yellow-orange colour when certain plant extracts are added. One commonly used spice is [[annatto]], extracted from seeds of the tropical [[Achiote|achiote tree]]. Annatto is added to give Cheddar a sweet, nutty flavour. The largest producer of Cheddar cheese in the United States, [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]], uses a combination of annatto and oleoresin paprika, an extract of the lipophilic (oily) portion of [[paprika]].<ref name="df">{{cite book| last = Feldman| first = David| title = When Do Fish Sleep?

Cheddar cheese was sometimes (and still can be found) packaged in black wax, but was more commonly packaged in larded cloth, which was impermeable to contaminants, but still allowed the cheese to "breathe".

The [[Slow Food|Slow Food Movement]] has created a Cheddar [[Presidium]],<ref>{{Cite web|author=Blulab sas |url=http://www.slowfoodfoundation.org/eng/presidi/dettaglio.lasso?cod=148 |title=La Fondazione&nbsp;– slow food per la biodiversità&nbsp;– ONLUS |publisher=Slowfoodfoundation.org |accessdate=23 June 2009}}</ref> claiming that only three cheeses should be called "original Cheddar". Their specifications, which go further than the "West Country Farmhouse Cheddar" [[Protected Designation of Origin|PDO]], require that Cheddar cheese be made in Somerset and with traditional methods, such as using raw milk, traditional animal [[rennet]], and a cloth wrapping.<ref>{{Cite web| title=Presidia Artisan Somerset Cheddar | work=The Slow Food Foundation | url=http://www.slowfoodfoundation.com/eng/presidi/dettaglio.lasso?cod=148 | accessdate=9 May 2007}}</ref>

==International production==
The Cheddar cheese name is used internationally; its name does not have a PDO, but the use of the name "West Country Farmhouse Cheddar" does. As well as the United Kingdom, countries making Cheddar cheese presently include Australia, Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Africa, Sweden, and the United States. Cheddars can be industrial or [[artisan cheese]]s. The flavour, colour, and quality of industrial cheese varies significantly, and food packaging will usually indicate a strength, such as mild, medium, strong, tasty, sharp, extra sharp, mature, old, or vintage; this may indicate the maturation period, or food additives used to enhance the flavour. Artisan varieties develop strong and diverse flavours over time.

===Australia===
As of 2013, Cheddar accounts for over 55% of the Australian cheese market, with average annual consumption around {{convert|7.5|kg|abbr=on}} per person.<ref>http://www.dairyaustralia.com.au/~/media/Documents/Stats%20and%20markets/In%20Focus/Australian%20Dairy%20Industry%20In%20Focus%202013.pdf</ref>  Cheddar is so ubiquitous that the name is rarely used: instead, Cheddar is sold by strength alone as e.g. "mild", "tasty" or "sharp".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.begacheese.com.au/products/natural/|title=Natural|publisher=}}</ref>

===Canada===
Following a wheat midge outbreak in Canada in the mid-19th century, farmers in [[Ontario]] began to convert to [[dairy farming]] in large numbers, and Cheddar cheese became their main exportable product, even being exported to England. By the turn of the 20th century, 1,242 Cheddar factories were in Ontario, and Cheddar had become Canada’s second-largest export after timber.<ref name="thewalrus.ca">{{cite web|url=http://thewalrus.ca/manufacturing-taste/|title=Manufacturing Taste|work=thewalrus.ca}}</ref> Cheddar exports totaled {{convert|234000000|lbs|abbr=on}} in 1904, but by 2012, Canada was a net importer of cheese. [[James L. Kraft]] grew up on a dairy farm in Ontario, before moving to Chicago. According to the writer Sarah Champman, "Although we cannot wholly lay the decline of cheese craft in Canada at the feet of James Lewis Kraft, it did correspond with the rise of Kraft’s processed cheese empire."<ref name="thewalrus.ca"/> Most Canadian Cheddar is produced by a number of large companies in Ontario, though other provinces produce some and some smaller artisanal producers exist. The annual production is 120,000 tons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianliving.com/food/__all_you_need_is_cheese/types_of_cheddar_cheese.php|title=Types of Cheddar cheese, Canadian Living|work=CanadianLiving.com}}</ref> It is aged a minimum of three months, but much of it is held for much longer, up to 10 years.

Canadian Cheddar cheese soup is a featured dish at the [[Canada (Epcot)|Canada pavilion]] at [[Epcot]], in [[Walt Disney World Resort|Walt Disney World]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allears.net/din/rec_ched.htm|title=Recipe for Canadian Cheddar cheese soup at Epcot|publisher=}}</ref>

===New Zealand===
Much of the Cheddar cheese in New Zealand is factory produced, but of good quality. Most of it is sold young within the country. The [[Anchor (brand)|Anchor]] dairy company ships New Zealand Cheddars to the UK, where they mature for another year or so.<ref name=Ridgway77/>

===United States===
[[File:Bravo Cheddar.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Cheddar-style cheese from Bravo Farms, [[Traver, California]]]]
The state of [[Wisconsin]] produces the most Cheddar cheese in the US; other centers of production include: [[California]], [[Idaho]], [[upstate New York]], [[Vermont]], [[Oregon]], [[Texas]], and [[Oklahoma]]. It is sold in several varieties (mild, medium, sharp, extra-sharp, New York-style, white-, and Vermont). New York-style Cheddar is particularly "sharp"/acidic, but tends to be somewhat softer than the milder-tasting varieties. Cheddar that does not contain annatto is frequently labelled "white Cheddar" or "Vermont Cheddar" (regardless of whether it was actually produced there). Vermont's three creameries produce what is regarded as first-class Cheddar cheeses: the [[Cabot Creamery]], which produces the 16-month-old "Private Stock Cheddar", the Grafton Village Company, and Shelburne Farms.<ref name="Ridgway77">Ridgway, Judy. ''The Cheese Companion''. Running Press, 2004, p. 77.</ref>

Some cheeses called "Cheddar" are actually flavoured [[processed cheese]]s or "cheese foods"; they often bear little resemblance to their natural namesakes. Examples include [[Easy Cheese]]: a cheese-food packaged in a pressurized spray can; also, as packs of square, sliced,  individually wrapped, "processed cheese" (sometimes also pasteurised).

Cheddar is one of several products used by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] to track the status of America's overall [[dairy industry]]; reports are issued weekly detailing prices and production quantities.
