'''Active Server Pages''' ('''ASP'''), later known as '''Classic ASP''' or '''ASP Classic''', is [[Microsoft]]'s first [[server-side scripting|server-side]] [[Active Scripting|script engine]] for [[dynamic web page|dynamically generated web pages]]. [[ASP.NET]], first released in January 2002, has superseded ASP.

== History ==
Initially released as an add-on to [[Internet Information Services]] (IIS) via the [[Windows_NT_4.0#Option_Pack|Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack]] (ca. 1996), it is included as a free component of [[Windows Server]] (since the initial release of [[Windows 2000 Server]]). There have been three versions of ASP, each introduced with different versions of IIS:<ref>http://www.visualsolutions-co.com/services/what-is-asp.php</ref>

* ASP 1.0 was released on December 1996 as part of IIS 3.0
* ASP 2.0 was released on September 1997 as part of IIS 4.0
* ASP 3.0 was released on November 2000 as part of IIS 5.0

ASP 2.0 provides six built-in [[Object (computer science)|objects]]: Application, ASPError, Request, Response, Server, and Session. <code>Session</code> object, for example, represents a [[Session (computer science)|session]] that maintains the state of [[Variable (programming)|variables]] from page to page.<ref>The session data is kept server-side, the ID is saved as a [[HTTP Cookie]]. Source: [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms972338.aspx ASP and Web Session Management], Microsoft</ref> The [[Active Scripting]] engine's support of the [[Component Object Model]] (COM) enables ASP [[website]]s to access functionality in compiled [[Library (computing)|libraries]] such as [[Dynamic-link library|DLLs]].

ASP 3.0 does not differ greatly from ASP 2.0 but it does offer some additional enhancements such as Server.Transfer method, Server.Execute method, and an enhanced ASPError object. ASP 3.0 also enables buffering by default and optimized the engine for better performance.

ASP remains supported until 14 January 2020 on [[Windows 7]].<ref name=":0">{{cite web|title=Active Server Pages (ASP) support in Windows|url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2669020|website=Support|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=11 August 2015|date=30 January 2012|edition=4.0}}</ref> The use of ASP pages will be supported on [[Windows 8]] for a minimum of 10 years from the [[Windows 8]] release date.<ref name=":0" />

== Architecture ==
ASP use [[server-side scripting]] to generate contents that would be sent to the visitor's web browser. The ASP interpreter reads and executes all script code between <% and %> tags, the result of which is content generation. These scripts are written using [[VBScript]], [[JScript]] and [[PerlScript]]. The <code>@Language</code> directive, the {{tag|script|s|params=language="manu" runat="server"}} syntax or server configuration can be used to select the language. In the example below, Response.Write Now() is in an [[HTML]] page; it would be dynamically replaced by the current time of the server.
{|
! Server side !! What client receives
|- style="vertical-align:top"
|<syntaxhighlight lang="asp">The server's current time:<br />
<%
Response.Write Now()
%>
</syntaxhighlight>
|<syntaxhighlight lang="asp">The server's current time:<br />
8/11/2015 6:24:45 PM</syntaxhighlight>
|}

Web pages with the ''.asp'' [[filename extension]] use ASP, although some web sites disguise their choice of scripting language for security purposes by using the more common ''.htm'' or ''.html'' extensions. Pages with the ''.aspx'' extension use compiled [[ASP.NET]]; however, ASP.NET pages may still include some ASP scripting. The introduction of ASP.NET led to use of the term ''Classic ASP'' for the original technology.

ASP runs only on [[Windows]].  A number of products emulate some of the functionality of Classic ASP on non-Microsoft web servers.  Apache::ASP for example ports Classic ASP to the Apache Web Server, but can only interpret [[PerlScript]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Apache::ASP|url=http://www.apache-asp.org/index.html|accessdate=9 October 2013}}</ref>

Sun Java System ASP (formerly ChiliSoft ASP) was a popular and reportedly complete emulator,<ref name="Weissinger2009">{{cite book|last=Weissinger|first=Keyton |title=ASP in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tUHeRwhGKcgC|accessdate=9 October 2013|date=6 October 2009|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4493-7959-9}}</ref> but it has been discontinued.


===The Request object===
Allows data to be read that was sent by the client browser: Form, [[Querystring]], and [[HTTP Cookie]]. It also provides information on the server, the client browser, and retrieve [[HTTP Cookie]] stored on the visitor's machine. Can retrieve data from a form using both methods [[HTTP]]:

Request.Form reads data sent by POST.

Request.QueryString reads data sent by GET.

<source lang="asp">
<%
Response.Write("Welcome " & Server.HTMLEncode(Request.QueryString("name")) & "!")
%>
</source>

===The Response object===
Can send information to the client, such as the writing of the text on a page or [[HTTP Cookie]].

<source lang="asp">
<%
If (Len(Request.QueryString("name")) > 0) Then
     Response.Cookies("name") = Request.QueryString("name") 
End If

Response.Write "Welcome " & Server.HTMLEncode(Response.Cookies("name")) & "!"
%>
</source>
<br>
<source lang="asp">
<%
If (Len(Request.QueryString("name")) > 0) Then
     Response.Cookies("name") = Request.QueryString("name") 
End If

Response.Write "Welcome " & Server.HTMLEncode(Response.Cookies("name")) & "!"
%>
</source>

===The Server object===
Allows connections to databases (ADO), filesystem, and use of components installed on the server.

<source lang="asp">
<%
Dim oAdoCon, oAdoRec, oAdoStm, oCdoCon, oCdoMsg, oSciDic, oSciFsm, oMswAdr

Set oAdoCon = Server.CreateObject("ADODB.Connection")
Set oAdoRec = Server.CreateObject("ADODB.Recordset")
Set oAdoStm = Server.CreateObject("ADODB.Stream")
Set oCdoCon = Server.CreateObject("CDO.Configuration")
Set oCdoMsg = Server.CreateObject("CDO.Message")
Set oSciDic = Server.CreateObject("Scripting.Dictionary")
Set oSciFsm = Server.CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
Set oMswAdr = Server.CreateObject("MSWC.AdRotator")
%> 
</source>

===The Application object===
Stores global variables.

<source lang="asp">
<%
Application("Ali") = "My ASP Application"
Response.Write("Welcome to " & Server.HTMLEncode(Application("Ali")) & "!")
%>
</source>

===The Session object===
Stores variables accessible only to a single visitor.

<source lang="asp">
<%
If (Len(Request.QueryString("name")) > 0) Then
     Session("name") = Request.QueryString("name") 
End If

Response.Write("Welcome " & Server.HTMLEncode(Session("name")) & "!")
%>
</source>

===The Error object===
Allows for the management of errors.

<source Lang="asp">
<%
On Error Resume Next

Dim o_Error
Set o_Error = Server.GetLastError()

Response.Write("Asp Code: " & Server.HTMLEncode(o_Error.AspCode) & "<BR />")
Response.Write("Asp Description: " & Server.HTMLEncode(o_Error.AspDescription) & "<BR />")
Response.Write("Category: " & Server.HTMLEncode(o_Error.Category) & "<BR />")
Response.Write("Column: " & Server.HTMLEncode(o_Error.Column) & "<BR />")
Response.Write("Description: " & Server.HTMLEncode(o_Error.Description) & "<BR />")
Response.Write("File: " & Server.HTMLEncode(o_Error.File) & "<BR />")
Response.Write("Line: " & Server.HTMLEncode(o_Error.Line) & "<BR />")
Response.Write("Number: " & Server.HTMLEncode(o_Error.Number) & "<BR />")
Response.Write("Source: " & Server.HTMLEncode(o_Error.Source) & "")

If (Err.Number <> 0) Then 
     Err.Clear 
End If 
%>
</source>
