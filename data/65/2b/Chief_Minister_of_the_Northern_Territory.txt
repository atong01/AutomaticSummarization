The '''Chief Minister of the Northern Territory''' is the [[head of government]] of the [[Northern Territory]].  The office is the equivalent of a [[Premiers of the Australian states|Premier]] in a state.  

The Chief Minister is formally appointed by the [[Administrator of the Northern Territory of Australia|Administrator]], who in normal circumstances will appoint the head of whichever party holds the majority of seats in the [[Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory]]. In times of constitutional crisis, the Administrator can appoint someone else as Chief Minister, however, this has never occurred.

The incumbent Chief Minister of the Northern Territory is [[Adam Giles]], representing the [[Country Liberal Party]]. On 2 February 2015, the CLP elected [[Willem Westra van Holthe]] as its leader, who hoped to replace Giles as Chief Minister.<ref name=wwvh>{{cite news|last1=Dunlevie|first1=James|title=Adam Giles dumped as NT chief minister in late-night coup, Willem Westra van Holthe elected leader|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-02-03/adam-giles-replaced-as-northern-territory-chief-minister/6064564|accessdate=3 February 2015|work=ABC News|date=3 February 2015}}</ref> On 3 February, Giles refused to resign as Chief Minister, and the swearing-in of Westra van Holthe which had been scheduled for 11:00 local time (01:30 UTC), was delayed.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-02-03/nt-chief-minister-giles-refuses-to-quit-after-leadership-coup/6065200</ref> After a party room meeting, Giles announced that he would stay on as leader, with Westra van Holthe as his deputy.<ref name=sbsnews>{{cite news|title=Adam Giles remains NT chief minister|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2015/02/03/adam-giles-remains-nt-chief-minister|accessdate=3 February 2015|work=SBS News|date=3 February 2015}}</ref>

| {{Australian politics/party colours/CLP}}|&nbsp; || Dr [[Goff Letts]] <ref>While the [[Northern Territory Legislative Assembly]] was created in 1974, self-government was not granted until 1978. As a result, members of the executive in the first parliament (1974–1977) and the first eighteen months of the second were known by alternative titles. While Dr [[Goff Letts]] and his successor [[Paul Everingham]] were officially known as Majority Leaders, their function was effectively the same as that of a Chief Minister from 1978.</ref> || [[Country Liberal Party|Country Liberal]] || 1974–1977
