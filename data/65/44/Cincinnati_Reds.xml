In 1876, Cincinnati became one of the charter members of the new<space/><link><target>National League</target></link>, but the club ran afoul of league organizer and long-time president<space/><link><target>William Hulbert</target></link><space/>for selling beer during games and renting out their ballpark on Sundays. Both were important activities to entice the city's large<space/><link><target>Germans</target><part>German</part></link><space/>population. While Hulbert made clear his distaste for both beer and Sunday baseball at the founding of the league, neither practice was actually against league rules in those early years. On October 6, 1880, however, seven of the eight team owners pledged at a special league meeting to formally ban both beer and Sunday baseball at the regular league meeting that December. Only Cincinnati president W. H. Kennett refused to sign the pledge, so the other owners formally expelled Cincinnati for violating a rule that would not actually go into effect for two more months.</paragraph><paragraph>Cincinnati's expulsion from the National League incensed<space/><italics>Cincinnati Enquirer</italics><space/>sports editor<space/><link><target>O. P. Caylor</target></link>, who made two attempts to form a new league on behalf of the receivers for the now bankrupt Reds franchise. When these attempts failed, he formed a new independent ballclub known as the Red Stockings in the Spring of 1881, and brought the team to St. Louis for a weekend exhibition. The Reds' first game was a 123 victory over the St. Louis club. The Reds have played each year since then, without going on hiatus (as the Cubs did, out of necessity) or relocating (like the Braves), making Cincinnati the oldest club to have played every year of its existence in one city. After the 1881 series proved a success, Caylor and a former president of the old Reds named Justus Thorner received an invitation from Philadelphia businessman Horace Phillips to attend a meeting of several clubs in Pittsburgh with the intent of establishing a rival to the National League. Upon arriving in the city, however, Caylor and Thorner discovered that no other owners had decided to accept the invitation, with even Phillips not bothering to attend his own meeting. By chance, the duo met a former pitcher named Al Pratt, who hooked them up with former Pittsburgh Alleghenys president H. Denny McKnight. Together, the three men hatched a scheme to form a new league by sending a telegram to each of the other owners who were supposed to attend the meeting stating that he was the only person who did not attend and that everyone else was enthusiastic about the new venture and eager to attend a second meeting in Cincinnati. The ploy worked, and the American Association was officially formed at the Hotel Gibson in Cincinnati with the new Reds a charter member with Thorner as president.</paragraph><paragraph>Led by the hitting of third baseman<space/><link><target>Hick Carpenter</target></link>, the defense of future<space/><link><target>Hall of Fame</target></link><space/>second baseman<space/><link><target>Bid McPhee</target></link>, and the pitching of 40-game-winner<space/><link><target>Will White</target></link>, the Reds won the inaugural AA pennant in 1882. With the establishment of the<space/><link><target>Union Association</target></link><space/>Justus Thorner left the club to finance the<space/><link><target>Cincinnati Outlaw Reds</target></link><space/>and managed to acquire the lease on the Reds Bank Street Grounds playing field, forcing new president Aaron Stern to relocate three blocks away at the hastily built League Park.

The National League was happy to accept the teams in part due to the emergence of the new Player's League. This new league, an early failed attempt to break the<space/><link><target>reserve clause</target></link><space/>in baseball, threatened both existing leagues. Because the National League decided to expand while the American Association was weakening, the team accepted an invitation to join the National League. It was also at this time that the team first shortened their name from &quot;Red Stockings&quot; to &quot;Reds&quot;. The Reds wandered through the 1890s signing local stars and aging veterans. During this time, the team never finished above third place (1897) and never closer than 10 games (1890).</paragraph><paragraph>At the start of the 20th century, the Reds had hitting stars<space/><link><target>Sam Crawford</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Cy Seymour</target></link>.

The Reds had been playing baseball on that same site, the corner of Findlay and Western Avenues on the city's west side, for 28 years, in wooden structures that had been occasionally damaged by fires.

They won 98 games in 1962, paced by Purkey's 23, but finished third. In 1964, they lost the pennant by one game to the Cardinals after having taken first place when the Phillies collapsed in September. Their beloved manager<space/><link><target>Fred Hutchinson</target></link><space/>died of cancer just weeks after the end of the 1964 season. The failure of the Reds to win the 1964 pennant led to owner<space/><link><target>Bill DeWitt</target></link>'s selling off key components of the team, in anticipation of relocating the franchise. In response to DeWitt's threatened move, the women of Cincinnati banded together to form the<space/><link><target>Rosie Reds</target></link><space/>to urge DeWitt to keep the franchise in Cincinnati. The Rosie Reds are still in existence, and are currently the oldest fan club in Major League Baseball. After the 1965 season he executed what may be the most lopsided trade in baseball history, sending former Most Valuable Player Frank Robinson to the Baltimore Orioles for pitchers<space/><link><target>Milt Pappas</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Jack Baldschun</target></link>, and outfielder<space/><link><target>Dick Simpson</target></link>. Robinson went on to win the MVP and triple crown in the American league for 1966, and lead Baltimore to its first ever World Series title in a sweep of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Reds did not recover from this trade until the rise of the &quot;Big Red Machine&quot; of the 1970s.</paragraph><paragraph>Starting in the early 1960s, the Reds' farm system began producing a series of stars, including<space/><link><target>Jim Maloney</target></link><space/>(the Reds' pitching ace of the 1960s),<space/><link><target>Pete Rose</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Tony Prez</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Johnny Bench</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Lee May</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Tommy Helms</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Bernie Carbo</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Hal McRae</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Dave Concepcin</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Gary Nolan (baseball)</target><part>Gary Nolan</part></link>. The tipping point came in 1967 with the appointment of<space/><link><target>Bob Howsam</target></link><space/>as general manager. That same year the Reds avoided a move to San Diego when the city of Cincinnati and Hamilton County agreed to build a state of the art, downtown stadium on the edge of the Ohio River. The Reds entered into a 30-year lease in exchange for the stadium commitment keeping the franchise in its original home city. In a series of strategic moves, Howsam brought in key personnel to complement the homegrown talent. The Reds' final game at Crosley Field, home to more than 4,500 baseball games, was played on June 24, 1970, a 54 victory over the<space/><link><target>1970 San Francisco Giants season</target><part>San Francisco Giants</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Under Howsam's administration starting in the late 1960s, the Reds instituted a strict rule barring the team's players from wearing facial hair and long hair.

Over the years, the rule was controversial, but persisted well into the ownership of<space/><link><target>Marge Schott</target></link>.

Much like when players leave the Yankees today, players who left the Reds took advantage with their new teams;<space/><link><target>Pete Rose</target></link>, for instance, grew his hair out much longer than would be allowed by the Reds once he signed with the<space/><link><target>Philadelphia Phillies</target></link><space/>in 1979.</paragraph><paragraph>The Reds' rules also included conservative uniforms. In Major League Baseball, a club generally provides most of the equipment and clothing needed for play. However, players are required to supply their gloves and shoes themselves. Many players enter into sponsorship arrangements with shoe manufacturers, but through the mid-1980s, the Reds had a strict rule that players were to wear only plain black shoes with no prominent logo. Reds players decried what they considered to be the boring color choice as well as the denial of the opportunity to earn more money through shoe contracts. A compromise was struck in which players were allowed to wear red shoes.</paragraph><heading level='3'>The Big Red Machine (19701976)</heading><paragraph><link><target>Image:Riverfront stadium.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Riverfront Stadium, (Cinergy Field)</part></link>In<space/><template><target>baseball year</target><arg>1970</arg></template>, little known<space/><link><target>Sparky Anderson</target><part>George &quot;Sparky&quot; Anderson</part></link><space/>was hired as manager, and the Reds embarked upon a decade of excellence, with a team that came to be known as &quot;<link><target>The Big Red Machine</target></link>&quot;.

While Vuckovich was a superb fielder, he was a weak hitter. In May, with the team off to a slow start and trailing the Dodgers, Sparky Anderson made a bold move by moving Rose to third base, a position where he had very little experience, and inserting Foster in left field. This was the jolt that the Reds needed to propel them into first place, with Rose proving to be reliable on defense, while adding Foster to the outfield gave the offense some added punch. During the season, the Reds compiled two notable streaks: (1) by winning 41 out of 50 games in one stretch, and (2) by going a month without committing any errors on defense.<link><target>Image:Pete rose at bat.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part><link><target>Pete Rose</target></link><space/>at bat in a game at Dodger Stadium during the 1970s</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>In the<space/><link><target>1975 Major League Baseball season</target><part>1975 season</part></link>,<space/><link><target>1975 Cincinnati Reds season</target><part>Cincinnati</part></link><space/>clinched the NL West with 108 victories, then swept the<space/><link><target>1975 Pittsburgh Pirates season</target><part>Pittsburgh Pirates</part></link><space/>in three games to win the NL pennant.

However, Bowie Kuhn, the Commissioner of Baseball, vetoed the trade for the stated reason of maintaining competitive balance in baseball. Some have suggested that the actual reason had more to due with Kuhn's continued feud with Oakland A's owner Charlie Finley. On June 15, 1977, the Reds acquired Mets' franchise pitcher<space/><link><target>Tom Seaver</target></link><space/>for Pat Zachry,<space/><link><target>Doug Flynn</target></link>, Steve Henderson, and Dan Norman.

Bench, after being able to catch only seven games in 1981, was moved from platooning at first base to be the starting third baseman;<space/><link><target>Alex Trevio</target></link><space/>became the regular starting catcher. The outfield was staffed with<space/><link><target>Paul Householder</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Csar Cedeo</target></link>, and future<space/><link><target>Colorado Rockies</target></link><space/>&amp;<space/><link><target>Pittsburgh Pirates</target></link><space/>manager<space/><link><target>Clint Hurdle</target></link><space/>on opening day. Hurdle was an immediate bust, and rookie<space/><link><target>Eddie Milner</target></link><space/>took his place in the starting outfield early in the year. The highly touted Householder struggled throughout the year despite extensive playing time. Cedeno, while providing steady veteran play, was a disappointment, and was unable to recapture his glory days with the Houston Astros. The starting rotation featured the emergence of a dominant Mario Soto, and featured strong years by Pastore and<space/><link><target>Bruce Berenyi</target></link>, but Seaver was injured all year, and their efforts were wasted without a strong offensive lineup. Tom Hume still led the bullpen, along with Joe Price. But the colorful<space/><link><target>Brad Lesley</target><part>Brad &quot;The Animal&quot; Lesley</part></link><space/>was unable to consistently excel, and former all-star<space/><link><target>Jim Kern</target></link><space/>was a big disappointment. Kern was also publicly upset over having to shave off his prominent beard to join the Reds, and helped force the issue of getting traded during mid-season by growing it back.</paragraph><paragraph>The Reds fell to the bottom of the Western Division for the next few years. After his injury-riddled 1982 season, Seaver was traded back to the Mets. The year 1983 found<space/><link><target>Dann Bilardello</target></link><space/>behind the plate, Bench returning to part-time duty at first base, rookies<space/><link><target>Nick Esasky</target></link><space/>taking over at third base and<space/><link><target>Gary Redus</target></link><space/>taking over from Cedeno. Tom Hume's effectiveness as a closer had diminished, and no other consistent relievers emerged. Dave Concepcin was the sole remaining starter from the Big Red Machine era.</paragraph><paragraph>Wagner's &quot;reign of terror&quot; ended in 1983, when Howsam, the architect of the Big Red Machine, was brought back. The popular Howsam began his second term as Reds' General Manager by signing Cincinnati native<space/><link><target>Dave Parker</target></link><space/>as a free agent from Pittsburgh. In<space/><template><target>baseball year</target><arg>1984</arg></template><space/>the Reds began to move up, depending on trades and some minor leaguers. In that season Dave Parker,<space/><link><target>Dave Concepcin</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Tony Prez</target></link><space/>were in Cincinnati uniforms. In August 1984,<space/><link><target>Pete Rose</target></link><space/>was reacquired and hired to be the Reds player-manager. After raising the franchise from the grave, Howsam gave way to the administration of<space/><link><target>Bill Bergesch</target></link>, who attempted to build the team around a core of highly regarded young players in addition to veterans like Parker. However, he was unable to capitalize on an excess of young and highly touted position players including<space/><link><target>Kurt Stillwell</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Tracy Jones</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Kal Daniels</target></link><space/>by trading them for pitching. Despite the emergence of Tom Browning as rookie of the year in 1985 when he won 20 games, the rotation was devastated by the early demise of Mario Soto's career to arm injury.</paragraph><paragraph>Under Bergesch, from<space/><template><target>baseball year</target><arg>1985</arg></template><link><target>1989 in baseball</target><part>89</part></link><space/>the Reds finished second four times.

</arg></template>Throughout the history of the Cincinnati Reds, many different variations of the classic wishbone &quot;C&quot; logo have been introduced. For most of the history of the Reds, especially during the early history, the Reds logo has been simply the wishbone &quot;C&quot; with the word &quot;REDS&quot; inside, the only colors used being red and white. However, during the 1950s, during the renaming and re-branding of the team as the Cincinnati Redlegs because of the connections to communism of the word 'Reds', the color blue was introduced as part of the Reds color combination.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="last">Yglesias<space/></arg><arg name="first">Matthew<space/></arg><arg name="url">http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/03/communist_bo_xilai_gets_ousted_why_do_communists_like_red_so_much_.html<space/></arg><arg name="title">Communist Bo Xilai gets ousted: Why do communists like red so much? - Slate Magazine<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Slate.com<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2012-06-19</arg></template></extension><space/>During the 1960s and 1970s the Reds saw a move towards the more traditional colors, abandoning the navy blue. A new logo also appeared with the new era of baseball in 1972, when the team went away from the script &quot;REDS&quot; inside of the &quot;C&quot;, instead, putting their mascot Mr. Redlegs in its place as well as putting the name of the team inside of the wishbone &quot;C&quot;. In the 1990s the more traditional, early logos of Reds came back with the current logo reflecting more of what the team's logo was when they were first founded.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Uniform</heading><paragraph><template><target>multiple image</target><arg name="align"><space/>right

</arg></template>Along with the logo, the Reds' uniforms have been changed many different times throughout their history. Following their departure from being called the &quot;Redlegs&quot; in 1956 the Reds made a groundbreaking change to their uniforms with the use of sleeveless jerseys, seen only once before in the Major Leagues by the Chicago Cubs. At home and away, the cap was all-red with a white wishbone C insignia. The long-sleeved undershirts were red. The uniform was plain white with a red wishbone C logo on the left and the uniform number on the right. On the road the wishbone C was replaced by the mustachioed &quot;Mr. Red&quot; logo, the pillbox-hat-wearing man with a baseball for a head. The home stockings were red with six white stripes. The away stockings had only three white stripes.</paragraph><paragraph>The Reds changed uniforms again in 1961, when they replaced the traditional wishbone C insignia with an oval C logo, but continued to use the sleeveless jerseys. At home, the Reds wore white caps with the red bill with the oval C in red, white sleeveless jerseys with red pinstripes, with the oval C-REDS logo in black with red lettering on the left breast and the number in red on the right. The gray away uniform included a gray cap with the red oval C and a red bill. Their gray away uniforms, which also included a sleeveless jersey, bore CINCINNATI in an arched block style across with the number below on the left. In 1964, players' last names were placed on the back of each set of uniforms, below the numbers. Those uniforms were scrapped after the 1966 season.</paragraph><paragraph>However, the Cincinnati uniform design most familiar to baseball enthusiasts is the one whose basic form, with minor variations, held sway for the 26 seasons from 1967 to 1992. Most significantly, the point was restored to the C insignia, making it a wishbone again. During this era, the Reds wore all-red caps both at home and on the road. The caps bore the simple wishbone C insignia in white. The uniforms were standard short-sleeved jerseys and standard trouserswhite at home and grey on the road. The home uniform featured the Wishbone C-REDS logo in red with white type on the left breast and the uniform number in red on the right. The away uniform bore CINCINNATI in an arched block style across the front with the uniform number below on the left. Red, long-sleeved undershirts and plain red stirrups over white sanitary stockings completed the basic design.</paragraph><paragraph>The 1993 uniforms (which did away with the pullovers and brought back button-down jerseys) kept white and gray as the base colors for the home and away uniforms, but added red pinstripes. The home jerseys were sleeveless, showing more of the red undershirts. The color scheme of the C-REDS logo on the home uniform was reversed, now red lettering on a white background. A new home cap was created that had a red bill and a white crown with red pinstripes and a red wishbone C insignia. The away uniform kept the all-red cap, but moved the uniform number to the left, to more closely match the home uniform. The only additional change to these uniforms was the introduction of black as a primary color of the Reds in 1999, especially on their road uniforms.</paragraph><paragraph>The Reds latest uniform change came in December 2006 which differed significantly from the uniforms worn during the previous eight seasons. The home caps returned to an all-red design with a white wishbone C, lightly outlined in black. Caps with red crowns and a black bill became the new road caps. Additionally, the sleeveless jersey was abandoned for a more traditional design. The numbers and lettering for the names on the backs of the jerseys were changed to an early-1900s style typeface, and a handlebar mustached &quot;Mr. Redlegs&quot; reminiscent of the logo used by the Reds in the 1950s and 1960s was placed on the left sleeve.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://cincinnati.reds.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd</arg><arg name="title">Reds unveil new-look uniforms &#124; Reds.com: News<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Cincinnati.reds.mlb.com<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2012-06-19</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Awards and accolades</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Cincinnati Reds award winners and league leaders</arg></template><template><target>See also</target><arg>Cincinnati Reds team records</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='3'>Team captains</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Jake Daubert</target></link><space/>1919-1924</listitem><listitem><link><target>Pete Rose</target></link><space/>1970-1978</listitem><listitem><link><target>Dave Concepcin</target></link><space/>1983-1988</listitem><listitem><link><target>Barry Larkin</target></link><space/>1997-2004</listitem></list><heading level='3'>Retired numbers</heading><paragraph><template><target>See also</target><arg>List of Major League Baseball retired numbers</arg></template>The Cincinnati Reds have retired nine numbers in franchise history, as well as honoring<space/><link><target>Jackie Robinson</target></link>, retired in all major league baseball.<space/></paragraph><paragraph>All of the retired numbers are located at Great American Ball Park behind home-plate on the outside of the press box.
