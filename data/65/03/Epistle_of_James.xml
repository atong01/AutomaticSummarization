It continued into the 60's and four years after the murder of James, war broke out with Rome - a war that would lead to the destruction of Jerusalem and the scattering of the people. The epistle of James is renowned for exhortations on fighting poverty and caring for the poor in practical ways (1:2627; 2:1-4; 2:14-19; 5:1-6), standing up for the oppressed (2:1-4; 5:1-6) and not being &quot;like the world&quot; in the way one responds to evil in the world (1:26-27; 2:11; 3:13-18; 4:1-10).

Paul also taught that saving faith is not dead but alive, showing thanks to God in deeds of love (Galatians 5:6 ['...since in Christ Jesus it is not being circumcised or being uncircumcised that can effect anything - only faith working through love.']). James was dealing with errorists who said that if they had faith they didn't need to show love by a life of faith (James 2:14-17). James countered this error by teaching that faith is alive, showing itself to be so by deeds of love (James 2:18,26).

It is well known that Luther deemed it impossible to harmonize the two apostles in this article, and characterized the Epistle of James as an "epistle of straw," because it had no evangelical character ("keine evangelische Art").</arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last">Stonehouse</arg><arg name="first">Ned B</arg><arg name="title">Paul Before the Areopagus</arg><arg name="year">1957</arg><arg name="pages">186–197</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Martin Luther's description of the Epistle of James changes.
