The '''Epistle of James''' ({{lang-grc|Ἰάκωβος|Iakōbos}}), the '''Book of James,''' or simply '''James''', is one of the twenty-two [[epistle]]s ([[didactic]] letters) in the [[New Testament]].

The author identifies himself as "James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ," who is writing to "the twelve tribes scattered abroad" ([[James 1#Verse 1|James 1:1]]). The epistle is traditionally attributed to [[James, brother of Jesus|James the Just]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Davids|first=Peter H|title=New International Greek Testament Commentary: The Epistle of James|year=1982|publisher=Eerdmans|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.|isbn=0802823882|edition=Repr.|editor=I Howard Marshall and W Ward Gasque}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Craig A|title=Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: John, Hebrews-Revelation|year=2005|publisher=Victor|location=Colorado Springs, Colo.|isbn=0781442281|editor=Craig A Evans}}</ref> and the audience is generally considered to be [[Jewish Christian]]s who were dispersed outside of Palestine due to persecution.<ref name="new advent" />

Framed within an overall theme of patient perseverance during trials and temptations, James writes to encourage believers to live consistently with what they have learned in Christ. He desires for his readers to mature in their faith in Christ by living what they say they believe. James condemns various [[sins]] including [[pride]], [[hypocrisy]], [[discrimination|favoritism]], and slander. James encourages believers to humbly live heavenly wisdom rather than worldly wisdom, and to pray in all situations.

== Composition ==
 
=== Authorship ===

There are four views concerning authorship and dating of the Epistle of James:
# that the letter was written by James before the [[Pauline Epistles]],
# that the letter was written by James after the Pauline Epistles,
# that the letter is [[pseudonym]]ous,
# that the letter comprises material originally from James but reworked by a later editor.<ref name="McCartney2009" />

The writer only refers to himself as "James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ."{{bibleref2c|Jas|1:1}} There are seven possible authors of James. As many as six different men may be referred to in the Bible as James,<ref>http://www.agapebiblestudy.com/charts/The%20James%20of%20the%20New%20Testament.htm</ref> and if none of these men wrote this letter, a seventh man not mentioned in the Bible by the name of James could be the author.

Jesus had two apostles named James: [[James, son of Zebedee|James, the son of Zebedee]] and [[James, son of Alphaeus|James, the son of Alphaeus]], but it is unlikely that either of these wrote the letter. James, the son of Zebedee, was martyred about 44 AD.<ref>See {{bibleref2|Acts|12:1–2}}</ref> This would be very early for him to have been the writer. The other apostle James, the son of Alphaeus, is not prominent in the Scriptural record, and very little is known about him.

[[File:John Everett Millais - Christ in the House of His Parents (`The Carpenter's Shop') - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|''[[Christ in the House of His Parents]]'' An illustration including James, the brother of Jesus.]]

Rather, evidence points to [[James, brother of Jesus|James the brother of Jesus]], to whom Jesus evidently had made a special appearance after his resurrection described in the New Testament. This James was prominent among the disciples.<ref>See {{bibleref2|Matthew|13:55}}; {{bibleref2|Acts|21:15–25}};{{bibleref2|1Cor|15:7|esv|1 Corinthians 15:7}}; and {{bibleref2|Galatians|1:19}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Galatians|2:9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Moo|first=Douglas J|title=The Letter of James|year=2000|publisher=Wm B Eerdmans Publishing co|location=Grand Rapids|isbn=0802837301|editor=D A Carson}}</ref> The writer of the letter of James identifies himself as "a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ", in much the same way as did Jude, who introduced the [[Epistle of Jude]] by calling himself "a slave of Jesus Christ, but a brother of James". (Jas 1:1; Jude 1) Furthermore, the salutation of James’ letter includes the term “Greetings!” in the same way as did the letter concerning [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision]] that was sent to the congregations. In this latter instance it was apparently Jesus’ brother James who spoke prominently in the assembly of "the apostles and the older men" at Jerusalem.<ref>Adam Clarke,1821, commentary on 5:13, 22, 23.</ref>

From the middle of the 3rd century, [[patristic]] authors cited the ''Epistle'' as written by James the Just, a [[Desposyni|relation of Jesus]] and first [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem#Bishops of Jerusalem|Bishop of Jerusalem]].<ref name="newadvent" /> Not numbered among the [[Twelve Apostles]], unless he is identified as [[James the Less]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Bechtel|first=Florentine|title=The Brethren of the Lord|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02767a.htm|work=Catholic Encyclopedia|accessdate=16 May 2012|quote=His identity with James the Less (Mark 15:40) and the Apostle James, the son of Alpheus (Matthew 10:3; Mark 3:18), although contested by many Protestant critics, may also be considered as certain.}}</ref> James was nonetheless a very important figure: Paul described him as "the brother of the Lord" in [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 1:19 and as one of the three "pillars of the Church" in 2:9. He is traditionally considered the first of the [[Seventy Disciples]].

[[John Calvin]] and others suggested that the author was the Apostle [[James, son of Alphaeus]], who is referred to as James the Less. The Protestant reformer [[Martin Luther]] denied it was  the work of an [[Twelve apostles|apostle]] and termed it an "epistle of straw"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/history/7_ch04.htm |title=History of the Christian Church, book 7, chapter 4}}</ref> as compared to some other books in the New Testament, not least because of the conflict he thought it raised with Paul on the doctrine of [[Justification (theology)|justification]] (see below).

===Dating===

Many scholars consider the epistle to be written in the late 1st or early 2nd centuries. Among the reasons for this are:<ref>{{cite web|title=Epistle of James|url=http://earlychristianwritings.com/james.html|work=Early Christian Writings|accessdate=16 May 2012}}</ref>
* the author introduces himself merely as "a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ", without invoking any special family relationship to Jesus.
* the cultured Greek language of the Epistle, it is contended, could not have been written by a Jerusalemite Jew. Some scholars argue for a primitive version of the letter composed by James and then later polished by another writer.<ref name="TheOxford2001">{{cite book|title=The Oxford Bible Commentary|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198755007|editor=John Barton and John Muddiman|page=1256}}</ref>
* the epistle was only gradually accepted into the [[Development of the New Testament canon|canon of the New Testament]].
* Some see parallels between James and [[1 Peter]], [[1 Clement]], and the [[Shepherd of Hermas]] and take this to reflect the socio-economic situation Christians were dealing with in the late 1st or early 2nd century. It thus could have been written anywhere in the Empire where Christians spoke Greek.  There are some scholars who argued for Syria.<ref name="TheOxford2001" />

If written by [[James the Just]], the time of the writing would be sometime before AD 70. [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]] would also be the place of origin.

The earliest extant [[manuscript]]s of James usually date to the mid-to-late third century.<ref name="McCartney2009">{{cite book|last=McCartney|first=Dan G|title=Baker Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament: James|year=2009|publisher=Baker Academic|location=Grand Rapids|isbn=0801026768|editor=Robert W Yarbrough and Robert H Stein}}</ref>

===Genre===

James is considered New Testament [[wisdom literature]] because, "like [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] and [[Sirach]], it consists largely of moral exhortations and precepts of a traditional and eclectic nature."<ref>{{cite book|last=Laws|first=Sophie|title=The HarperCollins Study Bible|year=1993|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|location=San Francisco|isbn=0060655267|pages=2052}}</ref>

===Structure===

Some view the epistle as having no overarching outline, "...James may have simply grouped together small "thematic essays" without having more linear, Greco-Roman structures in mind."<ref name="Blomberg 2008 23">{{cite book |last=Blomberg |first=Craig |date=2008 |title=James |url= |location=Grand Rapids |publisher=Zondervan |page=23 |isbn=9780310244028}}</ref> This view is generally supported by those who believe that the epistle may not be a true piece of correspondence between specific parties, but rather an example of [[wisdom literature]] formulated as a letter for circulation.  The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' says, "the subjects treated of in the Epistle are many and various; moreover, St. James not infrequently, whilst elucidating a certain point, passes abruptly to another, and presently resumes once more his former argument."<ref name="newadvent">{{cite web|last=Camerlynck|first=Achille|title=Epistle of St James|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08275b.htm|work=The Catholic Encyclopedia|accessdate=16 May 2012}}</ref>

Others view the letter as having only broad topical or thematic structure. These authors generally organize James under three (Ralph Martin<ref>{{cite book |last=Martin |first=Ralph |date=1988 |title=James |url= |location=Waco, TX |publisher=WBC |page=xcviii - civ}}</ref>) to seven (Luke Johnson<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Luke |date=2000 |title=The Letter of James |url= |location=Grand Rapids |publisher=Pillar |pages=11–16 |isbn=}}</ref>) general key themes or segments.

A third group of scholars believe that James was more purposeful in structuring his letter, linking each paragraph theologically and thematically.
{{Quote|James, like the gospel writers, can be seen as a purposeful theologian, carefully weaving his smaller units together into larger fabrics of thought and using his overall structure to prioritize his key themes. |author=Blomberg and Kamell<ref name="Blomberg 2008 23"/>}}
This third view of the structuring of James  is a historical approach that is supported by scholars who are not content with leaving the book as, "New Testament wisdom literature, like a small book of proverbs," or, "like a loose collection of random pearls dropped in no particular order onto a piece of string."<ref>as numerous writers and commentators assume, e.g. William Barclay, ''The Daily Study Bible'', rev. ed., 17 vols. (Philadelphia: The Westminster Press, 1976), Vol 14, The Letters of James and Peter, p. 28.</ref>

A fourth group uses modern [[discourse analysis]] or Greco-Roman rhetorical structures to describe the structure of James.<ref>{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Mark |date=2006 |title=A Linguistic Investigation into the Discource Structure of James |url= |location=London |publisher=T&T Clark |page= |isbn=9780310244028}}</ref>

== Historical context ==

Some scholars believe that the Epistle of James should be understood in its historical context. Understanding the circumstances of James' writing helps these scholars to better understand James' organization of this letter. This approach views James' Epistle as having a legitimate purpose for its composition––it is a response to the suffering of its recipients.

A 2013 journal article<ref>Jim Reiher, “Violent Language – a clue to the Historical Occasion of James.” ''Evangelical Quarterly''. Vol. LXXXV No. 3. July 2013</ref> explores a violent historical background behind the epistle and offers the suggestion that it was indeed written by James the brother of Jesus, and therefore written before AD 62, the year of James' murder.<ref>On the death of James see Josephus Antiquities, 20.9.1 and Eusebius II.23.1-18.</ref> The decade of the 50's saw the growth of turmoil and violence in Palestine as Jews became more and more frustrated with corruption, injustice and poverty. It continued into the 60's and four years after the murder of James, war broke out with Rome - a war that would lead to the destruction of Jerusalem and the scattering of the people. The epistle of James is renowned for exhortations on fighting poverty and caring for the poor in practical ways (1:26–27; 2:1-4; 2:14-19; 5:1-6), standing up for the oppressed (2:1-4; 5:1-6) and not being "like the world" in the way one responds to evil in the world (1:26-27; 2:11; 3:13-18; 4:1-10). Worldly wisdom is rejected and people are exhorted to embrace heavenly wisdom, which includes peacemaking and pursuing righteousness and justice (3:13-18).

This approach sees the epistle as a real letter <ref>Numerous studies argue convincingly for a letter- structure to James. See, for example, Euan Fry, "Commentaries on James, I and 2 Peter, and Jude," The Bible Translator, 41 (July 1990): 330, and F.O. Francis, "The Form and Function of the Opening and Closing Paragraphs of James and I John," ZNW 61 (1970):110-126.</ref> with a real immediate purpose: to encourage Christian Jews not to revert to violence in their response to injustice and poverty, but rather to stay focused on doing good, staying holy, and embracing the wisdom of heaven not the wisdom of the world.

== Doctrine ==

=== Justification ===

{{Main|justification (theology)|Justification by faith alone|Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification}}
The letter contains the following famous passage concerning [[salvation]] and [[justification (theology)|justification]]:
{{quote|<sup>14</sup>What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him?<sup>15</sup>If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, <sup>16</sup>and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? <sup>17</sup>So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.<br>
<br>
<sup>18</sup>But someone will say, “You have faith and I have works.” Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works. <sup>19</sup>You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder! <sup>20</sup>Do you want to be shown, you foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless? <sup>21</sup>Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar? <sup>22</sup>You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works; <sup>23</sup>and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness”—and he was called a friend of God. <sup>24</sup>You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone. <sup>25</sup>And in the same way was not also Rahab the prostitute justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?<sup>26</sup>For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead.<ref>{{bibleref2|James|2:14–26}}</ref>}}

This passage has been cited in Christian theological debates, especially regarding the doctrine of justification. [[Gaius Marius Victorinus]] (4th century) associated James's teaching on works with the heretical Symmachian sect, followers of [[Symmachus the Ebionite]], and openly questioned whether James's teachings were heretical. This passage has also been contrasted with the teachings of [[Paul the Apostle]] on justification; indeed, some scholars believe that this passage is a response to Paul.<ref>{{cite book |first=Scot |last=McKnight |title=The Letter of James |publisher=William B. Erdmans |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan |series=The New International Commentary on the New Testament |isbn=978-0-8028-2627-5 |year=2011 |pages=259–263}}</ref> One issue in the debate is the meaning of the Greek word δικαιόω (dikaiόο) ‘render righteous or such as he ought to be’,<ref>{{cite web|title=Dikaioo|url=http://www.studylight.org/lex/grk/view.cgi?number=1344|work=Greek Lexicon|accessdate=16 May 2012}}</ref> with some among the participants taking the view that James is responding to a misunderstanding of Paul.<ref name="Martin 2009">Martin, D. 2009. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRWj6j2Dswc New Testament History & Literature: 18. Arguing with Paul]. Yale University.</ref>

[[Roman Catholicism]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] argue that this passage disproves the doctrine of justification by faith alone (or ''[[sola fide]]''),<!--Replace with actual book citation--><ref>{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P66.HTM|chapter=The Theological Virtues: 1815|quote=The gift of faith remains in one who has not sinned against it. But 'faith apart from works is dead':[Jas 2:26] when it is deprived of hope and love, faith does not fully unite the believer to Christ and does not make him a living member of his Body.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Schaff|first=Philip|title=Creeds of Christendom|year=1877|publisher=Harper & Brothers|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds1.v.vii.html|chapter=The Synod of Jerusalem and the Confession of Dositheus, A.D. 1672: Article XIII|quote=Man is justified, not by faith alone, but also by works.}}</ref> whereas the early and many modern Protestants continue to believe that Catholic and Orthodox interpretations do not fully understand the meaning of the term "justification"<ref>{{cite book|last=Calvin|first=John|title=Commentaries on the Catholic Epistles|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom45.vi.iii.vii.html|chapter=James 2:20–26|quote=When, therefore, the Sophists set up James against Paul, they go astray through the ambiguous meaning of a term.}}</ref> and resolve James' and Paul's apparent conflict regarding faith and works in alternate ways from the Catholics and Orthodox:

{{quote|Paul was dealing with one kind of error while James was dealing with a different error. The errorists Paul was dealing with were people who said that works of the law were needed to be added to faith in order to help earn God's favor. Paul countered this error by pointing out that salvation was by faith alone apart from deeds of the law (Galatians 2:16; Romans 3:21-22). Paul also taught that saving faith is not dead but alive, showing thanks to God in deeds of love (Galatians 5:6 ['...since in Christ Jesus it is not being circumcised or being uncircumcised that can effect anything - only faith working through love.']). James was dealing with errorists who said that if they had faith they didn't need to show love by a life of faith (James 2:14-17). James countered this error by teaching that faith is alive, showing itself to be so by deeds of love (James 2:18,26). James and Paul both teach that salvation is by faith alone and also that faith is never alone but shows itself to be alive by deeds of love that express a believer's thanks to God for the free gift of salvation by faith in Jesus.<ref name=WELS>{{cite web |url=http://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&cuTopic_topicID=19&cuItem_itemID=6343 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220114120/http://arkiv.lbk.cc/faq/site.pl@1518cutopic_topicid19cuitem_itemid6343.htm |archivedate=20 Dec 2013 |work=WELS Topical Q&A |title= Faith and Works |publisher=[[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] |accessdate=30 Sep 2015 }}</ref>}}

=== Anointing of the Sick ===

{{Main|Anointing of the Sick}}
James's epistle is also the chief Biblical text for the [[Anointing of the Sick]]. James wrote:
{{quote|<sup>14</sup>Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. <sup>15</sup>And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.<ref>{{bibleref2|James|5:14–15}}</ref>}}

[[G. A. Wells]] suggested this passage was evidence of late authorship of the epistle, on the grounds that the healing of the sick being done through an official body of [[presbyter]]s ([[elder (Christianity)|elders]]) indicated a considerable development of ecclesiastical organisation, "whereas in Paul's day to heal and work miracles pertained to believers indiscriminately (I Corinthians, XII:9)."<ref name="Wells1971">{{cite book|last=Wells|first=George Albert|title=The Jesus of Early Christians|year=1971|publisher=Pemberton|location=London|isbn=0301710147|page=152}}</ref>

Ancient people often used oils, such as [[olive oil#History and trade|olive oil]], as a medication in hopes of relieving various sicknesses. Some scholars consider this passage to indicate that James was encouraging believers to treat the sick with the best (or more common) medical technology of the day along with prayer and faith.

== Canonicity ==

{{see also|Antilegomena|Biblical canon}}
The Epistle was first explicitly referred to and quoted by [[Origen of Alexandria]], and possibly a bit earlier by [[Irenaeus of Lyons]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Glenn|title=Irenaeus of Lyons|url=http://www.ntcanon.org/Irenaeus.shtml|work=The Development of the Canon of the New Testament|accessdate=16 May 2012|year=2010}}</ref> as well as [[Clement of Alexandria]] in a lost work according to [[Eusebius]], although it was not mentioned by [[Tertullian]], who was writing at the end of the Second Century.<ref name="Wells1971" /> It is also absent from the [[Muratorian fragment]], the earliest known list of New Testament books.

The Epistle of James was included among the twenty-seven New Testament books first listed by [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] in his ''Thirty-Ninth Festal Epistle'' (AD 367)<ref>{{cite book|last=Griggs|first=C Wilfred|title=Early Egyptian Christianity|year=1991|publisher=Brill Academic Publisher|location=Leiden|isbn=9004094075|edition=2nd|page=173}}</ref> and was confirmed as a canonical epistle of the New Testament by a series of councils in the Fourth Century. Today, virtually all denominations of Christianity consider this book to be a canonical epistle of the New Testament.

In the first centuries of the Church the authenticity of the Epistle was doubted by some, including [[Theodore of Mopsuestia|Theodore]], Bishop of Mopsuestia in Cilicia. Because of the silence of several of the western churches regarding it, [[Eusebius]] classes it among the [[Antilegomena]] or contested writings (''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia ecclesiae]]'', 3.25; 2.23). St. [[Jerome]] gives a similar appraisal but adds that with time it had been universally admitted.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} [[Gaius Marius Victorinus]], in his commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians, openly questioned whether the teachings of James were heretical.

Its late recognition in the Church, especially in the West, may be explained by the fact that it was written for or by [[Jewish Christians]], and therefore not widely circulated among the [[Pauline Christianity|Gentile Churches]]. There is some indication that a few groups distrusted the book because of its doctrine. In [[Reformation]] times a few theologians, most notably [[Martin Luther]] in his early career,<ref name="TLSB">[[The Lutheran Study Bible]], [[Concordia Publishing House]], 2009, p2132</ref> argued that this epistle should not be part of the canonical New Testament.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schaff|first=Philip|title=History of the Reformation|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/hcc7.ii.iv.iv.html|quote=The most important example of dogmatic influence in Luther’s version is the famous interpolation of the word alone in Rom. 3:28 (allein durch den Glauben), by which he intended to emphasize his solifidian doctrine of justification, on the plea that the German idiom required the insertion for the sake of clearness.464  But he thereby brought Paul into direct verbal conflict with James, who says (James 2:24), "by works a man is justified, and not only by faith" ("nicht durch den Glauben allein"). It is well known that Luther deemed it impossible to harmonize the two apostles in this article, and characterized the Epistle of James as an "epistle of straw," because it had no evangelical character ("keine evangelische Art").}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Stonehouse|first=Ned B|title=Paul Before the Areopagus|year=1957|pages=186–197}}</ref>

Martin Luther's description of the Epistle of James changes. In some cases, Luther argues that it was not written by an apostle; but in other cases, he describes James as the work of an apostle.<ref>''[[Luther Bible|Die deutsche Bibel]]'' 41:578-90</ref> He even cites it as authoritative teaching from God<ref>''[[Luther's Large Catechism]]'', [http://bookofconcord.org/lc-5-ourfather.php#para123 IV 122-24]</ref> and describes James as "a good book, because it sets up no doctrines of men but ''vigorously promulgates the law of God''."<ref>''Luther's Works'' (American Edition) 35:395</ref> Lutherans hold that the Epistle is rightly part of the New Testament, citing its authority in the [[Book of Concord]],<ref name="TLSB"/> however it remains part of the Lutheran [[antilegomena]].<ref>[http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/display.asp?t1=a&word=ANTILEGOMENA Lutheran Cyclopedia: Antilegomena]</ref>
