One legacy of the previous era is strong metal industry; under former republic premier<space/><link><target>Demal Bijedi</target></link>, and Yugoslav president<space/><link><target>Josip Broz Tito</target><part>Tito</part></link>, metal-product industries were promoted in the republic, resulting in the development of a large share of Yugoslavia's metal products plants. Although agriculture is almost all in private hands, the republic traditionally is an exporter of food. Industry was very strong, a holdover from the Mixed economic structure of Yugoslavia. Yugoslav President Josip Broz Tito had pushed the development of metal industries, and electro-energetic sector, in the republic with the result that Bosnia and Herzegovina were a host of large numbers of industrial firms. Some of them were worked with World brand names, companies like Coca Cola, Pepsi, Marlboro, Volkswagen, SKF. Big Companies like Energoinvest, UNIS, Hidrogradnja, Vranica, RMK Zenica, TAS Sarajevo, FAMOS Sarajevo, BNT Novi Travnik, have yearly income in billions of USD$ in that time. Building sector companies bringing large amounts of income in USD$. Unemployment in that time is very low. Work force is highly skilled, with highly professional, educated managers, ingeniurs, science experts, which use western world's newest technologies in large scale areas. Before the war, yugoslav premier Ante Markovi, made some preparations for privatization, in economy, finance, and industry sectors, but war ceased development in these actions.</paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>war in Bosnia and Herzegovina</target></link><space/>caused production to plummet by 80% from 1992 to 1995 and unemployment to soar. With an uneasy peace in place, output recovered in 199699 at high percentage rates from a low base; but output growth slowed in 200002. Part of the lag in output was made up in 200305. National-level statistics are limited and do not capture the large share of black market activity.</paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>konvertibilna marka</target></link><space/>(convertible mark or BAM) - the national currency introduced in 1998 - is pegged to the euro, and confidence in the currency and the banking sector has increased. Implementation of privatization, however, has been slow, and local entities only reluctantly support national-level institutions. Banking reform accelerated in 2001 as all ; foreign banks, primarily from Western Europe, now control most of the banking sector. A sizable current account deficit and very high unemployment rate remain the two most serious economic problems. The country receives substantial amounts of reconstruction assistance and humanitarian aid from the international community but will have to prepare for an era of declining assistance.</paragraph><paragraph>The United States Embassy in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina produces the Country Commercial Guide an annual report that delivers a comprehensive look at Bosnia and Herzegovina's commercial and economic environment, using economic, political, and market analysis. It can be viewed on<space/><link type='external' href='http://sarajevo.usembassy.gov/country-commercial-guide.html'>Embassy Sarajevo's website</link>.</paragraph><paragraph>As of October 2012, the IMF has approved a two-year stand-by arrangement of 405.3 million euro for Bosnia. The IMF loan, approved on September 26, is designed to support Bosnia's economic programme for the next two years, ease the effects of the &quot;external environment and address domestic structural weaknesses&quot;. Bosnia's two autonomous entities will be using the cash from the loan but will not get the whole amount at once. The IMF has enabled an initial disbursement of 60.8 million euro, saying that the rest of the money will be spread out over two years, after successful quarterly reviews.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/imf-approves-bosnia-some-e4%C3%A55-million</arg><arg name="title">IMF Approves €405 Million Standby for Bosnia</arg><arg name="publisher"></arg><arg name="accessdate">3 March 2015</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Macro-Economic</heading><list type='ident'><listitem><table class="wikitable"><tablerow><tablehead colspan="11" style="background: #efefef; border-bottom: 2px solid gray;">GDP</tablehead></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell><bold>Year</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>GDP real growth rate</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>GDP (PPP) per capita</bold></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell><bold>1997</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>29.9%</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>2,817</bold></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell><bold>1998</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>28.9%</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>3,782</bold></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell><bold>1999</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>9.5%</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>4,121</bold></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell><bold>2000</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>5.2%</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>4,364</bold></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell><bold>2001</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>3.6%</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>4,603</bold></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell><bold>2002</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>5.0%</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>4,871</bold></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell><bold>2003</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>3.5%</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>5,110</bold></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell><bold>2004</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>6.3%</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>5,497</bold></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell><bold>2005</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>4.3%</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>5,942</bold></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell><bold>2006</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>6.2%</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>6,466</bold></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell><bold>2007</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>6.5%</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>7,031</bold></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell><bold>2008</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>5.4%</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>7,550</bold></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell><bold>2009</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>-3.4%</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>7,361</bold></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell><bold>2010</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>0.5%</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>7,428</bold></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell><bold>2011</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>0.92%</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>8,063</bold></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell><bold>2012</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>-0.70%</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>8,100</bold></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell><bold>2013 (Official res)</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>6.5%</bold></tablecell><tablecell><bold>8,300</bold></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell colspan="10">Source: IMF World economic outlook, October 2013</tablecell></tablerow></table>Preliminary estimates show however that 2013 will be the strongest year of GDP growth since 2008 with a growth of 6.5%.
