The '''body mass index''' ('''BMI''') or '''Quetelet index''' is a value derived from the [[mass]] ([[Mass versus weight|weight]]) and height of an individual. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is universally expressed in [[Units of measurement|units]] of kg/m<sup>2</sup>, resulting from mass  in [[kilogram]]s and height in [[metre]]s. The BMI may also be determined using a table<ref group=note>e.g. the [http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/bmi_tbl.htm Body Mass Index Table] from the [[National Institutes of Health]]'s [[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute|NHLBI]].</ref> or chart which displays BMI as a function of mass and height using contour lines or colors for different BMI categories, and may use two different units of measurement.<ref group=note>For example, in the UK where people often know their weight in [[Stone (unit)|stone]] and height in feet and inches, – see [http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42028000/gif/_42028890_bmi_gra_416x314.gif]</ref>

The BMI is an attempt to quantify the amount of tissue mass (muscle, fat, and bone) in an individual, and then categorize that person as ''underweight'', ''normal weight'', ''overweight'', or ''obese'' based on that value. However, there is some debate about where on the BMI scale the dividing lines between categories should be placed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/why-being-overweight-means-you-live-longer-the-way-scientists-twist-the-facts-10158229.html |title=Why being 'overweight' means you live longer: The way scientists twist the facts  |author=Dr Malcolm Kendrick |publisher=[[The Independent (Newspaper)|http://www.independent.co.uk]] |date=April 12, 2015 |accessdate=12 April 2015}}</ref>  Commonly accepted BMI ranges are underweight: under 18.5, normal weight: 18.5 to 25, overweight: 25 to 30, obese: over 30.

==Usage==
The index was devised by [[Adolphe Quetelet]] from 1830 to 1850 during which time he developed what he called "social physics".<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/ndt/gfm517 |title=Adolphe Quetelet (1796–1874)—the average man and indices of obesity |year=2007 |last1=Eknoyan |first1=Garabed |journal=Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation |volume=23 |issue=1 |pmid=17890752 |pages=47–51}}</ref> The modern term "body mass index" (BMI) for the ratio of [[human body weight]] to squared height owes its popularity to a paper published in the July 1972 edition of the ''Journal of Chronic Diseases'' by [[Ancel Keys]]. This found the BMI to be the best proxy for [[body fat percentage]] among ratios of human body weight and height.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2223095/ |title=Beyond BMI: Why doctors won't stop using an outdated measure for obesity |author=Jeremy Singer-Vine |publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate.com]] |date=July 20, 2009 |accessdate=15 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0021-9681(72)90027-6 |title=Indices of relative weight and obesity |year=1972 |last1=Keys |first1=Ancel |last2=Fidanza |first2=Flaminio |last3=Karvonen |first3=Martti J. |last4=Kimura |first4=Noboru |last5=Taylor |first5=Henry L. |journal=Journal of Chronic Diseases |volume=25 |issue=6–7 |pmid=4650929 |pages=329–43}}</ref>

The interest in an index that measures [[body fat]] came with increasing obesity in prosperous Western societies. BMI was explicitly cited by Keys as appropriate for ''population'' studies and inappropriate for individual evaluation. Nevertheless, due to its simplicity, it has come to be widely used for preliminary diagnosis.<ref name=nhlbi>{{cite web|title=Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/risk.htm |publisher=National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute|accessdate=19 December 2014}}</ref> Additional metrics, such as waist circumference, can be more useful.<ref name=nhsob>{{cite web|title=Defining obesity|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Obesity/Pages/Introduction.aspx  |publisher=[[National Health Service|NHS]]|accessdate=19 December 2014}}</ref>

If pounds and inches are used, a conversion factor of 703&nbsp;(kg/m<sup>2</sup>)/(lb/in<sup>2</sup>) must be applied. When the term BMI is used informally, the units are usually omitted.

:<math>\mathrm{BMI} = \frac{\text{mass}_\text{kg}}{\text{height}_\text{m}^2}
= \frac{\text{mass}_\text{lb}}{\text{height}_\text{in}^2}\times 703</math>

BMI ranges from underweight to obese and is commonly employed among children and adults to predict health outcomes. The BMI trait is influenced by both genetic and non-genetic factors, and it provides a paradigm to understand and estimate the [[risk factors]] for health problems.<ref>Fareed M, Afzal M. (2014) Evidence of inbreeding depression on height, weight, and body mass index: A population-based child cohort study. Am J Hum Biol. 26:784–795. {{doi|10.1002/ajhb.22599}} PMID 25130378</ref>

BMI provides a simple numeric measure of a person's ''thickness'' or ''thinness'', allowing health professionals to discuss weight problems more objectively with their patients. BMI was designed to be used as a simple means of classifying average sedentary (physically inactive)  populations, with an average body composition.<ref>{{cite journal|journal = WHO Technical Report Series| volume = 854 | title = Physical Status: The Use and Interpretation of Anthropometry |page = 9 |url = http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_854.pdf |location=Geneva, Switzerland |year=1995 |publisher=World Health Organization |pmid=8594834}}</ref> For these individuals, the current value recommendations are as follow: a BMI from 18.5 up to 25 may indicate optimal weight, a BMI lower than 18.5 suggests the person is [[underweight]], a number from 25 up to 30 may indicate the person is [[overweight]], and a number from 30 upwards suggests the person is [[obesity|obese]].<ref name=nhlbi /><ref name=nhsob /> Many (e.g. gymnasts, basketball and soccer players) but not all (e.g. football linemen) athletes have a high muscle to fat ratio and may have a BMI that is misleadingly high relative to their body fat percentage.<ref name=nhsob />

==Scalability==
BMI is proportional to mass and inversely proportional to the square of the height. So, if all body dimensions double, and mass scales naturally with the cube of the height, then BMI doubles instead of remaining the same. This results in taller people having a reported BMI that is uncharacteristically high, compared to their actual body fat levels. In comparison, the [[Ponderal index]] is based on the natural scaling of mass with the third power of the height.

However, many taller people are not just "scaled up" short people but tend to have narrower frames in proportion to their height. Nick Korevaar (a mathematics lecturer from the [[University of Utah]]) suggests that instead of squaring the body height (as the BMI does) or cubing the body height (as the Ponderal index does), it would be more appropriate to use an [[Exponentiation|exponent]] of between 2.3 and 2.7<ref name="Nick K.">{{cite web |first=Nick |last=Korevaar |date=July 2003 |url=http://www.math.utah.edu/~korevaar/ACCESS2003/bmi.pdf |title=Notes on Body Mass Index and actual national data}}{{self-published inline|date=July 2012}}{{MEDRS|date=July 2012}}</ref> (as originally noted by Quetelet).  (For a theoretical basis for such values see MacKay.<ref>{{cite journal |arxiv=0910.5834 |doi=10.1016/j.jbiomech.2009.10.038 |title=Scaling of human body mass with height: The body mass index revisited |year=2010 |last1=MacKay |first1=N.J. |journal=Journal of Biomechanics |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=764–6 |pmid=19909957 |bibcode=2009arXiv0910.5834M}}</ref>)

==BMI Prime==
'''BMI Prime''', a simple modification of the BMI system, is the ratio of actual BMI to upper limit BMI (currently defined at BMI 25). As defined, BMI Prime is also the ratio of body weight to upper body-weight limit, calculated at BMI 25. Since it is the ratio of two separate BMI values, BMI Prime is a [[dimensionless number]] without associated units. Individuals with BMI Prime less than 0.74 are underweight; those with between 0.74 and 1.00 have optimal weight; and those at 1.00 or greater are overweight. BMI Prime is useful clinically because individuals can tell, at a glance, by what percentage they deviate from their upper weight limits.

For instance, a person with BMI 34 has a BMI Prime of 34/25 = 1.36, and is 36% over his or her upper mass limit. In South East Asian and South Chinese populations (see international variation section below), BMI Prime should be calculated using an upper limit BMI of 23 in the denominator instead of 25. Nonetheless, BMI Prime allows easy comparison between populations whose upper-limit BMI values differ.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16768059 |year=2006 |last1=Gadzik |first1=James |title='How much should I weigh?' Quetelet's equation, upper weight limits, and BMI prime |volume=70 |issue=2 |pages=81–8 |journal=Connecticut Medicine}}</ref>

==Categories==
A frequent use of the BMI is to assess how much an individual's body weight departs from what is normal or desirable for a person's height. The weight excess or deficiency may, in part, be accounted for by body fat ([[adipose tissue]]) although other factors such as muscularity also affect BMI significantly (see discussion below and [[overweight]]).

The [[World Health Organization|WHO]] regards a BMI of less than 18.5 as underweight and may indicate [[malnutrition]], an [[eating disorder]], or other health problems, while a BMI equal to or greater than 25 is considered overweight and above 30 is considered [[obesity|obese]].<ref name="BMI Classification" /> These ranges of BMI values are valid only as statistical categories.

===BMI in children (aged 2 to 20)===
[[File:BMIBoys 1.svg|thumb|BMI for age percentiles for boys 2 to 20 years of age.]]
[[File:BMIGirls 1.svg|thumb|BMI for age percentiles for girls 2 to 20 years of age.]]
BMI is used differently for [[child]]ren. It is calculated in the same way as for adults, but then compared to typical values for other children of the same age. Instead of comparison against fixed thresholds for underweight and overweight, the BMI is compared against the [[percentile]] for children of the same gender and age.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/childrens_BMI/about_childrens_BMI.htm|title = Body Mass Index: BMI for Children and Teens|publisher = Center for Disease Control|accessdate = 2013-12-16}}</ref>

A BMI that is less than the 5th percentile is considered underweight and above the 95th percentile is considered obese. Children with a BMI between the 85th and 95th percentile are considered to be overweight.

Recent studies in Britain have indicated that females between the ages 12 and 16 have a higher BMI than males of the same age by 1.0&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup> on average.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.archive2.official-documents.co.uk/document/deps/doh/survey02/summ03.htm|title = Health Survey for England: The Health of Children and Young People|website=Archive2.official-documents.co.uk|accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref>

====Singapore====
In Singapore, the BMI cut-off figures were revised in 2005, motivated by studies showing that many Asian populations, including Singaporeans, have higher proportion of body fat and increased risk for cardiovascular diseases and [[diabetes mellitus]], compared with Caucasians at the same BMI. The BMI cut-offs are presented with an emphasis on health risk rather than weight.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://cholesterol-calculator.com/bmi-facts-tips.php#|title = Revision of Body Mass Index (BMI) Cut-Offs in Singapore}}</ref>

====United States====
In 1998, the U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] brought U.S. definitions in line with [[World Health Organization]] guidelines, lowering the normal/overweight cut-off from BMI 27.8 to BMI 25. This had the effect of redefining approximately 29 million Americans, previously ''healthy'' to ''overweight''.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/9806/17/weight.guidelines/|title = Who's fat? New definition adopted | publisher=CNN | date=June 17, 1998 |accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref>

This can partially explain the increase in the ''overweight'' diagnosis in the past 20 years, and the increase in sales of the weight loss products during the same time. [[World Health Organization|WHO]] also recommends lowering the normal/overweight threshold for South East Asian body types to around BMI 23, and expects further revisions to emerge from clinical studies of different body types.

The U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of 1994 showed that 59% of American men and 49% of women had BMIs over 25. Morbid obesity—a BMI of 40 or more—was found in 2% of the men and 4% of the women. A survey in 2007 showed 63% of Americans are overweight or obese, with 26% now in the obese category (a BMI of 30 or more). There are differing opinions on definition of underweight in females; doctors quote anything below 18.5 to 20 as underweight, the most frequently stated is 19. A BMI nearing 15 is usually defined as starvation and  a BMI less than 17.5 as an informal criterion for the diagnosis of [[anorexia nervosa]].

==Applications==

===Public health===
The BMI is generally used as a means of correlation between groups related by general mass and can serve as a vague means of estimating [[adipose tissue|adiposity]]. The duality of the BMI is that, while it is easy to use as a general calculation, it is limited as to how accurate and pertinent the data obtained from it can be. Generally, the index is suitable for recognizing trends within sedentary or overweight individuals because there is a smaller margin of error.<ref name="jxbvhf">{{cite book |last1=Jeukendrup |first1=A. |authorlink1=Asker Jeukendrup |last2=Gleeson |first2=M. |year=2005 |title=Sports Nutrition |publisher=Human Kinetics: An Introduction to Energy Production and Performance |isbn=978-0-7360-3404-3}}{{page needed|date=April 2012}}</ref> The BMI has been used by the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] as the standard for recording obesity statistics since the early 1980s.

This general correlation is particularly useful for consensus data regarding obesity or various other conditions because it can be used to build a semi-accurate representation from which a solution can be stipulated, or the [[Recommended Dietary Allowance|RDA]] for a group can be calculated. Similarly, this is becoming more and more pertinent to the growth of children, due to the fact that the majority of children are sedentary.<ref>{{cite book |last=Barasi |first=M. E. |year=2004 |title=Human Nutrition – a health perspective |isbn=0-340-81025-4}}{{page needed|date=April 2012}}</ref>

===Clinical practice===
BMI categories are generally regarded as a satisfactory tool for measuring whether sedentary individuals are ''underweight'', ''overweight'' or ''obese'' with various exceptions, such as: athletes, children, the elderly, and the infirm.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Also, the growth of a child is documented against a BMI-measured growth chart. Obesity trends can then be calculated from the difference between the child's BMI and the BMI on the chart.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} In the United States, BMI is also used as a measure of underweight, owing to advocacy on behalf of those with eating disorders, such as [[anorexia nervosa]] and [[bulimia nervosa]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

===Legislation===
In France, Israel, Italy and Spain, legislation has been introduced banning usage of fashion show models having a BMI below 18.<ref>[http://time.com/3770696/france-banned-ultra-thin-models/ http://time.com/3770696/france-banned-ultra-thin-models/]</ref> In Israel, a BMI below 18.5 is banned.<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/International/israeli-law-bans-skinny-bmi-challenged-models/story?id=18116291 Israeli Law Bans Skinny, BMI-Challenged Models]</ref> This is done in order to fight [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexia]] among models and people interested in fashion.

===Scaling===
The exponent in the denominator of the formula for BMI is arbitrary. The BMI depends upon weight and the ''square'' of height. Since mass increases to the ''3rd power'' of linear dimensions, taller individuals with exactly the same body shape and relative composition, have a larger BMI.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Taylor, R. S. |year=2010 |title=Use of Body Mass Index For Monitoring Growth and Obesity |journal=Paediatrics & Child Health |volume=15 |issue=5 |page=258 |pmid=21532785 |pmc=2912631}}</ref>

An analysis based on data gathered in the US suggested an exponent of 2.6 would yield the best fit for children aged 2 to 19 years old.<ref name="Nick K." /> For US adults, exponent estimates range from 1.92 to 1.96 for males and from 1.45 to 1.95 for females.<ref>{{cite journal| title= Weight-height relationships and body mass index: some observations from the Diverse Populations Collaboration|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|year=2005|pmid=15761809|doi=10.1002/ajpa.20107|volume=128|issue=1|pages=220–9|author1=Diverse Populations Collaborative Group}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Physiological models of body composition and human obesity|first1= DG |last1= Levitt |last2= Heymsfield |last3= Pierson |last4= Shapses |last5= Kral |journal= Nutrition & Metabolism (London)| year= 2007| pmid= 17883858| pmc= 2082278| first2= SB| first3= RN| first4= SA| first5= JG| volume= 4| page=19|doi=10.1186/1743-7075-4-19}}</ref>

===Ignores variation in physical characteristics===
The BMI adds roughly 10% for a large (or tall) frame and subtracts roughly 10% for a smaller frame (short stature). In other words, a person with a small frame would be carrying more fat than optimal, but their BMI reflects that they are ''normal''. Conversely, a large framed (or tall) individual may be quite healthy with a fairly low body fat percentage, but be classified as ''overweight'' by BMI.<ref>http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/265215.php</ref>

The mathematician Prof [[Lloyd N. Trefethen|Nick Trefethen]], who observed this said, “BMI divides the weight by too large a number for short people and too small a number for tall people. So short people are misled into thinking that they are thinner than they are, and tall people are misled into thinking they are fatter.”<ref>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/9815052/Short-people-fatter-than-they-think-under-new-BMI.html</ref>

For example, a chart may say the ideal weight for a man 5&nbsp;ft 10 in (178&nbsp;cm) is 165 pounds (75&nbsp;kg). But if that man has a slender build (small frame), he may be overweight at 165 pounds (75&nbsp;kg) and should reduce by 10%, to roughly 150 pounds (68&nbsp;kg). In the reverse, the man with a larger frame and more solid build can be quite healthy at {{convert|180|lb|kg}}. If one teeters on the edge of small/medium or medium/large, a dose of common sense should be used in calculating their ideal weight. However, falling into your ideal weight range for height and build is still not as accurate in determining health risk factors as waist/height ratio and actual body fat percentage.<ref>http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/255712.php</ref>

Accurate frame size calculators use several measurements (wrist circumference, elbow width, neck circumference and others) to determine what category an individual falls into for a given height.<ref>http://www.livescience.com/39097-bmi-not-accurate-health-measure.html</ref> The BMI also fails to take into account loss of height through aging. In this situation, BMI will increase without any corresponding increase in weight.

===Does not differentiate between muscle mass and fat mass===
Assumptions about the distribution between muscle mass and fat mass are inexact. BMI generally overestimates [[adipose tissue|adiposity]] on those with more lean body mass (e.g., athletes) and underestimates excess adiposity on those with less lean body mass. A study in June 2008 by Romero-Corral et al. examined 13,601 subjects from the United States' third [[National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey]] (NHANES III) and found that BMI-defined obesity (BMI > 30) was present in 21% of men and 31% of women.

Using [[body fat percentage]]s (BF%), however, BF%-defined obesity was found in 50% of men and 62% of women. While BMI-defined obesity showed high [[Sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] (95% for men and 99% for women), BMI showed poor [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] (36% for men and 49% for women). Despite this undercounting of obesity by BMI, BMI values in the intermediate BMI range of 20–30 were found to be associated with a wide range of body fat percentages. For men with a BMI of 25, about 20% have a body fat percentage below 20% and about 10% have body fat percentage above 30%.<ref name="RomeroCorral2008"/>

BMI is particularly inaccurate for people who are very fit or athletic, as their high muscle mass can classify them in the ''overweight'' category by BMI, even though their body fat percentages frequently fall in the 10–15% category, which is below that of a more sedentary person of average build who has a ''normal'' BMI number. Body composition for athletes is often better calculated using measures of body fat, as determined by such techniques as skinfold measurements or underwater weighing and the limitations of manual measurement have also led to new, alternative methods to measure obesity, such as the [[body volume index]].

===Variation in definitions of categories===
It is not clear where on the BMI scale the threshold for ''[[overweight]]'' and ''[[obesity|obese]]'' should be set. Because of this the standards have varied over the past few decades. Between 1980 and 2000 the U.S. Dietary Guidelines have defined overweight at a variety of levels ranging from a BMI of 24.9 to 27.1. In 1985 the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) consensus conference recommended that overweight BMI be set at a BMI of 27.8 for men and 27.3 for women.

In 1998 a NIH report concluded that a BMI over 25 is overweight and a BMI over 30 is obese.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/HEALTH/9806/17/weight.guidelines/ |title=Who's fat? New definition adopted |date=June 17, 1998 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref> In the 1990s the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) decided that a BMI of 25 to 30 should be considered overweight and a BMI over 30 is obese, the standards the NIH set. This became the definitive guide for determining if someone is overweight.

The current WHO and NIH ranges of ''normal'' weights are proved to be associated with decreased risks of some diseases such as diabetes type II; however using the same range of BMI for men and women is considered arbitrary, and makes the definition of underweight quite unsuitable for men.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.halls.md/ideal-weight/medical.htm}}</ref>

===Variation in relationship to health===
A study published by ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' (''JAMA'') in 2005 showed that ''overweight'' people had a death rate similar to ''normal'' weight people as defined by BMI, while ''underweight'' and ''obese'' people had a higher death rate.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.293.15.1861 |title=Excess Deaths Associated with Underweight, Overweight, and Obesity |year=2005 |last1=Flegal |first1=K.

High BMI is associated with [[diabetes mellitus type 2|type&nbsp;2 diabetes]] only in persons with high serum [[gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase]].<ref>name="pmid21976023">{{cite journal | author=Lim JS, Lee DH, Park JY, Jin SH, Jacobs DR Jr | title=A strong interaction between serum gamma-glutamyltransferase and obesity on the risk of prevalent type 2 diabetes: results from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey | journal=Clinical Chemistry  | volume=53 | issue=6 | year=2007 | pages=1092–1098  |url=http://www.clinchem.org/content/53/6/1092.long | pmid=17478563 | doi=10.1016/j.jacl.2011.05.004}}</ref>

In an analysis of 40 studies involving 250,000 people, patients with coronary artery disease with ''normal'' BMIs were at higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease than people whose BMIs put them in the ''overweight'' range (BMI 25–29.9).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69251-9 |title=Association of bodyweight with total mortality and with cardiovascular events in coronary artery disease: A systematic review of cohort studies |year=2006 |last1=Romero-Corral |first1=A |last2=Montori |first2=V M |last3=Somers |first3=V K |last4=Korinek |first4=J |last5=Thomas |first5=R J |last6=Allison |first6=T G |last7=Mookadam |first7=F |last8=Lopez-Jimenez |first8=F |journal=The Lancet |volume=368 |issue=9536 |pmid=16920472 |pages=666–78}}</ref>

One study found that BMI had a good general correlation with body fat percentage, and noted that obesity has overtaken smoking as the world's number one cause of death. But it also notes that in the study 50% of men and 62% of women were obese according to body fat defined obesity, while only 21% of men and 31% of women were obese according to BMI, meaning that BMI was found to underestimate the number of obese subjects.<ref name="RomeroCorral2008"/>

A 2010 study that followed 11,000 subjects for up to eight years concluded that BMI is not a good measure for the risk of heart attack, stroke or death. A better measure was found to be the [[waist-to-height ratio]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1210/jc.2009-1584 |title=The Predictive Value of Different Measures of Obesity for Incident Cardiovascular Events and Mortality |year=2010 |last1=Schneider |first1=H J |last2=Friedrich |first2=N |last3=Klotsche |first3=J |last4=Pieper |first4=L |last5=Nauck |first5=M |last6=John |first6=U |last7=Dorr |first7=M |last8=Felix |first8=S |last9=Lehnert |first9=H |last10=Pittrow |first10=D |last11=Silber |first11=S |last12=Volzke |first12=H |last13=Stalla |first13=G K |last14=Wallaschofski |first14=H |last15=Wittchen |first15=H U |displayauthors=6 |journal=Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism |volume=95 |issue=4 |pmid=20130075 |pages=1777–85}}</ref> A 2011 study that followed 60,000 participants for up to 13 years found that [[waist–hip ratio]] was a better predictor of ischaemic heart disease mortality.<ref name= "MørkedalRomundstad2011">{{cite journal|last1=Mørkedal|first1=Bjørn|last2=Romundstad|first2=Pål R|last3=Vatten|first3=Lars J| title= Informativeness of indices of blood pressure, obesity and serum lipids in relation to ischaemic heart disease mortality: the HUNT-II study|journal=European Journal of Epidemiology|volume=26|issue=6|year=2011|pages=457–461|issn=0393-2990|doi=10.1007/s10654-011-9572-7| pmid=21461943|pmc=3115050}}</ref>
