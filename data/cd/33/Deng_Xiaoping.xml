At that time, the Soviet Union, through the<space/><link><target>Comintern</target></link>, an international organization supporting the communist movements, supported the Communists' alliance with the Nationalists of the Kuomintang (KMT) party founded by<space/><link><target>Sun Yat-sen</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>He arrived in<space/><link><target>Xi'an</target></link>, the stronghold of Feng Yuxiang, in March 1927.

This split resulted in part from<space/><link><target>Chiang Kai-shek</target></link>'s forcing them to flee areas controlled by the KMT. After the breakup of the alliance between communists and nationalists, Feng Yuxiang stood on the side of Chiang Kai-shek, and the Communists who participated in their army, such as Deng Xiaoping, were forced to flee. In 1929 Deng led the<space/><link><target>Baise Uprising</target></link><space/>in Guangxi province against the<space/><link><target>Kuomintang</target></link><space/>(KMT) government.

At that time, he began using the nickname &quot;Xiaoping&quot; and occupied prominent positions in the party apparatus. He participated in the historic emergency session on 7 August 1927 in which, by Soviet instruction, the Party dismissed its founder<space/><link><target>Chen Duxiu</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Qu Qiubai</target></link><space/>became the secretary general. In Wuhan, Deng first established contact with Mao Zedong, who was then little valued by militant pro-Soviet leaders of the party.</paragraph><paragraph>Between 1927 and 1929, Deng lived in Shanghai, where he helped organize protests that would be harshly persecuted by the Kuomintang authorities. The death of many Communist militants in those years led to a decrease in the number of members of the Communist Party, which enabled Deng to quickly move up the ranks. During this stage in Shanghai, Deng married a woman he met in Moscow, Zhang Xiyuan.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Military campaign in Guangxi</heading><paragraph>Beginning in 1929, he participated in the struggle against the Kuomintang in<space/><link><target>Guangxi</target></link>. The superiority of the forces of Chiang Kai-shek caused a huge number of casualties in the Communist ranks. The confrontational strategy of the party leadership was a failure that killed many militants. The response to this defeat catalyzed one of the most confusing episodes in the biography of Deng: in March 1931, he left the Communist Army seventh battalion to appear some time later in Shanghai.</paragraph><paragraph>His official biography states that Deng had been charged by his superiors with deserting from the battle zone before fleeing to Shanghai, where there were leaders of the underground Communist Party.

In addition, he discovered that many of his former comrades had died as a result of the Kuomintang's crackdown against the Communists.</paragraph><paragraph>The campaigns against the Communists in the cities represented a setback for the party and in particular to the Comintern Soviet advisers, who saw the mobilization of the urban proletariat as the force for the advancement of communism. Contrary to the urban vision of the revolution, based on the Soviet experience, the Communist leader Mao Zedong saw the rural peasants as the revolutionary force in China. In a mountainous area of Jiangxi province, where Mao went to establish a communist system, there developed the embryo of a future state of China under communism which adopted the official name of the Chinese Soviet Republic, but was better known as the &quot;<link><target>Jiangxi Soviet</target></link>&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>In one of the most important cities in the Soviet zone,<space/><link><target>Ruijin</target></link>, Deng took over as secretary of the Party Committee in the summer of 1931.

In 1933 he became director of the propaganda department of the Provincial Party Committee in Jiangxi. It was then that he married a young woman he had met in Shanghai named Jin Weiying.</paragraph><paragraph>The successes of the Soviet in Jiangxi made the party leaders decide to move to Jiangxi from Shanghai. The confrontation among Mao, the party leaders, and their Soviet advisers was increasingly tense and the struggle for power between the two factions led to the removal of Deng, who favored the ideas of Mao, from his position in the propaganda department. Despite the strife within the party, the Jiangxi Soviet became the first successful experiment of communist rule in rural China. It even issued stamps and paper money under the letterhead of the Soviet Republic of China, and the army of Chiang Kai-shek finally decided to attack the communist area.</paragraph><heading level='3'>The Long March</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Long March</arg></template><link><target>File:1937 Deng Xiaoping in NRA uniform.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>upright</part><part>Deng Xiaoping in NRA uniform, 1937</part></link>Surrounded by the more powerful army of the Republic of China, the Communists fled Jiangxi in October 1934. Thus began the epic movement that would mark a turning point in the development of Chinese communism. The evacuation was difficult, because the Army of the Republic had taken positions in all areas occupied by the Communists. Advancing through remote and mountainous terrain, some 100,000 men (and some women) managed to escape Jiangxi starting a long strategic retreat through the interior of China which ended one year later when between 8,000 and 9,000 survivors reached the northern province of<space/><link><target>Shaanxi</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>During the<space/><link><target>Zunyi Conference</target></link><space/>at the beginning of the Long March, the so-called 28 Bolsheviks, led by<space/><link><target>Bo Gu</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Wang Ming</target></link>, were ousted from power and Mao Zedong, to the dismay of the Soviet Union, had become the new leader of the Communist Party of China. The pro-Soviet Communist Party of China had ended and a new rural-inspired party emerged under the leadership of Mao. Deng had once again become a leading figure in the party, when the north ended up winning the civil war against the Kuomintang.</paragraph><paragraph>The confrontation between the two parties was temporarily interrupted, however, by the Japanese invasion, forcing the Kuomintang to form an alliance for the second time with the Communists to defend the nation against external aggression.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Japanese Invasion</heading><paragraph>The invasion of Japanese troops in 1937 marked the beginning of the<space/><link><target>Second Sino-Japanese War</target></link>.

Following up with guerrilla tactics from their positions in rural areas against cities under the control of the government of Chiang and their supply lines, the Communists were increasing the territory under their control, and incorporating more and more soldiers who had deserted the Nationalist army.</paragraph><paragraph>In the final phase of the war, Deng again exercised a key role as political leader and propaganda master as Political Commissar of the<space/><link><target>2nd Field Army</target></link><space/>commanded by<space/><link><target>Liu Bocheng</target></link>. He also participated in disseminating the ideas of Mao Zedong, which turned into the ideological foundation of the Communist Party.

In addition, many reforms would be introduced by local leaders, often not sanctioned by central government directives.

However, unlike the Soviet model, management was indirect through market mechanisms. Deng sustained Mao's legacy to the extent that he stressed the primacy of agricultural output and encouraged a significant decentralization of decision making in the rural economy teams and individual peasant households. At the local level, material incentives, rather than political appeals, were to be used to motivate the labor force, including allowing peasants to earn extra income by selling the produce of their private plots at free market.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Export focus</heading><paragraph>In the move toward market allocation, local municipalities and provinces were allowed to invest in industries that they considered most profitable, which encouraged investment in light manufacturing. Thus, Deng's reforms shifted China's development strategy to an emphasis on light industry and<space/><link><target>export-oriented industrialization</target><part>export-led growth</part></link>. Light industrial output was vital for a developing country coming from a low capital base. With the short gestation period, low capital requirements, and high foreign-exchange export earnings, revenues generated by light manufacturing were able to be reinvested in technologically more advanced production and further capital expenditures and investments.</paragraph><paragraph>However, in sharp contrast to the similar, but much less successful reforms in the<space/><link><target>Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</target></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>People's Republic of Hungary</target></link>, these investments were not government mandated. The capital invested in heavy industry largely came from the banking system, and most of that capital came from consumer deposits. One of the first items of the Deng reforms was to prevent reallocation of profits except through taxation or through the banking system; hence, the reallocation in state-owned industries was somewhat indirect, thus making them more or less independent from government interference. In short, Deng's reforms sparked an industrial revolution in China.<extension extension_name='ref'>FlorCruz, Jaime (19 December 2008)<space/><link type='external' href='http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/12/18/china.reform.florcruz/index.html'>&quot;Looking back over China's last 30 years&quot;</link><space/><italics>CNN</italics></extension></paragraph><paragraph>These reforms were a reversal of the Maoist policy of economic self-reliance. China decided to accelerate the modernization process by stepping up the volume of foreign trade, especially the purchase of machinery from Japan and the West. By participating in such export-led growth, China was able to step up the Four Modernizations by attaining certain foreign funds, market, advanced technologies and management experiences, thus accelerating its economic development. Deng attracted foreign companies to a series of<space/><link><target>Special Economic Zones of the People's Republic of China</target><part>Special Economic Zones</part></link>, where foreign investment and market liberalization were encouraged.</paragraph><paragraph>The reforms sought to improve labor productivity. New material incentives and bonus systems were introduced. Rural markets selling peasants' homegrown products and the surplus products of communes were revived. Not only did rural markets increase agricultural output, they stimulated industrial development as well. With peasants able to sell surplus agricultural yields on the open market, domestic consumption stimulated industrialization as well and also created political support for more difficult economic reforms.</paragraph><paragraph>There are some parallels between Deng's<space/><link><target>market socialism</target></link><space/>especially in the early stages, and<space/><link><target>Vladimir Lenin</target></link>'s NEP as well as those of<space/><link><target>Nikolai Bukharin</target></link>'s economic policies, in that both foresaw a role for private entrepreneurs and markets based on trade and pricing rather than central planning.
