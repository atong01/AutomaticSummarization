His self-exploratory texts reflect his search of how to be fully oneself, even to the point of owning one's sexual nature, without at the same time betraying one's values.

This caused the only crisis in the long-standing relationship between Allgret and Gide and damaged the relation with van Rysselberghe.

Catherine became his only descendant by blood. He liked to call Elisabeth &quot;La Dame Blanche&quot; (&quot;The White Lady&quot;). Elisabeth eventually left her husband to move to Paris and manage the practical aspects of Gide's life (they had adjoining apartments built for each on the rue Vavin). She worshiped him, but evidently they no longer had a sexual relationship. Gide's legal wife, Madeleine, died in 1938.
