Amr Diab was born on October 11, 1961 in Port Said, Egypt into an artistic family. His father, Abdul Basset Diab, worked for the Suez Canal Corporation and was the chairman of Marine Construction & Shipbuilding in the canal. Diab's father played a huge role in igniting the early sparks of musical inspiration towards Diab's early stages in his professional music career. Diab, at the age of six, had his first shot at fame when he sang the Egyptian National Anthem "[[Bilady, Bilady, Bilady]]" at the annual July 23 Festival in Port Said. Shocking everyone with his amazing voice and singing talent, he was rewarded with a guitar from the governor of Port Said for his excellence. After being awarded the guitar, Diab saw this as his shot to fame, and continued his life singing and pleasing people with his voice through his teenage years. Diab had earned his bachelor's degree in Arabic Music and graduated at the Cairo Academy of Arts in 1986.

== Music videos ==

Diab is one of the first singers to popularize music videos in the Arab world and the first Egyptian singer to appear in music videos.<ref name=tinge />

== Film career ==

Diab's fame in the music industry has led him to experiment with other forms of media, such as film. Amr played himself in his first film, ''El Afareet'', which was released in 1989. It also starred Madiha Kamel. His second film ''Ice Cream in Gleam'' (''Ays Krim fi Glym''), in which Diab starred in 1992, was chosen as one of the best five Egyptian musical films by the [[UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television]]. The film was featured in the UCLA Film and Television Archive's new program "Music on the Nile: Fifty Years of Egyptian Musical Films" at James Bridges Theater at UCLA on 6, 8 and 10 April 1999. David Chute of the ''Los Angeles Weekly'' termed it "observant" and "a big leap".<ref>{{cite news |first= David |last= Chute |author2=Irene G. Behnan |title= All Singing! All Belly-Dancing |url= http://www.laweekly.com/1999-04-08/film-tv/all-singing-all-belly-dancing/2 |work= Los Angeles Weekly |date= 8 April 1999 |accessdate=4 June 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090627134412/http://www.laweekly.com/1999-04-08/film-tv/all-singing-all-belly-dancing/2| archivedate= 27 June 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> His third movie was released in 1993, and was named ''Deahk We La'ab'' (''Laughter and Fun''). The film premiered in the Egyptian Film Festival in 1993. Amr played alongside international Egyptian movie star [[Omar Sharif]] (''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'', ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]'') and [[Yousra]]. Overall, Diab did not experience the same level of success in film that he had with his music career. Since 1993, Diab has focused on his singing career.

== Egyptian Revolution ==

During the 2011 uprising, some protesters criticized Diab for staying silent, and for fleeing Egypt for London.<ref>{{cite web|title=Egyptian celebrities face protesters' wrath in post-Mubarak Egypt|url=http://www.aawsat.net/2011/02/article55247479|work=Asharq al-awsat, 18 February 2011|accessdate=7 May 2013}}</ref> However, a few days after former President [[Hosni Mubarak]] stepped down, Amr Diab composed and sang a memorial song, "Masr A'let" (Egypt Said Its Word),<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxyHbWY71s</ref> and released it in conjunction with a music video showing pictures of the martyrs who died in the [[2011 Egyptian revolution|uprising]]. He also initiated a charity campaign "Masry Begad" ("Real Egyptian"), a social national program aimed at serving and rebuilding Egyptian society. His online radio station Diab FM often presents talks and discussions about what the Diab FM team can offer to the community as well as applying it practically by being present in different sites across Egypt with a new humanitarian project each week.<ref>http://diabfm.com/masry-begad</ref>
