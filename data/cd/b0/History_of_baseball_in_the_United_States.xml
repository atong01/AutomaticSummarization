But baseball executive Albert Spalding disagreed. Baseball, said Spalding, was fundamentally an American sport and began on American soil. To settle the matter, the two men appointed a commission, headed by Abraham Mills, the fourth president of the National League of Professional Baseball Clubs. The commission, which also included six other sports executives, labored for three years, after which it declared that<space/><link><target>Abner Doubleday</target></link><space/>invented the national pastime. This would have been a surprise to Doubleday. The late Civil War hero &quot;never knew that he had invented baseball.

The NABBP was the first organization to govern the sport and to establish a championship. Aided by the<space/><link><target>American Civil War</target><part>Civil War</part></link>, membership grew to almost 100 clubs by 1865 and to over 400 by 1867, including clubs from as far away as<space/><link><target>California</target></link>. During the Civil War, soldiers from different parts of the United States played baseball together, leading to a more unified national version of the sport. Beginning in 1869, the NABBP permitted<space/><link><target>professional</target></link><space/>play, addressing a growing practice that had not been permitted under its rules to that point. The first and most prominent professional clubs of the NABBP era were the<space/><link><target>Cincinnati Red Stockings</target></link><space/>in Ohio, which lasted only two years.

In the 1860s, aided by the War,<space/><link><target>Knickerbocker Rules</target><part>&quot;New York&quot; style</part></link><space/>baseball expanded into a national game, as its first governing body, The<space/><link><target>National Association of Base Ball Players</target></link><space/>was formed. The NABBP soon expanded into a true national organization, although most of the strongest clubs remained those based in the northeastern part of the country. In its 12-year history as an amateur league, the<space/><link><target>Brooklyn Atlantics</target></link><space/>won seven championships, establishing themselves as the first true dynasty in the sport, although, the<space/><link><target>New York Mutuals</target></link><space/>were widely considered to be one of the best teams of the era as well. By the end of<space/><link><target>1865 in baseball</target><part>1865</part></link>, almost 100 clubs were members of the NABBP. By 1867, it ballooned to over 400 members, including some clubs from as far away as<space/><link><target>List of baseball parks in San Francisco, California</target><part>San Francisco</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Louisiana</target></link>. One of these clubs, the Chicago White Stockings, won the championship in 1870. Today known as the<space/><link><target>Chicago Cubs</target></link>, they are the oldest team in American organized sports.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">April 2015</arg></template><space/>Because of this growth, regional and state organizations began to assume a more prominent role in the governance of the sport.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Professionalism</heading><paragraph>The NABBP of America was initially established upon principles of<space/><link><target>amateurism</target></link>. However, even early in its history some star players, such as<space/><link><target>Jim Creighton</target><part>James Creighton</part></link><space/>of<space/><link><target>Excelsior of Brooklyn</target><part>Excelsior</part></link>, received compensation, either secretly or indirectly. In<space/><link><target>1866 in sports</target><part>1866</part></link>, the NABBP investigated<space/><link><target>Athletic of Philadelphia</target></link><space/>for paying three players including<space/><link><target>Lip Pike</target></link>, but ultimately took no action against either the club or the players. To address this growing practice, and to restore integrity to the game, at its December<space/><link><target>1868 in sports</target><part>1868</part></link><space/>meeting the NABBP established a professional category for the<space/><link><target>1869 in sports</target><part>1869</part></link><space/>season. Clubs desiring to pay players were now free to declare themselves<space/><link><target>professional</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>Cincinnati Red Stockings</target></link><space/>were the first to so declare themselves as openly professional, and were easily the most aggressive in recruiting the best available players. Twelve clubs, including most of the strongest clubs in the NABBP, ultimately declared themselves professional for the<space/><link><target>1869 in sports</target><part>1869</part></link><space/>season.</paragraph><paragraph>The first attempt at forming a &quot;<link><target>Major North American professional sports teams</target><part>major league</part></link>&quot; produced the<space/><link><target>National Association of Professional Base Ball Players</target></link>, which lasted from 1871 to 1875. The now all professional Chicago White Stockings, financed by businessman<space/><link><target>William Hulbert</target></link>, became a charter member of the league along with the Red Stockings, who had dissolved and moved to Boston. The White Stockings were close contenders all season, despite the fact that the<space/><link><target>Great Chicago Fire</target></link><space/>had destroyed the team's home field and most of their equipment. The White Stockings finished the season in second place, but ultimately were forced to drop out of the league during the city's recovery period, finally returning to National Association play in 1874. Over the next couple seasons, The<space/><link><target>Ivers Whitney Adams#Baseball</target><part>Boston Red Stockings</part></link><space/>dominated the league and hoarded many of the game's best players, even those who were under contract with other teams. After<space/><link><target>Davy Force</target></link><space/>signed with Chicago, and then breached his contract to play in Boston, Hulbert became discouraged by the &quot;contract jumping&quot; as well as the overall disorganization of the N.A., and thus spearheaded the movement to form a stronger organization. The end result of his efforts was the formation a much more &quot;ethical&quot; league, which became known as the<space/><link><target>National League</target><part>National Base Ball League</part></link>. After a series of rival leagues were organized but failed, (most notably the<space/><link><target>American Association (19th century)</target><part>American Base Ball Association</part></link>, which spawned the clubs which would ultimately become the<space/><link><target>St. Louis Cardinals</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Brooklyn Dodgers</target></link>) the current<space/><link><target>American League</target></link>, evolving from the minor Western League of 1893, was established in 1901.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Rise of the major leagues</heading><paragraph><link><target>Image:Pre-1900 MLB teams.png</target><part>thumb</part><part>400px</part><part>Cities that hosted 19th century MLB teams, with cities that still host their 19th century team in black. With the exception of a team in Washington and a few short-lived teams in Virginia and Kentucky, major league baseball would not expand out of the<space/><link><target>Northeastern United States</target><part>Northeast</part></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>Midwestern United States</target><part>Midwest</part></link><space/>until after<space/><link><target>World War II</target></link>.</part></link>In 1870, a<space/><link><target>wikt:schism</target><part>schism</part></link><space/>developed between professional and amateur ballplayers. The NABBP split into two groups. The<space/><link><target>National Association of Professional Baseball Players</target><part>National Association of ''Professional'' Base Ball Players</part></link><space/>operated from 1871 through 1875, and is considered by some to have been the first major league. Its amateur counterpart disappeared after only a few years.</paragraph><paragraph>William Hulbert's National League, which was formed after the National Association proved ineffective, put its emphasis on &quot;clubs&quot; rather than &quot;players&quot;. Clubs now had the ability to enforce player contracts, preventing players from jumping to higher-paying clubs. Clubs in turn were required to play their full schedule of games, rather than forfeiting scheduled games once out of the running for the league championship, as happened frequently under the National Association. A concerted effort was made to reduce the amount of gambling on games which was leaving the validity of results in doubt.</paragraph><paragraph>At the same time, a &quot;<link><target>gentlemen's agreement</target></link>&quot; was struck between the clubs to<space/><link><target>Baseball color line</target><part>exclude non-white players</part></link><space/>from professional baseball, a bar that remained until 1947. It is a common misconception that<space/><link><target>Jackie Robinson</target></link><space/>was the first African-American major-league ballplayer; he was actually only the first after a long gap (and the first in the modern era).<space/><link><target>Moses Fleetwood Walker</target></link><space/>and his brother Welday Walker were unceremoniously dropped from major and minor-league rosters in the 1880s, as were other African-Americans in baseball. An unknown number of African-Americans played in the major leagues by representing themselves as Indians, or South or Central Americans. And a still larger number played in the minor leagues and on amateur teams as well. In the majors, however, it was not until the signing of Robinson (in the National League) and<space/><link><target>Larry Doby</target></link><space/>(in the American League) that baseball began to remove its color bar.</paragraph><paragraph>The early years of the National League were tumultuous, with threats from rival leagues and a rebellion by players against the hated &quot;reserve clause&quot;, which restricted the free movement of players between clubs. Competitive leagues formed regularly, and also disbanded regularly. The most successful was the American Association (18811891), sometimes called the &quot;beer and whiskey league&quot; for its tolerance of the sale of alcoholic beverages to spectators. For several years, the National League and American Association champions met in a postseason championship seriesthe first attempt at a<space/><link><target>Baseball/World Series</target><part>World Series</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>Union Association</target></link><space/>survived for only one season (1884), as did the<space/><link><target>Players League</target></link><space/>(1890), an attempt to return to the<space/><link><target>National Association of Professional Base Ball Players</target><part>National Association</part></link><space/>structure of a league controlled by the players themselves. Both leagues are considered major leagues by many baseball researchers because of the perceived high caliber of play and the number of star players featured. However, some researchers have disputed the major league status of the Union Association, pointing out that franchises came and went and contending that the St. Louis club, which was deliberately &quot;stacked&quot; by the league's president (who owned that club), was the only club that was anywhere close to major league caliber.</paragraph><paragraph>In fact, there were dozens of leagues, large and small, at this time. What made the National League &quot;major&quot; was its dominant position in the major cities, particularly New York City, the edgy, emotional nerve center of baseball. The large cities offered baseball teams national media distribution systems and fan bases that could generate revenues enabling teams to hire the best players in the country.</paragraph><paragraph>A number of other leagues, including the venerable Eastern League, threatened the dominance of the National League. The Western League, founded in 1893, became particularly aggressive. Its fiery leader<space/><link><target>Ban Johnson</target></link><space/>railed against the National League and promised to build a new league that would grab the best players and field the best teams. The Western League began play in April 1894 with teams in<space/><link><target>Detroit Tigers</target><part>Detroit</part></link><space/>(the only league team that has not moved since),<space/><link><target>Cleveland Indians</target><part>Grand Rapids</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Oakland Athletics</target><part>Indianapolis</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Minnesota Twins</target><part>Kansas City</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Baltimore Orioles</target><part>Milwaukee</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Minneapolis Millers</target><part>Minneapolis</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Chicago White Sox</target><part>Sioux City</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Boston Red Sox</target><part>Toledo</part></link>. Prior to the 1900 season, the league changed its name to the<space/><link><target>American League</target></link><space/>and moved several franchises to larger, strategic locations. In 1901 the American League declared its intent to operate as a major league.</paragraph><paragraph>The resulting bidding war for players led to widespread contract-breaking and legal disputes. One of the most famous involved star second baseman<space/><link><target>Napoleon Lajoie</target></link>, who in 1901 went across town in Philadelphia from the National League Phillies to the American League Athletics. Barred by a court injunction from playing baseball in the state of Pennsylvania the next year, Lajoie was traded to the Cleveland team, where he played and managed for many years.</paragraph><paragraph>The war between the American and National caused shock waves throughout the baseball world. At a meeting in 1901, the other baseball leagues negotiated a plan to maintain their independence. On September 5, 1901<space/><link><target>Patrick T. Powers</target></link>, president of the<space/><link><target>Eastern League (U.S. baseball)</target><part>Eastern League</part></link><space/>announced the formation of the second<space/><link><target>Minor League Baseball</target><part>National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues</part></link>, the NABPL or &quot;NA&quot; for short.</paragraph><paragraph>These leagues did not consider themselves &quot;minor&quot; a term that did not come into vogue until St. Louis Cardinals GM<space/><link><target>Branch Rickey</target></link><space/>pioneered the farm system in the 1930s. Nevertheless, these financially troubled leagues, by beginning the practice of selling players to the more affluent National and American leagues, embarked on a path that eventually led to the loss of their independent status.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Image:John E Sheridan Pennsylvania Georgetown Baseball c1901.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>300px</part><part>Poster for<space/><link><target>Penn Quakers</target><part>University of Pennsylvania</part></link><space/>vs.<space/><link><target>Georgetown University</target></link><space/>baseball game, circa 1901, by<space/><link><target>John E.

While the NA continues to this day, he saw it as a tool to end threats from smaller rivals who might some day want to expand in other territories and threaten his league's dominance.</paragraph><paragraph>After 1902 both leagues and the NABPL signed a new National Agreement which achieved three things:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>First and foremost, it governed player contracts that set up mechanisms to end the cross-league raids on rosters and reinforced the power of the hated<space/><link><target>reserve clause</target></link><space/>that kept players virtual slaves to their baseball masters.</listitem><listitem>Second, it led to the playing of a &quot;<link><target>Baseball/World Series</target><part>World Series</part></link>&quot; in 1903 between the two major league champions. The first World Series was won by Boston of the American League.</listitem><listitem>Lastly, it established a system of control and dominance for the major leagues over the independents. There would not be another Ban Johnson-like rebellion from the ranks of leagues with smaller cities. Selling player contracts was rapidly becoming a staple business of the independent leagues. During the rough and tumble years of the American-National struggle, player contracts were violated at the independents as well: Players that the team had developed would sign deals with the National or American leagues without any form of compensation to the indy club.</listitem></list><paragraph>The new agreement tied independent contracts to the reserve-clause national league contracts. Baseball players were a commodity, like cars. $5,000 bought a player's skill set. It set up a rough classification system for independent leagues that regulated the dollar value of contracts, the forerunner of the system refined by Rickey and used today.</paragraph><paragraph>It also gave the NA great power. Many independents walked away from the 1901 meeting. The deal with the NA punished those other indies who had not joined the NA and submitted to the will of the 'majors.' The NA also agreed to the deal to prevent more pilfering of players with little or no compensation for the players' development. Several leagues, seeing the writing on the wall, eventually joined the NA, which grew in size over the next several years.</paragraph><paragraph>In the very early part of the 20th century, known as the &quot;<link><target>dead-ball era</target></link>&quot;, baseball rules and equipment favored the &quot;inside game&quot; and the game was played more violently and aggressively than it is today. This period ended in the 1920s with several changes that gave advantages to hitters. In the largest parks, the outfield fences were brought closer to the infield. In addition, the strict enforcement of new rules governing the size, shape and construction of the ball caused it to travel farther.</paragraph><paragraph>The first professional black baseball club, the Cuban Giants, was organized in 1885. Subsequent professional black baseball clubs played each other independently, without an official league to organize the sport.<space/><link><target>Rube Foster</target></link>, a former ballplayer, founded the<space/><link><target>Negro National League (19201931)</target><part>Negro National League</part></link><space/>in 1920.

These became known as the<space/><link><target>Negro League baseball</target><part>Negro Leagues</part></link>, though these leagues never had any formal overall structure comparable to the Major Leagues. The Negro National League did well until 1930, but folded during the<space/><link><target>Great Depression</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>From 1942 to 1948, the<space/><link><target>Negro League World Series</target></link><space/>was revived.

It was not unusual for a single baseball to last an entire game.

Nineteen-year-old rookie first baseman<space/><link><target>Fred Merkle</target></link>, later to become one of the best players at his position in the league, was on first base, with teammate Moose McCormick on third with two outs and the game tied. Giants shortstop Al Bridwell socked a single, scoring McCormick and apparently winning the game. However, Merkle, instead of advancing to second base, ran toward the clubhouse to avoid the spectators mobbing the field, which at that time was a common, acceptable practice. The Cubs' second baseman,<space/><link><target>Johnny Evers</target></link>, noticed this. In the confusion that followed, Evers claimed to have retrieved the ball and touched second base, forcing Merkle out and nullifying the run scored. Evers brought this to the attention of the umpire that day, Hank O'Day, who after some deliberation called the runner out. Because of the state of the field O'Day thereby called the game. Despite the arguments by the Giants, the league upheld O'Day's decision and ordered the game replayed at the end of the season, if necessary. It turned out that the Cubs and Giants ended the season tied for first place, so the game was indeed replayed, and the Cubs won the game, the pennant, and subsequently the<space/><link><target>1908 World Series</target><part>World Series</part></link><space/>(the last Cubs Series victory to date, as it turns out).</paragraph><paragraph>For his part, Merkle was doomed to endless criticism and vilification throughout his career for this lapse, which went down in history as &quot;<link><target>Merkle's Boner</target></link>&quot;.

Umpires were also required to put new balls into play whenever the current ball became scuffed or discolored.

Discolored balls, harder for batters to see and therefore harder for batters to dodge, have been rigorously removed from play ever since. There are two side effects. One, of course, is that if the batter can see the ball more easily, the batter can hit the ball more easily. The second is that without scuffs and other damage, pitchers are limited in their ability to control spin and so to cause altered trajectories.</paragraph><paragraph>At the end of the 1919 season Harry Frazee, then owner of the<space/><link><target>Boston Red Sox</target></link>, sold a group of his star players to the<space/><link><target>New York Yankees</target></link>.

He started his career as a pitcher in 1914, and by 1916 was considered one of the dominant left-handed pitchers in the game. When Edward Barrow, managing the Red Sox, converted him to an outfielder, ballplayers and sportswriters were shocked. It was apparent, however, that Ruth's bat in the lineup every day was far more valuable than Ruth's arm on the mound every fourth day. Ruth swatted 29 home runs in his last season in Boston. The next year, as a Yankee, he would hit 54 and in 1921 he hit 59. His 1927 mark of 60 home runs would last until 1961* (an asterisk was used then - because there were records for 154 and 162 game seasons; his record was ultimately eclipsed 1998).</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Hank Greenberg 1937 cropped.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Hall of Famer<space/><link><target>Hank Greenberg</target></link></part></link>Ruth's power hitting ability demonstrated a new way to play the game, and one that was extremely popular with the crowds.

In addition to Ruth, hitters such as<space/><link><target>Rogers Hornsby</target></link><space/>also took advantage, with Hornsby compiling extraordinary figures for both power and average in the early 1920s.

Although Rickey was able to get the player into his room for that night, he was taken aback when he reached his room to find Thomas upset and crying about this injustice. Rickey related this incident as an example of why he wanted a full de-segregation of the nation, not only in baseball.</paragraph><paragraph>In the mid-1940s, Rickey had compiled a list of Negro League ballplayers for a potential major league contract. Realizing that the first<space/><link><target>African American</target></link><space/>signee would be a magnet for prejudicial sentiment, however, Rickey was intent on finding a player with a distinguished personality and character that would allow him to tolerate the inevitable abuse. Rickey's sights eventually settled on<space/><link><target>Jackie Robinson</target></link>, a shortstop with the<space/><link><target>Kansas City Monarchs</target></link>. Although probably not the best player in the Negro Leagues at the time, Robinson was an exceptional talent, was college-educated, and had the marketable distinction of serving as an officer during World War II. More importantly, Robinson possessed the inner strength to handle the inevitable abuse to come. To prepare him for the task, Robinson first played in 1946 for the Dodgers'<space/><link><target>minor league</target></link><space/>team, the<space/><link><target>Montreal Royals</target></link>, which proved an arduous emotional challenge, but he also enjoyed fervently enthusiastic support from the<space/><link><target>Montreal</target></link><space/>fans. On April 15, 1947, Robinson broke the<space/><link><target>Baseball color line</target><part>color barrier</part></link>, which had been tacitly recognized for over 50 years, with his appearance for the<space/><link><target>Brooklyn Dodgers</target></link><space/>at<space/><link><target>Ebbets Field</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Eleven weeks later, on July 5, 1947, the<space/><link><target>American League</target></link><space/>was integrated by the signing of<space/><link><target>Larry Doby</target></link><space/>to the<space/><link><target>Cleveland Indians</target></link>. Over the next few years a handful of black baseball players made appearances in the majors, including<space/><link><target>Roy Campanella</target></link><space/>(teammate to Robinson in Brooklyn) and<space/><link><target>Satchel Paige</target></link><space/>(teammate to Doby in Cleveland).<extension extension_name='ref' name="break"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://coe.ksu.edu/nlbemuseum/resource/lps/BarrierBreakers.pdf<space/></arg><arg name="title">Barrier Breakers (Negro League Baseball Museum)</arg></template></extension><space/>Paige, who had pitched more than 2400 innings in the Negro Leagues, sometimes two and three games a day, was still effective at 42, and still playing at 59.

Backed by the MLBPA,<space/><link><target>St. Louis Cardinals</target></link><space/>outfielder<space/><link><target>Curt Flood</target></link><space/>took the leagues to court to negate a player trade, citing the<space/><link><target>Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution</target><part>13th Amendment</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>antitrust</target></link><space/>legislation. In 1972 he finally lost his case in the<space/><link><target>Supreme Court of the United States</target><part>United States Supreme Court</part></link><space/>by a vote of 5 to 3, but gained large-scale public sympathy, and the damage had been done. The reserve clause survived, but it had been irrevocably weakened. In 1975<space/><link><target>Andy Messersmith</target></link><space/>of the Dodgers and<space/><link><target>Dave McNally</target></link><space/>of the<space/><link><target>Montreal Expos</target></link><space/>played without contracts, and then declared themselves free agents in response to<space/><link><target>Seitz decision</target><part>an arbitrator's ruling</part></link>. Handcuffed by concessions made in the Flood case, the owners had no choice but to accept the collective bargaining package offered by the MLBPA, and the reserve clause was effectively ended, to be replaced by the current system of free-agency and arbitration.</paragraph><paragraph>While the legal challenges were going on, the game continued. In 1969 the<space/><link><target>1969 New York Mets season</target><part>&quot;Miracle Mets&quot;</part></link>, just 7 years after their formation, recorded their first winning season, won the National League East and finally the World Series.</paragraph><paragraph>On the field, the 1970s saw some of the longest standing records fall and the rise of two powerhouse dynasties. In Oakland, the<space/><link><target>Oakland Athletics</target><part>Swinging A's</part></link><space/>were overpowering, winning the Series in '72, '73 and '74, and five straight division titles. The strained relationships between teammates, who included<space/><link><target>Catfish Hunter</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Vida Blue</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Reggie Jackson</target></link>, gave the lie to the need for &quot;chemistry&quot; between players. The National League, on the other hand, belonged to<space/><link><target>the Big Red Machine</target></link><space/>in Cincinnati, where<space/><link><target>Sparky Anderson</target></link>'s team, which included<space/><link><target>Pete Rose</target></link><space/>as well as<space/><link><target>Baseball Hall of Fame</target><part>Hall of Famers</part></link><space/>Tony Perez,<space/><link><target>Johnny Bench</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Joe Morgan</target></link>, succeeded the A's run in 1975.</paragraph><paragraph>The decade also contained great individual achievements as well. On April 8, 1974,<space/><link><target>Hank Aaron</target></link><space/>of the<space/><link><target>Atlanta Braves</target></link><space/>hit his 715th career home run, surpassing<space/><link><target>Babe Ruth</target></link>'s all-time record. He would retire in 1976 with 755 and that was just one of numerous records he achieved, many of which, including<space/><link><target>Total bases</target></link><space/>scored, still stand today. There was great pitching too: between 1973 and 1975,<space/><link><target>Nolan Ryan</target></link><space/>threw 4<space/><link><target>no-hitter</target><part>&quot;no-hit&quot; games</part></link>. He would add a record-breaking fifth in 1981 and two more before his retirement in 1993, by which time he had also accumulated 5,715 strikeouts, another record, in a 27-year career.</paragraph><heading level='2'>The marketing and hype era</heading><paragraph><template><target>cleanup</target><arg>section</arg><arg name="date">September 2007</arg></template>From the 1980s onward, the major league game has changed dramatically from a combination of effects brought about by free agency, improvements in the science of sports conditioning, changes in the marketing and television broadcasting of sporting events, and the push by brand-name products for greater visibility. These events lead to greater labor difficulties, fan disaffection, skyrocketing prices, changes in the way that the game is played, and problems with the use of performance-enhancing substances like<space/><link><target>steroids</target></link><space/>tainting the race for records. Through this period crowds generally rose. Average attendances first broke 20,000 in 1979 and 30,000 in 1993. That year total attendance hit 70 million, but baseball was hit hard by a strike in 1994, and as of 2005 it has only marginally improved on those 1993 records.</paragraph><heading level='3'>The science of the sport changes the game</heading><paragraph>During the 1980s, the science of conditioning and workouts greatly improved. Weight rooms and training equipment were improved. Trainers and doctors developed better diets and regimens to make athletes bigger, healthier, and stronger than they had ever been.</paragraph><paragraph>Another major change that had been occurring during this time was the adoption of the<space/><link><target>pitch count</target></link>. Starting pitchers playing complete games had not been an unusual thing in baseball's history. Now pitching coaches watched to see how many pitches a player had thrown over the game. At anywhere from 100 to 125, pitchers increasingly would be pulled out to preserve their arms. Bullpens began to specialize more, with more pitchers being trained as middle relievers, and a few hurlers, usually possessing high velocity but not much durability, as closers.</paragraph><paragraph>Along with the expansion of teams, the addition of more pitchers needed to play a complete game stressed the total number of quality players available in a system that restricted its talent searches at that time to America, Canada, Latin America, and the Caribbean.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Television</heading><paragraph>Baseball had been watched live since the mid 20th century. Television sports' arrival in the 1950s increased attention and revenue for all major league clubs at first. The television programming was extremely regional. It hurt the minor and independent leagues most. People stayed home to watch<space/><link><target>Maury Wills</target></link><space/>rather than watch unknowns at their local baseball park. Major League Baseball, as it always did, made sure that it controlled rights and fees charged for the broadcasts of all games, just as it did on radio. It brought additional revenues and attention both from the broadcast itself, and from the increases in attendance and merchandise sales that expanded audiences allowed.</paragraph><paragraph>The national networks began televising national games of the week, opening the door for a national audience to see particular clubs. While most teams were broadcast, emphasis was always on the league leaders and the major market franchises that could draw the largest audience.</paragraph><heading level='3'>The rise of cable</heading><paragraph>In the 1970s the cable revolution began. The Atlanta Braves became a power contender with greater revenues generated by<space/><link><target>TBS (TV network)</target><part>WTBS</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Ted Turner</target></link>'s Atlanta-based Super-Station, that broadcast &quot;America's Team&quot; to cable households nationwide. The roll out of<space/><link><target>ESPN</target></link>, then regional sports networks (now mostly under the umbrella of<space/><link><target>Fox Sports Net</target></link>) changed sports news and particularly impacted baseball. Potboiled down to the thirty-second game highlight, and now under the microscope of news organizations that needed to fill 24 hours of time, the amount of attention paid to major league players magnified to staggering levels from where it had been just 20 years prior.</paragraph><paragraph>It brought with it increased attention for individual players, who reached super-star status nationwide on careers that often were not as compelling as those who had come before them in a less media intense time.</paragraph><paragraph>As player contract values soared, and the number of broadcasters, commentators, columnists, and sports writers also soared. The competition for a fresh angle on any story became fierce. Media pundits began questioning the high salaries that the players received. Coverage began to become intensely negative. Players personal lives, which had always been off-limits unless something extreme happened, became the fodder of editorials, insider stories on television, and features in magazines. When the use of performance-enhancing drugs became an issue, the gap between the sports media and the players whom they covered widened further.</paragraph><paragraph>With the development of<space/><link><target>satellite television</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>digital cable</target></link>, Major League Baseball launched baseball channels with season subscription fees, making it possible for fans to watch virtually every game played as they played.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Team networks</heading><paragraph>The next round became the single-team cable networks.<space/><link><target>YES Network</target></link><space/>&amp;<space/><link><target>New England Sports Network</target><part>NESN</part></link>, the New York Yankees &amp; Boston Red Sox cable television networks, respectively, took in millions to broadcast games not only in New York and Boston but around the country. These networks generated as much revenue or more annually for large market teams like the Yankees and Red Sox as their entire baseball operations did. By making these separate companies, these owners were able to exclude the money from consideration of deals.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Sponsorships, endorsements, &amp; merchandise</heading><paragraph>Television and greater media coverage in magazines and newspapers trying to attract a new generation of non-readers also brought in the sponsors, and even more money, that would attract players to new financial opportunities and bring in other elements to the business of baseball that would impact the game.</paragraph><paragraph>Baseball memorabilia and souvenirs, including baseball cards, exploded in price as networks of adults became more sophisticated in their trading. This would explode yet again in the late 1990s, as the<space/><link><target>Internet</target></link>, and the website<space/><link><target>eBay</target></link><space/>provided venues for collectors of all things baseball to trade with each other. Regionalized pricing was wiped away, and many objects, baseballs, bats, and the like began selling for high dollar values. This in turn brought in new businessmen whose sole means of making a living was acquiring autographs and memorabilia from the athletes. Memorabilia hounds fought with fans to get signatures worth $20, $60, or even $100 or more in their stores.</paragraph><paragraph>Beyond the staple billboards, large corporations like NIKE and Champion fought to make sure that their logos were seen on the clothing and shoes worn by athletes on the field. This kind of association branding became a new revenue stream. In the late 1990s and into the dawn of the 21st century, the dugout, the backstops behind home plate, and anywhere else that might be seen by a camera all became fair game for inserting advertising.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Player wealth and influence</heading><paragraph>Players who had been dramatically underpaid for generations were now replaced by players who were paid extremely well for their services.</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><bold>Sports agents</bold></listitem></list><paragraph>By the 1970s a new generation of<space/><link><target>sports agents</target></link><space/>were hawking the talents of players who knew baseball but didn't know how the business end of the game was played.

The many contractual disputes between players and owners came to a head in 1981. Previous players' strikes (in 1972, 1973 and 1980) had been held in preseason, with only the 1972<space/><link><target>1972 Major League Baseball strike</target><part>stoppage</part></link><space/>over benefits causing disruption to the regular season from April 1 to April 13. Also, in 1976 the owners had locked the players out of<space/><link><target>Spring training</target></link><space/>in a dispute over<space/><link><target>free agent</target><part>free agency</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>The crux of the 1981 dispute was about compensation for the loss of players to free agency. After losing a top-rank player in such a way the owners wanted a mid-rank player in return, the so-called<space/><italics>sixteenth player</italics><space/>(each club was allowed to protect 15 players from this rule). Losing lower rated free agents would have correspondingly smaller compensation. The players, only recently freed from the bondage of the reserve clause, found this unacceptable, and withdrew their labor,<space/><link><target>1981 Major League Baseball strike</target><part>striking</part></link><space/>on June 12. Immediately, the U.S. Government<space/><link><target>National Labor Relations Board</target></link><space/>ruled that the owners had not been negotiating in good faith, and installed a federal mediator to reach a solution. Seven weeks and 713 games were lost in the middle of the season, before the owners backed down on July 31, settling for much lower ranked players as compensation. By then much of the season had been lost, and the season was continued as distinct halves starting August 9, with the playoffs reorganized to reflect this.</paragraph><paragraph>Throughout the 1980s then, baseball seemed to prosper. The competitive balance between franchises saw fifteen different teams make the<space/><link><target>World Series</target></link>, and nine different champions during the decade. Also, every season from 1978 through 1987 saw a different World Series winner, a streak unprecedented in baseball history. Turmoil was, however, just around the corner. In 1986<space/><link><target>Pete Rose</target></link><space/>retired from playing for the<space/><link><target>Cincinnati Reds</target></link>, having broken<space/><link><target>Ty Cobb</target></link>'s record by accumulating 4,256 hits during his career. He continued as Reds manager until, in 1989 it was revealed that he was being investigated for sports gambling, including the possibility that he had bet on teams with which he was involved. While Rose admitted a gambling problem, he denied having bet on baseball. Federal prosecutor John Dowd investigated and, on<space/><link><target>Dowd Report</target><part>his recommendation</part></link>, Rose was banned from organised baseball, a move which precluded his possible inclusion in the<space/><link><target>National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum</target><part>Hall of Fame</part></link>. In a meeting with Commissioner<space/><link><target>A. Bartlett Giamatti</target><part>Giamatti</part></link>, Rose, having failed in a legal action to prevent it, accepted his punishment. It was, essentially, the same fate that had befallen the Black Sox seventy years previously. (Rose, however, would continue to deny that he bet on baseball until he finally confessed to it in his 2004 autobiography.)</paragraph><heading level='3'>Strike two (1994)</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>1994–95 Major League Baseball strike</arg></template>Labor relations were still strained. There had been a two-day strike in 1985 (over the division of television revenue money), and a<space/><link><target>1990 Major League Baseball lockout</target><part>32-day spring training lockout</part></link><space/>in 1990 (again over salary structure and benefits). By far the worst action would come in 1994. The seeds were sown earlier: in 1992 the owners sought to renegotiate salary and<space/><link><target>free agent</target><part>free-agency</part></link><space/>terms, but little progress was made. The standoff continued until the beginning of 1994 when the existing agreement expired, with no agreement on what was to replace it. Adding to the problems was the perception that &quot;small market&quot; teams, such as the struggling<space/><link><target>Seattle Mariners</target></link><space/>could not compete with high spending teams such as those in<space/><link><target>New York Yankees</target><part>New York</part></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>Los Angeles Dodgers</target><part>Los Angeles</part></link>.

In 2001 Bonds knocked out 73<space/><link><target>List of Major League Baseball home run champions</target><part>home runs</part></link>, breaking the record set by McGwire by hitting his 71st on October 5, 2001. In addition to the home run record, Bonds also set single-season marks for<space/><link><target>base on balls</target></link><space/>with 177 (breaking the previous record of 170, set by<space/><link><target>Babe Ruth</target></link><space/>in 1923) and<space/><link><target>slugging percentage</target></link><space/>with .863 (breaking the mark of .847 set by Ruth in 1920). Bonds continued his torrid home run hitting in the next few seasons, hitting his 660th career home run on April 12, 2004, tying him with his godfather<space/><link><target>Willie Mays</target></link><space/>for third place on the all-time career<space/><link><target>List of top 300 Major League Baseball home run hitters</target><part>home run</part></link><space/>list.

Only three years later Bonds surpassed the great Hank Aaron to become baseball's most prolific home run hitter.</paragraph><paragraph>However, both Bonds' accomplishments in the 2000s have not been without controversy. During his run, journalists questioned McGwire about his use of the steroid-precursor<space/><link><target>androstenedione</target></link>, and in March 2005 was unforthcoming when questioned as part of a Congressional inquiry into steroids.

Some athletes have said that the main advantage to steroids is not so much the additional power or endurance that they can provide, but that they can drastically shorten rehab time from injury.</paragraph><paragraph>Commissioner<space/><link><target>Bud Selig</target></link><space/>imposed a very strict anti-drug policy upon its minor league players, who are not part of the<space/><link><target>Major League Baseball Players Association</target></link><space/>(the PA). Random drug testing, education and treatment, and strict penalties for those caught were the rule of law. Anyone on a Major League team's forty man roster, including 15 minor leaguers that are on that list, were exempt from that program. Some called Selig's move a public relations stunt, or window dressing.</paragraph><paragraph>In a<space/><italics><link><target>Sports Illustrated</target></link></italics><space/>cover story in 2002, a year after his retirement,<space/><link><target>Ken Caminiti</target></link><space/>admitted that he had used steroids during his National League MVP-winning 1996 season, and for several seasons afterwards. Caminiti died unexpectedly of an apparent heart attack in<space/><link><target>The Bronx</target></link><space/>at the age of 41; he was pronounced dead on October 10, 2004 at New York's<space/><link><target>Lincoln Hospital (Bronx, New York)</target><part>Lincoln Memorial Hospital</part></link>. On November 1, the New York City Medical Examiners Office announced that Caminiti died from &quot;acute intoxication due to the combined effects of cocaine and opiates,&quot; but coronary artery disease and cardiac hypertrophy (an enlarged heart) were also contributing factors.</paragraph><paragraph>In 2005,<space/><link><target>Jose Canseco</target></link><space/>published<space/><italics><link><target>Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits &amp; How Baseball Got Big</target></link></italics><space/>admitting steroid usage and claiming that it was prevalent throughout major league baseball. When the United States Congress decided to investigate the use of steroids in the sport, some of the games most prominent players came under scrutiny for possibly using steroids. These include<space/><link><target>Barry Bonds</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Jason Giambi</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Mark McGwire</target></link>. Other players, such as Canseco and<space/><link><target>Gary Sheffield</target></link>, have admitted to have either knowingly (in Canseco's case) or not (Sheffield's) using steroids. In confidential testimony to the<space/><link><target>BALCO</target></link><space/><link><target>Grand Jury</target></link><space/>(that was later leaked to the<space/><italics><link><target>San Francisco Chronicle</target></link></italics>), Giambi also admitted steroid use. He later held a press conference in which he appeared to affirm this admission, without actually saying the words. And after an appearance before Congress where he (unlike McGwire) emphatically denied using steroids, &quot;period,&quot; slugger<space/><link><target>Rafael Palmeiro</target></link><space/>became the first major star to be suspended (10 days) on August 1, 2005 for violating Major League Baseball's newly strengthened ban on controlled substances, including steroids, adopted on August 7, 2002, starting in the 2003 season. Many lesser players (mostly from the minor leagues) have tested positive for use, as well.</paragraph><paragraph>In 2006, the Commissioner of Baseball tasked former United States Senator George J.

Mitchell also advanced certain recommendations regarding the handling of past illegal drug use and future prevention practices. The report names 89 MLB players who are alleged to have used steroids or drugs.</paragraph><paragraph>Baseball has been taken to task for turning a blind eye to its drug problems.

The factors cited are: smaller sized ballparks than in the past, the<space/><link><target>juiced ball theory</target><part>&quot;juiced balls&quot; theory</part></link><space/>claiming that the balls are wound tighter thus travel further following contact with the bat, &quot;watered down pitching&quot; implying that lesser quality pitchers are up in the Major Leagues due to too many teams. Albeit that these factors did play a large role in increasing home run thus scoring totals during this time, others that directly impact ballplayers have an equally important role. As noted earlier one of those factors is anabolic steroids which have the capability of increasing muscle mass, which enables hitters to not only hit &quot;mistake&quot; pitches farther, but it also enables hitters to adjust to &quot;good&quot; pitches such as a well-placed fastball, slider, changeup, or curveball, and hit them for home runs<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">November 2007</arg></template>. Another such factor is better nutrition, as well as training and training facilities/equipment which can work with (or without) steroids to produce a more potent ballplayer and further enhance his skills.</paragraph><paragraph>Routinely in today's baseball age we see players reach 40 and 50 home runs in a season, a feat that even in the 1980s was considered rare. Many modern baseball theorists believe that a new pitch will swing the balance of power back to the pitcher.

The drug gives an undeserving advantage to players and it breaks the social contract of having a fair contest. It has many side effects such as liver abnormalities and other such problems, but the induced power and strength is often more attractive to some users and therefore overrides the temptation to, or not to take the drug. Furthermore, steroids impact baseballs atmosphere because it impacts the ability to compare and contrast players across the ages. 	With steroids, users are able to accomplish many personal strength goals, home runs are much more plentiful, and more superstars are made, however there are also long term consequences that may occur.</paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><paragraph><template><target>Portal</target><arg>Baseball</arg></template></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Timeline of
