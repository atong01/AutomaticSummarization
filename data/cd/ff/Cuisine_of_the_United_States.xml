There had been some Irish from Ulster prior to 1820, however largely they had been Protestants with somewhat different food patterns and (often) a different<space/><link><target>Irish language</target><part>language</part></link><space/>than the explosion of emigrants that came to<space/><link><target>Castle Garden</target></link><space/>and Locust Point in their masses starting in the 1840s.

Irish were the first immigrant group to arrive in this region in massive numbers immigrants also founded some of the earliest saloons and bars in this region, of which<space/><link><target>McSorley's</target></link><space/>is an example. Migrants from Southern Europe, namely<space/><link><target>Sicily</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Campania</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Lazio</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Calabria</target></link>, appeared between 1880-1960 in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Eastern Maryland hoping to escape the extreme poverty and corruption endemic to Italy; typically they were employed in manual labor or factory work but it is because of them that dishes like<space/><link><target>spaghetti with meatballs</target></link>,<space/><link><target>New York style pizza</target></link>,<space/><link><target>calzones</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>baked ziti</target></link><space/>exist, and Americans of today are very familiar with semolina based pasta noodles.</paragraph><paragraph>New York style hot dogs came about with German speaking emigrants from Austria and Germany, particularly with the frankfurter sausage and the smaller wiener sausage. Today the New York style hot dog with<space/><link><target>sauerkraut</target></link>, mustard, and the optional cucumber pickle relish is such a part of the local fabric that it is one of the favorite comestibles of New York City. Hot dogs are a typical street food sold year round in all by the most inclement weather from thousands of pushcarts. As with all other stadiums in Major League Baseball they are an essential for<space/><link><target>New York Yankees</target></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>New York Mets</target></link><space/>games though it is the local style of preparation that predominates without exception. Hot dogs are also the focus of a televised eating contest on the Fourth of July in Coney Island, at<space/><link><target>Nathan's Famous</target></link>, one of the earliest hot dog stands opened in the United States in 1916.<space/><link><target>File:Nathan 2006 Kobayashi.jpg</target><part>thumbnail</part><part>When hotdogs first arrived in America in the late 19th century, they were considered German food.

Most often they were completely unable to partake in the outdoor food markets that the general population utilized as most of the food for sale was not kosher. The influence of European Jewry before their destruction in the<space/><link><target>Shoah</target><part>Holocaust</part></link><space/>on modern mid Atlantic cooking remains extremely strong and reinforced by their many descendants in the region. American-style<space/><link><target>dill pickle</target><part>pickles</part></link><space/>were brought by Polish Jews, now a common addition to hamburgers and sandwiches, and Hungarian Jews brought a recipe for almond horns that now is a common regional cookie, diverting from the original recipe in dipping the ends in dark chocolate. True<space/><link><target>New York-style cheesecake</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>have copious amounts of cream and eggs in them because<space/><link><target>animal rennet</target></link><space/>is not kosher and thus could not be sold to about half the deli's clientele.

Whitefish salad,<space/><link><target>smoked salmon</target><part>lox</part></link>, and<space/><link><target>matzoh ball soup</target></link><space/>are now standard fare made to order at local diners and delicatessens, but started their life as foods that made up a strict dietary code.</paragraph><paragraph>Like other groups before them, many of their dishes passed into the mainstream enough so that they became part of diner fare by the end of the 20th century, a type of restaurant that is now more numerous in this region than any other and formerly the subject matter of artist<space/><link><target>Edward Hopper</target></link>. In the past this sort of establishment was the haven of the short order cook grilling or frying simple foods for the working man.

As with the American South, pawpaws are the region's largest native fruit, about the size of a mango, and are often found growing wild in the region come September, whereafter they are made into preserves and cakes and command quite a price at farmer's markets in Chicago. The American persimmon is often smaller than it is Japanese cousin, about the size of a small plum, but in the Midwest and portions of the East it is the main ingredient in a steamed pudding called<space/><link><target>persimmon pudding</target></link>, topped with crme anglaise. Other crops inherited from the Native Americans include<space/><link><target>wild rice</target></link>, which grows on the banks of lakes and is a local favorite for fancy meals.</paragraph><paragraph>Typical fruits of the region are cold weather crops.

Specific influences from Europe were quite varied, and remain traditional and essential to the modern cookery overall. To the upper portion of the South, French Huguenots brought the concept of making rouxs to make sauces and soups, and later French settlers hunted for frogs in the swamps to make<space/><link><target>frog's legs</target></link>. German speakers often settled in Appalachia on small farms or in the backcountry away from the coast, and invented an American breakfast delicacy that is now nationally beloved,<space/><link><target>apple butter</target></link>, based on their recipe for apfelkraut, and later introduced<space/><link><target>red cabbage</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>rye</target></link>.

American style sponge cakes tend to be the rule rather than the exception as is American style buttercream, a place where Southern baking intersects with the rest of the United States. Nuts like pecan and hickory tend to be revered as garnishes for these desserts, and make their way into local bakeries as fillings for chocolates.</paragraph><paragraph>In the parts of the South which face the Atlantic Ocean, French influences often were dictated by where French Huguenots settled, however it is Louisiana that got the lion's share of older French cooking methods from Poitou and Normandy via Nova Scotia, most of which are foodways that pre-date the codification of haute cuisine during the reign of<space/><link><target>Louis XIV of France</target><part>Louis XIV</part></link><space/>and have more in common with rustic cuisines of the 17th and 18th century than anything ever found at the French court in Versailles or the bistros of 19th and 20th century Paris; this is especially true of Cajun cuisine. Louisiana is a state named for Louis XIV and to this day<space/><link><target>Cajun French</target><part>French</part></link><space/>is still a commonly spoken tongue in the areas south of<space/><link><target>New Orleans</target></link>. The Cajuns and their dialect have occupied Southern Louisiana since the 1700s owing to<space/><italics>Le Grande Drangement</italics>, an event in which they were forcibly evicted by the English Crown from their lands in Canada and made to occupy more marginal lands on the bayou. Cajun French is more closely related to dialects spoken in<space/><link><target>Northern Maine</target></link>,<space/><link><target>New Brunswick, Canada</target><part>New Brunswick</part></link>, and to a lesser degree<space/><link><target>Haiti</target></link><space/>than anything spoken in modern France, and likewise their terminology, methodology, and culture concerning food is much more closely related to the styles of these former French colonies even today. Unlike other areas of the South, Cajuns were and still are largely Catholics and thus much of what they eat is seasonal; for example pork is an important component of the Cajun<space/><italics>boucherie</italics><space/>(a large community event where the hog is butchered, prepared with a fiery spice mix, and eaten snout to tail) but it is never consumed in the five weeks of Lent, when such would be forbidden. Cajun cuisine tends to focus on what is locally available, historically because Cajuns were often poorer independent farmers and not plantation owners but today it is because such is deeply imbedded in local culture.<space/><link><target>Boudin</target></link><space/>is a type of sausage found only in this area of the country, and it is often by far more spicy than anything found in France or Belgium.<space/><link><target>Chaudin</target></link><space/>is unique to the area, and the method of cooking is comparable to the Scottish dish haggis: the stuffing includes onions, rice, bell peppers, spices, and pork sewn up in the stomach of a pig, and served in slices piping hot. Crayfish are a staple of the Cajun grandmother's cookpot, as are<space/><link><target>blue crab</target><trail>s</trail></link>,<space/><link><target>shrimp</target></link>, corn on the cob, and red potatoes, since these are the basic ingredients of the Louisiana crawfish boil.</paragraph><paragraph>Since the end of the<space/><link><target>American Civil War</target><part>Civil War</part></link>, New Orleans has had a thriving fine dining scene that predates the much younger 20th century metropoli of<space/><link><target>Atlanta</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Miami</target></link>. It was here that cocktails like the<space/><link><target>sazerac</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>hurricane (cocktail)</target><part>hurricane</part></link><space/>were invented as well as the liqueur<space/><link><target>Southern Comfort</target></link>. New Orleans has been the capital of Creole culture since before Louisiana was a state; this culture was and still is quite distinct from the rural culture of Cajuns and dovetails with what would have been eaten in antebellum Louisiana plantation culture long ago. Cooking to impress and show one's wealth was a staple of Creole culture, which often mixed Spanish, Italian, French, and African methods, producing rich dishes like<space/><link><target>Oysters Bienville</target><part>oysters bienville</part></link>,<space/><link><target>pompano en papillote</target></link>, and even the<space/><link><target>muffaletta</target></link><space/>sandwich, but it tends to diverge from the original ideas brought to the region in ingredients:<space/><link><target>profiterole</target><trail>s</trail></link>, for example, use a near identical<space/><link><target>choux pastry</target></link><space/>to that which is found in modern Paris but often use vanilla or chocolate ice cream rather than custard as the filling,<space/><link><target>praline</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>nearly always use<space/><link><target>pecan</target></link><space/>and not almonds, and<space/><link><target>bananas foster</target></link><space/>came about when New Orleans was a key port for the import of bananas from the Caribbean Sea<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.neworleansonline.com/neworleans/cuisine/traditionalfoods/bananasfoster.html</arg><arg name="title">Bananas Foster</arg><arg name="publisher">Neworleansonline.com</arg><arg name="accessdate">16 January 2015</arg></template></extension><space/>Gumbos tend to be thickened using the gooey innards of<space/><link><target>okra</target></link>, something an African cook would be familiar with, whereas Cajuns would be more likely to use the leaves of the<space/><link><target>sassafras albidum</target><part>sassafrass tree</part></link><space/>and neither of them ever used the andouille currently known in France, since French andouille uses tripe whereas Louisiana andouille is made from a<space/><link><target>Boston butt</target></link>, usually inflected with pepper flakes, and smoked for hours over pecan wood.

Norman Van Aken embraced a Floridian type cuisine fused with many ethnic and globalized elements in his<space/><italics>Feast of Sunlight</italics><space/>cookbook in 1988. The movement finally gained fame around the world when California became swept up in the movement, then seemingly started to lead the trend itself, in, for example, the popular restaurant<space/><link><target>Chez Panisse</target></link><space/>in Berkeley. Examples of the Chez Panisse phenomenon, chefs who embraced a new globalized cuisine, were celebrity chefs like Jeremiah Tower and<space/><link><target>Wolfgang Puck</target></link>, both former colleagues at the restaurant.
