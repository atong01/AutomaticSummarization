'''Boron nitride''' is a [[chemical compound]] with [[chemical formula]] '''BN''', consisting of equal numbers of [[boron]] and [[nitrogen]] atoms. BN is [[isoelectronic]] to a similarly structured [[carbon]] lattice and thus exists in various [[Polymorphism (materials science)|crystalline forms]]. The [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal form]] corresponding to [[graphite]] is the most stable and softest among BN polymorphs, and is therefore used as a lubricant and an additive to cosmetic products. The cubic ([[Zincblende (crystal structure)#Zincblende structure|sphalerite structure]]) variety analogous to [[diamond]] is called c-BN.  Its hardness is inferior only to diamond, but its thermal and chemical stability is superior. The rare [[Wurtzite crystal structure|wurtzite]] BN modification is similar to [[lonsdaleite]] and may even be harder than the cubic form.

Because of excellent thermal and chemical stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used as parts of high-temperature equipment. Boron nitride has potential use in nanotechnology. Nanotubes of BN can be produced that have a structure similar to that of [[carbon nanotube]]s, i.e. graphene (or BN) sheets rolled on themselves, but the properties are very different.

==Structure==
Boron nitride has been produced in amorphous (a-BN) and crystalline forms. The most stable crystalline form is the hexagonal one, also called h-BN, α-BN, or g-BN (graphitic BN). Hexagonal boron nitride (point group = D<sub>6h</sub>; space group = P6<sub>3</sub>/mmc) has a layered structure similar to graphite. Within each layer, boron and nitrogen atoms are bound by strong [[covalent bond]]s, whereas the layers are held together by weak [[van der Waals force]]s. The interlayer "registry" of these sheets differs, however, from the pattern seen for graphite, because the atoms are eclipsed, with boron atoms lying over and above nitrogen atoms. This registry reflects the polarity of the B-N bonds. Still, h-BN and graphite are very close neighbors and even the BC<sub>6</sub>N hybrids have been synthesized where carbon substitutes for some B and N atoms.<ref>{{cite journal | author = M. Kawaguchi | title = Electronic Structure and Intercalation Chemistry of Graphite-Like Layered Material with a Composition of BC6N | journal = Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids | volume = 69 | year = 2008 | page = 1171 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpcs.2007.10.076 |issue = 5–6 |bibcode = 2008JPCS...69.1171K |display-authors=etal}}</ref>

As diamond is less stable than graphite, cubic BN is less stable than h-BN, but the conversion rate between those forms is negligible at room temperature (again like diamond). The cubic form has the sphalerite crystal structure, the same as that of diamond, and is also called β-BN or c-BN. The [[Wurtzite crystal structure|wurtzite]] BN form (w-BN; point group = C<sub>6v</sub>; space group = P6<sub>3</sub>mc) has the same structure as [[lonsdaleite]], a rare hexagonal polymorph of carbon.  In both c-BN and w-BN, the boron and nitrogen atoms are grouped into [[tetrahedra]], but the angles between neighboring tetrahedra differ between the two.<ref>{{cite book | author = M. S.

The partly [[ionic bond|ionic]] structure of BN layers in h-BN reduces covalency and electrical conductivity, whereas the interlayer interaction increases resulting in higher hardness of h-BN relative to graphite. The reduced electron-delocalization in hexagonal-BN is also indicated by its absence of color and a large [[band gap]]. Very different bonding – strong covalent within the [[basal plane]]s (planes where boron and nitrogen atoms are covalently bonded) and weak between them – causes high [[anisotropy]] of most properties of h-BN.

For example, the hardness, electrical and thermal conductivity are much higher within the planes than perpendicular to them. On the contrary, the properties of c-BN and w-BN are more homogeneous and isotropic.

Those materials are extremely hard, with the hardness of bulk c-BN being slightly smaller and w-BN even higher than that of diamond.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Z.

===Thermal stability===
Hexagonal and cubic (and probably w-BN) BN show remarkable chemical and thermal stabilities. For example, h-BN is stable to decomposition at temperatures up to 1000&nbsp;°C in air, 1400&nbsp;°C in vacuum, and 2800&nbsp;°C in an inert atmosphere. The reactivity of h-BN and c-BN is relatively similar, and the data for c-BN are summarized in the table below.

Thermal stability of c-BN can be summarized as follows:<ref name=BN/>
*In air or oxygen: B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> protective layer prevents further oxidation to ~1300&nbsp;°C; no conversion to hexagonal form at 1400&nbsp;°C.
*In nitrogen: some conversion to h-BN at 1525&nbsp;°C after 12&nbsp;h.
*In vacuum ({{val|e=-5|u=Pa}}): conversion to h-BN at 1550–1600&nbsp;°C.

===Chemical stability===
Boron nitride is insoluble in the usual acids, but is soluble in alkaline molten salts and nitrides, such as [[Lithium hydroxide|LiOH]], [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]], [[Sodium hydroxide|NaOH]]-[[Sodium carbonate|Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>]], [[Sodium nitrate|NaNO<sub>3</sub>]], [[Lithium nitride|Li<sub>3</sub>N]], [[Magnesium nitride|Mg<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>]], [[Strontium nitride|Sr<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>]], [[Barium nitride|Ba<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>]] or [[Lithium boron nitride|Li<sub>3</sub>BN<sub>2</sub>]], which are therefore used to etch BN.<ref name=BN/>

===Thermal conductivity===
The theoretical thermal conductivity of hexagonal Boron nitride nanoribbons (BNNRs) can approach 1700–2000 W/(m·K), which has the same order of magnitude as the experimental measured value for [[graphene]], and can be comparable to the theoretical calculations for graphene nanoribbons.<ref>{{cite journal | author = J.

In 2009, a naturally occurring boron nitride mineral (proposed name [[qingsongite]]) was reported in Tibet. The substance was found in dispersed [[micron]]-sized inclusions of qingsongite (c-BN) in chromium-rich rocks in [[Tibet]]. In 2013, the International Mineralogical Association affirmed the mineral and the name.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dobrzhinetskaya|first1=L.F.|last2=Wirth|first2=R.|last3=Yang|first3=J.|last4=Green, H.W., Hutcheon, I.D., Weber, P.K. and Grew, E.S.|year=2013|title=Qingsongite, IMA

==Synthesis==

===Preparation and reactivity of hexagonal BN===
Boron nitride is produced synthetically. Hexagonal boron nitride is obtained by the reacting boron trioxide (B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) or boric acid (B(OH)<sub>3</sub>) with [[ammonia]] (NH<sub>3</sub>) or [[urea]] (CO(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) in a nitrogen atmosphere:<ref name=prod>{{cite journal | author = S.

:B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 2 NH<sub>3</sub> → 2 BN + 3 H<sub>2</sub>O (T = 900&nbsp;°C)

The resulting disordered ([[amorphous]]) boron nitride contains 92–95% BN and 5–8% B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The remaining B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> can be evaporated in a second step at temperatures {{nowrap|> 1500 °C}} in order to achieve BN concentration >98%.

===Preparation of cubic BN===
Synthesis of c-BN uses same methods as that of diamond: Cubic boron nitride is produced by treating hexagonal boron nitride at high pressure and temperature, much as [[synthetic diamond]] is produced from graphite. Direct conversion of hexagonal boron nitride to the cubic form has been observed at pressures between 5 and 18&nbsp;GPa and temperatures between 1730 and 3230&nbsp;°C, that is similar parameters as for direct graphite-diamond conversion.<ref name=wentorf>{{cite journal | author = R.

Low-pressure deposition of thin films of cubic boron nitride is possible. As in diamond growth, the major problem is to suppress the growth of hexagonal phases (h-BN or graphite, respectively). Whereas in diamond growth this is achieved by adding hydrogen gas, [[boron trifluoride]] is used for c-BN. [[Ion beam deposition]], [[plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition]], [[pulsed laser deposition]], [[Sputter deposition|reactive sputtering]], and other [[physical vapor deposition]] methods are used as well.<ref name=cvd/>

===Preparation of wurtzite BN===
Wurtzite BN can be obtained via static high-pressure or dynamic shock methods.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Characterization of Wurtzite Type Boron Nitride Synthesized by Shock Compression | author = T.

Both c-BN and w-BN are formed by compressing h-BN, but formation of w-BN occurs at much lower temperatures close to 1700&nbsp;°C.<ref name=vel/>

===Production statistics===
Whereas the production and consumption figures for the raw materials used for BN synthesis, namely boric acid and boron trioxide, are well known (see [[boron]]), the corresponding numbers for the boron nitride are not listed in statistical reports. An estimate for the 1999 world production is 300 to 350 metric tons. The major producers and consumers of BN are located in the United States, Japan, China and Germany. In 2000, prices varied from about $75/kg to $120/kg for standard industrial-quality h-BN and were about up to $200–$400/kg for high purity BN grades.<ref name=prod/>

==Applications==

===Hexagonal BN===
[[Image:BNcrucible.jpg|thumb|right|Ceramic BN crucible]]
Hexagonal BN (h-BN) is the most widely used polymorph. It is a good lubricant at both low and high temperatures (up to 900&nbsp;°C, even in an oxidizing atmosphere). h-BN lubricant is particularly useful when the electrical conductivity or chemical reactivity of graphite (alternative lubricant) would be problematic. Another advantage of h-BN over graphite is that its lubricity does not require water or gas molecules trapped between the layers. Therefore, h-BN lubricants can be used even in vacuum, e.g. in space applications. The lubricating properties of fine-grained h-BN are used in [[cosmetics]], [[paint]]s, [[dental cement]]s, and [[pencil]] leads.<ref name=b1>{{cite book | author = Jochen Greim, Karl A. Schwetz | chapter = Boron Carbide, Boron Nitride, and Metal Borides | title = Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry | publisher = Wiley-VCH | location = Weinheim | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a04_295.pub2 }}</ref>

Hexagonal BN was first used in cosmetics around 1940 in [[Japan]]. However, because of its high price, h-BN was soon abandoned for this application. Its use was revitalized in the late 1990s with the optimization h-BN production processes, and currently h-BN is used by nearly all leading producers of cosmetic products for [[Foundation (cosmetics)|foundations]], [[make-up]], [[eye shadow]]s, blushers, [[eye liner|kohl pencils]], [[lipstick]]s and other skincare products.<ref name=dkg/>

Because of its excellent thermal and chemical stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used as parts of high-temperature equipment. h-BN can be included in ceramics, alloys, resins, plastics, rubbers, and other materials, giving them self-lubricating properties. Such materials are suitable for construction of e.g. [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]] and in steelmaking.<ref name=dkg/> Plastics filled with BN have less thermal expansion as well as higher thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity. Due to its excellent dielectric and thermal properties, BN is used in electronics e.g. as a substrate for semiconductors, microwave-transparent windows, and as a structural material for seals.<ref>{{cite journal | author = R.F. Davis | title = III-V Nitrides for Electronic and Optoelectronic Applications | journal = Proceedings of the IEEE | year = 1991 | volume= 79 | pages = 702–712 | doi = 10.1109/5.90133 | issue= 5 }}</ref>

Hexagonal BN is used in [[Xerography|xerographic process]] and [[laser printer]]s as a charge leakage barrier layer of the photo drum.<ref>{{cite book | author = L. B. Schein | title = Electrophotography and Development Physics | series = Springer Series in Electrophysics | volume = 14 |publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = Berlin | year = 1988 | isbn = 9780387189024 }}</ref> In the automotive industry, h-BN mixed with a binder (boron oxide) is used for sealing [[oxygen sensor]]s, which provide feedback for adjusting fuel flow. The binder utilizes the unique temperature stability and insulating properties of h-BN.<ref name=dkg/>

Parts can be made of h-BN by [[hot pressing]]. Momentive Performance Materials <ref>http://www.momentive.com/Products/Main.aspx?id=22867</ref> produces four grades of h-BN shapes. Grade HBN, with boron oxide [[binder (material)|binder]], usable to 550–850&nbsp;°C in oxidizing atmosphere and up to 1600&nbsp;°C in vacuum, but due to the boron oxide content is sensitive to water. Grade HBR uses [[calcium borate]] binder and is usable at 1600&nbsp;°C. Grades HBC and HBT use no binder and can be used to 3000&nbsp;°C.<ref>{{cite book | author = Charles A. Harper | title = Handbook of Ceramics, Glasses and Diamonds | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 2001 | isbn = 007026712X }}</ref>

Two-dimensional hBN (monolayer thick sheets) has been shown to be an excellent proton conductor, yielding unexpectedly high proton transport rates.<ref>{{cite journal | author = S. Hu et. al. | title = Proton transport through one-atom-thick crystals | journal = Nature Letters | year = 2014 | volume = 516 | pages = 227–230 | doi = 10.1038/nature14015|arxiv = 1410.8724 |bibcode = 2014Natur.516..227H }}</ref>  This high proton transport rate, combined with the high electrical resistance of h-BN, may lead to important advances in research such as [[Fuel Cells]] and [[Water Electrolysis.]]

h-BN has recently{{when|date=May 2015}} started to be used as a bullet lubricant as an alternative to [[Molybdenum disulfide]] commonly referred to as "moly coating". It is claimed to increase barrel life.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Cubic boron nitride===
Cubic boron nitride (CBN or c-BN) is widely used as an [[abrasive]].<ref name="mprg">{{Cite book | author = Robert H. Todd, Dell K. Allen and Leo Alting | year = 1994 | title = Manufacturing Processes Reference Guide | publisher = Industrial Press Inc. | pages = 43–48 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=6x1smAf_PAcC | isbn = 0-8311-3049-0 }}</ref> Its usefulness arises from its insolubility in [[iron]], [[nickel]], and related [[alloy]]s at high temperatures, whereas diamond is soluble in these metals to give carbides. Polycrystalline c-BN (PCBN) abrasives are therefore used for machining steel, whereas diamond abrasives are preferred for aluminum alloys, ceramics, and stone. When in contact with oxygen at high temperatures, BN forms a passivation layer of boron oxide. Boron nitride binds well with metals, due to formation of interlayers of metal borides or nitrides. Materials with cubic boron nitride crystals are often used in the [[tool bit]]s of [[cutting tool]]s. For grinding applications, softer binders, e.g. resin, porous ceramics, and soft metals, are used. Ceramic binders can be used as well. Commercial products are known under names "[[Borazon]]" (by Diamond Innovations), and "Elbor" or "Cubonite" (by Russian vendors). Similar to diamond, the combination in c-BN of highest thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity is ideal for heat spreaders. Contrary to diamond, large c-BN pellets can be produced in a simple process (called sintering) of annealing c-BN powders in nitrogen flow at temperatures slightly below the BN decomposition temperature. This ability of c-BN and h-BN powders to fuse allows cheap production of large BN parts.<ref name=b1/>

As cubic boron nitride consists of light atoms and is very robust chemically and mechanically, it is one of the popular materials for X-ray membranes: low mass results in small X-ray absorption, and good mechanical properties allow usage of thin membranes, thus further reducing the absorption.<ref>{{cite journal | author = M. A. El Khakani and M. Chaker | title = Physical Properties of the X-Ray Membrane Materials | journal = Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology B | volume = 11 | pages = 2930–2937 | year = 1993 | doi = 10.1116/1.586563 | issue = 6 |bibcode = 1993JVSTB..11.2930E }}</ref>

===Amorphous boron nitride===
Layers of amorphous boron nitride (a-BN) are used in some [[semiconductor device]]s, e.g. [[MISFET]]s. They can be prepared by chemical decomposition of [[trichloroborazine]] with [[caesium]], or by thermal chemical vapor deposition methods. Thermal CVD can be also used for deposition of h-BN layers, or at high temperatures, c-BN.<ref>{{cite journal | author = W.

Like BN fibers, boron nitride nanotubes show promise for aerospace applications where integration of boron and in particular the light isotope of boron (<sup>10</sup>B) into structural materials improves both their strength and their radiation-shielding properties; the improvement is due to strong neutron absorption by <sup>10</sup>B.

===Composites containing BN===
Addition of boron nitride to [[silicon nitride]] ceramics improves the [[thermal shock]] resistance of the resulting material. For the same purpose, BN is added also to silicon nitride-[[alumina]] and [[titanium nitride]]-alumina ceramics. Other materials being reinforced with BN include alumina and [[zirconia]], [[borosilicate glass]]es, [[glass ceramic]]s, [[vitreous enamel|enamels]], and composite ceramics with [[titanium boride]]-boron nitride, titanium boride-[[aluminium nitride]]-boron nitride, and [[silicon carbide]]-boron nitride composition.<ref>{{cite book | title = Handbook of Composite Reinforcements | author = S.

Hexagonal boron nitride is also used as an [[electrical insulator]] for the development of novel [[van der Waals heterostructures]].

==Health issues==
Boron nitride (along with Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, NbN, and BNC) is reported to show weak [[fibrogenic]] activity and cause [[pneumoconiosis]]. The maximum concentration recommended for nitrides of nonmetals is 10&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup> for BN and 4 for AlN or ZrN.<ref name=BN/>
