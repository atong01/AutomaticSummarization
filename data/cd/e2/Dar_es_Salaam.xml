The name is commonly translated as &quot;abode/home of peace&quot;, based on the Arabic<space/><italics>dar</italics><space/>(&quot;house&quot;), and the Arabic<space/><italics>es salaam</italics><space/>(&quot;of peace&quot;).<extension extension_name='ref' name="Brennan"></extension><space/>Dar es Salaam fell into decline after Majid's death in 1870, but was revived in 1887 when the<space/><link><target>German East Africa Company</target></link><space/>established a station there. The town's growth was facilitated by its role as the administrative and commercial centre of<space/><link><target>German East Africa</target></link><space/>and industrial expansion resulting from the construction of the Central Railway Line in the early 1900s.</paragraph><paragraph>German East Africa was captured by the British during<space/><link><target>World War I</target></link><space/>and became<space/><link><target>Tanganyika</target></link>, with Dar es Salaam the administrative and commercial centre.

Dar es Salaam continued to serve as its capital, even when in 1964 Tanganyika and<space/><link><target>Zanzibar</target></link><space/>merged to form Tanzania. In 1973, however, provisions were made to relocate the capital to<space/><link><target>Dodoma</target></link>, a more centrally located city in the interior. The relocation process has not yet been completed, and Dar es Salaam remains Tanzania's primary city.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1967, the Tanzanian government declared the infamous<space/><italics>Ujamaa policy</italics>, that set Tanzania into a socialist path. The move slowed down the potential growth of the city as the government encouraged people not to move in cities but stay in Ujamaa socialist villages. But by 1980's the Ujamaa policy proved to be a failure into combating increasing poverty, hunger, and delayed development that Tanzania faced. This led to the 1980s liberalization policy that virtually ended socialism and its spirit within the Tanzania's government. The move led to increasing migration of rural dwellers from rural areas into cities with Dar es Salaam becoming the leading city in receiving migrants from rural areas.<extension extension_name='ref' name="allafrica.com"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://allafrica.com/stories/201308060352.html</arg><arg name="title">allAfrica.com: Tanzania: Construction Booms As Public, Private Sector Investments Soar</arg><arg name="work">allAfrica.com</arg><arg name="accessdate">25 May 2015</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Until the late 1990s, Dar es Salaam was not put into same category as Africa's leading cities like Nairobi, Johannesburg, Lagos, or Addis Ababa.
