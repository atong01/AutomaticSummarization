It is extremely probable that barytes, which we have just now arranged with earths, is in this situation; for in many experiments it exhibits properties nearly approaching to those of metallic bodies. It is even possible that all the substances we call earths may be only metallic oxyds, irreducible by any hitherto known process.&quot; from<space/><link type='external' href='https://books.google.com/books?id=adYKAAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA218#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false'>page 218</link><space/>of: Lavoisier with Robert Kerr, trans.,<space/><italics>Elements of Chemistry</italics>, ..., 4th ed.

In the philosophy class he came under the tutelage of<space/><link><target>Abb Nicolas Louis de Lacaille</target></link>, a distinguished mathematician and observational astronomer who imbued the young Lavoisier with an interest in meteorological observation, an enthusiasm which never left him. Lavoisier entered the school of law, where he received a bachelor's degree in 1763 and a licentiate in 1764. Lavoisier received a<space/><link><target>law degree</target></link><space/>and was admitted to the<space/><link><target>bar association</target><part>bar</part></link>, but never practiced as a lawyer.

He published an account of this review in 1774 in a book entitled<space/><italics>Opuscules physiques et chimiques</italics><space/>(Physical and Chemical Essays). In the course of this review he made his first full study of the work of<space/><link><target>Joseph Black</target></link>, the Scottish chemist who had carried out a series of classic quantitative experiments on the mild and caustic alkalies. Black had shown that the difference between a mild alkali, for example,<space/><link><target>chalk</target></link><space/>(<link><target>calcium carbonate</target><part>CaCO<xhtml:sub>3</xhtml:sub></part></link>), and the caustic form, for example,<space/><link><target>quicklime</target></link><space/>(<link><target>calcium oxide</target><part>CaO</part></link>), lay in the fact that the former contained &quot;fixed air,&quot; not common air fixed in the chalk, but a distinct chemical species, now understood to be<space/><link><target>carbon dioxide</target></link><space/>(CO<xhtml:sub>2</xhtml:sub>), which was a constituent of the atmosphere. Lavoisier recognized that Black's fixed air was identical with the air evolved when metal calces were reduced with the charcoal and even suggested that the air which combined with metals on calcination and increased the weight might be Black's fixed air, that is, CO<xhtml:sub>2</xhtml:sub>.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Joseph Priestley</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Priestley.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part><link><target>Joseph Priestley</target></link>, an English chemist known for isolating<space/><link><target>oxygen</target></link>, which he termed &quot;dephlogisticated air.&quot;</part></link>In the spring of 1774 Lavoisier carried out experiments on the calcination of tin and lead in sealed vessels which conclusively confirmed that the increase in weight of metals in combustion was due to combination with air. But the question remained about whether it was combination with common atmospheric air or with only a part of atmospheric air. In October the English chemist<space/><link><target>Joseph Priestley</target></link><space/>visited Paris, where he met Lavoisier and told him of the air which he had produced by heating the<space/><link><target>red calx</target></link><space/>of mercury with a burning glass and which had supported combustion with extreme vigor. Priestley at this time was unsure of the nature of this gas, but he felt that it was an especially pure form of common air. Lavoisier carried out his own researches on this peculiar substance. The result was his famous memoir<space/><italics>On the Nature of the Principle Which Combines with Metals during Their Calcination and Increases Their Weight</italics>, read to the Academy on 26 April 1775 (commonly referred to as the Easter Memoir). In the original memoir Lavoisier showed that the mercury calx was a true metallic calx in that it could be reduced with<space/><link><target>charcoal</target></link>, giving off Black's fixed air in the process.<extension extension_name='ref' name="in French"><link type='external' href='http://www.lavoisier.cnrs.fr/ice/ice_page_detail.php?lang=fr&amp;amp;type=text&amp;amp;bdd=lavosier&amp;amp;table=Lavoisier&amp;amp;bookId=26&amp;amp;typeofbookDes=Memoires&amp;amp;pageOrder=1&amp;amp;facsimile=off&amp;amp;search=no'>in French</link><space/>and<space/><link type='external' href='http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/lavoisier1.html'>Memoir on Combustion in General</link><space/>(English translation)</extension><space/>When reduced without charcoal, it gave off an air which supported respiration and combustion in an enhanced way. He concluded that this was just a pure form of common air, and that it was the air itself &quot;undivided, without alteration, without decomposition&quot; which combined with metals on calcination.</paragraph><paragraph>After returning from Paris, Priestley took up once again his investigation of the air from mercury calx. His results now showed that this air was not just an especially pure form of common air but was &quot;five or six times better than common air, for the purpose of respiration, inflammation, and ... every other use of common air.&quot; He called the air dephlogisticated air, as he thought it was common air deprived of its phlogiston. Since it was therefore in a state to absorb a much greater quantity of phlogiston given off by burning bodies and respiring animals, the greatly enhanced combustion of substances and the greater ease of breathing in this air were explained.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Easter memoir</heading><paragraph>The &quot;official&quot; version of Lavoisier's Easter Memoir appeared in 1778. In the intervening period Lavoisier had ample time to repeat some of Priestley's latest experiments and perform some new ones of his own. In addition to studying Priestley's dephlogisticated air, he studied more thoroughly the residual air after metals had been calcined. He showed that this residual air supported neither combustion nor respiration and that approximately five volumes of this air added to one volume of the dephlogisticated air gave common atmospheric air. Common air was then a mixture of two distinct chemical species with quite different properties. Thus when the revised version of the Easter Memoir was published in 1778, Lavoisier no longer stated that the principle which combined with metals on calcination was just common air but &quot;nothing else than the healthiest and purest part of the air&quot; or the &quot;eminently respirable part of the air.&quot; In the following year Lavoisier coined the name oxygen for this constituent of the air, from the Greek words meaning &quot;acid former.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="in French"></extension><space/>and<space/><italics>&quot;Considrations gnrales sur la nature des acides&quot;</italics><space/>(&quot;General Considerations on the Nature of Acids,&quot; 1778),<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.lavoisier.cnrs.fr/ice/ice_page_detail.php?lang=fr&amp;amp;type=text&amp;amp;bdd=lavosier&amp;amp;table=Lavoisier&amp;amp;bookId=31&amp;amp;typeofbookDes=&amp;amp;pageOrder=1&amp;amp;facsimile=off&amp;amp;search=no'>in French</link></extension><space/>He was struck by the fact that the combustion products of such nonmetals as sulfur, phosphorus, charcoal, and nitrogen were acidic. He held that all acids contained oxygen and that oxygen was therefore the acidifying principle.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Dismantling phlogiston theory</heading><paragraph>Lavoisier's chemical research between 1772 and 1778 was largely concerned with developing his own new theory of combustion. In 1783 he read to the academy his famous paper entitled<space/><italics>Rflexions sur le phlogistique</italics><space/>(Reflections on Phlogiston), a full-scale attack on the current<space/><link><target>phlogiston theory</target></link><space/>of combustion. That year Lavoisier also began a series of experiments on the composition of water which were to prove an important capstone to his combustion theory and win many converts to it. Many investigators had been experimenting with the combination of<space/><link><target>Henry Cavendish</target></link>'s inflammable air, which Lavoisier termed<space/><link><target>hydrogen</target></link><space/>(<link><target>Ancient Greek</target><part>Greek</part></link><space/>for &quot;water-former&quot;), with dephlogisticated air (oxygen) by electrically sparking mixtures of the gases. All of the researchers noted the production of water, but all interpreted the reaction in varying ways within the framework of the phlogiston theory. In cooperation with mathematician<space/><link><target>Pierre-Simon Laplace</target><part>Pierre Simon de Laplace</part></link>, Lavoisier synthesized water by burning jets of hydrogen and oxygen in a bell jar over mercury. The quantitative results were good enough to support the contention that water was not an element, as had been thought for over 2,000 years, but a compound of two gases, hydrogen and oxygen.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Gunpowder Commission</heading><paragraph>Lavoisier's researches on combustion were carried out in the midst of a very busy schedule of public and private duties, especially in connection with the<space/><italics>Ferme gnrale</italics>. There were also innumerable reports for and committees of the Academy of Sciences to investigate specific problems on order of the royal government. Lavoisier, whose organizing skills were outstanding, frequently landed the task of writing up such official reports. In 1775 he was made one of four commissioners of gunpowder appointed to replace a private company, similar to the Ferme gnrale, which had proved unsatisfactory in supplying France with its munitions requirements. As a result of his efforts, both the quantity and quality of French<space/><link><target>gunpowder</target></link><space/>greatly improved, and it became a source of revenue for the government. His appointment to the Gunpowder Commission brought one great benefit to Lavoisier's scientific career as well. As a commissioner, he enjoyed both a house and a laboratory in the Royal Arsenal. Here he lived and worked between 1775 and 1792.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Pioneer of stoichiometry</heading><paragraph>Lavoisier's researches included some of the first truly<space/><link><target>stoichiometry</target><part>quantitative chemical experiments</part></link>. He carefully weighed the reactants and products of a chemical reaction in a sealed glass vessel so that no<space/><link><target>gas</target><trail>es</trail></link><space/>could escape, which was a crucial step in the advancement of chemistry.<extension extension_name='ref'>Petrucci R.H., Harwood W.S. and Herring F.G.,<space/><italics>General Chemistry</italics><space/>(8th ed.

Thus, for instance, if a piece of wood is burned to ashes, the total mass remains unchanged if gaseous reactants and products are included. Lavoisier's experiments supported the law of<space/><link><target>conservation of mass</target></link>. In France it is taught as Lavoisier's Law and is paraphrased from a statement in his &quot;<link><target>Trait lmentaire de Chimie</target></link>&quot; to<space/><italics>&quot;Rien ne se perd, rien ne se cre, tout se transforme.&quot;</italics><space/>(<italics>&quot;Nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed.&quot;</italics>).<space/><link><target>Mikhail Lomonosov</target></link><space/>(17111765) had previously expressed similar ideas in 1748 and proved them in experiments; others whose ideas pre-date the work of Lavoisier include<space/><link><target>Jean Rey (physician)</target><part>Jean Rey</part></link><space/>(15831645),<space/><link><target>Joseph Black</target></link><space/>(17281799), and<space/><link><target>Henry Cavendish</target></link><space/>(17311810).

The new system was tied inextricably to Lavoisier's new oxygen theory of chemistry. The<space/><link><target>Classical elements</target></link><space/>of earth, air, fire, and water were discarded, and instead some 55 substances which could not be decomposed into simpler substances by any known chemical means were provisionally listed as elements. The elements included light;<space/><link><target>caloric theory</target><part>caloric</part></link><space/>(matter of heat); the principles of oxygen, hydrogen, and azote (<link><target>nitrogen</target></link>); carbon; sulfur; phosphorus; the yet unknown &quot;radicals&quot; of muriatic acid (<link><target>hydrochloric acid</target></link>),<space/><link><target>boric acid</target><part>boracic acid</part></link>, and &quot;fluoric&quot; acid; 17 metals; 5 earths (mainly oxides of yet unknown metals such as<space/><link><target>magnesium oxide</target><part>magnesia</part></link>,<space/><link><target>barite</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>strontia</target></link>); three alkalies (<link><target>potash</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Sodium oxide</target><part>soda</part></link>, and<space/><link><target>ammonia</target></link>); and the &quot;radicals&quot; of 19 organic acids. The acids, regarded in the new system as compounds of various elements with oxygen, were given names which indicated the element involved together with the degree of oxygenation of that element, for example sulfuric and sulfurous acids, phosphoric and phosphorus acids, nitric and nitrous acids, the &quot;ic&quot; termination indicating acids with a higher proportion of oxygen than those with the &quot;ous&quot; ending. Similarly, salts of the &quot;ic&quot; acids were given the terminal letters &quot;ate,&quot; as in copper sulfate, whereas the salts of the &quot;ous&quot; acids terminated with the suffix &quot;ite,&quot; as in copper sulfite. The total effect of the new nomenclature can be gauged by comparing the new name &quot;<link><target>copper sulfate</target></link>&quot; with the old term &quot;vitriol of Venus.&quot; Lavoisier described this system of nomenclature in<space/><italics>Mthode de nomenclature chimique</italics><space/>(<italics>Method of Chemical Nomenclature</italics>, 1787).</paragraph><heading level='3'>Elementary Treatise of Chemistry</heading><paragraph>Lavoisier employed the new nomenclature in his<space/><italics><link><target>Trait lmentaire de chimie</target></link></italics><space/>(<italics>Elementary Treatise on Chemistry</italics>), published in 1789. This work represents the synthesis of Lavoisier's contribution to chemistry and can be considered the first modern<space/><link><target>textbook</target></link><space/>on the subject. The core of the work was the oxygen theory, and the work became a most effective vehicle for the transmission of the new doctrines. It presented a unified view of new theories of chemistry, contained a clear statement of the law of<space/><link><target>conservation of mass</target></link>, and denied the existence of phlogiston. This text clarified the concept of an element as a substance that could not be broken down by any known method of chemical analysis, and presented Lavoisier's theory of the formation of chemical compounds from elements. It remains a classic in the history of science. While many leading chemists of the time refused to accept Lavoisier's new ideas, demand for<space/><italics>Trait lmentaire</italics><space/>as a textbook in Edinburgh was sufficient to merit translation into English within about a year of its French publication.<extension extension_name='ref'>See the &quot;Advertisement,&quot; p. vi of Kerr's translation, and pp. xxvixxvii, xxviii of Douglas McKie's introduction to the Dover edition.</extension><space/>In any event, the<space/><italics>Trait lmentaire</italics><space/>was sufficiently sound to convince the next generation.<link><target>File:Lavoisier humanexp.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>250px</part><part>Lavoisier conducting an experiment on respiration in the 1770s</part></link></paragraph><heading level='3'>Physiological work</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Calorimeter.gif</target><part>left</part><part>thumb</part><part>184x184px</part><part><link><target>Constant-pressure calorimeter</target></link>, engraving made by madame Lavoisier for<space/><link><target>thermochemistry</target></link><space/>experiments</part></link>The relationship between combustion and respiration had long been recognized from the essential role which air played in both processes.

His first memoirs on this topic were read to the Academy of Sciences in 1777, but his most significant contribution to this field was made in the winter of 1782/1783 in association with<space/><link><target>Laplace</target></link>. The result of this work was published in a famous memoir, &quot;On Heat.&quot; Lavoisier and Laplace designed an ice<space/><link><target>calorimeter</target></link><space/>apparatus for measuring the amount of heat given off during combustion or respiration. The outer shell of the calorimeter was packed with snow, which melted to maintain a constant temperature of<space/><template><target>nowrap</target><arg>0 °C</arg></template><space/>around an inner shell filled with ice. By measuring the quantity of<space/><link><target>carbon dioxide</target></link><space/>and heat produced by confining a live guinea pig in this apparatus, and by comparing the amount of heat produced when sufficient carbon was burned in the ice calorimeter to produce the same amount of carbon dioxide as that which the guinea pig exhaled, they concluded that respiration was in fact a slow combustion process. Lavoisier stated,<space/><italics>&quot;la respiration est donc une combustion,&quot;</italics><space/>that is, respiratory gas exchange is a combustion, like that of a candle burning.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/79/5/899S'>Is a Calorie a Calorie?</link><space/><italics>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</italics>, Vol. 79, No. 5, 899S906S, May 2004</extension></paragraph><paragraph>This continuous slow combustion, which they supposed took place in the lungs, enabled the living animal to maintain its body temperature above that of its surroundings, thus accounting for the puzzling phenomenon of animal heat.

They designed an ambitious set of experiments to study the whole process of body<space/><link><target>metabolism</target></link><space/>and respiration using Seguin as a human guinea pig in the experiments. Their work was only partially completed and published because of the disruption of the Revolution; but Lavoisier's pioneering work in this field served to inspire similar research on physiological processes for generations to come.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Final days and execution</heading><paragraph>As the<space/><link><target>French Revolution</target></link><space/>gained momentum from 1789 on, Lavoisier's world inexorably collapsed around him. Attacks mounted on the deeply unpopular<space/><italics>Ferme Gnrale</italics>, and it was eventually suppressed in 1791. In 1792 Lavoisier was forced to resign from his post on the Gunpowder Commission and to move from his house and laboratory at the Royal Arsenal. On 8 August 1793, all the learned societies, including the Academy of Sciences, were suppressed.</paragraph><paragraph>It is difficult to assess Lavoisier's own attitude to the political turmoil. Like so many intellectual liberals, he felt that the<space/><link><target>Ancien Rgime</target></link><space/>could be reformed from the inside if only reason and moderation prevailed. Characteristically, one of his last major works was a proposal to the<space/><link><target>National Convention</target></link><space/>for the reform of French education. He tried to remain aloof from the political cockpit, no doubt fearful and uncomprehending of the violence he saw therein. However, on 24 November 1793, the arrest of all the former tax gatherers was ordered. He was branded a traitor by the Convention under<space/><link><target>Maximilien de Robespierre</target></link><space/>during the<space/><link><target>Reign of Terror</target></link>, in 1794.
