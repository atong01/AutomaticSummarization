Judicial review of administrative decisions is different from an administrative appeal. When sitting in review of a decision, the Court will only look at the method in which the decision was arrived at, whereas in an administrative appeal the correctness of the decision itself will be examined, usually by a higher body in the agency.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">September 2009</arg></template><space/>This difference is vital in appreciating administrative law in common law countries.</paragraph><paragraph>The scope of<space/><link><target>judicial review</target></link><space/>may be limited to certain questions of<space/><link><target>Equity (law)</target><part>fairness</part></link>, or whether the administrative action is<space/><italics><link><target>ultra vires</target></link></italics>.

There is however a single General Administrative Law Act (&quot;Algemene wet bestuursrecht&quot; or Awb) that applies both to the making of administrative decisions and the judicial review of these decisions in courts. On the basis of the Awb, citizens can oppose a decision ('besluit') made by an administrative agency ('bestuursorgaan') within the administration and apply for judicial review in courts if unsuccessful.</paragraph><paragraph>Unlike France or Germany, there are no special administrative courts of first instance in the Netherlands, but regular courts have an administrative &quot;chamber&quot; which specializes in administrative appeals.

This is called &quot;bezwaar&quot;. This procedure allows for the administrative body to correct possible mistakes themselves and is used to filter cases before going to court. Sometimes, instead of bezwaar, a different system is used called &quot;administratief beroep&quot; (administrative<space/><link><target>appeal</target></link>). The difference with bezwaar is that administratief beroep is filed with a different administrative body, usually a higher ranking one, than the administrative body that made the primary decision. Administratief beroep is available only if the law on which the primary decision is based specifically provides for it. An example involves objecting to a<space/><link><target>traffic ticket</target></link><space/>with the district attorney (&quot;officier van justitie&quot;), after which the decision can be appealed in court.</paragraph><paragraph>In addition, Netherlands General Administrative Law Act (GALA) is a rather good sample of procedural laws in Europe</paragraph><heading level='3'>Turkey</heading><paragraph>In Turkey, the lawsuits against the acts and actions of the national or local governments and public bodies are handled by administrative courts which are the main administrative courts.
