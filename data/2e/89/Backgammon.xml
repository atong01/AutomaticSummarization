The playing pieces are moved according to the roll of<space/><link><target>dice</target></link>, and a player wins by removing all of his pieces from the board before his opponent. Backgammon is a member of the<space/><link><target>Tables (board game)</target><part>tables</part></link><space/>family, one of the oldest classes of board games in the world.</paragraph><paragraph>Backgammon involves a combination of strategy and luck (from rolling dice). While the dice may determine the outcome of a single game, over a series of many games, the better player will accumulate the better record. Thus, records of matches between players are good indicators of relative skill.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.backgammon.org/articles/backgammonluckskill'>&quot;Backgammon Luck ''vs'' Skill&quot;</link>, backgammon.org</extension><space/>With each roll of the dice, players must choose from numerous options for moving their checkers and anticipate possible counter-moves by the opponent. In<space/><link><target>Backgammon#United States</target><part>variants</part></link><space/>that originate from early 20th century New York, players may raise the stakes during the game. There is an established repertoire of common tactics and occurrences.</paragraph><paragraph>Like<space/><link><target>chess</target></link>, backgammon has been studied with great interest by<space/><link><target>Computer science</target><part>computer scientists</part></link>.

The checkers are, in the most often-played variants, scattered at first, and may be blocked or hit by the opponent. As the playing time for each individual game is short, it is often played in matches, where victory is awarded to the first player to reach a certain number of points.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Setup</heading><paragraph>Each side of the board has a track of 12 long triangles, called points. The points are considered to be connected across one edge of the board, forming a continuous track in the shape of a<space/><link><target>horseshoe</target></link>, and are numbered from 1 to 24. In the most commonly used setup, each player begins with fifteen checkers, two are placed on their 24-point, three on their 8-point, and five each on their 13-point and their 6-point.

If the players roll the same number, they must roll again. Both dice must land completely flat on the right-hand side of the gameboard. The players then alternate turns, rolling two dice at the beginning of each turn.<extension extension_name='ref' name="robertie-winners"></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="hoyle"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>After rolling the dice, players must, if possible, move their checkers according to the number shown on each die. For example, if the player rolls a 6 and a 3 (notated as &quot;6-3&quot;), the player must move one checker six points forward, and another or the same checker three points forward. The same checker may be moved twice, as long as the two moves can be made separately and legally: six and then three, or three and then six. If a player rolls two of the same number, called doubles, that player must play each die twice. For example, a roll of 5-5 allows the player to make up to four moves of five spaces each. On any roll, a player must move according to the numbers on both dice if it is at all possible to do so. If one or both numbers do not allow a legal move, the player forfeits that portion of the roll and his/her turn ends. If moves can be made according to either one die or the other, but not both, the higher number must be used. If one die is unable to be moved, but such a move is made possible by the moving of the other die, that move is compulsory.</paragraph><paragraph>In the course of a move, a checker may land on any point that is unoccupied or is occupied by one or more of the player's own checkers. It may also land on a point occupied by exactly one opposing checker, or &quot;blot&quot;. In this case, the blot has been &quot;hit&quot;, and is placed in the middle of the board on the bar that divides the two sides of the playing surface. A checker may never land on a point occupied by two or more opposing checkers; thus, no point is ever occupied by checkers from both players simultaneously.<extension extension_name='ref' name="robertie-winners"></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="hoyle"></extension><space/>There is no limit to the number of checkers that can occupy a point at any given time.</paragraph><paragraph>Checkers placed on the bar must re-enter the game through the opponent's home board before any other move can be made. A roll of 1 allows the checker to enter on the 24-point (opponent's 1), a roll of 2 on the 23-point (opponent's 2), and so forth, up to a roll of 6 allowing entry on the 19-point (opponent's 6). Checkers may not enter on a point occupied by two or more opposing checkers. Checkers can enter on unoccupied points, or on points occupied by a single opposing checker; in the latter case, the single checker is hit and placed on the bar. More than one checker can be on the bar at a time. A player may not move any other checkers until all checkers on the bar belonging to that player have re-entered the board.<extension extension_name='ref' name="robertie-winners"></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="hoyle"></extension><space/>If a player has checkers on the bar, but rolls a combination that does not allow any of those checkers to re-enter, the player does not move. If the opponent's home board is completely &quot;closed&quot; (i.e. all six points are each occupied by two or more checkers), there is no roll that will allow a player to enter a checker from the bar, and that player stops rolling and playing until at least one point becomes open (occupied by one or zero checkers) due to the opponent's moves.</paragraph><paragraph>When all of a player's checkers are in that player's home board, that player may start removing them; this is called &quot;bearing off&quot;. A roll of 1 may be used to bear off a checker from the 1-point, a 2 from the 2-point, and so on. A die may not be used to bear off checkers from a lower-numbered point unless there are no checkers on any higher points.<extension extension_name='ref' name="robertie-winners"></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="hoyle"></extension><space/>For example, if a player rolls a 6 and a 5, but has no checkers on the 6-point and two on the 5-point, then the 6 and the 5 must be used to bear off the two checkers from the 5-point. When bearing off, a player may also move a lower die roll before the higher even if that means the full value of the higher die is not fully utilized. For example, if a player has exactly one checker remaining on the 6-point, and rolls a 6 and a 1, the player may move the 6-point checker one place to the 5-point with the lower die roll of 1, and then bear that checker off the 5-point using the die roll of 6; this is sometimes useful tactically. As before, if there is a way to fully use the moves showing on the dice, by moving checkers within the home board and/or bearing them off, the player must do so.</paragraph><paragraph>If one player has not borne off any checkers by the time that player's opponent has borne off all fifteen, then the player has lost<space/><bold>a gammon</bold>, which counts for double a normal loss. If the losing player has not borne off any checkers and still has checkers on the bar or in the opponent's home board, then the player has lost<space/><bold>a backgammon</bold>, which counts for three times a normal loss.<extension extension_name='ref' name="robertie-winners"></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="hoyle"></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Doubling cube</heading><paragraph><link><target>Image:Backgammon DoublingCube.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Doubling cube</part></link>To speed up match play and to provide an added dimension for strategy, a doubling cube is usually used. The doubling cube is not a die to be rolled but rather a marker with the numbers 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 inscribed on its sides, to denote the current stake. At the start of each game, the doubling cube is placed on the bar with the number 64 showing; the cube is then said to be &quot;centered, on 1&quot;. When the cube is centered, the player about to roll may propose that the game be played for twice the current stakes. Their opponent must either accept (&quot;take&quot;) the doubled stakes or resign (&quot;drop&quot;) the game immediately.</paragraph><paragraph>Whenever a player accepts doubled stakes, the cube is placed on their side of the board with the corresponding<space/><link><target>power of two</target></link><space/>facing upward, to indicate that the right to re-double belongs exclusively to the player who last accepted a double.<extension extension_name='ref' name="robertie-winners"></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="hoyle"></extension><space/>If the opponent drops the doubled stakes, he loses the game at the current value of the doubling cube. For instance, if the cube showed the number 2 and a player wanted to redouble the stakes to put it at 4, the opponent choosing to drop the redouble would lose two, or twice the original stake.</paragraph><paragraph>The game is rarely redoubled beyond four times the original stake, but there is no limit on the number of redoubles. Although 64 is the highest number depicted on the doubling cube, the stakes may rise to 128, 256, and so on. In money games, a player is often permitted to &quot;<bold>beaver</bold>&quot; when offered the cube, doubling the value of the game again, while retaining possession of the cube.<extension extension_name='ref' name="bill_robertie-beavers"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.gammonvillage.com/backgammon/news/early_beavers.cfm<space/></arg><arg name="title">Backgammon Beavers<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2007-10-17<space/></arg><arg name="last">Robertie<space/></arg><arg name="first">Bill<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">GammonVillage<space/></arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>A variant of the doubling cube &quot;beaver&quot; is the &quot;<bold>raccoon</bold>.&quot; Players who doubled their opponent, seeing the opponent beaver the cube, may in turn then double the stakes once again (&quot;raccoon&quot;) as part of that cube phase before any dice are rolled. The opponent retains the doubling cube. E.g. White doubles Black to 2 points, Black accepts then beavers the cube to 4 points; White, confident of a win, raccoons the cube to 8 points, while Black retains the cube. Such a move adds greatly to the risk of having to face the doubling cube coming back at 8 times its original value when first doubling the opponent (offered at 2 points, counter offered at 16 points) should the luck of the dice change.</paragraph><paragraph>Some players may opt to invoke<space/><bold>The Murphy rule</bold><space/>or the &quot;automatic double rule.&quot; If both opponents roll the same opening number, the doubling cube is incremented on each occasion yet remains in the middle of the board, available to either player. The Murphy rule may be invoked with a maximum number of automatic doubles allowed and that limit is agreed to prior to a game or match commencing. When a player decides to double the opponent, the value is then a double of whatever face value is shown (e.g. if two automatic doubles have occurred putting the cube up to 4, the first in-game double will be for 8 points). The Murphy rule is not an official rule in backgammon and is rarely, if ever, seen in use at officially sanctioned tournaments.</paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><bold>Jacoby rule</bold>, named after<space/><link><target>Oswald Jacoby</target></link>, allows gammons and backgammons to count for their respective double and triple values only if the cube has already been offered and accepted. This encourages a player with a large lead to double, possibly ending the game, rather than to play it to conclusion hoping for a gammon or backgammon. The Jacoby rule is widely used in money play but is not used in match play.<extension extension_name='ref' name="robertie-serious"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last">Robertie<space/></arg><arg name="first">Bill<space/></arg><arg name="authorlink">Bill Robertie<space/></arg><arg name="title">Backgammon for Serious Players<space/></arg><arg name="edition">Second<space/></arg><arg name="year">2006<space/></arg><arg name="pages">19–22<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Cardoza<space/></arg><arg name="isbn">0-940685-68-X</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><bold>Crawford rule</bold>, named after<space/><link><target>John R. Crawford</target></link>, is designed to make match play more equitable for the player in the lead. If a player is one point away from winning a match, that player's opponent will always want to double as early as possible in order to catch up. Whether the game is worth one point or two, the trailing player must win to continue the match. To balance the situation, the Crawford rule requires that when a player first reaches a score one point short of winning, neither player may use the doubling cube for the following game, called the<space/><bold>Crawford game</bold>. After the Crawford game, normal use of the doubling cube resumes. The Crawford rule is routinely used in tournament match play.<extension extension_name='ref' name="robertie-serious"></extension><space/>It is possible for a Crawford game never to occur in a match.</paragraph><paragraph>If the Crawford rule is in effect, then another option is the<space/><bold>Holland rule</bold>, named after<space/><link><target>Tim Holland (backgammon)</target><part>Tim Holland</part></link>, which stipulates that after the Crawford game, a player cannot double until after at least two rolls have been played by each side.

Recent computer analysis has offered more insight on opening plays, but the midgame is reached quickly. After the opening, backgammon players frequently rely on some established general strategies, combining and switching among them to adapt to the changing conditions of a game.</paragraph><paragraph>The most direct strategy is simply to avoid being hit, trapped, or held in a stand-off. A &quot;running game&quot; describes a strategy of moving as quickly as possible around the board, and is most successful when a player is already ahead in the race.<extension extension_name='ref' name="magriel"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last">Magriel<space/></arg><arg name="first">Paul<space/></arg><arg name="authorlink">Paul Magriel<space/></arg><arg name="title">Backgammon<space/></arg><arg name="year">1976<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Quadrangle/The New York Times Book Co<space/></arg><arg name="isbn"><space/>0-8129-0615-2</arg></template></extension><space/>When this fails, one may opt for a &quot;holding game&quot;, maintaining control of a point on one's opponent's side of the board, called an anchor.

The minimum total of dice rolls needed to move a player's checkers around and off the board is called the &quot;pip count&quot;. The difference between the two players' pip counts is frequently used as a measure of the leader's racing advantage. Players often use<space/><link><target>mental calculation</target></link><space/>techniques to determine pip counts in live play.<extension extension_name='ref' name="magriel"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Backgammon is played in two principal variations, &quot;Money&quot; and &quot;Match&quot; play. Money play means that every point counts evenly and every game stands alone, whether money is actually being wagered or not. &quot;Match&quot; play means that the players play until one side scores (or exceeds) a certain number of points. The format has a significant effect on strategy. In a match, the objective is not to win the maximum possible number of points, but rather to simply reach the score needed to win the match. For example, a player leading a 9-point match by a score of 7-5 would be very reluctant to turn the doubling cube, as their opponent could take and make a costless redouble to 4, placing the entire outcome of the match on the current game. Conversely, the trailing player would double very aggressively, particularly if he has chances to win a gammon in the current game. In money play, the theoretically correct checker play and cube action would never vary based on the score.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Cheating</heading><paragraph>To reduce the possibility of cheating, most good quality backgammon sets use<space/><link><target>Dice#Precision dice</target><part>precision dice</part></link><space/>and a<space/><link><target>dice cup</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Dummies"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last1">Bray</arg><arg name="first1">Chris</arg><arg name="title">Backgammon for Dummies</arg><arg name="publisher">John Wiley & Sons</arg><arg name="year">2008</arg><arg name="ISBN">978-0-470-69456-5</arg><arg name="page">13 and 224</arg></template></extension><space/>This reduces the likelihood of<space/><link><target>Dice#Loaded dice</target><part>loaded dice</part></link><space/>being used, which is the main way of cheating in face-to-face play.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last1">Harrington Green</arg><arg name="first1">Jonathan</arg><arg name="title">An exposure of the arts and miseries of gambling</arg><arg name="publisher">Redding</arg><arg name="year">1845</arg><arg name="page">203</arg></template></extension><space/>A common method of cheating online is the use of a computer program to find the optimal move on each turn; to combat this, many online sites use move-comparison software that identifies when a player's moves resemble those of a backgammon program.

The white and black checkers were so distributed on the points that the only way to use all of the three results, as required by the game rules, was to break the three stacks of two checkers into blots, exposing them and ruining the game for Zeno.<extension extension_name='ref' name="austin-zeno">Austin, Roland G. &quot;Zeno's Game of &quot;,<space/><italics>The Journal of Hellenic Studies</italics><space/>54:2, 1934. pp 202-205.</extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="bell">Robert Charles Bell,<space/><italics>Board and table games from many civilizations</italics>, Courier Dover Publications, 1979, ISBN 0-486-23855-5, pp. 3335.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>The of Zeno's time is believed to be a direct descendant of the earlier Roman<space/><italics><link><target>Ludus duodecim scriptorum</target></link></italics><space/>(&quot;Game of twelve lines&quot;) with that board's middle row of points removed, and only the two outer rows remaining.<extension extension_name='ref' name="austin-roman2"></extension><space/>Ludus duodecim scriptorum used a board with three rows of 12 points each with the 15 checkers being moved in opposing directions by the two players across three rows according to the roll of the three cubical dice.<extension extension_name='ref' name="austin-zeno"></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="austin-roman2"></extension><space/>Little specific text about the gameplay of Ludus duodecim scriptorum has survived;<extension extension_name='ref' name="austin-roman1"><template><target>cite journal</target><arg name="last">Austin<space/></arg><arg name="first">Roland G.<space/></arg><arg name="title">Roman Board Games.

The use of dice for the game is another indication of its Indic origin, since dice and gambling were a favorite pastime in ancient India. The rules of the game, however, first appeared in the [[Middle Persian]] text ''Wızarisnı Catrang ud Nihisnı New Ardaxsır'' (Explanation of Chess and Invention of Backgammon), composed in the sixth century during the rule of the Sasanian king Khosrow I (530–571). The text assigns its invention to the Persian sage Wuzurgmihr (Persian) [[Burzoe|Buzarjumihr/Bozorgmehr]], who was the minister of King [[Khosrau I|Khosrow I]]. According to the historical legend, the Indian king Dewisarm sends his minister Taxritos to [[Persia]] with the game of [[chess]], and a letter challenging Sasanian King Khosrow I to solve the riddle or rationale for the game. Khosrow asks for three days to decipher the game, but initially no-one in the court is able to make any progress. On the third day, Khosrow's minister, Wuzurgmihr, successfully rises and explains the logic of the game. As a reciprical challenge, Wuzurgmihr constructs the game of backgammon and delivers it to the Indian king who is unable to decipher the game.<ref>Daryaee, Touraj (2006) in "Backgammon" in ''Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia'' ed.
