Research of impact damage of ships has revealed that double-hulled tankers are unlikely to perforate both hulls in a collision, preventing oil from seeping out. However, for smaller tankers, U shaped tanks might be susceptible to &quot;free flooding&quot; across the double bottom and up to the outside water level each side of the cargo tank. Salvors prefer to salvage doubled-hulled tankers because they permit the use of air pressure to vacuum out the flood water.<extension extension_name='ref' name="CEIDA"></extension><space/>In the 1960s, collision proof double hulls for nuclear ships were extensively investigated, due to escalating concerns over nuclear accidents.<extension extension_name='ref' name="OkumotoTakeda2009"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The ability of double-hulled tankers to prevent or reduce oil spills led to double hulls being standardized for other types of ships including oil tankers by the<space/><link><target>International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships</target></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>MARPOL</target></link><space/>Convention.<extension extension_name='ref' name="ChircopLindn2006"></extension><space/>In 1992, MARPOL was amended, making it &quot;mandatory for tankers of 5,000 dwt and more ordered after 6 July 1993 to be fitted with double hulls, or an alternative design approved by<space/><link><target>International Maritime Organization</target><part>IMO</part></link>&quot;.

Double hulls by no means eliminate the possibility of the hulls breaking apart. Due to the air space between the hulls, there is also a potential problem with volatile gases seeping out through worn areas of the internal hull, increasing the risk of an explosion.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="title">World in Transition: New structures for global environmental policy</arg><arg name="url">http://books.google.com/books?id</arg><arg name="year">2001</arg><arg name="publisher">Earthscan</arg><arg name="isbn">978-1-85383-852-1</arg><arg name="page">34</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Although several international conventions against pollution are in place, as of 2003 there was still no formal body setting international mandatory standards, although the International Safety Guide for Oil Tankers and Terminals (ISGOTT) does provide guidelines giving advise on optimum use and safety, such as recommending that ballast tanks are not entered while loaded with cargo, and that weekly samples are made of the atmosphere inside for hydrocarbon gas.<extension extension_name='ref' name="CEIDA"></extension><space/>Due to the difficulties of maintenance, ship builders have been competitive in producing double-hulled ships which are easier to inspect, such as ballast and cargo tanks which are easily accessible and easier to spot corrosion in the hull.<extension extension_name='ref' name="CEIDA"></extension><space/>The Tanker Structure Cooperative Forum (TSCF) published the<space/><italics>Guide to Inspection and Maintenance of Double-Hull Tanker Structures</italics><space/>in 1995 giving advice based on experience of operating double-hulled tankers.<extension extension_name='ref' name="BoardBoard2001"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="author1">Marine Board</arg><arg name="author2">Transportation Research Board</arg><arg name="title">Environmental Performance of Tanker Designs in Collision and Grounding: Method for Comparison – Special Report 259</arg><arg name="url">http://books.google.com/books?id</arg><arg name="date">2 October 2001</arg><arg name="publisher">National Academies Press</arg><arg name="isbn">978-0-309-55033-8</arg><arg name="page">128</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>reflist</target></template></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Category:Tankers</target></link><link><target>Category:Oil tankers</target></link><link><target>Category:Ship types</target></link><link><target>Category:Ship design</target></link><link><target>Category:Shipbuilding</target></link></paragraph></article>
