The '''ampere''' ([[International System of Units|SI]] [[Units of measurement|unit]] symbol: A), often [[Clipping (morphology)|shortened]] to "amp",<ref name=BIPM2006>SI supports only the use of symbols and deprecates the use of abbreviations for units.{{cite web | format = [[PDF]] | url= http://www.bipm.fr/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf |title=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures |year=2006  |page=130 | accessdate =21 November 2011}}</ref> is the SI unit of [[electric current]]<ref name="BIPMdefinition">{{Citation | chapter = 2.1.

The ampere is equivalent to one [[coulomb]] (roughly {{val|6.241|e=18}} times the [[elementary charge]]) per second.<ref>{{Citation | author-link = David Bodanis| last = Bodanis | first = David | year = 2005 | title = Electric Universe | place = New York | publisher = Three Rivers Press | ISBN = 978-0-307-33598-2}}</ref> Amperes are used to express flow rate of electric charge. For any point experiencing a current, if the number of charged particles passing or the charge on the particles is increased, the amperes of current at that point will proportionately increase.

The ampere should not be confused with the [[coulomb]] (also called "ampere-second") or the [[ampere-hour]] (A⋅h). The ampere is a unit of current, the amount of charge transiting per unit time, and the coulomb is a unit of [[electric charge|charge]]. When [[International System of Units|SI units]] are used, constant, instantaneous and average current are expressed in amperes (as in "the charging current is 1.2&nbsp;A") and the charge accumulated, or passed through a circuit over a period of time is expressed in coulombs (as in "the [[battery (electricity)|battery]] charge is {{val|30000|u=C}}"). The relation of the ampere to the coulomb is the same as that of the [[watt]] to the [[joule]], and that of [[metre per second]] to [[metre]].

:<math>\rm 1\ A=1\tfrac C s.</math>
In general, charge ''Q'' is determined by steady current ''I'' flowing for a time ''t'' as {{nowrap|1=''Q'' = ''It''}}.

== History ==
The ampere was originally defined as one tenth of the unit of [[electric current]] in the [[centimetre–gram–second system of units]]; that unit, now known as the [[abampere]], was defined as the amount of current that generates a force of two [[dyne]]s per centimetre of length between two wires one centimetre apart.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://alpha.montclair.edu/~kowalskiL/SI/SI_PAGE.HTML | title = A short history of the SI units in electricity | publisher = Montclair | last = Kowalski | first = L}}.</ref> The size of the unit was chosen so that the units derived from it in the MKSA system would be conveniently sized.

The "international ampere" was an early realization of the ampere, defined as the current that would deposit {{val|0.001118000|u=grams}} of silver per second from a [[silver nitrate]] solution.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.sizes.com/units/ampHist.htm | title = History of the ampere | publisher = Sizes}}</ref> Later, more accurate measurements revealed that this current is {{val|0.99985|u=A}}.

== Realization ==
The standard ampere is most accurately realized using a [[watt balance]], but is in practice maintained via [[Ohm's law]] from the units of [[electromotive force]] and [[electrical resistance|resistance]], the [[volt]] and the [[ohm]], since the latter two can be tied to physical phenomena that are relatively easy to reproduce, the [[Josephson junction]] and the [[quantum Hall effect]], respectively.<ref name = "Electrical quantities">{{Citation | url = http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/appendix2/electrical.html | title = SI brochure | chapter = Appendix 2: Practical realization of unit definitions: Electrical quantities | publisher = BIPM}}.</ref>

At present, techniques to establish the realization of an ampere have a [[relative uncertainty]] of approximately a few parts in 10<sup>7</sup>, and involve realizations of the watt, the ohm and the volt.<ref name= "Electrical quantities" />

== Proposed future definition ==
{{Main|New SI definitions}}
Rather than a definition in terms of the force between two current-carrying wires, it has been proposed to define the ampere in terms of the rate of flow of elementary charges.<ref name = "Beyond" />  Since a [[coulomb]] is approximately equal to {{val|6.2415093|e=18}} [[elementary charge]]s (such as [[electron]]s), one ampere is approximately equivalent to {{val|6.2415093|e=18}} elementary charges moving past a boundary in one second, or the reciprocal of the value of the elementary charges in coulombs.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?e | publisher = NIST | place = USA | title = Physics | contribution = Value}}.</ref> The proposed change would define 1&nbsp;A as being the current in the direction of flow of a particular number of elementary charges per second. In 2005, the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) agreed to study the proposed change. The [[New SI definitions|new definition]] was discussed at the 25th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM) in 2014 but for the time being was not adopted.

== Everyday examples ==
{{main|Orders of magnitude (current)}}
The current drawn by typical constant-voltage energy distribution systems is usually dictated by the power ([[watt]]s) consumed by the system and the operating voltage. For this reason the examples given below are grouped by voltage level.

=== Portable gadgets ===
*Hearing aid (typically 1&nbsp;mW at 1.4&nbsp;V): 0.7&nbsp;mA

=== Motor vehicles – 12 V DC ===
A typical motor vehicle has a 12&nbsp;V battery. The various accessories that are powered by the battery might include:
*Instrument panel light (typically 2&nbsp;W): 166&nbsp;mA.
*Headlights (typically 60&nbsp;W): 5&nbsp;A each.
*Starter motor (typically 1–2&nbsp;kW): 80–160&nbsp;A

=== North American domestic supply – 120 V AC ===
Most United States, Canada and Mexico domestic power suppliers run at 120&nbsp;V.

Household [[circuit breaker]]s typically provide a maximum of 15&nbsp;A or 20&nbsp;A of current to a given set of outlets.
*22-inch/56-centimeter portable television (35&nbsp;W): 290&nbsp;mA
*Tungsten light bulb (60–100&nbsp;W): 500–830&nbsp;mA
*Toaster, kettle (1.5&nbsp;kW): 12.5&nbsp;A
*Hair dryer (1.8&nbsp;kW): 15&nbsp;A

=== European & Commonwealth domestic supply – 230-240 V AC ===
Most European domestic power supplies run at 230&nbsp;V, and most Commonwealth domestic power supplies run at 240&nbsp;V. For the same amount of power (in watts), the current drawn by a particular European or Commonwealth appliance (in Europe or a Commonwealth country) will be less than for an equivalent North American appliance.<ref group="Note">The formula for power is given by
:<math>
P(t) = I(t) \cdot V(t) \,
</math>
so it follows that if the voltage is doubled and the power remains the same, the current will be halved.</ref> Typical circuit breakers will provide 16&nbsp;A.

The current drawn by a number of typical appliances are:
*22-inch/56-centimeter portable television (35&nbsp;W): 145–150&nbsp;mA
*Tungsten light bulb (60–100&nbsp;W): 240–450&nbsp;mA
*Compact fluorescent lamp (11–30&nbsp;W): 56–112&nbsp;mA
*Toaster, kettle (2&nbsp;kW): 9&nbsp;A
*Immersion heater (4.6&nbsp;kW): 19–20&nbsp;A
