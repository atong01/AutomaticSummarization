There were two schools of thought competing: some favoured a classical international organization with representatives of governments, while others preferred a political forum with parliamentarians. Both approaches were finally combined through the creation of the Committee of Ministers and the Parliamentary Assembly under the Statute of the Council of Europe. This dual intergovernmental and inter-parliamentary structure was later copied for the<space/><link><target>European Communities</target></link>,<space/><link><target>NATO</target><part>North Atlantic Treaty Organization</part></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F023908-0002, Straburg, Tagung des Europarates.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Session of the Council of Europe's Assembly in the former<space/><link><target>Palace of Europe</target><part>House of Europe</part></link><space/>in Strasbourg in 1967</part></link><link><target>File:Flags in front of Council of Europe 2.JPG</target><part>right</part><part>thumb</part><part><link><target>Japanese flag</target></link><space/>in front of Council of Europe following the<space/><link><target>2011 Thoku earthquake and tsunami</target></link></part></link></paragraph><paragraph>The Council of Europe was founded on 5 May 1949 by the<space/><link><target>Treaty of London (1949)</target><part>Treaty of London</part></link>.

Those conventions and decisions are developed by the member states working together at the Council of Europe, whereas secondary European Community law is set by the organs of the European Union. Both organizations function as concentric circles around the common foundations for<space/><link><target>European integration</target></link>, with the Council of Europe being the geographically wider circle. The European Union could be seen as the smaller circle with a much higher level of integration through the transfer of powers from the national to the EU level. Being part of public international law, Council of Europe conventions could also be opened for signature to non-member states thus facilitating equal co-operation with countries outside Europe (see chapter below).</paragraph><paragraph>The Council of Europe's most famous achievement is the<space/><link><target>European Convention on Human Rights</target></link>, which was adopted in 1950 following a report by the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly. The Convention created the<space/><link><target>European Court of Human Rights</target></link><space/>in Strasbourg. The Court supervises compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights and thus functions as the highest European court for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It is to this court that Europeans can bring cases if they believe that a member country has violated their fundamental rights.</paragraph><paragraph>The various activities and achievements of the Council of Europe can be found in detail on its official website.
