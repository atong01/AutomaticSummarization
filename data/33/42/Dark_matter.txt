'''Dark matter''' is a hypothetical kind of [[matter]] that cannot be seen with telescopes but would account for most of the matter in the [[universe]]. The existence and properties of dark matter are inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, on radiation, and on the [[Large-scale cosmic structure|large-scale structure]] of the universe. Dark matter has not been detected directly, making it one of the greatest mysteries in modern [[astrophysics]].

Dark matter neither [[blackbody spectrum|emits]] nor absorbs [[light]] or any other [[electromagnetic radiation]] at any significant level. According to the [[Planck (spacecraft)#2013 data release|Planck mission team]], and based on the [[lambda-CDM model|standard model of cosmology]], the total [[Mass–energy equivalence|mass–energy]] of the [[observable universe|known universe]] contains 4.9% [[Baryonic matter|ordinary matter]], 26.8% dark matter and 68.3% [[dark energy]].<ref name="planck_overview">{{cite journal|first1=P.

Astrophysicists hypothesized the existence of dark matter to account for discrepancies between the mass of large astronomical objects determined from their gravitational effects, and their mass as calculated from the observable matter (stars, gas, and dust) that they can be seen to contain. Their gravitational effects suggest that their masses are much greater than the observable matter survey suggests. 

Dark matter was postulated by [[Jan Oort]] in 1932, albeit based upon insufficient evidence, to account for the orbital velocities of stars in the [[Milky Way]]. In 1933, [[Fritz Zwicky]] was the first to use the [[virial theorem]] to infer the existence of unseen matter, which he referred to as ''dunkle Materie'' 'dark matter'.<ref>{{Citation | last = Zwicky | first = F. | bibcode = 1933AcHPh...6..110Z | title = Die Rotverschiebung von extragalaktischen Nebeln | date = 1933 | journal = Helvetica Physica Acta | volume = 6 | pages = 110&ndash;127}} See also {{Citation | last = Zwicky | first = F. | bibcode = 1937ApJ....86..217Z | title = On the Masses of Nebulae and of Clusters of Nebulae | date = 1937 | journal = Astrophysical Journal | volume = 86 | page = 217 | doi = 10.1086/143864}}</ref> More robust evidence from [[galaxy rotation curve]]s was discovered by [[Horace W.

According to consensus among cosmologists, dark matter is composed primarily of a not yet characterized type of [[subatomic particle]].<ref name="Copi 1995">

Although the existence of dark matter is generally accepted by the mainstream scientific community, some alternative theories of gravity have been proposed, such as [[Modified Newtonian dynamics|MOND]] and [[Tensor–vector–scalar gravity|TeVeS]], which try to account for the anomalous observations without requiring additional matter. However, these theories cannot account for the properties of galaxy clusters.<ref name="Angus" >

Dark matter's existence is inferred from [[gravity|gravitational]] effects on visible matter and [[gravitational lensing]] of background radiation, and was originally hypothesized to account for discrepancies between calculations of the mass of [[galaxy|galaxies]], clusters of galaxies and the entire universe made through [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamical]] and [[general relativity|general relativistic]] means, and calculations based on the mass of the visible "luminous" matter these objects contain: [[star]]s and the gas and dust of the [[interstellar medium|interstellar]] and [[Intergalactic space|intergalactic]] medium.<ref name="Trimble 1987" >

The most widely accepted explanation for these phenomena is that dark matter exists and that it is most probably<ref name="Copi 1995" /> composed of [[weakly interacting massive particles]] (WIMPs) that interact only through gravity and the [[weak interaction|weak force]]. Alternative explanations have been proposed, and there is not yet sufficient experimental evidence to determine whether any of them are correct. Many experiments to detect proposed dark matter particles through non-gravitational means are under way.<ref name="bertone hooper silk" />

One other theory suggests the existence of a “Hidden Valley”, a parallel world made of dark matter having very little in common with matter we know,<ref>[http://home.web.cern.ch/about/physics/dark-matter Dark matter].

According to observations of structures larger than [[star system]]s, as well as [[Big Bang]] cosmology interpreted under the [[Friedmann equations]] and the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]], dark matter accounts for 26.8% of the [[Mass-energy equivalence|mass-energy]] content of the [[observable universe]].

Though the theory of dark matter remains the most widely accepted theory to explain the anomalies in observed galactic rotation, some alternative theoretical approaches have been developed which broadly fall into the categories of modified gravitational laws and quantum gravitational laws.<ref>

== Baryonic and nonbaryonic dark matter ==
[[File:Fermi Observations of Dwarf Galaxies Provide New Insights on Dark Matter.ogv|thumb|[[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope|Fermi-LAT]] observations of dwarf galaxies provide new insights on dark matter.]]

There are three separate lines of evidence that suggest the majority of dark matter is not made of [[baryons]] (ordinary matter including [[proton]]s and [[neutrons]]):
* The theory of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]], which predicts the observed [[abundance of the chemical elements]],<ref>Achim Weiss, "[http://www.einstein-online.info/spotlights/BBN Big Bang Nucleosynthesis: Cooking up the first light elements]" in: Einstein Online Vol. 2 (2006), 1017</ref> predicts that baryonic matter accounts for around 4–5 percent of the [[w:simple:critical density|critical density]] of the universe. In contrast, evidence from [[large-scale structure of the universe|large-scale structure]] and other observations indicates that the total matter density is about 30% of the critical density.
* Large astronomical searches for [[gravitational microlensing]], including the MACHO, EROS and OGLE projects, have shown that only a small fraction of the dark matter in the [[Milky Way]] can be hiding in dark compact objects; the excluded range covers objects above half the Earth's mass up to 30 solar masses, excluding nearly all the plausible candidates.
* Detailed analysis of the small irregularities (anisotropies) in the [[cosmic microwave background]] observed by [[WMAP]] and [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] shows that around five-sixths of the total matter is in a form which does not interact significantly with ordinary matter or photons except through gravitational effects.

A small proportion of dark matter may be [[baryonic dark matter]]: astronomical bodies, such as [[massive compact halo object]]s, which are composed of ordinary matter but emit little or no electromagnetic radiation. The study of nucleosynthesis in the Big Bang gives an upper bound on the amount of baryonic matter in the universe,<ref>

Candidates for nonbaryonic dark matter are hypothetical particles such as [[axion]]s, or [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] particles; neutrinos can only form a small fraction of the dark matter, due to limits from [[large-scale structure of the universe|large-scale structure]] and high-redshift galaxies.<ref name="bertone merritt" /> Unlike baryonic dark matter, nonbaryonic dark matter does not contribute to the formation of the [[Chemical element|elements]] in the early universe ("[[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]]")<ref name="Copi 1995"/> and so its presence is revealed only via its gravitational attraction. In addition, if the particles of which it is composed are supersymmetric, they can undergo [[annihilation]] interactions with themselves, possibly resulting in observable by-products such as [[gamma rays]] and neutrinos ("indirect detection").<ref name="bertone merritt" >

Nonbaryonic dark matter is classified in terms of the mass of the particle(s) that is assumed to make it up, and/or the typical velocity dispersion of those particles (since more massive particles move more slowly). There are three prominent hypotheses on nonbaryonic dark matter, called [[cold dark matter]] (CDM), [[warm dark matter]] (WDM), and [[hot dark matter]] (HDM); some combination of these is also possible. The most widely discussed models for nonbaryonic dark matter are based on the cold dark matter hypothesis, and the corresponding particle is most commonly assumed to be a [[weakly interacting massive particle]] (WIMP). Hot dark matter may include (massive) neutrinos, but observations imply that only a small fraction of dark matter can be hot. Cold dark matter leads to a "bottom-up" formation of structure in the universe while hot dark matter would result in a "top-down" formation scenario; since the late 1990s, the latter has been ruled out by observations of high-redshift galaxies such as the [[Hubble Ultra-Deep Field]].<ref name="bertone hooper silk"/>

In 1933, the Swiss astrophysicist [[Fritz Zwicky]], who studied [[groups and clusters of galaxies|clusters of galaxies]] while working at the [[California Institute of Technology]], made a similar inference.<ref>

Zwicky estimated the cluster's total mass based on the motions of galaxies near its edge and compared that estimate to one based on the number of galaxies and total brightness of the cluster. He estimated that there was about 400 times more mass than was visually observable. The gravity effect of the visible galaxies in the cluster would be far too small for such fast orbits, unless there was mass hidden from visual observation. This is known as the "missing mass problem". Based on these conclusions, Zwicky inferred that there must be some non-visible form of matter which would provide enough mass and gravitation attraction to hold the cluster together. This was the first formal inference about the existence of dark matter.<ref name="autogenerated1">Some details of Zwicky's calculation and of more modern values are given in {{Citation | first = M. | last = Richmond | title = Using the virial theorem: the mass of a cluster of galaxies | url = http://spiff.rit.edu/classes/phys440/lectures/gal_clus/gal_clus.html | accessdate = 2007-07-10}}</ref>

}}</ref> Many of these appear to be fairly uniform, so by the [[virial theorem]], the total [[kinetic energy]] should be half the total [[gravitational binding energy]] of the galaxies. Observationally, however, the total kinetic energy is found to be much greater. In particular, assuming the [[gravitational mass]] is due to only the visible matter of the galaxy, stars far from the center of galaxies have much higher velocities than are predicted by the virial theorem. [[Galactic rotation curve]]s, which illustrate the velocity of rotation versus the distance from the galactic center, show the well known phenomenology that cannot be explained by the presence of the visible matter only. Assuming that the visible material makes up only a small part of the cluster's mass is the most straightforward way of accounting for this discrepancy. The distribution of dark matter in galaxies required to explain the motion of the observed baryonic matter suggests the presence of a roughly spherically symmetric, centrally concentrated [[Dark matter halo|halo]] of dark matter with the visible matter concentrated in a disc at the center. [[Low surface brightness galaxy|Low surface brightness dwarf galaxies]] are important sources of information for studying dark matter, as they have an uncommonly low ratio of visible matter to dark matter, and have few bright stars at the center which would otherwise impair observations of the rotation curve of outlying stars.

Gravitational lensing observations of galaxy clusters allow direct estimates of the gravitational mass based on its effect on light coming from background galaxies, since large collections of matter (dark or otherwise) will gravitationally deflect light. In clusters such as [[Abell 1689]], lensing observations confirm the presence of considerably more mass than is indicated by the clusters' light alone. In the [[Bullet Cluster]], lensing observations show that much of the lensing mass is separated from the X-ray-emitting baryonic mass. In July 2012, lensing observations were used to identify a "filament" of dark matter between two clusters of galaxies, as cosmological simulations have predicted.<ref name="Nature 2012" >

[[File:GalacticRotation2.svg|thumb|[[Galaxy rotation curve|Rotation curve]] of a typical spiral galaxy: predicted ('''A''') and observed ('''B'''). Dark matter can explain the 'flat' appearance of the velocity curve out to a large radius]]

The first robust indications that the [[mass to light ratio]] was anything other than unity came from measurements of galaxy rotation curves. In 1939, [[Horace W. Babcock]] reported in his PhD thesis measurements of the rotation curve for the Andromeda nebula which suggested that the mass-to-luminosity ratio increases radially.<ref>Babcock, H, 1939, "[http://ads.nao.ac.jp/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1939LicOB..19...41B&amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;type=PRINTER&amp;filetype=.pdf The rotation of the Andromeda Nebula]", Lick Observatory bulletin ; no. 498</ref> He, however, attributed it to either absorption of light within the galaxy or modified dynamics in the outer portions of the spiral and not to any form of missing matter.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, [[Vera Rubin]] was the first to both make robust measurements indicating the existence of dark matter and attribute them to dark matter. Rubin worked with a new sensitive [[spectrograph]] that could measure the [[galaxy rotation curve|velocity curve]] of edge-on [[spiral galaxies]] to a greater degree of accuracy than previously.<ref name="Rubin1970">

=== Galaxy clusters and gravitational lensing ===
[[File:Gravitationell-lins-4.jpg|thumb|Strong gravitational lensing as observed by the Hubble Space Telescope in [[Abell 1689]] indicates the presence of dark matter—enlarge the image to see the lensing arcs.]]

Galaxy clusters are especially important for dark matter studies since their masses can be estimated in three independent ways:
* From the scatter in radial velocities of the galaxies within the clusters (as in Zwicky's early observations, but with more accurate measurements and much larger samples).
* From [[X-rays]] emitted by very hot gas within the clusters. The temperature and density of the gas can be estimated from the energy and flux of the X-rays, and hence the gas pressure derived; assuming pressure and gravity balance, this enables the mass profile of the cluster to be derived. Many of the experiments of the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] use this technique to independently determine the mass of clusters. These observations generally indicate that baryonic mass is approximately 12–15 percent, in reasonable agreement with the [[Planck spacecraft]] cosmic average of 15.5–16 percent.<ref>

* From their [[gravitational lensing]] effects on background objects (usually more distant galaxies). This is observed as "strong lensing" (multiple images) near the cluster core, and [[weak lensing]] (shape distortions) in the outer parts. Several large [[Hubble space telescope|Hubble]] projects have used this method to measure cluster masses.

Generally these three methods are in reasonable agreement, that clusters contain much more matter than suggested by the visible components of galaxies and gas.

A gravitational lens is formed when the light from a more distant source (such as a [[quasar]]) is "bent" around a massive object (such as a [[galaxy cluster|cluster of galaxies]]) lying inline between the source object and the observer. The process is known as gravitational lensing.

The galaxy cluster [[Abell 2029]] is composed of thousands of galaxies enveloped in a cloud of hot gas, and an amount of dark matter equivalent to more than {{val|e=14|ul=solar mass}}. At the center of this cluster is an enormous, elliptically shaped galaxy that is thought to have been formed from the mergers of many smaller galaxies.<ref>

}}</ref> The measured orbital velocities of galaxies within galactic clusters have been found to be consistent with dark matter observations.

Another important tool for future dark matter observations is gravitational lensing. Lensing relies on the bending of light, as described by general relativity, to predict masses without relying on observations of the distant galaxies dynamics, and so is a completely independent means of measuring the dark matter. Strong lensing, the observed distortion of background galaxies into arcs when their light passes through such a gravitational lens, has been observed around a few distant clusters including [[Abell 1689]] (pictured).<ref>

In the Bullet Cluster however, a collision between two galaxy clusters appears to have caused a separation of dark matter and baryonic matter.

[[Electromagnetic force|Electromagnetic]] interactions between passing gas particles caused them to slow and settle near the point of impact of those galaxies. However, weak gravitational lensing observations of the same system show that much of the mass resides outside of the central region of baryonic gas. Because dark matter does not interact by electromagnetic forces, it would not have been slowed as the X-ray visible gas, so the dark matter components of the two clusters passed through each other without slowing substantially, throwing the dark matter further out than that of the baryonic gas. This accounts for the separation. Unlike the galactic rotation curves, this evidence for dark matter is independent of the details of [[Newtonian gravity]], so it is claimed to be direct evidence of the existence of dark matter.<ref name=Clowe>

Dark matter is crucial to the [[Big Bang]] model of cosmology as a component which corresponds directly to measurements of the [[Lambda-CDM model|parameters]] associated with [[FRW metric|Friedmann cosmology]] solutions to general relativity. In particular, measurements of the [[cosmic microwave background]] anisotropies correspond to a cosmology where much of the matter interacts with [[photons]] more weakly than the known [[four fundamental forces|forces]] that couple light interactions to baryonic matter. Likewise, a significant amount of non-[[baryon]]ic, cold matter is necessary to explain the [[Large-scale structure of the cosmos|large-scale structure of the universe]].

Observations suggest that [[structure formation]] in the universe proceeds hierarchically, with the smallest structures collapsing first and followed by galaxies and then clusters of galaxies. As the structures collapse in the evolving universe, they begin to "light up" as the baryonic matter heats up through gravitational contraction and approaches [[hydrostatic equilibrium|hydrostatic pressure balance]]. Originally, baryonic matter had too high a temperature, and pressure left over from the Big Bang to allow collapse and form smaller structures, such as stars, via the [[Jeans instability]]. Dark matter acts as a compactor allowing the creation of structure where there would not have been any. This model not only corresponds with statistical surveying of the visible structure in the universe but also corresponds precisely to the dark matter predictions of the cosmic microwave background.

This ''bottom up'' model of structure formation requires something like cold dark matter to succeed. Large computer simulations of billions of dark matter particles have been used<ref>

The recent discovery of the structure of [[Laniakea Supercluster|Laniakea]], a 500 million light year structure is currently the limit to structural formation in the universe.

== History of the search for its composition ==
{{unsolved|physics|What is dark matter? How is it generated? Is it related to [[supersymmetry]]?}}

Although dark matter had historically been inferred from many astronomical observations, its composition long remained speculative. Early theories of dark matter concentrated on hidden heavy normal objects (such as black holes, neutron stars, faint old white dwarfs, and brown dwarfs) as the possible candidates for dark matter, collectively known as massive compact halo objects or [[MACHOs]]. Astronomical surveys for gravitational [[microlensing]], including the MACHO, EROS and OGLE projects, along with Hubble telescope searches for ultra-faint stars, have not found enough of these hidden MACHOs.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Tisserand | first1 = P. | last2 = Le Guillou | first2 = L. | last3 = Afonso | first3 = C. | last4 = Albert | first4 = J.

Furthermore, data from a number of lines of other evidence, including [[galaxy rotation problem|galaxy rotation curves]], gravitational lensing, structure formation, and the fraction of baryons in clusters and the cluster abundance combined with independent evidence for the baryon density, indicated that 85–90% of the mass in the universe does not interact with the [[electromagnetic force]]. This "nonbaryonic dark matter" is evident through its gravitational effect. Consequently, the most commonly held view was that dark matter is primarily non-baryonic, made of one or more elementary particles other than the usual [[electron]]s, [[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s, and known [[neutrino]]s. The most commonly proposed particles then became [[Weakly interacting massive particles|WIMPs]] (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, including [[neutralino]]s), [[axion]]s, or sterile neutrinos, though many other possible candidates have been proposed.

Dark matter candidates can be divided into three classes, called
''cold'', ''warm'' and ''hot'' dark matter.<ref>{{Cite book

These categories do not correspond to an actual temperature, but instead refer to how fast the particles were moving, thus how far they moved due to random motions in the early universe, before they slowed due to the expansion of the universe&nbsp;– this is an important distance called the "free streaming length". Primordial density fluctuations smaller than this free-streaming length get washed out as particles move from overdense to underdense regions, while fluctuations larger than the free-streaming length are unaffected; therefore this free-streaming length sets a minimum scale for structure formation.

Though a fourth category had been considered early on, called [[mixed dark matter]], it was quickly eliminated (from the 1990s) since the discovery of [[dark energy]].

As an example, Davis ''et al.'' wrote in 1985:

{{quote|Candidate particles can be grouped into three categories on the basis of their effect on the [[Mixed dark matter|fluctuation spectrum]] (Bond ''et al.'' 1983). If the dark matter is composed of abundant light particles which remain relativistic until shortly before recombination, then it may be termed "hot". The best candidate for hot dark matter is a neutrino ... A second possibility is for the dark matter particles to interact more weakly than neutrinos, to be less abundant, and to have a mass of order 1&nbsp;keV. Such particles are termed "warm dark matter", because they have lower thermal velocities than massive neutrinos ... there are at present few candidate particles which fit this description. [[Gravitino]]s and [[photino]]s have been suggested (Pagels and Primack 1982; Bond, Szalay and Turner 1982) ... Any particles which became nonrelativistic very early, and so were able to diffuse a negligible distance, are termed "cold" dark matter (CDM). There are many candidates for CDM including supersymmetric particles.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1 = Davis|first1 = M.|author2= Efstathiou, G., Frenk, C. S., & White, S. D.

The full calculations are quite technical, but an approximate dividing line is that "warm" dark matter particles became non-relativistic when the universe was approximately 1 year old and 1 millionth of its present size; standard hot [[big bang]] theory implies the universe was then in the [[radiation-dominated era]] (photons and neutrinos), with a photon temperature 2.7 million K. Standard physical cosmology gives the [[particle horizon]] size as 2ct in the radiation-dominated era, thus 2 light-years, and a region of this size would expand to 2 million light years today (if there were no structure formation). The actual free-streaming length is roughly 5 times larger than the above length, since the free-streaming length continues to grow slowly as particle velocities decrease inversely with the scale factor after they become non-relativistic; therefore, in this example the free-streaming length would correspond to 10 million light-years or 3 Mpc today, which is around the size containing on average the mass of a large galaxy.

The above temperature of 2.7 million K gives a typical photon energy of 250 electron-volts, thereby setting a typical mass scale for "warm" dark matter: particles much more massive than this, such as GeV&nbsp;– TeV mass [[WIMPs]], would become non-relativistic much earlier than 1 year after the Big Bang and thus have a free-streaming length much smaller than a proto-galaxy, making them cold dark matter. Conversely, much lighter particles, such as neutrinos with masses of only a few eV, have a free-streaming length much larger than a proto-galaxy, thus making them hot dark matter.

=== Cold dark matter ===
{{Main|Cold dark matter}}

Today, cold dark matter is the simplest explanation for most cosmological observations. "Cold" dark matter is dark matter composed of constituents with a free-streaming length much smaller than the ancestor of a galaxy-scale perturbation. This is currently the area of greatest interest for dark matter research, as hot dark matter does not seem to be viable for galaxy and galaxy cluster formation, and most particle candidates become non-relativistic at very early times, hence are classified as cold.

The composition of the constituents of cold dark matter is currently unknown. Possibilities range from large objects like MACHOs (such as black holes<ref name=Hawkins>{{Cite journal | last1 = Hawkins | first1 = M. R.

The [[DAMA/NaI]] experiment and its successor [[DAMA/LIBRA]] have claimed to directly detect dark matter particles passing through the Earth, but many scientists remain skeptical, as negative results from similar experiments seem incompatible with the DAMA results.

Many [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] models naturally give rise to stable dark matter candidates in the form of the [[Lightest Supersymmetric Particle]] (LSP). Separately, heavy sterile neutrinos exist in non-supersymmetric extensions to the standard model that explain the small [[neutrino mass]] through the [[seesaw mechanism]].

=== Warm dark matter ===
{{Main|Warm dark matter}}
{{refimprove|reason=Some sections have no citations at all.|date=August 2015}}

Warm dark matter refers to particles with a free-streaming length comparable to the size of a region which subsequently evolved into a dwarf galaxy. This leads to predictions which are very similar to cold dark matter on large scales, including the CMB, galaxy clustering and large galaxy rotation curves, but with less small-scale density perturbations. This reduces the predicted abundance of dwarf galaxies and may lead to lower density of dark matter in the central parts of large galaxies; some researchers consider this may be a better fit to observations. A challenge for this model is that there are no very well-motivated particle physics candidates with the required mass ~ 300 eV to 3000 eV.

There have been no particles discovered so far that can be categorized as warm dark matter. There is a postulated candidate for the warm dark matter category, which is the [[sterile neutrino]]: a heavier, slower form of neutrino which does not even interact through the [[Weak force]] unlike regular neutrinos. Interestingly, some modified gravity theories, such as [[Scalar-tensor-vector gravity]], also require that a warm dark matter exist to make their equations work out.

=== Hot dark matter ===
{{Main|Hot dark matter}}

Hot dark matter consists of particles that have a free-streaming length much larger than that of a proto-galaxy.

An example of hot dark matter is already known: the [[neutrino]]. Neutrinos were discovered quite separately from the search for dark matter, and long before it seriously began: they were first postulated in 1930, and [[Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment|first detected]] in 1956. Neutrinos have a very small [[Neutrino mass|mass]]: at least 100,000&nbsp;times less massive than an electron. Other than gravity, neutrinos only interact with normal matter via the [[Weak interaction|weak force]] making them very difficult to detect (the weak force only works over a small distance, thus a neutrino will only trigger a weak force event if it hits a nucleus directly head-on). This would make them 'weakly interacting light particles' (WILPs), as opposed to cold dark matter's theoretical candidates, the [[weakly interacting massive particles]] (WIMPs).

There are three different known flavors of neutrinos (i.e., the ''electron'', ''muon'', and ''tau'' neutrinos), and their masses are slightly different. The resolution to the [[solar neutrino problem]] demonstrated that these three types of neutrinos actually change and oscillate from one flavor to the others and back as they are in-flight. It is hard to determine an exact [[upper bound]] on the collective average mass of the three neutrinos (let alone a mass for any of the three individually). For example, if the average neutrino mass were chosen to be over 50 ''eV/c''<sup>2</sup> (which is still less than 1/10,000th of the mass of an electron), just by the sheer number of them in the universe, the universe would collapse due to their mass. So other observations have served to estimate an upper-bound for the [[neutrino mass]]. Using [[cosmic microwave background]] data and other methods, the current conclusion is that their average mass probably does not exceed 0.3 ''eV/c''<sup>2</sup> Thus, the normal forms of neutrinos cannot be responsible for the measured dark matter component from cosmology.<ref>{{cite web

Hot dark matter was popular for a time in the early 1980s, but it suffers from a severe problem: because all galaxy-size density fluctuations get washed out by free-streaming, the first objects that can form are huge supercluster-size pancakes, which then were theorised somehow to fragment into galaxies. [[List of Deep Fields|Deep-field observations]] clearly show that galaxies formed at early times, with clusters and superclusters forming later as galaxies clump together, so any model dominated by hot dark matter is seriously in conflict with observations.

=== Mixed dark matter ===
{{Main|Mixed dark matter}}

Mixed dark matter is a now obsolete model, with a specifically chosen mass ratio of 80% cold dark matter and 20% hot dark matter (neutrinos) content. Though it is presumable that hot dark matter coexists with cold dark matter in any case, there was a very specific reason for choosing this particular ratio of hot to cold dark matter in this model.
During the early 1990s it became steadily clear that a universe with critical density of
cold dark matter did not fit the COBE and large-scale galaxy clustering observations; either the 80/20 mixed dark matter model, or LambdaCDM, were able to reconcile these. With the discovery of the accelerating universe from supernovae, and more accurate measurements of CMB anisotropy and galaxy clustering, the mixed dark matter model was essentially ruled out while the concordance LambdaCDM model remained a good fit.

== Detection ==

If the dark matter within the Milky Way is made up of [[Weakly Interacting Massive Particle]]s (WIMPs), then millions, possibly billions, of WIMPs must pass through every square centimeter of the Earth each second.<ref name="Gaitskell 2004">{{cite journal

There are many experiments currently running, or planned, aiming to test this hypothesis by searching for WIMPs. Although WIMPs are the historically more popular dark matter candidate for searches,<ref name="bertone hooper silk" /> there are experiments searching for other particle candidates; the Axion Dark Matter eXperiment ([[ADMX]]) is currently searching for the dark matter [[axion]], a well-motivated and constrained dark matter source. It is also possible that dark matter consists of very heavy [[hidden sector]] particles which only interact with ordinary matter via gravity.

These experiments can be divided into two classes: direct detection experiments, which search for the scattering of dark matter particles off atomic nuclei within a detector; and indirect detection, which look for the products of WIMP annihilations.<ref name="bertone merritt" />

An alternative approach to the detection of WIMPs in nature is to produce them in the laboratory. Experiments with the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) may be able to detect WIMPs produced in collisions of the LHC [[proton]] beams. Because a WIMP has negligible interactions with matter, it may be detected indirectly as (large amounts of) missing energy and momentum which escape the LHC detectors, provided all the other (non-negligible) collision products are detected.<ref name="kane watson">

=== Direct detection experiments ===

Direct detection experiments usually operate in deep underground laboratories to reduce the background from cosmic rays. These include: the Stawell mine (Australia); the [[Soudan mine]]; the [[SNOLAB]] underground laboratory at [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], Ontario (Canada); the [[Gran Sasso National Laboratory]] (Italy); the [[Canfranc Underground Laboratory]] (Spain); the [[Boulby Underground Laboratory]] (United Kingdom); the [[Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory]], South Dakota (United States); and the [[Particle and Astrophysical Xenon Detector]] (China).

The majority of present experiments use one of two detector technologies: cryogenic detectors, operating at temperatures below 100mK, detect the heat produced when a particle hits an atom in a [[crystal]] absorber such as [[germanium]]. [[Noble gas|Noble liquid]] detectors detect the flash of [[scintillation (physics)|scintillation]] light produced by a particle collision in liquid [[xenon]] or [[argon]]. Cryogenic detector experiments include: [[Cryogenic Dark Matter Search|CDMS]], [[Cryogenic Rare Event Search with Superconducting Thermometers|CRESST]], [[EDELWEISS]], [[European Underground Rare Event Calorimeter Array|EURECA]]. Noble liquid experiments include ZEPLIN, [[XENON]], [[DEAP]], [[ArDM]], [[WIMP Argon Programme|WARP]], [[DarkSide]], [[PandaX]], and LUX, the [[Large Underground Xenon experiment]]. Both of these detector techniques are capable of distinguishing background particles which scatter off electrons, from dark matter particles which scatter off nuclei. Other experiments include [[SIMPLE (dark matter)|SIMPLE]] and [[PICASSO (dark matter)|PICASSO]].

By using a low pressure [[Time projection chamber|TPC]], it is possible to access information on recoiling tracks (3D reconstruction if possible) and to constrain the WIMP-nucleus kinematics. WIMPs coming from the direction in which the Sun is travelling (roughly in the direction of the Cygnus constellation) may then be separated from background noise, which should be isotropic. Directional dark matter experiments include [[Dark Matter Time Projection Chamber|DMTPC]], [[Directional Recoil Identification From Tracks|DRIFT]], Newage and MIMAC.

On 17 December 2009, CDMS researchers reported two possible WIMP candidate events. They estimate that the probability that these events are due to a known background (neutrons or misidentified beta or gamma events) is 23%, and conclude "this analysis cannot be interpreted as significant evidence for WIMP interactions, but we cannot reject either event as signal."<ref>{{Cite journal

Indirect detection experiments search for the products of WIMP annihilation or decay. If WIMPs are [[Majorana fermion|Majorana particles]] (WIMPs are their own antiparticle) then two WIMPs could [[annihilate]] to produce [[gamma rays]] or Standard Model particle-antiparticle pairs. Additionally, if the WIMP is unstable, WIMPs could decay into standard model particles. These processes could be detected indirectly through an excess of gamma rays, [[antiproton]]s or [[positron]]s emanating from regions of high dark matter density. The detection of such a signal is not conclusive evidence for dark matter, as the production of gamma rays from other sources is not fully understood.<ref name="bertone hooper silk" /><ref name="bertone merritt" />

A few of the WIMPs passing through the [[Sun]] or [[Earth]] may scatter off atoms and lose energy. This way a large population of WIMPs may accumulate at the center of these bodies, increasing the chance that two will collide and annihilate. This could produce a distinctive signal in the form of high-energy [[neutrino]]s originating from the center of the Sun or Earth.<ref>{{Cite journal

WIMP annihilation from the Milky Way Galaxy as a whole may also be detected in the form of various annihilation products.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = J. | last2 = Flores | first2 = R.

== Alternative theories ==

=== Mass in extra dimensions ===

In some multidimensional theories, the force of gravity is the unique force able to have an effect across all the various extra dimensions,<ref name="home.web.cern.ch"/> which would explain the relative weakness of the force of gravity compared to the other known forces of nature that would not be able to cross into extra dimensions: electromagnetism, strong interaction, and weak interaction.

In that case, dark matter would be a perfect candidate for matter that would exist in other dimensions and that could only interact with the matter on our dimensions through gravity. That dark matter located on different dimensions could potentially aggregate in the same way as the matter in our visible universe does, forming exotic galaxies.<ref name="Siegfried"/>

=== Topological defects ===

Dark matter could consist of primordial defects (defects originating with the birth of the universe) in the [[topology]] of quantum fields, which would contain energy and therefore gravitate. This possibility may be investigated by the use of an orbital network of atomic clocks, which would register the passage of topological defects by monitoring the synchronization of the clocks. The [[Global Positioning System]] may be able to operate as such a network.<ref name="rzetelny">{{cite web|last1=Rzetelny|first1=Xaq|title=Looking for a different sort of dark matter with GPS satellites|url=http://www.arstechnica.com/science/2014/11/looking-for-a-different-sort-of-dark-matter-with-gps-satellites/#p3|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=24 November 2014|date=19 November 2014}}</ref>

=== Modified gravity ===

Numerous alternative theories have been proposed to explain these observations without the need for a large amount of undetected matter. Most of these theories modify the laws of gravity established by Newton and Einstein.

The earliest modified gravity model to emerge was [[Mordehai Milgrom]]'s [[Modified Newtonian Dynamics]] (MOND) in 1983, which adjusts [[Newton's laws]] to create a stronger gravitational field when gravitational acceleration levels become tiny (such as near the rim of a galaxy). It had some success explaining galactic-scale features, such as rotational velocity curves of elliptical galaxies, and dwarf elliptical galaxies, but did not successfully explain galaxy cluster gravitational lensing. However, MOND was not [[theory of relativity|relativistic]], since it was just a straight adjustment of the older Newtonian account of gravitation, not of the newer account in Einstein's [[general relativity]]. Soon after 1983, attempts were made to bring MOND into conformity with general relativity; this is an ongoing process, and many competing hypotheses have emerged based around the original MOND model—including [[TeVeS]], [[Scalar–tensor–vector gravity|MOG or STV gravity]], and phenomenological covariant approach,<ref>{{cite journal

In 2007, [[John Moffat (physicist)|John W. Moffat]] proposed a modified gravity hypothesis based on the [[nonsymmetric gravitational theory]] (NGT) that claims to account for the behavior of colliding galaxies.<ref>{{Cite journal

 |first2=J. W.
 |bibcode=2007MNRAS.382...29B}}</ref> This model requires the presence of non-relativistic neutrinos, or other candidates for (cold) dark matter, to work.

Another proposal uses a gravitational [[backreaction]] in an emerging theoretical field that seeks to explain gravity between objects as an action, a reaction, and then a back-reaction. Simply, an object A affects an object B, and the object B then re-affects object A, and so on: creating a sort of feedback loop that strengthens gravity.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.79.084029| title = Gravitational backreaction in cosmological spacetimes| year = 2009| last1 = Anastopoulos | first1 = C.| journal = Physical Review D| volume = 79| issue = 8| page = 084029| arxiv = 0902.0159|bibcode = 2009PhRvD..79h4029A }}</ref>

In 2008, another group has proposed a modification of large-scale gravity in a hypothesis named "[[dark fluid]]". In this formulation, the attractive gravitational effects attributed to dark matter are instead a side-effect of [[dark energy]]. Dark fluid combines dark matter and [[dark energy]] in a single energy field that produces different effects at different scales. This treatment is a simplified approach to a previous [[fluid]]-like model called the generalized [[Chaplygin gas]] model where the whole of spacetime is a compressible gas.<ref name="space.com">{{cite web

In the same way, the dark fluid might generally expand, but it also could collect around galaxies to help hold them together.<ref name="space.com"/>

Another set of proposals is based on the possibility of a double [[metric tensor]] for space-time.<ref>{{Cite journal

=== Fractality of Spacetime ===

Applying relativity to fractal non-differentiable spacetime, [[Laurent Nottale]], in his [[Scale Relativity]] theory, suggests that potential energy arises due to the fractality of space, and accounts for the missing mass-energy observed at cosmological scales.{{cn|date=August 2015}}

== Popular culture ==
{{Main|Dark matter in fiction}}

Mention of dark matter is made in some video games and other works of fiction. In such cases, it is usually attributed extraordinary physical or magical properties. Such descriptions are often inconsistent with the properties of dark matter proposed in physics and cosmology.
