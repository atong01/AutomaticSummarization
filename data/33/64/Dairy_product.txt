A '''dairy product''' or ''milk product'' is food produced from the [[milk]] of [[mammals]].<ref>[http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/publication/understandfoodlabellingterms.pdf]  {{wayback|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/publication/understandfoodlabellingterms.pdf |date=20140429162158 }}</ref> Dairy products are usually high energy-yielding food products. A production plant for the processing of milk is called a [[dairy]] or a dairy factory. Apart from breastfed infants, the human consumption of dairy products is sourced primarily from the milk of [[cattle|cows]], [[water buffaloes]], [[dairy goat|goats]], [[domestic sheep|sheep]], [[yak]]s, [[horse]]s, [[camel]]s, domestic buffaloes, and other mammals. Dairy products are commonly found in [[European cuisine|European]], [[Middle Eastern cuisine|Middle Eastern]], and [[Indian cuisine]], whereas aside from [[Mongolian cuisine]]<ref>Tibetan cuisine has a use for yak milk which is eaten as rancid butter.</ref> they are little-known in traditional [[East Asian cuisine]].

==Health==
Dairy products can cause health issues for individuals who have [[lactose intolerance]] or a [[milk allergy]].{{cn|date=June 2014}}

Additionally dairy products including cheese, ice cream, milk, butter, and yogurt can contribute significant amounts of cholesterol and saturated fat to the diet.  Diets high in fat and especially in saturated fat can increase the risk of heart disease and can cause other serious health problems.{{cn|date=April 2015}}

==Avoidance==
Some groups avoid dairy products for non-health related reasons:
* Religious - Some religions restrict or do not allow for the consumption of dairy products. For example, some scholars of [[Jain vegetarianism|Jainism]] advocate not consuming any dairy products because dairy is perceived to involve violence against cows. Strict [[Kosher|Judaism]] requires that meat and dairy products not be served at the same meal, served or cooked in the same utensils, or stored together, as prescribed in {{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|14:21}}.{{npsn|date=June 2014}}
* Ethical - [[Veganism]] is the avoidance of all animal products, including dairy products, most often due to the ethics regarding how dairy products are produced. The [[Ethics of eating meat|ethical reasons for avoiding dairy]] include how dairy is produced, how the animals are handled, and the environmental effect of dairy production.{{cn|date=June 2014}}
