In America a distinction is drawn between ballads that are versions of European, particularly British and Irish songs, and 'native American ballads', developed without reference to earlier songs. A further development was the evolution of the blues ballad, which mixed the genre with Afro-American music. For the late 19th century the music publishing industry found a market for what are often termed sentimental ballads, and these are the origin of the modern use of the term 'ballad' to mean a slow love song.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Traditional ballads</heading><paragraph><template><target>See also</target><arg>Child Ballads</arg></template>The traditional, classical or popular (meaning of the people) ballad has been seen as beginning with the wandering<space/><link><target>minstrels</target></link><space/>of late medieval Europe.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Houseman1952"></extension><space/>From the end of the 15th century there are printed ballads that suggest a rich tradition of popular music.
