'''Eschatology''' {{IPAc-en|audio=En-uk-eschatology.ogg|ˌ|ɛ|s|k|ə|ˈ|t|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}} is a part of [[theology]] concerned with the final events of [[history of the world|history]], or the ultimate [[destiny]] of humanity. This concept is commonly referred to as the "end of the world" or "[[end time]]".

The word arises from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:ἔσχατος|ἔσχατος]]}} ''eschatos'' meaning "last" and ''[[-logy]]'' meaning "the study of", first used in English around 1550.<ref>[http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/es/eschatology.html Dictionary - Definition of Eschatology] Webster's Online Dictionary</ref> The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] defines eschatology as "The department of theological science concerned with ‘the four last things: [[death]], [[Divine judgment|judgment]], [[heaven]] and [[hell]]’."<ref>"Eschatology, ''n.''", def. a, ''Oxford English Dictionary'', accessed 2012-01-29.</ref> 

In the context of [[mysticism]], the phrase refers metaphorically to the end of ordinary reality and reunion with the Divine. In many [[religion]]s it is taught as an existing future event [[prophecy|prophesied]] in [[sacred text]]s or [[folklore]]. More broadly, eschatology may encompass related concepts such as the [[Messiah]] or [[Messianic Age]], the [[end time]], and the end of days.

History is often divided into "ages" ([[aeons]]), which are time periods each with certain commonalities. One age comes to an end and a new age or [[world to come]], where different realities are present, begins. When such transitions from one age to another are the subject of eschatological discussion, the phrase, "end of the world", is replaced by "end of the age", "end of an era", or "end of life as we know it". Much [[apocalyptic fiction]] does not deal with the "end of time" but rather with the end of a certain period of time, the end of life as it is now, and the beginning of a new period of time. It is usually a crisis that brings an end to current reality and ushers in a new way of living, thinking, or being. This crisis may take the form of the intervention of a deity in history, a war, a change in the environment, or the reaching of a new level of consciousness.

Most modern eschatology and [[apocalypticism]], both religious and secular, involve the violent disruption or destruction of the world; whereas Christian and Jewish eschatologies view the end times as the consummation or perfection of God's creation of the world. For example, according to ancient Hebrew belief, life takes a linear (and not cyclical) path; the world began with God and is constantly headed toward God’s final goal for creation, which is the [[world to come]].

Eschatologies vary as to their degree of optimism or pessimism about the future. In some eschatologies, conditions are better for some and worse for others, e.g. "heaven and hell".

===Christianity===
{{Christian eschatology}}
{{main|Christian eschatology}}

Christian eschatology is concerned with death, an [[intermediate state]], [[Heaven]], [[hell]], the [[Second Coming|return of Jesus]], and the [[resurrection of the dead]]. Several evangelical denominations include a [[rapture]], a [[tribulation|great tribulation]], the [[Millennialism|Millennium]], [[End of the world (religion)|end of the world]], the [[last judgment]], a new heaven and a [[The New Earth|new earth]] (the [[World to Come]]), and the ultimate consummation of all of God's purposes. Eschatological passages are found in many places, esp. ''[[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]]'', ''[[Book of Daniel|Daniel]]'', ''[[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]]'', ''[[Matthew 24]]'', ''[[The Sheep and the Goats]]'', and the ''[[Book of Revelation]]'', but ''Revelation'' often occupies a central place in Christian eschatology.

The [[Second Coming]] of Christ is the central event in Christian eschatology. Most Christians believe that death and suffering will continue to exist until Christ's return. There are, however, various views concerning the order and significance of other eschatological events.

The book of ''Revelation'' is at the core of Christian eschatology. The study of ''Revelation'' is usually divided into four approaches. In the [[Futurism (Christian eschatology)|Futurist]] approach, ''Revelation'' is chiefly seen as referring to events which as yet have not come to pass, but which will come to pass at the end of the age, and the end of the world. This is the approach which most applies to eschatological studies. In the [[Preterism|Preterist]] approach, ''Revelation'' chiefly refers to the events of the first century, such as the struggle of Christianity to survive the persecutions of the Roman Empire, the fall of Jerusalem in 70 AD, and the desecration of the temple in the same year. In the [[Historicism (Christian eschatology)|Historicist]] approach, ''Revelation'' provides a broad view of history, and passages in ''Revelation'' are identified with major historical people and events. In the [[Idealism (Christian eschatology)|Idealist]] (or Spiritualist or Symbolic) approach, the events of ''Revelation'' are neither past nor future, but are purely symbolic, dealing with the ongoing struggle and ultimate triumph of good over evil.

===Hinduism===
{{main|Hindu eschatology}}

Contemporary Hindu eschatology is linked in the [[Vaishnavite]] tradition to the figure of [[Kalki]], the tenth and last [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]] before the age draws to a close who will reincarnate as [[Shiva]] simultaneously dissolves and regenerates the universe.

Most Hindus believe that the current period is the [[Kali Yuga]], the last of four ''Yuga'' that make up the current age. Each period has seen successive degeneration in the moral order, to the point that in the Kali Yuga quarrel and hypocrisy are the norm. In Hinduism, time is cyclic, consisting of cycles or "[[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpas]]". Each kalpa lasts 4.1 - 8.2 billion years, which is a period of one full day and night for [[Brahma]], who in turn will live for 311 trillion, 40 billion years. The cycle of [[Brahma|birth]], [[Vishnu|growth]], [[Shiva|decay]], and renewal at the individual level finds its echo in the cosmic order, yet is affected by vagaries of divine intervention in Vaishnavite belief. Some Shaivites hold the view that Shiva is incessantly destroying and creating the world.

After this larger cycle, all of creation will contract to a [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]] and then again will expand from that single point, as the [[yuga|ages]] continue in a religious [[fractal]] pattern.<ref name="Hooper">{{cite book|last = Hooper| first= Rev.

==== Signs preceding the Day of Judgement in the Qur'an ====
The best source of information is the Qur'an which describes the following Signs preceding the Day of Judgement:

# Splitting of the Moon 54:1<ref>{{Cite quran|54|1|s=ns}}</ref>
# Smoke 44:10<ref>{{Cite quran|44|10|s=ns}}</ref>
# [[Beast of the Earth]] 27:82<ref>{{Cite quran|27|82|s=ns}}</ref>

==== According to the other sources ====

[[Islamic eschatology]] is documented in the [[Hadith|sayings]] of the [[Prophet of Islam|Prophet]] [[Muhammad]], regarding the Signs of the Day of Judgment. The Prophet's sayings on the subject have been traditionally divided into Major and Minor Signs. He spoke about several Minor Signs of the approach of the Day of Judgment, including:
* [[Abu Hurairah]] reported that [[Muhammad]] said: "If you survive for a time you would certainly see people who would have whips in their hands like the tail of an ox. They would get up in the morning under the wrath of God and they would go into the evening with the anger of God."{{cn|date=August 2015}}
* [[Abu Hurairah]] narrated that Muhammad said, "When honesty is lost, then wait for the Day of Judgment." It was asked, "How will honesty be lost, O Messenger of God?" He said, "When authority is given to those who do not deserve it, then wait for the Day of Judgment."{{cn|date=August 2015}}
* [[Umar|'Umar ibn al-Khattāb]], in a long narration, relating to the questions of the angel [[Gabriel#Islamic references|Gabriel]], reported: "Inform me when the Day of Judgment will be." He [the Prophet Muhammad] remarked: "The one who is being asked knows no more than the inquirer." He [the inquirer] said: "Tell me about its indications." He [the Prophet Muhammad] said: "That the slave-girl gives birth to her mistress and master, and that you would find barefooted, destitute shepherds of goats vying with one another in the construction of magnificent buildings."{{cn|date=August 2015}}
* "Before the Day of Judgment there will be great liars, so beware of them."{{cn|date=August 2015}}
* "When the most wicked member of a tribe becomes its ruler, and the most worthless member of a community becomes its leader, and a man is respected through fear of the evil he may do, and leadership is given to people who are unworthy of it, expect the Day of Judgment."{{cn|date=August 2015}}

Regarding the Major Signs, a [[Sahaba|Companion of the Prophet]] narrated: "Once we were sitting together and talking amongst ourselves when the Prophet appeared. He asked us what it was we were discussing. We said it was the Day of Judgment. He said: 'It will not be called until ten signs have appeared: Smoke, [[Dajjal]] (the [[Antichrist]]), the creature (that will wound the people), the rising of the sun in the West, the [[Second Coming#Islam|Second Coming]] of [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]], the emergence of [[Gog and Magog#Qur'an|Gog and Magog]], and three sinkings (or cavings in of the earth): one in the East, another in the West and a third in the [[Arabian Peninsula]].'" (note: the previous events were not listed in the chronological order of appearance){{cn|date=August 2015}}
