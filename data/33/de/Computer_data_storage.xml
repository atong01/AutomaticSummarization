It is a core function and fundamental component of computers.</paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>central processing unit</target></link><space/>(CPU) of a computer is what manipulates data by performing computations. In practice, almost all computers use a<space/><link><target>memory hierarchy</target><part>storage hierarchy</part></link>, which puts fast but expensive and small storage options close to the CPU and slower but larger and cheaper options farther away. Often the fast volatile technologies (which lose data when powered off) are referred to as &quot;memory&quot;, while slower persistent technologies are referred to as &quot;storage&quot;; however, &quot;memory&quot; is sometimes also used when referring to persistent storage.</paragraph><paragraph>In the<space/><link><target>Von Neumann architecture</target></link>, the CPU consists of two main parts:<space/><link><target>control unit</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>arithmetic logic unit</target></link><space/>(ALU). The former controls the flow of data between the CPU and memory, while the latter performs arithmetic and logical operations on data.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Functionality</heading><paragraph>Without a significant amount of memory, a computer would merely be able to perform fixed operations and immediately output the result. It would have to be reconfigured to change its behavior. This is acceptable for devices such as desk<space/><link><target>calculator</target><trail>s</trail></link>,<space/><link><target>digital signal processing</target><part>digital signal processors</part></link>, and other specialized devices.<space/><link><target>von Neumann architecture</target><part>Von Neumann</part></link><space/>machines differ in having a memory in which they store their operating<space/><link><target>instruction (computer science)</target><part>instruction</part><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and data. Such computers are more versatile in that they do not need to have their hardware reconfigured for each new program, but can simply be<space/><link><target>computer programming</target><part>reprogrammed</part></link><space/>with new in-memory instructions; they also tend to be simpler to design, in that a relatively simple processor may keep<space/><link><target>program state</target><part>state</part></link><space/>between successive computations to build up complex procedural results.

Text, numbers, pictures, audio, and nearly any other form of information can be converted into a string of<space/><link><target>bit</target><trail>s</trail></link>, or binary digits, each of which has a value of 1 or 0. The most common unit of storage is the<space/><link><target>byte</target></link>, equal to 8 bits. A piece of information can be handled by any computer or device whose storage space is large enough to accommodate<space/><italics>the binary representation of the piece of information</italics>, or simply<space/><link><target>data (computing)</target><part>data</part></link>. For example, the<space/><link><target>complete works of Shakespeare</target></link>, about 1250 pages in print, can be stored in about five<space/><link><target>megabyte</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>(40 million bits) with one byte per character.<space/></paragraph><paragraph>Data is<space/><link><target>Encoding</target><part>encoded</part></link><space/>by assigning a bit pattern to each<space/><link><target>Character (computing)</target><part>character</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Numerical digit</target><part>digit</part></link>, or<space/><link><target>multimedia</target></link><space/>object.

Errors occur regularly in low probabilities due to<space/><link><target>random</target></link><space/>bit value flipping, or &quot;physical bit fatigue&quot;, loss of the physical bit in storage its ability to maintain distinguishable value (0 or 1), or due to errors in inter or intra-computer communication. A random bit flip (e.g., due to random<space/><link><target>radiation</target></link>) is typically corrected upon detection. A bit, or a group of malfunctioning physical bits (not always the specific defective bit is known; group definition depends on specific storage device) is typically automatically fenced-out, taken out of use by the device, and replaced with another functioning equivalent group in the device, where the corrected bit values are restored (if possible). The<space/><link><target>cyclic redundancy check</target></link><space/>(CRC) method is typically used in communications and storage for<space/><link><target>error detection and correction</target><part>error detection</part></link>. A detected error is then retried.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Data compression</target></link><space/>methods allow in many cases to represent a string of bits by a shorter bit string (&quot;compress&quot;) and reconstruct the original string (&quot;decompress&quot;) when needed. This utilizes substantially less storage (tens of percents) for many types of data at the cost of more computation (compress and decompress when needed). Analysis of trade-off between storage cost saving and costs of related computations and possible delays in data availability is done before deciding whether to keep certain data in a database compressed or not.</paragraph><paragraph>For<space/><link><target>data security</target><part>security reasons</part></link><space/>certain types of data (e.g., credit-card information) may be kept<space/><link><target>encryption</target><part>encrypted</part></link><space/>in storage to prevent the possibility of unauthorized information reconstruction from chunks of storage snapshots.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Hierarchy of storage</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Memory hierarchy</arg></template><template><target>sync</target><arg>Memory hierarchy</arg><arg name="date">March 2013</arg></template><link><target>File:Computer storage types.svg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>350px</part><part>Various forms of storage, divided according to their distance from the<space/><link><target>central processing unit</target></link>.

The computer usually uses its<space/><link><target>input/output</target></link><space/>channels to access secondary storage and transfers the desired data using<space/><link><target>Data buffer</target><part>intermediate area</part></link><space/>in primary storage. Secondary storage does not lose the data when the device is powered downit is non-volatile. Per unit, it is typically also two orders of magnitude less expensive than primary storage. Modern computer systems typically have two orders of magnitude more secondary storage than primary storage and data are kept for a longer time there.</paragraph><paragraph>In modern computers,<space/><link><target>hard disk drive</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>are usually used as secondary storage. The time taken to access a given byte of information stored on a hard disk is typically a few thousandths of a second, or milliseconds. By contrast, the time taken to access a given byte of information stored in random-access memory is measured in billionths of a second, or nanoseconds. This illustrates the significant access-time difference which distinguishes solid-state memory from rotating magnetic storage devices: hard disks are typically about a million times slower than memory. Rotating<space/><link><target>Optical disc drive</target><part>optical storage</part></link><space/>devices, such as<space/><link><target>Compact Disc</target><part>CD</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>DVD</target></link><space/>drives, have even longer access times. With disk drives, once the disk read/write head reaches the proper placement and the data of interest rotates under it, subsequent data on the track are very fast to access. To reduce the seek time and rotational latency, data are transferred to and from disks in large contiguous blocks.</paragraph><paragraph>When data reside on disk, block access to hide latency offers a ray of hope in designing efficient<space/><link><target>external memory algorithms</target></link>. Sequential or block access on disks is orders of magnitude faster than random access, and many sophisticated paradigms have been developed to design efficient algorithms based upon sequential and block access. Another way to reduce the I/O bottleneck is to use multiple disks in parallel in order to increase the bandwidth between primary and secondary memory.<extension extension_name='ref'><link><target>J.

The downside is that this doubles the storage, and both devices (copies) need to be updated simultaneously with some overhead and possibly some delays. The upside is possible concurrent read of a same data group by two independent processes, which increases performance. When one of the replicated devices is detected to be defective, the other copy is still operational, and is being utilized to generate a new copy on another device (usually available operational in a pool of stand-by devices for this purpose).</listitem><listitem><bold>Redundant array of independent disks</bold><space/>(<bold><link><target>RAID</target></link></bold>) This method generalizes the device mirroring above by allowing one device in a group of N devices to fail and be replaced with content restored (Device mirroring is RAID with N=2). RAID groups of N=5 or N=6 are common. N&gt;2 saves storage, when comparing with N=2, at the cost of more processing during both regular operation (with often reduced performance) and defective device replacement.</listitem></list><paragraph>Device mirroring and typical RAID are designed to handle a single device failure in the RAID group of devices. However, if a second failure occurs before the RAID group is completely repaired from the first failure, then data can be lost. The probability of a single failure is typically small. Thus the probability of two failures in a same RAID group in time proximity is much smaller (approximately the probability squared, i.e., multiplied by itself). If a database cannot tolerate even such smaller probability of data loss, then the RAID group itself is replicated (mirrored). In many cases such mirroring is done geographically remotely, in a different storage array, to handle also recovery from disasters (see disaster recovery above).</paragraph><heading level='3'>Network connectivity</heading><paragraph>A secondary or tertiary storage may connect to a computer utilizing<space/><link><target>computer network</target><trail>s</trail></link>.This concept does not pertain to the primary storage, which is shared between multiple processors to a lesser degree.</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Direct-attached storage</target></link><space/>(DAS) is a traditional mass storage, that does not use any network.
