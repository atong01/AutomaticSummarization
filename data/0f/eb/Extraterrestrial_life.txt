===Biochemistry===
{{Main|Biochemistry|Hypothetical types of biochemistry|Water and life}}

It is often hypothesized that life forms elsewhere in the universe would, like life on Earth, be based on carbon chemistry and rely on liquid water. Life forms based on [[ammonia]] (rather than water) have been suggested, though this solvent appears less suitable than water. It is also conceivable that there are forms of life whose solvent is a liquid [[hydrocarbon]], such as [[methane]], [[ethane]] or [[propane]].<ref>Committee on the Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems, Committee on the Origins and Evolution of Life, National Research Council; [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11919&page=74 The Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems]; The National Academies Press, 2007; p 74</ref>

The carbon atom has the unique ability to make four strong chemical bonds with other atoms, including other carbon atoms. These covalent bonds have a direction in space, so that carbon atoms can form the skeletons of complex 3-dimensional structures with definite architectures such as nucleic acids and proteins. Carbon forms more compounds than all other elements combined. The great versatility of the carbon atom makes it the element most likely to provide the bases—even exotic ones—to the chemical composition of life on other planets.<ref>Norman H. Horowitz.

Life on Earth requires [[water]] as its [[solvent]] in which biochemical reactions take place. Sufficient quantities of carbon and the other elements along with water, may enable the formation of living organisms on other planets with a chemical make-up and temperature range similar to that of Earth.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Norman R. | last=Pace | date=January 20, 2001 | title=The universal nature of biochemistry | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume=98 | issue=3 | pages=805–808 | doi=10.1073/pnas.98.3.805 | pmid=11158550 | bibcode=2001PNAS...98..805P | pmc=33372}}</ref> [[Terrestrial planet]]s such as Earth are formed in a process that allows for the possibility of having compositions similar to Earth's.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Bond | first1=Jade C. | last2=O'Brien | first2=David P. | last3=Lauretta | first3=Dante S. | title=The Compositional Diversity of Extrasolar Terrestrial Planets.

The [[panspermia]] hypothesis proposes that life elsewhere in the Solar System may have a common origin. If extraterrestrial life was found on another body in the [[Solar System]], it could have originated from Earth just as life on Earth may have been seeded from elsewhere ([[Exogenesis (astrobiology)|exogenesis]]). The first known mention of the term 'panspermia' was in the writings of the 5th century BC [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher [[Anaxagoras]].<ref>Margaret O'Leary (2008) Anaxagoras and the Origin of Panspermia Theory, iUniverse publishing Group, # ISBN 978-0-595-49596-2</ref> In the nineteenth century it was again revived in modern form by several scientists, including [[Jöns Jacob Berzelius]] (1834),<ref>{{Cite journal| last =  Berzelius (1799–1848) | first =  J.

In November 2011, NASA launched the [[Mars Science Laboratory]] that landed the ''Curiosity'' rover on Mars. It is designed to assess the past and present habitability on Mars using a variety of scientific instruments.

The [[Gaia hypothesis]] stipulates that any planet with a robust population of life will have an atmosphere in chemical disequilibrium, which is relatively easy to determine from a distance by [[spectroscopy]]. However, significant advances in the ability to find and resolve light from smaller rocky worlds near their star are necessary before such spectroscopic methods can be used to analyze extrasolar planets. To that effect, the [[Carl Sagan Institute]] was founded in 2014 dedicated to the atmospheric characterization of exoplanets in [[circumstellar habitable zone]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://instituteforpalebluedots.com/2015/01/what-is-the-institute-for-pale-blue-dots/ |title=Introducing: The Carl Sagan Institute |last=Glaser |first=Linda |date=January 27, 2015 |accessdate=2015-05-11 }}</ref><ref name='CSI-Research'>{{cite web |url=http://instituteforpalebluedots.com/research/ |title=Carl Sagan Institute - Research |date=May 2015 |accessdate=2015-05-11 }}</ref> Planetary spectroscopic data will be obtained  from telescopes like [[Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope|WFIRST]] and [[European Extremely Large Telescope|E-ELT]].<ref name="ColorCatalog">{{cite news |last=Cofield |first=Calla |url=http://www.space.com/28906-alien-life-earth-microbe-catalog.html |title=Catalog of Earth Microbes Could Help Find Alien Life |work=Space.com |date=30 March 2015 |accessdate=2015-05-11 }}</ref>

In August 2012, and in a world first, astronomers at [[Copenhagen University]] reported the detection of a specific sugar molecule, [[glycolaldehyde]], in a distant star system.

==The Drake equation==
{{Main|Drake equation}}

In 1961, [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], [[astronomer]] and [[astrophysicist]]  [[Frank Drake]] devised the [[Drake equation]] as a way to stimulate scientific dialogue at a meeting on the [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI).<ref name='December 2002'>{{cite web | url = http://www.setileague.org/askdr/drake.htm | title = Chapter 3 — Philosophy: "Solving the Drake Equation | accessdate = July 24, 2015 | date = December 2002 | publisher = SETI League}}</ref> The Drake equation is a [[probability theory|probabilistic argument]] used to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the [[Milky Way]]  [[galaxy]].

==Cultural impact==

===Cosmic pluralism===
{{main|Cosmic pluralism}}
Cosmic pluralism, the plurality of worlds, or simply pluralism, describes the philosophical belief in numerous "worlds" in addition to Earth, which might harbor extraterrestrial life. Before the development of the [[heliocentric]] theory and a recognition that our Sun is just one of many stars,<ref>[http://solar-center.stanford.edu/FAQ/Qsunasstar.html ''Who discovered that the Sun was a Star?''] Stanford Solar Center.</ref> the notion of pluralism was largely [[mythology|mythological]] and philosophical.<ref name=crowe1999>

The astronomer [[Camille Flammarion]] promoted the notion of cosmic pluralism in his 1862 book ''La pluralité des mondes habités''.<ref>[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/F/Flammarion.html Flammarion, (Nicolas) Camille (1842–1925)]— The Internet Encyclopedia of Science</ref> None of these notions of pluralism were based on any specific observation or scientific information.

===Early modern period===
There was a dramatic shift in thinking initiated by the invention of the [[telescope]] and the [[Copernican Revolution|Copernican]] assault on geocentric cosmology. Once it became clear that Earth was merely one planet amongst countless bodies in the universe, the theory of extraterrestrial life started to become a topic in the scientific community. The best known early-modern proponent of such ideas was the Italian philosopher [[Giordano Bruno]], who argued in the 16th century for an infinite universe in which every star is surrounded by its own [[planetary system]]. Bruno wrote that other worlds "have no less virtue nor a nature different to that of our earth" and, like Earth, "contain animals and inhabitants".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/brunoiuw0.htm#IUW0III|title=Giordano Bruno: On the Infinite Universe and Worlds (De l'Infinito Universo et Mondi) Introductory Epistle: Argument of the Third Dialogue|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}</ref>

In the early 17th century, the Czech astronomer [[Anton Maria Schyrleus of Rheita]] mused that "if Jupiter has (...) inhabitants (...) they must be larger and more beautiful than the inhabitants of Earth, in proportion to the [characteristics] of the two spheres".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://cosmovisions.com/Rheita.htm| publisher=cosmovisions.com| title=Rheita.htm}}</ref>

In [[Baroque]] literature such as ''The Other World: The Societies and Governments of the Moon'' by [[Cyrano de Bergerac]], extraterrestrial societies are presented as humoristic or ironic parodies of earthly society.
The didactic poet [[Henry More]] took up the classical theme of the Greek [[Democritus]] in "Democritus Platonissans, or an Essay Upon the Infinity of Worlds" (1647).
In "The Creation: a Philosophical Poem in Seven Books" (1712), Sir [[Richard Blackmore]] observed: "We may pronounce each orb sustains a race / Of living things adapted to the place". With the new relative viewpoint that the Copernican revolution had wrought, he suggested "our world's sunne / Becomes a starre elsewhere". [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontanelle]]'s "Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds" (translated into English in 1686) offered similar excursions on the possibility of extraterrestrial life, expanding, rather than denying, the creative sphere of a Maker.

The possibility of extraterrestrials remained a widespread speculation as scientific discovery accelerated. [[William Herschel]], the discoverer of [[Uranus]], was one of many 18th–19th-century astronomers who believed that the [[Solar System]] is populated by alien life. Other luminaries of the period who championed "cosmic pluralism" included [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]]. At the height of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], even the [[Sun]] and Moon were considered candidates for extraterrestrial inhabitants.

===19th century===

[[File:Lowell Mars channels.jpg|thumb|250|Artificial Martian channels, depicted by Percival Lowell]]
Speculation about life on Mars increased in the late 19th century, following telescopic observation of apparent [[Martian canal]]—which soon, however, turned out to be optical illusions.<ref>[[Joseph Edward Evans|Evans, J. E.]] and [[Edward Walter Maunder|Maunder, E. W.]] (1903) "Experiments as to the Actuality of the 'Canals' observed on Mars", [http://adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/MNRAS/0063//0000488.000.html MNRAS, '''63''' (1903) 488]</ref> Despite this, in 1895, American astronomer [[Percival Lowell]] published his book ''Mars,'' followed by ''Mars and its Canals'' in 1906, proposing that the canals were the work of a long-gone civilization.<ref>''Is Mars habitable? A critical examination of Professor Percival Lowell's book "Mars and its canals''.", an alternative explanation, by Alfred Russel Wallace, F.R.S., etc.'' London, Macmillan and co., 1907.</ref> This idea led British writer [[H. G. Wells]] to write the novel ''[[The War of the Worlds (novel)|The War of the Worlds]]'' in 1897, telling of an invasion by aliens from Mars who were fleeing the planet's desiccation.

[[Spectroscopy|Spectroscopic]] analysis of Mars's atmosphere began in earnest in 1894, when U.S. astronomer [[William Wallace Campbell]] showed that neither water nor oxygen was present in the [[Martian atmosphere]].<ref name="chambers">{{Cite book|first=Paul|last=Chambers|title=Life on Mars; The Complete Story|place=London|publisher=Blandford|year=1999|doi=|isbn=0-7137-2747-0}}</ref>
By 1909 better telescopes and the best perihelic opposition of Mars since 1877 conclusively put an end to the canal hypothesis.

The [[science fiction]] genre, although not so named during the time, develops during the late 19th century. [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[Around the Moon]]'' (1870) features a discussion of the possibility of life on the Moon, but with the conclusion that it is barren.
Stories involving extraterrestrials are found in e.g. [[Garrett P. Serviss]]'s ''[[Edison's Conquest of Mars]]'' (1898), an unauthorized sequel to 
''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' by H. G. Wells was published in 1897 which stands at the beginning of the popular idea of the "Martian invasion" of Earth prominent in 20th-century pop culture.

The possibility of extraterrestrial life on the Moon was ruled out in the 1960s, and during the 1970s it became clear that most of the other bodies of the Solar System do not harbor highly developed life, although the question of primitive life on bodies in the Solar System remains an open question.

===Recent history===
The failure so far of the [[SETI]] program to detect an intelligent radio signal after decades of effort has at least partially dimmed the prevailing optimism of the beginning of the space age. Notwithstanding, belief in extraterrestrial beings continues to be voiced in [[pseudoscience]], conspiracy theories, and in popular [[folklore]], notably "[[Sector Four|Area 51]]" and [[Planets proposed in religion and ufology|legends]]. It has become a pop culture trope given less-than-serious treatment in popular entertainment.

In the words of SETI's Frank Drake, "All we know for sure is that the sky is not littered with powerful microwave transmitters".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://antarcticaedu.com/bio2024.htm |title=LECTURE 4: MODERN THOUGHTS ON EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE |work=The University of Antarctica |accessdate=2015-07-25 }}</ref> Drake noted that it is entirely possible that advanced technology results in communication being carried out in some way other than conventional radio transmission. At the same time, the data returned by space probes, and giant strides in detection methods, have allowed science to begin delineating [[Planetary habitability|habitability criteria]] on other worlds, and to confirm that at least other planets are plentiful, though aliens remain a question mark. The [[Wow! signal]], detected in 1977 by a SETI project, remains a subject of speculative debate.

In 2000, [[geologist]] and [[paleontologist]] [[Peter Ward (paleontologist)|Peter Ward]] and [[Astrobiology|astrobiologist]] [[Donald Brownlee]] published a book entitled ''Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe''.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0387987010 Amazon.com: Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe: Books: Peter Ward, Donald Brownlee<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In it, they discussed the [[Rare Earth hypothesis]], in which they claim that Earth-like life is rare in the [[universe]], whereas [[bacteria|microbial]] life is common. Ward and Brownlee are open to the idea of evolution on other planets that is not based on essential Earth-like characteristics (such as DNA and carbon).

Theoretical physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] in 2010 warned that humans should not try to contact alien life forms. He warned that aliens might pillage Earth for resources. "If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] landed in [[Americas|America]], which didn't turn out well for the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]", he said.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8642558.stm | work=BBC News | title=Hawking warns over alien beings | date=2010-04-25 | accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref> [[Jared Diamond]] has expressed similar concerns.<ref>Diamond, Jared. "The Third Chimpanzee", Harper Perennial, 2006, Chapter 12.</ref>

In November 2011, the [[White House]] released an official response to two petitions asking the [[U.S. government]] to acknowledge formally that aliens have visited Earth and to disclose any intentional withholding of government interactions with extraterrestrial beings. According to the response, "The U.S. government has no evidence that any life exists outside our planet, or that an extraterrestrial presence has contacted or engaged any member of the human race."<ref name="WhiteHouse">{{cite web |last=Larson|first=Phil |title=Searching for ET, But No Evidence Yet|url=https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions#!/response/searching-et-no-evidence-yet|date=5 November 2011 |publisher=[[White House]] |accessdate=2011-11-06}}</ref><ref name="Atkinson">{{cite web |last=Atkinson |first=Nancy |title=No Alien Visits or UFO Coverups, White House Says|url=http://www.universetoday.com/90717/no-alien-visits-or-ufo-coverups-white-house-says/|date=5 November 2011 |publisher=[[UniverseToday]] |accessdate=2011-11-06 }}</ref> Also, according to the response, there is "no credible information to suggest that any evidence is being hidden from the public's eye."<ref name="WhiteHouse"/><ref name="Atkinson"/> The response noted "odds are pretty high" that there may be life on other planets but "the odds of us making contact with any of them—especially any [[Extraterrestrial intelligence|intelligent ones]]—are extremely small, given the distances involved."<ref name="WhiteHouse"/><ref name="Atkinson"/>
