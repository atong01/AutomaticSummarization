Thus, the diode can be viewed as an electronic version of a<space/><link><target>check valve</target></link>.

The boundary between these two regions, called a<space/><link><target>pn junction</target></link>, is where the action of the diode takes place. When a higher electrical potential is applied to the N side (the cathode) than to the P side (the anode), it allows electrons to flow from the N-type side (called the<space/><link><target>cathode</target></link>) to the P-type side. The junction does not allow the flow of electrons in the opposite direction when the potential is applied in reverse, creating, in a sense, an electrical check-valve.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Schottky diode</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Schottky diode</arg></template>Another type of junction diode, the<space/><link><target>Schottky diode</target></link>, is formed from a<space/><link><target>metalsemiconductor junction</target></link><space/>rather than a pn junction, which reduces capacitance and increases switching speed.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Currentvoltage characteristic</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Diode current wiki.png</target><part>thumb</part><part>400px</part><part>IV (current vs. voltage) characteristics of a pn junction diode</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>A semiconductor diode's behavior in a circuit is given by its<space/><link><target>currentvoltage characteristic</target></link>, or IV graph (see graph below).

When a mobile electron recombines with a hole, both hole and electron vanish, leaving behind an immobile positively charged donor (dopant) on the N side and negatively charged acceptor (dopant) on the P side.

As recombination proceeds and more ions are created, an increasing electric field develops through the depletion zone that acts to slow and then finally stop recombination. At this point, there is a &quot;built-in&quot; potential across the depletion zone.</paragraph><paragraph>If an external voltage is placed across the diode with the same polarity as the built-in potential, the depletion zone continues to act as an insulator, preventing any significant electric current flow (unless<space/><link><target>electronhole pair</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>are actively being created in the junction by, for instance, light; see<space/><link><target>photodiode</target></link>).

However, if the polarity of the external voltage opposes the built-in potential, recombination can once again proceed, resulting in a substantial electric current through the pn junction (i.e. substantial numbers of electrons and holes recombine at the junction). For silicon diodes, the built-in potential is approximately 0.7 V (0.3 V for germanium and 0.2 V for Schottky). Thus, if an external voltage greater than and opposite to the built-in voltage is applied, a current will flow and the diode is said to be &quot;turned on&quot; as it has been given an external<space/><italics><link><target>pn junction#Forward bias</target><part>forward bias</part></link></italics>. The diode is commonly said to have a forward &quot;threshold&quot; voltage, above which it conducts and below which conduction stops.

A single particle of radiation, with thousands or millions of<space/><link><target>electron volt</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>of energy, generates many charge carrier pairs, as its energy is deposited in the semiconductor material. If the depletion layer is large enough to catch the whole shower or to stop a heavy particle, a fairly accurate measurement of the particle's energy can be made, simply by measuring the charge conducted and without the complexity of a magnetic spectrometer, etc.These semiconductor radiation detectors need efficient and uniform charge collection and low leakage current. They are often cooled by<space/><link><target>liquid nitrogen</target></link>. For longer-range (about a centimetre) particles, they need a very large depletion depth and large area. For short-range particles, they need any contact or un-depleted semiconductor on at least one surface to be very thin. The back-bias voltages are near breakdown (around a thousand volts per centimetre). Germanium and silicon are common materials. Some of these detectors sense position as well as energy.They have a finite life, especially when detecting heavy particles, because of radiation damage.
