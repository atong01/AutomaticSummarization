All polymers are made of repetitive units called<space/><link><target>monomer</target><trail>s</trail></link>. Biopolymers often have a well-defined structure, though this is not a defining characteristic (example:<space/><link><target>lignocellulose</target></link>): The exact chemical composition and the sequence in which these units are arranged is called the<space/><link><target>primary structure</target></link>, in the case of proteins. Many biopolymers spontaneously fold into characteristic compact shapes (see also &quot;<link><target>protein folding</target></link>&quot; as well as<space/><link><target>secondary structure</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>tertiary structure</target></link>), which determine their biological functions and depend in a complicated way on their primary structures.<space/><link><target>Structural biology</target></link><space/>is the study of the structural properties of the biopolymers.In contrast, most<space/><bold>synthetic polymers</bold><space/>have much simpler and more random (or stochastic) structures. This fact leads to a molecular mass distribution that is missing in biopolymers.In fact, as their synthesis is controlled by a template-directed process in most<space/><italics>in vivo</italics><space/>systems, all biopolymers of a type (say one specific protein) are all alike: they all contain the similar sequences and numbers of monomers and thus all have the same mass. This phenomenon is called<space/><link><target>monodispersity</target></link><space/>in contrast to the<space/><link><target>polydispersity</target></link><space/>encountered in synthetic polymers. As a result biopolymers have a<space/><link><target>polydispersity index</target></link><space/>of 1.<extension extension_name='ref'>Stupp, S.I and Braun, P.V., &quot;Role of Proteins in Microstructural Control: Biomaterials, Ceramics &amp; Semiconductors&quot;, Science, Vol. 277, p. 1242 (1997)</extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Conventions and nomenclature</heading><heading level='3'>Polypeptides</heading><paragraph>The convention for a<space/><link><target>polypeptide</target></link><space/>is to list its constituent amino acid residues as they occur from the amino terminus to the carboxylic acid terminus.

Sugar polymers can be linear or branched and are typically joined with<space/><link><target>glycosidic bond</target><trail>s</trail></link>. The exact placement of the linkage can vary, and the orientation of the linking functional groups is also important, resulting in - and -glycosidic bonds with numbering definitive of the linking carbons' location in the ring. In addition, many saccharide units can undergo various chemical modification, such as<space/><link><target>amination</target></link>, and can even form parts of other molecules, such as<space/><link><target>glycoprotein</target><trail>s</trail></link>.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Structural characterization</heading><paragraph>There are a number of<space/><link><target>biophysics</target><part>biophysical</part></link><space/>techniques for determining sequence information.<space/><link><target>Peptide sequence</target><part>Protein sequence</part></link><space/>can be determined by<space/><link><target>Edman degradation</target></link>, in which the N-terminal residues are hydrolyzed from the chain one at a time, derivatized, and then identified.

Therefore, the use of biopolymers would create a<space/><link><target>sustainable</target></link><space/>industry. In contrast, the feedstocks for polymers derived from petrochemicals will eventually deplete. In addition, biopolymers have the potential to cut<space/><link><target>carbon emissions</target></link><space/>and reduce CO<xhtml:sub>2</xhtml:sub><space/>quantities in the atmosphere: this is because the CO<xhtml:sub>2</xhtml:sub><space/>released when they degrade can be reabsorbed by crops grown to replace them: this makes them close to<space/><link><target>carbon neutral</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Biopolymers are biodegradable, and some are also compostable. Some biopolymers are<space/><link><target>biodegradable</target></link>: they are broken down into CO<xhtml:sub>2</xhtml:sub><space/>and water by<space/><link><target>microorganisms</target></link>. Some of these biodegradable biopolymers are<space/><link><target>compostable</target></link>: they can be put into an industrial composting process and will break down by 90% within six months. Biopolymers that do this can be marked with a 'compostable' symbol, under European Standard EN 13432 (2000). Packaging marked with this symbol can be put into industrial composting processes and will break down within six months or less. An example of a compostable polymer is PLA film under 20m thick: films which are thicker than that do not qualify as compostable, even though they are biodegradable.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/publications/nnfcc-newsletter-issue-5-biopolymers-a-renewable-resource-for-the-plastics-industry'>NNFCC Newsletter Issue 5.
