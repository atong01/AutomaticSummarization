It is uncertain whether he really married her, since widowers were socially limited in such matters, but this woman definitely bore him two children, Dante's half-brother Francesco and half-sister Tana (Gaetana).

Years after his marriage to Gemma he claims to have met Beatrice again; he wrote several sonnets to Beatrice but never mentioned Gemma in any of his poems. The exact date of his marriage is not known: the only certain information is that, before his exile in 1301, he had three children (Pietro, Jacopo and Antonia).<extension extension_name='ref' name="Trecc"></extension><link><target>File:Antonio Cotti - Dante a Verona.jpg</target><part>thumbnail</part><part>''Dante in Verona'', by Antonio Cotti</part></link>Dante fought with the Guelph cavalry at the<space/><link><target>Battle of Campaldino</target></link><space/>(June 11, 1289).

To take any part in public life, one had to enroll in one of the city's many commercial or artisan guilds, so Dante entered the Physicians' and Apothecaries' Guild. In the following years, his name is occasionally recorded as speaking or voting in the various councils of the republic. A substantial portion of minutes from such meetings in the years 12981300 was lost during<space/><link><target>World War II</target></link>, however, so the true extent of Dante's participation in the city's councils is uncertain.</paragraph><paragraph>Gemma bore Dante several children.

He saw her frequently after age 18, often exchanging greetings in the street, but never knew her well. In effect, he set an example of so-called<space/><link><target>courtly love</target></link>, a phenomenon developed in French and Provenal poetry of prior centuries. Dante's experience of such love was typical, but his expression of it was unique. It was in the name of this love that Dante left his imprint on the<space/><italics><link><target>dolce stil novo</target></link></italics><space/>(<italics>sweet new style,</italics><space/>a term which Dante himself coined), and he would join other contemporary poets and writers in exploring never-before-emphasized aspects of love (<italics>Amore</italics>). Love for Beatrice (as<space/><link><target>Petrarch</target></link><space/>would show for Laura somewhat differently) would be his reason for poetry and for living, together with political passions. In many of his poems, she is depicted as semi-divine, watching over him constantly and providing spiritual instruction, sometimes harshly. When Beatrice died in 1290, Dante sought refuge in Latin literature.

To further his political career, he became a pharmacist. He did not intend to practice as one, but a law issued in 1295 required nobles aspiring to public office to be enrolled in one of the Corporazioni delle Arti e dei Mestieri, so Dante obtained admission to the Apothecaries' Guild. This profession was not inappropriate, since at that time books were sold from apothecaries' shops. As a politician he accomplished little, but held various offices over some years in a city rife with political unrest.<link><target>File:Dante Luca.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part></part><part>Dante Alighieri, detail from<space/><link><target>Luca Signorelli</target></link>'s fresco,<space/><link><target>Chapel of San Brizio</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Orvieto Cathedral</target></link></part></link></paragraph><paragraph>After defeating the Ghibellines, the Guelphs divided into two factions: the White Guelphs (<italics>Guelfi Bianchi</italics>)Dante's party, led by Vieri dei Cerchiand the Black Guelphs (<italics>Guelfi Neri</italics>), led by<space/><link><target>Corso Donati</target></link>. Although the split was along family lines at first, ideological differences arose based on opposing views of the papal role in Florentine affairs, with the Blacks supporting the Pope and the Whites wanting more freedom from Rome. The Whites took power first and expelled the Blacks. In response,<space/><link><target>Pope Boniface VIII</target></link><space/>planned a military occupation of Florence. In 1301,<space/><link><target>Charles of Valois</target></link>, brother of King<space/><link><target>Philip IV of France</target></link>, was expected to visit Florence because the Pope had appointed him peacemaker for<space/><link><target>Tuscany</target></link>. But the city's government had treated the Pope's ambassadors badly a few weeks before, seeking independence from papal influence. It was believed that Charles had received other unofficial instructions, so the council sent a delegation to Rome to ascertain the Pope's intentions. Dante was one of the delegates.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Exile and death</heading><paragraph>Pope Boniface quickly dismissed the other delegates and asked Dante alone to remain in Rome. At the same time (November 1, 1301), Charles of Valois entered Florence with the Black Guelphs, who in the next six days destroyed much of the city and killed many of their enemies. A new Black Guelph government was installed, and<space/><link><target>Cante de' Gabrielli</target></link><space/>da<space/><link><target>Gubbio</target></link><space/>was appointed<space/><italics><link><target>podest</target></link></italics><space/>of the city.

Evidently, Dante's command of philosophy and his literary interests deepened in exile and when he was no longer busy with the day-to-day business of Florentine domestic politics, and this is evidenced in his prose writings in this period, but there is no real evidence that he ever left Italy.

He wrote to Henry and several Italian princes, demanding that they destroy the Black Guelphs.

The work is much more assured and on a larger scale than anything he had produced in Florence; it is likely he would have undertaken such a work only after he realized his political ambitions, which had been central to him up to his banishment, had been halted for some time, possibly forever.

Some say he refused to participate in the assault on his city by a foreigner; others suggest that he had become unpopular with the White Guelphs too, and that any trace of his passage had carefully been removed. Henry VII died (from a fever) in 1313, and with him any hope for Dante to see Florence again. He returned to Verona, where<space/><link><target>Cangrande I della Scala</target></link><space/>allowed him to live in certain security and, presumably, in a fair degree of prosperity. Cangrande was admitted to Dante's Paradise (<italics>Paradiso</italics>, XVII, 76).</paragraph><paragraph>In 1315, Florence was forced by<space/><link><target>Uguccione della Faggiuola</target></link><space/>(the military officer controlling the town) to grant an amnesty to those in exile, including Dante. But for this, Florence required public penance in addition to a heavy fine. Dante refused, preferring to remain in exile. When Uguccione defeated Florence, Dante's death sentence was commuted to house arrest on condition that he go to Florence to swear he would never enter the town again. He refused to go, and his death sentence was confirmed and extended to his sons. He still hoped late in life that he might be invited back to Florence on honorable terms.

Dante was more aware than most early Italian writers of the variety of Italian dialects and of the need to create a literature and a unified literary language beyond the limits of Latin writing at the time; in that sense, he is a forerunner of the Renaissance, with its effort to create vernacular literature in competition with earlier classical writers. Dante's in-depth knowledge (within the limits of his time) of Roman antiquity, and his evident admiration for some aspects of pagan Rome, also point forward to the 15th century. Ironically, while he was widely honored in the centuries after his death, the<space/><italics>Comedy</italics><space/>slipped out of fashion among men of letters: too medieval, too rough and tragic, and not stylistically refined in the respects that the high and late Renaissance came to demand of literature.</paragraph><paragraph>He wrote the<space/><italics>Comedy</italics><space/>in a language he called &quot;Italian&quot;, in some sense an amalgamated literary language mostly based on the regional dialect of Tuscany, but with some elements of Latin and other regional dialects. He deliberately aimed to reach a readership throughout Italy including laymen, clergymen and other poets. By creating a poem of epic structure and philosophic purpose, he established that the<space/><link><target>Italian language</target></link><space/>was suitable for the highest sort of expression. In French, Italian is sometimes nicknamed<space/><italics>la langue de Dante.</italics><space/>Publishing in the vernacular language marked Dante as one of the first (among others such as<space/><link><target>Geoffrey Chaucer</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Giovanni Boccaccio</target></link>) to break free from standards of publishing in only Latin (the language of<space/><link><target>liturgy</target></link>, history and scholarship in general, but often also of lyric poetry). This break set a precedent and allowed more literature to be published for a wider audience, setting the stage for greater levels of literacy in the future. However, unlike<space/><link><target>Boccaccio</target></link>,<space/><link><target>John Milton</target><part>Milton</part></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>Ariosto</target></link>, Dante did not really become an author read all over Europe until the Romantic era. To the Romantics, Dante, like<space/><link><target>Homer</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Shakespeare</target></link>, was a prime example of the &quot;original genius&quot; who sets his own rules, creates persons of overpowering stature and depth, and goes far beyond any imitation of the patterns of earlier masters; and who, in turn, cannot truly be imitated. Throughout the 19th century, Dante's reputation grew and solidified; and by 1865, the 600th anniversary of his birth, he had become established as one of the greatest literary icons of the Western world.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Dante-alighieri.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>Dante Alighieri, attributed to<space/><link><target>Giotto di Bondone</target><part>Giotto</part></link>, in the chapel of the<space/><link><target>Bargello</target></link><space/>palace in Florence.
