Moreover, the economy benefited from the close cooperation between the public and private sectors.</paragraph><paragraph>In the past 30 years, the economy has shifted from agriculture to light manufacturing and services. The services sector, including tourism, contributes almost 80% to GDP and employs more than 70% of the labor force. Industry and construction account for approximately one-fifth of GDP and labor, while agriculture is responsible for 2.1% of GDP and 8.5% of the labor force.

This pattern underlined the economy's vulnerability to swings in tourist arrivals (i.e., to economic and political conditions in Cyprus, Western Europe, and the Middle East) and the need to diversify the economy. Declining competitiveness in tourism and especially in manufacturing are expected to act as a drag on growth until structural changes are effected.

Because the<space/><italics>de facto</italics><space/>administration is recognized only by<space/><link><target>Turkey</target></link>, it has had much difficulty arranging foreign financing, and foreign firms have hesitated to invest there. The economy mainly revolves around the agricultural sector and government service, which together employ about half of the work force.<space/></paragraph><paragraph>The tourism sector also contributes substantially into the economy. Moreover, the small economy has seen some downfalls because the<space/><link><target>Turkish lira</target></link><space/>is<space/><link><target>legal tender</target></link>.

The ECJ decided that only goods bearing certificates of origin from the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus could be imported by EU member states. The decision resulted in a considerable decrease of Turkish Cypriot exports to the EU: from $36.4&amp;nbsp;million (or 66.7% of total Turkish Cypriot exports) in 1993 to $24.7&amp;nbsp;million in 1996 (or 35% of total exports) in 1996.
