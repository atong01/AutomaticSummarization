A group of rebels<space/><link><target>Siege of Kenilworth</target><part>held out</part></link><space/>in the stronghold of<space/><link><target>Kenilworth Castle</target></link>, however, and their resistance proved hard to crush.</paragraph><paragraph>A siege of the castle was started, but through papal intervention King Henry later entered on a more conciliatory path. A commission was appointed to draw up an arrangement that would be acceptable to both sides. The resulting Dictum of Kenilworth offered the rebels the right to buy back forfeited estates, at prices depending on their level of involvement in the rebellion. After initial resistance, the terms were eventually accepted. By the summer of 1267, the country was pacified, and this spirit of reconciliation would last until the 1290s. The Dictum of Kenilworth was later incorporated into the<space/><link><target>Statute of Marlborough</target></link>.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Background</heading><paragraph>At the<space/><link><target>Battle of Lewes</target></link><space/>in 1264, the rebellious barons, led by<space/><link><target>Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester</target><part>Simon de Montfort</part></link>, had defeated the royal army and taken King<space/><link><target>Henry III of England</target><part>Henry III</part></link><space/>captive.<extension extension_name='ref'>Prestwich (1988), pp. 45&amp;ndash;6.</extension><space/>For the next year, the reins of government were in Montfort's hands, but his support soon began to crumble.<extension extension_name='ref'>Prestwich (2005), pp. 115&amp;ndash;6</extension><space/>On 4 August 1265 Montfort faced an army led by Prince Edward (the later King<space/><link><target>Edward I of England</target><part>Edward I</part></link>) and the powerful<space/><link><target>Gilbert de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford</target><part>earl of Gloucester</part></link>, who had recently defected to the royalist side, at the<space/><link><target>Battle of Evesham</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'>Maddicott (1994), pp. 327&amp;ndash;9.</extension><space/>The battle resulted in a complete royal victory;
