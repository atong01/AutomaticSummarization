Largely self-educated, he became a lawyer in<space/><link><target>Illinois</target></link>, a<space/><link><target>Whig Party (United States)</target><part>Whig Party leader</part></link>, and a member of the<space/><link><target>Illinois House of Representatives</target></link>, where he served from 1834 to 1846. Elected to the<space/><link><target>United States House of Representatives</target></link><space/>in 1846, Lincoln promoted rapid modernization of the economy through banks, tariffs, and railroads. Because he had originally agreed not to run for a second term in Congress, and because his opposition to the<space/><link><target>MexicanAmerican War</target></link><space/>was unpopular among Illinois voters, Lincoln returned to<space/><link><target>Springfield, Illinois</target><part>Springfield</part></link><space/>and resumed his successful law practice. Reentering politics in 1854, he became a leader in building the new<space/><link><target>History of the Republican Party (United States)</target><part>Republican Party</part></link>, which had a statewide majority in Illinois. In 1858, while taking part in a<space/><link><target>LincolnDouglas debates</target><part>series of highly publicized debates</part></link><space/>with his opponent and rival, Democrat<space/><link><target>Stephen A. Douglas</target></link>, Lincoln spoke out against the expansion of slavery, but lost the U.S. Senate race to Douglas.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1860, Lincoln secured the Republican Party presidential nomination as a moderate from a swing state. With very little support in the slaveholding states of the South, he swept the North and was<space/><link><target>United States presidential election, 1860</target><part>elected president in 1860</part></link>. His victory prompted seven southern slave states to form the<space/><link><target>Confederate States of America</target></link><space/>before he moved into the<space/><link><target>White House</target></link><space/>- no compromise or reconciliation was found regarding slavery and secession. Subsequently, on April 12, 1861, a Confederate attack on<space/><link><target>Fort Sumter</target></link><space/>inspired the North to enthusiastically rally behind the<space/><link><target>Union (American Civil War)</target><part>Union</part></link><space/>in a declaration of war. As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican Party, Lincoln confronted Radical Republicans, who demanded harsher treatment of the South,<space/><link><target>War Democrats</target></link>, who called for more compromise, anti-war Democrats (called<space/><link><target>Copperhead (politics)</target><part>Copperheads</part></link>), who despised him, and irreconcilable secessionists, who plotted his assassination. Politically, Lincoln fought back by pitting his opponents against each other, by carefully planned political<space/><link><target>patronage</target></link>, and by appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory.<extension extension_name='ref'>Randall (1947), pp. 6587.</extension><space/>His<space/><link><target>Gettysburg Address</target></link><space/>became an iconic endorsement of the principles of nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy.</paragraph><paragraph>Lincoln initially concentrated on the military and political dimensions of the war. His primary goal was to reunite the nation. He suspended<space/><link><target>habeas corpus</target></link>, leading to the controversial<space/><italics><link><target>ex parte Merryman</target></link></italics><space/>decision, and he averted potential British intervention in the war by defusing the<space/><link><target>Trent Affair</target></link><space/>in late 1861. Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, especially the selection of top generals, including his most successful general,<space/><link><target>Ulysses S. Grant</target></link>. He also made major decisions on Union war strategy, including a naval blockade that shut down the South's normal trade, moves to take control of Kentucky and Tennessee, and using gunboats to gain control of the southern river system. Lincoln tried repeatedly to capture the Confederate capital at<space/><link><target>Richmond, Virginia</target><part>Richmond</part></link>; each time a general failed, Lincoln substituted another, until finally Grant succeeded. As the war progressed, his complex moves toward ending slavery began with the<space/><link><target>Emancipation Proclamation</target></link><space/>of 1863; subsequently, Lincoln used the U.S. Army to protect escaped slaves, encouraged the<space/><link><target>Border States (American Civil War)</target><part>border states</part></link><space/>to outlaw slavery, and pushed through Congress the<space/><link><target>Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution</target></link>, which permanently outlawed slavery.</paragraph><paragraph>An exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state, Lincoln reached out to the War Democrats and managed his own re-election campaign in the<space/><link><target>United States presidential election, 1864</target><part>1864 presidential election</part></link>. Anticipating the war's conclusion, Lincoln pushed a moderate view of<space/><link><target>Reconstruction Era of the United States</target><part>Reconstruction</part></link>, seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness. On April 14, 1865, five days after the April 9th surrender of Confederate commanding general<space/><link><target>Robert E.
