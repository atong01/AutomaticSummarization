The '''ICC Cricket World Cup''' is the international championship of [[One Day International]] (ODI) [[cricket]]. The event is organised by the sport's governing body, the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC), with preliminary qualification rounds leading up to a finals tournament held every four years. The tournament is one of the world's most viewed sporting events and is considered the "flagship event of the international cricket calendar" by the ICC.<ref>[http://www.cricketworldcup.com/about ICC Cricket World Cup: About] – International Cricket Council. Retrieved 30 June 2013.</ref>

The first World Cup was organised [[1975 Cricket World Cup|in England in June 1975]], with the first ODI cricket match having been played only four years prior. However, a separate [[Women's Cricket World Cup]] had been held two years before the first men's tournament, and a tournament involving multiple international teams had been held as early as 1912, when a [[1912 Triangular Tournament|triangular tournament]] of [[Test cricket|Test matches]] was played between [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]], [[England national cricket team|England]] and [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]]. Each of the first three World Cups were held in England. From the [[1987 Cricket World Cup|1987 tournament]] onwards, hosting has been shared between countries under an [[Cricket World Cup hosts#Unofficial rotation system|unofficial rotation system]], with fourteen ICC members having hosted at least one match in the tournament.

The finals of the World Cup are contested by the ten [[List of International Cricket Council members#Full Members|full members]] of the ICC (all of which are [[Test cricket|Test]]-playing teams) and a number of teams made up from [[List of International Cricket Council members|associate and affiliate members]] of the ICC, selected via the [[World Cricket League]] and [[ICC World Cup Qualifier|a later qualifying tournament]]. A total of [[#Overview|twenty teams]] have competed in the eleven editions of the tournament, with fourteen competing in the 2015 tournament. Australia has won the tournament five times, with the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]], [[India national cricket team|India]] (twice each), [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] and [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] (once each) also having won the tournament. The best performance by a non-full-member team came when [[Kenya national cricket team|Kenya]] made the semi-finals of the [[2003 Cricket World Cup|2003 tournament]].

==History==
{{main|History of the Cricket World Cup}}

===Before the first Cricket World Cup===
The [[United States v Canada (1844)|first international cricket match]] was played between Canada and the United States, on 24 and 25 September 1844.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/141170.html| title=The oldest international contest of them all| author=Martin Williamson| publisher=ESPN}}</ref> However, the first credited [[Test cricket|Test match]] was played in 1877 between [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] and [[England cricket team|England]], and the two teams competed regularly for [[The Ashes]] in subsequent years. [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]] was admitted to Test status in 1889.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/australia/content/match/62396.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|date=15 March 1877|title= 1st Test Scorecard|accessdate=28 January 2007}}</ref> Representative cricket teams were selected to [[International structure of cricket|tour]] each other, resulting in bilateral competition. Cricket was also included as an Olympic sport at the [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900 Paris Games]], where [[Great Britain and Ireland at the 1900 Summer Olympics|Great Britain]] defeated [[France at the 1900 Summer Olympics|France]] to win the [[Gold medal#Olympic Games|gold medal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/columns/engine/match/320838.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|date=19 August 1900|title= Olympic Games, 1900, Final|accessdate=9 September 2006}}</ref> This was the only appearance of cricket at the [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer Olympics]].

The first multilateral competition at international level was the [[1912 Triangular Tournament]], a Test cricket tournament played in England between all three Test-playing nations at the time: England, Australia and South Africa. The event was not a success: the summer was exceptionally wet, making play difficult on damp uncovered pitches, and attendances were poor, attributed to a "surfeit of cricket".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/australia/content/story/207248.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|title= The original damp squib|date=23 April 2005|accessdate=29 August 2006| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071016161938/http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/australia/content/story/207248.html| archivedate = 16 October 2007}}</ref> Since then, international Test cricket has generally been organised as bilateral series: a multilateral Test tournament was not organised again until the triangular [[Asian Test Championship]] in 1999.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/483619.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|title= The run-out that sparked a riot|date=30 October 2010|accessdate=18 February 2015| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141022194822/http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/483619.html| archivedate = 22 October 2014}}</ref>

The number of nations playing Test cricket increased gradually over time, with the addition of [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] in 1928, [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] in 1930, [[India national cricket team|India]] in 1932, and [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] in 1952. However, international cricket continued to be played as bilateral Test matches over three, four or five days.

In the early 1960s, English [[county cricket]] teams began playing a shortened version of cricket which only lasted for one day. Starting in [[1962 English cricket season|1962]] with a four-team [[single-elimination tournament|knockout competition]] known as the Midlands Knock-Out Cup,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/510124.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|title= The low-key birth of one-day cricket|date=9 April 2011|accessdate=15 July 2014| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130919032251/http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/510124.html| archivedate = 19 September 2013}}</ref> and continuing with the inaugural [[Friends Provident Trophy|Gillette Cup]] in [[1963 English cricket season|1963]], [[Limited overs cricket|one-day cricket]] grew in popularity in England. A national [[National League (cricket)|Sunday League]] was formed in [[1969 English cricket season|1969]]. The first One-Day International match was played on the fifth day of a rain-aborted Test match between England and Australia at Melbourne in [[English cricket team in Australia in 1970–71|1971]], to fill the time available and as compensation for the frustrated crowd. It was a forty [[over (cricket)|over]] game with eight balls per over.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newicc.cricket.org/icc/odi/what_is_one-day_cricket.html |publisher=newicc.cricket.org |title=What is One-Day International cricket? |accessdate=10 September 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20061119054342/http://newicc.cricket.org:80/icc/odi/what_is_one-day_cricket.html |archivedate=19 November 2006 }}</ref>

In the late 1970s, [[Kerry Packer]] established the rival [[World Series Cricket]] (WSC) competition. It introduced many of the now commonplace features of [[One Day International cricket]], including coloured uniforms, matches played at night under floodlights with a white ball and dark sight screens, and, for television broadcasts, multiple camera angles, effects microphones to capture sounds from the players on the pitch, and on-screen graphics. The first of the matches with coloured uniforms was the WSC Australians in wattle gold versus WSC West Indians in coral pink, played at VFL Park in Melbourne on 17 January 1979. The success and popularity of the domestic one-day competitions in England and other parts of the world, as well as the early One-Day Internationals, prompted the ICC to consider organising a Cricket World Cup.<ref name="WCHistory">{{cite web|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/story/264535.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|title= The World Cup&nbsp;– A brief history|accessdate=7 December 2006}}</ref>

===Prudential World Cups (1975–1983)===
[[Image:Prudential Cup.jpg|thumb|200px|The Prudential Cup trophy]]
The [[1975 ICC Cricket World Cup|inaugural Cricket World Cup]] was hosted in 1975 by England, the only nation able to put forward the resources to stage an event of such magnitude at the time. The 1975 tournament started on 7 June.<ref name="ENGHOST">{{cite web|url=http://www.cricworld.com/news/wchistory03feb.htm|publisher=cricworld.com|title= The History of World Cup's|accessdate=19 September 2006}}</ref> The first three events were held in England and officially known as the Prudential Cup after the sponsors [[Prudential plc]]. The matches consisted of 60 six-ball overs per team, played during the daytime in traditional form, with the players wearing [[cricket clothing and equipment|cricket whites]] and using red [[cricket ball]]s.<ref>Browning (1999), pp. 5–9</ref>

Eight teams participated in the first tournament: Australia, England, India, [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]], Pakistan, and the [[West Indies]] (the six Test nations at the time), together with Sri Lanka and a composite team from [[East African cricket team|East Africa]].<ref name=cricket>Browning (1999), pp. 26–31</ref> One notable omission was [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]], who were banned from international cricket due to [[apartheid]]. The tournament was won by the West Indies, who defeated Australia by 17 [[run (cricket)|runs]] in the final at [[Lord's Cricket Ground|Lord's]].<ref name=cricket/>

The [[1979 ICC Cricket World Cup|1979 World Cup]] saw the introduction of the [[ICC Trophy]] competition to select non-Test playing teams for the World Cup,<ref name="ICCTROPHY">{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/WORLD_CUPS/ICCT2005/ARTICLES/history.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|title= ICC Trophy&nbsp;– A brief history|accessdate=29 August 2006}}</ref> with Sri Lanka and [[Canadian cricket team|Canada]] qualifying.<ref name=history>Browning (1999), pp. 32–35</ref> The West Indies won a second consecutive World Cup tournament, defeating the hosts England by 92 runs in the final. At a meeting which followed the World Cup, the International Cricket Conference agreed to make the competition a quadrennial event.<ref name=history/>

The [[1983 ICC Cricket World Cup|1983 event]] was hosted by England for a third consecutive time. By this stage, Sri Lanka had become a Test-playing nation, and [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]] qualified through the ICC Trophy. A [[Fielding restrictions (cricket)|fielding circle]] was introduced, {{convert|30|yd|m}} away from the [[stump (cricket)|stumps]]. Four [[fielding (cricket)|fieldsmen]] needed to be inside it at all times.<ref>Browning (1999), pp. 61–62</ref> The teams faced each other twice, before moving into the knock-outs. India, an outsider quoted at 66–1 to win by bookmakers before the competition began, were crowned champions after upsetting the West Indies by 43 runs in the final.<ref name="WCHistory"/><ref>Browning (1999), pp. 105–110</ref>

=== Different champions (1987–1996) ===
India and Pakistan jointly hosted the [[1987 ICC Cricket World Cup|1987 tournament]], the first time that the competition was held outside England. The games were reduced from 60 to 50 overs per innings, the current standard, because of the shorter daylight hours in the [[Indian subcontinent]] compared with England's summer.<ref>Browning (1999), pp. 111–116</ref> Australia won the championship by defeating England by 7 runs in the final, the closest margin in World Cup final history.<ref>Browning (1999), pp. 155–159</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/cworldcup/history.htm|publisher=A.Srinivas|title=Cricket World Cup 2003|accessdate=28 January 2007|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/cworldcup/history.htm&date=2009-10-25+18:00:35|archivedate=25 October 2009}}</ref>

The [[1992 ICC Cricket World Cup|1992 World Cup]], held in Australia and New Zealand, introduced many changes to the game, such as coloured clothing, white balls, [[Day/Night ODI|day/night]] matches, and a change to the fielding restriction rules. The South African cricket team participated in the event for the first time, following the fall of the apartheid regime and the end of the international sports [[boycott]].<ref>Browning (1999), pp. 160–161</ref> Pakistan overcame a dismal start in the tournament to eventually defeat England by 22 runs in the final and emerge as winners.<ref>Browning (1999), pp. 211–214</ref>

The [[1996 ICC Cricket World Cup|1996 championship]] was held in the Indian subcontinent for a second time, with the inclusion of Sri Lanka as host for some of its group stage matches.<ref>Browning (1999), pp. 215–217</ref> In the semi-final, Sri Lanka, heading towards a crushing victory over India at [[Eden Gardens]] after the hosts lost eight [[wicket]]s while scoring 120 runs in pursuit of 252, were awarded victory by default after crowd unrest broke out in protest against the Indian performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketfundas.com/wc96indslsf1march13.html|publisher=cricketfundas|title=1996 Semi-final scoreboard|accessdate=28 January 2007}}</ref> Sri Lanka went on to win their maiden championship by defeating Australia by seven wickets in the final at [[Lahore]].<ref>Browning (1999), pp. 264–274</ref>

===Australian treble (1999–2007)===
In 1999 the [[1999 ICC Cricket World Cup|event]] was hosted by England, with some matches also being held in Scotland, Ireland, Wales and the Netherlands.<ref>Browning (1999), p. 274</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iZq8BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA7&dq=1999+cricket+world+cup+host&hl=en&sa=X&ei=d2qJVJyDMYuzUembgYgJ&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=1999%20cricket%20world%20cup%20host&f=false |title=Cricket World Cup: A Summary of the Tournaments Since 1975 |author=French Toast |publisher=Smashwords |year=2014 |format=e-book |accessdate=11 December 2014}}</ref> Twelve teams contested the World Cup.

South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya hosted the [[2003 ICC Cricket World Cup|2003 World Cup]]. The number of teams participating in the event increased from twelve to fourteen. [[Kenya national cricket team|Kenya]]'s victories over Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, among others&nbsp;– and a forfeit by the New Zealand team, which refused to play in Kenya because of security concerns&nbsp;– enabled Kenya to reach the semi-finals, the best result by an associate.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wctimeline/content/current/story/795703.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|title=Washouts, walkovers, and black armband protests|accessdate=30 August 2015| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150830100350/http://www.espncricinfo.com/wctimeline/content/current/story/795703.html| archivedate = 30 August 2015}}</ref> In the final, Australia made 359 runs for the loss of two wickets, the largest ever total in a final, defeating India by 125 runs.<ref name="AUS2003">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/cwc2003/hi/newsid_2870000/newsid_2875100/2875135.stm |publisher=BBC |title=Ruthless Aussies lift World Cup|date=23 March 2003 |accessdate=29 January 2007 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title = Full tournament schedule |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/cwc2003/hi/fixturesresults/default.stm |publisher=BBC   | date = 23 March 2003 | accessdate =22 February 2007 | location=London}}</ref>

===Qualification===
{{main|Cricket World Cup qualification}}
The Test-playing nations qualify automatically for the World Cup main event, while the other teams have to qualify through a series of preliminary qualifying tournaments. A new qualifying format was introduced for the [[2015 Cricket World Cup]]. The top two teams of the [[2011–13 ICC World Cricket League Championship]] qualify directly. The remaining six teams join the third and fourth-placed teams of [[2011 ICC World Cricket League Division Two]] and the top two teams of the [[2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Three]] in the [[2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier|World Cup Qualifier]] to decide the remaining two places.<ref>{{cite web |title=Results of the ICC Chief Executives' Committee meeting in London |url=http://icc-cricket.yahoo.net/newsdetails.php?newsId=17042_1315836720 |date=12 September 2011 |accessdate=13 September 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=ICC spells out 2015 WC qualification plan |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci-icc/content/current/story/535977.html |work=ESPNcricinfo |publisher=ESPN Sports Media |date=11 October 2011 |accessdate=11 October 2011 }}</ref>

Qualifying tournaments were introduced for the [[1979 Cricket World Cup|second World Cup]], where two of the eight places in the finals were awarded to the leading teams in the [[ICC Trophy]].<ref name="ICCTROPHY"/> The number of teams selected through the ICC Trophy had varied throughout the years. The [[World Cricket League]] (administered by the [[International Cricket Council]]) is the qualification system provided to allow the [[ICC associate membership|Associate]] and [[List of International Cricket Council members#Affiliate Members|Affiliate]] members of the ICC more opportunities to qualify.

Under the current qualifying process, the World Cricket League, all Associate and Affiliate members of the ICC are able to qualify for the World Cup. Associate and Affiliate members must play between two and five stages in the ICC World Cricket League to qualify for the World Cup finals, depending on the Division in which they start the qualifying process.

The format of the Cricket World Cup has changed greatly over the course of its history. Each of the first four tournaments was played by eight teams, divided into two groups of four.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://icc.cricket.org/icc/events/summaries/icc_world_cup_1975.html|publisher=[[icc.cricket.org]]|title=1st tournament|accessdate=19 February 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071217093647/http://icc.cricket.org/icc/events/summaries/icc_world_cup_1975.html| archivedate = 17 December 2007}}</ref> The competition consisted of two stages, a group stage and a [[single-elimination tournament|knock-out]] stage. The four teams in each group played each other in the [[round-robin tournament|round-robin]] group stage, with the top two teams in each group progressing to the semi-finals. The winners of the semi-finals played against each other in the final. With South Africa returning in the fifth tournament in 1992 as a result of the end of the apartheid boycott, nine teams played each other once in the group phase, and the top four teams progressed to the semi-finals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://icc.cricket.org/icc/events/summaries/icc_world_cup_199192.html|publisher=[[icc.cricket.org]]|title=92 tournament|accessdate=19 February 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071217093653/http://icc.cricket.org/icc/events/summaries/icc_world_cup_199192.html |archivedate = 17 December 2007}}</ref> The tournament was further expanded in 1996, with two groups of six teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://icc.cricket.org/icc/events/summaries/icc_world_cup_199596.html|publisher=[[icc.cricket.org]]|title=96 tournament|accessdate=19 February 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071217093658/http://icc.cricket.org/icc/events/summaries/icc_world_cup_199596.html| archivedate = 17 December 2007}}</ref> The top four teams from each group progressed to quarter-finals and semi-finals.

A distinct format was used for the [[1999 Cricket World Cup|1999]] and [[2003 Cricket World Cup|2003]] World Cups. The teams were split into two pools, with the top three teams in each pool advancing to the ''Super 6''.<ref name="super6">{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/ARCHIVE/WORLD_CUPS/WC99/WC99_TABLE.html|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|title=Super 6|accessdate=19 February 2007}}</ref> The ''Super 6'' teams played the three other teams that advanced from the other group.

The format used in the [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007 World Cup]] involved 16 teams allocated into four groups of four.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketworldcup.com/TeamGroupings.html|publisher=cricket world cup|title=World Cup groups|accessdate=28 January 2007}}</ref> Within each group, the teams played each other in a round-robin format. Teams earned points for wins and half-points for ties. The top two teams from each group moved forward to the ''Super 8'' round. The ''Super 8'' teams played the other six teams that progressed from the different groups. Teams earned points in the same way as the group stage, but carried their points forward from previous matches against the other teams who qualified from the same group to the ''Super 8'' stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketworldcup.com/pdfs/event-overview.pdf|publisher=cricketworldcup.com|title= About the Event|accessdate=2 September 2006|page=1|format=PDF}}</ref> The top four teams from the ''Super 8'' round advanced to the semi-finals, and the winners of the semi-finals played in the final.

==Trophy==
{{main|Cricket World Cup Trophy}}
The ICC Cricket World Cup Trophy is presented to the winners of the World Cup. The current trophy was created for the 1999 championships, and was the first permanent prize in the tournament's history. Prior to this, different trophies were made for each World Cup.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cricket-worldcup2015.net/2015/02/trophy-is-first-permanent-prize-in-cricket-world-cup.html |publisher=cricket-worldcup2015.net|title=Trophy is first permanent prize in Cricket World Cup|accessdate=9 November 2007}}</ref> <!--is this right? were there different Prudential Cups, or was the same Cup used three times? --> The trophy was designed and produced in London by a team of craftsmen from [[Garrard & Co]] over a period of two months.

The current trophy is made from silver and [[gilding|gild]], and features a golden globe held up by three silver columns. The columns, shaped as [[stump (cricket)|stumps]] and [[bail (cricket)|bails]], represent the three fundamental aspects of cricket: [[batting (cricket)|batting]], [[bowling (cricket)|bowling]] and [[fielding (cricket)|fielding]], while the globe characterises a [[cricket ball]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.webindia123.com/Sports/cricket/iccworldcup/history.htm |publisher=webindia123.com|title=Cricket World Cup- Past Glimpses|accessdate=31 October 2007}}</ref> The seam is tilted to symbolize the [[axial tilt]] of the Earth.  It stands 60&nbsp;centimetres high and weighs approximately 11&nbsp;kilograms. The names of the previous winners are [[engraving|engraved]] on the base of the trophy, with space for a total of twenty inscriptions. The ICC keeps the original trophy. A replica differing only in the inscriptions is permanently awarded to the winning team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/cricket-world-cup/about|publisher=[[International Cricket Council]]|title= About the Tournament

==Selection of hosts==
[[Image:Civic Centre-2003 CWC.jpg|thumb|Civic Centre, South Africa honours the 2003 World Cup.]]{{main|Cricket World Cup hosts}}
The International Cricket Council's executive committee votes for the hosts of the tournament after examining the bids made by the nations keen to hold a Cricket World Cup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/245789.html|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|title=Asia to host 2011 World Cup|date=30 April 2006|accessdate=9 February 2007}}</ref>

England hosted the first three competitions. The ICC decided that England should host the first tournament because it was ready to devote the resources required to organising the inaugural event.<ref name="ENGHOST"/> India volunteered to host the third Cricket World Cup, but most ICC members preferred England as the longer period of daylight in England in June meant that a match could be completed in one day.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www1.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/WORLD_CUPS/WC_HISTORY/WC79_HISTORY.html |publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|title= The 1979 World Cup in England&nbsp;– West Indies retain their title|accessdate=19 September 2006}}</ref> The [[1987 Cricket World Cup]] was held in India and Pakistan, the first hosted outside England.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/WORLD_CUPS/WC_HISTORY/WC87_HISTORY.html |publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|title= The 1987 World Cup in India and Pakistan&nbsp;– Australia win tight tournament|accessdate=15 July 2014}}</ref>

Many of the tournaments have been jointly hosted by nations from the same geographical region, such as South Asia in 1987, 1996 and 2011, [[Australasia]] in 1992 and 2015, Southern Africa in 2003 and [[West Indies]] in 2007.
