{{Covert United States involvement in regime change}}
The '''contras''' (some references use the capitalized form, "'''Contras'''") is a label given to the various U.S.-backed and funded terrorist rebel groups that were active from 1979 through to the early 1990s in opposition to the left-wing, socialist [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista]] [[Junta of National Reconstruction]] government in [[Nicaragua]]. Among the separate contra groups, the [[Nicaraguan Democratic Force]] (FDN) emerged as the largest by far. In 1987, virtually all contra organizations were united, at least nominally, into the [[Nicaraguan Resistance]].

From an early stage, the rebels received financial and military [[United States and state-sponsored terrorism#The Contras|support from the United States government]], and their military significance decisively depended on it. After US support was banned by [[United States Congress|Congress]], the [[Reagan administration]] covertly continued it. These covert activities culminated in the [[Iran–Contra affair]].

The term "contra" comes from the Spanish ''contra,'' which means ''against'' but in this case is short for {{lang|es|''la contrarrevolución''}}, in English "the [[counter-revolution]]".  Some rebels disliked being called contras, feeling that it defined their cause only in negative terms, or implied a desire to restore the old order. Rebel fighters usually referred to themselves as {{lang|es|''comandos''}} ("commandos"); peasant sympathizers also called the rebels {{lang|es|''los primos''}} ("the cousins"). From the mid-1980s, as the Reagan administration and the rebels sought to portray the movement as the "democratic resistance," members started describing themselves as {{lang|es|''la resistencia''}}.

During their war against the Nicaraguan government, the Contras committed a large number of [[human rights violations]] and used [[terrorist]] tactics<ref name="Non-governmental Terrorism">{{cite journal|last=Feldmann|first=Andreas E.|author2=Maiju Perälä |title=Reassessing the Causes of Nongovernmental Terrorism in Latin America|journal=Latin American Politics and Society|date=July 2004|volume=46|issue=2|pages=101–132|doi=10.1111/j.1548-2456.2004.tb00277.x|accessdate=25 May 2014}}</ref><ref name="Grandin & Joseph">{{cite book|author1=[[Greg Grandin]]|author2=Gilbert M.

==History==

===Origins===
The Contras were not a monolithic group, but a combination of three distinct elements of Nicaraguan society:<ref name="Lee et al. 1987, p. 29"/>

* Ex-guardsmen of the [[Nicaraguan National Guard]] and other right-wing figures who had fought for Nicaragua's ex-dictator [[Somoza]]<ref name="Lee et al. 1987, p. 29">Lee et al. 1987, p. 29</ref>—these later were especially found in the military wing of the [[Nicaraguan Democratic Force]] (FDN).<ref>"The contras are made up of a combination of: ex-National Guardsmen (especially the military wing of the FDN),..." As seen at: Gill 1984, p. 204</ref> Remnants of the Guard later formed groups such as the [[Fifteenth of September Legion]], the Anti-Sandinista Guerrilla Special Forces, and the National Army of Liberation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Initially however, these groups were small and conducted little active raiding into Nicaragua.<ref>Dickey, Christopher. With the Contras, A Reporter in the Wilds of Nicaragua. Simon & Schuster, 1985.</ref>
* Anti-Somozistas who had supported the revolution but felt betrayed by the Sandinista government<ref name="Lee et al. 1987, p. 29"/> – e.g. [[Edgar Chamorro]], prominent member of the political directorate of the FDN,<ref>"The contras are made up of a combination of: ... anti-Sandinista opponents of ex-dictator Somoza (some of the members of the FDN political directorate eg Messrs. Chamorro and Cruz)..." As seen at: Gill 1984, p. 204</ref> or [[Jose Francisco Cardenal]], who had briefly served in the Council of State before leaving Nicaragua out of disagreement with the Sandinista government's policies and founding the [[Nicaraguan Democratic Union|Nicaraguan Democratic Union (UDN)]], an opposition group of Nicaraguan exiles in Miami.<ref>International Court of Justice (IV) (1986), p. 446</ref> Another example are the [[MILPAS]] (Milicias Populares Anti-Sandinistas), peasant [[militia]]s led by disillusioned Sandinista veterans from the northern mountains. Founded by [[Pedro Joaquín González]] (known as "Dimas"), the Milpistas were also known as {{lang|es|''chilotes''}} (green corn). Even after his death, other MILPAS bands sprouted during 1980–1981. The Milpistas were composed largely of {{lang|es|''campesino''}} ([[peasant]]) highlanders and rural workers.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dillon |first=Sam |title=Comandos: The CIA and Nicaragua's Contra Rebels |year=1991 |publisher=Henry Holt |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8050-1475-4 |oclc=23974023 |pages=49–56}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Horton |first=Lynn |title=Peasants in Arms: War and Peace in the Mountains of Nicaragua, 1979–1994 |year=1998 |publisher=Ohio University Center for International Studies |location=Athens |isbn=978-0-89680-204-9 |oclc=39157572 |pages=95–117}}</ref><ref>Padro-Maurer, R.

===Main groups===

The [[CIA]] and [[Argentine intelligence]], seeking to unify the anti-Sandinista cause before initiating large-scale aid, persuaded 15 September Legion, the UDN and several former smaller groups to merge in September 1981 as the [[Nicaraguan Democratic Force]] (''Fuerza Democrática Nicaragüense'', FDN).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/reports/general-reports-1/cocaine/contra-story/orgs.html |title=Contra Organizations: The Contra Story — Central Intelligence Agency |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-08-18}}</ref> Although the FDN had its roots in two groups made up of former National Guardsmen (of the Somoza regime), its joint political directorate was led by businessman and former anti-Somoza activist [[Adolfo Calero|Adolfo Calero Portocarrero]].<ref>"Although Calero had opposed Somoza, the FDN had its roots in two insurgent groups made up of former National Guardsmen..." As seen at: Lee et al. 1987, p. 29</ref> [[Edgar Chamorro]] later stated that there was strong opposition within the UDN against working with the Guardsmen and that the merging only took place because of insistence by the CIA.<ref>"The UDN, including Cardenal, initially opposed any linkage with the Guardsmen. The CIA, and high-ranking United States Government officiais, insisted that we merge with the Guardsmen. Lt. General Vernon Walters, then a special assistant to the United States Secretary of State (and formerly Deputy Director of the CIA) met with Cardenal to encourage him to accept the CIA's proposal. We were well aware of the crimes the Guardsmen had committed against the Nicaraguan people while in the service of President Somoza and we wanted nothing to do with them. However, we recognized that without help from the United States Government we had no chance of removing the Sandinistas from power, so we eventually acceded to the CIA's, and General Walters', insistence that we join forces with the Guardsmen. Some UDN memhers resigned because they would not associate themselves with the National Guard under any circumstances, but Cardenal and I and others believed the CIA's assurances that we, the civilians, would control the Guardsmen in the new organization that was to he created." As seen at: International Court of Justice (IV) 1986, p. 446</ref>

Based in [[Honduras]], Nicaragua's northern neighbor, under the command of former [[Guardia Nacional (Nicaragua)|National Guard]] Colonel [[Enrique Bermúdez]], the new FDN commenced to draw in other smaller insurgent forces in the north.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Largely financed, trained, equipped, armed and organized by the U.S.,<ref>"On the basis of the available information, the Court is not able to satisfy itself that the Respondent State "created" the contra force in Nicaragua, but holds it established that it largely financed, trained, equipped, armed and organized the FDN, one element of the force."

In April 1982, [[Edén Pastora]] (''Comandante Cero''), one of the heroes in the fight against Somoza, organized the Sandinista Revolutionary Front (FRS) – embedded in the [[Democratic Revolutionary Alliance]] (ARDE)<ref name="Williams">{{Cite news| last = Williams| first = Adam| title = Edén Pastora: A wanted man| work = The Tico Times| accessdate =22 May 2011| date = 26 November 2010| url = http://www.ticotimes.net/News/Top-Story/News/Eden-Pastora-A-wanted-man_Friday-November-26-2010}}</ref> – and declared war on the Sandinista government.<ref name="Lee et al. 1987, p. 32">Lee et al. 1987, p. 32</ref> Himself a former Sandinista who had held several high posts in the government, he had resigned abruptly in 1981 and defected,<ref name="Lee et al. 1987, p. 32"/> believing that the newly found power had corrupted the Sandinista's original ideas.<ref name="Williams"/> A popular and charismatic leader, Pastora initially saw his group develop quickly.<ref name="Lee et al. 1987, p. 32"/> He confined himself to operate in the southern part of Nicaragua;<ref>"He insisted on operating in the southern part of Nicaragua."

A third force, Misurasata, appeared among the [[Miskito people|Miskito]], [[Sumo (people)|Sumo]] and Rama [[Amerindian]] peoples of Nicaragua's Atlantic coast, who in December 1981 found themselves in conflict with the authorities following the government's efforts to nationalize [[Indigenous people of the Americas|Indian]] land. In the course of this conflict, forced removal of at least 10,000 Indians to relocation centers in the interior of the country and subsequent burning of some villages took place.<ref>The Americas Watch Committee. "Human Rights in Nicaragua 1986" (print), Americas Watch, February 1987.</ref> The Misurasata movement split in 1983, with the breakaway Misura group of [[Stedman Fagoth Muller]] allying itself more closely with the FDN, and the rest accommodating themselves with the Sandinistas: On 8 December 1984 a ceasefire agreement known as the Bogota Accord was signed by Misurasata and the Nicaraguan government.<ref>http://www.incore.ulst.ac.uk/services/cds/agreements/pdf/nic2.pdf</ref> A subsequent autonomy statute in September 1987 largely defused Miskito resistance.<ref>[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cescr/docs/info-ngos/mrginicaragua39wg.pdf ] {{wayback|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cescr/docs/info-ngos/mrginicaragua39wg.pdf |date=20120916224139 }}</ref>

===Unity efforts===
U.S. officials were active in attempting to unite the Contra groups. In June 1985 most of the groups reorganized as the [[United Nicaraguan Opposition]] (UNO), under the leadership of [[Adolfo Calero]], [[Arturo Cruz]] and [[Alfonso Robelo]], all originally supporters of the anti-Somoza revolution. After UNO's dissolution early in 1987, the [[Nicaraguan Resistance]] (RN) was organized along similar lines in May.

==U.S. military and financial assistance==

In front of the [[International Court of Justice]], Nicaragua claimed that the contras were altogether a creation of the U.S.<ref name="Gill 1989, p. 328">Gill 1989, p. 328</ref> This claim was rejected.<ref name="Gill 1989, p. 328"/> However, the evidence of a very close relationship between the contras and the United States was considered overwhelming and incontrovertible.<ref>Gill 1989, p. 329</ref> The U.S. played a very large role in financing, training, arming, and advising the contras over a long period, and the contras only became capable of carrying out significant military operations as a result of this support.<ref>"The United States has played a very large role in financing, training, arming, and advising the contras over a long period.

On 4 January 1982, Reagan signed the [[Classified information|top secret]] National Security Decision Directive 17 (NSDD-17),<ref name="Fas.org"/> giving the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] the authority to recruit and support the contras with $19 million in military aid. The effort to support the contras was one component of the [[Reagan Doctrine]], which called for providing military support to movements opposing [[Soviet Union|Soviet-supported]], communist [[communist state|governments]].

By December 1981, however, the United States had already begun to support armed opponents of the Sandinista government. From the beginning, the CIA was in charge.<ref>Lee et al. 1987, p.3</ref> The arming, clothing, feeding and supervision of the contras<ref name="Lee et al. 1987, p. 3">Lee et al. 1987, p. 3</ref> became the most ambitious paramilitary and political action operation mounted by the agency in nearly a decade.<ref>"In December 1982, the ''New York Times'' reported intelligence officials as saying that Washington's ‘covert activities have... become the most ambitious paramilitary and political action operation mounted by the C.I.A. in nearly a decade...‘" As seen at: Lee et al. 1987, p. 33</ref>

In the fiscal year 1984, the U.S. Congress approved $24 million in contra aid.<ref name="Lee et al. 1987, p. 3">Lee et al. 1987, p. 3</ref> However, since the contras failed to win widespread popular support or military victories within Nicaragua,<ref name="Lee et al. 1987, p. 3"/> opinion polls indicated that a majority of the U.S. public was not supportive of the contras,<ref>"...opinion polls indicated that a majority of the public was not supportive."

Nevertheless, the case for support of the contras continued to be made in Washington, D.C., by both the Reagan administration and the [[Heritage Foundation]], which argued that support for the contras would counter Soviet influence in Nicaragua.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/PolicyRev-1987q2-00032|title="The Lessons of Afghanistan",  by Michael Johns, Policy Review, March 1987, pp. 32-35|work=UNZ.org}}</ref>

On 1 May 1985 President Reagan announced that his administration perceived Nicaragua to be "an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States", and declared a "national emergency" and a [[United States embargo against Nicaragua|trade embargo]] against Nicaragua to "deal with that threat".<ref>[http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/12513.html "Executive Order 12513--Prohibiting trade and certain other transactions involving Nicaragua"] National Archives</ref> On May 16, 1985, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega redeclared "a position of nonalignment" during his failed mission to try and collect military aid from France, Spain, and Italy. Ortega managed to gain warm words of political and economic support but military aid was ruled out. In 1982, France sold Nicaragua about $17 million worth of arms before U.S. anger made them terminate the deal. A French Foreign Ministry official explained that this reticence resulted, "because we have limited power to maneuver in Central America, and after all, the region is in America's backyard."<ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/1985/0516/oteg.html "Ortega collects warm words of support on European trip. Yet his visit is unlikely to drum up much concrete aid "] Christian Science Monitor, May 16, 1985</ref>

With Congress blocking further contra aid, the Reagan administration sought to arrange funding and military supplies by means of third countries and private sources.<ref name="Lee et al. 1987, p. 4">Lee et al. 1987, p. 4</ref> Between 1984 and 1986, $34 million from third countries and $2.7 million from private sources were raised this way.<ref name="Lee et al. 1987, p. 4"/> The secret contra assistance was run by the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], with officer Lt. Col. [[Oliver North]] in charge.<ref>Lee et al 1987, p. 4</ref> With the third-party funds, North created an organization called "The Enterprise" which served as the secret arm of the NSC staff and had its own airplanes, pilots, airfield, ship, operatives and secret Swiss bank accounts.<ref name="Lee et al. 1987, p. 4"/> It also received assistance from personnel from other government agencies, especially from CIA personnel in Central America.<ref name="Lee et al. 1987, p. 4"/> This operation functioned, however, without any of the accountability required of U.S. government activities.<ref name="Lee et al. 1987, p. 4"/> The Enterprise's efforts culminated in the [[Iran Contra affair|Iran–Contra Affair of 1986–1987]], which facilitated contra funding through the proceeds of arms sales to Iran.

According to the [[National Security Archive]], [[Oliver North]] had been in contact with [[Manuel Noriega]], the military leader of [[Panama]] later convicted on drug charges, whom he personally met. The issue of drug money and its importance in funding the Nicaraguan conflict was the subject of various reports and publications.

In August 1996, ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' reporter [[Gary Webb]] published a series titled ''Dark Alliance'', alleging that the contras contributed to the rise of [[crack cocaine]] in California.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB2/nsaebb2.htm|title=The Contras, Cocaine, and Covert Operations|work=gwu.edu}}</ref> In his subsequent 1999 book, also titled ''[[Dark Alliance]]'', Webb asserted that the Reagan administration helped harbor known drug traffickers, offering political asylum to some, to help raise funds for the rebel effort.<ref>{{cite book |last=Webb |first=Gary |year=1999 |page=177 |title=[[Dark Alliance]] |publisher=[[Seven Stories Press]] |isbn=978-1-888363-93-7 |ref=harv}}</ref>

===Propaganda===
During the time the US Congress blocked funding for the contras, the Reagan government engaged in a campaign to alter public opinion and change the vote in Congress on contra aid.<ref name="Lee et al. 1987, p. 5">Lee et al. 1987, p. 5</ref> For this purpose, the [[United States National Security Council|NSC]] established an interagency working group which in turn coordinated the [[Office of Public Diplomacy]] for Latin America and the Caribbean (managed by [[Otto Reich]]), which conducted the campaign.<ref name="Lee et al. 1987, p. 5"/> The S/LPD produced and widely disseminated a variety of pro-contra publications, arranged speeches and press conferences.<ref name="Lee et al. 1987, p. 5"/> It also disseminated "white propaganda"—pro-contra newspaper articles by paid consultants who did not disclose their connection to the Reagan administration.<ref>"It also disseminated what one official termed "white propaganda": pro-Contra newspaper articles by paid consultants who did not disclose their connection to the Administration." As seen at: Lee et al. 1987, p. 5</ref>

On top of that, [[Oliver North]] helped Carl Channell's tax-exempt organization, the "National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty", to raise $10 million, by arranging numerous briefings for groups of potential contributors at the premises of the White House and by facilitating private visits and photo sessions with President Reagan for major contributors.<ref name="Lee et al. 1987, p. 6">Lee et al. 1987, p. 6</ref> Channell in turn, used part of that money to run a series of television advertisements directed at home districts of [[congressman|Congressmen]] considered to be swing votes on contra aid.<ref name="Lee et al. 1987, p. 6"/> Out of the $10 million raised, more than $1 million was spent on pro-contra publicity.<ref name="Lee et al. 1987, p. 6"/>

===International Court of Justice ruling===
{{Main|Nicaragua v. United States}}
In 1984 the Sandinista government filed a suit in the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) against the United States (''Nicaragua v. United States''), which resulted in a 1986 judgment against the United States. The ICJ held that the U.S. had violated [[international law]] by supporting the contras in their rebellion against the Nicaraguan government and by [[Naval mine|mining]] Nicaragua's harbors. Regarding the alleged human rights violations by the contras, however, the ICJ took the view that the United States could only be held accountable for them if it would have been proven that the U.S. had effective control of the contra operations resulting in these alleged violations.<ref>"Having reached the above conclusion, the Court takes the view that the contras remain responsible for their acts, in particular the alleged violations by them of humanitarian law. For the United States to be legally responsible, it would have to be proved that that State had effective control of the operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed." As seen at: International Court of Justice 1986, VII (5)</ref> Nevertheless, the ICJ found that the U.S. encouraged acts contrary to general principles of humanitarian law by producing the manual ''[[Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare]] (Operaciones sicológicas en guerra de guerrillas'') and disseminating it to the contras.<ref>"...Finds that the United States of America, by producing in 1983 a manual entitled "Operaciones sicológicas en guerra de guerrillas", and disseminating it to contra forces, has encouraged the commission by them of acts contrary to general principles of humanitarian law." As seen at: International Court of Justice 1986, (9)</ref> The manual, amongst other things, advised on how to rationalize killings of civilians<ref name="ReferenceC">"In the case of shooting "a citizen who was trying to leave the town or city in which the guerrillas are carrying out armed propaganda or political proselytism", the manual suggests that the contras "explain that if that citizen had managed to escape, he would have alerted the enemy." As seen at: Sklar 1988, p. 179</ref> and recommended to hire professional killers for specific selective tasks.<ref name="Sklar 1988, p. 181">Sklar 1988, p. 181</ref>

The United States, which did not participate in the merits phase of the proceedings, maintained that the ICJ's power did not supersede the [[Constitution of the United States]] and argued that the court did not seriously consider the Nicaraguan role in El Salvador, while it accused Nicaragua of actively supporting armed groups there, specifically in the form of supply of arms.<ref>International Court of Justice 1986, VIII (1)</ref> The ICJ had found that evidence of a responsibility of the Nicaraguan government in this matter was insufficient.<ref>"In any event the evidence is insufficient to satisfy the Court that the Government of Nicaragua was responsible for any flow of arms at either period." As seen at: International Court of Justice 1986, VIII (1)</ref> The U.S. argument was affirmed, however, by the dissenting opinion of ICJ member U.S. Judge Schwebel,<ref>"But the Court, remarkably enough, while finding the United States responsible for intervention in Nicaragua, failed to recognize Nicaragua's prior and continuing intervention in El Salvador." As seen at: International Court of Justice 1986, Dissenting Opinion of Judge Schwebel</ref> who concluded that in supporting the contras, the United States acted lawfully in collective self-defence in El Salvador's support.<ref>"...concluded that the United States essentially acted lawfully in exerting armed pressures against Nicaragua, both directly and through its support of the contras, because Nicaragua's prior and sustained support of armed insurgency in El Salvador was tantamount to an armed attack upon El Salvador against which the United States could react in collective self-defence in El Salvador's support." As seen at: International Court of Justice 1986, Dissenting Opinion of Judge Schwebel</ref> The U.S. blocked enforcement of the ICJ judgment by the [[United Nations Security Council]] and thereby prevented Nicaragua from obtaining any actual compensation.<ref name="law">{{cite journal | author= Morrison, Fred L. | title=Legal Issues in The Nicaragua Opinion| journal=American Journal of International Law |date=January 1987 | volume=81 | issue=1| pages= 160–166| url= http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/55750.html | doi=10.2307/2202146 | jstor= 2202146}} "Appraisals of the ICJ's Decision.

==Human rights violations==
Americas Watch – which subsequently became part of [[Human Rights Watch]] –  accused the Contras of:<ref name=AW1986>{{cite news|title=Human Rights in Nicaragua 1986|author=The Americas Watch Committee|publisher=Americas Watch|date=February 1987}}</ref>
*targeting health care clinics and health care workers for assassination<ref name="ReferenceA">Human Rights in Nicaragua 1986, p. 21</ref>

*raping women<ref name="ReferenceA"/>
*indiscriminately attacking civilians and civilian houses<ref name="ReferenceB"/>
*seizing civilian property<ref name="ReferenceA"/>
*burning civilian houses in captured towns.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Human Rights Watch released a report on the situation in 1989, which stated: "[The] contras were major and systematic violators of the most basic standards of the laws of armed conflict, including by launching indiscriminate attacks on civilians, selectively murdering non-combatants, and mistreating prisoners."<ref name="NICARAGUA">[http://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1989/WR89/Nicaragu.htm "NICARAGUA"] Human Rights Watch, 1989</ref>

In his affidavit to the World Court, former contra Edgar Chamorro testified that "The CIA did not discourage such tactics. To the contrary, the Agency severely criticized me when I admitted to the press that the FDN had regularly kidnapped and executed agrarian reform workers and civilians. We were told that the only way to defeat the Sandinistas was to...kill, kidnap, rob and torture..."<ref>[http://www.williamgbecker.com/chamorroaffidavit.pdf "Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua V. United States of America): Affidavit of Edgar Chamarro"] International Court of Justice, 5 September 1985</ref>

Contra leader [[Adolfo Calero]] denied that his forces deliberately targeted civilians:  "What they call a cooperative is also a troop concentration full of armed people. We are not killing civilians. We are fighting armed people and returning fire when fire is directed at us."<ref>''New York Times'', 23 November 1984.</ref>

===Controversy===
U.S. news media published several articles accusing Americas Watch and other bodies of ideological bias and unreliable reporting. It alleged that Americas Watch gave too much credence to alleged Contra abuses and systematically tried to discredit Nicaraguan human rights groups such as the [[Permanent Commission on Human Rights]], which blamed the major human rights abuses on the Sandinistas.<ref>''[[The New Republic]]'', 20 January 1986; ''[[The New Republic]]'', 22 August 1988; ''[[The National Interest]]'', Spring 1990.</ref>

In 1985, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported:
{{quote|Three weeks ago, Americas Watch issued a report on human rights abuses in Nicaragua. One member of the Permanent Commission for Human Rights commented on the Americas Watch report and its chief investigator [[Juan E. Méndez|Juan Mendez]]: "The Sandinistas are laying the groundwork for a totalitarian society here and yet all Mendez wanted to hear about were abuses by the contras. How can we get people in the U.S. to see what's happening here when so many of the groups who come down are pro-Sandinista?"<ref>David Asman, "Despair and fear in Managua", ''[[Wall Street Journal]],'' 25 March 1985.</ref>}}

[[Human Rights Watch]], the umbrella organization of Americas Watch, replied to these allegations: "Almost invariably, U.S. pronouncements on human rights exaggerated and distorted the real human rights violations of the Sandinista regime, and exculpated those of the U.S.-supported insurgents, known as the contras...The Bush administration is responsible for these abuses, not only because the contras are, for all practical purposes, a U.S. force, but also because the Bush administration has continued to minimize and deny these violations, and has refused to investigate them seriously."<ref name="NICARAGUA"/>

U.S. conservative political scientist [[Rudolph Rummel]] estimated that by 1987, the contras had murdered about 500 people while the Sandinistas had murdered 4,000 to 7,000 people in [[democide]].<ref>[http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.TAB15.1E.GIF Power Kills] Hawaii.edu. Line 2558</ref> In contrast, [[Witness for Peace]] and the Sandinista government claimed at least 736 civilians were murdered by the contras between March 1987 and October 1988 alone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brianwillson.com/u-s-waged-low-intensity-warfare-in-nicaragua|title=ADDENDUM A: Casualties from Contra Attacks–Nicaragua|accessdate=20 December 2012}}</ref>

After a cutoff in U.S. military support and with both sides facing international pressure to bring an end to the conflict, the contras agreed to negotiations with the FSLN. With the help of five Central American Presidents, including Ortega, it was agreed that a voluntary demobilization of the contras should start in early December 1989, in order to facilitate free and fair elections in Nicaragua in February 1990 (even though the Reagan administration had pushed for a delay of contra disbandment).<ref>[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/73891981.html?dids=73891981:73891981&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Aug+09%2C+1989&author=John+M.+Goshko%3B+Ann+Devroy&pub=The+Washington+Post+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&desc=U.S.+Endorses+Contra+Plan+as+Prod+to+Democracy+in+Nicaragua&pqatl=google "U.S. Endorses Contra Plan as Prod to Democracy in Nicaragua"] The Washington Post, 9 August 1989</ref>

Possible explanations include that the Nicaraguan people were disenchanted with the Ortega regime as well as the fact that already in November 1989, the White House had announced that the economic embargo against Nicaragua would continue unless [[Violeta Chamorro]] won.<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1222025.html "Bush Vows to End Embargo if Chamorro Wins"], ''The Washington Post,'' 9 November 1989</ref> Also, there had been reports of intimidation from the side of the contras,<ref>"The policy of keeping the contras alive ... also has placed in jeopardy the holding of elections by encouraging contra attacks on the electoral process. Thus, while the Bush administration proclaims its support for human rights and free and fair elections in Nicaragua, it persists in sabotaging both."
