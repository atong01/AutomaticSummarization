Children of church members were attending college, only to reject the faith of their parents. Jones later recalled that in 1924, his friend<space/><link><target>William Jennings Bryan</target></link><space/>had leaned over to him at a Bible conference service in<space/><link><target>Winona Lake, Indiana</target></link>, and said, &quot;If schools and colleges do not quit teaching evolution as a fact, we are going to become a nation of atheists.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>Turner, 19</extension><space/>While he himself was not a college graduate, Jones grew determined to found a college, and on September 12, 1927, he opened Bob Jones College in<space/><link><target>Panama City, Florida</target><part>Panama City</part></link>, with 88 students.

However, Jones's move to Cleveland proved extraordinarily advantageous. Bankrupt at the nadir of the Depression, without a home, and with barely enough money to move its library and office furniture, the college became in thirteen years the largest liberal arts college in Tennessee.
