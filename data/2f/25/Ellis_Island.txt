[[File:Ellis-Island-map.svg|thumb|right|300px|Ellis Island's location in the [[Upper New York Bay]]]]
'''Ellis Island''' is an [[island]] that is located in [[Upper New York Bay]] in the [[Port of New York and New Jersey]], [[United States]]. It was the gateway for millions of [[immigrants]] to the [[United States]] as the nation's busiest immigrant inspection station from 1892 until 1954. The island was greatly expanded with [[land reclamation]] between 1892 and 1934. Before that, the much smaller original island was the site of Fort Gibson and later a [[Magazine (artillery)#Naval magazines|naval magazine]]. The island was made part of the [[Statue of Liberty National Monument]] in 1965, and has hosted a museum of immigration since 1990. Long considered part of [[New York]], a 1998 [[United States Supreme Court]] decision found that most of the island is in [[New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Joan|last=Biskupic|title=N.J.

==Geography and access==

Ellis Island is located in the [[Upper New York Bay]], east of [[Liberty State Park]] and north of [[Liberty Island]], in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] with a small section that is territory of [[New York City]] [[enclave]]d within it.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Hagstrom Map Company, Inc| isbn = 0-88097-763-9| title = Hudson County New Jersey Street Map| year = 2010}}</ref><ref name = ERIS>{{cite paper   | author= Richard G.

The entire island, much of which is closed to the general public, has been owned and administered by the U.S. [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] since 1808 and has been operated by the [[National Park Service]] since 1965.<ref>{{cite web    | title = Frequently asked questions   | work = Ellis Island Part of Statue of Liberty National Monument   | publisher = National Park Service   | url = http://www.nps.gov/elis/faqs.htm   | accessdate = 2013-11-18}}</ref>

Since [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], the island is guarded by patrols of the [[United States Park Police]] Marine Patrol Unit. Public access is by ferry from either [[Communipaw Terminal]] in Liberty State Park or from [[Battery Park]] at the southern tip of [[Manhattan]]. The ferry operator, [[Hornblower Cruises|Hornblower Cruises and Events]], also provides service to the nearby Statue of Liberty.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/stli/planyourvisit/ferry-system-map.htm NPS Ferry Map]</ref> A bridge built for transporting materials and personnel during restoration projects connects Ellis Island with Liberty State Park, but is not open to the public.

=={{Anchor|Ownership}}Ownership and sovereignty==
Originally much of the west shore of [[Upper New York Bay]] consisted of large tidal flats which hosted vast [[Oyster|oyster banks]], a major source of food for the [[Lenape]] population who lived in the area prior to the arrival of Dutch settlers. There were several islands which were not completely submerged at high tide, although most of them were submerged. Three of them (later to be known as [[Liberty Island|Liberty]], [[Black Tom explosion#Black Tom Island|Black Tom]] and Ellis) were given the name Oyster Islands by the settlers of [[New Netherland]], the first European colony in the [[Mid-Atlantic states]]. The oyster beds would remain a major source of food for nearly three centuries.<ref>{{Citation   | title = Appendix to Journal of the Sixteenth Senate of the State of New Jersey   | place = Belvidere, New Jersey   | publisher = John Simeron   | year = 1860   | url = http://books.google.nl/books?id=wm1MAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false   | quote = }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| last =  Kurlansky| first =  Mark| authorlink = Mark Kurlansky| title = [[The Big Oyster]]| publisher = Random House Trade paperbacks| year = 2006| location = New York| isbn = 978-0-345-47639-5}}</ref><ref>[http://events.nytimes.com/2006/03/01/books/01grim.html?fta=y ''The New York Times''], March 1, 2006, accessed March 16, 2008</ref> [[Land reclamation|Landfilling]] to build the railyards of the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]] and the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] would eventually obliterate the beds, engulf one island and bring the shoreline much closer to the others.<ref name="supreme.justia.com">[http://supreme.justia.com/us/209/473/case.html Central R.

The State of [[New York]] leased the island in 1794 and started to fortify it in 1795.

The circumstances which led to an [[exclave]] of New York being located within New Jersey began in the colonial era, after the British takeover of [[New Netherland]] in 1664. An unusual clause in the colonial land grant outlined the territory that the proprietors of [[New Jersey]] would receive as being "westward of Long Island, and Manhitas Island and bounded on the east part by the main sea, and part by Hudson's river",<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/17th_century/nj01.asp The Duke of York's Release to John Lord Berkeley, and Sir George Carteret, 24th of June, 1664]</ref> rather than at the river's midpoint, as was common in other colonial charters.<ref>{{Citation| last =  Rieff| first =  Henry| author-link = | title = Interpretations of New York-New Jersey Agreements 1834 and 1921 | journal = Newark Law Review| url =  http://njlegallib.rutgers.edu/journals/docs/journal.nwk.1.29.pdf| id = }}</ref>

Attempts were made as early as 1804 to resolve the status of the state line.<ref>{{Cite journal| title = Ellis Island Its Legal Status| publisher = General Services Administration Office of General Counsel| date = February 28, 1963| url =  http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/stli/ellis_island_legal.pdf| accessdate = 2010-09-25}}</ref> The [[City of New York]] claimed the right to regulate trade on all the waters.

The federal government, which had bought the island in 1808, began expanding the island by [[Land reclamation#Creating new land|landfill]], to accommodate the immigration station opened in 1892. Landfilling continued in stages until 1934.<ref>[http://dmna.state.ny.us/forts/fortsE_L/gibsonFort.htm State.ny.us]</ref>
 
Nine-tenths of the current area is [[artificial island]] that did not exist at the time of the interstate compact. New Jersey contended that the new extensions were part of New Jersey, since they were not part of the original island. In 1956, after the 1954 closing of the U.S. immigration station, the then [[Mayor of Jersey City]], [[Bernard J. Berry]], commandeered a U.S. Coast Guard cutter and led a contingent of New Jersey officials on an expedition to claim the island.<ref>{{Cite web   | last = Logan   | first = Andy | authorlink =  |author2=McCarten, John | title = Invasion from Jersey | work =  | publisher = The New Yorker | date = January 14, 1956   |url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1956/01/14/1956_01_14_019_TNY_CARDS_000252353 | format =  | doi = | accessdate = 2011-02-14}}</ref> In 1997, the state filed suit to establish its jurisdiction, leading New York City Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]] to remark dramatically that his father, an Italian who immigrated through Ellis Island, never intended to go to New Jersey.<ref>Sheahan, Matthew.

The dispute eventually reached the Supreme Court of the United States, which ruled in ''[[New Jersey v. New York]]''  {{scite|523|767|1998}}, that New Jersey had jurisdiction over all portions of the island created after the original compact was approved (effectively, more than 80% of the island's present land). This caused several immediate confusions: some buildings, for instance, fell into the territory of both states. New Jersey and New York soon agreed to share jurisdiction of the island. It remains wholly a federal property, however, and these legal decisions do not result in either state taking any fiscal or physical responsibility for the maintenance, preservation, or improvement of any of the historic properties.<ref name="nyt-1998-05-27"/><ref>[http://www.nps.gov/elis/planyourvisit/maps.htm National Park Service map showing portions of the island belonging to New York and New Jersey]</ref><ref>[http://supreme.justia.com/us/523/767/index.html NEW JERSEY v. NEW YORK 523 U.S. 767 page 779]</ref>

The ruling had no effect on the status of [[Liberty Island]], {{convert|4.17|acre|ha}} of which was created by [[land reclamation]].<ref name="state.nj.us">{{cite news   | title = HISTORIC FILL OF THE JERSEY CITY QUADRANGLE HISTORIC FILL MAP HFM-53   | newspaper = New State Department of Environmental Protection   | year = 2004   | url = http://www.state.nj.us/dep/njgs/geodata/historicfill/jersey.pdf   | accessdate = 2014-08-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite news   | title = Is Liberty a Jersey Girl   | publisher = New Jersey Society of Professional Land Surveyors   | date = February 4, 2014   | url = http://www.njspls.org/?130   | accessdate = }}</ref>

[[File:Ellis Island in 1905.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Second Ellis Island Immigration Station, opened on December 17, 1900, as seen in 1905]]

In the 35 years before Ellis Island opened, over eight million immigrants arriving in [[New York City]] had been processed by [[New York]] State officials at [[Castle Clinton|Castle Garden Immigration Depot]] in [[Lower Manhattan]], just across the bay.<ref name="National Park Service: Ellis Island"/> The federal government assumed control of immigration on April 18, 1890, and Congress appropriated $75,000 to construct America's first Federal immigration station on Ellis Island. Artesian wells were dug, and [[landfill]] was hauled in from incoming ships' [[Sailing ballast|ballast]] and from construction of New York City's [[Rapid transit|subway]] tunnels, which doubled the size of Ellis Island to over six acres. While the building was under construction, the Barge Office nearby at the [[Battery Park|Battery]] was used for immigrant processing.

The first federal immigrant inspection station was an enormous three-story-tall structure, with outbuildings, built of Georgia pine, containing all of the amenities that were thought to be necessary. It opened with celebration on January 1, 1892.<ref name="Ellis Island Foundation, 2000"/> Three large ships landed on the first day and 700 immigrants passed over the docks. Almost 450,000 immigrants were processed at the station during its first year. On June 15, 1897, a fire of unknown origin, possibly caused by faulty wiring, turned the wooden structures on Ellis Island into ashes. No loss of life was reported, but most of the immigration records dating back to 1855 were destroyed. About 1.5 million immigrants had been processed at the first building during its five years of use. Plans were immediately made to build a new, fireproof immigration station on Ellis Island. During the construction period, passenger arrivals were again processed at the Barge Office.<ref name="Ellis Island Foundation, 2000"/>

[[Edward Lippincott Tilton]] and [[William Boring|William A. Boring]] won the 1897 competition to design the first phase, including the Main Building (1897â€“1900), Kitchen and Laundry Building (1900â€“01), Main Powerhouse (1900â€“01), and the Main Hospital Building (1900â€“01).<ref>{{Citation | last = Mausolf | first =  Lisa B. | coauthors = Elizabeth Durfee Hengen | title = Edward Lippincott Tilton: A Monograph on His Architectural Practice | year = 2007 | url = http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/peabody/about/Tiltonmonograph.pdf | accessdate = 2011-09-28 | quote =}}</ref>

The present main structure was designed in French [[Renaissance Revival]] style and built of red brick with limestone trim. When it opened on December 17, 1900, officials estimated 5,000 immigrants per day would be processed. However, the facilities proved to be able to barely handle the flood of immigrants that arrived in the years just before World War I. Writer [[Louis Adamic]] came to America from [[Slovenia]] in southeastern Europe in 1913 and described the night he and many other immigrants slept on bunk beds in a huge hall. Lacking a warm blanket, the young man "shivered, sleepless, all night, listening to snores" and dreams "in perhaps a dozen different languages". The facility was so large that the dining room could seat 1,000 people.

After its opening, Ellis Island was expanded with landfill and additional structures were built. By the time it closed on November 12, 1954, twelve million immigrants had been processed by the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|U.S. Bureau of Immigration]].<ref name="National Park Service: Ellis Island"/> It is estimated that 10.5 million immigrants departed for points across the United States from the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal]], located just across a narrow strait.<ref name="Jersey City Past and Present">[http://www.njcu.edu/programs/jchistory/Pages/C_Pages/Central_Railroad_of_New_Jersey.html ''Jersey City Past and Present'']</ref><ref>[http://www.state.nj.us/dep/parksandforests/parks/liberty_state_park/liberty_crrnj.html NJ DEP LSP: Communipaw Terminal]</ref> Others would have used one of the other terminals along the [[North River (Hudson River)]] at that time.<ref>{{Cite book| last =  Cunningham| first =  John T.| authorlink = | title = Ellis Island: Immigrationâ€™s Shining Center| publisher = Arcadia Publishing| year = 2003| url =  http://books.google.com/books?id=OyL6JatN5KwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Island+of+Hope,+Island+of+Tears&source=gbs_book_similarbooks#v=onepage&q=Island%20of%20Hope%2C%20Island%20of%20Tears&f=false| isbn = 978-0-7385-2428-3}}</ref>

Between 1905 and 1914, an average of one million immigrants per year arrived in the US. Two-thirds of those individuals emigrated from eastern, southern and central Europe.<ref>Introduction to Immigration from 1905-1945: Immigration and Multiculturalism: Essential Primary Sources, 2006</ref> The peak year for immigration at Ellis Island was 1907, with 1,004,756 immigrants processed. The all-time daily high occurred on April 17, 1907, when 11,747 immigrants arrived.<ref name="Ellis Island Foundation, 2000"/> After the [[Immigration Act of 1924]] was passed, which greatly restricted immigration and allowed processing at overseas embassies, the only immigrants to pass through the station were those who had problems with their immigration paperwork, displaced persons, and war [[refugees]].<ref>''The Brown Quarterly'', [http://brownvboard.org/sites/default/files/BQ_Vol4No1.pdf Volume 4, No. 1 (Fall 2000): Ellis Island/Immigration Issue]</ref> Today, over 100 million Americansâ€”about one-third of the populationâ€”can trace their ancestry to the immigrants who first arrived in America at Ellis Island before dispersing to points all over the country.<ref>{{cite web | last =Keeling | first =  Drew |publisher=''Migration as a Travel Business'' |url= http://www.business-of-migration.com/immigrant-ancestors/how-many-today-have-ancestors-who-immigrated-during-1900-1914/ |title= How many people today have ancestors who moved from Europe to the United States during 1900-14? |accessdate=2014-12-12}}</ref>

Generally, those immigrants who were approved spent from two to five hours at Ellis Island. Arrivals were asked 29 questions including name, occupation, and the amount of money carried. It was important to the American government that the new arrivals could support themselves and have money to get started. The average the government wanted the immigrants to have was between 18 and 25 dollars. Those with visible health problems or diseases were sent home or held in the island's [[Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital|hospital facilities]] for long periods of time. More than three thousand would-be immigrants died on Ellis Island while being held in the hospital facilities.

After 1924, Ellis Island became primarily a detention and deportation processing station.<ref name="Ellis Island Foundation, 2000" /><ref>{{Citation   | last = Jaynes | first = Gregory  | author-link =  | last2 =  | first2 = | author2-link = | title = American Scene: From Ellis Island to LAX | newspaper = TIME  | pages =   | date = July 8, 1985  | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959576-4,00.html | accessdate = 2011-03-06 | quote = }}</ref>

During and immediately following World War II, Ellis Island was used to [[German American internment|intern German]] merchant mariners and "enemy aliens"â€”American civilians and immigrants detained for fear of spying, sabotage, and other [[fifth column]] activity. In December 1941, Ellis Island held 279 [[Internment of Japanese Americans|Japanese]], 248 Germans, and 81 [[Internment of Italian Americans|Italians]] removed from the East Coast.<ref>J. Burton, M. Farrell, F. Lord, R. Lord. ''Confinement and Ethnicity: An Overview of World War II Japanese American Relocation Sites'' [http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/anthropology74/ce17a.htm "Department of Justice and U.S. Army Facilities: Temporary Detention Stations"] (National Park Service)</ref> Unlike other wartime immigration detention stations, Ellis Island was designated as a permanent holding facility and was used to hold foreign nationals throughout the war.<ref>[http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Ellis%20Island%20%28detention%20facility%29/ "Ellis Island"] ''Densho Encyclopedia'' (accessed 11 June 2014)</ref> A total of 7,000 Germans, Italians and Japanese would be ultimately detained at Ellis Island.<ref name="Ellis Island Foundation, 2000"/>  It was also a processing center for returning sick or wounded U.S. soldiers, and a Coast Guard training base. Ellis Island still managed to process tens of thousands of immigrants a year during this time, but many fewer than the hundreds of thousands a year who arrived before the war. After the war, immigration rapidly returned to earlier levels.<ref name="Ellis Island Foundation, 2000" /> Noted entertainers who performed for detained aliens and for U.S. and allied servicemen at the island included [[Rudy Vallee]], [[Jimmy Durante]], [[Bob Hope]], and [[Lionel Hampton]] and his orchestra.

The [[Internal Security Act of 1950]] barred members of communist or fascist organizations from immigrating to the United States. Ellis Island saw detention peak at 1,500, but by 1952, after changes to immigration law and policies, only 30 detainees remained.<ref name="Ellis Island Foundation, 2000" />

One of the last detainees was the [[Aceh]] separatist [[Hasan di Tiro]] who, while a student in New York in 1953, declared himself the "foreign minister" of the rebellious [[Darul Islam (Indonesia)|Darul Islam]] movement.<ref name="Kopassus">{{cite book | last = Kenneth Conboy| authorlink = | title = Kopassus: Inside Indonesia's Special Forces|edition= November 16, 2002| publisher = Equinox Publishing| isbn= 979-95898-8-6|page= 352}}</ref> Due to this action, he was immediately stripped of his Indonesian citizenship, causing him to be imprisoned for a few months on Ellis Island as "an illegal alien."<ref name="Kopassus"/>

A myth persists that government officials on Ellis Island compelled immigrants to take new names against their wishes.<ref>[http://www.ancestry.com/learn/library/article.aspx?article=4675 Name Changes at Ellis Island: Fact or Fiction?]", Ancestry.com. Retrieved 2010-09-29.</ref> In fact, no historical records bear this out. Federal immigration inspectors were under strict supervision and were more interested in preventing inadmissible aliens from entering the country (for which they were held accountable) than in assisting them in trivial personal matters such as altering their names. The inspectors used the passenger lists given to them by the [[steamship]] companies to process each foreigner. These were the sole immigration records for entering the country and were prepared not by the U.S. Bureau of Immigration but by steamship companies such as the [[Cunard Line]], the [[White Star Line]], the [[Norddeutscher Lloyd|North German Lloyd Line]], the [[Hamburg-Amerika Line]], the Italian Steam Navigation Company, the [[Red Star Line]], the [[Holland America Line]], and the [[Austro-American Line]].<ref>[http://www.ellisisland.org/ Ellis Island Foundation list of steamships]</ref><ref>[http://149.101.23.2/graphics/aboutus/history/articles/nameessay.html US Dept of Justice] American Names / Declaring Independence, Marian L.

==== Medical inspections ====
[[File:Ellis Island dormitory room.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Dormitory room for detained immigrants]]

To support the activities of the United States Bureau of Immigration, the [[United States Public Health Service]] operated an extensive medical service at the immigrant station, called U.S. Marine Hospital Number 43, more widely known as the [[Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital]]. It was the largest marine hospital in the nation. The medical division, which was active both in the hospital and the Great Hall, was staffed by uniformed military surgeons. They are best known for the role they played during the line inspection, in which they employed unusual techniques such as the use of the [[wikt:buttonhook|buttonhook]] to examine aliens for signs of eye diseases (particularly, [[trachoma]]) and the use of a chalk mark code. Symbols were [[chalk]]ed on the clothing of potentially sick immigrants following the six-second medical examination. The doctors would look at the immigrants as they climbed the stairs from the baggage area to the Great Hall. Immigrants' behavior would be studied for difficulties in getting up the staircase. Some immigrants supposedly entered the country only by surreptitiously wiping the chalk marks off, or by turning their clothes inside out.<ref>{{cite book| title=Ellis Island:

After the immigration station closed in November 1954, the buildings fell into disrepair and were all but abandoned. Attempts at redeveloping the site were unsuccessful until its landmark status was established. On October 15, 1965, Ellis Island was proclaimed a part of [[Statue of Liberty National Monument]]. It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on October 15, 1966.

[[Boston]]-based architecture firm [[Finegold Alexander + Associates Inc]], together with the New York architectural firm [[Beyer Blinder Belle]], designed the restoration and adaptive use of the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] Main Building, one of the most symbolically important structures in American history. A construction budget of $150 million was required for this significant restoration. This money was raised by a campaign organized by the political fundraiser [[Wyatt A.

On May 20, 2015 the Ellis Island Immigration Museum was officially renamed the Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration and coincided with the opening of the new Peopling of America galleries. The expansion tells the entire story of American immigration including before and after the Ellis Island era. The Peopling of America Center was designed by ESI Design and fabricated by Hadley Exhibits, Inc. The architectural design was done by Highland Associates, with construction executed by Phelps Construction Group.<ref>[http://www.libertyellisfoundation.org/peopling-of-america-center Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation website]</ref>

The Wall of Honor outside of the main building contains a partial list of immigrants processed on the island.<ref>[http://www.wallofhonor.org/ Wall of Honor website]</ref> Inclusion on the list is made possible by a donation to support the facility. In 2008 the museum's library was officially named the Bob Hope Memorial Library in honor of one the station's most famous immigrants.

The [[Ellis Island Medal of Honor]] is awarded annually at ceremonies on the island.

== Emergency services ==
Emergency services on Ellis Island are provided by the following emergency divisions of the National Park Service:
* '''Police services''' and security are provided for the island by the [[United States Park Police]].
* '''Fire suppression''' is provided by the National Park Services Division of Safety and Emergency Managements [[Statue of Liberty Fire Brigade]] which consists of a crew of federal NPS firefighters who are trained and certified as Structural Firefighter I, Structural Firefighter II and/or Wildland Firefighters. The crew also provides fire suppression response to nearby Liberty Island.{{paragraph}} Since the nearest other National Park Service Fire Brigade is located in [[Sandy Hook, New Jersey]], the Statue of Liberty Fire Brigade maintains a mutual aid agreement with the Jersey City Fire Department for mutual aid assistance on Ellis Island should it be required.
* '''Emergency medical services''' are provided by National Park Services Division of Safety and Emergency management which consists of a team of full-time NPS Emergency Medical Technicians and Certified First Responders. Patient transports are coordinated with Jersey City Medical Center Ambulances but emergency response and patient care falls upon the National Park Service Emergency Medical Technicians.

== In popular culture ==
Ellis Island has been a source of inspiration or subject in popular culture.

Early films, including those from the silent era, which feature the station include ''[[Traffic in Souls]]'' (1913), "How The Jews Care for Their Poor" (educational film, 1914) ''The Yellow Passport'' (1916), ''My Boy'' (1921), [[Frank Capra]]'s ''The Strong Man'' (1926), ''We Americans'' (1928), ''The Mating Call'' (1928),  ''Paddy O'Day'' (1935), ''Ellis Island'' (1936), ''Gateway'' (1938), ''Exile Express'' (1939), ''I, Jane Doe'' (1948), and ''Gambling House'' (1951). In ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', [[Vito Corleone|Don Corleone]] immigrates via Ellis Island as a boy. The opening scene of ''[[The Brother From Another Planet]]'' is set there. The island is visited by the characters in the 2005 romantic comedy, ''[[Hitch (film)|Hitch]]'', and is the setting for the climactic battle in ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]''.

Some films have focused on the immigrant experience, such as the 1984 TV miniseries ''[[Ellis Island (TV miniseries)|Ellis Island]]''. The IMAX 3D movie [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112286/ ''Across the Sea of Time''] incorporates both modern footage and historical photographs of Ellis Island. The 2006 Italian movie ''[[Nuovomondo|The Golden Door]]'', directed by [[Emanuele Crialese]], takes place largely on Ellis Island. ''[[Forgotten Ellis Island (film)|Forgotten Ellis Island]]'', a film and book, focuses on the [[Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital]].<ref>[[Lorie Conway|Conway, Lorie]], [http://books.google.com/books?id=7dK7cIsVfmEC&printsec=frontcover ''Forgotten Ellis Island : the extraordinary story of Americaâ€™s immigrant hospital''], New York : Smithsonian Books : Collins, 2007.

Ellis Island as a port of entry is described in detail in ''[[Mottel the Cantor's Son]]'' by [[Sholom Aleichem]].

''[[Ellis Island: The Dream of America]]'' is a work for actors and orchestra with projected images by [[Peter Boyer]], composed in 2001-02. The song "The New Ground - Isle of Hope, Isle of Tears", on the 2010 album ''[[Celtic Woman: Songs from the Heart|Songs from the Heart]]'' by the group [[Celtic Woman]], is about Annie Moore and Ellis Island.

The [[USPS]] issued a 32Â¢ stamp on February 3, 1998 as part of the [[Celebrate the Century]] stamp sheet series.

The island is also accessible in the [[Spider-Man 2 (video game)|Spider-Man 2]] video game for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox]] by attaching to passing by helicopters.
