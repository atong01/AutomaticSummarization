For Amstrad, the latter was easier to realize. At the deliberately low-key introduction of the CPC664 in May 1985, the machine was positioned not only as the lowest-cost disk system but even the lowest-cost CP/M 2.2 machine. In the Amstrad CPC product range the CPC664 complemented the CPC464 which was neither discontinued nor reduced in price.<extension extension_name='ref'>The CPC664,<space/><italics>Amstrad Computer User</italics><space/>May 1985, P. 42-46.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Compared to the CPC464, the CPC664's main unit has been significantly redesigned, not only to accommodate the floppy disk drive but also with a redesigned keyboard area. Touted &quot;ergonomic&quot; by Amstrad's promotional material, the keyboard is noticeably tilted to the front with<space/><link><target>MSX</target></link>-style cursor keys above the numeric keypad. Compared to the CPC464's multicoloured keyboard, the CPC664's keys are kept in a much quieter grey and pale blue colour scheme.</paragraph><paragraph>The back of the CPC664 main unit features the same connectors as the CPC464, with the exception of an additional 12V power lead. Unlike the CPC464's cassette tape drive that could be powered off the main unit's 5V voltage, the CPC664's floppy disk drive requires an additional 12V voltage. This voltage had to be separately supplied by an updated version of the bundled green screen/colour monitor (GT-65 and CTM-644 respectively).</paragraph><paragraph>The CPC664 was only produced for approximately six months. In late 1985, when the CPC6128 was introduced in Europe, Amstrad decided not to keep three models in the line-up, and production of the CPC664 was discontinued.<extension extension_name='ref' name="InterviewPerry"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="title">Interview with Roland Perry (in French language)</arg><arg name="publisher">Amstrad Forever</arg><arg name="url">http://amstrad.cpc.free.fr/article.php?sid</arg><arg name="accessdate">2 April 2010</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='4'>CPC6128</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Amstrad CPC6128, keyboard removed.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>A look inside the CPC6128.

Aside from various hardware and firmware improvements, one of the CPC6128's most prominent features is the compatibility with the CP/M+ operating system that rendered it attractive for business uses.</paragraph><paragraph>The CPC6128 was released in August 1985 and initially only sold in the USA. Imported and distributed by Indescomp, Inc. of Chicago, it was the first Amstrad product to be sold in the United States, a market that at the time was traditionally hostile towards European computer manufacturers.<extension extension_name='ref'><italics>Amstrad Computer User</italics>, &quot;User News...&quot;, August 1985, p. 7.</extension><space/>By the end of 1985, it arrived in Europe and replaced the CPC664 in the CPC model line-up.

The main goals were numerous enhancements to the existing CPC hardware platform, to restyle the casework to provide a contemporary appearance, and to add native support of cartridge media. The new model palette includes three variants, the<space/><italics>464plus</italics><space/>and<space/><italics>6128plus</italics><space/>computers and the<space/><italics>GX4000</italics><space/>video game console. The &quot;CPC&quot; abbreviation was dropped from the model names.</paragraph><paragraph>The redesign significantly enhanced the CPC hardware, mainly to rectify its previous shortcomings as a gaming platform. The redesigned video hardware allows for hardware sprites and soft scrolling, with a colour palette extended from a maximum of 16&amp;nbsp;colours (plus separately definable border) at one time from a choice of 27, increased to a maximum of 32 out of 4096. The enhanced sound hardware offers automatic DMA transfer, allowing more complex sound effects with a significantly reduced processor overhead. Other hardware enhancements include the support of analogue joysticks, 8-bit printers, and ROM cartridges up to 4<space/><link><target>megabit</target><part>Mbit</part><trail>s</trail></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>The new range of models was intended to be completely backward compatible with the original CPC models.

Based on the redesigned plus hardware platform, they share the same base characteristics as their predecessors: The 464plus is equipped with 64&amp;nbsp;KB RAM and a cassette tape drive, the 6128plus features 128&amp;nbsp;KB RAM and a 3&quot; floppy disk drive. Both models share a common case layout with a keyboard taken over from the CPC6128 model, and the respective mass storage drive inserted in a case breakout.</paragraph><paragraph>In order to simplify the<space/><link><target>Electromagnetic compatibility</target><part>EMC</part></link><space/>screening process, the edge connectors of the previous models have been replaced with micro-ribbon connectors as previously used on the German Schneider CPC6128. As a result, a wide range of extensions for the original CPC range is connector-incompatible with the 464plus and 6128plus. In addition, the 6128plus does not have a tape socket for an external tape drive.</paragraph><paragraph>The plus range is not equipped with an on-board ROM, and thus the 464plus and the 6128plus do not contain a firmware. Instead, Amstrad provided the firmware for both models via the ROM extension facility, contained on the included<space/><italics>Burnin' Rubber and Locomotive BASIC</italics><space/>cartridge. This resulted in reduced hardware localization cost (only some select key caps and case labels had to be localized) with the added benefit of a rudimentary copy protection mechanism (without a firmware present, the machine itself could not copy a game cartridge's content).<extension extension_name='ref' name="ArnoldVSpec"></extension><space/>As the enhanced<space/><italics>V4</italics><space/>firmware's structural differences causes problems with some CPC software directly calling firmware functions by their memory addresses, Amstrad separately sold a cartridge containing the original CPC6128's<space/><italics>V3</italics><space/>firmware.<extension extension_name='ref' name="GrimwareCartridges"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="title">Amstrad System Cartridges</arg><arg name="publisher">grimware.org</arg><arg name="url">http://www.grimware.org/doku.php/documentations/hardware/amstrad.cartridge.released</arg><arg name="accessdate">22 March 2010</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Both the 464plus and the 6128plus were introduced to the public in September 1990.

Its main difference is a small additional daughter board containing a CPC664 ROM chip, and an 8&amp;nbsp;KB memory chip which is not electrically connected to the machine, and consequently not available to the CPU. Its sole purpose was supposedly to increase the machine's total memory specs to 72&amp;nbsp;KB in order to circumvent the import tax.

The Amstrad firmware is deliberately designed so that new software could be easily accessed from these ROMs with a minimum of fuss. Popular applications were marketed on ROM, particularly word processing and programming utility software (examples are Protext and Brunword of the former, and the MAXAM assembler of the latter type).</paragraph><paragraph>Such extra ROM chips do not plug directly into the CPC itself, but into extra plug-in &quot;rom boxes&quot; which contain sockets for the ROM chips and a minimal amount of decoding circuitry for the main machine to be able to switch between them. These boxes were either marketed commercially or could be built by competent hobbyists and they attached to the main expansion port at the back of the machine. Software on ROM loads much faster than from disc or tape and the machine's boot-up sequence was designed to evaluate ROMs it found and optionally hand over control of the machine to them. This allows significant customization of the functionality of the machine, something that enthusiasts exploited for various purposes.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Amstrad CPC ROM expansion"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="title">Amstrad CPC ROM expansion<space/></arg><arg name="url">http://8bit.yarek.pl/hardware/cpc.rom/index.html<space/></arg></template></extension><space/>However, the typical users would probably not be aware of this added ROM functionality unless they read the CPC press, as it is not described in the user manual and was hardly ever mentioned in marketing literature.
