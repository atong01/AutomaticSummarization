Anthony is notable for having decided to surpass this tradition and headed out into the desert proper. He left for the alkaline<space/><link><target>Nitrian Desert</target></link><space/>(later the location of the noted monasteries of<space/><link><target>Nitria (monastic site)</target><part>Nitria</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Kellia</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Scetis</target></link>) on the edge of the<space/><link><target>Libyan Desert</target><part>Western Desert</part></link><space/>about<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>95</arg><arg>km</arg><arg>0</arg><arg name="abbr">on</arg><arg name="sp">us</arg></template><space/>west of<space/><link><target>Early centers of Christianity#Alexandria</target><part>Alexandria</part></link>. He remained there for 13 years.<extension extension_name='ref' name="ButlerLives1991"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>According to<space/><link><target>Athanasius</target></link>, the devil fought Anthony by afflicting him with boredom, laziness, and the phantoms of women, which he overcame by the power of prayer, providing a theme for<space/><link><target>Christian art</target></link>. After that, he moved to a tomb, where he resided and closed the door on himself, depending on some local villagers who brought him food. When the devil perceived his ascetic life and his intense worship, he was envious and beat him mercilessly, leaving him unconscious. When his friends from the local village came to visit him and found him in this condition, they carried him to a church.</paragraph><paragraph>After he recovered, he made a second effort and went back into the desert to a farther mountain by the<space/><link><target>Nile</target></link><space/>called Pispir (now Der-el-Memun), opposite<space/><link><target>Faiyum</target><part>Arsinoe</part></link>. There he lived strictly enclosed in an old abandoned<space/><link><target>Ancient Rome</target><part>Roman</part></link><space/>fort for some 20 years.<extension extension_name='ref' name="ButlerLives1991"></extension><space/>According to<space/><link><target>Athanasius</target></link>, the devil again resumed his war against Anthony, only this time the phantoms were in the form of wild beasts, wolves, lions, snakes, and scorpions. They appeared as if they were about to attack him or cut him into pieces. But the saint would laugh at them scornfully and say, &quot;If any of you have any authority over me, only one would have been sufficient to fight me.&quot; At his saying this, they disappeared as though in smoke. While in the fort he only communicated with the outside world by a crevice through which food would be passed and he would say a few words. Anthony would prepare a quantity of bread that would sustain him for six months. He did not allow anyone to enter his cell; whoever came to him stood outside and listened to his advice.</paragraph><paragraph>Then one day he emerged from the fort with the help of villagers, who broke down the door. By this time most had expected him to have wasted away or to have gone insane in his solitary confinement. Instead, he emerged healthy, serene, and enlightened. Everyone was amazed that he had been through these trials and emerged spiritually rejuvenated. He was hailed as a hero and from this time forth the legend of Anthony began to spread and grow. Anthony went to<space/><link><target>Al Fayyum</target><part>Fayyum</part></link><space/>and confirmed the brethren there in the<space/><link><target>Christian</target></link><space/>faith before returning to his fort.</paragraph><paragraph>Amid the<space/><link><target>Diocletian Persecutions</target></link>, Anthony wished to become a<space/><link><target>martyr</target></link><space/>and in 311 went to<space/><link><target>Alexandria</target></link>. He visited those who were imprisoned for the sake of<space/><link><target>Christ</target></link><space/>and comforted them. When the Governor saw that he was confessing his<space/><link><target>Christianity</target></link><space/>publicly, not caring what might happen to him, he ordered him not to show up in the city. However, the Saint did not heed his threats. He faced him and argued with him in order that he might arouse his anger so that he might be tortured and martyred, but it did not happen.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Father of Monks</heading><paragraph><link><target>Image:Antoniusaltaar.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part></part><part>250px</part><part>The former main altar of the hermitage church in<space/><link><target>Warfhuizen</target></link><space/>in the<space/><link><target>Netherlands</target></link><space/>with a mural of Anthony the Abbot and a<space/><link><target>reliquary</target></link><space/>with some of his<space/><link><target>relic</target><trail>s</trail></link>.

By this time, many more had heard of his sanctity and he had many more visitors than before.

These statements were later collected into the book of<space/><italics><link><target>Sayings of the Desert Fathers</target></link></italics>.

The Emperor wrote to him offering praise and requesting prayers. The brethren were pleased with the Emperor's letter, but Anthony did not pay any attention to it, and he said to them, &quot;The books of God, the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords, commands us every day, but we do not heed what they tell us, and we turn our backs on them.&quot; Under the persistence of the brethren who told him &quot;Emperor Constantine loves the church&quot;, he accepted to write him a letter blessing him, and praying for the peace and safety of the empire and the church.</paragraph><paragraph>According to Athanasius, Saint Anthony heard a voice telling him &quot;Go out and see.&quot; He went out and saw an<space/><link><target>angel</target></link><space/>who wore a girdle with a cross, one resembling the holy Eskiem (<link><target>Tonsure</target></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>Schema (Orthodoxy)</target><part>Schema</part></link>), and on his head was a head cover (Kolansowa). He was sitting while braiding palm leaves, then he stood up to pray, and again he sat to weave. A voice came to him saying, &quot;Anthony, do this and you will rest.&quot; Henceforth, he started to wear this tunic that he saw, and began to weave palm leaves, and never was bored again. Saint Anthony prophesied about the persecution that was about to happen to the church and the control of the heretics over it, the church victory and its return to its former glory, and the end of the age. When<space/><link><target>Macarius the Great</target><part>Saint Macarius</part></link><space/>visited Saint Anthony, Saint Anthony clothed him with the monk's garb, and foretold him what would be of him.

He pondered for a moment as to why a plate of silver coins would be out in the desert where no one else travels, and realised the Devil must have laid it out there to tempt him. To that he said, &quot;Ha! Devil, thou weenest to tempt me and deceive me, but it shall not be in thy power.&quot; Once he said this, the plate of silver vanished.</paragraph><paragraph>Saint Anthony continued walking along and saw a pile of gold in his way which the Devil had laid there to deceive him. Saint Anthony cast the pile of gold into a fire, and it vanished just like the silver coins did. After these events, Saint Anthony had a vision where the whole world was full of snares and traps. He cried to the Lord, &quot;Oh good Lord, who may escape from these snares?&quot; A voice replied, &quot;Humility shall escape them without more.&quot;</paragraph><heading level='3'>Demons in the cave</heading><paragraph>Once, Saint Anthony tried hiding in a cave to escape the demons that plagued him. There were so many little demons in the cave though that Saint Anthony's servant had to carry him out because they had beaten him to death. When the hermits were gathered to Saint Anthony's corpse to mourn his death, Saint Anthony was revived. He demanded that his servants take him back to that cave where the demons had beaten him. When he got there he called out to the demons, and they came back as wild beasts to rip him to shreds. All of a sudden a bright light flashed, and the demons ran away. Saint Anthony knew that the light must have come from God, and he asked God where was he before when the demons attacked him.
