Carmel Hill belongs to the mountain range of<space/><link><target>Collserola</target></link><space/>the<space/><link><target>Parc del Carmel</target></link><space/>is located on the northern face. Park Gell is located in<space/><link><target>La Salut</target></link>, a neighborhood in the<space/><link><target>Grcia district</target></link><space/>of Barcelona. With urbanization in mind,<space/><link><target>Eusebi Gell</target></link><space/>assigned the design of the park to<space/><link><target>Antoni Gaud</target></link>, a renowned architect and the face of<space/><link><target>Catalan modernism</target></link>. The park was built between 1900 and 1914 and was officially opened as a public park in 1926. In 1984,<space/><link><target>UNESCO</target></link><space/>declared the park a<space/><link><target>World Heritage Site</target></link><space/>under<space/><link><target>Works of Antoni Gaud</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="gaudiunesco"><template><target>Citation</target><arg name="title">Works of Antoni Gaudí<space/></arg><arg name="publisher"><space/>Unesco</arg><arg name="url"><space/>http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/320<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate"><space/>15 July 2011</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph><bold>Park Gell</bold><space/>is the reflection of Gauds artistic plenitude, which belongs to his<space/><link><target>naturalist</target></link><space/>phase (first decade of the 20th century). During this period, the architect perfected his personal style through inspiration from organic shapes. He put into practice a series of new structural solutions rooted in the analysis of geometry. To that, the Catalan artist adds creative liberty and an imaginative, ornamental creation. Starting from a sort of baroquism, his works acquire a structural richness of forms and volumes, free of the rational rigidity or any sort of classic premisses. In the design of<space/><bold>Park Gell</bold>, Gaud unleashed all his architectonic genius and put to practice much of his innovative structural solutions that would become the symbol of his organic style and that would culminate in the creation of the<space/><link><target>Basilica and Expiatory Church of the Holy Family</target></link><space/>(Catalan:<space/><link><target>Sagrada Familia</target></link>).</paragraph><paragraph>Gell and Gaud conceived this park, situated within a natural park. They imagined an organized grouping of high-quality homes, decked out with all the latest technological advancements to ensure maximum comfort, finished off with an artistic touch. They also envisioned a community strongly influenced by<space/><link><target>symbolism (arts)</target><part>symbolism</part></link>, since, in the common elements of the park, they were trying to synthesize many of the political and religious ideals shared by patron and architect: therefore there are noticeable concepts originating from political<space/><link><target>Catalanism</target></link><space/>- especially in the entrance stairway where the<space/><link><target>Catalonian countries</target></link><space/>are represented - and from<space/><link><target>Catholicism</target></link><space/>- the<space/><link><target>Monumento al Calvario</target></link>, originally designed to be a<space/><link><target>chapel</target></link>. The<space/><link><target>mythological</target></link><space/>elements are so important: apparently Gell and Gaud's conception of the park was also inspired by the<space/><link><target>Temple of Apollo (Delphi)</target><part>Temple of Apollo</part></link><space/>of<space/><link><target>Delphi</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>On the other hand, many experts have tried to link the park to various symbols because of the complex<space/><link><target>iconography</target></link><space/>that Gaud applied to the urban project. Such references go from political vindication to<space/><link><target>religious</target></link><space/>exaltation, passing through<space/><link><target>mythology</target></link>,<space/><link><target>history</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>philosophy</target></link>. Specifically, many studies claim to see references to<space/><link><target>Freemasonry</target></link>, despite the deep religious beliefs of both Gaud and<space/><link><target>Count Gell</target></link>. These references have not been proven in the<space/><link><target>historiography</target></link><space/>of the modern architect. The multiplicity of symbols found in the<space/><bold>Park Gell</bold><space/>is, as previously mentioned, associated to political and religious signs, with a touch of mystery according to the preferences of that time for<space/><link><target>enigmas</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>puzzles</target></link>.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Origins as a housing development</heading><paragraph>The park was originally part of a commercially unsuccessful housing site, the idea of Count<space/><link><target>Eusebi Gell</target></link>, after whom the park was named. It was inspired by the English<space/><link><target>garden city movement</target></link>; hence the original English name<space/><italics>Park</italics><space/>(in<space/><link><target>Catalan language</target><part>Catalan</part></link><space/>the name is &quot;Parc Gell&quot;). The site was a rocky hill with little vegetation and few trees, called<space/><italics>Muntanya Pelada</italics><space/>(Bare Mountain). It already included a large country house called Larrard House or Muntaner de Dalt House, and was next to a neighborhood of upper class houses called<space/><italics>La Salut</italics><space/>(The Health). The intention was to exploit the fresh air (well away from smoky factories) and beautiful views from the site, with sixty triangular lots being provided for luxury houses. Count Eusebi Gell added to the prestige of the development by moving in 1906 to live in Larrard House. Ultimately, only two houses were built, neither designed by Gaud. One was intended to be a show house, but on being completed in 1904 was put up for sale, and as no buyers came forward, Gaud, at Gell's suggestion, bought it with his savings and moved in with his family and his father in 1906.<extension extension_name='ref' name="zim"><template><target>Citation</target><arg name="last"><space/>Zimmermann<space/></arg><arg name="first"><space/>Robert<space/></arg><arg name="year">2002<space/></arg><arg name="title">The Best of Gaudí<space/></arg><arg name="place"><space/></arg><arg name="publisher"><space/></arg><arg name="url">http://www.sola-sole.com/bgaudi.pdf</arg><arg name="archive-url">https://web.archive.org/web/20070702205603/http://www.sola-sole.com/bgaudi.pdf</arg><arg name="archive-date">22 July 2007</arg></template></extension><space/>This house, where Gaud lived from 1906 to 1926, was built by Francesc Berenguer in 1904. It contains original works by Gaud and several of his collaborators. It is now the<space/><link><target>Gaudi House Museum</target></link><space/>(Casa Museu Gaud) since 1963. In 1969 it was declared a historical artistic monument of national interest.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Municipal garden</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Barcelona 193.JPG</target><part>thumb</part><part>upright</part><part>The<space/><link><target>Gaudi House Museum</target></link></part></link><link><target>File:Parc Gell Dragon Restored.jpg</target><part>left</part><part>thumb</part><part>Gaud's multicolored mosaic salamander, popularly known as &quot;el drac&quot; (the dragon), at the main entrance, as restored after the vandalism of February 2007</part></link><link><target>File:Park Guell Terrace.JPG</target><part>left</part><part>thumb</part><part>Gaud's mosaic work on the main terrace</part></link>It has since been converted into a municipal garden. It can be reached by underground railway (although the stations are at a distance from the Park and at a much lower level below the hill), by city buses, or by commercial tourist buses. From October 2013 the entrance to the Park is free but there is an entrance fee to visit the monumental zone (main entrance and the parts containing mosaics). Gaud's house, &quot;la Torre Rosa,&quot; containing furniture that he designed can be only visited for another entrance fee. There is a reduced rate for those wishing to see both Gaud's house and the<space/><link><target>Sagrada Famlia</target></link><space/>Church.</paragraph><paragraph>Park Gell is skillfully designed and composed to bring the peace and calm that one would expect from a park. The buildings flanking the entrance, though very original and remarkable with fantastically shaped roofs with unusual pinnacles, fit in well with the use of the park as pleasure gardens and seem relatively inconspicuous in the landscape when one considers the flamboyance of other buildings designed by Gaud. One of these buildings houses a permanent exhibition of the<space/><link><target>Barcelona City History Museum</target></link><space/>MUHBA focused on the building itself, the park and the city.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="title">MUHBA Park Güell</arg><arg name="url">http://museuhistoria.bcn.cat/en/node/654</arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXEGigoEa5k'>Virtual tour of MUHBA Park Gell</link></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The focal point of the park is the main terrace, surrounded by a long bench in the form of a<space/><link><target>sea serpent</target></link>. The curves of the serpent bench form a number of enclaves, creating a more social atmosphere. Gaud incorporated many motifs of<space/><link><target>Catalonia</target><part>Catalan</part></link><space/>nationalism, and elements from religious mysticism and ancient poetry, into the Park.</paragraph><paragraph>Roadways around the park to service the intended houses were designed by Gaud as structures jutting out from the steep hillside or running on viaducts, with separate footpaths in arcades formed under these structures. This minimized the intrusion of the roads, and Gaud designed them using local stone in a way that integrates them closely into the landscape. His structures echo natural forms, with columns like tree trunks supporting branching<space/><link><target>vault (architecture)</target><part>vaulting</part></link><space/>under the roadway, and the curves of vaulting and alignment of sloping columns designed in a similar way to his<space/><link><target>Church of Colnia Gell</target></link><space/>so that the<space/><link><target>Inverted catenary</target><part>inverted catenary arch</part></link><space/>shapes form perfect compression structures.<extension extension_name='ref' name="works">http://me-wserver.mecheng.strath.ac.uk/group2003/groupl/Inspirational%20people/Antoni%20Gaudi_files/Antoni%20Gaudi.htm</extension></paragraph><paragraph>The large cross at the Park's high-point offers the most complete view of Barcelona and the bay.
