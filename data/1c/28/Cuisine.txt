A '''cuisine''' ({{IPAc-en|k|w|ɪ|ˈ|z|i:|n}} {{respell|kwi|ZEEN|'}}; from [[French language|French]] {{IPA-fr|kɥizin|}}, in turn from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''coquere'' = "to cook") is a style of [[cooking]] characterized by distinctive [[ingredient]]s, [[List of cooking techniques|techniques]] and [[dish (food)|dishes]], and usually associated with a specific [[culture]] or geographic region.<ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/cuisine "Cuisine."] [http://www.thefreedictionary.com Thefreedictionary.com].

==Factors that affect a cuisine==
Some of the elements that have an influence on a region's cuisine include the area's [[climate]], which in large measure determines the native foods that are available, the [[economy|economic]] conditions, which affect [[trade]] and can affect food distribution, imports and exports, and [[Religious law|religiousness]] or [[sumptuary]] laws, under which certain foods and food preparations are required or proscribed.

[[Climate]] also affects the supply of fuel for cooking; a common Chinese food preparation method was cutting food into small pieces to cook foods quickly and conserve scarce firewood and charcoal. Foods preserved for winter consumption by [[Smoking (cooking)|smoking]], [[Curing (food preservation)|curing]], and [[pickling]] have remained significant in [[List of cuisines|world cuisines]] for their altered gustatory properties even when these preserving techniques are no longer strictly necessary to the maintenance of an adequate food supply.

==History==
{{further|List of historical cuisines}}
Cuisine dates back to the [[Ancient history|Antiquity]]. [[Rome]] was known for its cuisine, wealthy families would dine in the [[Triclinium]] on a variety of dishes, their diet consisted of eggs, cheese, bread, meat and honey.

==New cuisines==

Cuisines evolve continually, and new cuisines are created by innovation and cultural interaction. One recent example is [[fusion cuisine]], which combines elements of various [[Culinary art|culinary]] traditions while not being categorized per any one cuisine style, and generally refers to the innovations in many contemporary restaurant cuisines since the 1970s.<ref name="NYT">{{cite news | first=Robert | last= Lindsey| url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E0DD1F38F93BA2575BC0A963948260&sec=travel&pagewanted=print | title= California Grows Her Own Cuisine. | newspaper=[[New York Times]] | date= 18 August 1985 }}</ref> ''[[Nouvelle cuisine]]'' (New cuisine) is an approach to cooking and food presentation in [[French cuisine]] that was popularized in the 1960s by the food critics [[Henri Gault]], who invented the phrase, and his colleagues [[André Gayot]] and [[Christian Millau]] in a new restaurant guide, the [[Gault-Millau]], or ''Le Nouveau Guide''.

==Global cuisine==
{{main|Global cuisine|Regional cuisine|List of cuisines}}

A [[global cuisine]] is a cuisine that is practiced around the world, and can be categorized according to the common use of major foodstuffs, including [[grain]]s, [[produce]] and cooking [[fat]]s.

==Regional cuisines==
[[Regional cuisine]]s may vary based upon food availability and trade, cooking traditions and practices, and [[culture|cultural]] differences.<ref name="cuisine"/> For example, in Central and South America, corn ([[maize]]), both fresh and dried, is a [[staple food]]. In northern Europe, [[wheat]], [[rye]], and fats of animal origin predominate, while in southern Europe [[olive oil]] is ubiquitous and [[rice]] is more prevalent. In Italy the cuisine of the north, featuring [[butter]] and rice, stands in contrast to that of the south, with its wheat [[pasta]] and olive oil. China likewise can be divided into rice regions and [[noodle]] & [[bread]] regions. Throughout the Middle East and Mediterranean there is a common thread marking the use of [[lamb and mutton|lamb]], olive oil, [[lemon]]s, [[chili pepper|peppers]], and rice. The [[vegetarianism]] practiced in much of India has made [[Pulse (legume)|pulses]] (crops harvested solely for the dry seed) such as [[chickpea]]s and [[lentil]]s as significant as wheat or rice. From India to Indonesia the use of [[spice]]s is characteristic; [[coconut]]s and [[seafood]] are used throughout the region both as foodstuffs and as [[seasoning]]s.

===African cuisine===
[[File:LocationAfrica.png|right|215px]]
{{Main|List of African cuisines}}

[[African cuisine]]s use a combination of locally available [[fruit]]s, [[cereal grain]]s and [[vegetable]]s, as well as [[milk]] and [[meat]] products. In some parts of the continent, the traditional diet features a preponderance of milk, [[curd]] and [[whey]] products. In much of tropical Africa, however, cow's milk is rare and cannot be produced locally (owing to various diseases that affect livestock). The continent's diverse demographic makeup is reflected in the many different eating and drinking habits, dishes, and preparation techniques of its manifold populations.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Cookbook/about_cb_wh.html |title=The African Cookbook |author=Bea Sandler |coauthor= |others=Diane and Leo Dillon (Illust.)|publisher=Carol Publishing Group |year=1993 |isbn=0-8065-1398-5 |accessdate=2008-12-18}}</ref>

The term is used by [[East Asia]]ns to contrast with Asian styles of cooking.<ref name="Leung">Leung Man-tao (12 February 2007), "Eating and Cultural Stereotypes", ''Eat and Travel Weekly'', no. 312, p. 76. Hong Kong<!--: PUBLISHER HERE--></ref> This is analogous to Westerners referring collectively to the cuisines of Asian countries as [[Asian cuisine]]. When used by Westerners, the term may refer more specifically to cuisine ''in'' Europe; in this context, a synonym is '''[[Continental Europe|Continental]] cuisine''', especially in [[British English]].
