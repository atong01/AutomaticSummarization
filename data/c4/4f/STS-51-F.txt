'''STS-51-F''' (also known as '''Spacelab 2''') was the nineteenth flight of [[NASA]]'s [[Space Shuttle program]], and the eighth flight of [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']]. It launched from [[Kennedy Space Center]], [[Florida]], on July 29, 1985, and landed just under eight days later on August 6.

While STS-51-F's primary payload was the [[Spacelab]] 2 laboratory module, the payload which received the most publicity was the Carbonated Beverage Dispenser Evaluation, which was an experiment in which both [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Pepsi]] tried to make their carbonated drinks available to astronauts.<ref>[http://www.space.com/12128-9-weird-nasa-space-shuttle-cargo-mementos-countdown.html 9 Weird Things That Flew on NASA's Space Shuttles | Final Shuttle Missions & NASA's Space Shuttle Souvenirs | NASA Shuttle Program | Space.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

During launch the ''Challenger'' experienced multiple sensor failings in its [[Space Shuttle Main Engine|SSME]]s and had to perform an "Abort to Orbit" (ATO) emergency procedure. It is the only mission to have carried out an [[Space Shuttle abort modes|abort]] after launching. As a result of the ATO, the mission was carried out at a slightly lower orbital altitude.

Acton, Bridges and Henize made up the "Red Team" while Bartoe, England and Musgrave comprised the "Blue Team"; commander Fullerton could take either shift when needed.<ref name=presskit>{{cite web|title=Space Shuttle Mission STS-51F Press Kit|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/shuttle_pk/pk/Flight_019_STS-51F_Press_Kit.pdf|publisher=NASA|accessdate=March 1, 2014|archivedate=2001|year=1985}}</ref> ''Challenger'' carried two [[Extravehicular Mobility Unit|EMU]]s in the event of an emergency spacewalk, which would have been performed by England and Musgrave.<ref name=presskit />

==Launch==
STS-51-F's first launch attempt on July 12, 1985 was halted with the countdown at T-3 seconds after main engine ignition, when a malfunction of the number two [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]] (SSME) coolant valve caused the shutdown of all three main engines. ''Challenger'' launched successfully on its second attempt on July 29, 1985, at 17:00 EDT, after a delay of one hour and 37 minutes due to a problem with the table maintenance block update uplink.

Three minutes and 31 seconds into the ascent, one of the center engine's two high pressure fuel turbopump turbine discharge temperature sensors failed. Two minutes and 12 seconds later, the second sensor failed, causing the shutdown of the center engine. This was the only in-flight main engine failure of the shuttle program. Approximately 8 minutes into the flight, one of the same temperature sensors in the right engine failed, and the remaining right engine temperature sensor displayed readings near the redline for engine shutdown. [[Booster Systems Engineer]] Jenny M. Howard acted quickly to command the crew to inhibit any further automatic SSME shutdowns based on readings from the remaining sensors, preventing the potential shutdown of a second engine and a possible abort mode that may have resulted in the loss of the vehicle and crew.<ref>{{Cite news

The failed SSME resulted in an [[Space Shuttle abort modes#Abort to Orbit (ATO)|Abort to Orbit (ATO)]] trajectory, whereby the shuttle achieved a lower-than-planned orbital altitude.

==Mission summary==
[[Image:STS-51-F Plasma Diagnostics Package.jpg|thumb|The Plasma Diagnostics Package (PDP) grappled by the [[Remote Manipulator System]] (RMS).]]
STS-51-F's primary payload was the laboratory module Spacelab 2. A special part of the modular Spacelab system, the "[[igloo]]", which was located at head of a three-pallet train, provided on-site support to instruments mounted on pallets. The main mission objective was to verify performance of Spacelab systems, determine the interface capability of the orbiter, and measure the environment created by the spacecraft. Experiments covered [[life science]]s, [[plasma physics]], [[astronomy]], high-energy [[astrophysics]], [[solar physics]], [[atmospheric physics]] and technology research. Despite mission replanning necessitated by ''Challenger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Space Shuttle abort modes#Intact abort modes|abort to orbit]] trajectory, the Spacelab mission was declared a success.

The flight marked the first time the [[European Space Agency|ESA]] Instrument Pointing System (IPS) was tested in orbit. This unique pointing instrument was designed with an accuracy of one [[arcsecond]]. Initially, some problems were experienced when it was commanded to track the [[Sun]], but a series of software fixes were made and the problem was corrected. In addition, [[Anthony W. England|Tony England]] became the second [[amateur radio operator]] to [[Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment|transmit from space]] during the mission.

The Spacelab Infrared Telescope (IRT) was also flown on the mission.<ref name=kent/> The IRT was a 15.2&nbsp;cm aperture helium-cooled [[infrared]] telescope, observing light between wavelengths of 1.7 to 118 μm.<ref name=kent>[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1992ApJS...78..403K Kent, et al. – '''Galactic structure from the Spacelab infrared telescope''' (1992)].</ref> The experiment experienced some problems, such as heat emissions from the Shuttle corrupting data, but still returned useful astronomical data.<ref name=kent/>

The Plasma Diagnostics Package (PDP), which had been previously flown on [[STS-3]], made its return on the mission, and was part of a set of plasma physics experiments designed to study the Earth's [[ionosphere]]. During the third day of the mission, it was grappled out of the payload bay by the [[Remote Manipulator System]] and released for six hours.<ref name=report>{{cite web|title=STS-51F National Space Transportation System Mission Report|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/52621059/STS-51F-National-Space-Transportation-System-Mission-Report|publisher=NASA Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|accessdate=March 1, 2014|archivedate=April 9, 2011|page=2|date=September 1985}}</ref> During this time, ''Challenger'' maneuvered around the PDP as part of a proximity operations exercise. The PDP was successfully grappled by the RMS and returned to the payload bay at the beginning of the fourth day of the mission.<ref name=report />

In a heavily-publicized marketing experiment, astronauts aboard STS-51-F drank [[soft drink|carbonated beverage]]s from specially-designed cans provided by [[Cola Wars|competitors]] [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Pepsi]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Pearlman|first=Robert|title=A Brief History of Space Marketing|url=http://www.space.com/news/spaceagencies/space_market_010531-1.html|publisher=SPACE.com|accessdate=March 24, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214131154/http://space.com/news/spaceagencies/space_market_010531-1.html|archivedate=February 14, 2009|date=May 31, 2001}}</ref>  Post-flight, the astronauts revealed that they preferred [[Tang (beverage)|Tang]], in part because it could be mixed on-orbit with existing chilled water supplies, whereas there was no dedicated refrigeration equipment on board to chill the soda, which also [[fizz]]ed excessively in [[microgravity]].

==Landing==
''Challenger'' landed at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], [[California]], on August 6, 1985, at 12:45:26&nbsp;pm PDT. Its rollout distance was {{convert|8569|ft|m}}. The mission had been extended by 17 orbits for additional payload activities due to the Abort to Orbit. The orbiter arrived back at Kennedy Space Center on August 11, 1985.

==Mission insignia==
The mission insignia was designed by [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] artist Skip Bradley. [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']] is depicted ascending toward the heavens in search of new knowledge in the field of solar and stellar astronomy, with its Spacelab 2 payload. The constellations [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]] and [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] are shown in the positions they were in relative to the Sun during the flight. The nineteen stars indicate that the mission is the 19th shuttle flight.
