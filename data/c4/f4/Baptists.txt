{{Baptist}}
'''Baptists''' are individuals who comprise a group of [[Christian denomination]]s and churches that subscribe to a doctrine that [[baptism]] should be performed only for professing believers ([[believer's baptism]], as opposed to [[infant baptism]]), and that it must be done by complete [[Immersion baptism|immersion]] (as opposed to [[affusion]] or [[Aspersion|sprinkling]]). Other [[tenets]] of Baptist churches include [[soul competency]] (liberty), [[salvation]] through [[Sola fide|faith alone]], [[Sola scriptura|Scripture alone]] as the rule of faith and practice, and the autonomy of the local [[Congregationalist polity|congregation]]. Baptists recognize two ministerial offices, [[pastor]]s and [[deacon]]s. Baptist churches are widely considered to be [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches, though some Baptists disavow this identity.<ref name="Baptist Origins">Buescher, John.

Diverse from their beginning, those identifying as Baptists today differ widely from one another in what they believe, how they worship, their attitudes toward other Christians, and their understanding of what is important in Christian discipleship.<ref name ="Shurden turning">{{Cite web| last =Shurden | first = Walter |title=Turning Points in Baptist History |publisher=The Center for Baptist Studies, Mercer University|location= Macon, GA |year=2001 |accessdate=16 January 2010 |url = http://www.centerforbaptiststudies.org/pamphlets/style/turningpoints.htm}}</ref>

In 1638, [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] established the [[first Baptist church in America|first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies]]. In the mid-18th century, the [[First Great Awakening]] increased Baptist growth in both New England and the South.<ref name="EBOself">"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/52364/Baptist Baptist]."  2010.

==Origins==
Baptist historian Bruce Gourley outlines four main views of Baptist origins: (1)&nbsp;The modern scholarly consensus that the movement traces its origin to the 17th century via the [[English Dissenters|English Separatists]], (2)&nbsp;the view that it was an outgrowth of Anabaptist traditions, (3)&nbsp;the perpetuity view which assumes that the Baptist faith and practice has existed since the time of Christ, and (4)&nbsp;the successionist view, or "[[Baptist successionism]]", which argues that Baptist churches actually existed in an unbroken chain since the time of Christ.<ref name="Gourley">Gourley, Bruce. "A Very Brief Introduction to Baptist History, Then and Now." ''The Baptist Observer.''</ref>

===English separatist view===
modern Baptist churches trace their history to the [[English Dissenters|English Separatist]] movement in the century after the rise of the original Protestant denominations.<ref name="Brackney" /> This view of Baptist origins has the most historical support and is the most widely accepted.<ref name="ETS">{{cite news|title=Anabaptist kinship or English dissent? Papers at ETS examine Baptist origins|newspaper=[[Baptist Press]]| first =Jeff | last = Robinson|date=14 Dec 2009|url= http://www.bpnews.net/printerfriendly.asp?ID=31878}}</ref>  Adherents to this position consider the influence of Anabaptists upon early Baptists to be minimal.<ref name = "Gourley" />  It was a time of considerable political and religious turmoil. Both individuals and churches were willing to give up their theological roots if they became convinced that a more biblical "truth" had been discovered.{{Sfn | Leonard | 2003}}{{Page needed |date=June 2014}}

During the [[Protestant Reformation]], the [[Church of England]] (Anglicans) separated from the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. There were some Christians who were not content with the achievements of the mainstream Protestant Reformation.<ref name= "Shurden turning" /><ref name="Briggs">{{Cite web| last =Briggs | first = John |title=Baptist Origins |publisher= Baptist History and Heritage Society |accessdate =10 January 2010 |url= http://www.baptisthistory.org/contissues/briggs.htm| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100105221040/http://www.baptisthistory.org/contissues/briggs.htm | archivedate= 5 January 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref> There also were Christians who were disappointed that the Church of England had not made corrections of what some considered to be errors and abuses. Of those most critical of the Church's direction, some chose to stay and try to make constructive changes from within the Anglican Church. They became known as "[[Puritans]]" and are described by Gourley as cousins of the English Separatists. Others decided they must leave the Church because of their dissatisfaction and became known as the Separatists.<ref name="Gourley" />

Historians trace the earliest Baptist church back to 1609 in Amsterdam, with [[John Smyth (Baptist minister)|John Smyth]] as its pastor.<ref name= "Gourley" />  Three years earlier, while a Fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge, he had broken his ties with the Church of England. Reared in the Church of England, he became "Puritan, English Separatist, and then a Baptist Separatist," and ended his days working with the Mennonites.{{Sfn | Leonard | 2003 | p = 23}} He began meeting in England with 60–70 English Separatists, in the face of "great danger."<ref>{{Cite book| last =Beale | first = David |title=The Mayflower Pilgrims: roots of Puritan, Presbyterian, Congregationalist, and Baptist heritage | publisher = Emerald House |year= 2000 |isbn= 978-1-889893-51-8}}</ref> The persecution of religious nonconformists in England led Smyth to go into exile in [[Amsterdam]] with fellow Separatists from the congregation he had gathered in Lincolnshire, separate from the established church (Anglican). Smyth and his lay supporter, [[Thomas Helwys]], together with those they led, broke with the other English exiles because Smyth and Helwys were convinced they should be baptized as believers. In 1609 Smyth first baptized himself and then baptized the others.<ref name="Briggs" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.reformedreader.org/history/pbh.htm|title=A Primer on Baptist History|last=Traffanstedt|first=Chris|accessdate=23 December 2009| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100203160034/http://www.reformedreader.org/history/pbh.htm | archivedate= 3 February 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

In 1609, while still there, Smyth wrote a tract titled "The Character of the Beast," or "The False Constitution of the Church." In it he expressed two propositions: first, infants are not to be baptized; and second, "Antichristians converted are to be admitted into the true Church by baptism."{{Sfn | Leonard | 2003 | p = 24}}  Hence, his conviction was that a scriptural church should consist only of regenerate believers who have been baptized on a personal confession of faith. He rejected the Separatist movement's doctrine of infant baptism ([[paedobaptism]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nettles|first=Tom J. |date=Spring 2009|title=Once Upon a Time, Four Hundred Years Ago... |journal=Founders Journal|publisher=[[Founders Ministries]]|volume= 76|pages = 2–8 |url = http://www.founders.org/journal/fj76/article1.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.reformedreader.org/history/vedder/ch14.htm|title=A Short History of the Baptists|last=Vedder|first=HC|publisher= The Reformed Reader|accessdate= 23 December 2009}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, Smyth left the group, and layman Thomas Helwys took over the leadership, leading the church back to England in 1611.<ref name = "Gourley" /> Ultimately, Smyth became committed to believers' baptism as the only biblical baptism. He was convinced on the basis of his interpretation of Scripture that infants would not be damned should they die in infancy.{{Sfn | Leonard | 2003 | p = 25}}

[[File:TheDippersDipt.jpg|thumb|Print from Anglican theologian [[Daniel Featley]]'s book, "The Dippers Dipt, or, The Anabaptists Duck'd and Plung'd Over Head and Ears, at a Disputation in Southwark", published in 1645.]]
Smyth, convinced that his self-baptism was invalid, applied with the [[Mennonites]] for membership. He died while waiting for membership, and some of his followers became Mennonites. Thomas Helwys and others kept their baptism and their Baptist commitments.{{Sfn | Leonard | 2003 | p = 25}}  The modern Baptist denomination is an outgrowth of Smyth's movement.<ref name = "Briggs" />  Baptists rejected the name Anabaptist when they were called that by opponents in derision. McBeth writes that as late as the 18th century, many Baptists referred to themselves as "the Christians commonly—though ''falsely''—called Anabaptists."<ref name="McBeth Bapt Beg">{{Cite web|url=http://www.baptisthistory.org/baptistbeginnings.htm|title= Baptist Beginnings | last = McBeth| first= H Leon |publisher= Baptist History and Heritage Society |accessdate= 19 October 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071021083427/http://baptisthistory.org/baptistbeginnings.htm| archivedate = 21 October 2007  | deadurl = no}}</ref>

Another milestone in the early development of Baptist doctrine was in 1638 with [[John Spilsbury (Baptist minister)|John Spilsbury]], a Calvinistic minister who helped recover the practice of believer's [[Immersion baptism|baptism by immersion]].<ref name = "ETS"/>  According to Tom Nettles, professor of historical theology at [[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]], "Spilsbury's cogent arguments for a gathered, disciplined congregation of believers baptized by immersion as constituting the New Testament church gave expression to and built on insights that had emerged within separatism, advanced in the life of John Smyth and the suffering congregation of Thomas Helwys, and matured in Particular Baptists."<ref name="ETS" />

===Anabaptist influence view===
A minority view is that early seventeenth-century Baptists were influenced by (but not directly connected to) continental [[Anabaptist]]s.<ref name="Priest">{{citation|last=Priest|first=Gerald L PhD|title= Are Baptists Protestants?|publisher= Detroit Baptist Theological Seminary|date= 14 October 2010|format=PDF|url=http://www.dbts.edu/pdf/macp/2007/Priest,%20Are%20Baptists%20Protestants.pdf}}.</ref> According to this view, the General Baptists shared similarities with Dutch Waterlander Mennonites (one of many Anabaptist groups) including believer's baptism, religious liberty, separation of church and state, and Arminian views of salvation, predestination and original sin. Representative writers including AC Underwood and William R Estep. Gourley wrote that among some contemporary Baptist scholars who emphasize the faith of the community over soul liberty, the Anabaptist influence theory is making a comeback.<ref name="Gourley" />

However, the relations between Baptists and Anabaptists were early strained. In 1624, the then five existing Baptist churches of London issued a condemnation of the Anabaptists. Furthermore, the original group associated with Smyth and popularly believed to be the first Baptists broke with the Waterlander Mennonite Anabaptists after a brief period of association in the Netherlands.<ref>{{citation|last=Melton|first=JG|contribution=Baptists|title=Encyclopedia of American Religions|year= 1994}}.</ref>

===Perpetuity view===
{{Main |Baptist successionism}}
Prior to the 20th century, Baptist historians generally wrote from the perspective that Baptists had existed since the time of Christ.{{Sfn | Torbet | 1975 | pp = 18–9}}  Proponents of the Baptist perpetuity view consider the Baptist movement to have always been separate from [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and in existence prior to the [[Protestant Reformation]].<ref name="H. Leon McBeth pages 59-60">{{citation|first=H Leon|last=McBeth|title=The Baptist Heritage|pages=59–60| place = Nashville | publisher = Broadman Press|year= 1987}}.</ref>

The perpetuity view is often identified with ''[[The Trail of Blood]]'', a pamphlet by J.M. Carrol published in 1931.<ref name= "H. Leon McBeth pages 59-60" />  Other Baptist writers holding the perpetuity view are [[John T. Christian]], [[Thomas Crosby (Baptist)|Thomas Crosby]], G. H. Orchard, J. M. Cramp, William Cathcart, Adam Taylor and D. B. Ray<ref name="H. Leon McBeth pages 59-60" />{{Sfn | Torbet | 1975 | p = 18}}  This view was also held by English Baptist preacher, [[Charles Spurgeon]]<ref>{{citation |title= The New park Street Pulpit|volume=VII|page= 225}}.</ref> as well as [[Jesse Mercer]], the namesake of Mercer University.<ref>{{cite web| first =Jesse | last = Mercer|title= A History of the Georgia Baptist Association|pages = 196–201 | year =1838|url= http://baptisthistoryhomepage.com/1811cl_mercer.html}}</ref>{{Or|date=January 2013}}

In 1612, Thomas Helwys established a Baptist congregation in London, consisting of congregants from Smyth's church. A number of other Baptist churches sprang up, and they became known as the General Baptists. The Particular Baptists were established when a group of Calvinist Separatists adopted believers' Baptism.{{Sfn | Wright | 2004}}{{Page needed |date=June 2014}}

The [[Great Awakening]] energized the Baptist movement, and the Baptist community experienced spectacular growth. Baptists became the largest Christian community in many southern states, including among the black population.<ref name="ODCC self" />

Baptist missionary work in Canada began in the British colony of [[Nova Scotia]] (present day Nova Scotia and [[New Brunswick]]) in the 1760s.{{Sfn | Bumstead | 1984 | p = 40}} The first official record of a Baptist church in Canada was that of the Horton Baptist Church (now Wolfville) in Wolfville, Nova Scotia on 29 October 1778.{{Sfn | Bumstead | 1984 | p = 62}}  The church was established with the assistance of the [[New Light]] evangelist [[Henry Alline]].

In May 1845, the Baptist congregations in the United States split over slavery and missions.

==Baptist affiliations==
{{Denominations of Christianity}}

Many Baptist churches choose to affiliate with organizational groups that provide fellowship without control.<ref name="ODCC self" /> The largest such group is the [[Southern Baptist Convention]]. There also are a substantial number of [[List of Baptist sub-denominations|smaller cooperative groups]]. Finally, there are Baptist churches that choose to remain autonomous and independent of any denomination, organization, or association.<ref>{{citation|last =Moore|first=G Holmes|title=300&nbsp;Years of Baptist History|quote=Bible Baptist Church of St. Louis, MO, is an example of an independent Baptist church that has never been a denominational church in the sense of belonging to some convention or association|date=17 January 2010|url=http://www.reformedreader.org/history/350years.htm}}.</ref> It has been suggested that a primary Baptist principle is that local Baptist Churches are independent and self-governing,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.londonbaptist.org.uk/about-us/baptists/?option=com_content&view=article&id=94:what-is-the-history-of-the-lba&catid=43&Itemid=105|title=What are Baptists?

===Qualification for membership===
Membership policies vary due to the autonomy of churches, but the traditional method by which an individual becomes a member of a church is through [[believer's baptism]], which is a public profession of faith in Jesus, followed by water baptism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Church Manual For Baptist Churches | last =Pendleton | first = James Madison |authorlink=James Madison Pendleton |year= 1867 |publisher= The Judson Press |url = http://www.reformedreader.org/rbb/pendleton/churchmanual/bcm01.htm}}</ref>

Most baptists do not believe that baptism is a requirement for salvation, but rather a public expression of one's inner repentance and faith.<ref name="Brackney" />  Therefore, some churches will admit into membership persons who make a profession without believer's baptism.<ref>{{cite web|title=Church's elders cancel vote on membership without baptism|url=http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?id=23725|work=Baptist Press|accessdate=8 November 2011}}</ref>

In general, Baptist churches do not have a stated age restriction on membership, but believer's baptism requires that an individual be able to freely and earnestly profess their faith.<ref>{{cite web|title=Baptist Faith and Mission|url = http://www.sbc.net/bfm/ | publisher =Southern Baptist Convention|accessdate=8 November 2011}}</ref>  (See [[Believer's Baptism#Age of accountability|Age of Accountability]])

==Baptist beliefs and principles==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2012}}
{{Main|Baptist beliefs}}
{{Protestant}}

Baptists, like other Christians, are defined by doctrine—some of it common to all orthodox and evangelical groups and a portion of it distinctive to Baptists.<ref>{{Cite web|author= Nettles, Thomas J |title=A Foundation for the Future: The Southern Baptist Message and Mission |accessdate=17 January 2010 |url=http://www.reformedreader.org/baptists.htm}}</ref> Through the years, different Baptist groups have issued confessions of faith—without considering them to be ''creeds''—to express their particular doctrinal distinctions in comparison to other Christians as well as in comparison to other Baptists.<ref name="Shurden fragile">{{Cite book|author=Shurden, Walter B |title=The Baptist Identity: Four Fragile Freedoms |location=Macon, Georgia |publisher=Smyth & Helwys Publishing |year=1993 |isbn=978-1-880837-20-7}}</ref> Most Baptists are evangelical in doctrine, but Baptist beliefs can vary due to the congregational governance system that gives autonomy to individual local Baptist churches.<ref name="Baptist Origins"/> Historically, Baptists have played a key role in encouraging religious freedom and separation of church and state.<ref>{{citation|title=Religion Facts|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/christianity/denominations/baptists.htm|contribution=Baptists|accessdate =17 January 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100110123654/http://www.religionfacts.com/christianity/denominations/baptists.htm| archivedate= 10 January 2010 | deadurl= no}}.</ref>

Shared doctrines would include beliefs about one God; the virgin birth; miracles; atonement for sins through the death, burial, and bodily resurrection of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]]; the [[Trinity]]; the need for salvation (through belief in Jesus Christ as the son of God, his death and resurrection, and confession of Christ as Lord); grace; the Kingdom of God; last things (eschatology) (Jesus Christ will return personally and visibly in glory to the earth, the dead will be raised, and Christ will judge everyone in righteousness); and evangelism and missions. Some historically significant Baptist doctrinal documents include the [[1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith]], 1742 Philadelphia Baptist Confession, the [[1833 New Hampshire Baptist Confession of Faith]], the [[Southern Baptist Convention]]'s ''[[Baptist Faith and Message]],'' and written [[church covenant]]s which some individual Baptist churches adopt as a statement of their faith and beliefs.

Most Baptists hold that no church or ecclesiastical organization has inherent authority over a Baptist church. Churches can properly relate to each other under this polity only through voluntary cooperation, never by any sort of coercion. Furthermore, this Baptist polity calls for freedom from governmental control.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Pinson, William M, Jr|title=Trends in Baptist Polity|publisher=Baptist History and Heritage Society |url=http://www.baptisthistory.org/contissues/pinson.htm}}</ref>

Exceptions to this local form of local governance include a few churches that submit to the leadership of a body of [[Elder (Christianity)#Baptists|elders]], as well as the [[Episcopal Baptist]]s that have an [[Episcopal polity|Episcopal system]].

Baptists generally believe in the literal [[Second Coming]] of Christ. Beliefs among Baptists regarding the "[[Christian eschatology|end times]]" include [[amillennialism]], [[dispensationalism]], and historic [[premillennialism]], with views such as [[postmillennialism]] and [[preterism]] receiving some support.

Some additional distinctive Baptist principles held by many Baptists:<ref name="Newman" />{{rp|2}}
* The supremacy of the canonical Scriptures as a norm of faith and practice. For something to become a matter of faith and practice, it is not sufficient for it to be merely ''consistent with'' and not contrary to scriptural principles. It must be something ''explicitly'' ordained through command or example in the Bible. For instance, this is why Baptists do not practice infant baptism—they say the Bible neither commands nor exemplifies infant baptism as a Christian practice. More than any other Baptist principle, this one when applied to infant baptism is said to separate Baptists from other evangelical Christians.
* Baptists believe that faith is a matter between God and the individual ([[religious freedom]]). To them it means the advocacy of absolute liberty of conscience.
* Insistence on immersion as the only mode of baptism. Baptists do not believe that baptism is necessary for salvation. Therefore, they do not consider it to be a sacrament, since it imparts no saving grace.<ref name="Newman">{{Cite book|last=Newman|first =Albert Henry |authorlink= |title=A History of the Baptist Churches in the United States |edition=3rd |url= https://books.google.com/?id=F38uAAAAYAAJ |year=1915 |publisher=Christian Literature |isbn=0-7905-4234-X}}</ref>

===Beliefs that vary among Baptists===
Since there is no hierarchical authority and each Baptist church is autonomous, there is no official set of Baptist theological beliefs.<ref>{{citation|last1=Hammett|first1=John|first2=John S|last2=Hammett|quote=One thing that all Baptists have in common is that everything is built upon the Bible.|title=Biblical Foundations for Baptist Churches: A Contemporary Ecclesiology|publisher=Kregel Publications|year=2005|ISBN= 978-0-8254-2769-5}}.</ref> These differences exist both among associations, and even among churches within the associations.

Some doctrinal issues on which there is widespread difference among Baptists are:
* [[Eschatology]]
* [[Calvinism]] vs. [[Arminianism]]
* The [[doctrine of separation]] from "the world" and whether to associate with those who are "of the world"
* [[Glossolalia]] (speaking in tongues)<ref>{{citation|contribution=Position Paper Concerning the IMB Policy on Glossolalia|title=Florida Baptist Witness|accessdate =18 March 2010|url= http://www.gofbw.com/news.asp?ID=5592}}.</ref>
* How the Bible should be interpreted ([[hermeneutics]])
* The extent to which [[Mission (Christian)|missionary]] boards should be used to support missionaries
* The extent to which non-members may participate in the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]] services
* Which translation of Scripture to use (see [[King-James-Only movement]])<ref>{{citation|title=An Introduction to Bible Translations|publisher=Trinity Baptist Church Discipleship Training|date=April 2005|accessdate =18 March 2010|format=[[PDF]]|url = http://www.trinitybaptistreformed.org/files/Download/Bible%20Translations%20+.pdf}}.</ref>
* [[Dispensationalism]] vs. [[Covenant theology]]
* The role of [[Christian views of marriage|women in marriage]].
* The [[Women in Christianity|ordination of women]] as deacons or pastors.<ref>{{cite web|last=Beck|first=Rosalie (Response to 'The Ordination of Women Among Texas Baptists' by Ann Miller)|title=Perspectives in Religious Studies|journal = Journal of the NABPR|publisher=Baylor University, Baptist General Convention of Texas|accessdate =18 March 2010|url= http://www.bgct.org/texasbaptists/Document.Doc?&id=3338}}</ref>
* Attitudes to, and involvement in the [[ecumenical movement]]. In Britain the majority of Baptist churches take a pragmatic and positive view, but some church groupings (not always bearing the name [[Baptist]] but Baptist in practice) take a strong negative line.

==Controversies that have shaped Baptists==
Baptists have faced many controversies in their 400-year history, controversies of the level of crises. Baptist historian Walter Shurden says the word "crisis" comes from the Greek word meaning "to decide." Shurden writes that contrary to the presumed negative view of crises, some controversies that reach a crisis level may actually be "positive and highly productive." He claims that even schism, though never ideal, has often produced positive results. In his opinion crises among Baptists each have become decision-moments that shaped their future.<ref name="Shurden crises">{{Cite book| last =Shurden | first = Walter B |title=Crises in Baptist Life |accessdate=16 January 2010 | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] | url = http://www.baptistdistinctives.org/crises.pdf}}</ref> Some controversies that have shaped Baptists include the "missions crisis", the "slavery crisis", the "landmark crisis", and the "modernist crisis".

===Missions crisis===
Early in the 19th century, the rise of the modern [[Mission (Christian)|missions]] movement, and the backlash against it, led to widespread and bitter controversy among the American Baptists.{{Sfn | Christian | 1926 | pp = 404–20}}  During this era, the American Baptists were split between missionary and anti-missionary. A substantial secession of Baptists went into the movement led by [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]], to return to a more fundamental church.{{Sfn | Christian | 1926 | pp = 421–36}}

===Slavery crisis===
Leading up to the [[American Civil War]], Baptists became embroiled in the controversy over [[slavery in the United States]]. Whereas in the First [[Great Awakening]], [[Methodist]] and Baptist preachers had opposed slavery and urged manumission, over the decades they made more of an accommodation with the institution. They worked with slaveholders in the South to urge a paternalistic institution. Both denominations made direct appeals to slaves and free blacks for conversion. The Baptists particularly allowed them active roles in congregations. By the mid-19th century, northern Baptists tended to oppose slavery. As tensions increased, in 1844 the [[Home Mission Society]] refused to appoint a slaveholder as a missionary who had been proposed by Georgia. It noted that missionaries could not take servants with them, and also that the Board did not want to appear to condone slavery.

The [[Southern Baptist Convention]] was formed by nine state conventions in 1845, founded in part on the premise that the Bible sanctions slavery and that it is acceptable for Christians to own slaves. They believed slavery was a human institution which Baptist teaching could make less harsh. Not only were many planters among its membership, but some of the denomination's prominent preachers, such as the Rev. [[Basil Manly, Sr.]], president of the [[University of Alabama]], were [[Plantations in the American South|planters]] and owned slaves.

As early as the late 18th century, black Baptists began to organize separate churches, associations and mission agencies, especially in the northern states. Not only did blacks set up some independent congregations in the South before the [[American Civil War]], [[freedmen]] quickly separated from white congregations and associations after the war. They wanted to be free of white supervision.<ref>{{citation|first=Leroy|last=Fitts|title=A History of Black Baptists|pages=43–106|place= Nashville, TN | publisher = Broadman Press|year=1985}}</ref> In 1866 the Consolidated American Baptist Convention, formed from black Baptists of the South and West, helped southern associations set up black state conventions, which they did in [[Alabama]], [[Arkansas]], [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Kentucky]]. In 1880 black state conventions united in the national Foreign Mission Convention, to support black Baptist missionary work. Two other national black conventions were formed, and in 1895 they united as the [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptist Convention]]. This organization later went through its own changes, spinning off other conventions. It is the largest black religious organization and the second largest Baptist organization in the world.<ref>Fitts (1985)</ref>  Baptists are numerically most dominant in the Southeast.<ref>{{citation| publisher =Department of Geography and Meteorology, [[Valparaiso University]]|format=[[GIFF]]|url=http://www.valpo.edu/geomet/pics/geo200/religion/baptist.gif|title= Baptists as a Percentage of all Residents, 2000}}.</ref>  In 2007, the [[Pew Research Center]]'s Religious Landscape Survey found that 45% of all African-Americans identify with Baptist denominations, with the vast majority of those being within the historically black tradition.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Religious Portrait of African-Americans| publisher = Pew forum | url= http://www.pewforum.org/A-Religious-Portrait-of-African-Americans.aspx}}</ref>

Elsewhere in the Americas, in the Caribbean in particular, Baptist missionaries took an active role in the anti-slavery movement. In Jamaica, for example, [[William Knibb]], a prominent British Baptist missionary, worked toward the emancipation of slaves in the [[British West Indies]] (which took place in 1838). Knibb also protagonised the creation of "[[Free Villages]]"; rural communities centred around a Baptist church where emancipated slaves could farm their own land. Baptists were likewise active in promoting the education of former slaves; for example, Jamaica's [[Calabar High School]], named after the slave port of [[Calabar]], was formed by Baptist missionaries. At the same time, during and after slavery, slaves and free formed their own [[Spiritual Baptist]] movements - breakaway spiritual movements which often expressed resistance to oppression.<ref>{{citation|first=Jean|last=Besson|title=Martha Brae's Two Histories | place= Chapel Hill | publisher = University of North Carolina |year=2002}}</ref>

===Memory of slavery===
In the South itself the interpretation of the tumultuous 1860s differed sharply by race. Americans often interpreted great events in religious terms. Historian Wilson Fallin contrasts the interpretation of Civil War and Reconstruction in white versus black memory using Baptist sermons in Alabama. Whites preachers expressed the view that:
: God had chastised them and given them a special mission – to maintain orthodoxy, strict biblicism, personal piety, and traditional race relations. Slavery, they insisted, had not been sinful. Rather, emancipation was a historical tragedy and the end of Reconstruction was a clear sign of God's favor.
In sharp contrast, Black preachers interpreted the Civil War, emancipation and Reconstruction as:
: God's gift of freedom. They appreciated opportunities to exercise their independence, to worship in their own way, to affirm their worth and dignity, and to proclaim the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. Most of all, they could form their own churches, associations, and conventions. These institutions offered self-help and racial uplift, and provided places where the gospel of liberation could be proclaimed. As a result, black preachers continued to insist that God would protect and help him; God would be their rock in a stormy land.<ref>Wilson Fallin Jr.,  ''Uplifting the People: Three Centuries of Black Baptists in Alabama'' (2007) pp. 52-53</ref>

On 20 June 1995, the Southern Baptist Convention voted to adopt a resolution renouncing its racist roots and apologizing for its past defense of slavery. More than 20,000 Southern Baptists registered for the meeting in Atlanta. The resolution declared that messengers, as SBC delegates are called, "unwaveringly denounce racism, in all its forms, as deplorable sin" and "lament and repudiate historic acts of evil such as slavery from which we continue to reap a bitter harvest."  It offered an apology to all African-Americans for "condoning and/or perpetuating individual and systemic racism in our lifetime" and repentance for "racism of which we have been guilty, whether consciously or unconsciously."  Although Southern Baptists have condemned racism in the past, this was the first time the predominantly white convention had dealt specifically with the issue of slavery.

The statement sought forgiveness "from our African-American brothers and sisters" and pledged to "eradicate racism in all its forms from Southern Baptist life and ministry." Currently about 500,000 members of the 15.6-million-member denomination are African Americans and another 300,000 are [[ethnic]] minorities. The resolution marked the denomination's first formal acknowledgment that [[racism]] played a role in its founding.<ref>"SBC renounces racist past – Southern Baptist Convention", ''The Christian Century.'' 5 July 1995</ref>

===Landmark crisis===
Southern Baptist [[Landmarkism]] sought to reset the ecclesiastical separation which had characterized the old Baptist churches, in an era when inter-denominational union meetings were the order of the day.<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Ashcraft | title = Landmarkism Revisited|pages=84–5|publisher=Ashcraft Publications|place=Mabelvale, [[Arkansas|AR]]|year=2003}}.</ref> [[James Robinson Graves]] was an influential Baptist of the 19th century and the primary leader of this movement.<ref>{{cite book | first = Ben M.|last=Bogard|title=Pillars of Orthodoxy|page=199|place=Louisville|publisher= Baptist Book Concern|year= 1900}}.</ref> While some Landmarkers eventually separated from the Southern Baptist Convention, the influence of the movement on the Convention continued into the 20th century.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Smith|last2=Handy|last3=Loetscher|title=American Christianity: An Historical Interpretation With Representative Documents|volume=II: 1820–1960|page= 110|publisher= Charles Scribner's Sons |year= 1963}}.</ref> Its influence continues to affect convention policies. In 2005, the Southern Baptist International Mission Board forbade its missionaries to receive alien immersions for baptism.<ref>{{Cite web|publisher=International Mission Board |title=Guideline on Baptism |url= http://www.imb.org/main/news/details.asp?LanguageID=1709&StoryID=3837 |accessdate= }}</ref>

===Modernist crisis===
The rise of [[Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy|theological modernism]] in the latter 19th and 20th century also greatly affected Baptists.{{Sfn | Torbet | 1975 | pp = 424–45}}  The Landmark movement, already mentioned, has been described as a reaction against incipient modernism among Southern Baptists.<ref>{{citation|title=History of the American Baptist Association|editor1-first=Robert|editor1-last= Ashcraft|pages= 63–6|series= Texarkana|publisher= History and Archives Committee of the American Baptist Association|year=2000}}</ref> In England, [[Charles Haddon Spurgeon]] fought against modernistic views of the Scripture in the [[Downgrade Controversy]] and severed his church from the Baptist Union as a result.{{Sfn | Torbet | 1975 | p = 114}}<ref name="downgrade">{{Cite book | last = Spurgeon| first = Charles | title = The "Down Grade" Controversy  | publisher =  Pilgrim Publications | location = Pasadena, Texas| page = 264 | date = 2009 | url = http://www.spurgeon.org/misc/dwngrd.htm | isbn = 1561862118}}</ref><ref name="Nettles">{{Cite book | last = Nettles | first = Tom | title = Living By Revealed Truth The Life and Pastoral Theology of Charles Haddon Spurgeon | publisher = Christian Focus Publishing| location = Ross-shire | pages = 700 | date = 21 July 2013 | isbn =9781781911228 }}</ref>

The [[Northern Baptist Convention]] in the United States had internal conflict over modernism in the early 20th century, ultimately embracing it.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Two new conservative associations were founded as a result: the [[General Association of Regular Baptist Churches]] in 1933 and the [[Conservative Baptist Association of America]] in 1947.{{Sfn | Torbet | 1975 | pp =395, 436}}

Following similar conflicts over modernism, [[Southern Baptist Convention conservative resurgence|the Southern Baptist Convention adhered to conservative theology]] as its official position.<ref>Hefley, James C., ''The Truth in Crisis, Volume 6: The Conservative Resurgence in the Southern Baptist Convention'', Hannibal Books, 2008.
