Their total length is 16,489&nbsp;km (or 28% of all roads), 67% of them are paved.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mnt.ee/failid/MNT_Aastaraamat2013_eng.pdf |title=Annual Report 2013 |publisher=Estonian Road Administration |accessdate=2013-12-19}}</ref> They are divided into 4 classes according to importance:

===Electric vehicle network===

Estonia is the first country in the [[European Union|EU]] and in the world to introduce a nationwide, publicly serviced charging system for charging the [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] of [[electric vehicle]]s.<ref name="autogenerated1">http://elmo.ee/estonia-becomes-the-first-in-the-world-to-open-a-nationwide-ev-fast-charging-network/</ref> The 165 fast charging stations are equipped with connectors of the [[CHAdeMO]] standard. They are located throughout the entire country, including the [[island]]s, and have a maximum distance of 40–60&nbsp;km in between. The charging stations can also be navigated via a [[smartphone]] [[mobile app|app]] (currently only for [[Android (operating system)|Android]]). The relatively dense network and 30 minute quick charges are built to enable a country-wide [[electric vehicle network]]. The system offers a unitary booking service and several different tariffs, some of which appear attractively low priced.<ref>http://elmo.ee/pricing/</ref> The charging station network puts Estonia at the forefront in [[Europe]] even though [[Norway]] actually has a higher penetration of [[electric vehicle]]s. Estonia has a rate of 1 electric vehicle per 1000 capita, whereas [[Norway]] has 4 EVs per 1000 capita.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

==Light rail==
{{see also|Public transport in Tallinn}}
There has been a growing tram network in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]] since 1888, when traffic was started by horse-powered trams. The first line was electrified on October 28, 1925. The first electric trams were built by Dvigatel, Ltd., in Tallinn before [[World War II]] and for some years after that, the last one in 1954. In the 1920s and 1930s gas-powered trams were also used. Since 1955 to 1988 [[Germany|German]]-built trams were used. In total, there were 20 LOWA T54-B54 trams (in use from February 1955 to March 1977), 11 Gotha T57-B57 (in use from January 1958 to June 1978), 5 Gotha T59E-B59E (in use from June 1960 to February 1980), 14 Gotha T2-62 and B2-62 (in use from 1962 to 1981) and 50 Gotha G4 trams (in use from January 1965 to October 1988) trams. The first [[Czechoslovakia]]n-built [[ČKD Tatra]] T4SU arrived in 1973. The T4SU trams were in use from May 1973 to September 2005 and there were 60 of them. The first [[Tatra KT4|KT4SU]] arrived in Tallinn in 1981 and was first in use on March 10, 1981. In 2007, there are 56 KT4SU, 12 [[Tatra KTNF6|KTNF6]] (rebuilt KT4SUs, 10 local, one from [[Gera]] and one from [[Erfurt]]) and 23 KT4D (12 from Gera, 6 from [[Cottbus]], 1 from [[Frankfurt (Oder)]] and 5 from Erfurt) in use. As of 2007, there are four lines: 1 ([[Kopli]]-[[Kadriorg]]), 2 (Kopli-[[Ülemiste (subdistrict)|Ülemiste]]), 3 ([[Tondi, Tallinn|Tondi]]-Kadriorg) and 4 (Tondi-Ülemiste). There have also been lines 5 (Kopli-[[Vana-Lõuna]], shut down in 2004 because of small usage) and 6 (Kopli-Tondi, temporarily used in time of repairs).
