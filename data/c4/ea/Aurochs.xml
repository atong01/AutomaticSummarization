The drinking horn at<space/><link><target>Corpus Christi College, Cambridge</target></link>, given to the college on its foundation in 1352, probably by the college's founders, the Guilds of Corpus Christi and the Blessed Virgin Mary, is thought to come from an aurochs.<extension extension_name='ref'>https://theparkerlibrary.wordpress.com/2012/12/03/corpus-drinking-horn/</extension><space/>Furthermore, there is a painting by<space/><link><target>Willem Kalf</target></link><space/>depicting an aurochs horn.

With immobilized aurochs, a ritual was practised that might be regarded as cruel nowadays: the curly hair on the forehead was cut from the skull of the living animal. Belts were made out of this hair and were believed to increase the fertility of women. When the aurochs was slaughtered, a cross-like bone was extracted from the heart. This bone, which is also present in domestic cattle, contributed to the mystique of the animal and magical powers have been attributed to it.<extension extension_name='ref' name="vVuure05"></extension><link><target>File:Moldavia's coat of Arms of 1481.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part><link><target>Coat of arms of Moldavia</target></link><space/>from 1481</part></link><space/><link><target>File:Enichires.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>16th-century illustration by<space/><link><target>Teodoro Ghisi</target></link>, believed to show an aurochs.
