The following are considerations.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Mass ratios closer to 1</heading><paragraph>One important consideration in defining &quot;double planet&quot; is the ratio of the masses of the two bodies. A mass ratio of 1 would indicate bodies of equal mass, and bodies with mass ratios closer to 1 are more attractive to label as &quot;doubles.&quot; Using this definition, the satellites of Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune can all easily be excluded; they all have masses less than 0.00025 (<template><target>frac</target><arg>4000</arg></template>) of the planets around which they revolve. Some<space/><link><target>dwarf planet</target><trail>s</trail></link>, too, have satellites substantially less massive than the dwarf planets themselves.</paragraph><paragraph>The most notable exception is the PlutoCharon system. The Charon-to-Pluto mass ratio of 0.117 (<space/><template><target>frac</target><arg>9</arg></template>) is close enough to 1 that Pluto and Charon have frequently been described by many scientists as &quot;double dwarf planets&quot; (&quot;double planets&quot; prior to the 2006 definition of &quot;planet&quot;). The<space/><link><target>International Astronomical Union</target></link><space/>(IAU) currently calls Charon a satellite of Pluto, but has explicitly expressed a willingness to reconsider the bodies double dwarf planets at a future time.</paragraph><paragraph>The Moon-to-Earth mass ratio of 0.01230 (<space/><template><target>frac</target><arg>81</arg></template>) is also notably close to 1 when compared to all other satellite-to-planet ratios.

The tug-of-war figure for Saturn's moon<space/><link><target>Titan (moon)</target><part>Titan</part></link><space/>is 380, which means that Saturn's hold on Titan is 380 times as strong as the Sun's hold on Titan. Titan's tug-of-war value may be compared with that of Saturn's moon<space/><link><target>Phoebe (moon)</target><part>Phoebe</part></link>, which has a tug-of-war value of just 3.5. So Saturn's hold on Phoebe is only 3.5 times as strong as the Sun's hold on Phoebe.</paragraph><paragraph>Asimov calculated tug-of-war values for several satellites of the planets. He showed that even the largest gas giant, Jupiter, had only a slightly better hold than the Sun on its outer captured satellites, some with tug-of-war values not much higher than one. In nearly every one of Asimov's calculations the tug-of-war value was found to be greater than one, so in those cases the Sun loses the tug-of-war with the planets. The one exception was Earth's Moon, where the Sun wins the tug-of-war with a value of 0.46, which means that Earth's hold on the Moon is less than half that of the Sun's. Asimov included this with his other arguments that Earth and the Moon should be considered a binary planet.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Asimov"></extension></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>quote</target><arg name="We might look upon the Moon, then, as neither a true satellite of the Earth nor a captured one, but as a planet in its own right, moving about the Sun in careful step with the Earth. From within the Earth–Moon system, the simplest way of picturing the situation is to have the Moon revolve about the Earth; but if you were to draw a picture of the orbits of the Earth and Moon about the Sun exactly to scale, you would see that the Moon's orbit is everywhere concave toward the Sun. It is always "falling toward" the Sun. All the other satellites, without exception, "fall away" from the Sun through part of their orbits, caught as they are by the superior pull of their primary planets{{spaced ndash}}but not the Moon.<ref name">"Asimov"/><ref name</arg><arg><space/>Isaac Asimov</arg></template>See the<space/><link><target>Orbit of the Moon#Path of Earth and Moon around Sun</target><part>Path of Earth and Moon around Sun</part></link><space/>section in the &quot;Orbit of the Moon&quot; article for a more detailed explanation.</paragraph><paragraph>Note that this definition of double planet depends on the pair's distance from the Sun. If the EarthMoon system happened to orbit farther away from the Sun than it does now, then Earth would win the tug of war. For example, at the orbit of Mars, the Moon's tug-of-war value would be 1.05. Also, several tiny moons discovered since Asimov's proposal would qualify as double planets by this argument. Neptune's small outer moons<space/><link><target>Neso (moon)</target><part>Neso</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Psamathe (moon)</target><part>Psamathe</part></link>, for example, have tug-of-war values of 0.42 and 0.44, less than that of Earth's Moon.

Both the Earth-Moon and Pluto-Charon systems formed as a result of<space/><link><target>giant impact hypothesis</target><part>giant impacts</part></link>: one body was impacted by a second body, resulting in a debris disk, and through accretion, either two new bodies formed or one new body formed, with the larger body remaining (but changed). However, a giant impact is not a sufficient condition for two bodies being &quot;double planets&quot; because such impacts can also produce tiny satellites, such as the four, small, outer satellites of Pluto.</paragraph><paragraph>A now-abandoned hypothesis for the<space/><link><target>origin of the Moon</target></link><space/>was actually called the &quot;double-planet hypothesis&quot;; the idea was that the Earth and the Moon formed in the same region of the<space/><link><target>solar system</target></link>'s proto-planetary disk, forming a system under gravitational interaction. This idea, too, is a problematic condition for defining two bodies as &quot;double planets&quot; because planets can &quot;capture&quot; moons through gravitational interaction.
