<!-- Definition and medical uses -->
'''Aspirin''', also known as '''acetylsalicylic acid''' ('''ASA'''), is a [[salicylate]] [[medication]], often used to treat [[analgesic|pain]], fever, and [[inflammation]].<ref name = MD/> Aspirin also has an [[Antiplatelet drug|antiplatelet]] effect by stopping the binding together of [[platelet]]s and preventing a patch over damaged walls of blood vessels. Aspirin is also used long-term, at low doses, to help prevent [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]], [[stroke]]s, and [[thrombus|blood clot]] formation in people at high risk of developing blood clots.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lewis | first1 = H.

<!-- Adverse effects -->
The main [[adverse drug reaction|side effects]] of aspirin are [[gastrointestinal]] [[gastric ulcer|ulcers]], stomach bleeding, and [[tinnitus|ringing in the ears]], especially with higher doses. While daily aspirin can help prevent a clot-related stroke, it may increase risk of a bleeding stroke (hemorrhagic stroke).<ref>{{cite web|title=Daily aspirin therapy: Understand the benefits and risks|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/daily-aspirin-therapy/art-20046797|website=MayoClinic.org|publisher=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=21 March 2015}}</ref> In children and adolescents, aspirin is not recommended for [[flu-like symptoms]] or viral illnesses, because of the risk of [[Reye's syndrome]].<ref name="BMJ2002-Macdonald">{{Cite journal|author=Macdonald S|title=Aspirin use to be banned in under 16-year olds|journal=BMJ|volume=325|issue=7371|pages=988c–988|year=2002|pmid= 12411346 |pmc=1169585|doi=10.1136/bmj.325.7371.988/c}}</ref>

<!-- Mechanism of action -->
Aspirin is part of a group of medications called [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs), but differs from most other NSAIDs in the [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs#Mechanism of action|mechanism of action]]. The salicylates have similar effects (antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic) to the other NSAIDs and inhibit the same enzyme [[cyclooxygenase]] (COX), but aspirin does so in an [[irreversible inhibition|irreversible]] manner and, unlike others, affects the COX-1 variant more than the COX-2 variant of the enzyme.<ref name="Goodman and Gilman's">{{Cite book |last=Burke |first=Anne |last2=Smyth |first2=Emer |last3=FitzGerald |first3=Garret A. |chapter=26: Analgesic Antipyretic and Antiinflammatory Agents |title=[[Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics]] |editor1-first=Laurence L. |editor1-last=Brunton |editor2-first=John S. |editor2-last=Lazo |editor3-first=Keith |editor3-last=Parker |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2006 |edition=11 |isbn=978-0-07-142280-2 |location=New York |pages=671–716}}</ref>

====Headache====
Aspirin, either by itself or in a combined formulation, effectively treats some [[Headache#Classification|types of headache]], but its efficacy may be questionable for others. Secondary headaches, meaning those caused by another disorder or trauma, should be promptly treated by a medical provider.

Among primary headaches, the [[International Classification of Headache Disorders]] distinguishes between [[tension headache]] (the most common), migraine, and [[cluster headache]]. Aspirin or other over-the-counter analgesics are widely recognized as effective for the treatment of tension headache.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Loder|first1=E|author2=Rizzoli, P|title=Tension-type headache|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=12 January 2008 | volume=336 | issue=7635 | pages=88–92 | pmid=18187725 | doi=10.1136/bmj.39412.705868.AD|pmc=2190284}}</ref>
Aspirin, especially as a component of an acetaminophen/aspirin/caffeine formulation, ''e.g.'', [[Excedrin]] Migraine, is considered a first-line therapy in the treatment of migraine, and comparable to lower doses of [[sumatriptan]]. It is most effective at stopping migraines when they are first beginning.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gilmore|first1=B|author2=Michael, M|title=Treatment of acute migraine headache|journal=American family physician|date=1 February 2011|volume=83|issue=3|pages=271–80|pmid=21302868}}</ref>

===Fever===
Like its ability to control pain, aspirin's ability to control [[fever]] is due to its action on the [[prostaglandin]] system through its irreversible inhibition of [[COX]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bartfai|first1=T|author2=Conti, B|title=Fever|journal=TheScientificWorldJournal|date=16 March 2010|volume=10|pages=490–503|doi=10.1100/tsw.2010.50|pmid=20305990|pmc=2850202}}</ref> Although aspirin's use as an [[antipyretic]] in adults is well-established, many medical societies and regulatory agencies (including the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]], the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], and the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA)) strongly advise against using aspirin for treatment of fever in children because of the risk of [[Reye's syndrome]], a rare but often fatal illness associated with the use of aspirin or other salicylates in children during episodes of viral or bacterial infection.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pugliese|first1=A|author2=Beltramo, T; Torre, D|title=Reye's and Reye's-like syndromes|journal=Cell biochemistry and function|date=October 2008|volume=26|issue=7|pages=741–6|pmid=18711704|doi=10.1002/cbf.1465}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Beutler|first1=AI|author2=Chesnut, GT; Mattingly, JC; Jamieson, B|title=FPIN's Clinical Inquiries.

===Swelling and inflammation===
Aspirin is used as an anti-inflammatory agent for both acute and long-term inflammation,<ref>Thea Morris, Melanie Stables, Adrian Hobbs, Patricia de Souza, Paul Colville-Nash, Tim Warner, Justine Newson, Geoffrey Bellingan, and Derek W. Gilroy, [http://www.jimmunol.org/content/183/3/2089.full.pdf "Effects of Low-Dose Aspirin on Acute Inflammatory Responses in Humans"], ''J. Immunology'', 183: 2089-2096, 2009 (accessed Aug 29, 2014)</ref> as well as for treatment of inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis.<ref name=AHFS />

===Heart attacks and strokes===
Aspirin is an important part of treatment of those who have had a [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack).<ref>{{cite journal|title=Myocardial Infarction with ST-Segment Elevation: The Acute Management of Myocardial Infarction with ST-Segment Elevation [Internet].

===Other uses===
Aspirin is a first-line treatment for the fever and joint-pain symptoms of [[rheumatic fever|acute rheumatic fever]]. The therapy often lasts for one to two weeks, and is rarely indicated for longer periods. After fever and pain have subsided, the aspirin is no longer necessary, since it does not decrease the incidence of heart complications and residual rheumatic heart disease.<ref name=NHFA>{{cite web|url=http://www.racgp.org.au/Content/NavigationMenu/ClinicalResources/RACGPGuidelines/DiagnosisandmanagementofacuterheumaticfeverandrheumaticheartdiseaseinAustralia/NHFA-CSANZ_ARF_RHD_2006.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726052030/http://www.racgp.org.au/Content/NavigationMenu/ClinicalResources/RACGPGuidelines/DiagnosisandmanagementofacuterheumaticfeverandrheumaticheartdiseaseinAustralia/NHFA-CSANZ_ARF_RHD_2006.pdf|archivedate=2008-07-26|title=Diagnosis and management of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease in Australia.

[[Image:5 grain aspirin.jpg|thumb|250px|The 5-grain aspirin. The usage guidance label on a bottle of aspirin indicates that the dosage is "325&nbsp;mg (5&nbsp;gr)".]]
Adult aspirin tablets are produced in standardised sizes, which vary slightly from country to country, for example 300&nbsp;mg in Britain and 325&nbsp;mg (or 5 [[Grain (unit)|grains]]) in the United States. Smaller doses are based on these standards, ''e.g.'', 75-mg and 81-mg tablets. The 81-mg (1{{frac|4}}-grain) tablets are commonly called "baby aspirin" or "baby-strength", because they were originally—but no longer—intended to be administered to infants and children.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Invention of the Safety Cap|url = http://digitaldukemed.mc.duke.edu/pcc/safety_cap.html|website = digitaldukemed.mc.duke.edu|accessdate = 2015-09-04}}</ref> No medical significance occurs due to the slight difference in dosage between the 75-mg and the 81-mg tablets.

In addition to enteric coating, "buffering" is the other main method companies have used to try to mitigate the problem of gastrointestinal bleeding. Buffering agents are intended to work by preventing the aspirin from concentrating in the walls of the stomach, although the benefits of buffered aspirin are disputed.

===Reye's syndrome===
{{Main|Reye's syndrome}}
Reye's syndrome, a rare but severe illness characterized by acute [[encephalopathy]] and [[fatty liver]], can occur when children or adolescents are given aspirin for a fever or other illnesses or infections. From 1981 through 1997, 1207 cases of Reye's syndrome in under-18 patients were reported to the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]. Of these, 93% reported being ill in the three weeks preceding onset of Reye's syndrome, most commonly with a [[Respiratory tract infection (disambiguation)|respiratory infection]], [[chickenpox]], or [[diarrhea]]. Salicylates were detectable in 81.9% of children for whom test results were reported.<ref name=Belay>{{Cite journal|author=Belay ED, Bresee JS, Holman RC, Khan AS, Shahriari A, Schonberger LB |title=Reye's syndrome in the United States from 1981 through 1997 |journal=N.

===Hives and swelling===
For a small number of people, taking aspirin can result in symptoms resembling an allergic reaction, including [[hives]], swelling, and headache. The reaction is caused by [[salicylate intolerance]] and is not a true [[allergy]], but rather an inability to metabolize even small amounts of aspirin, resulting in an [[#Overdose|overdose]].

===Other adverse effects===
Aspirin can induce [[angioedema|swelling of skin tissues]] in some people. In one study, angioedema appeared one to six hours after ingesting aspirin in some of the patients. However, when the aspirin was taken alone, it did not cause angioedema in these patients; the aspirin had been taken in combination with another NSAID-induced drug when angioedema appeared.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Berges-Gimeno MP & Stevenson DD |year=2004 |title=Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced reactions and desensitization |journal=J Asthma |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=375–84 |pmid=15281324 |doi=10.1081/JAS-120037650}}</ref>

===Overdose===
{{Main|Aspirin poisoning}}
Aspirin overdose can be acute or chronic. In acute poisoning, a single large dose is taken; in chronic poisoning, higher than normal doses are taken over a period of time.

==Chemical properties==
Aspirin decomposes rapidly in solutions of [[ammonium acetate]] or of the [[acetate]]s, [[carbonate]]s, [[citrate]]s, or [[hydroxide]]s of the [[alkali metals]]. It is stable in dry air, but gradually [[hydrolyses]] in contact with moisture to acetic and salicylic acids.

===Synthesis===
The synthesis of aspirin is classified as an [[ester]]ification reaction. [[Salicylic acid]] is treated with [[acetic anhydride]], an acid derivative, causing a chemical reaction that turns salicylic acid's [[hydroxyl]] group into an [[ester]] group (R-OH → R-OCOCH<sub>3</sub>). This process yields aspirin and [[acetic acid]], which is considered a [[byproduct]] of this reaction. Small amounts of [[sulfuric acid]] (and occasionally [[phosphoric acid]]) are almost always used as a [[catalyst]]. This method is commonly employed in undergraduate teaching labs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Experimental Organic Chemistry |last=Palleros |first=Daniel R. |year=2000 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=New York|isbn=0-471-28250-2 |page=494}}</ref>

===Polymorphism===
[[Polymorphism (materials science)|Polymorphism]], or the ability of a substance to form more than one [[crystal structure]], is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients. Many drugs are receiving regulatory approval for only a single crystal form or polymorph. For a long time, only one crystal structure for aspirin was known.

===Discovery of the mechanism===

===Suppression of prostaglandins and thromboxanes===
Aspirin's ability to suppress the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes is due to its irreversible inactivation of the [[cyclooxygenase]] (COX; officially known as prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase, PTGS) enzyme required for prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis. Aspirin acts as an acetylating agent where an acetyl group is covalently attached to a [[serine]] residue in the active site of the PTGS enzyme. This makes aspirin different from other NSAIDs (such as [[diclofenac]] and [[ibuprofen]]), which are reversible inhibitors.

Low-dose aspirin use irreversibly blocks the formation of [[thromboxane A2|thromboxane A<sub>2</sub>]] in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation during the lifetime of the affected platelet (8–9 days). This antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4456 |title=Aspirin in Heart Attack and Stroke Prevention |accessdate=8 May 2008 |publisher=American Heart Association |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331031146/http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4456 |archivedate=31 March 2008}}</ref> 40&nbsp;mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin I2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Tohgi |first1=H |author2=S Konno, K Tamura, B Kimura and K Kawano|year = 1992|title = Effects of low-to-high doses of aspirin on platelet aggregability and metabolites of thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin|journal = Stroke| volume = 23|pages = 1400–1403 |pmid=1412574|issue = 10| doi=10.1161/01.STR.23.10.1400}}</ref>

Prostaglandins, local [[hormone]]s produced in the body, have diverse effects, including the transmission of pain information to the brain, modulation of the [[hypothalamus|hypothalamic]] thermostat, and inflammation. Thromboxanes are responsible for the aggregation of platelets that form [[clot|blood clots]]. Heart attacks are caused primarily by blood clots, and low doses of aspirin are seen as an effective medical intervention for acute myocardial infarction.

===COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition===
At least two different types of cyclooxygenase occur: COX-1 and COX-2. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and modifies the enzymatic activity of COX-2. COX-2 normally produces prostanoids, most of which are proinflammatory. Aspirin-modified PTGS2 produces lipoxins, most of which are anti-inflammatory.<ref>{{cite journal|

Thus, the protective anticoagulative effect of [[PGI2]] is removed, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems. Since platelets have no DNA, they are unable to synthesize new PTGS once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, an important difference with reversible inhibitors.

===Additional mechanisms===
Aspirin has been shown to have at least three additional modes of action. It uncouples [[oxidative phosphorylation]] in cartilaginous (and hepatic) mitochondria, by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix, where it ionizes once again to release protons.<ref name="SomasundaramS">{{Cite journal|author1=Somasundaram|first2=G|first3=RJ|first4=J|first5=M|first6=IA|first7=S|first8=A|first9=R|issue=5|last2=Sigthorsson|last3=Simpson|last4=Watts|last5=Jacob|last6=Tavares|last7=Rafi|last8=Roseth|last9=Foster |year=2000|title=Uncoupling of intestinal mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and inhibition of cyclooxygenase are required for the development of NSAID-enteropathy in the rat|journal=Aliment Pharmacol Ther|volume=14|pages=639–650|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2036.2000.00723.x|pmid=10792129|last10=Price|last11=Wrigglesworth|last12=Bjarnason|first10=AB|first12=I| displayauthors=9 }}</ref> In short, aspirin buffers and transports the protons. When high doses of aspirin are given, it may actually cause fever, owing to the heat released from the electron transport chain, as opposed to the antipyretic action of aspirin seen with lower doses. In addition, aspirin induces the formation of NO-radicals in the body, which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation. This reduced leukocyte adhesion, which is an important step in immune response to infection; however, evidence is insufficient to show aspirin helps to fight infection.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Mark J. |last=Paul-Clark |first2=Thong van |last2=Cao |first3=Niloufar |last3=Moradi-Bidhendi |first4=Dianne |last4=Cooper |first5=Derek W. |last5=Gilroy |lastauthoramp=yes |title=15-epi-lipoxin A4–mediated Induction of Nitric Oxide Explains How Aspirin Inhibits Acute Inflammation |journal=J.

Aspirin is readily broken down in the body to salicylic acid, which itself has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic effects. In 2012, salicylic acid was found to activate [[AMP-activated protein kinase]], which has been suggested as a possible explanation for some of the effects of both salicylic acid and aspirin.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hawley | first1 = S.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Acetylsalicylic acid is a [[weak acid]], and very little of it is [[Acid dissociation constant|ionized]] in the [[stomach]] after oral administration. Acetylsalicylic acid is quickly absorbed through cell membrane in the [[acidic]] conditions of the stomach. The increased [[pH]] and larger surface area of the [[small intestine]] causes aspirin to be absorbed more slowly there, as more of it is ionised. Owing to the formation of concretions, aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose, and [[blood plasma|plasma]] concentrations can continue to rise for up to 24 hours after ingestion.<ref name="'RK Ferguson'">{{Cite journal|title=Death following self-poisoning with aspirin|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|date=17 August 1970|first1=RK|last1=Ferguson|author2=Boutros, AR|volume=213|issue=7|pages=1186–8|pmid=5468267|doi=10.1001/jama.213.7.1186}}</ref><ref name="'FL Kaufman'">{{Cite journal|title=Darvon poisoning with delayed salicylism: a case report|journal=Pediatrics|date=April 1970|first1=FL|last1=Kaufman|author2=Dubansky, AS|volume=49|issue=4|pages=610–1|pmid=5013423}}</ref><ref name="G Levy">{{Cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM197208312870903|title=Salicylate accumulation kinetics in man |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |date=31 August 1972 |first1=G |last1=Levy |author2=Tsuchiya, T |volume=287 |issue=9 |pages=430–2 |pmid=5044917}}</ref>

About 50–80% of salicylate in the blood is bound to [[albumin|albumin protein]], while the rest remains in the active, ionized state; protein binding is concentration-dependent. Saturation of binding sites leads to more free salicylate and increased toxicity. The volume of distribution is 0.1–0.2 l/kg.

As much as 80% of therapeutic doses of salicylic acid is [[metabolism|metabolized]] in the [[liver]]. Conjugation with [[glycine]] forms [[salicyluric acid]], and with [[glucuronic acid]] to form two different gluconuride esters. The conjugate with the acetyl group intact is referred to as the ''acyl gluconuride''; the deacetylated conjugate is the ''phenolic gluconuride''. These metabolic pathways have only a limited capacity. Small amounts of salicylic acid are also hydroxylated to [[gentisic acid]]. With large salicylate doses, the kinetics switch from first-order to zero-order, as [[metabolic pathway]]s become saturated and [[kidney|renal]] excretion becomes increasingly important.<ref name="G Levy"/>

[[File:Aspirine-1923.jpg|thumb|left|1923 advertisement]]
Plant extracts, including [[willow]] [[bark]] and [[spiraea]], of which salicylic acid was the [[active ingredient|active constituent]], had been known to help alleviate headaches, pains, and fevers since antiquity. The father of modern medicine, [[Hippocrates]] (''circa'' 460 – 377 BC), left historical records describing the use of powder made from the bark and leaves of the willow tree to help these symptoms.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mary Bellis |url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blaspirin.htm |title=History of aspirin |publisher=Inventors.about.com |date=16 June 2010 |accessdate=11 May 2011}}</ref>

In 1763, Edward Stone, at Oxford, isolated the active ingredient of aspirin in his discovery of salicylic acid. A French chemist, [[Charles Frederic Gerhardt]], was the first to prepare acetylsalicylic acid in 1853. In the course of his work on the synthesis and properties of various [[acid anhydride]]s, he mixed [[acetyl chloride]] with a [[sodium]] salt of salicylic acid ([[sodium salicylate]]). A vigorous reaction ensued, and the resulting melt soon solidified.<ref name=gerhardt>{{Cite journal|author=Gerhardt, Ch.|title=Untersuchungen über die wasserfreien organischen Säuren |trans_title=Investigations into anhydrous organic acids|journal=Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie|volume=87|pages=149–179|year=1853 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wus2AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA149#v=onepage&q&f=false|doi=10.1002/jlac.18530870107|language=de}}  See especially pages 162-163.</ref> Since no [[structural theory]] existed at that time, Gerhardt called the compound he obtained "salicylic-acetic anhydride" (''wasserfreie Salicylsäure-Essigsäure''). This preparation of aspirin ("salicylic-acetic anhydride") was one of the many reactions Gerhardt conducted for his paper on anhydrides and he did not pursue it further.

United Drug Co. |vol=272 |reporter=F. |opinion=505 |pinpoint=p.512 |court=S.D.N.Y |date=1921 |url=https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/domain/tmcases/bayer.htm |accessdate=2015-09-01 |quote=Disregarding this, however, it was too late in the autumn of 1915 to reclaim the word which had already passed into the public domain. If the consuming public had once learned to know 'Aspirin' as the accepted name for the drug, perhaps it is true that an extended course of education might have added to it some proprietary meaning, but it would be very difficult to prove that it had been done in 17 months, and in any case the plaintiff does not try to prove it. [...] Yet, had it not been indifferent to the results of selling to the consumer, it could have protected itself just as well at the time when consumers began to buy directly as in 1915. Nothing would have been easier than to insist that the tablet makers should market the drug in small tin boxes bearing the plaintiff's name, or to take over the sale just as it did later. Instead of this, they allowed the manufacturing chemists to build up this part of the demand without regard to the trade-mark. Having made that bed, they must be content to lie in it. Hence it appears to me that nothing happening between October, 1915, and March, 1917, will serve to turn the word into a trade-mark.}}</ref> Today, aspirin is a generic word in Australia, France, India, Ireland, New Zealand, Pakistan, Jamaica, Colombia, the Philippines, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Scientific Style and Format: The CBE Manual for Authors, Editors, and Publishers|author = CBE Style Manual Committee; Huth, Edward J.|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1994|page = 164|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PoFJ-OhE63UC&pg=PA164|isbn = 978-0-521-47154-1}}</ref>

==Veterinary use==
Aspirin is sometimes used for pain relief or as an anticoagulant in veterinary medicine, primarily in dogs and sometimes horses, although newer medications with fewer side effects are generally used instead.

Both dogs and horses are susceptible to the gastrointestinal side effects associated with salicylates, but it is a convenient treatment for arthritis in older dogs, and has shown some promise in cases of [[laminitis]] in horses.<ref>{{cite web|last = Crosby|first = Janet Tobiassen|title = Veterinary Questions and Answers|publisher = About.com|year = 2006|url = http://vetmedicine.about.com/cs/altvetmedgeneral/a/dogcataspirin.htm|accessdate =5 September 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070908151020/http://vetmedicine.about.com/cs/altvetmedgeneral/a/dogcataspirin.htm| archivedate= 8 September 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name="CambridgeH">{{Cite journal|author=Cambridge H, Lees P, Hooke RE, Russell CS|title=Antithrombotic actions of aspirin in the horse |journal=Equine Vet J |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=123–7 |year=1991 |pmid=1904347|doi=10.1111/j.2042-3306.1991.tb02736.x|last2=Lees |last3=Hooke |last4=Russell }}</ref> It is no longer commonly used for cases of laminitis, as it could be counterproductive for treatment.
Aspirin should be used in animals only under the direct supervision of a [[veterinarian]]; in particular, cats lack the [[glucuronide]] conjugates that aid in the excretion of aspirin, making it potentially toxic.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Lappin, Michael R.|title=Feline internal medicine secrets|year=2001|publisher=Hanley & Belfus|location=Philadelphia|isbn=1-56053-461-3|page=160}}</ref> No clinical signs of toxicosis occurred when cats were given 25&nbsp;mg/kg of aspirin every 48 hours for 4 weeks.<ref>http://www.merckmanuals.com/vet/toxicology/toxicities_from_human_drugs/analgesics_toxicity.html</ref>
