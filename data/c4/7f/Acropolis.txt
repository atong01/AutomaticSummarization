An '''acropolis''' ({{lang-grc-gre|ἀκρόπολις}}; from ''akros'' or ''akron'', "highest", "topmost", "outermost" and ''polis'', "city"; plural in English: ''acropoles'', ''acropoleis'' or ''acropolises'')<ref>{{OEtymD|acropolis}}</ref><ref>{{LSJ|a)kro/polis|acropolis}}, {{LSJ|a)/kros|akros}},  {{LSJ|a)/kron|akron|ref}}.</ref> is a [[Human settlement|settlement]], especially a [[citadel]], built upon an area of elevated ground&mdash;frequently a hill with [[precipice|precipitous]] sides, chosen for purposes of defense. In many parts of the world, acropoleis became the nuclei of large cities of [[classical antiquity]], such as [[ancient Rome]], and for this reason they are sometimes prominent landmarks in modern cities with ancient pasts, such as modern [[Rome]]. 

The word ''acropolis'' literally means in Greek "upper city," and though associated primarily with the [[Greece|Greek]] cities [[Athens]], [[Argos]] ( with [[Larissa (Argos)|Larissa]]), [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] (with [[Cadmea]]), and [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] (with its [[Acrocorinth]]), may be applied generically to all such citadels, including Rome, [[Jerusalem]], Celtic [[Bratislava]], many in [[Asia Minor]], or even [[Castle Rock, Edinburgh|Castle Rock]] in [[Edinburgh]]. An example in Ireland is the [[Rock of Cashel]]. Acropolis is also the term used by archaeologists and historians for the urban [[Castro culture]] settlements located in Northwestern Iberian hilltops.

The most famous example is the [[Acropolis of Athens]],<ref>[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/404 World Heritage: Acropolis, Athens ]</ref> which, by reason of its historical associations and the several famous buildings erected upon it (most notably the [[Parthenon]]), is known without qualification as ''the Acropolis''.  Although originating in the mainland of Greece, use of the acropolis model quickly spread to Greek colonies such as the [[Dorians|Dorian]] [[Lato]] on [[Crete]] during the [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic Period]].

Because of its classical [[Hellenistic]] style, the ruins of [[Mission San Juan Capistrano|Mission San Juan Capistrano's]] Great Stone Church in [[California|California, United States]] has been called the "American Acropolis".{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Other parts of the world developed other names for the high citadel or [[alcázar]], which often reinforced a naturally strong site. In Central [[Italy]], many small rural [[comune|communes]] still cluster at the base of a fortified habitation known as ''La Rocca'' of the commune.

The term ''acropolis'' is also used to describe the central complex of overlapping structures, such as plazas and pyramids, in many [[Maya city|Maya cities]], including [[Tikal]] and [[Copán]].

The [[Philopappos Monument]] stands where, in the distant background, the coast of [[Peloponnese]] meet the waters of the [[Saronic Gulf]].]]<!-- Please note, the Parthenon is not an acropolis, but rather sits upon one -->
