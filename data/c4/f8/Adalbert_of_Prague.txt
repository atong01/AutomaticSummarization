==Life==

===Early Years===
Adalbert, named ''Vojtěch'' at birth, was born into a noble Czech family, to Prince [[Slavník]] and his wife [[Střezislava]] in [[Libice nad Cidlinou]], [[Bohemia]]. His father was the rich and independent ruler of the [[Zlicans|Zličan]] principality that rivaled [[Prague]] (see [[Slavník's dynasty]]). Adalbert had five natural brothers: [[Soběslav (d. 1004)|Soběslav]] (Slavnik's heir; died 1004), Spytimír, Pobraslav, Pořej, and Čáslav, and a half-brother named Radim of his father's liaison with another woman. Radim chose a clerical career as did Adalbert, and took the name Gaudentius. Having survived a grave illness in childhood, his parents decided to dedicate Vojtěch to the service of God.<ref name=cna>[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/saint.php?n=685 "St. Adalbert of Prague", Catholic News Agency]</ref> Adalbert was well educated, having studied for approximately ten years (970-80) in [[Magdeburg]] under the tutelage of [[Adalbert of Magdeburg|St. Adalbert of Magdeburg]].<ref name=Foley>[http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/Saint.aspx?id=1910, Leonard Foley, OFM, "St. Adalbert of Prague", ''Saint of the Day, Lives, Lessons and Feast'', revised by Pat McCloskey, OFM, Franciscan Media]</ref> The young Vojtěch took his tutor's name "Adalbert" at his [[Confirmation]].

===Episcopacy===
[[File:Socha Svateho Vojtecha a Radima.jpg|thumb|left|upright|210px|Monument to St. Adalbert and his brother Gaudentius, [[Libice nad Cidlinou]], [[Czech Republic]].]]
In 981 [[Adalbert of Magdeburg|St. Adalbert of Magdeburg]] died, and his young protege Adalbert returned to [[Bohemia]]. Later Bishop [[Dětmar|Dietmar of Prague]] ordained him a [[Roman Catholic]] [[priest]]. In 982, Bishop Dietmar died, and Adalbert, despite being under canonical age, was chosen to succeed him as [[Bishop of Prague]].<ref name=Foley/> Amiable and somewhat worldly, he was not expected to trouble the secular powers by making excessive claims for the Church.<ref name=Butler>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZHnM1a1NTugC&pg=PA181&dq=Saint+Adalbert+of+Prague&hl=en&sa=X&ei=OfISVeaDIsv1gwS114OgCw&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Saint%20Adalbert%20of%20Prague&f=false Butler, Alban. "St. Adalbert of Prague", ''Butler's Lives of the Saints'', Liturgical Press, 2003, ISBN 9780814629031]</ref> Although Adalbert was from a wealthy family, he avoided comfort and luxury, and was noted for his charity and austerity. After six years of prayer and preaching, he had made little headway in evangelizing the Bohemians, who maintained deeply embedded pagan beliefs.

Adalbert opposed the participation of Christians in the [[slavery|slave]] trade and complained of [[polygamy]] and idolatry, which were common among the people. Once he started to propose reforms he was met with opposition from both the secular powers and the clergy. His family refused to support Duke [[Boleslaus II, Duke of Bohemia|Boleslaus]] in an unsuccessful war against Poland. Adalbert was no longer welcome and eventually forced into exile.<ref name=Foley/> In 990 he went to [[Rome]].  He lived as a hermit at the Benedictine [[Santi Bonifacio e Alessio|monastery of Saint Alexis]]. Five years later, Boleslaus requested that the [[Pope]] send Adalbert back to Prague, in hopes of securing his family's support. [[Pope John XV]] agreed, with the understanding that Adalbert was free to leave Prague if he continued to encounter entrenched resistance.<ref name=cna/> Adalbert returned as bishop of Prague, where he was initially received with demonstrations of apparent joy.<ref name=Campbell>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01127c.htm Thomas Campbell, "St. Adalbert", ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', Volume 1 (New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907), accessed 7 December 2014.]</ref> and founded a [[Brevnov Monastery|monastery in Břevnov]] near the City, it being the first monastery in the Czech territory.

In 995, the [[Slavniks]]' former rivalry with the Přemyslids, who were allied with the powerful Bohemian clan of the [[Vršovci]]s, resulted in the storming of the Slavnik town of [[Libice nad Cidlinou]], led by the Přemyslid [[Boleslaus II the Pious]]. During the struggle four or five of Adalbert's brothers were killed. The Zličan principality became part of the Přemyslids' estate. Adalbert unsuccessfully attempted to protect a noblewoman caught in adultery. She had fled to a convent, where she was killed. In upholding the right of sanctuary, Bishop Adalbert responded by excommunicating the murderers.<ref name=cna/> Butler suggests that the incident was orchestrated by enemies of his family.<ref name=Butler/>

After this, Adalbert could not safely stay in Bohemia and escaped from Prague. Strachkvas was eventually appointed to be his successor. However, Strachkvas suddenly died during the liturgy at which he was to accede to his episcopal office in Prague. The cause of his death are still ambiguous. The Pope directed Adalbert to resume his see, but believing that he would not be allowed back, he requested a brief as an itinerant missionary.<ref name=Butler/>

Adalbert then traveled to [[Hungary]] and probably baptized [[Géza, Grand Prince of the Hungarians|Géza of Hungary]] and his son [[Stephen of Hungary|Stephen]] in [[Esztergom]]. Then he went to [[Poland]] where he was cordially welcomed by [[Boleslaus I of Poland|then-Duke Boleslaus I]] and installed as Bishop of [[Gniezno]].<ref name=Campbell/>

===Mission and Martyrdom in Prussia===
[[File:Adalb.jpg|thumb|The execution of St. Adalbert by the pagan [[Old Prussians|Prussians]], [[Gniezno Doors]] panel]]

Adalbert again relinquished his diocese, namely that of [[Gniezno]], and set out as a missionary to preach to the inhabitants near [[Prussia (Baltic)|Prussia]]. <ref>[http://saints.sqpn.com/book-of-saints-adalbert Monks of Ramsgate. “Adalbert”, ''Book of Saints'' (1921)]</ref>  [[Boleslaus I of Poland|Bolesław I]], Duke (and, later, King) of Poland, sent [[soldiers]] with Adalbert on his mission to the Prussians. The Bishop and his companions, including his half-brother Radim (Gaudentius), entered Prussian territory and traveled along the coast of the [[Baltic Sea]] to [[Gdańsk]].

Success attended his efforts at first, but his imperious manner in commanding the people to abandon paganism irritated them, and at the instigation of one of the pagan priests he was murdered on 23 April 997<ref name=Campbell/> on the Baltic Sea coast east of [[Truso]] (currently the city of [[Elbląg]]) or near Tenkitten and [[Fischhausen]]. It is recorded that his body was bought back for its weight in [[gold]] by King [[Boleslaus I of Poland]].

==Veneration and Relics==
[[File:Relikwiarz Swietego Wojciecha.JPG|thumb|upright|Silver coffin of St. Adalbert, Cathedral in [[Gniezno]]]]
A few years after his martyrdom, Adalbert was [[canonization|canonized]] as '''St. Adalbert of Prague.''' His life was written in ''Vita Sancti Adalberti Pragensis'' by various authors, the earliest being traced to imperial [[Aachen]] and the Bishop of [[Liège (city)|Liège]], [[Notger von Lüttich]], although it was previously assumed that the [[Rome|Roman]] monk [[John Canaparius]] wrote the first ''Vita'' in 999. Another famous biographer of St. Adalbert was [[Bruno of Querfurt|St. Bruno of Querfurt]] who wrote a hagiography of him in 1001-4.

Notably, the Přemyslid rulers of Bohemia initially refused to ransom St. Adalbert's body from the Prussians who murdered him, and therefore it was purchased by Poles. This fact may be explained by the Saint belonging to the Slavniks family which was rival to the Přemyslids. Thus St. Adalbert's bones were preserved in [[Gniezno]], which assisted [[Boleslaus I of Poland]] in increasing Polish political and diplomatic power in Europe.

According to Bohemian accounts, in 1039 the Bohemian Duke [[Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Břetislav I]] looted the bones of St. Adalbert from [[Gniezno]] in a raid and translated them to [[Prague]]. According to Polish accounts, however, he stole the wrong relics, namely those of [[St. Gaudentius]], while the Poles concealed St. Adalbert's relics, and consequently remain in [[Gniezno]]. In 1127 his severed head, which was not in the original purchase according to ''Roczniki Polskie'', was discovered and translated to [[Gniezno]]. In 1928, one of the arms of St. Adalbert, which Bolesław I had given to [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Otto III]] in 1000, was added to the bones preserved in Gniezno. Therefore, today St. Adalbert has two elaborate shrines in the [[Prague Cathedral]] and [[Gniezno Cathedral|Royal Cathedral of Gniezno]], each of which claims to possess his relics, but which of their bones are his authentic relics is unknown. For example, pursuant to both claims the Saint has two skulls. The one in Gniezno was stolen in 1923.

The massive bronze [[Gniezno Doors|doors]] of [[Gniezno Cathedral]], dating from around 1175, are decorated with eighteen [[relief]]s of scenes from the Saint's life. They are the only [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] ecclesiastical doors in Europe depicting a cycle illustrating the life of a saint and therefore are a precious relic documenting Adalbert's martyrdom. 

23 April 1997 was the one thousandth anniversary of St. Adalbert's martyrdom. It was commemorated in [[Poland]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]], [[Russia]], and other nations. Representatives of [[Roman Catholic]], [[Greek Orthodox]], and Evangelical churches traveled on a pilgrimage to the Saint's tomb located in Gniezno. [[John Paul II|Pope St. John Paul II]] visited the cathedral and celebrated a liturgy there in which heads of seven European nations and approximately one million faithful participated.

A ten-meter cross was erected near the village of Beregovoe (formerly Tenkitten), [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] where St. Adalbert is thought to have been martyred by the Prussians.
