'''Errol Mark Morris''' (born February 5, 1948) is an American [[film director]].  In 2003, his film ''[[The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara]]'' won the [[76th Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Documentary Feature|Best Documentary Feature]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Morris was born on February 5, 1948, and raised in a Jewish family in [[Hewlett, New York|Hewlett]], [[New York]].<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]|date=September 21, 2012|title=Into Wilderness of Errol|first=Laurie Gwen|last=Shapiro|url=http://blogs.forward.com/the-arty-semite/163179/into-wilderness-of-errol/}}</ref>

After being treated for [[strabismus]] in childhood, he refused to wear an eye patch.  As a consequence, he has limited sight in one eye and lacks normal stereoscopic vision.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/04/books/review/believing-is-seeing-by-errol-morris-book-review.html?scp=1&sq=limited%20vision&st=cse</ref>

In the 10th grade, Morris attended [[The Putney School]], a boarding school in Vermont. He began playing the cello, spending a summer in [[France]] studying music under the acclaimed [[Nadia Boulanger]], who also taught Morris' future collaborator [[Philip Glass]]. Describing Morris as a teenager, Mark Singer wrote that he "read with a passion the forty-odd [[List of Oz books|''Oz'' books]], watched a lot of television, and on a regular basis went with a doting but not quite right maiden aunt ('I guess you'd have to say that Aunt Roz was somewhat demented') to Saturday matinées, where he saw such films as ''[[This Island Earth]]'' and ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'' &mdash; horror movies that, viewed again 30 years later, still seem scary to him."<ref name="singer1">{{cite journal|title=Predilections|last=Singer|first=Mark|journal=[[The New Yorker]]|date=February 2, 1989|url=http://www.errolmorris.com/content/profile/singer_predilections.html}}</ref>

Morris attended the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]].  Morris graduated in 1969 with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in history. For a brief time Morris held small jobs, first as a cable television salesman and then as a term-paper writer. His unorthodox approach to applying for grad school included "trying to get accepted at different graduate schools just by showing up on their doorstep."<ref name="singer1"/> Having unsuccessfully approached both the [[University of Oxford]] and [[Harvard University]], Morris was able to talk his way into [[Princeton University]], where he began studying the history of science, a topic in which he had "absolutely no background." His concentration was in the history of physics, and he was bored and unsuccessful in the prerequisite physics classes he had to take. This, together with his antagonistic relationship with his advisor [[Thomas Kuhn]] ('You won't even look through my telescope.' And his response was 'Errol, it's not a telescope, it's a kaleidoscope.')<ref name="singer1"/> ensured that his stay at Princeton would be short.

Morris left Princeton in 1972, enrolling at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] as a Ph.D. student in [[philosophy]]. At Berkeley, he once again found that he was not well-suited to his subject. "Berkeley was just a world of [[pedant]]s. It was truly shocking. I spent two or three years in the philosophy program. I have very bad feelings about it," he later said.<ref name="singer1"/> He became a regular at the [[Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive|Pacific Film Archive]]. As Tom Luddy, the director of the archive at the time, later remembered: "He was a [[film noir]] nut. He claimed we weren't showing the real film noir. So I challenged him to write the program notes. Then, there was his habit of sneaking into the films and denying that he was sneaking in. I told him if he was sneaking in he should at least admit he was doing it."<ref name="singer1"/>

===Unfinished project on Ed Gein===
Inspired by [[Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', Morris visited [[Plainfield, Wisconsin]] in 1975. While in Wisconsin, he conducted multiple interviews with [[Ed Gein]], the infamous [[serial killer]] who was a resident at Mendota State Hospital in Madison. He later made plans with German film director [[Werner Herzog]], whom Tom Luddy had introduced to Morris, to return in the summer of 1975 to secretly open the grave of Gein's mother to test their theory that Gein himself had already dug her up. Herzog arrived on schedule, but Morris had second thoughts and was not there. Herzog did not open the grave. Morris later returned to Plainfield, this time staying for almost a year, conducting hundreds of hours of interviews. Although he had plans to either write a book or make a film (which he would call ''Digging up the Past''), Morris never completed his Ed Gein project.

In the fall of 1976, Herzog visited Plainfield again, this time to shoot part of his film ''[[Stroszek]]''. After the shooting finished, Herzog handed Morris an envelope with cash in it. Morris walked over to the motel window and tossed the envelope out the window into a parking lot. Herzog went out to the parking lot and brought the money back, again offering it to Morris, saying, "Please don't do that again."<ref name="singer1"/>

===First films===
Morris accepted the $2,000 and used it to take a trip to [[Vernon, Florida]]. Vernon was nicknamed "Nub City" because its residents participated in a particularly gruesome form of insurance fraud in which they deliberately amputated a limb in order to collect the insurance money. Morris's second documentary would be about the town and bear its name, although it makes no mention of Vernon as "Nub City", but instead explores other idiosyncrasies of the town's residents. Morris made this omission because he received death threats while doing research; the town's residents were afraid that Morris would reveal their secret.

After spending two weeks in Vernon, Morris returned to Berkeley and began working on a script for a work of fiction that he called ''Nub City''. After a few unproductive months, he happened to read a headline in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' that read, "450 DEAD PETS GOING TO NAPA VALLEY". Morris left for Napa Valley and began working on the film that would become his first feature, ''[[Gates of Heaven]]''. In 1978, when the film premiered, Werner Herzog cooked and publicly ate his shoe, an event later incorporated into a [[Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe|short documentary]] by [[Les Blank]]. Herzog had promised to eat his shoe if Morris completed the project, to challenge and encourage Morris, whom Herzog perceived as incapable of following up on the projects he conceived. At the public shoe-eating, Herzog suggested that he hoped the act would serve to encourage anyone having difficulty bringing a project to fruition.

''Gates of Heaven'' was given a limited release in the spring of 1981. Critic [[Roger Ebert]] was and remained a champion of the film, including it on his all-time top ten best films list. Morris returned to Vernon in 1979 and again in 1980, renting a house in town and conducting interviews with the town's citizens. ''[[Vernon, Florida (film)|Vernon, Florida]]'' premiered at the 1981 [[New York Film Festival]]. ''[[Newsweek]]'' called it, "a film as odd and mysterious as its subjects, and quite unforgettable." The film, like ''Gates of Heaven'', suffered from poor distribution. It was released on video in 1987, and DVD in 2005.

After finishing ''Vernon, Florida'', Morris tried unsuccessfully to get funding for a variety of projects. There was ''Road'', a story about an interstate highway in Minnesota; a project about Robert Golka, the creator of laser-induced fireballs in Utah; and the story of [[Centralia, Pennsylvania]], the coal town in which an inextinguishable subterranean fire ignited in 1962. He eventually got funding in 1983 to write a script about John and Jim Pardue, a pair of [[Missouri]] bank robbers who had killed their father and grandmother and robbed five banks. Morris's pitch went, "The great bank-robbery sprees always take place at a time when something is going wrong in the country. [[Bonnie and Clyde]] were apolitical, but it's impossible to imagine them without [[the Depression]] as a back-drop. The Pardue brothers were apolitical, but it's impossible to imagine them without [[Vietnam]]."<ref name="singer1"/> Morris wanted [[Tom Waits]] and [[Mickey Rourke]] to play the brothers, and he wrote the script, but the project eventually failed. Morris worked on writing scripts for various other projects, including a pair of ill-fated [[Stephen King]] adaptations.

In 1984, Morris married Julia Sheehan, whom he had met in Wisconsin while researching Ed Gein and other serial killers. He would later recall an early conversation with Julia: "I was talking to a mass murderer but I was thinking of you," he said, and instantly regretted it, afraid that it might not have sounded as affectionate as he had wished. But Julia was actually flattered: "I thought, really, that was one of the nicest things anyone ever said to me. It was hard to go out with other guys after that."<ref name="singer1"/>

===''The Thin Blue Line''===
In 1985, Morris became interested in Dr. [[James Grigson]], a psychiatrist in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]]. Under [[Texas]] law, the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] can only be issued if the jury is convinced that the defendant is not only guilty, but will commit further violent crimes in the future if he is not put to death. Grigson had spent 15 years testifying for such cases, and he almost invariably gave the same damning testimony, often saying that it is "one hundred per cent certain" that the defendant would kill again.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/DM/lib00375,103386EA575FCA6A.html | title=Expert psychiatric witness was nicknamed Dr. Death | publisher=''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' |date=June 14, 2004 | first= Pat| last= Gillespie| accessdate =2009-03-21}}</ref> This led to Grigson being nicknamed "Dr. Death".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.ccadp.org/DrDeath.htm | title=Groups Expel Psychiatrist Known for Murder Cases; Witness nicknamed 'Dr. Death' says license won't be affected by allegations  | publisher=''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' |date=July 26, 1995 | first= | last= | accessdate =2009-03-21}}</ref> Through Grigson, Morris would meet the subject of his next film, 36-year-old [[Randall Dale Adams]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/ST/lib00154,101B1DBE87233DDC.html | title=Study: State relies too much on 'killer shrinks' | publisher=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]] |date=March 31, 2004| first= | last= | accessdate =2008-03-11}}</ref>

Adams was serving a life sentence that had been commuted from a death sentence on a legal technicality for the 1976 murder of Robert Wood, a Dallas police officer. Adams told Morris that he had been framed, and that David Harris, who was present at the time of the murder and was the principal witness for the prosecution, had in fact killed Wood. Morris began researching the case because it related to Dr. Grigson. He was at first unconvinced of Adams's innocence. After reading the transcripts of the trial and meeting David Harris at a bar, however, Morris was no longer so sure.

At the time, Morris had been making a living as a [[private investigator]] for a well-known private detective agency that specialized in Wall Street cases. Bringing together his talents as an investigator and his obsessions with murder, narration, and epistemology, Morris went to work on the case in earnest. Unedited interviews in which the prosecution's witnesses systematically contradicted themselves were used as testimony in Adams's 1986 ''[[habeas corpus]]'' hearing to determine if he would receive a new trial. David Harris famously confessed, in a roundabout manner, to killing Wood.

Although Adams was finally found innocent after years of being processed by the legal system, the judge in the ''habeas corpus'' hearing officially stated that, "much could be said about those videotape interviews, but nothing that would have any bearing on the matter before this court." Regardless, ''[[The Thin Blue Line (1988 film)|The Thin Blue Line]]'', as Morris's film would be called, was popularly accepted as the main force behind getting its subject, Randall Adams, out of prison. As Morris said of the film, "''The Thin Blue Line'' is two movies grafted together. On one simple level is the question, Did he do it, or didn’t he? And on another level, ''The Thin Blue Line'', properly considered, is an [[Essay#Film|essay]] on false history. A whole group of people, literally everyone, believed a version of the world that was entirely wrong, and my accidental investigation of the story provided a different version of what happened."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bombsite.com/issues/69/articles/2258|title=BOMB Magazine — Errol Morris by Margot Livesey|publisher=}}</ref>

According to a survey by ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''The Thin Blue Line'' made dozens of critics' top ten lists for 1988, more than any other film that year. It won the documentary of the year award from both the [[New York Film Critics Circle]] and the [[National Society of Film Critics]]. Despite its widespread acclaim, it was not nominated for an Oscar, which created a small scandal regarding the nomination practices of the Academy. The Academy cited the film's genre of "non-fiction", arguing that it was not actually a documentary. To this day, ''The Thin Blue Line'' is one of the most critically acclaimed documentaries ever made.

===Commercials===
Although Morris has achieved fame as a documentary filmmaker, he is also an accomplished director of [[television commercial]]s. In 2002, Morris directed a series of television ads for [[Apple Computer]] as part of a popular "Switch" campaign. The commercials featured ex-[[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] users discussing their various bad experiences that motivated their own personal switches to Macintosh. One commercial in the series, starring [[Ellen Feiss]], a high-schooler friend of his son [[Hamilton Morris]], became an Internet meme. Morris has directed hundreds of commercials for various companies and products, including [[Adidas]], [[American International Group|AIG]], [[Cisco Systems]], [[Citibank]], [[Kimberly-Clark]]'s [[Depend (undergarment)|Depend brand]], [[Levi's]], [[Miller High Life]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[PBS]], [[The Quaker Oats Company]], [[Southern Comfort]], [[EA Sports]], [[Toyota]] and [[Volkswagen]]. Many of these commercials are available on his website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.errolmorris.com/commercials.html|title=Errol Morris: Commercials|publisher=}}</ref>

In 2002, Morris was commissioned to make a short film<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.errolmorris.com/content/shortfilms/oscarmovie.html|title=Errol Morris: Short Films|publisher=}}</ref> for the [[75th Academy Awards]]. He was hired based on his advertising resume, not his career as a director of feature-length documentaries. Those interviewed ranged from [[Laura Bush]] to [[Iggy Pop]] to [[Kenneth Arrow]] to Morris's 15-year-old son Hamilton. Morris was nominated for an [[Emmy]] for this short film. He considered editing this footage into a feature-length film, focusing<ref>http://www.errolmorris.com/content/aborted/projects_donald.htmlspecifically</ref> on [[Donald Trump]] discussing ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (This segment was later released on the second issue of ''[[Wholphin (DVD)|Wholphin]]''). Morris went on to make a second short for the [[79th Academy Awards]] in 2007, this time interviewing the various nominees and asking them about their Oscar experiences.

In 2003, Morris won the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Oscar for Best Documentary]] for ''[[The Fog of War]]'', a film about the career of [[Robert S. McNamara]], the [[Secretary of Defense]] during the [[Vietnam War]] under Presidents [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. In the hauntingly re-enacted opening about McNamara relationship with U.S. General [[Curtis LeMay]] during World War II, Morris brings out complexities in the character of McNamara, which shaped McNamara's positions in the [[Cuban missile crisis]] and the Vietnam War. Like his earlier documentary, ''The Thin Blue Line,'' ''The Fog of War'' included extensive use of re-enactments, a technique which many had believed was inappropriate for documentaries.

In July 2004, Morris directed another series of commercials in the style of the "Switch" ads. This campaign featured [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] who voted for [[George W. Bush|Bush]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 election]] giving their personal reasons for voting for [[John Kerry|Kerry]] in 2004. Upon completing more than 50 commercials, Morris had difficulty getting them on the air. Eventually, the liberal advocacy group [[MoveOn]] [[Political action committee|PAC]] paid to air a few of the commercials. Morris also wrote an editorial<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.errolmorris.com/content/editorial/nytimes105.html|title=Errol Morris: Editorial|publisher=}}</ref> for ''[[the New York Times]]'' discussing the commercials and Kerry's losing campaign.

In late 2004, Morris directed a series of noteworthy commercials for [[Sharp Electronics]]. The commercials enigmatically depicted various scenes from what appeared to be a short narrative that climaxed with a car crashing into a swimming pool. Each commercial showed a slightly different perspective on the events, and each ended with a cryptic weblink. The weblink was to a fake webpage advertising a prize offered to anyone who could discover the secret location of some valuable urns. It was in fact an [[alternate reality game]]. The original commercials can be found on Morris's website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.errolmorris.com/commercials/sharp.html|title=Errol Morris: Commercials|publisher=}}</ref>

Morris directed a series of commercials for [[Reebok]] that featured six prominent National Football League (NFL) players. The 30-second promotional videos were aired during the 2006 NFL season.<ref>{{cite news|title=Football Calls, and Reebok Responds|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/24/business/media/24adco.html?_r=0|accessdate=28 September 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=24 July 2006|author=Jane Levere}}</ref>

In 2013, Morris stated that he has made around 1,000 commercials during his career.<ref name="Fast">{{cite web|title=The controversial case of Dr. Jeffrey MacDonald|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yd7ltZIqFs|work=YouTube|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=28 September 2013|author=FastTheLatestNews|format=Video upload|date=12 July 2013}}</ref>

===2010–present===
In early 2010, a new Morris documentary was submitted to several film festivals, including [[Toronto International Film Festival]], [[Cannes Film Festival]], and [[Telluride Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arts.nationalpost.com/2010/08/04/bruce-springsteen-errol-morris-and-werner-herzog-in-3-d-as-tiff-unveils-2010-docs/|title=TIFF unveils 2010 docs: Bruce Springsteen, Errol Morris and Werner Herzog in 3D|date=4 August 2010|work=National Post}}</ref> The film, titled ''[[Tabloid (film)|Tabloid]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collider.com/2010/03/30/new-details-on-errol-morris-next-documentary-tabloid/|title=New Details on Errol Morris' Next Documentary, TABLOID|work=Collider}}</ref> features interviews with [[Joyce McKinney]], a former [[Miss Wyoming]], who was convicted ''in absentia'' for the kidnap and indecent assault of a [[Mormon sex in chains case|Mormon missionary]] in England during 1977.

Morris has also written long-form journalism, exploring different areas of interest and published on the ''[[New York Times]]'' website.<ref>http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/category/errol-morris/</ref> A collection of these essays, entitled ''Believing is Seeing: Observations on the Mysteries of Photography,'' was published by Penguin Press on September 1, 2011. In November 2011, Morris premiered a documentary short entitled "The Umbrella Man"—featuring [[Josiah Thompson|Josiah "Tink" Thompson]]—about the Kennedy assassination on the ''The New York Times'' website.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Umbrella Man|url=http://www.nytimes.com/video/2011/11/21/opinion/100000001183275/the-umbrella-man.html|accessdate=28 September 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=21 November 2011|author=Errol Morris}}</ref>

In 2012, Morris published his second book, ''[[A Wilderness of Error: The Trials of Jeffrey MacDonald]]'', about [[Jeffrey MacDonald]], the [[Green Berets|Green Beret]] physician convicted of killing his wife and two daughters on February 17, 1970. Morris first became interested in the case in the early 1990s and believes that MacDonald is not guilty after undertaking extensive research.<ref>{{cite news|title=A Jury Said Jeffrey MacDonald Killed His Wife and Kids. So Did '60 Minutes' and a Bestseller. 40 Years Later, Errol Morris Counters With 500 Pages of Awkward Questions.|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jesse-kornbluth/a-jury-said-jeffrey-macdo_b_1852292.html|accessdate=28 September 2013|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=4 September 2012|author=Jesse Kornbluth}}</ref> Morris explained in a July 2013 interview, prior to the reopening of the case: "What happened here is wrong. It's wrong to convict a man under these circumstances. And if I can help correct that, I will be a happy camper."<ref name="Fast" />

==Style==
To conduct interviews, Morris invented a machine, called the Interrotron, which allows Morris and his subject to talk to each other through the camera lens itself. He explains the device as follows:

{{quote|[[Teleprompters]] are used to project an image on a two-way mirror. Politicians and newscasters use them so that they can read text and look into the lens of the camera at the same time. What interests me is that nobody thought of using them for anything other than to display text: read a speech or read the news and look into the lens of the camera. I changed that. I put my face on the Teleprompter or, strictly speaking, my live video image. For the first time, I could be talking to someone, and they could be talking to me and at the same time looking directly into the lens of the camera. Now, there was no looking off slightly to the side. No more faux first person. This was the true first person.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Rothman|editor1-first=William|title=Three Documentary Filmmakers: Errol Morris, Ross McElwee, Jean Rouch|date=2009|publisher=SUNY Press|location=Albany|isbn=9781438425016|pages=3–4}}</ref>}}

In the "aesthetic context" sense of [[Erik Barnouw]]'s ''Documentary: A History of the Non-Fiction Film'', Morris is a multiple stylist. His "Prosecutor"-style ''[[The Thin Blue Line (1988 film)|Thin Blue Line]]'' influenced legal process and led to [[Randall Adams]]'s release. He utilizes the "Chronicler" style for big events and the "Observer" style for given-moment events. He is best known for the "Catalyst" style that is seen as direct, natural, and cinematically truthful, as no directorial voice-over or "voice" is heard among the voices of others.<ref>Barnouw, Erik. ''Documentary: A History of the Non-Fiction Film'', Oxford University Press, London: 1993.</ref>{{Clarify|date=May 2014}}

Errol Morris is also a large advocate of the reflexive style of documentary film making. In Bill Nichols' book ''Introduction to Documentary'' he states that reflexive documentary “[speaks] not only about the historical world but about the problems and issues of representing it as well." Errol Morris uses not only his films to portray social issues and non-fiction events, but also to comment on the reliability of documentary making itself.<ref>Nichols, Bill.
