Describing Morris as a teenager, Mark Singer wrote that he &quot;read with a passion the forty-odd<space/><link><target>List of Oz books</target><part>''Oz'' books</part></link>, watched a lot of television, and on a regular basis went with a doting but not quite right maiden aunt ('I guess you'd have to say that Aunt Roz was somewhat demented') to Saturday matines, where he saw such films as<space/><italics><link><target>This Island Earth</target></link></italics><space/>and<space/><italics><link><target>Creature from the Black Lagoon</target></link></italics><space/>&amp;mdash; horror movies that, viewed again 30 years later, still seem scary to him.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="singer1"><template><target>cite journal</target><arg name="title">Predilections</arg><arg name="last">Singer</arg><arg name="first">Mark</arg><arg name="journal">[[The New Yorker]]</arg><arg name="date">February 2, 1989</arg><arg name="url">http://www.errolmorris.com/content/profile/singer_predilections.html</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Morris attended the<space/><link><target>University of WisconsinMadison</target></link>. Morris graduated in 1969 with a<space/><link><target>Bachelor of Arts</target><part>B.A.</part></link><space/>in history. For a brief time Morris held small jobs, first as a cable television salesman and then as a term-paper writer. His unorthodox approach to applying for grad school included &quot;trying to get accepted at different graduate schools just by showing up on their doorstep.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="singer1"></extension><space/>Having unsuccessfully approached both the<space/><link><target>University of Oxford</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Harvard University</target></link>, Morris was able to talk his way into<space/><link><target>Princeton University</target></link>, where he began studying the history of science, a topic in which he had &quot;absolutely no background.&quot; His concentration was in the history of physics, and he was bored and unsuccessful in the prerequisite physics classes he had to take. This, together with his antagonistic relationship with his advisor<space/><link><target>Thomas Kuhn</target></link><space/>('You won't even look through my telescope.' And his response was 'Errol, it's not a telescope, it's a kaleidoscope.')<extension extension_name='ref' name="singer1"></extension><space/>ensured that his stay at Princeton would be short.</paragraph><paragraph>Morris left Princeton in 1972, enrolling at<space/><link><target>University of California, Berkeley</target><part>Berkeley</part></link><space/>as a Ph.D. student in<space/><link><target>philosophy</target></link>. At Berkeley, he once again found that he was not well-suited to his subject. &quot;Berkeley was just a world of<space/><link><target>pedant</target><trail>s</trail></link>. It was truly shocking. I spent two or three years in the philosophy program. I have very bad feelings about it,&quot; he later said.<extension extension_name='ref' name="singer1"></extension><space/>He became a regular at the<space/><link><target>Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive</target><part>Pacific Film Archive</part></link>. As Tom Luddy, the director of the archive at the time, later remembered: &quot;He was a<space/><link><target>film noir</target></link><space/>nut. He claimed we weren't showing the real film noir. So I challenged him to write the program notes. Then, there was his habit of sneaking into the films and denying that he was sneaking in. I told him if he was sneaking in he should at least admit he was doing it.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="singer1"></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Unfinished project on Ed Gein</heading><paragraph>Inspired by<space/><link><target>Hitchcock</target></link>'s<space/><italics><link><target>Psycho (1960 film)</target><part>Psycho</part></link></italics>, Morris visited<space/><link><target>Plainfield, Wisconsin</target></link><space/>in 1975. While in Wisconsin, he conducted multiple interviews with<space/><link><target>Ed Gein</target></link>, the infamous<space/><link><target>serial killer</target></link><space/>who was a resident at Mendota State Hospital in Madison. He later made plans with German film director<space/><link><target>Werner Herzog</target></link>, whom Tom Luddy had introduced to Morris, to return in the summer of 1975 to secretly open the grave of Gein's mother to test their theory that Gein himself had already dug her up. Herzog arrived on schedule, but Morris had second thoughts and was not there. Herzog did not open the grave. Morris later returned to Plainfield, this time staying for almost a year, conducting hundreds of hours of interviews. Although he had plans to either write a book or make a film (which he would call<space/><italics>Digging up the Past</italics>), Morris never completed his Ed Gein project.</paragraph><paragraph>In the fall of 1976, Herzog visited Plainfield again, this time to shoot part of his film<space/><italics><link><target>Stroszek</target></link></italics>. After the shooting finished, Herzog handed Morris an envelope with cash in it. Morris walked over to the motel window and tossed the envelope out the window into a parking lot. Herzog went out to the parking lot and brought the money back, again offering it to Morris, saying, &quot;Please don't do that again.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="singer1"></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>First films</heading><paragraph>Morris accepted the $2,000 and used it to take a trip to<space/><link><target>Vernon, Florida</target></link>. Vernon was nicknamed &quot;Nub City&quot; because its residents participated in a particularly gruesome form of insurance fraud in which they deliberately amputated a limb in order to collect the insurance money. Morris's second documentary would be about the town and bear its name, although it makes no mention of Vernon as &quot;Nub City&quot;, but instead explores other idiosyncrasies of the town's residents. Morris made this omission because he received death threats while doing research; the town's residents were afraid that Morris would reveal their secret.</paragraph><paragraph>After spending two weeks in Vernon, Morris returned to Berkeley and began working on a script for a work of fiction that he called<space/><italics>Nub City</italics>. After a few unproductive months, he happened to read a headline in the<space/><italics><link><target>San Francisco Chronicle</target></link></italics><space/>that read, &quot;450 DEAD PETS GOING TO NAPA VALLEY&quot;. Morris left for Napa Valley and began working on the film that would become his first feature,<space/><italics><link><target>Gates of Heaven</target></link></italics>. In 1978, when the film premiered, Werner Herzog cooked and publicly ate his shoe, an event later incorporated into a<space/><link><target>Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe</target><part>short documentary</part></link><space/>by<space/><link><target>Les Blank</target></link>. Herzog had promised to eat his shoe if Morris completed the project, to challenge and encourage Morris, whom Herzog perceived as incapable of following up on the projects he conceived. At the public shoe-eating, Herzog suggested that he hoped the act would serve to encourage anyone having difficulty bringing a project to fruition.</paragraph><paragraph><italics>Gates of Heaven</italics><space/>was given a limited release in the spring of 1981. Critic<space/><link><target>Roger Ebert</target></link><space/>was and remained a champion of the film, including it on his all-time top ten best films list. Morris returned to Vernon in 1979 and again in 1980, renting a house in town and conducting interviews with the town's citizens.<space/><italics><link><target>Vernon, Florida (film)</target><part>Vernon, Florida</part></link></italics><space/>premiered at the 1981<space/><link><target>New York Film Festival</target></link>.<space/><italics><link><target>Newsweek</target></link></italics><space/>called it, &quot;a film as odd and mysterious as its subjects, and quite unforgettable.&quot; The film, like<space/><italics>Gates of Heaven</italics>, suffered from poor distribution. It was released on video in 1987, and DVD in 2005.</paragraph><paragraph>After finishing<space/><italics>Vernon, Florida</italics>, Morris tried unsuccessfully to get funding for a variety of projects. There was<space/><italics>Road</italics>, a story about an interstate highway in Minnesota; a project about Robert Golka, the creator of laser-induced fireballs in Utah; and the story of<space/><link><target>Centralia, Pennsylvania</target></link>, the coal town in which an inextinguishable subterranean fire ignited in 1962. He eventually got funding in 1983 to write a script about John and Jim Pardue, a pair of<space/><link><target>Missouri</target></link><space/>bank robbers who had killed their father and grandmother and robbed five banks. Morris's pitch went, &quot;The great bank-robbery sprees always take place at a time when something is going wrong in the country.<space/><link><target>Bonnie and Clyde</target></link><space/>were apolitical, but it's impossible to imagine them without<space/><link><target>the Depression</target></link><space/>as a back-drop. The Pardue brothers were apolitical, but it's impossible to imagine them without<space/><link><target>Vietnam</target></link>.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="singer1"></extension><space/>Morris wanted<space/><link><target>Tom Waits</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Mickey Rourke</target></link><space/>to play the brothers, and he wrote the script, but the project eventually failed. Morris worked on writing scripts for various other projects, including a pair of ill-fated<space/><link><target>Stephen King</target></link><space/>adaptations.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1984, Morris married Julia Sheehan, whom he had met in Wisconsin while researching Ed Gein and other serial killers. He would later recall an early conversation with Julia: &quot;I was talking to a mass murderer but I was thinking of you,&quot; he said, and instantly regretted it, afraid that it might not have sounded as affectionate as he had wished. But Julia was actually flattered: &quot;I thought, really, that was one of the nicest things anyone ever said to me. It was hard to go out with other guys after that.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="singer1"></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'><italics>The Thin Blue Line</italics></heading><paragraph>In 1985, Morris became interested in Dr.<space/><link><target>James Grigson</target></link>, a psychiatrist in<space/><link><target>Dallas, Texas</target><part>Dallas</part></link>.

Adams told Morris that he had been framed, and that David Harris, who was present at the time of the murder and was the principal witness for the prosecution, had in fact killed Wood. Morris began researching the case because it related to Dr. Grigson. He was at first unconvinced of Adams's innocence. After reading the transcripts of the trial and meeting David Harris at a bar, however, Morris was no longer so sure.</paragraph><paragraph>At the time, Morris had been making a living as a<space/><link><target>private investigator</target></link><space/>for a well-known private detective agency that specialized in Wall Street cases. Bringing together his talents as an investigator and his obsessions with murder, narration, and epistemology, Morris went to work on the case in earnest. Unedited interviews in which the prosecution's witnesses systematically contradicted themselves were used as testimony in Adams's 1986<space/><italics><link><target>habeas corpus</target></link></italics><space/>hearing to determine if he would receive a new trial. David Harris famously confessed, in a roundabout manner, to killing Wood.</paragraph><paragraph>Although Adams was finally found innocent after years of being processed by the legal system, the judge in the<space/><italics>habeas corpus</italics><space/>hearing officially stated that, &quot;much could be said about those videotape interviews, but nothing that would have any bearing on the matter before this court.&quot; Regardless,<space/><italics><link><target>The Thin Blue Line (1988 film)</target><part>The Thin Blue Line</part></link></italics>, as Morris's film would be called, was popularly accepted as the main force behind getting its subject, Randall Adams, out of prison.

It won the documentary of the year award from both the<space/><link><target>New York Film Critics Circle</target></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>National Society of Film Critics</target></link>. Despite its widespread acclaim, it was not nominated for an Oscar, which created a small scandal regarding the nomination practices of the Academy. The Academy cited the film's genre of &quot;non-fiction&quot;, arguing that it was not actually a documentary. To this day,<space/><italics>The Thin Blue Line</italics><space/>is one of the most critically acclaimed documentaries ever made.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Commercials</heading><paragraph>Although Morris has achieved fame as a documentary filmmaker, he is also an accomplished director of<space/><link><target>television commercial</target><trail>s</trail></link>.

In the hauntingly re-enacted opening about McNamara relationship with U.S. General<space/><link><target>Curtis LeMay</target></link><space/>during World War II, Morris brings out complexities in the character of McNamara, which shaped McNamara's positions in the<space/><link><target>Cuban missile crisis</target></link><space/>and the Vietnam War.

Politicians and newscasters use them so that they can read text and look into the lens of the camera at the same time. What interests me is that nobody thought of using them for anything other than to display text: read a speech or read the news and look into the lens of the camera. I changed that. I put my face on the Teleprompter or, strictly speaking, my live video image. For the first time, I could be talking to someone, and they could be talking to me and at the same time looking directly into the lens of the camera. Now, there was no looking off slightly to the side. No more faux first person.
