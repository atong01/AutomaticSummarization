'''Amara Sinha''' (or '''Simha'''<ref name=Chambers/>) (c. AD 375) was a [[Sanskrit]] [[grammar]]ian and [[poet]], of whose personal history hardly anything is known.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

He is said to have been "one of the nine gems that adorned the throne of [[Vikramaditya]]," and according to the evidence of [[Xuanzang]], this is the [[Chandragupta Vikramaditya]] ([[Chandragupta II]]) that flourished about AD 375.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
Other sources describe him as flourishing in c. AD 700.<ref name=Chambers>"Amara-Simha" in ''[[Chambers's Encyclop√¶dia]]''. London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol. 1, p. 311.</ref>

Most of his work was destroyed, with the exception of what is the celebrated ''[[Amara-Kosha]]'' (''Treasury of Amara''), a vocabulary of Sanskrit roots, in three books, and hence sometimes called ''Trikanda'' or the "Tripartite". {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
It is also known as "Namalinganushasana".

It contains 10,000 words, and is arranged, like other works of its class, in metre, to aid the memory.  The first chapter of the ''Kosha'' was printed at [[Rome]] in Tamil character in 1798.  An edition of the entire work, with English notes and an index by [[Henry Thomas Colebrooke|HT Colebrooke]], appeared at [[Serampore]] in 1808. The Sanskrit text was printed at [[Calcutta]] in 1831.  A French translation by ALA Loiseleur-Deslongchamps as published at Paris in 1839. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
[[Benjamin L. Rice|Louie Rice]] compiled the [[Kannada]] version of it and its available 4th edition was printed in 1927 which contains three khandas and 25 sargas.<ref>Amarakosha by Louie Rice edited by N.Balasubhramanyam</ref>
