'''''Drosophila''''' is a [[genus]] of small [[fly|flies]], belonging to the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Drosophilidae]], whose members are often called "fruit flies" or (less frequently) [[pomace]] flies, [[vinegar]] flies, or [[wine]] flies, a reference to the characteristic of many species to linger around overripe or rotting fruit. They should not be confused with the [[Tephritidae]], a related family, which are also called fruit flies (sometimes referred to as "true fruit flies"); tephritids feed primarily on unripe or ripe [[fruit]], with many species being regarded as destructive agricultural pests, especially the [[Mediterranean fruit fly]]. One species of ''Drosophila'' in particular, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster|D. melanogaster]]'', has been heavily used in research in [[genetics]] and is a common [[model organism]] in [[developmental biology]]. The terms "fruit fly" and "''Drosophila''" are often used synonymously with ''D. melanogaster'' in modern biological literature. The entire genus, however, contains more than 1,500 species<ref name=taxodros>{{cite web |author=Gerhard Bächli |year=1999–2006 |url=http://www.taxodros.uzh.ch/ |title=TaxoDros: the database on taxonomy of Drosophilidae}}</ref> and is very diverse in appearance, behavior, and breeding habitat.

== Etymology ==
The term "''Drosophila''", meaning "dew-loving", is a modern scientific [[Latin]] adaptation from [[Greek language|Greek]] words {{lang|el|δρόσος}}, ''{{lang|el|drósos}}'', "[[dew]]", and {{lang|el|φίλος}}, ''{{lang|el|phílos}}'', "loving" with the Latin feminine suffix ''-a''.

==Morphology==
[[File:Drosophila residua head.jpg|thumb|Side view of head showing characteristic bristles above the eye]]
''Drosophila'' are small flies, typically pale yellow to reddish brown to black, with red eyes. Many species, including the noted Hawaiian picture-wings, have distinct black patterns on the wings. The plumose (feathery) [[arista (biology)|arista]], bristling of the head and thorax, and wing venation are characters used to diagnose the family. Most are small, about 2–4 millimetres long, but some, especially many of the Hawaiian species, are larger than a [[house fly]].

==Life cycle and ecology==

===Habitat===
''Drosophila'' are found all around the world, with more species in the tropical regions. They can be found in [[deserts]], [[tropical rainforest]], [[cities]], [[swamp]]s, and [[alpine climate|alpine zones]]. Some northern species [[hibernation|hibernate]]. Most species breed in various kinds of decaying plant and [[fungus|fungal]] material, including [[fruit]], [[bark]], [[slime flux]]es, [[flower]]s, and [[mushroom]]s. The larvae of at least one species, ''[[Drosophila suzukii|D. suzukii]]'', can also feed in fresh fruit and can sometimes be a pest.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cisr.ucr.edu/spotted_wing_drosophila_cherry_vinegar_fly.html |author=Mark Hoddle |accessdate=July 29, 2010 |title=Spotted Wing Drosophila (Cherry Vinegar Fly) ''Drosophila suzukii'' |publisher=[[Center for Invasive Species Research]]}}</ref> A few species have switched to being [[parasitism|parasites]] or [[predator]]s. Many species can be attracted to baits of fermented [[banana]]s or mushrooms, but others are not attracted to any kind of baits. Males may congregate at patches of suitable breeding substrate to compete for the females, or form [[Lek (animal behaviour)|leks]], conducting courtship in an area separate from breeding sites.

Several ''Drosophila'' species, including ''[[Drosophila melanogaster|D. melanogaster]]'', ''[[Drosophila immigrans|D. immigrans]]'', and ''[[Drosophila simulans|D. simulans]]'', are closely associated with humans, and are often referred to as [[Domestication|domestic]] species. These and other species (''[[Drosophila subobscura|D. subobscura]]'', ''[[Zaprionus indianus]]''<ref>{{cite journal |author=C. R.

===Reproduction===

Males of this genus are known to have the longest [[spermatozoon|sperm cells]] of any studied organism on Earth, including one species, ''[[Drosophila bifurca]]'', that has a sperm {{convert|58|mm|abbr=on}} long.<ref name="Pitnick">{{cite journal| author=Scott Pitnick, Greg S. Spicer & Therese A. Markow |year=1995 |title=How long is a giant sperm? |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=375| issue=6527 |page=109 |pmid=7753164 |doi=10.1038/375109a0}}</ref> The cells are mostly tail, and are delivered to the females in tangled coils.

''Drosophila'' vary widely in their reproductive capacity. Those such as ''D. melanogaster'' that breed in large, relatively rare resources have [[ovaries]] that mature 10–20 eggs at a time, so that they can be laid together on one site. Others that breed in more-abundant but less nutritious substrates, such as leaves, may only lay one egg per day. The eggs have one or more respiratory filaments near the anterior end; the tips of these extend above the surface and allow oxygen to reach the embryo. Larvae feed not on the vegetable matter itself but on the [[yeast]]s and [[microorganism]]s present on the decaying breeding substrate. Development time varies widely between species (between 7 and more than 60 days) and depends on the environmental factors such as [[temperature]], breeding substrate, and crowding. Numerous studies have shown that fruit flies lay eggs using an environmental circle. If fruit flies laid eggs at nighttime during which the environmental conditions were advantageous, the eggs could not be susceptible to desiccation from parasites. As a result, the offspring reproduced from these eggs would have greater fitness compared to offspring that were reproduced from eggs laid during the day. Since eggs are laid with a biological clock, Drosophila melanogaster become adaptive to their environmental cycles, which showed a major advantage.<ref> Howlader, G., Sharma, K. V (2006).

===Laboratory-cultured animals===
''Drosophila melanogaster'' is a popular experimental animal because it is easily cultured in mass out of the wild, has a short generation time, and mutant animals are readily obtainable. In 1906, [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]] began his work on ''D. melanogaster'' and reported his first finding of a ''white'' (eyed) mutant in 1910 to the academic community. He was in search of a model organism to study genetic heredity and required a species that could randomly acquire genetic mutation that would visibly manifest as morphological changes in the adult animal. His work on ''Drosophila'' earned him the 1933 [[Nobel Prize]] in Medicine for identifying [[chromosome]]s as the vector of inheritance for genes. This and other ''Drosophila'' species are widely used in studies of [[genetics]], [[Drosophila embryogenesis|embryogenesis]], and other areas.

However, some species of ''Drosophila'' are difficult to culture in the laboratory, often because they breed on a single specific host in the wild. For some it can be done with particular recipes for rearing media, or by introducing chemicals such as [[sterols]] that are found in the natural host; for others it is (so far) impossible. In some cases, the larvae can develop on normal ''Drosophila'' lab medium but the female will not lay eggs; for these it is often simply a matter of putting in a small piece of the natural host to receive the eggs. The [https://stockcenter.ucsd.edu/info/welcome.php ''Drosophila'' Species Stock Center] in [[San Diego]] maintains cultures of hundreds of species for researchers.

===Microbiome===
Like other metazoans Drosophila is associated with various bacteria in its gut. The fly gut microbiota or microbiome seems to have a central influence on Drosophila fitness and life history characteristics. The [[Microbiome_in_the_Drosophila_gut|microbiota in the gut of Drosophila]] represents an active current research field.

===Predators===
''Drosophila'' are prey for many generalist predators such as [[Asilidae|robber flies]]. In [[Hawaii]], the introduction of [[Vespula|yellowjackets]] from the mainland [[United States]] has led to the decline of many of the large species. The larvae are preyed on by other fly larvae, [[Staphylinidae|staphylinid]] [[beetle]]s, and [[ant]]s.

==''Drosophila'' species genome project==
''Drosophila'' are extensively used as a model organism in genetics (including population genetics), cell-biology, biochemistry, and especially developmental biology. Therefore, extensive efforts are made to sequence drosphilid genomes. The genomes of the following species have been fully sequenced:<ref name="LBL">{{cite web |url=http://rana.lbl.gov/drosophila/index.html |title=12 ''Drosophila'' Genomes Project |publisher=[[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] |accessdate=July 29, 2010}}</ref>

The data have been used for many purposes, including evolutionary genome comparisons. ''D. simulans'' and ''D. sechellia'' are sister species, and provide viable offspring when crossed, while ''D. melanogaster'' and ''D. simulans'' produce infertile [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] offspring. The ''Drosophila'' genome is often compared with the genomes of more distantly related species such as the [[honeybee]] ''[[Western honeybee|Apis mellifera]]'' or the [[mosquito]] ''[[Anopheles gambiae]]''.

The modEncode consortium is currently sequencing 8 more Drosophila genomes,<ref name="modencode">{{cite web |url=http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/Sequencing/SeqProposals/modENCODE_ComparativeGenomics_WhitePaper.pdf |title=modEncode Comparative Genomics white paper |publisher=[[ENCODE]] |accessdate=December 13, 2013}}</ref> and even more genomes are being sequenced by the i5K consortium.<ref name="i5K">{{cite web |url=http://www.arthropodgenomes.org/wiki/i5K_nominations |title=i5k species nomination summary |publisher= |accessdate=December 13, 2013}}</ref>
