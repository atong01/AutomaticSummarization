He played a central role in the creation of the modern<space/><link><target>Conservative Party (UK)</target><part>Conservative Party</part></link>, defining its policies and its broad outreach. Disraeli is remembered for his influential voice in world affairs, his political battles with the Liberal leader<space/><link><target>William Ewart Gladstone</target></link>, and his<space/><link><target>one-nation conservatism</target></link><space/>or &quot;Tory democracy&quot;. He made the Conservatives the party most identified with the glory and power of the<space/><link><target>British Empire</target></link>. He is,<space/><template><target>as of</target><arg>2015</arg><arg name="alt">at 2015</arg></template>, the only British Prime Minister of<space/><link><target>British Jews</target><part>Jewish birth</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Disraeli was born in London. His father left Judaism after a dispute at his synagogue; young Benjamin became an<space/><link><target>Anglicanism</target><part>Anglican</part></link><space/>at the age of 12. After several unsuccessful attempts, Disraeli entered the<space/><link><target>House of Commons of the United Kingdom</target><part>House of Commons</part></link><space/>in 1837. When the Conservatives gained power in 1841, Disraeli was given no office by the Prime Minister,<space/><link><target>Robert Peel</target><part>Sir Robert Peel</part></link>. In 1846, Peel split the party over his proposal to repeal the<space/><link><target>Corn Laws</target></link>, which imposed a tariff on imported grain. Disraeli clashed with Peel in the Commons. The Conservatives who split from Peel had few who were adept in Parliament, and Disraeli became a major figure in the party, though many in it did not favour him. When<space/><link><target>Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby</target><part>Lord Derby</part></link>, the party leader, thrice formed governments in the 1850s and 1860s, Disraeli served as<space/><link><target>Chancellor of the Exchequer</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Leader of the House of Commons</target></link>. He also forged a bitter rivalry with the<space/><link><target>Liberal Party (UK)</target><part>Liberal Party's</part></link><space/>William Ewart Gladstone.</paragraph><paragraph>Upon Derby's retirement due to ill health in 1868, Disraeli became Prime Minister briefly before losing that year's election. He returned to opposition, before leading the party to a majority in the 1874 election. He maintained a close friendship with<space/><link><target>Queen Victoria</target></link>, who in 1876 created him Earl of Beaconsfield. Disraeli's second term was dominated by the<space/><link><target>Eastern Question</target></link>the slow decay of the<space/><link><target>Ottoman Empire</target></link><space/>and the desire of other countries, such as Russia, to gain at its expense. Disraeli arranged for the British to purchase a major interest in the<space/><link><target>Suez Canal Company</target></link><space/>(in Ottoman-controlled Egypt). In 1878, faced with Russian victories against the Ottomans, he worked at the<space/><link><target>Congress of Berlin</target></link><space/>to maintain peace in the Balkans and made terms favourable to Britain which weakened Russia, its longstanding enemy. This diplomatic victory over Russia established Disraeli as one of Europe's leading statesmen.</paragraph><paragraph>World events thereafter moved against the Conservatives. Controversial wars in<space/><link><target>Second Anglo-Afghan War</target><part>Afghanistan</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Anglo-Zulu War</target><part>South Africa</part></link><space/>undermined his public support. He angered British farmers by refusing to reinstitute the Corn Laws in response to poor harvests and cheap American grain. With Gladstone conducting<space/><link><target>Midlothian campaign</target><part>a massive speaking campaign</part></link>, his Liberals bested Disraeli's Conservatives in<space/><link><target>United Kingdom general election, 1880</target><part>the 1880 election</part></link>.

This divided the Liberals, and on 12 March an alliance of Conservatives and Irish Catholics defeated the government by three votes. Gladstone resigned, and the Queen sent for Disraeli, who refused to take office. Without a general election, a Conservative government would be another minority, dependent for survival on the division of its opponents. Disraeli wanted the power a majority would bring, and felt he could gain it later by leaving the Liberals in office now.

The Prime Minister wanted a deal with the Ottomans whereby Britain would temporarily occupy strategic areas to deter the Russians from war, to be returned on the signing of a peace treaty, but found little support in his cabinet, which favoured partition of the Ottoman Empire.

Only four and a half years had passed since the last general election. Additionally, they did not see any clouds on the horizon that might forecast Conservative defeat if they waited. This decision not to seek re-election has often been cited as a great mistake by Disraeli.

Other European nations, faced with similar circumstances, opted for protection, and Disraeli was urged to reinstitute the Corn Laws. He declined, stating that he regarded the matter as settled.

Gladstone had absented himself from the funeral, with his plea of the press of public business met with public mockery. His speech was widely anticipated, if only because his dislike for Disraeli was well known, and caused the Prime Minister much worry. In the event, the speech was a model of its kind, in which he avoided comment on Disraeli's politics, while praising his personal qualities.<extension extension_name='ref'>Blake (1967), p. 753</extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Legacy</heading><heading level='3'>Literary</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Sybil.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Title page of first edition of ''<link><target>Sybil (novel)</target><part>Sybil</part></link>'' (1845)</part><part>alt=The cover of a book, entitled &quot;Sybil; or, the Two Nations&quot;</part></link>Blake comments that Disraeli &quot;produced an epic poem, unbelievably bad, and a five-act blank verse tragedy, if possible worse.

Before his leadership of the Conservative Party, imperialism was the province of the Liberals, most notably Palmerston, with the Conservatives murmuring dissent across the aisle. Disraeli made the Conservatives the party that most loudly supported both the Empire and military action to assert its primacy. This came about in part because Disraeli's own views stemmed that way, in part because he saw advantage for the Conservatives, and partially in reaction against Gladstone, who disliked the expense of empire. Blake argued that Disraeli's imperialism &quot;decisively orientated the Conservative party for many years to come, and the tradition which he started was probably a bigger electoral asset in winning working-class support during the last quarter of the century than anything else&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref'>Blake (1967), pp. 760761</extension><space/>Some historians have commented on a romantic impulse behind Disraeli's approach to Empire and foreign affairs: Abbott writes, &quot;To the mystical Tory concepts of Throne, Church, Aristocracy and People, Disraeli added Empire.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>Abbott, p. 22</extension><space/>Others have identified a strongly pragmatic aspect to his policies. Gladstone's biographer<space/><link><target>Philip Magnus-Allcroft</target><part>Philip Magnus</part></link><space/>contrasted Disraeli's grasp of foreign affairs with that of Gladstone, who &quot;never understood that high moral principles, in their application to foreign policy, are more often destructive of political stability than motives of national self-interest.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>Magnus, p. 287</extension><space/>In Parry's view, Disraeli's foreign policy &quot;can be seen as a gigantic castle in the air (as it was by Gladstone), or as an overdue attempt to force the British commercial classes to awaken to the realities of European politics.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>Parry, p. 135</extension></paragraph><paragraph>During his lifetime Disraeli's opponents, and sometimes even his friends and allies, questioned whether he sincerely held the views he propounded, or whether they were adopted by him as essential to one who sought to spend his life in politics, and were mouthed by him without conviction.

Disraeli fascinated and divided contemporary opinion; he was seen by many, including some members of his own party, as an adventurer and a charlatan and by others as a far-sighted and patriotic statesman. As an actor on the political stage he played many roles: Byronic hero, man of letters, social critic, parliamentary virtuoso, squire of Hughenden, royal companion, European statesman.
