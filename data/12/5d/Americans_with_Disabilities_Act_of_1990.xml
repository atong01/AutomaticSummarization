One of the definitions of &quot;discrimination&quot; under Title III of the ADA is a &quot;failure to remove&quot; architectural barriers in existing facilities. See<space/><template><target>UnitedStatesCodeSub</target><arg>42</arg><arg>12182</arg><arg>b</arg><arg>2</arg><arg>A</arg><arg>iv</arg></template>. This means that even facilities that have not been modified or altered in any way after the ADA was passed still have obligations. The standard is whether &quot;removing barriers&quot; (typically defined as bringing a condition into compliance with the ADAAG) is &quot;readily achievable&quot;, defined as &quot;...easily accomplished without much difficulty or expense.&quot;</paragraph><paragraph>The statutory definition of &quot;readily achievable&quot; calls for a<space/><link><target>balancing test</target></link><space/>between the cost of the proposed &quot;fix&quot; and the wherewithal of the business and/or owners of the business. Thus, what might be &quot;readily achievable&quot; for a sophisticated and financially capable corporation might not be readily achievable for a small or local business.</paragraph><paragraph>There are exceptions to this title; many private clubs and religious organizations may not be bound by Title III. With regard to historic properties (those properties that are listed or that are eligible for listing in the<space/><link><target>National Register of Historic Places</target></link>, or properties designated as historic under state or local law), those facilities must still comply with the provisions of Title III of the ADA to the &quot;maximum extent feasible&quot; but if following the usual standards would &quot;threaten to destroy the historic significance of a feature of the building&quot; then alternative standards may be used.</paragraph><paragraph>Under 2010 revisions of Department of Justice regulations, newly constructed or altered swimming pools, wading pools, and spas must have an accessible means of entrance and exit to pools for disabled people. However, the requirement is conditioned on whether providing access through a fixed lift is &quot;readily achievable.&quot; Other requirements exist, based on pool size, include providing a certain number of accessible means of entry and exit, which are outlined in Section 242 of the standards. However, businesses are free to consider the differences in application of the rules depending on whether the pool is new or altered, or whether the swimming pool was in existence before the effective date of the new rule. Full compliance may not be required for existing facilities; Section 242 and 1009 of the 2010 Standards outline such exceptions.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="title">2013 ADA Pool Lift Compliance Deadline: Has Your Business Complied?<space/></arg><arg name="url">http://www.natlawreview.com/article/2013-ada-pool-lift-compliance-deadline-has-your-business-complied<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Lowndes, Drosdick, Doster, Kantor & Reed, P.A.<space/></arg><arg name="work">The National Law Review<space/></arg><arg name="date">2013-01-29<space/></arg><arg name="deadurl">no<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2013-02-19</arg></template></extension><template><target>anchor</target><arg>Title IV</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='3'>Title IVtelecommunications</heading><paragraph>Title IV of the ADA amended the landmark<space/><link><target>Communications Act of 1934</target></link><space/>primarily by adding section<space/><template><target>UnitedStatesCode</target><arg>47</arg><arg>225</arg></template>. This section requires that all telecommunications companies in the U.S. take steps to ensure functionally equivalent services for consumers with disabilities, notably those who are deaf or hard of hearing and those with speech impairments.

Additionally, the distribution of the accessible seating was at issue, with nearly all the seats being provided in the end-zone areas. The U.S. Department of Justice assisted in the suit filed by attorney Richard Bernstein of<space/><link><target>The Law Offices of Sam Bernstein</target></link><space/>in Farmington Hills, Michigan, which was settled in March 2008.<extension extension_name='ref'>Erb, Robin. &quot;U-M fans rave about new seats for disabled,&quot; Detroit Free Press. 9 September 2008.</extension><space/>The settlement required the stadium to add 329 wheelchair seats throughout the stadium by 2010, and an additional 135 accessible seats in clubhouses to go along with the existing 88 wheelchair seats. This case was significant because it set a precedent for the uniform distribution of accessible seating and gave the DOJ the opportunity to clarify previously unclear rules.<extension extension_name='ref' name="wolffe">Wolffe, Jerry. &quot;New wheelchair seats will be full at U-M's Big House.&quot; The Oakland Press. 14 September 2008.</extension><space/>The agreement now is a blueprint for all stadiums and other public facilities regarding accessibility.<extension extension_name='ref' name="autogenerated1">Wolffe, Jerry. &quot;New wheelchair seats will be full at U-M's Big House,&quot; The Oakland Press. 14 September 2008. /</extension></paragraph><heading level='3'><italics>Paralyzed Veterans of America v.

Ellerbe Becket Architects and Engineers</italics><space/>(1996) was focused on the wheelchair accessibility of a stadium project that was still in the design phase,<space/><link><target>MCI Center</target></link><space/>in Washington, D.C. Previous to this case, which was filed only five years after the ADA was passed, the DOJ was unable or unwilling to provide clarification on the distribution requirements for accessible wheelchair locations in large assembly spaces. While Section 4.33.3 of ADAAG makes reference to lines of sight, no specific reference is made to seeing over standing patrons. The MCI Center, designed by Ellerbe Becket Architects &amp; Engineers, was designed with too few wheelchair and companion seats, and the ones that were included did not provide sight lines that would enable the wheelchair user to view the playing area while the spectators in front of them were standing. This case and another related case established precedent on seat distribution and sight lines issues for ADA enforcement that continues to present day.</paragraph><heading level='3'><italics>Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v.

Williams</target></link></italics>,<space/><link><target>Case citation</target><part>534 U.S. 184</part></link><space/>(2002) was a case in which the Supreme Court interpreted the meaning of the phrase &quot;substantially impairs&quot; as used in the Americans with Disabilities Act. It reversed a Sixth Court of Appeals decision to grant a partial<space/><link><target>summary judgment</target></link><space/>in favor of the respondent, Ella Williams that qualified her inability to perform manual job-related tasks as a disability. The Court held that the &quot;major life activity&quot; definition in evaluating the performance of manual tasks focuses the inquiry on whether Williams was unable to perform a range of tasks central to most people in carrying out the activities of daily living. The issue is not whether Williams was unable to perform her specific job tasks. Therefore, the determination of whether an impairment rises to the level of a disability is not limited to activities in the workplace solely, but rather to manual tasks in life in general. When the Supreme Court applied this standard, it found that the Court of Appeals had incorrectly determined the presence of a disability because it relied solely on her inability to perform specific manual work tasks, which was insufficient in proving the presence of a disability. The Court of Appeals should have taken into account the evidence presented that Williams retained the ability to do personal tasks and household chores, such activities being the nature of tasks most people do in their daily lives, and placed too much emphasis on her job disability. Since the evidence showed that Williams was performing normal daily tasks, it ruled that the Court of Appeals erred when it found that Williams was disabled.<extension extension_name='ref' name="cornell"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-1089.ZO.html
