The encomienda system that had perpetrated much of the abuse of the indigenous peoples fell away by the end of the 16th century, and was replaced by<space/><link><target>hacienda</target><trail>s</trail></link>.

The state's society evolved into three distinct spheres: indigenous peoples, mestizos from the farms and haciendas and the Spanish colonial cities. Most of the political struggles were between the latter two groups especially over who would control the indigenous labor force. Economically, the state lost one of its main crops, indigo, to synthetic dyes.

As Liberals gained the upper hand nationally in the mid-19th century, one Liberal politician ngel Albino Corzo gained control of the state. Corzo became the primary exponent of Liberal ideas in the southeast of Mexico and defended the Palenque and<space/><link><target>Pichucalco</target></link><space/>areas from annexation by Tabasco.

Liberal governments expropriated lands that were previously held by the<space/><link><target>Spanish Crown</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Catholic Church</target></link><space/>in order to sell them into private hands. This was not only motivated by ideology, but also due to the need to raise money. However, many of these lands had been in a kind of &quot;trust&quot; with the local indigenous populations, who worked them. Liberal reforms took away this arrangement and many of these lands fell into the hands of large landholders who when made the local Indian population work for three to five days a week just for the right to continue to cultivate the lands. This requirement caused many to leave and look for employment elsewhere. Most became &quot;free&quot; workers on other farms, but they were often paid only with food and basic necessities from the farm shop. If this was not enough, these workers became indebted to these same shops and then unable to leave.<extension extension_name='ref' name="higgens8283">Higgens, p. 8283.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>The opening up of these lands also allowed many whites and mestizos (often called Ladinos in Chiapas) to encroach on what had been exclusively indigenous communities in the state. These communities had had almost no contact with the Ladino world, except for a priest. The new Ladino landowners occupied their acquired lands as well as others, such as shopkeepers, opened up businesses in the center of Indian communities. In 1848, a group of<space/><link><target>Tzeltal people</target><part>Tzeltals</part></link><space/>plotted to kill the new mestizos in their midst, but this plan was discovered, and was punished by th removal of large number of the communitys male members.

It also resulted in some brief respites for Indians during times when the instability led to uncollected taxes.<extension extension_name='ref' name="higgens86">Higgens, p. 86.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>One other effect that Liberal land reforms had was the start of coffee plantations, especially in the<space/><link><target>Soconusco</target></link><space/>region. One reason for this push in this area was that Mexico was still working to strengthen its claim on the area against Guatemalas claims on the region. The land reforms brought colonists from other areas of the country as well as foreigners from England, the United States and France. These forieign immigrants would introduce coffee production to the areas, as well as modern machineray and professional administration of coffee plantations. Eventually, this production of coffee would become the state's most important crop.<extension extension_name='ref' name="martineztorres"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Although the Liberals had mostly triumphed in the state and the rest of the country by the 1860s, Conservatives still held considerable power in Chiapas. Liberal politicians sought to solidify their power among the indigenous groups by weakening the Church. The more radical of these even allowed indigenous groups the religious freedoms to return to a number of native rituals and beliefs such as pilgrimages to natural shrines such as mountains and waterfalls.<extension extension_name='ref' name="higgens8788">Higgens, p. 8788.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>This culminated in the Chiapas &quot;caste war&quot;, which was an uprising the<space/><link><target>Tzotzil people</target><part>Tzotzils</part></link><space/>beginning in 1868.<extension extension_name='ref' name="hisschmal"></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="higgens88">Higgens, p. 88.</extension><space/>The basis of the uprising was the establishment of the &quot;three stones cult&quot; in Tzajahemal.<extension extension_name='ref' name="higgens88"></extension><space/><link><target>Agustina Gmez Checheb</target></link><space/>was a girl tending her fathers sheep when three stones fell from the sky.

The cult was taken over by one pilgrim,<space/><link><target>Pedro Daz Cuzcat</target></link>, who also claimed to be able to communicate with the stones, and had knowledge of Catholic ritual, becoming a kind of priest.
