The '''''Enola Gay''''' is a [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] [[bomber]], named for Enola Gay Tibbets, the mother of the pilot, [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Paul Tibbets]], who selected the aircraft while it was still on the assembly line. On 6 August 1945, during the final stages of [[World War II]], it became the first aircraft to [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|drop an atomic bomb]]. The bomb, code-named "[[Little Boy]]", was targeted at the city of [[Hiroshima]], Japan, and caused unprecedented destruction. ''Enola Gay'' participated in the second atomic attack as the weather reconnaissance aircraft for the primary target of [[Kokura]]. Clouds and drifting smoke resulted in [[Nagasaki]] being bombed instead.

After the war, the ''Enola Gay'' returned to the United States, where it was operated from [[Walker Air Force Base|Roswell Army Air Field]], [[New Mexico]]. It was flown to [[Kwajalein]] for the [[Operation Crossroads]] [[nuclear test]]s in the Pacific, but was not chosen to make the test drop at [[Bikini Atoll]]. Later that year it was transferred to the [[Smithsonian Institution]], and spent many years parked at air bases exposed to the weather and souvenir hunters, before being disassembled and transported to the Smithsonian's storage facility at [[Suitland, Maryland]], in 1961.

In the 1980s, veterans groups engaged in a call for the Smithsonian to put the aircraft on display, leading to an acrimonious debate about exhibiting the aircraft without a proper historical context. The cockpit and nose section of the aircraft were exhibited at the [[National Air and Space Museum]] (NASM) in downtown Washington, D.C., for the bombing's 50th anniversary in 1995, amid a storm of controversy. Since 2003, the entire restored B-29 has been on display at NASM's [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]]. The last survivor of its crew, [[Theodore Van Kirk]], died on July 28, 2014, at the age of 93.

===Early history===
The ''Enola Gay'' (Model number B-29-45-MO,{{refn|The ''block number'' was a one to three digit number followed by a two letter code that represented the aircraft built to the same engineering specification. The two letter code represented the plant at which the aircraft was built, in this case, Martin in Omaha. This was combined with the aircraft model designation (B-29) to form the ''model number'' {{sfn|Mann|2004|p=100}}|group=N}} Serial number 44-86292, [[USAAF unit identification aircraft markings#XXI Bomber Command|Victor number]] 82) was built by the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]] (now [[Lockheed Martin]]) at its [[Bellevue, Nebraska]] plant, located at what is now known as [[Offutt Air Force Base]]. The bomber was one of 15 [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29]]s with the "[[Silverplate]]" modifications necessary to deliver atomic weapons. These modifications included an extensively modified bomb bay with pneumatic doors and British bomb attachment and release systems, reversible pitch propellers that gave more braking power on landing, improved engines with fuel injection and better cooling,{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=14–15}}<ref name="AirIll">March, Peter R. "Enola Gay Restored". ''Aircraft Illustrated'', October 2003.</ref> and the removal of protective armor and gun turrets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aviationexplorer.com/B-29_Enola_Gay_Superfortress_Bomber.html |title=Boeing B-29 Enola Gay Superfortress bomber, Aircraft history, facts and pictures |publisher=aviationexplorer.com |accessdate=4 August 2010}}</ref>

[[File:Enola Gay (plane).jpg|thumb|right|400px|''Enola Gay'' after Hiroshima mission, entering hard-stand. It is in its 6th Bombardment Group livery, with [[USAAF unit identification aircraft markings|victor number]] 82 visible on fuselage just forward of the tail fin.]]
''Enola Gay'' was personally selected by [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Paul Tibbets|Paul W. Tibbets, Jr.]], the commander of the [[509th Composite Group]], on 9 May 1945, while still on the [[assembly line]]. The aircraft was accepted by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) on 18 May 1945 and assigned to the [[393d Bomb Squadron|393d Bombardment Squadron, Heavy]], 509th Composite Group. Crew B-9, commanded by [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] [[Robert A. Lewis]], took delivery of the bomber and flew it from Omaha to the 509th's base at [[Wendover Army Air Field]], [[Utah]], on 14 June 1945.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=191–192}}

Thirteen days later, the aircraft left Wendover for [[Guam]], where it received a bomb-bay modification, and flew to [[North Field (Tinian)|North Field]], [[Tinian]], on 6 July. It was initially given the Victor (squadron-assigned identification) number 12, but on 1 August, was given the [[USAAF unit identification aircraft markings#XXI Bomber Command|circle R tail markings]] of the [[6th Operations Group|6th Bombardment Group]] as a security measure and had its Victor number changed to 82 to avoid misidentification with actual 6th Bombardment Group aircraft.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=191–192}}  During July, the bomber made eight practice or training flights, and flew two missions, on 24 and 26 July, to drop [[pumpkin bomb]]s on industrial targets at [[Kobe]] and [[Nagoya]]. ''Enola Gay'' was used on 31 July on a rehearsal flight for the actual mission.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=117}}

The partially assembled [[Little Boy]] [[gun-type nuclear weapon]] L-11 was contained inside a {{convert|41|in|cm|adj=on}} x {{convert|47|in|cm|adj=on}} x {{convert|138|in|cm|adj=on}} wooden crate weighing {{convert|10000|lb}} that was secured to the deck of the {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|6}}. Unlike the six [[Uranium-235]] target discs, which were later flown to Tinian on three separate aircraft arriving 28 and 29 July, the assembled projectile with the nine Uranium-235 rings installed was shipped in a single lead-lined steel container weighing {{convert|300|lb}} that was securely locked to brackets welded to the deck of [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] [[Charles B. McVay III]]'s quarters.{{refn|The atomic bombs were euphemistically known as the "gadgets", a tag given to them by scientists at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] test facility.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=2}}|group=N}} Both the L-11 and projectile were dropped off at Tinian on 26 July 1945.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=258}}

===Hiroshima mission===
{{main|Bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki}}
[[File:Atombombe Little Boy 2.jpg|thumb|right|Little Boy unit on trailer cradle in pit on Tinian, before being loaded into ''Enola Gay'''s bomb bay.]]
On 5 August 1945, during preparation for the first atomic mission, Tibbets assumed command of the aircraft and named it after his mother, Enola Gay Tibbets, who had herself been named for the heroine of [[Enola; or, Her fatal mistake|a novel]].{{refn|''Enola; or Her fatal mistake'' (1886), by Mary Young Ridenbaugh is the only novel of the period to use "Enola".<ref>{{cite book |last=Ridenbaugh |first=Mary Young |title=Enola; or Her fatal mistake |location=St Louis, Missouri |publisher=Woodward & Tiernan |year=1886}}</ref>|group=N}} When it came to selecting a name for the plane, Tibbets later recalled that: {{quote|my thoughts turned at this point to my courageous red-haired mother, whose quiet confidence had been a source of strength to me since boyhood, and particularly during the soul-searching period when I decided to give up a medical career to become a military pilot. At a time when Dad had thought I had lost my marbles, she had taken my side and said, "I know you will be all right son."{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=203}} }}

The name was painted on the aircraft on 5 August by Allan L. Karl, an enlisted man in the 509th.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=191–192}} Regularly assigned aircraft commander Robert Lewis was unhappy to be displaced by Tibbets for this important mission, and became furious when he arrived at the aircraft on the morning of 6 August to see it painted with the now-famous nose art.{{sfn|Thomas|Morgan-Witts|1977|pp=382–383}}

[[Hiroshima]] was the primary target of the first nuclear bombing mission on 6 August, with Kokura and Nagasaki as alternative targets. ''Enola Gay'', piloted by Tibbets, took off from [[North Field (Tinian)|North Field]], in the [[Mariana Islands]], about six hours' flight time from Japan, accompanied by two other B-29s, ''[[The Great Artiste]]'', carrying instrumentation, and a then-nameless aircraft later called ''[[Necessary Evil (aircraft)|Necessary Evil]]'', commanded by Captain George Marquardt, to take photographs. The director of the [[Manhattan Project]], [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Leslie R. Groves, Jr.]], wanted the event recorded for posterity, so the takeoff was illuminated by floodlights. When he wanted to taxi, Tibbets leaned out the window to direct the bystanders out of the way. On request, he gave a friendly wave for the cameras.{{sfn|Polmar|2004|pp=31–32}}
[[File:Atomic cloud over Hiroshima.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hiroshima explosion.]]

After leaving Tinian the aircraft made their way separately to [[Iwo Jima]], where they rendezvoused at {{convert|2440|m|ft|sp=us}} and set course for Japan. The aircraft arrived over the target in clear visibility at {{convert|9855|m|ft|sp=us}}. Captain [[William Sterling Parsons|William S. "Deak" Parsons]] of [[Project Alberta]], who was in command of the mission, armed the bomb during the flight to minimize the risks during takeoff. His assistant, [[Second Lieutenant]] [[Morris R. Jeppson]], removed the safety devices 30 minutes before reaching the target area.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mphpa.org/classic/HISTORY/H-07L1.htm| title=Timeline #2- the 509th; The Hiroshima Mission |publisher=The Atomic Heritage Foundation|accessdate=5 May 2007}}</ref>

The release at 08:15 (Hiroshima time) went as planned, and the Little Boy took 43 seconds to fall from the aircraft flying at {{convert|31060|ft|m|sp=us}} to the predetermined detonation height about {{convert|1968|ft|m|sp=us}} above the city.

[[File:Enola Gay2-PS.jpg|thumb|right|Photo showing the plane back to its base.]]
''Enola Gay'' returned safely to its base on Tinian to great fanfare, touching down at 2:58 pm, after 12 hours 13 minutes. ''The Great Artiste'' and ''Necessary Evil'' followed at short intervals. Several hundred people, including journalists and photographers, had gathered to watch the planes return. Tibbets was the first to disembark, and was presented with the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] on the spot.{{sfn|Polmar|2004|p=33}}

===Nagasaki mission===
The Hiroshima mission was followed by another atomic strike. Originally scheduled for 11 August, it was brought forward by two days to 9 August owing to bad weather. This time, a [[Fat Man]] nuclear weapon was carried by B-29 ''[[Bockscar]]'', piloted by Major [[Charles W. Sweeney]].{{sfn|Polmar|2004|pp=35–38}} ''Enola Gay'', flown by Captain George Marquardt's Crew B-10, was the weather reconnaissance aircraft for [[Kokura]], the primary target.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=32}} ''Enola Gay'' reported clear skies over Kokura,{{sfn|Sweeney|Antonucci|Antonucci|1997|pp=210–211}} but by the time ''Bockscar'' arrived, the city was obscured by smoke from fires from the conventional bombing of [[Yawata]] by 224 B-29s the day before. After three unsuccessful passes, ''Bockscar'' diverted to its secondary target, Nagasaki,{{sfn|Sweeney|Antonucci|Antonucci|1997|pp=213–215}} where it dropped its bomb. In contrast to the Hiroshima mission, the Nagasaki mission has been described as tactically botched, although the mission did meet its objectives. The crew encountered a number of problems in execution, and had very little fuel by the time they landed at [[Yontan Airfield]] on [[Okinawa]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=527 |title=Boeing B-29 Superfortress |publisher=National Museum of the United States Air Force|accessdate=3 August 2010}}</ref><ref name="Hiroshima">{{cite web |last=Rossenfeld |first=Carrie |url=http://hiroshima-remembered.com/history/nagasaki/page3.html |title=The Story of Nagasaki: The Missions |publisher=hiroshima-remembered.com |year=2005|accessdate=3 August 2010}}</ref>

==Subsequent history==
[[File:Enola Gay Storage Smithsonian.jpg|thumb|''Enola Gay'' in the Smithsonian storage facility at Suitland, 1987]]

On 6 November 1945, Lewis flew the ''Enola Gay'' back to the United States, arriving at the 509th's new base at [[Walker Air Force Base|Roswell Army Air Field]], [[New Mexico]], on 8 November. On 29 April 1946, ''Enola Gay'' left Roswell as part of [[Operation Crossroads]] [[nuclear test]]s in the Pacific. It flew to [[Kwajalein]] on 1 May. It was not chosen to make the test drop at [[Bikini Atoll]] and left Kwajalein on 1 July, the date of the test, reaching [[Travis Air Force Base|Fairfield-Suisun Army Air Field]], California, the next day.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=193}}

The decision was made to preserve the ''Enola Gay'', and on 24 July 1946, the aircraft was flown to [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]], [[Arizona]], in preparation for storage. On 30 August 1946, the title to the aircraft was transferred to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and the ''Enola Gay'' was removed from the USAAF inventory.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=193}} From 1946 to 1961, the ''Enola Gay'' was put into temporary storage at a number of locations. It was at Davis-Monthan from 1 September 1946 until 3 July 1949, when it was flown to  [[O'Hare International Airport|Orchard Place Air Field]], [[Park Ridge, Illinois]], by Tibbets for acceptance by the Smithsonian. It was moved to [[Pyote Air Force Base]], Texas, on 12 January 1952, and then to [[Andrews Air Force Base]], Maryland, on 2 December 1953,{{sfn|Polmar|2004|p=66}}  because the Smithsonian had no storage space for the aircraft.<ref name="An Exhibit Denied"/>

It was hoped that the Air Force would guard the plane but, lacking hangar space, it was left outdoors on a remote part of the air base, exposed to the elements. Souvenir hunters broke in and removed parts. Insects and birds then gained access to the aircraft. [[Paul E. Garber]], the first head of the National Air Museum of the Smithsonian Institution, became concerned about the ''Enola Gay''{{'}}s condition,<ref name="An Exhibit Denied">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/harwit-exhibit.html |accessdate=13 April 2013 |title=An Exhibit Denied: Lobbying the History of Enola Gay |last=Harwit |first=Martin |newspaper=[[New York Times]] }}</ref> and on 10 August 1960, Smithsonian staff began dismantling the aircraft. The components were transported to the Smithsonian storage facility at [[Suitland, Maryland]], on 21 July 1961.{{sfn|Polmar|2004|p=66}}

''Enola Gay'' remained at Suitland for many years. By the early 1980s, two veterans of the 509th, Don Rehl and his former navigator in the 509th, Frank B. Stewart, began lobbying for the aircraft to be restored and put on display. They enlisted Tibbets and Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] in their campaign. In 1983, [[Walter Boyne]], a former [[B-52]] pilot with the [[Strategic Air Command]], became director of the National Air and Space Museum, and he made the ''Enola Gay''{{'}}s restoration a priority.<ref name="An Exhibit Denied"/> Looking at the aircraft, Tibbets recalled, was a "sad meeting. [My] fond memories, and I don't mean the dropping of the bomb, were the numerous occasions I flew the airplane.... I pushed it very, very hard and it never failed me.... It was probably the most beautiful piece of machinery that any pilot ever flew."<ref name="An Exhibit Denied"/>

Restoration of the bomber began on 5 December 1984, at the [[Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility]] in [[Suitland-Silver Hill, Maryland]]. The propellers that were used on the bombing mission were later shipped to [[Texas A&M University]]. One of these propellers was trimmed to {{convert|12.5|ft}} for use in the university's Oran W. Nicks Low Speed Wind Tunnel. The lightweight aluminium variable-pitch propeller is powered by a 1,250 kVA electric motor providing a wind speed up to {{convert|200|mph}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.solarnavigator.net/aviation_and_space_travel/enola_gay.htm |title=Enola Gay |publisher=Solarnavigator.net |accessdate=10 November 2009}}</ref> Two engines were rebuilt at Garber and two at [[San Diego Air & Space Museum]]. The work was slow and meticulous. Every component was carefully cleaned. Some parts and instruments had been removed and could not be located. Replacements were found or fabricated, and marked so that future curators could distinguish them from the original components.{{sfn|Polmar|2004|p=60}}

Critics of the planned exhibit, especially those of the [[American Legion]] and the [[Air Force Association]], charged that the exhibit focused too much attention on the Japanese casualties inflicted by the nuclear bomb, rather than on the motivations for the bombing or the discussion of the bomb's role in ending the conflict with Japan.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.afa.org/media/enolagay/ |title=Enola Gay Archive: The Enola Gay and the Smithsonian |newspaper=Air Force Association |year=1996|accessdate=3 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Doyle |first=Debbie Ann |url=https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/december-2003/historians-protest-new-enola-gay-exhibit |title=Historians protest new Enola Gay exhibit |journal=Perspectives on History |issn=0743-7021 |volume=41 |issue=9 |date=December 2003 |accessdate=8 May 2015}}</ref> The exhibit brought to national attention many long-standing [[debate over the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|academic and political issues]] related to retrospective views of the bombings. As a result, after various failed attempts to revise the exhibit in order to meet the satisfaction of competing interest groups, the exhibit was canceled on 30 January 1995. [[Martin O. Harwit]], Director of the National Air and Space Museum, was compelled to resign over the controversy.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/21418541.html?dids=21418541:21418541&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=May+3%2C+1995&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&edition=&startpage=21&desc=Head+of+Air%2C+Space+Museum+Quits+Over+Enola+Gay+Exhibit |title=Head of Air, Space Museum Quits Over Enola Gay Exhibit |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=3 May 1995 |accessdate=25 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Meyer |first=Eugene L. |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/19559669.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=May+3%2C+1995&author=Eugene+L.+Meyer&desc=Air+and+Space+Museum+Chief+Resigns%3B+Harwit+Cites+Furor+Over+A-Bomb+Exhibit |title=Air and Space Museum Chief Resigns: Harwit Cites Furor Over A-Bomb Exhibit |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=3 May 1995 |accessdate=25 April 2013}}</ref>

The forward fuselage did go on display on 28 June 1995. On 2 July 1995, three people were arrested for throwing ash and human blood on the aircraft's fuselage, following an earlier incident in which a protester had thrown red paint over the gallery's carpeting.<ref>{{cite news |last=Correll |first=John T. |url=http://www.afa.org/media/enolagay/07-16.asp |title=Enola Gay Archive: Presenting the Enola Gay |newspaper=Air Force Association |date=August 1995 |p=19 |accessdate=8 August 2010}}</ref> The exhibition closed on 18 May 1998, and the fuselage was returned to the Garber Facility for final restoration.<ref name="Restoration"/>

===Complete restoration and display===
Restoration work began in 1984, and would eventually require 300,000 staff hours. While the fuselage was on display, from 1995 to 1998, work continued on the remaining unrestored components. The aircraft was shipped in pieces to the National Air and Space Museum's [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]] in  [[Chantilly, Virginia]] from March–June 2003, with the fuselage and wings reunited for the first time since 1960 on 10 April 2003<ref name="AirIll" /> and assembly completed on 8 August 2003. The aircraft is currently at [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] in the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, since the museum annex opened on 15 December 2003.<ref name="Restoration">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasm.si.edu/museum/garber/enola/enola.htm |title=Boeing B-29 'Superfortress': Enola Gay. |publisher=National air and Space Museum |accessdate=8 August 2010}}</ref>

<!--
As a result of the earlier controversy, the signage around the aircraft provides only the same succinct technical data as is provided for other aircraft in the museum, without discussion of the controversial issues. The aircraft is shielded by various means to prevent a repetition of the vandalism that was attempted when it was first placed on display. A [[video analytics]] system was installed in 2005 and multiple surveillance cameras automatically generate an alarm when any person or object approaches the aircraft. -->
