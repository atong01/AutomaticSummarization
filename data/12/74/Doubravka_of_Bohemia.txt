'''Doubravka of Bohemia''' or '''Dobrawa, Dąbrówka''' ({{lang-cs|'''[[Doubravka]] Přemyslovna'''}}, {{lang-pl|'''[[Dobrawa]] Przemyślidka''', '''[[Dąbrówka]] Przemyślidka'''}}) (ca. 940/45 – 977) was a [[Bohemia]]n princess of the [[Přemyslid dynasty]] and by marriage [[List of Polish consorts|Duchess of the Polans]].

She was the daughter of [[Boleslaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Boleslav I the Cruel]], Duke of [[Bohemia]], whose wife may have been the mysterious [[Biagota]].<ref name="BOHEMIA">{{MLCC |warning=1 |url=http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/BOHEMIA.htm#Dobrawadied977 |title-date= |title= BOHEMIA|date=August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Marek |first=Miroslav |url=http://genealogy.euweb.cz/bohemia/bohemia1.html#DB1 |title= Complete Genealogy of the Přemyslid dynasty |publisher=[http://genealogy.euweb.cz Genealogy.EU]}}{{Self-published source|date=August 2012}}{{Better source|date=August 2012}}</ref>

According to earlier sources, Dobrawa urged her husband [[Mieszko I of Poland]] to accept baptism in 966, the year after their marriage. Modern historians believe, however, that the change of religion by Mieszko was one of the points discussed in the Polish-Bohemian agreement concluded soon before his marriage with Dobrawa. Her role in his conversion is not considered now to be as important as it is often represented in medieval chronicles.

== Life ==
=== Date of birth ===
Dobrawa's date of birth is not known. The only indication is communicated by the chronicler [[Cosmas of Prague]], who stated that the Bohemian princess at the time of her marriage with Mieszko I was ''an old woman''.<ref>''Chronicle of Cosmas of Prague'': translated, introduction and commentary developed by Maria Wojciechowska, Warsaw 1968, lib. I cap. 27, p. 149.</ref> The passage is regarded as tendentious and of little reliability, and some researchers believe that the statement was made with malicious intent.<ref>H. Łowmiański, ''Religia Słowian i jej upadek'', Warsaw p. 338, footnote 889.</ref> It is possible that in the statement about Dobrawa's age, Cosmas was making a reference to the age difference between her and her sister Mlada. That would give him a basis for determining Dobrawa as "old." It{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} also found that Cosmas confuses Dobrawa with Mieszko I's second wife [[Oda von Haldensleben|Oda]], who at the time of her marriage was around 19–25 years old, a relatively advanced age for a bride according to the customs of the Middle Ages. Some researchers have taken up speculative views, such as [[Jerzy Strzelczyk]], who assumed that ''in the light of contemporary concepts and habits of marriage of that time (when as a rule marriages were contracted with teenage girls) is assumed that Dobrawa had passed her early youth, so, it's probable that she was in her late teens or twenties''.<ref>J. Strzelczyk, ''Bolesław Chrobry'', p. 15.</ref>

===Early years===
Nothing is known about Dobrawa's childhood and youth. In 1895 [[Oswald Balzer]] refuted reports that previous to her marriage with Mieszko I, Dobrawa was married to [[Gunther, Margrave of Merseburg]] and they had a son, [[Gunzelin, Margrave of Meissen|Gunzelin]]. This view is based on the fact that [[Thietmar of Merseburg]] in his chronicles named Gunzelin, Gunther's son, ''brother'' of Bolesław I the Brave, Dobrawa's son.<ref>''Thietmari chronicon'', vol. V, cap. 18, p. 274; vol. V, cap. 36, p. 300; vol. VI, cap. 54, p. 390.</ref> Currently, historians believed that Gunzelin and Bolesław I are in fact cousins or brothers-in-law.<ref>View, inter alia, of Herbert Ludat.</ref>

===Marriage with Mieszko I and role in the Christianization of Poland===
In the second half of 964<ref>Date fixed by H. Łowmiański, ''Początki Polski'', vol. V, p. 548.</ref>  an alliance between Boleslav I the Cruel, Duke of [[Bohemia]], and Mieszko I of [[Poland]] was concluded. In order to consolidate the agreement, in 965 Boleslav I's daughter Dobrawa was married to Mieszko I.  There was a difference of religion between the spouses; she was a Christian, he was a pagan.

Two independent sources attribute to Dobrawa an important role in the conversion to Christianity of Mieszko I and Poland. The first is the chronicles of Thietmar, who was born two years before the death of Dobrawa. He wrote that the Bohemian princess tried to persuade her husband to accept Christianity (even at the cost of breaking their marriage and with it the [[Polish-Bohemian Alliance]]). In the end, she finally obtained the conversion of Mieszko I and with him, of all Poland.<ref>''Thietmari chronicon'', vol. IV, cap. 56.</ref>

In turn, the 12th century chronicler [[Gallus Anonymus]] says that Dobrawa came to Poland surrounded by secular and religious dignitaries. She agreed to marry Mieszko I providing that he was baptized. The Polish ruler accepted, and only then was able to marry the Bohemian princess.

However, modern historians allege that the baptism of Mieszko I was dictated by political benefits and should not be attributed to any action of Dobrawa, who according to the modern view had virtually no role in the conversion of her husband.<ref>J. Dowiat, ''Metryka chrztu Mieszka I'', p. 79; Andrzej Feliks Grabski, ''Bolesław Chrobry. Zarys dziejów politycznych i wojskowych'', p. 26; S. Trawkowski, ''Monarchia Mieszka I i Bolesława Chrobrego,'' pp. 116-117; H. Łowmiański, ''Początki Polski'', vol. V, p. 549.</ref> They note that the conversion of Mieszko I thanks to Dobrawa formed part of the tradition of the Church which stressed the conversion of Pagan rulers through the influence of women.<ref>A. F. Grabski, ''Mieszko I'', Warsaw 1973, p. 93.</ref>

On the other hand, literature doesn't refuse to give Dobrawa a significant role in the Christianization of the Poles. In her wedding procession, she arrived in Poland with Christian clergymen, among them possibly [[Jordan (Bishop of Poland)|Jordan]], ordained the first [[Bishop of Poznań|Bishop of Poland]] in 968. Tradition attributes to Dobrawa the establishment of the Holy Trinity and St. Wit Churches in [[Gniezno]] and the Church of the Virgin Mary in [[Ostrów Tumski, Poznań|Ostrów Tumski]], [[Poznań]].

Dobrawa's marriage cemented the alliance of Mieszko I with Bohemia, which continued even after her death. On 21 September 967 Mieszko I was assisted by Bohemians in the decisive battle against the [[Wolinians]] led by [[Wichmann the Younger]].

When, after the death of [[Otto I the Great|Emperor Otto I]] in 973, a struggle for the supremacy in [[Germany]] began, both Dobrawa's husband and brother [[Boleslaus II, Duke of Bohemia|Boleslav II the Pious]], Duke of Bohemia, supported the same candidate for the German throne, Duke [[Henry II, Duke of Bavaria|Henry II of Bavaria]].

===Issue===
[[File:POL Warsaw Pałac Ursynów9.jpg|thumbnail|270px|right|Bust in the Krasinski palace, [[Ursynów]], [[Warsaw]]]]
The marriage of Mieszko I and Dobrawa produced three children:
# [[Bolesław I Chrobry|Bolesław I the Brave (''Chrobry'')]] (b. 967 - d. 17 June 1025).
# a daughter, perhaps named [[Świętosława]], perhaps identical to the legendary [[Sigrid the Haughty]] (b. 968/72 - d. ca. 1016), perhaps married firstly with [[Eric VI of Sweden|Eric the Victorious]], King of [[Sweden]], and later wife of [[Sweyn I of Denmark|Sweyn Forkbeard]], King of [[Denmark]], by whom she is said to have been mother of [[Canute the Great]], King of Denmark, [[Norway]] and [[England]]. [[Gunhilda of Poland]], who married Swyen I "Forkbeard", King of Denmark and England, is usually identified with Sigrid.
# There is an hypothesis asserting the existence of another daughter of Mieszko I who was married to a Pomeranian Slavic Prince. She could have been the daughter of either Dobrawa or one of Mieszko's previous pagan wives.<ref>According to one theory, this unnamed daughter of Mieszko I and her Pomeranian husband were the parents of [[Zemuzil, Duke of Pomerania]].</ref>
# Also, a theory has been advanced (apparently recorded by [[Thietmar of Prague|Thietmar]] and supported by [[Oswald Balzer]] in 1895) that [[Vladivoj, Duke of Bohemia|Vladivoj]] (c. 981 – January 1003), who ruled as Duke of [[Bohemia]] during 1002–1003, was another son of Dobrawa and Mieszko I.<ref name="BOHEMIA"/> Although modern historians have rejected this hypothesis,{{fact|date=February 2015}} Czech historiography has supported the notion of mixed Piast-Přemyslid parentage for Vladivoj.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Krzemieńska|first1= Barbara|authorlink1= |coauthors= |title= Břetislav I.: Čechy a střední Evropa v prvé polovině XI. století|trans_title= Bretislaus I: Bohemia and Central Europe in 1st Half of the 11th Century|edition= 2nd.|date= |year= 1999|month= |publisher= Garamond|location= Praha|language= Czech|isbn= 80-901760-7-0|pages= 28–29}}</ref>

===Death and burial===
Dobrawa died in 977. In his study of 1888, [[Józef Ignacy Kraszewski]] wrote that "her tomb was discovered in [[Gniezno Cathedral]].  It was a simple stone marked with a cross. Purple robes and a weighty gold loincloth were the only objects found in her tomb."<ref>J. I. Kraszewski, ''Wizerunki'', p. 12</ref> A similar view of Dobrawa's burial place was expressed earlier, in 1843, by [[Edward Raczyński (1786–1845)|Edward Raczyński]] in his study ''Wspomnienia Wielkopolski to jest województw poznańskiego, kaliskiego i gnieźnieńskiego'' (Memories of the Greater Poland districts of Poznań, Kalisz and Gniezno).<ref>E. Raczyński, ''Wspomnienia Wielkopolski to jest województw poznańskiego, kaliskiego i gnieźnieńskiego'', Poznań 1843, vol. II, pp 356-360.</ref> However, the burial place of the Bohemian princess is now considered to be unknown.<ref>K. Jasiński, ''Rodowód pierwszych Piastów'', p. 78.</ref>

Dobrawa's death weakened the [[Polish-Bohemian alliance]], which finally collapsed in the mid-980s.
