His economical and<space/><link><target>Iceberg Theory</target><part>understated</part></link><space/>style had a strong influence on<space/><link><target>20th century in literature</target><part>20th-century fiction</part></link>, while his life of adventure and his public image influenced later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and won the<space/><link><target>Nobel Prize in Literature</target></link><space/>in 1954. He published seven novels, six short story collections, and two non-fiction works. Additional works, including three novels, four short story collections, and three non-fiction works, were published posthumously. Many of his works are considered classics of<space/><link><target>American literature</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Hemingway was raised in<space/><link><target>Oak Park, Illinois</target></link>.
