==Philosophical views==
{{Criticism of Christianity sidebar}}
===Free will===
While he is a confirmed [[Compatibilism|compatibilist]] on [[free will]], in "On Giving Libertarians What They Say They Want"—Chapter 15 of his 1978 book ''[[Brainstorms]]'',<ref>''Brainstorms: Philosophical Essays on Mind and Psychology'', MIT Press (1978), pp. 286–299</ref> Dennett articulated the case for a two-stage model of decision making in contrast to [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian]] views.

<blockquote>The model of decision making I am proposing has the following feature: when we are faced with an important decision, a consideration-generator whose output is to some degree undetermined produces a series of considerations, some of which may of course be immediately rejected as irrelevant by the agent (consciously or unconsciously). Those considerations that are selected by the agent as having a more than negligible bearing on the decision then figure in a reasoning process, and if the agent is in the main reasonable, those considerations ultimately serve as predictors and explicators of the agent's final decision.<ref>''Brainstorms'', p. 295</ref></blockquote>

While other philosophers have developed two-stage models, including [[William James]], [[Henri Poincaré]], [[Arthur Holly Compton]], and [[Henry Margenau]], Dennett defends this model for the following reasons:

{{quote|
# First ... The intelligent selection, rejection, and weighing of the considerations that do occur to the subject is a matter of intelligence making the difference.
# Second, I think it installs indeterminism in the right place for the libertarian, if there is a right place at all.
# Third ... from the point of view of biological engineering, it is just more efficient and in the end more rational that decision making should occur in this way.
# A fourth observation in favor of the model is that it permits moral education to make a difference, without making all of the difference.
# Fifth—and I think this is perhaps the most important thing to be said in favor of this model—it provides some account of our important intuition that we are the authors of our moral decisions.
# Finally, the model I propose points to the multiplicity of decisions that encircle our moral decisions and suggests that in many cases our ultimate decision as to which way to act is less important phenomenologically as a contributor to our sense of free will than the prior decisions affecting our deliberation process itself: the decision, for instance, not to consider any further, to terminate deliberation; or the decision to ignore certain lines of inquiry.
}}

<blockquote>These prior and subsidiary decisions contribute, I think, to our sense of ourselves as responsible free agents, roughly in the following way: I am faced with an important decision to make, and after a certain amount of deliberation, I say to myself: "That's enough. I've considered this matter enough and now I'm going to act," in the full knowledge that I could have considered further, in the full knowledge that the eventualities may prove that I decided in error, but with the acceptance of responsibility in any case.<ref>''Brainstorms'', pp. 295–97</ref></blockquote>

Leading libertarian philosophers such as [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]] have rejected Dennett's model, specifically that random chance is directly involved in a decision, on the basis that they believe this eliminates the agent's motives and reasons, [[Moral character|character]] and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], and feelings and [[Desire (emotion)|desires]]. They claim that, if chance is the primary cause of decisions, then agents cannot be liable for resultant actions. Kane says:

<blockquote>[As Dennett admits,] a causal indeterminist view of this deliberative kind does not give us everything libertarians have wanted from free will. For [the agent] does not have complete control over what chance images and other thoughts enter his mind or influence his deliberation. They simply come as they please. [The agent] does have some control ''after'' the chance considerations have occurred.</blockquote>
<blockquote>But then there is no more chance involved. What happens from then on, how he reacts, is ''determined'' by desires and beliefs he already has. So it appears that he does not have control in the ''libertarian'' sense of what happens after the chance considerations occur as well. Libertarians require more than this for full responsibility and free will.<ref>Robert Kane, ''A Contemporary Introduction to Free Will'', Oxford (2005) pp. 64–5</ref></blockquote>

===Philosophy of mind===
Dennett has remarked in several places (such as "Self-portrait", in ''Brainchildren'') that his overall philosophical project has remained largely the same since his time at Oxford. He is primarily concerned with providing a philosophy of mind that is grounded in [[empirical]] research. In his original [[Thesis|dissertation]], ''Content and Consciousness'', he broke up the problem of explaining the mind into the need for a theory of content and for a theory of consciousness. His approach to this project has also stayed true to this distinction. Just as ''Content and Consciousness'' has a bipartite structure, he similarly divided ''Brainstorms'' into two sections. He would later collect several essays on content in ''The [[Intentional stance|Intentional Stance]]'' and synthesize his views on consciousness into a unified theory in ''[[Consciousness Explained]]''. These volumes respectively form the most extensive development of his views.<ref>{{citation |last=Guttenplan |first=Samuel |title=A Companion to the Philosophy of Mind |publisher=Blackwell |location=Oxford |year=1994 |pages=642 |isbn=0-631-19996-9}}</ref>

In chapter 5 of ''Consciousness Explained'' Dennett describes his [[multiple drafts model]] of consciousness. He states that, "all varieties of perception—indeed all varieties of thought or mental activity—are accomplished in the brain by parallel, multitrack processes of interpretation and elaboration of sensory inputs. Information entering the nervous system is under continuous 'editorial revision.'" (p.&nbsp;111). Later he asserts, "These yield, over the course of time, something ''rather like'' a narrative stream or sequence, which can be thought of as subject to continual editing by many processes distributed around the brain, ..." (p.&nbsp;135, emphasis in the original).

In this work, Dennett's interest in the ability of evolution to explain some of the content-producing features of consciousness is already apparent, and this has since become an integral part of his program. He defends a theory known by some as [[Neural Darwinism]]. He also presents an argument against [[qualia]]; he argues that the [[concept]] is so confused that it cannot be put to any use or understood in any non-contradictory way, and therefore does not constitute a valid refutation of [[physicalism]]. His strategy mirrors his teacher Ryle's approach of redefining first person phenomena in third person terms, and denying the coherence of the concepts which this approach struggles with.

Dennett self-identifies with a few terms: "[Others] note that my 'avoidance of the standard philosophical terminology for discussing such matters' often creates problems for me; philosophers have a hard time figuring out what I am saying and what I am denying. My refusal to play ball with my colleagues is deliberate, of course, since I view the standard philosophical terminology as worse than useless—a major obstacle to progress since it consists of so many errors."<ref>Daniel Dennett, ''The Message is: There is no Medium''</ref>

In ''Consciousness Explained'', he affirms "I am a sort of '[[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|teleofunctionalist]]', of course, perhaps the original teleofunctionalist'". He goes on to say, "I am ready to come out of the closet as some sort of [[Verificationism|verificationist]]".

===Evolutionary debate===
Much of Dennett's work since the 1990s has been concerned with fleshing out his previous ideas by addressing the same topics from an evolutionary standpoint, from what distinguishes human minds from animal minds (''Kinds of Minds''), to how free will is compatible with a naturalist view of the world (''[[Freedom Evolves]]'').

Dennett sees evolution by natural selection as an [[algorithmic]] process (though he spells out that algorithms as simple as [[long division]] often incorporate a significant degree of [[randomness]]).<ref>p. 52-60, ''Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life'' (Simon & Schuster; reprint edition 1996) (ISBN 0-684-82471-X)</ref> This idea is in conflict with the evolutionary philosophy of [[paleontologist]] [[Stephen Jay Gould]], who preferred to stress the "pluralism" of evolution (i.e., its dependence on many crucial factors, of which natural selection is only one).

Dennett's views on evolution are identified as being strongly [[Adaptationism|adaptationist]], in line with his theory of the [[intentional stance]], and the evolutionary views of [[biologist]] Richard Dawkins. In ''Darwin's Dangerous Idea'', Dennett showed himself even more willing than Dawkins to defend adaptationism in print, devoting an entire chapter to a criticism of the ideas of Gould.  This stems from Gould's long-running public debate with [[E. O. Wilson]] and other evolutionary biologists over human [[sociobiology]] and its descendant [[evolutionary psychology]], which Gould and [[Richard Lewontin]] opposed, but which Dennett advocated, together with Dawkins and [[Steven Pinker]].<ref>Although Dennett has expressed criticism of human sociobiology, calling it a form of "[[greedy reductionism]]", he is generally sympathetic towards the explanations proposed by [[evolutionary psychology]]. Gould also is not one sided, and writes: "Sociobiologists have broadened their range of selective stories by invoking concepts of [[inclusive fitness]] and [[kin selection]] to solve (successfully I think) the vexatious problem of altruism—previously the greatest stumbling block to a Darwinian theory of social behavior. . . . Here sociobiology has had and will continue to have success. And here I wish it well. For it represents an extension of basic Darwinism to a realm where it should apply." Gould, 1980. [http://www.ags.uci.edu/~mzyoung/p1.htm "Sociobiology and the Theory of Natural Selection"] In G. W. Barlow and J. Silverberg, eds., ''Sociobiology: Beyond Nature/Nurture?'' Boulder CO: Westview Press, pp. 257–269.</ref>  Strong disagreements have been launched against Dennett from Gould and his supporters, who allege that Dennett overstated his claims and misrepresented Gould's to reinforce what Gould describes as Dennett's "Darwinian fundamentalism".<ref>[http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Debate/Gould.html 'Evolution: The pleasures of Pluralism']&nbsp;— Stephen Jay Gould's review of ''Darwin's Dangerous Idea'', June 26, 1997</ref>

Dennett's theories have had a significant influence on the work of evolutionary psychologist [[Geoffrey Miller (evolutionary psychologist)|Geoffrey Miller]].

===An account of religion and morality===
In ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'', Dennett writes that evolution can account for the origin of morality. He rejects the idea of the [[naturalistic fallacy]] as the idea that ethics is in some free-floating realm, writing that the fallacy is to rush from facts to values.

In his 2006 book, ''[[Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon]]'', Dennett attempts to account for religious belief naturalistically, explaining possible evolutionary reasons for the phenomenon of religious adherence.
In this book he declares himself to be "[[Brights movement|a bright]]", and defends the term.

He has been doing research into clerics who are secretly atheists and how they rationalize their works. He found what he called a "Don't ask, don't tell" conspiracy because believers did not want to hear of loss of faith. That made unbelieving preachers feel isolated but they did not want to lose their jobs and sometimes their church-supplied lodgings and generally consoled themselves that they were doing good in their pastoral roles by providing comfort and required ritual.<ref name="Dennett2010">[http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/EP08122150.pdf Preachers who are not Believers (PDF)], Evolutionary Psychology, Vol. 8, Issue 1, March 2010, pp. 122–50, (ISSN 1474-7049).</ref> The research, with Linda LaScola, was further extended to include other denominations and non-Christian clerics.<ref>[http://traffic.libsyn.com/ffrf/FTradio_247_011511.mp3 Podcast: interview with Daniel Dennett. Further developments of the research: pastors, priests, and an Imam who are closet atheists].</ref>

===Other philosophical views===
He has also written about and advocated the notion of [[memetics]] as a philosophically useful tool, most recently in his "Brains, Computers, and Minds", a three-part presentation through Harvard's MBB 2009 Distinguished Lecture Series.

Dennett has been critical of [[postmodernism]], having said: "Postmodernism, the school of 'thought' that proclaimed 'There are no truths, only interpretations' has largely played itself out in absurdity, but it has left behind a generation of academics in the humanities disabled by their distrust of the very idea of truth and their disrespect for evidence, settling for 'conversations' in which nobody is wrong and nothing can be confirmed, only asserted with whatever style you can muster."<ref>DENNETT ON WIESELTIER V.
