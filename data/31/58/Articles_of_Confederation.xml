Foreign courts needed to have American grievances laid before them persuasively in a manifesto which could also reassure them that the Americans would be reliable trading partners.

Under the Articles, the states retained sovereignty over all governmental functions not specifically relinquished to the national government. The individual articles set the rules for current and future operations of the United States government. It was made capable of making war and peace, negotiating diplomatic and commercial agreements with foreign countries, and deciding disputes between the states, including their additional and contested western territories.

There was no president, no executive agencies, no judiciary and no tax base. The absence of a tax base meant that there was no way to pay off state and national debts from the war years except by requesting money from the states, which seldom arrived.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1788, with the approval of Congress, the Articles were replaced by the<space/><link><target>United States Constitution</target></link><space/>and the new government began operations in 1789.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last"><space/>Morris</arg><arg name="first"><space/>Richard</arg><arg name="title"><space/>The Forging of the Union, 1782–1789</arg><arg name="year"><space/>1988</arg><arg name="publisher"><space/>HarperCollins Publishers</arg><arg name="pages"><space/>245–66<space/></arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Ratification</heading><paragraph>Congress began to move for ratification of the Articles of Confederation in 1777:<extension extension_name='blockquote'>&quot;Permit us, then, earnestly to recommend these articles to the immediate and dispassionate attention of the legislatures of the respective states.

At what came to be known as the<space/><link><target>Annapolis Convention (1786)</target><part>Annapolis Convention</part></link>, the few state delegates in attendance endorsed a motion that called for all states to meet in<space/><link><target>Philadelphia</target></link><space/>in May 1787 to discuss ways to improve the Articles of Confederation in a &quot;Grand Convention.&quot; Although the states' representatives to the<space/><link><target>Constitutional Convention (United States)</target><part>Constitutional Convention</part></link><space/>in Philadelphia were only authorized to amend the Articles, the representatives held secret, closed-door sessions and wrote a new constitution. The new Constitution gave much more power to the central government, but characterization of the result is disputed. The general goal of the authors was to get close to a<space/><link><target>republic</target></link><space/>as defined by the philosophers of the<space/><link><target>Age of Enlightenment</target></link>, while trying to address the many difficulties of the interstate relationships. Historian Forrest McDonald, using the ideas of James Madison from<space/><italics>Federalist 39</italics>, describes the change this way:</paragraph><paragraph><template><target>quote</target><arg>The constitutional reallocation of powers created a new form of government, unprecedented under the sun. Every previous national authority either had been centralized or else had been a confederation of sovereign states. The new American system was neither one nor the other; it was a mixture of both.<ref>McDonald pg. 276</ref></arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>In May 1786,<space/><link><target>Charles Pinckney (governor)</target><part>Charles Pinckney</part></link><space/>of<space/><link><target>South Carolina</target></link><space/>proposed that Congress revise the Articles of Confederation. Recommended changes included granting<space/><link><target>United States Congress</target><part>Congress</part></link><space/>power over foreign and domestic commerce, and providing means for Congress to collect money from state treasuries. Unanimous approval was necessary to make the alterations, however, and Congress failed to reach a consensus. The weakness of the Articles in establishing an effective unifying government was underscored by the threat of internal conflict both within and between the states, especially after<space/><link><target>Shays' Rebellion</target></link><space/>threatened to topple the state government of Massachusetts.</paragraph><paragraph>Historian Ralph Ketcham comments on the opinions of<space/><link><target>Patrick Henry</target></link>,<space/><link><target>George Mason</target></link>, and other<space/><link><target>Anti-Federalism</target><part>antifederalists</part></link><space/>who were not so eager to give up the local autonomy won by the revolution:</paragraph><paragraph><template><target>quote</target><arg name="Antifederalists feared what Patrick Henry termed the "consolidated government" proposed by the new Constitution. They saw in Federalist hopes for commercial growth and international prestige only the lust of ambitious men for a "splendid empire" that, in the time-honored way of empires, would oppress the people with taxes, conscription, and military campaigns. Uncertain that any government over so vast a domain as the United States could be controlled by the people, Antifederalists saw in the enlarged powers of the general government only the familiar threats to the rights and liberties of the people.<ref>{{cite book| last"><space/>Ketcham| first<space/></arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Historians have given many reasons for the perceived need to replace the articles in 1787. Jillson and Wilson (1994) point to the financial weakness as well as the norms, rules and institutional structures of the Congress, and the propensity to divide along sectional lines.</paragraph><paragraph>Rakove (1988) identifies several factors that explain the collapse of the Confederation. The lack of compulsory direct taxation power was objectionable to those wanting a strong centralized state or expecting to benefit from such power. It could not collect customs after the war because tariffs were vetoed by<space/><link><target>Rhode Island</target></link>. Rakove concludes that their failure to implement national measures &quot;stemmed not from a heady sense of independence but rather from the enormous difficulties that all the states encountered in collecting taxes, mustering men, and gathering supplies from a war-weary populace.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>Rakove 1988 p. 230</extension><space/>The second group of factors Rakove identified derived from the substantive nature of the problems the Continental Congress confronted after 1783, especially the inability to create a strong foreign policy. Finally, the Confederation's lack of coercive power reduced the likelihood for profit to be made by political means, thus potential rulers were uninspired to seek power.</paragraph><paragraph>When the war ended in 1783, certain special interests had incentives to create a new &quot;merchant state,&quot; much like the British state people had rebelled against. In particular, holders of war scrip and land speculators wanted a central government to pay off scrip at face value and to legalize western land holdings with disputed claims. Also, manufacturers wanted a high tariff as a barrier to foreign goods, but competition among states made this impossible without a central government.<extension extension_name='ref'>Hendrickson p. 154</extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Legitimacy of closing down</heading><paragraph>Political scientist David C. Hendrickson writes that two prominent political leaders in the Confederation,<space/><link><target>John Jay</target></link><space/>of New York and<space/><link><target>Thomas Burke (governor)</target><part>Thomas Burke</part></link><space/>of North Carolina believed that &quot;the authority of the congress rested on the prior acts of the several states, to which the states gave their voluntary consent, and until those obligations were fulfilled, neither nullification of the authority of congress, exercising its due powers, nor secession from the compact itself was consistent with the terms of their original pledges.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>Hendrickson p. 153154</extension></paragraph><paragraph>According to Article XIII of the Confederation, any alteration had to be approved unanimously:<space/><extension extension_name='blockquote'>[T]he Articles of this Confederation shall be inviolably observed by every State, and the Union shall be perpetual; nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them; unless such alteration be agreed to in a Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every State.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>On the other hand, Article VII of the proposed Constitution stated that it would become effective after ratification by a mere nine states, without unanimity:<extension extension_name='blockquote'>The Ratification of the Conventions of nine States, shall be sufficient for the Establishment of this Constitution between the States so ratifying the Same.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>The apparent tension between these two provisions was addressed at the time, and remains a topic of scholarly discussion.
