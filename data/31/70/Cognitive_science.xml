An example would be the problem of remembering a phone number and recalling it later. One approach to understanding this process would be to study behavior through direct observation, or<space/><link><target>naturalistic observation</target></link>. A person could be presented with a phone number and be asked to recall it after some delay of time. Then, the accuracy of the response could be measured. Another approach to measure cognitive ability would be to study the firings of individual<space/><link><target>neuron</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>while a person is trying to remember the phone number. Neither of these experiments on its own would fully explain how the process of remembering a phone number works. Even if the technology to map out every neuron in the brain in real-time were available, and it were known when each neuron was firing, it would still be impossible to know how a particular firing of neurons translates into the observed behavior. Thus, an understanding of how these two levels relate to each other is imperative.<space/><italics>The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience</italics><space/>says, the new sciences of the mind need to enlarge their horizon to encompass both lived human experience and the possibilities for transformation inherent in human experience.<extension extension_name='ref'>Varela, F.

Language is acquired within the first few years of life, and all humans under normal circumstances are able to acquire language proficiently. A major driving force in the theoretical linguistic field is discovering the nature that language must have in the abstract in order to be learned in such a fashion. Some of the driving research questions in studying how the brain itself processes language include: (1) To what extent is linguistic knowledge innate or learned?, (2) Why is it more difficult for adults to acquire a second-language than it is for infants to acquire their first-language?, and (3) How are humans able to understand novel sentences?</paragraph><paragraph>The study of language processing ranges from the investigation of the sound patterns of speech to the meaning of words and whole sentences.<space/><link><target>Linguistics</target></link><space/>often divides language processing into<space/><link><target>orthography</target></link>,<space/><link><target>phonetics</target></link>,<space/><link><target>phonology</target></link>,<space/><link><target>morphology (linguistics)</target><part>morphology</part></link>,<space/><link><target>syntax</target></link>,<space/><link><target>semantics</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>pragmatics</target></link>.

Linguistics was traditionally studied as a part of the humanities, including studies of history, art and literature. In the last fifty years or so, more and more researchers have studied knowledge and use of language as a cognitive phenomenon, the main problems being how knowledge of language can be acquired and used, and what precisely it consists of.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="first">Daniela<space/></arg><arg name="last">Isac<space/></arg><arg name="author2">Charles Reiss<space/></arg><arg name="title"><space/>I-language: An Introduction to Linguistics as Cognitive Science, 2nd edition<space/></arg><arg name="url"><space/>http://linguistics.concordia.ca/i-language/<space/></arg><arg name="year">2013</arg><arg name="page">5<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Oxford University Press<space/></arg><arg name="isbn">978-0199660179</arg></template></extension><space/><link><target>Linguistics</target><part>Linguists</part></link><space/>have found that, while humans form sentences in ways apparently governed by very complex systems, they are remarkably unaware of the rules that govern their own speech.

Infants are born with little or no knowledge (depending on how knowledge is defined), yet they rapidly acquire the ability to use language, walk, and recognize people and objects. Research in learning and development aims to explain the mechanisms by which these processes might take place.</paragraph><paragraph>A major question in the study of cognitive development is the extent to which certain abilities are<space/><link><target>innate</target></link><space/>or learned. This is often framed in terms of the<space/><link><target>nature and nurture</target></link><space/>debate. The<space/><link><target>Psychological nativism</target><part>nativist</part></link><space/>view emphasizes that certain features are innate to an organism and are determined by its<space/><link><target>genetics</target><part>genetic</part></link><space/>endowment. The<space/><link><target>Empiricism</target><part>empiricist</part></link><space/>view, on the other hand, emphasizes that certain abilities are learned from the environment. Although clearly both genetic and environmental input is needed for a child to develop normally, considerable debate remains about<space/><italics>how</italics><space/>genetic information might guide cognitive development. In the area of<space/><link><target>language acquisition</target></link>, for example, some (such as<space/><link><target>Steven Pinker</target></link>)<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Cite journal</target><arg name="author">Pinker S., Bloom P.</arg><arg name="title">Natural language and natural selection</arg><arg name="year">1990</arg><arg name="journal">Behavioral and Brain Sciences</arg><arg name="issue">4</arg><arg name="pages">707â€“784</arg><arg name="volume">13</arg><arg name="doi">10.1017/S0140525X00081061</arg></template></extension><space/>have argued that specific information containing universal grammatical rules must be contained in the genes, whereas others (such as Jeffrey Elman and colleagues in<space/><link><target>Rethinking Innateness</target></link>) have argued that Pinker's claims are biologically unrealistic.

Computational modeling can help us understand the functional organization of a particular cognitive phenomenon.There are two basic approaches to cognitive modeling. The first is focused on abstract mental functions of an intelligent mind and operates using symbols, and the second, which follows the neural and associative properties of the human brain, is called subsymbolic.</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><italics>Symbolic modeling</italics><space/>evolved from the computer science paradigms using the technologies of<space/><link><target>Knowledge-based systems</target></link>, as well as a philosophical perspective, see for example &quot;Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence&quot; (<link><target>GOFAI</target></link>). They are developed by the first cognitive researchers and later used in<space/><link><target>information engineering</target></link><space/>for<space/><link><target>expert system</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>. Since the early 1990s it was generalized in<space/><link><target>systemics</target></link><space/>for the investigation of functional human-like intelligence models, such as<space/><link><target>personoid</target><trail>s</trail></link>, and, in parallel, developed as the<space/><link><target>Soar (cognitive architecture)</target><part>SOAR</part></link><space/>environment.

Researchers such as<space/><link><target>Marvin Minsky</target></link><space/>would write computer programs in languages such as<space/><link><target>LISP</target></link><space/>to attempt to formally characterize the steps that human beings went through, for instance, in making decisions and solving problems, in the hope of better understanding human<space/><link><target>thought</target></link>, and also in the hope of creating artificial minds. This approach is known as &quot;symbolic AI&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>Eventually the limits of the symbolic AI research program became apparent. For instance, it seemed to be unrealistic to comprehensively list human knowledge in a form usable by a symbolic computer program. The late 80s and 90s saw the rise of<space/><link><target>neural networks</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>connectionism</target></link><space/>as a research paradigm. Under this point of view, often attributed to<space/><link><target>James McClelland (psychologist)</target><part>James McClelland</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>David Rumelhart</target></link>, the mind could be characterized as a set of complex associations, represented as a layered network. Critics argue that there are some phenomena which are better captured by symbolic models, and that connectionist models are often so complex as to have little explanatory power. Recently symbolic and connectionist models have been combined, making it possible to take advantage of both forms of explanation.<extension extension_name='ref'><link><target>Artur S. d'Avila Garcez</target></link>, Luis C.
