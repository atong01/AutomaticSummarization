Drum and bass subgenres include [[breakcore]], [[ragga jungle]], [[hardstep]], [[darkstep]], [[techstep]], [[Neurofunk]], ambient drum and bass, [[liquid funk]], deep, drumfunk, [[funkstep]], [[sambass]] dnbnoise and drill and bass. Despite its roots in the UK, the style has established itself around the world. Drum and bass has influenced many other genres like [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[big beat]], [[dubstep]], [[house music]], [[trip hop]], [[ambient music]], [[techno]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music|pop]]. Drum and bass is dominated by a small group of record labels. The major international music labels have shown very little interest in the drum and bass scene. Drum and Bass remains most popular in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], but has developed scenes all around the world, including in [[The netherlands|The Netherlands]] and [[New Zealand]].

==History==
{{Main|History of drum and bass}}
''See also:'' ''[[Oldschool jungle|Oldskool Jungle]]

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, a growing [[nightclub]] and overnight outdoor event culture gave birth to a new electronic music style called [[rave music]], which, much like [[Hip-hop music|hip-hop]], combined sampled [[syncopated]] beats or breakbeats, other samples from a wide range of different musical genres and, occasionally, samples of music, dialogue and effects from films and television programmes. But rave music tended to feature stronger bass sounds and a faster tempo (127 to over 140) [[Tempo|beats per minute]] (BPM) than that of early house music. This subgenre was known as "hardcore" rave but from as early as 1991, some musical tracks made up of these high-tempo break beats, with heavy basslines and samples of older Jamaican music, were referred to as "jungle [[techno]]", a genre influenced by [[Jack Smooth]] and Basement Records, and later just "jungle", which became recognized as a separate musical genre popular at raves and on [[pirate radio]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. It is important to note when discussing the history of Drum n Bass that prior to Jungle, rave music was getting faster and more experimental. Professional DJ & producer C.K. states, "There was a progression as far as the speed of music is concerned. Anyone buying vinyl every week from 1989 to 1992 noticed this."

By 1994 jungle had begun to gain mainstream popularity and fans of the music (often referred to as [[junglist]]s) became a more recognizable part of youth subculture. The genre further developed, incorporating and fusing elements from a wide range of existing musical genres, including the [[raggamuffin music|raggamuffin]] sound, [[dancehall]], [[Rapping|MC]] chants, dub basslines, and increasingly complex, heavily edited breakbeat percussion. Despite the affiliation with the ecstasy-fuelled rave scene, Jungle also inherited some associations with violence and criminal activity, both from the gang culture that had affected the UK's hip-hop scene and as a consequence of jungle's often aggressive or menacing sound and themes of violence (usually reflected in the choice of samples). However, this developed in tandem with the often positive reputation of the music as part of the wider rave scene and dancehall-based Jamaican music culture prevalent in London. By 1995, whether as a reaction to, or independently of this cultural schism, some jungle producers began to move away from the ragga-influenced style and create what would become collectively labelled, for convenience, as drum and bass.<ref>{{Cite book

As the genre became generally more polished and sophisticated technically, it began to expand its reach from pirate radio to commercial stations and gain widespread acceptance (circa 1995–1997). It also began to split into recognizable subgenres such as jump-up and [[Hardstep]]. As a [[intelligent drum and bass|lighter and often jazz-influenced style]] of drum and bass gained mainstream appeal, additional subgenres emerged including [[techstep]] (circa 1996–1997) which drew greater influence from [[techno]] music and the [[soundscape]]s of science fiction and [[anime]] films.

The popularity of drum and bass at its commercial peak ran parallel to several other homegrown dance styles in the UK including [[big beat]] and [[hard house]]. But towards the turn of the millennium its popularity was deemed to have dwindled as the [[UK garage]] style known as [[speed garage]] yielded several hit singles. Speed garage shared high tempos and heavy basslines with drum and bass, but otherwise followed the established conventions of "house music", with this and its freshness giving it an advantage commercially. London DJ/producer C.K. says, "It is often forgotten by my students that a type of music called "[[garage house]]" existed in the late 1980s alongside [[hip house]], [[acid house]] and other forms of house music." He continues, "This new garage of the mid 90s was not a form of house or a progression of garage house. The beats and tempo that define house are entirely different. This did cause further confusion in the presence of new house music of the mid-1990s being played alongside what was now being called garage." Despite this, the emergence of further subgenres and related styles such as [[liquid funk]] brought a wave of new artists incorporating new ideas and techniques, supporting continual evolution of the genre. To this day drum and bass makes frequent appearances in mainstream media and popular culture including in [[television]], as well as being a major reference point for subsequent genres such as [[Grime (music)|grime]] and [[dubstep]]<ref name="Global Bass landscape">[http://rhythmtravels.com/music/global-bass Global Bass on the music landscape]</ref> and successful artists including [[Chase & Status]] and Australia's [[Pendulum (band)|Pendulum]].

Drum and bass incorporates a number of scenes and styles, from the highly electronic, [[industrial music|industrial]] sounds of techstep through to the use of conventional, acoustic instrumentation that characterise the more jazz-influenced end of the spectrum.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="SimonReynoldsOnTechstep"/> The sounds of drum and bass are extremely varied due to the range of influences behind the music.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Drum and bass could at one time be defined as a strictly electronic musical genre with the only "live" element being the DJ's selection and mixing of records during a set. "Live" drum and bass using electric, electronic and acoustic instruments played by musicians on stage emerged over the ensuing years of the genre's development.<ref>New Dawn – City Clubs Take Back The Night article, ''Village Voice'', February 27, 2001</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?SectionID=1031&uid=&MagID=1059&ReviewID=1696&PageNumber=1 | title = Knowledge Magazine Article mentioning rise of live drum and bass in 2004| accessdate = October 18, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1655&PageNumber=1&SectionID=1031 | title = Knowledge Magazine Article on live drum and bass bands| accessdate = October 18, 2006}}</ref>

===Influences===
A very obvious and strong influence on jungle and drum and bass, thanks to the [[British African-Caribbean community|British African-Caribbean]] [[sound system (DJ)|sound system]] scene, is the original Jamaican [[dub music|dub]] and [[reggae]] sound, with pioneers like [[King Tubby]], [[Peter Tosh]], [[Sly & Robbie]], [[Bill Laswell]], [[Lee "Scratch" Perry|Lee Perry]], [[Mad Professor]], [[Roots Radics]], [[Bob Marley]] and [[Buju Banton]] heavily influencing the music.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.planetdnb.com/dnb_interviews921.php | title = NJC–Sativa Records interview by Dhanu Le Noury at planetdnb.com| accessdate = September 6, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060510074142/http://www.planetdnb.com/dnb_interviews921.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = May 10, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.tranzfusion.net/articles/shownews.asp?newsid=4873 | title = A Guy Called Gerald's Silent Drum & Bass Protest by Benedetta Skrufff at tranzfusion.net|accessdate = September 6, 2006}}</ref> This influence has lessened with time but is still evident with many tracks containing ragga vocals.

[[Kevin Saunderson]] released a series of bass-heavy, minimal techno cuts as Reese/The Reese Project in the late '80s which were hugely influential in drum and bass terms. One of his more famous basslines (Reese – "Just Want Another Chance", Incognito Records, 1988) was indeed sampled on Renegade's ''Terrorist'' and countless others since, being known simply as the 'Reese' bassline. He followed these up with equally influential (and bassline-heavy) tracks in the UK hardcore style as Tronik House in 1991–1992. Another Detroit artist who was important for the scene is [[Carl Craig]]. The sampled-up jazz break on Carl Craig's ''Bug in the Bassbin'' was also influential on the newly emerging sound, DJs at the Rage club used to play it pitched up (increased speed) as far as their Technics record decks would go.<ref name="Fabio">{{Cite web| url = http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/TUTORS.9.0.html?act_session=273 | publisher=Red Bull Academy | title = Fabio interview – The Root To The Shoot| accessdate = September 4, 2007}}</ref>

By the late 1980s and early 1990s the tradition of breakbeat use in hip hop production had influenced the sound of [[breakbeat hardcore]], which in turn led to the emergence of jungle, drum and bass, and other genres that shared the same use of broken beats.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.native-instruments.com/index.php?id=photek2_us | title = Photek interview |publisher= native-instruments.com| accessdate = September 6, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060320042140/http://www.native-instruments.com/index.php?id=photek2_us <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = March 20, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.planetdnb.com/dnb_interviews1196.php | title = MC XYZ interview at planetdnb.com|accessdate = September 6, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060510074154/http://www.planetdnb.com/dnb_interviews1196.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = May 10, 2006}}</ref>  Drum and bass shares many musical characteristics with hip-hop, though it is nowadays mostly stripped of lyrics. [[Grandmaster Flash]], [[Roger Troutman]], [[Afrika Bambaata]], [[Run DMC]], [[Mac Dre]], [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], [[Schooly D]], [[N.W.A]], [[Kid Frost]], [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[Mos Def]], [[Beastie Boys]] and the [[Pharcyde]] are very often directly sampled, regardless of their general influence.<ref name="Zinc">{{Cite web| url = http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/TUTORS.9.0.html?act_session=242 | title = Zinc interview – Hardware Bingo| publisher= Red Bull Academy | accessdate = September 4, 2007}}</ref>

Clearly drum and bass has been influenced by other music genres, though influences from sources external to the [[electronic dance music]] scene perhaps lessened following the shifts from jungle to drum and bass, and through to so-called "intelligent drum and bass" and techstep.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weeklydig.com/music/articles/nookie |title=NOOKIE |first=Noah |last=Horton |publisher=weeklydig.com |accessdate=September 6, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20080519080539/http://www.weeklydig.com:80/music/articles/nookie |archivedate=19 May 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.nigelberman.co.uk/feature1_nov2002.htm | title = Goldie article | work= Insight | first= Nigel |last= Berman |year= 2002| publisher= Nigel Berman |accessdate = September 6, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1343&PageNumber=1&SectionID=1031 | title = LTJ Bukem | publisher= knowledgemag.co.uk| accessdate = September 6, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.020.com/webs/02006/london/showArticle_london.cfm?id=384 | title = History of drum & bass on London News| accessdate = January 18, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1691&PageNumber=1&SectionID=1031 | title = Klute |publisher= knowledgemag.co.uk| accessdate = September 6, 2006}}</ref> It still remains a fusion music style.

Some tracks are illegally remixed and released on [[white label]] (technically bootleg), often to acclaim. For example, DJ Zinc's remix of [[The Fugees]]' "[[Ready or Not (Fugees song)|Ready or Not]]", also known as "Fugee Or Not", was eventually released with the Fugees' permission after talk of legal action, though ironically the Fugees' version infringed [[Enya]]'s copyright to an earlier song.<ref name = "Zinc"/><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.discogs.com/release/219368 | title = Discogs.com entry on Ready Or Not remixes| accessdate = April 9, 2007}}</ref> White labels along with [[dubplate]]s play an important part in drum and bass musical culture.

===Drum and bassline elements===
The genre places great importance on the "bass line", a deep [[sub-bass]] musical pattern which can be felt physically through powerful sound systems due to the low-range frequencies favoured. There has been considerable exploration of different [[timbre]]s in the bass line region, particularly within [[techstep]]. The bass lines most notably originate from [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] sources or [[synthesizer]]s. Bass lines performed with a bass instrument, whether it is electric, acoustic or a [[double bass]], are less common but examples can be found in the work of bands such as [[Shapeshifter (band)|Shapeshifter]], [[Squarepusher]], [[Roni Size]] and [[STS9]].

[[File:Roland TR-808 drum machine.jpg|thumb|The Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer, produced 1980–1984, had a bass drum sound which became very important in Drum and bass.]]
Of equal importance is the TR-808 kick drum, an artificially pitch-downed or elongated [[bass drum]] sound sampled from Roland's classic [[TR-808]] drum machine, and a sound which has been subject to an enormous amount of experimentation over the years.<ref name="TR-808">{{Cite web| url = http://www.synthmuseum.com/roland/roltr80801.html | title = TR-808| accessdate = December 24, 2006}}</ref>

The complex [[syncopation]] of the drum tracks' [[break (music)|breakbeat]], is another facet of production on which producers can spend a very large amount of time. The [[Amen break]] is generally acknowledged to have been the most-used (and often considered the most powerful) break in drum and bass.<ref name="Amen Break video on youtube.com"/>

The Amen break was synonymous with early drum and bass productions but other samples have had a significant impact, including the [[Apache (single)|Apache]], [[Funky Drummer]], "Soul Pride", "Scorpio" and "[[Think (About It)]]" breaks.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?SectionID=1031&uid=&MagID=1062&ReviewID=1684&PageNumber=1 | title = Forever And Ever Amen article on knowledgemag.co.uk| accessdate = September 6, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.junglebreaks.co.uk/breaks.html | title = junglebreaks.co.uk| accessdate = August 15, 2010}}</ref>

Many drum and bass tracks have featured more than one sampled breakbeat in them and a technique of switching between two breaks after each bar developed. Examples of this can be heard on mid-90s releases such as [[J Majik]]'s "Your Sound". A more recent commonly used break is the [[Tramen]], which combines the [[Amen break]], a [[James Brown]] funk breakbeat ("[[Tighten Up (Archie Bell & the Drells song)|Tighten Up]]" or "Samurai" break) and an [[Alex Reece]] drum and bass breakbeat.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1610&PageNumber=1&SectionID=1031 | title = Dom & Roland interview by Ben Willmott at knowledgemag.co.uk| accessdate = September 6, 2006}}</ref>

The relatively fast drum beat forms a canvas on which a producer can create tracks to appeal to almost any taste and often will form only a background to the other elements of the music. [[Syncopated]] breakbeats remain the most distinctive element as without these a high-tempo [[Time signature|4/4]] dance track could be classified as [[techno]] or [[gabber]].<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://store.drumbum.com/drums/drum-n-bass-drum-and-bass.htm | title = Life in The Fast Lane: An Overview of Drum and Bass by George Broyer at drumbum.com| accessdate = September 6, 2006}}</ref>

===Tempo===
Drum and bass is usually between 160–180 BPM, in contrast to other [[breakbeat]]-based dance styles such as [[nu skool breaks]], which maintain a slower pace at around 130–140 BPM. A general upward trend in tempo has been observed during the evolution of drum and bass. The earliest forms of drum and bass clocked in at around 130 bpm in 1990/1991, speeding up to around 155–165 BPM by 1993. Since around 1996, drum and bass tempos have predominantly stayed in the 170–180 range. Recently some producers have started to once again produce tracks with slower tempos (that is, in the 150s and 160s), but the mid-170 tempo is still the hallmark of the drum and bass sound.<ref name = "Fabio"/><ref name = "Zinc"/>

A track combining the same elements (broken beat, bass, production techniques) as a drum and bass track, but with a slower tempo (say 140 BPM), might not be drum and bass but a drum and bass-influenced breakbeat track.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_drumnbasspioneer_rob_playford/ | title = Remix Mag Interview with Rob Playford, drum and bass pioneer at remixmag.com| accessdate = October 5, 2006}}</ref>

===Context===
[[File:Valvesoundsystem.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pendulum (band)|Pendulum]] playing the Valve Sound System with MC IC3 at the Tuesday Club, Sheffield 05/03/06]]
Drum and bass exhibits a full frequency response which can only be appreciated on sound systems which can handle very low frequencies. As befits its name, the bass element of the music is particularly pronounced, with the comparatively sparse arrangements of drum and bass tracks allowing room for basslines that are deeper than most other forms of dance music. Consequently, drum and bass parties are often advertised as featuring uncommonly loud and bass-heavy sound systems.

There are however many albums specifically designed for personal listening. The mix CD is a particularly popular form of release, with a big name DJ/producer mixing live, or on a computer, a variety of tracks for personal listening. Additionally, there are many albums containing unmixed tracks, suited for home or car listening.<ref>"The Good Life, No Such Thing As Society", ''The Independent'', July 23, 2003</ref>

Many mixing points begin or end with the "[[drop (music)|drop]]". The drop is the point in a track where a switch of rhythm or bassline occurs and usually follows a recognizable build section and "[[breakdown (music)|breakdown]]". Sometimes the drop is used to switch between tracks, layering components of different tracks, though as the two records may be simply ambient breakdowns at this point, though some DJs prefer to combine breakbeats, a more difficult exercise. Some drops are so popular that the DJ will "rewind" or "reload" or "lift up" by spinning the record back and restarting it at the build. "The drop" is often a key point from the point of view of the dancefloor, since the drumbreaks often fade out to leave an ambient intro playing. When the beats re-commence they are often more complex and accompanied by a heavier bassline, encouraging the crowd to dance.

===Live drum and bass===
[[File:Pirate station moscow 2009.jpg|thumb|300px|Aphrodite in 2009 at [[Pirate Station]], the world's largest drum and bass festival, in Moscow.]]
Many musicians have adapted drum and bass to live performances, which feature instruments such as [[Drum kit|drums]] (acoustic or electronic), [[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]], [[synthesizers]], [[turntables]], [[bass (instrument)|bass]] (either [[upright bass|upright]] or electric) and [[guitar]]s (acoustic or electric). [[Sampler (musical instrument)|Samplers]] have also been used live by assigning samples to a specific drum pad or key on [[Roland V-Drums|drum pads]] or synthesizers. [[MC]]s are frequently featured in live performances.

==Subgenres==
[[File:Congo Natty 2.jpg|thumb|140px|Congo Natty, a ragga jungle artist]]
Smaller scenes within the drum and bass community have developed and the scene as a whole has become much more fractured into specific subgenres, including:
* [[Drumstep]] is a combination of drum and bass and dubstep where the beat structure is [[half-time (music)|half time]], the remaining elements still adhere to the usual tempo and melody pattern style from drum and bass.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://producingelectronicmusic.com/2012/12/07/dubstep-drumstep-and-dnb/| title=Dubstep, Drumstep, and DNB  | work=Brad Bator | number= | date=31 March 2011 | accessdate= 31 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url=https://news.beatport.com/wtf-is-drumstep/| title=WTF is Drumstep? | work=The Beatport Team | number= | date=4 Feb 2011 | accessdate= 31 July 2015}}</ref>

===Regional scenes===
Despite its roots in the UK, which can still be treated as the "home" of drum and bass, the style has firmly established itself around the world. There are strong scenes in other English-speaking countries including Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United States and, New Zealand.<ref>"Drum & Bass Keeps The Beat", ''Boston Globe'', February 6, 2003.</ref> It is popular throughout continental Europe, and in South America. [[São Paulo]] is sometimes called the drum and bass [[Ibiza]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Brazilian drum and bass is sometimes referred to as "[[sambass]]", with its specific style and sound. In Venezuela and Mexico, artists have created their own forms of drum and bass combining it with experimental musical forms. In Colombia there is a large underground scene, The RE.set Label and Bogotá Project are two collectives that put on DnB events in the city, as well as a twice yearly event called Radikal Styles, that brings together local talent and international big names.

===Genres influenced by drum and bass===
Born around the same time as jungle, [[breakcore]] and [[digital hardcore]] share many of the elements of drum and bass and to the uninitiated, tracks from the extreme end of drum and bass, may sound identical to breakcore thanks to speed, complexity, impact and maximum sonic density combined with musical experimentation. German Drum and Bass DJ [[The Panacea]] is also one of the leading Digital Hardcore artists. [[Raggacore]] resembles a faster version of the ragga influenced jungle music of the 1990s, similar to breakcore but with more friendly [[dancehall]] beats (dancehall itself being a very important influence on drum and bass).<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.lfodemon.com/raggacorearticle/index.htm | title = Raggacore article on lfodemon.com|accessdate = September 6, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070217064746/http://www.lfodemon.com/raggacorearticle/index.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = February 17, 2007}}</ref> [[Darkcore]], a direct influence on drum and bass, was combined with influences of drum and bass itself leading to the creation of [[darkstep]]. There is considerable crossover from the extreme edges of drum and bass, breakcore, darkcore, digital hardcore and raggacore with fluid boundaries.

The genre has influenced many other genres like [[hip hop]], [[big beat]], [[dubstep]], [[house music]], [[trip hop]], [[ambient music]], [[techno]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music|pop]], with artists such as [[Bill Laswell]], [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]], [[Pitchshifter (band)|Pitchshifter]], [[Linkin Park]], [[The Roots]], [[Talvin Singh]], [[MIDIval Punditz]], [[Missy Elliott]], [[The Freestylers]], [[Bowery Electric]], [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[David Bowie]] (the last two both using elements of Goldie's "Timeless"){{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} and others quoting drum and bass and using drum and bass techniques and elements. The USA has adopted the sound with a genre called [[ghettotech]] which have synth and basslines similar to drum & bass.<ref name="Fabio">{{Cite web| url = http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/TUTORS.9.0.html?act_session=290 | title = Red Bull Academy Interview Fabio – The Root To The Shoot| accessdate = September 4, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1278&PageNumber=1&SectionID=1031 | title = A Guy Called Gerald feature at knowledgemag.co.uk|accessdate = September 6, 2006}}</ref><ref name="Playford">{{Cite web| url = http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_drumnbasspioneer_rob_playford/ | title = Remix Mag Interview with Rob Playford, drum and bass pioneer at remixmag.com|accessdate = October 5, 2006}}</ref><ref name="Popular">{{Cite web| url = http://www.popular-musicology-online.com/issues/02/missingham.html | title = "Popular Musicology On Line Article "Big Tings Ah Gwan": Junglist Music Takes Centre Stage, An Introduction to Jungle Music And An Enquiry Into Its Impact On The London Jazz Scene"| accessdate = September 4, 2007}}</ref><ref name="allmusic">{{Cite web| url = {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p24040/biography|pure_url=yes}} | title = Pitchshifter biography| accessdate = May 16, 2009}}</ref>

==Record labels==
{{See also|Category:Drum and bass record labels}}

Drum and Bass is dominated by a small group of record labels. These are run mainly by DJ–producers, such as [[London Elektricity]]'s [[Hospital Records]], [[Andy C]]'s [[Ram Records (UK)|Ram]],<ref name="ramrecords.com">http://ramrecords.com/about-ram</ref> [[Goldie]]'s [[Metalheadz]], Basement Records ([[Jack Smooth]]), Chris Renegade's [[Lifted Music]], [[DJ Friction (UK)|DJ Friction]]'s Shogun Audio,<ref>http://www.shogunaudio.co.uk/about-us.php</ref> [[DJ Fresh]]'s [[Breakbeat Kaos]], [[Futurebound]]'s [[Viper Recordings]] and [[DJ Hype]], Pascal and formerly [[DJ Zinc]]'s [[True Playaz]] (now known as Real Playaz as of 2006).<ref>https://www.facebook.com/playazrecordings?sk=info,</ref>

The major international music labels such as [[Sony Music]] and [[Universal Music Group|Universal]] have shown very little interest in the drum and bass scene though there have been a few signings, most recently [[Pendulum (band)|Pendulum]]'s ''[[In Silico (Pendulum album)|In Silico]]'' LP to Warner. Roni Size's [[Full Cycle Records]] played a big, if not the biggest, part in the creation of Drum and Bass with their dark, baseline sounds. [[V Recordings]] also played a large part of the development of drum and bass.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Roni Size, Krust and DJ Die produced some of the first tracks to be considered{{who|date=March 2015}} mainstream drum and bass tracks.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

[[Ram Records (UK)|Ram Records]] has been pushing the boundaries of drum and bass further into the mainstream with artists such as [[Chase and Status]] and [[Sub Focus]].<ref name="ramrecords.com"/>  Bringing back UK [[Oldschool jungle|jungle music]] artists from [[LTJ Bukem]]'s label [[Good Looking]] artists Bay B Kane, [[breakbeat hardcore]] heavyweight Nebula II and original [[junglist]] Gappa G . Other Bristol labels such as Cafe Bass have also helped to push through a sound categorised as 'bass music' with the help of influential artists such as Lone Ranger.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Formats and distribution==

===Purchasing===
Originally drum and bass was mostly sold in 12-inch [[vinyl record|vinyl]] single format. With the emergence of drum and bass into mainstream music markets, more albums, compilations and [[DJ mixes]] started to be sold on CDs. As digital music became more popular, websites focused on electronic music, such as [[Beatport]], began to sell drum and bass in digital format.

===Distributors (wholesale)===
The bulk of drum and bass vinyl records and CDs are distributed globally and regionally by a relatively small number of companies such as SRD (Southern Record Distributors), ST Holdings, & Nu Urban.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1574&PageNumber=1&SectionID=1031 | title = Distribution feature at knowledgemag.co.uk| accessdate = September 6, 2006}}</ref>

As of 11 September 2012, Nu Urban Music Limited ceased trading and RSM Tenon were instructed to assist in convening statutory meetings of members and creditors to appoint a liquidator. This left many labels short on sales as Nu Urban were one of the main Distributors for the vinyl market in the drum and bass scene.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.nu-urbanmusic.co.uk | title = Announcement of bankruptcy on nu-urbanmusic.co.uk | accessdate = September 21, 2012}}</ref>

==Media presence==
Today, drum and bass is widely promoted throughout the world using different methods such as [[video sharing service]]s ([[YouTube]], [[Dailymotion]]), [[blog]]s, [[radio]] and [[television]], the latter being the most uncommon method. More recently, music networking websites such as [[SoundCloud]] and MixCloud have become powerful tools for artist recognition, providing a vast platform that enables quick responses to new tracks. Record labels have adopted the use of [[Podcast]]s. Prior to the rise of the internet, drum and bass was commonly broadcast over [[pirate radio]].

===Radio===
The three highest profile radio stations playing drum and bass shows are [[BBC Radio 1]] with The Drum and Bass Show with [[DJ Friction (UK)|Friction]], simulcast in the US and Canada on Sirius XM, and [[DJ Hype]] on [[Kiss 100 London|Kiss 100]] in London.

The BBC's "urban" station [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]] used to feature the genre heavily, with DJ Bailey (show axed as of 29/08/2012) and Crissy Criss (show axed as of August 2014<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04f8m00</ref>) as its advocates. The network also organises a week-long tour of the UK each year called [[Xtra Bass]]. London pirate radio stations have been instrumental in the development of Drum and Bass, with stations such as [[Kool FM]] (which continues to broadcast today having done so since 1991), Origin FM, [[Don FM]] (the only Drum and Bass pirate to have gained a temporary legal license), [http://www.renegaderadio.co.uk Renegade Radio 107.2FM], Rude FM, Wax Fm and Eruption among the most influential.

As of 2014, despite higher profile stations such as 1Xtra scaling back their drum and bass specialist coverage, the genre has made its way in to UK top 10 charts with drum and bass inspired tracks from artists such as Rudimental and Sigma. Earlier in August 2014, before Crissy Criss' show was axed, the BBC held a whole prime time evening event dedicated to showcasing drum and bass by allowing four major labels to participate.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04dm0p1</ref>

As of November 2014, there has been 6 drum & bass songs reaching the no.1 spot on the UK's top 40 chart, since the genre was first being played on the radio, around 1993. The first of these was in 2012. The fact that all 6 of these songs have reached number 1 in only two years shows the increase in popularity and commercialization of the genre in recent years. The artists that produced these songs are [[Sigma (group)|Sigma]], [[Rudimental]] (both have had two No.1 hits), [[Wilkinson (musician)|Wilkinson]] and [[DJ Fresh]].

====Internet radio====
Internet radio stations, acting in same light as pirate stations, have also been an instrumental part in promoting drum and bass music; the majority of them funded by listener and artist donations.

Drum and bass was supported by [[Ministry of Sound]] radio from the early 2000s until 2014, with [[Bryan Gee]] of [[V Recordings]], and later featuring Tuesday shows from labels such as [[Metalheadz]], [[Dispatch Recordings]], [[Fabio]] & [[Grooverider]], [[DJ Marky]], [[DJ Bailey]], [[Viper Recordings]], [[Technique Recordings]], [[Shogun Audio]] and [[Hospital Records]]. From September 2014, Ministry abruptly dropped all non-mainstream genres to focus on mainstream EDM, causing disappointment amongst the fans of the D&B community.<ref>http://kmag.uk/2014/09/26/ministry-of-sound-radio-drops-drum-bass/</ref> Stations like Rough Tempo are proving very popular with listeners.

====North American Radio====
In North America, The Prophecy on 89.5 [[CIUT-FM]] With Marcus Visionary, DJ Prime and Mr. Brown Is North America's longest running Jungle Radio show{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} (Toronto), Album 88.5 (Atlanta) and [[KNHC|C89.5fm]] (Seattle) have shows showcasing drum and bass. Seattle also has a long-standing electronica show known as Expansions on 90.3 FM KEXP. The rotating DJs include Kid Hops, whose shows are made up mostly of drum and bass. In Columbus, Ohio WCBE 90.5 has a two-hour electronic only showcase, "All Mixed Up," Saturday nights at 10pm. At the same time WUFM 88.7 plays its "Electronic Playground." Also, [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]'s rock station, 104.5 The Edge, has a two-hour show starting at 10:00PM Saturday nights called Edge Essential Mix mixed by DJ Demko showcasing electronic and drum and bass style. While the aforementioned shows in Ohio rarely play drum and bass the latter plays the genre with some frequency. In [[Tucson, Arizona]], 91.3 FM [[KXCI]] has a two-hour electronic show known as "Digital Empire", Friday nights at 10pm (MST). Resident DJ Trinidad showcases various styles of electronica, with the main focus being drum and bass, jungle & [[dubstep]]. In [[Augusta, Georgia]], [[zarbizarre]] of the [[Cereal Killaz]] hosts a show called FreQuency on [[WHHD]] on Friday nights from 11pm until 1am, showcasing drum and bass during the 2nd hour of the show.<ref>[http://hd983.com/zarbizarre-frequency/ FreQuency on HD98.3 WHHD]</ref>

===Magazines===
The best known drum and bass publication was [http://www.kmag.uk ''Kmag''] magazine (formerly called ''Knowledge Magazine'') before it went completely online in August 2009. Although it's still live, after 20 years sterling contribution Kmag ceased updating their site in Feb 2014. Kmag's publishing arm Vision, published Brian Belle-Fortune's All Crews Journeys Through Jungle Drum & Bass Culture in 2004.

Other publications include the longest running drum and bass magazine worldwide, ''ATM Magazine'', and Austrian-based ''[[Resident (magazine)|Resident]]''. London-based ''DJ'' magazine has also been running a widely respected drum and bass reviews page since 1993, written by Alex Constantinides, which many followers refer to when seeking out new releases to investigate.

Certain drum and bass releases have found mainstream popularity in their own right, almost always material prominently featuring vocals.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Perhaps the earliest example was [[Goldie]]'s album ''[[Timeless (Goldie album)|Timeless]]'' from 1995, along with Reprazent's [[Mercury Music Prize]]-winning ''[[New Forms]]'' from 1997, [[4hero]]'s Mercury-nominated ''[[Two Pages]]'' from 1998, and [[Pendulum (band)|Pendulum]]'s ''[[Hold Your Colour]]'' in 2005 (the best selling drum and bass album of all time).<ref>"The Pop Life", ''New York Times'', September 17, 1997.</ref>

Video games such as [[Hi-Rez Studios]]' ''[[Tribes: Ascend]]'' and [[Rockstar Games]]' [[Grand Theft Auto (series)|''Grand Theft Auto'']] series have contained drum and bass tracks. [[Timecode (DJ)|DJ Timecode]]s [[Grand Theft Auto III soundtrack#MSX FM|MSX]]/[[Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories soundtrack#MSX 98|MSX 98]] radio station in ''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories]]'' played drum and bass exclusively.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The genre has some popularity in soundtracks; for instance, [[Hive (record producer)|Hive]]'s "Ultrasonic Sound" was used in ''[[The Matrix]]'s'' soundtrack and the [[E-Z Rollers]]' song "Walk This Land" appeared in the film ''[[Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Ganja Kru's "Super Sharp Shooter" is heard in the 2006 film ''[[Johnny Was]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}
