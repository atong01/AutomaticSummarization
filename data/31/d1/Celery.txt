'''Celery''' (''Apium graveolens'') is a cultivated plant, [[variety (botany)|variety]] in the family [[Apiaceae]], commonly used as a [[vegetable]]. Depending on location, either its stalks, or its hypocotyl, are eaten and used in cooking.

In North America the dominant variety most commonly available in trade is "celery", ''Apium graveolens'' var. ''dulce'', whose stalks are eaten raw, or as an ingredient in salads, or as a flavoring in soups, stews, and pot roasts.

In Europe the dominant variety most commonly available in trade is [[celeriac]] (''Apium graveolens'' var. ''rapaceum'') whose [[hypocotyl]] forms a large bulb which is eaten cooked, or as a the major ingredient in a soup. It is commonly, but incorrectly, called "celery root". The leaves of ''rapaceum'' are used as seasoning, but the stalks find only marginal use.<ref name=molly>{{cite web|first=Molly| last=Watson|url=http://localfoods.about.com/od/fall/tp/aboutceleryroot.htm|title=All About Celery Root (Celeriac)|publisher=localfoods.about.com|accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref><ref name=eatseasons>{{cite web|url=http://www.eattheseasons.com/Archive/celery_root.htm|year=2010|title=eat celery root|publisher=eattheseasons.com|accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref><ref name="Schuchert">{{cite web |url=http://www2.mpiz-koeln.mpg.de/pr/garten/schau/ApiumgraveolensLvarrapaceum/Celeriac.html |title=Celeriac (''Apium graveolens'' L. var.

Celery seed is also used as a spice. The plant grows to {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall.

==Description==
[[File:Snijselderij Apium graveolens.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Leaf celery]]
Celery leaves are [[pinnate]] to bipinnate with rhombic leaflets {{convert|3|–|6|cm|abbr=on}} long and 2–4&nbsp;cm broad. The flowers are creamy-white, 2–3&nbsp;mm in diameter, and are produced in dense compound [[umbel]]s. The seeds are broad ovoid to globose, 1.5–2&nbsp;mm long and wide. Modern [[cultivar]]s have been selected for solid [[petiole (botany)|petioles]], leaf stalks.<ref name=Vilmorin/> A celery stalk readily separates into "strings" which are bundles of angular [[collenchyma]] cells exterior to the [[vascular bundle]]s.<ref>{{cite book |author=Peterson, R.L.; Peterson, C.A.; Melville, L.H. |year=2008  |title=Teaching Plant Anatomy Through Creative Laboratory Exercises |publisher=NRC Press  |isbn=9780660197982 |url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=fxJ3ac2bIDIC }}</ref>

==Etymology==
First attested in English in 1664, the word "celery" derives from the [[French language|French]] ''céleri'', in turn from [[Italian language|Italian]] ''seleri'', the plural of ''selero'', which comes from [[Late Latin]] ''selinon'',<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dselinon selinon],
Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref> the [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] σέλινον (''selinon''), "parsley".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dse%2Flinon σέλινον],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref><ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=celery Etymonline], Online Etymology Dictionary</ref> The earliest attested form of the word is the [[Mycenaean Greek]] ''se-ri-no'', written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script.<ref>[http://www.palaeolexicon.com/ Palaeolexicon], Word study tool of ancient languages</ref>

==Taxonomy==
[[File:Celery cross section.jpg|thumb|Cross-section of a 'Pascal' celery rib, the petiole]]
Celery was described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in Volume One of his ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' in 1753.<ref>{{la icon}} {{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=C | authorlink=Carl Linnaeus | title=Species Plantarum: Tomus I | publisher=Holmiae. (Laurentii Salvii). | year=1753}}</ref>

==Cultivation==
[[File:Céleri.jpg|thumb|Head of celery, sold as a vegetable. Usually only the leaf stalks are eaten]]
The plants are raised from seed, sown either in a hot bed or in the open garden according to the season of the year, and, after one or two thinnings and transplantings, they are, on attaining a height of {{convert|15|–|20|cm|abbr=on}}, planted out in deep trenches for convenience of blanching, which is effected by earthing up to exclude light from the stems.

In the past, celery was grown as a vegetable for winter and early spring; it was perceived as a cleansing [[Medication#For nutrition|tonic]], welcomed to counter the salt-sickness{{elucidate|date=April 2013}} of a winter diet. By the 19th century, the season for celery had been extended, to last from the beginning of September to late in April.<ref>William Robinson and W. P. Thomson, ''The Vegetable Garden'' (3rd ed., 1920), p. 227.</ref>

===North America===
In North America, commercial production of celery is dominated by the cultivar called 'Pascal' celery.<ref name=Vilmorin>{{cite journal |first=Roger L. |last=de Vilmorin |year=1950 |title=Pascal celery and its origin |journal=Journal of the New York Botanical Garden |volume=51 |issue=602 |pages=39–41 |url=http://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/31503357}}</ref> Gardeners can grow a range of cultivars, many of which differ from the wild species, mainly in having stouter leaf stems. They are ranged under two classes, white and red.
The stalks grow in tight, straight, parallel bunches, and are typically marketed fresh that way, without roots and just a little green leaf remaining.

===Europe===
In Europe the dominant variety of celery most commonly grown is ''Apium graveolens'' var. ''rapaceum'' grown because its [[hypocotyl]] forms a large bulb, correctly called celeriac, but often incorrectly called celery root. The leaves are used as seasoning, and the stalks find only marginal use.<ref name=molly/><ref name=eatseasons/><ref name="Schuchert"/>

===Wild===
The wild form of celery is known as "smallage". It has a furrowed stalk with wedge-shaped leaves, the whole plant having a coarse, earthy taste, and a distinctive smell. The stalks are not usually eaten (except in soups or stews in [[French cuisine]]), but the leaves may be used in salads, and its seeds are those sold as a spice.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.practicallyedible.com/edible.nsf/pages/smallage | title=Smallage | publisher=Practically Edible: The World's Biggest Food Encyclopedia | accessdate=2009-05-03}}</ref> With cultivation and blanching, the stalks lose their acidic qualities and assume the mild, sweetish, aromatic taste particular to celery as a salad plant.

==Harvesting and storage==
Harvesting occurs when the average size of celery in a field is marketable; due to extremely uniform crop growth, fields are harvested only once. The [[Petiole (botany)|petioles]] and leaves are removed and harvested; celery is packed by size and quality (determined by colour, shape, straightness and thickness of petiole, stalk and midrib{{clarify|reason=to distinguish meanings of petiole, stalk, midrib, and rib|date=April 2013}} length and absence of disease, cracks, splits, insect damage and rot). Under optimal conditions, celery can be stored for up to seven weeks between {{convert|0|to|2|C|F}}. Inner stalks may continue growing if kept at temperatures above {{convert|0|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Freshly cut petioles of celery are prone to decay, which can be prevented or reduced through the use of sharp blades during processing, gentle handling, and proper sanitation.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://postharvest.ucdavis.edu/Produce/ProduceFacts/Veg/celery.shtml | title =Celery: Recommendations for Maintaining Postharvest Quality | publisher = Post-harvest technology research and information center | accessdate = 2008-03-04 | last = Cantwell | first = M |author2=Suslow, T. | date = 2002-06-10 }}</ref>

===Sulfites===
In the past, restaurants used to store celery in a container of water with powdered vegetable preservative, but it was found that the [[sulfite]]s in the preservative caused allergic reactions in some people.<ref>Feldman D, Schwan K. How Does Aspirin Find a Headache? HarperCollins 2005, ISBN 0-06-074094-9, p. 208</ref> In 1986, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] banned the use of sulfites on fruits and vegetables intended to be eaten raw.<ref>Fortin ND. Food Regulation: Law, Science, Policy and Practice. John Wiley and Sons, 2009, ISBN 0-470-12709-0, p. 288</ref>

==Uses==
[[Image:CelerySeedEssOil.png|thumb|upright|Celery seed (''Apium graveolens'') essential oil]]

Celery is used around the world as a vegetable. In North America for the crisp petiole (leaf stalk). In Europe the hypocotyl is used as a root vegetable. The leaves are strongly flavoured and are used less often, either as a flavouring in soups and stews or as a dried herb.

===Seeds===
In temperate countries, celery is also grown for its seeds. Actually very small fruit, these "seeds" yield a valuable [[Essential oil|volatile oil]] used in the perfume and pharmaceutical industries. They also contain an [[organic compound]] called [[apiol]]. Celery seeds can be used as flavouring or spice, either as whole seeds or ground.

===Celery salt===
The seeds can be ground and mixed with salt, to produce [[celery salt]]. Celery salt can also be made from an extract of the roots, or using dried leaves. Celery salt is used as a seasoning, in cocktails (notably to enhance the flavour of [[Bloody Mary (cocktail)|Bloody Mary]] cocktails), on the [[Chicago-style hot dog]], and in [[Old Bay Seasoning]].

===Louisiana Creole===
Celery, onions, and bell peppers are the [[holy trinity (cuisine)|"holy trinity"]] of [[Louisiana Creole cuisine|Louisiana Creole]] and [[Cajun cuisine]]. Celery, onions, and carrots make up the French [[mirepoix (cuisine)|mirepoix]], often used as a base for sauces and soups. Celery is a staple in many soups, such as chicken noodle soup.

===Medicine===
[[File:Celery seed.jpg|thumb|Celery seeds]]

The use of celery seed in pills for relieving pain was described by [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]] around AD 30.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Celsus/home.html Celsus, ''de Medicina'', Thayer translation]</ref> Celery seeds contain a compound, [[butylphthalide|3-''n''-butylphthalide]], that has been demonstrated to lower blood pressure in rats.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sui|first1=H.X.|last2=Yu|first2=Q.|last3=Zhi|first3=Y.|last4=Geng|first4=G.|last5=Xu|first5=H.B.|title=Effects of apigenin on the expression of anglotensin-converting enzyme 2 in kidney in spontaneously hypertensive rats.|journal=Journal of Hygene Research|date=2011|volume=39|issue=6|pages=693-696}}</ref>

Celery juice significantly reduced hypertension in 87.5% of patients (14 of 16) tested.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Somanadhan|first1=B.|title=An ethnopharmacological survey for potential angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors from Indian medicinal plants.|journal=Journal of Ethnopharmacology|date=May 1999|volume=65|issue=2|pages=103-112|pmid=10465650|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Another study showed the same effect on hypertension associated with pregnancy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Simpson|first1=D.|title=Buchu—South Africa's amazing herbal remedy|journal=Scottish Medical Journal|date=1998|volume=43|issue=43|pages=189-191|pmid=9924759}}</ref>

Tender [[Shoot|shoots]] or sprouts of [[Germination|germinated]] celery seeds (''Apium''), flaxseeds (''[[Linum]]'') and fenugreek (''[[Fenugreek|Trigonella]]''), when eaten together, are said to have a cooling effect on the entire body.<ref>Described in the 5th century compendium known as the [[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Avodah Zarah'' 38b).</ref> 

[[Bergapten]] in the seeds can increase photosensitivity, so the use of [[essential oil]] externally in bright sunshine should be avoided. The oil and large doses of seeds should be avoided during pregnancy, as they can act as a uterine stimulant. Seeds intended for cultivation are not suitable for eating as they are often treated with fungicides.

Celery is used in [[weight-loss]] diets, where it provides low-calorie [[dietary fibre]] bulk. Celery is often incorrectly thought to be a "[[negative-calorie food]]," the digestion of which burns more calories than the body can obtain. In fact, eating celery provides positive net calories, with digestion only consuming a small proportion of the calories taken in.<ref name="google">{{cite book|title=Why Calories Count: From Science to Politics|author1=Nestle, M.|author2=Nesheim, M.C.|date=2012|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520262881|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=ZaioR5Ac5fQC|page=189|accessdate=2014-10-05}}</ref>

==Allergies==
Celery is among a small group of foods (headed by [[peanut]]s) that appear to provoke the most severe allergic reactions; for people with celery allergy, exposure can cause potentially fatal [[anaphylaxis|anaphylactic shock]].<ref name="pmid8337856">{{cite journal |pmid=8337856 |year=1993 |last1=Celestin |first1=J |last2=Heiner |first2=DC |title=Food-induced anaphylaxis |volume=158 |issue=6 |pages=610–1 |pmc=1311786 |journal=The Western journal of medicine}}</ref> The [[allergen]] does not appear to be destroyed at cooking temperatures. Celery root—commonly eaten as [[celeriac]], or put into drinks—is known to contain more allergen than the stalk. Seeds contain the highest levels of allergen content. [[Exercise-induced anaphylaxis]] may be exacerbated. An allergic reaction also may be triggered by eating foods that have been processed with machines that have previously processed celery, making avoiding such foods difficult. In contrast with peanut allergy being most prevalent in the US, celery allergy is most prevalent in [[Central Europe]].<ref name="pmid12958180">{{cite journal |doi=10.1096/fj.02-0872fje |title=Cross-reactive N-glycans of Api g 5, a high molecular weight glycoprotein allergen from celery, are required for immunoglobulin E binding and activation of effector cells from allergic patients |year=2003 |last1=Bublin |first1=M. |journal=The FASEB Journal |pmid=12958180 |last2=Radauer |first2=C |last3=Wilson |first3=IB |last4=Kraft |first4=D |last5=Scheiner |first5=O |last6=Breiteneder |first6=H |last7=Hoffmann-Sommergruber |first7=K |volume=17 |issue=12 |pages=1697–9}}</ref> In the [[European Union]], foods that contain or may contain celery, even in trace amounts, must be clearly marked as such.<ref>{{Cite web| title=Food labelling and packaging in international trade | work=General labelling standards for the UK and EU | url=http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1080034063&type=RESOURCES}}</ref>

==Chemistry==
[[Polyyne]]s can be found in [[Apiaceae]] vegetables like celery, and their extracts show cytotoxic activities.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/jf048041s |title=Polyacetylenes from the Apiaceae Vegetables Carrot, Celery, Fennel, Parsley, and Parsnip and Their Cytotoxic Activities |year=2005 |last1=Zidorn |first1=Christian |last2=Jöhrer |first2=Karin |last3=Ganzera |first3=Markus |last4=Schubert |first4=Birthe |last5=Sigmund |first5=Elisabeth Maria |last6=Mader |first6=Judith |last7=Greil |first7=Richard |last8=Ellmerer |first8=Ernst P. |last9=Stuppner |first9=Hermann |journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry |volume=53 |issue=7 |pages=2518–23 |pmid=15796588}}</ref><ref>Minto, Robert E.; Blacklock, Brenda J “Biosynthesis and function of polyacetylenes and allied natural products” From Progress in Lipid Research 2008, vol. 47, 233-306. {{doi|10.1016/j.plipres.2008.02.002}}</ref>

[[Apiin]] and [[apigenin]] can be extracted from celery and parsley.

Some aromatic compounds of celery leaves and stalks are reported as [[butylphthalide]] and [[Sedanolide]].

==History==
[[File:Selinos didrachm ANS 685 670331.jpg|thumb|left|Selinunte [[didrachm]] coin bearing a ''selinon'' (celery) leaf, circa 515-470&nbsp;BC.]]
Daniel Zohary and Maria Hopf<ref>D. Zohary and M. Hopf, ''Domestication of Plants in the Old World'', (3rd ed. 2000) p.202.</ref> note that celery leaves and [[inflorescence]]s were part of the garlands found in the tomb of pharaoh [[Tutankhamun]] (died 1323&nbsp;BC), and celery [[mericarp]]s dated to the seventh century BC were recovered in the [[Heraion of Samos]]. However, they note "since ''A. graveolens'' grows wild in these areas, it is hard to decide whether these remains represent wild or cultivated forms." Only by classical times is it certain that celery was cultivated.

M. Fragiska mentions an archeological find of celery dating to the 9th century BC, at [[Kastanas]]; however, the literary evidence for [[ancient Greece]] is far more abundant. In [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', the horses of the [[Myrmidons]] graze on wild celery that grows in the marshes of [[Troy]], and in ''[[Odyssey]]'', there is mention of the meadows of violet and wild celery surrounding the cave of [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]].<ref name=Fragiska>{{cite journal |first=Fragiska |last=Megaloudi |year=2005 |title=Wild and Cultivated Vegetables, Herbs and Spices in Greek Antiquity (900&nbsp;B.C. to 400&nbsp;B.C.) |journal=Environmental Archaeology |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=73–82 |doi=10.1179/146141005790083858}}</ref>

===Cultural depictions===
[[File:Celery (apium).jpg|thumb|''[[Apium]]'' illustration from Barbarus Apuleius' ''Herbarium'', c. 1400.]]
A [[Chthonic|chthonian]] symbol among the ancient Greeks, celery was said to have sprouted from the blood of [[Cabeiri|Kadmilos]], father of the [[Cabeiri]], chthonian divinities celebrated in [[Samothrace]], [[Lemnos]], and [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]]. The spicy odour and dark leaf colour encouraged this association with the cult of death. In classical Greece, celery leaves were used as garlands for the dead, and the wreaths of the winners at the [[Isthmian Games]] were first made of celery before being replaced by crowns made of [[pine]]. According to [[Pliny the Elder]]<ref>[[Pliny's Natural History|Pliny, ''Natural History'']] XIX.46.</ref> in [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]], the garland worn by the winners of the sacred [[Nemean Games]] was also made of celery.<ref name=Fragiska/><!--is this needed? Celery is eaten at the end of each adventure by [[the Wonder Pets]] in the American animated children's television series.--> The Ancient Greek colony of [[Selinunte|Selinous]] ({{lang-el|Σελινοῦς}}, ''Selinous''), on [[Sicily]], was named after wild parsley that grew abundantly there; Selinountian coins depicted a parsley leaf as the symbol of the city.

The name "celery" retraces the plant's route of successive adoption in European cooking, as the English "celery" (1664) is derived from the French ''céleri'' coming from the [[Lombard language|Lombard term]], ''seleri'', from the Latin ''selinon'', borrowed from Greek.<ref>''[[OED]]'', ''s.v.'' "Celery".</ref>

Celery's late arrival in the English kitchen is an end-product of the long tradition of seed selection needed to reduce the sap's bitterness and increase its sugars. By 1699, [[John Evelyn]] could recommend it in his ''Acetaria. A Discourse of [[Salad|Sallets]]'': "Sellery, apium Italicum, (and of the Petroseline Family) was formerly a stranger with us (nor very long since in Italy) is an hot and more generous sort of Macedonian [[Parsley|Persley]] or Smallage...and for its high and grateful Taste is ever plac'd in the middle of the Grand Sallet, at our Great Men's tables, and Praetors feasts, as the Grace of the whole Board".<ref>{{cite book|author=Evelyn, J.|year=1699/1937/2005|title=Acetaria: A Discourse of Sallets|publisher=B. Tooke; The Women's Auxiliary of Brooklyn Botanic Garden; Project Gutenberg|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15517}}</ref>

Celery has made a surprising appearance in football folklore. Supporters of English Premier League team [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and Football League team [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] regularly sing songs about the vegetable and are famed for throwing celery during matches. This has also given rise to the "Chelsea Cocktail", a pint of Guinness garnished with a stick of celery.

In the television program ''[[Doctor Who]]'', the [[Fifth Doctor|Fifth incarnation]] of [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]] (played by [[Peter Davison]]), was noted<ref name="youtube">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4JpeXoJNI|title=Why does the Fifth Doctor wear celery? - YouTube|publisher=youtube.com|accessdate=2014-10-05}}</ref> for wearing a stalk of celery on his lapel, claiming it at one point to be an excellent restorative.
