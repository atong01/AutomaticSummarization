In [[Greek mythology]], '''Andromeda''' is the daughter of the [[Aethiopia (Classical Greek term)|Aethiopian]] king [[Cepheus, King of Aethiopia|Cepheus]] and his wife [[Cassiopeia (mythology)|Cassiopeia]]. When Cassiopeia's [[hubris]] leads her to boast that Andromeda is more beautiful than the [[Nereids]], [[Poseidon]], influenced by [[Hades]], sends a [[sea monster]], [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]], to ravage Aethiopia as divine punishment.<ref>"Who's Who in Classical Mythology," Michael Grant & John Hazel, Oxford University Press, 1973, 1993, p.31, ISBN 0-19-521030-1.</ref> Andromeda is stripped and chained naked to a rock as a sacrifice to sate the monster, but is saved from death by [[Perseus]].

Her name is the [[Latin language|Latinized]] form of the Greek {{lang|grc|Ἀνδρομέδα}} (''Androméda'') or {{lang|grc|Ἀνδρομέδη}} (''Andromédē''): "ruler of men",<ref>The traditional [[etymology]] of the name is, "she who has bravery in her mind"</ref> from {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἀνήρ|ἀνήρ]], ἀνδρός}} (''anēr, andrós'') "man", and ''medon'', "ruler".

As a subject, Andromeda has been popular in art since classical times; it is one of several Greek myths of a [[Greek hero]]'s rescue of the intended victim of an archaic ''[[hieros gamos]]'' (sacred marriage), giving rise to the "[[princess and dragon]]" [[Motif (narrative)|motif]]. From the [[Renaissance]], interest revived in the original story, typically as derived from [[Ovid]]'s account.

== Mythology ==

In [[Greek mythology]], Andromeda was the daughter of [[Cepheus, King of Aethiopia|Cepheus]] and [[Cassiopeia (mythology)|Cassiopeia]], king and queen of the North African kingdom of [[Aethiopia (Classical Greek term)|Aethiopia]].

Her mother Cassiopeia boasted that her daughter was more beautiful than the [[Nereids]], the [[nymph]]-daughters of the sea god [[Nereus]] and often seen accompanying [[Poseidon]]. To punish the queen for her arrogance, Poseidon, brother to [[Zeus]] and god of the sea, sent a sea monster named [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]] to ravage the coast of Aethiopia including the kingdom of the vain queen. The desperate king consulted the [[Oracle]] of Apollo, who announced that no respite would be found until the king sacrificed his daughter, Andromeda, to the monster. Stripped naked, she was chained to a rock on the coast.

[[Perseus]] was returning from having slain the [[Gorgon]] [[Medusa]]. After he happened upon the chained Andromeda, he approached Cetus while invisible (for he was wearing Hades's helm), and killed the sea monster. He set Andromeda free, and married her in spite of her having been previously promised to her uncle [[Phineus (son of Belus)|Phineus]]. At the wedding a quarrel took place between the rivals and Phineus was turned to stone by the sight of the Gorgon's head.<ref>[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' v. 1.</ref>

Andromeda followed her husband, first to his native island of [[Serifos]], where he rescued his mother [[Danaë]], and then to [[Tiryns]] in [[Argos]]. Together, they became the ancestors of the family of the ''Perseidae'' through the line of their son Perses. Perseus and Andromeda had seven sons: [[Perses (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Perses]], [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]], [[Heleus]], [[Mestor]], [[Sthenelus (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Sthenelus]], [[Electryon]], and [[Cynurus]] as well as two daughters, [[Autochthe]] and [[Gorgophone]]. Their descendants ruled Mycenae from [[Electryon]] down to [[Eurystheus]], after whom [[Atreus]] attained the kingdom, and would also include the great hero [[Heracles]]. According to this mythology, Perseus is the ancestor of the [[Persian people|Persians]].

At the port city of [[Jaffa]] (today part of [[Tel Aviv]]) an outcrop of rocks near the harbour has been associated with the place of Andromeda's chaining and rescue by the traveler [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], the geographer [[Strabo]] and the historian of the Jews [[Josephus]].<ref>Pausanias iv.35.9; Strabo xvi.2.8; Josephus, ''Jewish War'' iii.9.3</ref>

After Andromeda's death, as [[Euripides]] had promised [[Athena]] at the end of his ''[[Andromeda (play)|Andromeda]]'', produced in 412 BCE,<ref>[[Karl Kerenyi]], ''The Heroes of the Greeks'' 1959:53; Euripides' drama is lost, save some fragments.</ref> the goddess placed her among the [[constellation]]s in the northern sky, near Perseus and [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]]; the [[Andromeda (constellation)|constellation Andromeda]], so known since antiquity, is named after her.

==Constellations ==
[[Image:1869 Edward Poynter - Andromeda.jpg|thumb|200px|''Andromeda'' (1869) [[Edward Poynter]]]]
Andromeda is represented in the northern sky by the [[constellation]] [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]], which contains the [[Andromeda Galaxy]].

Four constellations are associated with the myth. Viewing the fainter stars visible to the naked eye, the constellations are rendered as:
* A huge man wearing a [[Crown (headgear)|crown]], upside down with respect to the [[ecliptic]] (the constellation [[Cepheus (constellation)|Cepheus]])
* A smaller figure, next to the man, sitting on a chair; as it is near the [[Polaris|pole star]], it may be seen by observers in the Northern Hemisphere through the whole year, although sometimes upside down (the constellation [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]])
* A maiden, chained up, facing or turning away from the ecliptic (the constellation [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]]), next to [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]]
* A [[whale]] just under the ecliptic (the constellation [[Cetus]])

Other constellations related to the story are:
* [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]]
* The constellation [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]], who was born from the stump of [[Medusa]]'s neck, after Perseus had decapitated her
* The constellation [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]], which may have been treated as two fish caught by [[Dictys]] the [[fisherman]] who was brother of [[Polydectes]], king of [[Seriphos]], the place where Perseus and his mother [[Danaë]] were stranded

==Perseus and Andromeda in art==
[[File:1596 dArpino Perseus and Andromeda anagoria.JPG|thumb|right|Cesari: ''Perseus saving Andromeda'', 1596, [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]]]]
[[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]] (and in more modern times, [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]]) made the story the subject of [[tragedies]], and its incidents were represented in numerous ancient works of art, including Greek vases. [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]'s opera, ''[[Persée]]'', also dramatizes the myth.

Andromeda has been the subject of numerous ancient and modern works of art, which typically show the moment of rescue, with Andromeda usually still chained, and often naked or nearly so. Examples include: one of [[Titian]]'s ''poesies'' ([[Wallace Collection]]), and compositions by [[Joachim Wtewael]] ([[Musée du Louvre|Louvre]]), [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] (Rennes), [[Perseus and Andromeda (Rubens)|many versions by Rubens]], [[Ingres]], and [[Gustave Moreau]]. From the [[Renaissance]] onward the chained nude figure of Andromeda typically was the centre of interest.  [[Rembrandt]]'s ''[[Andromeda Chained to the Rocks]]'' is unusual in showing her alone, fearfully awaiting the monster.

If by dull rhymes our English must be chain’d,
 And, like Andromeda, the Sonnet sweet
 Fetter’d, in spite of pained loveliness;
 Let us find out, if we must be constrain’d,
 Sandals more interwoven and complete
 To fit the naked foot of poesy;
 Let us inspect the lyre, and weigh the stress
 Of every chord, and see what may be gain’d
 By ear industrious, and attention meet:
 Misers of sound and syllable, no less
 Than Midas of his coinage, let us be
 Jealous of dead leaves in the bay wreath crown;
 So, if we may not let the Muse be free,
 She will be bound with garlands of her own.

The Italian composer [[Salvatore Sciarrino]] composed an hour-long operatic drama called ''Perseo e Andromeda'' in 2000.

===Film===
In 1973, an animated film called ''Perseus'' (20 minutes) was made in the [[Soviet Union]] as part of the Soviet animated film collection called ''Legends and mуths of Ancient Greece''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animator.ru/db/?p=show_film&fid=2626|title=тПУУЙКУЛБС БОЙНБГЙС Ч ВХЛЧБИ Й ЖЙЗХТБИ - жЙМШНЩ - "ретуек"|work=animator.ru|accessdate=7 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/315858/|title=КиноПоиск.ru - Все фильмы планеты|work=kinopoisk.ru|accessdate=7 September 2015}}</ref>

The 1981 film ''[[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'' retells the story of Perseus, Andromeda, and Cassiopeia, but makes a few changes (notably Cassiopeia boasts that her daughter is more beautiful than [[Thetis]] as opposed to the Nereids as a group). Thetis was indeed a Nereid and also the future mother of [[Achilles]]. Andromeda and Perseus meet and fall in love after he saves her soul from the enslavement of Thetis' son, Calibos, whereas in the myth, they simply meet as Perseus returns home from having slain [[Medusa]]. In the film, the monster is called a [[kraken]], although it is depicted as a lizard-like creature rather than a squid; and combining two elements of the myth, Perseus defeats the sea monster by showing it Medusa's face, turning the monster into stone. Andromeda is depicted as being strong-willed and independent, whereas in the stories she is only really mentioned as being the princess whom Perseus saves from the sea monster. Andromeda was portrayed by [[Judi Bowker]] in this film.

Andromeda also features in the 2010 film ''[[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'', a remake of the 1981 version. Several changes were made in regard to the myth, most notably that Perseus did not marry Andromeda after he rescued her from the sea monster. Andromeda was portrayed by [[Alexa Davalos]]. The character was played by [[Rosamund Pike]] in the sequel ''[[Wrath of the Titans]]'', the second of a planned [[Clash of the Titans (franchise)|trilogy]]. In the end of the sequel, Perseus and Andromeda begin a relationship.

In the Japanese anime ''[[Saint Seiya]]'' the character, [[Andromeda Shun|Shun]], represents the [[Andromeda constellation]] using chains as his main weapons, reminiscent of Andromeda being chained before she was saved by Perseus. In order to attain the Andromeda Cloth, he was chained between two large pillars of rock and he had to overcome the chains before the tide came in and killed him, also reminiscent of this myth.

Andromeda appears in [[Disney]]'s ''[[Hercules: The Animated Series]]'' as a new student of "Prometheus Academy" which Hercules and other characters from Greek mythology attend. 

===Novels===
In [[Rick Riordan]]'s ''[[Percy Jackson & the Olympians]]'' series, there are a few references to Andromeda. The most obvious is that the series' lead villains have a [[cruise ship]] which serves as their headquarters and is called ''The Princess Andromeda''.

Andromeda is the main character in [[Harry Turtledove]]'s short story "Miss Manners' Guide to Greek Missology", published in [[Esther Friesner]]'s ''Chicks in Chainmail'' series of humorous feminist fantasy collections, and reprinted in other anthologies afterwards. It is a satire filled with role reversals, puns, and deliberate anachronisms relating to pop culture.

Andromeda is Anna's full name in [[Jodi Picoult]]'s [[My Sister's Keeper]], which was turned into a movie in 2010. In the novel there are several references to mythology, as Anna's dad Brian is an astronomer in his free time.
