The capital and largest city is [[Barcelona]], the [[List of metropolitan areas in Spain|second-largest city]] in Spain and the centre of one of the [[List of metropolitan areas in Europe|largest metropolitan areas in Europe]].

Catalonia comprises most of the territory of the former [[Principality of Catalonia]], with the remainder now part of France's [[Pyrénées-Orientales]]. It is bordered by [[France]] and [[Andorra]] to the north, the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the east, and the Spanish autonomous communities of [[Aragon]] to the west and the [[Valencian Community]] to the south. The official languages are [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and the [[Aranese dialect]] of [[Occitan language|Occitan]].<ref name="estatut_langs">{{cite web|url=http://www.parlament-cat.net/porteso/estatut/estatut_angles_100506.pdf |title=Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia (2006), Articles 6, 50 - BOPC 224 |format=PDF |accessdate=31 January 2014}}</ref>

In the late [[8th century]], the counties of the [[Septimania|March of Gothia]] and the [[Marca Hispanica|Hispanic March]] were established by [[Francia]] as feudatory vassals across and near the eastern [[Pyrenees]] as a defensive barrier against Muslim invasions.  The eastern counties of these marches were united under the rule of the Frankish vassal the [[County of Barcelona|Count of Barcelona]], and were later called Catalonia. In 1137, The [[Principality of Catalonia]] and the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] were united by marriage under the [[Crown of Aragon]], and Catalonia became the base for the Crown of Aragon's naval power and   expansionism in the Mediterranean. In the later middle ages [[Catalan literature]] flourished. Between 1469 and 1516, the King of Aragon and the Queen of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] married and ruled their kingdoms together, retaining all their distinct institutions, [[Catalan Courts|Courts]] ([[parliament]]), and [[Catalan constitutions|Constitutions]]. During the [[Catalan Revolt]] (1640–52), Catalonia rebelled against a large presence of the Spanish army in its territory, becoming a [[Catalan Republic|republic]] with French help but was largely reconquered by the Spanish army. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] in 1659, which ended the wider [[Franco-Spanish War (1635–59)|Franco-Spanish war]], the [[Spanish Crown]] ceded the northern parts of Catalonia, mostly incorporated in the county of [[Roussillon]], to France. During the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701–14), the Crown of Aragon sided against the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] [[Philip V of Spain]], whose subsequent victory led to the [[Nueva Planta decrees|abolition]] of non-Castillian institutions in all of Spain and the replacement of Latin and other languages (such as Catalan) with Spanish in legal documents.

In the nineteenth century Catalonia was severely affected by the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic]] and [[Carlist Wars]]. In the second half of the century Catalonia experienced industrialisation. As wealth from the industrial expansion grew, Catalonia saw a [[Renaixença|cultural renaissance]] coupled with incipient [[Catalan nationalism|nationalism]] while several workers movements appeared. In 1913, the four Catalan provinces formed a [[Commonwealth of Catalonia|Commonwealth]], and with the return of democracy during the [[Second Spanish Republic]] (1931–39), the [[Generalitat of Catalonia]] was restored. After the [[Spanish Civil War]], the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist]] dictatorship enacted repressive measures, abolishing Catalan institutions and banning the official use of the Catalan language again. From the late 1950s through to the early 1970s, Catalonia saw [[Spanish miracle|rapid economic growth]], drawing many workers from across Spain, making Barcelona one of Europe's largest industrial metropolitan areas and Catalonia into a major tourist destination. Since the [[Spanish transition to democracy]] (1975–82), Catalonia has gained some political and cultural autonomy and is now one of the most economically dynamic communities of Spain.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The name ''Catalunya'' (Catalonia) began to be used for the homeland of the "Catalans" (''Catalanenses'') in the late 11th century and was probably used before as a territorial reference to the group of counties that comprised part of the [[Septimania|March of Gothia]] and [[Marca Hispanica|March of Hispania]] under the control of the [[Count of Barcelona]] and his relatives.<ref>[http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0016436 Enciclopèdia Catalana online: Catalunya ("Geral de Cataluign, Raimundi Catalan and Arnal Catalan appear in 1107/1112")] (in Catalan) {{wayback|df=yes|url=http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0016436 |date=20130524103451 }}</ref> The origin of the name ''Catalunya'' is subject to diverse interpretations because of a lack of evidence.

One theory suggests that ''Catalunya'' (Latin ''Gathia Launia'') derives from the name ''Gothia'' or ''Gauthia'' ("Land of the [[Goths]]"), since the origins of the Catalan counts, lords and people were found in the [[Septimania|March of Gothia]], known as ''Gothia'', whence ''Gothland'' > ''Gothlandia'' > ''Gothalania'' > ''Catalonia'' theoretically derived.<ref name="Books.google.com"/><ref>{{cite book| author = Ulick Ralph Burke| title = A history of Spain from the earliest times to the death of Ferdinand the Catholic| url = http://books.google.com/?id=tz3g_YzTQaUC&pg=PA154| year = 1900| publisher = Longmans, Green, and co.| page = 154 }}</ref> During the Middle Ages, Byzantine chroniclers claimed that ''Catalania'' derives from the local medley of [[Goths]] with [[Alans]], initially constituting a ''Goth-Alania''.<ref>The Sarmatians: 600 BC-AD 450 (Men-at-Arms) by Richard Brzezinski and Gerry Embleton, 19 August 2002.</ref>

Other less plausible theories suggest:

*''Catalunya'' derives from the term "land of castles", having evolved from the term ''castlà'', the medieval term for the ruler of a castle (see [[castellan]]).<ref name="Books.google.com">{{cite book| author = Maximiano García Venero| title = Historia del nacionalismo catalán: 2a edición| url = http://books.google.com/?id=nUABAAAAMAAJ| accessdate = 25 April 2010| date = 7 July 2006| publisher = Ed.

===Pre-Roman and Roman Period===
In pre-Roman times, the area that is now called Catalonia in the north-east of [[Iberian Peninsula]], like the rest of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] side of the peninsula, was populated by the [[Iberians]]. Coastal trading colonies were established by the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], who settled around the [[Roses, Girona|Roses]] area.  Both Greeks and [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] briefly ruled the territory in the course of the [[Second Punic War]] and traded with the surrounding Iberian population.

After the Carthaginian defeat by the [[Roman Republic]], the north-east of Iberia became the first to come under Roman rule and became part of [[Hispania]], the westernmost part of the [[Roman Empire]]. [[Tarraco (Tarragona)|Tarraco]] (modern [[Tarragona]]) was one of the most important Roman cities in Hispania.

===Middle Ages===
After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the area was conquered by the [[Visigoths]] and was ruled as part of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] for almost two and a half centuries. In 718, it came under [[Muslim]] control and became part of [[al-Andalus]], a province of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. From the conquest of [[Roussillon]] in 760, to the conquest of [[Barcelona]] in 801, the [[Frankish empire]] took control of the area from the Muslims and created heavily militarized, self-governing [[county|counties]]. These counties formed part of the [[Septimania|Gothic]] and [[Spanish March|Hispanic]] marches, a [[buffer zone]] in the south of the Frankish empire in the former province of Septimania and in the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula, to act as a defensive barrier for the Frankish empire against further Muslim invasions from al-Andalus.

These counties came under the rule of the [[Count of Barcelona|counts of Barcelona]], who were Frankish [[vassal]]s nominated by the emperor of the Franks, to whom they were [[feudatory|feudatories]] (801–987). The earliest known use of the name "[[Principality of Catalonia|Catalonia]]" for these counties dates to 1117.

In 987, [[Wilfred the Hairy]], count of Barcelona did not recognise [[Hugh Capet]] as his king, making his successors (Sunyer, Borrell II, Miro I, and so on) de facto independent of the Carolingian crown. In 1137, [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona]] decided to accept [[Ramiro II of Aragon|King Ramiro II of Aragon]]'s proposal to marry Queen [[Petronilla of Aragon|Petronila]], establishing the dynastic union of the County of Barcelona with the [[Kingdom of Aragon]], joining the [[Crown of Aragon]] and making the Catalan counties that were united under the county of Barcelona into a [[principality]] of the Aragonese Crown.

In 1258, by means of the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1258)|Treaty of Corbeil]], the [[Count of Barcelona]] and King of Aragon, of Mallorca and of Valencia, [[James I of Aragon]] renounced his family rights and dominions in [[Occitania]] and recognised the king of France as heir of the [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian Dynasty]]. The king of France formally relinquished his nominal feudal lordship over all the Catalan counties, excepting the [[County of Foix]] despite the opposition of the King of Aragon and Count of Barcelona.  This treaty transformed the principality's ''[[de facto]]'' union with Aragon into a ''[[de jure]]'' one and was the origin of the definitive separation between both geographical areas Catalonia and  [[Languedoc]].

As a coastal territory, Catalonia became the base of the Aragonese Crown's maritime forces, which spread the power of the Aragonese Crown in the Mediterranean, and made Barcelona into a powerful and wealthy city. In the period 1164–1410 new territories, the [[Kingdom of Valencia]], the [[Kingdom of Majorca]], [[Sardinia]], the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], [[Corsica]] and (briefly) the [[Duchy of Athens]], were incorporated into the dynastic domains of the [[House of Aragon]].

The domains of the Aragonese Crown were severely affected by the [[Black Death]] pandemic and by later outbreaks of the plague. Between 1347 and 1497 Catalonia lost 37 percent of its population.<ref>According to John Huxtable Elliott, "Between 1347 and 1497 the Principality [Catalonia] had lost 37% of its inhabitants, and was reduced to a population of something like 300,000." {{cite book| author = John Huxtable Elliott| title = The revolt of the Catalans: a study in the decline of Spain (1598–1640)| url = http://books.google.com/?id=X2Hf-crzPjUC&pg=PA26| year = 1984| publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]| isbn = 0-521-27890-2| page = 26 }}</ref>

In 1410, King [[Martin of Aragon|Martin I]] died without surviving descendants. Under the [[Compromise of Caspe]], Ferdinand from the Castilian [[House of Trastámara]] received the Crown of Aragon as [[Ferdinand I of Aragon]].

===Modern Era===
The grandson of Martin I, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]] were married in 1469, later taking the title the [[Catholic Monarchs]]; subsequently, this event was seen by historiographers as the dawn of a unified Spain. At that point, though united by marriage, the Crowns of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] maintained distinct territories, each kept its own traditional institutions, parliaments and laws. Castile commissioned expeditions to the [[Americas]] and benefited from the riches acquired in the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]], but in time, also carried the main burden of military expenses of the united Spanish kingdoms. After Isabella's death, Ferdinand II personally ruled both kingdoms.
[[Image:Cortes Catalanas.jpg|thumb|A 15th-century miniature of the [[Court (royal)|Catalan Court]].]]

By virtue of descent from his maternal grandparents, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, in 1516 [[Charles I of Spain]] became the first king to rule Castile and Aragon simultaneously by his own right. Following the death of his paternal ([[House of Habsburg]]) grandfather, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], he was also elected [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], in 1519.<ref>{{cite web |last=Encyclopedia Britannica online |title=Charles V |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/107009/Charles-V |accessdate=October 2012}}</ref>

The [[Catalan Revolt]] (1640–52) saw Catalonia rebel with French help against the Spanish Crown for overstepping Catalonia's traditional rights during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Most of Catalonia was reconquered by the Spanish monarchy but Catalan rights were recognised. [[Roussillon]] was lost to France. 

The most significant conflict concerning the governing monarchy was the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which began when the childless [[Charles II of Spain]], the last Spanish Habsburg, died without an heir in 1700. Charles II had chosen [[Philip V of Spain]] from the French [[House of Bourbon]]. Catalonia, like other territories that formed the Crown of Aragon, rose up in support of the Austrian Habsburg pretender [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor]] in his claim for the Spanish throne as Charles III of Spain. The fight between the houses of Bourbon and Habsburg for the Spanish Crown split Spain and Europe.

The [[Siege of Barcelona (1713–14)|fall of Barcelona]] on 11 September 1714 to the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] king [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] militarily ended the Habsburg claim to the Spanish Crown, which became legal fact in the [[Treaty of Utrecht]]. Philip felt that he had been betrayed by the Corts Catalan, as it had initially sworn its loyal to him when he had presided over it in 1701. In retaliation for the betrayal, the first Bourbon king introduced the [[Nueva Planta decrees]] that incorporated the territories of the Crown of Aragon, including Catalonia, as provinces under the Crown of Castile in 1716, terminating their separate institutions, laws and rights, within a united kingdom of Spain.

===Industrialisation===
{{triple image|thumb|Prim madrazo.jpeg|100|Figueras y Moragas.jpg|100|Pi y margall.jpg|100|[[Juan Prim, 1st Marquis of los Castillejos]], [[Estanislao Figueras]] and [[Francesc Pi i Margall]] were Catalan presidents of [[Spain]].}}
In the latter half of the 19th century, Catalonia became an industrial center. To this day it remains one of the most industrialised parts of Spain.  In the first third of the 20th century, Catalonia gained and lost varying degrees of autonomy several times, receiving its first statute of autonomy during the [[Second Spanish Republic]] (1931). This period was marked by political unrest and the preeminence of [[Revolutionary Catalonia]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–39). The Anarchists had been active throughout the early 20th century, achieving the first [[eight-hour day|eight-hour workday]] in Europe in 1919.

The defeat of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]] brought fascist [[Francisco Franco]] to power as dictator. His regime imposed linguistic, political and cultural restrictions across Spain. In Catalonia, any kind of public activities associated with [[Catalan nationalism]], [[anarchism]], [[socialism]], [[liberalism]], [[democracy]] or [[communism]], including the publication of books on those subjects or simply discussion of them in open meetings, was banned. Franco's regime banned the use of Catalan in government-run institutions and during public events.  The pro-Republic of Spain President of Catalonia, [[Lluís Companys]], was taken to Spain from his exile in the German-occupied France, tortured and executed for the crime of 'military rebellion'.<ref>Preston, Paul. (2012). ''The Spanish Holocaust.'' Harper Press. London p.493</ref>

During later stages of [[Francoist Spain]], certain folkloric and religious celebrations in Catalan resumed and were tolerated. Use of Catalan in the [[mass media]] had been forbidden, but was permitted from the early 1950s<ref>{{cite book| author = Ross| title = Cultural Contestation in Ethnic Conflict| url = http://books.google.com/?id=Oe4popSDfW0C&pg=PA139| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-1-139-46307-2| page = 139 }}</ref> in the theatre. Publishing in Catalan continued throughout the dictatorship.<ref>{{citation |title=The Resurgence of Catalan |first=Earl W |last=Thomas |work=Hispania |volume=45 |issue=1 |date=March 1962 |pages=43–48 |doi=10.2307/337523}}</ref>

The years after the war were extremely hard. Catalonia, like many other parts of Spain, had been devastated by the war.  Recovery from the war damage was slow and made more difficult by the international trade embargo against Franco's dictatorial regime. By the late 1950s the country had recovered its pre-war economic levels and in the 1960s was the second fastest growing economy in the world in what became known as the [[Spanish miracle]]. During this period there was a spectacular growth of industry and tourism in Catalonia that drew large numbers of workers to the region from across Spain and made the area around Barcelona into one of Europe's largest industrial metropolitan areas.

After Franco's death in 1975, Catalonia voted for the adoption of a democratic Spanish Constitution in 1978, in which Catalonia recovered political and cultural autonomy. Today, Catalonia is one of the most economically dynamic communities of Spain. The Catalan capital and largest city, Barcelona, is a major international cultural centre and a major tourist destination.

==Geography==
[[File:Pedraforca2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pedraforca]]]]

===Climate===
The climate of Catalonia is diverse. The populated areas lying by the coast in Tarragona, Barcelona and Girona provinces feature a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csa''). The inland part (including the Lleida province and the inner part of Barcelona province) show a mostly [[continental Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csa''). The Pyrenean peaks have a [[highland climate|mountain]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''H'') or even [[Alpine climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''ET'') at the highest summits, while the valleys have a maritime or [[oceanic climate]] sub-type ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfb'').

In the Mediterranean area, summers are dry and hot with sea breezes, and the maximum temperature is around {{convert|26|-|31|°C}}. Winter is cool or slightly cold depending on the location. It snows frequently in the Pyrenees, and it occasionally snows at lower altitudes, even by the coastline. Spring and autumn are typically the rainiest seasons, except for the Pyrenean valleys, where summer is typically stormy.

The inland part of Catalonia is hotter and drier in summer. Temperature may reach {{convert|35|°C}}, some days even {{convert|40|°C}}. Nights are cooler there than at the coast, with the temperature of around {{convert|14|-|17|°C}}. Fog is not uncommon in valleys and plains; it can be especially persistent, with [[freezing drizzle]] episodes and subzero temperatures during winter (record from −36&nbsp;°C), along the [[Segre River|Segre]] and in other river valleys.

The Catalan hydrographic network consists of two important basins, the one of the [[Ebre|Ebro]] and the one that comprises the internal basins of Catalonia (respectively covering 46.84% and 51.43% of the territory), all of them flow to the [[Mediterranean]]. Furthermore, there is the [[Garona]] river basin that flows to the [[Atlantic Ocean]], but it only covers 1.73% of the Catalan territory.

The hydrographic network can be divided in two sectors, an occidental slope or Ebre river slope and one oriental slope constituted by minor rivers that flow to the Mediterranean along the Catalan coast. The first slope provides an average of {{convert|18700|hm3|cumi|lk=on}} per year, while the second only provides an average of {{convert|2020|hm3|cumi|abbr=on}}/year. The difference is due to the big contribution of the Ebre river, from which the [[Segre (river)|Segre]] is an important tributary. Moreover, in Catalonia there is a relative wealth of groundwaters, although there is inequality between ''[[comarca|comarques]]'', given the complex geological structure of the territory.<ref name="GEC clima">{{cite web |url=http://www.enciclopedia.cat/enciclop%C3%A8dies/gran-enciclop%C3%A8dia-catalana/EC-GEC-0016439.xml |title=Catalunya: El clima i la hidrografia |language=Catalan|work=l'Enciclopèdia |location=Barcelona |editor=Gran Enciclopedia Catalana}}{{dead link|date=January 2014}}</ref> In the Pyrenees there are many small lakes, remnants of the [[Quaternary glaciation|ice age]]. The biggest is the one of [[Banyoles]].

The Catalan coast is almost rectilinear, with a length of {{convert|580|km}} and few [[landform]]s—the most relevant are the [[Cap de Creus]] and the [[Gulf of Roses]] to the north and the [[Ebro Delta]] to the south. The [[Catalan Coastal Range]] hugs the coastline, and it is split into two segments, one between [[L'Estartit]] and the town of [[Blanes]] (the [[Costa Brava]]), and the other at the south, at the Costes del [[Garraf]].<ref>[http://es.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761556976_1____4/Catalunya_Catalu%C3%B1a.html#s4 Catalunya.

The principal [[List of rivers of Catalonia|rivers in Catalonia]] are the [[Ter (river)|Ter]], [[Llobregat]], and the [[Ebre]], all of which run into the [[Mediterranean]].

{{main|Politics of Catalonia|Politics of Spain}}

After Franco's death in 1975 and the adoption of a democratic constitution in Spain in 1978, Catalonia recovered and extended the powers that it had gained in the [[Statute of Autonomy]] of 1932<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gencat.net/generalitat/eng/guia/antecedents/antecedents15.htm |title=Beginnings of the autonomous regime, 1918–1932 |publisher=Gencat.net |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> but lost with the fall of the [[Second Spanish Republic]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gencat.net/generalitat/eng/guia/antecedents/antecedents16.htm |title=The republican Government of Catalonia, 1931–1939 |publisher=Gencat.net |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> at the end of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1939.

This autonomous community has gradually achieved more [[Self-governance|autonomy]] since the approval of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]]. The Generalitat holds exclusive jurisdiction in culture, environment, communications, transportation, commerce, public safety and local government, and shares jurisdiction with the Spanish government in education, health and justice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gencat.cat/generalitat/eng/estatut/titol_4.htm |title=Title IV.

Since 2011 when the question started to be regularly surveyed by the governmental Center for Public Opinion Studies (CEO), support for Catalan independence has been on the rise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.einesceo.cat/evolutius/referendum-per-la-independencia-de-catalunya-/39 |title=Referèndum per la independència de Catalunya – Centre d'Estudis d'Opinió |publisher=Einesceo.cat |accessdate=15 October 2013}}</ref> According to the CEO opinion poll from March 2015, 48% of Catalans would vote against independence and 44% for it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2015/03/13/catalunya/1426242874_144265.html|publisher=[[El País]]|accessdate=15 October 2015|language=es}}</ref>

In hundreds of non-binding local referendums on independence, organised across Catalonia from 13 September 2009, a large majority voted for independence, although critics argued that the polls were mostly held in pro-independence areas.

Two major factors were Spain's Constitutional Court's 2010 decision to declare part of the 2006 Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia unconstitutional, as well as the fact that Catalonia contributes 19.49% of the federal government’s tax revenue, but only receives 14.03% of federal spending.<ref>{{cite news |last=Abend |first=Lisa |title=Spain Barcelona Warns Madrid: Pay Up, or Catalonia Leaves Spain |url=http://world.time.com/2012/09/11/barcelona-warns-madrid-pay-up-or-catalonia-leaves-spain/?xid=newsletter-weekly |publisher=TIME |accessdate=17 September 2012 |date=11 September 2012}}</ref>

Parties that consider themselves either Catalan nationalist or "[[Catalan independence|independentist]]" have been present in all Catalan governments since 1980. The largest Catalan nationalist party, [[Convergence and Union]], ruled Catalonia from 1980 to 2003, and returned to power in the [[Catalan parliamentary election, 2010|2010 election]]. Between 2003 and 2010, a leftist coalition, composed by the [[Partit dels Socialistes de Catalunya|Catalan Socialists' Party]], the pro-independence [[Republican Left of Catalonia]] and the leftist-environmentalist [[Iniciativa per Catalunya Verds|Initiative for Catalonia-Greens]], implemented policies that widened Catalan autonomy.<ref>{{cite book| author = Xavier Mir i Oliveras| title = Vostè Té Un Problema i Aquest Problema Es Diu PSC| url = http://books.google.com/?id=JKPZOz6t0TkC&pg=PA67| year = 2007| publisher = Lulu.com| isbn = 978-1-84799-752-4| page = 67 }}</ref>

In the [[Catalonian parliamentary election, 2012|November 25, 2012 Catalan parliamentary election]], sovereigntist parties supporting a secession referendum gathered 59.01% of the votes and hold 87 of the 135 seats in the Catalan Parliament. Parties supporting independence from the rest of Spain obtained 49.12% of the votes and a majority of 74 seats.

[[Artur Mas]], the current president of Catalonia, organized early elections and they took place in September 27, 2015. In these elections, Convergència and Esquerra Republicana decided to join, and they presented themselves under the coalition named "Junts pel sí" (in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], "[[Together for Yes]]"). Junts pel sí won 62 seats and was the most voted party, and CUP (Candidatura d'Unitat Popular, far-left and independentist party) won another 10, so the sum of all the independentist forces was 72 seats, reaching an absolute majority of seats for the independentist forces, but not in number of individual votes that was 47,74% of the total.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://resultats.parlament2015.cat/09AU/DAU09999CM_L4.htm |title=Resultats provisionals 27S |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=gencat.cat |publisher=Generalitat de Catalunya |access-date=2015-09-29 }}</ref>

===Statutes of Autonomy===
{{main|Autonomous communities of Spain|Statute of Autonomy}}
[[File:Estatutf.gif|thumb|The First Statute of Catalonia, 1932]]
The [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia]] is the fundamental organic law, second only to the Spanish Constitution from which the Statute originates.

In the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] Catalonia, along with the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], was defined as a "[[nationalities and regions of Spain|nationality]]". The same constitution gave Catalonia the automatic right to autonomy, which resulted in the [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 1979]].

Both the 1979 Statute of Autonomy and the current one, approved in 2006, state that "Catalonia, as a nationality, exercises its self-government constituted as an Autonomous Community in accordance with the Constitution and with the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia, which is its basic institutional law, always under the law in Spain".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gencat.net/generalitat/eng/estatut/titol_preliminar.htm#a1 |title=First article of the Statute of Autonomy of Catalunya |publisher=Gencat.net |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref>

The Preamble of the 2006 Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia states that the [[Parliament of Catalonia]] has defined Catalonia as a [[nation]], but that "the Spanish Constitution recognizes Catalonia's national reality as a nationality".<ref>[http://www.constitucion.es/constitucion/castellano/titulo_preliminar.html Constitución Española, Título Preliminar]. {{wayback|df=yes|url=http://www.constitucion.es/constitucion/castellano/titulo_preliminar.html |date=20071013022212 }}</ref> While the Statute was approved by and sanctioned by both the Catalan and Spanish parliaments, and later by referendum in Catalonia, it has been subject to a legal challenge by the surrounding autonomous regions of Aragon, Balearic Islands and the Valencian Community,<ref>{{cite web|author=Europa Press/Madrid |url=http://www.hoy.es/prensa/20061115/nacional/admitidos-recursos-aragon-valencia_20061115.html |title=Admitidos los recursos de Aragón, Valencia y Baleares contra el Estatuto catalán. |publisher=Hoy.es |date=1 December 1997 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> as well as by the conservative [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]]. The objections are based on various issues such as disputed [[cultural heritage]] but, especially, on the Statute's alleged breaches of the principle of "solidarity between regions" in fiscal and educational matters enshrined by the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Constitution]].<ref>{{cite web |author=El País |url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/anos/encarnizada/batalla/politica/elpepuesp/20100416elpepunac_26/Tes |title=Cuatro años de encarnizada batalla política. |publisher=El País |date=29 June 2010 |accessdate=29 June 2010}}</ref>

Spain's [[Constitutional Court of Spain|Constitutional Court]] assessed the disputed articles and on 28 June 2010, issued its judgment on the principal allegation of unconstitutionality presented by the People's Party in 2006. The judgment granted clear passage to 182 articles of the 223 that make up the fundamental text. The court approved 73 of the 114 articles that the People's Party had contested, while declaring 14 articles unconstitutional in whole or in part and imposing a restrictive interpretation on 27 others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/retoque/74/articulos/recurridos/elpepunac/20100629elpepinac_4/Tes |title=Ni un retoque en 74 artículos recurridos |publisher=El País |accessdate=29 June 2010}}</ref> The court accepted the specific provision that described Catalonia as a "nation", however ruled that it was a historical and cultural term with no legal weight, and that Spain remained the only nation recognised by the constitution.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.scotsman.com/news/Catalonia-39is-not-a-nation39.6412380.jp |title=Catalonia 'is not a nation' 10 July 2010 |publisher=News.scotsman.com |date= 10 July 2010|accessdate=6 January 2011 |location=Edinburgh}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.matthewbennett.es/60/is-catalonia-a-nation-or-a-nationality-or-is-spain-the-only-nation-in-spain/ |title=Is Catalonia a nation or a nationality, or is Spain the only nation in Spain? |publisher=Matthewbennett.es |accessdate=6 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Fiona Govan in Madrid 1:59PM BST 29 June 2010 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/7861118/Catalonia-can-call-itself-a-nation-rules-Spains-top-court.html |title=Catalonia can call itself a 'nation', rules Spain's top court 29 Jun 2010 |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=29 June 2010 |accessdate=6 January 2011 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16490065 |title=A nationality, not a nation Jul 1st 2010 |publisher=Economist.com |date= 1 July 2010|accessdate=6 January 2011}}</ref>

===Government and law===
{{main|Generalitat of Catalonia}}
[[File:Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya 1.jpg|thumb|''[[Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya]]'']]

The Catalan Statute of Autonomy establishes that Catalonia is organised politically through the [[Generalitat of Catalonia]], conformed by the [[Parliament of Catalonia]], the Presidency of the Generalitat, the Government or Executive Council and the other institutions created by the Parliament.

The seat of the Executive Council is the city of [[Barcelona]]. Since the restoration of the Generalitat on the return of democracy in Spain, the [[List of Presidents of the Generalitat de Catalunya|presidents of Catalonia]] have been [[Jordi Pujol i Soley]] (1980–2003), [[Pasqual Maragall i Mira]] (2003–2006), [[José Montilla]] (2006–2010) and [[Artur Mas i Gavarró]] incumbent {{as of|2010|lc=on}}.

===Security forces===
{{main|Mossos d'Esquadra}}
Catalonia has its own police force, the ''[[Mossos d'Esquadra]]'' (officially called  ''Mossos d'Esquadra-Policia de la Generalitat ''), whose origins date back to the 18th century. Since 1980 they have been under the command of the Generalitat, and since 1994 they have expanded in number in order to replace the national [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]] and [[National Police Corps]], which report directly to the Homeland Department of Spain. The national bodies retain personnel within Catalonia to exercise functions of national scope such as overseeing ports, airports, coasts, international borders, custom offices, the identification of documents and arms control, inmigration control, terrorism prevention, arms trafficking prevention, amongst others.

Most of the justice system is administered by national judicial institutions. The [[criminal justice]] system is uniform throughout Spain, while [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] is administered separately within Catalonia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://civil.udg.es/normacivil/catalunya.htm |title=Legislació civil catalana |publisher=Civil.udg.es |date=20 July 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref>

[[Navarre]], the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and Catalonia are the Spanish regions with the highest degree of autonomy in terms of [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement]].

===Administrative and territorial divisions===

Catalonia is organised territorially into [[province]]s, further subdivided into [[comarca|comarques]] and [[municipality|municipalities]]. The 2006 Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia establishes the administrative organisation of three local authorities: [[vegueria|vegueries]], comarques, and municipalities.

====Provinces====
{{further|Provinces of Spain}}
Catalonia is divided administratively into four provinces, the governing body of which is the Deputation ({{lang-ca|Diputació}}, {{lang-es|Diputación}}).

====Comarques====
{{main|Comarques of Catalonia}}
Comarques (Shires) are entities composed by the municipalities to manage their responsibilities and services.  The current regional division has its roots in a decree of the Generalitat de Catalunya of 1936, in effect until 1939, when it was suppressed by Franco.  In 1987 the Government adopted the territorial division again and in 1988 three new comarques were added ([[Alta Ribagorça]], [[Pla d'Urgell]] and [[Pla de l'Estany]]), and in 2015 was created the last comarca, the [[Moianès]].  At present there are 41.

The comarca of [[Val d'Aran]] (Aran Valley) has a special status and its autonomous government is named ''[[Conselh Generau d'Aran]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/CCAA/ca-l16-1990.html# |title=Ley 16/1990, de 13 de julio, sobre el régimen especial del Valle de Arán. |author= |work= |publisher=Noticias Jurídicas |accessdate=20 July 2010}}</ref>

====Vegueries====
{{main|Vegueries of Catalonia}}
The ''vegueria'' is a new type of division defined as a specific territorial area for the exercise of government and inter-local cooperation with legal personality. The current Statute of Autonomy states vegueries are intended to supersede provinces in Catalonia, and take over many of functions of the comarques.

The territorial plan of Catalonia (''Pla territorial general de Catalunya'') provided six general functional areas,<ref>{{cite web|title=Pla territorial general de Catalunya |url=http://www10.gencat.net/ptop/AppJava/cat/plans/general/ptgeneral.jsp |publisher=Generalitat de Catalunya |accessdate=20 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100704031039/http://www10.gencat.net/ptop/AppJava/cat/plans/general/ptgeneral.jsp |archivedate=4 July 2010 }}</ref> but was amended by Law 24/2001, of 31 December, recognizing the [[Alt Pirineu i Aran]] as a new functional area differentiated of Ponent.<ref>[http://www10.gencat.net/ptop/AppJava/cat/plans/parcials/ptapa/aprovacio_definitiva.jsp Aprovació del Pla territorial parcial de l'Alt Pirineu i Aran]. {{wayback|df=yes|url=http://www10.gencat.net/ptop/AppJava/cat/plans/parcials/ptapa/aprovacio_definitiva.jsp |date=20080513132200 }}</ref>  On 14 July 2010 the Catalan Parliament approved the creation of the functional area of the [[Penedès]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://avui.elpunt.cat/noticia/article/3-politica/17-politica/195270.html |date=15 July 2010 |work=Avui |title=El Parlament reconeix l'àmbit funcional del Penedès}}</ref>

The [[Urban Region of Barcelona]] includes 5,217,864 people and covers an area of {{convert|2,268|km2|abbr=on}}, and about 1.7 million people live in a radius of {{convert|15|km2|abbr=on}} from Barcelona. The metropolitan area of the Urban Region includes cities such as [[L'Hospitalet de Llobregat]], [[Sabadell]], [[Terrassa]], [[Badalona]], [[Santa Coloma de Gramenet]] and [[Cornellà de Llobregat]].

In 1900, the population of Catalonia was 1,984,115 people and in 1970 it was 5,107,606.<ref>[http://www15.gencat.net/pres_catalunya_dades/AppPHP/cat/poblacio.htm Gencat.net].

In Catalonia that wave of internal migration arrived from several regions of Spain, especially [[Andalusia]], [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]] and [[Extremadura]].

Immigrants from other countries settled in Catalonia in the 1990s and 2000s; a large percentage came from [[Africa]] and [[Latin America]], and smaller numbers from [[Asia]] and [[Eastern Europe]], often settling in urban centers such as Barcelona and industrial areas.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

According to the linguistic census held by the Government of Catalonia in 2013, Spanish is the most spoken language in Catalonia (46.53% claim Spanish as "their own language"), followed by Catalan (37.26% claim Catalan as "their own language"). In everyday use, 11.95% of the population claim to use both languages equally, whereas 45.92% mainly use Spanish and 35.54% mainly use Catalan. There is a significant difference between the [[Barcelona metropolitan area]] (and, to a lesser extent, the [[Camp de Tarragona|Tarragona area]]), where Spanish is more spoken than Catalan, and the more rural Catalonia, where Catalan clearly prevails over Spanish.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.idescat.cat/dequavi/?TC=444&V0=15&V1=2 |title=Idescat.

Since the [[Statute of Autonomy of 1979]], [[Aranese]] (a dialect of [[Gascon dialect|Gascon]] [[Occitan]]) has also been official and subject to special protection in [[Val d'Aran]]. This small area of 7,000 inhabitants was the only place where a dialect of [[Occitan language|Occitan]] has received full official status. Then, on 9 August 2006, when the new Statute came into force, Occitan became official throughout Catalonia. Occitan is the mother tongue of 22.4% of the population of Val d'Aran.<ref>[http://www20.gencat.cat/docs/Llengcat/Documents/Dades_territori_poblacio/Altres/Arxius/EULP2008.pdf Enquesta d'usos lingüístics de la població 2008], cap. 8.

Originating in the historic territory of Catalonia, Catalan has enjoyed special status since the approval of the [[Statute of Autonomy of 1979]] which declares it to be "Catalonia's own language,"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gencat.cat/generalitat/eng/estatut/titol_preliminar.htm#a6 |title=Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia (Article 6) |publisher=Gencat.cat |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> a term which signifies a language given special legal status within a Spanish territory, or which is historically spoken within a given region. The other languages with official status are Spanish, which has official status throughout Spain, and Aranese Occitan, which enjoys co-official status with Catalan and Spanish in the [[Val d'Aran]].

Although not considered an "official language" in the same way as Catalan, Spanish, and Aranese, [[Catalan Sign Language]], with about 18,000 users in Catalonia,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=csc |title=Catalan Sign Language |publisher=Ethnologue.com |date=19 February 1999 |accessdate=1 July 2014}}</ref> is granted official recognition and support: "The public authorities shall guarantee the use of Catalan sign language and conditions of equality for deaf people who choose to use this language, which shall be the subject of education, protection and respect."<ref name="estatut_langs" />

Under the Franco dictatorship, Catalan was excluded from the public education system and all other official use, so that for example families were not allowed to officially register children with Catalan names.<ref>{{cite book| author = Joan Miralles i Montserrat|author2=Josep Massot i Muntaner| title = Entorn de la histáoria de la llengua| year = 2001| publisher = L'Abadia de Montserrat| isbn = 978-84-8415-309-2| page = 72 }}</ref> Although never completely banned, Catalan language publishing was severely restricted during the early 1940s, with only religious texts and small-run self-published texts being released.

Rural–urban migration originating in other parts of Spain also reduced the social use of Catalan in urban areas and increased the use of Spanish. Lately, a similar [[sociolinguistic]] phenomenon has occurred with foreign immigration. Catalan cultural activity increased in the 1960s and Catalan classes began thanks to the initiative of associations such as [[Òmnium Cultural]].

After the end of Franco's dictatorship, the newly established self-governing democratic institutions in Catalonia embarked on a long-term [[language policy]] to increase the use of Catalan<ref>{{cite book| author = M.

This policy, known as the "linguistic normalisation" (''normalització lingüística'' in Catalan, ''normalización lingüística'' in Spanish) has been supported by the vast majority of Catalan political parties through the last thirty years.

Today, Catalan is the main language of the Catalan autonomous government and the other public institutions that fall under its jurisdiction. Basic public education is given in Catalan, except for two hours per week of Spanish medium instruction. Businesses are required to display all information (e.g. menus, posters) in Catalan under penalty of fines. There is no obligation to display this information in either Occitan or Spanish, although there is no restriction on doing so in these or other languages. The use of fines was introduced in a 1997 linguistic law<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/Llengcat/menuitem.df5fba67cac781e7a129d410b0c0e1a0/?vgnextoid=d287f9465ff61110VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=d287f9465ff61110VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default&newLang=en_GB |title=Catalonia's linguistic law |publisher=0.gencat.cat |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> that aims to increase the public use of Catalan and defend the rights of Catalan speakers.

The law ensures that both Catalan and Spanish – being official languages – can be used by the citizens without prejudice in all public and private activities,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/Llengcat/menuitem.21576464db9e81e7a129d410b0c0e1a0/?vgnextoid=d287f9465ff61110VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=d287f9465ff61110VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=detall&contentid=bc1f657030672110VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD |title=Second article of Catalonia's linguistic law |publisher=0.gencat.cat |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> but primary education can only be taken in Catalan language.

Due to the [[Immigration to Spain|intense immigration]] which Spain in general and Catalonia in particular experienced in the first decade of the 21st century, many foreign languages are spoken in various cultural communities in Catalonia, of which [[Riff language|Rif]]-[[Berber language|Berber]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ub.edu/cusc/revista/lsc/hemeroteca/numero8/articles/comellas.pdf |title=DESCOBRIR LES LLENGÜES DE LA IMMIGRACIÓ |publisher=University of Barcelona |accessdate=6 October 2012}}</ref> [[Moroccan Arabic]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]]{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} and [[Urdu]] are the most common ones.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.europapress.es/cultura/noticia-catalunya-arabe-urdu-aparecen-lenguas-habituales-catalunya-creando-peligro-guetos-20090629150020.html |title=Árabe y urdu aparecen entre las lenguas habituales de Catalunya, creando peligro de guetos. |publisher=Europapress.es |date=29 June 2009 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref>

Recently, some of these policies have been criticised for trying to promote Catalan by imposing fines on businesses. For example, following the passage of a March 2010 law on Catalan cinema, which establishes that half of the movies shown in Catalan cinemas must be in Catalan, a general strike of 75% of the cinemas took place.<ref>{{cite web |author=Louis @ |url=http://www.cafebabel.co.uk/article/32923/catalan-cinema-dubbing-protest-law.html |title=Cinema law: rude case to not dub and subtitle all films in Catalan |publisher=Cafebabel.co.uk |date=25 March 2010 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> These criticisms mostly come from outside Catalonia, especially from [[conservative]], [[conservative liberal]]  and [[classical liberal]] circles of Spanish society.

In Catalonia, the Catalan language policy has been challenged by some Catalan intellectuals like [[Albert Boadella]]. Since 2006, the liberal [[Citizens - Party of the Citizenry]] has been one of the most consistent critics of the Catalan language policy within Catalonia. The local Catalan branch of the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] has a more ambiguous position on the issue: on one hand, it demands a bilingual Catalan–Spanish education and a more balanced language policy that would defend Catalan without favoring it over Spanish,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y3yT9t_IDA |title=Alicia Sánchez-Camacho responde en 'Tengo una pregunta para usted' |publisher=YouTube |date=11 November 2010 |accessdate=31 January 2014}}</ref> whereas on the other hand, a few local PP politicians have supported in their municipalities measures privileging Catalan over Spanish<ref>{{cite web|author=Regi&oacute;7 |url=http://www.regio7.cat/arreu-catalunya-espanya-mon/2010/10/28/ppc-votar-favor-dun-reglament-sobre-catala/110435.html |title=El PPC va votar a favor d´un reglament sobre el català - Regió7 :: El Diari de la Catalunya Central |publisher=Regio7.cat |accessdate=31 January 2014}}</ref> and it has defended some aspects of the official language policies, sometimes against the positions of its colleagues from other parts of Spain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3cat24.cat/noticia/889146/barcelones/Sanchez-Camacho-rebutja-la-postura-inicial-de-Bauza-de-derogar-la-llei-de-Normalitzacio-Linguistica-a-les-Illes-Balears |title=Sánchez-Camacho rebutja la postura inicial de Bauzá de derogar la llei de Normalització Lingüística a les Illes Balears |publisher=3cat24.cat |accessdate=31 January 2014}}</ref>

===Roads===
{{see also|List of primary highways in Catalonia}}
[[File:Autopista C-16.jpg|thumb|right|[[Autovía C-16|Autovia C-16]] (''Eix del Llobregat'').]]

There are {{convert|12000|km}} of roads throughout Catalonia.

The principal highways are [[Autopista AP-7|<span style="color:white; background:#039">'''&nbsp;AP-7&nbsp;'''</span>]] (''Autopista del Mediterrani'') and [[Autovía A-7|<span style="color:white; background:#039">'''&nbsp;A-7&nbsp;'''</span>]] (''Autovia del Mediterrani''). It follows the coast from the [[France|French border]] to [[Valencian Community|Valencia]], [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]] and [[Andalusia]]. The main roads generally radiate from Barcelona.  The A-2 and AP-2 connect inland and onward to Madrid.

Other major roads are:
* [[Autopista AP-2|<span style="color:white; background:#039">'''&nbsp;AP-2&nbsp;'''</span>]] [[Image:Spain traffic signal r200.svg|14px]]

Public-own roads in Catalonia are either managed by the autonomous government of Catalonia (e.g., <span style="color:white; background:#f00">'''&nbsp;C-&nbsp;'''</span> roads) or the [[Spanish Government]] (e.g., <span style="color:white; background:#039">'''&nbsp;AP-&nbsp;'''</span>, <span style="color:white; background:#039">'''&nbsp;A-&nbsp;'''</span>, <span style="color:white; background:#f00">'''&nbsp;N-&nbsp;'''</span> roads).

===Railways===
[[File:RN103007TarJPVL.JPG|thumb|right|[[AVE|High-speed train (AVE)]] at [[Camp de Tarragona]].]]
Catalonia saw the first railway construction in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in 1848, linking Barcelona with [[Mataró]]. Given the topography most lines radiate from Barcelona.  The city has both suburban and inter-city services.  The main east coast line runs through the province connecting with the [[SNCF]] (French Railways) at [[Portbou]] on the coast.

There are two publicly owned railway companies operating in Catalonia: the Catalan [[Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya|FGC]] that operates commuter and regional services, and the Spanish national [[RENFE]] that operates long-distance and high-speed rail services (AVE and Avant) and the main commuter and regional service ''[[Rodalies de Catalunya]]'', administered by the Catalan government since 2010.

[[High-speed rail]] ([[AVE]]) services from [[Madrid]] currently reach [[Lleida]], [[Tarragona]] and [[Barcelona]]. The official opening between Barcelona and Madrid took place 20 February 2008. The journey between Barcelona and Madrid now takes about two-and-a-half hours. A connection to the French high-speed TGV network has been completed, but is awaiting the completion of stations along the route to begin passenger service in April 2013.  This new line (currently the [[LGV Perpignan–Figueres|LGV Perpignan- Figueres Vilafant]]) passes through Girona and Figueres with a [[Perthus Tunnel|tunnel]] through the Pyrenees. There is a direct train from [[Barcelona Estació de França]] to [[Gare d'Austerlitz|Paris Austerlitz]] along the older railway tracks.

===Popular culture===
{{main|Traditions of Catalonia}}
[[Image:3d10 fm de vilafranca.jpg|thumb|upright|3 of 10 with ''folre'' and ''manilles'' built by the [[Castellers de Vilafranca]].]]

[[Castell]]s are one of the main manifestations of Catalan popular culture. The activity consists in constructing human towers by competing ''colles castelleres'' (teams). This practice originated in the southern part of Catalonia during the 18th century. The tradition of [[Castell|els Castells i els Castellers]] was declared Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by [[UNESCO]] in 2010.

The [[sardana]] is the most characteristic Catalan popular dance, other groups also practice ''[[Ball de bastons]]'', ''moixiganga'', [[galop]]s or ''[[jota (music)|jota]]'' in the southern part. Musically, the ''[[Habanera (music)|Havaneres]]'' are also characteristic in some marine localities of the [[Costa Brava]] especially during the summer months when these songs are sung outdoors accompanied by a ''cremat'' of burned rum. Other music styles are [[Catalan rumba]], [[Rock català|Catalan rock]] and [[Nova Cançó]].

In the greater celebrations other elements of the Catalan popular culture are usually present: the parades of ''[[Gegants i capgrossos|gegants]]'' (giants) and ''[[correfoc]]s'' of devils and firecrackers. Another traditional celebration in Catalonia is ''[[Patum de Berga|La Patum de Berga]]'' declared Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by [[UNESCO]] in 25 November 2005.<ref>[http://www.bergueda.com/lapatum/festa.asp Patum de Berga]. {{wayback|df=yes|url=http://www.bergueda.com/lapatum/festa.asp |date=20090227050231 }}</ref>

In addition to traditional local Catalan culture, traditions from other parts of Spain can be found as a result of migration from other regions, for instance the celebration of the Andalusian [[Seville Fair|Feria de Abril]] in Catalonia. 

On 28 July 2010, [[Ban on bullfighting in Catalonia|Catalonia became the second Spanish territory]], after the Canary Islands, to forbid bullfighting. The ban, which went into effect on 1 January 2012, had originated in a popular petition supported by over 180,000 signatures.<ref>[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5hCUSkWOROQvtXQvPrgGjjE3dZWag The Press Association: Catalonia votes to ban bullfighting, 28 July 2010].{{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref>
