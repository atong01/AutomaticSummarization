Paper was not used in Europe for drawing until the 15th century, but became increasingly available after 1500. Pencils were used more often for drawing by 1600.

Such licensure usually requires an accredited university degree, successful completion of exams, and a training period. The use of terms and titles, and the representation of oneself as an architect is restricted to licensed individuals by law, although in general, derivatives such as<space/><italics><link><target>architectural designer</target></link></italics><space/>are not legally protected.</paragraph><paragraph>To practice architecture implies the ability to practice independently of supervision. The term<space/><italics><link><target>building design</target></link><space/>professional</italics><space/>(or<space/><italics>Design professional)</italics>, by contrast, is a much broader term that includes professionals who practice independently under an alternate profession, such as<space/><link><target>engineering</target></link><space/>professionals, or those who assist in the practice architecture under the supervision of a licensed architect, such as<space/><italics><link><target>architectural technologist</target><trail>s</trail></link></italics><space/>and<space/><italics><link><target>intern architect</target><trail>s</trail></link></italics>. In many places, independent, non-licensed individuals may perform design services outside the professional restrictions, such design houses and other smaller structures.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Practice</heading><paragraph>In the architectural profession, technical knowledge, management, and an understanding of business are as important as design. An architect accepts a commission from a client. The commission might involve preparing feasibility reports, building audits, the design of a building or of several buildings, structures, and the spaces among them. The architect participates in developing the requirements the client wants in the building. Throughout the project (planning to occupancy), the architect co-ordinates a design team.<space/><link><target>Structural engineer</target><part>Structural</part></link>,<space/><link><target>mechanical engineer</target><part>mechanical</part></link>, and<space/><link><target>electrical engineer</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and other specialists, are hired by the client or the architect, who must ensure that the work is co-ordinated to construct the design.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Design role</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Rem Koolhaas SCL.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>300px</part><part>Architect<space/><link><target>Rem Koolhaas</target></link><space/>inspecting a model of the<space/><link><target>Seattle Central Library</target></link></part></link>The architect hired by a client is responsible for creating a design concept that meets the requirements of that client and provides a facility suitable to the required use. In that, the architect must meet with and question the client [extensively] to ascertain all the requirements and nuances of the planned project. This information, known as a program or brief, is essential to producing a project that meets all the needs of the ownerit is a guide for the architect in creating the design concept.</paragraph><paragraph>Architects deal with local and federal jurisdictions about regulations and<space/><link><target>building code</target><trail>s</trail></link>. The architect might need to comply with local<space/><link><target>Urban planning</target><part>planning</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>zoning</target></link><space/>laws, such as required setbacks, height limitations, parking requirements, transparency requirements (windows) and<space/><link><target>land use</target></link>.

In many jurisdictions, mandatory certification or assurance of the work is required.</paragraph><paragraph>Depending on the client's needs and the jurisdiction's requirements, the spectrum of the architect's services may be extensive (detailed document preparation and construction review) or less inclusive (such as allowing a contractor to exercise considerable<space/><link><target>design-build</target></link><space/>functions).

The experience requirement for degree candidates is usually satisfied by a practicum or internship (usually two to three years, depending on jurisdiction). Finally, a Registration Examination or a series of exams is required prior to licensure.</paragraph><paragraph>Professionals engaged in the design and supervision of construction projects prior to the late 19th century were not necessarily trained in a separate architecture program in an academic setting.

Combinations of these structures are also common. Fixed fees are usually based on a project's allocated construction cost and can range between 4 and 12% of new construction cost, for commercial and institutional projects, depending on a project's size and complexity. Residential projects range from 12 to 20%. Renovation projects typically command higher percentages, as high as 15-20%.
