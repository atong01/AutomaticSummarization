The majority of camouflage methods aim for crypsis, often through a general resemblance to the background, high contrast<space/><link><target>disruptive coloration</target></link>, eliminating shadow, and<space/><link><target>countershading</target></link>. In the open ocean, where there is no background, the principal methods of camouflage are transparency, silvering, and countershading, while the<space/><link><target>bioluminescence</target><part>ability to produce light</part></link><space/>is among other things used for<space/><link><target>counter-illumination</target></link><space/>on the undersides of<space/><link><target>cephalopod</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>such as<space/><link><target>squid</target></link>. Some animals, such as<space/><link><target>chameleon</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>octopus</target><trail>es</trail></link>, are capable of actively changing their skin pattern and colours, whether for camouflage or for signalling.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Military camouflage</target></link><space/>was spurred by the increasing range and accuracy of firearms in the 19th century. In particular the replacement of the inaccurate<space/><link><target>musket</target></link><space/>with the<space/><link><target>rifle</target></link><space/>made personal concealment in battle a survival skill. In the 20th century, military camouflage developed rapidly, especially during the<space/><link><target>First World War</target></link>. On land, artists such as<space/><link><target>Andr Mare</target></link><space/>designed camouflage schemes and observation posts disguised as trees.<space/><link><target>Ship camouflage</target><part>At sea</part></link>, warships and troop carriers were painted in<space/><link><target>dazzle camouflage</target><part>dazzle</part></link><space/>patterns that were highly visible, but designed to confuse enemy gunners as to the target's speed, range, and heading. During and after the<space/><link><target>Second World War</target></link>, a variety of camouflage schemes were used for<space/><link><target>aircraft camouflage</target><part>aircraft</part></link><space/>and for ground vehicles in different theatres of war. The use of radar since the mid-20th century has largely made camouflage for fixed-wing military aircraft obsolete.</paragraph><paragraph>Non-military use of camouflage includes making<space/><link><target>cell site</target><part>cell telephone towers</part></link><space/>less obtrusive and helping hunters to approach wary game animals. Patterns derived from military camouflage are frequently used in fashion clothing, exploiting their strong designs and sometimes their symbolism.

Grouse, if not destroyed at some period of their lives, would increase in countless numbers; they are known to suffer largely from [[birds of prey]]; and hawks are guided by eyesight to their prey, so much so, that on parts of the Continent persons are warned not to keep white pigeons, as being the most liable to destruction.
