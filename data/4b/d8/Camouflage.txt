'''Camouflage''' is the use of any combination of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment, either by making animals or objects hard to see ([[crypsis]]), or by disguising them as something else ([[mimicry|mimesis]]). Examples include the [[leopard]]'s spotted coat, the [[battledress]] of a modern [[soldier]], and the [[leaf-mimic katydid]]'s wings.<ref name=Forbes>Forbes, 2009. pp. 50–51.</ref> A third approach, motion dazzle, confuses the observer with a conspicuous pattern, making the object visible but momentarily harder to locate. The majority of camouflage methods aim for crypsis, often through a general resemblance to the background, high contrast [[disruptive coloration]], eliminating shadow, and [[countershading]]. In the open ocean, where there is no background, the principal methods of camouflage are transparency, silvering, and countershading, while the [[bioluminescence|ability to produce light]] is among other things used for [[counter-illumination]] on the undersides of [[cephalopod]]s such as [[squid]]. Some animals, such as [[chameleon]]s and [[octopus]]es, are capable of actively changing their skin pattern and colours, whether for camouflage or for signalling.

[[Military camouflage]] was spurred by the increasing range and accuracy of firearms in the 19th century. In particular the replacement of the inaccurate [[musket]] with the [[rifle]] made personal concealment in battle a survival skill. In the 20th century, military camouflage developed rapidly, especially during the [[First World War]]. On land, artists such as [[André Mare]] designed camouflage schemes and observation posts disguised as trees. [[Ship camouflage|At sea]], warships and troop carriers were painted in [[dazzle camouflage|dazzle]] patterns that were highly visible, but designed to confuse enemy gunners as to the target's speed, range, and heading. During and after the [[Second World War]], a variety of camouflage schemes were used for [[aircraft camouflage|aircraft]] and for ground vehicles in different theatres of war. The use of radar since the mid-20th century has largely made camouflage for fixed-wing military aircraft obsolete.

Non-military use of camouflage includes making [[cell site|cell telephone towers]] less obtrusive and helping hunters to approach wary game animals. Patterns derived from military camouflage are frequently used in fashion clothing, exploiting their strong designs and sometimes their symbolism. Camouflage themes recur in modern art, and both figuratively and literally in science fiction and works of literature.

==History==

===In zoology===
[[File:Octopus cyaneain Kona.jpg|thumb|upright|Octopuses like this ''[[Octopus cyanea]]'' can change colour (and shape) for camouflage]]
In ancient Greece, [[Aristotle]] (384 BC – 322 BC) commented on the colour-changing abilities, both for camouflage and for [[Signalling theory|signalling]], of [[cephalopod]]s including the octopus, in his ''[[Historia animalium]]'':<ref name=Aristotle>Aristotle (c. 350 BC). ''Historia Animalium''. IX, 622a: 2–10. Cited in Borrelli, Luciana; Gherardi, Francesca; Fiorito, Graziano (2006). ''A catalogue of body patterning in Cephalopoda''. Firenze University Press.

Camouflage has been a topic of interest and research in [[zoology]] for well over a century. According to [[Charles Darwin]]'s 1859 theory of [[natural selection]],<ref name=darwinoos>Darwin, 1859.</ref> features such as camouflage [[evolution|evolved]] by providing individual animals with a reproductive advantage, enabling them to leave more offspring, on average, than other members of the same [[species]]. In his ''[[Origin of Species]]'', Darwin wrote:<ref name=DarwinOOS84>Darwin, 1859. p. 84.</ref>

{{quote|When we see leaf-eating insects green, and bark-feeders mottled-grey; the alpine ptarmigan white in winter, the [[red grouse|red-grouse]] the colour of [[Calluna vulgaris|heather]], and the [[black grouse|black-grouse]] that of [[peat]]y earth, we must believe that these tints are of service to these birds and insects in preserving them from danger. Grouse, if not destroyed at some period of their lives, would increase in countless numbers; they are known to suffer largely from [[birds of prey]]; and hawks are guided by eyesight to their prey, so much so, that on parts of the Continent persons are warned not to keep white pigeons, as being the most liable to destruction. Hence I can see no reason to doubt that natural selection might be most effective in giving the proper colour to each kind of grouse, and in keeping that colour, when once acquired, true and constant.|Darwin<ref name=DarwinOOS84/>}}

The English zoologist [[Poulton, E. B.|Edward Bagnall Poulton]] studied [[animal coloration]], especially camouflage. In his 1890 book ''[[The Colours of Animals]]'', he classified different types such as "special protective resemblance" (where an animal looks like another object), or "general aggressive resemblance" (where a predator blends in with the background, enabling it to approach prey). His experiments showed that swallowtailed moth [[pupae]] were camouflaged to match the backgrounds on which they were reared as [[larvae]].<ref>Poulton, 1890. p. 111.</ref>{{efn|A letter from [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] to Darwin of March 8, 1868 mentioned such colour change: "Would you like to see the specimens of pupæ of butterflies whose colours have changed in accordance with the colour of the surrounding objects?

Fold-out after p. 339.</ref> was at that time considered to be the main method of camouflage, as when [[Frank Evers Beddard]] wrote in 1892 that "tree-frequenting animals are often green in colour. Among vertebrates numerous species of [[parrots]], [[iguanas]], [[tree frog|tree-frogs]], and the [[Morelia viridis|green tree-snake]] are examples".<ref name=Beddard83>Beddard, 1892. p. 83.</ref> Beddard did however briefly mention other methods, including the "alluring coloration" of the [[Hymenopus bicornis|flower mantis]] and the possibility of a different mechanism in the [[Anthocharis cardamines|orange tip butterfly]]. He wrote that "the scattered green spots upon the under surface of the wings might have been intended for a rough sketch of the small flowerets of the plant [an [[umbellifer]]], so close is their mutual resemblance."<ref>Beddard, 1892. p. 87.</ref>{{efn|Cott explains Beddard's observation as a coincident disruptive pattern.<ref>Cott, 1940. pp. 74–75.</ref>}} He also explained the coloration of sea fish such as the [[mackerel]]: "Among [[pelagic]] fish it is common to find the upper surface dark-coloured and the lower surface white, so that the animal is inconspicuous when seen either from above or below."<ref>Beddard, 1892. p. 122.</ref>

[[File:PeacockInTheWoods.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Abbott Thayer]]'s 1907 painting ''Peacock in the Woods'' depicted a [[peacock]] as if it were camouflaged.]]

The artist [[Abbott Handerson Thayer]] formulated what is sometimes called Thayer's Law, the principle of [[countershading]].<ref>Thayer, 1909.</ref> However, he overstated the case in the 1909 book ''[[Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom]]'', arguing that "All patterns and colors whatsoever of all animals that ever preyed or are preyed on are under certain normal circumstances obliterative" (that is, cryptic camouflage), and that "Not one '[[mimicry]]' mark, not one '[[aposematism|warning color]]'...&nbsp;nor any '[[sexual selection|sexually selected]]' color, exists anywhere in the world where there is not every reason to believe it the very best conceivable device for the concealment of its wearer",<ref>Forbes, 2009. p. 77, citing Thayer, 1909. pp. 5, 16.</ref> and using paintings such as ''Peacock in the Woods'' (1907) to reinforce his argument.<ref name=RothenbergOnThayer>Rothenberg, 2011. pp. 132–133.</ref>

The English zoologist [[Cott, H. B.|Hugh Cott]]'s 1940 book ''[[Adaptive Coloration in Animals]]'' corrected Thayer's errors, sometimes sharply: "Thus we find Thayer straining the theory to a fantastic extreme in an endeavour to make it cover almost every type of coloration in the animal kingdom."<ref name=Cott172>Cott, 1940. pp. 172–173.</ref> Cott built on Thayer's discoveries, developing a comprehensive view of camouflage based on "maximum disruptive contrast", countershading and hundreds of examples. The book explained how disruptive camouflage worked, using streaks of boldly contrasting colour, paradoxically making objects less visible by breaking up their outlines.<ref name=CottCh4>Cott, 1940. pp. 47–67.</ref> While Cott was more systematic and balanced in his view than Thayer, and did include some experimental evidence on the effectiveness of camouflage,<ref name=CottCh10>Cott, 1940. Chapter 10. pp. 174–186.</ref> his 500-page textbook was, like Thayer's, mainly a [[natural history]] narrative which illustrated theories with examples.<ref>Forbes, 2009. pp. 153–155.</ref>

Camouflage is a soft-tissue feature that is rarely preserved in the [[fossil]] record, but rare fossilised skin samples from the [[Cretaceous]] period show that some marine reptiles were countershaded. The skins, pigmented with dark-coloured eumelanin, reveal that both [[leatherback turtle]]s and [[mosasaur]]s had dark backs and light bellies.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Skin pigmentation provides evidence of convergent melanism in extinct marine reptiles | author=Lindgren, Johan and Peter Sjövall, Ryan M.

Ship camouflage was occasionally used in ancient times. [[Philostratus]] (c. 172–250 AD) wrote in his ''[[Imagines (work by Philostratus)|Imagines]]'' that Mediterranean pirate ships could be painted blue-gray for concealment.<ref>Casson, 1995. pp. 211–212.</ref> [[Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus|Vegetius]] (c. 360–400 AD) says that "Venetian blue" (sea green) was used in the [[Gallic Wars]], when [[Julius Caesar]] sent his ''speculatoria navigia'' (reconnaissance boats) to gather intelligence along the coast of Britain. The ships were painted entirely in bluish-green wax, with sails, ropes and crew the same colour.<ref>Casson, 1995. p. 235.</ref> There is little evidence of military use of camouflage on land before 1800, but two unusual ceramics show men in [[Peru]]'s [[Mochica]] culture from before 500 AD, hunting birds with blowpipes which are fitted with a kind of shield near the mouth, perhaps to conceal the hunters' hands and faces.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Jett, Stephen C | date=March 1991| title=Further Information on the Geography of the Blowgun and Its Implications for Early Transoceanic Contacts| journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers| volume=81 | issue=1 | pages=89–102 | jstor=2563673 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8306.1991.tb01681.x}}</ref> Another early source is a 15th-century French manuscript, ''The Hunting Book of Gaston Phebus'', showing a horse pulling a cart which contains a hunter armed with a crossbow under a cover of branches, perhaps serving as a hide for shooting game.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Crossbow | publisher=Longmans, Green | author=Payne-Gallwey, Ralph | year=1903 | pages=11}}</ref> [[Jamaican Maroons]] are said to have used plant materials as camouflage in the [[First Maroon War]] (c. 1655–1740).<ref>{{cite book | author=Saunders, Nicholas | title=The People of the Caribbean: An Encyclopedia of Archaeology and Traditional Culture | year=2005 | publisher=ABC-CLIO}}</ref>

The development of military camouflage was driven by the increasing range and accuracy of infantry firearms in the 19th century. In particular the replacement of the inaccurate [[musket]] with weapons such as the [[Baker rifle]] made personal concealment in battle essential. For example, two [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic War]] skirmishing units of the [[British Army]], the [[Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)|95th Rifle Regiment]] and the 60th Rifle Regiment, were the first to adopt camouflage in the form of a [[rifle green]] jacket, while the Line regiments continued to wear scarlet tunics.<ref>{{cite book | author=Haythornthwaite, P | title=British Rifleman 1797–1815| publisher=Osprey Publishing | year=2002 | page=20 | isbn=978-1841761770}}</ref> A contemporary study in 1800 by the English artist and soldier [[Charles Hamilton Smith]] provided evidence that grey uniforms were less visible than green ones at a range of 150 yards.<ref>Newark, 2007. p. 43.</ref>

In the [[American Civil War]], rifle units such as the 1st United States Sharp Shooters (in the [[Union (American Civil War)|Federal]] army) similarly wore green jackets while other units wore more conspicuous colours.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.historynet.com/killers-in-green-coats.htm | title=Killers in Green Coats | publisher=Weider History Group | date=20 February 2008 | accessdate=8 July 2012}}</ref> The first British Army unit to adopt [[khaki (colour)|khaki]] uniforms was the [[Corps of Guides (British India)|Corps of Guides]] at [[Peshawar]], when [[Harry Burnett Lumsden|Sir Harry Lumsden]] and his second in command, [[William Stephen Raikes Hodson|William Hodson]] introduced a "drab" uniform in 1848.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Khaki Uniform 1848-49: First Introduction by Lumsden and Hodson | author= | journal=Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research | year=2004 | volume=82 | issue=Winter | pages=341–347}}</ref> Hodson wrote that it would be more appropriate for the hot climate, and help make his troops "invisible in a land of dust".<ref>{{cite book | title=Twelve Years of a Soldier's Life in India, being extracts from the letters of the late Major WSR Hodson | publisher=John W.

In the [[Second World War]], the zoologist Hugh Cott, a [[protégé]] of Kerr, worked to persuade the British army to use more effective camouflage techniques, including countershading, but, like Kerr and Thayer in the First World War, with limited success. For example, he painted two rail-mounted coastal guns, one in conventional style, one [[Countershading|countershaded]]. In aerial photographs, the countershaded gun was essentially invisible.<ref>Forbes, 2009. pp. 149–150.</ref> The power of aerial observation and attack led every warring nation to camouflage targets of all types. The [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Red Army]] created the comprehensive [[military doctrine|doctrine]] of ''[[Russian military deception|Maskirovka]]'' for military deception, including the use of camouflage.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a112903.pdf | title=Maskirovka: The Soviet System of Camouflage | publisher=U.S. Army Russian Institute | year=1981 | accessdate=8 July 2012 | author=Keating, Kenneth C}}</ref> For example, during the [[Battle of Kursk]], [[Mikhail Katukov|General Katukov]], the commander of the Soviet 1st Tank Army, remarked that the enemy "did not suspect that our well-camouflaged tanks were waiting for him.

{{further|List of camouflage methods}}

Camouflage can be achieved by different methods, described below. Most of the methods contribute to crypsis, helping to hide against a background; but mimesis and motion dazzle protect without hiding. Methods may be applied on their own or in combination.

=== Crypsis===
{{see also|Crypsis}}

[[Crypsis]] means blending with the background, making the animal or military equipment hard to see (or to detect in other ways, such as by sound or scent. Visual crypsis can be achieved in many different ways.<ref name=Forbes />

====Resemblance to the surroundings====
Some animals' colours and patterns resemble a particular natural background. This is an important component of camouflage in all environments. For instance, tree-dwelling [[parakeet]]s are mainly green; [[woodcock]]s of the forest floor are brown and speckled; reedbed [[bittern]]s are streaked brown and buff; in each case the animal's coloration matches the hues of its habitat.<ref name=CottCh1>Cott, 1940. Chapter 1: General Colour Resemblance. pp. 5–19.</ref><ref>Forbes, 2009. p. 51.</ref> Similarly, [[Xerocole|desert animals]] are almost all desert coloured in tones of sand, buff, ochre, and brownish grey, whether they are mammals like the [[gerbil]] or [[fennec fox]], birds such as the [[desert lark]] or [[sandgrouse]], or reptiles like the [[skink]] or [[Cerastes (genus)|horned viper]].<ref>Cott, 1940. pp. 5–6.</ref> Military uniforms, too, generally resemble their backgrounds; for example [[khaki]] uniforms are a muddy or dusty colour, originally chosen for service in South Asia.<ref>Newark, 2007. pp. 45–46.</ref> Many<ref name=Cott17>Cott, 1940. p. 17.</ref> moths show [[industrial melanism]], including the [[Biston betularia|peppered moth]] which has coloration that blends in with tree bark.<ref>{{cite book | title=Collins Wild Guide: Butterflies and Moths | publisher=HarperCollins | author=Still, J | year=1996 | page=158 | isbn=0-00-220010-4}}</ref> The coloration of these insects evolved between 1860 and 1940 to match the changing colour of the tree trunks on which they rest, from pale and mottled to almost black in polluted areas.<ref name=Cott17/>{{efn|Before 1860, unpolluted tree trunks were often covered in pale [[lichen]]s; polluted trunks were bare, and often nearly black.}} This is taken by zoologists as evidence that camouflage is influenced by [[natural selection]], as well as demonstrating that it changes where necessary to resemble the local background.<ref name=Cott17/>

====Disruptive coloration====

{{main|disruptive coloration}}
[[Image:Disruptive Coloration by Hugh Cott 1940.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the principle of "maximum disruptive contrast" by [[Hugh Cott]], 1940]]

Disruptive patterns use strongly contrasting, non-repeating markings such as spots or stripes to break up the outlines of an animal or military vehicle,<ref name=Barbosa>{{cite journal | title=Cuttlefish camouflage: The effects of substrate contrast and size in evoking uniform, mottle or disruptive body patterns | author=Barbosa, A; Mathger, LM; Buresch, KC; Kelly, J; Chubb, C; Chiao, C; Hanlon RT | journal=Vision Research | year=2008 | volume=48 | pages=1242–1253 | doi=10.1016/j.visres.2008.02.011 | pmid=18395241 | issue=10}}</ref> or to conceal telltale features, especially the eyes, as in the [[common frog]].<ref>Cott, 1940. pp. 83–91.</ref> Disruptive patterns may use more than one method to defeat visual systems such as [[edge detection]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gestaltrevision.be/pdfs/oxford/Osorio&Cuthill-Camouflage_and_perceptual_organization_in_the_animal_kingdom.pdf | title=Camouflage and perceptual organization in the animal kingdom | accessdate=25 October 2013 | author=Osorio, Daniel; Cuthill, Innes C.}}</ref> Predators like the [[leopard]] use disruptive camouflage to help them approach prey, while potential prey like the [[Egyptian nightjar]] use it to avoid detection by predators.<ref name=Disruptive>{{cite journal | title=Disruptive contrast in animal camouflage | author=Stevens, M; Cuthill, IC; Windsor, AMM; Walker, HJ | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B | date=7 October 2006 | volume=273 | issue=1600 | pages=2433–2436 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2006.3614 | pmc=1634902 | pmid=16959632}}</ref> Disruptive patterning is common in military usage, both for uniforms and for military vehicles. Disruptive patterning, however, does not always achieve crypsis on its own, as an animal or a military target may be given away by factors like shape, shine, and shadow.<ref name="Sweet">{{cite book | title=Transportation and Cargo Security: Threats and Solutions | publisher=Prentice Hall | author=Sweet, KM | year=2006 | page=219 | isbn=978-0-13-170356-8}}</ref><ref name=fm5-20>{{cite book | url=http://cartome.org/fm5-20-toc.htm | title=FM 5–20: Camouflage, Basic Principles | publisher=U.S. War Department | year=1944}}</ref><ref name='FM 20-3'>{{cite book | publisher=Department of the Army | title=Field Manual Headquarters No. 20-3 | date=30 August 1999 | url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/20-3/toc.htm | work=Camouflage, Concealment, and Decoys}}</ref>

The presence of bold skin markings does not in itself prove that an animal relies on camouflage, as that depends on its behaviour.<ref name=Roosevelt>{{cite journal | url=http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/handle/2246/470 | title=Revealing and concealing coloration in birds and mammals | author=Roosevelt, Theodore | journal=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History | year=1911 | volume=30 | issue=Article 8 | pages=119–231}} Roosevelt attacks Thayer on page 191, arguing that neither zebra nor giraffe are "'adequately obliterated' by countershading or coloration pattern or anything else."</ref> For example, although [[giraffe]]s have a high contrast pattern that could be disruptive coloration, the adults are extremely conspicuous when in the open. Some authors have argued that adult giraffes are cryptic, since when standing among trees and bushes they are hard to see at even a few metres' distance.<ref name="Mitchell2003">{{cite journal | author=Mitchell, G; Skinner, JD | year=2003 | title=On the origin, evolution and phylogeny of giraffes ''Giraffa camelopardalis'' | journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of South Africa | volume=58 | issue= 1| pages=51–73| doi=10.1080/00359190309519935| url=http://www.bringyou.to/GiraffeEvolution.pdf}}</ref> However, adult giraffes move about to gain the best view of an approaching predator, relying on their size and ability to defend themselves, even from lions, rather than on camouflage.<ref name="Mitchell2003"/> A different explanation is implied by the fact that young giraffes are far more vulnerable to predation than adults: more than half of all giraffe calves die within a year,<ref name="Mitchell2003"/> and giraffe mothers hide their calves, which spend much of the time lying down in cover while their mothers are away feeding. Since the presence of a mother nearby does not affect survival, it is argued that young giraffes must be extremely well camouflaged; this is supported by the fact that coat markings are strongly inherited.<ref name="Mitchell2003"/>

====Eliminating shadow====
[[File:Counteracting shadow.jpg|thumb|Camouflaged animals and vehicles are readily given away by their shapes and shadows. A flange helps to hide the shadow and a pale fringe breaks up and averages out any shadow that remains.]]
Some animals, such as the horned lizards of North America, have evolved elaborate measures to eliminate [[shadow]]. Their bodies are flattened, with the sides thinning to an edge; the animals habitually press their bodies to the ground; and their sides are fringed with white scales which effectively hide and disrupt any remaining areas of shadow there may be under the edge of the body.<ref name="Sherbrooke">{{cite book | title=Introduction to horned lizards of North America | publisher=University of California Press | author=Sherbrooke, WC | year=2003 | pages=117–118 | isbn=978-0-520-22825-2 | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zXlLdu3956gC&pg=PA118&lpg}}</ref> The theory that the body shape of the horned lizards which live in open desert is adapted to minimise shadow is supported by the one species which lacks fringe scales, the [[roundtail horned lizard]], which lives in rocky areas and resembles a rock. When this species is threatened, it makes itself look as much like a rock as possible by curving its back, emphasizing its three-dimensional shape.<ref name="Sherbrooke"/> Some species of butterflies, such as the speckled wood, ''[[Pararge aegeria]]'', minimise their shadows when perched by closing the wings over their backs, aligning their bodies with the sun, and tilting to one side towards the sun, so that the shadow becomes a thin inconspicuous line rather than a broad patch.<ref name=Cott104>Cott, 1940. pp 104–105.</ref> Similarly, some ground-nesting birds including the European nightjar select a resting position facing the sun.<ref name=Cott104/> The elimination of shadow was identified as a principle of military camouflage during the Second World War.<ref name="TTT">{{cite journal | author=U.S. War Department | title=Principles of Camouflage | journal=Tactical and Technical Trends | date=November 1943 | issue=37 | url=http://www.lonesentry.com/articles/ttt09/camouflage.html }}</ref>

====Self-decoration====
Some animals actively seek to hide by decorating themselves with materials such as twigs, sand, or pieces of shell from their environment, to break up their outlines, to conceal the features of their bodies, and to match their backgrounds. For example, a [[caddis fly]] larva builds a decorated case and lives almost entirely inside it; a [[Naxia tumida|decorator crab]] covers its back with seaweed, sponges and stones.<ref name=Forbes/> The [[Nymph (biology)|nymph]] of the predatory [[Reduvius personatus|masked bug]] uses its hind legs and a '[[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsal]] fan' to decorate its body with sand or dust. There are two layers of bristles ([[trichome]]s) over the body. On these, the nymph spreads an inner layer of fine particles and an outer layer of coarser particles. The camouflage may conceal the bug from both predators and prey.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Wierauch, C | year=2006 | title=Anatomy of disguise: camouflaging structures in nymphs of Some Reduviidae (Heteroptera) | journal=American Museum Novitates | issue=3542 | pages=1–18 |doi=10.1206/0003-0082(2006)3542[1:AODCSI]2.0.CO;2}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | last=Bates | first=Mary | title=Natural Bling: 6 Amazing Animals That Decorate Themselves | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/06/150610-animals-camouflage-decoration-bugs-science| publisher=National Geographic | accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref>

Similar principles can be applied for military purposes, for instance when a [[sniper]] wears a [[ghillie suit]] designed to be further camouflaged by decoration with materials such as tufts of grass from the sniper's immediate environment. Such suits were used as early as 1916, the British army having adopted "coats of motley hue and stripes of paint" for snipers.<ref>Forbes, 2009. pp. 102–103.</ref> Cott takes the example of the larva of the [[blotched emerald]] moth, which fixes a screen of fragments of leaves to its specially hooked bristles, to argue that military camouflage uses the same method, pointing out that the "device is ... essentially the same as one widely practised during the Great War for the concealment, not of caterpillars, but of caterpillar-tractors, [gun] battery positions, observation posts and so forth."<ref>Cott, 1940. p. 360.</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1=Ruxton | first1=Graeme D. | last2=Stevens | first2=Martin | title=The evolutionary ecology of decorating behaviour | url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/11/6/20150325 | journal=Biology Letters | date=1 June 2015 | issn=1744-9561 | pages=20150325 | volume=11 | issue=6 | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2015.0325}}</ref>

====Cryptic behaviour====
[[File:Leafy Seadragon Phycodurus eques 2500px PLW edit.jpg|thumb|The [[leafy sea dragon]] sways like seaweeds to reinforce its camouflage.]]
Movement catches the eye of prey animals on the lookout for predators, and of predators hunting for prey.<ref name=Cott141>Cott, 1940. p. 141.</ref> Most methods of crypsis therefore also require suitable cryptic behaviour, such as lying down and keeping still to avoid being detected, or in the case of stalking predators such as the [[tiger]], moving with extreme stealth, both slowly and quietly, watching its prey for any sign they are aware of its presence.<ref name=Cott141/> As an example of the combination of behaviours and other methods of crypsis involved, young giraffes seek cover, lie down, and keep still, often for hours until their mothers return; their skin pattern blends with the pattern of the vegetation, while the chosen cover and lying position together hide the animals' shadows.<ref name=Mitchell2003/> The [[flat-tail horned lizard]] similarly relies on a combination of methods: it is adapted to lie flat in the open desert, relying on stillness, its cryptic coloration, and concealment of its shadow to avoid being noticed by predators.<ref name="HLCS">{{cite web | url=http://www.hornedlizards.org/hornedlizards/hornedlizards_frame.html | publisher=Horned Lizard Conservation Society | work=hornedlizards.org | title=What is a Horned Lizard? | accessdate=21 December 2011}}</ref> In the ocean, the [[leafy sea dragon]] sways mimetically, like the seaweeds amongst which it rests, as if rippled by wind or water currents.<ref name="WWF">{{cite web | url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/teacher_resources/best_place_species/current_top_10/leafy_sea_dragon.cfm | title=Leafy Sea Dragon | publisher=WWF | accessdate=21 December 2011}}</ref>

====Motion camouflage====
{{main|Motion camouflage}}
[[File:Motion Camouflage Principle.jpg|thumb|Comparison of motion camouflage and classical pursuit]]

Most forms of camouflage are ineffective when the camouflaged animal or object moves, because the motion is easily seen by the observing predator, prey or enemy.<ref>Cott, 1940. pp. 141–143.</ref> However, insects such as [[Hoverfly|hoverflies]]<ref name="Srinivasan and Davey">{{cite journal | title=Strategies for active camouflage of motion | author=Srinivasan, MV; Davey, M | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B | year=1995 | volume=259 | pages=19–25 | issue=1354 | doi=10.1098/rspb.1995.0004}}</ref> and [[Dragonfly|dragonflies]] use [[motion camouflage]]: the hoverflies to approach possible mates, and the dragonflies to approach rivals when defending territories.<ref name="NatureNews">{{cite web | url=http://www.nature.com/news/2003/030605/full/news030602-10.html | work=Nature.com | title=Dragonfly flight tricks the eye | date=5 June 2003 | accessdate=16 January 2012 | author=Hopkin, Michael}}</ref><ref name="Mizutani">{{cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v423/n6940/full/423604a.html | title=Insect behaviour: Motion camouflage in dragonflies | author=Mizutani, AK; Chahl, JS; Srinivasan, MV | journal=Nature | date=5 June 2003 | volume=65 | issue=423 | page=604 | doi=10.1038/423604a}}</ref> Motion camouflage is achieved by moving so as to stay on a straight line between the target and a fixed point in the landscape; the pursuer thus appears not to move, but only to [[Looming|loom larger]] in the target's field of vision.<ref name="Glendinning">{{cite journal |pmid=15129957| pmc=1691618 | year=2004 | last1=Glendinning | first1=P | title=The mathematics of motion camouflage | volume=271 | issue=1538 | pages=477–481 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2003.2622 | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B}}</ref> The same technique can be used for military purposes, for example by missiles to minimise their risk of detection by the enemy.<ref name="Srinivasan and Davey"/> However, missile engineers, and animals such as bats, use the technique primarily for its efficiency rather than camouflage.<ref name=Ghose>{{cite journal | author=Ghose, K; Horiuchi, TK; Krishnaprasad, PS; Moss, CF | title=Echolocating Bats Use a Nearly Time-Optimal Strategy to Intercept Prey | journal=PLoS Biology | volume=4 | issue= 5 | page=e108 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040108| year=2006 | pmid=16605303 | pmc=1436025}}</ref>

[[File:Melanophores with dispersed or aggregated melanosomes.jpg|thumb|Fish and frog melanophore cells change colour by moving pigment-containing bodies.]]

====Changeable skin pattern / colour====
{{further|Animal coloration|:Category:Animals that can change color}}

Animals such as [[chameleon]], frog,<ref>Cott, 1940. pp. 30–31.</ref> flatfish such as the [[peacock flounder]], squid and [[octopus]] actively change their skin patterns and colours using special [[chromatophore]] cells to resemble their current background (as well as for [[Signalling theory|signalling]]).<ref>Forbes, 2009. pp. 52, 236.</ref>

[[File:Peacock Flounder Bothus mancus in Kona.jpg|thumb|left|Four frames of the same [[peacock flounder]] taken a few minutes apart, showing its ability to match its coloration to the environment]] 
Each chromatophore contains pigment of only one colour. In fish and frogs, colour change is mediated by the type of chromatophores known as [[melanophore]]s that contain dark pigment. A melanophore is star-shaped; it contains many small pigmented [[organelle]]s which can be dispersed throughout the cell, or aggregated near its centre. When the pigmented organelles are dispersed, the cell makes a patch of the animal's skin appear dark; when they are aggregated, most of the cell, and the animal's skin, appears light. In frogs, the change is controlled relatively slowly, mainly by hormones. In fish, the change is controlled by the brain, which sends signals directly to the chromatophores, as well as producing hormones.<ref name="Wallin">{{cite journal | url=http://www.bioscience-explained.org/ENvol1_2/pdf/paletteEN.pdf | title=Nature's Palette | work=Bioscience Explained | year=2002 | accessdate=17 November 2011 | author=Wallin, M | volume=1 | issue=2 | pages= 1–12}}</ref>

On a longer timescale, animals like the [[Arctic hare]], [[Arctic fox]], [[stoat]], and [[rock ptarmigan]] change their coat colour (by moulting and growing new fur or feathers) from brown or grey in the summer to white in the winter; the Arctic fox is the only species in the [[Canidae|dog family]] to do so.<ref name="Churchill">{{cite web | url=http://churchillpolarbears.org/churchill/arctic-wildlife | title=Arctic Wildlife | publisher=Churchill Polar Bears | year=2011 | accessdate=22 December 2011}}</ref> However, Arctic hares which live in the far north of [[Canada]], where summer is very short, remain white year-round.<ref name="Churchill"/><ref name="ParksCanada">{{cite book | title=The Status of Arctic Hare (Lepus arcticus bangsii) in Insular Newfoundland | url=http://www.env.gov.nl.ca/env/wildlife/endangeredspecies/ssac/arctic_hare.pdf | publisher=Newfoundland Labrador Department of Environment and Conservation | author=Hearn, Brian | date=20 February 2012 | accessdate=3 February 2013 | page=7}}</ref>

The principle of varying coloration either rapidly or with the changing seasons has military applications. ''[[Active camouflage]]'' could in theory make use of both dynamic colour change and counterillumination. Simple techniques such as changing uniforms and repainting vehicles for winter have been in use since the Second World War. In 2011, [[BAE Systems]] announced their [[Adaptiv]] infrared camouflage technology. It uses about 1000 hexagonal panels to cover the sides of a tank. The panels are heated and cooled to match either the vehicle's surroundings (crypsis), or an object such as a car (mimesis), when viewed in infrared.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-14788009 | work=BBC News| title=Tanks test infrared invisibility cloak | date=5 September 2011 | accessdate=13 June 2012}}</ref><ref name=Adaptiv-Cloak>{{cite web | url=http://www.baesystems.com/magazine/BAES_019786/adaptiv--a-cloak-of-invisibility | title=Adaptiv – A Cloak of Invisibility | publisher=BAE Systems | year=2011 | accessdate=13 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.baesystems.com/image/BAES_019603/innovation-adaptiv-car-signature | title=Innovation Adaptiv Car Signature | publisher=BAE Systems | year=2012 | accessdate=13 June 2012}}</ref>

====Countershading====
{{main|Countershading}}
[[File:Countershading.jpg|thumb|Countershading acts as a form of camouflage by 'painting out' the self-shadowing of the body or object. The result is a 'flat' appearance, instead of the 'solid' appearance of the body before countershading.]]

Countershading uses graded colour to counteract the effect of self-shadowing, creating an illusion of flatness. Self-shadowing makes an animal appear darker below than on top, grading from light to dark; countershading 'paints in' tones which are darkest on top, lightest below, making the countershaded animal nearly invisible against a suitable background.<ref name=cottCh3>Cott, 1940. pp. 35–46.</ref> Thayer observed that "Animals are painted by Nature, darkest on those parts which tend to be most lighted by the sky's light, and ''vice versa''". Accordingly, the principle of countershading is sometimes called ''Thayer's Law''.<ref name=forbesthayer>Forbes, 2009. pp. 72–73.</ref> Countershading is widely used by [[terrestrial animals]], such as [[gazelle]]s<ref name=Kiltie>{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0169534788900791 | title=Countershading: Universally deceptive or deceptively universal? | author=Kiltie, Richard A. | journal=Trends in Ecology & Evolution | date=January 1998 | volume=3 | issue=1 | pages=21–23 | doi=10.1016/0169-5347(88)90079-1}}</ref> and grasshoppers; marine animals, such as [[sharks]] and [[Delphinus delphis|dolphin]]s;<ref>Cott, 1940. p. 41</ref> and birds, such as [[common snipe|snipe]] and [[dunlin]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/stanfordbirds/text/essays/Color_of_Birds.html | title=The Color of Birds | publisher=Stanford University | year=1988 | accessdate=1 February 2013 | author=Ehrlich, Paul R; Dobkin, David S; Wheye, Darryl}}</ref><ref name=cott40>Cott, 1940. p. 40.</ref>

Countershading is less often used for military camouflage, despite Second World War experiments that showed its effectiveness. English [[zoologist]] [[Hugh Cott]] encouraged the use of techniques including countershading, but despite his authority on the subject, failed to persuade the British authorities.<ref>Forbes, 2009. pp. 146–150.</ref> Soldiers often wrongly viewed camouflage netting as a kind of invisibility cloak, and they had to be taught to look at camouflage practically, from the enemy observer's point of view.<ref>Forbes, 2009. p. 152.</ref><ref>Barkas, 1952. p. 36.</ref> At the same time in [[Australia]], zoologist [[William John Dakin]] advised soldiers to copy animals' methods, using their instincts for wartime camouflage.<ref>Elias, 2011. pp. 57–66.</ref>

The term countershading has a second meaning unrelated to "Thayer's Law". It is that the upper and undersides of animals such as sharks, and of some military aircraft, are different colours to match the different backgrounds when seen from above or from below. Here the camouflage consists of two surfaces, each with the simple function of providing concealment against a specific background, such as a bright water surface or the sky. The body of a shark or the fuselage of an aircraft is not gradated from light to dark to appear flat when seen from the side. The camouflage techniques used are the matching of background colour and pattern, and disruption of outlines.<ref name=Kiltie/>

====Counterillumination====
{{main|Counter-illumination}}

Counterillumination means producing light to match a background that is brighter than an animal's body or military vehicle; it is a form of active camouflage. It is notably used by some species of [[squid]], such as the [[Watasenia scintillans|firefly or sparkling enope squid]] and the [[Abralia veranyi|midwater squid]]. The latter has light-producing organs ([[photophores]]) scattered all over its underside; these create a sparkling glow that prevents the animal from appearing as a dark shape when seen from below.<ref name="Abralia with photo">{{cite web | url=http://ocean.si.edu/ocean-photos/midwater-squid-abralia-veranyi | title=Midwater Squid, Abralia veranyi | publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History | accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref> Counterillumination camouflage is the likely function of the [[bioluminescence]] of many marine organisms, though light is also produced to attract<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/umrsmas/bullmar/1983/00000033/00000004/art00003 | title=Oceanic Bioluminescence: an Overview of General Functions | author=Young, Richard Edward | journal=Bulletin of Marine Science | date=October 1983 | volume=33 | issue=4 | pages=829–845}}</ref> or to detect prey<ref>{{cite journal | title=Long-wave sensitivity in deep-sea stomiid dragonfish with far-red bioluminescence: evidence for a dietary origin of the chlorophyll-derived retinal photosensitizer of Malacosteus niger | author=Douglas, RH; Mullineaux, CW; Partridge, JC | journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B | date=September 2000 | volume=355 | issue=1401 | pages=1269–1272 | pmc=1692851 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2000.0681 | pmid=11079412}}</ref> and for signalling.

Counterillumination has rarely been used for military purposes. "[[Diffused lighting camouflage]]" was trialled by Canada's [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] during the Second World War. It involved projecting light on to the sides of ships to match the faint glow of the night sky, requiring awkward external platforms to support the lamps.<ref name="NavalMuseumQuebec">{{cite web | url=http://www.navy.forces.gc.ca/navres/NMQ_MNQ/researches_recherches/diffusedLighting_camouflageLumineux/index-eng.asp | work=Naval Museum of Quebec | publisher=Royal Canadian Navy | title=Diffused Lighting and its use in the Chaleur Bay | accessdate=3 February 2013}}</ref> The Canadian concept was refined in the American [[Yehudi lights]] project, and trialled in aircraft including [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24 Liberators]] and naval [[Grumman TBF Avenger|Avengers]].<ref name="Hambling">{{cite news | last=Hambling | first=David | title=Cloak of Light Makes Drone Invisible? | url=http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2008/05/invisible-drone | publisher=Wired | accessdate=17 June 2012 | date=9 May 2008}}</ref> The planes were fitted with forward-pointing lamps automatically adjusted to match the brightness of the night sky.<ref name="NavalMuseumQuebec"/> This enabled them to approach much closer to a target – within 3,000&nbsp;yards (2,700&nbsp;metres) – before being seen.<ref name="Hambling"/> Counterillumination was made obsolete by [[radar]], and neither diffused lighting camouflage nor Yehudi lights entered active service.<ref name="NavalMuseumQuebec"/>

====Transparency====
[[File:Expl0469 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Many animals of the open sea, like this ''[[Aurelia labiata]]'' jellyfish, are largely transparent.]]

Many [[Sea|marine]] animals that float near the surface are highly [[Transparency and translucency|transparent]], giving them almost perfect camouflage.<ref name=HerringTransparency>Herring, 2002. pp. 190–191.</ref> However, transparency is difficult for bodies made of materials that have different [[refractive index|refractive indices]] from seawater. Some marine animals such as [[jellyfish]] have gelatinous bodies, composed mainly of water; their thick [[Mesoglea|mesogloea]] is acellular and highly transparent. This conveniently makes them [[buoyancy|buoyant]], but it also makes them large for their muscle mass, so they cannot swim fast, making this form of camouflage a costly trade-off with mobility.<ref name=HerringTransparency/> Gelatinous [[plankton]]ic animals are between 50 and 90 percent transparent. A transparency of 50 percent is enough to make an animal invisible to a predator such as [[cod]] at a depth of {{convert|650|m|ft}}; better transparency is required for invisibility in shallower water, where the light is brighter and predators can see better. For example, a cod can see prey that are 98 percent transparent in optimal lighting in shallow water. Therefore, sufficient transparency for camouflage is more easily achieved in deeper waters.<ref name=HerringTransparency/>

[[File:Hyalinobatrachium uranoscopum01a.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Glass frogs]] like ''[[Hyalinobatrachium uranoscopum]]'' use partial transparency for camouflage in the dim light of the rainforest.]]
Some tissues such as [[muscle]]s can be made transparent, provided either they are very thin or organised as regular layers or fibrils that are small compared to the wavelength of visible light. A familiar example is the transparency of the lens of the vertebrate [[eye]], which is made of the protein [[crystallin]], and the vertebrate [[cornea]] which is made of the protein [[collagen]].<ref name=HerringTransparency/> Other structures cannot be made transparent, notably the [[retina]]s or equivalent light-absorbing structures of eyes — they must absorb light to be able to function. The [[camera]]-type eye of vertebrates and cephalopods must be completely opaque.<ref name=HerringTransparency/> Finally, some structures are visible for a reason, such as to lure prey. For example, the [[nematocyst]]s (stinging cells) of the transparent [[siphonophore]] ''[[Agalma okenii]]'' resemble small [[copepod]]s.<ref name=HerringTransparency/> Examples of transparent marine animals include a wide variety of [[larva]]e, including [[coelenterates]], siphonophores, [[salps]] (floating [[tunicates]]), [[gastropoda|gastropod molluscs]], [[polychaete]] worms, many shrimplike [[crustaceans]], and fish; whereas the adults of most of these are opaque and pigmented, resembling the seabed or shores where they live.<ref name=HerringTransparency/><ref name=Cott6/> Adult [[comb jelly|comb jellies]] and jellyfish obey the rule, often being mainly transparent. Cott suggests this follows the more general rule that animals resemble their background: in a transparent medium like seawater, that means actually being transparent.<ref name=Cott6>Cott, 1940. p. 6.</ref> The small [[Amazon river]] fish ''[[Microphilypnus amazonicus]]'' and the shrimps it associates with, ''[[Pseudopalaemon gouldingi]]'', are so transparent as to be "almost invisible"; further, these species appear to select whether to be transparent or more conventionally mottled (disruptively patterned) according to the local background in the environment.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1679-62252006000200008&script=sci_arttext | title=The almost invisible league: crypsis and association between minute fishes and shrimps as a possible defence against visually hunting predators | author=Carvalho, Lucélia Nobre; Zuanon, Jansen; Sazima, Ivan | journal=Neotropical Ichthyology | date=April–June 2006 | volume=4 | issue=2 | pages=219–224 | doi=10.1590/S1679-62252006000200008}}</ref>

====Silvering====
[[File:Herringadultkils2.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|The adult herring, ''[[Clupea harengus]]'', is a typical silvered fish of medium depths, camouflaged by reflection.]]
[[File:Herring Silvering.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|The herring's reflectors are nearly vertical for camouflage from the side.]]

Where transparency cannot be achieved, it can be imitated effectively by silvering to make an animal's body highly reflective. At medium depths at sea, light comes from above, so a mirror oriented vertically makes animals such as fish invisible from the side. Most fish in the upper ocean such as [[sardine]] and [[herring]] are camouflaged by silvering.<ref name=HerringSilvering>Herring, 2002. pp. 192–195.</ref>

The [[marine hatchetfish]] is extremely flattened laterally, leaving the body just millimetres thick, and the body is so silvery as to resemble [[aluminium foil]]. The mirrors consist of microscopic structures similar to those used to provide [[structural coloration]]: stacks of between 5 and 10 crystals of [[guanine]] spaced about ¼ of a wavelength apart to interfere constructively and achieve nearly 100 per cent reflection. In the deep waters that the hatchetfish lives in, only blue light with a wavelength of 500 nanometres percolates down and needs to be reflected, so mirrors 125 nanometres apart provide good camouflage.<ref name=HerringSilvering/>

In fish such as the herring which live in shallower water, the mirrors must reflect a mixture of wavelengths, and the fish accordingly has crystal stacks with a range of different spacings. A further complication for fish with bodies that are rounded in cross-section is that the mirrors would be ineffective if laid flat on the skin, as they would fail to reflect horizontally. The overall mirror effect is achieved with many small reflectors, all oriented vertically.<ref name=HerringSilvering/> Silvering is found in other marine animals as well as fish. The [[cephalopods]], including squid, octopus and cuttlefish, have multi-layer mirrors made of protein rather than guanine.<ref name=HerringSilvering/>

=== Mimesis===
{{further2|[[Mimicry]]|[[Cryptic aggressive mimicry]]}}

In [[Mimesis (biology)|mimesis]] (also called ''masquerade''), the camouflaged object looks like something else which is of no special interest to the observer.<ref name="Gullan">{{cite book | author=Gullan, PJ; Cranston, PS | title=The Insects | publisher=John Wiley, Blackwell | year=2010 | edition=4th | pages=512–513 | isbn=978-1-4443-3036-6 | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=S7yGZasJ7nEC&pg=PA512#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> Mimesis is common in [[prey]] animals, for example when a [[peppered moth]] caterpillar mimics a twig, or a grasshopper mimics a dry leaf.<ref name=Forbes151>Forbes, 2009. p. 151.</ref> It is also found in nest structures; some eusocial wasps, such as ''[[Leipomeles dorsata]]'', build a nest envelope in patterns that mimic the leaves surrounding the nest.<ref>{{Cite book | title=The Social Biology of Wasps | last=Ross | first=Kenneth G. | publisher=Cornell Press | year=1991 | isbn=978-0-801-49906-7 | pages=233}}</ref>

Mimesis is also employed by some [[predation|predators]] and [[parasite]]s to lure their prey. For example, a [[flower mantis]] mimics a particular kind of flower, such as an [[orchid]].<ref>Forbes, 2009. p. 134.</ref> This tactic has occasionally been used in warfare, for example with heavily armed [[Q-ship]]s disguised as merchant ships.<ref name="Beyer">{{cite book | author=Beyer, Kenneth M | year=1999 | title=Q-Ships versus U-Boats: America's Secret Project | publisher=Naval Institute Press | isbn=1-55750-044-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=McMullen | first=Chris | url=http://www.gwpda.org/naval/rnqships.htm | title=Royal Navy 'Q' Ships | work=Great War Primary Documents Archive | accessdate=6 March 2012 | year=2001}}</ref><ref>Forbes, 2009. pp. 6–42.</ref>

The [[common cuckoo]], a [[brood parasite]], provides examples of mimesis both in the adult and in the egg. The female lays her eggs in nests of other, smaller species of bird, one per nest. The female mimics a [[Eurasian sparrowhawk|sparrowhawk]]. The resemblance is sufficient to make small birds take action to avoid the apparent predator. The female cuckoo then has time to lay her egg in their nest without being seen to do so.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1093/beheco/arr008 | last=Welbergen | first=J |author2=Davies, NB | year=2011 | title=A parasite in wolf's clothing: hawk mimicry reduces mobbing of cuckoos by hosts | journal=Behavioral Ecology | volume=22 | issue=3 | pages=574–579}}</ref> The cuckoo's egg itself mimics the eggs of the host species, reducing its chance of being rejected.<ref>{{cite news | title=Cuckoo in egg pattern 'arms race' | first=Emma | last=Brennand | work=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_9418000/9418131.stm | accessdate=22 August 2011 | date=24 March 2011}}</ref><ref name="ibis2002">{{cite journal | last=Moskát | first=C | author2=Honza, M | year=2002 | title=European Cuckoo Cuculus canorus parasitism and host's rejection behaviour in a heavily parasitized Great Reed Warbler Acrocephalus arundinaceus population | journal= Ibis | doi=10.1046/j.1474-919X.2002.00085.x | volume= 144 | issue=4 | pages=614–622}}</ref>

=== Motion dazzle===
[[File:Chapman-Zebra.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|The [[zebra]]'s bold pattern may induce motion dazzle in observers]]

Most forms of camouflage are made ineffective by movement: a deer or grasshopper may be highly cryptic when motionless, but instantly seen when it moves. But one method, motion dazzle, requires rapidly moving bold patterns of contrasting stripes.<ref name=Scott-Samuel/> Motion dazzle may degrade predators' ability to estimate the prey's speed and direction accurately, giving the prey an improved chance of escape.<ref name=StevensMotionDazzle>{{cite web | url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/9/81/abstract | work=BMC Biology | pages=9–81 | doi=10.1186/1741-7007-9-81 | title=Motion dazzle and camouflage as distinct anti-predator defenses | date=25 November 2011 | author=Stevens, M; Searle, WTL; Seymour, JE; Marshall, KLA; Ruxton, GD}}</ref> Motion dazzle distorts speed perception and is most effective at high speeds; stripes can also distort perception of size (and so, perceived range to the target).

Camouflage is occasionally used to make buildings less conspicuous: for example, in [[South Africa]], towers carrying cell telephone antennae are sometimes camouflaged as tall trees with plastic branches, in response to "resistance from the community". Since this method is costly (a figure of three times the normal cost is mentioned), alternative forms of camouflage can include using neutral colours or familiar shapes such as cylinders and flagpoles. Conspicuousness can also be reduced by siting masts near or actually on other structures.<ref>{{cite book | last=du Plessis | first=A | title=Telecommunication Mast Management Guidelines For The City of Tshwane | publisher=[[City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality]] | date=3 July 2002 | url=http://www.tshwane.gov.za/AboutTshwane/CityManagement/CityDepartments/CorporateandSharedServices/legalservices/_layouts/mobile/view.aspx?List=1c67d863-b080-497c-b5e6-5f737c9debda&View=01d8646a-31ab-4506-a31d-76c75e245307&RootFolder=%2FAboutTshwane%2FCityManagement%2FCityDepartments%2FCorporateandSharedServices%2Flegalservices%2FPolicies%20Listing%2FTelkom%20Mast&ViewMode=Detail}}</ref>

Hunters of game have long made use of camouflage in the form of materials such as animal skins, mud, foliage, and green or brown clothing to enable them to approach wary game animals.<ref>Newark, 2007. p. 38.</ref> [[Field sports]] such as [[driven grouse shooting]] conceal hunters in [[hunting blind|hides]] (also called blinds or shooting butts).<ref>{{cite book | author=Blakeley, Peter F | title=Wingshooting | publisher=Stackpole Books | year=2012 | pages=116, 125 | isbn=978-0-8117-0566-0}}</ref> Modern hunting clothing makes use of fabrics that provide a disruptive camouflage pattern; for example, in 1986 the hunter Bill Jordan created cryptic clothing for hunters, printed with images of specific kinds of vegetation such as grass and branches.<ref>Newark, 2007. pp. 48, 50.</ref>

Automotive manufacturers often use patterns to disguise upcoming products. This camouflage is designed to obfuscate the vehicle's visual lines, and is used along with padding, covers, and decals. The patterns' purpose is to prevent visual observation (and to a lesser degree photography), that would subsequently enable reproduction of the vehicle's form factors.<ref>{{cite web |title=The secrets behind all that camouflage |url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20150512/BLOG06/150519967/the-secrets-behind-all-that-camouflage |publisher=Automotive News |accessdate=28 July 2015 |date=12 May 2015}}</ref>

==Fashion, art and society==

Military camouflage patterns influenced [[Fashion design|fashion]] and [[art]] from the time of the First World War onwards. [[Gertrude Stein]] recalled the [[cubism|cubist]] artist [[Pablo Picasso]]'s reaction in around 1915:

{{quote|I very well remember at the beginning of the war being with Picasso on the boulevard Raspail when the first camouflaged truck passed. It was at night, we had heard of camouflage but we had not seen it and Picasso amazed looked at it and then cried out, yes it is we who made it, that is cubism.|Gertrude Stein in ''From Picasso'' (1938)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://faculty.dwc.edu/wellman/Stein-Picasso.html | author=Stein, Gertrude; Toklas, Alice B. (trans.) | title=Picasso | publisher=Scribners | year=1939}}</ref>}}

In 1919, the attendants of a "dazzle ball", hosted by the Chelsea Arts Club, wore dazzle-patterned black and white clothing. The ball influenced fashion and art via postcards and magazine articles.<ref name=Forbes100>Forbes, 2009. p. 100.</ref> The ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' announced:<ref name=Forbes100 /><ref>{{cite news | work=Illustrated London News | title=The Great Dazzle Ball at the Albert Hall: The Shower of Bomb Balloons and Some Typical Costumes | date=22 March 1919 | location=No. 154 | pages=414–415}}</ref>
{{quote|The scheme of decoration for the great fancy dress ball given by the Chelsea Arts Club at the Albert Hall, the other day, was based on the principles of "Dazzle", the method of "camouflage" used during the war in the painting of ships&nbsp;... The total effect was brilliant and fantastic.}}

More recently, fashion designers have often used camouflage fabric for its striking designs, its "patterned disorder" and its symbolism.<ref name="Galliano at Museum">{{cite web | url=http://www3.fitnyc.edu/museum/loveandwar/galliano.htm | title=Love and War: The Weaponized Woman | publisher=The Museum at FIT | work=John Galliano for Christian Dior, silk camouflage evening dress | date=9 September – 16 December 2006 | accessdate=1 December 2011}}</ref> Camouflage clothing can be worn largely for its symbolic significance rather than for fashion, as when, during the late 1960s and early 1970s in the United States, [[opposition to the Vietnam War|anti-war protestors]] often ironically wore military clothing during demonstrations against the American involvement in the Vietnam War.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.civilisations.ca/cwm/exhibitions/exp/camo/camo02e.shtml | title=Camouflage: The Exhibition | publisher=Canadian War Museum | date=5 June 2009 | accessdate=3 February 2013}}</ref>

Modern artists such as [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]] have used camouflage to reflect on war. His 1973 screenprint of a tank camouflaged in a leaf pattern, ''Arcadia'', is described by the [[Tate gallery|Tate]] as drawing "an ironic parallel between this idea of a natural paradise and the camouflage patterns on a tank".<ref name="IanHF-Tate">{{cite web | url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/hamilton-finlay-arcadia-collaboration-with-george-oliver-p07025 | title=Ian Hamilton Finlay: Arcadia (collaboration with George Oliver) | publisher=Tate | work=Arcadia, 1973 | date=July 2008 | accessdate=11 May 2012}}</ref> The title refers to the [[Utopia]]n [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]] of poetry and art, and the ''[[memento mori]]'' [[Latin phrase]] ''[[Et in Arcadia ego]]'' which recurs in Hamilton Finlay's work. In [[science fiction]], ''[[Camouflage (novel)|Camouflage]]'' is a novel about [[shapeshifting]] alien beings by [[Joe Haldeman]].<ref>{{cite book | author=Haldeman, Joe | title=Camouflage | publisher=Ace Books | year=2004 | isbn=0-441-01161-6}}</ref> The word is used more figuratively in works of literature such as Thaisa Frank's collection of stories of love and loss, ''A Brief History of Camouflage''.<ref>{{cite book | author=Frank, Thaisa | title=A Brief History of Camouflage | publisher=Black Sparrow Press | year=1992 | isbn=0-87685-857-4}}</ref>{{clear}}
