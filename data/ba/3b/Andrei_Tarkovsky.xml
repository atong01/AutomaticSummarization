From the beginning the film was not well received by Soviet authorities due to its content and its perceived elitist nature. Russian authorities placed the film in the &quot;third category,&quot; a severely limited distribution, and only allowed it to be shown in third-class cinemas and workers' clubs. Few prints were made and the film-makers received no returns. Third category films also placed the film-makers in danger of being accused of wasting public funds, which could have serious effects on their future productivity.<extension extension_name='ref'>Marshall, Herbert.<space/><italics>Sight and Sound</italics>.

Tarkovsky had met the brothers first in 1971 and was in contact with them until his death in 1986. Initially he wanted to shoot a film based on their novel<space/><italics><link><target>Dead Mountaineer's Hotel</target></link></italics><space/>and he developed a raw script. Influenced by a discussion with Arkady Strugatsky he changed his plan and began to work on the script based on<space/><italics>Roadside Picnic</italics>. Work on this film began in 1976.

Unedited movie footage transcribes time in<space/><link><target>Real-time (media)</target><part>real time</part></link>.

In 1966, in an interview conducted shortly after finishing<space/><italics>Andrei Rublev</italics>, Tarkovsky dismissed color film as a &quot;commercial gimmick&quot; and cast doubt on the idea that contemporary films meaningfully use color. He claimed that in everyday life one does not consciously notice colors most of the time, and that color should therefore be used in film mainly to emphasize certain moments, but not all the time, as this distracts the viewer.
