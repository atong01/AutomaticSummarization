Although an enthusiastic amateur musician and patron of the<space/><link><target>ballet</target></link>, Alexander was seen as lacking refinement and elegance. Indeed, he rather relished the idea of being of the same rough texture as some of his subjects. His straightforward, abrupt manner savoured sometimes of gruffness, while his direct, unadorned method of expressing himself harmonized well with his rough-hewn, immobile features and somewhat sluggish movements. His education was not such as to soften these peculiarities. More than six feet tall (about 1.9&amp;nbsp;m), he was also noted for his immense physical strength. A<space/><link><target>sebaceous cyst</target></link><space/>on the left side of his nose caused him to be mocked by some of his contemporaries, and he sat for photographs and portraits with the right side of his face most prominent.</paragraph><paragraph>An account from the memoirs of the artist<space/><link><target>Alexander Benois</target></link><space/>gives one impression of Alexander III:</paragraph><paragraph><extension extension_name='blockquote'>After a performance of the ballet '<link><target>Tsar Kandavl</target></link>' at the<space/><link><target>Mariinsky Theatre</target></link>, I first caught sight of the Emperor. I was struck by the size of the man, and although cumbersome and heavy, he was still a mighty figure. There was indeed something of the<space/><link><target>muzhik</target></link><space/><italics>[Russian peasant]</italics><space/>about him. The look of his bright eyes made quite an impression on me. As he passed where I was standing, he raised his head for a second, and to this day I can remember what I felt as our eyes met. It was a look as cold as steel, in which there was something threatening, even frightening, and it struck me like a blow. The Tsar's gaze! The look of a man who stood above all others, but who carried a monstrous burden and who every minute had to fear for his life and the lives of those closest to him. In later years I came into contact with the Emperor on several occasions, and I felt not the slightest bit timid. In more ordinary cases Tsar Alexander III could be at once kind, simple, and even almost homely.</extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Education</heading><paragraph>Though he was destined to be a strongly counter-reforming emperor, Alexander had little prospect of succeeding to the throne during the first two decades of his life, as he had an elder brother,<space/><link><target>Grand Duke Nicholas Alexandrovich of Russia</target><part>Nicolas</part></link>, who seemed of robust constitution. Even when this elder brother first displayed symptoms of delicate health, the notion that he might die young was never taken seriously, and he was betrothed to<space/><link><target>Dagmar of Denmark (Maria Feodorovna)</target><part>Princess Dagmar of Denmark</part></link>, daughter of<space/><link><target>King Christian IX of Denmark</target><part>King Christian IX</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Louise of Hesse-Kassel</target><part>Queen Louise</part></link><space/>of Denmark, and whose siblings included<space/><link><target>Alexandra of Denmark</target><part>Alexandra, Princess of Wales</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>King George I of Greece</target></link>. Great solicitude was devoted to the education of Nicolas as<space/><link><target>tsesarevich</target></link>, whereas Alexander received only the training of an ordinary Grand Duke of that period. This included acquaintance with<space/><link><target>French language</target><part>French</part></link>,<space/><link><target>English language</target><part>English</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>German language</target><part>German</part></link>, and<space/><link><target>military drill</target></link>.</paragraph><heading level='3'>As Tsesarevich</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Alexander III and Maria Fedorovna's coronation by G.Becker (1888, Hermitage).jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>300px</part><part>Portrait by the artist Georges Becker of the coronation of Tsar Alexander III and<space/><link><target>Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)</target><part>Empress Maria Fyodorovna</part></link>, which took place on<space/><template><target>OldStyleDate</target><arg>27 May</arg><arg>1883</arg><arg>15 May</arg></template><space/>at the<space/><link><target>Cathedral of the Dormition</target><part>Uspensky Sobor</part></link><space/>of the<space/><link><target>Moscow Kremlin</target></link>.

It was then that he began to study the principles of law and administration under<space/><link><target>Konstantin Pobedonostsev</target></link>, then a professor of<space/><link><target>Civil law (legal system)</target><part>civil law</part></link><space/>at<space/><link><target>Moscow State University</target></link><space/>and later (from 1880)<space/><link><target>chief procurator</target></link><space/>of the<space/><link><target>Holy Synod</target></link><space/>of the Orthodox Church in Russia. Pobedonostsev awakened in his pupil little love of abstract study or prolonged intellectual exertion, but instilled into the young man's mind the belief that zeal for<space/><link><target>Russian Orthodox Church</target><part>Russian Orthodox</part></link><space/>thought was an essential factor of Russian<space/><link><target>patriotism</target></link><space/>to be cultivated by every right-minded emperor. While he was heir-apparent1865 to 1881Alexander did not play a prominent part in public affairs, but allowed it to become known that he had ideas which did not coincide with the principles of the existing government.</paragraph><paragraph>On his deathbed Alexander's elder brother Nicolas is said to have expressed the wish that his fiance, Princess Dagmar of Denmark, should marry his successor.

Alexander's political ideal was a nation composed of a single nationality, language, and religion, as well as one form of administration.

Before then, she had been the fiance of his elder brother Nicholas, who had died in 1865. But Alexander refused to travel to Copenhagen, declaring that he did not love Dagmar and wanted to marry Maria. The emperor flew into a rage and ordered Alexander to go straight to Denmark and to propose to Princess Dagmar. The Tsesarevich realised that he was not a free man and that duty had to come first. The only thing left to do was to write in his diary &quot;Farewell, dear Dusenka.&quot; Maria was forced to leave Russia, accompanied by her aunt, Princess Chernyshova.
