'''Dennis Lee Hopper''' (May 17, 1936 – May 29, 2010) was an [[United States|American]] actor, filmmaker, photographer, and artist. He attended the [[Actors Studio]], making his first television appearance in 1954, and soon after appeared in two films with [[James Dean]]. In the next ten years he made a name in television, and by the end of the 1960s had appeared in several films. Hopper also began a prolific and acclaimed photography career in the 1960s.<ref name="Dennis Hopper">{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/film-obituaries/7786470/Dennis-Hopper.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Dennis Hopper | date=May 30, 2010}}</ref>

In 1969 Hopper directed and starred in ''[[Easy Rider]]'', winning an award at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay)|Best Original Screenplay]] as co-writer. Journalist Ann Hornaday wrote: "With its portrait of [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] heroes raising their middle fingers to the uptight middle-class hypocrisies, Easy Rider became the cinematic symbol of the 1960s, a celluloid anthem to freedom, macho bravado and anti-establishment rebellion."<ref>Hornaday, Ann (May 29, 2010).

Hopper was unable to build on his success for several years, until the fame brought by his role as the [[American Photojournalist]] in ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979). He then appeared in ''[[Rumble Fish]]'' (1983) and ''[[The Osterman Weekend (film)|The Osterman Weekend]]'' (1983), and received critical recognition for his acting in ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' and ''[[Hoosiers]]'', with the latter film garnering him an Academy Award nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]. In 1988 he directed ''[[Colors (film)|Colors]]'', and in the following years played the eponymous lead character in ''[[Paris Trout]]''.  He played numerous villains including: ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'' (1994),  [[King Koopa]] in ''[[Super Mario Bros. (film)|Super Mario Bros.]]'' (1993) and in ''[[Waterworld]]'' (1995). Hopper also played heroes, such as John Canyon in ''[[Space Truckers]]''.

Hopper's later work included a leading role in the television series ''[[Crash (2008 TV series)|Crash]]''. His last performance was filmed just before his death: ''[[The Last Film Festival]]'', originally slated for a 2011 release.<ref name="Dennis Hopper"/>

After [[World War II]], the family moved to [[Kansas City, Missouri]], where the young Hopper attended Saturday art classes at the [[Kansas City Art Institute]]. At the age of 13, Hopper and his family moved to [[San Diego]], where his mother worked as a lifeguard instructor and his father was a post office manager (Hopper has acknowledged, though, that his father was in the [[Office of Strategic Services]], the precursor to the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], in China with{{clarify|date=May 2014}} [[Mao Zedong]]).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://tv.zap2it.com/tveditorial/tve_main/1,1002,271%7C98259%7C1%7C,00.html| author= O'Hare, Cate|title=Hopper Evolves From Rebel to Republican|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828103035/http://tv.zap2it.com/tveditorial/tve_main/1,1002,271%7C98259%7C1%7C,00.html| deadurl=yes |archivedate=2007-08-28| publisher=Tribune Media Services| work=Zap2It.com| date=October 26, 2005| accessdate=May 31, 2013}}</ref> Hopper was voted most likely to succeed at [[Helix High School]], where he was active in the drama club, speech and choir.<ref>{{cite news|title=Helix High's Hopper rebels without pause|date=February 4, 1990|newspaper=The San Diego Union-Tribune|page=E-1|first=Divina|last=Infusino}}</ref> It was there that he developed an interest in acting, studying at the [[Old Globe Theatre]] in San Diego,<!-- <ref>[http://www.filmcatcher.com/interview_detail/141/620/ ]{{Dead link|date=November 2009}}</ref> rm horrible blog cite --> and the [[Actors Studio]] in New York City (he studied with [[Lee Strasberg]] for five years). Hopper struck up a friendship with actor [[Vincent Price]], whose passion for art influenced Hopper's interest in art. He was especially fond of the plays of [[William Shakespeare]].

==Career==

===Film===
Hopper was reported to have an uncredited role in ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' in 1954 but he has stated that he was not even in [[Hollywood]] when this film was made.<ref name="AVCRR">Murray, Noel (December 2, 2008). [http://www.avclub.com/content/feature/random_roles_dennis_hopper Random Roles with Dennis Hopper]. ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', Onion Inc. Retrieved 2010-05-29.</ref> Hopper made his debut on film in two roles with [[James Dean]] (whom he admired immensely) in ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955) and ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' (1956). Dean's death in a 1955 car accident affected the young Hopper deeply and it was shortly afterwards that he got into a confrontation with veteran director [[Henry Hathaway]] on the film ''[[From Hell to Texas]]''. Hopper forced Hathaway to shoot more than 80 takes of a scene over several days before he acquiesced to Hathaway's direction. After filming was finally completed, Hathaway allegedly told Hopper that his career in Hollywood was finished.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wyatt|first=Edward|title=Dennis Hopper, 74, Hollywood Rebel, Dies|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/movies/30hopper.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 29, 2010}}</ref>

In his book ''Last Train to Memphis'', American popular music [[historian]] [[Peter Guralnick]] says that in 1956, when [[Elvis Presley]] was making his first film in Hollywood, Hopper was roommates with fellow actor [[Nick Adams (actor)|Nick Adams]] and the three became friends and socialized together. In 1959 Hopper moved to New York to study [[Method acting]] under [[Lee Strasberg]] at the [[Actors Studio]].<ref>Noever, Peter. ''Dennis Hopper: a System of Moments'', Hatje Cantz Publishers (2001) p. 258</ref> In 1961, Hopper played his first lead role in ''[[Night Tide]]'', an atmospheric supernatural thriller involving a mermaid in an amusement park.

In a December 1994 interview on the [[Charlie Rose Show]], Hopper credited [[John Wayne]] with saving his career, as Hopper acknowledged that because of his insolent behavior, he could not find work in Hollywood for seven years. Hopper stated that because he was the son-in-law of actress [[Margaret Sullavan]], a friend of John Wayne, Wayne hired Hopper for a role in ''[[The Sons of Katie Elder]]'' (1965), also directed by Hathaway, which enabled Hopper to restart his film career.<ref>Charlie Rose (December 21, 1994). [http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/7142 Dennis Hopper Interview] (video). ''CharlieRose.com''; Charlie Rose LLC.

Hopper had a supporting role as the bet-taker, "Babalugats," in ''[[Cool Hand Luke]]'' (1967). In 1968, Hopper teamed with [[Peter Fonda]], [[Terry Southern]] and [[Jack Nicholson]] to make ''[[Easy Rider]]'', which premiered in July 1969. With the release of ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'' a month earlier, Hopper had starring roles in two major box office films that summer. Hopper won wide acclaim as the director for his improvisational methods and innovative editing for ''[[Easy Rider]]''.<ref name="Biskind2011">{{cite book|author=Peter Biskind|title=Easy Riders Raging Bulls: How the Sex-Drugs-And Rock 'N Roll Generation Save|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J3ucTdpeE9YC&pg=PA74|accessdate=18 November 2012|date=13 December 2011|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4391-2661-5|pages=74–}}</ref> The production was plagued by creative differences and personal acrimony between Fonda and Hopper, the dissolution of Hopper's marriage to Hayward, his unwillingness to leave the editor's desk and his accelerating abuse of drugs and alcohol.<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Biskind|title=Easy Riders Raging Bulls: How the Sex-Drugs-And Rock 'N Roll Generation Save|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J3ucTdpeE9YC&pg=PA71|accessdate=19 November 2012|date=13 December 2011|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4391-2661-5|pages=71–}}</ref> Hopper said of ''Easy Rider'': "The cocaine problem in the United States is really because of me. There was no cocaine before Easy Rider on the street. After Easy Rider, it was everywhere."<ref>http://www.jahsonic.com/NewHollywood.html</ref>

In 1971, Hopper released ''[[The Last Movie]]''. Expecting an accessible follow-up to ''Easy Rider'', audiences were treated to artistic flourishes (like the inclusion of "scene missing" card shots) and a hazily existentialist plot that dabbled in non-linearity and the absurd. The film was dismissed by audiences and critics alike during its first domestic engagement in New York City. During the tumultuous editing process, Hopper ensconced himself at the [[Mabel Dodge Luhan House]] in [[Taos, New Mexico]], which he had purchased in 1970,<ref name="Thompson">{{cite news|url=http://www.nmmagazine.com/outings_mdlhouse_feb10.php|title=Outings: Mabel Dodge Luhan House|last=Thompson|first=Linda|work=[[New Mexico Magazine]]|accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref> for almost an entire year. In between contesting Fonda's rights to the majority of the residual profits from ''Easy Rider'', he married Michelle Phillips in October 1970.

Hopper was able to sustain his lifestyle and a measure of celebrity by acting in numerous [[low budget]] and European films throughout the 1970s as the archetypical "tormented maniac", including ''[[Mad Dog Morgan]]'' (1976), ''[[Tracks (1976 film)|Tracks]]'' (1976), and ''[[The American Friend]]'' (1977). With [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s blockbuster ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979), Hopper returned to prominence as a hyper-manic Vietnam-era photojournalist. Stepping in for an overwhelmed director, Hopper won praise in 1980 for his directing and acting in ''[[Out of the Blue (1980 film)|Out of the Blue]]''. Immediately thereafter, Hopper starred as an addled short-order cook "Cracker" in the [[Neil Young]]/[[Dean Stockwell]] low-budget collaboration ''[[Human Highway]]''. Production was reportedly often delayed by his unreliable behavior. [[Peter Biskind]] states in the [[New Hollywood]] history ''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls'' that Hopper's cocaine intake had reached three grams a day by this time, complemented by 30 beers, and some marijuana and [[Cuba libre]]s.

After staging a "suicide attempt" (really more of a [[stunt performer|daredevil]] act) in a coffin using 17 sticks of dynamite during an "art happening" at the [[Rice University]] Media Center (filmed by professor and documentary filmmaker Brian Huberman),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brianhuberman.com/about/ |title=Brian Huberman About Brian Hubberman |publisher=Brianhuberman.com |date=1995-01-05 |accessdate=2013-01-14}}</ref> and later disappearing into the Mexican desert during a particularly extravagant bender, Hopper entered a [[drug rehabilitation]] program in 1983.

Though Hopper gave critically acclaimed performances in ''[[Rumble Fish]]'' (1983) and ''[[The Osterman Weekend (film)|The Osterman Weekend]]'' (1983), it was not until he portrayed the gas-huffing, obscenity-screaming iconic villain [[Frank Booth (Blue Velvet)|Frank Booth]] in [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986) that his career truly revived. On reading the script Hopper said to Lynch: "You have to let me play Frank Booth. Because I am Frank Booth!"<ref>Egan, Barry (November 2, 2007). [http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/film-cinema/keeping-your-hair-on-1210900.html Keeping your hair on]. [[Irish Independent|The Independent]]. Retrieved 2010-05-29.</ref> He won critical acclaim and several awards for this role, and in the same year received an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role as an alcoholic assistant basketball coach in ''[[Hoosiers]]''.

In 1988, Hopper directed the critically acclaimed ''[[Colors (film)|Colors]]''. He was nominated for an ''[[Emmy Award]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/dennis-hopper |title=Dennis Hopper Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-14}}</ref> for the 1991 [[HBO]] films ''Paris Trout'' and ''Doublecrossed'' (in which he played real life drug smuggler and [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] informant [[Barry Seal]]). The same year he starred as [[Bowser (character)|King Koopa]] in ''[[Super Mario Bros. (film)|Super Mario Bros.]]'', a 1993 critical and commercial failure loosely based on the video game of the same name.<ref name="AVCRR"/> In 1993, he played Clifford Worley in ''[[True Romance]]''. He co-starred in the 1994 blockbuster ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'' with [[Keanu Reeves]] and [[Sandra Bullock]], and as magic-phobic [[H. P. Lovecraft]] in the TV movie ''[[Witch Hunt (1994 film)|Witch Hunt]]''.

In 1995, Hopper played a greedy TV self-help guru, Dr. Luther Waxling in ''[[Search and Destroy (film)|Search and Destroy]]''. The same year, he starred as Deacon, the one-eyed nemesis of Kevin Costner in ''[[Waterworld]]''. And in 1996 he starred in the science fiction comedy [[Space Truckers]] directed by [[Stuart Gordon]]. In 2003, Hopper was in the running for the dual lead in the indie horror drama ''[[Firecracker (film)|Firecracker]]'', but was ousted at the last minute in favor of [[Mike Patton]]. In 2005, Hopper played Paul Kaufman in George A. Romero's ''[[Land of the Dead]]''. In 2008, Hopper starred in ''[[An American Carol]]''. In 2008 he also played The Death in [[Wim Wenders]]' [[Palermo Shooting]]. His last major feature film appearance was in the 2008 film ''[[Elegy (film)|Elegy]]'' with Sir [[Ben Kingsley]], [[Penélope Cruz]] and [[Debbie Harry]]. For his last performance, he was the voice of Tony, the alpha-male of the Eastern wolf pack inside the 2010 3D computer animated film ''[[Alpha and Omega (film)|Alpha and Omega]]''. He died before the movie was released. This brought the directors to dedicate the film to his memory at the beginning of the movie credits.

===Television===
Hopper debuted in an episode of the Richard Boone television series ''[[Medic (TV series)|Medic]]'' in 1955, portraying a young [[epilepsy|epileptic]].

He appeared as an arrogant young gunfighter, the Utah Kid, in the 1956 episode "Quicksand" of the first hour-long television [[western (genre)|western]] [[television program|television series]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Cheyenne (TV series)|Cheyenne]]'', starring [[Clint Walker]]. In the story line, the Kid gave Cheyenne Bodie no choice but to kill him in a gunfight. In 1957, he played [[Billy the Kid]] on the episode "Brannigan's Boots" of ABC's ''[[Sugarfoot]]'', with [[Will Hutchins]].

He subsequently appeared in over 140 episodes of television shows such as ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', ''[[Bonanza]]'', ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'', ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[The Barbara Stanwyck Show]]'', ''[[The Defenders (1961 TV series)|The Defenders]]'', ''[[The Investigators (American TV series)|The Investigators]]'', ''[[The Legend of Jesse James (TV series)|The Legend of Jesse James]]'', ''[[Entourage (TV series)|Entourage]]'', ''[[The Big Valley]]'', ''[[The Time Tunnel]]'', ''[[The Rifleman]]'' in which he appeared in the premier episode as a sharpshooter <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riflemanconnors.com/dennis_hopper.htm|title=Dennis Hopper|publisher=Riflemanconnors.com |date=1936-05-17|accessdate=2009-11-12}}</ref> and ''[[Combat!]]''.

Hopper teamed with Nike in the early 1990s to make a series of television commercials. He appeared as a "crazed referee" in those ads.<ref>http://www.tailgatingideas.com/dennis-hopper-nike-football-commercials/</ref> He portrayed villain [[Victor Drazen]] in the first season of the popular drama ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'' on the [[Fox television network]].

Hopper starred as a U.S. Army colonel in the [[NBC]] 2005 television series ''[[E-Ring]]'', a drama set at [[The Pentagon]], but the series was cancelled after 14 episodes aired in the USA. Hopper appeared in all 22 episodes that were filmed. He also played the part of [[record producer]] Ben Cendars in the Starz television series ''[[Crash (2008 TV series)|Crash]]'', which lasted two seasons (26 episodes).

==Photography and art==

His photographs of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s 1963 March on Washington and 1965 civil-rights march in Selma, Alabama, were published. His intimate and unguarded images of celebrities like Andy Warhol and [[Jane Fonda]] were the subject of gallery shows and were collected in a book, "1712 North Crescent Heights."

According to ''Rolling Stone'' magazine, Hopper was "one of Hollywood's most notorious drug addicts" for 20 years. He spent much of the 1970s and early 1980s living as an "outcast" in a small town after the success of ''Easy Rider''. Hopper was also "notorious for his troubled relationships with women," including [[Michelle Phillips]], who divorced him after eight days of marriage.<ref name="RSObit">{{cite web|

In 1999, [[Rip Torn]] filed a [[defamation]] lawsuit against Hopper over a story Hopper told on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''.

A [[judge]] ruled in Torn's favor and Hopper was ordered to pay [[United States dollar|$]]475,000 in [[damages]].
