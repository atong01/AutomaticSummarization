The bulking phase entails remaining in a net positive energy balance (calorie surplus). The amount of a surplus that a person remains in is based on the person's goals, as a bigger surplus and longer bulking phase will create more fat tissue. The surplus of calories relative to one's energy balance will ensure that muscles remain in a state of anabolism. The cutting phase entails remaining in a net negative energy balance (calorie deficit). The main goal of cutting is to oxidize fat but also to preserve as much muscle as possible. The larger the calorie deficit, the faster one will lose weight.

There are many reasons that overtraining occurs, including lack of adequate nutrition, lack of recovery time between workouts, insufficient sleep, and training at a high intensity for too long (a lack of splitting apart workouts). Training at a high intensity too frequently also stimulates the<space/><link><target>central nervous system</target></link><space/>(CNS) and can result in a hyper-adrenergic state that interferes with sleep patterns.<extension extension_name='ref' name="LonnieLowery_Overtraining">Testosterone Nation The Warrior Nerd: Overtraining or Under-eating?

One article published by<space/><italics><link><target>Muscle &amp; Fitness</target></link></italics><space/>magazine stated that you can &quot;Overtrain for Big Gains&quot;. It suggested that if one is planning a restful holiday and they do not wish to inhibit their bodybuilding lifestyle too much, they should overtrain before taking the holiday, so the body can rest easily and recuperate and grow. Overtraining can be used advantageously, as when a bodybuilder is purposely overtrained for a brief period of time to super compensate during a regeneration phase. These are known as &quot;shock micro-cycles&quot; and were a key training technique used by Soviet athletes.<extension extension_name='ref' name="pmid14719980"><template><target>cite journal</target><arg name="author">Smith DJ
