A similar disk reconstructed the image at the receiver. Synchronization of the receiver disc rotation was handled through sync pulses broadcast with the image information. However these mechanical systems were slow, the images were dim and flickered severely, and the image resolution very low. Camera systems used similar spinning discs and required intensely bright illumination of the subject for the light detector to work.</paragraph><paragraph>Analog television did not really begin as an industry until the development of the<space/><link><target>cathode-ray tube</target></link><space/>(CRT), which uses a focused electron beam to trace lines across a<space/><link><target>phosphor</target></link><space/>coated surface. The electron beam could be swept across the screen much faster than any mechanical disc system, allowing for more closely spaced scan lines and much higher image resolution. Also far less maintenance was required of an all-electronic system compared to a spinning disc system.

Each frame of a television image is composed of lines drawn on the screen. The lines are of varying brightness; the whole set of lines is drawn quickly enough that the human eye perceives it as one image. The next sequential frame is displayed, allowing the depiction of motion. The analog television signal contains timing and synchronization information so that the receiver can reconstruct a two-dimensional moving image from a one-dimensional time-varying signal.</paragraph><paragraph>The first<space/><link><target>commercial television</target></link><space/>systems were<space/><link><target>black-and-white</target></link>; The beginning of<space/><link><target>color television</target></link><space/>was in the 1950s.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blcolortelevision.htm</arg><arg name="title">Color Television History</arg><arg name="work">Publication date unknown</arg><arg name="publisher">About.com</arg><arg name="accessdate">24 November 2010</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>A practical television system needs to take<space/><link><target>luma (video)</target><part>luminance</part></link>,<space/><link><target>chrominance</target></link><space/>(in a color system), synchronization (horizontal and vertical), and<space/><link><target>Sound recording and reproduction</target><part>audio</part></link><space/>signals, and broadcast them over a radio transmission. The transmission system must include a means of<space/><link><target>television channel</target></link><space/>selection.</paragraph><paragraph>Analog<space/><link><target>broadcast television systems</target></link><space/>come in a variety of frame rates and resolutions. Further differences exist in the frequency and modulation of the audio carrier. The monochrome combinations still existing in the 1950s are standardized by the<space/><link><target>International Telecommunication Union</target></link><space/>(ITU) as capital letters A through N. When color television was introduced, the hue and saturation information was added to the monochrome signals in a way that black &amp; white televisions ignore. This way backwards compatibility was achieved. That concept is true for all analog television standards.</paragraph><paragraph>However there are three standards for the way the additional color information can be encoded and transmitted. The first was the American NTSC (National Television Systems Committee) color television system. The European/Australian PAL (Phase Alternation Line rate) and the French-Former Soviet Union SECAM (Squentiel Couleur Avec Mmoire) standard were developed later and attempt to cure certain defects of the NTSC system. PAL's color encoding is similar to the NTSC systems. SECAM, though, uses a different modulation approach than PAL or NTSC.</paragraph><paragraph>In principle all three color encoding systems can be combined with any scan line/frame rate combination. Therefore, in order to describe a given signal completely, it's necessary to quote the color system and the broadcast standard as capital letter. For example the United States uses NTSC-M, the UK uses PAL-I, France uses SECAM-L, much of Western Europe and Australia uses PAL-B/G, most of Eastern Europe uses PAL-D/K or SECAM-D/K and so on.</paragraph><paragraph>However not all of these possible combinations actually exist. NTSC is currently<space/><italics>only</italics><space/>used with system M, even though there were experiments with NTSC-A (405 line) and NTSC-I (625 line) in the UK. PAL is used with a variety of 625-line standards (B,G,D,K,I,N) but also with the North American 525-line standard, accordingly named<space/><link><target>PAL-M</target></link>. Likewise, SECAM is used with a variety of 625-line standards.</paragraph><paragraph>For this reason many people refer to any 625/25 type signal as &quot;PAL&quot; and to any 525/30 signal as &quot;NTSC&quot;, even when referring to digital signals, for example, on<space/><link><target>DVD-Video</target></link><space/>which don't contain any analog color encoding, thus no PAL or NTSC signals at all. Even though this usage is common, it is misleading as that is not the original meaning of the terms PAL/SECAM/NTSC.</paragraph><paragraph>Although a number of different broadcast television systems were in use worldwide, the same principles of operation apply.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.paradiso-design.net/TVsystems_worldwide.html</arg><arg name="title">Color subcarrier frequency and TV Standards/TV Systems</arg><arg name="work">Publication dates 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 last updated 2005/12/15</arg><arg name="publisher">Paradiso Design</arg><arg name="accessdate">24 November 2010</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>In many countries, over-the-air<space/><link><target>broadcast television</target></link><space/>of<space/><link><target>analog audio</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>analog video</target></link><space/>signals has been discontinued, to allow the re-use of the television broadcast<space/><link><target>radio spectrum</target></link><space/>for other services such as<space/><link><target>datacasting</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>subchannel</target><trail>s</trail></link>.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Displaying an image</heading><paragraph>A<space/><link><target>cathode-ray tube</target></link><space/>(CRT) television displays an image by scanning a beam of<space/><link><target>electrons</target></link><space/>across the screen in a pattern of horizontal lines known as a<space/><link><target>raster scan</target><part>raster</part></link>. At the end of each line the beam returns to the start of the next line; the end of the last line is a link that returns to the top of the screen. As it passes each point the intensity of the beam is varied, varying the<space/><link><target>luminance</target></link><space/>of that point. A<space/><link><target>color television</target></link><space/>system is identical except that an additional signal known as<space/><link><target>chrominance</target></link><space/>controls the color of the spot.</paragraph><paragraph>Raster scanning is shown in a slightly simplified form below.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Raster-scan.svg</target><part>center</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>When analog television was developed, no affordable technology for storing any video signals existed; the luminance signal has to be generated and transmitted at the same time at which it is displayed on the CRT.

Flickering of the image can be partially solved using a long persistence phosphor coating on the CRT, so that successive images fade slowly. However, slow phosphor has the negative side-effect of causing image smearing and blurring when there is a large amount of rapid on-screen motion occurring.</paragraph><paragraph>The maximum<space/><link><target>frame rate</target></link><space/>depends on the<space/><link><target>Bandwidth (signal processing)</target><part>bandwidth</part></link><space/>of the electronics and the transmission system, and the number of horizontal scan lines in the image.

A channel actually consists of two signals: the picture information is transmitted using<space/><link><target>amplitude modulation</target></link><space/>on one frequency, and the sound is transmitted with<space/><link><target>frequency modulation</target></link><space/>at a frequency at a fixed offset (typically 4.5 to 6&amp;nbsp;MHz) from the picture signal.</paragraph><paragraph>The channel frequencies chosen represent a compromise between allowing enough<space/><link><target>Bandwidth (signal processing)</target><part>bandwidth</part></link><space/>for video (and hence satisfactory picture resolution), and allowing enough channels to be packed into the available frequency band.

A<space/><link><target>demodulator</target></link><space/>recovers the video signal. Also at the output of the same demodulator is a new frequency modulated sound carrier at the offset frequency. In some sets made before 1948, this was filtered out, and the sound IF of about 22&amp;nbsp;MHz was sent to an FM demodulator to recover the basic sound signal. In newer sets, this new carrier at the offset frequency was allowed to remain as<space/><italics>intercarrier sound</italics>, and it was sent to an FM demodulator to recover the basic sound signal. One particular advantage of intercarrier sound is that when the front panel fine tuning knob is adjusted, the sound carrier frequency does not change with the tuning, but stays at the above-mentioned offset frequency. Consequently, it is easier to tune the picture without losing the sound.</paragraph><paragraph>So the FM sound carrier is then demodulated, amplified, and used to drive a loudspeaker.

Note that the RF signal modulation is inverted compared to the conventional AM: the minimum video signal level corresponds to maximum carrier amplitude, and vice versa. To ensure good linearity (fidelity), consistent with affordable manufacturing costs of transmitters and receivers, the video carrier is never shut off altogether. When intercarrier sound was invented later in 1948, not completely shutting off the carrier had the side effect of allowing intercarrier sound to be economically implemented.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Video-line.svg</target><part>center</part><part>alt=Diagram showing video signal amplitude against time.</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>Each line of the displayed image is transmitted using a signal as shown above.

However, these are not simply transmitted as three separate signals, because:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>Such a signal would not be compatible with monochrome receivers (an important consideration when color broadcasting was first introduced);</listitem><listitem>it would occupy three times the bandwidth of existing television, requiring a decrease in the number of television channels available; and,</listitem><listitem>typical problems with signal transmission (such as differing received signal levels between different colors) would produce unpleasant side effects.</listitem></list><paragraph>Instead, the RGB signals are converted into<space/><link><target>YUV</target></link><space/>form, where the Y signal represents the lightness and darkness (luminance) of the colors in the image. Because the rendering of colors in this way is the goal of both black and white (monochrome) film and black and white (monochrome) television systems, the Y signal is ideal for transmission as the luminance signal. This ensures a monochrome receiver will display a correct picture in black and white, where a given color is reproduced by a shade of gray that correctly reflects how light or dark the original color is. The U and V signals are &quot;color difference&quot; signals. The U signal is the difference between the B signal and the Y signal, also known as B minus Y (B-Y), and the V signal is the difference between the R signal and the Y signal, also known as R minus Y (R-Y). The U signal then represents how &quot;purplish-blue&quot; or its complementary color &quot;yellowish-green&quot; the color is, and the V signal how &quot;purplish-red&quot; or its complementary &quot;greenish-cyan&quot; it is. The advantage of this scheme is that the U and V signals are zero when the picture has no color content. Since the human eye is more sensitive to errors in luminance than in color, the U and V signals can be transmitted in a relatively<space/><link><target>lossy compression</target><part>lossy</part></link><space/>(specifically: bandwidth-limited) way with acceptable results.</paragraph><paragraph>In the receiver, a single demodulator can extract an additive combination of U plus V. An example is the X demodulator used in the X/Z demodulation system. In that same system, a second demodulator, the Z demodulator, also extracts an additive combination of U plus V, but in a different ratio. The X and Z color difference signals are further matrixed into three color difference signals, (R-Y), (B-Y), and (G-Y). The combinations of usually two, but sometimes three demodulators were:</paragraph><paragraph>a) (I) / (Q), (as used in the 1954 RCA CTC-2 and the 1985 RCA &quot;Colortrack&quot; series, and the 1954 Arvin, and some professional color monitors in the 1990s),</paragraph><paragraph>b) (R-Y) / (Q), as used in the 1955 RCA 21 inch color receiver,</paragraph><paragraph>c) (R-Y) / (B-Y), used in the first color receiver on the market (Westinghouse, not RCA),</paragraph><paragraph>d) (R-Y) / (G-Y), (as used in the RCA Victor CTC-4 chassis),</paragraph><paragraph>e) (R-Y) / (B-Y) / (G-Y),</paragraph><paragraph>f) (X) / (Z), as used in many receivers of the late 50's and throughout the 60's.</paragraph><paragraph>In the end, further matrixing of the above color-difference signals c through f yielded the three color-difference signals, (R-Y), (B-Y), and (G-Y).</paragraph><paragraph>The R,G,B signals in the receiver needed for the display device (CRT, Plasma display or LCD display) are electronically derived by matrixing as follows: R is the additive combination of (R-Y) with Y, G is the additive combination of (G-Y) with Y, and B is the additive combination of (B-Y) with Y. All of this is accomplished electronically. It can be seen that in the combining process, the low resolution portion of the Y signals cancel out, leaving R,G, and B signals able to render a low-resolution image in full color. However, the higher resolution portions of the Y signals do not cancel out, and so are equally present in R, G, and B, producing the higher definition (higher resolution) image detail in monochrome, although it appears to the human eye as a full-color and full resolution picture.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Waveform monitor.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>Color signals mixed with video signal (two horizontal lines in sequence)</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>In the NTSC and PAL color systems, U and V are transmitted by using quadrature amplitude modulation of a subcarrier. This kind of modulation applies two independent signals to one subcarrier, with the idea that both signals will be recovered independently at the receive end. Before transmission, the subcarrier itself, is removed from the active (visible) portion of the video, and moved, in the form of a burst, to the horizontal blanking portion, which is not directly visible on screen. (More about the burst below.)</paragraph><paragraph>For NTSC, the subcarrier is a 3.58&amp;nbsp;MHz sine wave. For the PAL system it is a 4.43&amp;nbsp;MHz sine wave. After the above-mentioned quadrature amplitude modulation of the subcarrier, subcarrier sidebands are produced, and the subcarrier itself is filtered out of the visible portion of the video, since it is the subcarrier sidebands that carry all of the U and V information, and the subcarrier itself carries no information.</paragraph><paragraph>The resulting subcarrier sidebands is also known as &quot;chroma&quot; or &quot;chrominance&quot;. Physically, this chrominance signal is a 3.58&amp;nbsp;MHz(NTSC) or 4.43&amp;nbsp;MHz(PAL) sine wave which, in response to changing U and V values, changes phase as compared to the subcarrier, and also changes amplitude.</paragraph><paragraph>As it turns out, the chroma amplitude (when considered together with the Y signal) represents the approximate saturation of a color, and the chroma phase against the subcarrier as reference, approximately represents the hue of the color. For particular test colors found in the test color bar pattern, exact amplitudes and phases are sometimes defined for test and trouble shooting purposes only.</paragraph><paragraph>Although, in response to changing U and V values, the chroma sinewave changes phase with respect to the subcarrier, it's not correct to say that the subcarrier is simply &quot;phase modulated&quot;. That is because a single sine wave U test signal with QAM produces only one pair of sidebands, whereas real phase modulation under the same test conditions would produce multiple sets of sidebands occupying more frequency spectrum.</paragraph><paragraph>In NTSC, the chrominance sine wave has the same average frequency as the subcarrier frequency. But a spectrum analyzer instrument shows that, for transmitted chrominance, the frequency component at the subcarrier frequency is actually zero energy, verifying that the subcarrier was indeed removed before transmission.</paragraph><paragraph>These sideband frequencies are within the luminance signal band, which is why they are called &quot;subcarrier&quot; sidebands instead of simply &quot;carrier&quot; sidebands. Their exact frequencies were chosen such that (for NTSC), they are midway between two harmonics of the frame repetition rate, thus ensuring that the majority of the power of the luminance signal does not overlap with the power of the chrominance signal.</paragraph><paragraph>In the British PAL (D) system, the actual chrominance center frequency, with equal lower and upper sidebands, is 4.43361875&amp;nbsp;MHz, a direct multiple of the scan rate frequency. This frequency was chosen to minimize the chrominance beat interference pattern that would be visible in areas of high color saturation in the transmitted picture.</paragraph><paragraph>At certain times, the chrominance signal represents only the U signal, and 70 nanoseconds (NTSC) later, the chrominance signal represents only the V signal. (This is the nature of the quadrature amplitude modulation process that created the chrominance signal.) About 70 nanoseconds later still, -U, and another 70 nanoseconds, -V.</paragraph><paragraph>So to extract U, a synchronous demodulator is utilized, which uses the subcarrier to briefly gate (sample) the chroma every 280 nanoseconds, so that the output is only a train of discrete pulses, each having an amplitude that is the same as the original U signal at the corresponding time. In effect, these pulses are discrete-time analog samples of the U signal. The pulses are then low-pass filtered so that the original analog continuous-time U signal is recovered. For V, a 90 degree shifted subcarrier briefly gates the chroma signal every 280 nanoseconds, and the rest of the process is identical to that used for the U signal.</paragraph><paragraph>Gating at any other time than those times mentioned above will yield an additive mixture of any two of U, V, -U, or -V. One of these &quot;off-axis&quot; (that is, off the U and V axis) gating methods is called I/Q demodulation. Another much more popular &quot;off-axis&quot; scheme was the X/Z demodulation system. Further matrixing recovered the original U and V signals. This scheme was actually the most popular demodulator scheme throughout the 60's.</paragraph><paragraph>The above process uses the subcarrier. But as previously mentioned, it was deleted before transmission, and only the chroma is transmitted. Therefore the receiver must reconstitute the subcarrier. For this purpose, a short burst of subcarrier, known as the color burst, is transmitted during the back porch (re-trace blanking period) of each scan line. A subcarrier oscillator in the receiver locks onto this signal (see phase-locked loop) to achieve a phase reference, resulting in the oscillator producing the reconstituted subcarrier.</paragraph><paragraph>(A second use of the burst in more expensive or newer receiver models is a reference to an AGC system to compensate for chroma gain imperfections in reception.)<link><target>File:Hanoverbars without PAL delay.png</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>Test card showing &quot;Hanover Bars&quot; (color banding phase effect) in Pal S (simple) signal mode of transmission.</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>NTSC uses this process unmodified. Unfortunately, this often results in poor color reproduction due to phase errors in the received signal, caused sometimes by multipath, but mostly by poor implementation at the studio end. With the advent of solid state receivers, cable TV, and digital studio equipment for conversion to an over-the-air analog signal, these NTSC problems have been largely fixed, leaving operator error at the studio end as the sole color rendition weakness of the NTSC system. In any case, the PAL D (delay) system mostly corrects these kind of errors by reversing the phase of the signal on each successive line, and the averaging the results over pairs of lines. This process is achieved by the use of a 1H (where H = horizontal scan frequency) duration delay line. (A typical circuit used with this device converts the low frequency color signal to<space/><link><target>ultrasound</target></link><space/>and back again). Phase shift errors between successive lines are therefore cancelled out and the wanted signal amplitude is increased when the two in-phase (<link><target>coincident</target></link>) signals are re-combined.</paragraph><paragraph>NTSC is more spectrum efficient than PAL, giving more picture detail for a given bandwidth. This is because sophisticated comb filters in receivers are more effective with NTSC's 4 field color phase cadence compared to PAL's 8 field cadence. However, in the end, the larger channel width of most PAL systems in Europe still give their PAL systems the edge in transmitting more picture detail.</paragraph><paragraph>In the<space/><link><target>SECAM</target></link><space/>television system, U and V are transmitted on<space/><italics>alternate</italics><space/>lines, using simple<space/><link><target>frequency modulation</target></link><space/>of two different color subcarriers.</paragraph><paragraph>In some analog color CRT displays, starting in 1956, the brightness control signal (<link><target>luminance</target></link>) is fed to the<space/><link><target>cathode</target></link><space/>connections of the electron guns, and the color difference signals (<link><target>chrominance</target></link><space/>signals) are fed to the control grids connections. This simple CRT matrix mixing technique was replaced in later<space/><link><target>solid state (electronics)</target><part>solid state</part></link><space/>designs of signal processing with the original matrixing method used in the 1954 and 1955 color TV receivers.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Synchronization</heading><paragraph>Synchronizing pulses added to the video signal at the end of every<space/><link><target>scan line</target></link><space/>and video frame ensure that the sweep oscillators in the receiver remain locked in step with the transmitted signal, so that the image can be reconstructed on the receiver screen.<extension extension_name='ref' name="tveng"><preblock><preline><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last"><space/>Gupta
