Its overall score is 0.2 point higher than last year, with deteriorations in trade freedom, fiscal freedom, monetary freedom, and freedom from corruption counterbalanced by an improvement in business freedom. Cuba is ranked least free of 29 countries in the South and Central America/Caribbean region, and its overall score is significantly lower than the regional average. Over the 20-year history of the Index, Cubas economic freedom has been stagnant near the bottom of the repressed category. Its overall score improvement has been less than 1 point over the past two decades, with score gains in fiscal freedom and freedom from corruption offset by double-digit declines in business freedom and investment freedom. Despite some progress in restructuring the state sector since 2010, the private sector remains constrained by heavy regulations and tight state controls. Open-market policies are not in place to spur growth in trade and investment, and the lack of competition continues to stifle dynamic economic expansion. A watered-down reform package endorsed by the Cuban Communist Party has trimmed the number of state workers and expanded the list of approved professions, but many details of the reform remain obscure.<extension extension_name='ref' name="2014 Index of Economic Freedom"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="title">2014 Index of Economic Freedom</arg><arg name="url">http://www.heritage.org/index/country/cuba</arg><arg name="website">http://www.heritage.org</arg><arg name="publisher">The Heritage Foundation</arg><arg name="accessdate">24 November 2014</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The top individual income tax rate is 50 percent.
