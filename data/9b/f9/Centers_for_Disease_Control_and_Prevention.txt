The '''Centers for Disease Control and Prevention''' ('''CDC''') is the leading national public health institute of the United States. The CDC is a [[Federal agencies of the United States|federal agency]] under the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] and is headquartered in [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] [[DeKalb County, Georgia]], a few miles northeast of the [[Greater Atlanta|Atlanta]] city limits.<!-- The CDC's public mailing address is in Atlanta.

Its main goal is to protect [[public health]] and safety through the control and prevention of disease, injury, and disability. The CDC focuses national attention on developing and applying disease control and prevention. It especially focuses its attention on [[infectious disease]], [[Foodborne illness|food borne pathogens]], [[environmental health]], [[occupational safety and health]], [[health promotion]], [[injury prevention]] and educational activities designed to improve the health of [[United States citizens]]. In addition, the CDC researches and provides information on [[non-infectious diseases]] such as [[obesity]] and [[diabetes]] and is a founding member of the [[International Association of National Public Health Institutes]].<ref>{{URL|cdc.gov}}</ref>

The new agency was a branch of the [[U.S. Public Health Service]] and Atlanta was chosen as the location because [[malaria]] was endemic in the Southern United States.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/repo_A87OY4Vt|title = War, Tropical Disease, and the Emergence of National Public Health Capacity in the United States|last = Sledge|first = Daniel|date = 2012|journal = Studies in American Political Development|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> The agency changed names (see infobox on top) before adopting the name ''Communicable Disease Center'' in 1946. Offices were located on the sixth floor of the Volunteer Building on Peachtree Street. With a budget at the time of about $1 million, 59 percent of its personnel were engaged in [[mosquito]] abatement and habitat control with the objective of control and eradication of malaria in the United States<ref>{{cite web|author=Division of Parasitic Diseases|title=Malaria Control in War Areas (1942–1945)|work=The History of Malaria, an Ancient Disease (2004)|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|location=[[Atlanta, Georgia]]|date=February 8, 2010|url=http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/history/index.htm#mcwa|accessdate=2011-03-21}}</ref> (see [[National Malaria Eradication Program]]).

Among its 369 employees, the main jobs at CDC were originally [[entomology]] and engineering. In CDC's initial years, more than six and a half million homes were sprayed, mostly with [[DDT]]. In 1946, there were only seven medical officers on duty and an early organization chart was drawn, somewhat fancifully, in the shape of a mosquito. Under Joseph Mountin, the CDC continued to advocate for public health issues and pushed to extend its responsibilities to many other [[Infectious disease|communicable diseases]].<ref> [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2030772 Dr. Joseph Mountin profile], ncbi.nlm.nih.gov; accessed August 19, 2015.</ref> In 1947, the CDC made a token payment of $10 to [[Emory University]] for {{convert|15|acre|m2}} of land on Clifton Road in DeKalb County, still the home of CDC headquarters today. CDC employees collected the money to make the purchase. The benefactor behind the “gift” was [[Robert W. Woodruff]], [[chairman of the board]] of [[The Coca-Cola Company]]. Woodruff had a long-time interest in [[malaria]] control, which had been a problem in areas where he went hunting. The same year, the PHS transferred its San Francisco based plague laboratory into the CDC as the Epidemiology Division, and a new Veterinary Diseases Division was established.<ref name="pmid8955706"/> An [[Epidemic Intelligence Service]] (EIS) was established in 1951, originally due to biological warfare concerns arising from the Korean War; it evolved into two-year postgraduate training program in epidemiology, and a prototype for Field Epidemiology Training Programs ([[FETP]]), now found in numerous countries, reflecting CDC's influence in promoting this model internationally.<ref>{{cite journal|last=White|first=Mark|first2=Sharon M.|last2=McDonnell|first3=Denise H.|last3=Werker|first4=Victor M.|last4=Cardenas|first5=Stephen B.|last5=Thacker|year=2001|title=Partnerships in International Applied Epidemiology Training and Service|journal=[[American Journal of Epidemiology]]|volume=154|issue=11|pages=993–999|doi=10.1093/aje/154.11.993}}</ref>

The mission of CDC expanded beyond its original focus on malaria to include [[sexually transmitted disease]]s when the Venereal Disease Division of the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) was transferred to the CDC in 1957. Shortly thereafter, Tuberculosis Control was transferred (in 1960) to the CDC from PHS, and then in 1963 the Immunization program was established.<ref>{{cite book|author=Beth E. Meyerson, Fred A.

It became the ''National Communicable Disease Center (NCDC)'' effective July 1, 1967.<ref name=NARA/> The organization was renamed the ''Center for Disease Control (CDC)'' on June 24, 1970, and ''Centers for Disease Control'' effective October 14, 1980.<ref name=NARA/> An act of the [[United States Congress]] appended the words "and Prevention" to the name effective October 27, 1992.

Currently the CDC focus has broadened to include [[Chronic (medical)|chronic diseases]], [[Disability|disabilities]], injury control, [[Occupational safety and health|workplace hazards]], [[environmental health]] threats, and terrorism preparedness. CDC combats emerging diseases and other health risks, including [[Congenital disorder|birth defects]], [[West Nile virus]], [[obesity]], [[Avian influenza|avian]], [[Swine influenza|swine]], and [[pandemic flu]], [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]], and [[bioterrorism]], to name a few. The organization would also prove to be an important factor in preventing the abuse of [[penicillin]].

In May 1994 the CDC admitted having sent several biological warfare agents to the Iraqi government from 1984 through 1989, including [[Botulinum toxin]], [[West Nile virus]], [[Yersinia pestis]] and [[Dengue fever]] virus.<ref>"The eleventh plague: the politics of biological and chemical warfare" (pp. 84-86) by [http://www.leonardcole.com Leonard A. Cole] (1993)</ref>

On April 21, 2005, then-CDC Director [[Julie Gerberding]], formally announced the reorganization of CDC to "confront the challenges of 21st-century health threats".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/futures/g_letter_04-21-05.htm|title=CDC Office of Director, The Futures Initiative|publisher=CDC—National Center for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=2008-12-28}}</ref> The four Coordinating Centers — established under the [[Presidency of George W.

The CDC's [[Biosafety Level 4]] laboratories are among only about a dozen such facilities in the country,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/disinfo.htm|title=CDC Special Pathogens Branch|accessdate=2010-01-19}}</ref> as well as one of only two official repositories of [[smallpox]] in the world. The second smallpox store resides at the [[State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR]] in the Russian Federation. The CDC revealed in 2014 that it had discovered several misplaced smallpox samples and that lab workers had potentially been infected with anthrax.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/recent-cdc-anthrax-and-smallpox-mishaps-signal-potential-dangers-259923|title=CDC Smallpox and Anthrax Mishaps Signal Other Potential Dangers|accessdate=October 17, 2014}}</ref>

==Diseases==
[[File:Smallpox eradication team.jpg|right|thumb|[[Donald Henderson]] as part of the CDC's smallpox eradication team in 1966.]]

===Influenza===
The CDC has launched campaigns targeting the transmission of [[influenza]], including the [[H1N1]] swine flu. The CDC has launched websites including [flu.gov] to educate people in proper hygiene.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/az.do CDC Health Topics A to Z], cdc.gov; accessed April 26, 2015.</ref>

===Other infectious diseases===
The CDC's website (see below) has information on other infectious diseases, including [[smallpox]], [[measles]], and others. The CDC runs a program that protects the public from rare and dangerous substances such as [[anthrax]] and the [[Ebola virus]]. The program, called the Select Agents Program, calls for inspections of labs in the U.S. that work with dangerous pathogens.<ref>Cohen, Bryan.

On June 15, 2011, the OIG published a report critical of the CDC's failure to oversee recipients' use of President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) funds.<ref name="pepfar">{{cite web|url=http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region4/41004006.pdf|title=Review of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Oversight of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief Funds for Fiscal Years 2007 Through 2009 (A-04-10-04006)|accessdate=2011-06-25}}</ref> The report read in part: {{Quote box|quote=Our review found that CDC did not always monitor recipients' use of President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) funds in accordance with departmental and other Federal requirements. CDC implements PEPFAR, working with ministries of health and other public health partners to combat HIV/AIDS by strengthening health systems and building sustainable HIV/AIDS programs in more than 75 countries in Africa, Asia, Central and South America, and the Caribbean. HHS receives PEPFAR funds from the Department of State through a memorandum of agreement. There was evidence that the CDC performed some monitoring of recipients' use of PEPFAR funds. However, most of the award files did not include all required documents or evidence to demonstrate that CDC performed required monitoring on all cooperative agreements. Of the 30 cooperative agreements in our sample, the award file for only 1 agreement contained all required documents. The remaining 29 award files were incomplete. In addition, 14 of 21 files were missing audit reports. (A report was not yet due for 9 of the 30 cooperative agreements.) The lack of required documentation demonstrates that CDC has not exercised proper stewardship over Federal PEPFAR funds because it did not consistently follow departmental and other Federal requirements in monitoring PEPFAR recipients.|source=|align=center|width=75%|quoted=yes}}

On June 5, 2012, the OIG published a report identifying vulnerabilities in vaccine management in the CDC's domestic 'Vaccines for Children' (VFC) program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-04-10-00430.pdf|title=Vaccines for Children Program: Vulnerabilities in Vaccine Management (Report OEI-04-10-00430)|accessdate=2012-06-06|date=June 2012}}</ref> The report read in part: {{Quote box |quote =Although the majority of storage temperatures we independently measured during a 2-week period were within the required ranges, VFC vaccines stored by 76 percent of the 45 selected providers were exposed to inappropriate temperatures for at least 5 cumulative hours during that period. Exposure to inappropriate temperatures can reduce vaccine potency and efficacy, increasing the risk that children are not provided with maximum protection against preventable diseases. Thirteen providers stored expired vaccines together with non-expired vaccines, increasing the risk of mistakenly administering the expired vaccine. Finally, the selected providers generally did not meet vaccine management requirements or maintain required documentation. Similarly, none of the five selected grantees met all VFC program oversight requirements, and grantee site visits were not effective in ensuring that providers met vaccine management requirements over time.|source=|align=center|width=75%|quoted=yes}}

On the November 19, 2012, the OIG published a report critical of the CDC Namibia Office's failure to properly monitor recipients' use of PEPFAR funds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region4/41204020.pdf|title=The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Namibia Office Did Not Always Properly Monitor Recipients' Use of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief Funds (A-04-12-04020)|accessdate=2012-12-07|date=November 2012}}</ref> The report read in part: {{Quote box|quote =CDC's office in [[Windhoek, Namibia]] (CDC Namibia), is responsible for PEPFAR funds awarded to government agencies and for-profit and non-profit organizations (recipients) in Namibia. Our audit found that CDC Namibia did not always monitor recipients' use of PEPFAR funds in accordance with HHS and other Federal requirements. There was evidence that CDC Namibia performed some monitoring of recipients' use of PEPFAR funds. However, most of the recipient cooperative agreement files did not include required documents or evidence that CDC Namibia had monitored all cooperative agreements. CDC Namibia did not consistently monitor the cooperative agreements in accordance with HHS and other Federal requirements because it did not have written policies and procedures for the monitoring process. As a result, CDC Namibia did not have assurance that PEPFAR funds were used as intended by law. We recommended that CDC Namibia implement standard operating procedures for monitoring recipients' use of PEPFAR funds. CDC concurred with our recommendation.|source=|align=center|width=75%|quoted=yes}}

==Controversies==
For 15 years, the CDC had direct oversight over the [http://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/timeline.htm "Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male"]. In the study, which lasted from 1932 to 1972, a group of African American men (nearly 400 of whom had syphilis) were studied to learn more about the disease. Notably, the disease was left untreated in the research subjects and they never gave their informed consent to serve as research subjects. The Tuskegee Study was [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment|initiated in 1932]] by the Public Health Service.  The CDC took over the study in 1957.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://exopolitics.blogs.com/ebolagate/2014/08/cdc-ran-the-tuskegee-experiment-for-15-years-.html|title=CDC Ran the Tuskegee Experiment for 15 Years: Any Connection To Operation Paperclip?|publisher=exopolitics.blogs.com|date=August 27, 2014|accessdate=August 4, 2015}}</ref>

In the wake of the [[Ebola virus cases in the United States|2014 Ebola crisis in the United States]], columnist [[Michelle Malkin]] drew attention to CDC priorities and spending patterns on politically devised non-disease control-related priorities, including motorcycle helmet laws, video games/media imagery studies, and playground injury centers.<ref>Malkin, Michelle.

==CDC zombie apocalypse outreach campaign==
{{Main|Preparedness 101: Zombie Apocalypse}}
On May 16, 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's blog published an article instructing the public on what to do to prepare for a [[Zombie (fictional)|zombie]] invasion. While the article did not claim that such a scenario was possible, it did use the popular culture appeal as a means of urging citizens to prepare for all potential hazards, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, and floods.<ref>{{cite web|last=Khan|first=Ali S.|title=CDC Zombie Warning|url=http://blogs.cdc.gov/publichealthmatters/2011/05/preparedness-101-zombie-apocalypse|work="Preparedness 101: Zombie Apocalypse"|date=2011-05-16|accessdate=2014-03-08}}</ref>

According to David Daigle, the Associate Director for Communications, Public Health Preparedness and Response, the idea arose when his team was discussing their upcoming hurricane information campaign and Daigle mused that "we say pretty much the same things every year, in the same way, and I just wonder how many people are paying attention." A social media employee mentioned that the subject of zombies had come up a lot on [[Twitter]] when she had been tweeting about the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] and [[radiation]]. The team realized that a campaign like this would most likely reach a different audience from the one that normally pays attention to hurricane preparedness warnings and went to work on the zombie campaign, launching it right before hurricane season began. "The whole idea was, if you're prepared for a zombie apocalypse, you're prepared for pretty much anything," said Daigle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skepticality.com/centers-zombie-control-prevention|title=Skepticality Podcast|work=Centers for Zombie Control and Prevention|date=2011-10-25|accessdate=2014-03-08}}</ref>

Once the blog article became popular, the CDC announced an open contest for YouTube submissions of the most creative and effective videos covering preparedness for a [[zombie apocalypse]] (or apocalypse of any kind), to be judged by the "CDC Zombie Task Force". Submissions were open until October 11, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prepare.challenge.gov|title=Are You Prepared?
