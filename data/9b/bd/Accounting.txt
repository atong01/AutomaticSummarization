==Etymology==
[[File:Hauptbuch Hochstetter vor 1828.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Early 19th-century [[ledger]].]]
Both the words accounting and accountancy were in use in [[Great Britain]] by the mid-1800s, and are derived from the words ''accompting'' and ''accountantship'' used in the 18th century.<ref name = "LN 2009">Labardin, Pierre, and Marc Nikitin. 2009. “Accounting and the Words to Tell It: An Historical Perspective.” ''Accounting, Business & Financial History'' 19 (2): 149–166.</ref> In [[Middle English]] (used roughly between the 12th and the late 15th century) the verb "to account" had the form ''accounten'', which was derived from the Old French word ''aconter'',<ref name = "B 1984">Baladouni, Vahé. 1984. “Etymological Observations on Some Accounting Terms.” ''The Accounting Historians Journal'' 11 (2): 101–109.</ref> which is in turn related to the [[Vulgar Latin]] word ''computare'', meaning "to reckon". The base of ''computare'' is ''putare'', which "variously meant to prune, to purify, to correct an account, hence, to count or calculate, as well as to think."<ref name = "B 1984"/>

The word "[[accountant]]" is derived from the French word {{lang|fr|''compter''}}, which is also derived from the Italian and [[Latin]] word {{lang|la|''computare''}}. The word was formerly written in English as "accomptant", but in process of time the word, which was always pronounced by dropping the "p", became gradually changed both in [[pronunciation]] and in [[orthography]] to its present form.<ref>Pixley, Francis William: Accountancy—constructive and recording accountancy (Sir Isaac Pitman & Sons, Ltd, London, 1900), p4</ref>

=== Accounting and accountancy ===
'''Accounting''' has variously been defined as the keeping or preparation of the financial records of an entity, the analysis, verification and reporting of such records and "the [[Generally accepted accounting principles|principles]] and procedures of accounting"; it also refers to the [[Job (role)|job]] of being an [[accountant]].<ref name = "Cambridge Business Accounting">{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/business-english/accounting |title=accounting noun - definition in the Business English Dictionary |year=2013 |website=Cambridge Dictionaries Online |publisher=Cambridge University Press |accessdate=30 December 2013}}</ref><ref name = "Cambridge British Accounting">{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/accounting?q=accounting |title=accounting noun - definition in the British English Dictionary & Thesaurus |year=2013 |website=Cambridge Dictionaries Online |publisher=Cambridge University Press |accessdate=30 December 2013}}</ref><ref name = "MW 2013 accounting">{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/accounting |title=accounting |year=2013 |website=Merriam-Webster |publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated |accessdate=30 December 2013}}</ref>

===Financial accounting===
{{main|Financial accounting}}
Financial accounting focuses on the reporting of an organization's financial information to external users of the information, such as [[investor]]s, [[Regulatory agency|regulators]] and [[Supply chain|suppliers]]. It calculates and records business transactions and prepares [[financial statement]]s for the external users in accordance with [[generally accepted accounting principles]] (GAAP).<ref name = "HDF 2006">{{Citation

}}</ref> GAAP, in turn, arises from the wide agreement between [[accounting research|accounting theory]] and practice, and change over time to meet the needs of decision-makers.<ref name = "NP 2013" />

Financial accounting produces past-oriented reports—for example the financial statements prepared in 2006 reports on performance in 2005—on an [[Annual report|annual]] or quarterly basis, generally about the organization as a whole.<ref name = "HDF 2006" />

===Management accounting===
{{main|Management accounting}}
Management accounting focuses on the measurement, analysis and reporting of information that can help managers in making decisions to fulfil the goals of an organization. In management accounting, internal measures and reports are based on [[cost-benefit analysis]], and are not required to follow GAAP.<ref name = "HDF 2006" /> In 2014 CIMA created the [http://www.cgma.org/Resources/Reports/Pages/GlobalManagementAccountingPrinciples.aspx Global Management Accounting Principles (GMAPs)]. The result of research from across 20 countries in five continents, the principles aim to guide best practice in the discipline.<ref name=FT>{{cite web|last=King|first=I.|title=New set of accounting principles can help drive sustainable success|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0b595a98-59fa-11e4-8771-00144feab7de.html?siteedition=uk#axzz3Q8Lp1OP9|publisher=ft.com|accessdate=28 January 2015}}</ref>

Management accounting produces future-oriented reports—for example the budget for 2006 is prepared in 2005—and the time span of reports varies widely. Such reports may include both financial and nonfinancial information, and may, for example, focus on specific products and departments.<ref name = "HDF 2006" />

===Auditing===
{{main|Financial audit|Internal audit}}
Auditing is the verification of assertions made by others regarding a payoff,<ref name = "B 1979">Baiman, Stanley. 1979. “Discussion of Auditing: Incentives and Truthful Reporting.” Journal of Accounting Research 17: 25–29.</ref> and in the context of accounting it is the "[[wiktionary:unbiased|unbiased]] examination and evaluation of the financial statements of an organization".<ref name = "I 2013">{{cite web |url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/audit.asp |title=Audit Definition |year=2013 |website=Investopedia |publisher= Investopedia US |accessdate=30 December 2013}}</ref>

An audit of financial statements aims to express or disclaim an opinion on the financial statements. The auditor expresses an opinion on the fairness with which the financial statements presents the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of an entity, in accordance with GAAP and "in all material respects". An auditor is also required to identify circumstances in which GAAP has not been consistently observed.<ref name = "SAS 1 Responsibilities">{{cite web |url=http://www.aicpa.org/Research/Standards/AuditAttest/DownloadableDocuments/AU-00110.pdf |title=Responsibilities and Functions of the Independent Auditor |date=November 1972 |website=AICPA |publisher=AICPA |accessdate=30 December 2013}}</ref>

===Accounting information systems===

An accounting information system is a part of an organisation's [[information system]] that focuses on processing accounting data.<ref name=OpenLearn>{{cite web|title=1.2 Accounting information systems|url=http://labspace.open.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=365833|work=Introduction to the context of accounting|publisher=OpenLearn|accessdate=3 February 2014}}</ref>

===Tax accounting===
{{main|Tax accounting}}
Tax accounting in the United States concentrates on the preparation, analysis and presentation of tax payments and tax returns. The U.S. tax system requires the use of specialised accounting principles for tax purposes which can differ from the [[generally accepted accounting principles]] (GAAP) for financial reporting.<ref name="autogenerated2010">{{ Citation | last = Droms| first= William G.| last2= Wright| first2= Jay O.| title= Finance and Accounting for nonfinancial Managers: All the Basics you need to Know| publisher= Basic Books, 2010| year= 2010| edition= 6th}}</ref> U.S. tax law covers four basic forms of business ownership: [[sole proprietorship]], [[partnership]], [[corporation]], and [[limited liability company]]. [[Corporate tax in the United States|Corporate]] and [[Income tax in the United States|personal]] income are taxed at different rates, both varying according to income levels and including varying marginal rates (taxed on each additional dollar of income) and average rates (set as a percentage of overall income).<ref name="autogenerated2010"/>

=== Accounting firms ===
{{main|Accounting networks and associations}}
Depending on its size, a company may be legally required to have their [[financial statement]]s [[auditing|audited]] by a qualified auditor, and audits are usually carried out by [[Accounting networks and associations|accounting firms]].<ref name = "Parliament Auditors 1">{{cite web |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldselect/ldeconaf/119/11904.htm |title= Auditors: Market concentration and their role, CHAPTER 1: Introduction  |year=2011 |website=UK Parliament |publisher=House of Lords |accessdate=January 1, 2014}}</ref>

Accounting firms grew in the United States and Europe in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, and through several mergers there were large international accounting firms by the mid-twentieth century. Further large mergers in the late twentieth century led to the dominance by the auditing market by the [[Big Five (audit firms)|Big Five]] accounting firms: [[Arthur Andersen]], [[Deloitte]], [[Ernst & Young]], [[KPMG]] and [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]].<ref name = "Parliament Auditors 2">{{cite web |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldselect/ldeconaf/119/11905.htm |title= Auditors: Market concentration and their role, CHAPTER 2: Concentration in the audit market   |year=2011 |website=UK Parliament |publisher=House of Lords |accessdate=January 1, 2014}}</ref> The [[Arthur Andersen#Demise|demise of Arthur Andersen]] following the [[Enron scandal]] reduced the Big Five to the [[Big Four (audit firms)|Big Four]].<ref name = "FT Big Four">{{cite web |url=http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=big-four |title= Definition of big four  |year=2014 |website=Financial Times Lexicon |publisher=The Financial Times Ltd |accessdate=January 1, 2014}}</ref>

=== Standard-setters ===
{{See also|Accounting standards|Convergence of accounting standards}}
[[Generally accepted accounting principles]] (GAAP) are accounting standards issued by national regulatory bodies. In addition, the [[International Accounting Standards Board]] (IASB) issues the [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS) implemented by 147 countries.<ref name = "NP 2013" /> While standards for international audit and assurance, ethics, education, and public sector accounting are all set by independent standard settings boards supported by IFAC. The International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board sets international standards for auditing, assurance, and quality control; the [[International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants]] (IESBA) <ref>[http://www.ifac.org/ethics] Ethics</ref> sets the internationally appropriate principles- based ''Code of Ethics for Professional Accounts'' the [[International Accounting Education Standards Board]] (IAESB) sets professional accounting education standards;<ref>[http://www.ifac.org/education] Education</ref> [[International Public Sector Accounting Standards]] Board (IPSASB) sets accrual-based international public sector accounting standards <ref>[http://www.ifac.org/public-sector] Public Sector.</ref>

Organizations in individual countries may issue accounting standards unique to the countries. For example, in the [[United States]] the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] (FASB) issues the Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, which form the basis of [[US GAAP]],<ref name = "NP 2013" /> and in the [[United Kingdom]] the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) sets accounting standards.<ref name="ICAEW Standards">{{Citation | url =http://www.icaew.com/en/library/subject-gateways/accounting-standards/knowledge-guide-to-uk-accounting-standards | title = Knowledge guide to UK Accounting Standards | publisher =ICAEW | year=2014 | accessdate =January 1, 2014}}</ref> However,as of 2012 "all major economies" have plans to [[Convergence (accounting)|converge]] towards or adopt the IFRS.<ref name=globalcon />

== Education and qualifications ==

== Accounting research ==
{{Main|Accounting research}}
Accounting research is [[research]] on the effects of economic events on the process of accounting, and the effects of reported information on economic events. It encompasses a broad range of research areas including [[financial accounting]], [[management accounting]], [[auditing]] and [[taxation]].<ref name = "OOS 2010">Oler, Derek K., Mitchell J. Oler, and Christopher J. Skousen. 2010. “Characterizing Accounting Research.” ''Accounting Horizons'' 24 (4): 635–670.</ref>

Accounting research is carried out both by academic researchers and practicing accountants. [[Methodology|Methodologies]] in academic accounting research can be classified into archival research, which examines "objective data collected from [[Information repository|repositories]]"; experimental research, which examines data "the researcher gathered by [[Controlled experiments|administering treatments to subjects]]"; and analytical research, which is "based on the act of [[Scientific modelling|formally modeling]] [[theories]] or substantiating ideas in mathematical terms". This classification is not exhaustive; other possible methodologies include the use of [[case studies]], [[computer simulations]] and [[field research]].<ref name="CSWW 2010">Coyne, Joshua G., Scott L. Summers, Brady Williams, and David a. Wood. 2010. “Accounting Program Research Rankings by Topical Area and Methodology.” ''Issues in Accounting Education'' 25 (4) (November): 631–654.</ref>

==Accounting information system==
{{main|Accounting information system}}
Many accounting practices have been simplified with the help of accounting computer-based software. An [[Enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) system is commonly used for a large organisation and it provides a comprehensive, centralized, integrated source of information that companies can use to manage all major business processes, from purchasing to manufacturing to human resources. 

[[Accounting information system]]s have reduced the cost of accumulating, storing, and reporting managerial accounting information and have made it possible to produce a more detailed account of all data that is entered into any given system.

==Accounting scandals==
{{Main|Accounting scandals}}
{{See also|Accounting ethics}}
The year 2001 witnessed a series of financial information frauds involving [[Enron]], auditing firm [[Arthur Andersen]], the telecommunications company [[WorldCom]], [[Qwest]] and [[Jarden|Sunbeam]], among other well-known corporations. These problems highlighted the need to review the effectiveness of [[Standard accounting practice|accounting standards]], auditing regulations and [[corporate governance]] principles. In some cases, management manipulated the figures shown in financial reports to indicate a better economic performance. In others, tax and regulatory incentives encouraged over-leveraging of companies and decisions to bear extraordinary and unjustified risk.<ref name="mba.ufm.edu.gt">Astrid Ayala and Giancarlo Ibárgüen Snr.: "A Market Proposal for Auditing the Financial Statements of Public Companies" (Journal of Management of Value, [[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]], March 2006) p. 41, [http://www.webcitation.org/5liW7XCb0 UFM.edu.gt]</ref>

The [[Enron scandal]] deeply influenced the development of new regulations to improve the reliability of financial reporting, and increased public awareness about the importance of having accounting standards that show the financial reality of companies and the objectivity and independence of auditing firms.<ref name="mba.ufm.edu.gt"/>

In addition to being the largest bankruptcy reorganization in American history, the [[Enron scandal]] undoubtedly is the biggest audit failure.<ref>Bratton, William W. "Enron and the Dark Side of Shareholder Value" ([[Tulane Law Review]], New Orleans, May 2002) p. 61</ref> It involved a financial scandal of [[Enron|Enron Corporation]] and their auditors [[Arthur Andersen]], which was revealed in late 2001. The scandal caused the dissolution of [[Arthur Andersen]], which at the time was one of the five largest accounting firms in the world.  After a series of revelations involving irregular accounting procedures conducted throughout the 1990s, Enron filed for [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection in December 2001.<ref>{{cite news | title = Enron files for bankruptcy | publisher = BBC News | date = 2001-12-03 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1688550.stm | accessdate = 2008-03-15}}</ref>

One consequence of these events was the passage of [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]] in the [[United States]] 2002, as a result of the first admissions of fraudulent behavior made by Enron. The act significantly raises criminal penalties for [[securities fraud]], for destroying, altering or fabricating records in federal investigations or any scheme or attempt to defraud shareholders.<ref>Aiyesha Dey, and Thomas Z. Lys: "Trends in Earnings Management and Informativeness of Earnings Announcements in the Pre- and Post-Sarbanes Oxley Periods ([[Kellogg School of Management]], Evanston, Illinois, February, 2005) p. 5</ref>
