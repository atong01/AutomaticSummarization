It originated from the<space/><link><target>nationalization</target><part>nationalised</part></link><space/><bold>British Steel Corporation</bold><space/>(<bold>BSC</bold>), formed in 1967 which was privatised to a public limited company, British Steel plc in 1988.

Entrepreneurship was lacking in the 1940s; the government could not persuade the industry to upgrade its plants. For generations the industry had followed a piecemeal growth pattern that proved inefficient in the face of world competition. The<space/><link><target>Labour Party (UK)</target><part>Labour Party</part></link><space/>came to power in 1945 committed to socialism. In 1946 it put the first steel development plan into practice with the aim of increasing capacity. It passed the<space/><link><target>Iron and Steel Act 1949</target></link><space/>which meant nationalisation of the industry as the government bought out the shareholders, and created the<space/><link><target>Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain</target></link>. American<space/><link><target>Marshall Plan</target></link><space/>aid in 194850 reinforced modernisation efforts and provided funding for them. However the nationalisation was reversed by the<space/><link><target>Conservative Party (UK)</target><part>Conservative</part></link><space/>government after 1952.</paragraph><paragraph>The industry was again nationalised in 1967 under another Labour government, becoming British Steel Corporation (BSC). But by then twenty years of political manipulation had left companies such as British Steel with serious problems: a complacency with existing equipment, plants operating below full capacity (hence with low efficiency), poor-quality assets, outdated technology, government price controls, higher coal and oil costs, lack of funds for capital improvement, and increasing competition in the world market.</paragraph><paragraph>By the 1970s the Labour government's main goal for the declining industry was to keep employment high. Since British Steel was a major employer in depressed regions, it was decided to keep many mills and facilities operating at a loss. In the 1980s Conservative Prime Minister<space/><link><target>Margaret Thatcher</target></link><space/>re-privatised BSC as British Steel. Under private control the company dramatically cut its work force and underwent a radical reorganisation and massive capital investment to again become competitive in the world marketplace.<extension extension_name='ref'>Alasdair M.

By the 1970s the government adopted a policy of keeping employment artificially high in the declining industry. This especially impacted BSC since it was a major employer in a number of depressed regions.<extension extension_name='ref'>Alasdair M. Blair, &quot;The British iron and steel industry since 1945,&quot; Journal of European Economic History Winter 1997, Vol. 26 Issue 3, pp 571-81</extension></paragraph><paragraph>One of the arguments aired in favour of nationalisation was that it would enable steel production to be rationalised. This involved concentrating investment on major integrated plants, placed near the coast for ease of access by sea, and closing older, smaller plants, especially those that had been located inland for proximity to coal supplies.</paragraph><paragraph>From the mid-1970s the (now loss-making) British Steel pursued a strategy of concentrating steelmaking in five areas: South Wales,<space/><link><target>South Yorkshire</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Scunthorpe</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Teesside</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Scotland</target></link>. This policy continued following the Conservative victory in the<space/><link><target>United Kingdom general election, 1979</target><part>1979 general election</part></link>. Other traditional steelmaking areas faced cutbacks. Under the Labour government of<space/><link><target>James Callaghan</target></link>, a review by Lord Beswick had led to the reprieve of the so-called 'Beswick plants', for social reasons, but subsequent governments were obliged under EU rules to withdraw subsidies.
