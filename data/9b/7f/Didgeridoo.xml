This shape means that its resonances occur at frequencies that are not harmonically spaced in frequency. This contrasts with the<space/><link><target>harmonic</target></link><space/>spacing of the resonances in a cylindrical plastic pipe, whose resonant frequencies fall in the ratio 1:3:5 etc. The second resonance of a didgeridoo (the note sounded by overblowing) is usually around an<space/><link><target>eleventh</target><part>11th</part></link><space/>higher than the fundamental frequency (a frequency ratio somewhat less than 3:1).</paragraph><paragraph>The vibration produced by the player's lips has harmonics, i.e., it has frequency components falling exactly in the ratio 1:2:3 etc. However, the non-harmonic spacing of the instrument's resonances means that the harmonics of the fundamental note are not systematically assisted by instrument resonances, as is usually the case for Western wind instruments (e.g., in a<space/><link><target>clarinet</target></link>, the 1st 3rd and 5th harmonics of the reed are assisted by resonances of the bore, at least for notes in the low range).</paragraph><paragraph>Sufficiently strong resonances of the vocal tract can strongly influence the<space/><link><target>timbre</target></link><space/>of the instrument.At some frequencies, whose values depend on the position of the player's tongue, resonances of the vocal tract inhibit the oscillatory flow of air into the instrument.Bands of frequencies that are not thus inhibited produce<space/><link><target>formants</target></link><space/>in the output sound.These formants, and especially their variation during the inhalation and exhalation phases of circular breathing, give the instrument its readily recognizable sound.</paragraph><paragraph>Other variations in the didgeridoo's sound can be made by adding vocalizations to the drone. Most of the vocalizations are related to sounds emitted by Australian animals, such as the<space/><link><target>dingo</target></link><space/>or the<space/><link><target>kookaburra</target></link>. To produce these sounds, the players simply have to use their vocal folds to produce the sounds of the animals whilst continuing to blow air through the instrument. The results range from very high-pitched sounds to much lower guttural vibrations. Adding vocalizations increases the complexity of the playing.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Cultural significance</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Australia Aboriginal Culture 009.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>upright</part><part>An Indigenous Australian man playing a didgeridoo</part></link><link><target>File:Reticulated Didjeridoo 2015.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>upright</part><part>Musician playing a Travel or Reticulated Didgeridoo</part></link>Traditionally and originally, the didgeridoo was primarily played as an accompaniment to ceremonial dancing and singing.

The belief that women are prohibited from playing is widespread among non-Aboriginal people and is also common among Aboriginal communities in Southern Australia; some ethnomusicologists believe that the dissemination of the<space/><italics>Taboo</italics><space/>belief and other misconceptions is a result of commercial agendas and marketing. Tourists generally rely on shop employees for information when purchasing a didgeridoo. Additionally, the majority of commercial didgeridoo recordings available are distributed by multinational recording companies and feature non-Aboriginals playing a<space/><link><target>New Age</target></link><space/>style of music with<space/><link><target>liner notes</target></link><space/>promoting the instrument's spirituality which misleads consumers about the didgeridoo's secular role in traditional Aboriginal culture.<extension extension_name='ref' name="PBP"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The Taboo belief is particularly strong among many Indigenous groups in the South East of Australia, where it is forbidden and considered &quot;cultural theft&quot; for non-Indigenous women, and especially performers of<space/><italics>New Age</italics><space/>music regardless of gender, to play or even touch a didgeridoo.<extension extension_name='ref' name="PBP"></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>In popular culture</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Day 3 Occupy Wall Street 2011 Shankbone 17.JPG</target><part>thumb</part><part>A protester at<space/><link><target>Occupy Wall Street</target></link><space/>playing the instrument, September 2011</part></link><space/><link><target>File:Occupy Eugene and the Didgeridoo (Eugene, Oregon).ogv</target><part>thumb</part><part>The instrument at Occupy Eugene</part></link>The didgeridoo also became a role playing instrument in the experimental and avant-garde music scene.
