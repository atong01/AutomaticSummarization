'''''Asteroids''''' is an arcade space shooter released in November 1979<ref name="atari_production99">{{cite web|title=Production Numbers|url=http://www.atarigames.com/atarinumbers90s.pdf|publisher=[[Atari]]|accessdate=March 19, 2012|year=1999}}</ref> by Atari, Inc. and designed by Lyle Rains, Ed Logg, and Dominic Walsh. The player controls a spaceship in an [[asteroid]] field which is periodically traversed by [[flying saucer]]s. The object of the game is to shoot and destroy asteroids and saucers while not colliding with either or being hit by the saucers' counter-fire. The game becomes harder as the number of asteroids increases.

''Asteroids'' was conceived during a meeting between Logg and Rains and used hardware developed by Howard Delman previously used for ''[[Lunar Lander (arcade game)|Lunar Lander]]''. Based on an unfinished game titled ''Cosmos'' and inspired by ''[[Spacewar (video game)|Spacewar!]]'' and ''[[Computer Space]]'', both early shoot 'em up video games, ''Asteroids''{{'}} physics model and control scheme were derived by Logg from these earlier games and refined through trial and error.  The game is rendered on a [[vector display]] in a two-dimensional view that wraps around in both screen axes.

Acclaimed by players and video game critics for its vector graphics, controls, and addictive gameplay, ''Asteroids'' was one of the first major hits of the [[Golden age of video arcade games|golden age of arcade games]]. The game sold over 70,000 [[Video game arcade cabinet|arcade cabinets]] and proved both popular with players and influential with developers. It has since been ported to multiple platforms. ''Asteroids'' was widely imitated and directly influenced two popular and often cloned arcade games, ''[[Defender (video game)|Defender]]''<ref name="RG-55">{{cite journal| journal = [[Retro Gamer]]| publisher = [[Imagine Publishing]]| title = The Making of Defender| issue = 55| pages = 34–39|date=October 2008}}</ref> and ''[[Gravitar]]'', as well as many other video games.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Asteroi1.png|thumb|left|A ship is surrounded by asteroids and a saucer.]]
The objective of ''Asteroids'' is to destroy asteroids and saucers. The player controls a triangular [[spacecraft|ship]] that can rotate left and right, fire shots straight forward, and thrust forward.<ref name="WiredEdLogg">{{cite web |url=http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2011/11/ed-logg-pioneer-award/ |author=Chris Kohler |title=Asteroids Designer Ed Logg Honored With Pioneer Award |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications]] |date=November 17, 2011 |accessdate=December 28, 2013}}</ref> Once the ship begins moving in a direction, it will continue in that direction for a time without player intervention unless the player applies thrust in a different direction.  The ship eventually comes to a stop when not thrusting. The player can also send the ship into [[hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]], causing it to disappear and reappear in a random location on the screen, at the risk of self-destructing or appearing on top of an asteroid.<ref name="RetroGamerAsteroids">{{cite journal |journal=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=86 |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |year=2009 |url=http://www.rawbw.com/~delman/pdf/making_of_Asteroids.pdf |title=The Making of Asteroids |accessdate=December 18, 2013| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Each level starts with a few large asteroids drifting in various directions on the screen. Objects [[Wraparound (video games)|wrap around screen edges]] – for instance, an asteroid that drifts off the top edge of the screen reappears at the bottom and continues moving in the same direction.<ref name="RulesOfPlay">{{cite book |last1=Salen |first1=Katie |last2=Zimmerman |first2=Eric |title=Rules of Play: Game Design Fundamentals |publisher=MIT Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-262-24045-9 |lastauthoramp=y}}</ref> As the player shoots asteroids, they break into smaller asteroids that move faster and are more difficult to hit. Smaller asteroids are also worth more points. Two flying saucers appear periodically on the screen; the "big saucer" shoots randomly and poorly, while the "small saucer" fires frequently at the ship. After reaching a score of 40,000, only the small saucer appears. As the player's score increases, the angle range of the shots from the small saucer diminishes until the saucer fires extremely accurately.<ref name="EdgeAsteroids">{{cite journal |url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-asteroids/ |journal=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |issue=117 |title=The Making of Asteroids |author="Edge Staff" |publisher=[[Future plc]] |accessdate= January 4, 2014}}</ref> Once the screen has been cleared of all asteroids and flying saucers, a new set of large asteroids appears, thus starting the next level. The game gets harder as the number of asteroids increases until after the score reaches a range between 40,000 and 60,000.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bjork |first1=Staffan |last2=Holopainen |first2=Jussi |title=Patterns in Game Design |publisher=Charles River Media |year=2005 |pages=60 |isbn=1-58450-354-8 |lastauthoramp=y}}</ref> The player starts with 3 lives after a coin is inserted and gains an extra life every 10,000 points.<ref name="EsquireAsteroids">{{Cite journal | url=http://www.gamearchive.com/General/Articles/ClassicNews/1981/Esquire2-81-pg62.htm  | journal=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] | volume=2 | issue=81 | title=Invasion of the Asteroids | author=David Owen | publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080622053948/http://www.gamearchive.com/General/Articles/ClassicNews/1981/Esquire2-81-pg62.htm |archivedate = August 1, 2008}}</ref> When the player loses all his lives, the game ends.

Like many games of its time, ''Asteroids'' contains several [[Software bug|bugs]]. The game slows down as the player gains 50-100 lives, due to a programming error in that there is no limit for the permitted number of lives. The player can "lose" the game after more than 250 lives are collected.<ref name="EdgeAsteroids"/>
<!-- HIDDEN BECAUSE OF LACK OF RELIABLE SOURCE: On some early versions of the game, it was also possible to hide the ship in the score area indefinitely without being hit by asteroids.<ref>[http://www.atari800xl.org/asteroids/ Atari 800XL]</ref> -->

==Development and design==
''Asteroids'' was conceived by Lyle Rains and programmed by Ed Logg with collaborations from other Atari staff.<ref name="allgame">{{Cite web | url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=15438 | work=allgame | publisher=Macrovision | title=Asteroids | author=Brett Alan Weiss | accessdate=June 6, 2009 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308030532/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=15438 | archivedate=March 8, 2009}}</ref> Logg was impressed with the [[Atari 2600]] (then known as "Atari Video Computer System") and joined Atari's coin-op division and worked on ''Dirt Bike'', which was never released due to an unsuccessful field test. He developed ''[[Super Breakout]]'' after hearing that [[Nolan Bushnell]], founder of Atari, wanted ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]'' updated.<ref name="WiredEdLogg"/> Paul Mancuso joined the development team as ''Asteroids''{{'}} technician and engineer Howard Delman contributed to the hardware.<ref name="EdgeAsteroids"/> During a meeting in April 1979, Rains discussed ''Planet Grab'', a multiplayer arcade game later renamed to ''Cosmos''. Logg did not know the name of the game, thinking ''Computer Space'' as "the inspiration for the two-dimensional approach."<ref name="RetroGamerAsteroids"/> The unfinished game featured a giant, indestructible asteroid,<ref name="RetroGamerAsteroids"/> so Rains asked Logg: "Well, why don’t we have a game where you shoot the rocks and blow them up?" In response, Logg described a similar concept where the player selectively shoots at rocks that break into smaller pieces.<ref name="ClassicGamingAsteroids">{{cite web |url=http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=GameMuseum.Detail&id=25 |title=Asteroids |author=William Cassidy |work=ClassicGaming |publisher=IGN |accessdate=January 6, 2014}}</ref> Both agreed on the concept.<ref name="RetroGamerAsteroids"/>

''Asteroids'' was implemented on hardware developed by Delman and is a [[vector game]], in which the graphics are composed of lines drawn on a vector monitor.<ref name="allgame"/> Rains initially wanted the game done in [[raster graphics]], but Logg, experienced in [[vector graphics]], suggested an XY monitor because the high image quality would permit precise aiming.<ref name="RetroGamerAsteroids"/><ref name="EdgeAsteroids"/> The hardware is chiefly a [[MOS 6502]] executing the game program,<ref name="RacingTheBeam">{{cite book |last1=Monfort |first1=Nick |last2=Bogost |first2=Ian |title=[[Racing the Beam]] |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-234-56789-7 |lastauthoramp=y}}</ref> and QuadraScan, a high-resolution vector graphics processor developed by Atari and referred to as an "XY display system" and the "Digital Vector Generator (DVG)".<ref name="WiredEdLogg"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Dillion |first=Roberto |title=The Golden Age of Video Games: The Birth of a Multibillion Dollar Industry |publisher=CRC Press |year=2011 |pages=58 |chapter=Part 1: Games That Pushed Boundaries |isbn=978-1-4398-7323-6 |lastauthoramp=y}}</ref><ref name="asteroidsflyer">Asteroids Flyer, 1979, Atari, Inc.</ref>

The original design concepts for QuadraScan came out of Cyan Engineering, Atari's off-campus research lab in [[Grass Valley, California]], in 1978. Cyan gave it to Delman, who finished the design and first used it for ''Lunar Lander''. Logg received Delman's modified board with five buttons, 13 sound effects, and additional RAM, and used it to develop ''Asteroids''. The size of the board was 4 by 4 inches, and it was "linked up" to a monitor.<ref name="WiredEdLogg"/><ref name="RetroGamerAsteroids"/>

Logg modeled the player's ship, the five-button control scheme, and the game physics after ''Spacewar!'', which he had played as a student at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], but made several changes to improve playability. The ship was programmed into the hardware and rendered by the monitor, and was configured to move with thrust and inertia.<ref name="WiredEdLogg"/><ref name="RetroGamerAsteroids"/><ref name="RulesOfPlay"/> The hyperspace button was not placed near Logg's right thumb, which he was dissatisfied, as he had a problem "tak[ing] his hand off the thrust button."<ref name="RetroGamerAsteroids"/> Drawings of asteroids in various shapes were incorporated into the game.<ref name="EdgeAsteroids"/> Logg copied the idea of a high score table with initials from Exidy's ''[[Star Fire]]''.<ref name="RetroGamerAsteroids"/>

The two saucers were formulated to be different from each other. A steadily decreasing timer that shortens intervals between saucer attacks was employed to keep the player from not shooting asteroids and saucers.<ref name="RetroGamerAsteroids"/> The minimalist soundtrack features a "heartbeat" sound effect, which quickens as the game progresses.<ref name="AtariIncBIF">{{Cite book |last1=Vendel |first1=Curt |last2=Goldberg |first2=Marty |title=Atari Inc.: Business Is Fun |publisher=Syzygy Company Press |date=November 2012 |origyear=1st. Pub. 2012|pages=515 |chapter=Chapter 8 |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=3FwGMtRafrAC&pg=PA515&lpg=PA515&dq=asteroids+heartbeat&source=bl&ots=1ktsZlYpr8&sig=udnFPBGubIGNEw6RweES7c7ru_A&hl=en&sa=X&ei=TRu6Uu6oIs2JogTkh4KwDA&ved=0CFoQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=asteroids%20heartbeat&f=false |lastauthoramp=y}}</ref> The game did not have a sound chip, so Delman created a hardware circuit for 13 sound effects by hand which was wired onto the board.<ref name="RetroGamerAsteroids"/>

A prototype of ''Asteroids'' was well received by several Atari staff and engineers, who would "wander between labs, passing comment and 
stopping to play as they went." Logg was often asked when he would be leaving by employees eager to play the prototype, so he created a second prototype specifically for staff to play.<ref name="RetroGamerAsteroids"/><ref name="ClassicGamingAsteroids"/> Atari went to Sacramento, California for testing, setting up prototypes of the game in local arcades to measure its potential success. The company also observed veteran players and younger players during focus group sessions at Atari itself. A group of old players familiar with ''Spacewar!'' struggled to maintain grip on the thrust button and requested a joystick, whereas younger players accustomed to ''[[Space Invaders]]'' noted they get no break in the game. Logg and other Atari engineers observed proceedings and documented comments in four pages.<ref name="RetroGamerAsteroids"/>
<!-- HIDDEN BECAUSE OF NO EASY RELIABLE SOURCE: ''Asteroids'' uses only 6 [[kilobyte|KB]] of [[Read-only memory|ROM]] code. Another 2 KB of vector ROM contains the descriptions of the main graphical elements (rocks, saucer, player's ship, explosion pictures, letters, and digits) in the form of DVG commands. For each picture frame, the 6502 writes graphics commands for the DVG into a defined area of [[RAM]] (the vector RAM), and then asks the DVG to draw the corresponding vector image on the screen. The DVG reads the commands and generates appropriate signals for the vector monitor. There are DVG commands for positioning the cathode ray, for drawing a line to a specified destination, calling a subroutine with further commands, and so on.  It features various sound effects, each of which is implemented by its own circuitry. There are seven distinct audio circuits designed by Delman. The CPU activates these audio circuits (and other hardware components) by writing to special memory addresses (memory mapped ports). The inputs from the player's controls (buttons) are also mapped into the CPU [[address space]]. -->

==Reception and legacy==
''Asteroids'' was immediately successful upon release. It displaced ''Space Invaders'' by popularity in the United States and became Atari's best selling arcade game of all time, with over 70,000 units sold.<ref name="allgame"/><ref name="VGExplosion">{{cite book|last=Wolf|first=Mark J.P.|title=The video game explosion: A history from Pong to Playstation and beyond|year=2008|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=0-313-33868-X}}</ref> Atari earned an estimated $150 million in sales from the game, and arcade operators earned a further $500 million from coin drops.<ref name="RetroGamerAsteroids"/> Atari had been in the process of manufacturing another vector game, ''Lunar Lander'', but demand for ''Asteroids'' was so high "that several hundred ''Asteroids'' games were shipped in ''Lunar Lander'' cabinets."<ref>

The saucer in the original game design was supposed to take a shot as soon as it appeared. This action was altered so there would be a delay before the saucer shoots, leading to "lurking" from players.<ref name="EdgeAsteroids"/> Lurking is a strategy in which the player uses thrust to keep the ship in motion, leaves 1 or 2 asteroids undamaged, and hunts for saucers, allowing the player to pick off as many 1,000-point UFOs as possible and play indefinitely on a single credit. Since the saucer could only shoot directly at the player's position on the screen, the player could "hide" at the opposite end of the screen and shoot across the screen boundary, while remaining relatively safe.<ref name="EsquireAsteroids"/><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&dat=19820319&id=0IEmAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VAEGAAAAIBAJ&pg=2751,2833371 |newspaper=The Miami News |title=Beating the Video Games: Lurking on an Asteroid |author=Michael Blanchet |date=March 19, 1982 |accessdate=January 4, 2014}}</ref> Complaints from operators losing revenue due to lurking led to the creation of an [[EPROM]] restricting such chances.<ref name="EdgeAsteroids"/> Usage of the names of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' characters "Mr. Bill" and "Sluggo" to refer to the saucers in an ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' article about the game led to Logg receiving a [[cease and desist]] letter from a lawyer with the "Mr. Bill Trademark."<ref name="AtariIncBIF"/>

''Asteroids'' received positive reviews from video game critics and has been regarded as Logg's magnum opus.<ref name="Retro54"/> Brett Alan Weiss, writing for [[Allgame]], likened the monochrome vector graphics to minimalism and viewed its sound effects as memorable. Weiss found its overall design to be near-perfect and cites the intensity and controls as elements that make the game addicting.

The gameplay in ''Asteroids'' was imitated by many games that followed, mostly "''Asteroid'' clones".

The game's graphics were upgraded to 3D, with both the ship and asteroids receiving polygon models along static backgrounds, and it was supplemented with weapons and a multiplayer mode. IGN writer [[Matt Casamassina]] was pleased that the gameplay was faithful to the original but felt the minor additions and constant "repetition" was not enough to make the port "warrant a $50 purchase." He was disappointed about the lack of music and found the sound effects to be of poor quality.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/12/18/asteroids-hyper-64 | work=IGN | title=Asteroids Hyper 64 | author=Matt Casamassina | date=December 18, 1998 | accessdate=December 26, 2013 | publisher=Ziff Davis}}</ref>

In 2001, Infogrames released ''[[Atari Anniversary Edition]]'' for the Sega Dreamcast, PlayStation, and PC compatibles. Developed by [[Digital Eclipse]], it included emulated versions of Asteroids and other old Atari games. Jeff Gerstmann of [[GameSpot]] criticized the Dreamcast version for its limitations, such as the presentation of vector graphics on a low resolution television set, which obscures the copyright text in ''Asteroids''.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/atari-anniversary-edition/ | work=GameSpot | title=Asteroids Anniversary Edition | author=Jeff Gerstman | date=July 11, 2001 | accessdate=January 4, 2014 | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]}}</ref> The arcade and Atari 2600 versions of ''Asteroids'', along with ''Asteroids Deluxe'', were included in ''[[Atari Anthology]]'' for both [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[PlayStation 2]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_atarianthology_x | work=[[Eurogamer]] | title=Atari Anthology Review | author=Kristan Reed | date=January 26, 2005 | accessdate=January 8, 2014 | publisher=Gamer Network}}</ref>

Released on November 28, 2007, the Xbox Live Arcade port of ''Asteroids'' has revamped HD graphics along with an added intense "throttle monkey" mode.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2007/11/26/554786.aspx | work=Gamerscore Blog | title=Asteroids and Asteroids Deluxe on Xbox LIVE Arcade | author=Tom Eberspecher | date=November 26, 2007 | accessdate=June 7, 2009 | publisher=Microsoft Games Global Marketing team| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090602224018/http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2007/11/26/554786.aspx| archivedate= June 2, 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Both ''Asteroids'' in its arcade and 2600 versions and ''Asteroids Deluxe'' were ported to [[Microsoft]]{{'}}s ''[[Game Room]]'' download service in 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/features/2010/jan10/01-08xboxclassics.aspx|title=Classic Arcade Games Make a Comeback on Xbox|date=January 8, 2010|accessdate=January 8, 2014|publisher=Microsoft}}</ref> [[Glu Mobile]] released a mobile phone port of the game with supplementary features as well as the original arcade version.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/82811-asteroids-launches-game-for-mobiles |publisher=Pocket-lint Ltd.|work=Pocket-lint |title=Asteroids |author=Amy-Mae Elliott |date=September 4, 2007 |accessdate=January 3, 2014}}</ref>

''Asteroids'' was included on ''[[Atari Greatest Hits]] Volume 1'' for the [[Nintendo DS]]. Craig Harris, writing for IGN, noted that the Nintendo DS's small screen can not properly display details of games with vector graphics.<ref name='IGN review'>{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/11/09/atari-greatest-hits-volume-1-review | title = Atari Greatest Hits Volume 1 Review - IGN | accessdate = January 7, 2014 | author = Craig Harris | date = November 8, 2010 | work = IGN| publisher = Ziff Davis}}</ref>

Perhaps the most strangest port of Asteroids can be found inside another video game called ''[[Wizkid (video game)|Wizkid]]'' (released in [[1992]] for [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]] and [[IBM PC|PC]]). When a player reaches the end-of-game monster, instead of fighting against him, player has to beat his high-score in Asteroids.

==Highest score==
On November 13, 1982, 15-year-old [[Scott Safran]] of Cherry Hill, New Jersey, set a [[world record]] of 41,336,440 points on the arcade game ''Asteroids'', beating the 40,101,910 point score set by Leo Daniels of Carolina Beach on February 6, 1982. In 1998, to congratulate Safran on his accomplishment, the [[Twin Galaxies]] Intergalactic Scoreboard searched for him for four years until 2002, when it was discovered that he had died in an accident in 1989.<ref name="twin">{{Cite web | url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2008/11/dayintech_1113 | title=Nov. 13, 1982: Teen Sets Asteroids Record in 3-Day Marathon | publisher=Conde Nast Publications | work=Wired | date=November 13, 2008 | accessdate=June 7, 2009 | author=Chris Kohler}}</ref> In a ceremony in Philadelphia on April 27, 2002, Walter Day of Twin Galaxies presented an award to the surviving members of Safran's family, commemorating the Asteroid Champion's achievement.<ref name="SafranAsteroids2002Award">{{cite news | author=Chris Gray | title=After 20 years, master gamester finally honored | url=http://articles.philly.com/2002-04-28/news/25338220_1_samson-carpal-tunnel-syndrome-official-video-game | work=The Philadelphia Inquirer| date=April 28, 2002 | accessdate=January 8, 2014}}</ref> On April 6, 2010, John McAllister broke Safran's record with a high score of 41,338,740 in a 58-hour Internet livestream.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2010/04/asteroids-record/ | author=Chris Kohler |  title=Asteroids Player Smashes 27-Year-Old High Score | work=Wired | publisher=Condé Nast Publications | date=April 5, 2010 | accessdate=April 6, 2010 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100407043933/http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2010/04/asteroids-record/| archivedate= April 7, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Film adaptation===
In 2009, [[Universal Studios]] obtained the rights to adapt ''Asteroids'' into a film, with Matthew Lopez as the scriptwriter and [[Lorenzo di Bonaventura]] as the producer. Universal will create the story from scratch, as done with ''[[Battleship (film)|Battleship]]'', a film based on the [[Hasbro]] board game [[Battleship (game)|of the same name]].<ref>{{Cite web|author=Borys Kit |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/07/03/us-asteroids-idUSTRE56208N20090703 |title='Asteroids' lands at Universal |publisher=Reuters |date=July 2, 2009 |accessdate=July 2, 2009}}</ref>
