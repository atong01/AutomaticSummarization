{{Infobox aluminium}}
'''Aluminium''' (or '''aluminum'''; see {{Pslink|different endings}}) is a [[chemical element]] in the [[boron group]] with symbol&nbsp;'''Al''' and [[atomic number]]&nbsp;13. It is a silvery-white, soft, nonmagnetic, [[ductility|ductile]] [[metal]]. Aluminium is [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|the third most abundant element]] (after [[oxygen]] and [[silicon]]) in the [[Earth]]'s [[crust (geology)|crust]], and the [[element abundance|most abundant metal]] there. It makes up about 8% by mass of the crust, though it is less common in the mantle below. Aluminium metal is so chemically reactive that [[Native metal|native specimens]] are rare and limited to extreme [[Redox|reducing]] environments. Instead, it is found combined in over 270 different [[mineral]]s.<ref>

Aluminium is remarkable for the metal's low [[density]] and for its ability to resist [[corrosion]] due to the phenomenon of [[passivation (chemistry)|passivation]]. Structural components made from aluminium and its [[aluminium alloy|alloys]] are vital to the [[aerospace]] industry and are important in other areas of [[transport]]ation and structural materials, such as building facades and window frames.{{clarification needed|date=September 2015}} The most useful compounds of aluminium, at least on a weight basis, are the [[oxides]] and [[sulfates]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Despite its prevalence in the environment, no known form of life uses aluminium [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] [[metabolically]]. In keeping with its pervasiveness, aluminium is well tolerated by plants and animals.<ref name=Ullmann/> Owing to their prevalence, potential beneficial (or otherwise) biological roles of aluminium compounds are of continuing interest.

==Characteristics==

===Physical===
Aluminium is a relatively soft, durable, lightweight, [[ductility|ductile]] and [[malleable]] [[metal]] with appearance ranging from silvery to dull gray, depending on the surface roughness. It is nonmagnetic and does not easily ignite. A fresh film of aluminium serves as a good reflector (approximately 92%) of [[visible light]] and an excellent reflector (as much as 98%) of medium and far [[infrared]] radiation. The [[yield (engineering)|yield strength]] of pure aluminium is 7–11 [[Pascal (unit)|MPa]], while [[aluminium alloy]]s have yield strengths ranging from 200 MPa to 600 MPa.<ref name="polmear">

Aluminium is a good [[Heat conduction|thermal]] and [[electrical conductor]], having 59% the conductivity of copper, both thermal and electrical, while having only 30% of [[Copper|copper's]] density. Aluminium is capable of being a [[superconductor]], with a superconducting critical temperature of 1.2 [[kelvin]] and a critical magnetic field of about 100 [[gauss (unit)|gauss]] (10 [[millitesla]]s).<ref>

===Chemical===
[[Corrosion]] resistance can be excellent due to a thin surface layer of [[aluminium oxide]] that forms when the metal is exposed to air, effectively preventing further [[oxidation]].<ref name ="CorrAl">{{cite book | title=Corrosion of Aluminium|first=Christian |last=Vargel|date=2004|origyear=French edition published 1999|publisher=Elsevier|ISBN=0 08 044495 4|url = http://books.google.de/books?id=NAABS5KrVDYC&pg=PA81}}</ref> The strongest aluminium alloys are less corrosion resistant due to [[galvanic cell|galvanic]] reactions with alloyed [[copper]].<ref name="polmear" /> This corrosion resistance is also often greatly reduced by aqueous salts, particularly in the presence of dissimilar metals.

In highly acidic solutions aluminium reacts with water to form hydrogen, and in highly alkaline ones to form [[aluminates]]— protective passivation under these conditions is negligible. Also, [[chlorides]] such as common [[sodium chloride]] are well-known sources of corrosion of aluminium and are among the chief reasons that household plumbing is never made from this metal.<ref name="Beal1999">{{cite book|first=Roy E. |last= Beal|title=Engine Coolant Testing : Fourth Volume|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Askwi3lXdlcC&pg=PA90|date=1 January 1999|publisher=ASTM International|isbn=978-0-8031-2610-7|page=90}}</ref>

However, owing to its resistance to corrosion generally, aluminium is one of the few metals that retain silvery reflectance in finely powdered form, making it an important component of [[silver (color)|silver-colored]] paints. Aluminium mirror finish has the highest [[reflectance]] of any metal in the 200–400&nbsp;nm ([[ultraviolet|UV]]) and the 3,000–10,000&nbsp;nm (far [[infrared|IR]]) regions; in the 400–700&nbsp;nm visible range it is slightly outperformed by [[tin]] and [[silver]] and in the 700–3000 (near IR) by [[silver]], [[gold]], and [[copper]].<ref>

Aluminium is [[oxidized]] by [[water]] at temperatures below 280&nbsp;°C to produce [[hydrogen]], [[aluminium hydroxide]] and heat:
:2 Al + 6 H<sub>2</sub>O → 2 Al(OH)<sub>3</sub> + 3 H<sub>2</sub>
This conversion is of interest for the production of hydrogen. Challenges include circumventing the formed oxide layer, which inhibits the reaction, and the expenses associated with the storage of energy by regeneration of the Al metal.<ref>{{cite web|date=1 January 2008|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/aluminium_water_hydrogen.pdf| title=Reaction of Aluminum with Water to Produce Hydrogen| publisher=U.S. Department of Energy}}</ref>

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of aluminium}}
Aluminium has many known [[isotope]]s, whose mass numbers range from 21 to 42; however, only <sup>27</sup>Al ([[stable isotope]]) and <sup>26</sup>Al ([[radioactive decay|radioactive]] isotope, [[half-life|t<sub>1⁄2</sub>]]&nbsp;= 7.2×10<sup>5</sup> [[year|y]]) occur naturally. <sup>27</sup>Al has a natural abundance above 99.9%. <sup>26</sup>Al is produced from [[argon]] in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] by [[spallation]] caused by [[cosmic-ray]] [[proton]]s. Aluminium isotopes have found practical application in dating [[ocean|marine]] sediments, manganese nodules, glacial ice, [[quartz]] in [[rock (geology)|rock]] exposures, and [[meteorite]]s. The ratio of <sup>26</sup>Al to <sup>10</sup>[[beryllium|Be]] has been used to study the role of transport, deposition, [[sediment]] storage, burial times, and erosion on 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> year time scales.<ref>

Meteoroid fragments, after departure from their parent bodies, are exposed to intense cosmic-ray bombardment during their travel through space, causing substantial <sup>26</sup>Al production. After falling to Earth, atmospheric shielding drastically reduces <sup>26</sup>Al production, and its decay can then be used to determine the meteorite's terrestrial age. Meteorite research has also shown that <sup>26</sup>Al was relatively abundant at the time of formation of our planetary system. Most meteorite scientists believe that the energy released by the decay of <sup>26</sup>Al was responsible for the melting and [[planetary differentiation|differentiation]] of some [[asteroids]] after their formation 4.55 billion years ago.<ref>

In the [[Earth's crust]], aluminium is the most abundant (8.3% by mass) metallic element and the third most abundant of all elements (after oxygen and silicon).<ref name=Greenwood1997>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd|page=217}}</ref> The Earth's crust has a higher prevalence of aluminium than the rest of the planet, due to aluminium silicates in the crust. In the Earths [[mantle (geology)|mantle]], which is only 2% aluminium by mass, these aluminium silicate minerals are largely replaced by [[silica]] and magnesium oxides. Overall, the Earth is about 1.4% aluminium by mass (eighth in abundance by mass). In the Earth as a whole, aluminium gains in abundance as compared with the Solar system and Universe, due to Earth's loss of a number of elements which are common in the universe, but which are volatiles at the Earth's distance from the Sun (hydrogen, helium, neon, nitrogen, carbon as hydrocarbon).

Because of its strong affinity to oxygen, aluminium is almost never found in the elemental state; instead it is found in oxides or silicates. [[Feldspar]]s, the most common group of minerals in the Earth's crust, are aluminosilicates. Native aluminium metal can only be found as a minor phase in low oxygen [[fugacity]] environments, such as the interiors of certain volcanoes.<ref>

Although aluminium is an extremely common and widespread element, the common aluminium minerals are not economic sources of the metal. Almost all metallic aluminium is produced from the [[ore]] bauxite (AlO<sub>''x''</sub>(OH)<sub>3–2''x''</sub>). Bauxite occurs as a [[weathering]] product of low iron and silica bedrock in tropical climatic conditions.<ref>

==Production and refinement==
{{See also|Category:Aluminium minerals|List of countries by aluminium production}}
[[File:Bauxite hérault.JPG|thumb|right|Bauxite, a major aluminium ore. The red-brown color is due to the presence of [[iron]] minerals.]]

Bauxite is converted to aluminium oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) via the [[Bayer process]].<ref name=Ullmann/> Relevant [[chemical equation]]s are:
:Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 2 NaOH  →  2 NaAlO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O 
:2 H<sub>2</sub>O + NaAlO<sub>2</sub> → Al(OH)<sub>3</sub> + NaOH
The intermediate sodium aluminate, given the simplified formula NaAlO<sub>2</sub>, is soluble in strongly alkaline water, and the other components of the ore are not. Depending on the quality of the bauxite ore, twice as much waste ("[[red mud]]") as alumina is generated.

The conversion of alumina to aluminium metal is achieved by the [[Hall-Héroult process]]. In this energy-intensive process, a solution of alumina in a molten ({{convert|950|and|980|C|F}}) mixture of [[cryolite]] (Na<sub>3</sub>AlF<sub>6</sub>) with [[calcium fluoride]] is [[electrolysis|electrolyzed]] to give the metal:
: Al<sup>3+</sup> + 3 e<sup>−</sup> →  Al(l)
At the [[anode]], oxygen is formed:
: 2 O<sup>2−</sup> + C → CO<sub>2</sub>(g) + 4 e<sup>−</sup>
The liquid aluminium metal then sinks to the bottom of the solution and is tapped off, usually cast into large blocks called [[Bar stock|aluminium billets]] for further processing. The carbon anode is consumed by  reaction with oxide to form carbon dioxide gas. A small quantity of [[fluoride]] compounds flow with this gas. In modern smelters, this hot carbon dioxide gas is filtered through alumina to remove fluorine compounds and return [[fluorine]] as aluminium fluoride to the [[electrolytic]] cells.  The anodes in a reduction cell must therefore be replaced regularly, since they are consumed in the process. The cathodes do erode, mainly due to electrochemical processes and liquid metal movement [[Electromagnetic induction |induced]] by intense electrolytic currents. After five to ten years, depending on the current used in the electrolysis, a cell must be rebuilt because of cathode wear.

[[File:Aluminium - world production trend.svg|thumb|lang=en|World production trend of aluminium]]

Aluminium electrolysis with the [[Hall-Héroult]] process consumes a lot of energy. The worldwide average specific energy consumption is approximately 15±0.5 [[kilowatt-hour]]s per kilogram of aluminium produced (52 to 56 [[megajoule|MJ]]/kg). The most modern smelters achieve approximately 12.8&nbsp;kW·h/kg (46.1 MJ/kg). (Compare this to the [[heat of reaction]], 31 MJ/kg, and the [[Gibbs free energy]] of reaction, 29 MJ/kg.) Reduction line currents for older technologies are typically 100 to 200 [[kiloampere]]s; state-of-the-art smelters operate at about 350 kA. Trials have been reported with 500 kA cells.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The Hall-Heroult process produces aluminium with a purity of above 99%. Further purification can be done by the [[Hoopes process]]. The process involves the electrolysis of molten aluminium with a sodium, barium and aluminium fluoride electrolyte. The resulting aluminium has a purity of 99.99%.<ref name=Ullmann>

===Recycling===
[[File:41 ALU Recycling Code.svg|150px|thumb|Aluminium [[recycling code]]]]
{{Main|Aluminium recycling}}
Aluminium is theoretically 100% recyclable without any loss of its natural qualities. According to the [[International Resource Panel]]'s [[Metal Stocks in Society report]], the global [[per capita]] stock of aluminium in use in society (i.e. in cars, buildings, electronics etc.) is {{convert|80|kg|abbr=on}}. Much of this is in more-developed countries ({{convert|350|–|500|kg|abbr=on}} per capita) rather than less-developed countries ({{convert|35|kg|abbr=on}} per capita). Knowing the per capita stocks and their approximate lifespans is important for planning recycling.

Recovery of the metal via [[recycling]] has become an important use of the aluminium industry. Recycling was a low-profile activity until the late 1960s, when the growing use of aluminium [[beverage can]]s brought it to the public awareness.

Recycling involves melting the scrap, a process that requires only 5% of the energy used to produce aluminium from ore, though a significant part (up to 15% of the input material) is lost as [[dross]] (ash-like oxide).<ref>

Recycled aluminium is known as secondary aluminium, but maintains the same physical properties as primary aluminium. Secondary aluminium is produced in a wide range of formats and is employed in 80% of alloy injections. Another important use is for extrusion.

White dross from primary aluminium production and from secondary recycling operations still contains useful quantities of aluminium that can be extracted industrially.<ref>

==Compounds==
{{Category see also|Aluminium compounds}}

===Oxidation state +3===
The vast majority of compounds, including all Al-containing minerals and all commercially significant aluminium compounds, feature aluminium in the oxidation state 3+. The [[coordination number]] of such compounds varies, but generally Al<sup>3+</sup> is six-coordinate or tetracoordinate. Almost all compounds of aluminium(III) are colorless.<ref name=Greenwood1997/>

====Halides====
All four trihalides are well known. Unlike the structures of the three heavier trihalides, [[aluminium fluoride]] (AlF<sub>3</sub>) features six-coordinate Al. The octahedral coordination environment for AlF<sub>3</sub> is related to the compactness of [[fluoride]] ion, six of which can fit around the small Al<sup>3+</sup> center. AlF<sub>3</sub> sublimes (with cracking) at {{convert|1291|°C|0|abbr=on}}. With heavier halides, the coordination numbers are lower. The other trihalides are dimeric or polymeric with tetrahedral Al centers. These materials are prepared by treating aluminium metal with the halogen, although other methods exist. Acidification of the oxides or hydroxides affords hydrates. In aqueous solution, the halides often form mixtures, generally containing six-coordinate Al centers, which are feature both halide and [[metal aquo complex|aquo ligands]]. When aluminium and fluoride are together in aqueous solution, they readily form complex ions such as {{chem|[AlF(H|2|O)|5|]|2+}}, {{chem|AlF|3|(H|2|O)|3}}, and {{chem|[AlF|6|]|3-}}. In the case of chloride, polyaluminium clusters are formed such as [Al<sub>13</sub>O<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>24</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>12</sub>]<sup>7+</sup>.

====Oxide and hydroxides====
Aluminium forms one stable oxide, known by its mineral name [[corundum]]. [[Sapphire]] and [[ruby]] are impure corundum contaminated with trace amounts of other metals. The two oxide-hydroxides, AlO(OH), are [[boehmite]] and [[diaspore]]. There are three trihydroxides: [[bayerite]], [[gibbsite]], and [[nordstrandite]], which differ in their crystalline structure ([[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]]). Most are produced from ores by a variety of wet processes using acid and base. Heating the hydroxides leads to formation of corundum. These materials are of central importance to the production of aluminium and are themselves extremely useful.

====Carbide, nitride, and related materials====
[[Aluminium carbide]] (Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3</sub>) is made by heating a mixture of the elements above {{convert|1000|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The pale yellow crystals consist of tetrahedral aluminium centers. It reacts with water or dilute acids to give [[methane]]. The [[metal acetylide|acetylide]], Al<sub>2</sub>(C<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, is made by passing [[acetylene]] over heated aluminium.

[[Aluminium nitride]] (AlN) is the only nitride known for aluminium. Unlike the oxides it features tetrahedral Al centers. It can be made from the elements at {{convert|800|°C|0|abbr=on}}. It is air-stable material with a usefully high [[thermal conductivity]]. [[Aluminium phosphide]] (AlP) is made similarly, and hydrolyses to give [[phosphine]]:

: AlP + 3 H<sub>2</sub>O → Al(OH)<sub>3</sub> + PH<sub>3</sub>

===Organoaluminium compounds and related hydrides===
{{main|Organoaluminium compound}}
[[File:Trimethylaluminium-3D-balls.png|thumb|left|220px|Structure of [[trimethylaluminium]], a compound that features five-coordinate carbon.]]

}}</ref> These species usually feature tetrahedral Al centers, e.g. "[[trimethylaluminium]]" has the formula Al<sub>2</sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub> (see figure). With large organic groups, triorganoaluminium exist as three-coordinate monomers, such as [[triisobutylaluminium]]. Such compounds are widely used in industrial chemistry, despite the fact that they are often highly [[pyrophoric]]. Few analogues exist between organoaluminium and organoboron compounds except for large organic groups.

The important aluminium hydride is [[lithium aluminium hydride]] (LiAlH<sub>4</sub>), which is used in as a reducing agent in [[organic chemistry]]. It can be produced from [[lithium hydride]] and aluminium trichloride:

: 4 LiH + AlCl<sub>3</sub> → LiAlH<sub>4</sub> + 3 LiCl

Several useful derivatives of LiAlH<sub>4</sub> are known, e.g. [[Red-Al|sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)dihydridoaluminate]]. The simplest hydride, [[aluminium hydride]] or alane, remains a laboratory curiosity. It is a polymer with the formula (AlH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>''n''</sub>, in contrast to the corresponding boron hydride with the formula (BH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.

===Oxidation states +1 and +2===
Although the great majority of aluminium compounds feature Al<sup>3+</sup> centers, compounds with lower oxidation states are known and sometime of significance as precursors to the Al<sup>3+</sup> species.

====Aluminium(I)====
AlF, AlCl and AlBr exist in the gaseous phase when the trihalide is heated with aluminium. The composition AlI is unstable at room temperature with respect to the triiodide:<ref name=al1/>

: 3 AlI → AlI<sub>3</sub> + 2 Al

A stable derivative of aluminium monoiodide is the cyclic [[adduct]] formed with [[triethylamine]], Al<sub>4</sub>I<sub>4</sub>(NEt<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>. Also of theoretical interest but only of fleeting existence are Al<sub>2</sub>O and Al<sub>2</sub>S. Al<sub>2</sub>O is made by heating the normal oxide, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, with silicon at {{convert|1800|°C|0|abbr=on}} in a [[vacuum]].<ref name=al1>

Aluminium is usually alloyed – it is used as pure metal only when corrosion resistance and/or workability is more important than strength or hardness. Aluminium-based alloys abruptly increase their strength characteristics with small additions of scandium, as well as zirconium and hafnium.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Skachkov|first1=V.

===Aluminium compounds===
Because aluminium is abundant and most of its derivatives exhibit low toxicity, the compounds of aluminium enjoy wide and sometimes large-scale applications.

====Alumina====
{{main|Aluminium oxide}}
[[Aluminium oxide]] (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and the associated oxy-hydroxides and trihydroxides are produced or extracted from minerals on a large scale. The great majority of this material is converted to metallic aluminium. In 2013 about 10% of the domestic shipments in the United States were used for other applications.<ref name="myb2012">

}}</ref> A major use is as an absorbent. For example, alumina removes water from hydrocarbons, which enables subsequent processes that are poisoned by moisture. Aluminium oxides are common catalysts for industrial processes, e.g. the [[Claus process]] for converting [[hydrogen sulfide]] to sulfur in [[refineries]] and for the [[alkylation]] of [[amine]]s. Many industrial catalysts are [[catalyst support|"supported"]], meaning generally that an expensive catalyst (e.g., [[platinum]]) is dispersed over a high surface area material such as alumina. Being a very hard material ([[Mohs hardness]] 9), alumina is widely used as an abrasive and the production of applications that exploit its inertness, e.g., in [[high pressure sodium]] lamps.

====Sulfates====
Several sulfates of aluminium find applications. [[Aluminium sulfate]] (Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>·(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>18</sub>) is produced on the annual scale of several billions of kilograms. About half of the production is consumed in [[water treatment]]. The next major application is in the manufacture of paper. It is also used as a mordant, in [[fire extinguisher]]s, as a food additive ([[E number]] E173), in fireproofing, and in leather tanning. Aluminium ammonium sulfate, which is also called [[ammonium alum]], (NH<sub>4</sub>)Al(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·12H<sub>2</sub>O, is used as a [[mordant]] and in [[leather]] tanning.<ref name=Ullmann2>

====Chlorides====
[[Aluminium chloride]] (AlCl<sub>3</sub>) is used in [[petroleum]] [[refining]] and in the production of synthetic [[rubber]] and polymers. Although it has a similar name, [[aluminium chlorohydrate]] has fewer and very different applications, e.g. as a hardening agent and an [[antiperspirant]]. It is an intermediate in the production of aluminium metal.

====Niche compounds====
{{citations needed|date=September 2015}}
The many aluminium compounds with niche applications include [[aluminium acetate]], a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] used in solution as an [[astringent]], [[aluminium borate]] (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>·B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and [[aluminium fluorosilicate]] (Al<sub>2</sub>(SiF<sub>6</sub>)<sub>3</sub>) which are used in the production of [[glass]] and [[ceramic]]s and synthetic [[gemstone]]s and [[aluminium phosphate]] (AlPO<sub>4</sub>) used in the manufacture of glass, ceramic, [[Wood pulp|pulp]] and paper products, [[cosmetics]], paints and [[varnish]]es and in making dental [[cement]]. [[Aluminium hydroxide]] (Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>) is used as an [[antacid]], as a mordant, in [[water]] purification, in the manufacture of glass and ceramic and in the waterproofing of fabrics. [[Lithium aluminium hydride]] is a powerful reducing agent used in [[organic chemistry]]. [[Organoaluminium chemistry|Organoaluminiums]] are used as [[Lewis acid]]s and cocatalysts. For example, [[methylaluminoxane]] is a cocatalyst for [[Ziegler-Natta]] [[olefin]] [[polymerization]] to produce [[vinyl polymer]]s such as [[polyethene]]. Aqueous aluminium ions (such as found in aqueous aluminium sulfate) are used to treat against fish parasites such as ''[[Gyrodactylus salaris]]''. In many vaccines, certain aluminium salts serve as an immune [[Immunologic adjuvant|adjuvant]] (immune response booster) to allow the protein in the vaccine to achieve sufficient potency as an immune stimulant.

===Aluminium alloys in structural applications===
{{Main|Aluminium alloy}}
[[File:Aluminium foam.jpg|thumb|[[Aluminium foam]]]]
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
Aluminium alloys with a wide range of properties are used in engineering structures. Alloy systems are classified by a number system ([[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]]) or by names indicating their main alloying constituents ([[DIN]] and [[International Organization of Standardization|ISO]]).

The strength and durability of aluminium alloys vary widely, not only as a result of the components of the specific alloy, but also as a result of heat treatments and manufacturing processes. A lack of knowledge of these aspects has from time to time led to improperly designed structures and gained aluminium a bad reputation.

One important structural limitation of aluminium alloys is their [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] strength. Unlike steels, aluminium alloys have no well-defined [[fatigue limit]], meaning that fatigue failure eventually occurs, under even very small cyclic loadings. This implies that engineers must assess these loads and design for a [[Fatigue (material)#Design against fatigue|fixed life]] rather than an infinite life.

Another important property of aluminium alloys is their sensitivity to heat. Workshop procedures involving heating are complicated by the fact that aluminium, unlike steel, melts without first glowing red. Forming operations where a [[blow torch]] is used therefore require some expertise, since no visual signs reveal how close the material is to melting. Aluminium alloys, like all structural alloys, also are subject to internal stresses following heating operations such as welding and casting. The problem with aluminium alloys in this regard is their low [[melting point]], which make them more susceptible to distortions from thermally induced stress relief. Controlled stress relief can be done during manufacturing by heat-treating the parts in an oven, followed by gradual cooling—in effect [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] the stresses.

The low melting point of aluminium alloys has not precluded their use in rocketry; even for use in constructing combustion chambers where gases can reach 3500&nbsp;K. The [[RM-81 Agena|Agena]] upper stage engine used a regeneratively cooled aluminium design for some parts of the nozzle, including the thermally critical throat region.

Another alloy of some value is [[aluminium bronze]] (Cu-Al alloy).

==History==
[[File:Eros-piccadilly-circus.jpg|thumb|right|The statue of the [[Anteros]] in [[Piccadilly Circus]], London, was made in 1893 and is one of the first statues cast in aluminium.]]

Ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] used aluminium salts as dyeing mordants and as astringents for dressing wounds; [[alum]] is still used as a [[styptic]].
<!--
There is reason to believe that Romans stumbled on a technique to refine aluminum, but that the technique was lost. [[Pliny the Elder]] recounts in [[Natural History (Pliny)|Historia Naturalis]] the following tale, which has been interpreted<ref>
{{cite web
 |title=Aluminium in history
 |url=http://www.world-aluminium.org/?pg=13
 |publisher=[[International Aluminium Institute]]
 |accessdate=6 March 2012
}}</ref> as referring to aluminum:

<blockquote>
"One day a goldsmith in Rome was allowed to show the Emperor [[Tiberius]] a dinner plate of a new metal. The plate was very light, and almost as bright as silver. The goldsmith told the Emperor that he had made the metal from plain clay. He also assured the Emperor that only he, himself, and the Gods knew how to produce this metal from clay. The Emperor became very interested, and as a financial expert he was also a little concerned. The Emperor felt immediately, however, that all his treasures of gold and silver would decline in value if people started to produce this bright metal of clay. Therefore, instead of giving the goldsmith the regard expected, he ordered him to be beheaded."
</blockquote>
-->
In 1761, [[Guyton de Morveau]] suggested calling the base alum ''alumine.'' In 1808, [[Humphry Davy]] identified the existence of a metal base of alum, which he at first termed ''alumium'' and later ''aluminum'' (see [[#Etymology|etymology section]], below).

The metal was first produced in 1825 in an impure form by [[Denmark|Danish]] physicist and chemist [[Hans Christian Ørsted]]. He reacted [[anhydrous]] [[aluminium chloride]] with [[potassium]] [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]], yielding a lump of metal looking similar to tin.<ref name="woehler">

He conducted a similar experiment in 1827 by mixing anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium and yielded aluminium.<ref name="woehler"/> Wöhler is generally credited with isolating aluminium ([[Latin]] ''alumen'', alum). Further, [[Pierre Berthier]] discovered aluminium in bauxite ore. [[Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville]] improved Wöhler's method in 1846. As described in his 1859 book, aluminium trichloride could be reduced by sodium, which was more convenient and less expensive than potassium used by Wöhler.<ref>

By 1895, the metal was being used as a building material as far away as [[Sydney]], Australia in the dome of the [[Chief Secretary's Building]].

With the explosive expansion of the airplane industry during World War I (1914-1917), major governments demanded large shipments of aluminium for light, strong airframes. They often subsidized factories and the necessary electrical supply systems.<ref>Mats Ingulstad, "‘We Want Aluminum, No Excuses’: Business-Government Relations in the American Aluminum Industry, 1917–1957," in ''From Warfare to Welfare: Business-Government Relations in the Aluminium Industry,'' ed. Mats Ingulstad and Hans Otto Frøland, 33–68. (Oslo: Tapir Academic Press, 2012.)</ref>

Many navies have used an aluminium [[superstructure]] for their vessels; the 1975 fire aboard [[USS Belknap (CG-26)|USS ''Belknap'']] that gutted her aluminium superstructure, as well as observation of battle damage to British ships during the [[Falklands War]], led to many navies switching to all [[steel]] superstructures.

[[Aluminium wire]] was once widely used for domestic electrical wiring (feeders and branch circuits). Owing to "[[Creep (deformation)|creep]]" and corrosion-induced failures, a number of fires resulted. However, aluminum is still employed for services, where special terminations are provided.

==Etymology==

The various names all derive from its status as a base of [[alum]]. It is [[Loanword|borrowed]] from [[Old French]]; its ultimate source, ''alumen'', in turn is a [[Latin]] word that literally means "bitter salt".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Alum&searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=3 May 2010}}</ref>

Two variants of the metal's name are in current use, ''aluminium'' ({{IPAc-en|pron|ˌ|æ|l|j|ʊ|ˈ|m|ɪ|n|i|ə|m|}}) and ''aluminum'' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|l|uː|m|ɪ|n|ə|m}})—besides the obsolete ''alumium''. The [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) adopted ''aluminium'' as the standard international name for the element in 1990 but, three years later, recognized ''aluminum'' as an acceptable variant. Hence their periodic table includes both.<ref>[http://www.iupac.org/highlights/periodic-table-of-the-elements.html IUPAC Periodic Table of the Elements]. iupac.org</ref> IUPAC internal publications use either spelling in nearly the same number.<ref>[http://www.google.com/search?q=aluminum&sitesearch=iupac.org IUPAC Web site publication search for 'aluminum'].</ref>

=== Different endings ===

Most countries use the ending "-ium" for "aluminium". In the United States and Canada, the ending "-um" predominates.<ref name=Greenwood1997/><ref>Bremner, John ''Words on Words: A Dictionary for Writers and Others Who Care about Words'', pp. 22–23. ISBN 0-231-04493-3.</ref> The [[Canadian Oxford Dictionary]] prefers ''aluminum'', whereas the Australian [[Macquarie Dictionary]] prefers ''aluminium''. In 1926, the [[American Chemical Society]] officially decided to use ''aluminum'' in its publications; American dictionaries typically label the spelling ''aluminium'' as "chiefly British".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aluminium |title= Aluminium - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |accessdate=23 July 2013}}</ref><ref>

The earliest citation given in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] for any word used as a name for this element is ''alumium'', which British chemist and inventor [[Humphry Davy]] employed in 1808 for the metal he was trying to isolate electrolytically from the mineral ''[[alumina]]''. The citation is from the journal ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'': "Had I been so fortunate as to have obtained more certain evidences on this subject, and to have procured the metallic substances I was in search of, I should have proposed for them the names of silicium, alumium, zirconium, and glucium."<ref>"alumium", ''Oxford English Dictionary''. Ed. J.A. Simpson and E.S.C. Weiner, second edition Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. OED Online Oxford University Press. Accessed 29 October 2006. Citation is listed as "1808 SIR H. DAVY in Phil. Trans.

Davy settled on ''aluminum'' by the time he published his 1812 book ''Chemical Philosophy'': "This substance appears to contain a peculiar metal, but as yet Aluminum has not been obtained in a perfectly free state, though alloys of it with other metalline substances have been procured sufficiently distinct to indicate the probable nature of alumina."<ref name=Davy1812>

The ''-ium'' suffix conformed to the precedent set in other newly discovered elements of the time: potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, and [[strontium]] (all of which Davy isolated himself). Nevertheless, ''-um'' spellings for elements were not unknown at the time, as for example [[platinum]], known to Europeans since the 16th century, [[molybdenum]], discovered in 1778, and [[tantalum]], discovered in 1802. The ''-um'' suffix is consistent with the universal spelling [[alumina]] for the [[oxide]] (as opposed to aluminia), as [[lanthana]] is the oxide of [[lanthanum]], and [[magnesium oxide|magnesia]], [[ceria]], and [[thoria]] are the oxides of [[magnesium]], [[cerium]], and [[thorium]] respectively.

The ''aluminum'' spelling is used in the [[Webster's Dictionary]] of 1828. In his advertising handbill for his new electrolytic method of producing the metal in 1892, [[Charles Martin Hall]] used the ''-um'' spelling, despite his constant use of the ''-ium'' spelling in all the patents<ref name="Hall-patent"/> he filed between 1886 and 1903. Hall's domination of production of the metal ensured that ''aluminum'' became the standard English spelling in North America.

[[File:Al transport across human cells.jpg|350px|thumb|There are five major Al forms absorbed by human body: the free solvated trivalent cation (Al<sup>3+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>); low-molecular-weight, neutral, soluble complexes (LMW-Al<sup>0</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>); high-molecular-weight, neutral, soluble complexes (HMW-Al<sup>0</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>); low-molecular-weight, charged, soluble complexes (LMW-Al(L)<sub>n</sub><sup>+/−</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>); nano and micro-particulates (Al(L)<sub>n(s)</sub>).

Despite its widespread occurrence in nature, aluminium has no known function in biology. Aluminium salts are remarkably nontoxic, [[aluminium sulfate]] having an [[Median lethal dose|LD<sub>50</sub>]] of 6207&nbsp;mg/kg (oral, mouse), which corresponds to 500&nbsp;grams for an {{convert|80|kg|abbr=on}} person.<ref name=Ullmann/> The extremely low acute toxicity notwithstanding, the health effects of aluminium are of interest in view of the widespread occurrence of the element in the environment and in commerce.

==Health concerns==
Some toxicity can be traced to deposition in bone and the central nervous system, which is particularly increased in patients with reduced renal function. Because aluminium competes with calcium for absorption, increased amounts of dietary aluminium may contribute to the reduced skeletal mineralization (osteopenia) observed in preterm infants and infants with growth retardation. In very high doses, aluminium is associated with altered function of the [[blood–brain barrier]].<ref>{{cite journal |author = Banks, W.A. |date = 1989 |title = Aluminum-induced neurotoxicity: alterations in membrane function at the blood–brain barrier |journal = Neurosci Biobehav Rev |volume = 13 |issue = 1 |pages = 47–53 |doi = 10.1016/S0149-7634(89)80051-X |pmid = 2671833 |last2 = Kastin |first2 = AJ}}</ref> A small percentage of people are [[allergy|allergic]] to aluminium and experience [[contact dermatitis]], [[digestion|digestive]] disorders, [[vomiting]] or other symptoms upon contact or ingestion of products containing aluminium, such as [[antiperspirant]]s and antacids.

[[Wheat]]'s [[adaptation]] to allow aluminium tolerance is such that the aluminium induces a release of [[organic compound]]s that bind to the harmful aluminium [[cations]]. [[Sorghum]] is believed to have the same tolerance mechanism. The first gene for aluminium tolerance has been identified in wheat.
