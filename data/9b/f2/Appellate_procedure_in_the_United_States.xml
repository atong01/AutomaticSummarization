Depending on the particular legal rules that apply to each circumstance, a party to a<space/><link><target>court case</target></link><space/>who is unhappy with the result might be able to challenge that result in an appellate court on specific grounds. These grounds typically could include errors of law,<space/><link><target>fact</target></link>, procedure or due process.</paragraph><paragraph>In different jurisdictions, appellate courts are also called appeals courts, courts of appeals, superior courts, or supreme courts.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Access to appellant status</heading><paragraph>A party who files an appeal is called an &quot;appellant&quot;, &quot;plaintiff in error&quot;, &quot;petitioner&quot; or &quot;pursuer&quot;, and a party on the other side is called a &quot;appellee&quot;. A &quot;cross-appeal&quot; is an appeal brought by the respondent. For example, suppose at trial the judge found for the plaintiff and ordered the defendant to pay $50,000. If the defendant files an appeal arguing that he should not have to pay any money, then the plaintiff might file a cross-appeal arguing that the defendant should have to pay $200,000 instead of $50,000.</paragraph><paragraph>The appellant is the party who, having lost part or all their<space/><link><target>lawsuit</target><part>claim</part></link><space/>in a<space/><link><target>lower court</target></link><space/>decision, is appealing to a higher court to have their case reconsidered. This is usually done on the basis that the lower court judge erred in the application of law, but it may also be possible to appeal on the basis of court misconduct, or that a finding of fact was entirely unreasonable to make on the evidence.</paragraph><paragraph>The appellant in the new case can be either the<space/><link><target>plaintiff</target></link><space/>(or claimant),<space/><link><target>defendant</target></link>, third-party<space/><link><target>intervenor</target></link>, or respondent (appellee) from the lower case, depending on who was the losing party. The winning party from the lower court, however, is now the respondent. In unusual cases the appellant can be the victor in the court below, but still appeal.</paragraph><paragraph>An appellee is the party to an appeal in which the lower court<space/><link><target>judgment (law)</target><part>judgment</part></link><space/>was in its favor.

It is distinguished from<space/><link><target>Judicial review (theory)</target><part>judicial review</part></link>, which refers to the court's overriding constitutional or statutory right to determine if a legislative act or administrative decision is defective for jurisdictional or other reasons (which may vary by jurisdiction).</paragraph><paragraph>In most jurisdictions the normal and preferred way of seeking appellate review is by filing an appeal of the final<space/><link><target>Legal judgment</target><part>judgment</part></link>. Generally, an appeal of the judgment will also allow appeal of all other orders or rulings made by the trial court in the course of the case. This is because such orders cannot be appealed &quot;as of right&quot;. However, certain critical interlocutory<space/><link><target>court order</target><trail>s</trail></link>, such as the denial of a request for an interim<space/><link><target>injunction</target></link>, or an order holding a person in<space/><link><target>contempt of court</target></link>, can be appealed immediately although the case may otherwise not have been fully disposed of.</paragraph><paragraph>There are two distinct forms of appellate review, &quot;direct&quot; and &quot;collateral&quot;. For example, a criminal defendant may be convicted in state court, and lose on &quot;direct appeal&quot; to higher state appellate courts, and if unsuccessful, mount a &quot;collateral&quot; action such as filing for a writ of<space/><link><target>habeas corpus</target></link><space/>in the<space/><link><target>United States federal courts</target><part>federal courts</part></link>. Generally speaking, &quot;[d]irect appeal statutes afford defendants the opportunity to challenge the merits of a judgment and allege errors of law or fact. ...

On direct appeal, a prisoner challenges the grounds of the conviction based on an error that occurred at trial or some other stage in the adjudicative process.</paragraph><heading level='5'>Preservation Issues</heading><paragraph>An appellant's claim(s) must usually be preserved at trial. This means that the defendant had to object to the error when it occurred in the trial. Because constitutional claims are of great magnitude, appellate courts might be more lenient to review the claim even if it was not preserved. For example Connecticut applies the following standard to review unpreserved claims: 1.the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; 2. the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; 3. the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; 4. if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="last">Dauman</arg><arg name="first">Chad</arg><arg name="title">Criminal Appeals in the United States: Preservation Issues</arg><arg name="url">http://www.Chaddauman.blogspot.com</arg><arg name="work">blog</arg><arg name="accessdate">2011-04-27</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='4'>State Post Conviction Relief: Collateral Appeal</heading><paragraph>All States have a post-conviction relief process.

The nature of this form can vary greatly from country to country and from court to court within a country.</paragraph><paragraph>The specific rules of the legal system will dictate exactly how the appeal is officially begun. For example, the appellant might have to file the notice of appeal with the appellate court, or with the court from which the appeal is taken, or both.</paragraph><paragraph>Some courts have samples of a notice of appeal on the court's own web site. In New Jersey, for example, the Administrative Office of the Court has promulgated a form of notice of appeal for use by appellants, though using this exact form is not mandatory and the failure to use it is not a jurisdictional defect provided that all pertinent information is set forth in whatever form of notice of appeal is used.<extension extension_name='ref'>Jeffrey S. Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books)</extension></paragraph><paragraph>The deadline for beginning an appeal can often be very short: traditionally, it is measured in days, not months. This can vary from country to country, as well as within a country, depending on the specific rules in force. In the U.S. federal court system, criminal defendants must file a notice of appeal within 10 days of the entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed, or the right to appeal is forfeited.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>citation</target><arg name="title">Rule 4(b)(1)(A)</arg><arg name="url">http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28a/usc_sec_28a_00000004----000-.html</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Appellate procedure</heading><paragraph><template><target>See also</target><arg>United States courts of appeals</arg></template>Generally speaking the appellate court examines the record of<space/><link><target>evidence (law)</target><part>evidence</part></link><space/>presented in the trial court and the law that the lower court applied and decides whether that decision was legally sound or not. The appellate court will typically be deferential to the lower court's findings of fact (such as whether a defendant committed a particular act), unless clearly erroneous, and so will focus on the court's application of the law to those facts (such as whether the act found by the court to have occurred fits a legal definition at issue).</paragraph><paragraph>If the appellate court finds no defect, it &quot;affirms&quot; the judgment. If the appellate court does find a legal defect in the decision &quot;below&quot; (i.e., in the lower court), it may &quot;modify&quot; the ruling to correct the defect, or it may nullify (&quot;reverse&quot; or &quot;vacate&quot;) the whole decision or any part of it. It may, in addition, send the case back (&quot;remand&quot; or &quot;remit&quot;) to the lower court for further proceedings to remedy the defect.</paragraph><paragraph>In some cases, an appellate court may review a lower court decision &quot;de novo&quot; (or completely), challenging even the lower court's findings of fact. This might be the proper standard of review, for example, if the lower court resolved the case by granting a pre-trial<space/><link><target>motion to dismiss</target></link><space/>or motion for<space/><link><target>summary judgment</target></link><space/>which is usually based only upon written submissions to the trial court and not on any trial testimony.</paragraph><paragraph>Another situation is where appeal is by way of &quot;re-hearing&quot;. Certain jurisdictions permit certain appeals to cause the trial to be heard afresh in the appellate court.</paragraph><paragraph>Sometimes, the appellate court finds a defect in the procedure the parties used in filing the appeal and dismisses the appeal without considering its merits, which has the same effect as affirming the judgment below. (This would happen, for example, if the appellant waited too long, under the appellate court's rules, to file the appeal.)</paragraph><paragraph>Generally, there is no<space/><link><target>Jury trial</target><part>trial</part></link><space/>in an appellate court, only consideration of the record of the evidence presented to the trial court and all the pre-trial and trial court proceedings are reviewedunless the appeal is by way of re-hearing, new evidence will usually only be considered on appeal in &quot;very&quot; rare instances, for example if that material evidence was unavailable to a party for some very significant reason such as<space/><link><target>prosecutorial misconduct</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>In some systems, an appellate court will only consider the written decision of the lower court, together with any written evidence that was before that court and is relevant to the appeal. In other systems, the appellate court will normally consider the record of the lower court. In those cases the record will first be certified by the lower court.</paragraph><paragraph>The appellant has the opportunity to present arguments for the granting of the appeal and the appellee (or respondent) can present arguments against it. Arguments of the parties to the appeal are presented through their appellate lawyers, if represented, or &quot;<link><target>pro se</target></link>&quot; if the party has not engaged legal representation. Those arguments are presented in written<space/><link><target>brief (law)</target><part>briefs</part></link><space/>and sometimes in<space/><link><target>oral argument</target></link><space/>to the court at a<space/><link><target>hearing (law)</target><part>hearing</part></link>. At such hearings each party is allowed a brief presentation at which the appellate judges ask questions based on their review of the record below and the submitted briefs.</paragraph><paragraph>In an<space/><link><target>adversarial system</target></link>, appellate courts do not have the power to review lower court decisions unless a party appeals it. Therefore, if a lower court has ruled in an improper manner, or against<space/><link><target>Precedent</target><part>legal precedent</part></link>, that judgment will stand if not appealed even if it might have been overturned on appeal.</paragraph><paragraph>The United States legal system generally recognizes two types of appeals: a trial &quot;de novo&quot; or an appeal on the record.</paragraph><paragraph>A<space/><link><target>trial de novo</target></link><space/>is usually available for review of informal proceedings conducted by some minor judicial tribunals in proceedings that do not provide all the procedural attributes of a formal judicial<space/><link><target>trial (law)</target><part>trial</part></link>. If unchallenged, these decisions have the power to settle more minor legal disputes once and for all. If a party is dissatisfied with the finding of such a tribunal, one generally has the power to request a trial &quot;de novo&quot; by a<space/><link><target>court of record</target></link>. In such a proceeding, all issues and<space/><link><target>evidence (law)</target><part>evidence</part></link><space/>may be developed newly, as though never heard before, and one is not restricted to the evidence heard in the lower proceeding. Sometimes, however, the decision of the lower proceeding is itself admissible as evidence, thus helping to curb frivolous appeals.</paragraph><paragraph>In some cases, an application for &quot;trial de novo&quot; effectively erases the prior trial as if it had never taken place. The Supreme Court of Virginia has stated that '&quot;This Court has repeatedly held that the effect of an appeal to circuit court is to &quot;annul the judgment of the inferior tribunal as completely as if there had been no previous trial.&quot;'<extension extension_name='ref'>&quot;Gaskill v. Commonwealth&quot;, 206 Va. 486, 490, 144 S.E.2d 293, 296 (1965)</extension><space/>The only exception to this is that if a defendant appeals a conviction for a crime having multiple levels of offenses, where they are convicted on a lesser offense, the appeal is of the lesser offense; the conviction represents an acquittal of the more serious offenses. &quot;[A] trial on the same charges in the circuit court does not violate double jeopardy principles, . . . subject only to the limitation that conviction in [the] district court for an offense lesser included in the one charged constitutes an acquittal of the greater offense,permitting trial de novo in the circuit court only for the lesser-included offense.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>&quot;Kenyon v. Commonwealth&quot;, 37 Va. App. 668, 673, 561 S.E.2d 17, 1920</extension></paragraph><paragraph>In an appeal on the record from a decision in a judicial proceeding, both appellant and respondent are bound to base their arguments wholly on the proceedings and body of evidence as they were presented in the lower tribunal. Each seeks to prove to the higher court that the result they desired was the just result.<space/><link><target>Precedent</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>case law</target></link><space/>figure prominently in the arguments. In order for the appeal to succeed, the appellant must prove that the lower court committed<space/><link><target>reversible error</target></link>, that is, an impermissible action by the court acted to cause a result that was unjust, and which would not have resulted had the court acted properly. Some examples of reversible error would be erroneously instructing the jury on the law applicable to the case, permitting seriously<space/><link><target>improper argument</target></link><space/>by an attorney, admitting or excluding evidence improperly, acting outside the court's jurisdiction, injecting bias into the proceeding or appearing to do so, juror misconduct, etc. The failure to formally object at the time, to what one views as improper action in the lower court, may result in the affirmance of the lower court's judgment on the grounds that one did not &quot;preserve the issue for appeal&quot; by objecting.</paragraph><paragraph>In cases where a judge rather than a jury decided issues of fact, an appellate court will apply an &quot;abuse of discretion&quot; standard of review. Under this standard, the appellate court gives deference to the lower court's view of the evidence, and reverses its decision only if it were a clear abuse of discretion. This is usually defined as a decision outside the bounds of reasonableness. On the other hand, the appellate court normally gives less deference to a lower court's decision on issues of law, and may reverse if it finds that the lower court applied the wrong legal standard.</paragraph><paragraph>In some cases, an appellant may successfully argue that the law under which the lower decision was rendered was<space/><link><target>Constitutionality</target><part>unconstitutional</part></link><space/>or otherwise invalid, or may convince the higher court to order a new trial on the basis that evidence earlier sought was concealed or only recently discovered. In the case of new evidence, there must be a high probability that its presence or absence would have made a material difference in the trial. Another issue suitable for appeal in criminal cases is effective assistance of counsel. If a defendant has been convicted and can prove that his lawyer did not adequately handle his case and that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different had the lawyer given competent representation, he is entitled to a new trial.</paragraph><paragraph>A lawyer traditionally starts an oral argument to any appellate court with the words &quot;May it please the court.&quot;</paragraph><paragraph>After an appeal is heard, the &quot;mandate&quot; is a formal notice of a decision by a court of appeal; this notice is transmitted to the trial court and, when filed by the<space/><link><target>Court clerk</target><part>clerk</part></link><space/>of the trial court, constitutes the final judgment on the case, unless the appeal court has directed further proceedings in the trial court. The mandate is distinguished from the appeal court's<space/><link><target>court opinion</target><part>opinion</part></link>, which sets out the legal reasoning for its decision.
