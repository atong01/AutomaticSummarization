These were demonstrated at<space/><link><target>The Mother of All Demos</target></link><space/>in 1968.<space/><link><target>Engelbart's Law</target></link>, the observation that the intrinsic rate of human performance is exponential, is named after him.</paragraph><paragraph>In the early 1950s, he decided that instead of &quot;having a steady job&quot; such as his position at NASA's Ames Research Center he would focus on making the world a better place. He reasoned that because the complexity of the world's problems were increasing, and that any effort to improve the world would require the coordination of groups of people, the most effective way to solve problems was to augment human intelligence and develop ways of building collective intelligence.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Interview with Doug Engelbart"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="last1">Markoff</arg><arg name="first1">John</arg><arg name="url">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v</arg></template></extension><space/>He believed that the computer, which previously was at the time thought of only as a tool for automation, would be an essential tool for future knowledge workers to solve such problems. He was a committed, vocal proponent of the development and use of computers and<space/><link><target>computer network</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>to help cope with the worlds increasingly urgent and complex problems. Engelbart embedded a set of organizing principles in his lab, which he termed &quot;bootstrapping&quot;. His belief was that when human systems and tool systems were aligned, such that workers spent time &quot;improving their tools for improving their tools&quot; it would lead to an accelerating rate of progress.</paragraph><paragraph>Under Engelbart's guidance, the Augmentation Research Center developed, with funding primarily from<space/><link><target>DARPA</target></link>, the<space/><link><target>NLS (computer system)</target><part>NLS</part></link><space/>to demonstrate numerous technologies, most of which are now in widespread use; this included the computer mouse, bitmapped screens, hypertext; all of which were displayed at The Mother of All Demos in 1968. The lab was transferred from SRI to Tymshare in the late 1970s, which was acquired by McDonnell Douglas in 1984, and NLS was renamed Augment. At both Tymshare and McDonnell Douglas, Engelbart was limited by a lack of interest in his ideas and funding to pursue them, and retired in 1986.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1988, Engelbart and his daughter Christina launched the Bootstrap Institute later known as<space/><link><target>The Doug Engelbart Institute</target></link><space/>to promote his vision, especially at Stanford University; this effort did result in some DARPA funding to modernize the user interface of Augment. In December 2000, United States President Bill Clinton awarded Engelbart the National Medal of Technology, the United States' highest technology award.
