In 1141, the<space/><link><target>Archbishopric of Bourges</target></link><space/>became vacant, and the king put forward as a candidate one of his chancellors, Cadurc, while vetoing the one suitable candidate,<space/><link><target>Pierre de la Chatre</target></link>, who was promptly elected by the<space/><link><target>Canon (priest)</target><part>canons</part></link><space/>of<space/><link><target>Bourges Cathedral</target><part>Bourges</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>consecration</target><part>consecrated</part></link><space/>by the pope. Louis accordingly bolted the gates of Bourges against the new bishop. The pope, recalling similar attempts by William X to exile supporters of Innocent from Poitou and replace them with priests loyal to himself, blamed Eleanor, saying that Louis was only a child and should be taught manners. Outraged, Louis swore upon relics that so long as he lived Pierre should never enter Bourges. An<space/><link><target>interdict</target></link><space/>was thereupon imposed upon the king's lands, and Pierre was given refuge by<space/><link><target>Theobald II, Count of Champagne</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Louis became involved in a war with Count Theobald by permitting<space/><link><target>Raoul I, Count of Vermandois</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>seneschal</target></link><space/>of France, to repudiate his wife<space/><link><target>Elonore of Blois</target></link>, Theobald's sister, and to marry<space/><link><target>Petronilla of Aquitaine</target></link>, Eleanor's sister. Eleanor urged Louis to support her sister's marriage to Count Raoul. Theobald had also offended Louis by siding with the pope in the dispute over Bourges. The war lasted two years (114244) and ended with the occupation of<space/><link><target>Champagne</target></link><space/>by the royal army. Louis was personally involved in the assault and burning of the town of<space/><link><target>Vitry-le-Franois</target><part>Vitry</part></link>. More than a thousand people who sought refuge in the church there died in the flames. Horrified, and desiring an end to the war, Louis attempted to make peace with Theobald in exchange for his support in lifting the interdict on Raoul and Petronilla. This was duly lifted for long enough to allow Theobald's lands to be restored; it was then lowered once more when Raoul refused to repudiate Petronilla, prompting Louis to return to Champagne and ravage it once more.</paragraph><paragraph>In June 1144, the king and queen visited the newly built monastic church at Saint-Denis. While there, the queen met with Bernard of Clairvaux, demanding that he have the excommunication of Petronilla and Raoul lifted through his influence on the pope, in exchange for which King Louis would make concessions in Champagne and recognise Pierre de la Chatre as Archbishop of Bourges. Dismayed at her attitude, Bernard scolded Eleanor for her lack of penitence and interference in matters of state. In response, Eleanor broke down and meekly excused her behaviour, claiming to be bitter because of her lack of children. In response, Bernard became more kindly towards her: &quot;My child, seek those things which make for peace. Cease to stir up the King against the Church, and urge upon him a better course of action. If you will promise to do this, I in return promise to entreat the merciful Lord to grant you offspring.&quot; In a matter of weeks, peace had returned to France: Theobald's provinces were returned and Pierre de la Chatre was installed as Archbishop of Bourges. In April 1145, Eleanor gave birth to a daughter,<space/><link><target>Marie of France, Countess of Champagne</target><part>Marie</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Louis, however, still burned with guilt over the massacre at Vitry and wished to make a pilgrimage to the<space/><link><target>Holy Land</target></link><space/>to atone for his sins. Fortunately for him, in the autumn of 1145,<space/><link><target>Pope Eugene III</target></link><space/>requested that Louis lead a<space/><link><target>Crusades</target><part>Crusade</part></link><space/>to the<space/><link><target>Middle East</target></link><space/>to rescue the<space/><link><target>Crusader states</target><part>Frankish Kingdoms</part></link><space/>there from disaster. Accordingly, Louis declared on Christmas Day 1145 at Bourges his intention of going on crusade.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Crusade</heading><paragraph>Eleanor of Aquitaine also formally took up the cross symbolic of the<space/><link><target>Second Crusade</target></link><space/>during a sermon preached by Bernard of Clairvaux. In addition, she had been corresponding with her uncle<space/><link><target>Raymond of Poitiers</target><part>Raymond</part></link>, Prince of the Crusader kingdom of<space/><link><target>Antioch</target></link>, who was seeking further protection against the &quot;Saracens&quot; from the French crown. Eleanor recruited some of her royal ladies-in-waiting for the campaign, as well as 300 non-noble Aquitainian vassals. She insisted on taking part in the Crusades as the feudal leader of the soldiers from her duchy. The story that she and her ladies dressed as<space/><link><target>Amazons</target></link><space/>is disputed by historians, sometimes confused with the account of King Conrad's train of ladies during this campaign (in<space/><link><target>Edward Gibbon</target></link>'s<space/><italics><link><target>The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</target></link></italics>). Her testimonial launch of the Second Crusade from<space/><link><target>Vzelay</target></link>, the rumored location of<space/><link><target>Mary Magdalene</target></link>s grave, dramatically emphasized the role of women in the campaign.</paragraph><paragraph>The Crusade itself achieved little. Louis was a weak and ineffectual military leader with no skill for maintaining troop discipline or morale, or of making informed and logical tactical decisions. In eastern Europe, the French army was at times hindered by<space/><link><target>Manuel I Comnenus</target></link>, the<space/><link><target>Byzantine Emperor</target></link>, who feared that the Crusade would jeopardize the tenuous safety of his empire. Notwithstanding, during their three-week stay at<space/><link><target>Constantinople</target></link>, Louis was fted and Eleanor was much admired. She was compared with<space/><link><target>Penthesilea</target></link>, mythical queen of the<space/><link><target>Amazons</target></link>, by the Greek historian<space/><link><target>Nicetas Choniates</target></link>. He added that she gained the epithet<space/><italics>chrysopous</italics><space/>(golden-foot) from the cloth of gold that decorated and fringed her robe. Louis and Eleanor stayed in the<space/><link><target>Philopation</target></link><space/>palace just outside the city walls.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:2nd Crusade council at Jerusalem.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part><link><target>Second Crusade</target></link><space/>council:<space/><link><target>Conrad III of Germany</target></link>, Eleanor's husband<space/><link><target>Louis VII of France</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Baldwin III of Jerusalem</target></link></part></link></paragraph><paragraph>From the moment the Crusaders entered<space/><link><target>Asia Minor</target></link>, things began to go badly. The king and queen were still optimistic&amp;nbsp; the Byzantine Emperor had told them that the<space/><link><target>Conrad III of Germany</target><part>German King Conrad</part></link><space/>had won a great victory against a Turkish army (when in fact the German army had been massacred), and the troupe was still eating well. However, while camping near Nicea, the remnants of the German army, including a dazed and sick King Conrad, staggered past the French camp, bringing news of their disaster. The French, with what remained of the Germans, then began to march in increasingly disorganized fashion towards Antioch. They were in high spirits on Christmas Eve, when they chose to camp in a lush Dercervian valley near<space/><link><target>Ephesus</target></link>. Here they were ambushed by a Turkish detachment; the French proceeded to slaughter this detachment and appropriate their camp.</paragraph><paragraph>Louis then decided to cross the Phrygian mountains directly in the hope of reaching Eleanor's uncle Raymond in Antioch more quickly. As they ascended the mountains, however, the army and the king and queen were horrified to discover the unburied corpses of the previously slaughtered German army.</paragraph><paragraph>On the day set for the crossing of Mount Cadmos, Louis chose to take charge of the rear of the column, where the unarmed pilgrims and the baggage trains marched. The vanguard, with which Queen Eleanor marched, was commanded by her Aquitainian vassal<space/><link><target>Geoffrey de Rancon</target></link>. Unencumbered by baggage, they reached the summit of Cadmos, where Rancon had been ordered to make camp for the night. Rancon however chose to continue on, deciding in concert with<space/><link><target>Amadeus III, Count of Savoy</target></link><space/>(Louis's uncle) that a nearby plateau would make a better campsite: such disobedience was reportedly common.</paragraph><paragraph>Accordingly, by mid-afternoon, the rear of the column&amp;nbsp; believing the day's march to be nearly at an end&amp;nbsp; was dawdling. This resulted in the army becoming separated, with some having already crossed the summit and others still approaching it. At this point the Turks, who had been following and feinting for many days, seized their opportunity and attacked those who had not yet crossed the summit. The French (both soldiers and pilgrims), taken by surprise, were trapped; those who tried to escape were caught and killed. Many men, horses, and much of the baggage were cast into the canyon below. The chronicler<space/><link><target>William of Tyre</target></link>,writing between 1170 and 1184 and thus perhaps too late to be considered historically accurate, placed the blame for this disaster firmly on the amount of baggage (much of it reputedly belonging to Eleanor and her ladies) and the presence of non-combatants.</paragraph><paragraph>The king, having scorned royal apparel in favour of a simple pilgrim's tunic, escaped notice (unlike his bodyguards, whose skulls were brutally smashed and limbs severed).

Since he was Eleanor's vassal, many believed that it was she who had been ultimately responsible for the change in plan, and thus the massacre. This did nothing for her popularity in<space/><link><target>Christendom</target></link>&amp;nbsp; she was also blamed for the size of the baggage train and the fact that her Aquitainian soldiers had marched at the front, thus not involved in the fight. Continuing on, the army became split, with the commoners marching toward Antioch and the royalty traveling by sea. When most of the land army arrived, the king and queen had a profound dispute. Some, such as<space/><link><target>John of Salisbury</target></link><space/>and William of Tyre, say Eleanor's reputation was sullied by rumours of an affair with her uncle Raymond. However, this may have been a ruse, as Raymond through Eleanor tried to sway Louis forcibly to use his army to attack the actual Muslim encampment at nearby<space/><link><target>Aleppo</target></link>, gateway to retaking<space/><link><target>Edessa</target></link>, by papal decree the objective of the Crusade. Although this was perhaps the better military plan, Louis was not keen to fight in northern Syria. One of Louis's avowed Crusade goals was to journey in pilgrimage to<space/><link><target>Jerusalem</target></link>, and he stated his intention to continue. Reputedly Eleanor then requested to stay with Raymond and brought up the matter of consanguinity&amp;nbsp; the fact that she and her husband, King Louis, were too closely related. This was grounds for divorce in the medieval period. Rather than allowing her to stay, Louis took Eleanor from Antioch against her will and continued on to Jerusalem with his dwindling army .<extension extension_name='ref'>Natasha Hodgson,<space/><italics>Women, Crusading and the Holy Land in Historical Narrative</italics><space/>(Boydell, 2007) 131134 on Eleanor's 'adultery</extension></paragraph><paragraph>This episode humiliated Eleanor, and she maintained a low profile for the rest of the crusade.

Damascus was a major trading centre that abounded in wealth and was under normal circumstances a potential threat, but the rulers of Jerusalem had recently entered into a truce with the city, which they then forswore. It was a gamble that did not pay off, and whether through military error or betrayal, the Damascus campaign was a failure. The French royal family retreated to Jerusalem and then sailed to Rome and made their way back to Paris.</paragraph><paragraph>While in the eastern Mediterranean, Eleanor learned about maritime conventions developing there, which were the beginnings of what would become<space/><link><target>admiralty law</target></link>.

Eleanor's purported relationship with her uncle Raymond,<extension extension_name='ref'>Revisiting Monarchy: Women and the Prospects for Power</extension><space/>the ruler of Antioch, was a major source of discord. Eleanor supported her uncle's desire to re-capture the nearby<space/><link><target>County of Edessa</target></link>, the objective of the Crusade. In addition, having been close to him in their youth, she now showed what was considered to be &quot;excessive affection&quot; toward her uncle. Raymond had plans to abduct Eleanor, to which she consented.<extension extension_name='ref' name="ReferenceA">Some Legends Concerning Eleanor of Aquitaine</extension><space/>While many historians<template><target>who</target><arg name="date">August 2011</arg></template><space/>today dismiss this as normal affection between uncle and niece (noting their early friendship and his similarity to her father and grandfather), some of Eleanor's adversaries interpreted the generous displays of affection as an incestuous affair. Louis's long march to Jerusalem and back north, which Eleanor was forced to join, debilitated his army and disheartened her knights; the divided Crusade armies could not overcome the Muslim forces, and the royal couple had to return home.</paragraph><paragraph>Home, however, was not easily reached. Louis and Eleanor, on separate ships due to their disagreements, were first attacked in May 1149 by Byzantine ships attempting to capture both on the orders of the Byzantine Emperor. Although they escaped this attempt unharmed, stormy weather drove Eleanor's ship far to the south (to the<space/><link><target>Barbary Coast</target></link>) and caused her to lose track of her husband. Neither was heard of for over two months. In mid-July, Eleanor's ship finally reached<space/><link><target>Palermo</target></link><space/>in Sicily, where she discovered that she and her husband had both been given up for dead. She was given shelter and food by servants of King<space/><link><target>Roger II of Sicily</target></link>, until the king eventually reached<space/><link><target>Calabria</target></link>, and she set out to meet him there. Later, at King Roger's court in<space/><link><target>Potenza</target></link>, she learned of the death of her uncle Raymond, who was beheaded by Muslim forces in the Holy Land. This appears to have forced a change of plans, for instead of returning to France from<space/><link><target>Marseilles</target></link>, they went to see Pope Eugene III in<space/><link><target>Tusculum</target></link>, where he had been driven five months before by a revolt of the<space/><link><target>Commune of Rome</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Eugene did not, as Eleanor had hoped, grant an annulment.

Henry was by no means faithful to his wife and had a reputation for philandering. Henry fathered other, illegitimate children throughout the marriage. Eleanor appears to have taken an ambivalent attitude towards these affairs: for example,<space/><link><target>Geoffrey (Archbishop of York)</target><part>Geoffrey of York</part></link>, an illegitimate son of Henry, was acknowledged by Henry as his child and raised at<space/><link><target>Westminster</target></link><space/>in the care of the queen.</paragraph><paragraph>During the period from Henry's accession to the birth of Eleanor's youngest son John, affairs in the kingdom were turbulent: Aquitaine, as was the norm, defied the authority of Henry as Eleanor's husband and answered only to their Duchess. Attempts were made to claim<space/><link><target>Toulouse</target></link>, the rightful inheritance of Eleanor's grandmother<space/><link><target>Philippa of Toulouse</target></link>, but they ended in failure. A bitter feud arose between the king and<space/><link><target>Thomas Becket</target></link>, initially his Chancellor and closest adviser and later the Archbishop of Canterbury.

At the royal court celebrated there that Christmas, she appears to have agreed to a separation from Henry. Certainly, she left for her own city of Poitiers immediately after Christmas. Henry did not stop her; on the contrary, he and his army personally escorted her there before attacking a castle belonging to the rebellious<space/><link><target>Lusignan</target></link><space/>family. Henry then went about his own business outside Aquitaine, leaving Earl Patrick (his regional military commander) as her protective custodian.
