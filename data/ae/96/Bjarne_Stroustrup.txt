==Education==
Stroustrup has a [[master's degree]] in [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]] (1975) from [[Aarhus University]], Denmark, and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in computer science (1979) from the [[University of Cambridge]], England.<ref name="wong"/> His thesis advisor in Cambridge was [[David Wheeler (computer scientist)|David Wheeler]].<ref name="stroustrupphd">{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=Bjarne|last=Stroustrup |title=Communication and control in distributed computer systems |publisher=University of Cambridge |date=1979 |url= http://ulmss-newton.lib.cam.ac.uk/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=14260|authorlink=Bjarne Stroustrup}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=16946|title=David Wheeler|work=The Mathematics Genealogy Project|publisher=Department of Mathematics, North Dakota State University|accessdate=29 January 2014}}</ref>

==Career==
Stroustrup began developing C++ in 1978 (then called "[[C (programming language)|C]] with Classes"), and, in his own words, "invented C++, wrote its early definitions, and produced its first implementation... chose and formulated the design criteria for C++, designed all its major facilities, and was responsible for the processing of extension proposals in the C++ standards committee."<ref>''The C++ Programming Language'', B. Stroustrup, p.10</ref> Stroustrup also wrote a textbook for the language, ''[[The C++ Programming Language]]''.

Stroustrup was the head of [[Bell Labs|AT&T Bell Labs']] Large-scale Programming Research department, from its creation until late 2002. Stroustrup was elected member of the [[National Academy of Engineering]] in 2004. He is a Fellow of the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] (1994) and an [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] Fellow. He works at [[Texas A&M University]] as a Distinguished Professor where he holds the College of Engineering Endowed Chair in [[Computer Science]].<ref>[http://www.research.att.com/~bs/bio.html Bjarne Stroustrup: Some Information about Bjorne Stroustrup.]</ref><ref>[http://www.cse.tamu.edu/people/faculty  Texas A&M CSE Department's Faculty Directory]</ref> He is also a visiting faculty in Computer Science Department at Columbia University.<ref>[http://www.cs.columbia.edu/people/faculty]</ref> [[ITMO University]] noble doctor since 2013<ref>[http://is.ifmo.ru/doctors/stroustrup.pdf]</ref>

In 2015, he was made a Fellow <ref> {{Cite web |title= Bjarne Stroustrup— CHM Fellow Award Winner |author= CHM |url= http://www.computerhistory.org/fellowawards/hall/bios/Bjarne,Stroustrup/|accessdate= March 30, 2015 }}</ref> of the [[Computer History Museum]] for his invention of the C++ programming language.
