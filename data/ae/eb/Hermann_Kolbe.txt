'''Hermann Kolbe''' (''Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe'', 27 Sept. 1818–25 Nov. 1884), was a seminal contributor in the birth of modern [[organic chemistry]] as Professor at [[University of Marburg|Marburg]] and [[Leipzig University|Leipzig]]. Kolbe coined the term [[chemical synthesis|synthesis]], and contributed to the philosophical demise of [[vitalism]] through synthesis of the [[organic chemical|biologic natural product]] acetic acid from [[carbon disulfide]], to [[structural theory]] via modifications to the idea of "radicals" and accurate prediction of the existence of secondary and tertiary alcohols, and to the emerging array of organic reactions through his [[Kolbe electrolysis]] of carboxylate salts, the [[Kolbe-Schmitt reaction]] in the preparation of [[aspirin]], and the [[Kolbe nitrile synthesis]]. After studies with [[Friedrich Wöhler|Wöhler]] and [[Robert Bunsen|Bunsen]], Kolbe was involved with the early internationalization of chemistry through overseas work in London (with [[Edward Frankland|Frankland]]), and rose through the ranks of his field to edit the [[:de:Journal für praktische Chemie|''Journal für Praktische Chemie'']], to be elected to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and to win the [[Royal Society of London]]'s Davy Medal in the year of his death. Despite these accomplishments and his training a storied next generation of chemists (including [[Aleksandr Mikhailovich Zaitsev|Zaitsev]], [[Theodor Curtius|Curtius]], [[Ernst Otto Beckmann|Beckmann]], [[Carl Graebe|Graebe]], [[Vladimir Markovnikov|Markovnikov]], etc.), Kolbe is remembered for editing the ''Journal'' for more than a decade, where his rejection of [[August Kekulé|Kekulé]]'s structure of benzene, [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff|van't Hoff]]'s theory on the origin of [[chirality]], and [[Adolf von Baeyer|von Baeyer]]'s reforms of nomenclature were personally critical and linguistically violent. Kolbe died of a heart attack in [[Leipzig]] at age 68, six years after the death of his wife, Charlotte. He was survived by four children.

==Life==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}
Kolbe was born in Elliehausen, near [[Göttingen]], [[Kingdom of Hanover]] (Germany) as the eldest son of a [[Protestant]] pastor. At the age of 13 he entered the Göttingen Gymnasium, residing at the home of one of the professors.  He obtained the leaving certificate (the [[Abitur]]) six years later.  He had become passionate about the study of [[chemistry]], matriculating at the [[University of Göttingen]] in the spring of 1838 in order to study with the famous chemist [[Friedrich Wöhler]].

In 1842 he became an assistant to [[Robert Bunsen]] at the [[University of Marburg|Philipps-Universität Marburg]]; he took his doctoral degree there in 1843.  A new opportunity arose in 1845, when he became assistant to [[Lyon Playfair, 1st Baron Playfair|Lyon Playfair]] at the new ''Museum of Economic Geology'' in London, where he became a close friend of [[Edward Frankland]].  From 1847 he was engaged in editing the ''Handwörterbuch der reinen und angewandten Chemie'' (''Dictionary of Pure and Applied Chemistry'') edited by [[Justus von Liebig]], [[Wöhler]], and [[Johann Christian Poggendorff]], and he also wrote an important textbook.  In 1851 Kolbe succeeded Bunsen as professor of chemistry at Marburg, and in 1865 he was called to the [[Leipzig University|Universität Leipzig]]. In 1864, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

In 1853 he married Charlotte, the daughter of General-Major Wilhelm von Bardeleben. His wife died in 1876 after 23 years of happy marriage.  They had four children.

==Work in chemical research==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2014}}
As late as the 1840s, and despite [[Wöhler synthesis|Friedrich Wöhler's synthesis of urea]] in 1828, some chemists still believed in the doctrine of [[vitalism]], according to which a special life-force was necessary to create "organic" (i.e., in its original meaning, biologically derived) compounds. Kolbe promoted the idea that [[organic compound]]s could be derived from substances clearly sourced from outside this "organic" context, directly or indirectly, by substitution processes. (Hence, while by modern definitions, he was converting one [[organic compound|organic molecule]] to another, by the parlance of his era, he was converting "inorganic"—''anorganisch''—substances into "organic" ones only thought accessible through vital processes.) He validated his theory by converting [[carbon disulfide]] to [[acetic acid]] in several steps (1843–45). Kolbe also introduced a modified idea of structural [[radical theory|radicals]], so contributing to the development of [[structural theory]]. A dramatic success came when his theoretical prediction of the existence of secondary and tertiary [[alcohol]]s was confirmed by the synthesis of the first of these classes of organic molecules. Kolbe was the first person to use the word [[chemical synthesis|synthesis]] in its present day meaning, and contributed a number of new chemical reactions.

In particular, Kolbe developed procedures for the [[electrolysis]] of the salts of [[fatty acid|fatty]] and other [[carboxylic acid]]s ([[Kolbe electrolysis]])<ref>{{cite journal|title = Untersuchungen über die Elektrolyse organischer Verbindungen| author = Hermann Kolbe| journal = [[Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie]]| year = 1849| volume = 69| issue = 3| pages = 257–372| doi = 10.1002/jlac.18490690302}}{{primary source inline|date=July 2014}}</ref>{{primary source inline|date=July 2014}} and prepared [[salicylic acid]], a building block of [[aspirin]] in a process called [[Kolbe synthesis]] or [[Kolbe-Schmitt reaction]].<ref>{{cite journal| title = Ueber Synthese der Salicylsäure| author = Hermann Kolbe| journal = [[Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie]]| year = 1860| volume = 113| issue = 1| pages = 125–127| doi = 10.1002/jlac.18601130120}}{{primary source inline|date=July 2014}}</ref>{{primary source inline|date=July 2014}} His method for the synthesis of nitriles is called the [[Kolbe nitrile synthesis]],{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} and with [[Edward Frankland]] he found that [[nitrile]]s can be hydrolyzed to the corresponding acids.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

In addition to his own bench research and scholarly and editorial work, Kolbe oversaw student research at Leipzig and especially at Marburg; students spending time under his tutelage included [[Peter Griess]], [[Aleksandr Mikhailovich Zaitsev]] (known for [[Zaitsev's rule]] predicting the product composition of elimination reactions), [[Theodor Curtius]] (discoverer of [[diazo]] compounds, [[hydrazine]]s, and the [[Curtius rearrangement]]), [[Ernst Otto Beckmann]] (discoverer of the [[Beckmann rearrangement]]), [[Carl Graebe]] (discoverer of [[alizarin]]), [[Oscar Loew]], [[Constantin Fahlberg]], [[Nikolai Menshutkin]], [[Vladimir Markovnikov]] (first to describe [[carbocycle]]s smaller and larger than [[cyclohexane]], and known for [[Markovnikov's rule]] describing addition reactions to alkenes), [[Jacob Volhard]], [[Ludwig Mond]], [[Alexander Crum Brown]] (first to describe the double bond of ethylene), [[Maxwell Simpson]], and [[Frederick Guthrie]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Work as journal editor==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2014}}
Kolbe served for more than a decade as what, in modern terms, would be understood the senior editor of the [[:de:Journal für praktische Chemie|''Journal für Praktische Chemie'']] (''Journal of practical chemistry'', from 1870 to 1884), Kolbe was sometimes so severely critical of the work of others, especially after about 1874, that some wondered whether he might have been suffering a mental illness.  He was intolerant of what he regarded as loose speculation parading as theory, and sought through his writings to save his beloved science of chemistry from what he regarded as the scourge of modern structural theory.

His rejection of structural chemistry, especially the theories of the structure of benzene by [[August Kekulé]], the theory of the [[asymmetric carbon atom]] by [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff|J.H. van't Hoff]], and the reform of chemical nomenclature by [[Adolf von Baeyer]], resulted in vituperative articles in the ''Journal für Praktische Chemie''.  Some translated quotes illustrate his manner of articulating the deep conflict between his interpretation of chemistry and that of the structural chemists: 
"...Baeyer is an excellent experimentor, but he is only an empiricist, lacking sense and capability, and his interpretations of his experiments show particular deficiency in his familiarity with the principles of true science..."<ref>{{cite journal| title = Begründung meiner Urtheile über Ad. Baeyer's wissenschaftliche Qualification | author = Hermann Kolbe| journal = Journal für Praktische Chemie| volume = 26| issue = 1 | year = 1882 | pages = 308–323| doi = 10.1002/prac.18820260121}}{{primary source inline|date=July 2014}}</ref>{{primary source inline|date=July 2014}}

The violence of his language worked unfairly to limit his posthumous reputation.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}  He died of a heart attack, in [[Leipzig]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}
