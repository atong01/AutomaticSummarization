Located in northwest Switzerland on the river [[Rhine]], Basel functions as a major industrial centre for the chemical and [[pharmaceutical industry]]. The Basel region, culturally extending into German [[Baden-Württemberg]] and French [[Alsace]], reflects the heritage of its three [[Sovereign state|state]]s in the [[New Latin|modern Latin]] name: "Regio TriRhena". It has the oldest [[University of Basel|university]] of the Swiss Confederation (1460).

The official language of Basel is (the Swiss variety of Standard) [[Swiss Standard German|German]], but the main spoken language is the local variant of the [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] [[Swiss German (linguistics)|Swiss German]] dialect.

Basel is among the most important cultural centres of Switzerland. The city comprises a large number of theatres and [[Museums in Basel|many museums]], including the [[Kunstmuseum Basel|Museum of Fine Arts]], the world's oldest art collection accessible to the public. In addition, the [[Theater Basel]] was chosen in 1999 as the best stage for German-language performances and in 2009 & 2010 as "Opera of the Year" by German Opera Magazine "Opernwelt".<ref>[http://www.basel-virtuell.ch/en/culture Basel: culture pure] basel-virtuell.ch.

==History==
{{See also|Timeline of Basel}}

=== Early history ===
[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - BASILEA.png|thumb|1493 woodcut of the City of Basel, from the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]].]]
During the days of the [[Roman Empire]], the settlement of [[Augusta Raurica]] was founded {{convert|10|to|20|km|0|abbr=on}} upstream of present Basel, and a castle was built on the hill overlooking the river where the [[Basel Münster]] now stands. But even older [[Celts|Celt]]ic settlements (including a [[vitrified fort]]) have been discovered recently in the [[Basel oppidum|area predating the Roman castle]].

The town of Basel was called ''Basilea'' or ''Basilia'' in [[Latin]] (from [[Ancient Greek]] ''Basileia'', ''Βασιλεια'' meaning ''kingship'') and this name is documented from 374 AD.<ref>''The Encyclopedia Americana'', Grolier Incorporated 1999, p.308,</ref>

The [[Magyars]] destroyed Basel in 917, and later burnt down the monasteries of [[St. Gallen]] and [[Rheinau, Switzerland|Rheinau]]. Their incursions only ended when they [[Battle of Lechfeld|were routed]] by the German king [[Otto I]] in 955.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swissworld.org/en/history/alamans_to_the_holy_roman_empire/foreign_invasions/ |title=Foreign invasions - Switzerland - Information |publisher=Swissworld.org |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref>

Since the donation by [[Rudolph III of Burgundy]]{{sfnb|Wood|2006|pp=285-286, 313}} of the [[Moutier-Grandval Abbey]] and all its possessions to Bishop Adalbero II in 999 till the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], Basel was ruled by [[Prince-Bishop|prince-bishop]]s (see [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Basel|Bishop of Basel]],<ref>''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'', [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], 1993, p.659</ref> whose memory is preserved in the [[crosier]] shown on the Basel [[coat of arms|coat-of-arms]] – see above).

===Prince-Bishopric of Basel===
{{main| Prince-Bishopric of Basel }}
In 1019, the construction of the [[Basel Minster|cathedral of Basel]] (known locally as the ''Münster'') began under [[List of German monarchs|German Emperor]] [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Heinrich II]].<ref>Franz Kugler, ''[[Kleine Schriften]] und Studien zur Kunstgeschichte'', 1853, p. 486</ref>
In 1225–1226, the Bridge over the Rhine was constructed by Bishop Heinrich von Thun and lesser Basel (Kleinbasel) founded as a bridgehead to protect the bridge. The bridge was largely funded by Basel's Jewish community which had settled there a century earlier.<ref name="habicht">Habicht, Peter, ''Basel - A Center at the Fringe '' (Basel: Christoph Merian Verlag, 2006) pp. 43, 55, 70, 79.</ref> For many centuries to come Basel possessed the only permanent bridge over the river "between [[Lake Constance]] and the sea".

The Bishop also allowed the furriers to found a guild in 1226. Eventually about 15 guilds were established in the 13th century. They increased the town's, and hence the bishop's, reputation, influence, and income from the taxes and duties on goods in Basel's expanding market.<ref name="habicht"/>

In 1347, the plague came to Europe but did not reach Basel until June 1349. The guilds, asserting that the Jews were responsible—several had been tortured and confessed—demanded they be executed, which the Council did in January 1349, except for a few who escaped to Alsace.<ref name="habicht"/>  During the [[Basel massacre]], 600 Jews were murdered. They were shackled inside a wooden barn on an island in the Rhine, which was set afire. The few survivors - young orphans - were forcibly converted to Christianity.
The council then forbade Jews in Basel for 200 years, except that their money was helpful in rebuilding after the [[1356 Basel earthquake|Basel earthquake]] of 1356 which destroyed much of the city along with a [[Rötteln Castle|number of castles]] in the vicinity. The city offered courts to nobles as an alternative to rebuilding their castles, in exchange for the nobles' military protection of the city.

In 1412 (or earlier), the well-known guesthouse ''Zum Goldenen Sternen'' was established.
Basel became the focal point of western Christendom during the 15th century [[Council of Florence|Council of Basel]] (1431–1449), including the 1439 election of [[antipope Felix V]].
In 1459, [[Pope Pius II]] endowed the [[University of Basel]] where such notables as [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]] of [[Rotterdam]] and [[Paracelsus]] later taught. At the same time the new craft of [[printing press|printing]] was [[Global spread of the printing press|introduced to Basel]] by apprentices of [[Johann Gutenberg]].

The Schwabe publishing house was founded in 1488 by Johannes Petri and is the oldest publishing house still in business. [[Johann Froben]] also operated his printing house in Basel and was notable for publishing works by Erasmus.<ref>Josef Nadler, ''Literaturgeschichte der deutschen Schweiz'', Grethlein 1932</ref> In 1495, Basel was incorporated in the Upper Rhenish [[Imperial Circle]]; the Bishop of Basel was added to the Bench of the Ecclesiastical Princes. In 1500 the construction of the [[Basel Münster]] was finished. In 1521 so was the bishop. The Council, under the supremacy of the guilds, explained that henceforth they would only give allegiance to the Swiss Confederation, to whom the bishop appealed but in vain.<ref name="habicht"/>

===As a member state in the Swiss Confederacy===
[[File:Merian Basel 1642.jpg|thumb|Map of Basel in 1642, engraved by [[Matthäus Merian]], oriented with SW at the top and NE at the bottom.]]
The city had remained neutral through the [[Swabian War]] of 1499 despite being plundered by soldiers on both sides. The [[Treaty of Basel (1499)|Treaty of Basel]] ended the war and granted the Swiss confederates exemptions from the emperor Maximillian's taxes and jurisdictions, separating Switzerland de facto from the Holy Roman Empire.<ref name="Rappard">Rappard, William, '' Collective Security in Swiss Experience 1291–1948'' (London, 1948) p. 85 ff</ref>

On 9 June 1501, Basel joined the Swiss Confederation as its [[Canton of Basel|eleventh canton]].<ref>Karl Strupp, ''Wörterbuch Des Völkerrechts'', De Gruyter 1960, p.225</ref> It was the only canton that had been asked to join, not the other way round. Basel had a strategic location, good relations with Strasbourg and Mulhouse, and control of the corn imports from Alsace, whereas the Swiss lands were becoming overpopulated and had few resources. For its part, Basel secured the military help of the other cantons when threatened, and some protection for its rural subjects outside its walls. A provision of the Charter accepting Basel required that in conflicts among the other cantons it was to stay neutral and offer its services for mediation.<ref name=autogenerated1>Habicht, Peter, ''Basel - A Center at the Fringe'' (Basel 2006) p. 65 ff</ref><ref name="Bonjour">Bonjour, Edgar ''et al.'' ''A short History of Switzerland'' (Oxford, 1952) p. 139 ff</ref>

In 1503, the new bishop [[Christoph von Utenheim]] refused to give Basel a new constitution whereupon, to show its power, the city began the construction of a new city hall.<ref name="habicht"/>

In 1529, the city became Protestant under [[Johannes Oecolampadius|Oecolampadius]] and the bishop's seat was moved to Porrentruy. The bishop's crook was however retained as the city's coat of arms. For the centuries to come, a handful of wealthy families collectively referred to as the [[Daig (Switzerland)|"Daig"]] played a pivotal role in city affairs as they gradually established themselves as a ''de facto'' [[Aristocracy|city aristocracy]].

The first edition of ''Christianae religionis institutio'' (''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]'' – [[John Calvin]]'s great exposition of [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] doctrine) was published at Basel in March 1536.<ref>Geoffrey Rudolph Elton, Harold Fullard, Henry Clifford Darby, Charles Loch Mowat, ''[[The New Cambridge Modern History]]'', 1990, p. 113</ref>

In 1544, Johann von Brugge a rich Dutch Protestant refugee was given citizenship and lived respectfully until his death in 1556 then buried with honors. His body was exhumed and burnt at the stake in 1559 after it was discovered that he was the Anabaptist [[David Joris]].<ref name="habicht"/>

In 1543, ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'', the first book on human anatomy, was published and printed in Basel by [[Andreas Vesalius]] (1514–1564).<ref>''The Illustrations from the Works of Andreas Vesalius of Brussels'', Courier Dover Publications 1973, p.30</ref>

There are indications [[Joachim Meyer]], author of the influential 16th century [[martial arts]] text ''Kunst des Fechten'' ("The Art of Fencing") came from Basel. In 1662 the ''Amerbaschsches Kabinett'' was established in Basel as the first public museum of art. Its collection became the core of the later Basel Museum of Art.

The Bernoulli family, which included important 17th and 18th century of mathematicians such as [[Jakob Bernoulli]], [[Johann Bernoulli]] and [[Daniel Bernoulli]], were from Basel. The 18th century mathematician [[Leonhard Euler]] was born in Basel and studied under Johann Bernoulli.

===Modern history===
In 1792, the [[Rauracian Republic|Republic of Rauracia]], a revolutionary [[French client republic]], was created. It lasted until 1793.<ref>Heinrich Zschokke, Emil Zschokke, ''The History of Switzerland, for the Swiss People'', S. Low, Son & Co. 1855, p.253</ref> After three years of political agitation and a short civil war in 1833 the disadvantaged countryside seceded from the Canton of Basel, forming the half canton of [[Basel-Landschaft]].<ref>Heinrich Türler, Marcel Godet, Victor Attinger, ''Historisch-biographisches Lexikon der Schweiz'', 1934, p.307</ref>

On 3 July 1874, Switzerland's first zoo (the [[Zoo Basel]]) opened its doors in the south of the city towards [[Binningen]].

In 1897 the first World Zionist Congress was held in Basel.<ref>{{cite web |title=Erster Zionistenkongress 1897 - Die Idee eines Judenstaates |url=http://www.domradio.de/radio/sendungen/anno-domini/die-idee-eines-judenstaates-erster-zionistenkongress-1897 |date=31 August 2015 |author=Ina Rottscheidt |publisher=domradio.de |location=Cologne, Germany |language=German |accessdate=2015-09-06}}</ref>

On 16 November 1938, the psychedelic drug [[LSD]] was first synthesized by Swiss chemist [[Albert Hofmann]] at [[Sandoz]] Laboratories in Basel.

===Basel as a historical, international meeting place===
Basel has often been the site of peace negotiations and other international meetings. The [[Treaty of Basel (1499)]] ended the [[Swabian War]]. Two years later Basel joined the [[Switzerland|Swiss Confederation]]. The [[Peace of Basel]] in 1795 between the French Republic and Prussia and Spain ended the [[First Coalition]] against France during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. In more recent times, the [[World Zionist Organization]] held its first congress in Basel on 3 September 1897. Because of the [[Balkan Wars]], the [[Second International]] held an extraordinary congress at Basel in 1912. In 1989, the [[Basel Convention]] was opened for signature with the aim of preventing the export of [[hazardous waste]] from wealthy to [[developing country|developing nations]] for disposal.

==Politics==
Geo-politically, the city of Basel functions as the capital of the [[Cantons of Switzerland|Swiss half-canton]] of [[Basel-City|Basel-Stadt]], though several of its [[suburb]]s are located in the half-canton of [[Basel-Country|Basel-Landschaft]] or the canton of [[Aargau]]. Others are even located in [[France]] and [[Germany]].

===Canton===
The canton Basel-City consists of three municipalities: [[Riehen]], [[Bettingen]], and the city Basel itself. The political structure and agencies of the city and the canton are identical.

===City===

====Quarters====
The city itself has 19 quarters:

*''Grossbasel'' (Greater Basel):

{{colbegin|3}}
:Altstadt (1)
:Vorstädte (2)
:Am Ring (3)
:Breite (4)
:St. Alban (5)
:Gundeldingen (6)
:Bruderholz (7)
:Bachletten (8)
:Gotthelf (9)
:Iselin (10)

===Coat of arms===
The [[blazon]] of the municipal [[coat of arms]] is ''In Silber ein schwarzer Baselstab.''<ref>[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/ch-bs001.html Flags of the World.com] accessed 18-April-2011</ref>

===Government===
The canton's executive, the Executive Council ('''Regierungsrat'''), consists of seven members for a mandate period of 4 years. They are elected by any inhabitant valid to vote on the same day as the parliament and operates as a collegiate authority. The president ({{lang-de|Regierungspräsident(in)}}) is elected as such by a public election while the heads of the other departments are assigned by the collegiate. Current president is Dr. Guy Morin. The executive body holds its meetings in the red Town Hall (''Rathaus'') on the central ''Marktplatz''. The building was built in 1504–1514.

===Transport===
Basel's airport is set up for airfreight; heavy goods reach the city and the heart of [[continental Europe]] from [[North Sea|the North Sea]] by ship along the Rhine. The main European routes for the highway and railway transport of freight cross in Basel. The outstanding location benefits logistics corporations, which operate globally from Basel. Trading firms are traditionally well represented in the Basel Region.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

====Port====
[[File:Rhine Rhein Basel 2006 871.JPG|thumb|The [[Rhine]] in Basel]]
Basel has Switzerland's only cargo port, through which goods pass along the navigable stretches of the [[Rhine]] and connect to ocean-going ships at the port of [[Rotterdam]].

====Air transport====
[[EuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg]] is operated jointly by two countries, France and Switzerland, although the airport is located completely on French soil. The airport itself is split into two architecturally independent sectors, one half serving the French side and the other half serving the Swiss side; prior to [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen]] there was a customs point at the middle of the airport so that people could "emigrate" to the other side of the airport.

====Railways====
[[File:Basle Bahnhof Trainstation Switzerland.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Basel SBB railway station|Basel Bahnhof SBB]], self-proclaimed "world's first international railway station."]]
Basel has long held an important place as a rail hub. Three railway stations — those of the German, French and Swiss networks — lie within the city (although the Swiss ([[Basel SBB railway station|Basel SBB]]) and French ([[Basel SBB railway station|Bâle SNCF]]) stations are actually in the same complex, separated by Customs and [[Immigration]] facilities). [[Basel Badischer Bahnhof]] is on the opposite side of the city. Basel's local rail services are supplied by the [[Basel Regional S-Bahn]]. The largest goods railway complex of the country {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} is located just outside the city, spanning the municipalities of Muttenz and Pratteln. The new highspeed ICE railway line from Karlsruhe to Basel was completed in 2008 while phase I of the [[LGV Rhin-Rhône|TGV Rhin-Rhône]] line, opened in December 2011, has reduced travel time from Basel to Paris to about 3 hours.<ref>[http://www.infolignes.com/recherche.php?date_num_train=2012|05|14&type_heure=1&train_horaire_depart=14|00&next_horaire=14|00&num_train=9218 SNCF website, TGV Lyria 9218] accessed 14 May 2012</ref>

====Roads====
Basel is located on the [[A3 motorway (Switzerland)|A3 motorway]].

Within the city limits, five bridges connect greater and lesser Basel, from upstream to downstream:
* Schwarzwaldbrücke (built 1972)
* Wettsteinbrücke (current structure built 1998, original bridge built 1879)
* Mittlere Brücke (current structure built 1905, original bridge built 1225 as the first bridge to cross the Rhine River)
* Johanniterbrücke (built 1967)
* Dreirosenbrücke (built 2004, original bridge built 1935)

====Ferries====
A somewhat anachronistic yet still widely used system of ferry boats links the two shores. There are four ferries, each situated approximately midway between two bridges. Each is attached by a cable to a block that rides along another cable spanning the river at a height of 20 or 30 metres. To cross the river, the ferryman orients the boat around 45° from the current so that the current pushes the boat across the river. This form of transportation is therefore completely hydraulically driven, requiring no outside energy source.

====Public transport====
[[File:Basel - Straßenbahn - Netzplan 2009.png|thumb|Basel tram network]]
Basel has an extensive public transportation network serving the city and connecting to surrounding suburbs, including a large [[Basel Trams|tram network]]. The green-colored local [[light rail|trams]] and buses are operated by the [[Basler Verkehrs-Betriebe]] (BVB). The yellow-colored buses and trams are operated by the [[Baselland Transport]] (BLT), and connect areas in the nearby half-canton of Baselland to central Basel. The BVB also shares commuter bus lines in cooperation with transit authorities in the neighboring [[Alsace]] region in [[France]] and [[Baden]] region in [[Germany]]. The [[Basel Regional S-Bahn]], the commuter rail network connecting to suburbs surrounding the city, is jointly operated by [[Schweizerische Bundesbahnen|SBB]], [[SNCF]] and [[Deutsche Bahn|DB]].

====Border crossings====
Basel is located at the meeting point of France, Germany and Switzerland; because it is so near other countries and is beyond the [[Jura Mountains]], many within the [[Swiss military]] reportedly believe that the city is indefensible during wartime.<ref name="mcphee19831031">{{cite news | url=http://archives.newyorker.com/default.aspx?iid=16248&startpage=page0000103#folio=050 | title=La Place de la Concorde Suisse-I | work=The New Yorker | date=31 October 1983 | accessdate=22 July 2013 | author=McPhee, John | pages=50}}</ref> It has numerous road and rail crossings between Switzerland and the other two countries. With Switzerland joining the [[Schengen Area]] on 12 December 2008, immigration checks were no longer carried out at the crossings. However, Switzerland did not join the [[European Union Customs Union]] (though it did join the [[EU Single Market]]) and customs checks are still conducted at or near the crossings.

===Energy===
Basel is at the forefront of a national vision to more than halve [[energy|energy use]] in Switzerland by 2050. In order to research, develop and commercialise the technologies and techniques required for the country to become a '[[2000-watt society|2000 Watt society]]', a number of projects have been set up since 2001 in the Basel metropolitan area. These including demonstration buildings constructed to ''[[Minergie|MINERGIE]]'' or ''[[Passive house|Passivhaus]]'' standards, [[electricity]] generation from [[renewable energy]] sources,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/front/detail/swissinfo.html?siteSect=105&sid=7407138|title=Geothermal project shakes Basel again|work=SWI swissinfo.ch|accessdate=1 September 2015}}</ref> and vehicles using [[natural gas]], [[hydrogen economy|hydrogen]] and [[biogas]].<ref>[http://www.basel.ch/en/basel/urban_development/2000_watt_society The Basel pilot region of the 2000 Watt Society]  {{wayback|url=http://www.basel.ch/en/basel/urban_development/2000_watt_society |date=20130530222350 }}</ref>

A [[Enhanced geothermal systems|hot dry rock geothermal energy]] project was cancelled in 2009 since it caused [[induced seismicity in Basel]].

===Banking===
Banking is extremely important to Basel:
* [[UBS AG]] maintains central offices in Basel,<ref>"[https://apps2.ubs.com/locationfinder/search.do?GeoEntityId=29&GeoEntityType=6 UBS AG in Basel, Aeschenvorstadt 1]." ([https://apps2.ubs.com/locationfinder/search.do?GeoEntityId=6592&GeoEntityType=7&EntityTypeId=0&Type=pdf PDF version]) [[UBS AG]]. Retrieved on 2 July 2010.</ref>
* The [[Bank for International Settlements]] is located within the city and is the central banker's bank. The bank is controlled by a [[board of directors]], which is composed of the elite central bankers of 11 different countries (US, UK, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden).
:According to the BIS, "The choice of Switzerland for the seat of the BIS was a compromise by those countries that established the BIS: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. When consensus could not be reached on locating the Bank in London, Brussels or Amsterdam, the choice fell on Switzerland. An independent, neutral country, Switzerland offered the BIS less exposure to undue influence from any of the major powers. Within Switzerland, Basel was chosen largely because of its location, with excellent railway connections in all directions, especially important at a time when most international travel was by train."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.org/about/origins.htm|title=Origins|publisher=Bank for International Settlements|accessdate=23 May 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100609010907/http://www.bis.org/about/origins.htm| archivedate= 9 June 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref>
:Created in May 1930, the BIS is owned by its member [[central bank]]s, which are private entities. No agent of the Swiss public authorities may enter the premises without the express consent of the bank.<ref>[http://www.bis.org/about/headquart-en.pdf Agreement between the Swiss Federal Council and the Bank for International Settlements to determine the Bank’s legal status in Switzerland]</ref> The bank exercises supervision and police power over its premises. The bank enjoys immunity from criminal and administrative jurisdiction{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}, as well as setting recommendations which become standard for the world's [[commercial bank]]ing system.
* Basel is also the location of the [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]], which is distinct from the BIS. It usually meets at the BIS premises in Basel.

===Theatre and Music===
[[File:Sinfonieorchester Basel 1 (c) Benno Hunziker.jpg|thumb|Symphony Orchestra Basel]]
Basel has a thriving cultural life. (In 1997, it contended to become the "[[European Capital of Culture]]", though the honor went instead to [[Thessaloniki]]) Basel is the home of the [[Schola Cantorum Basiliensis]], founded in 1933, a worldwide centre for research on and performance of music from the Medieval through the Baroque eras. [[Theater Basel]] presents a busy schedule of [[play (theatre)|play]]s in addition to being home to the city's [[opera]] and [[ballet]] companies.  Basel is home to the largest orchestra in Switzerland, the [[Sinfonieorchester Basel]]. It is also the home of the [[Kammerorchester Basel]], which is recording the complete symphonies of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] for the [[Sony]] label led by its music director [[Giovanni Antonini]]. The Schola Cantorum and the [[Basler Kammerorchester]] were both founded by the conductor [[Paul Sacher]] who went on to commission works by many leading composers. The Paul Sacher Foundation, opened in 1986, houses a major collection of manuscripts, including the entire [[Igor Stravinsky]] archive.
The baroque orchestras La Cetra and Capriccio Basel are also based in Basel. In May 2004, the fifth European Festival of Youth Choirs (Europäisches Jugendchorfestival, or EJCF) choir festival opened: this Basel tradition started in 1992. Host of this festival is the local [[Basel Boys Choir]].

===Museums===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of museums]] -->
[[File:Basel Kunstmuseum 13-05-2008.jpg|thumb|Kunstmuseum]]
The [[Museums in Basel|Basel museums]] cover a broad and diverse spectrum of [[collection (museum)|collections]] with a marked concentration in the [[fine art]]s. They house numerous holdings of international significance. The over three dozen institutions yield an extraordinarily high density of museums compared to other cities of similar size and draw over one million visitors annually.<ref name=Museums>{{cite web |url=http://www.bs.ch/en/Portrait/Kultur/Museen.html |title=A lot to see in such a small city |publisher=Canton of Basel-City |type=official site |website=Kanton Basel-Stadt |accessdate=2015-08-31}}</ref>

Constituting an essential component of Basel culture and cultural policy, the museums are the result of closely interwoven private and public collecting activities and promotion of arts and culture going back to the 16th century. The public museum collection was first created back in 1661 and represents the oldest public collection in continuous existence. Since the late 1980s, various private collections have been made accessible to the public in new purpose-built structures that have been recognized as acclaimed examples of [[avant-garde]] [[museum architecture]].

===Events===
The [[carnival]] of the city of Basel (''[[Carnival of Basel|Basler Fasnacht]]'') is a major cultural event in the year. The carnival is the biggest in Switzerland and attracts large crowds every year, despite the fact that it starts at exactly four in the morning (''Morgestraich'') on a winter Monday. The Fasnacht asserts Basel's Protestant history by commencing the revelry five days after Ash Wednesday and continuing day and night for exactly 72 hours. Almost all study and work in the old city cease. Dozens of fife and drum clubs parade in medieval guild tradition with fantastical masks and illuminated lanterns, eventually yielding to other loud and irreverent festivity. Basel is also host to the [[Basel tattoo|Basel Tattoo]] and a number of fairs.

===Cuisine===
There are a number of culinary specialties originating in Basel, including ''[[Basler Läckerli]]'' cookies and ''[[Mässmogge]]'' candies.

===Zoo===
[[File:ZolliAntelopeHouse2.JPG|thumb|the [[Antelope]] House at [[Zoo Basel]]]]
''[[Zoo Basel]]'' is, with over 1.7 million visitors per year,<ref name="2011 visitors">[http://bazonline.ch/basel/stadt/Trotz-Grossbaustelle-Besucherrekord-beim-Zolli/story/10759447 {{de icon}} Besucherrekord beim Zolli]. [[Basler Zeitung]], published 23 February 2012</ref> the most visited tourist attraction in Basel and the second most visited tourist attraction in Switzerland.<ref name="visitors">[http://www.20min.ch/news/basel/story/25637966 {{de icon}} Zolli beliebt]. [[20 Minuten|20min.ch]], published 23 February 2009</ref>

Established in 1874, Zoo Basel is the oldest zoo in Switzerland and, by number of animals, the largest. Through its history, Zoo Basel has had several breeding successes, such as the first worldwide [[Indian rhinoceros]] birth<ref name="Panzernashornhaus">[http://www.zoobasel.ch/aktuell/detail.php?NEWSID=37 {{de icon}} Eröffnung des Panzernashornhauses]. Zoo Basel, written 2006-09-26, retrieved 3 December 2009</ref> and [[Greater flamingo]] hatch<ref>{{cite news |url=http://bazonline.ch/basel/dossier/zoo-basel/Zolli-feiert-50-Jahre-Flamingozucht-und-Flamingosforschung/story/26419827|title=Zoo celebrates 50 years of flamingo breeding|newspaper=Basler Zeitung|date= 13 August 2008 |accessdate=21 March 2010|language=de}}</ref> in a zoo. These and other achievements led [[Forbes]] Travel to rank Zoo Basel as one of the fifteen best zoos in the world in 2008.<ref name="Forbes">[http://www.getlisty.com/preview/worlds-best-zoos/ Forbes Travel]. GetListy, retrieved 26 March 2010</ref>

Despite its international fame, Basel's population remains attached to Zoo Basel, which is entirely surrounded by the city of Basel.  Evidence of this is the millions of donations money each year, as well as Zoo Basel's unofficial name: locals lovingly call "their" zoo "''Zolli''" by which is it known throughout Basel and most of Switzerland.

===Sport===
Basel has a reputation in Switzerland as a successful sporting city. The [[association football|football]] club [[FC Basel]] continues to be successful and in recognition of this the city was one of the Swiss venues for the [[UEFA Euro 2008|2008 European Championships]], as well as [[Geneva]], [[Zürich]] and [[Bern]]. The championships were jointly hosted by [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]]. [[BSC Old Boys]] and [[Concordia Basel]] are the other football teams in Basel.

Among the most popular sports in Switzerland is [[Ice hockey]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://popular-swiss-sports.all-about-switzerland.info/|title= Popular sports in Switzerland | publisher=popular-swiss-sports.all-about-switzerland.info | accessdate=10 July 2011}}</ref> Basel is home to the [[EHC Basel]] which plays in the Swiss [[Swiss 1. Liga (ice hockey)|Premier League]]. They play their home games in the 6,700-seat [[St. Jakob Arena]].

Basel features a large football [[St. Jakob-Park|stadium]] that has been awarded four stars by [[UEFA]], a modern [[ice hockey]] hall, and an admitted sports hall.

A large indoor tennis event takes place in Basel every October. Some of the best [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]]-Professionals play every year at the [[Davidoff Swiss Indoors|Swiss Indoors]], including Switzerland's biggest sporting hero and frequent participant [[Roger Federer]], a Basel native who describes the city as "one of the most beautiful cities in the world".

The annual [[Basel Rhine Swim]] draws several thousand visitors to the city to swim in or float on the [[Rhine]] river.<ref>{{cite web|title=Swimming in the Rhine in Basel|url=http://www.lifeinbasel.com/2014/06/09/swimming-in-the-rhine-in-basel/|publisher=Life in Basel|accessdate=24 July 2015}}</ref>
