The Gaussian theory, however, is only true so long as the angles made by all rays with the optical axis (the symmetrical axis of the system) are infinitely small, i.e. with infinitesimal objects, images and lenses; in practice these conditions may not be realized, and the images projected by uncorrected systems are, in general, ill defined and often completely blurred, if the aperture or field of view exceeds certain limits.</paragraph><paragraph>The investigations of<space/><link><target>James Clerk Maxwell</target></link><space/>(<italics>Phil.Mag.,</italics><space/>1856;<space/><italics>Quart.

These authors proved, however, that no optical system can justify these suppositions, since they are contradictory to the fundamental laws of reflection and refraction. Consequently the Gaussian theory only supplies a convenient method of approximating to reality; and no constructor would attempt to realize this unattainable ideal. At present, all that can be attempted is to reproduce a single plane in another plane; but even this has not been altogether satisfactorily accomplished, aberrations always occur, and it is improbable that these will ever be entirely corrected.</paragraph><paragraph>This, and related general questions, have been treated besides the above-mentioned authors by M.

If there is refraction at a collective spherical surface, or through a thin positive lens, O'2 will lie in front of O'1 so long as the angle u2 is greater than u1 (<italics>under correction</italics>); and conversely with a dispersive surface or lenses (<italics>over correction</italics>). The caustic, in the first case, resembles the sign &gt; (greater than); in the second &lt; (less than). If the angle u1 is very small, O'1 is the Gaussian image; and O'1 O'2 is termed the<space/><italics>longitudinal aberration,</italics><space/>and O'1R the<space/><italics>lateral aberration</italics><space/>of the<space/><link><target>Pencil (physics)</target><part>pencils</part></link><space/>with aperture u2. If the pencil with the angle u2 is that of the maximum aberration of all the pencils transmitted, then in a plane perpendicular to the axis at O'1 there is a circular<space/><italics>disk of confusion</italics><space/>of radius O'1R, and in a parallel plane at O'2 another one of radius O'2R2; between these two is situated the<space/><italics>disk of least confusion.</italics></paragraph><paragraph>The largest opening of the pencils, which take part in the reproduction of O, i.e. the angle u, is generally determined by the margin of one of the lenses or by a hole in a thin plate placed between, before, or behind the lenses of the system. This hole is termed the<space/><italics>stop</italics><space/>or<space/><italics>diaphragm</italics>; Abbe used the term<space/><italics><link><target>aperture</target></link><space/>stop</italics><space/>for both the hole and the limiting margin of the lens. The component S1 of the system, situated between the aperture stop and the object O, projects an image of the diaphragm, termed by Abbe the<space/><italics>entrance pupil</italics>; the<space/><italics>exit pupil</italics><space/>is the image formed by the component S2, which is placed behind the aperture stop. All rays which issue from O and pass through the aperture stop also pass through the entrance and exit pupils, since these are images of the aperture stop. Since the maximum aperture of the pencils issuing from O is the angle u subtended by the entrance pupil at this point, the magnitude of the aberration will be determined by the position and diameter of the entrance pupil. If the system be entirely behind the aperture stop, then this is itself the entrance pupil (<italics>front stop</italics>); if entirely in front, it is the exit pupil (<italics>back stop</italics>).</paragraph><paragraph>If the object point be infinitely distant, all rays received by the first member of the system are parallel, and their intersections, after traversing the system, vary according to their<space/><italics>perpendicular height of incidence,</italics><space/>i.e. their distance from the axis. This distance replaces the angle u in the preceding considerations; and the aperture, i.e. the radius of the entrance pupil, is its maximum value.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Aberration of elements, i.e. smallest objects at right angles to the axis</heading><paragraph>If rays issuing from O (fig. 5) be concurrent, it does not follow that points in a portion of a plane perpendicular at O to the axis will be also concurrent, even if the part of the plane be very small. With a considerable aperture, the neighboring point N will be reproduced, but attended by aberrations comparable in magnitude to ON. These aberrations are avoided if, according to Abbe, the<space/><italics>sine condition,</italics><space/>sin u'1/sin u1=sin u'2/sin u2, holds for all rays reproducing the point O. If the object point O is infinitely distant, u1 and u2 are to be replaced by h1 and h2, the perpendicular heights of incidence; the<space/><italics>sine condition</italics><space/>then becomes sin u'1/h1=sin u'2/h2. A system fulfilling this condition and free from spherical aberration is called<space/><italics>aplanatic</italics><space/>(Greek a-, privative, plann, a wandering). This word was first used by<space/><link><target>Robert Blair (astronomer)</target><part>Robert Blair</part></link><space/>(d. 1828), professor of practical astronomy at Edinburgh University, to characterize a superior achromatism, and, subsequently, by many writers to denote freedom from spherical aberration. Both the aberration of axis points, and the deviation from the sine condition, rapidly increase in most (uncorrected) systems with the aperture.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Aberration of lateral object points (points beyond the axis) with narrow pencils. Astigmatism.</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:ABERR2.svg</target><part>right</part><part>frame</part><part>Figure 6</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>A point O (fig. 6) at a finite distance from the axis (or with an infinitely distant object, a point which subtends a finite angle at the system) is, in general, even then not sharply reproduced, if the pencil of rays issuing from it and traversing the system is made infinitely narrow by reducing the aperture stop; such a pencil consists of the rays which can pass from the object point through the now infinitely small entrance pupil. It is seen (ignoring exceptional cases) that the pencil does not meet the refracting or reflecting surface at right angles; therefore it is astigmatic (Gr. a-, privative, stigmia, a point). Naming the central ray passing through the entrance pupil the<space/><italics>axis of the pencil</italics><space/>or<space/><italics>principal ray,</italics><space/>it can be said: the rays of the pencil intersect, not in one point, but in two focal lines, which can be assumed to be at right angles to the principal ray; of these, one lies in the plane containing the principal ray and the axis of the system, i.e. in the<space/><italics>first principal section</italics><space/>or<space/><italics>meridional section</italics>, and the other at right angles to it, i.e. in the second principal section or sagittal section. We receive, therefore, in no single intercepting plane behind the system, as, for example, a focusing screen, an image of the object point; on the other hand, in each of two planes lines O' and O&quot; are separately formed (in neighboring planes ellipses are formed), and in a plane between O' and O&quot; a circle of least confusion. The interval O'O&quot;, termed the astigmatic difference, increases, in general, with the angle W made by the principal ray OP with the axis of the system, i.e. with the field of view. Two<space/><italics>astigmatic image surfaces</italics><space/>correspond to one object plane; and these are in contact at the axis point; on the one lie the focal lines of the first kind, on the other those of the second.

In pinhole projection, the magnification of an object is inversely proportional to its distance to the camera along the optical axis so that a camera pointing directly at a flat surface reproduces that flat surface. Distortion can be thought of as stretching the image non-uniformly, or, equivalently, as a variation in magnification across the field. While &quot;distortion&quot; can include arbitrary deformation of an image, the most pronounced modes of distortion produced by conventional imaging optics is &quot;barrel distortion&quot;, in which the center of the image is magnified more than the perimeter (figure 7a). The reverse, in which the perimeter is magnified more than the center, is known as &quot;pincushion distortion&quot; (figure 7b). This effect is called lens distortion or<space/><link><target>image distortion</target></link>, and there are<space/><link type='external' href='http://www.vassg.hu/pdf/vass_gg_2003_lo.pdf'>algorithms</link><space/>to correct it.</paragraph><paragraph>Systems free of distortion are called<space/><italics>orthoscopic</italics><space/>(orthos, right, skopein to look) or<space/><italics>rectilinear</italics><space/>(straight lines).</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:ABERR3rev.svg</target><part>left</part><part>frame</part><part>Figure 8</part></link>This aberration is quite distinct from that of the sharpness of reproduction; in unsharp, reproduction, the question of distortion arises if only parts of the object can be recognized in the figure. If, in an unsharp image, a patch of light corresponds to an object point, the<space/><italics>center of gravity</italics><space/>of the patch may be regarded as the image point, this being the point where the plane receiving the image, e.g., a focusing screen, intersects the ray passing through the middle of the stop. This assumption is justified if a poor image on the focusing screen remains stationary when the aperture is diminished; in practice, this generally occurs. This ray, named by Abbe a<space/><italics>principal ray</italics><space/>(not to be confused with the<space/><italics>principal rays</italics><space/>of the Gaussian theory), passes through the center of the entrance pupil before the first refraction, and the center of the exit pupil after the last refraction. From this it follows that correctness of drawing depends solely upon the principal rays; and is independent of the sharpness or curvature of the image field. Referring to fig. 8, we have O'Q'/OQ = a' tan w'/a tan w = 1/N, where N is the<space/><italics>scale</italics><space/>or magnification of the image. For N to be constant for all values of w, a' tan w'/a tan w must also be constant. If the ratio a'/a be sufficiently constant, as is often the case, the above relation reduces to the<space/><italics>condition of<space/><link><target>George Biddell Airy</target><part>Airy</part></link>,</italics><space/>i.e. tan w'/ tan w= a constant. This simple relation (see Camb. Phil. Trans., 1830, 3, p.&amp;nbsp;1) is fulfilled in all systems which are symmetrical with respect to their diaphragm (briefly named<space/><italics>symmetrical or holosymmetrical objectives</italics>), or which consist of two like, but different-sized, components, placed from the diaphragm in the ratio of their size, and presenting the same curvature to it (hemisymmetrical objectives); in these systems tan w' / tan w = 1.</paragraph><paragraph>The constancy of a'/a necessary for this relation to hold was pointed out by R. H. Bow (Brit. Journ. Photog., 1861), and Thomas Sutton (Photographic Notes, 1862); it has been treated by O. Lummer and by M. von Rohr (Zeit. f. Instrumentenk., 1897, 17, and 1898, 18, p.&amp;nbsp;4). It requires the middle of the aperture stop to be reproduced in the centers of the entrance and exit pupils without spherical aberration. M. von Rohr showed that for systems fulfilling neither the Airy nor the Bow-Sutton condition, the ratio a' cos w'/a tan w will be constant for one distance of the object. This combined condition is exactly fulfilled by holosymmetrical objectives reproducing with the scale 1, and by hemisymmetrical, if the scale of reproduction be equal to the ratio of the sizes of the two components.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Zernike model of aberrations</heading><paragraph>Circular wavefront profiles associated with aberrations may be mathematically modeled using<space/><link><target>Zernike polynomial</target><trail>s</trail></link>.

An extended theory that allows the calculation of the point image amplitude and intensity over a much larger volume in the focal region was recently developed (<link type='external' href='http://www.nijboerzernike.nl'>Extended Nijboer-Zernike theory</link>). This Extended Nijboer-Zernike theory of point image or point-spread function formation has found applications in general research on image formation, especially for systems with a high<space/><link><target>numerical aperture</target></link>, and in characterizing optical systems with respect to their aberrations.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="title">Principles of Optics: Electromagnetic Theory of Propagation, Interference and Diffraction of Light<space/></arg><arg name="first1">Max<space/></arg><arg name="last1">Born<space/></arg><arg name="first2">Emil<space/></arg><arg name="last2">Wolf<space/></arg><arg name="isbn">978-0521642224</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Analytic treatment of aberrations</heading><paragraph>The preceding review of the several errors of reproduction belongs to the<space/><italics>Abbe theory of aberrations,</italics><space/>in which definite aberrations are discussed separately; it is well suited to practical needs, for in the construction of an optical instrument certain errors are sought to be eliminated, the selection of which is justified by experience. In the mathematical sense, however, this selection is arbitrary; the reproduction of a finite object with a finite aperture entails, in all probability, an infinite number of aberrations. This number is only finite if the object and aperture are assumed to be<space/><italics>infinitely small of a certain order</italics>; and with each order of infinite smallness, i.e. with each degree of approximation to reality (to finite objects and apertures), a certain number of aberrations is associated.

Of this point O in an object plane I, at right angles to the axis, and two other coordinates (x, y), the point in which the ray intersects the entrance pupil, i.e. the plane II. Similarly the corresponding image ray may be defined by the points (', '), and (x', y'), in the planes I' and II'. The origins of these four plane coordinate systems may be collinear with the axis of the optical system; and the corresponding axes may be parallel. Each of the four coordinates ', ', x', y' are functions of , , x, y; and if it be assumed that the field of view and the aperture be infinitely small, then , , x, y are of the same order of infinitesimals; consequently by expanding ', ', x', y' in ascending powers of , , x, y, series are obtained in which it is only necessary to consider the lowest powers. It is readily seen that if the optical system be symmetrical, the origins of the coordinate systems collinear with the optical axis and the corresponding axes parallel, then by changing the signs of , , x, y, the values ', ', x', y' must likewise change their sign, but retain their arithmetical values; this means that the series are restricted to odd powers of the unmarked variables.</paragraph><paragraph>The nature of the reproduction consists in the rays proceeding from a point O being united in another point O'; in general, this will not be the case, for ', ' vary if , be constant, but x, y variable.

The images of the Gauss theory being of the third order, the next problem is to obtain an image of 5th order, or to make the coefficients of the powers of 3rd degree zero. This necessitates the satisfying of five equations; in other words, there are five alterations of the 3rd order, the vanishing of which produces an image of the 5th order.</paragraph><paragraph>The expression for these coefficients in terms of the constants of the optical system, i.e. the radii, thicknesses, refractive indices and distances between the lenses, was solved by<space/><link><target>Philipp Ludwig von Seidel</target><part>L.

Petzval constructed his portrait objective, from similar calculations which have never been published (see M. von Rohr,<space/><italics>Theorie und Geschichte des photographischen Objectivs</italics>, Berlin, 1899, p.&amp;nbsp;248). The theory was elaborated by S. Finterswalder (Munchen. Acad.

Konig and M. von Rohr (see M. von Rohr,<space/><italics>Die Bilderzeugung in optischen Instrumenten</italics>, pp.&amp;nbsp;317323) have represented Kerber's method, and have deduced the Seidel formulae from geometrical considerations based on the Abbe method, and have interpreted the analytical results geometrically (pp.&amp;nbsp;212316).</paragraph><paragraph>The aberrations can also be expressed by means of the<space/><italics>characteristic function</italics><space/>of the system and its differential coefficients, instead of by the radii, &amp;c., of the lenses; these formulae are not immediately applicable, but give, however, the relation between the number of aberrations and the order. Sir William Rowan Hamilton (British Assoc. Report, 1833, p.&amp;nbsp;360) thus derived the aberrations of the third order; and in later times the method was pursued by Clerk Maxwell (<italics>Proc.

It is very important in telescope design. In telescopes aperture is usually taken as the linear diameter of the objective. It is not the same as microscope aperture which is based on the entrance pupil or field of view as seen from the object and is expressed as an angular measurement. Higher order aberrations in telescope design can be mostly neglected. For microscopes it cannot be neglected. For a single lens of very small thickness and given power, the aberration depends upon the ratio of the radii r:r', and is a minimum (but never zero) for a certain value of this ratio; it varies inversely with the refractive index (the power of the lens remaining constant). The total aberration of two or more very thin lenses in contact, being the sum of the individual aberrations, can be zero. This is also possible if the lenses have the same algebraic sign. Of thin positive lenses with n=1.5, four are necessary to correct spherical aberration of the third order. These systems, however, are not of great practical importance. In most cases, two thin lenses are combined, one of which has just so strong a positive aberration (<italics>under-correction,</italics><space/>vide supra) as the other a negative; the first must be a positive lens and the second a negative lens; the powers, however: may differ, so that the desired effect of the lens is maintained. It is generally an advantage to secure a great refractive effect by several weaker than by one high-power lens. By one, and likewise by several, and even by an infinite number of thin lenses in contact, no more than two axis points can be reproduced without aberration of the third order. Freedom from aberration for two axis points, one of which is infinitely distant, is known as<space/><italics>Herschel's condition.</italics><space/>All these rules are valid, inasmuch as the thicknesses and distances of the lenses are not to be taken into account.</listitem></list><list type='ident'><listitem><bold>(2)</bold><space/>The condition for freedom from coma in the third order is also of importance for telescope objectives; it is known as<space/><italics><link><target>Joseph von Fraunhofer</target><part>Fraunhofer's</part></link><space/>condition.</italics><space/>(4) After eliminating the aberration On the axis, coma and astigmatism, the relation for the flatness of the field in the third order is expressed by the<space/><italics>Petzval equation,</italics><space/>S1/r(n'-n) = 0, where r is the radius of a refracting surface, n and n' the refractive indices of the neighboring media, and S the sign of summation for all refracting surfaces.</listitem></list><heading level='2'>Practical elimination of aberrations</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:The new PARLA laser in operation at ESOs Paranal Observatory.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part><link><target>Laser guide star</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>are used to eliminate optical aberrations.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite news</target><arg name="title">New Laser Improves VLT’s Capabilities</arg><arg name="url">http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann13010/</arg><arg name="accessdate">22 February 2013</arg><arg name="newspaper">ESO Announcement</arg></template></extension></part></link></paragraph><paragraph>The classical imaging problem is to reproduce perfectly a finite plane (the object) onto another plane (the image) through a finite aperture. It is impossible to do so perfectly for<space/><italics>more than one</italics><space/>such pairs of planes (this was proven with increasing generality by<space/><link><target>James Clerk Maxwell</target><part>Maxwell</part></link><space/>in 1858, by Bruns in 1895, and by<space/><link><target>Constantin Carathodory</target><part>Carathodory</part></link><space/>in 1926, see summary in Walther, A., J. Opt. Soc. Am. A<space/><bold>6</bold>, 415422 (1989)). For a single pair of planes (e.g. for a single focus setting of an objective), however, the problem can in principle be solved perfectly. Examples of such a theoretically perfect system include the<space/><link><target>Luneburg lens</target></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>Maxwell fish-eye</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Practical methods solve this problem with an accuracy which mostly suffices for the special purpose of each species of instrument. The problem of finding a system which reproduces a given object upon a given plane with given magnification (insofar as aberrations must be taken into account) could be dealt with by means of the approximation theory; in most cases, however, the analytical difficulties were too great for older calculation methods but may be ameliorated by application of modern computer systems. Solutions, however, have been obtained in special cases (see A. Konig in M. von Rohr's<space/><italics>Die Bilderzeugung</italics>, p.&amp;nbsp;373; K. Schwarzschild, Gttingen. Akad. Abhandl., 1905, 4, Nos. 2 and 3). At the present time constructors almost always employ the inverse method: they compose a system from certain, often quite personal experiences, and test, by the trigonometrical calculation of the paths of several rays, whether the system gives the desired reproduction (examples are given in A. Gleichen,<space/><italics>Lehrbuch der geometrischen Optik</italics>, Leipzig and Berlin, 1902). The radii, thicknesses and distances are continually altered until the errors of the image become sufficiently small. By this method only certain errors of reproduction are investigated, especially individual members, or all, of those named above. The analytical approximation theory is often employed provisionally, since its accuracy does not generally suffice.</paragraph><paragraph>In order to render spherical aberration and the deviation from the sine condition small throughout the whole aperture, there is given to a ray with a finite angle of aperture u* (width infinitely distant objects: with a finite height of incidence h*) the same distance of intersection, and the same sine ratio as to one neighboring the axis (u* or h* may not be much smaller than the largest aperture U or H to be used in the system). The rays with an angle of aperture smaller than u* would not have the same distance of intersection and the same sine ratio; these deviations are called<space/><italics>zones,</italics><space/>and the constructor endeavors to reduce these to a minimum. The same holds for the errors depending upon the angle of the field of view, w: astigmatism, curvature of field and distortion are eliminated for a definite value, w*,<space/><italics>zones of astigmatism, curvature of field and distortion,</italics><space/>attend smaller values of w. The practical optician names such systems:<space/><italics>corrected for the angle of aperture u* (the height of incidence h*) or the angle of field of view w*.</italics><space/>Spherical aberration and changes of the sine ratios are often represented graphically as functions of the aperture, in the same way as the deviations of two astigmatic image surfaces of the image plane of the axis point are represented as functions of the angles of the field of view.</paragraph><paragraph>The final form of a practical system consequently rests on compromise; enlargement of the aperture results in a diminution of the available field of view, and vice versa. But the larger aperture will give the larger resolution. The following may be regarded as typical:</paragraph><list type='ident'><listitem>(1) Largest aperture; necessary corrections are for the axis point, and sine condition; errors of the field of view are almost disregarded; example high-power microscope objectives.</listitem></list><list type='ident'><listitem>(2)<space/><link><target>Wide angle lens</target></link>; necessary corrections are for astigmatism, curvature of field and distortion; errors of the aperture only slightly regarded; examples photographic widest angle objectives and oculars.</listitem></list><list type='ident'><listitem>Between these extreme examples stands the<space/><link><target>normal lens</target></link>: this is corrected more with regard to aperture; objectives for groups more with regard to the field of view.</listitem></list><list type='ident'><listitem>(3)<space/><link><target>Long focus lens</target><trail>es</trail></link><space/>have small fields of view and aberrations on axis are very important.

Since the index of refraction varies with the color or wavelength of the light (see<space/><link><target>dispersion (optics)</target><part>dispersion</part></link>), it follows that a system of lenses (uncorrected) projects images of different colors in somewhat different places and sizes and with different aberrations; i.e. there are<space/><italics>chromatic differences</italics><space/>of the distances of intersection, of magnifications, and of monochromatic aberrations. If mixed light be employed (e.g. white light) all these images are formed and they cause a confusion, named chromatic aberration; for instance, instead of a white margin on a dark background, there is perceived a colored margin, or narrow spectrum.

James Gregory and Leonhard Euler arrived at the correct view from a false conception of the achromatism of the eye; this was determined by Chester More Hall in 1728, Klingenstierna in 1754 and by Dollond in 1757, who constructed the celebrated achromatic telescopes. (See<space/><link><target>telescope</target></link>.)</paragraph><paragraph>Glass with weaker dispersive power (greater<space/><extension extension_name='math'>v</extension>) is named<space/><italics><link><target>Crown glass (optics)</target><part>crown glass</part></link></italics>; that with greater dispersive power,<space/><italics><link><target>flint glass</target></link></italics>. For the construction of an achromatic collective lens (<extension extension_name='math'>f</extension><space/>positive) it follows, by means of equation (4), that a collective lens I. of crown glass and a dispersive lens II. of flint glass must be chosen; the latter, although the weaker, corrects the other chromatically by its greater dispersive power. For an achromatic dispersive lens the converse must be adopted. This is, at the present day, the ordinary type, e.g., of telescope objective (fig. 10); the values of the four radii must satisfy the equations (2) and (4). Two other conditions may also be postulated: one is always the elimination of the aberration on the axis; the second either the<space/><italics>Herschel</italics><space/>or<space/><italics>Fraunhofer Condition,</italics><space/>the latter being the best vide supra,<space/><italics>Monochromatic Aberration</italics>). In practice, however, it is often more useful to avoid the second condition by making the lenses have contact, i.e. equal radii. According to P. Rudolph (Eder's Jahrb. f. Photog., 1891, 5, p.&amp;nbsp;225; 1893, 7, p.&amp;nbsp;221), cemented objectives of thin lenses permit the elimination of spherical aberration on the axis, if, as above, the collective lens has a smaller refractive index; on the other hand, they permit the elimination of astigmatism and curvature of the field, if the collective lens has a greater refractive index (this follows from the Petzval equation; see L. Seidel, Astr. Nachr., 1856, p.&amp;nbsp;289). Should the cemented system be positive, then the more powerful lens must be positive; and, according to (4), to the greater power belongs the weaker dispersive power (greater<space/><extension extension_name='math'>v</extension>), that is to say, crown glass; consequently the crown glass must have the greater refractive index for astigmatic and plane images. In all earlier kinds of glass, however, the dispersive power increased with the refractive index; that is,<space/><extension extension_name='math'>v</extension><space/>decreased as<space/><extension extension_name='math'>n</extension><space/>increased; but some of the Jena glasses by E. Abbe and O. Schott were crown glasses of high refractive index, and achromatic systems from such crown glasses, with flint glasses of lower refractive index, are called the<space/><italics>new achromats,</italics><space/>and were employed by P.

If the lenses I. and II. be cemented and have the same refractive index for one color, then its effect for that one color is that of a lens of one piece; by such decomposition of a lens it can be made chromatic or achromatic at will, without altering its spherical effect. If its chromatic effect (<extension extension_name='math'>df/f</extension>) be greater than that of the same lens, this being made of the more dispersive of the two glasses employed, it is termed<space/><italics>hyper-chromatic.</italics></paragraph><paragraph>For two thin lenses separated by a distance<space/><extension extension_name='math'>D</extension><space/>the condition for achromatism is<space/><extension extension_name='math'>D=v_1f_1+v_2f_2</extension>; if<space/><extension extension_name='math'>v_1=v_2</extension><space/>(e.g. if the lenses be made of the same glass), this reduces to<space/><extension extension_name='math'>D=(f_1+f_2)/2</extension>, known as the<space/><italics>condition for oculars.</italics></paragraph><paragraph>If a constant of reproduction, for instance the focal length, be made equal for two colors, then it is not the same for other colors, if two different glasses are employed. For example, the condition for achromatism (4) for two thin lenses in contact is fulfilled in only one part of the spectrum, since<space/><extension extension_name='math'>dn_2/dn_1</extension><space/>varies within the spectrum. This fact was first ascertained by J. Fraunhofer, who defined the colors by means of the dark lines in the solar spectrum; and showed that the ratio of the dispersion of two glasses varied about 20% from the red to the violet (the variation for glass and water is about 50%). If, therefore, for two colors, a and b,<space/><extension extension_name='math'>f_a=f_b=f</extension>, then for a third color, c, the focal length is different; that is, if c lies between a and b, then &lt;math&gt;f_c&lt;f&lt;/math&gt;, and vice versa; these algebraic results follow from the fact that towards the red the dispersion of the positive crown glass preponderates, towards the violet that of the negative flint.

G. Stokes (Proc. Roy. Soc., 1878), the most suitable for visual instruments (<italics>optical achromatism,</italics>). In a similar manner, for systems used in photography, the vertex of the color curve must be placed in the position of the maximum sensibility of the plates; this is generally supposed to be at G'; and to accomplish this the F and violet mercury lines are united. This artifice is specially adopted in objectives for astronomical photography (<italics>pure actinic achromatism</italics>). For ordinary photography, however, there is this disadvantage: the image on the focusing-screen and the correct adjustment of the photographic sensitive plate are not in register; in astronomical photography this difference is constant, but in other kinds it depends on the distance of the objects. On this account the lines D and G' are united for ordinary photographic objectives; the optical as well as the actinic image is chromatically inferior, but both lie in the same place; and consequently the best correction lies in F (this is known as the<space/><italics>actinic correction</italics><space/>or<space/><italics>freedom from chemical focus</italics>).</paragraph><paragraph>Should there be in two lenses in contact the same focal lengths for three colours a, b, and c, i.e.<space/><extension extension_name='math'>f_a=f_b=f_c=f</extension>, then the relative partial dispersion<space/><extension extension_name='math'>(n_c-n_b)(n_a-n_b)</extension><space/>must be equal for the two kinds of glass employed. This follows by considering equation (4) for the two pairs of colors ac and bc. Until recently no glasses were known with a proportional degree of absorption; but R. Blair (Trans. Edin. Soc., 1791, 3, p.&amp;nbsp;3), P. Barlow, and F. S. Archer overcame the difficulty by constructing fluid lenses between glass walls. Fraunhofer prepared glasses which reduced the secondary spectrum; but permanent success was only assured on the introduction of the Jena glasses by E. Abbe and O. Schott. In using glasses not having proportional dispersion, the deviation of a third colour can be eliminated by two lenses, if an interval be allowed between them; or by three lenses in contact, which may not all consist of the old glasses. In uniting three colors an<space/><italics>achromatism of a higher order</italics><space/>is derived; there is yet a residual<space/><italics>tertiary spectrum,</italics><space/>but it can always be neglected.</paragraph><paragraph>The Gaussian theory is only an approximation; monochromatic or spherical aberrations still occur, which will be different for different colors; and should they be compensated for one color, the image of another color would prove disturbing. The most important is the chromatic difference of aberration of the axis point, which is still present to disturb the image, after par-axial rays of different colors are united by an appropriate combination of glasses. If a collective system be corrected for the axis point for a definite wavelength, then, on account of the greater dispersion in the negative components the flint glasses, over-correction will arise for the shorter wavelengths (this being the error of the negative components), and under-correction for the longer wavelengths (the error of crown glass lenses preponderating in the red). This error was treated by Jean le Rond d'Alembert, and, in special detail, by C. F. Gauss. It increases rapidly with the aperture, and is more important with medium apertures than the secondary spectrum of par-axial rays; consequently, spherical aberration must be eliminated for two colors, and if this be impossible, then it must be eliminated for those particular wavelengths which are most effectual for the instrument in question (a graphical representation of this error is given in M. von Rohr,<space/><italics>Theorie und Geschichte des photographischen Objectivs</italics>).</paragraph><paragraph>The condition for the reproduction of a surface element in the place of a sharply reproduced point the constant of the sine relationship must also be fulfilled with large apertures for several colors. E. Abbe succeeded in computing microscope objectives free from error of the axis point and satisfying the sine condition for several colors, which therefore, according to his definition, were<space/><italics>aplanatic for several colors</italics>; such systems he termed<space/><italics><link><target>apochromatic</target></link></italics>. While, however, the magnification of the individual zones is the same, it is not the same for red as for blue; and there is a chromatic difference of magnification. This is produced in the same amount, but in the opposite sense, by the oculars, which Abbe used with these objectives (<italics>compensating oculars</italics>), so that it is eliminated in the image of the whole microscope. The best telescope objectives, and photographic objectives intended for three-color work, are also apochromatic, even if they do not possess quite the same quality of correction as microscope objectives do. The chromatic differences of other errors of reproduction have seldom practical importances.</paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Wavefront coding</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Aberrations of the eye</target></link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>reflist</target></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>EB1911 poster</target><arg>Aberration</arg></template><template><target>EB1911</target><arg name="wstitle">Aberration</arg><arg name="volume">1</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='3'>Britannica references</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem>H.
