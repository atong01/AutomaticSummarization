An example from the constitutional law of<space/><link><target>sovereign state</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>would be a provincial government in a<space/><link><target>federal state</target></link><space/>trying to legislate in an area exclusively enumerated to the federal government in the constitution, such as ratifying a treaty.<space/><italics>Ultra vires</italics><space/>gives a legal justification for the forced cessation of such action, which might be enforced by the people with the support of a decision of the<space/><link><target>judiciary</target></link>, in a case of<space/><link><target>judicial review</target></link>. A violation of rights by an official would be<space/><italics>ultra vires</italics><space/>because a (constitutional) right is a restriction on the powers of government, and therefore that official would be exercising powers they do not have.</paragraph><paragraph>In most but not all modern states the constitution has supremacy over ordinary<space/><link><target>Statutory law</target></link><space/>(see<space/><link><target>#Uncodified constitution</target><part>Uncodified constitution</part></link><space/>below); in such states when an official act is unconstitutional, i.e. it is not a power granted to the government by the constitution, that act is<space/><italics>null and void</italics>, and the nullification is<space/><italics><link><target>ab initio</target></link></italics>, that is, from inception, not from the date of the finding. It was never &quot;law&quot;, even though, if it had been a statute or statutory provision, it might have been adopted according to the procedures for adopting legislation. Sometimes the problem is not that a statute is unconstitutional, but the application of it is, on a particular occasion, and a court may decide that while there are ways it could be applied that are constitutional, that instance was not allowed or legitimate. In such a case, only the application may be ruled unconstitutional.

The most basic definition he used to describe a constitution in general terms was &quot;the arrangement of the offices in a state&quot;.

He classified both what he regarded as good and what he regarded as bad constitutions, and came to the conclusion that the best constitution was a mixed system, including monarchic, aristocratic, and democratic elements. He also distinguished between citizens, who had the right to participate in the state, and non-citizens and slaves, who did not.</paragraph><paragraph>The Romans first codified their constitution in 450 BC as the<space/><italics><link><target>Twelve Tables</target></link></italics>.

The Spanish-style military conspiracy also helped to inspire the beginning of the Russian revolutionary movement with the revolt of the [[Decembrist revolt|Decembrist army officers]] in 1825. Italian liberalism in 1820–1821 relied on junior officers and the provincial middle classes, essentially the same social base as in Spain. It even used a Hispanized political vocabulary, for it was led by ''giunte'' (juntas), appointed local ''capi politici'' (''jefes políticos''), used the terms of ''liberali'' and ''servili'' (emulating the Spanish word serviles applied to supporters of absolutism), and in the end talked of resisting by means of a ''guerrilla''.

What arose from the latter was a concept of government being erected on the foundations of first, a state of nature governed by natural laws, then a state of society, established by a social contract or compact, which bring underlying natural or social laws, before governments are formally established on them as foundations.</paragraph><paragraph>Along the way several writers examined how the design of government was important, even if the government were headed by a monarch. They also classified various historical examples of governmental designs, typically into democracies, aristocracies, or monarchies, and considered how just and effective each tended to be and why, and how the advantages of each might be obtained by combining elements of each into a more complex design that balanced competing tendencies. Some, such as<space/><link><target>Montesquieu</target></link>, also examined how the functions of government, such as legislative, executive, and judicial, might appropriately be separated into branches. The prevailing theme among these writers was that the design of constitutions is not completely arbitrary or a matter of taste. They generally held that there are underlying principles of design that constrain all constitutions for every polity or organization. Each built on the ideas of those before concerning what those principles might be.</paragraph><paragraph>The later writings of<space/><link><target>Orestes Brownson</target></link><extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/lookup?num=2053'>''The American Republic: its Constitution, Tendencies, and Destiny''</link>, O. A. Brownson (1866)</extension><space/>would try to explain what constitutional designers were trying to do. According to Brownson there are, in a sense, three &quot;constitutions&quot; involved: The first the<space/><italics>constitution of nature</italics><space/>that includes all of what was called &quot;natural law.&quot; The second is the<space/><italics>constitution of society</italics>, an unwritten and commonly understood set of rules for the society formed by a social contract before it establishes a government, by which it establishes the third, a<space/><italics>constitution of government</italics>. The second would include such elements as the making of decisions by public<space/><link><target>Convention (meeting)</target><part>conventions</part></link><space/>called by<space/><link><target>public notice</target></link><space/>and conducted by established<space/><link><target>Parliamentary procedure</target><part>rules of procedure</part></link>. Each constitution must be consistent with, and derive its authority from, the ones before it, as well as from a historical act of society formation or constitutional ratification. Brownson argued that a<space/><link><target>state (polity)</target><part>state</part></link><space/>is a society with effective dominion over a well-defined territory, that consent to a well-designed constitution of government arises from presence on that territory, and that it is possible for provisions of a written constitution of government to be &quot;unconstitutional&quot; if they are inconsistent with the constitutions of nature or society. Brownson argued that it is not ratification alone that makes a written constitution of government legitimate, but that it must also be competently designed and applied.</paragraph><paragraph>Other writers<extension extension_name='ref'><italics>Principles of Constitutional Design</italics>, Donald S. Lutz (2006) ISBN 0-521-86168-3</extension><space/>have argued that such considerations apply not only to all national constitutions of government, but also to the constitutions of private organizations, that it is not an accident that the constitutions that tend to satisfy their members contain certain elements, as a minimum, or that their provisions tend to become very similar as they are amended after experience with their use. Provisions that give rise to certain kinds of questions are seen to need additional provisions for how to resolve those questions, and provisions that offer no course of action may best be omitted and left to policy decisions. Provisions that conflict with what Brownson and others can discern are the underlying &quot;constitutions&quot; of nature and society tend to be difficult or impossible to execute, or to lead to unresolvable disputes.</paragraph><paragraph>Constitutional design has been treated as a kind of<space/><link><target>metagame</target></link><space/>in which play consists of finding the best design and provisions for a written constitution that will be the rules for the game of government, and that will be most likely to optimize a balance of the utilities of justice, liberty, and security.

For example, executive branches can be divided into a head of government, government departments/ministries, executive agencies and a<space/><link><target>civil service</target></link>/administration. Most constitutions also attempt to define the relationship between individuals and the state, and to establish the broad rights of individual citizens.

For example, in the Constitution of Australia, most of its fundamental political principles and regulations concerning the relationship between branches of government, and concerning the government and the individual are codified in a single document, the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia. However, the presence of statutes with constitutional significance, namely the<space/><link><target>Statute of Westminster 1931</target><part>Statute of Westminster</part></link>, as adopted by the Commonwealth in the<space/><link><target>Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942</target></link>, and the<space/><link><target>Australia Act 1986</target></link><space/>means that Australia's constitution is not contained in a single constitutional document.

An entrenched constitution cannot be altered in any way by a legislature as part of its normal business concerning ordinary statutory laws, but can only be amended by a different and more onerous procedure. There may be a requirement for a<space/><link><target>Constituent assembly</target><part>special body</part></link><space/>to be set up, or the proportion of favourable votes of members of existing legislative bodies may be required to be higher to pass a constitutional amendment than for<space/><link><target>statute</target><trail>s</trail></link>. The<space/><link><target>entrenched clause</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>of a constitution can create different degrees of entrenchment, ranging from simply excluding constitutional amendment from the normal business of a legislature, to making certain amendments either more difficult than normal modifications, or forbidden under any circumstances.</paragraph><paragraph>Entrenchment is an inherent feature in most codified constitutions. A codified constitution will incorporate the rules which must be followed for the constitution itself to be changed.</paragraph><paragraph>The US constitution is an example of an entrenched constitution, and the UK constitution is an example of a constitution that is not entrenched (or codified). In some states the text of the constitution may be changed; in others the original text is not changed, and<space/><link><target>Constitutional amendment</target><part>amendments</part></link><space/>are passed which add to and may override the original text and earlier amendments.</paragraph><paragraph>Procedures for constitutional amendment vary between states. In a nation with a federal system of government the approval of a majority of state or provincial legislatures may be required. Alternatively, a national referendum may be required. Details are to be found in the articles on the constitutions of the various nations and federal states in the world.</paragraph><paragraph>In constitutions that are not entrenched, no special procedure is required for modification.

In the UK, for example laws which modify written or unwritten provisions of the constitution are passed on a simple majority in<space/><link><target>Parliament of the United Kingdom</target><part>Parliament</part></link>. No special &quot;constitutional amendment&quot; procedure is required.

The<space/><link><target>Monarchy of the United Kingdom</target><part>sovereign</part></link><space/>is nominally the head of state with important powers, such as the power to declare war; the<space/><link><target>Royal Prerogative in the United Kingdom</target><part>uncodified and unwritten constitution</part></link><space/>removes all these powers in practice.</paragraph><paragraph>In practice democratic governments do not use the lack of entrenchment of the constitution to impose the will of the government or abolish all civil rights, as they could in theory do, but the distinction between constitutional and other law is still somewhat arbitrary, usually following historical principles embodied in important past legislation. For example, several British<space/><link><target>Acts of Parliament</target></link><space/>such as the<space/><link><target>English Bill of Rights</target><part>Bill of Rights</part></link>, Human Rights Act and, prior to the creation of Parliament, Magna Carta are regarded as granting fundamental rights and principles which are treated as almost constitutional. Several rights that in another state might be guaranteed by constitution have indeed been abolished or modified by the British parliament in the early 21st century, including the unconditional right to<space/><link><target>trial by jury</target></link>, the<space/><link><target>right to silence</target></link><space/>without prejudicial inference,<space/><link><target>Habeas corpus</target><part>permissible detention before a charge is made</part></link><space/>extended from 24 hours to 42 days, and the<space/><link><target>Double jeopardy</target><part>right not to be tried twice for the same offence</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph><template><target>further2</target><arg>[[Fundamental Laws of England]]</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='5'>Absolutely unmodifiable articles</heading><paragraph>The strongest level of<space/><link><target>entrenched clause</target><part>entrenchment</part></link><space/>exists in those constitutions that state that some of their most fundamental principles are absolute, i.e. certain articles may not be amended under any circumstances. An amendment of a constitution that is made consistently with that constitution, except that it violates the absolute non-modifiability, can be called an<space/><italics>unconstitutional constitutional law</italics>. Ultimately it is always possible for a constitution to be overthrown by internal or external force, for example, a<space/><link><target>revolution</target></link><space/>(perhaps claiming to be justified by the<space/><link><target>right to revolution</target></link>) or invasion.In the Constitution of India, the Supreme Court has created the Doctrine of Basic Structure in Kesavananda Bharti's case (1973) stating that the essential features of the Basic structure cannot be amended by the Parliament. The Court has identified judicial review, independence of Judiciary, free and fair election, core of Fundamental Rights as a few of the essential features which are unamendable. However, the Supreme Court did not identify specific provisions which are in the category of absolute entrenchment. A critical analysis of the Doctrine of Basic Structure appears in Professor M.K. Bhandari's book<space/><italics>Basic Structure of Indian Constitution - A Critical Reconsideration</italics>.</paragraph><paragraph>An example of absolute unmodifiability is found in the<space/><link><target>Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany</target><part>German constitution</part></link>.

Article 374 of the Honduras Constitution asserts this unmodifiability, stating, &quot;It is not possible to reform, in any case, the preceding article, the present article, the constitutional articles referring to the form of government, to the national territory, to the presidential period, the prohibition to serve again as President of the Republic, the citizen who has performed under any title in consequence of which she/he cannot be President of the Republic in the subsequent period.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="georgetown_const_82-05_art374"><template><target>Cite journal</target><arg name="title"><space/>Republic of Honduras: Political Constitution of 1982 through 2005 reforms; Article 374<space/></arg><arg name="publisher"><space/>[[Georgetown University]]<space/></arg><arg name="work"><space/>Political Database of the Americas<space/></arg><arg name="url"><space/>http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Honduras/hond05.html<space/></arg><arg name="language"><space/>Spanish</arg></template></extension><space/>This unmodifiability article played an important role in the<space/><link><target>2009 Honduran constitutional crisis</target></link>.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Distribution of sovereignty</heading><paragraph><template><target>See also</target><arg>Federalism</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Constitutions also establish where sovereignty is located in the state. There are three basic types of distribution of sovereignty according to the degree of centralisation of power: unitary, federal, and confederal. The distinction is not absolute.</paragraph><paragraph>In a unitary state, sovereignty resides in the state itself, and the constitution determines this. The territory of the state may be divided into regions, but they are not sovereign and are subordinate to the state. In the UK, the constitutional doctrine of<space/><link><target>Parliamentary sovereignty</target></link><space/>dictates than sovereignty is ultimately contained at the centre. Some powers have been<space/><link><target>devolution</target><part>devolved</part></link><space/>to<space/><link><target>Northern Ireland</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Scotland</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Wales</target></link><space/>(but not<space/><link><target>England</target></link>). Some unitary states (<link><target>Spain</target></link><space/>is an example) devolve more and more power to sub-national governments until the state functions in practice much like a federal state.</paragraph><paragraph>A federal state has a central structure with at most a small amount of territory mainly containing the institutions of the federal government, and several regions (called<space/><italics>states</italics>,<space/><italics>provinces</italics>, etc.) which compose the territory of the whole state. Sovereignty is divided between the centre and the constituent regions. The constitutions of Canada and the United States establish federal states, with power divided between the federal government and the provinces or states. Each of the regions may in turn have its own constitution (of unitary nature).</paragraph><paragraph>A confederal state comprises again several regions, but the central structure has only limited coordinating power, and sovereignty is located in the regions. Confederal constitutions are rare, and there is often dispute to whether so-called &quot;confederal&quot; states are actually federal.</paragraph><paragraph>To some extent a group of states which do not constitute a federation as such may by<space/><link><target>treaty</target><part>treaties</part></link><space/>and accords give up parts of their sovereignty to a<space/><link><target>supranational</target></link><space/>entity. For example, the countries constituting the<space/><link><target>European Union</target></link><space/>have agreed to abide by some Union-wide measures which restrict their absolute sovereignty in some ways, e.g., the use of the<space/><link><target>metric system of measurement</target></link><space/>instead of national units previously used.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Separation of powers</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Separation of powers</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Constitutions usually explicitly divide power between various branches of government. The standard model, described by the<space/><link><target>Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu</target><part>Baron de Montesquieu</part></link>, involves three branches of government:<space/><link><target>executive branch</target><part>executive</part></link>,<space/><link><target>legislature</target><part>legislative</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>judiciary</target><part>judicial</part></link>. Some constitutions include additional branches, such as an<space/><link><target>audit</target><part>auditory branch</part></link>. Constitutions vary extensively as to the degree of separation of powers between these branches.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Lines of accountability</heading><paragraph>In<space/><link><target>presidential</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>semi-presidential</target></link><space/>systems of government, department secretaries/ministers are accountable to the<space/><link><target>president</target></link>, who has patronage powers to appoint and dismiss ministers. The president is accountable to the people in an election.</paragraph><paragraph>In<space/><link><target>parliamentary</target></link><space/>systems, Cabinet Ministers are accountable to<space/><link><target>Parliament</target></link>, but it is the<space/><link><target>prime minister</target></link><space/>who appoints and dismisses them. In the case of the United Kingdom and other countries with a Monarchy, it is the Monarch who appoints and dismisses ministers, on the advice of the Prime Minister. In turn the prime minister will resign if the government loses the confidence of the parliament (or a part of it). Confidence can be lost if the government loses a<space/><link><target>vote of no confidence</target></link><space/>or, depending on the country, loses a particularly important vote in parliament such as vote on the budget. When a government loses confidence it stays in office until a new government is formed; something which normally but not necessarily required the holding of a general election.</paragraph><heading level='4'>State of emergency</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>State of emergency</arg></template>Many constitutions allow the declaration under exceptional circumstances of some form of state of emergency during which some rights and guarantees are suspended. This deliberate<space/><link><target>Manifestation</target></link><space/>can be and has been abused to allow a government to suppress dissent without regard for human rightssee the article on<space/><link><target>state of emergency</target></link>.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Faade constitutions</heading><paragraph><template><target>See also</target><arg>Constitutionalism</arg></template>Italian political theorist<space/><link><target>Giovanni Sartori</target></link><space/>noted the existence of national constitutions which are a faade for authoritarian sources of power. While such documents may express respect for<space/><link><target>human rights</target></link><space/>or establish an independent judiciary, they may be ignored when the government feels threatened, or never put into practice. An extreme example was the<space/><link><target>Constitution of the Soviet Union</target></link><space/>that on paper supported<space/><link><target>freedom of assembly</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>freedom of speech</target></link>; however, citizens who transgressed unwritten limits were summarily<space/><link><target>Political prisoner</target><part>imprisoned</part></link>. The example demonstrates that the protections and benefits of a constitution are ultimately provided not through its written terms but through deference by government and society to its principles. A constitution may change from being real to a faade and back again as democratic and autocratic governments succeed each other.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Constitutional courts</heading><paragraph><template><target>Further</target><arg>Constitutional court</arg><arg>Constitutionality</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Constitutions are often, but by no means always, protected by a legal body whose job it is to interpret those constitutions and, where applicable, declare void executive and legislative acts which infringe the constitution. In some countries, such as<space/><link><target>Germany</target></link>, this function is carried out by a dedicated constitutional court which performs this (and only this) function. In other countries, such as<space/><link><target>Republic of Ireland</target><part>Ireland</part></link>, the ordinary courts may perform this function in addition to their other responsibilities. While elsewhere, like in the<space/><link><target>United Kingdom</target></link>, the concept of declaring an act to be unconstitutional does not exist.</paragraph><paragraph>A constitutional violation is an action or legislative act that is judged by a<space/><link><target>constitutional court</target></link><space/>to be contrary to the constitution, that is, unconstitutional. An example of constitutional violation by the executive could be a public office holder who acts outside the powers granted to that office by a constitution. An example of constitutional violation by the legislature is an attempt to pass a law that would contradict the constitution, without first going through the proper constitutional amendment process.</paragraph><paragraph>Some countries, mainly those with uncodified constitutions, have no such courts at all. For example, the<space/><link><target>United Kingdom</target></link><space/>has traditionally operated under the principle of<space/><link><target>parliamentary
