Written records of the '''history of China''' can be found from as early as 1200 BC under the [[Shang dynasty]] (c. 1600–1046 BC).<ref name="state1">{{cite web|url=http://exchanges.state.gov/culprop/cn04sum.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215094418/http://exchanges.state.gov/culprop/cn04sum.html|archivedate=15 December 2007|title=Public Summary Request Of The People's Republic Of China To The Government Of The United States Of America Under Article 9 Of The 1970 Unesco Convention|publisher=Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, U.S. State Department|accessdate=12 January 2008}}{{Dead link|url=http://exchanges.state.gov/culprop/cn04sum.html|date=December 2008}}</ref> Ancient historical texts such as the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' (ca. 100 BC) and the ''[[Bamboo Annals]]'' describe a [[Xia dynasty]] (c. 2070–1600 BC), which had no system of writing on a durable medium, before the Shang.<ref name="state1"/><ref name="The Ancient Dynasties">{{cite web|url=http://www-chaos.umd.edu/history/ancient1.html|title=The Ancient Dynasties|publisher=University of Maryland|accessdate=12 January 2008}}</ref> The [[Yellow River]] is said to be the cradle of Chinese civilization, although cultures originated at various regional centers along both the Yellow River and the [[Yangtze River]] valleys millennia ago in the [[Neolithic]] era.

Much of [[Culture of China|Chinese culture]], [[Chinese literature|literature]] and [[Chinese philosophy|philosophy]] further developed during the [[Zhou dynasty]] (1046–256 BC). The Zhou dynasty began to bow to external and internal pressures in the 8th century BC, and the kingdom eventually broke apart into smaller states, beginning in the [[Spring and Autumn period]] and reaching full expression in the [[Warring States period]]. This is one of multiple periods of [[failed state]]hood in Chinese history, the most recent being the [[Chinese Civil War]] that started in 1927.

Between eras of multiple kingdoms and warlordism, Chinese dynasties have ruled parts or all of China; in some eras control stretched as far as [[Xinjiang]] and [[Tibet]], as at present. In 221 BC [[Qin Shi Huang]] united the various [[Warring States period|warring kingdoms]] and created for himself the title of "[[Emperor of China|emperor]]" (''huangdi'') of the [[Qin dynasty]], marking the beginning of imperial China. Successive [[dynasties in Chinese history|dynasties]] developed [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] systems that enabled the emperor to control vast territories directly. China's last dynasty was the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] (1644–1912), which was replaced by the [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Republic of China]] in 1912, and in the [[Mainland China|mainland]] by the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949.

The conventional view of Chinese history is that of alternating periods of political unity and disunity, with China occasionally being dominated by steppe peoples, most of whom were in turn assimilated into the [[Han Chinese]] population. Cultural and political influences from other parts of Asia and the [[Western world]], carried by successive waves of immigration, expansion, foreign contact, and [[cultural assimilation]] are part of the modern culture of China.

The early history of China is obscured by the lack of written documents from this period, coupled with the existence of later accounts that attempted to describe events that had occurred several centuries previously. In a sense, the problem stems from centuries of introspection on the part of the Chinese people, which has blurred the distinction between fact and fiction in regards to this early history.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===Xia dynasty (c. 2100 – c. 1600 BC)===
{{main|Xia dynasty}}
{{further|Chinese Bronze Age}}
The [[Xia dynasty]] of China (from c. 2100 to c. 1600 BC) is the first dynasty to be described in ancient historical records such as [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' and ''[[Bamboo Annals]]''.<ref name="state1"/><ref name="The Ancient Dynasties"/>

Although there is disagreement as to whether the dynasty actually existed, there is some archaeological evidence pointing to its possible existence. [[Sima Qian]], writing in the late 2nd century BC, dated the founding of the [[Xia dynasty]] to around 2200 BC, but this date has not been corroborated. Most archaeologists now connect the Xia to excavations at [[Erlitou culture|Erlitou]] in central [[Henan]] province,<ref>[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/chbro_bron.shtm Bronze Age China] at [http://www.nga.gov/ National Gallery of Art]</ref> where a bronze smelter from around 2000 BC was unearthed. Early markings from this period found on pottery and shells are thought to be ancestral to modern Chinese characters.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050213035644/http://www.gog.com.cn/gz/art0402/ca615230.htm Scripts found on Erlitou pottery] (written in [[Simplified Chinese]])</ref> With few clear records matching the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] [[oracle bone]]s or the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] bronze vessel writings, the Xia era remains poorly understood.

According to mythology, the dynasty ended around 1600 BC as a consequence of the [[Battle of Mingtiao]].

[[File:OracleShell.JPG|right|size|150px|thumb|Oracle bones found dating from the Shang Dynasty]]
{{main|Shang dynasty}}
:''Capital: [[Yinxu|Yin]], near [[Anyang]]''

Archaeological findings providing evidence for the existence of the Shang dynasty, c. 1600–1046 BC, are divided into two sets. The first set – from the earlier Shang period – comes from sources at [[Erligang culture|Erligang]], [[Zhengzhou]], and Shangcheng. The second set – from the later Shang or Yin (殷) period – is at [[Anyang]], in modern-day [[Henan]], which has been confirmed as the last of the Shang's nine capitals (c. 1300–1046 BC).{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} The findings at Anyang include the earliest written record of Chinese past so far discovered: inscriptions of divination records in ancient Chinese writing on the bones or shells of animals – the so-called "[[oracle bone]]s", dating from around 1200 BC.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[The Cambridge History of Ancient China]] |editor1-first=Michael |editor1-last=Loewe |editor2-first=Edward L. |editor2-last=Shaughnessy |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-521-47030-8 |first=William |last=Boltz |chapter=Language and Writing |pages=74–123}}</ref>

[[File:China 1.jpg|left|thumb|Remnants of advanced, [[social stratification|stratified]] societies dating back to the Shang found primarily in the Yellow River Valley]]
31 Kings reined over the Shang dynasty. During their rein, according to the [[Records of the Grand Historian]], the capital city was moved six times.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The final (and most important) move was to [[Yinxu|Yin]] in 1350 BC which led to the dynasty's golden age.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The term Yin dynasty has been synonymous with the Shang dynasty in history, although it has lately been used to specifically refer to the latter half of the Shang dynasty.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Chinese historians living in later periods were accustomed to the notion of one dynasty succeeding another, but the actual political situation in early China is known to have been much more complicated. Hence, as some scholars of China suggest, the Xia and the Shang can possibly refer to political entities that existed concurrently, just as the early Zhou is known to have existed at the same time as the Shang.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Although written records found at Anyang confirm the existence of the Shang dynasty,{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Western scholars are often hesitant to associate settlements that are contemporaneous with the Anyang settlement with the Shang dynasty. For example, archaeological findings at [[Sanxingdui]] suggest a technologically advanced civilization culturally unlike Anyang. The evidence is inconclusive in proving how far the Shang realm extended from Anyang. The leading hypothesis is that Anyang, ruled by the same Shang in the official history, coexisted and traded with numerous other culturally diverse settlements in the area that is now referred to as [[China proper]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Zhou dynasty (1046–256 BC)===
[[File:You with zigzag thunder pattern.jpg|thumb|[[Chinese bronzes|Bronze]] ritual vessel ([[You (vessel)|You]]), Western Zhou dynasty]]
{{main|Zhou dynasty|Iron Age China}}
:''Capitals: [[Xi'an]], [[Luoyang]]''

The Zhou dynasty was the longest-lasting dynasty in Chinese history, from 1066 BC to approximately 256 BC. By the end of the 2nd millennium BC, the [[Zhou dynasty]] began to emerge in the [[Yellow River]] valley, overrunning the territory of the Shang. The Zhou appeared to have begun their rule under a [[Feudalism|semi-feudal]] system. The Zhou lived west of the [[Shang]], and the Zhou leader had been appointed "Western Protector" by the Shang. The ruler of the Zhou, [[King Wu of Zhou|King Wu]], with the assistance of his brother, the [[Duke of Zhou]], as regent, managed to defeat the Shang at the [[Battle of Muye]].

The king of Zhou at this time invoked the concept of the [[Mandate of Heaven]] to legitimize his rule, a concept that would be influential for almost every succeeding dynasty. Like Shangdi, Heaven (''tian'') ruled over all the other gods, and it decided who would rule China. It was believed that a ruler had lost the Mandate of Heaven when natural disasters occurred in great number, and when, more realistically, the sovereign had apparently lost his concern for the people. In response, the royal house would be overthrown, and a new house would rule, having been granted the Mandate of Heaven.

The Zhou initially moved their capital west to an area near modern [[Xi'an]], on the [[Wei River]], a tributary of the Yellow River, but they would preside over a series of expansions into the [[Yangtze River]] valley. This would be the first of many population migrations from north to south in Chinese history.

===Spring and Autumn period (722–476 BC)===

{{main|Spring and Autumn period}}
{{further|Chinese Iron Age}}
:''Capitals: Beijing {{smaller|([[State of Yan]])}}; [[Xi'an]] {{smaller|([[State of Qin]])}}''

In the 8th century BC, power became decentralized during the [[Spring and Autumn period]], named after the influential [[Spring and Autumn Annals]]. In this period, local military leaders used by the Zhou began to assert their power and vie for [[hegemony]]. The situation was aggravated by the invasion of other peoples from the northwest, such as the [[Qin (state)|Qin]], forcing the Zhou to move their capital east to [[Luoyang]]. This marks the second major phase of the Zhou dynasty: the Eastern Zhou. The Spring and Autumn period is marked by a falling apart of the central Zhou power. In each of the hundreds of states that eventually arose, local strongmen held most of the political power and continued their subservience to the Zhou kings in name only. Some local leaders even started using royal titles for themselves. China now consisted of hundreds of states, some of them only as large as a village with a fort.

The [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] of Chinese philosophy blossomed during this period, and such influential intellectual movements as [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]] and [[Mohism]] were founded, partly in response to the changing political world.

===Warring States period (476–221 BC)===
{{main|Warring States period}}
:''Capitals: [[Historical capitals of China|several]] {{smaller|(multiple states)}}''

After further political consolidation, seven prominent states remained by the end of 5th century BC, and the years in which these few states battled each other are known as the [[Warring States period]]. Though there remained a nominal [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] king until 256 BC, he was largely a figurehead and held little real power.

As neighboring territories of these warring states, including areas of modern [[Sichuan]] and [[Liaoning]], were annexed, they were governed under the new local administrative system of [[Commandery (China)|commandery]] and [[prefecture]] (郡縣/郡县). This system had been in use since the Spring and Autumn period, and parts can still be seen in the modern system of [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|Sheng & Xian]] (province and county, 省縣/省县).

The final expansion in this period began during the reign of [[Ying Zheng]], the king of Qin. His unification of the other six powers, and further annexations in the modern regions of [[Zhejiang]], Fujian, [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]] in 214 BC, enabled him to proclaim himself the [[Qin Shi Huang|First Emperor]] (Qin Shi Huang).

===Qin dynasty (221–206 BC)===
[[File:Qinshihuang.jpg|thumb|[[Qin Shi Huang]]]]
{{main|Qin dynasty}}
:''Capital: [[Xianyang]]''

Historians often refer to the period from Qin dynasty to the end of [[Qing dynasty]] as Imperial China. Though the unified reign of the [[Qin Shi Huang Di|First Qin Emperor]] lasted only 12 years, he managed to subdue great parts of what constitutes the core of the [[Han Chinese]] homeland and to unite them under a tightly centralized [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist]] government seated at [[Xianyang]] (close to modern [[Xi'an]]). The doctrine of Legalism that guided the Qin emphasized strict adherence to a legal code and the absolute power of the emperor. This philosophy, while effective for expanding the empire in a military fashion, proved unworkable for governing it in peacetime. The Qin Emperor {{Definition|date=March 2012}} presided over the brutal silencing of political opposition, including the event known as the [[burning of books and burying of scholars]]. This would be the impetus behind the later Han synthesis incorporating the more moderate schools of political governance.

[[File:Terracotta Army-China2.jpg|thumb|The [[Terracotta Army]] of [[Qin Shi Huang]]]]

Construction of the [[Great Wall of China]], still extant and now a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], started during the Qin dynasty; it was later augmented and improved during the [[Ming dynasty]]. The other major contributions of the Qin include the concept of a centralized government, the unification of the legal code, development of the written language, measurement, and currency of China after the tribulations of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. Even something as basic as the length of axles for carts—which need to match ruts in the roads—had to be made uniform to ensure a viable trading system throughout the empire.

====Western Han====
[[File:ChangXingongdeng.jpg|thumb|A [[Han dynasty]] [[oil lamp]], with sliding shutter, in the shape of a kneeling female servant (2nd century BC)]]
The [[Han dynasty]] was founded by [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Liu Bang]], who emerged victorious in the [[Chu–Han Contention|civil war]] that followed the collapse of the unified but short-lived [[Qin dynasty]]. A [[Pax Sinica|golden age]] in Chinese history, the Han dynasty's long period of stability and prosperity consolidated the foundation of China as a unified state under a central imperial bureaucracy, which was to last intermittently for most of the next two millennium. During the Han dynasty, territory of China was extended to most of the [[China proper]] and to areas far west. [[Confucianism]] was officially elevated to orthodox status and was to shape the subsequent Chinese Civilization. Art, culture and science all advanced to unprecedented heights. With the profound and lasting impacts of this period of Chinese history, the dynasty name "Han" had been taken as the name of the Chinese people, now the [[Han Chinese|dominant ethnic group]] in modern China, and had been commonly used to refer to Chinese language and [[Chinese characters|written characters]].

After the initial [[Huang-Lao|Laissez-faire policies]] of Emperors [[Emperor Wen of Han|Wen]] and [[Emperor Jing of Han|Jing]], the ambitious [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu]] brought the empire to its zenith. To consolidate his power, Confucianism, which emphasizes stability and order in a well-structured society, was given exclusive patronage to be the guiding philosophical thoughts and moral principles of the empire. [[Taixue|Imperial Universities]] were established to support its study and further development, while other [[Hundred Schools of Thought|schools of thoughts]] were discouraged.

[[Han–Xiongnu War|Major military campaigns]] were launched to weaken the nomadic [[Xiongnu Empire]], limiting their influence north of the Great Wall. Along with the diplomatic efforts led by [[Zhang Qian]], the sphere of influence of the Han Empire extended to the [[Western Regions|states in the Tarim Basin]], opened up the [[Silk Road]] that connected China to the west, stimulating bilateral trade and cultural exchange. To the south, various small kingdoms far beyond the [[Yangtze River]] Valley were formally incorporated into the empire.

Emperor Wu also dispatched a [[southward expansion of the Han dynasty|series of military campaigns]] against the [[Baiyue]] tribes. The Han annexed [[Han campaigns against Minyue|Minyue in 135 BC]] and 111 BC, [[Han–Nanyue War|Nanyue in 111 BC]], and [[Han campaign against Dian|Dian in 109 BC]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Yingshi|last=Yu|editor=Denis Twitchett|editor2=Michael Loewe|title= Cambridge History of China: Volume I: the Ch'in and Han Empires, 221 B.C. – A.D. 220|year=1986|publisher=University of Cambridge Press|isbn=978-0-5212-4327-8|pages=455–458}}</ref> Migration and military expeditions led to the cultural assimilation of the south.<ref>{{cite book|first=Pingfang|last=Xu|title=The Formation of Chinese Civilization: An Archaeological Perspective|year=2005|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-09382-7|page=281}}</ref> It also brought the Han into contact with kingdoms in Southeast Asia, introducing diplomacy and trade.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jacques|last=Gernet|title=A History of Chinese Civilization|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-49781-7|pages=126–127}}</ref>

After [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu]], the empire slipped into gradual stagnation and decline. Economically, the state treasury was strained by excessive campaigns and projects, while land acquisitions by elite families gradually drained the tax base. Various [[consort clan]]s exerted increasing control over strings of incompetent emperors and eventually the dynasty was briefly interrupted by the usurpation of [[Wang Mang]].

====Xin dynasty====
In AD 9, the usurper [[Wang Mang]] claimed that the [[Mandate of Heaven]] called for the end of the Han dynasty and the rise of his own, and he founded the short-lived [[Xin dynasty|Xin ("New") dynasty]]. Wang Mang started an extensive program of land and other economic reforms, including the outlawing of slavery and land nationalization and redistribution. These programs, however, were never supported by the landholding families, because they favored the [[peasant]]s. The instability of power brought about chaos, uprisings, and loss of territories. This was compounded by mass flooding of the [[Yellow River]]; silt buildup caused it to split into two channels and displaced large numbers of farmers. Wang Mang was eventually killed in [[Weiyang Palace]] by an enraged peasant mob in AD 23.

====Eastern Han====
[[Emperor Guangwu of Han|Emperor Guangwu]] reinstated the Han dynasty with the support of landholding and merchant families at [[Luoyang]], ''east'' of the former capital [[Xi'an]]. Thus, this new era is termed the [[Eastern Han dynasty]]. With the capable administrations of Emperors [[Emperor Ming of Han|Ming]] and [[Emperor Zhang of Han|Zhang]], former glories of the dynasty was reclaimed, with brilliant military and cultural achievements. The [[Xiongnu Empire]] was [[Han–Xiongnu War#Final stages|decisively defeated]]. The diplomat and general [[Ban Chao]] further expanded the conquests across the [[Pamirs]] to the shores of the [[Caspian Sea]],<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/440601/Ban-Chao Ban Chao], Britannica Online Encyclopedia</ref> thus reopening the [[Silk Road]], and bringing trade, foreign cultures, along with the [[Chinese Buddhism#Traditional accounts|arrival of Buddhism]]. With extensive connections with the west, the first of several [[Romano-Chinese relations|Roman embassies to China]] were recorded in Chinese sources, coming from the sea route in AD 166, and a second one in AD 284.

The Eastern Han dynasty was one of the [[Science and technology of the Han dynasty|most prolific era of science and technology]] in ancient China, notably the historic invention of [[papermaking]] by [[Cai Lun]], and the numerous contributions by the [[polymath]] [[Zhang Heng]].

===Three Kingdoms and Western Jin (AD 265–316)===

By the 2nd century, the empire declined amidst land acquisitions, invasions, and feuding between [[consort clan]]s and [[Eunuch#China|eunuchs]]. The [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] broke out in AD 184, ushering in an era of [[warlord]]s. In the ensuing turmoil, three states tried to gain predominance in the period of the [[Three Kingdoms]]. This time period has been greatly romanticized in works such as ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]''.

After [[Cao Cao]] reunified the north in 208, his son proclaimed the [[Cao Wei|Wei]] dynasty in 220. Soon, Wei's rivals [[Shu Han|Shu]] and [[Eastern Wu|Wu]] proclaimed their independence, leading China into the Three Kingdoms period. This period was characterized by a gradual decentralization of the state that had existed during the Qin and Han dynasties, and an increase in the power of great families.

In 280, the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] reunified the country, but this union was short-lived.

===Sixteen Kingdoms and Eastern Jin (AD 304–439)===
{{main|Sixteen Kingdoms}}
:''Capitals: [[Historical capitals of China|several]] {{smaller|(multiple states)}}''

The Jin Dynasty was severely weakened by [[War of the Eight Princes|interceine fighting among imperial princes]] and lost control of northern China after [[Five Barbarians|non-Han Chinese settlers]] [[Uprising of the Five Barbarians|rebelled]] and captured Luoyang and Chang’an.  In 317, a [[Emperor Yuan of Jin|Jin prince]] in modern-day [[Nanjing]] became emperor and continued the dynasty, now known as the Eastern Jin, which held southern China for another century.  Prior to this move, historians refer to the Jin dynasty as the Western Jin.

Northern China fragmented into a series of [[Sixteen Kingdoms|independent kingdoms]], most of which were founded by [[Xiongnu]], [[Xianbei]], [[Jie people|Jie]], [[Di (Five Barbarians)|Di]] and [[Qiang (historical people)|Qiang]] rulers.  These non-Han peoples were ancestors of the [[Turkic people|Turks]], [[Mongols]], and [[Tibetans]]. Many had, to some extent, been "[[Sinicization|sinicized]]" long before their ascent to power. In fact, some of them, notably the [[Qiang people|Qiang]] and the Xiongnu, had already been allowed to live in the frontier regions within the Great Wall since late Han times.  During the period of the [[Sixteen Kingdoms]], warfare ravaged the north and prompted large-scale Han Chinese migration south to the [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] Basin and Delta.

{{main|Southern and Northern Dynasties}}
:''Capitals: [[Ye, China|Ye]], [[Chang'an]] {{smaller|([[Northern Dynasties]])}}; [[Jiankang]] {{smaller|([[Southern Dynasties]])}}''

In the early 5th century, China entered a period known as the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]], in which parallel regimes ruled the northern and southern halves of the country.  In the south, the Eastern Jin gave way to the [[Liu Song dynasty|Liu Song]], [[Southern Qi]], [[Liang dynasty|Liang]] and finally [[Chen dynasty|Chen]].  Each of these Southern Dynasties were led by Han Chinese ruling families and used [[Jiankang]] (modern Nanjing) as the capital.  They held off attacks from the north and preserved many aspects of Chinese civilization, while northern barbarian regimes began to sinify.

In the north, the last of the Sixteen Kingdoms was extinguished in 439 by the [[Northern Wei]], a kingdom founded by the [[Xianbei]], a nomadic people who unified northern China. The Northern Wei eventually split into the [[Eastern Wei|Eastern]] and [[Western Wei]], which then became the [[Northern Qi]] and [[Northern Zhou]].  These regimes were dominated by Xianbei or Han Chinese who had married into Xianbei families.

Despite the division of the country, Buddhism spread throughout the land.   In southern China, fierce debates about whether [[Buddhism]] should be allowed were held frequently by the royal court and nobles. Finally, towards the end of the Southern and Northern Dynasties era, Buddhists and [[Taoist]]s reached a compromise and became more tolerant of each other.

In 589, the [[Sui dynasty]] united China once again, ending a prolonged period of division in Chinese history.  In the nearly four centuries between the Han and Sui dynasties, the country was united for only 24 years during the Western Jin.

===Sui dynasty (AD 589–618)===

The [[Sui dynasty]], which lasted 29 years, played a role more important than its length of existence would suggest. The Sui brought China together again and set up many institutions that were to be adopted by their successors, the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]]. These included the government system of [[Three Departments and Six Ministries]], [[Ancient Chinese coinage|standard coinage]], improved defense and expansion of the Great Wall, and official support for Buddhism. Like the Qin, however, the Sui overused their resources and collapsed.

{{main|Tang dynasty}}
:''Capitals: [[Chang'an]], [[Luoyang]]''

The [[Tang dynasty]] was founded by [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang|Emperor Gaozu]] on 18 June 618. It was a [[Pax Sinica|golden age of Chinese civilization]] with significant developments in art, literature, particularly [[Tang poetry|poetry]], and technology. Buddhism became the predominant religion for common people. [[Chang'an]] (modern [[Xi'an]]), the national capital, was the [[List of largest cities throughout history|largest city in the world of its time]].

The second emperor, [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Taizong]], started military campaigns to eliminate threats from nomadic tribes, extend the border, and submit neighboring states into [[Imperial Chinese tributary system|a tributary system]]. Military victories in the [[Tang dynasty in Inner Asia|Tarim Basin]] kept the [[Silk Road]] open, connecting Chang'an to Central Asia and areas far to the west. In the south, lucrative maritime trade routes began from port cities such as [[Guangzhou]]. There was extensive trade with distant foreign countries, and many foreign merchants settled in China, encouraging a cosmopolitan culture. The Tang culture and social systems were observed and imitated by neighboring countries such as [[Nara period|Japan]]. Internally the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] linked the political heartland in Chang'an to the economic and agricultural centers in the eastern and southern parts of the empire.

Underlying the prosperity of the early Tang dynasty was a strong centralized bureaucracy with efficient policies. The government was organized as "[[Three Departments and Six Ministries]]" to separately draft, review, and implement policies. These departments were run by royal family members as well as [[Scholar-bureaucrats|scholar officials]] who were selected by [[imperial examination]]s. These practices, which matured in the Tang dynasty, were continued by the later dynasties, with some modifications.

Under the Tang "[[equal-field system]]" all land was owned by the Emperor and granted to people according to household size. Men granted land were conscripted for military service for a fixed period each year, a military policy known as the "[[Fubing system]]". These policies stimulated a rapid growth in productivity and a significant army without much burden on the state treasury. By the dynasty's midpoint, however, [[Standing army|standing armies]] had replaced conscription, and land was continuously falling into the hands of private owners.

The dynasty continued to flourish under Empress [[Wu Zetian]], the only [[empress regnant]] in Chinese history, and reached its zenith during the reign of [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]], who oversaw an empire that stretched from the Pacific to the [[Aral Sea]] with at least 50 million people.

At the zenith of prosperity of the empire, the [[An Lushan Rebellion]] from 755 to 763 was a watershed event that [[An Lushan Rebellion#Death toll|devastated the population]] and drastically weakened the central imperial government. Regional military governors, known as [[Jiedushi]], gained increasingly autonomous status while formerly submissive states raided the empire. Nevertheless, after the An Lushan Rebellion, the Tang civil society recovered and thrived amidst the weakened imperial bureaucracy.

From about 860, the Tang dynasty declined due to a series of rebellions within China itself and in the former subject [[Kingdom of Nanzhao]] to the south. One warlord, [[Huang Chao]], captured Guangzhou in 879, killing most of the 200,000 inhabitants, including most of the large colony of foreign merchant families there.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Gabriel Ferrand |year=1922 |title=Voyage du marchand arabe Sulaymân en Inde et en Chine, rédigé en 851, suivi de remarques par Abû Zayd Hasan (vers 916) |page=76}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/judaism/kaifung.html |title=Kaifung Jews |publisher=University of Cumbria, Division of Religion and Philosophy}}</ref> In late 880, [[Luoyang]] surrendered to Huang Chao, and on 5 January 881 he conquered [[Chang'an]]. The emperor [[Emperor Xizong of Tang|Xizong]] fled to [[Chengdu]], and Huang established a new temporary regime which was eventually destroyed by Tang forces. Another time of political chaos followed.

===Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms (AD 907–960)===
{{main|Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period}}
:''Capitals: various''

The period of political disunity between the Tang and the Song, known as the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]], lasted from 907 to 960. During this half-century, when China was in all respects a multi-state system, five regimes rapidly succeeded one another in control of the old Imperial heartland in northern China. During this same time, sections of southern and western China were occupied by ten, more stable, regimes so the period is also referred to as the Ten Kingdoms.

===Song, Liao, Jin, and Western Xia dynasties (AD 960–1234)===

In 960, the [[Song dynasty]] gained power over most of China and established its capital in [[Kaifeng]] (later known as [[Bianjing]]), starting a period of economic prosperity, while the [[Khitan people|Khitan]] [[Liao dynasty]] ruled over [[Manchuria]], present-day [[Mongolia]], and parts of [[North China|Northern China]]. In 1115, the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]] emerged to prominence, annihilating the Liao dynasty in 10 years. Meanwhile, in what are now the northwestern Chinese provinces of [[Gansu]], Shaanxi, and [[Ningxia]], a [[Western Xia|Western Xia dynasty]] emerged from 1032 to 1227, established by [[Tangut people|Tangut]] tribes.

The Jin dynasty took power and [[Jurchen campaigns against the Song dynasty|conquered northern China in the Jin–Song Wars]], capturing Kaifeng from the Song dynasty, which moved its capital to [[Hangzhou]] (杭州). The Southern Song dynasty had to acknowledge the Jin dynasty as formal overlords. In the ensuing years, China was divided between the Song dynasty, the Jin dynasty and the [[Tangut people|Tangut]] [[Western Xia]]. Southern Song experienced a period of great technological development which can be explained in part by the military pressure that it felt from the north. This included the use of [[gunpowder]] weapons, which played a large role in the Song dynasty naval victories against the Jin in the [[Battle of Tangdao]] and [[Battle of Caishi]] on the Yangtze River in 1161. China's first permanent standing navy was assembled and provided an [[admiral]]'s office at [[Dinghai]] in 1132, under the reign of [[Emperor Renzong of Song]].

The Song dynasty is considered by many to be classical China's high point in science and technology, with innovative scholar-officials such as [[Su Song]] (1020–1101) and [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095). There was court intrigue between the political rivals of the Reformers and Conservatives, led by the chancellors [[Wang Anshi]] and [[Sima Guang]], respectively. By the mid-to-late 13th century, the Chinese had adopted the dogma of [[Neo-Confucian]] philosophy formulated by [[Zhu Xi]]. Enormous literary works were compiled during the Song dynasty, such as the historical work of the ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'' ("Comprehensive Mirror to Aid in Government"). Culture and the arts flourished, with grandiose artworks such as ''[[Along the River During the Qingming Festival]]'' and ''[[Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute]]'', along with great Buddhist painters such as the prolific [[Lin Tinggui]].

===Yuan dynasty (AD 1271–1368)===

The [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]]-founded [[Jin dynasty, 1115–1234|Jin dynasty]] was [[Timeline of Mongol conquests|defeated by the Mongols]], who then proceeded to defeat the Southern Song in a long and bloody war, the first war in which [[firearms]] played an important role. During the era after the war, later called the ''[[Pax Mongolica]]'', adventurous Westerners such as [[Marco Polo]] travelled all the way to China and brought the first reports of its wonders to Europe. In the Yuan dynasty, the Mongols were divided between those who wanted to remain based in the steppes and those who wished to adopt the customs of the Chinese.

[[Kublai Khan]], grandson of [[Genghis Khan]], wanting to adopt the customs of China, established the [[Yuan dynasty]]. This was the first dynasty to rule the whole of China from Beijing as the capital. Beijing had been ceded to Liao in AD 938 with the [[Sixteen Prefectures|Sixteen Prefectures of Yan Yun]]. Before that, it had been the capital of the [[Jin dynasty, 1115–1234|Jin]], who did not rule all of China.

Before the Mongol invasion, Chinese dynasties reported approximately 120 million inhabitants; after the conquest had been completed in 1279, the 1300 census reported roughly 60 million people.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Ping-ti |last= Ho | title=An Estimate of the Total Population of Sung-Chin China | journal = Études Song | series= 1 | issue=1 | year=1970 | pages=33–53}}</ref> This major decline is not necessarily due only to Mongol killings. Scholars such as Frederick W. Mote argue that the wide drop in numbers reflects an administrative failure to record rather than an actual decrease; others such as [[Timothy Brook]] argue that the Mongols created a system of [[serfdom|enserfment]] among a huge portion of the Chinese populace, causing many to disappear from the census altogether; other historians including William McNeill and David Morgan consider that [[Plague (disease)|plague]] was the main factor behind the demographic decline during this period.

In the 14th century China suffered additional depredations from epidemics of plague, estimated to have killed 25 million people, 30% of the population of China.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://chip.med.nyu.edu/course/view.php?id=13&topic=1 |title = Course: Plague |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071118121009/http://chip.med.nyu.edu/course/view.php?id=13&topic=1 | archivedate = 18 November 2007}}{{dead link|date=September 2012}}</ref>

===Ming dynasty (AD 1368–1644)===

[[File:明太祖.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The [[Hongwu Emperor]], the founder of the [[Ming dynasty]]]]

Throughout the Yuan dynasty, which lasted less than a century, there was relatively strong sentiment among the populace against Mongol rule. The frequent natural disasters since the 1340s finally led to peasant revolts. The Yuan dynasty was eventually overthrown by the [[Ming dynasty]] in 1368.

Urbanization increased as the population grew and as the division of labor grew more complex. Large urban centers, such as [[Nanjing]] and Beijing, also contributed to the growth of private industry. In particular, small-scale industries grew up, often specializing in paper, silk, cotton, and porcelain goods. For the most part, however, relatively small urban centers with markets proliferated around the country. Town markets mainly traded food, with some necessary manufactures such as pins or oil.

Despite the [[xenophobia]] and intellectual introspection characteristic of the increasingly popular new school of [[neo-Confucianism]], China under the early Ming dynasty was not isolated. Foreign trade and other contacts with the outside world, particularly Japan, increased considerably. Chinese merchants explored all of the Indian Ocean, reaching East Africa with the [[Treasure voyages|voyages of Zheng He]].

[[Zhu Yuanzhang]] (the Hongwu Emperor), the founder of the dynasty, laid the foundations for a state interested less in commerce and more in extracting revenues from the agricultural sector. Perhaps because of Zhu's background as a peasant, the Ming economic system emphasized agriculture, unlike that of the Song and the Mongolian dynasties, which relied on traders and merchants for revenue. Neo-feudal landholdings of the Song and Mongol periods were expropriated by the Ming rulers. Land estates were confiscated by the government, fragmented, and rented out. Private slavery was forbidden. Consequently, after the death of the [[Yongle Emperor]], independent peasant landholders predominated in Chinese agriculture. These laws might have paved the way to removing the worst of the poverty during the previous regimes.

[[File:Ming-Empire2.jpg|left|thumb|Ming China under the reign of the [[Yongle Emperor]]]]

The dynasty had a strong and complex central government that unified and controlled the empire. The emperor's role became more autocratic, although Zhu Yuanzhang necessarily continued to use what he called the "[[Grand Secretariat|Grand Secretaries]]" (内阁) to assist with the immense paperwork of the bureaucracy, including [[memorial to the throne|memorials]] (petitions and recommendations to the throne), imperial edicts in reply, reports of various kinds, and tax records. It was this same bureaucracy that later prevented the Ming government from being able to adapt to changes in society, and eventually led to its decline.

The Yongle Emperor strenuously tried to extend China's influence beyond its borders by demanding other rulers send ambassadors to China to present tribute. A large navy was built, including four-masted ships displacing 1,500&nbsp;tons. A standing army of 1 million troops (some estimate as many as 1.9 million {{Who|date=March 2009}}) was created. The Chinese armies [[Ming-Ho War|conquered Vietnam]] for around 20 years, while the [[Treasure voyages|Chinese fleet sailed]] the China seas and the Indian Ocean, cruising as far as the east coast of Africa. The Chinese gained influence in eastern [[Moghulistan]]. Several maritime Asian nations sent envoys with tribute for the Chinese emperor. Domestically, the Grand Canal was expanded and became a stimulus to domestic trade. Over 100,000&nbsp;tons of iron per year were produced. Many books were printed using movable type. The imperial palace in Beijing's [[Forbidden City]] reached its current splendor. It was also during these centuries that the potential of south China came to be fully exploited. New crops were widely cultivated and industries such as those producing porcelain and textiles flourished.

In 1449 [[Esen Tayisi]] led an [[Oirats|Oirat]] Mongol invasion of northern China which culminated in the capture of the [[Zhengtong Emperor]] at [[Battle of Tumu Fortress|Tumu]].

In 1521, Ming dynasty naval forces [[First Battle of Tamao|fought and repulsed Portuguese ships]] at [[Tuen Mun]] and again [[Second Battle of Tamao|fought off the Portuguese in 1522]].

In 1542 the Mongol leader, [[Altan Khan]], began to harass China along the northern border, reaching the outskirts of Beijing in 1550. The empire also had to deal with [[wokou]] pirates attacking the southeastern coastline;<ref>"China > History > The Ming dynasty > Political history > The dynastic succession", ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online'', 2007</ref> General [[Qi Jiguang]] was instrumental in their defeat. In 1556, during the rule of the [[Jiajing Emperor]], the [[1556 Shaanxi earthquake|Shaanxi earthquake]] killed about 830,000 people, the deadliest earthquake of all time.

During the Ming dynasty, the last construction on the Great Wall was undertaken to protect China from foreign invasions. Most of what remains of the Wall in modern times was either built or repaired by the Ming. The brick and granite work was enlarged, the watch towers were redesigned, and cannons were placed along its length.

China defeated the Dutch in the [[Sino–Dutch conflicts]] in 1622–1624 over the [[Penghu]] islands and again defeated the Dutch at the [[Battle of Liaoluo Bay]] in 1633. The Ming loyalist [[Koxinga]] (Zheng Chenggong) defeated the Dutch in the [[Siege of Fort Zeelandia]] in Taiwan in 1662.

The [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1911) was the last imperial dynasty in China. Founded by the [[Manchu people|Manchus]], it was the second non-[[Han Chinese]] dynasty to rule all over Chinese territory. The Manchus were formerly known as [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]], residing in the northeastern part of the Ming territory outside the Great Wall. They emerged as the major threat to the late Ming dynasty after [[Nurhaci]] united all Jurchen tribes and established an independent state. However, the [[Ming dynasty]] would be overthrown by [[Li Zicheng]]'s peasants rebellion, with Beijing captured in 1644 and the [[Chongzhen Emperor]], the last Ming emperor, committing suicide. The Manchus allied with the former Ming general [[Wu Sangui]] to seize Beijing, which was made the capital of the Qing dynasty, and then proceeded to subdue the [[Southern Ming dynasty|Ming remnants in the south]]. The decades of Manchu conquest caused [[List of wars and anthropogenic disasters by death toll#Wars and armed conflicts|enormous loss of lives]] and the [[Economic history of China before 1912#Qing (Manchu) Dynasty (1644–1912 CE)|economic scale of China shrank drastically]]. In total, the [[Qing conquest of the Ming]] (1618–1683) cost as many as 25 million lives.<ref>John M. Roberts (1997). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3QZXvUhGwhAC A Short History of the World]''. Oxford University Press. p. 272. ISBN 0-19-511504-X.</ref> Nevertheless, the Manchus adopted the Confucian norms of traditional Chinese government in their rule and were considered a Chinese dynasty.

The Manchus enforced a 'queue order,' forcing the Han Chinese to adopt the Manchu [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue hairstyle]]. Officials were required to wear Manchu-style clothing ''[[Changshan]]'' ([[Eight Banners|bannermen]] dress and ''[[Tangzhuang]]''), but ordinary Han civilians were allowed to wear traditional Han clothing, or ''[[Hanfu]]''. Most Han then voluntarily shifted to wearing Qipao anyway. The [[Kangxi Emperor]] ordered the creation of the ''[[Kangxi Dictionary]]'', the most complete dictionary of [[Chinese characters]] that had been compiled. The Qing dynasty set up the [[Eight Banners]] system that provided the basic framework for the Qing military organization. Bannermen could not undertake trade or manual labor; they had to petition to be removed from banner status. They were considered a form of nobility and were given preferential treatment in terms of annual pensions, land, and allotments of cloth.

[[File:China imperialism cartoon.jpg|left|thumb|Late-1890s French political cartoon showing China divided among Britain, Germany, Russia, France and Japan]]

Over the next half-century, all areas previously under the [[Ming dynasty]] were consolidated under the Qing. [[Xinjiang]], Tibet, and [[Mongolia]] were also formally incorporated into Chinese territory. Between 1673 and 1681, the Kangxi Emperor suppressed the [[Revolt of the Three Feudatories]], an uprising of three generals in Southern China who had been denied hereditary rule of large fiefdoms granted by the [[Shunzhi Emperor|previous emperor]]. In 1683, the Qing staged an amphibious assault on southern [[Taiwan]], bringing down the rebel [[Kingdom of Tungning]], which was founded by the Ming loyalist [[Koxinga]] (Zheng Chenggong) in 1662 after the fall of the Southern Ming, and had served as a base for continued Ming resistance in Southern China. The Qing [[Sino-Russian border conflicts|defeated the Russians at Albazin]], resulting in the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]].

By the end of [[Qianlong Emperor]]'s long reign, the Qing Empire was at its zenith. China ruled more than [[List of largest empires#All empires at their greatest extent|one-third of the world's population]], and had the largest economy in the world. By area it was [[List of largest empires#All empires at their greatest extent|one of the largest empires ever]].

In the 19th century the empire was internally stagnant and externally threatened by western powers. The defeat by the [[British Empire]] in the [[First Opium War]] (1840) led to the [[Treaty of Nanking]] (1842), under which [[History of Hong Kong (1800s–1930s)|Hong Kong]] was ceded to Britain and importation of [[opium]] (produced by British Empire territories) was allowed. Subsequent military defeats and [[unequal treaties]] with other western powers continued even after the fall of the Qing dynasty.

Internally the [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1851–1864), a quasi-Christian religious movement led by the "Heavenly King" [[Hong Xiuquan]], raided roughly a third of Chinese territory for over a decade until they were finally crushed in the [[Third Battle of Nanking]] in 1864. This was one of the largest wars in the 19th century in terms of troop involvement; there was massive loss of life, with [[List of wars and anthropogenic disasters by death toll#Wars and armed conflicts|a death toll of about 20 million]].<ref>{{cite web | first=Matthew | last=White |url = http://necrometrics.com/wars19c.htm | title = Statistics of Wars, Oppressions and Atrocities of the Nineteenth Century |accessdate=11 April 2007}}</ref> A string of civil disturbances followed, including the [[Punti–Hakka Clan Wars]], [[Nian Rebellion]], [[Dungan revolt (1862–1877)|Dungan Revolt]], and [[Panthay Rebellion]].<ref>{{cite book | first=Damsan |last=Harper | first2=Steve |last2=Fallon |first3=Katja |last3=Gaskell |first4=Julie |last4=Grundvig |first5= Carolyn |last5=Heller | first6=Thomas |last6=Huhti |first7=Bradley |last7=Maynew |first8=Christopher | last8=Pitts | title=Lonely Planet China | edition=9 | year=2005 | ISBN=1-74059-687-0}}</ref> All rebellions were ultimately put down, but at enormous cost and with many casualties, seriously weakening the central imperial authority. The [[Eight Banners|Banner system]] that the Manchus had relied upon for so long failed: Banner forces were unable to suppress the rebels, and the government called upon local officials in the provinces, who raised "New Armies", which successfully crushed the challenges to Qing authority. China never rebuilt a strong central army, and many local officials became warlords who used military power to effectively rule independently in their provinces.<ref>Philip Kuhn, ''Rebellion and its Enemies in Late Imperial China: Militarization and Social Structure, 1796-1864'' (1970) ch 6</ref>

In response to calamities within the empire and threats from imperialism, the [[Self-Strengthening Movement]] was an institutional reform in the second half of the 1800s. The aim was to modernize the empire, with prime emphasis on strengthening the military. However, the reform was undermined by corrupt officials, cynicism, and quarrels within the imperial family. As a result, the "[[Beiyang Fleet]]" were soundly defeated in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894–1895). The [[Guangxu Emperor]] and the reformists then launched a more comprehensive reform effort, the [[Hundred Days' Reform]] (1898), but it was soon overturned by the conservatives under [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] in a military coup.

At the turn of the 20th century, the violent [[Boxer Rebellion]] opposed foreign influence in Northern China, and attacked Chinese Christians and missionaries. When Boxers entered Beijing, the Qing government ordered all foreigners to leave. But instead the foreigners and many Chinese were [[Siege of the International Legations|besieged in the foreign legations quarter]]. The [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] sent the [[Seymour Expedition]] of Japanese, Russian, Italian, German, French, American, and Austrian troops to relieve the siege. The Expedition was stopped by the Boxers at the [[Battle of Langfang]] and forced to retreat. Due to [[Battle of Dagu Forts (1900)|the Alliance's attack on the Dagu Forts]], the Qing government in response sided with the Boxers and declared war on the Alliance. There was [[Battle of Tientsin|fierce fighting at Tientsin]]. The Alliance formed the second, much larger [[Gaselee Expedition]] and [[Battle of Peking (1900)|finally reached Beijing]]; the Qing government evacuated to [[Xi'an]]. The [[Boxer Protocol]] ended the war.

[[File:Sunyatsen1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sun Yat-sen]], founder and first president of the Republic of China]]

Frustrated by the Qing court's resistance to reform and by China's weakness, young officials, military officers, and students began to advocate the overthrow of the Qing dynasty and the creation of a republic. They were inspired by the revolutionary ideas of [[Sun Yat-sen]]. A revolutionary military uprising, the [[Wuchang Uprising]], began on 10 October 1911, in [[Wuhan]]. The [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1912)|provisional government of the Republic of China]] was formed in [[Nanjing]] on 12 March 1912. The Xinhai Revolution ended 2,000 years of dynastic rule in China.

After the success of the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty, [[Sun Yat-sen]] was declared [[President of the Republic of China|President]], but Sun was forced to turn power over to [[Yuan Shikai]], who commanded the [[New Army]] and was Prime Minister under the Qing government, as part of the agreement to let the [[Puyi|last Qing monarch]] abdicate (a decision Sun would later regret). Over the next few years, Yuan proceeded to abolish the national and provincial assemblies, and declared himself emperor in late 1915. Yuan's imperial ambitions were fiercely opposed by his subordinates; faced with the prospect of rebellion, he abdicated in March 1916, and died in June of that year.

Yuan's death in 1916 left a power vacuum in China; the republican government was all but shattered. This ushered in the [[Warlord Era]], during which much of the country was ruled by shifting coalitions of competing provincial military leaders.

In 1919, the [[May Fourth Movement]] began as a response to the terms imposed on China by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] ending World War I, but quickly became a nationwide protest movement about the domestic situation in China. The protests were a moral success as the cabinet fell and China refused to sign the Treaty of Versailles, which had awarded German holdings to Japan. The New Culture Movement stimulated by the May Fourth Movement waxed strong throughout the 1920s and 1930s. According to Ebrey:
:"Nationalism, patriotism, progress, science, democracy, and freedom were the goals; imperialism, feudalism, warlordism, autocracy, patriarchy, and blind adherence to tradition where the enemies. Intellectuals struggled with how to be strong and modern and yet Chinese, how to preserve China as a political entity in the world of competing nations."<ref>Patricia Buckley Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'' (1996) p 271</ref>[[File:Flag of the Republic of China.png|alt=Blue Sky White Sun Wholly Red Earth|thumb|The flag of the Republic of China from 1928 to now.]]

The discrediting of liberal Western philosophy amongst leftist Chinese intellectuals led to more radical lines of thought inspired by the Russian Revolution, and supported by agents of the Comintern sent to China by Moscow. This created the seeds for the irreconcilable conflict between the left and right in China that would dominate Chinese history for the rest of the century.

In the 1920s, Sun Yat-sen established a revolutionary base in south China, and set out to unite the fragmented nation. With assistance from the [[Soviet Union]] (themselves fresh from a socialist uprising), he entered into an alliance with the fledgling [[Communist Party of China]]. After Sun's death from cancer in 1925, one of his protégés, [[Chiang Kai-shek]], seized control of the ''[[Kuomintang]]'' (Nationalist Party or KMT) and succeeded in bringing most of south and central China under its rule in a military campaign known as the [[Northern Expedition]] (1926–1927). Having defeated the warlords in south and central China by military force, Chiang was able to secure the nominal allegiance of the warlords in the North. In 1927, Chiang turned on the CPC and relentlessly chased the CPC armies and its leaders from their bases in southern and eastern China. In 1934, driven from their mountain bases such as the [[Chinese Soviet Republic]], the CPC forces embarked on the [[Long March]] across China's most desolate terrain to the northwest, where they established a guerrilla base at [[Yan'an]] in Shaanxi Province. During the Long March, the communists reorganized under a new leader, [[Mao Zedong]] (Mao Tse-tung).

[[File:Chinese civilians to be buried alive.jpg|thumb|210px|Chinese civilians buried alive during the 1937 [[Nanking Massacre]]]]

The bitter struggle between the KMT and the CPC continued, openly or clandestinely, through the 14-year-long Japanese occupation of various parts of the country (1931–1945). The two Chinese parties nominally formed a united front to oppose the Japanese in 1937, during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945)]], which became a part of World War II. Japanese forces committed numerous [[Japanese war crimes|war atrocities]] against the civilian population, including biological warfare (see [[Unit 731]]) and the [[Three Alls Policy]] (''Sankō Sakusen''), the three alls being: ''"Kill All, Burn All and Loot All"''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fairbank |first1=J.

Following the defeat of Japan in 1945, the war between the Nationalist government forces and the CPC resumed, after failed attempts at reconciliation and a negotiated settlement. By 1949, the CPC had established control over most of the country ''(see [[Chinese Civil War]])''. Westad says the Communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than Chiang, and because in his search for a powerful centralized government, Chiang antagonized too many interest groups in China. Furthermore, his party was weakened in the war against the Japanese. Meanwhile, the Communists told different groups, such as peasants, exactly what they wanted to hear, and cloaked themselves in the cover of Chinese Nationalism.<ref>Odd Arne Westad, ''Restless Empire: China and the World Since 1750'' (2012) p 291</ref> During the civil war both the Nationalists and Communists carried out mass atrocities, with millions of non-combatants killed by both sides during the civil war.<ref>Rummel, Rudolph (1994), Death by Government.</ref> These included deaths from forced conscription and massacres.<ref>Valentino, Benjamin A.

{{main|History of the People's Republic of China}}
Major combat in the [[Chinese Civil War]] ended in 1949 with [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) pulling out of the mainland, with the government relocating to [[Taipei]] and maintaining control only over a few islands. The [[Communist Party of China]] was left in control of [[mainland China]]. On 1 October 1949, [[Mao Zedong]] proclaimed the People's Republic of China.<ref name="Ref_c">[http://www.isop.ucla.edu/eas/documents/mao490921.htm The Chinese people have stood up].

[[File:Mao proclaiming the establishment of the PRC in 1949.jpg|thumb|left|Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] proclaiming the establishment of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] in 1949.]]
The PRC was shaped by a [[List of campaigns of the Communist Party of China|series of campaigns]] and [[Five-year plans of the People's Republic of China|five-year plans]]. The economic and social plan known as the [[Great Leap Forward]] caused an estimated 45&nbsp;million deaths.<ref name="Akbar2010">{{Cite news|url =http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/maos-great-leap-forward-killed-45-million-in-four-years-2081630.html |title= Mao's Great Leap Forward 'killed 45 million in four years'|accessdate=30 October 2010 |publisher=The Independent|location=London|first=Arifa|last=Akbar|date=17 September 2010}}</ref> Mao's government carried out mass executions of landowners, instituted [[collectivisation]] and implemented the [[Laogai]] camp system. Execution, deaths from forced labor and other atrocities resulted in millions of deaths under Mao. In 1966 Mao and his allies launched the [[Cultural Revolution]], which continued until Mao's death a decade later. The Cultural Revolution, motivated by power struggles within the Party and a fear of the [[Soviet Union]], led to a major upheaval in Chinese society.

In 1972, at the peak of the [[Sino-Soviet split]], Mao and [[Zhou Enlai]] met US president [[Richard Nixon]] in Beijing to establish relations with the United States. In the same year, the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|PRC was admitted to the United Nations]] in place of the Republic of China, with permanent membership of the Security Council.

A power struggle followed Mao's death in 1976. The [[Gang of Four]] were arrested and blamed for the excesses of the Cultural Revolution, marking the end of a turbulent political era in China. [[Deng Xiaoping]] outmaneuvered Mao's anointed successor chairman [[Hua Guofeng]], and gradually emerged as the ''de facto'' leader over the next few years.

Deng Xiaoping was the [[Paramount Leader]] of China from 1978 to 1992, although he never became the head of the party or state, and his influence within the Party led the country to [[Chinese economic reform|significant economic reforms]]. The Communist Party subsequently loosened governmental control over citizens' personal lives and the [[People's commune|communes]] were disbanded with many peasants receiving multiple land leases, which greatly increased incentives and agricultural production. This turn of events marked China's transition from a planned economy to a mixed economy with an increasingly open market environment, a system termed by some<ref name="Ref_e">{{cite web | last=Hart-Landsberg | first=Martin | last2=Burkett | first2=Paul | url= http://www.monthlyreview.org/chinaandsocialism.htm | title =China and Socialism: Market Reforms and Class Struggle | publisher = Monthly Review Press | ISBN=1-58367-123-4 | date=March 2010 | accessdate=30 October 2008}}</ref> as "[[market socialism]]", and officially by the Communist Party of China as "[[Socialism with Chinese characteristics]]". The PRC adopted its current [[constitution of the People's Republic of China|constitution]] on 4 December 1982.

In 1989 the death of former general secretary [[Hu Yaobang]] helped to spark the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], during which students and others campaigned for several months, speaking out against corruption and in favour of greater political reform, including democratic rights and freedom of speech. However, they were eventually put down on 4 June when [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]] troops and vehicles entered and forcibly cleared the square, with many fatalities. This event was widely reported, and brought worldwide condemnation and sanctions against the government.<ref name="Ref_f">Youngs, R. ''The European Union and the Promotion of Democracy.''

CPC general secretary and PRC President [[Jiang Zemin]] and PRC Premier [[Zhu Rongji]], both former mayors of Shanghai, led post-Tiananmen PRC in the 1990s. Under Jiang and Zhu's ten years of administration, the PRC's economic performance pulled an estimated 150&nbsp;million peasants out of poverty and sustained an average annual gross domestic product growth rate of 11.2%.<ref name="Ref_h">{{cite news | url =http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-07/11/content_244499.htm | title = Nation bucks trend of global poverty | date=11 July 2003 | newspaper=China Daily}}</ref><ref name="Ref_i">{{cite news | url = http://english.people.com.cn/english/200003/01/eng20000301X115.html | title = China's Average Economic Growth in 90s Ranked 1st in World | date= 1 March 2000 | newspaper = People's Daily}}</ref> The country formally joined the [[World Trade Organization]] in 2001.

Although the PRC needs economic growth to spur its development, the government began to worry that rapid economic growth was degrading the country's resources and environment. Another concern is that certain sectors of society are not sufficiently benefiting from the PRC's economic development; one example of this is the wide gap between urban and rural areas. As a result, under former CPC general secretary and President [[Hu Jintao]] and Premier [[Wen Jiabao]], the PRC initiated policies to address issues of equitable distribution of resources, but the outcome was not known {{As of|2014|lc=y}}.<ref name="Ref_j">{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4913622.stm | title = China worried over pace of growth | publisher=BBC | accessdate=16 April 2006}}</ref> More than 40&nbsp;million farmers were displaced from their land,<ref name="Ref_k">{{cite journal | url = http://migration.ucdavis.edu/mn/more.php?id=3166_0_3_0 | title = China: Migrants, Students, Taiwan | journal = Migration News | date=January 2006 | volume=13 |issue=1}}</ref> usually for economic development, contributing to 87,000 demonstrations and riots across China in 2005.<ref name="Ref_l">{{cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/27/AR2006012701588.html |title = In Face of Rural Unrest, China Rolls Out Reforms | newspaper = The Washington Post | date=28 January 2006}}</ref> For much of the PRC's population, living standards improved very substantially and freedom increased, but political controls remained tight and rural areas poor.<ref>{{cite web |last=Thomas | first=Antony | url= http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tankman/etc/transcript.html | title=''Frontline'': ''The Tank Man'' transcript | accessdate=12 July 2008 |date=11 April 2006 |work=Frontline |publisher=PBS }}</ref>
