An early leader was<space/><link><target>Jean-Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval</target></link>, an 18th-century French<space/><link><target>artillery</target><part>artillerist</part></link><space/>who created a fair amount of<space/><link><target>standardization</target></link><space/>of artillery pieces, although not true interchangeability of parts. He inspired others, including<space/><link><target>Honor Blanc</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Louis de Tousard</target></link>, to work further on the idea, and on shoulder weapons as well as artillery. In the 19th century these efforts produced the &quot;armory system,&quot; or<space/><link><target>American system of manufacturing</target></link>. Certain other New Englanders, including<space/><link><target>Captain John H. Hall</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Simeon North</target></link>, arrived at successful interchangeability before Whitney's armory did. The Whitney armory finally succeeded not long after his death in 1825.</paragraph><paragraph>The motives behind Whitney's acceptance of a contract to manufacture muskets in 1798 were mostly monetary. By the late 1790s, Whitney was on the verge of bankruptcy and the cotton gin litigation had left him deeply in<space/><link><target>debt</target></link>. His<space/><link><target>New Haven</target></link><space/>cotton gin factory had burned to the ground, and litigation sapped his remaining resources. The<space/><link><target>French Revolution</target></link><space/>had ignited new conflicts between Great Britain, France, and the United States. The new American government, realizing the need to prepare for war, began to rearm. The<space/><link><target>United States Department of War</target><part>War Department</part></link><space/>issued contracts for the manufacture of 10,000 muskets. Whitney, who had never made a gun in his life, obtained a contract in January 1798 to deliver 10,000 to 15,000 muskets in 1800. He had not mentioned interchangeable parts at that time. Ten months later, the Treasury Secretary,<space/><link><target>Oliver Wolcott, Jr.</target></link>, sent him a &quot;foreign pamphlet on arms manufacturing techniques,&quot; possibly one of Honor Blanc's reports, after which Whitney first began to talk about interchangeability.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Eli Whitney Gun Factory William Giles Munson 1827.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>250px</part><part>Whitney's gun factory in 1827</part></link>In May 1798, Congress voted for legislation that would use eight hundred thousand dollars in order to pay for small arms and cannons in case war with France erupted. They offered a 5,000 dollar incentive with an additional 5,000 dollars once that money was exhausted for the person that was able to accurately produce arms for the government. Because the cotton gin had not brought Whitney the rewards he believed he would get, he accepted the contract. Although the contract was for one year, Whitney did not deliver the arms until eight years later in 1809 using multiple excuses for the delay of such. Recently, historians have found that during 18011806, Whitney took the money and headed into South Carolina in order to profit from the cotton gin.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Baida1987"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Although Whitney's demonstration of 1801 appeared to show the ingenuity of interchangeable parts,<space/><link><target>Merritt Roe Smith</target></link><space/>concludes that Whitney's demonstration was &quot;staged&quot; and &quot;duped government authorities&quot; into believing that he had created interchangeable parts. The charade was only useful in order to gain more time and resources for the project but not to create interchangeable parts.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Baida1987"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>When the government complained that Whitney's price per musket compared unfavorably with those produced in government armories, Whitney was able to calculate an actual price per musket by including<space/><link><target>fixed cost</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>such as insurance and<space/><link><target>machinery</target></link>, which the government had not included.

The cotton seeds would not fit through the mesh and fell outside. Whitney occasionally told a story wherein he was pondering an improved method of seeding the cotton when he was inspired by observing a cat attempting to pull a chicken through a fence, and could only pull through some of the feathers.</paragraph><paragraph>A single cotton gin could generate up to<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>55</arg><arg>lb</arg></template><space/>of cleaned cotton daily.

Rather, like the proprietors of<space/><link><target>gristmill</target><part>grist</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>sawmill</target><trail>s</trail></link>, they expected to charge farmers for cleaning their cotton two-fifths of the value, paid in cotton.
