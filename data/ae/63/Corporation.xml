Today, corporations are usually registered with the state, province, or national government and regulated by the laws enacted by that government. Registration is the main prerequisite to the corporation's assumption of limited liability. The law sometimes requires the corporation to designate its principal address, as well as a<space/><link><target>registered agent</target></link><space/>(a person or company designated to receive legal service of process).

Historically, some corporations were named after their membership: for instance, &quot;The President and Fellows of Harvard College.&quot; Nowadays, corporations in most jurisdictions have a distinct name that does not need to make reference to their membership. In Canada, this possibility is taken to its logical extreme: many smaller Canadian corporations have no names at all, merely numbers based on a registration number (for example, &quot;12345678 Ontario Limited&quot;), which is assigned by the provincial or territorial government where the corporation incorporates.</paragraph><paragraph>In most countries, corporate names include a term or an abbreviation that denotes the corporate status of the entity (for example, &quot;Incorporated&quot; or &quot;Inc.&quot; in the United States) or the limited liability of its members (for example, &quot;Limited&quot; or &quot;Ltd.&quot;). These terms vary by jurisdiction and language. In some jurisdictions they are mandatory, and in others they are not.<extension extension_name='ref'>The U.S. state of California is an example of a jurisdiction that does not require corporations to indicate corporate status in their names, except for close corporations. The drafters of the 1977 revision of the California General Corporation Law considered the possibility of forcing all California corporations to have a name indicating corporate status, but decided against it because of the huge number of corporations that would have had to change their names, and the lack of any evidence that anyone had been harmed in California by entities whose corporate status was not immediately apparent from their names. However, the 1977 drafters were able to impose the current disclosure requirement for close corporations. See Harold Marsh, Jr., R. Roy Finkle, Larry W.
