The [[Himalaya]], [[Karakoram]], [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] and [[Tian Shan]] mountain ranges separate China from [[South Asia|South]] and [[Central Asia]]. The [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] and [[Yellow River]]s, the third- and sixth-longest in the world, run from the [[Tibetan Plateau]] to the densely populated eastern seaboard. China's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is {{convert|14500|km|mi}} long, and is bounded by the [[Bohai Sea|Bohai]], [[Yellow Sea|Yellow]], [[East China Sea|East]] and [[South China Sea]]s.

China is a [[cradle of civilization]], with its known history beginning with an ancient civilization – one of the world's earliest – that flourished in the fertile basin of the [[Yellow River]] in the [[North China Plain]]. For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, known as [[Dynasties in Chinese history|dynasties]], beginning with the semi-mythological [[Xia Dynasty|Xia]] of the Yellow River basin{{citation needed span|text=(c. 2800 BCE)|date=November 2015}}. Since 221 BCE, when the [[Qin Dynasty]] first conquered several states to form a Chinese empire, the country has expanded, fractured and reformed numerous times. The [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] (ROC) overthrew the [[Qing Dynasty|last dynasty]] in 1911, and ruled the [[mainland China|Chinese mainland]] until 1949. After [[World War II]], the Communist Party defeated the nationalist [[Kuomintang]] in mainland China and established the People's Republic of China in Beijing on 1 October 1949, while the Kuomintang relocated the ROC government to its present capital of [[Taipei]].

China had the largest and most complex economy in the world for most of the past two thousand years, during which it has seen cycles of [[prosperity]] and decline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED460052&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=ED460052|last=Dahlman|first= Carl J|last2= Aubert|first2=Jean-Eric |title=China and the Knowledge Economy: Seizing the 21st Century.

The word "China" is thought to have been originally derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''[[Chinas|Cīna]]'' ({{lang|sa|चीन}}), which is translated into the [[Persian language|Persian]] word ''Chīn'' ({{lang|fa|چین}}).<ref name="AmHer">"[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/China?qsrc=2888 China]".

The official name of the modern country is the People's Republic of China ({{zh| s=中华人民共和国| hp=Zhōnghuá Rénmín Gònghéguó}}). The common Chinese names for the country are ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|Zhōngguó}}'' ({{zh|s=[[wikt:中国|中国]]}}, from ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|zhōng}}'', "central" or "middle", and ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|guó}}'', "state" or "states", and in modern times, "nation") and ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|Zhōnghuá}}'' ({{zh|s=[[wikt:中华|中华]]|links=no}}), although the country's official name has been changed numerous times by successive [[Dynasties in Chinese history|dynasties]] and modern governments. The term ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|Zhōngguó}}'' appeared in various ancient texts, such as the ''[[Classic of History]]'' of the 6th century BCE,{{efn|[[:wikisource:zh:尚書/梓材|《尚書•梓材》]]:「皇天既付中國民越厥疆土于先王」}} and in pre-imperial times it was often used as a cultural concept to distinguish the [[Huaxia]] tribes from perceived "barbarians". The term, which can be either singular or plural, referred to the group of states or provinces in the [[Central Plain (China)|central plain]], but was not used as a name for the country as a whole until the nineteenth century. The Chinese were not unique in regarding their country as "central", with other civilizations having the same view of themselves.<ref>Wilkinson, Endymion (2000). ''Chinese History: A Manual''.

By the time of the [[Warring States period]] of the 5th–3rd centuries BCE, there were seven powerful sovereign states in what is now China, each with its own king, ministry and army.

The Warring States period ended in 221 BCE after the [[state of Qin]] conquered the other six kingdoms and established the first unified Chinese state. [[Qin Shi Huang]], the emperor of Qin, proclaimed himself "First Emperor" ({{lang|zh-hans|始皇帝}}) and imposed reforms throughout China, notably the forced standardization of Chinese characters, measurements, length of cart axles, and currency.

In 1644, Beijing was captured by a coalition of peasant rebel forces led by [[Li Zicheng]]. The last Ming [[Chongzhen Emperor]] committed suicide when the city fell. The Manchu [[Qing Dynasty]] then allied with Ming Dynasty general [[Wu Sangui]] and overthrew Li's short-lived [[Shun Dynasty]], and subsequently seized control of Beijing, which became the new capital of the Qing Dynasty.

As a [[Conquest Dynasties|conquest dynasty]], it strengthened the feudal autocracy to crackdown [[anti-Qing sentiment]].

The Qing dynasty also began experiencing internal unrest in which millions of people died. In the 1850s and 1860s, the failed [[Taiping Rebellion]] ravaged southern China.

The initial success of the [[Self-Strengthening Movement]] of the 1860s was frustrated by the series of military defeats in the 1880s and 1890s.

In the 19th century, the great [[Chinese emigration|Chinese Diaspora]] began. Losses due to emigration were added to by conflicts and catastrophes such as the [[Northern Chinese Famine of 1876–79]], in which between 9 and 13 million people died.<ref>[http://www.fao.org/docrep/U8480E/U8480E05.htm "Dimensions of need – People and populations at risk"]. 1995.

The territory of China lies between [[latitude]]s [[18th parallel north|18°]] and [[54th parallel north|54° N]], and [[longitude]]s [[73rd meridian east|73°]] and [[135th meridian east|135° E]]. China's landscapes vary significantly across its vast width. In the east, along the shores of the [[Yellow Sea]] and the [[East China Sea]], there are extensive and densely populated [[alluvium|alluvial plains]], while on the edges of the Inner Mongolian plateau in the north, broad [[grassland]]s predominate. Southern China is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges, while the central-east hosts the [[river delta|deltas]] of China's two major rivers, the [[Yellow River]] and the [[Yangtze River]]. Other major rivers include the [[Xi River|Xi]], [[Mekong]], [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] and [[Amur River|Amur]]. To the west sit major mountain ranges, most notably the Himalayas. High [[plateau]]s feature among the more arid landscapes of the north, such as the [[Taklamakan Desert|Taklamakan]] and the [[Gobi Desert]]. The world's highest point, [[Mount Everest]] (8,848m), lies on the Sino-Nepalese border.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nepal and China agree on Mount Everest's height|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8608913.stm|newspaper=BBC News|date=8 April 2010}}</ref> The country's lowest point, and the world's third-lowest, is the dried lake bed of [[Ayding Lake]] (−154m) in the [[Turpan Depression]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Lowest Places on Earth|url=http://www.nps.gov/deva/naturescience/lowest-places-on-earth.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2 December 2013}}</ref>

China's climate is mainly dominated by [[dry season]]s and wet [[monsoons]], which lead to pronounced temperature differences between winter and summer. In the winter, northern winds coming from high-latitude areas are cold and dry; in summer, southern winds from coastal areas at lower latitudes are warm and moist.<ref>{{cite book|title=Regional Climate Studies of China|year=2008|publisher=Springer|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEO_RyNDJ0gC&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9783540792420}}</ref> The climate in China differs from region to region because of the country's highly complex [[topography]].

From its founding in 1949 until late 1978, the People's Republic of China was a Soviet-style centrally [[planned economy]]. Following Mao's death in 1976 and the consequent end of the [[Cultural Revolution]], [[Deng Xiaoping]] and the new Chinese leadership began to [[Economic reform in the People's Republic of China|reform the economy]] and move towards a more market-oriented [[mixed economy]] under one-party rule. [[Collective farming|Agricultural collectivization]] was dismantled and farmlands privatized, while foreign trade became a major new focus, leading to the creation of [[Special Economic Zone]]s (SEZs). Inefficient [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned enterprises]] (SOEs) were restructured and unprofitable ones were closed outright, resulting in massive job losses.

==Culture==

Since ancient times, Chinese culture has been heavily influenced by [[Confucianism]] and conservative philosophies. For much of the country's dynastic era, opportunities for social advancement could be provided by high performance in the prestigious [[imperial examination]]s, which have their origins in the [[Han Dynasty]].<ref>{{cite book|title=China: Understanding Its Past|year=1997|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|page=29}}</ref> The [[Chinese literature|literary emphasis]] of the exams affected the general perception of cultural refinement in China, such as the belief that [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]], [[Classical Chinese poetry|poetry]] and [[Chinese painting|painting]] were higher forms of art than dancing or drama. Chinese culture has long emphasized a sense of deep history and a largely inward-looking national perspective.<ref name="ChinaFuture" /> Examinations and a [[meritocracy|culture of merit]] remain greatly valued in China today.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Historical and Contemporary Exam-driven Education Fever in China|journal=KEDI Journal of Educational Policy|year=2005|volume=2|issue=1|pages=17–33 |url=http://suen.educ.psu.edu/~hsuen/pubs/KEDI%20Yu.pdf}}</ref>

The first leaders of the People's Republic of China were born into the traditional imperial order, but were influenced by the [[May Fourth Movement]] and reformist ideals. They sought to change some traditional aspects of Chinese culture, such as rural land tenure, [[sexism]], and the Confucian system of education, while preserving others, such as the family structure and culture of obedience to the state. Some observers see the period following the establishment of the PRC in 1949 as a continuation of traditional Chinese dynastic history, while others claim that the Communist Party's rule has damaged the foundations of Chinese culture, especially through political movements such as the [[Cultural Revolution]] of the 1960s, where many aspects of traditional culture were destroyed, having been denounced as "regressive and harmful" or "vestiges of [[feudalism]]". Many important aspects of traditional Chinese morals and culture, such as Confucianism, art, literature, and performing arts like [[Peking opera]],<ref name="Ref_abcded">{{cite web|url=http://en.cnta.gov.cn|title=Tour Guidebook: Beijing|publisher=China National Tourism Administration|accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref> were altered to conform to government policies and propaganda at the time.
