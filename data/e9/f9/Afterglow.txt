An '''afterglow''' is a broad high arch of whitish or rosy light appearing in the [[sky]] due to very fine particles of [[dust]] suspended in the high regions of the [[earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. An afterglow may appear above the highest [[cloud]]s in the hour of deepening [[twilight]], or [[reflection (optics)|reflected]] from the high [[snow]]fields in [[mountain]] regions long after [[sunset]]. The particles produce a [[scattering]] effect upon the component parts of [[white]] [[light]]. The true [[alpenglow]], which occurs long after sunset or long before sunrise, is caused by the [[backscattering]] of red sunlight by [[aerosols]] and fine dust particles low in the atmosphere. It is an afterglow caused by [[Illumination|direct illumination]] of atmospheric particles by sunlight as it [[Refraction|refracts]] and gets [[Rayleigh scattering|scattered]] through the earth's atmosphere. The [[Energy of light|high-energy]] and [[high-frequency]] light is [[Scattering of electromagnetic radiation|scattered]] out the most and the remaining low-energy, low-frequency reaches the observer in the [[horizon]] at [[twilight]]. The [[backscattering]] of this light further turns it pinkish-red. This period of time is referred to as the [[blue hour]] and is widely treasured by [[photographers]] and [[painters]] as it offers breathtaking imagery.
The afterglow persists till the [[earth's shadow]] (terminator line) takes over the [[sky]] of the observer as nightfall and the stars appear, with planet [[Venus]] being the brightest star visible in the [[night sky]] just opposite to the [[Belt of Venus]] at the [[Antisolar point|anti-solar point]].

After the [[1883 eruption of Krakatoa|eruption]] of the [[volcano]] [[Krakatoa]] in 1883, a remarkable series of red [[sunset]]s appeared worldwide. These were due to an enormous amount of exceedingly fine dust blown to a great height by the volcano's explosion, and then globally diffused by the high atmospheric currents. [[Edvard Munch]]'s painting ''[[The Scream]]'' possibly depicts an afterglow during this period.
