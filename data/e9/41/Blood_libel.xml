The accusation of drawing off the blood (without murder) was not made until the beginning of the 17th century, when the cult was founded. The older inscription in the church of Rinn, dating from 1575, is distorted by fabulous embellishments&amp;mdash;for example, that the money paid for the boy to his godfather turned into leaves, and that a lily blossomed upon his grave.
