'''Antonio Canova''' ({{IPA-it|anˈtɔːnjo kaˈnɔːva}}; 1 November 1757 – 13 October 1822) was an [[Italians|Italian]] [[neoclassical]] [[sculpture|sculptor]], famous for his [[marble sculpture]]s. Often regarded as the greatest of the [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] artists,<ref name="DoA-22">"Neo-Classical", ''The Dictionary of Art'': volume XXII, ed. Jane Turner, in thirty-four volumes, 1996. Grove's Dictionaries Inc., New York, 1998.

==Biography==

===Possagno===
In 1757, Antonio Canova was born in [[Possagno]], [[Veneto]] to Pietro Canova, a stonecutter.<ref name="DoA-5">"Canova, Antonio", ''The Dictionary of Art'': volume V,  ed. Jane Turner, in thirty-four volumes, 1996. Grove's Dictionaries Inc., New York, 1998. Print.</ref>   In 1761, his father died. A year later, his mother remarried. As such, in 1762, he was put into the care of his paternal grandfather Pasino Canova, who was a [[stonemasonry|stone manson]], owner of a [[quarry]],<ref name="GoV"/> and was a "sculptor who specialized in altars with statues and low reliefs in late Baroque style".<ref name="DoA-5"/> He lead Antonio into the art of sculpting.

Prior to begin ten years old, Canova was already making models in clay, and carving marble.<ref name="CA">{{cite web|last=Catholic Encyclopedia|title=Antonio Canova|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03298b.htm|publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia|accessdate=24 March 2013}}</ref> Indeed, at the age of nine, he executed two small shrines of [[Carrara marble]], which are still extant.<ref name="EB1911">[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Canova,_Antonio "Canova, Antonio", Encyclopaedia Britannica'': volume V. 1991. Web.]</ref> After these works, he appears to have been constantly employed under his grandfather.<ref name="EB1911"/>

===Venice===
[[File:Antonio canova, orfeo, 1777, 01.JPG|thumb|125px|right|''[[Orpheus]]'', (1777)]]

In 1770,<ref name="DoA-5"/> he was an apprentice for two years<ref name="CA"/> to [[Giuseppe Bernardi]], who was also known as 'Torretto'. Afterwards, he was under the tutelage [[Giovanni Ferrari]] until he began his studies at the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia]].<ref name="DoA-5"/> At the Academy, he won several prizes.<ref name="EB1911"/> During this time, he was given his first workshop within a monastery by some local monks.<ref name="CA"/>

The Senator Giovanni Falier commissioned Canova to produce statues of [[Orpheus]] and [[Eurydice]] for his garden - the Villa Falier at [[Asolo]].<ref name="wga.hu">{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/html_m/c/canova/1/02orpheu.html|title=Eurydice by CANOVA, Antonio|work=wga.hu}}</ref> The statues were begun in 1775, and both were completed by 1777. The pieces explify the late [[Rococo style]].<ref name="wga.hu"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/html_m/c/canova/1/01orpheu.html|title=Orpheus by CANOVA, Antonio|work=wga.hu}}</ref> On the year of its completion, both works were exhibited for the [[Feast of the Ascension]] in Piazza S. Marco.<ref name="GoV"/> Widely praised, the works won Canova his first renown among the Venetian elite.<ref name="DoA-5"/>

In 1779, he opened his own studio at Calle Del Traghetto at S. Maurizio,.<ref name="GoV"/> At this time, Procurator Pietro Vettor Pisani commissioned Canova's first marble statue: a depiction of [[Daedalus]] and [[Icarus]].<ref name="GoV"/> The statue inspired great adirmation for his work at the annual art fair;<ref name="wga.hu1">{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/html_m/c/canova/1/1daedalu.html|title=Daedalus and Icarus by CANOVA, Antonio|work=wga.hu}}</ref> Canova was paid for 100 gold zecchini for the completed work.<ref name="GoV"/> At the base of the statue, Daedalus' tools are scattered about; these tools are also an allusion to Sculpture, of which the statue is a personification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/html_m/c/canova/1/1daedalx.html|title=Daedalus and Icarus by CANOVA, Antonio|work=wga.hu}}</ref> With such an intention, there is suggestion that Daedalus is a portrait of Canova's grandfather Pasino.<ref name="wga.hu1"/>

===Rome===
Canova arrived in Rome, on 28 December 1780.<ref name="EB1911"/> Prior to his departure, his friends had applied to the Venetian senate for a pension.<ref name="EB1911"/> Successful in the application, the stipend alloted amounted to three hundred ducats, limited to three years.<ref name="EB1911"/>

While in Rome, Canova spent time studying and sketching the works of Michelangelo.<ref name="DoA-5"/>

[[File:Canova - Theseus & Minotaur.jpg|thumb|right|Theseus and the Minotaur, [[V&A]], London]]

In 1781, Girolamo Zulian - the Venetian ambassador to Rome - hired Canova to sculpt ''Theseus and the Minotaur''.<ref name="wga.hu2">{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/html_m/c/canova/1/2theseus.html|title=Theseus and the Minotaur by CANOVA, Antonio|work=wga.hu}}</ref> The statue depicts the victorious [[Theseus]] seated on the lifeless body of a [[Minotaur]]. The initial spectators were certain that the work was a copy of a Greek original, and were shocked to learn it was a contemporary work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/sculpture/antonio-canova.htm|title=Antonio Canova: Neoclassical Sculptor, Biography|work=visual-arts-cork.com}}</ref> The work was regarded with fervent admiration. The work is now in the collections of the [[Victoria & Albert Museum]], in London.<ref name="wga.hu2"/>

Canova then took to building the funerary monument of [[Clement XIV]] for the [[Church of Santi Apostoli]].<ref name="CA"/> He eventually completed it in 1787. He spent about two years arranging the design and composing the models for the tomb of the pontiff, and another two years to finishing the monument.<ref name="EB1911"/> The work, in the opinion of enthusiastic ''dilettanti'', stamped the author as the first artist of modern times.<ref name="EB1911"/>

After five years, he completed another [[cenotaph]] in 1792; this one was to the memory of [[Clement XIII]]. Canova styled the piece to function in harmony with the Baroque funerary monuments in [[St. Peter's Basilica]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/html_m/c/canova/1/4clemenu.html|title=Tomb of Pope Clement XIII by CANOVA, Antonio|work=wga.hu}}</ref>

In 1790, he began to work on a funerary monument for Titian; however, it was eventually abandoned by 1795.<ref name="DoA-5"/> During the same year, he increased his activity as a painter.<ref name="GoV"/>

The following decade was extremely productive,<ref name="EB1911"/> beginning  works such as ''Hercules and Lichas'', ''Cupid and Psyche'', ''Hebe'', ''Tomb of [[Maria Christina, Duchess of Teschen|Duchess Maria Christina of Saxony-Teschen]]'', and ''The Penitent Magdalene''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/html_m/c/canova/1/index.html|title=Sculptures until 1799|work=wga.hu}}</ref>

In 1797, he went to Vienna,<ref name="auto"/> but only a year later, in 1798, he returned to [[Possagno]] for a year.<ref name="EB1911"/>{{refn|''The Glory of Venice: Art in the Eighteenth Century'' states (pg. 441) that Canova left Venice when it fell, tried to escape to America and then went to Possagno. The fall of Venice was in 1796. There appears to be some gap in knowledge that would correct or amend these accounts. The first reference to Vienna is an online source, the second is the ''Encylopaedia Britannica, 1911'' which has already proven itself incorrect in some areas. ''The Glory of Venice'' has proven itself more accurate, but it is undated, leaving speculation of time frame.|group=notes}}

===France & England===
By 1800, Canova was the most celebrated artist in Europe.<ref name="DoA-5"/> He systematically promoted his reputation by publishing engravings of his works and having marble versions of plaster casts made in his workshop.<ref name="Batschmann">Oskar Batschmann, The Artist in the Modern World: A Conflict Between Market and Self-Expression. DuMont Bunchverlag, 1997. Print.</ref> He became so successful that he had acquired patrons from across Europe including France, England, Russia, Poland, Austria and Holland, as well as several members from different royal lineages, and prominent individuals.<ref name="GoV"/> Among his patrons, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] and his family was provided by Canova with much work, producing several depictations between 1803 and 1809.<ref name="DoA-22"/> The most notable representations were that of ''[[Napoleon as Mars the Peacemaker]]'', and ''[[Venus Victrix (Canova)|Venus Victrix]]'' which was portrayal of [[Pauline Bonaparte]].

''[[Napoleon as Mars the Peacemaker]]'' had its inception after Canova was hired to make a bust of Napoleon in 1802. The statue was begun in 1803, with Napoleon requesting to be shown in a French General's uniform, Canova rejected this, insisting on an allusion to [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], the [[Roman mythology|Roman god]] of [[War]].<ref name="wga.hu3">{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/html_m/c/canova/2/1mars.html|title=Napoleon as Mars the Peacemaker by CANOVA, Antonio|work=wga.hu}}</ref> It was completed in 1806.<ref name="wga.hu4">{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/html_m/c/canova/2/2mars.html|title=Napoleon as Mars the Peacemaker by CANOVA, Antonio|work=wga.hu}}</ref> In 1811, the statue arrived in Paris, but not installed; neither was its bronze copy in the Foro Napoleonico in Milan.<ref name="wga.hu3"/> In 1815, the original went to [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|the Duke of Wellington]], after his victory at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] against Napoleon.<ref name="wga.hu4"/>

{{rquote|right|''If one could make statues by caressing marble, I would say that this statue was formed by wearing out the marble that surrounded it with caresses and kiss''|[[Joséphine de Beauharnais]] on the ''[[Venus Victrix (Canova)|Venus Victrix]]''<ref name="DoA-5"/>}}

''[[Venus Victrix (Canova)|Venus Victrix]]'' ranks among the most famous of Canova's works. Originally, Canova wished the depictation to be of Diana, who could be represented with a robe, but Pauline insisted to appear nude.<ref name="wga.hu5">{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/html_m/c/canova/2/3paolina.html|title=Paolina Borghese as Venus Victrix by CANOVA, Antonio|work=wga.hu}}</ref> The work was not intended for public viewing.<ref name="wga.hu5"/>

Other works for the Napoleon family include, a bust of Napoleon, a statue of Napoleon's mother, and [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Marie Louise]] as [[Concordia (mythology)|Concordia]].<ref name="CA"/>

In 1802, Canova was assigned the post of 'Inspector-General of Antiquities and Fine Art of the Papal State', a position formerly held by [[Raphael]].<ref name="GoV"/>

In 1814, he began his ''[[The Three Graces (sculpture)|The Three Graces]]''.<ref name="CA"/>

In 1815, he was named 'Minister Plenipotentiary of the Pope,'<ref name="GoV"/> and was tasked with recovering various works of art that were taken to Paris by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]].<ref name="EB1911"/>

{{rquote|right|''The works of Phidias are truly flesh and blood, like beautiful nature itself''|Antonio Canova<ref name="GoV"/>}}

Also in 1815, he visited London, and met with [[Benjamin Haydon]]. It was after the advice of Canova that the [[Elgin marbles]] were acquired by the British Museum, with plaster copies sent to Florence, according to Canova's request.<ref name="EB1911"/>

===Returning to Rome, Venice, and Possagno===
In 1816, Canova returned to Rome with some of the art Napoleon had taken. He was rewarded with several marks of distinction: he was appointed President of the [[Accademia di San Luca]], inscribed into the "Golden Book of Roman Nobles" by the Pope's own hands,<ref name="CA"/> and given the title of Marquis of [[Ischia]], alongside an annual pension of 3000 crowns.<ref name="EB1911"/>

In 1819, he commence and completed his commissioned work ''Venus Italica'' as a replacement for the [[Venus de' Medici]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/html_m/c/canova/2/8venus.html|title=Venus Italica by CANOVA, Antonio|work=wga.hu}}</ref>

After his 1814 proposal to build a personified statue of Religion for [[St. Peter's Basilica]] was rejected, Canova sought to build his own temple to house it.<ref name="DoA-5"/> This project came to be the [[Tempio Canoviano]]. Canova designed, financed, and partly built the structure himself.<ref name="GoV"/> The structure was to be a testament to Canova's piety.<ref name="Batschmann"/> The building's design was inspired by combining the [[Parthenon]] and the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] together.<ref name="GoV"/><ref name="CA"/> On 11 July 1819, Canova laid the foundation stone dressed in red Papal uniform and decorated with all his medals.<ref name="Batschmann"/> It first opened in 1830, and was finally completed in 1836.<ref name="Batschmann"/> After the foundation-stone of this edifice had been laid, Canova returned to Rome; but every succeeding autumn he continued to visit Possagno to direct the workmen and encourage them with rewards.<ref name="EB1911"/>

During the period that intervened between commencing operations at Possagno and his death, he executed or finished some of his most striking works. Among these were the group ''Mars and Venus'', the colossal figure of [[Pius VI]], the [[Pietà]], the ''St John'', and a colossal bust of his friend, the Count Cicognara.<ref name="EB1911"/>

[[File:Canova-Washington.JPG|thumb|upright|right|125px|''Washington'' on display at the [[North Carolina Museum of History]]]]

In 1820, he made a statue of [[George Washington]] for the state of [[North Carolina]].<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/bio_m/c/canova/biograph.html|title=Biography of CANOVA, Antonio in the Web Gallery of Art|work=wga.hu}}</ref>

In 1822, he journeyed to Naples, to superintend the construction of wax moulds for an equestrian statue of [[Ferdinand VII]]. The adventure was disastrous to his health, but soon became healthy enough to return to Rome. From there, he voyaged to Venice; however, on 13 October 1822, he died there at the age of 64.<ref name="EB1911"/> As he never married, the name became extinct, except through his stepbrothers' lineage of Satori-Canova.<ref name="CA"/>

On 12 October 1822, Canova instructed his brother to use his entire estate to complete the Tempio in Possango.<ref name="Batschmann"/>

On 25 October 1822, his body was placed in the [[Tempio Canoviano]].<ref name="EB1911"/> His heart was interred at the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari]] in Venice, and his right hand preserved in a vase at the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia]].<ref name="DoA-5"/><ref name="EB1911"/><ref name="Batschmann"/>

His memoral service was so grand that it rivaled the ceremony that the city of Florence held for Michelangelo in 1564.<ref name="Batschmann"/>

In 1826, Giovanni Battista Sartori sold Canova's Roman studio and took every plaster model and sculpture to Possango, where they were installed in the [[Tempio Canoviano]].<ref name="Batschmann"/>

==Notable works==

===''Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss'' (1787)===
[[File:Amore e psiche (1).jpg|thumb|right|Detail of ''[[Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss]]'']]
{{Main|Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss}}

''[[Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss]]'' was commissioned in 1787 by [[John Campbell, 1st Baron Cawdor|Colonel John Campbell]].<ref name=Johns>Johns, C.M.S. (1998) ''Antonio Canova and the Politics of Patronage in Revolutionary and Napoleonic Europe''. Berkeley, CA: [[University of California Press]], p. 149.</ref> It is regarded as a [[masterpiece]] of [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] sculpture, but shows the mythological lovers at a moment of great emotion, characteristic of the emerging movement of [[Romanticism]].  It represents the god [[Cupid]] in the height of love and tenderness, immediately after awakening the lifeless [[Psyche (mortal)|Psyche]] with a kiss.

===''Napoleon as Mars the Peacemaker'' (1802-1806)===
{{Main|Napoleon as Mars the Peacemaker}}

''[[Napoleon as Mars the Peacemaker]]'' had its inception after Canova was hired to make a bust of Napoleon in 1802. The statue was begun in 1803, with Napoleon requesting to be shown in a French General's uniform, Canova rejected this, insisting on an allusion to [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], the [[Roman mythology|Roman god]] of [[War]].<ref name="wga.hu3"/> It was completed in 1806.<ref name="wga.hu4"/> In 1811, the statue arrived in Paris, but not installed; neither was its bronze copy in the Foro Napoleonico in Milan.<ref name="wga.hu3"/> In 1815, the original went to [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|the Duke of Wellington]], after his victory at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] against Napoleon.<ref name="wga.hu4"/>

===''Perseus Triumphant'' (1804-1806)===
[[File:Canova - perseu - 39b.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of ''Perseus with the Head of Medusa'']]
''Perseus Triumphant'', sometimes called ''Perseus with the Head of Medusa'', was a statue commissioned by tribune Onorato Duveyriez.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mv.vatican.va/3_EN/pages/x-Schede/MPCs/MPCs_Sala02_05.html|title=Perseus Triumphant|work=vatican.va}}</ref> It depicts the Greek hero [[Perseus]] after his victory of the [[Gorgon]] [[Medusa]].

The statue was based freely to the [[Apollo Belvedere]] and the [[Medusa Rondanini]].<ref name="metmuseum.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/67.110.1|title=Antonio Canova: Perseus with the Head of Medusa (67.110.1) - Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History - The Metropolitan Museum of Art|work=metmuseum.org}}</ref>

[[Napoleon]], after his [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars|1796 Italian Campaign]], took the [[Apollo Belvedere]] to Paris. In the statue's absence, [[Pope Pius VII]] acquired Canova's ''Perseus Triumphant'' and placed the work upon the ''Apollo'''s pedstal.<ref>
Christopher M. S. Johns, ''Antonia Canova and the Politics of Patronage in Revolutionary and Napoleonic Europe''. University of California Press, 1998. Web. - p. 25</ref> The statue was so successful that when the ''Apollo'' was returned, ''Perseus'' remained as a companion piece.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/html_m/c/canova/2/2perseu.html|title=Perseus with the Head of Medusa by CANOVA, Antonio|work=wga.hu}}</ref>

One replica of the statue was purchased from Canova by the Polish countess Valeria Tarnowska; it now resides in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]].<ref name="metmuseum.org"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/html_m/c/canova/2/2perseus.html|title=Perseus with the Head of Medusa by CANOVA, Antonio|work=wga.hu}}</ref>

[[Karl Ludwig Fernow]] said of the statue that "every eye must rest with pleasure on the beautiful surface, even when the mind finds its hopes of high and pure enjoyment disappointed."<ref name="Padiyar"/>

===''Venus Victrix'' (1805-1808)===
{{Main|Venus Victrix (Canova)}}

''[[Venus Victrix (Canova)|Venus Victrix]]'' ranks among the most famous of Canova's works. Originally, Canova wished the depictation to be of Diana, who could be represented with a robe, but Pauline insisted to appear nude.<ref name="wga.hu5"/> The work was not intended for public viewing.<ref name="wga.hu5"/>

===''The Three Graces'' (1814-1817)===
[[File:Le tre Grazie.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Three Graces (sculpture)|The Three Graces]]'']]
{{Main|The Three Graces (sculpture)}}

[[John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford|John Russell]], the 6th [[Duke]] of Bedford, commissioned a version of the now famous work.<ref>[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/t/the-three-graces/ The Three Graces.] Victoria & Albert Museum, 2013. Retrieved 2 May 2013.</ref>  He had previously visited Canova in his studio in [[Rome]] in 1814 and had been immensely impressed by a carving of the Graces the sculptor had made for the [[Empress Josephine]].  When the Empress died in May of the same year he immediately offered to purchase the completed piece, but was unsuccessful as Josephine’s son [[Eugène de Beauharnais|Eugène]] claimed it (his son [[Maximilian, Duke of Leuchtenberg|Maximilian]] brought it to [[St. Petersburg]], where it can now be found in the [[Hermitage Museum]]). Undeterred, the Duke commissioned another version for himself.

The sculpting process began in 1814 and was completed in 1817.  Finally in 1819 it was installed at the Duke’s residence in [[Woburn Abbey]].  Canova even made the trip over to England to supervise its installation, choosing for it to be displayed on a [[pedestal]] adapted from a marble [[plinth]] with a rotating top.  This version is now owned jointly by the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] and the [[National Galleries of Scotland]], and is alternately displayed at each.

==Artistic process==
{{rquote|right|''Canova's system of work concentrated on the initial idea, and on the final carving of the marble''<ref name="DoA-5"/>}}

Canova's sculptures fall into three categories: Heroic compositions, compositions of grace, and sepulchral monuments.<ref name="EB1911"/> In each of these, Canova's underlying artistic motivations were to challenge, if not compete, with classical statues.<ref name="GoV"/>

Canova refused to take in pupils and students,<ref name="DoA-5"/> but would hire workers to carve the initial figure from the marble. He had an elaborate system of comparative pointing so that the workers were able to reproduce the plaster form in the selected block of marble.<ref name="Padiyar">Satish Padiyar, Chains: David, Canova, and the Fall of the Public Hero in Postrevolutionary France. Pennsylvania State University Press, 2007.</ref> These workers would leave a thin veil over the entire statue so Canova's could focus on the surface of the statue.<ref name="Padiyar"/>

While he worked, he had people read to him select literary and historical texts.<ref name="DoA-5"/>

===Last touch===
{{rquote|right|''The polish throws upon the parts which are lighted so great brilliancy as frequently to make invisible the most laborious diligence; it cannot be seen, because the strong reflected light dazzles the eyes''|Johann Joachim Winckelmann<ref name="Padiyar"/>}}

During the last quarter of the eigthteenth century, it became fashionable to view art galleries at night by torchlight. Canova was an artist that lept on the fad and displayed his works of art in his studio by candlelight.<ref name="Batschmann"/> As such, Canova would begin to finalize the statue with special tools by candlelight,<ref name="DoA-5"/> to soften the transitions between the various parts of the nude.<ref name="Padiyar"/> After a little recarving, he began to rub the statue down with pumice stone, sometimes for period longer that weeks or months.<ref name="Padiyar"/> If that was not enough, he would use [[Rotten stone|tripoli (rottenstone)]] and [[lead]].<ref name="Padiyar"/>

He then applied a now unknown chemical-composition of [[patina]] onto the flesh of the figure to lighten the skin tone.<ref name="DoA-5"/> Importantly, his friends also denied any usage of acids in his process.<ref name="CA"/>

==Criticisms==
Conversations revolving around the justification of art as superfluous usually invoked the name of Canova.<ref name="Batschmann"/>

[[Karl Ludwig Fernow]] believed that Canova was not [[Kant]]ian enough in Canova's aesthetic, because [[Critique of Judgment|emphasis seemed to have been placed on agreeableness rather than Beauty]].<ref name="Padiyar"/>

Canova was also faulted for creating works that were artificial in complexity.<ref name="GoV"/>

==Legacy==

{{cquote|''The importance and value of Canova's art is now recognized as holding in balance the last echo of the Ancients and the first symptom of the restless experimentation of the modern age''<ref name="DoA-5"/>}}

Canova spent large parts of his fortune helping young students and sending patrons to struggling sculptors,<ref name="auto"/> including Sir [[Richard Westmacott]] and [[John Gibson (sculptor)|John Gibson]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

He was introduced into various orders of [[chivalry]].<ref name="CA"/>

The [[Romantic period]] artists buried Canova's name soon after he died, but he is slowly being rediscovered.<ref name="DoA-5"/>
