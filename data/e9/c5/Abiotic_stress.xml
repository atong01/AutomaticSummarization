Although these effects may be either beneficial or detrimental, the location of the area is crucial in determining the extent of the impact that abiotic stress will have. The higher the latitude of the area affected, the greater the impact of abiotic stress will be on that area. So, a<space/><link><target>taiga</target></link><space/>or boreal forest is at the mercy of whatever abiotic stress factors may come along, while tropical zones are much less susceptible to such stressors.<extension extension_name='ref' name="wolf">Wolfe, A. Patterns of biodiversity. Ohio State University, 2007.</extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Benefits</heading><paragraph>One example of a situation where abiotic stress plays a constructive role in an ecosystem is in natural wildfires. While they can be a human safety hazard, it is productive for these ecosystems to burn out every once in a while so that new organisms can begin to grow and thrive.Even though it is healthy for an ecosystem, a wildfire can still be considered an abiotic stressor, because it puts an obvious stress on individual organisms within the area. Every tree that is scorched and each bird nest that is devoured is a sign of the abiotic stress. On the larger scale, though, natural wildfires are positive manifestations of abiotic stress.<extension extension_name='ref' name="bruss">Brussaard, Lijbert, Peter C. de Ruiter, and George G. Brown. Soil biodiversity for agricultural sustainability. Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment 121: 233244, 2007.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>What also needs to be taken into account when looking for benefits of abiotic stress, is that one phenomenon may not affect an entire ecosystem in the same way. While a flood will kill most plants living low on the ground in a certain area, if there is rice there, it will thrive in the wet conditions.Another example of this is in<space/><link><target>phytoplankton</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>zooplankton</target></link>. The same types of conditions are usually considered stressful for these two types of organisms. They act very similarly when exposed to ultraviolet light and most toxins, but at elevated temperatures the phytoplankton reacts negatively, while the<space/><link><target>thermophilic</target></link><space/>zooplankton reacts positively to the increase in temperature. The two may be living in the same environment, but an increase in temperature of the area would prove stressful only for one of the organisms.<extension extension_name='ref' name="vine"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Lastly, abiotic stress has enabled species to grow, develop, and evolve, furthering natural selection as it picks out the weakest of a group of organisms. Both plants and animals have evolved mechanisms allowing them to survive extremes.<extension extension_name='ref' name="roel">Roelofs, D. et al.

Functional Ecology 22: 818, 2008.</extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Detriments</heading><paragraph>The most obvious detriment concerning abiotic stress involves farming. It has been claimed by one study that abiotic stress causes the most crop loss of any other factor and that most major crops are reduced in their yield by more than 50% from their potential yield.<extension extension_name='ref'>Wang, W., Vinocur, B. and Altman, A. Plant responses to drought, salinity and extreme temperatures towards genetic engineering for stress tolerance. Planta 218: 1-14, 2007.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Because abiotic stress is widely considered a detrimental effect, the research on this branch of the issue is extensive. For more information on the harmful effects of abiotic stress, see the sections below on plants and animals.</paragraph><heading level='2'>In plants</heading><paragraph>A plants first line of defense against abiotic stress is in its roots. If the soil holding the plant is healthy and biologically diverse, the plant will have a higher chance of surviving stressful conditions.<extension extension_name='ref' name="bruss"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Facilitation, or the positive interactions between different species of plants, is an intricate web of association in a natural environment. It is how plants work together. In areas of high stress, the level of facilitation is especially high as well. This could possibly be because the plants need a stronger network to survive in a harsher environment, so their interactions between species, such as cross-pollination or mutualistic actions, become more common to cope with the severity of their habitat.<extension extension_name='ref'>Maestre, Fernando T., Jordi Cortina, and Susana Bautista. Mechanisms underlying the interaction between Pinus halepensis and the native late-successional shrub Pistacia lentiscus in a semi-arid plantation.

When a group of different plant species was prompted by a variety of different stress signals, such as drought or cold, each plant responded uniquely. Hardly any of the responses were similar, even though the plants had become accustomed to exactly the same home environment.<extension extension_name='ref' name="mitt"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Rice (<italics><link><target>Oryza sativa</target></link></italics>) is a classic example. Rice is a staple food throughout the world, especially in China and India. Rice plants experience different types of abiotic stresses, like drought and high salinity. These stress conditions have a negative impact on rice production. Genetic diversity has been studied among several rice varieties with different genotypes using molecular markers.</paragraph><heading level='2'>In animals</heading><paragraph>For animals, the most stressful of all the abiotic stressors is<space/><link><target>heat</target></link>. This is because many species are unable to regulate their internal<space/><link><target>body temperature</target></link>. Even in the species that are able to regulate their own<space/><link><target>temperature</target></link>, it is not always a completely accurate system. Temperature determines<space/><link><target>metabolic rate</target><trail>s</trail></link>,<space/><link><target>heart rate</target><trail>s</trail></link>, and other very important factors within the bodies of animals, so an extreme temperature change can easily distress the animals body. Animals can respond to extreme heat, for example, through natural heat acclimation or by burrowing into the ground to find a cooler space.<extension extension_name='ref' name="roel"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>It is also possible to see in animals that a high genetic diversity is beneficial in providing resiliency against harsh abiotic stressors. This acts as a sort of stock room when a species is plagued by the perils of natural selection. A variety of galling insects are among the most specialized and diverse herbivores on the planet, and their extensive protections against abiotic stress factors have helped the insect in gaining that position of honor.<extension extension_name='ref'>Goncalves-Alvim, Silmary J. and G.

If an environment is highly stressful, biodiversity tends to be low. If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.<extension extension_name='ref' name="bruss"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>This idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related. It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases.<extension extension_name='ref' name="wolf"></extension><space/>This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh.</paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Ecophysiology</target></link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>reflist</target><arg>2</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>modelling ecosystems</target></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>DEFAULTSORT:Abiotic Stress</target></template><link><target>Category:Stress</target></link><link><target>Category:Biodiversity</target></link><link><target>Category:Habitat</target></link></paragraph></article>
