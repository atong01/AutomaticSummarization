Cuzcatlec warriors moved to the coastal city of<space/><link><target>Acajutla</target></link><space/>and waited for Alvarado and his forces. Alvarado approached, confident that the result was going to be similar to what occurred in Mexico and Guatemala where the people believed the Spanish were gods. He thought he would easily defeat this new indigenous force since his Mexican allies and the Pipil of Cuzcatlan spoke a similar language.</paragraph><paragraph>The Indigenous peoples of El Salvador did not see the Spanish as gods, but as foreign invaders. Once Alvarado arrived, he saw that the Cuzcatan force outnumbered his Spanish soldiers and Mexican Indian allies. The Spanish decided to withdraw and the Cuzcatlec army attacked, running behind them with war chants and shooting bow arrows, with Alvarado having no choice but to fight to survive.</paragraph><paragraph>Alvarado described the Cuzcatlec soldiers in great detail as having shields made of colorful exotic feathers, a vest-like armor made of three inch cotton which arrows could not penetrate, and large spears. Both armies suffered many casualties, with a wounded Alvarado retreating and losing a lot of his men, especially among the Mexican Indian auxiliaries. Once his army had regrouped, Alvarado decided to head to the Cuzcatlan capital and again faced armed Cuzcatlec. Wounded, unable to fight and hiding in the cliffs, Alvarado sent his Spanish men on their horses to approach the Cuzcatlec to see if they would fear the horses, but they did not retreat, as Alvarado recalls in his letters to Hernan Cortez.</paragraph><paragraph>The Cuzcatlec attacked again, and on this occasion stole Spanish weaponry. Alvarado retreated and sent Mexican Indian messengers to demand that the Cuzcatlec warriors return the stolen weapons and surrender to the Spanish king, to which the Cuzcatlec responded with the famous response, &quot;If you want your weapons, come get them&quot;. As days passed, Alvarado, fearing an ambush, sent more Mexican Indian messengers to negotiate, but these messengers never came back and were presumably executed.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Templo tazumal.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>250px</part><part><link><target>Tazumal</target></link><space/>ruins in Santa Ana, El Salvador.</part></link>The Spanish efforts were firmly resisted by the indigenous people, including the Pipil and their Mayan-speaking neighbors; they defeated the Spaniards and what was left of their Mexican Tlaxcala Indian allies, forcing them to withdraw to Guatemala. After being wounded, Alvarado abandoned the war and appointed his brother,<space/><link><target>Gonzalo de Alvarado</target></link>, to continue the task. Two subsequent expeditions (the first in 1525, followed by a smaller group in 1528) brought the Pipil under Spanish control, with the Pipil also being weakened by a regional epidemic of<space/><link><target>smallpox</target></link>. In 1525, the conquest of Cuzcatln was completed and the city of<space/><link><target>San Salvador</target></link><space/>was established. The Spanish faced much resistance from the Pipil and were not able to reach eastern El Salvador, the area of the Lencas.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1526 the Spanish founded the garrison town of<space/><link><target>San Miguel, El Salvador</target><part>San Miguel</part></link>, headed by another explorer and conquistador,<space/><link><target>Luis de Moscoso Alvarado</target></link>, nephew of Pedro Alvarado. Oral history holds that a Maya-Lenca woman, crown Princess Antu Silan Ulap I, organized resistance to the conquistadors. The Lenca kingdom was alarmed by de Moscoso's invasion, and Antu Silan travelled from village to village, uniting all the Lenca towns in present-day El Salvador and Honduras against the Spaniards. Through surprise attacks and their overwhelming numbers, they were able to drive the Spanish out of San Miguel and destroy the garrison.</paragraph><paragraph>For ten years the Lencas prevented the Spanish from building a permanent settlement. Then the Spanish returned with more soldiers, including about 2,000 forced conscripts from indigenous communities in Guatemala.

He resigned six months prior to running for re-election, winning back the presidency as the only candidate on the ballot. He ruled from 1935 to 1939, then from 1939 to 1943.

Originally led by<space/><link><target>Farabundo Mart</target></link><space/>and Abel Cuenca, and university students Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata, these leaders were captured before the planned insurrection. Only Cuenca survived; the other insurgents were killed by the government.

Their goal was to help poor and underprivileged Salvadorans through the use of<space/><link><target>Marxist-Leninist</target></link><space/>ideology (strongly rejecting<space/><link><target>Stalinism</target></link>). In December 1930, at the height of the country's economic and social depression, Mart was once again exiled due to his popularity among the nation's poor and rumors of his upcoming nomination for President the following year. Once Arturo Araujo was elected president in 1931, Mart returned to El Salvador, and along with Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata began the movement that was later truncated by the military.</paragraph><paragraph>They helped start a guerrilla revolt of indigenous farmers. The government responded by killing over 30,000 people at what was to have been a &quot;peaceful meeting&quot; in 1932; this became known as La Matanza (The Slaughter). The peasant uprising against Martnez was crushed by the Salvadoran military ten days after it had begun. The Communist-led rebellion, fomented by collapsing coffee prices, enjoyed some initial success, but was soon drowned in a bloodbath.
