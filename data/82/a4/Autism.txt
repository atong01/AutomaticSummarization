<!-- Definition and symptoms -->
'''Autism''' is a [[neurodevelopmental disorder]] characterized by impaired [[Interpersonal relationship|social interaction]], [[language acquisition|verbal]] and [[non-verbal communication]], and restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life.<ref name=CCD/> These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their [[developmental milestones]] at a normal pace and then [[Regressive autism|regress]].<ref name=Stefanatos/> The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|diagnostic criteria]] require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically before age three.<ref name=DSM5>{{vcite book | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition | chapter = Autism Spectrum Disorder, 299.00 (F84.0) | editor = American Psychiatric Association | year = 2013 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing | pagex = 50–59}}</ref>

<!-- Causes and diagnosis -->
While autism is highly heritable, researchers suspect both environmental and genetic factors as causes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chaste P, Leboyer M |title=Autism risk factors: genes, environment, and gene-environment interactions |journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience |volume=14  |pages=281–92 |year=2012 |pmid=23226953 |pmc=3513682 }}</ref> In rare cases, autism is strongly associated with [[Teratology|agents that cause birth defects]].<ref name=Arndt/> [[Controversies in autism|Controversies]] surround other proposed environmental [[Causes of autism|causes]];<ref name=Rutter/> for example, the [[MMR vaccine controversy|vaccine hypotheses]] have been disproven. Autism affects information processing in the [[Human brain|brain]] by altering how [[nerve cell]]s and their [[synapse]]s connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood.<ref name="Levy" /> It is one of three recognized disorders in the [[autism spectrum]] (ASDs), the other two being [[Asperger syndrome]], which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and [[PDD-NOS|pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified]] (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome are not met.<ref name="Johnson" />

<!-- Treatment -->
Early speech or [[Early intensive behavioral intervention|behavioral interventions]] can help children with autism gain self-care, social, and communication skills.<ref name=CCD/> Although there is no known cure,<ref name=CCD/> there have been reported cases of children who recovered.<ref name=Helt/> Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful.<ref name="Howlin">{{cite journal | vauthors = Howlin P, Goode S, Hutton J, Rutter M | title = Adult outcome for children with autism | journal = J Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 45 | issue = 2 | pages = 212–29 | year = 2004 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00215.x | pmid = 14982237}}</ref> An [[Sociological and cultural aspects of autism|autistic culture]] has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be [[Autism rights movement|accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder]].<ref name=Silverman/>

==Characteristics==
Autism is a highly variable [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]<ref name=Geschwind/> that first appears during infancy or childhood, and generally follows a steady course without [[Remission (medicine)|remission]].<ref name=ICD-10-F84.0/> People with autism may be severely impaired in some respects but normal, or even superior, in others.<ref>{{vcite book|title = Biopsychology|author= Pinel JPG|publisher = Pearson|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-205-03099-6|location = Boston, Massachusetts|page = 235}}</ref> Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months, become established by age two or three years,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rogers SJ | title = What are infant siblings teaching us about autism in infancy? | journal = Autism Res | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 125–37 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19582867 | pmc = 2791538 | doi = 10.1002/aur.81  }}</ref> and tend to continue through adulthood, although often in more muted form.<ref name=Rapin/> It is distinguished not by a single symptom, but by a characteristic triad of symptoms: impairments in social interaction; impairments in communication; and restricted interests and repetitive behavior. Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis.<ref name=Filipek/> Autism's individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits.<ref name=London/>

===Social development===
Social deficits distinguish autism and the related [[autism spectrum disorder]]s (ASD; see [[#Classification|Classification]]) from other developmental disorders.<ref name=Rapin/> People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. Noted autistic [[Temple Grandin]] described her inability to understand the [[social communication]] of [[neurotypical]]s, or people with normal [[neural development]], as leaving her feeling "like an anthropologist on Mars".<ref>{{vcite book |title=[[An Anthropologist on Mars]]: Seven Paradoxical Tales |author=[[Oliver Sacks|Sacks O]] |publisher=Knopf |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-679-43785-7 }}</ref>

Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood.<!-- ref name=Volkmar/ --> Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from [[social norms]]; for example, they have less [[eye contact]] and [[turn-taking]], and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things.<ref name=Volkmar/> Three- to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form [[Attachment (psychology)|attachments]] to their primary caregivers.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sigman M, Dijamco A, Gratier M, Rozga A | title = Early detection of core deficits in autism | journal = Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 221–33 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15666338 | doi = 10.1002/mrdd.20046 }}</ref> Most childen with autism display moderately less [[Attachment in children#Secure attachment|attachment security]] than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rutgers AH, Bakermans-Kranenburg MJ, van Ijzendoorn MH, van Berckelaer-Onnes IA | title = Autism and attachment: a meta-analytic review | journal = J Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 45 | issue = 6 | pages = 1123–34 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15257669 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.t01-1-00305.x }}</ref> Older children and adults with ASD [[Face perception#Face perception in individuals with autism|perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition]]<ref name="Sigman">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sigman M, Spence SJ, Wang AT | title = Autism from developmental and neuropsychological perspectives | journal = Annu Rev Clin Psychol | volume = 2 | pages = 327–55 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17716073 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.2.022305.095210 }}</ref> although this may be partly due to a lower ability to defines a person's own emotions.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Mixed emotions: the contribution of alexithymia to the emotional symptoms of autism|url = http://www.nature.com/tp/journal/v3/n7/full/tp201361a.html|journal = Translational Psychiatry|date = 2013-07-23|pmc = 3731793|pmid = 23880881|pages = e285|volume = 3|issue = 7|doi = 10.1038/tp.2013.61|language = en|first = G.|last = Bird|first2 = R.|last2 = Cook}}</ref>

Children with high-functioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may affect the quality of life more deeply.<ref name=Burgess/>

There are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD. The limited data suggest that, in children with intellectual disability, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and [[tantrum]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Matson JL, Nebel-Schwalm M | title = Assessing challenging behaviors in children with autism spectrum disorders: A review | journal = Research in Developmental Disabilities | volume = 28 | issue = 6 | pages = 567–79 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 16973329 | doi = 10.1016/j.ridd.2006.08.001 }}</ref>

===Communication===
About a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Noens I, van Berckelaer-Onnes I, Verpoorten R, van Duijn G | title = The ComFor: an instrument for the indication of augmentative communication in people with autism and intellectual disability | journal = J Intellect Disabil Res | volume = 50 | issue = 9 | pages = 621–32 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16901289 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2788.2006.00807.x }}</ref> Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life, and may include delayed onset of [[babbling]], unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences, and are more likely to simply repeat others' words ([[echolalia]])<ref name=Landa/><ref name=Tager-Flusberg/> or [[Pronoun reversal|reverse pronouns]].<ref name=Kanner1943/> [[Joint attention]] seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD:<ref name="Johnson">{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnson CP, Myers SM | title = Identification and evaluation of children with autism spectrum disorders | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 120 | issue = 5 | pages = 1183–215 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17967920 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2007-2361 | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/120/5/1183 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090208013449/http://pediatrics.aappublications.org:80/cgi/content/full/120/5/1183 | archivedate = 8 February 2009 }}</ref> for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object,<ref name=Volkmar/><ref name=Tager-Flusberg/> and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience.<ref name=Johnson/> Children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.<ref name="Landa">{{cite journal | vauthors = Landa R | title = Early communication development and intervention for children with autism | journal = Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 16–25 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17326115 | doi = 10.1002/mrdd.20134 }}</ref><ref name="Tager-Flusberg">{{cite journal | vauthors = Tager-Flusberg H, Caronna E | title = Language disorders: autism and other pervasive developmental disorders | journal = Pediatr Clin North Am | volume = 54 | issue = 3 | pages = 469–81 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17543905 | doi = 10.1016/j.pcl.2007.02.011 }}</ref>

In a pair of studies, high-functioning children with autism aged 8–15 performed equally well as, and adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.<ref name=Williams/>

===Repetitive behavior===
Autistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R)<ref name=Lam-Aman/> categorizes as follows.

[[File:Autistic-sweetiepie-boy-with-ducksinarow.jpg|thumb|alt=Young boy asleep on a bed, facing the camera, with only the head visible and the body off-camera. On the bed behind the boy's head is a dozen or so toys carefully arranged in a line.|A young boy with autism who has arranged his toys in a row]]
* '''[[Stereotypy]]''' is repetitive movement, such as hand flapping, head rolling, or body rocking.
* '''[[Compulsive behavior]]''' is intended and appears to follow rules, such as arranging objects in stacks or lines.
* '''Sameness''' is resistance to change; for example, insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted.
* '''[[Ritual#Psychology|Ritualistic behavior]]''' involves an unvarying pattern of daily activities, such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual. This is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors.<ref name="Lam-Aman">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lam KS, Aman MG | title = The Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised: independent validation in individuals with autism spectrum disorders | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 37 | issue = 5 | pages = 855–66 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17048092 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-006-0213-z }}</ref>
* '''Restricted behavior''' is limited in focus, interest, or activity, such as preoccupation with a single television program, toy or game.
* '''[[Self-injury]]''' includes movements that injure or can injure the person, such as eye-poking, [[Dermatillomania|skin-picking]], hand-biting and head-banging.<ref name=Johnson/>
No single repetitive or self-injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism, but only autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bodfish JW, Symons FJ, Parker DE, Lewis MH | title = Varieties of repetitive behavior in autism: comparisons to mental retardation | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 237–43 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11055459 | doi = 10.1023/A:1005596502855 }}</ref>

===Neuropsychology===
Two major categories of [[cognitive]] theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior.

The first category focuses on deficits in [[social cognition]]. [[Simon Baron-Cohen]]'s [[empathizing–systemizing theory]] postulates that autistic individuals can systemize—that is, they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain—but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents. An extension, the extreme male brain theory, hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain, defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing.<ref name=E-S-theory/>  These theories are somewhat related to Baron-Cohen's earlier [[theory of mind]] approach, which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others. The theory of mind hypothesis is supported by the atypical responses of children with autism to the [[Sally–Anne test]] for reasoning about others' motivations,<ref name="E-S-theory">{{cite journal | vauthors = Baron-Cohen S | title = Autism: the empathizing–systemizing (E-S) theory | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1156 | pages = 68–80 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19338503 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04467.x | url = http://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/papers/2009_BC_nyas.pdf | format = PDF | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131214134422/http://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/papers/2009_BC_nyas.pdf | archivedate = 14 December 2013 }}</ref> and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in ''[[#Pathophysiology|Pathophysiology]]'' maps well to the hypothesis.<ref name=Iacoboni/> However, most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals' ability to understand other people's basic intentions or goals; instead, data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others' viewpoints.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hamilton AF | title = Goals, intentions and mental states: challenges for theories of autism | journal = J Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 50 | issue = 8 | pages = 881–92 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19508497 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2009.02098.x }}</ref>

The second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing: the [[executive functions]] such as [[working memory]], planning, [[Inhibition Theory|inhibition]]. In his review, Kenworthy states that "the claim of [[executive dysfunction]] as a causal factor in autism is controversial", however, "it is clear that executive dysfunction plays a role in the social and cognitive deficits observed in individuals with autism".<ref name=Kenworthy/> Tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence, but performance never reaches typical adult levels.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Hearn K, Asato M, Ordaz S, Luna B | title = Neurodevelopment and executive function in autism | journal = Dev Psychopathol | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 1103–32 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18838033 | doi = 10.1017/S0954579408000527 }}</ref> A strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests;<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hill EL | title = Executive dysfunction in autism | journal = Trends Cogn Sci | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 26–32 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14697400 | doi = 10.1016/j.dr.2004.01.001 }}</ref> two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure<ref name="Kenworthy">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kenworthy L, Yerys BE, Anthony LG, Wallace GL | title = Understanding executive control in autism spectrum disorders in the lab and in the real world | journal = Neuropsychol Rev | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 320–38 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18956239 | pmc = 2856078 | doi = 10.1007/s11065-008-9077-7 }}</ref> and that executive function deficits have not been found in young children with autism.<ref name=Sigman/>

[[Weak central coherence theory]] hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism. One strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Happé F, Frith U | title = The weak coherence account: detail-focused cognitive style in autism spectrum disorders | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–25 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16450045 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-005-0039-0 }}</ref> A related theory—enhanced perceptual functioning—focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and [[perceptual]] operations in autistic individuals.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mottron L, Dawson M, Soulières I, Hubert B, Burack J | title = Enhanced perceptual functioning in autism: an update, and eight principles of autistic perception | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–43 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16453071 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-005-0040-7 }}</ref> These theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism.

Neither category is satisfactory on its own; social cognition theories poorly address autism's rigid and repetitive behaviors, while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties.<ref name="HappeTime">{{cite journal | vauthors = Happé F, Ronald A, Plomin R | title = Time to give up on a single explanation for autism | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 9 | issue = 10 | pages = 1218–20 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17001340 | doi = 10.1038/nn1770 }}</ref> A combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Dev Rev | year = 2007 | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 224–60 | title = Cognitive theories of autism | vauthors = Rajendran G, Mitchell P | doi = 10.1016/j.dr.2007.02.001 }}</ref>

A [[pediatrician]] commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child.

ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months, although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life: for example, a one-year-old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later.<ref name="Landa3">{{cite journal | vauthors = Landa RJ | title = Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders in the first 3 years of life | journal = Nat Clin Pract Neurol | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 138–47 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18253102 | doi = 10.1038/ncpneuro0731 }}</ref> In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment, though few cases are handled that quickly in practice.<ref name="Dover">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dover CJ, Le Couteur A | title = How to diagnose autism | journal = Arch Dis Child | volume = 92 | issue = 6 | pages = 540–5 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17515625 | doi = 10.1136/adc.2005.086280 }}</ref> Although the symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood, they are sometimes missed; years later, adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves, to help their employers make adjustments, or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits.

Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases, and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices. The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD, resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms.

===Classification===
Autism is one of the five [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s (PDD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior.<ref name=ICD-10-F84.0/> These symptoms do not imply sickness, fragility, or emotional disturbance.<ref name=Rapin/>

==Screening==

Delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long-term outcome".<ref name=Filipek/>
* No [[babbling]] by 12 months.
* No [[Gesture|gesturing]] (pointing, waving, etc.) by 12 months.
* No single words by 16 months.
* No two-word (spontaneous, not just [[echolalia|echolalic]]) phrases by 24 months.
* Any loss of any language or social skills, at any age.
US and Japanese practice is to [[Screening (medicine)|screen]] all children for ASD at 18 and 24 months, using autism-specific formal screening tests.

He derived it from the Greek word ''autós'' (αὐτός, meaning "self"), and used it to mean morbid self-admiration, referring to "autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance".<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuhn R | title = Eugen Bleuler's concepts of psychopathology | journal = Hist Psychiatry | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 361–6 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15386868 | doi = 10.1177/0957154X04044603 }} The quote is a translation of Bleuler's 1910 original.</ref>

The word ''autism'' first took its modern sense in 1938 when [[Hans Asperger]] of the [[Vienna General Hospital|Vienna University Hospital]] adopted Bleuler's terminology ''autistic psychopaths'' in a lecture in German about [[child psychology]].<ref>{{cite journal | journal=Wien Klin Wochenschr |year=1938 |volume=51 |pages=1314–7 | title = Das psychisch abnormale Kind |trans_title=The psychically abnormal child | vauthors = Asperger H | author-link1 = Hans Asperger | language=German }}</ref> Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as [[Asperger syndrome]], though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981.<ref name=Wolff/> [[Leo Kanner]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] first used ''autism'' in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label ''early infantile autism'' in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities.<ref name="Kanner1943">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kanner L | author-link1 = Leo Kanner |title=Autistic disturbances of affective contact |journal=Nerv Child |volume=2 |pages=217–50 |year=1943 }} Reprinted in {{cite journal | vauthors = Kanner L | title = Autistic disturbances of affective contact | journal = Acta Paedopsychiatr | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 100–36 | year = 1968 | pmid = 4880460 }}</ref> Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner's first paper on the subject, notably "autistic aloneness" and "insistence on sameness", are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.<ref name=HappeTime/> It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger.<ref name="Lyons">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lyons V, Fitzgerald M | title = Asperger (1906–1980) and Kanner (1894–1981), the two pioneers of autism | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 37 | issue = 10 | pages = 2022–3 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17922179 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-007-0383-3 }}</ref>

Kanner's reuse of ''autism'' led to decades of confused terminology like ''infantile schizophrenia'', and child psychiatry's focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant's response to "[[refrigerator mother]]s". Starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome by demonstrating that it is lifelong, distinguishing it from intellectual disability and schizophrenia and from other developmental disorders, and demonstrating the benefits of involving parents in active programs of therapy.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fombonne E | title = Modern views of autism | journal = Can J Psychiatry | volume = 48 | issue = 8 | pages = 503–5 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14574825 | url = http://ww1.cpa-apc.org:8080/Publications/Archives/CJP/2003/september/guesteditorial.asp | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130526200951/http://ww1.cpa-apc.org:8080/publications/archives/cjp/2003/september/guesteditorial.asp | archivedate = 26 May 2013 }}</ref> As late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism; now it is thought to be one of the most heritable of all psychiatric conditions.<ref>{{vcite book |chapter=Genetic epidemiology of autism spectrum disorders |author=[[Peter Szatmari|Szatmari P]], Jones MB |pages=157–78 |title=Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorders |edition=2nd |editor=Volkmar FR |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-521-54957-8 }}</ref> Although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood ASD have deeply affected how we view ASD,<ref name=Wolff/> parents continue to feel [[social stigma]] in situations where their child's autistic behavior is perceived negatively by others,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chambres P, Auxiette C, Vansingle C, Gil S | title = Adult attitudes toward behaviors of a six-year-old boy with autism | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 38 | issue = 7 | pages = 1320–7 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18297387 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-007-0519-5 }}</ref> and many [[primary care physician]]s and [[medical specialist]]s still express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Heidgerken AD, Geffken G, Modi A, Frakey L | title = A survey of autism knowledge in a health care setting | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 323–30 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16119473 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-005-3298-x }}</ref>
