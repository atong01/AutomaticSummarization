A number of small patrol boats have been acquired or ordered from France. Latest estimates indicate naval strength consists of two combat patrol vessels, three coastal patrol vessels and approximately 30 smaller inshore and river patrol craft allocated to both the navy and the local gendarmerie. These include two 135 tonne Yunnan-class landing craft, which are able to carry and launch smaller craft for troop insertions. Some effort has been made to assess equipment needs to bring L'Audacieux P103 and Bakassi P104 to an effective combat status. This has resulted in weapons capabilities being reduced in favour of an increase in serviceability and the service is now effectively without missile attack capabilities. Bakassi (a Type P 48S missile patrol craft) completed a major refit at Lorient, France in August 1999. This included removing the Exocet missile system and EW equipment, and fitting a funnel aft of the mainmast to replace the waterline exhausts. New radars were also installed. Bakassi is now armed only with 40&amp;nbsp;mm cannon. Although the Bizerte (P48 large patrol craft) class L'Audacieux is fitted for SS-12M missiles these are not embarked and its operational status is in some doubt, having not been reported at sea since 1995. The Quartier-Matre Alfred Moto patrol boat was listed as out of service in 1991 but has since been reactivated.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Ships</heading><paragraph><extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=29454&amp;amp;catid=74&amp;amp;Itemid=30'>Cameroon | defenceWeb</link></extension></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>2: FRA P-48 (Gun)</listitem><listitem>6: Rodman 101/46 (Gun)</listitem><listitem>1: Quartier class (Gun)</listitem><listitem>3:<space/><link><target>Boston Whaler</target></link><space/>patrol boats</listitem><listitem>1: Bakassi class patrol boat (P48S type)</listitem><listitem>1: LAudacieux class missile FAC (P48 type)</listitem><listitem>1: Alfred Motto class patrol craft</listitem><listitem>20:<space/><link><target>Swiftships</target></link><space/>type river boats</listitem><listitem>2:<space/><link><target>Type 067 landing craft utility</target><part>Yunnan landing craft utility</part></link></listitem><listitem>8: Simoneau</listitem><listitem>2: Aresa 2400 CPV Defender patrol boats<space/><extension extension_name='ref' name="defenceweb1"><link type='external' href='http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=33027&amp;amp;Itemid=106'>Cameroon Navy receives new patrol vessels, landing craft | defenceWeb</link></extension></listitem><listitem>1: Aresa 2300 landing craft</listitem><listitem>6: Aresa 750 Commandos RIBs</listitem><listitem>5: 1200 Stealth RIBs</listitem><listitem>1: 1200 Defcon RIB</listitem><listitem>2: P108 and P109 patrol boats</listitem></list><paragraph>Two 32 metre patrol boats are expected to be delivered in February 2014.<extension extension_name='ref' name="defenceweb1"></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>commons category</target><arg>Military of Cameroon</arg></template><template><target>reflist</target></template></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><link type='external' href='http://www.crtv.cm/cont/nouvelles/nouvelles_sola_fr.php?idField=9048&amp;amp;table=nouvelles&amp;amp;sub=national'></link><template><target>dead link</target><arg name="date">March 2015</arg></template><space/>- military appointments</listitem></list><paragraph><template><target>Military of Africa</target></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>DEFAULTSORT:Military Of Cameroon</target></template><link><target>Category:Military of Cameroon</target><part></part></link></paragraph></article>
