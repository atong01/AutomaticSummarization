The work marked a great shift in style for the composer due to the substantial influence of<space/><link><target>Gustav Mahler</target></link><space/>and a number of Western-style elements. The symphony gave Shostakovich compositional trouble, as he attempted to reform his style into a new idiom. The composer was well into the work when the fatal articles appeared. Despite this, Shostakovich continued to compose the symphony and planned a premiere at the end of 1936. Rehearsals began that December, but after a number of rehearsals Shostakovich, for reasons still debated today, decided to withdraw the symphony from the public. A number of his friends and colleagues, such as Isaak Glikman, have suggested that it was in fact an official ban which Shostakovich was persuaded to present as a voluntary withdrawal.<extension extension_name='ref'>Wilson (2006): pp. 143-44</extension><space/>Whatever the case, it seems possible that this action saved the composer's life: during this time Shostakovich feared for himself and his family. Yet Shostakovich did not repudiate the work; it retained its designation as his Fourth Symphony. A piano reduction was published in 1946, and the work was finally premiered in 1961, well after Stalin's death.</paragraph><paragraph>During 1936 and 1937, in order to maintain as low a profile as possible between the Fourth and Fifth symphonies, Shostakovich mainly composed<space/><link><target>film music</target></link>, a genre favored by Stalin and lacking in dangerous personal expression.<extension extension_name='ref'>Volkov.<space/><italics>Testimony</italics>.

Therefore, the public, and most importantly the authorities, wanted another triumphant piece from the composer. Instead, they got the Eighth Symphony, perhaps the ultimate in sombre and violent expression within Shostakovich's output. In order to preserve the image of Shostakovich (a vital bridge to the people of the Union and to the West), the government assigned the name &quot;Stalingrad&quot; to the symphony, giving it the appearance of a mourning of the dead in the bloody<space/><link><target>Battle of Stalingrad</target></link>. However, the symphony did not escape criticism. Shostakovich is reported to have said: &quot;When the Eighth was performed, it was openly declared counter-revolutionary and anti-Soviet.
