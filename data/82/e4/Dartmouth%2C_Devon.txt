'''Dartmouth''' is a town and [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in the [[England|English]] county of [[Devon]]. It is a [[tourist destination]] set on the western bank of the estuary of the [[River Dart]], which is a long narrow tidal [[ria]] that runs inland as far as [[Totnes]]. It lies within the [[South Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] and [[South Hams|South Hams District]], and had a population of 5,512 in 2001,<ref>[http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/viewFullDataset.do?instanceSelection=03070&productId=779&$ph=60_61&datasetInstanceId=3070&startColumn=1&numberOfColumns=8&containerAreaId=790363 Office for National Statistics : ''Census 2001 : Parish Headcounts : South Hams''] Retrieved 27 January 2010</ref> reducing to 5,064 at the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/php/uk-england-southwestengland.php?cityid=E35000831|title=Parish population 2011|accessdate= 19 February 2015}}</ref> There are two [[electoral wards]] in the ''Dartmouth'' area (Townstal & Kingswear).

==History==
Dartmouth was of strategic importance as a deep-water port for sailing vessels. The port was used as the sailing point for the [[Crusades]] of 1147 and 1190, and [[Warfleet Creek]], close to [[Dartmouth Castle]] is supposed by some to be named for the vast fleets which assembled there.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Dartmouth was a home of the [[Royal Navy]] from the reign of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] and was twice surprised and sacked during the [[Hundred Years' War]], after which the mouth of the estuary was closed every night with a great chain. The narrow mouth of the Dart is protected by two fortified castles, [[Dartmouth Castle]] and [[Kingswear Castle]]. Originally Dartmouth's only wharf was Bayard's Cove, a relatively small area protected by a fort at the southern end of the town.

In 1373 [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] visited and among the pilgrims in his [[Canterbury Tales]]
:''A schipman was ther, wonyng fer by weste;''
:''For ought I wost, he was of Dertemouthe.''

Notwithstanding Dartmouth's connections with the crown and respectable society, it was a major base for [[privateer]]ing in [[medieval]] times. [[John Hawley (died 1408)|John Hawley]] or Hauley,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.devonperspectives.co.uk/johnhawley.html |title=John Hawley of Dartmouth |publisher=Devonperspectives.co.uk |date=11 February 2012 |accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref> a licensed privateer and sometime mayor of Dartmouth <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dartmouth-history.org.uk/content_images/upload/Town_Mayors.htm |title=Roll Of Mayoralty |publisher=Dartmouth-history.org.uk |date= |accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref> is reputed to be a model for Chaucer's "schipman".

The earliest street in Dartmouth to be recorded by name (in the 13th century) is Smith Street. Several of the houses on the street are originally late 16th century or early 17th century and probably rebuilt on the site of earlier medieval dwellings. The street name undoubtedly derives from the smiths and shipwrights who built and repaired ships here when the tidal waters reached as far as this point. Smith Street was also the site of the town [[pillory]] in medieval times.

[[File:stsavioursdoor.jpg|thumb|right|Medieval church door of St Saviour's]]

St Saviour's Church was constructed in 1335 and consecrated in 1372. It contains a pre-Reformation oak [[rood screen]] built in 1480 and several monuments including the tomb of John Hawley (d. 1408) and his two wives, covered with a large brass plate effigy of all three. A large medieval ironwork door is decorated with two leopards of the [[Plantagenet]]s and is possibly the original portal. Although it is dated "1631", this is thought to be the date of a subsequent refurbishment coincidental with major renovations of the church in the 17th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roughwood.net/ChurchAlbum/Devon/Dartmouth/Dartmouth-St-Saviour.htm |title=St Saviour, Dartmouth, Devon - Church |publisher=Roughwood.net |date=27 February 2009 |accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref> The gallery of the church is decorated with the heraldic crests of prominent local families and is reputed to be constructed of timbers from ships captured during the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]],{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} although this has not been categorically substantiated.

In 1592 the ''[[Madre de Deus]]'', a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] treasure ship [[Battle of Flores (1592)|captured by the English]] in the [[Azores]], docked at [[Dartmouth Harbour]]. It attracted all manner of traders, dealers, cutpurses and thieves and by the time Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] arrived to reclaim the Crown's share of the loot, a cargo estimated at half a million [[Pound sterling|pounds]] had been reduced to £140,000.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Still, ten freighters were needed to carry the treasure to London.

[[Henry Hudson]] put in to Dartmouth on his return from North America, and was arrested for sailing under a [[flag state|foreign flag]]. The [[Pilgrim Fathers]] put in to Dartmouth's Bayard's Cove, en route from [[Southampton]] to America. They rested a while before setting off on their journey in the ''[[Mayflower]]'' and the ''[[Speedwell (ship)|Speedwell]]'' on 20 August 1620. About 300 miles west of [[Land's End]], upon realising that the ''Speedwell'' was unseaworthy, it returned to [[Plymouth]]. The ''Mayflower'' departed alone to complete the crossing to [[Cape Cod]]. Dartmouth's sister city is [[Dartmouth, Massachusetts]].

[[File:Butterwalk hdr.jpg|thumb|left|The Butterwalk]]

The town contains many medieval and [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] streetscapes and is a patchwork of narrow lanes and stone stairways. A significant number of the historic buildings are listed.<ref>{{cite web|author=Good Stuff IT Services |url=http://britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/england/devon/dartmouth |title=Listed Buildings in Dartmouth, Devon, England |publisher=British Listed Buildings |date= |accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref> One of the most obvious is the Butterwalk, built 1635 to 1640. Its intricately carved wooden fascia is supported on granite columns. [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] held court in the Butterwalk whilst sheltering from storms in 1671 in a room which now forms part of [[Dartmouth Museum]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The King's Room at Dartmouth Museum|url=http://dartmouthmuseum.org/collections/kings-room/index.html|publisher=Dartmouth Museum|accessdate=29 July 2011|quote=It was in this magnificent room that King Charles II was entertained in July 1671, when storms forced him to seek shelter in Dartmouth.}}</ref> Much of the interior survives from that time.

The Royal Castle Hotel was built in 1639 on the then new quay. The building was re-fronted in the 19th century, and as the new frontage is itself listed, it is not possible to see the original which lies beneath. A claimant for the oldest building is a former merchant's house in Higher Street, now a [[Good Beer Guide]] listed public house called ''the Cherub'', built circa 1380. Agincourt House (next to the Lower Ferry) is also 14th century.

Dartmouth sent numerous ships to join the English fleet that attacked the [[Spanish Armada]], including the Roebuck, Crescent and Hart.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.dartmouth-history.org.uk/content_images/upload/Russells_Dartmouth.pdf |title=Ancient Dartmouth |last=Russell |first=Percy |publisher= |date=September 1946 |accessdate=2 February 2013}}</ref> The Nuestra Señora del Rosario, the Spanish Armada's "payship" commanded by Admiral Pedro de Valdés, was captured along with all its crew by [[Sir Francis Drake]]. It was reportedly anchored in the River Dart for more than a year and the crew were used as labourers on the nearby [[Greenway Estate]] which was the home of [[Sir Humphrey Gilbert]] and his half-brother [[Sir Walter Raleigh]]. Greenway was later the home of [[Dame Agatha Christie]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-uk.com/DestinationsUK/Dartmouth.htm |title=Dartmouth, Devon - Destinations UK |publisher=Historic-uk.com |date=4 June 1944 |accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref>

The remains of a fort at Gallants Bower just outside the town are some of the best preserved remains of a [[English Civil War|Civil War]] defensive structure.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} The fort was built by [[Royalist]] occupation forces in c. 1643 to the south east of the town, with a similar fort at Mount Ridley on the opposite slopes of what is now [[Kingswear]]. The [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] [[General Fairfax]] attacked from the north in 1646, taking the town and forcing the [[Cavalier|Royalists]] to surrender, after which Gallants Bower was demolished.

===19th century===
The made-up embankment which today extends the whole length of the town's riverbank is the result of 19th century land reclamation, started in earnest when the town played host to a large number of [[prisoners of war]] from the [[Napoleonic Wars]] which formed a captive workforce. Before this, what is now the town centre was almost entirely tidal mud flats.

The [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution]] opened the [[Dart Lifeboat Station]] at the Sand Quay in 1878, but it was closed in 1896. In all this time only one effective rescue was made by the [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]].<ref name=Lifeboats>{{cite book |last= Leach |first= Nicholas |title= Devon's Lifeboat Heritage |year= 2009 |publisher= Twelveheads Press |location= Chacewater |isbn= 978-0-906294-72-7 |pages= 19–20 }}</ref>

===20th century===
[[File:smithstreet.jpg|thumb|right|Smith Street circa 1930]]
In the latter part of [[World War II]] the town was a base for American forces and one of the departure points for [[Utah Beach]] in the [[Normandy Landings|D Day landings]]. Slipways and harbour improvements were also constructed. Much of the surrounding countryside and notably Slapton Sands was closed to the public while it was used by US troops for practise landings and manoeuvres. 

===21st century===
[[Dart Lifeboat Station]] was reopened in 2007, the first time that a lifeboat had been stationed in the town since 1896. It has initially been kept in a temporary building in Coronation Park.<ref name=Lifeboats/>

In 2010, a fire seriously damaged numerous historical properties in Fairfax Place and Higher Street. Several were Tudor and Grade I or Grade II [[listed building]]s.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/england/devon/10189310.stm | publisher= BBC News | title= Dartmouth's Tudor buildings destroyed by chip shop fire | date= 29 May 2010 | accessdate=30 May 2010}}</ref>

==Governance==
The town was an ancient [[borough]], incorporated by [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], known formally as '''Clifton-Dartmouth-Hardness''', and consisting of the three parishes of ''St Petrox'', ''St Saviour'' and ''Townstall'', and incorporating the hamlets of Ford, Old Mill and Norton.<ref>[http://genuki.cs.ncl.ac.uk/DEV/Dartmouth/Dartmouth1830.html ''Pigot & Co.'s Devonshire'' (1830)] GenUKi</ref> It was reformed under the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]]. The town returned two members of parliament from the 13th century until 1835, after which one [[Member of Parliament|MP]] was elected until the town was disenfranchised in 1868. It remained a [[municipal borough]] until 1974, when it was merged into the [[South Hams]] district, and became a [[successor parish]] of Dartmouth with a town council.<ref>''The English Non-metropolitan Districts (Definition) Order 1972'' (S.I. 1972 No. 2039)</ref><ref>''The Local Government (Successor Parishes) Order 1973'' (S.I. 1973 No. 1110)</ref>

Dartmouth Town Council is the lowest of three tiers of local government. It consists of 16 councillors representing the two [[ward (politics)|wards]] of Clifton and Townstall.<ref>[http://www.visionwebsites.co.uk/Contents/Text/Index.asp?SiteId=304&SiteExtra=7188892&TopNavId=662&NavSideId=5318 ''Dartmouth Town Councillors'', Dartmouth Town Council.

==Culture and tourism==
[[File:Dartmouth map.png|thumb|right|Map of Dartmouth]]
The [[Port of Dartmouth Royal Regatta]] takes place annually over three days at the end of August. The event sees the traditional regatta boat races along with markets, fun fairs, community games, air displays including the [[Red Arrows]] and fireworks. A [[Royal Navy]] guard ship is present at the event.

Bayard's Cove has been used in several television productions, including ''[[The Onedin Line]]''<ref name="onedin">{{cite web|url=http://dartmouthmuseum.org/things-to-do/#bayardscove|title=Things to Do - Indoor - Outdoor - Dartmouth Museum|publisher=[[Dartmouth Museum]]|accessdate=19 August 2011|quote=Bayards Cove was used in the BBC period drama The Onedin Line to represent the wharves and buildings of Liverpool Docks.}}</ref> a popular [[BBC television]] drama series that ran from 1971 to 1980.

Notable [[tourist attraction]]s include the [[Dartmouth Royal Naval College]], [[Dartmouth Castle]] and the [[Dartmouth Steam Railway]] which terminates at [[Kingswear]] on the opposite bank of the river.

Boat cruises to nearby places along the coast (such as [[Torbay]] and [[Salcombe]]) and up the river (to [[Totnes]], [[Dittisham]] and the [[Greenway Estate]]) are provided by several companies. The paddlesteamer [[PS Kingswear Castle]] returned to the town in 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thisissouthdevon.co.uk/Paddlesteamer-Kingswear-Castle-returns-home-Dart/story-17531723-detail/story.html|title=Paddlesteamer Kingswear Castle returns home to the Dart after 50 years|date=8 December 2012|work=[[Western Morning News]]|accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref>

==Climate==
The nearest Met Office weather station is [[Slapton, Devon|Slapton]], about 5 miles south-south west of Dartmouth and a similar distance from the coast. As with the rest of the [[British Isles]] and [[South West England]], the area experiences a [[maritime climate]] with warm summers and mild winters - this is particularly pronounced due to its position near the coast - extremes range from a record low of just {{convert|-8.0|C|F}} in January 1987<ref>{{cite web | publisher = [[KNMI (institute)|KNMI]] | url= http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/monitordetail.php?seasonid=7&year=1987&indexid=TNn&stationid=1815 | title = 1987 temperature}}</ref>  up to a record high of {{convert|30.5|C|F}} during June 1976.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = [[KNMI (institute)|KNMI]] | url= http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/monitordetail.php?seasonid=12&year=1976&indexid=TXx&stationid=1815 | title = 1976 temperature}}</ref>

==Transport==
Dartmouth is linked to [[Kingswear]], on the other side of the River Dart, by three ferries. The [[Dartmouth Higher Ferry|Higher Ferry]] and the [[Dartmouth Lower Ferry|Lower Ferry]] are both vehicular ferries. The [[Dartmouth Passenger Ferry|Passenger Ferry]], as its name suggests, carries only passengers, principally to connect with the [[Paignton and Dartmouth Steam Railway]] at [[Kingswear railway station|Kingswear station]]. The nearest bridge across the Dart is in [[Totnes]], some {{convert|11|mi}} away by road.<ref name=dhrgf>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartharbour.org/harbour-river-guide/ferries/ | title = Dart Harbour : Ferries | publisher = The Dart Harbour and Navigation Authority | accessdate =18 September 2008 }}</ref>
[[File:Dartmouth station building.jpg|750pix.jpg|thumb|left|Dartmouth station building, now a restaurant.]]
The [[A379 road]] runs through Dartmouth, linking the town to [[Slapton, Devon|Slapton]] and [[Kingsbridge]] to the southwest and to [[Torbay]] to the east across the Higher Ferry. The [[A3122 road|A3122]] connects Dartmouth to a junction with the [[A381 road|A381]], and hence to both Totnes and a more direct route to Kingsbridge.
[[First South West]] provides local town bus services and links to, [[Plymouth]], Kingsbridge. As well as [[Stagecoach Gold]] provides a luxury bus service to [[Torquay]] via Totnes and [[Paignton]]. In addition [[Stagecoach Devon]] provides links to the [[Torbay]] resorts of [[Brixham]], [[Paignton]] and Torquay from [[Kingswear]] via the ferry.

No railway has ever run to Dartmouth, but the town does have a [[railway station]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southdevonaonb.org.uk/text.asp?PageId=200 |title=Heritage, Landscape & Wildlife: Dartmouth Town Trail |publisher=South Devon AONB |date= |accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref> although it is now a restaurant. The railway line to Kingswear was opened in 1864, the original plans for the [[Dartmouth and Torbay Railway]] line took the line across a bridge and into the town. Opposition from local seamen and merchants saw the route diverted to Kingswear on the opposite side of the river, but this occurred after the station had been built at Dartmouth. The railway terminated at a station called "Kingswear for Dartmouth" (now on the Paignton and Dartmouth Steam Railway) and a ferry took passengers across the river to the station at [[Dartmouth railway station]], which had a dedicated pontoon. [[British Railways]] closed the line to mainline passenger trains in 1973, but it re-opened as a heritage line and has run as one ever since.

[[File:dartmouth.boats.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|Kingswear seen from Dartmouth]]

==Education==

===Royal Naval College===
The town is home to the [[Royal Navy]]'s officer training college ([[Britannia Royal Naval College]]), where all officers of the Royal Navy and many foreign naval officers are trained.

===Schools===
Dartmouth has one [[secondary school]] — formerly ([[Dartmouth Community College]]) now Dartmouth Academy — an all-through school for those aged 3–18, and two [[primary school]]s: (Dartmouth Primary school (now part of Dartmouth Academy) and St John the Baptist R.C. Primary School). Dartmouth Community College and Dartmouth Primary School are part of the Dartmouth Learning Campus; as from September 2007, Dartmouth Community College is part of a federation with Dartmouth Primary School and Nursery, meaning that the two schools share one governing body for pupils aged 1 to 19. Dartmouth also has a pre-school in the centre of town, established for over 40 years and based in the old Victorian school rooms at South Ford Road. It provides care for 2- to 5-year-olds and is run as a charitable organisation.

==Sport and leisure==
Dartmouth has a [[Non-League football]] club [[Dartmouth A.F.C.]] who play at Long Cross.

Dartmouth also hosts the annual "World Indoor Rally Championship", based on [[Slot car racing]] in the late summer.<ref>http://www.slotforum.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=56804</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSaiaCDqIvs</ref>

At the end of August and early September there is the annual [[Port of Dartmouth Royal Regatta]].

Since 1905 Dartmouth has had a greenhouse as part of the Royal Avenue Gardens.<ref name="DinBGreenhouse">{{cite web|url=http://dartmouthinbloom.org/greenhouse/history/|title=History of Dartmouth Community Greenhouse|publisher=Dartmouth in Bloom|accessdate=17 May 2013|quote=The Dartmouth Greenhouse was built in 1905.

==Notable residents==
[[Thomas Newcomen]], the inventor of the [[atmospheric engine]] – the first successful steam-powered pumping engine – was born in Dartmouth in 1663. The location of his house in Lower Street is marked with a plaque, although the building itself was demolished (and elements incorporated into local architect Thomas Lidstone's house on Ridge Hill) in the 19th century to make way for a new road which was named after Newcomen. An 18th-century working [[Newcomen steam engine]] is on display in the town.

The town was home to the [[civil engineer]] and [[calculating prodigy]] [[George Parker Bidder]] (1806–1878), who is notable for his work on railways over much of the world, as well as the docks of the [[East End]] in the [[Port of London]]. Bidder served on the town council, and his expertise was instrumental in draining the area which is now the centre of the town. He also undertook pioneering work with [[Samuel Lake]] on steam trawling whilst living in the town. Bidder died at his home at Paradise Point near [[Warfleet Creek]] and is buried at nearby Stoke Fleming.

[[Flora Thompson]] lived in Above Town between 1928 and 1940, writing ''Lark Rise'' and ''Over to Candleford'' during this time. The books were later combined into a single volume with the later ''Candleford Green'' to form the well-known ''Lark Rise to Candleford''. She is buried at Longcross Cemetery.

The stage and film actress [[Rachel Kempson]] (1910–2003) was born in Dartmouth. She was the wife of Sir [[Michael Redgrave]] and mother of [[Vanessa Redgrave|Vanessa]], [[Lynn Redgrave|Lynn]] and [[Corin Redgrave|Corin]], and published her autobiography, ''Life Among the Redgraves'', in 1988.

[[Gordon Onslow Ford]] (1912–2003), a leading British [[surrealist]] painter, attended the Royal Naval College.

[[Sir John Harvey Jones]] (1924-2008), Businessman and television presenter, attended the Royal Naval College.
