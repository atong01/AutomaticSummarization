The small landowners' relative poverty, the lack of a large indigenous labor force, the population's ethnic and linguistic homogeneity, and Costa Rica's isolation from the Spanish colonial centers in Mexico and the Andes all contributed to the development of an autonomous and individualistic agrarian society.

In New Spain, all of the fighting by those seeking independence was done in the center of that area from 1810 to 1821, what today is central Mexico. Once the Viceroy was defeated in the capital city&amp;mdash;today Mexico City&amp;mdash; in 1821, the news of independence was sent to all the territories of New Spain including the Intendencies of the former Captaincy of Guatemala. Accepting this as a fact, Costa Rica joined the other Central American Intendencies in a joint declaration of independence from Spain. The public proclamation was done through the Act of Independence in 1821.</paragraph><paragraph>After the declaration of independence it was the intention of the New Spain parliament to establish a commonwealth whereby the King of Spain, Ferdinand VII, would also be Emperor of New Spain, but in which both countries were to be governed by separate laws and with their own legislative offices. Should the king refuse the position, the law provided for a member of the<space/><link><target>House of Bourbon</target></link><space/>to accede to the New Spain throne? Ferdinand VII did not recognize the independence and said that Spain would not allow any other European prince to take the throne of New Spain.</paragraph><paragraph>By request of Parliament, the president of the regency Agustn de Iturbide was proclaimed emperor of New Spain but the Parliament also decided to rename New Spain to Mexico. The Mexican Empire was the official name given to this monarchical regime from 1821 to 1823. The territory of the Mexican Empire included the continental intendencies and provinces of New Spain proper (including those of the former Captaincy General of Guatemala) (See: History of Central America).</paragraph><heading level='2'>United Provinces of Central America</heading><paragraph>In 1823, a revolution in Mexico ousted Emperor<space/><link><target>Agustn de Iturbide</target></link>, and a new Mexican congress voted to allow the Central American Intendencies to decide their own fate. That year, the United Provinces of Central America was formed of the five Central American Intendencies under General Manuel Jos Arce. The Intendencies took the new name of States. The United Provinces federation, not strongly united to begin with, rapidly disintergrated under the pressures of intraprovincial rivalries.</paragraph><paragraph>Following full independence in 1838, Costa Ricans found themselves with no regular trade routes to get their<space/><link><target>coffee</target></link><space/>to European markets. This was compounded by transportation problems &amp;ndash; the coffee-growing areas were mainly on the Central Valley and only had access to the port in<space/><link><target>Puntarenas</target></link><space/>on the Pacific Coast, and before the<space/><link><target>Panama Canal</target></link><space/>was opened, ships from Europe had to sail around<space/><link><target>Cape Horn</target></link><space/>in order to get to the Pacific Coast.
