Modern boomerangs used for sport are often made from thin aircraft plywood, plastics such as<space/><link><target>Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene</target><part>ABS</part></link>,<space/><link><target>polypropylene</target></link>,<space/><link><target>phenolic paper</target></link>, or even high-tech materials such as<space/><link><target>Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer</target><part>carbon fibre-reinforced plastics</part></link>. Boomerangs come in many shapes and sizes depending on their geographic or tribal origins and intended function. Many people think of a boomerang as the Australian type, although today there are many types of easier to use boomerangs, such as the cross-stick; the pinwheel; the tumblestick; the boomabird; and many other less common types.</paragraph><paragraph>An important distinction should be made between returning boomerangs and non-returning boomerangs. Returning boomerangs fly and are examples of the earliest heavier-than-air man-made flight. A returning boomerang has two or more<space/><link><target>airfoil</target></link><space/>wings arranged so that the spinning creates unbalanced<space/><link><target>aerodynamic</target></link><space/>forces that curve its path so that it travels in an<space/><link><target>Ellipse</target><part>elliptical</part></link><space/>path and returns to its point of origin when thrown correctly. While a<space/><link><target>throwing stick</target></link><space/>can also be shaped overall like a returning boomerang, it is designed to travel as straight as possible so that it can be aimed and thrown with great force to bring down game. Its surfaces therefore are symmetrical and not uneven like the aerofoils which give the returning boomerang its characteristic curved flight.</paragraph><paragraph>The most recognisable type of the boomerang is the returning boomerang; while non-returning boomerangs, throwing sticks (or shaunies) were used as weapons, returning boomerangs have been used primarily for leisure or recreation. Returning boomerangs were also used to decoy birds of prey, thrown above long grass to frighten<space/><link><target>game (food)</target><part>game</part></link><space/>birds into flight and into waiting nets.

Though it is not a requirement that the boomerang be in its traditional shape, it is usually flat. A falling boomerang starts spinning, and most then fall in a spiral. When the boomerang is thrown with high spin, a boomerang flies in a curve rather than a straight line. When thrown correctly, a boomerang returns to its starting point.</paragraph><paragraph>Returning boomerangs consist of two or more arms, or wings, connected at an angle. Each wing is shaped as an<space/><link><target>airfoil</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>As the wing rotates and the boomerang moves through the air, this creates airflow over the wings and this creates lift on both &quot;wings&quot;. However, during one-half of each blade's rotation, it sees a higher airspeed, because the rotation tip-speed and the forward speed add, and when it is in the other half of the rotation, the tip speed subtracts from the forward speed. Thus if thrown nearly upright each blade generates more lift at the top than the bottom.<extension extension_name='ref' name="hyper"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/brng.html</arg><arg name="title">Boomerang</arg><arg name="work">gsu.edu</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>While it might be expected that this would cause the boomerang to tilt around the axis of travel, because the boomerang has significant angular momentum, gyroscopic effect causes the plane of rotation to tilt about an axis that is 90 degrees to the direction of flight, and this is what curves the flight in such a way that it will tend to return.<extension extension_name='ref' name="hyper"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Thus<space/><link><target>gyroscopic precession</target></link><space/>is what makes the boomerang return to the thrower when thrown correctly. This is also what makes the boomerang fly straight up into the air when thrown incorrectly. With the exception of long-distance boomerangs, they should not be thrown sidearm or like a<space/><link><target>Flying disc</target><part>Frisbee</part></link>, but rather thrown with the long axis of the wings rotating in an almost-vertical plane.</paragraph><paragraph>Fast Catch boomerangs usually have three or more symmetrical wings (seen from above), whereas a Long Distance boomerang is most often shaped similar to a question mark.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.baggressive.com/copper/thumbnails.php?album</arg><arg name="title">'baggressive.com'<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Baggressive.com<space/></arg><arg name="date">19 April 2005<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">3 March 2010</arg></template></extension><space/>Maximum Time Aloft boomerangs mostly have one wing considerably longer than the other.

Try to get the grain of the outer ply running at 45 degrees to the length of the arms. If there is any warp in the wood, make sure that this produces dihedral on the upper side of the boomerang, i.e., if the airfoil is uppermost and the boomerang is on a flat surface, then the wingtips are raised slightly above the surface. (Any anhedral and the boomerang won't fly.) The pattern is traced on to the boomerang with a pencil. The boomerang shape is cut out of the plywood. This basic cut out is called the blank. An outline is drawn on the top of the blank to show the areas to be shaped for the leading and trailing edges of the wings. The profiles of the wings are shaped. The top of the leading edge of each wing is decreased at a 45 angle, while the rear of the wing is angled down to leave 12&amp;nbsp;mm thick trailing edge. The bottom face of the leading edge is trimmed back slightly. The tips of the wings are shaped down to the same thickness as the trailing edge. The various layers of the plywood serve as an outline that helps the worker achieve equal slopes. A shallow section may also be cut out from the bottom surface of each wing. For example, this might consist of a 5-cm long strip near the wing tip and behind the leading edge. Using progressively finer sandpaper, the surface of the boomerang is smoothed carefully. Check the boomerang for a slight amount of dihedral (23&amp;nbsp;mm) on both wings at this point. If there isn't any, introduce some by heating the boomerang either over a heat source or a brief spell in the microwave oven (about 30 seconds on high) if the boomerang is just about uncomfortably hot to handle, you've got it just about right. Bend up the tips of the wings and place the boomerang on a flat surface with a coin under each tip and a weight (bag of sugar?) on the elbow of the boomerang. Allow it to cool for twenty minutes or more. After spraying the surface with sanding sealer, the surface is smoothed with fine steel wool. The boomerang is then painted again.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Tuning the flight</heading><paragraph><template><target>Unreferenced section</target><arg name="date">August 2015</arg></template>The boomerang is then thrown several times to check if it works. The extreme subtleties of the<space/><link><target>aerodynamic</target></link><space/>forces on the light wooden boomerang make it surprisingly difficult to predict how the finished boomerang will perform. Two apparently identical boomerangs may radically differ in their flight patterns. For example, they may climb uncontrollably, they may fall repeatedly into the ground, they may exhibit long narrow pattern non-returning flight, or display other erratic behaviour. The only sure way to know is to flight test them. There are several methods to correct problems, for example the wing profiles might be adjusted by additional sanding. Plywood boomerangs may be heated for a short time in a<space/><link><target>microwave oven</target></link><space/>which softens the glue between the layers and then can be carefully intentionally warped.<space/><link><target>Angle of attack</target></link><space/>of the leading arm and the dingle arm can be adjusted, as can the overall<space/><link><target>dihedral angle</target></link><space/>of the wings all with some effect. There are many other esoteric tuning techniques as well. Tuning boomerangs is more of a slowly learned art than a science. The quality of the boomerang is also checked throughout this process. A tuned boomerang that flies well should be handled with respect when not in use. It should be stored carefully on a flat surface away from too much humidity, direct sunlight, or heat. These conditions can subtly affect the shape of the boomerang and ruin its flight characteristics, and the boomerang will then need to be re-tuned.</paragraph><paragraph>The hunting boomerang is more delicately balanced and is therefore much harder to make than a returning one. When thrown, this type of boomerang needs to develop no unbalanced aerodynamic forces that would affect its flight path, so that it will fly true to the target. The curving flight of the returning boomerang was probably first noticed as an undesirable quality when early hunters tried to &quot;tune,&quot; their curved throwing sticks to fly arrow straight.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Art renaissance</heading><paragraph><template><target>Unreferenced section</target><arg name="date">August 2015</arg></template>Beginning in the later part of the twentieth century there has been a bloom in the independent creation of unusually designed art boomerangs. These often have little or no resemblance to the traditional historical ones and on first sight some of these objects often do not look like boomerangs at all. The use of modern thin plywoods and synthetic plastics have greatly contributed to their success. As long as there are somewhere in the object several airfoil contoured surfaces, whether wing shaped or not, these boomerangs can be thrown and will return. Designs are amazingly diverse and can range from animal inspired forms, humorous themes, complex calligraphic and symbolic shapes, to the purely abstract. Painted surfaces are similarly richly diverse.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Throwing technique</heading><paragraph><template><target>Multiple issues</target><arg name="section">y</arg><arg name="{{howto|section|date">July 2011}}
{{refimprove section|date</arg></template>A right-handed boomerang is thrown with a counter-clockwise spin causing a counter-clockwise flight (as seen from above). Conversely, a left-handed boomerang is constructed as a mirror image with the aerofoils' leading edges on the left side of the wings, as seen from above, causing it to produce lift when circling clockwise. Although appearing symmetrical from a plan view, the leading edges are on opposite edges of the wings (leading and trailing) so as to present the leading edges of the aerofoil to the wind when spinning.<link><target>File:Boomerang School.JPG</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>A boomerang school, William Street, Kings Cross, Sydney</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>Most sport boomerangs are in the range of about<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>70</arg><arg>to</arg><arg>110</arg><arg>g</arg><arg>oz</arg></template>.

They then turn between thirty to seventy degrees clockwise to the right, depending on wind speed (turning farther for stronger winds). The correct launch orientation makes the boomerang's flight begin by flying into the wind, then having its flight take it through the &quot;eye of the wind&quot; and finally returning downwind using the wind's speed to help complete its flight back to the thrower.</paragraph><paragraph>The thrower stands sideways with feet-apart, left foot forward, so as to point in the direction of flight. Holding the right (or left) wing tip, flat side down, using the thumb on top and one to three fingers below, they tilt the boomerang out at a ten to thirty degree angle from vertical. This angle is called &quot;layover.&quot; Different boomerangs have different flight characteristics, and the bigger the layover the higher the boomerang will fly.</paragraph><paragraph>Cocking the boomerang back to ensure a good spin and stepping sharply forward with the left foot, the thrower follows through with their right arm and leg as they throw the boomerang overhand in a similar way to throwing a spear or pitching a baseball, aiming the boomerang by pointing with their left arm at or just above the horizon. Launching is performed crisply using a whip-like flick with their index finger, at the end of the throw, to cause quick counter-clockwise spin (seen from above). It is the spin that makes the boomerang return. The strength of throw and spin must be varied according to the speed of the wind the stronger the wind, the less power is required to provide lift enough to make the return journey. In other words, the stronger the wind, the softer the boomerang is thrown.</paragraph><paragraph>The boomerang should curve around to the left, climb gently, level out in mid-flight, arc around and descend slowly, and then finish by popping up slightly, hovering, then stalling near the thrower. Ideally, this momentary hovering or stalling will allow the catcher the opportunity to clamp their hands shut horizontally on the boomerang from above and below, sandwiching the centre between their hands. In other words, it is possible to avoid painful wing strikes to the hand by not sticking fingers directly into the edge of the fast-spinning wing rotor.</paragraph><paragraph>Contrary to what beginners think, a boomerang should never be thrown level sidearm like a flying disc, as it will turn abruptly upwards in the direction of the top of its airfoils. It will then climb very high vertically and at its highest point will quickly lose all lift and descend accelerating very fast like a dive bomber so that its landing will be vertical and with great force and probably cause damage, especially to wooden boomerangs which may break into pieces.</paragraph><paragraph>Wind speed and direction are very important for a successful throw. A right-handed boomerang is thrown with the wind on one's left cheek. The angle to the wind depends on the boomerang, but starting with a 45-degree angle is recommended. Depending on where the boomerang lands, this angle can be modified so that a closer return is achieved. For example, if the boomerang lands too far on the left, turn to throw more to the right of the wind the next time. If the return goes over one's head, then throw softer. If it falls short, then throw harder. As for the wind speed, a light wind of three to five miles an hour is ideal. If the wind is strong enough to fly a kite, then that is usually too strong for boomerangs.</paragraph><paragraph>Throwers can modify various actions to achieve a closer return according to the conditions; the throw angle to the wind, the tilt, the power, the spin, and the inclination can be adjusted to vary the return point so the catch point can be perfected. Facing into the wind, then turning the head slightly to either side to check for the cooling effect, allows one to assess the wind direction, and thus the throwing direction, more accurately. For consistency, return to the same throw point and then use a background target object on the horizon to throw in the same direction relative to the wind each time.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Competitions and records</heading><paragraph>In international competition, a<space/><italics>world cup</italics><space/>is held every second year.<space/><template><target>as of</target><arg>2010</arg></template>, teams from Germany and the United States dominated international competition.

For this reason, they have a very narrow throwing window, which discourages many beginners from continuing with this discipline. For the same reason, the quality of manufactured long-distance boomerangs is often non-deterministic.</paragraph><paragraph>Today's long-distance boomerangs have almost all an<space/><italics>S</italics><space/>or<space/><italics>? question mark</italics><space/>shape and have a<space/><link><target>bevel</target><trail>ed</trail></link><space/>edge on both sides (the bevel on the bottom side is sometimes called an undercut). This is to minimise drag and lower the lift. Lift must be low because the boomerang is thrown with an almost total layover (flat). Long-distance boomerangs are most frequently made of composite material, mainly fibre glass<space/><link><target>epoxy</target></link><space/>composites.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Flight path</heading><paragraph>The projection of the flight path of long-distance boomerang on the ground resembles a<space/><link><target>Drop (liquid)</target><part>water drop</part></link>. For older types of long-distance boomerangs (all types of so-called big hooks), the first and last third of the flight path are very low, while the middle third is a fast climbing followed by a fast descent. Nowadays boomerangs are made in a way that their whole flight path is almost planar with a constant climbing during the first half of the trajectory and then a rather constant descent during the second half.</paragraph><paragraph>From theoretical point of view, long-distance boomerangs are interesting also for the following reason: for achieving a different behaviour during different flight phases, the ratio of the rotation frequency to the forward velocity has a U-shaped function, i.e., its<space/><link><target>derivative</target></link><space/>crosses 0. Practically, it means that the boomerang being at the furthest point has a very low forward velocity. The<space/><link><target>kinetic energy</target></link><space/>of the forward component is then stored in the<space/><link><target>potential energy</target></link>. This is not true for other types of boomerangs, where the loss of kinetic energy is non-reversible (the MTAs also store kinetic energy in potential energy during the first half of the flight, but then the potential energy is lost directly by the drag).</paragraph><heading level='2'>Related terms</heading><paragraph>'Kylie' is one of the Aboriginal words for the hunting stick used in warfare and for hunting animals.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url"><space/>http://www.bumerang-sport.de/story/history.htm<space/></arg><arg name="title"><space/>What is a boomerang and where does it come from?<space/></arg></template></extension><space/>Instead of following curved flight paths, kylies fly in straight lines from the throwers.
