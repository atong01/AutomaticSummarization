However, they still include options to shape the sounds through use of<space/><link><target>envelopes</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Low-frequency oscillation</target><part>LFOs</part></link>, filters and effects such as reverb. The Yamaha Motif and Roland Fantom series of keyboards are typical examples of this type, described as 'ROMplers' ; at the same time, they are also examples of &quot;workstation&quot; synthesizers.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Image:Clavia Nord Lead 2x.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>200px</part><part>The Clavia Nord Lead is a popular virtual analog synth</part></link>With the addition of sophisticated sequencers on board, now added to built-in effects and other features, the '<link><target>music workstation</target><part>workstation</part></link>' synthesizer had been born. These always include a multi-track<space/><link><target>Music sequencer</target><part>sequencer</part></link>, and can often record and playback samples, and in later years full audio tracks, to be used to record an entire song. These are usually also ROMplers, playing back samples, to give a wide variety of realistic instrument and other sounds such as drums, string instruments and wind instruments to sequence and compose songs, along with popular keyboard instrument sounds such as electric pianos and organs.</paragraph><paragraph>As there was still interest in<space/><link><target>analog synthesizer</target><trail>s</trail></link>, and with the increase of computing power, over the 1990s another type of synthesizer arose : the<space/><link><target>analog modeling synthesizer</target><part>analog modeling</part></link>, or &quot;virtual analog&quot; synthesizer. These use computing power to simulate traditional analog waveforms and circuitry such as envelopes and filters, with the most popular examples of this type of instrument including the<space/><link><target>Nord Lead</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Access Virus</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>As the cost of processing power and memory fell, new types of synthesizers emerged, offering a variety of novel sound synthesis options. The<space/><link><target>Korg Oasys</target></link><space/>was one such example, packaging multiple digital synthesizers into a single unit.</paragraph><paragraph>Digital synthesizers can now be completely emulated in software (&quot;<link><target>Software synthesizer</target><part>softsynth</part></link>&quot;), and run on conventional PC hardware. Such soft implementations require careful programming and a fast CPU to get the same<space/><link><target>Latency (engineering)</target><part>latency</part></link><space/>response as their dedicated equivalents. To reduce latency, some professional<space/><link><target>sound card</target></link><space/>manufacturers have developed specialized Digital Signal Processing ([DSP]) hardware. Dedicated digital synthesizers have the advantage of a performance-friendly user interface (physical controls like buttons for selecting features and enabling functionality, and knobs for setting variable parameters). On the other hand, software synthesizers have the advantages afforded by a rich graphical display.</paragraph><paragraph>With focus on performance-oriented keyboards and digital computer technology, manufacturers of commercial electronic<space/><link><target>musical instrument</target><part>instrument</part><trail>s</trail></link><space/>created some of the earliest digital<space/><link><target>synthesizer</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>for studio and experimental use with computers being able to handle built-in sound synthesis algorithms.<extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/183802/electronic-instrument/53839/Digital-synthesizers-the-music-workstation-and-MIDI#ref=ref111959</extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Analog vs. digital</heading><paragraph>The main difference is that a digital synthesizer uses digital processors and analog synthesizers use analog circuitry. A digital synthesizer is in essence a computer with (often) a piano-keyboard and a<space/><link><target>LCD</target></link><space/>as an interface. An<space/><link><target>analog synthesizer</target></link><space/>is made up of sound-generating circuitry and modulators. Because computer technology is rapidly advancing, it is often possible to offer more features in a digital synthesizer than in an analog synthesizer at a given price. However, both technologies have their own merit. Some forms of synthesis, such as, for instance,<space/><link><target>sampling (music)</target><part>sampling</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>additive synthesis</target></link><space/>are not feasible in analog synthesizers, while on the other hand, many musicians prefer the character of analog synthesizers over their digital equivalent.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Bands using digital synths</heading><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>New wave music</target><part>New wave</part></link><space/>era of the 1980s first brought the digital synthesizer to the public ear.
