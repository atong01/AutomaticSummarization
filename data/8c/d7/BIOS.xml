The first commercial licensing of [[CP/M]] took place in 1975 with contracts between [[Digital Systems (Seattle)|Digital Systems]] and [[Omron of America]] for use in their intelligent terminal, and with [[Lawrence Livermore Laboratories]] where CP/M was used to monitor programs in the [[Octopus (network)|Octopus network]]. Little attention was paid to CP/M for about a year. In my spare time, I worked to improve overall facilities [...] By this time, CP/M had been adapted for four different controllers. [...] In 1976, Glenn Ewing approached me with a problem: [[IMSAI|Imsai]], Incorporated, for whom Glenn consulted, had shipped a large number of disk subsystems with a promise that an operating system would follow. I was somewhat reluctant to adapt CP/M to yet another controller, and thus the notion of a separated Basic I/O System (BIOS) evolved. In principle, the hardware dependent portions of CP/M were concentrated in the BIOS, thus allowing Glenn, or anyone else, to adapt CP/M to the Imsai equipment. Imsai was subsequently licensed to distribute [[CP/M 1.3|CP/M version 1.3]] which eventually evolved into an operating system called [[IMDOS]].

When [[IMSAI|we]] failed to produce an operating system in a timely manner, Glenn started talking with [[Gary Kildall|Gary]] about [[CP/M|CPM]], which Gary had written for [[Intel]] under contract. It took several months of twisting Gary's arm to get Gary to port it to the 8080. The final success came when Glenn talked Gary into just separating the I/O from the rest of it, with Glenn promising to re-write the I/O module for the [[IMSAI 8080]] (which he did). So CPM on the [[IMSAI]] was a joint effort between Glenn and Gary.

[[Intel]] had hired [[Gary Kildall|him]] a few months earlier to write a control program monitor to run on their little demo system for 8008 and now 8080. [...] Glenn knew this and he would be talking with [[Gary Kildall|Gary]], and he started twisting Gary's arm. He said, "Hey Gary, why can't we run this in this IMSAI?" "The I/O's all different, won't run." But Glenn persists and finally makes a deal with Gary. He says, "Okay Gary, if you split out the I/O, I'll write the BIOS, basic I/O's system," and Glenn named it then. "We'll split it out separately. I'll write that part, as long as you can make a division in the program there." And he got Gary to do that and Glenn put those two pieces together and was running Gary's CP/M on an IMSAI. Glenn let us know that, and it wasn't too much later than [[Bill Millard|Bill]] was down there making arrangements with Gary Kildall to license [[CP/M]]. [...] Now that the BIOS is separated out, anybody could write a BIOS for their machine, if it was 8080-based, and run this, so he started selling that separately under the company [[Digital Research]] that he formed and did quite well."

Following the boot priority sequence in effect, BIOS checks each device in order to see if it is bootable. For a disk drive or a device that logically emulates a disk drive, such as a<space/><link><target>USB Flash drive</target></link><space/>or perhaps a tape drive, to perform this check the BIOS attempts to load the first sector (<link><target>boot sector</target></link>) from the disk into RAM at memory address<space/><xhtml:code>0x0000:0x7C00</xhtml:code>. If the sector cannot be read (due to a missing or unformatted disk, or due to a hardware failure), the BIOS considers the device unbootable and proceeds to check the next device. If the sector is read successfully, some BIOSes will also check for the boot sector signature 0x55 0xAA (0x55AA) in the last two bytes of the sector (which is 512 bytes long), before accepting a boot sector and considering the device bootable.<extension extension_name='ref' group="nb" name="NB_Magic_AA55"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The BIOS proceeds to test each device sequentially until a bootable device is found, at which time the BIOS transfers control to the loaded sector with a jump instruction to its first byte at address<space/><xhtml:code>0x0000:0x7C00</xhtml:code><space/>(exactly 1&amp;nbsp;KiB below the 32&amp;nbsp;KiB mark); see<space/><link><target>MBR invocation</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>VBR invocation</target></link>. (This location is one reason that an IBM PC requires at least 32&amp;nbsp;KiB of RAM in order to be equipped with a disk system; with 31 KiB or less, it would be impossible to boot from any disk, removable or fixed, using the BIOS boot protocol.) Most, but not all, BIOSes load the drive number (as used by INT 13h) of the boot drive into CPU register DL before jumping to the first byte of the loaded boot sector.</paragraph><paragraph>Note well that the BIOS does not interpret or process the contents of the boot sector other than to possibly check for the boot sector signature in the last two bytes; all interpretation of data structures like MBR partition tables and so-called BIOS Parameter Blocks is done by the boot program in the boot sector itself or by other programs loaded through the boot process and is beyond the scope of BIOS. Nothing about BIOS predicates these data structures or impedes their replacement or improvement.</paragraph><paragraph>A non-disk device such as a<space/><link><target>network adapter</target></link><space/>attempts booting by a procedure that is defined by its<space/><link><target>option ROM</target></link><space/>or the equivalent integrated into the motherboard BIOS ROM. As such, option ROMs may also influence or supplant the boot process defined by the motherboard BIOS ROM.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Boot priority</heading><paragraph>The user can control the boot process, to cause one medium to be booted instead of another when two or more bootable media are present, by taking advantage of the boot priority implemented by the BIOS. For example, most computers have a hard disk that is bootable, but usually there is a removable-media drive that has higher boot priority, so the user can cause a removable disk to be booted, simply by inserting it, without removing the hard disk drive or altering its contents to make it unbootable.</paragraph><paragraph>In most modern BIOSes, the boot priority order of all potentially bootable devices can be freely configured by the user through the BIOS configuration utility. In older BIOSes, limited boot priority options are selectable; in the earliest BIOSes, a fixed priority scheme was implemented, with floppy disk drives first, fixed disks (i.e. hard disks) second, and typically no other boot devices supported, subject to modification of these rules by installed option ROMs. The BIOS in an early PC also usually would only boot from the first floppy disk drive or the first hard disk drive, even if there were two drives of either type installed. All more advanced boot priority sequences evolved as incremental improvements on this basic system.</paragraph><paragraph>Historically the BIOS would try to boot from a floppy drive first and a hard disk second. The default for CD or DVD booting is an extension of this. With the<space/><link><target>El Torito (CD-ROM standard)</target><part>El Torito optical media boot standard</part></link>, the optical drive actually emulates a 3.5&quot; high-density floppy disk to the BIOS for boot purposes. Optical disks are a special case, because their lowest level of data organization is typically a fairly high-level file system (e.g.<space/><link><target>ISO 9660</target></link><space/>for CD-ROM).</paragraph><paragraph>Reading the &quot;first sector&quot; of a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM is not a simply defined operation like it is on a floppy disk or a hard disk. Furthermore, the complexity of the medium makes it difficult to write a useful boot program in one sector, even though optical media sectors are typically 2048 bytes each, four times the standard 512-byte size of floppy and legacy hard disk sectors. Therefore, optical media booting uses the El Torito standard, which specifies a way for an optical disk to contain an image of a high-density (1.44&amp;nbsp;MB) floppy disk and for the drive to provide access to this disk image in a simple manner that emulates floppy disk drive operations. Therefore, CD-ROM drives boot as emulated floppy disk drives; the bootable virtual floppy disk can contain software that provides access to the optical medium in its native format.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Boot failure</heading><paragraph>The behavior if the BIOS does not find a bootable device has varied as<space/><link><target>personal computer</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>developed. The original<space/><link><target>IBM PC</target></link><space/>and XT had<space/><link><target>Microsoft</target></link><space/><link><target>Cassette BASIC</target></link><space/>in ROM, and if no bootable device was found,<space/><link><target>IBM BASIC</target><part>ROM BASIC</part></link><space/>was started by calling INT 18h. Therefore, barring a hardware failure, an original IBM PC or XT would never fail to boot, either into<space/><link><target>IBM BASIC</target><part>BASIC</part></link><space/>or from disk (or through an option ROM). One model of the original IBM PC was available with no disk drive; a<space/><link><target>cassette recorder</target></link><space/>could be attached via the cassette port on the rear, for loading and saving BASIC programs to tape. Since few programs used BASIC in ROM, clone PC makers left it out; then a computer that failed to boot from a disk would display &quot;No ROM BASIC&quot; and halt (in response to INT 18h).</paragraph><paragraph>Later computers would display a message like &quot;No bootable disk found&quot;; some would prompt for a disk to be inserted and a key to be pressed, and when a key was pressed they would restart the boot process. A modern BIOS may display nothing or may automatically enter the BIOS configuration utility when the boot process fails. Unlike earlier BIOSes, modern versions are often written with the assumption that if the computer cannot be booted from a hard disk, the user will not have software that they want to boot from removable media instead. (Lately, typically it will only be a specialist computer technician who does that, only to get the computer back into a condition where it can be booted from the hard disk.)</paragraph><heading level='3'>Boot environment</heading><paragraph><template><target>Unreferenced section</target><arg name="date">October 2014</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>The environment for the boot program is very simple: the CPU is in<space/><link><target>real mode</target></link><space/>and the general-purpose and segment registers are undefined, except CS, SS, SP, and DL. CS is always zero and IP is initially<space/><xhtml:code>0x7C00</xhtml:code>. Because boot programs are always loaded at this fixed address, there is no need or motivation for a boot program to be relocatable. DL contains the drive number, as used with INT 13h, of the boot device, unless the BIOS is one that does not set the drive number in DL<template><target>snd</target></template><space/>and then DL is undefined. SS:SP points to a valid stack that is presumably large enough to support hardware interrupts, but otherwise SS and SP are undefined. (A stack must be already set up in order for interrupts to be serviced, and interrupts must be enabled in order for the system timer-tick interrupt, which BIOS always uses at least to maintain the time-of-day count and which it initializes during POST, to be active and for the keyboard to work. The keyboard works even if the BIOS keyboard service is not called; keystrokes are received and placed in the 15-character type-ahead buffer maintained by BIOS.) The boot program must set up its own stack (or at least MS-DOS 6 acts like it must), because the size of the stack set up by BIOS is unknown and its location is likewise variable; although the boot program can investigate the default stack by examining SS:SP, it is easier and shorter to just unconditionally set up a new stack.</paragraph><paragraph>At boot time, all BIOS services are available, and the memory below address<space/><xhtml:code>0x00400</xhtml:code><space/>contains the<space/><link><target>interrupt vector table</target></link>. BIOS POST has initialized the system timers (8253 or 8254 IC), interrupt controller(s), DMA controller(s), and other motherboard/chipset hardware as necessary to bring all BIOS services to ready status. DRAM refresh for all system DRAM in conventional memory and extended memory, but not necessarily expanded memory, has been set up and is running. The<space/><link><target>interrupt vector</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>corresponding to the BIOS interrupts have been set to point at the appropriate entry points in the BIOS, hardware interrupt vectors for devices initialized by the BIOS have been set to point to the BIOS-provided ISRs, and some other interrupts, including ones that BIOS generates for programs to hook, have been set to a default dummy ISR that immediately returns. The BIOS maintains a reserved block of system RAM at addresses<space/><xhtml:code>0x004000x004FF</xhtml:code><space/>with various parameters initialized during the POST. All memory at and above address<space/><xhtml:code>0x00500</xhtml:code><space/>can be used by the boot program; it may even overwrite itself.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Extensions (option ROMs)</heading><paragraph>Peripheral cards such as some hard disk drive controllers and some video display adapters have their own BIOS extension<space/><link><target>option ROM</target><trail>s</trail></link>, which provide additional functionality to BIOS. Code in these extensions runs before the BIOS boots the system from<space/><link><target>mass storage</target></link>. These ROMs typically test and initialize hardware, add new BIOS services, and augment or replace existing BIOS services with their own versions of those services. For example, a<space/><link><target>SCSI controller</target></link><space/>usually has a BIOS extension ROM that adds support for hard drives connected through that controller. Some video cards have extension ROMs that replace the video services of the motherboard BIOS with their own video services. BIOS extension ROMs gain total control of the machine, so they can in fact do anything, and they may never return control to the BIOS that invoked them. An extension ROM could in principle contain an entire operating system or an application program, or it could implement an entirely different boot process such as booting from a network. Operation of an IBM-compatible computer system can be completely changed by removing or inserting an adapter card (or a ROM chip) that contains a BIOS extension ROM.</paragraph><paragraph>The motherboard BIOS typically contains code to access hardware components necessary for bootstrapping the system, such as the keyboard, display, and storage. In addition, plug-in adapter cards such as<space/><link><target>SCSI</target></link>,<space/><link><target>RAID</target></link>,<space/><link><target>network interface card</target><trail>s</trail></link>, and video boards often include their own BIOS (e.g.<space/><link><target>Video BIOS</target></link>), complementing or replacing the system BIOS code for the given component. Even devices built into the motherboard can behave in this way; their option ROMs can be stored as separate code on the main BIOS<space/><link><target>flash chip</target></link>, and upgraded either in tandem with, or separately from, the main BIOS.</paragraph><paragraph>An add-in card requires an option ROM if the card is not supported by the main BIOS and the card needs to be initialized or made accessible through BIOS services before the operating system can be loaded (usually this means it is required in the bootstrapping process). Even when it is not required, an option ROM can allow an adapter card to be used without loading driver software from a storage device after booting begins<template><target>snd</target></template><space/>with an option ROM, no time is taken to load the driver, the driver does not take up space in RAM nor on hard disk, and the driver software on the ROM always stays with the device so the two cannot be accidentally separated. Also, if the ROM is on the card, both the peripheral hardware and the driver software provided by the ROM are installed together with no extra effort to install the software. An additional advantage of ROM on some early PC systems (notably including the IBM PCjr) was that ROM was faster than main system RAM. (On modern systems, the case is very much the reverse of this, and BIOS ROM code is usually copied (&quot;shadowed&quot;) into RAM so it will run faster.)</paragraph><paragraph>There are many methods and utilities for examining the contents of various motherboard BIOS and expansion ROMs, such as Microsoft<space/><link><target>DEBUG (DOS Command)</target><part>DEBUG</part></link><space/>or the Unix<space/><link><target>dd (Unix)</target><part>dd</part></link>.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Boot procedure</heading><paragraph>If an expansion ROM wishes to change the way the system boots (such as from a network device or a SCSI adapter for which the BIOS has no driver code) in a cooperative way, it can use the<space/><italics>BIOS Boot Specification</italics><space/>(BBS)<space/><link><target>application programming interface</target><part>API</part></link><space/>to register its ability to do so.

Then it can replace the BIOS boot process with one of its own, or it can merely modify the boot sequence by inserting its own boot actions into it, by preventing the BIOS from detecting certain devices as bootable, or both. Before the BIOS Boot Specification was promulgated, this was the only way for expansion ROMs to implement boot capability for devices not supported for booting by the native BIOS of the motherboard.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">October 2014</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='3'>Initialization</heading><paragraph>After the motherboard BIOS completes its POST, most BIOS versions search for option ROM modules, also called BIOS extension ROMs, and execute them. The motherboard BIOS scans for extension ROMs in a portion of the &quot;<link><target>upper memory area</target></link>&quot; (the part of the x86 real-mode address space at and above address 0xA0000) and runs each ROM found, in order. To discover memory-mapped<space/><link><target>Industry Standard Architecture</target><part>ISA</part></link><space/>option ROMs, a BIOS implementation scans the real-mode address space from<space/><xhtml:code>0x0C0000</xhtml:code><space/>to<space/><xhtml:code>0x0F0000</xhtml:code><space/>on 2&amp;nbsp;<link><target>KiB</target></link><space/>boundaries, looking for a two-byte ROM<space/><italics>signature</italics>: 0x55 followed by 0xAA. In a valid expansion ROM, this signature is followed by a single byte indicating the number of 512-byte blocks the expansion ROM occupies in real memory, and the next byte is the option ROM's<space/><link><target>entry point</target></link><space/>(also known as its &quot;entry offset&quot;). A<space/><link><target>checksum</target></link><space/>of the specified number of 512-byte blocks is calculated, and if the ROM has a valid checksum, the BIOS transfers control to the entry address, which in a normal BIOS extension ROM should be the beginning of the extension's initialization routine.</paragraph><paragraph>At this point, the extension ROM code takes over, typically testing and initializing the hardware it controls and registering<space/><link><target>interrupt vector</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>for use by post-boot applications. It may use BIOS services (including those provided by previously initialized option ROMs) to provide a user configuration interface, to display diagnostic information, or to do anything else that it requires. While the actions mentioned are typical behaviors of BIOS extension ROMs, each option ROM receives total control of the computer and may do anything at all, as noted with more detail in the Extensions section below; it is possible that an option ROM will not return to BIOS, pre-empting the BIOS's boot sequence altogether.</paragraph><paragraph>An option ROM should normally return to the BIOS after completing its initialization process. Once (and if) an option ROM returns, the BIOS continues searching for more option ROMs, calling each as it is found, until the entire option ROM area in the memory space has been scanned.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Physical placement</heading><paragraph>Option ROMs normally reside on adapter cards. However, the original PC, and perhaps also the PC XT, have a spare ROM socket on the motherboard (the &quot;system board&quot; in IBM's terms) into which an option ROM can be inserted, and the four ROMs that contain the BASIC interpreter can also be removed and replaced with custom ROMs which can be option ROMs. The<space/><link><target>IBM PCjr</target></link><space/>is unique among PCs in having two ROM cartridge slots on the front. Cartridges in these slots map into the same region of the upper memory area used for option ROMs, and the cartridges can contain option ROM modules that the BIOS would recognize. The cartridges can also contain other types of ROM modules, such as BASIC programs, that are handled differently. One PCjr cartridge can contain several ROM modules of different types, possibly stored together in one ROM chip.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Operating system services</heading><paragraph>The BIOS ROM is customized to the particular manufacturer's hardware, allowing low-level services (such as reading a keystroke or writing a sector of data to diskette) to be provided in a standardized way to programs, including operating systems. For example, an IBM PC might have either a monochrome or a color display adapter (using different display memory addresses and hardware), but a single, standard, BIOS system call may be invoked to display a character at a specified position on the screen in<space/><link><target>text mode</target></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>All points addressable</target><part>graphics mode</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>The BIOS provides a small<space/><link><target>library (computing)</target><part>library</part></link><space/>of basic input/output functions to operate peripherals (such as the keyboard, rudimentary text and graphics display functions and so forth). When using MS-DOS, BIOS services could be accessed by an application program (or by MS-DOS) by executing an<space/><link><target>INT 13h</target></link><space/>interrupt instruction to access disk functions, or by executing one of a number of other documented<space/><link><target>BIOS interrupt call</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>to access video display, keyboard, cassette, and other device functions.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Operating system</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and executive software that are designed to supersede this basic firmware functionality provide replacement software interfaces to application software. Applications can also provide these services to themselves. This began even in the 1980s under MS-DOS, when programmers observed that using the BIOS video services for graphics display was very slow. To increase the speed of screen output, many programs bypassed the BIOS and programmed the video display hardware directly. Other graphics programmers, particularly but not exclusively in the<space/><link><target>demoscene</target></link>, observed that there were technical capabilities of the PC display adapters that were not supported by the IBM BIOS and could not be taken advantage of without circumventing it. Since the AT-compatible BIOS ran in Intel<space/><link><target>real mode</target></link>, operating systems that ran in protected mode on 286 and later processors required hardware device drivers compatible with protected mode operation to replace BIOS services.</paragraph><paragraph>In modern personal computers running modern operating systems the BIOS is used only during booting and initial loading of system software. Before the operating system's first graphical screen is displayed, input and output are typically handled through BIOS. A boot menu such as the textual menu of Windows, which allows users to choose an operating system to boot, to boot into the safe mode, or to use the last known good configuration, is displayed through BIOS and receives keyboard input through BIOS.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">October 2014</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Most modern PCs can still boot and run legacy operating systems such as MS-DOS or DR-DOS that rely heavily on BIOS for their console and disk I/O, providing that the system has a BIOS or BIOS-compatible firmware, which is not necessarily the case with UEFI-based PCs.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Processor microcode updates</heading><paragraph><link><target>Intel</target></link><space/>processors have reprogrammable<space/><link><target>microcode</target></link><space/>since the<space/><link><target>P6 (microarchitecture)</target><part>P6</part></link><space/>microarchitecture.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Mueller-1"></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="microcode-09"></extension><space/>The BIOS may contain patches to the processor microcode that fix errors in the initial processor microcode; reprogramming is not persistent, thus loading of microcode updates is performed each time the system is powered up.

published the entire listings of the BIOS for its original PC, PC XT, PC AT, and other contemporary PC models, in an appendix of the Technical Reference manual for each machine type. The effect of the publication of the BIOS listings is that anyone can see exactly what a definitive BIOS does and how it does it.<space/><link><target>Phoenix Technologies</target></link><space/>was the first company to write a fully compatible and completely legal BIOS through clean-room<space/><link><target>reverse engineering</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>New standards grafted onto the BIOS are usually without complete public documentation or any BIOS listings. As a result, it is not as easy to learn the intimate details about the many non-IBM additions to BIOS as about the core BIOS services.</paragraph><paragraph>Most PC motherboard suppliers license a BIOS &quot;core&quot; and toolkit from a commercial third-party, known as an &quot;independent BIOS vendor&quot; or IBV. The motherboard manufacturer then customizes this BIOS to suit its own hardware. For this reason, updated BIOSes are normally obtained directly from the motherboard manufacturer. Major BIOS vendors include<space/><link><target>American Megatrends</target></link><space/>(AMI),<space/><link><target>Insyde Software</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Phoenix Technologies</target></link><space/>and Byosoft.

However, this advantage had the risk that an improperly executed or aborted BIOS update could render the computer or device unusable. To avoid these situations, more recent BIOSes use a &quot;boot block&quot;; a portion of the BIOS which runs first and must be updated separately. This code verifies if the rest of the BIOS is intact (using<space/><link><target>hash function</target><part>hash</part></link><space/><link><target>checksum</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>or other methods) before transferring control to it. If the boot block detects any corruption in the main BIOS, it will typically warn the user that a recovery process must be initiated by booting from<space/><link><target>removable media</target></link><space/>(floppy, CD or USB memory) so the user can try flashing the BIOS again. Some<space/><link><target>motherboard</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>have a<space/><italics>backup</italics><space/>BIOS (sometimes referred to as DualBIOS boards) to recover from BIOS corruptions.</paragraph><paragraph>There are at least four known BIOS attack viruses, two of which were for demonstration purposes. The first one found in the wild was<space/><italics>Mebromi</italics>, targeting Chinese users.</paragraph><paragraph>The first BIOS virus was<space/><link><target>CIH (computer virus)</target><part>CIH</part></link>, whose name matches the initials of its creator, Chen Ing Hau. CIH was also called the &quot;Chernobyl Virus&quot;, because its payload date was 1999-04-26, the 13th anniversary of the<space/><link><target>Chernobyl accident</target></link>. CIH appeared in mid-1998 and became active in April 1999. It was able to erase flash ROM BIOS content. Often, infected computers could no longer boot, and people had to remove the flash ROM IC from the motherboard and reprogram it. CIH targeted the then-widespread Intel i430TX motherboard chipset and took advantage of the fact that the<space/><link><target>Windows 9x</target></link><space/>operating systems, also widespread at the time, allowed direct hardware access to all programs.</paragraph><paragraph>Modern systems are not vulnerable to CIH because of a variety of chipsets being used which are incompatible with the Intel i430TX chipset, and also other flash ROM IC types. There is also extra protection from accidental BIOS rewrites in the form of boot blocks which are protected from accidental overwrite or dual and quad BIOS equipped systems which may, in the event of a crash, use a backup BIOS. Also, all modern operating systems such as<space/><link><target>FreeBSD</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Linux</target></link>,<space/><link><target>OS X</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Windows NT</target></link>-based Windows OS like<space/><link><target>Windows 2000</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Windows XP</target></link><space/>and newer, do not allow user-mode programs to have direct hardware access.</paragraph><paragraph>As a result, as of 2008, CIH has become essentially harmless, at worst causing annoyance by infecting executable files and triggering antivirus software. Other BIOS viruses remain possible, however;<extension extension_name='ref' name="Yam"><link type='external' href='http://www.tomshardware.com/news/bios-virus-rootkit-security-backdoor,7400.html'>New BIOS Virus Withstands HDD Wipes</link>, March 27, 2009. Marcus Yam. Tom's Hardware US</extension><space/>since most Windows home users without Windows Vista/7's UAC run all applications with administrative privileges, a modern CIH-like virus could in principle still gain access to hardware without first using an exploit. The operating system<space/><link><target>OpenBSD</target></link><space/>prevents all users from having this access and the grsecurity patch for the linux kernel also prevents this direct hardware access by default, the difference being an attacker requiring a much more difficult kernel level exploit or reboot of the machine.</paragraph><paragraph>The second BIOS virus was a technique presented by John Heasman, principal security consultant for UK-based Next-Generation Security Software. In 2006, at the Black Hat Security Conference, he showed how to elevate privileges and read physical memory, using malicious procedures that replaced normal<space/><link><target>Advanced Configuration and Power Interface</target><part>ACPI</part></link><space/>functions stored in flash memory.</paragraph><paragraph>The third BIOS virus was a technique called &quot;Persistent BIOS infection.&quot; It appeared in 2009 at the CanSecWest Security Conference in Vancouver, and at the SyScan Security Conference in Singapore. Researchers Anibal Sacco<extension extension_name='ref' name="AutoTU-1"></extension><space/>and Alfredo Ortega, from Core Security Technologies, demonstrated how to insert malicious code into the decompression routines in the BIOS, allowing for nearly full control of the PC at start-up, even before the operating system is booted. The proof-of-concept does not exploit a flaw in the BIOS implementation, but only involves the normal BIOS flashing procedures. Thus, it requires physical access to the machine, or for the user to be root. Despite these requirements, Ortega underlined the profound implications of his and Sacco's discovery: &quot;We can patch a driver to drop a fully working<space/><link><target>rootkit</target></link>.
