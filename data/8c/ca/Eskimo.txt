The '''Eskimo''' are the [[indigenous peoples]] who have traditionally inhabited the northern circumpolar region from eastern [[Siberia]] ([[Russia]]), across [[Alaska]] ([[United States]]), [[Canada]], and [[Greenland]].<ref name=anlc>Kaplan, Lawrence.

The two main peoples known as "Eskimo" are: the [[Inuit]] of Canada, Northern Alaska (sub-group "[[Inupiat]]"), and Greenland, and the [[Yupik peoples|Yupik]] of eastern Siberia and Alaska. The Yupik comprise speakers of four distinct Yupik languages: one used in the [[Russian Far East]] and the others among people of Western Alaska, [[Southcentral Alaska]] and along the [[Gulf of Alaska]] coast.  A third northern group, the [[Aleut]], is closely related to the Eskimo. They share a relatively recent, common ("[[Paleo-Eskimo]]") ancestor, and a language group ([[Eskimo-Aleut]]).

While since the late 20th century, numerous indigenous people rejected the use of the term "Eskimo" as offensive, because it was used by people who discriminated against them,<ref>[https://www.ethnologue.com/language/esk "Inupiatun, Northwest Alaska."] ''Ethnologue''.

In Canada and Greenland, the term "Eskimo" has fallen out of favor as pejorative and has been widely replaced by the term "Inuit", "[[Alaska Natives]]", or terms specific to a particular tribe. Under U.S. and Alaskan law, however, as well as the linguistic and cultural traditions of Alaska, "Alaska Natives" refers to ''all'' indigenous peoples of Alaska. The term is applied to not only such groups as the Aleut, who share a recent ancestor with the Inuit and Yupik groups, but also to the largely unrelated<ref>http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/1207/12072012-native-american-migration</ref> [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]] and the [[Dene]], who descend from other, unrelated major language and ethnic groups.

==History==
Several earlier indigenous peoples existed in the region. The earliest positively identified North American Eskimo cultures (pre-Dorset) date to 5,000 years ago. They appear to have developed in Alaska from people related to the [[Arctic small tool tradition]] in eastern Asia, whose ancestors had probably migrated to Alaska at least 3,000 to 5,000 years earlier. Similar artifacts have been found in Siberia that date to perhaps 18,000 years ago.

The [[Yupik languages]] and cultures in Alaska evolved in place (and migrated back to Siberia), beginning with the original [[Dorset culture|pre-Dorset]] indigenous culture developed in Alaska. Approximately 4000 years ago, the Unangan culture of the [[Aleut]] became distinct. It is not generally considered an Eskimo culture.

Approximately 1500–2000 years ago, apparently in Northwestern Alaska, two other distinct variations appeared. Inuit language became distinct and, over a period of several centuries, its speakers migrated across Northern Alaska, through [[Canada]] and into [[Greenland]]. The distinct culture of the [[Thule people]] developed in northwestern Alaska and very quickly spread over the entire area occupied by Eskimo people, though it was not necessarily adopted by all of them.

==Nomenclature==

===Origin===
{{Wiktionary|eskimo|Eskimo}}

Two principal competing etymologies have been proposed for the name "Eskimo," both derived from the [[Innu-aimun]] (Montagnais) language, an Algonquian language of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] coast. The most commonly accepted today appears to be the proposal of [[Ives Goddard]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], who derives it from the Montagnais word meaning "snowshoe-netter"<ref name="aueo"/> or "to net snowshoes."<ref name=anlc/> The word ''assime·w'' means "she laces a snowshoe" in Montagnais.  Montagnais speakers refer to the neighbouring [[Mi'kmaq people]] using words that sound very much like ''eskimo''.<ref name="goddard">Goddard, Ives (1984). "Synonymy," In ''Arctic'', ed. David Damas. Vol. 5 of ''Handbook of North American Indians'', ed. William C. Sturtevant, pp. 5–7. Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution. Cited in Campbell 1997</ref><ref name="campbell">Campbell, Lyle (1997). ''American Indian Languages: The Historical Linguistics of Native America'', pg. 394. New York: Oxford University Press</ref>  

Secondly, Jose Mailhot, a Quebec anthropologist who speaks Montagnais, published a paper in 1978 suggesting that Eskimo meant "people who speak a different language".<ref name="mailhot">Mailhot, J. (1978). "L'étymologie de «Esquimau» revue et corrigée," ''Etudes Inuit/Inuit Studies'' 2-2:59–70.</ref><ref name="creeml"/> French traders who encountered the Montagnais in the eastern areas, adopted their word for the more western peoples and spelled it as ''Esquimau'' in a transliteration.

In Canada and Greenland the term ''Eskimo'' has largely been supplanted by the term ''Inuit''.<ref name=anlc/><ref name="stern1"/><ref name="ostg1"/><ref name="bartlebyinuit">usage note, [http://www.bartleby.com/61/10/I0211000.html Inuit], ''American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'': Fourth Edition, 2000</ref> While ''Inuit'' accurately can be applied to all of the Eskimo peoples in Canada and Greenland, that is not true in Alaska and Siberia. In Alaska the term 'Eskimo' is commonly used, because it includes both Yupik and Iñupiat. 'Inuit' is not accepted as a collective term and it is not used specifically for Iñupiat (although they are Inuit).<ref name=anlc/>

In 1977, the Inuit Circumpolar Conference meeting in Barrow, Alaska, officially adopted Inuit as a designation for all circumpolar native peoples, regardless of their local view on an appropriate term.  As a result, the Canadian government usage has replaced the (locally) defunct term Eskimo with ''Inuit'' (''Inuk'' in singular). The preferred term in Canada's Central Arctic is ''Inuinnaq'',<ref name=translate>{{cite book|last=Ohokak|first=G.|author2=M. Kadlun |author3=B. Harnum |title=Inuinnaqtun-English Dictionary|publisher=Kitikmeot Heritage Society}}</ref> and in the eastern Canadian Arctic ''Inuit''. The language is often called ''Inuktitut'', though other local designations are also used.

The [[Greenlandic Inuit|Inuit of Greenland]] refer to themselves as "Greenlanders" and speak the [[Greenlandic language]].<ref name=ethno>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=kal "Inuktitut, Greenlandic."] ''Ethnologue.'' Retrieved 6 Aug 2012.</ref>

Because of the linguistic, ethnic, and cultural differences between Yupik and Inuit peoples, it seems unlikely that any umbrella term will be acceptable. There has been some movement to use ''Inuit'', and the [[Inuit Circumpolar Council]], representing a circumpolar population of 150,000 Inuit and Yupik people of Greenland, Canada, Alaska, and Siberia, in its charter defines ''Inuit'' for use within that ICC document as including "the Inupiat, Yupik (Alaska), Inuit, [[Inuvialuit]] (Canada), [[Kalaallit]] (Greenland) and Yupik (Russia)."<ref name="ICCcharter">Inuit Circumpolar Council. (2006). [http://inuitcircumpolar.com/index.php?auto_slide=&ID=374&Lang=En&Parent_ID=&current_slide_num= "Charter."] Retrieved on 2007-04-06.</ref>  But, in Alaska, the Inuit people refer to themselves as ''Iñupiat'', plural, and ''Iñupiaq'', singular (their [[North Alaskan Inupiatun language]] is also called ''Iñupiaq'') and do not use the term Inuit as commonly.  Thus, in Alaska, ''Eskimo'' is in common usage.<ref name=anlc/>

Alaskans also use the term [[Alaska Natives|Alaska Native]], which is inclusive of all Eskimo, Aleut and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] people of Alaska. It does not apply to Inuit or Yupik people originating outside the state. The term ''Alaska Native'' has important legal usage in Alaska and the rest of the United States as a result of the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]] of 1971.

The term "Eskimo" is also used in linguistic or ethnographic works to denote the larger branch of Eskimo–Aleut languages, the smaller branch being Aleut.

The [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo–Aleut]] family of languages includes two cognate branches: the [[Aleut language|Aleut]] (Unangan) branch and the Eskimo branch. The Eskimo sub-family consists of the [[Inuit language]] and Yupik language sub-groups.<ref name="FortecueM">{{Cite journal | title = Comparative Eskimo Dictionary with Aleut Cognates | author = Michael Fortescue|author2=Steven Jacobson |author3=Lawance Kaplan  | publisher = [[Alaska Native Language Center]], [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]]}}</ref> The [[Sireniki Eskimo language|Sirenikski language]], which is virtually extinct, is sometimes regarded as a third branch of the Eskimo language family.

Inuit languages comprise a [[dialect continuum]], or dialect chain, that stretches from [[Unalakleet, Alaska|Unalakleet]] and [[Norton Sound]] in Alaska, across northern Alaska and Canada, and east to Greenland. Changes from western (Iñupiaq) to eastern dialects are marked by the dropping of vestigial Yupik-related features, increasing consonant assimilation (e.g., ''kumlu'', meaning "thumb", changes to ''kuvlu'', changes to ''kublu'',<ref name=livingdict/> changes to ''kulluk'',<ref name=livingdict/> changes to ''kulluq''<ref name=livingdict>{{cite web|url=http://www.livingdictionary.com/search/viewResults.jsp?language=en&searchString=thumb&languageSet=all |title=thumb|work=Asuilaak Living Dictionary|accessdate=2007-11-25}}</ref>), and increased consonant lengthening, and lexical change. Thus, speakers of two adjacent Inuit dialects would usually be able to understand one another, but speakers from dialects distant from each other on the dialect continuum would have difficulty understanding one another.<ref name="kaplanB"/> [[Seward Peninsula]] dialects in Western Alaska, where much of the [[Inupiat people|Iñupiat]] culture has been in place for perhaps less than 500 years, are greatly affected by phonological influence from the Yupik languages. Eastern Greenlandic, at the opposite end of the Inuit range, has had significant word replacement due to a unique form of ritual name avoidance.<ref name="FortecueM"/><ref name="kaplanB"/>

The four [[Yupik languages]], by contrast, including Alutiiq (Sugpiaq), Central Alaskan Yup'ik, Naukan (Naukanski), and Siberian Yupik, are distinct languages with phonological, morphological, and lexical differences. They demonstrate limited mutual intelligibility.<ref name="FortecueM"/> Additionally, both Alutiiq and Central Yup'ik have considerable dialect diversity. The northernmost Yupik languages – Siberian Yupik and [[Naukanski Yupik]] – are linguistically only slightly closer to Inuit than is Alutiiq, which is the southernmost of the Yupik languages. Although the grammatical structures of Yupik and Inuit languages are similar, they have pronounced differences phonologically. Differences of vocabulary between Inuit and any one of the Yupik languages are greater than between any two Yupik languages.<ref name="kaplanB"/> Even the dialectal differences within Alutiiq and Central Alaskan Yup'ik sometimes are relatively great for locations that are relatively close geographically.<ref name="kaplanB"/>

The Sirenikski language is sometimes regarded as a third branch of the Eskimo language family, but other sources regard it as a group belonging to the Yupik branch.<ref name="kaplanB"/>

The Inuit inhabit the [[Arctic]] and northern [[Bering Sea]] coasts of Alaska in the United States, and Arctic coasts of the [[Northwest Territories]], [[Nunavut]], [[Quebec]], and [[Labrador]] in Canada, and Greenland (associated with Denmark). Until fairly recent times, there has been a remarkable homogeneity in the culture throughout this area, which traditionally relied on fish, sea mammals, and land animals for food, heat, light, clothing, and tools.

The Alutiiq, also called ''Pacific Yupik'' or ''Sugpiaq'', are a southern, coastal branch of Yupik. They are not to be confused with the Aleut, who live further to the southwest, including along the [[Aleutian Islands]]. They traditionally lived a coastal lifestyle, subsisting primarily on ocean resources such as [[salmon]], [[halibut]], and whales, as well as rich land resources such as berries and land mammals. Alutiiq people today live in coastal fishing communities, where they work in all aspects of the modern economy. They also maintain the cultural value of subsistence.

The Alutiiq language is relatively close to that spoken by the Yupik in the [[Bethel, Alaska]] area. But, it is considered a distinct language with two major dialects: the Koniag dialect, spoken on the [[Alaska Peninsula]] and on [[Kodiak Island]], and the Chugach dialect, spoken on the southern [[Kenai Peninsula]] and in [[Prince William Sound]]. Residents of [[Nanwalek, Alaska|Nanwalek]], located on southern part of the Kenai Peninsula near [[Seldovia, Alaska|Seldovia]], speak what they call Sugpiaq. They are able to understand those who speak Yupik in Bethel.

The use of the apostrophe in the name ''Yup'ik'' is a written convention to denote the long pronunciation of the ''p'' sound; but it is spoken the same in other Yupik languages. Of all the [[:Category:Indigenous languages of Alaska|Alaska Native languages]], Central Alaskan Yup'ik has the most speakers, with about 10,000 of a total Yup'ik population of 21,000 still speaking the language. The five dialects of Central Alaskan Yup'ik include General Central Yup'ik, and the Egegik, Norton Sound, Hooper Bay-Chevak, and Nunivak dialects.

{{Main|Sirenik Eskimos}}
Some speakers of Siberian Yupik languages used to speak an Eskimo variant in the past, before they underwent a [[language shift]]. These former speakers of Sirenik Eskimo language inhabited the settlements of Sireniki, <!--This is the correct spelling as per the source. Please don't use AWB to change it.

As early as in 1895, <!--This is the correct spelling as per the source. Please don't use AWB to change it. Thanks.-->Imtuk was  a settlement with a mixed population of Sirenik Eskimos and Ungazigmit<ref>Меновщиков 1964: 7</ref> (the latter belonging to Siberian Yupik). Sirenik Eskimo culture has been influenced by that of Chukchi, and the language shows [[Chukchi language]] influences.<ref name=linfranc>[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000861/086162e.pdf Menovshchikov 1990]: 70</ref> Folktale [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]] also show the influence of Chuckchi culture.<ref name=rein-rape>Меновщиков 1964: 132</ref>

Many words are formed from entirely different [[Root (linguistics)|root]]s than in Siberian Yupik,<ref name=diff-root>Меновщиков 1964: 42</ref> but even the grammar has several peculiarities distinct not only among Eskimo languages, but even compared to Aleut.

Little is known about the origin of this diversity. The peculiarities of this language may be the result of a supposed long isolation from other Eskimo groups,<ref>Меновщиков 1962: 11</ref><ref>Меновщиков 1964: 9</ref> and being in contact only with speakers of unrelated languages for many centuries. The influence of the Chukchi language is clear.<ref name=linfranc/>

==Myths and misconceptions about the Eskimo==
[[File:Eskimo fisherman's summer house, Alaska page 250.png|thumb|Eskimo ([[Central Alaskan Yup'ik people|Yup'ik]] of [[Nelson Island (Alaska)|Nelson Island]]) fisherman's summer house]]
There are common erroneous ideas about the Eskimo. These include:
*"They have thousands of words for snow." [[Eskimo–Aleut languages]] have about the same number of distinct word roots referring to snow as does English. But, the [[agglutinative]] structure of these languages allows almost infinite combinations of prefixes and suffices to these roots - so 'snow' can form as many 'words' as any other root. See [[Eskimo words for snow]]. 
*"They live in [[igloo]]s." The word "igloo" or ''iglu'' simply means "house". These peoples built the snow houses associated with them as temporary shelters to be used during hunting seasons in the late winter and spring. The snow house made of blocks of snow and designed to retain heat expressed their important survival skill in making use of available materials. In the 21st century, these people build such snow houses today generally only in emergencies or for fun, as part of the transfer of traditional knowledge between generations.
