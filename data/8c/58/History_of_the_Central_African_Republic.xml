The earliest period of settlement began around 10,000 years ago when nomadic people first began to settle, farm and fish in the region. The next period began around 1,000 to 3,000 years ago when several non-indigenous groups began to migrate into the region from other parts of the continent. The third period involved the colonial conquest and rule of the country by France and Germany which spanned from the late 1800s until 1960 when Central African Republic became an independent state. The final period has been the era during which Central African Republic been an independent state.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Early history</heading><paragraph>Approximately 10,000 years ago,<space/><link><target>desertification</target></link><space/>forced hunter-gatherer societies south into the Sahel regions of northern Central Africa, where some groups settled and began farming as part of the<space/><link><target>Neolithic Revolution</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Eastern Africa 2011, pg. 4">The History of Central and Eastern Africa, Amy McKenna, 2011, pg. 4</extension><space/>Initial farming of<space/><link><target>Dioscorea rotundata</target><part>white yam</part></link><space/>progressed into<space/><link><target>millet</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>sorghum</target></link>, and the later the domestication of<space/><link><target>Elaeis guineensis</target><part>African oil palm</part></link><space/>improved the groups' nutrition and allowed for expansion of the local populations.<extension extension_name='ref'>The History of Central and Eastern Africa, Amy McKenna, 2011, pg. 5</extension><space/>Bananas arrived in the region and added an important source of carbohydrates to the diet; they were also used in the production of alcohol.<template><target>when</target><arg name="date">June 2014</arg></template><space/>This Agricultural Revolution, combined with a &quot;Fish-stew Revolution&quot;, in which fishing began to take place, and the use of boats, allowed for the transportation of goods.

This situation left France without her much coveted outlet on the Nile.</paragraph><paragraph>Once European negotiators had agreed upon the borders of the French Congo, France had to decide how to pay for the costly occupation, administration, and development of the territory it had acquired. The reported financial successes of Leopold II's concessionary companies in the Congo Free State convinced the French government to grant 17 private companies large concessions in the Ubangi-Shari region in 1899. In return for the right to exploit these lands by buying local products and selling European goods, the companies promised to pay rent to France and to promote the development of their concessions. The companies employed European and African agents who frequently used brutal methods to force the natives to labor.</paragraph><paragraph>At the same time, the French colonial administration began to force the local population to pay<space/><link><target>tax</target><trail>es</trail></link><space/>and to provide the state with free labor.

He exposed the continuing atrocities committed against Central Africans in Western Ubangi-Shari by such employers as the Forestry Company of Sangha-Ubangi. In 1928, a major insurrection, the<space/><link><target>Kongo-Wara rebellion</target></link><space/>or 'war of the hoe handle', broke out in Western Ubangi-Shari and continued for several years. The extent of this insurrection, which was perhaps the largest anti-colonial rebellion in Africa during the interwar years, was carefully hidden from the French public because it provided evidence of strong opposition to French colonial rule and forced labor.</paragraph><paragraph>During the 1930s,<space/><link><target>cotton</target></link>,<space/><link><target>tea</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>coffee</target></link><space/>emerged as important cash crops in Ubangi-Shari and the mining of<space/><link><target>diamond</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>gold</target></link><space/>began in earnest.

His regime was characterized by numerous human rights atrocities.

In 1985, the CRMN was dissolved, and Kolingba named a new cabinet with increased civilian participation, signaling the start of a return to civilian rule. The process of democratization quickened in 1986 with the creation of a new political party, the Rassemblement Dmocratique Centrafricain (RDC), and the drafting of a new constitution that subsequently was ratified in a national referendum. General Kolingba was sworn in as constitutional President on 29 November 1986. The constitution established a National Assembly made up of 52 elected deputies, elected in July 1987 and municipal elections were held in 1988. Kolingba's two major political opponents, Abel Goumba and<space/><link><target>Ange-Flix Patass</target></link>, boycotted these elections because their parties were not allowed to participate.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">June 2014</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='3'>Pro-Democracy Movement</heading><paragraph>By 1990, inspired by the fall of the Berlin Wall, a pro-democracy movement became very active. In May 1990, a letter signed by 253 prominent citizens asked for the convocation of a National Conference, but Kolingba refused this request and instead detained several opponents. Pressure from the United States, France, and from a group of locally represented countries and agencies called GIBAFOR (France, the USA, Germany, Japan, the EU, the World Bank, and the UN) finally led Kolingba to agree, in principle, to hold free elections in October 1992 with help from the UN Office of Electoral Affairs.</paragraph><paragraph>After using the excuse of alleged irregularities to suspend the results of the elections as a pretext for holding on to power, President Kolingba came under intense pressure from GIBAFOR to establish a &quot;Conseil National Politique Provisoire de la Rpublique&quot; (Provisional National Political Council, CNPPR) and to set up a &quot;Mixed Electoral Commission&quot;, which included representatives from all political parties.</paragraph><paragraph>When elections were finally held in 1993, again with the help of the international community, Ange-Flix Patass led in the first round and Kolingba came in fourth behind Abel Goumba and David Dacko. In the second round, Patass won 53% of the vote while Goumba won 45.6%. Most of Patass's support came from Gbaya, Kare, and Kaba voters in seven heavily populated prefectures in the northwest while Goumba's support came largely from ten less-populated prefectures in the south and east. Furthermore, Patass's party, the<space/><italics>Mouvement pour la Libration du Peuple Centrafricain</italics><space/>(MLPC) or Movement for the Liberation of the Central African People, gained a simple but not an absolute majority of seats in parliament, which meant Patass's party required coalition partners.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Patass Government (19932003)</heading><paragraph><template><target>unreferenced section</target><arg name="date">June 2014</arg></template>Patass relieved former President Kolingba of his military rank of general in March 1994 and then charged several former ministers with various crimes.

In 19961997, reflecting steadily decreasing public confidence in the government's erratic behaviour, three mutinies against Patass's administration were accompanied by widespread destruction of property and heightened ethnic tension. On 25 January 1997, the<space/><link><target>Bangui Agreements</target></link>, which provided for the deployment of an inter-African military mission, the<space/><italics>Mission Interafricaine de Surveillance des Accords de Bangui</italics><space/>(MISAB), were signed.

Eventually, Patass came to suspect that General<space/><link><target>Franois Boziz</target></link><space/>was involved in another coup attempt against him, which led Boziz to flee with loyal troops to Chad. In March 2003, Boziz launched a surprise attack against Patass, who was out of the country.

The MLPC came in second with 11 seats while the RDC won only eight seats. The remaining seats were won by independents or by smaller parties.

However, Patass, who was living in exile in<space/><link><target>Togo</target></link>, could not be ruled out as a leader of a future uprising. His supporters reportedly were joining or were prepared to join rebel movements in belief that their leader was still the rightful head of state of the country. Further, members of Kolingba's<space/><link><target>Yakoma people</target><part>Yakoma</part></link><space/>tribe in the south posed a potential threat to Boziz's government because of their widespread boycott of the second round of the legislative elections.
