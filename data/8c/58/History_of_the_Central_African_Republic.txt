{{History of the Central African Republic}}
The  '''history of the [[Central African Republic]]''' is roughly composed of four distinct periods. The earliest period of settlement began around 10,000 years ago when nomadic people first began to settle, farm and fish in the region. The next period began around 1,000 to 3,000 years ago when several non-indigenous groups began to migrate into the region from other parts of the continent. The third period involved the colonial conquest and rule of the country by France and Germany which spanned from the late 1800s until 1960 when Central African Republic became an independent state. The final period has been the era during which Central African Republic been an independent state.

== Early history ==
Approximately 10,000 years ago, [[desertification]] forced hunter-gatherer societies south into the Sahel regions of northern Central Africa, where some groups settled and began farming as part of the [[Neolithic Revolution]].<ref name="Eastern Africa 2011, pg. 4">The History of Central and Eastern Africa, Amy McKenna, 2011, pg. 4</ref> Initial farming of [[Dioscorea rotundata|white yam]] progressed into [[millet]] and [[sorghum]], and the later the domestication of [[Elaeis guineensis|African oil palm]] improved the groups' nutrition and allowed for expansion of the local populations.<ref>The History of Central and Eastern Africa, Amy McKenna, 2011, pg. 5</ref> Bananas arrived in the region and added an important source of carbohydrates to the diet; they were also used in the production of alcohol.{{when|date=June 2014}} This Agricultural Revolution, combined with a "Fish-stew Revolution", in which fishing began to take place, and the use of boats, allowed for the transportation of goods. Products were often moved in [[ceramic]] pots, which are the first known examples of [[artistic expression]] from the region's inhabitants.<ref name="Eastern Africa 2011, pg. 4"/>

The [[Bouar|Bouar Megaliths]] in the western region of the country indicate an advanced level of habitation dating back to the very late [[Neolithic|Neolithic Era]] (c. 3500-2700 BC).<ref>Methodology and African Prehistory by, [[UNESCO]].

During the [[Bantu expansion|Bantu Migrations]] from about 1000 BC to AD 1000, [[Ubangian]]-speaking people spread eastward from Cameroon to Sudan, [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking people settled in the southwestern regions of the CAR, and [[Central Sudanic]]-speaking people settled along the [[Ubangi River]] in what is today Central and East CAR.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Production of [[copper]], [[salt]], [[dried fish]], and [[textiles]] dominated the economic trade in the Central African region.<ref>The History of Central and Eastern Africa, Amy McKenna, 2011, pg. 10</ref>

The territory of modern [[Central African Republic]] is known to have been settled from at least the 7th century {{citation needed|date=December 2012}} on by overlapping empires, including the [[Kanem Empire|Kanem-Bornu]], [[Ouaddai Kingdom|Ouaddai]], [[Baguirmi Kingdom|Baguirmi]], and [[Dafour]] groups based on the [[Lake Chad]] region and along the [[Upper Nile, Sudan|Upper Nile]].

== 16th-19th Century==
During the 16th and 17th centuries [[arab slave trade|Muslim slave traders]] began to raid the region and their captives were shipped to the Mediterranean coast, Europe, Arabia, the Western Hemisphere, or to the slave ports and factories along the West African coast.<ref name="africanhistory.about.com">Central Africa Republic Timeline -- Part 1: From Prehistory to Independence (13 August 1960), A Chronology of Key Events in Central Africa Republic, By Alistair Boddy-Evans, About.com, http://africanhistory.about.com/od/car/l/bl-CAR-Timeline-1.htm</ref> The [[Bangi language|Bobangi people]] became major slave traders{{when|date=June 2014}} and sold their captives to the Americas using the Ubangi river to reach the coast.<ref>"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/102152/Central-African-Republic/214025/The-arts-and-cultural-institutions Central African Republic]".

==Colonial to Decolonization ==

===French colony (1894–1940)===
In 1875 the [[Sudan]]ese sultan [[Rabih az-Zubayr]] governed Upper-Oubangui, which included present-day CAR. Europeans, primarily the French, German, and [[Belgium|Belgians]], arrived in the area in 1885. The French consolidated their legal claim to the area through an 1887 convention with [[Congo Free State]], which granted France possession of the right bank of the [[Oubangui River]]. Two years later, the French established an outpost at [[Bangui]], and in 1894, [[Oubangui-Chari]] became a French territory. However, the French did not consolidate their control over the area until 1903, after having defeated the forces of Rabih in the [[battle of Kousséri]], and established colonial administration throughout the territory. In 1906, the Oubangui-Chari territory was united with the [[Chad]] colony; in 1910, it became one of the four territories of the [[Federation of French Equatorial Africa]] (AEF), along with Chad, [[Republic of the Congo|Middle Congo]], and [[Gabon]]. The next thirty years were marked by mostly small scale revolts against French rule and the development of a [[plantation]]-style economy. The largest of these revolts was the [[Kongo-Wara rebellion]], when over 350,000 natives rebelled against the colonial administration.

The European penetration of Central African territory began in the late 19th century during the [[Scramble for Africa]].<ref>[http://www.discoverfrance.net/Colonies/Centr_Afr_Rep.shtml French Colonies – Central African Republic]. Discoverfrance.net. Retrieved on 6 April 2013.</ref> Count [[Savorgnan de Brazza]] established the [[French Congo]] and sent expeditions up the Ubangi River from [[Brazzaville]] in an effort to expand France's claims to territory in Central Africa. [[Belgium]], [[German Empire|Germany]], and the [[United Kingdom]] also competed to establish their claims to territory in the region.

In 1889, the French established a post on the Ubangi River at Bangui. In 1890–91, de Brazza sent expeditions up the [[Sangha River]], in what is now south-western CAR, up the center of the Ubangi basin toward [[Lake Chad]], and eastward along the Ubangi River toward the [[Nile]], with the intention of expanding the borders of the French Congo to link up the other French territories in Africa. In 1894, the French Congo's borders with [[Leopold II of Belgium]]'s [[Congo Free State]] and [[German Cameroon]] were fixed by diplomatic agreements. In 1899, the French Congo's border with Sudan was fixed along the [[Congo-Nile divide]]. This situation left France without her much coveted outlet on the Nile.

Once European negotiators had agreed upon the borders of the French Congo, France had to decide how to pay for the costly occupation, administration, and development of the territory it had acquired. The reported financial successes of Leopold II's concessionary companies in the Congo Free State convinced the French government to grant 17 private companies large concessions in the Ubangi-Shari region in 1899. In return for the right to exploit these lands by buying local products and selling European goods, the companies promised to pay rent to France and to promote the development of their concessions. The companies employed European and African agents who frequently used brutal methods to force the natives to labor.

At the same time, the French colonial administration began to force the local population to pay [[tax]]es and to provide the state with free labor. The companies and the French administration at times collaborated in forcing the Central Africans to work for them. Some French officials{{who|date=January 2014}} reported abuses committed by private company militias, and their own colonial colleagues and troops, but efforts to hold these people accountable almost invariably failed. When any news of atrocities committed against Central Africans reached France and caused an outcry, investigations were undertaken and some feeble attempts at reform were made{{by whom|date=January 2014}}, but the [[facts on the ground|situation on the ground]] in Ubangi-Shari remained virtually unchanged.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

During the first decade of French colonial rule, from about 1900 to 1910, the rulers of the Ubangi-Shari region increased both their slave-raiding activities and the selling of local produce to Europe. They took advantage of their treaties with the French to procure more [[Firearm|weapons]], which were used to capture more slaves: much of the eastern half of Ubangi-Shari was depopulated as a result of slave-trading by local rulers during the first decade of colonial rule. After the power of local African rulers was destroyed by the French, slave raiding greatly diminished.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In 1911, the Sangha and Lobaye basins were ceded to Germany as part of an agreement which gave France a free hand in [[Morocco]]. Western Ubangi-Shari remained under German rule until World War I, after which France again annexed the territory using Central African troops.

[[File:De Gaulle Bangui 1940.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Charles de Gaulle]] in Bangui, 1940.]]
From 1920 to 1930, a network of roads was built, [[cash crop]]s were promoted and mobile health services were formed to combat [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]]. [[Protestant]] [[Mission (Christianity)|missions]] were established in different parts of the country. New forms of forced labor were also introduced, however, as the French conscripted large numbers of Ubangians to work on the [[Congo-Ocean Railway]]; many of these recruits died of exhaustion and illness as a result of the poor conditions.

In 1925, the French writer [[André Gide]] published ''Voyage au Congo'', in which he described the alarming consequences of conscription for the Congo-Ocean railroad. He exposed the continuing atrocities committed against Central Africans in Western Ubangi-Shari by such employers as the Forestry Company of Sangha-Ubangi. In 1928, a major insurrection, the [[Kongo-Wara rebellion]] or 'war of the hoe handle', broke out in Western Ubangi-Shari and continued for several years. The extent of this insurrection, which was perhaps the largest anti-colonial rebellion in Africa during the interwar years, was carefully hidden from the French public because it provided evidence of strong opposition to French colonial rule and forced labor.

During the 1930s, [[cotton]], [[tea]], and [[coffee]] emerged as important cash crops in Ubangi-Shari and the mining of [[diamond]]s and [[gold]] began in earnest. Several cotton companies were granted purchasing [[Monopoly|monopolies]] over large areas of cotton production and were able to fix the prices paid to cultivators, which assured profits for their shareholders. In September 1940, during the [[Second World War]], [[Charles de Gaulle|pro-Gaullist]] French officers took control of Ubangi-Shari.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/102152/Central-African-Republic/40700/The-colonial-era Central African Republic: The colonial era – Britannica Online Encyclopedia]. Britannica.com. Retrieved on 6 April 2013.</ref>

=== Decolonization (1940–1960)===
In August 1940, the territory responded, with the rest of the AEF, to the call from General [[Charles de Gaulle]] to fight for [[Free France]]. After World War II, the [[French Constitution]] of 1946 inaugurated the first of a series of reforms that led eventually to complete independence for all French territories in western and equatorial Africa. In 1946, all AEF inhabitants were granted French citizenship and allowed to establish local assemblies. The assembly in CAR was led by [[Barthélemy Boganda]], a Catholic priest who also was known for his forthright statements in the French Assembly on the need for African emancipation. In 1956 French legislation eliminated certain voting inequalities and provided for the creation of some organs of self-government in each territory.

The French constitutional referendum of September 1958 dissolved the AEF, and on 1 December of the same year the Assembly declared the birth of the autonomous Central African Republic with Boganda as head of government. Boganda ruled until his death in a plane crash on 29 March 1959. His cousin, [[David Dacko]], replaced him as head of Government. On 12 July 1960 France agreed to the Central African Republic becoming fully independent.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F00D1FFA3D581A7A93C1A8178CD85F448685F9 | work=The New York Times | first=W.

== Independence ==

===Bokassa coup===
{{main|Saint-Sylvestre coup d'état}}
On 1 January 1966, following a swift and almost bloodless overnight coup, Colonel [[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]] assumed power as president of the Republic. Bokassa abolished the constitution of 1959, dissolved the National Assembly, and issued a decree that placed all legislative and executive powers in the hands of the president. On 4 December 1976, the republic became a monarchy –&nbsp;the [[Central African Empire]]&nbsp;– with the promulgation of the imperial constitution and the proclamation of the president as Emperor Bokassa I. His regime was characterized by numerous human rights atrocities. After his overthrow Bokassa returned unexpectedly in October 1986 and on 12 June 1987, he was convicted of having ordered the murders of at least 20 prisoners and the arrest of the schoolchildren who were murdered. He was sentenced to death, but this was commuted to a life term in February 1988. He was released from prison on 1 September 1993, as a result of an amnesty and died of a heart attack in [[Bangui]] on 3 November 1996 at age 75.

===Dacko counter-coup===
<!--Linked from [[Template:History of the Central African Republic]]-->
On 20 September 1979, Dacko, with French support, led a bloodless coup that overthrew Bokassa while he was out of the country. The republic was restored, and Bokassa, who took refuge in [[Ivory Coast]] and France, was sentenced to death in absentia for various crimes, including [[cannibalism]]. Moreover, an African judicial commission reported that he had "almost certainly" taken part in the massacre of some 100 children for refusing to wear the compulsory school uniforms. In January 1981, six of his supporters, including two sons-in-law, were executed.

===Kolingba's Coup and Rule===
<!--Linked from [[Template:History of the Central African Republic]]-->
Dacko's efforts to promote economic and political reforms proved ineffectual, and on 20 September 1981, he in turn was overthrown in a bloodless coup by General [[André Kolingba]]. For four years, Kolingba led the country as head of the Military Committee for National Recovery (CRMN).

Kolingba suspended the constitution and ruled with a military junta until 1985. In 1985, the CRMN was dissolved, and Kolingba named a new cabinet with increased civilian participation, signaling the start of a return to civilian rule. The process of democratization quickened in 1986 with the creation of a new political party, the Rassemblement Démocratique Centrafricain (RDC), and the drafting of a new constitution that subsequently was ratified in a national referendum. General Kolingba was sworn in as constitutional President on 29 November 1986. The constitution established a National Assembly made up of 52 elected deputies, elected in July 1987 and municipal elections were held in 1988. Kolingba's two major political opponents, Abel Goumba and [[Ange-Félix Patassé]], boycotted these elections because their parties were not allowed to participate.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Pro-Democracy Movement===
By 1990, inspired by the fall of the Berlin Wall, a pro-democracy movement became very active. In May 1990, a letter signed by 253 prominent citizens asked for the convocation of a National Conference, but Kolingba refused this request and instead detained several opponents. Pressure from the United States, France, and from a group of locally represented countries and agencies called GIBAFOR (France, the USA, Germany, Japan, the EU, the World Bank, and the UN) finally led Kolingba to agree, in principle, to hold free elections in October 1992 with help from the UN Office of Electoral Affairs.

After using the excuse of alleged irregularities to suspend the results of the elections as a pretext for holding on to power, President Kolingba came under intense pressure from GIBAFOR to establish a "Conseil National Politique Provisoire de la République" (Provisional National Political Council, CNPPR) and to set up a "Mixed Electoral Commission", which included representatives from all political parties.

When elections were finally held in 1993, again with the help of the international community, Ange-Félix Patassé led in the first round and Kolingba came in fourth behind Abel Goumba and David Dacko. In the second round, Patassé won 53% of the vote while Goumba won 45.6%. Most of Patassé's support came from Gbaya, Kare, and Kaba voters in seven heavily populated prefectures in the northwest while Goumba's support came largely from ten less-populated prefectures in the south and east. Furthermore, Patassé's party, the ''Mouvement pour la Libération du Peuple Centrafricain'' (MLPC) or Movement for the Liberation of the Central African People, gained a simple but not an absolute majority of seats in parliament, which meant Patassé's party required coalition partners.

==== Patassé Government (1993–2003) ====
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
Patassé relieved former President Kolingba of his military rank of general in March 1994 and then charged several former ministers with various crimes. Patassé also removed many [[Yakoma people|Yakoma]] from important, lucrative posts in the government. Two hundred predominantly Yakoma members of the presidential guard were also dismissed or reassigned to the army. Kolingba's RDC loudly proclaimed that Patassé's government was conducting a "witch hunt" against the Yakoma.

A new constitution was approved on 28 December 1994 and promulgated on 14 January 1995, but this constitution, like those before it, did not have much impact on the country's politics. In 1996–1997, reflecting steadily decreasing public confidence in the government's erratic behaviour, three mutinies against Patassé's administration were accompanied by widespread destruction of property and heightened ethnic tension. On 25 January 1997, the [[Bangui Agreements]], which provided for the deployment of an inter-African military mission, the ''Mission Interafricaine de Surveillance des Accords de Bangui'' (MISAB), were signed. Mali's former president, [[Amadou Toumani Touré|Amadou Touré]], served as chief mediator and brokered the entry of ex-mutineers into the government on 7 April 1997. The MISAB mission was later replaced by a U.N. peacekeeping force, the ''Mission des Nations Unies en RCA'' ([[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1159|MINURCA]]).

[[File:Rebel in northern Central African Republic 04.jpg|thumb|Rebel in northern Central African Republic]]
In 1998, parliamentary elections resulted in Kolingba's RDC winning 20 out of 109 seats, constituting a comeback. However, in 1999, in spite of widespread public anger in urban centers over his corrupt rule, Patassé won free elections to become president for a second term.

On 28 May 2001, rebels stormed strategic buildings in Bangui in an unsuccessful coup attempt. The army chief of staff, Abel Abrou, and General François N'Djadder Bedaya were killed, but Patassé regained the upper hand by bringing in at least 300 troops of the rebel leader [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]] (from across the river in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]) and by Libyan soldiers.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In the aftermath of the failed [[Coup d'état|coup]], militias loyal to Patassé sought revenge against rebels in many neighborhoods of the capital, Bangui, and incited unrest which resulted in the destruction of many homes as well as the torture and murder of many opponents. Eventually, Patassé came to suspect that General [[François Bozizé]] was involved in another coup attempt against him, which led Bozizé  to flee with loyal troops to Chad. In March 2003, Bozizé launched a surprise attack against Patassé, who was out of the country. Libyan troops and some 1,000 soldiers of Bemba's Congolese rebel organization failed to stop the rebels, who took control of the country and thus succeeded in overthrowing Patassé. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===Bozizé coup and rule===
On 15 March 2003, while Patassé was abroad, rebels moved into Bangui and installed their commander, General [[François Bozizé]], as president. Bozizé has since been elected President in an election considered by observers to be fair and free.

Patassé has been found guilty of major crimes in Bangui and CAR has brought a case to the International Criminal Court against him and Jean Pierre Bemba from the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo accusing them both of multiple crimes in suppressing one of the mutinies against Patasse. Civil tranquillity has yet to be established and parts of the country remain out of government control. The UN continues to maintain a peace building mission in Bangui.

Despite these shortcomings, and his promise to step down at the end of the transition, Bozizé contested the 13 March 2005 presidential elections in which all of the leading opposition candidates were allowed to run except for Patassé. Bozizé won on the second run-off round on 8 May 2005, defeating [[Martin Ziguélé]], who ran on the ticket of the MLPC, the former ruling party. The National Elections Commission declared Bozizé the winner with 64.6 percent of the vote to 35.4 percent for Ziguélé. The election was generally considered to be fair, although the absence of Patassé cast a shadow over the legitimacy of the process.

After Bozizé seized power in 2003, the [[Central African Republic Bush War]] began with the rebellion by the [[Union of Democratic Forces for Unity]] (UFDR), led by [[Michel Djotodia]].<ref>{{Cite news |first=Stephanie |last=Hancock |url=http://reliefweb.int/report/central-african-republic/feature-bush-war-leaves-central-african-villages-deserted |title=Feature&nbsp;- Bush war leaves Central African villages deserted |publisher=[[ReliefWeb]] |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=30 August 2007 |accessdate=2012-12-26}}</ref> This quickly escalated into major fighting during 2004.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4035239.stm |title=Raid on CAR town 'leaves 20 dead' |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=23 December 2004 |accessdate=2012-12-26}}</ref> The UFDR rebel forces consisted of three allies, the ''Groupe d'action patriotique pour la liberation de Centrafrique'' (GAPLC), the [[Convention of Patriots for Justice and Peace]] (CPJP), the [[People's Army for the Restoration of Democracy (CAR)|People's Army for the Restoration of Democracy]] (APRD), the [[Movement of Central African Liberators for Justice]] (MLCJ), and the ''Front démocratique Centrafricain'' (FDC).<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200611020004.html |title=Central African Republic: Rebels Call for Dialogue After Capturing Key Town |publisher=[[AllAfrica.com]] |agency=[[IRIN]] |date=2 November 2006 |accessdate=2012-12-26}}</ref>

On 8 May 2005, Bozizé gained yet a further victory when his coalition, Convergence [[Kwa Na Kwa]], won 42 parliamentary seats in the legislative run-off vote. The MLPC came in second with 11 seats while the RDC won only eight seats. The remaining seats were won by independents or by smaller parties. In June later that year, the [[African Union]] (AU) lifted sanctions against the country, which had been applied after the 2003 coup.

In early 2006, Bozizé's government appeared stable. However, Patassé, who was living in exile in [[Togo]], could not be ruled out as a leader of a future uprising. His supporters reportedly were joining or were prepared to join rebel movements in belief that their leader was still the rightful head of state of the country. Further, members of Kolingba's [[Yakoma people|Yakoma]] tribe in the south posed a potential threat to Bozizé's government because of their widespread boycott of the second round of the legislative elections. Members of the Yakoma dominate the army.

On 13 April 2007, a peace agreement between the government and the UFDR was signed in Birao. The agreement provided for an amnesty for the UFDR, its recognition as a political party, and the integration of its fighters into the army.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200611130081.html |title=Central African Republic: Concern As Civilians Flee, Government Denies Rebel Capture of Third Town |publisher=[[AllAfrica.com]] |agency=[[IRIN]] |date=13 November 2006 |accessdate=2012-12-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-04-13-central-africa_N.htm |title=Central African Republic, rebels sign peace deal |work=[[USA Today]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=13 April 2007 |accessdate=2012-12-26}}</ref> Further negotiations resulted in an agreement in 2008 for reconciliation, a unity government, and local elections in 2009 and parliamentary and presidential elections in 2010.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2009/01/20/2003434210 |title=CAR president dissolves government, vows unity |work=[[Taipei Times]] |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=20 January 2009 |accessdate=2012-12-26}}</ref> The new unity government that resulted was formed in January 2009.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iDaBqt-PZaqJ6IPUfGowi9_x95Ag |title=Touadera names rebels in new Central African Republic govt |publisher=[[Google News]] |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=19 January 2009 |accessdate=2012-12-26}}</ref>
