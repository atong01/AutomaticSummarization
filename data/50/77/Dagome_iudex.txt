'''''Dagome iudex''''' is one of the earliest historical documents relating to [[Poland]].  Poland is not mentioned by name, but reference is made to ''Dagome'' and ''Ote'' ([[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]] and his wife, [[Oda von Haldensleben]]) and their sons in 991, placing their land (called "Schinesghe") under the protection of the [[Apostolic See]]. The document's name derives from its opening words.

==Nature and import of the ''Dagome iudex''==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}
The ''Dagome iudex'' survives only in the form of a summary, completed c. 1080. It was found in a register compiled by a [[Roman Curia|curial]] 
[[Catholic Cardinal|cardinal]] during the [[Pope|papacy]] of [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]].

Most historians believe that the word ''"Dagome"'' is a melding of two names:  the Christian ''"Dago,"'' for "[[Dagobert]]" (Mieszko's hypothetical baptismal name), and the Slavic ''"Me,"'' for "Mieszko."  The [[Latin]] word ''"iudex"'' ("judge") would be used in the meaning of "prince." Another interpretation is that ''"Dagome iudex"'' is a corruption of ''"Ego Mesco dux"'' ("I, Prince Mieszko"). In the Vatican copy the e of Dagome might have an ''s adscriptum'' (similar to [[cedilla]]), though just the Vatican copyist read ''iudex'' literally, relating it to [[Sardinia]] and its four "judges". 
 
Place names are misspelled by the person who made the summary.  He was also apparently unaware that the document related to territory later called Poland.

The boundaries of the "[[Gniezno]]" state are described as extending to the "Long Sea" (the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]), [[Prussia]], [[Rus' people|Rus']], [[Kraków]], [[Moravia]] and the [[Oder River]]. [[Lesser Poland]] is taken account by the mention of its capital, [[Kraków]] ("craccoa"). Between ''alemura'', probably [[Olomouc]], and [[Upper Lusatia]] region of the [[Milceni]] (''terra mileze'') <ref>When Lusatia came in sight of medieval writers, the [[Lusici]] lived only in [[Lower Lusatia]], the [[Milceni]] in [[Upper Lusatia]]. Later on, the term ''Lusatia'' (Lausitz, Lužice) was spread to the south. Therefore, nowaday's term [[Lusatian Mountains]] does not totally fit with the history of settlemens.</ref> the border could include [[Silesia]] if it was straight.

The text seems to use ''ciuitas schinesghe''  as a synonyme of [[Greater Poland]]. Otherwise, the description of the boundaries would be rather more logical, if ''schenisghe'' meant the city of [[Szczecin]]. Of other regions and places in Mieszko's territory, it mentions only [[Kraków]] and [[Lusatia]], both without ''fines'' (border). Regions outside Mieszko's rule, ''pruzze'' ([[Prussia]]) and ''russe'' ([[Russia]]), are mentioned with the word ''fines''.

The ''Dagome iudex'' is of capital importance for [[History of Poland|Polish history]] in giving a general description of the future Polish state in that period.  It, however, leaves unanswered many questions.  First, it does not explain ''why'' [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]] placed his state under the protection of the Pope.  Also, it is unclear why the document does not mention Mieszko's eldest son, [[Bolesław I the Brave]].  Mentioned instead are his sons by his second wife, Oda. No mention is made of the third son from that marriage, [[Świętopełk]], either." Finally, Mieszko I is not referred to as "''Dagome''" in any other document.

Historians suppose that Bolesław's absence from the document might be explained by an old Slavic custom whereby children received their inheritance as soon as they reached the [[age of majority]]. Thus [[Bolesław I the Brave|Bolesław the Brave]] might have received [[Kraków]] as his part of his father's legacy before the ''Dagome iudex'' had been written.

==Text of the ''Dagome iudex''==
* In the Latin:
:''Item in alio tomo sub Iohanne XV papa Dagome iudex et Ote senatrix et filii eorum: Misicam et Lambertus - nescio cuius gentis homines, puto autem Sardos fuisse, quoniam ipsi a IIII iudicibus reguntur - leguntur beato Petro contulisse unam civitatem in integro, que vocatur Schinesghe, cum omnibus suis pertinentiis infra hos affines, sicuti incipit a primo latere longum mare, fine Bruzze usque in locum, qui dicitur Russe et fines Russe extendente usque in Craccoa et ab ipsa Craccoa usque ad flumen Oddere recte in locum, qui dicitur Alemure, et ab ipsa Alemura usque in terram Milze recte intra Oddere et exinde ducente iuxta flumen Oddera usque in predictam civitatem Schinesghe.''
*In English translation:
:"Also in another volume from the times of [[Pope John XV]], Dagome,<ref>"Dagome" is commonly identified as [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]]. However, the question remains open whether this was a misspelling or his Christian name. If the latter, it might correspond to the names "[[Dago (name)|Dago]]", "[[Dagon]]" or "[[Dagobert]]".</ref> lord,<ref>In classical Latin, the term ''iudex'' was used to refer to "a person who is ordered to do some work on behalf of others" and was identical in meaning to the Byzantine ''[[archont]]''. However, in mediaeval Latin ''iudex'' could also mean a sovereign ruler. Princes of [[Slavs|Slavic]] tribes were sometimes referred to as ''iudices''.  Nevertheless,  some historians claim that this was a misspelling of the Latin ''[[dux]]'' ("duke" or "prince").</ref> and [[Oda von Haldensleben|Ote]], lady,<ref>Literally, "lady-senator".  Cf.
