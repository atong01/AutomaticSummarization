As with other wartime armored cars, their reconnaissance roles emphasized greater speed and stealth than a tracked vehicle could provide, so their limited armor, armament and off-road capabilities were seen as acceptable compromises.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Military use</heading><paragraph><template><target>Unreferenced section</target><arg name="date">April 2015</arg></template><template><target>See also</target><arg>List of military armored cars</arg></template><link><target>File:White M3A1.jpeg</target><part>thumb</part><part>A preserved, World War 2, American<space/><link><target>M3 Scout Car</target></link></part></link>A military armored car is a type of<space/><link><target>armored fighting vehicle</target></link><space/>having<space/><link><target>wheel</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>(from four to ten large, off-road wheels) instead of<space/><link><target>Caterpillar track</target><part>tracks</part></link>, and usually light<space/><link><target>vehicle armor</target><part>armor</part></link>. Armored cars are typically less expensive and on roads have better speed and range than tracked military vehicles. They do however have less mobility as they have less off-road capabilities because of the higher ground pressure. They also have less obstacle climbing capabilities than tracked vehicles. Wheels are more vulnerable to enemy fire than tracks, they have a higher signature and in most cases less armor than comparable tracked vehicles. As a result, they are not intended for heavy fighting; their normal use is for<space/><link><target>reconnaissance</target></link>, command, control, and communications, or for use against lightly armed insurgents or rioters. Only some are intended to enter close combat, often accompanying convoys to protect soft-skinned vehicles.</paragraph><paragraph>Light armored cars, such as the British<space/><link><target>Ferret armoured car</target><part>Ferret</part></link><space/>are armed with just a machine gun. Heavier vehicles are armed with<space/><link><target>autocannon</target></link><space/>or a small tank gun. The heaviest armored cars, such as the German, World War II era<space/><link><target>SdKfz 234</target></link><space/>or the modern, US<space/><link><target>M1128 Mobile Gun System</target></link>, mount the same guns that arm medium tanks.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Image:DanishResistanceAC2795.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part></part><part>Vehicle built by railway shop workers for the<space/><link><target>Danish resistance movement</target></link>, near the end of World War 2</part></link>Armored cars are popular for peacekeeping or internal security duties. Their appearance is less confrontational and threatening than tanks, and their size and maneuverability is said to be more compatible with tight urban spaces designed for wheeled vehicles. However they do have a larger turning radius compared to tracked vehicles which can turn on the spot and their tires are vulnerable and are less capable in climbing and crushing obstacles. However, when there is true combat they are easily outgunned and lightly armored. The threatening appearance of a tank is often enough to keep an opponent from attacking, whereas a less threatening vehicle such as an armored car is more likely to be attacked.</paragraph><paragraph>Many modern forces now have their dedicated armored car designs, to exploit the advantages noted above.
