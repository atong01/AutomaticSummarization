For example, thousands of shareholders of a public company may have losses too small to justify separate lawsuits, but a class action can be brought efficiently on behalf of all shareholders. Perhaps even more important than compensation is that class treatment of claims may be the only way to impose the costs of wrongdoing on the wrongdoer, thus deterring future wrongdoing.</paragraph><paragraph>Third, class action cases may be brought to purposely change behavior of a class of which the defendant is a member.<space/><link><target>Landeros v.

See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1)(A). For example, a court might certify a case for class treatment where a number of individual bond-holders sue to determine whether they may convert their<space/><link><target>Bond (finance)</target><part>bonds</part></link><space/>to<space/><link><target>common stock</target></link>.

Examples cited for this include large fees for the attorneys, while leaving class members with coupons or other awards of little or no value; unjustified awards are made to certain plaintiffs at the expense of other class members; and confusing notices are published that prevent class members from being able to fully understand and effectively exercise their rights.</paragraph><paragraph>For example, in the United States, class lawsuits sometimes bind all class members with a low<space/><link><target>settlement (law)</target><part>settlement</part></link>. These &quot;<link><target>coupon settlement</target><trail>s</trail></link>&quot; (which usually allow the plaintiffs to receive a small benefit such as a small check or a coupon for future services or products with the defendant company) are a way for a defendant to forestall major liability by precluding a large number of people from litigating their claims separately, to recover reasonable compensation for the damages. However, existing law requires judicial approval of all class action settlements, and in most cases class members are given a chance to opt out of class settlement, though class members, despite opt-out notices, may be unaware of their right to opt out because they did not receive the notice, did not read it, or did not understand it.</paragraph><paragraph>The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 addresses these concerns. Coupon settlements may be scrutinized by an independent expert before judicial approval in order to ensure that the settlement will be of value to the class members (28 U.S.C.A. 1712(d)). Further, if the action provides for settlement in coupons, &quot;the portion of any attorneys fee award to class counsel that is attributable to the award of the coupons shall be based on the value to class members of the coupons that are redeemed.&quot; 28 U.S.C.A. 1712(a).</paragraph><heading level='2'>Ethics</heading><paragraph>Class action cases present significant ethical challenges. Defendants can hold reverse auctions and any of several parties can engage in collusive settlement discussions. Subclasses may have interests that diverge greatly from the class, but may be treated the same. Proposed settlements could offer some groups (such as former customers) much greater benefits than others. In one paper presented at an ABA conference on class actions in 2007, authors commented that &quot;competing cases can also provide opportunities for collusive settlement discussions and reverse auctions by defendants anxious to resolve their new exposure at the most economic cost.&quot;<space/><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.jamesholmeslaw.com/Seminar%20paper.pdf<space/></arg><arg name="title">Ethical Issues In Class Action Settlements<space/></arg><arg name="format">PDF<space/></arg><arg name="date"><space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2013-10-03</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Defendant class action</heading><paragraph>Although normally plaintiffs are the class, defendant class actions are also possible.

Not every plaintiff looks for, or could obtain, such approval. As a procedural alternative, plaintiff's counsel may attempt to sign up every similarly-situated person that counsel can find as a client. Plaintiff's counsel can then join the claims of all of these persons in one complaint, a so-called &quot;mass action&quot;, hoping to have the same efficiencies and economic leverage as if a class had been certified.</paragraph><paragraph>Because mass actions operate outside the detailed procedures laid out for class actions, they can pose special difficulties for both plaintiffs, defendants, and the court. For example, settlement of class actions follows a predictable path of negotiation with class counsel and representatives, court scrutiny, and notice. There may not be a way to uniformly settle all of the many claims brought via a mass action. Some states permit plaintiff's counsel to settle for all the mass action plaintiffs according to a majority vote, for example. Other states, such as New Jersey, require each plaintiff to approve the settlement of that plaintiff's own individual claims.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Class actions outside the United States</heading><heading level='3'>Argentina</heading><paragraph>Class actions were recognized in &quot;Halabi&quot; leading case (<link><target>Supreme Court of Argentina</target><part>Supreme Court</part></link>, 2009).</paragraph><heading level='3'>Australia and New Zealand</heading><paragraph>Class actions became part of the Australian legal landscape only when the Federal Parliament amended the Federal Court of Australia Act1 (&quot;the FCAA&quot;) in 1992 to introduce the &quot;representative proceedings&quot;, the equivalent of the American &quot;class actions&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="title">Class Actions in Australia - An Overnew<space/></arg><arg name="url">https://www.claytonutz.com/docs/Class%20Actions_Aug04.pdf<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2 October 2015<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Clayton Utz<space/></arg><arg name="author">Stuart Clark and Colin Loveday<space/></arg><arg name="date">2004</arg></template></extension><space/>Likewise, class actions appeared slowly in New Zealand legal system.

However, Austrian consumer organizations (Verein fr Konsumenteninformation/VKI and the Federal Chamber of Labour/Bundesarbeitskammer) have, in recent years, brought claims on behalf of hundreds or even thousands of consumers. In these cases the individual consumers assigned their claims to one entity, who has then brought an ordinary (two party) lawsuit over the assigned claims. The monetary benefits were redistributed among the class. This technique, soon labelled as class action Austrian style, allows for a significant reduction of overall costs. The Austrian Supreme Court, in a recent judgment, has confirmed the legal admissibility of these lawsuits under the condition that all claims are essentially based on the same grounds.</paragraph><paragraph>The Austrian Parliament has unanimously requested the Austrian Federal Minister for Justice to examine the possibility of new legislation providing for a cost-effective and appropriate way to deal with mass claims. Together with the Austrian Ministry for Social Security, Generations and Consumer Protection, the Justice Ministry opened the discussion with a conference held in Vienna in June, 2005.

The injured parties have an opt-out right during the opt-out period set by the Court, usually 3 to 6 months. Interestingly, settlements involving injured parties from outside The Netherlands can also be declared binding by the Court. Notably since US courts are reluctant to take up class actions brought on behalf of injured parties not residing in the US who have suffered damages due to acts or omissions committed outside the US, it may be interesting to combine a US class action and a Dutch collective action to be able to come to a settlement that covers plaintiffs worldwide.
