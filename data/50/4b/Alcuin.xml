It had been founded by the king's ancestors as a place for the education of the royal children (mostly in manners and the ways of the court). However, Charlemagne wanted to include the<space/><link><target>liberal arts</target></link><space/>and, most importantly, the study of the religion.

Bringing with him from York his assistants Pyttel, Sigewulf, and Joseph, Alcuin revolutionised the educational standards of the Palace School, introducing Charlemagne to the liberal arts and creating a personalised atmosphere of scholarship and learning, to the extent that the institution came to be known as the 'school of Master Albinus'.</paragraph><paragraph>In this role as adviser, he tackled the emperor over his policy of forcing pagans to be baptised on pain of death, arguing, &quot;Faith is a free act of the will, not a forced act. We must appeal to the conscience, not compel it by violence. You can force people to be baptised, but you cannot force them to believe.&quot; His arguments seem to have prevailed Charlemagne abolished the death penalty for paganism in 797.<extension extension_name='ref'>Needham, Dr. N.R.,<space/><italics>Two Thousand Years of Christ's Power, Part Two: The Middle Ages</italics>, Grace Publications, 2000, page 52.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Charlemagne was a master at gathering the best men of every land in his court.
