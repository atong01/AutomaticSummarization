[[Motorola]]/[[Freescale Semiconductor]]'s '''DragonBall''', or '''MC68328''', is a [[microcontroller]] design based on the famous [[Motorola 68k|68000]] core, but implemented as an all-in-one low-power system for [[handheld computer]] use. It is supported by [[Î¼Clinux]]. It was designed by Motorola in [[Hong Kong]] and released in 1995.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://pdadb.net/index.php?m=cpu&id=c68328&c=motorola_dragonball_mc68328 | title=Motorola DragonBall MC68328 CISC SoC | accessdate=2010-01-27 | publisher=PDAdb.net}}</ref>

The DragonBall's major design win was in earlier versions of the [[Palm Computing]] platform; however, from [[Palm OS]] 5 onwards it has been superseded by [[ARM architecture|ARM]]-based processors from [[Texas Instruments]] and [[Intel]]. The processor is also used in some of the [[AlphaSmart]] line of portable [[word processor]]s. Examples include the Dana and Dana Wireless.[[Image:FreeScale DragonBall MX-1 Processor (BGA).jpg|thumb|left|Freescale DragonBall MX-1 Microprocessor (BGA Package)]]

The processor is capable of speeds of up to 16.58&nbsp;[[MHz]] and can run up to 2.7 MIPS ([[Instructions per second#Million instructions per second|million instructions per second]]), for the base 68328 and '''DragonBall EZ''' (MC68EZ328) model. It was extended to 33&nbsp;MHz, 5.4 MIPS for the '''DragonBall VZ''' (MC68VZ328) model,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://pdadb.net/index.php?m=cpu&id=c68328vz&c=motorola_dragonball_vz_mc68vz328 | title=Motorola DragonBall MC68VZ328 CISC SoC | accessdate=2012-09-25 | publisher=PDAdb.net}}</ref> and 66&nbsp;MHz, 10.8 MIPS for the '''DragonBall Super VZ''' (MC68SZ328).

It is a 32-bit processor with 32-bit internal and external address bus (24-bit external address bus for EZ and VZ variants) and 32-bit data bus.<ref>[http://pdadb.net/index.php?m=cpu&id=c68328ez&c=motorola_dragonball_ez_mc68ez328 Motorola DragonBall EZ MC68EZ328 CISC SoC]</ref> It has many built-in functions, like a color and grayscale display controller, [[PC speaker]] sound, serial port with UART and IRDA support, UART bootstrap, real time clock, is able to directly access DRAM, Flash ROM, and mask ROM, and has built-in support for touch screens.

It is an [[System on chip|all-in-one computer on a chip]]; before the DragonBall EZ, Palm handhelds had twice as many ICs.

The more recent '''DragonBall MX''' series microcontrollers, later renamed the Freescale [[i.MX]] (MC9328MX/MCIMX) series, are intended for similar application to the earlier DragonBall devices but are based on an [[ARM architecture|ARM]]9 or ARM11 processor core instead of a 68000 core.
