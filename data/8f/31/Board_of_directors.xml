In practice, the amount of power exercised by the board varies with the type of company.

In large<space/><link><target>public company</target><part>public companies</part></link>, the board tends to exercise more of a supervisory role, and individual responsibility and management tends to be delegated downward to individual professional executives (such as a finance director or a marketing director) who deal with particular areas of the company's affairs.<extension extension_name='ref' name="CRI"><link type='external' href='http://www.compensationresources.com/titles-associated-with-executive-compensation.php'>Titles Associated with Executive Compensation</link>| Compensation Resources Inc.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Another feature of boards of directors in large public companies is that the board tends to have more<space/><link><target>de facto</target></link><space/>power. Many shareholders grant proxies to the directors to vote their shares at general meetings and accept all recommendations of the board rather than try to get involved in management, since each shareholder's power, as well as interest and information is so small. Larger institutional investors also grant the board proxies. The large number of shareholders also makes it hard for them to organize.

As a practical matter, executives even choose the directors, with shareholders normally following management recommendations and voting for them.</paragraph><paragraph>In most cases, serving on a board is not a<space/><link><target>career</target></link><space/>unto itself, but board members often receive remunerations amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars per year since they often sit on the boards of several companies. Inside directors are usually not paid for sitting on a board, but the duty is instead considered part of their larger job description. Outside directors are usually paid for their services. These remunerations vary between corporations, but usually consist of a yearly or monthly salary, additional compensation for each meeting attended, stock options, and various other benefits.<space/><link><target>Tiffany &amp; Co.</target></link>, for example, pays directors an annual retainer of $46,500, an additional annual retainer of $2,500 if the director is also a chairperson of a committee, a per-meeting-attended fee of $2,000 for meetings attended in person, a $500 fee for each meeting attended via telephone, in addition to stock options and retirement benefits.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://beginnersinvest.about.com/cs/a/aa2203a_2.htm'>Fees, CEO Evaluation, and Ownership Structure</link><space/>By Joshua Kennon, About.com</extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Two-tier system</heading><paragraph>In some European and<space/><link><target>Asia</target><trail>n</trail></link><space/>countries, there are two separate boards, an executive board for day-to-day business and a<space/><link><target>supervisory board</target></link><space/>(elected by the shareholders and employees) for supervising the executive board. In these countries, the CEO (chief executive or managing director) presides over the executive board and the chairman presides over the supervisory board, and these two roles will always be held by different people. This ensures a distinction between<space/><link><target>management</target></link><space/>by the executive board and<space/><link><target>governance</target></link><space/>by the supervisory board and allows for clear lines of authority. The aim is to prevent a<space/><link><target>conflict of interest</target></link><space/>and too much power being concentrated in the hands of one person. There is a strong parallel here with the structure of government, which tends to separate the political<space/><link><target>Cabinet (government)</target><part>cabinet</part></link><space/>from the management<space/><link><target>civil service</target></link>. In the United States, the board of directors (elected by the shareholders) is often equivalent to the supervisory board, while the executive board may often be known as the executive committee (operating committee or executive council), composed of the CEO and their direct reports (other C-level officers, division/subsidiary heads).</paragraph><heading level='3'>History</heading><paragraph>The development of a separate board of directors to manage the company has occurred incrementally and indefinitely over legal history. Until the end of the 19th century, it seems to have been generally assumed that the general meeting (of all shareholders) was the supreme organ of the company, and the board of directors was merely an agent of the company subject to the control of the shareholders in general meeting.<extension extension_name='ref'>Gower,<space/><italics>Principles of Company Law</italics><space/>(6th ed.), citing<space/><italics><link><target>Isle of Wight Railway v Tahourdin</target></link></italics><space/>(1883) 25 Ch D 320.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>However, by 1906, the<space/><link><target>Court of Appeal of England and Wales</target><part>English Court of Appeal</part></link><space/>had made it clear in the decision of<space/><italics><link><target>Automatic Self-Cleansing Filter Syndicate Co Ltd v Cuninghame</target></link></italics><space/>[1906] 2 Ch 34 that the division of powers between the board and the shareholders in general meaning depended on the construction of the<space/><link><target>Articles of Association (law)</target><part>articles of association</part></link><space/>and that, where the powers of management were vested in the board, the general meeting could not interfere with their lawful exercise.

Under English law, successive versions of<space/><link><target>Table A</target></link><space/>have reinforced the norm that, unless the directors are acting contrary to the law or the provisions of the Articles, the powers of conducting the management and affairs of the company are vested in them.</paragraph><paragraph>The modern doctrine was expressed in<space/><italics><link><target>John Shaw &amp; Sons (Salford) Ltd v Shaw</target></link></italics><space/>[1935] 2 KB 113 by<space/><link><target>Frederick Greer, 1st Baron Fairfield</target><part>Greer LJ</part></link><space/>as follows:</paragraph><paragraph><extension extension_name='blockquote'>A company is an entity distinct alike from its shareholders and its directors. Some of its powers may, according to its articles, be exercised by directors, certain other powers may be reserved for the shareholders in general meeting. If powers of management are vested in the directors, they and they alone can exercise these powers. The only way in which the general body of shareholders can control the exercise of powers by the articles in the directors is by altering the articles, or, if opportunity arises under the articles, by refusing to re-elect the directors of whose actions they disapprove. They cannot themselves usurp the powers which by the articles are vested in the directors any more than the directors can usurp the powers vested by the articles in the general body of shareholders.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>It has been remarked that this development in the law was somewhat surprising at the time, as the relevant provisions in<space/><link><target>Table A</target></link><space/>(as it was then) seemed to contradict this approach rather than to endorse it.<extension extension_name='ref'>See Gower,<space/><italics>Principles of Company Law</italics><space/>(6th ed.) at 185.</extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Election and removal</heading><paragraph>In most legal systems, the appointment and removal of directors is voted upon by the shareholders in general meeting<extension extension_name='ref'>For example, in the United Kingdom, see section 303 of the Companies Act 1985</extension><space/>or through a<space/><link><target>proxy statement</target></link>.

Most legal systems require sufficient notice to be given to all directors of these meetings, and that a<space/><link><target>quorum</target></link><space/>must be present before any business may be conducted. Usually, a meeting which is held without notice having been given is still valid if all of the directors attend, but it has been held that a failure to give notice may negate resolutions passed at a meeting, because the persuasive oratory of a minority of directors might have persuaded the majority to change their minds and vote otherwise.<extension extension_name='ref'>See for example<space/><italics><link><target>Barber's Case</target></link></italics><space/>(1877) 5 Ch D 963 and<space/><italics><link><target>Re Portuguese Consolidated Copper Mines</target></link></italics><space/>(1889) 42 Ch D 160</extension></paragraph><paragraph>In most<space/><link><target>common law</target></link><space/>countries, the powers of the board are vested in the board as a whole, and not in the individual directors.<extension extension_name='ref'><italics><link><target>Breckland Group Holdings Ltd v London and Suffolk Properties</target></link></italics><space/>[1989] BCLC 100</extension><space/>However, in instances an individual director may still bind the company by his acts by virtue of his<space/><link><target>ostensible authority</target></link><space/>(see also:<space/><link><target>Royal British Bank v Turquand</target><part>the rule in ''Turquand's Case''</part></link>).</paragraph><heading level='3'>Duties</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Directors' duties</arg><arg>Fiduciary duties</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Because directors exercise control and management over the organization, but organizations are (in theory) run for the benefit of the<space/><link><target>shareholder</target><trail>s</trail></link>, the law imposes strict duties on directors in relation to the exercise of their duties.

While in many instances an improper purpose is readily evident, such as a director looking to feather his or her own nest or divert an investment opportunity to a relative, such breaches usually involve a breach of the director's duty to act in good faith. Greater difficulties arise where the director, while acting in good faith, is serving a purpose that is not regarded by the law as proper.</paragraph><paragraph>The seminal authority in relation to what amounts to a proper purpose is the<space/><link><target>Judicial Committee of the Privy Council</target><part>Privy Council</part></link><space/>decision of<space/><italics>Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Ltd</italics><space/>[1974] AC 821.

An argument that the power to issue shares could only be properly exercised to raise new capital was rejected as too narrow, and it was held that it would be a proper exercise of the director's powers to issue shares to a larger company to ensure the financial stability of the company, or as part of an agreement to exploit mineral rights owned by the company.<extension extension_name='ref'><italics>Teck Corporation v Millar</italics><space/>(1972) 33 DLR (3d) 288</extension><space/>If so, the mere fact that an incidental result (even if it was a desired consequence) was that a shareholder lost his majority, or a takeover bid was defeated, this would not itself make the share issue improper.

The law takes the view that good faith must not only be done, but must be manifestly seen to be done, and zealously patrols the conduct of directors in this regard; and will not allow directors to escape liability by asserting that his decision was in fact well founded. Traditionally, the law has divided conflicts of duty and interest into three sub-categories.</paragraph><heading level='5'>Transactions with the company</heading><paragraph>By definition, where a director enters into a transaction with a company, there is a conflict between the director's interest (to do well for himself out of the transaction) and his duty to the company (to ensure that the company gets as much as it can out of the transaction). This rule is so strictly enforced that, even where the<space/><link><target>conflict of interest</target></link><space/>or conflict of duty is purely hypothetical, the directors can be forced to disgorge all personal gains arising from it.

Company A was unable to subscribe for more than 2,000 in shares, so the directors arranged for the remaining 3,000 shares to be taken by themselves and their friends. Later, instead of selling the undertaking, they sold all of the shares in both companies and made a substantial profit.
