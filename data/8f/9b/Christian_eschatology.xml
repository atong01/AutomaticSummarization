[Isa. 26:19]</paragraph><paragraph>This belief was still common among the Jews in New Testament times, as exemplified by the passage which relates the raising of Lazarus from the dead. When Jesus told Lazarus' sister, Martha, that Lazarus would rise again, she replied, &quot;I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.&quot; [Jn 11:24] Also, one of the two main branches of the Jewish religious establishment, the Pharisees, believed in and taught the future resurrection of the body.

Vastly outstripping the expectations of Judaism, this stated omission signals the ultimate reconciliation.</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>Major theological positions</heading><paragraph>There are diverse opinions concerning the thousand years of peace (Millennium) described in Revelation and the events associated with it. Some interpret a literal, future, thousand-year time period in which Christ will rule over the Earth, a time which will be characterized by peace and harmony. Others understand a literal age of peace, but think the &quot;thousand years&quot; is a figure of speech. Still others see the Millennium as symbolic of a spiritual ideal, with no corresponding earthly condition. All of these positions fall into the category of millennialism, a broad term which includes any and all ideas relating to the millennium of Biblical prophecy. The most commonly held viewpoints are usually categorized as follows:</paragraph><heading level='3'>Premillennialism</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Premillennialism</arg></template>Standard premillennialism posits that Christ's second coming will inaugurate a literal thousand-year earthly kingdom. Christ's return will coincide with a time of great tribulation. At this time, there will be a resurrection of the people of God who have died, and a rapture of the people of God who are still living, and they will meet Christ at his coming. A thousand years of peace will follow, during which Christ will reign and Satan will be imprisoned in the Abyss. Those who hold to this view usually fall into one of the following three categories:</paragraph><heading level='4'>Pretribulation Rapture</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Pretribulationism</arg></template>Pretribulationists believe that the second coming will be in two stages separated by a seven-year period of tribulation. At the beginning of the tribulation, true Christians will rise to meet the Lord in the air (the Rapture). Then follows a seven-year period of suffering in which the Antichrist will conquer the world and persecute those who refuse to worship him. At the end of this period, Christ returns to defeat the Antichrist and establish the age of peace. This position is supported by a scripture which says, &quot;God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.&quot; [1 Thess 5:9]</paragraph><heading level='4'>Midtribulation Rapture</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Midtribulationism</arg></template>Midtribulationists believe that the Rapture will take place at the halfway point of the seven-year tribulation, i.e. after 3 years. It coincides with the &quot;abomination of desolation&quot;a desecration of the temple where the Antichrist puts an end to the Jewish sacrifices, sets up his own image in the temple, and demands that he be worshiped as God. This event begins the second, most intense part of the tribulation.</paragraph><paragraph>Some interpreters find support for the &quot;midtrib&quot; position by comparing a passage in Paul's epistles with the book of Revelation. Paul says, &quot;We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed&quot; (1 Cor 15:51-52). Revelation divides the great tribulation into three sets of increasingly catastrophic judgments: the Seven Seals, the Seven Trumpets, and the Seven Bowls, in that order. If the &quot;last trumpet&quot; of Paul is equated with the last trumpet of Revelation, the Rapture would be in the middle of the Tribulation. (Not all interpreters agree with this literal interpretation of the chronology of Revelation, however.)</paragraph><heading level='4'>Posttribulation Rapture</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Post-Tribulation Rapture</arg></template>Posttribulationists hold that Christ will not return until the end of the tribulation. Christians, rather than being raptured at the beginning of the tribulation, or halfway through, will live through it and suffer for their faith during the ascendancy of the Antichrist. Proponents of this position believe that the presence of believers during the tribulation is necessary for a final evangelistic effort during a time when external conditions will combine with the Gospel message to bring great numbers of converts into the Church in time for the beginning of the Millennium.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Postmillennialism</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Postmillennialism</arg></template>Postmillennialism does not believe in a premillennial appearance of Christ. The postmillennial position is that the millennium began at the inauguration of Christ's kingdom reign when he ascended to his heavenly throne and happens, not as a result of the coming of Christ, but as the global population converts to Christianity as a result of evangelization. The age of peace is still a progressing work of divine grace, but without the visible presence of Christ to take the place of an Earthly ruler. Christ will appear at the end of the millennium to lead his people into the heavenly city, the New Jerusalem.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Amillennialism</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Amillennialism</arg></template>Amillennialism does not believe in a literal Millennium. The &quot;thousand years&quot; is an expression, a way of referring to the entire period from the first coming of Christ, two thousand years ago, until the future second coming. Many amillennialists believe that during this time period, the church will continue to evangelize and grow as well as suffer declination in periods until Christ's coming. The Second Coming will be a natural culmination of the process of world evangelization, rather than a revolutionary event that brings sudden and dramatic change.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Interpretive and hermeneutical overviews of the Bible</heading><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>hermeneutic</target></link><space/>method held by an individual or church will greatly affect their interpretation of the book of Revelation, and consequently their eschatological scheme.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Supersessionist</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Supersessionism</arg></template>Supersessionism is the belief that the<space/><link><target>New Covenant</target></link><space/>in Christ supersedes, or replaces, the<space/><link><target>Old Covenant</target></link><space/>with Israel.

One of the main tenets of Dispensationalism is the strict dichotomy that dispensationalists claim exists between Israel and the New Testament Church. This is expressly denied by Covenant Theologians who claim the existence of a relationship via &quot;Spiritual Israel&quot;. A dispensationalist would claim that none of the prophecies pertaining to Israel are or will be fulfilled in or by the New Testament Church. Covenant Theologians would claim that some of the prophecies pertaining to Israel are, will, or may be fulfilled in or by the New Testament Church. see<space/><link><target>supersessionism</target></link>.</paragraph><list type='def'><listitem><defkey>Approaches to Revelation</defkey><defval></defval></listitem></list><list type='bullet'><listitem>Dispensational<space/><link><target>Futurism (Christian eschatology)</target><part>Futurism</part></link><space/>as opposed to Historic or Covenantal Futurism.</listitem><listitem>Dispensational<space/><link><target>Premillennialism</target></link><space/>as opposed to Historic or Covenantal Premillennialism.</listitem></list><heading level='3'>Allegorical or mythical</heading><paragraph><template><target>see also</target><arg>Allegorical interpretation of the Bible</arg></template></paragraph><list type='def'><listitem><defkey>Hermeneutics</defkey><defval></defval></listitem></list><paragraph>The Bible may or may not be factually accurate but is designed to teach spiritual lessons through<space/><link><target>allegory</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>mythology</target><part>myth</part></link>.

Futurism</heading><paragraph>The division between these interpretations can be somewhat blurred. Most futurists are expecting a<space/><link><target>Rapture</target></link><space/>of the Church, an<space/><link><target>Antichrist</target></link>, a<space/><link><target>Great Tribulation</target></link><space/>and a<space/><link><target>Second coming</target></link><space/>of Christ in the near future. But they also accept certain past events, such as the rebirth of the State of<space/><link><target>Israel</target></link><space/>and the reunification of<space/><link><target>Jerusalem</target></link><space/>as prerequisites to them, in a manner which the earlier historicists have done with other dates. Futurists, who do not normally use the<space/><link><target>day-year principle</target></link>, interpret the<space/><link><target>Prophecy of Seventy Weeks</target></link><space/>in Daniel 9:24 as years, just as historicists do. Most historicists have chosen time lines, from beginning to end, entirely in the past.<extension extension_name='ref'>e.g. 312 AD to 1572, 538 AD to 1798, and 606 AD to 1870.

In his commentary on Daniel 8:14 published in 1831, he stated that the 2,300-year period should be calculated from 334 BC, the year<space/><link><target>Alexander the Great</target></link><space/>began his conquest of the Persian Empire.<extension extension_name='ref' name="sacred-texts"><link type='external' href='http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/cmt/clarke/dan.htm'>sacred-texts.com: &quot;Commentary on the Bible&quot; published in 1831.

For example, the year following 1 BC is 1 AD. Thus his calculations should have required an additional year, ending in 1967. He was not anticipating a literal regathering of the Jewish people prior to the<space/><link><target>Second coming</target></link><space/>of Christ.
