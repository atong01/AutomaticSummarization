The '''Violin Sonata No. 5''' in [[F major]], Opus 24, is a [[violin sonata]] by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. It is often known as the "Spring" sonata (Fr√ºhlingssonate), and was published in [[1801 in music|1801]].  Its dedicatee was [[:de:Moritz Reichsgraf von Fries|Count Moritz von Fries]], a patron to whom the [[Violin Sonata No. 4 (Beethoven)|fourth violin sonata]], the [[String Quintet, Op. 29 (Beethoven)|string quintet]] of the same year, and the [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|seventh symphony]] were also dedicated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lvbeethoven.com/Oeuvres/ListOpus.html|title=Beethoven's music with Opus number|website=Ludwig van Beethoven's website|accessdate=18 October 2014}}</ref>

The work is in four movements:

#''[[Allegro (music)|Allegro]]''
#''[[Adagio (music)|Adagio]] molto espressivo''
#''[[Scherzo]]: [[Allegro (music)|Allegro]] molto''
#''[[Rondo]]: [[Allegro (music)|Allegro]] ma non troppo''

The Scherzo and its trio are particularly brief. The entire sonata takes approximately 22 minutes to perform. The "Spring Sonata" was the name given to it after Beethoven died.

The Allegro movement is featured in the stage show [[Fame (musical)|''Fame'']].
