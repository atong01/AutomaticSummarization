This discovery was unequivocal evidence that the universe has changed radically over time (for example, via the<space/><link><target>Big Bang</target></link>).</paragraph><paragraph>Carter defined two forms of the anthropic principle, a &quot;weak&quot; one which referred only to anthropic selection of privileged<space/><link><target>spacetime</target></link><space/>locations in the universe, and a more controversial &quot;strong&quot; form which addressed the values of the<space/><link><target>fundamental constant</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>of physics.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Roger Penrose</target></link><space/>explained the weak form as follows:</paragraph><paragraph><template><target>quote</target><arg>The argument can be used to explain why the conditions happen to be just right for the existence of (intelligent) life on the Earth at the present time. For if they were not just right, then we should not have found ourselves to be here now, but somewhere else, at some other appropriate time. This principle was used very effectively by Brandon Carter and [[Robert Dicke]] to resolve an issue that had puzzled physicists for a good many years. The issue concerned various striking numerical relations that are observed to hold between the physical constants (the [[gravitational constant]], the mass of the [[proton]], the [[age of the universe]], etc.). A puzzling aspect of this was that some of the relations hold only at the present epoch in the Earth's history, so we appear, coincidentally, to be living at a very special time (give or take a few million years!). This was later explained, by Carter and Dicke, by the fact that this epoch coincided with the lifetime of what are called [[main-sequence]] stars, such as the Sun. At any other epoch, so the argument ran, there would be no intelligent life around in order to measure the physical constants in question &mdash; so the coincidence had to hold, simply because there would be [[Sapience|intelligent life]] around only at the particular time that the coincidence did hold!</arg><arg>''[[The Emperor's New Mind]]'', Chapter 10</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>One reason this is plausible is that there are many other places and times in which we can imagine finding ourselves. But when applying the strong principle, we only have one universe, with one set of fundamental parameters, so what exactly is the point being made? Carter offers two possibilities: First, we can use our own existence to make &quot;predictions&quot; about the parameters. But second, &quot;as a last resort&quot;, we can convert these predictions into<space/><italics>explanations</italics><space/>by assuming that there<space/><italics>is</italics><space/>more than one universe, in fact a large and possibly infinite collection of universes, something that is now called the<space/><link><target>multiverse</target></link><space/>(&quot;world ensemble&quot; was Carter's term), in which the parameters (and perhaps the laws of physics) vary across universes. The strong principle then becomes an example of a<space/><link><target>selection effect</target></link>, exactly analogous to the weak principle. Postulating a multiverse is certainly a radical step, but taking it could provide at least a partial answer to a question which had seemed to be out of the reach of normal science: &quot;why do the<space/><link><target>list of laws of science</target><part>fundamental laws of physics</part></link><space/>take the particular form we observe and not another?&quot;</paragraph><paragraph>Since Carter's 1973 paper, the term &quot;anthropic principle&quot; has been extended to cover a number of ideas which differ in important ways from those he espoused.
