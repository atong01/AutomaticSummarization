During early colonial times there were gold exports to Per from<space/><link><target>placer deposit</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>which soon depleted. Trade restrictions and monopolies established by the Spanish crown are credited for having held back economic development for much of the colonial times. As effect of these restrictions the country incorporated very few new crops and animal breeds after initial conquest. Other sectors that were held back by restrictions were the wine and mining industries. The<space/><link><target>Bourbon reforms</target></link><space/>in the 18th century eased many monopolies and trade restrictions.</paragraph><paragraph>In the 1830s Chile consolidated under the ideas of<space/><link><target>Diego Portales</target></link><space/>as a stable state open to foreign trade. Foreign investment in Chile grew over the 19th century. After the<space/><link><target>War of the Pacific</target></link><space/>the Chilean treasury grew by 900%. The<space/><link><target>League of Nations</target></link><space/>labeled Chile the country hardest hit by the<space/><link><target>Great Depression</target></link><space/>because 80% of government revenue came from exports of copper and nitrates, which were in low demand.

The<space/><link><target>crisis of 1982</target></link><space/>caused the appointment of<space/><link><target>Hernn Bchi</target></link><space/>as minister of finance and a sharp revision of economic policy. Despite a general selling of state property and contrary to neoliberal prescriptions, the regime retained the lucrative state owned mining company<space/><link><target>Codelco</target><part>CODELCO</part></link><space/>which stands for about 30% of government income.</paragraph><paragraph>According to the<space/><link><target>CIA World Factbook</target></link>, during the early 1990s, Chile's &quot;reputation as a role model for economic reform&quot; was strengthened when the democratic government of<space/><link><target>Patricio Aylwin</target></link>, who took over from the military in 1990, deepened the economic reform initiated by the military government. Growth in real GDP averaged 8% from 19911997,<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">February 2011</arg></template><space/>but fell to half that level in 1998 because of tight monetary policies (implemented to keep the current account deficit in check) and because of lower export earnings, the latter which was a product of the Asian financial crisis.

Over the last ten years, Chileans have enjoyed the introduction of new financial tools such as home equity loans, currency futures and options, factoring, leasing, and debit cards. The introduction of these new products has also been accompanied by an increased use of traditional instruments such as loans and credit cards.

The income tax revenue comprises different taxes. While there is a corporate income tax of 20% over profits from companies (called First Category Tax), the system is ultimately designed to tax individuals. Therefore, corporate income taxes paid constitute a credit towards two personal income taxes: the Global Complementary Tax (in the case of residents) or the Additional Tax (in the case of non-residents). The Global Complementary Tax is payable by those that have different sources of income, while those receiving income solely from dependent work are subject to the Second Category Tax. Both taxes are equally progressive in statutory terms, with a top marginal rate of 40%. Income arising from corporate activity under the Global Complementary Tax only becomes payable when effectively distributed to the individual. There are also special sales taxes on alcohol and luxury goods, as well as specific taxes on tobacco and fuel. Other taxes include the inheritance tax and custom duties.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.sii.cl/portales/inversionistas/imp_chile/imp_chile_ing.htm</arg><arg name="title">INFORMATION FOR FOREIGN INVESTORS</arg><arg name="publisher"></arg><arg name="accessdate">11 June 2015</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>In 2012, general government expenditure reached 21.5% of GDP, while revenues were equivalent to 22% of GDP.<extension extension_name='ref' name="survey"><link type='external' href='http://dx.doi.prg/10.1787/eco_surveys-chl-2013-en'>OECD (2013), OECD Economic Surveys: Chile 2013.</link><space/>OECD Publishing.</extension><space/>Gross financial debt amounted to 12.2% of GDP, while in net terms it was 6.9% of GDP, both well below OECD averages.<extension extension_name='ref' name="survey"></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Monetary policy</heading><paragraph>Chile's monetary authority is the<space/><link><target>Central Bank of Chile</target></link><space/>(CBoC).
