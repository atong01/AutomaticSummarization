Born in<space/><link><target>Paris</target></link>, Eugene grew up around the French court of King<space/><link><target>Louis XIV of France</target><part>Louis XIV</part></link>. Based on his poor physique and bearing, the Prince was initially prepared for a career in the church, but by the age of 19 he had determined on a military career. Rejected by Louis XIV for service in the French army, Eugene moved to Austria and transferred his loyalty to the<space/><link><target>Habsburg Monarchy</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Spanning six decades, Eugene served three Holy Roman Emperors:<space/><link><target>Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor</target><part>Leopold I</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor</target><part>Joseph I</part></link>, and<space/><link><target>Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor</target><part>Charles VI</part></link>.

However, the Prince's fame was secured with his decisive victory against the Ottomans at the<space/><link><target>Battle of Zenta</target></link><space/>in 1697, earning him Europe-wide fame. Eugene enhanced his standing during the<space/><link><target>War of the Spanish Succession</target></link>, where his partnership with the<space/><link><target>John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough</target><part>Duke of Marlborough</part></link><space/>secured victories against the French on the fields of<space/><link><target>Battle of Blenheim</target><part>Blenheim</part></link><space/>(1704),<space/><link><target>Battle of Oudenarde</target><part>Oudenarde</part></link><space/>(1708), and<space/><link><target>Battle of Malplaquet</target><part>Malplaquet</part></link><space/>(1709); he gained further success in the war as Imperial commander in northern Italy, most notably at the<space/><link><target>Battle of Turin</target></link><space/>(1706). Renewed hostilities against the Ottomans in the<space/><link><target>Austro-Turkish War of 171618</target><part>Austro-Turkish War</part></link><space/>consolidated his reputation, with victories at the battles of<space/><link><target>Battle of Petrovaradin</target><part>Petrovaradin</part></link><space/>(1716), and the<space/><link><target>Siege of Belgrade (1717)</target><part>decisive encounter</part></link><space/>at<space/><link><target>Belgrade</target></link><space/>(1717).</paragraph><paragraph>Throughout the late 1720s, Eugene's influence and skilful diplomacy managed to secure the Emperor powerful allies in his dynastic struggles with the<space/><link><target>House of Bourbon</target><part>Bourbon powers</part></link>, but physically and mentally fragile in his later years, Eugene enjoyed less success as commander-in-chief of the army during his final conflict, the<space/><link><target>War of the Polish Succession</target></link>. Nevertheless, in Austria, Eugene's reputation remains unrivalled. Although opinions differ as to his character, there is no dispute over his great achievements: he helped to save the Habsburg Empire from French conquest; he broke the westward thrust of the Ottomans, liberating central Europe after a century and a half of Turkish occupation; and he was one of the great patrons of the arts whose building legacy can still be seen in Vienna today. Eugene died in his sleep at his home on 21 April 1736, aged 72.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Early life (166399)</heading><heading level='3'>Htel de Soissons</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:StemmaFamiliaeEugeni (English Version).png</target><part>250px</part><part>thumb</part><part>Genealogy of Prince Eugene.

His mother,<space/><link><target>Olympia Mancini</target></link>, was one of<space/><link><target>Cardinal Mazarin</target></link>'s nieces whom he had brought to<space/><link><target>Paris</target></link><space/>from<space/><link><target>Rome</target></link><space/>in 1647 to further his, and, to a lesser extent, their ambitions. The Mancinis were raised at the<space/><link><target>Palais-Royal</target></link><space/>along with the young Louis XIV, with whom Olympia formed an intimate relationship. Yet to her great disappointment, her chance to become queen passed by, and in 1657, Olympia married<space/><link><target>Eugene Maurice, Count of Soissons</target><part>Eugene Maurice</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Count of Soissons</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Count of Dreux</target></link><space/>and Prince of<space/><link><target>Savoy</target></link>. Together they had had five sons (Eugene being the youngest) and three daughters, but neither parent spent much time with the children: his father, a brave, unglamorous French soldier, spent much of his time away campaigning, while Olympia's passion for court intrigue meant the children received little attention from her.<extension extension_name='ref'>McKay:<space/><italics>Prince Eugene of Savoy,</italics><space/>910</extension></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Soisson.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>300px</part><part>left</part><part>Htel de Soissons, Eugene's birthplace.

After falling out of favour at court, Olympia turned to<space/><link><target>La Voisin</target><part>Catherine Deshayes</part></link><space/>(known as<space/><italics>La Voisin</italics>), and the arts of black magic and astrology. It was a fatal relationship. Embroiled in the<space/><italics><link><target>Poison affair</target><part>affaire des poisons</part></link></italics>, suspicions now abounded of her involvement in her husband's premature death in 1673, and even implicated her in a plot to kill the King himself. Whatever the truth, Olympia, rather than face trial, subsequently fled France for<space/><link><target>Brussels</target></link><space/>in January 1680, leaving Eugene in the care of his father's mother,<space/><link><target>Marie de Bourbon, Countess of Soissons</target><part>Marie de Bourbon</part></link>, and her daughter,<space/><link><target>Princess Louise Christine of Savoy</target><part>Hereditary Princess of Baden</part></link>, mother of Prince<space/><link><target>Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden</target><part>Louis of Baden</part></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'>McKay:<space/><italics>Prince Eugene of Savoy,</italics><space/>9</extension></paragraph><paragraph>From the age of ten, Eugene had been brought up for a career in the church; a personal choice of the King, basing the decision on the young Prince's poor physique and bearing.

Now 19 years old, Eugene applied directly to Louis XIV for command of a company in French service, but the King who had shown no compassion for Olympia's children since her disgrace refused him out of hand. &quot;The request was modest, not so the petitioner,&quot; he remarked. &quot;No one else ever presumed to stare me out so insolently.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>Heer:<space/><italics>The Holy Roman Empire,</italics><space/>228.

One of Eugene's brothers, Louis Julius, had entered Imperial service the previous year, but he had been immediately killed fighting the<space/><link><target>Ottoman Empire</target><part>Ottoman Turks</part></link><space/>in 1683. When news of his death reached Paris, Eugene decided to travel to Austria in the hope of taking over his brother's command. It was not an unnatural decision: his cousin, Louis of Baden, was already a leading general in the Imperial army, as was a more distant cousin,<space/><link><target>Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria</target></link>.

The day-long<space/><link><target>Battle of Vienna</target></link><space/>resulted in the lifting of the 60-day siege, and the Sultan's forces were routed and in retreat. Serving under Baden, Eugene distinguished himself in the battle, earning commendation from Lorraine and the Emperor; he later received the nomination for the colonelcy of the Dragoon Regiment Kufstein.<extension extension_name='ref'>MacMunn:<space/><italics>Prince Eugene: Twin Marshal with Marlborough,</italics><space/>32</extension></paragraph><heading level='4'>Holy League</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Benczur-budavar.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>300px</part><part>Recapture of Buda castle in 1686 by<space/><link><target>Gyula Benczr</target></link>.</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>In March 1684, Leopold I formed the<space/><link><target>Great Turkish War#War of the Holy League (16831698)</target><part>Holy League</part></link><space/>with<space/><link><target>PolishLithuanian Commonwealth</target><part>Poland</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Republic of Venice</target><part>Venice</part></link><space/>to counter the Ottoman threat. For the next two years, Eugene continued to perform with distinction on campaign and establish himself as a dedicated, professional soldier; by the end of 1685, still only 22 years old, he was made a Major-General.

His fourth brother, Emmanuel, had died aged 14 in 1676; his third, Louis Julius (already mentioned) had died on active service in 1683, and his second brother, Philippe, died of smallpox in 1693.

Nevertheless, in the Low Countries, particularly after the battle of Oudenarde in 1708, Eugene, like his cousin Louis of Baden, tended to play safe and become bogged down in a conservative strategy of sieges and defending supply lines.

On the whole his men responded because he was willing to push himself as hard as them. However, his position as President of the Imperial War Council proved less successful. Following the long period of peace after the Austro-Turkish War, the idea of creating a separate field army or providing garrison troops with effective training for them to be turned into such an army quickly was never considered by Eugene. By the time of the War of the Polish Succession, therefore, the Austrians were outclassed by a better prepared French force. For this Eugene was largely to blame in his view (unlike the drilling and manoeuvres carried out by the Prussians which to Eugene seemed irrelevant to real warfare) the time to create actual fighting men was when war came.<extension extension_name='ref' name="mckay228"></extension><space/>But although Frederick the Great had been struck by the muddle of the Austrian army and its poor organisation during the Polish Succession war, he later amended his initial harsh judgements. &quot;If I understand anything of my trade,&quot; commented Frederick in 1758, &quot;especially in the more difficult aspects, I owe that advantage to Prince Eugene.

Yet the contrast to his co-commander of the Spanish Succession war were stark. &quot;Marlborough,&quot; wrote Churchill, &quot;was the model husband and father, concerned with building up a home, founding a family, and gathering a fortune to sustain it&quot;; whereas Eugene, the bachelor, was &quot;disdainful of money, content with his bright sword and his lifelong animosities against Louis XIV.<extension extension_name='ref'>Churchill, Winston.<space/><italics>Marlborough: His Life and Times, Bk. 1</italics>, II, pp. 774775</extension><space/>The result was an austere figure, inspiring respect and admiration rather than affection.<extension extension_name='ref'>McKay,<space/><italics>Prince Eugene of Savoy</italics>, p. 248</extension><space/>The huge equestrian statue in the centre of Vienna commemorates Eugene's achievements.
