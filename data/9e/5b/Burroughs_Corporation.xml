Burroughs</target></link>). In 1904, six years after Burroughs' death, the company moved to Detroit and changed its name to the Burroughs Adding Machine Company. It soon was the biggest adding machine company in America.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Evolving product lines</heading><paragraph>The adding machine range began with the basic, hand-cranked P100 which was only capable of adding. The design included some revolutionary features, foremost of which was the<space/><link><target>dashpot</target></link>. The P200 offered a subtraction capability and the P300 provided a means of keeping 2 separate totals. The P400 and the P600, the top of the range of which was the P612 provided a moveable carriage and, in the case of the P600/P612 range some limited programmability based upon the position of the carriage. The range was further extended by the inclusion of the &quot;J&quot; series which provided a single finger calculation facility, and the &quot;c&quot; series of both manual and electrical assisted<space/><link><target>comptometer</target><trail>s</trail></link>. In the late 60's the Burroughs sponsored<space/><link><target>Nixie tube</target><part>&quot;nixi-tube&quot;</part></link><space/>provided an electronic display calculator. Burroughs developed a range of adding machines with different capabilities, gradually increasing in their capabilities. A revolutionary adding machine was the<space/><italics>Sensimatic</italics>, which was able to perform many business functions semi-automatically. It had a moving programmable carriage to maintain<space/><link><target>general ledger</target><part>ledgers</part></link>. It could store 9, 18 or 27<space/><link><target>Trial balance</target><part>balances</part></link><space/>during the ledger posting operations and worked with a mechanical adder named a Crossfooter. The Sensimatic developed into the<space/><italics>Sensitronic</italics><space/>which could store balances on a<space/><link><target>magnetic stripe</target></link><space/>which was part of the ledger card. This balance was read into the accumulator when the card was inserted into the carriage. The Sensitronic was followed by the E1000, the E2000, E3000, E4000, E6000 and the E8000, which was computer system supporting<space/><link><target>magnetic tape</target></link>, card reader/punches and a<space/><link><target>line printer</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Later, Burroughs was selling more than adding machines, including typewriters. But the biggest shift in company history came in 1953; the Burroughs Adding Machine Company was renamed the Burroughs Corporation and began moving into computer products, initially for banking institutions. This move began with Burroughs' purchase, in June 1956, of the ElectroData Corporation in<space/><link><target>Pasadena, California</target></link>, a spinoff of the Consolidated Engineering Corporation which had designed test instruments and had a cooperative relationship with<space/><link><target>California Institute of Technology</target><part>Caltech</part></link><space/>in Pasadena.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Sawyer">Sawyer, T.J.,<space/><link type='external' href='http://tjsawyer.com/B205Home.htm'>&quot;Burroughs 205 HomePage&quot;</link></extension><space/>ElectroData had built the Datatron 205 and was working on the Datatron 220.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Sawyer"></extension><space/>The first major computer product that came from this marriage was the B205 tube computer. In the late 1960s the L and TC seriesrange was produced (i.e the TC500Terminal Computer 500) which had a<space/><link><target>golf ball printer</target></link><space/>and in the beginning a 1K (64 bit) disk<space/><link><target>Memory (computers)</target><part>memory</part></link>. These were popular as branch<space/><link><target>Computer terminal</target><part>terminal</part><trail>s</trail></link><space/>to the B5500/6500/6700 systems, and sold well in the banking sector, where they were often connected to non-Burroughs mainframes. In conjunction with these products, Burroughs also manufactured an extensive range of cheque processing equipment, normally attached as terminals to a larger system such as a B2700 or B1700.</paragraph><heading level='2'>A force in the computing industry</heading><paragraph>Burroughs was one of the nine major United States computer companies (with<space/><link><target>IBM</target></link>, the largest,<space/><link><target>Honeywell</target></link>,<space/><link><target>NCR Corporation</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Control Data Corporation</target></link><space/>(CDC),<space/><link><target>General Electric</target></link><space/>(GE),<space/><link><target>Digital Equipment Corporation</target></link><space/>(DEC),<space/><link><target>RCA</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Sperry Rand</target></link><space/>(<link><target>UNIVAC</target></link><space/>line)) through most of the 1960s. In terms of sales, Burroughs was always a distant second to<space/><link><target>International Business Machines</target><part>IBM</part></link>. In fact, IBM's share of the market at the time was so much larger than all of the others, that this group was often referred to as &quot;IBM and the Seven Dwarfs.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.dvorak.org/blog/ibm-and-the-seven-dwarfs-dwarf-one-burroughs/<space/></arg><arg name="title">IBM and the Seven Dwarfs â€” Dwarf One: Burroughs</arg><arg name="publisher">Dvorak Uncensored</arg><arg name="author">[[John C.

All three architectures were considered<space/><link><target>Mainframe computer</target><part>mainframe</part></link><space/>class machines:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>The<space/><link><target>Burroughs large systems</target></link><space/>machines started with the B5000 in 1961. The B5500 came a few years later when large rotating disks replaced drums as the main external memory media. These B5000 Series systems used the world's first virtual memory multi-programming operating system. They were followed by the B6500/B6700 in the later 1960s, the B7700 in the mid 1970s, and the A series in the 1980s. The underlying architecture of these machines is similar and continues today as the<space/><link><target>Unisys</target></link><space/>ClearPath MCP line of computers:<space/><link><target>stack machine</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>designed to be programmed in an extended<space/><link><target>Algol 60</target></link>.

The command interface developed into a compiled<space/><link><target>Structured programming</target><part>structured language</part></link><space/>with declarations, statements and procedures called WFL (<link><target>Work Flow Language</target></link>). Many<space/><link><target>computer scientist</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>consider these series of computers to be technologically groundbreaking. Stack oriented processors, with 48 bit word length where each word was defined as data or program contributed significantly to a secure operating environment, long before<space/><link><target>spyware</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>virus</target><trail>es</trail></link><space/>affected computing.
