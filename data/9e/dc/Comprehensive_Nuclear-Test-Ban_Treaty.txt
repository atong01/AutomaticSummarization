The '''Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty''' ('''CTBT''') is a [[multilateral treaty]] by which states agree to ban all [[nuclear explosion]]s in all environments, for military or civilian purposes. It was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 10 September 1996<ref name="un.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/50/ares50-245.htm|title=Resolution adopted by the general assembly:50/245. Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|date=17 September 1996|accessdate=3 December 2011|work=[[United Nations]]}}</ref> but it has not entered into force due to the non-ratification of eight specific states.

==History==
To date, over 2,000 nuclear tests have been carried out at different locations all over the world.<ref name=nuclear>{{cite web|work=[[Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization]]|year=2012|url= http://www.ctbto.org/nuclear-testing/history-of-nuclear-testing/world-overview/page-1-world-overview/ |title= Nuclear testing world overview |accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref> Arms control advocates had campaigned for the adoption of a treaty banning all nuclear explosions since the early 1950s, when public concern was aroused as a result of radioactive fall-out from atmospheric nuclear tests and the escalating arms race. Over 50 nuclear explosions were registered between 16 July 1945, when the first nuclear explosive test was conducted by the United States at [[White Sands Missile Range]] near [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]], and 31 December 1953. [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] of India voiced the heightened international concern in 1954, when he proposed the elimination of all nuclear test explosions worldwide. However, within the context of the [[Cold War]], skepticism about the capability to verify compliance with a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty posed a major obstacle to any agreement.

===Partial Test Ban Treaty===
Limited success was achieved with the signing of the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] in 1963, which banned nuclear tests in the atmosphere, underwater and in space, but not underground. Neither France nor China signed the PTBT. However, the treaty was still ratified by the United States after an 80 to 19 vote in the [[United States Senate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1963/University-of-Alabama/12295509434394-4/#title|title=1963 Year In Review|work=UPI.com|accessdate=3 December 2011|year=1963}}</ref> While the PTBT reduced atmospheric fallout, underground nuclear testing can also vent radioactivity into the atmosphere, and radioactivity released underground may seep into the ground water. Moreover, the PTBT had no restraining effects on the further development of nuclear warheads.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2003_10/LTBT|work=Arms Control Association|author=Daryl Kimball and Wade Boese|date= June 2009|accessdate=21 May 2012|title=Limited Test Ban Treaty Turns 40}}</ref>

===Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty===
A major step towards [[nuclear proliferation|non-proliferation]] of nuclear weapons came with the signing of the [[Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty]] (NPT) in 1968. Under the NPT, non-nuclear weapon states were prohibited from, among other things, possessing, manufacturing or acquiring nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. All signatories, including nuclear weapon states, were committed to the goal of total [[nuclear disarmament]]. However, India, Pakistan and Israel have declined to sign the NPT on grounds that such a treaty is fundamentally discriminatory as it places limitations on states that do not have nuclear weapons while making no efforts to curb weapons development by declared nuclear weapons states.

==Negotiations for the CTBT==
Given the political situation prevailing in the subsequent decades, little progress was made in nuclear disarmament until the end of the [[Cold War]] in 1991. Parties to the PTBT held an amendment conference that year to discuss a proposal to convert the Treaty into an instrument banning all nuclear-weapon tests; with strong support from the UN General Assembly, negotiations for a comprehensive test-ban treaty began in 1993.

===Adoption of the CTBT===
Intensive efforts were made over the next three years to draft the Treaty text and its two annexes. However, the [[Conference on Disarmament]], in which negotiations were being held, did not succeed in reaching consensus on the adoption of the text. Under the direction of Prime Minister [[John Howard]] and Foreign Minister [[Alexander Downer]], [[Australia]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} then sent the text to the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in [[New York]], where it was submitted as a draft resolution.<ref>{{cite web|title=Comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty: draft resolution|url=http://unbisnet.un.org:8080/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=X204697124L65.19785&profile=bibga&uri=full=3100001~!396802~!33&ri=1&aspect=power&menu=search&source=~!horizon#focus|accessdate=3 December 2011|date=6 September 1996|work=[[United Nations]]}}</ref> On 10 September 1996, the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) was adopted by a large majority, exceeding two-thirds of the General Assembly's Membership.<ref name="un.org"/>

#Each State Party undertakes not to carry out any [[nuclear weapon]] test explosion or any other nuclear explosion, and to prohibit and prevent any such nuclear explosion at any place under its jurisdiction or control.
#Each State Party undertakes, furthermore, to refrain from causing, encouraging, or in any way participating in the carrying out of any nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion.

==Monitoring of the CTBT==
[[geophysics|Geophysical]] and other technologies are used to monitor for compliance with the Treaty: [[forensic seismology]], [[hydrophone|hydroacoustics]], [[infrasound]], and [[radionuclide]] monitoring. The technologies are used to monitor the underground, the waters and the atmosphere for any sign of a nuclear explosion. Statistical theories and methods are integral to CTBT monitoring
providing confidence in verification analysis. Once the Treaty enters into force, on site inspection will be provided for where concerns about compliance arise.

The [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission|Preparatory Commission]] for the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization]] (CTBTO), an international organization headquartered in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], was created to build the verification regime, including establishment and provisional operation of the network of monitoring stations, the creation of an international data centre, and development of the On Site Inspection capability.

The monitoring network consists of 337 facilities located all over the globe. As of May 2012, more than 260 facilities have been certified. The monitoring stations register data that is transmitted to the international data centre in Vienna for processing and analysis. The data are sent to states that have signed the Treaty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctbto.org/press-centre/press-releases/2009/us-nuclear-security-administrator-dagostinovisits-the-ctbto/|title=US nuclear security administrator dagostino visits the CTBTO|accessdate=4 December 2011|date=15 September 2009|work=[[CTBTO Preparatory Commission]]}}</ref>

===Nuclear testing after CTBT adoption===
Three countries have tested nuclear weapons since the CTBT opened for signature in 1996. India and Pakistan both carried out two sets of tests in 1998. North Korea carried out three announced tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013. All three North Korean tests were picked up by the International Monitoring System set up by the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission]].<ref name=highlight>{{cite web|work=[[Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization]]|year=2012|url= http://www.ctbto.org/press-centre/highlights/2007/the-ctbt-verification-regime-put-to-the-test-the-event-in-the-dprk-on-9-october-2006/page-1/?Fsize=atextonly%3D1 |title= Highlight 2007: The CTBT Verification Regime Put to the Test – The Event in the DPRK on 9 October 2006 |accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref><ref name=press>{{cite web|work=[[Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization]]|year=2012|url= http://www.ctbto.org/press-centre/highlights/2009/experts-sure-about-nature-of-the-dprk-event/?Fsize=atextonly%3D1|title= Press Release June 2009: Experts Sure About Nature of the DPRK Event|accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref>
