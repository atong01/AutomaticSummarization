The '''Boeing C-17 Globemaster III''' is a large [[military transport aircraft]].  It was developed for the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) from the 1980s to the early 1990s by [[McDonnell Douglas]]. The C-17 carries forward the name of two previous piston-engined military cargo aircraft, the [[Douglas C-74 Globemaster]] and the [[Douglas C-124 Globemaster II]]. The C-17 commonly performs [[airlift#Strategic airlift|strategic airlift]] missions, transporting troops and cargo throughout the world; additional roles include tactical airlift, [[medical evacuation]] and [[airdrop]] duties.

[[Boeing]], which merged with McDonnell Douglas in the 1990s, continued to manufacture C-17s for export customers following the end of deliveries to the U.S. Air Force. Aside from the United States, the C-17 is in service with the [[Royal Air Force|United Kingdom]], [[Royal Australian Air Force|Australia]], [[Royal Canadian Air Force|Canada]], [[Qatar Emiri Air Force|Qatar]], [[United Arab Emirates Air Force|United Arab Emirates]], [[NATO]] [[Heavy Airlift Wing]], [[Indian Air Force|India]], and [[Kuwait Air Force|Kuwait]].  The final C-17 was completed in May 2015.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Development==

===Background and design phase===
In the 1970s, the U.S. Air Force began looking for a replacement for its [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] tactical cargo aircraft.<ref>[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/djreprints/access/72923084.html?dids=72923084:72923084&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Nov+13%2C+1972&author=&pub=Wall+Street+Journal&desc=Air+Force+Lets+Advanced+STOL+Prototype+Work&pqatl=google "Air Force Lets Advanced STOL Prototype Work."] ''Wall Street Journal,'' 13 November 1972.</ref>  The [[Advanced Medium STOL Transport]] (AMST) competition was held, with [[Boeing Integrated Defense Systems|Boeing]] proposing the [[Boeing YC-14|YC-14]], and [[McDonnell Douglas]] proposing the [[McDonnell Douglas YC-15|YC-15]].<ref>Miles, Marvin. [http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/660687842.html?dids=660687842:660687842&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Nov+11%2C+1972&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=McDonnell%2C+Boeing+to+Compete+for+Lockheed+C-130+Successor&pqatl=google "McDonnell, Boeing to Compete for Lockheed C-130 Successor."] ''Los Angeles Times,'' 11 November 1972.</ref>  Though both entrants exceeded specified requirements, the AMST competition was canceled before a winner was selected. The Air Force started the C-X program in November 1979 to develop a larger AMST with longer range to augment its strategic airlift.<ref name=kennedy_part1>Kennedy 2004, pp. 3–20, 24.</ref>

[[File:Yc15-1 072.jpg|thumb|left|The [[McDonnell Douglas YC-15]] design was used as the basis for the C-17.|alt=Top view of cargo aircraft in-flight, trailed by a fighter chase aircraft. Under each un-swept wing are two engines suspended forward ahead the leading edge.]]
By 1980, the USAF found itself with a large fleet of aging [[Lockheed C-141 Starlifter|C-141 Starlifter]] cargo aircraft. Compounding matters, USAF needed increased strategic airlift capabilities to fulfill its rapid-deployment airlift requirements. The USAF set mission requirements and released a request for proposals (RFP) for C-X in October 1980. McDonnell Douglas elected to develop a new aircraft based on the YC-15; Boeing bid an enlarged three-engine version of its AMST YC-14. Lockheed submitted two designs, a C-5-based design and an enlarged C-141 design. On 28 August 1981, McDonnell Douglas was chosen to build its proposed aircraft, then designated ''C-17''. Compared to the YC-15, the new aircraft differed in having swept wings, increased size, and more powerful engines.<ref name=norton_p12-3>Norton 2001, pp. 12–13.</ref>  This would allow it to perform the work done by the C-141, and also fulfill some of the duties of the [[Lockheed C-5 Galaxy]], freeing the C-5 fleet for [[outsize cargo]].<ref name=norton_p12-3/>

Alternate proposals were pursued to fill airlift needs after the C-X contest.  These were lengthening of C-141As into C-141Bs, ordering more C-5s, continued purchases of [[McDonnell Douglas KC-10 Extender|KC-10]]s, and expansion of the [[Civil Reserve Air Fleet]].  Limited budgets reduced program funding, requiring a delay of four years.  During this time contracts were awarded for preliminary design work and for the completion of engine certification.<ref name=norton_p13-5/>  In December 1985, a full-scale development contract was awarded.<ref>[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/98482212.html?dids=98482212:98482212&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+03%2C+1986&author=The+Los+Angeles+Times&pub=Newsday+(Combined+editions)&desc=Douglas+Wins+%243.4B+Pact+to+Build+C-17&pqatl=google  "Douglas Wins $3.4B Pact to Build C-17."] ''Los Angeles Times,'' 3 January 1986.</ref>  At this time, first flight was planned for 1990.<ref name=norton_p13-5>Norton 2001, pp. 13, 15.</ref>  The Air Force had formed a requirement for 210 aircraft.<ref name=kennedy_p70>Kennedy 2004, pp. 70, 81–83.</ref>

===Development difficulties===
A static test of the C-17 wing in October 1992 resulted in the wing failing at 128% of design limit load, which was below the 150% requirement.  Both wings buckled rear to the front and failures occurred in stringers, spars and ribs.<ref>[http://www.dodig.mil/Audit/Audit2/93-159.pdf "Technical Assessment Report; C-17 Wing Structural Integrity."] ''Department of Defense'', 24 August 1993.

In April 1994, the C-17 program remained over budget, and did not meet weight, fuel burn, payload and range specifications. It failed several key criteria during airworthiness evaluation tests.<ref>[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19910528&slug=1285732 "Air Force Letter To Douglas Spells Out 75 Defects For C-17."] ''Los Angeles Times,'' 28 May 1991.</ref><ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=LB&p_theme=lb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAE8F93D6E54ED8&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM "C-17 fails engine start test."] ''Press-Telegram,'' 12 April 1994.</ref><ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CO&s_site=charlotte&p_multi=CO&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB6CC1343F2E14F&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM "Parts Orders for C-17 far too high, GAO says."] ''Charlotte Observer,'' 16 March 1994.</ref> Technical problems were found with the mission software, landing gear, and other areas.<ref>[http://archive.gao.gov/t2pbat3/151473.pdf "The C-17 Proposed Settlement and Program Update."] ''United States General Accounting Office,''  28 April 1994.</ref> In May 1994, it was proposed to cut production to as few as 32 aircraft; these cuts were later rescinded.<ref>Kreisher, Otto.

The C-5 has a lower LCN, but the USAF classifies both in the same broad Load Classification Group (LCG). When considering runway dimensions and load ratings, the C-17's worldwide runway advantage over the C-5 shrank from 6,400 to 911 airfields.<ref name=airfields>[http://archive.gao.gov/t2pbat3/152088.pdf "Comparison of C-5 and C-17 Airfield Availability."] ''United States General Accounting Office,'' July 1994.</ref> The C-17's ability to use low quality, austere airfields was not considered.<ref name=airfields/>

==Design==
The C-17 is {{convert|174|ft|m}} long and has a wingspan of about {{convert|170|ft|m}}. It can airlift cargo fairly close to a battle area. The size and weight of U.S. mechanized firepower and equipment have grown in recent decades from increased air mobility requirements, particularly for large or heavy non-palletized [[outsize cargo]].

The C-17 is powered by four [[Pratt & Whitney PW2000|Pratt & Whitney F117-PW-100]] [[turbofan]] engines, which are based on the commercial [[Pratt & Whitney PW2000|Pratt and Whitney PW2040]] used on the [[Boeing 757]].  Each engine is rated at 40,400&nbsp;lbf (180&nbsp;kN) of thrust. The engine's [[thrust reversal|thrust reversers]] direct engine exhaust air upwards and forward, reducing the chances of [[foreign object damage]] by ingestion of runway debris, and providing enough reverse thrust to back the aircraft up on the ground while taxiing. The thrust reversers can also be used in flight at idle-reverse for added drag in maximum-rate descents. In [[vortex surfing]] tests performed by C-17s, up to 10% fuel savings were reported.<ref>Drinnon, Roger.

For cargo operations the C-17 requires a crew of three: pilot, copilot, and loadmaster. The cargo compartment is 88 feet (26.82 m) long by 18 feet (5.49 m) wide by 12 feet 4&nbsp;inches (3.76 m) high. The cargo floor has rollers for palletized cargo but it can be flipped to provide a flat floor suitable for vehicles and other rolling stock. Cargo is loaded through a large aft ramp that accommodates [[rolling stock]], such as a 69-ton (63-metric ton) [[M1 Abrams]] [[main battle tank]], other armored vehicles, trucks, and trailers, along with [[463L master pallet|palletized cargo]].

[[File:C-17 Globemaster III cockpit.jpg|thumb|C-17 Globemaster III cockpit]]
Maximum payload of the C-17 is 170,900&nbsp;lb (77,500&nbsp;kg), and its [[Maximum takeoff weight]] is 585,000&nbsp;lb (265,350&nbsp;kg). With a payload of 160,000&nbsp;lb (72,600&nbsp;kg) and an initial cruise altitude of 28,000&nbsp;ft (8,500 m), the C-17 has an unrefueled range of about 2,400 nautical miles (4,400&nbsp;km) on the first 71 aircraft, and 2,800 nautical miles (5,200&nbsp;km) on all subsequent extended-range models that include a sealed center wing bay as a fuel tank. Boeing informally calls these aircraft the ''C-17 ER''.<ref name=bids_c17_fml>[http://www.boeing.com/commercial/airports/arff/arffc17.pdf "C-17/C-17 ER Flammable Material Locations."] ''Boeing,'' 1 May 2005.</ref> The C-17's cruise speed is about 450 knots (833&nbsp;km/h) (Mach 0.74).

Retrieved 4 September 2013.</ref> The U.S. Army's [[Ground Combat Vehicle]] is to be transported by the C-17.

The C-17 is designed to operate from runways as short as 3,500&nbsp;ft (1,064 m) and as narrow as 90&nbsp;ft (27 m). In addition, the C-17 can operate from unpaved, unimproved runways (although with greater chance of damage to the aircraft).<ref name=AF_fact /> The thrust reversers can be used to back the aircraft and reverse direction on narrow taxiways using a three- (or more) point turn. The plane is designed for 20 [[man-hour]]s of maintenance per flight hour, and a 74% mission availability rate.<ref name=AF_fact />

===Royal Air Force===
Boeing has marketed the C-17 to many European nations including Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. The [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) has established an aim of having interoperability and some weapons and capabilities commonality with the USAF. The 1998 [[Strategic Defence Review]] identified a requirement for a strategic airlifter. The Short-Term Strategic Airlift (STSA) competition commenced in September of that year, however tendering was canceled in August 1999 with some bids identified by ministers as too expensive, including the Boeing/[[British Aerospace|BAe]] C-17 bid, and others unsuitable.<ref name=business>O'Connell, Dominic. "Political clash haunts MoD deal decision." ''The Business (Sunday Business Group),'' 5 December 1999.</ref> The project continued, with the C-17 seen as the favorite.<ref name=business/> In the light of [[Airbus A400M]] delays, the UK [[Secretary of State for Defence]], [[Geoff Hoon]], announced in May 2000 that the RAF would lease four C-17s at an annual cost of [[Pound sterling|£]]100 million from Boeing<ref name=avweek_20060313/> for an initial seven years with an optional two-year extension. The RAF had the option to buy or return the aircraft to Boeing. The UK committed to upgrading its C-17s in line with the USAF so that if they were returned, the USAF could adopt them.

[[File:Royal Air Force C-17 August 2010.jpg|thumb|RAF C-17 at RAF Lakenheath, August 2010]]
The first C-17 was delivered to the RAF at Boeing's Long Beach facility on 17 May 2001 and flown to [[RAF Brize Norton]] by a crew from [[No. 99 Squadron RAF|No. 99 Squadron]]. The RAF's fourth C-17 was delivered on 24 August 2001. The RAF aircraft were some of the first to take advantage of the new center wing fuel tank found in Block 13 aircraft. In RAF service, the C-17 has not been given an [[British military aircraft designation systems|official service name and designation]] (for example, C-130J referred to as Hercules C4 or C5), but is referred to simply as the C-17 or "C-17A Globemaster".

The RAF declared itself delighted with the C-17. Although the Globemaster fleet was to be a fallback for the A400M, the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD) announced on 21 July 2004 that they had elected to buy their four C-17s at the end of the lease,<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/review-turns-up-the-heat-on-eurofighter-186087/ "Review turns up the heat on eurofighter"]. ''Flight International'', 22 July 2004.</ref> even though the A400M appeared to be closer to production. The C-17 gives the RAF strategic capabilities that it would not wish to lose, for example a maximum payload of 169,500&nbsp;lb (77,000&nbsp;kg) compared to the A400M's 82,000&nbsp;lb (37,000&nbsp;kg).<ref name=avweek_20060313/> The C-17's capabilities allow the RAF to use it as an airborne hospital for [[medical evacuation]] missions.<ref>"[http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-air-hospital The Air Hospital]" ''[[Channel 4]]'', 25 March 2010.

The [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) began investigating an acquisition of heavy lift aircraft for strategic transport in 2005.<ref name=McLaughlin_p40-41>McLaughlin 2008, pp. 40–41.</ref> In late 2005 the then [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]] [[Robert Hill (Australian diplomat)|Robert Hill]] stated that such aircraft were being considered due to the limited availability of strategic airlift aircraft from partner nations and air freight companies. The C-17 was considered to be favored over the A400M as it was a "proven aircraft" and in production. One major RAAF requirement was the ability to airlift the [[Australian Army|Army's]] M1 Abrams tanks; another requirement was immediate delivery. Though unstated, commonality with the USAF and the United Kingdom's RAF was also considered advantageous. RAAF aircraft were ordered directly from the USAF production run and are identical to American C-17 even in paint scheme, the only difference being the [[Military aircraft insignia|national marking]]s. This allowed delivery to commence within nine months of commitment to the program.<ref name=awst_20061211>"Stock Standard". ''[[Aviation Week & Space Technology]]'', 11 December 2006.</ref>

===Royal Canadian Air Force===
Canada's air arm has had a long-standing need for strategic airlift for humanitarian and military operations around the world. It had followed a pattern similar to the [[German Air Force]] in leasing [[Antonov]]s and [[Ilyushin]]s for many of its needs, including deploying the [[Disaster Assistance Response Team]] (DART) to tsunami-stricken Sri Lanka in 2005. The air service was forced to rely entirely on leased [[Antonov An-124|An-124 ''Ruslan'']] for a [[Canadian Army]] [[Operation Halo|deployment to Haiti]] in 2003.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The service has also used a combination of leased ''Ruslans'', Ilyushins and USAF C-17s for moving heavy equipment into Afghanistan. In 2002, the Canadian Forces Future Strategic Airlifter Project began to study alternatives, including long-term leasing arrangements.<ref>Whelan, Peter.
