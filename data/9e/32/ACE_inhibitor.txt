An '''angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor''' ('''ACE inhibitor''') is a [[pharmaceutical drug]] used primarily for the treatment of [[hypertension]] (elevated blood pressure) and [[congestive heart failure]].

This group of drugs cause relaxation of blood vessels, as well as a decreased [[blood volume]], which leads to lower [[blood pressure]] and decreased oxygen demand from the [[heart]]. They [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibit]] the [[angiotensin-converting enzyme]], an important component of the [[renin–angiotensin system|renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system]].

Frequently prescribed ACE inhibitors include [[perindopril]], [[captopril]], [[enalapril]], [[lisinopril]], and [[ramipril]].

==Medical use==
ACE inhibitors were initially approved for the treatment of hypertension, and can be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive medications.  Later, they were found useful in other cardiovascular and kidney diseases<ref name="Goodman-Gilman">{{cite book |author-first=Edwin K. |author-last=Jackson | chapter = Chapter 30.

* [[Acute myocardial infarction]] (heart attack) 
* [[Cardiac failure]] ([[Heart failure|left ventricular systolic dysfunction]]) 
* Kidney complications of [[diabetes mellitus]] ([[diabetic nephropathy]])

In treating heart disease, ACE inhibitors are usually used with other medications. A typical treatment plan  often includes an ACE inhibitor, a [[beta blocker]], a long-acting [[nitrate]], and a [[calcium channel blocker]] in combinations that are adjusted to the individual patient's needs.

ACE inhibitors have also been used in [[chronic kidney failure]] and kidney involvement in [[systemic sclerosis]] (hardening of tissues, as scleroderma renal crisis)

==Mechanism of action==
ACE inhibitors reduce the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) as the primary etiologic (causal) event in the development of hypertension in people with diabetes mellitus, as part of the insulin-resistance syndrome or as a manifestation of renal disease.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 16959581 | doi=10.1016/j.ecl.2006.06.007 | volume=35 | issue=3 | title=Hypertension and diabetes: role of the renin-angiotensin system. | date=Sep 2006 | journal=Endocrinol Metab Clin North Am | pages=469–90, vii}}</ref>

===Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system===
{{Main|Renin–angiotensin system}}
[[File:Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.png|thumb|475px|[[Renin–angiotensin system|Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system]]]]
One mechanism for maintaining the blood pressure is the release of a protein called [[renin]] from cells in the kidney (to be specific, the [[juxtaglomerular apparatus]]). This produces another protein, [[angiotensin]]. This system is activated in response to a fall in blood pressure ([[hypotension]]) and markers of problems with the salt-water balance of the body, such as decreased [[sodium]] concentration in the [[Distal convoluted tubule|distal tubule]]s of the kidney, decreased blood volume, and stimulation of the kidney by the [[sympathetic nervous system]]. In such situations, the kidneys release renin, which acts as an [[enzyme]] and cuts off all but the first 10 [[amino acid]] residues of [[angiotensinogen]] (a protein made in the liver, and which circulates in the blood). These 10 residues are then known as [[angiotensin I]]. [[Angiotensin converting enzyme|ACE]] then removes a further two residues, converting angiotensin I into [[angiotensin II]]. Angiotensin II is found in the [[pulmonary circulation]] and in the [[endothelium]] of many blood vessels.<ref>Human Physiology, Silverthorn (Pearson Benjamin Cummings 2004){{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> The system increases blood pressure by increasing the amount of salt and water the body retains, although angiotensin is also very good at causing the blood vessels to tighten (a potent [[vasoconstrictor]]).

===Effects===
ACE inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I (AI) to angiotensin II (AII).<ref name='Ogbru'>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/ace_inhibitors/article.htm |title=ACE Inhibitors (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors) |accessdate=2010-03-20 |author=Ogbru O |work=MedicineNet.com |publisher=MedicineNet, Inc | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100326095902/http://www.medicinenet.com/ace_inhibitors/article.htm| archivedate= 26 March 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> They thereby lower [[arteriole|arteriolar]] resistance and increase venous capacity; decrease [[cardiac output]], [[cardiac index]], stroke work, and [[stroke volume|volume]]; lower resistance in blood vessels in the kidneys; and lead to increased [[natriuresis]] (excretion of sodium in the urine).
Renin increases in concentration in the blood as a result of negative feedback of conversion of AI to AII. AI increases for the same reason; AII and aldosterone decrease. Bradykinin increases because of less inactivation by ACE.

Under normal conditions, angiotensin II has these effects:
* Vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) and vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy (enlargement) induced by AII may lead to increased blood pressure and hypertension. Further, constriction of the [[efferent arteriole]]s of the kidney leads to increased perfusion pressure in the [[glomerulus|glomeruli]].
* It contributes to [[ventricular remodeling]] and [[ventricular hypertrophy]] of the heart through stimulation of the [[proto-oncogene]]s [[c-fos]], [[c-jun]], [[c-myc]], [[transforming growth factor beta]] (TGF-B), through fibrogenesis and apoptosis (programmed cell death). Stimulation by AII of the [[adrenal cortex]] to release aldosterone, a hormone that acts on kidney tubules, causes sodium and chloride ions retention and potassium excretion. Sodium is a "water-holding" ion, so water is also retained, which leads to increased blood volume, hence an increase in blood pressure.
* Stimulation of the posterior pituitary to release [[vasopressin]] (antidiuretic hormone, ADH) also acts on the kidneys to increase water retention. If ADH production is excessive in heart failure, Na<sup>+</sup> level in the plasma may fall (hyponatremia), and this is a sign of increased risk of death in heart failure patients.
* A decrease renal protein kinase C

With ACE inhibitor use, the production of AII is decreased, leading to decreased blood pressure.

[[Epidemiology|Epidemiological]] and clinical studies have shown ACE inhibitors reduce the progress of [[diabetic nephropathy]] independently from their blood pressure-lowering effect.<ref name="pmid10780101">{{cite journal | author = Hoogwerf BJ, Young JB | title = The HOPE study.

ACE inhibitors have been shown to be effective for indications other than hypertension even in patients with normal blood pressure.{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.||date=October 2014}} The use of a maximum dose of ACE inhibitors in such patients (including for prevention of diabetic nephropathy, congestive heart failure, and prophylaxis of cardiovascular events) is justified, {{By whom|date=March 2012}} because it improves clinical outcomes independently of the blood pressure-lowering effect of ACE inhibitors. Such therapy, of course, requires careful and gradual titration of the dose to prevent the effects of rapidly decreasing blood pressure (dizziness, fainting, etc.).

ACE inhibitors have also been shown to cause a central enhancement of [[parasympathetic nervous system]] activity in healthy volunteers and patients with heart failure.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ajayi AA, Campbell BC, Howie CA, Reid JL | title = Acute and Chronic Effects of the Converting Enzyme Inhibitors Enalapril and Lisinopril on Reflex Control of Heart Rate in Normotensive Man | journal = Journal of Hypertension | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 47–53 | year = 1985 | pmid = 2987341 | doi = 10.1097/00004872-198502000-00008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Adigun AQ, Asiyanbola B, Ajayi AA | title = Cardiac autonomic function in Blacks with congestive heart failure: vagomimetic action, alteration in sympathovagal balance, and the effect of ACE inhibition on central and peripheral vagal tone | journal = Cell Mol Biol (Noisy le grande) | volume = 47 | issue = 6 | pages = 1063–7 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11785658 }}{{Verify source|title?|date=October 2009}}</ref> This action may reduce the prevalence of malignant cardiac arrhythmias, and the reduction in sudden death reported in large clinical trials.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Binkley PF, Haas GJ, Starling RC, Nunziata E, Hatton PA, Leier CV, Cody RJ | title = Sustained augmentation of parasympathetic tone with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in patients with congestive heart failure | journal = J Am Coll Cardiol | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 655–61 | date = 1 Mar 1993 | pmid = 8436747 | doi = 10.1016/0735-1097(93)90098-L }}</ref>
ACE Inhibitors also reduce plasma [[norepinephrine]] levels, and its resulting vasoconstriction effects, in heart failure patients, thus breaking the vicious circles of [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] and renin angiotensin system activation, which sustains the downward spiral in cardiac function in congestive heart failure

Common [[adverse drug reaction]]s include: hypotension, [[cough]], [[hyperkalemia]], [[headache]], [[Vertigo (medical)|dizziness]], [[Fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], [[nausea]], and renal impairment.<ref name="AMH2006">Rossi S, editor.

The main adverse effects of ACE inhibition can be understood from their pharmacological action. The other reported adverse effects are hepatotoxicity and effect on the fetus.<ref name="Sidorenkov & Navis 2014"/>

Renal impairment is a significant potential adverse effect of all ACE inhibitors, that directly follows from their mechanism of action. Patients starting on an ACE inhibitor usually have a modest reduction in [[glomerular filtration rate]] (GFR) that stabilizes after several days. However, the decrease may be significant in conditions of decreased renal perfusion, such as renal artery stenosis, heart failure, polycystic kidney disease, or volume depletion. In these patients, maintenance of GFR depends on angiotensin-II-dependent efferent vasomotor tone. Therefore, renal function should be closely monitored over the first few days after initiation of treatment with ACE inhibitor in patients with decreased renal perfusion.<ref name="Sidorenkov & Navis 2014"/> A moderate reduction in renal function, no greater than 30% rise in serum creatinine, that is stabilized after a week of treatment, is deemed acceptable as part of the therapeutic effect, providing the residual renal function is sufficient. This is especially a problem if the patient is concomitantly taking an [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAID]] and a [[diuretic]]. When the three drugs are taken together,  the risk of developing renal failure is significantly increased.<ref name="Thomas2000">{{cite journal | author = Thomas MC | title = Diuretics, ACE inhibitors and NSAIDs--the triple whammy | journal = The Medical journal of Australia | volume = 172 | issue = 4 | pages = 184–5 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10772593 }}</ref>

[[Hyperkalemia]] is another possible complication of treatment with an ACE inhibitor due to its effect on aldosterone. Suppression of angiotensin II leads to a decrease in aldosterone levels. Since aldosterone is responsible for increasing the excretion of potassium, ACE inhibitors can cause retention of potassium. Some people, however, can continue to lose potassium while on an ACE inhibitor.<ref name="Cohn2000">{{cite journal | author = Cohn JN, Kowey PR, Whelton PK, Prisant LM | title = New guidelines for potassium replacement in clinical practice: a contemporary review by the National Council on Potassium in Clinical Practice | journal = The Archives of Internal Medicine | volume = 160 | issue = 16 | pages = 2429–36 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10979053 | doi = 10.1001/archinte.160.16.2429 }}</ref> Hyperkalemia may decrease the velocity of impulse conduction in the nerves and muscles, including cardiac tissues. This leads to cardiac dysfunction and neuromuscular consequences, such as muscle weakness, paresthesia, nausea, diarrhea, and others. Close monitoring of potassium levels is required in patients receiving treatment with ACE inhibitors who are at risk of hyperkalemia.<ref name="Sidorenkov & Navis 2014"/>

Another possible adverse effect specific for ACE inhibitors, but not for other RAAS blockers, is an increase in [[bradykinin]] level.<ref name="Sidorenkov & Navis 2014"/> Elevated bradykinin level due to ACE inhibition can be a cause of dry cough, angioedema and/or rash, hypotension, and inflammation-related pain.

A persistent dry cough is a relatively common adverse effect believed to be associated with the increases in bradykinin levels produced by ACE inhibitors, although the role of bradykinin in producing these symptoms has been disputed.<ref name="Okumura2001">{{cite journal | author = Okumura H, Nishimura E, Kariya S, Ohtani M, Uchino K, Fukatsu T, Odanaka J, Takahashi T, Watanabe K, Itoh T, Hashiguchi M, Echizen H, Rikihisa T | title = Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE）阻害薬誘発性の咳嗽発現とACE 遺伝子型，血漿中ブラジキニン，サブスタンスP 及びACE 阻害薬濃度との関連性 | language = Japanese | journal = Yakugaku Zasshi | volume = 121 | issue = 3 | pages = 253–7 | date = March 2001 | pmid = 11265121 | doi = 10.1248/yakushi.121.253 | url = http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/yakushi/121/3/253/_pdf | trans_title = No Relation between Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitor-Induced Cough and ACE Gene Polymorphism, Plasma Bradykinin, Substance P and ACE Inhibitor Concentration in Japanese Patients }}</ref> Patients who experience this cough are often switched to [[angiotensin II receptor antagonist]]s.

Some patients develop [[angioedema]] due to increased bradykinin levels. A genetic predisposition may exist toward this adverse effect in patients who degrade bradykinin more slowly than average.<ref name="Molinaro2002">{{cite journal | author = Molinaro G, Cugno M, Perez M, Lepage Y, Gervais N, Agostoni A, Adam A | title = Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema is characterized by a slower degradation of des-arginine(9)-bradykinin | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 303 | issue = 1 | pages = 232–7 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12235256 | doi = 10.1124/jpet.102.038067 | last2 = Cugno | last3 = Perez | first3 = M | first2 = M }}</ref>

Rash and taste disturbances, infrequent with most ACE inhibitors, are more prevalent in [[captopril]], and this is attributed to its sulfhydryl moiety. This has led to decreased use of captopril in clinical setting, although it is still used in [[scintigraphy]] of the kidney.

A severe rare allergic reaction can affect the bowel wall and secondarily cause abdominal pain.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In [[pregnancy|pregnant women]], ACE inhibitors taken during all the trimesters have been reported to cause [[congenital malformations]], [[stillbirth]]s, and [[neonatal death]]s. Commonly reported fetal abnormalities include [[hypotension]], [[renal dysplasia]], anuria/oliguria, [[oligohydramnios]], [[intrauterine growth retardation]], [[pulmonary hypoplasia]], [[patent ductus arteriosus]], and incomplete ossification of the skull.<ref name="Sidorenkov & Navis 2014"/><ref name="pmid9520613">{{cite journal | author = Sørensen AM, Christensen S, Jonassen TE, Andersen D, Petersen JS | title = [Teratogenic effects of ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists] | language = Danish | journal = Ugeskrift for Laeger | volume = 160 | issue = 10 | pages = 1460–4 | date = March 1998 | pmid = 9520613 | doi =  | url =  }}</ref> Overall, about half of newborns exposed to ACE inhibitors are adversely affected.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bullo M, Tschumi S, Bucher BS, Bianchetti MG, Simonetti GD | title = Pregnancy Outcome Following Exposure to Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors or Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists: A Systematic Review | journal = Hypertension | volume = 60 | issue = 2 | pages = 444–50 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22753220 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.112.196352 }}</ref>

==Contraindications and precautions==
The ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in patients with:
* Previous [[angioedema]] associated with ACE inhibitor therapy
* Hypersensitivity to ACE inhibitors

ACE inhibitors should be used with caution in patients with:
* Impaired renal function
* [[Aortic valve stenosis]] or cardiac outflow obstruction
* [[Hypovolemia]] or [[dehydration]]
* [[Hemodialysis]] with high-flux polyacrylonitrile membranes

ACE inhibitors are [[Australian Drug Evaluation Committee|ADEC]] [[pregnancy category]] D, and should be avoided in women who are likely to become pregnant.<ref name="AMH2006" /> In the U.S., ACE inhibitors must be labeled with a "[[Black box warning|black box]]" warning concerning the risk of birth defects when taken during the second and third trimester. Their use in the first trimester is also associated with a risk of major [[congenital malformation]]s, particularly affecting the [[Circulatory system|cardiovascular]] and [[central nervous system]]s.<ref name="Cooper2006">{{cite journal | author = Cooper WO, Hernandez-Diaz S, Arbogast PG, Dudley JA, Dyer S, Gideon PS, Hall K, Ray WA | title = Major congenital malformations after first-trimester exposure to ACE inhibitors | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 354 | issue = 23 | pages = 2443–51 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16760444 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa055202 | last2 = Hernandez-Diaz | last3 = Arbogast | first3 = PG | first2 = S }}</ref>

A combination of ACE inhibitor with other drugs may increase effects of these drugs, but also the risk of adverse effects.<ref name="Sidorenkov & Navis 2014"/> The commonly reported adverse effects of drug combination with ACE are acute renal failure, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. The drugs interacting with ACE inhibitor should be prescribed with caution. Special attention should be given to combinations of ACE inhibitor with other RAAS blockers, [[diuretics]] (especially potassium-sparing diuretics), NSAIDs, [[anticoagulants]], [[cyclosporine]], [[DPP-4 inhibitors]], and [[potassium supplements]].

Potassium supplementation should be used with caution and under medical supervision owing to the [[hyperkalemia|hyperkalemic]] effect of ACE inhibitors.<ref name="pmid11044229">{{cite journal | author = Bakris GL, Siomos M, Richardson D, Janssen I, Bolton WK, Hebert L, Agarwal R, Catanzaro D | title = ACE inhibition or angiotensin receptor blockade: impact on potassium in renal failure.

==Examples==
ACE inhibitors are easily identifiable by their common suffix, '-pril'. ACE inhibitors can be divided into three groups based on their molecular structure:

===Sulfhydryl-containing agents===
* [[Captopril]] (trade name Capoten), the first ACE inhibitor
* [[Zofenopril]]

===Dicarboxylate-containing agents===
This is the largest group, including:
* [[Enalapril]] (Vasotec/Renitec)
* [[Ramipril]] (Altace/Prilace/Ramace/Ramiwin/Triatec/Tritace)
* [[Quinapril]] (Accupril)
* [[Perindopril]] (Coversyl/Aceon/Perindo)
* [[Lisinopril]] (Listril/Lopril/Novatec/Prinivil/Zestril)
* [[Benazepril]] (Lotensin)
* [[Imidapril]] (Tanatril)
* [[Trandolapril]] (Mavik/Odrik/Gopten)
* [[Cilazapril]] (Inhibace)

===Phosphonate-containing agents===
* [[Fosinopril]] (Fositen/Monopril) is the only member of this group

===Naturally occurring===
* Caso[[kinin]]s and lactokinins, breakdown products of [[casein]] and [[whey]], occur naturally after ingestion of [[milk]] products, especially [[cultured milk]]. Their role in blood pressure control is uncertain.<ref name="FitzGerald2004">{{cite journal | author = FitzGerald RJ, Murray BA, Walsh DJ | title = Hypotensive peptides from milk proteins | journal = The Journal of nutrition | volume = 134 | issue = 4 | pages = 980S–8S | year = 2004 | pmid = 15051858 | last2 = Murray | last3 = Walsh | first3 = DJ | first2 = BA }}</ref>
* The [[lactotripeptides]] Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro produced by the [[probiotic]] ''[[Lactobacillus helveticus]]'' or derived from [[casein]] have been shown to have ACE-inhibiting and antihypertensive functions.<ref name="pmid16093403">{{cite journal | author = Aihara K, Kajimoto O, Hirata H, Takahashi R, Nakamura Y | title = Effect of powdered fermented milk with Lactobacillus helveticus on subjects with high-normal blood pressure or mild hypertension | journal = Journal of the American College of Nutrition | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 257–65 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16093403 | doi = 10.1080/07315724.2005.10719473 }}</ref><ref name="pmid19061526"/>
* A comprehensive resource on anti-hypertensive peptides is available in form of a database. It contain around 1700 unique antihypertensive peptide <ref name="pmid25392419">{{cite journal | author = Kumar R, Chaudhary K, Sharma M, Nagpal G, Chauhan JS, Singh S, Gautam A, Raghava GP | title = AHTPDB: a comprehensive platform for analysis and presentation of antihypertensive peptides | journal = Nucleic Acids Res. | volume = 14 | issue =1 4 | pages = D956-62 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25392419 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gku1141 }}</ref><ref name="pmid25392419" />

==Comparative information==
All ACE inhibitors have similar antihypertensive efficacy when equivalent doses are administered. The main differences lie with [[captopril]], the first ACE inhibitor. Captopril has a shorter duration of action and an increased incidence of adverse effects. It is also the only ACE inhibitor capable of passing through the [[blood–brain barrier]], although the significance of this characteristic has not been shown to have any positive clinical effects.

In a large clinical study, one of the agents in the ACE inhibitor class, [[ramipril]] (Altace), demonstrated an ability to reduce the mortality rates of patients suffering from a [[myocardial infarction]], and to slow the subsequent development of heart failure. This finding was made after it was discovered that regular use of ramipril reduced mortality rates even in test subjects not having suffered from hypertension.<ref>http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/430926 "Debate: Do ACE Inhibitors Have Unique Properties, Beyond Their Antihypertensive Effect?"</ref>

Some believe ramipril's additional benefits may be shared by some or all drugs in the ACE-inhibitor class. However, ramipril currently remains the only ACE inhibitor for which such effects are actually evidence-based.<ref>{{cite journal | author =  | title = The Acute Infarction Ramipril Efficacy (AIRE) Study Investigators | journal = Lancet | volume = 342 | issue = 8875 | pages = 821–8 | date = October 1993 | pmid = 8104270 | doi = 10.1016/0140-6736(93)92693-N | url =  }}</ref>

A meta-analysis confirmed that ACE inhibitors are effective and certainly the first-line choice in hypertension treatment. This meta-analysis was based on 20 trials and a cohort of 158 998 patients, of whom 91% were hypertensive. ACE inhibitors were used as the active treatment in seven trials (n=76 615) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in 13 trials (n=82 383).
ACE inhibitors were associated with a statistically significant 10% mortality reduction: (HR 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84-0.97; P=0.004). In contrast, no significant mortality reduction was observed with ARB treatment (HR 0.99; 95% CI, 0.94-1.04; P=0.683). Analysis of mortality reduction by different ACE inhibitors showed that perindopril-based regimens are associated with a statistically significant 13% all-cause mortality reduction.
Taking into account the broad spectrum of the hypertensive population, one might expect that an effective treatment with ACE inhibitors, in particular with [[perindopril]], would result in an important gain of lives saved.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22511654 Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce mortality in hypertension: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors involving 158 998 patients.

==Angiotensin II receptor antagonists==
ACE inhibitors possess many common characteristics with another class of cardiovascular drugs, [[angiotensin II receptor antagonist]]s, which are often used when patients are intolerant of the adverse effects produced by ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors do not completely prevent the formation of angiotensin II, as blockage is dose-dependent, so angiotensin II receptor antagonists may be useful because they act to prevent the action of angiotensin II at the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor, leaving AT<sub>2</sub> receptor unblocked; the latter may have consequences needing further study.

===Use in combination===
The combination therapy of angiotensin II receptor antagonists with ACE inhibitors may be superior to either agent alone. This combination may increase levels of bradykinin while blocking the generation of angiotensin II and its activity at the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor. This 'dual blockade' may be more effective than using an ACE inhibitor alone, because angiotensin II can be generated via non-ACE-dependent pathways. Preliminary studies suggest this combination of pharmacologic agents may be advantageous in the treatment of [[essential hypertension]], chronic [[heart failure]],<ref name="dimopoulos">{{cite journal | author = Dimopoulos K, Salukhe TV, Coats AJ, Mayet J, Piepoli M, Francis DP | title = Meta-analyses of mortality and morbidity effects of an angiotensin receptor blocker in patients with chronic heart failure already receiving an ACE inhibitor (alone or with a beta-blocker) | journal = Int J Cardiol | volume = 92 | issue = 2 | pages = 105–111 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14975535 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijcard.2003.10.001 }}</ref> and [[nephropathy]].<ref name="Luno2005">{{cite journal | author = Luno J, Praga M, de Vinuesa SG | title = The reno-protective effect of the dual blockade of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) | journal = Current pharmaceutical design | volume = 11 | issue = 10 | pages = 1291–300 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15853685 | doi = 10.2174/1381612053507413 | last2 = Praga | last3 = De Vinuesa | first3 = SG | first2 = M }}</ref><ref name="vandeWal2005">{{cite journal | author = van de Wal RM, van Veldhuisen DJ, van Gilst WH, Voors AA | title = Addition of an angiotensin receptor blocker to full-dose ACE-inhibition: controversial or common sense? | journal = [[European Heart Journal]] | volume = 26 | issue = 22 | pages = 2361–7 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16105846 | doi = 10.1093/eurheartj/ehi454 | last2 = Van Veldhuisen | last3 = Van Gilst | first3 = WH | first2 = DJ }}</ref> However, the more recent ONTARGET study showed no benefit of combining the agents and more adverse events.<ref>http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0801317</ref> While statistically significant results have been obtained for its role in treating hypertension, clinical significance may be lacking.<ref name="Finnegan2003">{{cite journal | author = Finnegan PM, Gleason BL | title = Combination ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers for hypertension | journal = Annals of Pharmacotherapy | volume = 37 | issue = 6 | pages = 886–9 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12773079 | doi = 10.1345/aph.1C393 | last2 = Gleason | first2 = BL }}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|ACE inhibitors drug design}}

The first step in the development of ACE inhibitors was the discovery of ACE in [[blood plasma|plasma]] by [[Leonard T. Skeggs]] and his colleagues in 1956. Brazilian scientist [[Sérgio Henrique Ferreira]] reported a bradykinin-potentiating factor (BPF) present in the venom of ''[[Bothrops jararaca]]'', a South American pit viper, in 1965.<ref name="pmid14302350">{{cite journal | author = Ferreira SH | title = A bradykinin-potentiating factor (bpf) present in the venom of bothrops jararaca | journal = Br J Pharmacol Chemother | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 163–9 | date = February 1965 | pmid = 14302350 | pmc = 1704050 | doi = 10.1111/j.1476-5381.1965.tb02091.x | url =  }}</ref> Ferreira then went to [[John Vane]]'s laboratory as a postdoctoral fellow with his already-isolated BPF. The conversion of the inactive angiotensin I to the potent angiotensin II was thought to take place in the plasma. However, in 1967, [[Kevin K. F. Ng]] and [[John R. Vane]] showed plasma ACE is too slow to account for the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II ''in vivo''. Subsequent investigation showed rapid conversion occurs during its passage through the pulmonary circulation.<ref name="Kevin">{{cite journal | author = Ng KK, Vane JR | title = Conversion of Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II | journal = Nature | volume = 216 | issue = 5117 | pages = 762–6 | year = 1967 | pmid = 4294626 | doi = 10.1038/216762a0 }}</ref>

Bradykinin is rapidly inactivated in the circulating blood, and it disappears completely in a single pass through the pulmonary circulation. Angiotensin I also disappears in the pulmonary circulation because of its conversion to angiotensin II. Furthermore, angiotensin II passes through the lungs without any loss. The inactivation of bradykinin and the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in the lungs was thought to be caused by the same enzyme.<ref name="Kevin2">{{cite journal | author = Ng KK, Vane JR | title = Fate of Angiotensin I in the Circulation | journal = Nature | volume = 218 | issue = 5137 | pages = 144–50 | year = 1968 | pmid = 4296306 | doi = 10.1038/218144a0 }}</ref> In 1970, Ng and Vane, using BPF provided by Ferreira, showed the conversion is inhibited during its passage through the pulmonary circulation.<ref name="Kevin3">{{cite journal | author = Ng KK, Vane JR | title = Some Properties of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme in the Lung in vivo | journal = Nature | volume = 225 | issue = 5238 | pages = 1142–4 | year = 1970 | pmid = 4313869 | doi = 10.1038/2251142b0 }}</ref>

BPFs are members of a family of peptides whose potentiating action is linked to inhibition of bradykinin by ACE. Molecular analysis of BPF yielded a nonapeptide BPF [[teprotide]] (SQ 20,881), which showed the greatest ACE inhibition potency and hypotensive effect ''in vivo''. Teprotide had limited clinical value as a result of its peptide nature and lack of activity when given orally. In the early 1970s, knowledge of the structure-activity relationship required for inhibition of ACE was growing. [[David Cushman]], [[Miguel Ondetti]] and colleagues used peptide analogues to study the structure of ACE, using carboxypeptidase A as a model. Their discoveries led to the development of captopril, the first orally-active ACE inhibitor, in 1975.

Captopril was approved by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] in 1981. The first nonsulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitor, enalapril, was marketed two years later. At least 12 other ACE inhibitors have since been marketed.

In 1991, Japanese scientists created the first milk-based ACE inhibitor, in the form of a fermented milk drink, using specific cultures to liberate the [[tripeptide]] [[isoleucine]]-[[proline]]-proline (IPP) from the dairy protein. [[Valine]]-proline-proline (VPP) is also liberated in this process—another milk tripeptide with a very similar chemical structure to IPP. Together, these peptides are now often referred to as [[lactotripeptides]]. In 1996, the first human study confirmed the blood pressure-lowering effect of IPP in fermented milk.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hata Y, Yamamoto M, Ohni M, Nakajima K, Nakamura Y, Takano T | title = A placebo-controlled study of the effect of sour milk on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects | journal = The American journal of clinical nutrition | volume = 64 | issue = 5 | pages = 767–71 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8901799 | last2 = Yamamoto | last3 = Ohni | first3 = M | first2 = M }}</ref> Although twice the amount of VPP is needed to achieve the same ACE-inhibiting activity as the originally discovered IPP, VPP also is assumed to add to the total blood pressure lowering effect.<ref name="pmid7673515">{{cite journal | author = Nakamura Y, Yamamoto N, Sakai K, Takano T | title = Antihypertensive effect of sour milk and peptides isolated from it that are inhibitors to angiotensin I-converting enzyme | journal = [[Journal of Dairy Science]] | volume = 78 | issue = 6 | pages = 1253–7 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7673515 | doi = 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(95)76745-5 | last3 = Sakai | last2 = Yamamoto | first2 = N | first3 = K }}</ref>
Since the first lactotripeptides discovery, more than 20 human clinical trials have been conducted in many different countries.<ref name="pmid19061526">{{cite journal | author = Boelsma E, Kloek J | title = Lactotripeptides and antihypertensive effects: a critical review | journal = The British journal of nutrition | volume = 101 | issue = 6 | pages = 776–86 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19061526 | doi = 10.1017/S0007114508137722 | last2 = Kloek | first2 = J }}</ref>
