The second strain was a group of dogs from a kennel in<space/><link><target>Kabul</target></link><space/>owned by Mrs. Mary Amps, which she shipped to England in 1925. She and her husband came to Kabul after the Afghan war in 1919, and the foundation sire of her kennel (named Ghazni) in Kabul was a dog that closely resembled Zardin. Her<space/><italics>Ghazni strain</italics><space/>were the more heavily coated mountain type. Most of the Afghans in the United States were developed from the Ghazni strain from England. The first Afghans in Australia were imported from the United States in 1934, also of the Ghazni strain.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.aniwa.com/en/chien/document/en/chien/magazine/discover/dog-breeds/afghan-hound--from-the-streets-of-kabul-to-the-main-rings-of-the-world/index.htm'>Chien Magazine Afghan Hound history</link><space/><template><target>wayback</target><arg name="url">http://www.aniwa.com/en/chien/document/en/chien/magazine/discover/dog-breeds/afghan-hound--from-the-streets-of-kabul-to-the-main-rings-of-the-world/index.htm<space/></arg><arg name="date">20090513043515<space/></arg></template></extension><space/>The French breed club was formed in 1939 (FALAPA).

The coat may be any colour, but white markings, particularly on the head, are discouraged; many individuals have a<space/><link><target>melanistic mask</target><part>black facial mask</part></link>. A specimen may have facial hair that looks like a<space/><link><target>Fu Manchu moustache</target></link>. The moustache is called &quot;mandarins.&quot; Some Afghan Hounds are almost white, but parti-colour hounds (white with islands of red or black) are not acceptable and may indicate impure breeding. The long, fine-textured coat requires considerable care and grooming. The long topknot and the shorter-haired saddle on the back of the dog are distinctive features of the Afghan Hound coat. The high hipbones and unique small ring on the end of the tail are also characteristics of the breed.</paragraph><paragraph>The temperament of the typical Afghan Hound can be aloof and dignified, but happy and clownish when it's playing. This breed, as is the case with many sighthounds, has a high prey drive and may not get along with small animals. The Afghan Hounds' reasoning skills have made it a successful competitor in dog agility trials as well as an intuitive therapy dog and companion.

If not corrected through surgery, chylothorax can ultimately cause fibrosing pleuritis, or a hardening of the organs, due to scar tissue forming around the organs to protect them from the chyle fluid.
