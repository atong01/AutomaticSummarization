{{Politics of Egypt}}
'''Foreign relations of the [[Arab Republic of Egypt]]''' are the Egyptian government's external relations with the outside world. Egypt's foreign policy operates along a non-aligned level. Factors such as population size, historical events, military strength, diplomatic expertise and a strategic geographical position give Egypt extensive political influence in the [[Middle East]], [[Africa]], and within the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] as a whole. [[Cairo]] has been a crossroads of the [[Arab world]]'s commerce and culture for centuries, and its intellectual and [[Islam]]ic institutions are at the center of the region's social and cultural landmarks.

==Middle East and North Africa==

===Relations with Africa===
In the 21st-century Egypt has encountered a major problem with immigration, as millions of Africans attempt to enter Egypt fleeing poverty and war.  Border control methods can be "harsh, sometimes lethal." This has strained relations with Egypt's southern neighbors, and with Israel and the members of the EU as these immigrants attempt to move on to wealthier countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Desperate on the Border|author=Soussi, Alasdair|publisher=Jerusalem Report|date=November 9, 2008|url= http://www.jpost.com/JerusalemReport/Article.aspx?id=119897|accessdate=September 30, 2012}}</ref>

Egypt currently disputes sovereignty of the [[Hala'ib Triangle]] with [[Sudan]], an area of land located on the [[Red Sea]] coast, between the political borders (at the [[22nd parallel north|22nd circle of latitude]]) and the administrative boundary between the two countries.

===Arab relations===
The [[Arab League]] headquarters is in [[Cairo]], and the Secretary General of the League is traditionally an Egyptian. Former [[Egyptian Foreign Minister]] [[Nabil Elaraby|Nabil Araby]] is the present Secretary General of the Arab League. [[Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] served as Secretary General of the United Nations from 1991 to 1996.

Egypt is on good terms with [[Libya]], its western neighbor.

Egypt has fairly good relations with [[Sudan]], its southern neighbor, although it has a land dispute with Sudan over the [[Hala'ib Triangle]], a small area of land on the Egypt-Sudan border on the [[Red Sea]] coast. Sudan claims the area. Egypt's policy on Sudan is that it is in favor of a united Sudan. As such Egypt was not directly involved in the Sudan Peace Process that was hosted in Kenya under the auspices of [[IGAD]] and that gave the peoples of south Sudan the right to secede and form an independent state in 2011 after the long and brutal Sudanese civil war that cumulatively lasted more than 40 years and claimed over 2 million lives.

===Israeli-Palestinian conflict===
Egypt has been seeking to play a role in the resolution of the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]].

Egypt played an important role in the negotiations leading to the [[Madrid Conference of 1991]], which, under [[United States]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] sponsorship, brought together all parties in the region, including for the first time a Palestinian delegation, to discuss Middle East peace.

This support has continued to the present, with President [[Hosni Mubarak]] often intervening personally to promote peace negotiations. In 1996, he hosted the Sharm El-Sheikh "Summit of the Peacemakers" attended by President [[Bill Clinton]] and other world leaders.

In 2000, he hosted two summits at [[Sharm El-Sheikh]] and one at [[Taba Summit|Taba]] in an effort to resume the Camp David negotiations suspended in July 2000, and in June 2003, Mubarak hosted President [[George W. Bush]] for another summit on Middle East peace process. Another summit was convened in Sharm El Sheik in early 2005, which was attended by Egypt, [[Israel]], the [[Palestinian Authority]] and [[Jordan]]. The [[Egyptian Chief of Intelligence]], General [[Omar Suleiman]], has played a substantial role in negotiations between the Israeli and Palestinian sides and is highly respected on both sides.

==={{Flag|Iran}}===
{{main|Egypt–Iran relations}}
In 1939, diplomatic relations between Egypt and [[Iran]] were upgraded to ambassadorial level, and [[Youssef Zulficar Pasha]] was appointed as Egypt's first ambassador in [[Tehran]]. In the same year, [[Princess Fawzia Fuad of Egypt|Princess Fawzia]] of Egypt, the sister of [[Farouk of Egypt|King Farouk I]], married [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], the then crown prince (later shah) of Iran. However, since the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Islamic Revolution]], Egypt's relations with Iran have been mostly strained. Egypt is the only Arab country not to have an embassy in Iran.<ref>[http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2009/07/02/77608.html Ahmadinejad unwelcome in Egypt: lawyer], Al Arabiya. July 2, 2009</ref> Contentious issues include Egypt's signing of the [[Camp David Accords]] with [[Israel]] in 1979, its support for [[Iraq]] in [[Iran-Iraq War|Iran's eight-year conflict]], the Islamic Republic's hailing of [[Khalid Islambouli]], the late [[President of Egypt|President]] [[Anwar Sadat]]'s assassin as a religious hero, seeing as there was both a street and mural named after him (however, the honorer was changed to [[Muhammad al-Durrah]], the 12-year-old [[Palestinian Arab|Palestinian]] boy shot and killed during the outset of the Second Intifada), and close Egyptian relations with the [[United States]], and most of the [[Western Europe]]an countries. In 2007, relations between the two have thawed in the fields of diplomacy and economic trade, only to collapse during the [[2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict]] when the Iranian and Egyptian politicians exchanged blames over inaction towards the escalation. Despite wavering tensions between [[Tehran]] and [[Cairo]], the two countries are members of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|OIC]] and the [[Developing 8]]

In 2010, leaked diplomatic cables revealed that Mubarak expressed animosity toward Iran in private meetings, saying the Iranian leaders are "big, fat liars", and that Iran's backing of terrorism is "well-known".<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2010/nov/29/world/la-fg-wikileaks-arabs-20101130 WikiLeaks: Diplomatic cables show Egyptian leader's acrimony with Iran], LA Times, November 29, 2010</ref> According to one American report, Mubarak views Iran as the primary long-term challenge facing Egypt, and an Egyptian official said that Iran is running agents inside Egypt in an effort to subvert the Egyptian regime. he also stated that if Iran will reach a nuclear weapons, Egypt will also consider reaching such weapons.<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704457604576011643624083766.html?mod=googlenews_wsj Iran, Israel and the Arab Contradiction], by Ronen Bergman, Wall Street Journal, December 11, 2010</ref>

==={{Flag|Iraq}}===
{{main|Egypt-Iraq relations}}

Since 1983, Iraq has repeatedly called for restoration of Egypt’s “natural role” among Arab countries.  In January 1984, Iraq successfully led Arab efforts within the OIC to restore Egypt’s membership.  However, Iraqi-Egyptian relations were broken in 1990 after Egypt joined the UN coalition that forced Iraq out of Kuwait. Relations have steadily improved in recent years, and Egypt is now one of Iraq’s main trade partners (formerly under the [[Oil-for-Food Programme]]).

==={{Flag|Israel}}===
{{main|Egypt–Israel relations}}

The state of war between both countries which dated back from the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] ended in 1973 with the [[Egyptian–Israeli Peace Treaty]] a year after the [[Camp David Accords]]. Since then, relations have improved. Egypt has an embassy in [[Tel Aviv]] and a general consulate in [[Eilat]]. Israel has an embassy in [[Cairo]] and a general consulate in [[Alexandria]].

Being a pioneer of peace making in the region and driven from its belief that a peaceful Middle East is the best solution for the development of Egypt, the third [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]] [[Anwar Sadat]]'s groundbreaking trip to [[Israel]] in 1977, the 1978 [[Camp David Accords]], and the 1979 [[Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty]] represented a fundamental shift in the politics of the region; from a strategy of confrontation to one of peace as a strategic choice. Egypt was subsequently ostracized by other Arab states and ejected from the [[Arab League]] from 1979 to 1989.

However, due to circumstances of today's [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], full normalization of relations between these two countries is still halted and sometimes fought against in both countries. The Egyptian ambassador to Tel Aviv is often withdrawn, and the peace has been called a cool peace due to the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]].

==={{Flag|Jordan}}===
Diplomatic relations between the Egyptian and Jordanian government existed since Jordan became independent in 1946. On April 6, 1972 the Egyptian government severed relations in protest for a Jordanian plan for federation with the West Bank, which didn't take PLO interests unto considerations. These relations were restored on September 11, 1973.<ref>[http://aad.archives.gov/aad/createpdf?rid=68652&dt=2472&dl=1345 US diplomatic cable on the resumption of relations]</ref> They were severed again in 1979, this time by the Jordanian government, in protest for the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty. Following the outbreak of the Lebanon War of 1982, the US government put pressure on both governments to reach accommodation for the purpose of formulating a joint peace strategy vis-a-vis the Israeli government,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=39523&st=&st1=|title=Ronald Reagan: Remarks of President Reagan, President Mohammed Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, and King Hussein I of Jordan Following Their Meetings|publisher=|accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref> and relations were restored on September 25, 1984.

==={{Flag|Libya}}===
{{main|Egypt–Libya relations}}

After the neighboring countries of Egypt and [[Libya]] both gained independence in the early 1950s, relations were initially cooperative. Libya assisted Egypt in the [[1973 Arab-Israeli War]]. Later, tensions arose due to Egypt's rapprochement with the west.<ref name=rabinivich>{{cite book

==={{Flag|Somalia}}===
{{main|Egypt–Somalia relations}}

Relations between the territories of present-day Egypt and [[Somalia]] stretch back to antiquity.<ref name="Aroemofa">{{cite web|title=Somalia - Brief History|url=http://www.mfa.gov.eg/English/EgyptianForeignPolicy/EgyptianArabRelation/BilateralRelations/Somalia/Pages/History.aspx|publisher=Arab Republic of Egypt, Ministry of Foreign Affairs|accessdate=14 December 2014}}</ref> In the Middle Ages and early modern era, the various [[Somali aristocratic and court titles|Somali Sultanates]] also maintained close relations with their counterparts in Egypt.<ref>P. L. Shinnie, ''The African Iron Age'', (Clarendon Press: 1971), p.135</ref>

During the ensuing colonial period, Egypt and Somalia kept close ties through the UN delegate to Somalia Kamal El Din Salah, who supported the territorial integrity of the Somali territories. Upon independence of the Somali Republic in 1960, Egypt was among the first nations to recognize the nascent country.<ref name="Aroemofa"/> In 1969, Egypt and Somalia were among the founding members of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC). Both nations are also members of the [[League of Arab States]].

After the start of the civil war in Somalia in 1991, Egypt maintained diplomatic relations with the [[Transitional National Government]] and its successor the [[Transitional Federal Government]], and supported their state-building initiatives. As part of the International Contact Group, the Egyptian authorities participated in various global summits in support of the Somalian peace process, including the Khartoum Conference in 2006, the Djibouti Conference in 2008, and the Cairo Conference in 2010.<ref name="Aroemofa"/>

The subsequent establishment of the [[Federal Government of Somalia]] in August 2012 was welcomed by the Egyptian authorities, who re-affirmed Egypt's continued support for Somalia's government, its territorial integrity and sovereignty.<ref name="Cosgmsos">{{cite web|title=Communiqué on Secretary-General’s Mini-Summit on Somalia|url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2012/sg2187.doc.htm|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref>

==={{Flag|Sudan}}===
{{main|Egypt-Sudan relations}}

Egypt and Sudan have enjoyed intimate and longstanding historical ties, seeing as they are each other's closest allies in the [[North Africa]]n region. The two countries are connected by various cultural ties, and political aspirations.Sudan showed great solidarity with Egypt in its [[Camp David]] peace initiatives with [[Israel]] in the late 1970s. In 2008, Egyptian Prime Minister [[Ahmed Nazif]] urged the two countries to focus on two specific projects: the [[Aljazera project]] which aims to cultivate some two million acres (8,000&nbsp;km²) of land in Sudan, and a joint project to improve food security in agricultural and meat production.

==Europe and the Americas==

===European Union===

[[European Union]] relations with Egypt are based on a partnership relation within the Euro – Mediterranean and Middle East area, which is of vital strategic importance and a key external relations priority for the EU.<br>
The [[Euro-Mediterranean Partnership]] launched at the [[1995 Barcelona Conference]] between the European Union and its originally 12 [[Mediterranean]] Partners: [[Algeria]], [[Cyprus]], [[Egypt]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Malta]], [[Morocco]], [[Syria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Turkey]], and the [[Palestinian Authority]]. [[Libya]] currently has observer status at certain meetings. Since the enlargement, in May 2004 and January 2007, the co-operation covers 35 countries, the EU of 27, including [[Cyprus]] and [[Malta]] and the 10 Mediterranean Partners.

Egypt has also taken an active role regarding Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, such as its participation in the technical meeting of which it was the speaker for the Arab group. Additionally, the first meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary assembly was co-chaired by an Egyptian.

[[Egypt]] has been one of the leading recipients among the Mediterranean partners in terms of total funds received from the [[MEDA programme]], the principal financial instrument of the European Union for the implementation of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. It is focused on policy-led, national structural reform and liberalisation programmes with a sector-wide approach.

The EU is Egypt’s biggest trading partner currently accounting for 42% of Egyptian exports and 37% of imports, with the [[balance of trade]] still in the EU's favour. Trade between the EU and Egypt has risen by more than 5% in the last five years to reach around 11.6 billion euro in 2004. Egypt’s main exports to the EU in 2004 were energy (39%), textiles and clothing (15%), agricultural products (9%), and chemicals (5%). Major imports from the EU were power generating machinery (21%), chemicals (16%), transport equipment (16%), and food and agricultural products (10%). Egypt has a serious but improving trade deficit that has put considerable pressure on the [[Egyptian pound]].

Trade relations with the EU are good although there are several outstanding trade and phyto-sanitary issues. These range from specific market access issues and difficulties for businesses facing a highly regulated and complex system through to restrictions in the export of agricultural goods (potatoes) and fishery products because they do not conform with EU quality norms.

Egypt is included in the European Union's [[European Neighbourhood Policy]] (ENP) which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer.

Some time after the starting of the [[Arab Spring]], in March 2011 the [[European Union]] adopted the joint declaration ‘ A partnership for democracy and shared prosperity with the Southern Mediterranean', aimed at making a number of initiatives in the field of civic society support, financial assistance and further access to the EU market dependent upon advancement in the democratization process.<ref>http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/where/neighbourhood/arab_spring/index_en.htm</ref>

As far as Egypt was concerned this declaration envisioned the further deepening of the previous Free Trade Agreement stipulated in 2004, geared towards the inclusion of areas such as trade in services, government procurement, competition, intellectual property rights, and investment protection. To the 2011 declaration, a preliminary phase of the negotiations followed in June 2013, when the EU and [[Egypt]] began an exploratory dialogue on how to deepen trade and investment relations, in particular through the possible negotiation of a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tax-news.com/news/EU_Seeks_To_Resume_Talks_On_DCFTA_With_Egypt____63682.html|title=EU Seeks To Resume Talks On DCFTA With Egypt|publisher=|accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref>

Following the bloody crackdown in August 2014, [[European Union]] discussed the possibility of revising provision of aid to [[Egypt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/19/us-egypt-protests-eu-idUSBRE97I0PU20130819|title=EU foreign ministers to discuss how to press Egypt over bloodshed|work=Reuters|accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref>  However, divisions over the appropriate stance to adopt among European diplomats persisted, coupled by the fear that the vacuum might be soon filled by other actors, following a Saudi Foreign Minister's declaration that the Kingdom was ready to step in<ref name="bbc.co.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23782685|title=BBC News - EU suspends arms sales to Egypt over crackdown|work=BBC News|accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref> and those of Prime Minister Hazem al Beblawi about the possibility to appeal to Russia for foreign aid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/08/201382153414138265.html|title=Egypt PM defiant on threat of aid cut|publisher=|accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref>  Therefore, the only measure upon which the Foreign Ministers agreed was to suspend the sale of arms and materials that could be used for repression,<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/> but fell short to halt aid program which could damage civil society.

Earlier in July 2013, EU High Representative [[Catherine Ashton]] had visited Egypt in an attempt to promote reconciliation among the parties involved. She is credited for being the only foreign diplomat to get access to deposed president Mohamed Morsy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/aug/04/baroness-ashton-morsi-secret-meeting|title=How Baroness Ashton engineered a secret meeting at dead of night with Morsi|author=Elizabeth Day|work=the Guardian|accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref>
In an official statement released at the end of a following visit held in April 2014, the Representative raised the issue of the death penalties and incarceration of journalists and activists.<ref>http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/egypt/press_corner/all_news/news/2014/20140411_en.pdf</ref>  At the same time, her declarations about former general al Sisi’s bid for candidacy to the presidential elections as “difficult” but “brave”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://madamasr.com/content/eu-policy-chief-calls-sisi-presidential-bid-brave|title=EU policy chief calls Sisi presidential bid 'brave'|work=Mada Masr|accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref> sparked harsh criticism among supporters of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], who claimed the Representative, who advanced logistical reasons, did not make any efforts to get in touch with them and members of the Anti-Coup alliance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbulletin.net/haber/133487/egypts-anti-coup-bloc-slams-ashtons-sisi-visit|title=Egypt's anti-coup bloc slams Ashton's Sisi visit - Middle East -  Worldbulletin News|work=World Bulletin|accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref>

In April 2014 European Union agreed to conduct electoral monitoring, for the first time, in occasion of the Presidential elections scheduled for 26/27 May 2014. Other organizations declined to join, as in their opinion this would legitimize an unlawful take on power.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/04/eu-legitimising-sisi-coup-egypt-20144161181767834.html|title=Is the EU legitimising Sisi's coup?|author=Alastair Sloan|publisher=|accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref>

|{{flag|United States}}||<!--Start Date-->1882 ||{{main|Egypt–United States relations}}

After the [[1973 Arab-Israeli War]], Egyptian foreign policy began to shift as a result of the change in Egypt's leadership from President [[Gamal Abdel-Nasser]] to [[Anwar Sadat]] and the emerging peace process between Egypt and [[Israel]]. [[Sadat]] realized that reaching a settlement of the [[Arab-Israeli conflict]] is a precondition for Egyptian development. To achieve this goal, Sadat ventured to enhance US-Egyptian relations to foster a peace process with Israel. After a seven-year hiatus, both countries reestablished normal diplomatic relations on February 28, 1974.

====Military cooperation====
Following the peace treaty with Israel, between 1979 and 2003, the US has provided Egypt with about $19 billion in military aid, making Egypt the second largest non-NATO recipient of US military aid after Israel. Also, Egypt received about $30 billion in economic aid within the same time frame. In 2009, the US provided a military assistance of US$1.3 billion (inflation adjusted US$ {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1.3|2009|r=2}}}} billion in {{CURRENTISOYEAR}}), and an economic assistance of US$250 million (inflation adjusted US$ {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|250|2009|r=1}}}} million in {{CURRENTISOYEAR}}).<ref name="09CAIRO874">{{cite web |url=http://www.wikileaks.ch/cable/2009/05/09CAIRO874.html|title=Scenesetter:  President Mubarak's visit to Washington |date=2009-05-19|publisher=US Department of State}}</ref>
In 1989 both Egypt and Israel became a [[Major non-NATO ally]] of the United States.

Military cooperation between the US and Egypt is probably the strongest aspect of their strategic partnership. General [[Anthony Zinni]], the former Commandant of the [[US Central Command]] (CENTCOM), once said, "Egypt is the most important country in my area of responsibility because of the access it gives me to the region." Egypt was also described during the [[Clinton Administration]] as the most prominent player in the Arab world and a key US ally in the Middle East. US military assistance to Egypt was considered part of the administration's strategy to maintaining continued availability of Persian Gulf energy resources and to secure the Suez Canal, which serves both as an important international oil route and as critical route for US warships transiting between the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and either the [[Indian Ocean]] or the [[Persian Gulf]].

The Egyptian military provides indirect support for the foreign policy of Egypt in the region. Egypt is the strongest military power on the African continent, and according to Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies' annual Middle East Strategic Balance, the second largest in the Middle East, after Israel.

====War on Terror====
Despite differences and periods of friction in relations between the two countries, the US-Egyptian relations under Mubarak have evolved moving beyond the Middle East peace process towards an independent bilateral friendship. It was in the US interest that Egypt was able to present moderate voice in Arab councils and persuade other Arab states to join the peace process and to normalize their relations with the US.

However lately Egyptian-American relations have become a little tense. This is due to a great extent to the Egyptian unwillingness to send troops to Afghanistan and Iraq in peace stabilization missions. Egypt strongly backed the US in its war against international terrorism after the September 11 attacks, but refused to send troops to Afghanistan during the war and after it. Egypt also opposed US military intervention of March 2003 in Iraq, continued to oppose US occupation of the country after the war and further refused to comply with US requests to send troops to the country even under a UN umbrella.

The issue of participation in the post-war construction efforts in Iraq has been controversial in Egypt and in the Arab world as a whole. Opponents say that the war was illegal and it is necessary to wait until Iraq has legal representative government to deal with it. On the other hand, supporters of participation argued that the responsibility to protect Iraqis and to help them in time of crisis should prevail and guide the Egyptian action in [[Iraq]], despite the fact that the Iraqis do not agree.

====Post-Mubarak relations with U.S.====
On January 21, 2012, the [[United States Secretary of Transportation|U.S. Secretary of Transportation]] [[Ray LaHood]]'s son, Sam, was detained by the Egyptian government and not allowed to leave the country as part of a politically charged criminal investigation by the Egyptian government into the activities of [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organizations (NGOs)]] monitoring local elections in [[Egypt]]. LaHood's son is the Egypt director of the [[International Republican Institute]].  The Egyptian government has detained twelve NGO representatives from leaving Egypt.<ref>{{cite news |title=As Tensions Rise, Egypt Bars Exit of Six Americans |author=Steven Myers and David Kirkpatrick |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/27/world/middleeast/egypt-bars-son-of-ray-lahood-from-leaving.html |newspaper=New York Times |date=January 26, 2012 |accessdate=26 January 2012}}</ref>

On February 5, 2012, Egyptian authorities charged LaHood's son and 42 other individuals with "spending money from organizations that were operating in Egypt without a license."  Nineteen Americans are part of the 42 charged.  The U.S. government has made it clear that $1.5 billion in U.S. aid to Egypt could be withheld if the investigation is not finished quickly. Faiza Abu Naga, [[Ministry of International Cooperation (Egypt)|Egypt's Minister of International Cooperation]], is seen as the person pushing the investigation forward, straining U.S. and Egypt relations.<ref>{{Cite web | last = Londoño, Ernesto and William Wan | title = Egypt to prosecute Americans in NGO probe; Sam LaHood among those facing criminal charges| url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/egypt-to-prosecute-americans-in-ngo-probe/2012/02/05/gIQAQRderQ_story.html?tid=pm_pop | publisher = The Washington Post | date = 5 February 2012 | accessdate = 7 February 2012 }}</ref>

Modern Egypt-India relations go back to the contacts between [[Saad Zaghloul]] and [[Mohandas Gandhi]] on the common goals of their respective movements of independence. In 1955, Egypt under [[Gamal Abdul Nasser]] and India under [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] became the founders of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. During the 1956 War, Nehru stood supporting Egypt to the point of threatening to withdraw his country from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. In 1967, following the [[Arab-Israeli war]], India supported Egypt and the Arabs. In 1977, New Delhi described the visit of President [[Anwar al-Sadat]] to Jerusalem as a "brave" move and considered the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel a primary step on the path of a just settlement of the Middle East problem. Major Egyptian exports to India include raw cotton, raw and manufactured fertilizers, oil and oil products, organic and non-organic chemicals, leather and iron products. Major imports into Egypt from India are cotton yarn, sesame, coffee, herbs, tobacco and lentils. The Egyptian Ministry of Petroleum is also currently negotiating the establishment of a natural gas-operated fertilizer plant with another Indian company. In 2004 the [[Gas Authority of India Limited]], bought 15% of Egypt Nat Gas distribution and marketing company.

In 2008 Egyptian investment in India was worth some 750 million dollars, according to the Egyptian ambassador.<ref>Egypt State Information Service: [http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/Politics/Presidency/President/Activity/000001/0401050400000000000964.htm Mubarak starts historic visit to India to boost strategic partnership between the two countries]</ref>

==International involvement==
Egypt played a key role during the 1990-91 [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf crisis]]. President Mubarak helped assemble the international coalition and deployed 35,000 Egyptian troops against Iraq to liberate [[Kuwait]]. The Egyptian contingent was one of the largest in the coalition forces, along with the U.S., [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] and Saudi Arabia.

In the aftermath of the Gulf War, Egypt signed the [[Damascus Declaration]] with [[Syria]] and the Persian Gulf states to strengthen Persian Gulf security. Egypt continues to contribute regularly to [[United Nations]] [[peacekeeping]] missions, most recently in [[East Timor]], [[Sierra Leone]], and [[Liberia]].<br> Following the September 11, 2001 [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks]] on the United States, Egypt, which has itself been the target of terrorist attacks, has been a key supporter of the U.S. war against terrorists and terrorist organizations such as [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[al-Qaeda]], and has supported the Iraqi Governing Council.

On December 25, 2006, the Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Abul Gheit called for end to "nuclear double standards" where sanctions are imposed on [[Iran]] for enriching uranium, but the [[Israel and weapons of mass destruction#Nuclear weapons|Israeli nuclear program]] is not subject to any control by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]].<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20061225/wl_africa_afp/egyptirannuclear_061225175118] {{wayback|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20061225/wl_africa_afp/egyptirannuclear_061225175118 |date=20150613095211 }}</ref>
