Bush administration accelerated development and deployment of a system proposed in 1998 by the Clinton administration. The system is a dual purpose test and interception facility in Alaska, and in 2006 was operational with a few interceptor missiles. The Alaska site provides more protection against the<space/><link><target>Nuclear weapon</target><part>Nuclear threat</part></link><space/>from North Korean missiles or launches from Russia or China, but is likely less effective against missiles launched from the Middle East.

SCR-584's could be used to plot the trajectories of the missiles and provide some warning, but were more useful in backtracking their ballistic trajectory and determining the rough launch locations. The Allies launched<space/><link><target>Operation Crossbow</target></link><space/>to find and destroy V-2s before launch, but these operations were largely ineffective. In one instance a Spitfire happened upon a V-2 rising through the trees, and fired on it with no effect.<extension extension_name='ref' name="cav"></extension><space/>This led to allied efforts to advance over their launching sites in Belgium and the Netherlands.</paragraph><paragraph>A wartime study by Bell Labs into the task of shooting down ballistic missiles in flight concluded it was not possible. In order to intercept a missile, one needs to be able to steer the attack onto the missile before it hits. At the speeds the V-2 flew at, this required guns of effectively infinite reaction time, or some sort of weapon with ranges on the order of dozens of miles, neither of which appeared possible. This was, however, just prior to the emergence of high-speed computing systems in the 1950s. By the mid-1950s things had changed considerably, and many forces worldwide were considering ABM systems.</paragraph><paragraph>The American armed forces began experimenting with anti-missile missiles soon after World War II, as the extent of German research into rocketry became clear. But defences against Soviet long-range bombers took priority until 1957, when the Soviet Union demonstrated its advances in intercontinental ballistic missile technology with the launch of<space/><link><target>Sputnik program</target><part>Sputnik</part></link>, the Earth's first artificial satellite. The<space/><link><target>US Army</target></link><space/>accelerated development of their<space/><link><target>LIM-49 Nike Zeus</target></link><space/>system in response.

Zeus was eventually cancelled in 1963.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1958, a topic of research by the U.S. was the test explosions of several low yield<space/><link><target>nuclear weapon</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>at very high altitudes over the southern Atlantic ocean, launched from ships.

This proved not to be the case, but Argus returned key data about a related effect, the<space/><link><target>Nuclear electromagnetic pulse</target></link><space/>(NEMP).</paragraph><heading level='3'>Canada</heading><paragraph>Other countries were also involved in early ABM research. A more advanced project was at<space/><link><target>DRE Valcartier</target><part>CARDE</part></link><space/>in Canada, which researched the main problems of ABM systems. A key problem with any radar system is that the signal is in the form of a cone, which spreads with distance from the transmitter. For long-distance interceptions like ABM systems, the inherent inaccuracy of the radar makes an interception difficult. CARDE considered using a<space/><link><target>terminal guidance</target></link><space/>system to address the accuracy concerns, and developed several advanced<space/><link><target>infrared</target></link><space/>detectors for this role. They also studied a number of missile airframe designs, a new and much more powerful solid rocket fuel, and numerous systems for testing it all. After a series of drastic budget reductions during the late 1950s the research ended. One offshoot of the project was<space/><link><target>Gerald Bull</target></link>'s system for inexpensive high-speed testing, consisting of missile airframes shot from a<space/><link><target>sabot</target></link><space/>round, which would later be the basis of<space/><link><target>Project HARP</target></link>.

Among these were radars capable of scanning much greater volumes of space and able to track many warheads and launch several missiles at once.

Rather than use sophisticated large laser battle stations and nuclear-pumped X-ray laser satellites, Brilliant Pebbles consisted of a thousand very small, intelligent orbiting satellites with kinetic warheads. The system relied on improvements of computer technology, avoided problems with overly centralized command and control and risky, expensive development of large, complicated space defense satellites.It promised to be much less expensive to develop and have less technical development risk.</paragraph><paragraph>The name Brilliant Pebbles comes from the small size of the satellite interceptors and great computational power enabling more autonomous targeting. Rather than rely exclusively on ground-based control, the many small interceptors would cooperatively communicate among themselves and target a large swarm of ICBM warheads in space or in the late boost phase. Development was discontinued later in favor of a limited ground-based defense.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Transformation of SDI into MDA, development of NMD/GMD</heading><paragraph>While the Reagan era Strategic Defense Initiative was intended to shield against a massive Soviet attack, during the early 1990s, President<space/><link><target>George H.
