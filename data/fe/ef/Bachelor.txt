A '''bachelor''' is a man who is neither married nor dating and who lives independently outside of his parents' home or other institutional setting.{{refn|group=n|Bachelors are, in [[Richard Pitt|Pitt]] & al.'s phrasing, "men who live independently, outside of their parents' home and other institutional settings, who are neither married nor cohabitating".<ref>{{citation |last=Pitt |first=Richard |author2-last=Borland |author2-first=Elizabeth |display-authors=1 |ref={{harvid|Pitt & al.|2008}} |date=2008 |contribution-url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-180029368/bachelorhood-and-men-attitudes.html |contribution=Bachelorhood and Men's Attitudes about Gender Roles |title=The Journal of Men's Studies |volume=Vol.&nbsp;16 |pp=140–158 }}.</ref>}}

{{mergefrom|Eligible bachelor|date=April 2013}}
The word is first attested as the 12th-century ''bacheler'', a [[knight bachelor]], a [[knight]] too young or poor to gather vassals under [[knights banneret|his own banner]].<ref name=oed/> The [[Old French]] ''{{lang|ofr|bacheler}}'' presumably derives from [[Provençal language|Provençal]] ''{{lang|pro|bacalar}}'' and [[Italian language|Italian]] ''{{lang|it|baccalare}}'',<ref name=oed/> but the ultimate source of the word is uncertain.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}<ref name=oed>''Oxford English Dictionary'', 1st ed. "[www.oed.com/view/Entry/14313 bachelor, ''n.'']" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1885.</ref> The [[linguistic reconstruction|proposed]] [[Medieval Latin]] *''{{lang|la|baccalaris}}'' ("vassal", "field hand") is only attested late enough that it may have derived from the vernacular languages,<ref name=oed/> rather than from the southern French and northern Spanish Latin{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} ''{{lang|la|baccalaria}}'' ("cattle ranch", from ''{{lang|la|bacca}}'', "cow").<ref name=dc>{{citation |last=Cange |first=Charles du Fresne, sieur du |author-link=Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange |date=1733 |url=http://books.google.ch/books?id=no9IWJhHTxIC&pg=PA153-IA67 |title=? |pp=906–912 }}.</ref> Alternatively, it has been derived from Latin ''{{lang|la|baculum}}'' ("a stick"), in reference to the wooden sticks used by knights in training.{{refn|group=n|For further [[etymology|etymological]] discussion, with sources, see [[Uwe Friedrich Schmidt|Schmidt]],<ref>{{citation |last=Schmidt |first=Uwe Friedrich |contribution=Praeromanica Der Italoromania Auf Der Grundlage Des LEI (A und B) |title=Europäische Hochschulschriften |volume=Vol.&nbsp;49, No.&nbsp;9 }}. {{de icon}}</ref> reprinted by [[Peter Lang (publisher)|Lang]].<ref>{{citation |last=Schmidt |first=Uwe Friedrich |contribution=Praeromanica Der Italoromania Auf Der Grundlage Des LEI (A und B) |title=Italienische Sprache und Literatur |publisher=Peter Lang |date=2009 |contribution-url=http://books.google.ch/books?id=6OPrKYUOFvgC&pg=PA117 |pp=117–120 }}. {{de icon}}</ref>}}

From the 14th century, the term was also used for a junior member of a [[guild]] (otherwise known as "yeomen") or [[university]] and then for low-level ecclesiastics, as young [[monk]]s and recently appointed [[Canon (priest)|canon]]s.{{Refn|Severtius,<ref>Severtius, ''De Episcopis Lugdunensibus'', p.&nbsp;377</ref> cited in [[Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange|Du Cange]].<ref name=dc/>}} As an inferior grade of scholarship, it came to refer to one holding a "[[bachelor's degree]]". This sense of ''{{lang|la|baccalarius}}'' or ''{{lang|la|baccalaureus}}'' is first attested at the [[University of Paris]] in the 13th century in the system of degrees established under the auspices of [[Pope Gregory IX]] as applied to scholars still ''{{lang|la|in statu pupillari}}''. There were two classes of ''{{lang|la|baccalarii}}'': the ''{{lang|la|baccalarii cursores}}'', theological candidates passed for admission to the divinity course, and the ''{{lang|la|baccalarii dispositi}}'', who had completed the course and were entitled to proceed to the higher degrees.

In the [[Victorian era]], the term [[eligible bachelor]] was used in the context of [[upper class]] [[arranged marriage|matchmaking]], denoting a young man who was not only unmarried and eligible for marriage, but also considered "eligible" in financial and societal terms for the prospective bride under discussion. Also in the Victorian era, the term "confirmed bachelor" connoted a man who was resolute to remain unmarried.

By the later 19th century, the term "bachelor" had acquired the general sense of "unmarried man". The expression [[bachelor party]] is recorded 1882. In 1895, a feminine equivalent "bachelor-girl" was coined, replaced in US English by the somewhat humorous "[[bachelorette]]" by the mid-1930s. After [[World War II]], this terminology came to be seen as antiquated and has been mostly replaced by the gender-neutral term "[[single person|single]]" (first recorded 1964). In England and Wales, the term "bachelor" remained the official term used for the purpose of marriage registration until 2005, when it was abolished in favor of "single."<ref>{{cite news|title=R.I.P Bachelors and Spinsters|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4141996.stm|accessdate=8 April 2013|newspaper=BBC|date=14 September 2005}}</ref>

In certain [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|Gulf Arab]] countries, "bachelor" can refer to men who are single as well as immigrant men married to a spouse residing in their country of origin (due to the high added cost of sponsoring a spouse onsite),<ref>http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/general/hundreds-of-bachelors-crammed-in-squalid-and-dilapidated-buildings-1.194725</ref> and a colloquial term "executive bachelor" is also used in rental and sharing accommodation advertisements to indicate availability to [[white-collar worker|white-collar]] bachelors in particular.<ref>http://www.google.com/search?q=executive-bachelor</ref>

==History==
Bachelors have been subject to [[penal law]]s in many countries, most notably in [[Ancient Sparta|Sparta]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} At Sparta, men unmarried after a certain age were subject to various penalties ({{lang-grc-gre|ἀτιμία}}, ''atimía''): they were forbidden to watch women's gymnastics; during the winter, they were made to march naked through the [[agora]] singing a song about their dishonor;{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} and they were not provided with the traditional respect due to the elderly.<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Lyc''., 15.</ref> Some [[Ancient Athens|Athenian]] laws were similar.<ref>Schomann, ''Gr. Alterth.'', Vol.&nbsp;I, 548.</ref> Bachelors in Rome fell under the [[Lex Julia]] of 18&nbsp;{{sc|bc}} and the [[Lex Papia et Poppaea]] of {{sc|ad}}&nbsp;9: these lay heavy fines on unmarried or childless people while providing certain privileges to those with several children.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} In [[UK|Britain]], taxes occasionally fell heavier on bachelors than other persons: examples include 6 & 7 Will. III, the 1785 Tax on Servants, and the 1798 Income Tax.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} Over time, some punishments developed into no more than a teasing game. In some parts of [[Germany]], for instance, men who were still unmarried by their 30th birthday were made to sweep the stairs of the [[town hall]] until kissed by a "virgin".{{fact|date=October 2015}}
