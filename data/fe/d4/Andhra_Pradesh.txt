{{Main|History of Andhra Pradesh}}

The Andhras trace their history to the vedic age. Andhra was mentioned in the [[Sanskrit epics]] such as [[Aitareya Brahmana]] (800 [[BCE]]). According to [[Aitareya Brahmana]] of the Rig veda, Andhras left north India and settled in south India.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dance Dialects of India|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KRz5ykKRVAEC&pg=PA66&dq=Andhra+Trace+their+history&hl=en&sa=X&ei=lQeUU5qXNo2XyATjh4H4Dg&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Andhra%20Trace%20their%20history&f=false|work=Ragini Devi|publisher=Motilal Bansarsi Dass|ISBN=81-208-0674-3|accessdate=2014-06-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=History of Andhra Pradesh|url=http://www.aponline.gov.in/quick%20links/hist-cult/history.html|work=AP Online|publisher=[[Government of Andhra Pradesh]]|accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ancient and medieval history of Andhra Pradesh|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wENuAAAAMAAJ|work=P.

=== Early history ===

==== Satavahana empire ====
The Early [[Satavahanas]] ruled [[Coastal Andhra|Andhra]]. The puranas refer to [[Satavahanas]] as '''Andhra Bhrityas'''. The [[Puranas]] list 30 Andhra rulers. Many are known from their coins and inscriptions as well. Satavahanas made [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]] as their capital.<ref>{{cite book|title=History of the Andhras|url=http://www.katragadda.com/articles/HistoryOfTheAndhras.pdf|author=Durga Prasad|publisher=P.

'''Simuka (c. 230–207 [[BCE]])'''
After becoming independent around 230 [[BCE]], [[Simuka]], the founder of the dynasty, conquered the present-day [[Maharashtra]] and parts of [[Madhya Pradesh]] (including [[Malwa]]). He was succeeded by his brother [[Kanha]] (or Krishna) (r. 207–189 [[BCE]]), who further extended his state to the present day Andhra Pradesh. Later, Simuka made [[Srikakulam]]  his capital.<ref name="A Journey Through India's Past"/>

'''Satakarni (c. 180–124 [[BCE]])'''
[[File:Coin of Satkarni.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Early [[Satakarni]] issue, [[Maharashtra]] – [[Vidarbha]] type.]]
[[File:Satavahana1stCenturyBCECoinInscribedInBrahmi(Sataka)Nisa.jpg|thumb|200px|Satavahana 1 [[BCE]] coin inscribed in Brahmi: "(Sataka)Nisa". [[British Museum]]]]

His successor [[Satakarni|Sātakarnī I]] was the sixth ruler of the Satavahana. He is said to have ruled for 56 years. The [[Maurya Empire|Mauryans]] extended their rule over Andhra in the fourth century BCE. With the fall of the Maurya Empire in the third century [[BCE]], the [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahanas]] became independent. After the decline of the Satavahanas in 220 [[Common Era|CE]], the [[Ikshvaku dynasty]], [[Pallava]]s, [[Ananda Gotrika]]s, [[Rashtrakuta]]s, [[Vishnukundina]]s, [[Eastern Chalukyas]], and [[Chola Dynasty|Cholas]] ruled the land.<ref>G. Durga Prasad, History of the Andhras up to 1565 [[AD]], P.G. Publishers, Guntur, p. 116</ref>

==== Ikshvakus ====
''Andhra Ikshvakus'' ([[Telugu language|Telugu]] ఇక్ష్వాకులు, [[Sanskrit]] इक्ष्वाकु ) were one of the earliest recorded ruling dynasties of the Guntur-Krishna regions of Andhra Pradesh. They ruled the eastern Andhra country along the [[Krishna river]] during the later half of the second century [[Common Era|CE]]. [[Puranas]] called Andhra Ikshvakus '''Shri Parvatiya Andhras'''.<ref name="katragadda1">{{cite book|title=History of the Andhras|url=http://www.katragadda.com/articles/HistoryOfTheAndhras.pdf|author=Durga Prasad|publisher=P.

It is a strong common belief among some historians that Andhra Ikshvakus were related to the mythological [[Ikshvaku Dynasty|Ikshvakus]], while some believe Andhra Ikshvakus seem to be a local tribe who adopted the title.<ref name="katragadda1"/><ref>Ancient India, A History Textbook for Class XI, Ram Sharan Sharma, [[National Council of Educational Research and Training]], India , pp. 212</ref>

Archaeological evidence has suggested that the Andhra Ikshvakus immediately succeeded the [[Satavahanas]] in the [[Krishna river]] valley. Ikshvakus have left inscriptions at [[Nagarjunakonda]], [[Jaggayyapeta]], [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]] and [[Bhattiprolu]].<ref name="katragadda1"/>

==== Pallavas ====
During third century [[AD]], there was utter political and military confusion in the coastal Andhra due to the invasion of the Abhiras and their allies on the last Ikshvaku remnants and the rise of the Brihatphalayanas, the Anandagotras and the Salankayanas on the other. Simha Varma of the Manchikallu stone inscription establishes the independent rule of the Pallavas in parts of the Krishna valley of Andhra Pradesh.

During the reign of Maharaja Sivaskanda Varma of the Mayidavolu, Hirahadagalli, the early Pallavas became dominant power in the first quarter of the fourth century AD Sivaskanda Varma was the first great ruler of the early Pallavas. He extended his dominions from the [[Krishna district|Krishna]] in the north to the south [[Penner River|Pennar]] in the south and to the [[Bellary district]] in the West. He performed the [[Aswamedha]] and other Vedic sacrifices.

Most of the Pallava Prakrit and Sanskrit charters from the southern Andhra country intimately connects them with the history of southern Andhra. The influence of the Pallavas was still felt by Andhra till it was swept by the Western Chalukyan invasion led by Pulakesin II in the first quarter of the seventh century AD. The Pallavas were not a recognized political power before the 2nd century AD. Pallavas were originally executive officers under the Satavahana kings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ancient and medieval history of Andhra Pradesh|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wENuAAAAMAAJ|work=P. Raghunadha Rao|publisher=Sterling Publishers, 1993|page=68|accessdate=2014-06-09}}</ref>

==== Vishnukundins ====
Since the fall of the Ikshvakus, the Vishnukundins were the first great dynasty, which held sway way over the entire Andhra country including Kalinga and parts of Telangana and played an important and imperial role in the history of Deccan during the fifth and sixth century AD.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ancient and medieval history of Andhra Pradesh and telangana|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wENuAAAAMAAJ|work=P.

==== Salankayanas ====
''The Salankayanas'' were an ancient dynasty that ruled the [[Coastal Andhra|Andhra]] region between Godavari and Krishna with their capital as Vengi, modern Pedavegi 12&nbsp;km from Eluru in [[West Godavari district]] of Andhra Pradesh, [[India]]'s from 300 to 440 AD. They were [[Brahmins]] and their name is derived from their symbol and [[gotra]] name, which stood for [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]] (the bull of [[Shiva]]).<ref name="Ancient Indian History and civilization By S.

The [[Chola dynasty]] ruled Andhra during the period of 1010–1200. The Chola territories stretched from the islands of the Maldives in the south to as far north as the banks of the Godavari River in Andhra Pradesh.

====Vijayanagara Empire====

The Vijayanagara Empire was an empire originated [[South India]], in the [[Deccan Plateau]] region in the early fourteenth century. It was established in 1336 by [[Harihara Raya I]] and his brother [[Bukka Raya I]] of [[Sangama Dynasty]].<ref name="Book of Duarte Barbosa">By James Mansel Longworth page 204</ref><ref name="The madras journal of literature and science, year 1882">edited by J C morris page 261</ref><ref name="Encyclopedia of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh">By Om Gupta, page 428-429</ref> The empire rose to prominence as a culmination of attempts by the southern powers to ward off [[Islamic invasions of India|Islamic invasions]] by the end of the thirteenth century.<ref name="vidya">Nilakanta Sastry (1955), p216</ref><ref name="vidya1">Kamath (2001), p160</ref> It lasted until 1646 although its power declined after a major military defeat in 1565 to the [[Deccan sultanates]]. The empire is named after its capital city of [[Vijayanagara]], whose ruins surround present day [[Hampi]], now a [[World Heritage Site]] in [[Karnataka]], [[India]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Master Plan for Hampi Local Planning Area|url=http://www.bellary.nic.in/HMP/REPORT%20PDFs/CHAPTER-2.pdf}}</ref> The writings of medieval European travelers such as [[Domingo Paes]], [[Fernão Nunes]] and [[Niccolò Da Conti]], and the literature in local languages provide crucial information about its history. Archaeological excavations at Vijayanagara have revealed the empire's power and wealth.
The region of '''Rayalaseema''' in the present day Andhra Pradesh got its name from the rulers of this dynasty whose name generally ended with '''raya''', meaning raya ruled region (seema).

The empire's legacy includes many monuments spread over South India, the best known of which is the group at [[Hampi]]. The Vijayanagara emipre's time is considered as the golden era of South India in many aspects by historian be it prosperity, welfare, wealth, military might and nurturing of arts. The previous temple building traditions in South India came together in the [[Vijayanagara Architecture]] style. The mingling of all faiths and vernaculars inspired architectural innovation of [[Hindu]] temple construction, first in the Deccan and later in the [[Dravidian architecture|Dravidian]] idioms using the local [[granite]]. Efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade brought new technologies such as water management systems for irrigation. The empire's patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Sanskrit]], while [[Carnatic music]] evolved into its current form. The Vijayanagara Empire created an epoch in South Indian history that transcended regionalism by promoting [[Hinduism]] as a unifying factor.<ref name="Kannadaempire">Historians such as [[P. B.

#East Coastal Plains

[[Eastern Ghats]] region is home to dense tropical forests, while the vegetation becomes sparse as the Ghats give way to the Deccan Plateau, where shrub vegetation is more common. These Ghats have rich biological diversity with a wide variety of plants, birds and lesser forms of animal life. The vegetation found in the state is largely of dry deciduous types with a mixture of [[teak]], ''[[Terminalia (plant)|Terminalia]]'', ''[[Dalbergia]]'', ''[[Pterocarpus]]'', ''[[Anogeissus]]'', etc.
The state possesses some rare and endemic plants like ''[[Cycas beddomei]]'', ''[[Pterocarpus santalinus]]'', ''Terminalia pallida'', ''Syzygium alternifolium'', ''Shorea talura'', ''Shorea tumburgia'', ''[[Psilotum nudum]]'', etc.<ref name="flora and fauna" />

The diversity of fauna includes tigers, panthers, hyenas, black bucks, cheetals, sambars, sea turtles and a number of birds and reptiles. The estuaries of river Godavari and Krishna support rich mangrove forests with fishing cats and otters as keystone species.<ref name="flora and fauna" />

==Climate==
The climate of Andhra Pradesh varies considerably, depending on the geographical region. Monsoons play a major role in determining the climate of the state. Summers last from March to June. In the coastal plain, the summer temperatures are generally higher than the rest of the state, with temperature ranging between 20&nbsp;°C and 41&nbsp;°C.

July to September is the season for tropical rains in Andhra Pradesh. The state receives heavy rainfall from the southwest monsoon during these months. About one third of the total rainfall in Andhra Pradesh is brought by the [[northeast monsoon]]. October and November see low-pressure systems and tropical cyclones form in the Bay of Bengal which, along with the northeast monsoon, bring rains to the southern and coastal regions of the state. November, December, January, and February are the winter months in Andhra Pradesh. Since the state has a long coastal belt the winters are not very cold. The range of winter temperature is generally 12&nbsp;°C to 30&nbsp;°C.<ref name="tourisminap.com">{{cite web|author=Aptdc, Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation|url=http://www.tourisminap.com/know_ap/index.php |title=APTDC – Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation|publisher=Tourisminap.com|date=27 May 2010 |accessdate=15 August 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100806000215/http://www.tourisminap.com/know_ap/index.php| archivedate= 6 August 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

The Telugu Desam Party won both the assembly and [[Lok Sabha]] election in 1999 under the leadership of [[Nara Chandrababu Naidu|Chandrababu Naidu]].

In the ensuing elections the party lost power to a resurgent [[Indian National Congress|INC]] and its allies and [[Y. S. Rajasekhar Reddy]] became the [[Chief Minister]]. [[Y. S.

He died on 2 September 2009 in a helicopter crash. [[Konijeti Rosaiah]], former state finance minister, became the Chief Minister on 3 September 2009, who resigned on 24 November 2010 on the grounds of increased work pressure. [[Nallari Kiran Kumar Reddy]] was sworn in as the new Chief Minister, who was also the last [[Chief Minister]] of the united Andhra Pradesh.
