Donald MacAulay, (Cambridge University Press, 1992), 3.</ref> The term "Celtic" was first used to describe this language group by [[Edward Lhuyd]] in 1707.<ref>Cunliffe, Barry W. 2003. ''The Celts: a very short introduction.'' pg.48</ref>

Modern Celtic languages are mostly spoken on the north-western edge of [[Europe]], notably in [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], [[Brittany]], [[Cornwall]], and the [[Isle of Man]], and can be found spoken on [[Cape Breton Island]]. There is also a substantial number of [[Welsh language|Welsh]] speakers in the [[Patagonia]] area of [[Argentina]]. Some people speak Celtic languages in the other [[Celtic diaspora]] areas of the United States,<ref name="mla">[http://www.mla.org/map_data_states&mode=lang_tops&lang_id=636 "Language by State – Scottish Gaelic"] on ''Modern Language Association'' website.

Retrieved 5 August 2008</ref> In all these areas, the Celtic languages are now only spoken by minorities though there are continuing efforts at [[Language revitalization|revitalisation]]. Welsh is the only Celtic language not classified as "endangered" by [[UNESCO]].

During the 1st millennium BC, they were spoken across much of Europe, in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], from the Atlantic and [[North Sea]] coastlines, up to the [[Rhine]] valley and down the [[Danube]] valley to the [[Black Sea]], the [[Balkans|northern Balkan Peninsula]] and in central [[Asia Minor]]. The spread to Cape Breton and Patagonia occurred in modern times.

==Living languages==
[[SIL Ethnologue]] lists six "living" Celtic languages, of which four have retained a substantial number of native speakers. These are the [[Gaelic languages]] (i.e. the [[Irish language]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]] - both descended from [[Old Irish]]), and the [[Brittonic languages]] (i.e. [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and the [[Breton language]] - both descended from [[Common Brittonic|Old Brittonic]]).

The other two, [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and [[Manx language|Manx]], were spoken into modern times but later died as spoken community languages.<ref>{{cite book|last=Koch|first=John T.|title= Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia|publisher= ABC-CLIO|year= 2006|pages=34, 365–366, 529, 973, 1053|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f899xH_quaMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Celtic+Culture:+A+Historical+Encyclopedia#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=A brief history of the Cornish language|url=http://www.magakernow.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=38590#Revival|publisher=Maga Kernow}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Beresford Ellis|first=Peter|title=The Story of the Cornish Language|year=1990, 1998, 2005|publisher=Tor Mark Press|isbn=0-85025-371-3|pages=20–22}}</ref> For both these languages, however, [[Language revitalization|revitalisation]] movements have led to the adoption of these languages by adults and children and produced some native speakers.<ref name="iomtoday.co.im">{{cite web|author=Staff|url=http://www.iomtoday.co.im/manx-language/Fockle-ny-ghaa-schoolchildren-take.3901786.jp|title=Fockle ny ghaa: schoolchildren take charge|publisher=Iomtoday.co.im|accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title='South West:TeachingEnglish:British Council:BBC|url=http://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/uk-languages/south-west|accessdate=9 February 2010|publisher=BBC|year=2010|work=BBC/British Council website}}</ref>

* [[Gallaecian language|Gallaecian]], anciently spoken in the former [[Gallaecia]], northwest of the peninsula (modern [[Galicia, Spain|Galicia]], [[Asturias]], [[northern Portugal]] and parts of modern [[Old Castile]]).<ref>"In the northwest of the Iberian Peninula, and more specifically between the west and north Atlantic coasts and an imaginary line running north-south and linking Oviedo and Merida, there is a corpus of Latin inscriptions with paticular characteristics of its own. This corpus contains some linguistic features that are clearly Celtic and others that in our opinion are not Celtic. The former we shall group, for the moment, under the label northwestern Hispano-Celtic. The latter are the same features found in well-documented contemporary inscriptions in the region occupied by the Lusitanians, and therefore belonging to the variety known as LUSITANIAN, or more broadly as GALLO-LUSITANIAN. As we have already said, we do not consider this variety to belong to the Celtic language family." Jordán Colera 2007: p.750</ref>
* [[Gaulish language]]s, including [[Galatian language|Galatian]] and possibly [[Noric language|Noric]]. These languages were once spoken in a wide arc from [[Belgium]] to [[Turkey]]. They are now all extinct.
* [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]], including the living languages [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], and [[Welsh language|Welsh]], and the extinct languages [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]] and [[Pictish language|Pictish]] though Pictish may be a sister language rather than a daughter of [[Common Brittonic]].<ref>[[Kenneth H. Jackson]] suggested that there were two Pictish languages, a pre-Indo-European one and a ''[[Pritennic|Pritenic]]'' Celtic one. This has been challenged by some scholars. See [[Katherine Forsyth]]'s ''"Language in Pictland: the case against 'non-Indo-European Pictish'" '' {{PDFlink|[http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/archive/00002081/01/languagepictland.pdf Etext]|27.8&nbsp;[[Megabyte|MB]]<!-- application/pdf, 29250501 bytes -->}}.

* [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]], including the living languages [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Manx language|Manx]], and [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]].

Scholarly handling of the Celtic languages has been rather argumentative owing to scarceness of primary source data. Some scholars (such as Cowgill 1975; McCone 1991, 1992; and Schrijver 1995) distinguish [[Continental Celtic languages|Continental Celtic]] and [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic]], arguing that the differences between the Goidelic and Brittonic languages arose after these split off from the Continental Celtic languages. Other scholars (such as Schmidt 1988) distinguish between ''P-Celtic'' and ''Q-Celtic'', putting most of the Gaulish and Brittonic languages in the former group and the Goidelic and Celtiberian languages in the latter. The P-Celtic languages (also called [[Gallo-Brittonic]]) are sometimes seen (for example by Koch 1992) as a central innovating area as opposed to the more conservative peripheral Q-Celtic languages.

The Breton language is Brittonic, not Gaulish, though there may be some input from the latter,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Barbour and Carmichael|first=Stephen and Cathie |title=Language and nationalism in Europe|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=56|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1ixmu8Iga7gC&pg=PA56&lpg=PA56&dq=Breton+Gaulish+words&q=Breton%20Gaulish%20words|isbn=978-0-19-823671-9}}</ref> having been introduced from Southwestern regions of Britain in the post-Roman era and having evolved into Breton – still partially intelligible by modern Welsh and Cornish speakers.

In the P/Q classification schema, the first language to split off from Proto-Celtic was Gaelic. It has characteristics that some scholars see as archaic, but others see as also being in the Brittonic languages (see Schmidt). In the Insular/Continental classification schema, the split of the former into Gaelic and Brittonic is seen as being late.

The distinction of Celtic into these four sub-families most likely occurred about 900 BC according to Gray and Atkinson<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature02029|last=Gray and Atkinson|first1=RD|last2=Atkinson|first2=QD|title=Language-tree divergence times support the Anatolian theory of Indo-European origin|journal=Nature|volume=426|issue=6965|pages=435–439|year=2003|pmid=14647380|bibcode=2003Natur.426..435G}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2003.tb00299.x|last=Rexova|first=K. |author2=Frynta, D |author3=Zrzavy, J.|year=2003|title=Cladistic analysis of languages: Indo-European classification based on lexicostatistical data|journal=Cladistics|volume=19|issue=2|pages=120–127}}</ref> but, because of estimation uncertainty, it could be any time between 1200 and 800 BC. However, they only considered Gaelic and Brythonic. The controversial paper by Forster and Toth<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Forster|first=Peter |author2=Toth, Alfred |year=2003|title=Toward a phylogenetic chronology of ancient Gaulish, Celtic, and Indo-European|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=100|issue=15|pages=9079–9084|pmid=12837934|doi=10.1073/pnas.1331158100}}</ref> included Gaulish and put the break-up much earlier at 3200 BC ± 1500 years. They support the Insular Celtic hypothesis. The early Celts were commonly associated with the archaeological [[Urnfield culture]], the [[Hallstatt culture]], and the [[La Tène culture]], though the earlier assumption of association between language and culture is now considered to be less strong.<ref name=Renfrew>{{cite book|last1=Renfrew|first1=Colin|title=Archaeology and Language: The Puzzle of Indo-European Origins|year=1987|publisher=Jonathan Cape|location=London|isbn=0224024957}}</ref><ref name=James>{{cite book|last1=James|first1=Simon|title=The Atlantic Celts: Ancient People or Modern Invention?|year=1999|publisher=British Museum Press|location=London|isbn=0714121657}}</ref>

[[Image:Celtic Nations.svg|right|thumb|175px|The [[Celtic nations]], in which most speakers of Celtic languages are now concentrated]]

There are legitimate scholarly arguments in favour of both the Insular Celtic hypothesis and the P-Celtic/Q-Celtic hypothesis. Proponents of each schema dispute the accuracy and usefulness of the other's categories. However, since the 1970s the division into Insular and Continental Celtic has become the more widely held view (Cowgill 1975; McCone 1991, 1992; Schrijver 1995), but in the middle of the 1980s, the P-Celtic/Q-Celtic hypothesis found new supporters (Lambert 1994), because of the inscription on the Larzac piece of lead (1983), the analysis of which reveals another common phonetical innovation ''-nm-'' > ''-nu'' (Gaelic ''ainm'' / Gaulish ''anuana'', Old Welsh ''enuein'' "names"), that is less accidental than only one. The discovery of a third common innovation, would allow the specialists to come to the conclusion of a [[Gallo-Brittonic]] dialect (Schmidt 1986; Fleuriot 1986).

The interpretation of this and further evidence is still quite contested, and the main argument in favour of Insular Celtic is connected with the development of the verbal morphology and the syntax in Irish and British Celtic, which Schumacher regards as convincing, while he considers the P-Celtic/Q-Celtic division unimportant and treats Gallo-Brittonic as an outdated hypothesis.<ref name=Schumacher>{{cite book|last1=Schumacher|first1=Stefan|last2=Schulze-Thulin|first2=Britta|last3=aan de Wiel|first3=Caroline|title=Die keltischen Primärverben.

When referring only to the modern Celtic languages, since no Continental Celtic language has living descendants, "Q-Celtic" is equivalent to "Goidelic" and "P-Celtic" is equivalent to "Brittonic".

Within the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] family, the Celtic languages have sometimes been placed with the [[Italic languages]] in a common [[Italo-Celtic]] subfamily, a hypothesis that is now largely discarded, in favour of the assumption of [[language contact]] between pre-Celtic and pre-Italic communities.{{citation needed|date = August 2014}}

How the family tree of the Celtic languages is ordered depends on which hypothesis is used:

===Eska (2010)===
Eska (2010)<ref>Joseph F. Eska (2010) "The emergence of the Celtic languages". In Martin J. Ball and Nicole Müller (eds.), ''The Celtic languages''. Routledge.</ref> evaluates the evidence as supporting the following tree, based on [[shared innovation]]s, though it is not always clear that the innovations are not [[areal feature]]s.  It seems likely that Celtiberian split off before Cisalpine Celtic, but the evidence for this is not robust.  On the other hand, the unity of Gaulish, Goidelic, and Brittonic is reasonably secure.  Schumacher (2004, p.&nbsp;86) had already cautiously considered this grouping to be likely genetic, based, among others, on the shared reformation of the sentence-initial, fully inflecting relative pronoun ''*i̯os, *i̯ā, *i̯od'' into an uninflected enclitic particle.  Eska sees [[Cisalpine Gaulish]] as more akin to Lepontic than to Transalpine Gaulish.

**[[Celtiberian language|Celtiberian]] ("[[Hispano-Celtic]]")
**Nuclear Celtic?
***Cisalpine Celtic: [[Lepontic language|Lepontic]] → [[Cisalpine Gaulish]]
***Transalpine–Goidelic–Brittonic (secure)
****[[Transalpine Gaulish]] ("Transalpine Celtic")
****[[Insular Celtic]]
*****[[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]]
*****[[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]]

Eska considers a division of Transalpine–Goidelic–Brittonic into Transalpine and Insular Celtic to be most probable because of the greater number of innovations in Insular Celtic than in P-Celtic, and because the Insular Celtic languages were probably not in great enough contact for those innovations to spread as part of a [[sprachbund]].  However, if they have another explanation (such as an SOV substratum language), then it is possible that P-Celtic is a valid clade, and the top branching would be:

*Transalpine–Goidelic–Brittonic (P-Celtic hypothesis)

**[[Gallo-Brittonic]]
***[[Transalpine Gaulish]] ("Transalpine Celtic")

==Characteristics of Celtic languages==
{{Technical|section|date=March 2008}}
Although there are many differences between the individual Celtic languages, they do show many family resemblances. While none of these characteristics are necessarily unique to the Celtic languages, there are few if any other languages which possess them all. They include:

* [[consonant mutation]]s (Insular Celtic only)
* [[inflected preposition]]s (Insular Celtic only)
* two [[grammatical gender]]s (modern Insular Celtic only; Old Irish and the Continental languages had three genders){{citation needed|date=September 2012}} 
* a [[vigesimal]] number system (counting by twenties)
** e.g. Cornish ''hwetek ha dew ugens'' "fifty-six" (literally "sixteen and two twenty")
* verb–subject–object (VSO) word order (probably Insular Celtic only)
* an interplay between the subjunctive, future, imperfect, and habitual, to the point that some tenses and moods have ousted others
* an impersonal or autonomous verb form serving as a [[passive voice|passive]] or [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]]
** Welsh ''dysgaf'' "I teach" vs. ''dysgir'' "is taught, one teaches"
** Irish ''múinim'' "I teach" vs. ''múintear'' "is taught, one teaches"
* no [[infinitive]]s, replaced by a quasi-nominal verb form called the verbal noun or verbnoun
* frequent use of vowel mutation as a morphological device, e.g. formation of plurals, verbal stems, etc.
* use of preverbal particles to signal either subordination or illocutionary force of the following clause
** mutation-distinguished subordinators/relativisers
** [[Grammatical particle|particle]]s for [[Negation (linguistics)|negation]], interrogation, and occasionally for affirmative declarations
* [[infix]]ed pronouns positioned between particles and verbs
* lack of simple verb for the [[Imperfective aspect|imperfective]] "have" process, with possession conveyed by a composite structure, usually BE + preposition
** Cornish ''yma kath dhymm'' "I have a cat", literally "there is a cat to me"
* use of [[Periphrasis|periphrastic]] constructions to express verbal tense, voice, or [[Grammatical aspect|aspectual]] distinctions
* distinction by function of the two versions of BE verbs traditionally labelled substantive (or existential) and [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]]
* bifurcated [[demonstrative]] structure
* suffixed pronominal supplements, called confirming or supplementary pronouns
* use of singulars and/or special forms of counted nouns, and use of a singulative suffix to make singular forms from plurals, where older singulars have disappeared

Examples:<br>
(Irish) ''Ná bac le mac an bhacaigh is ní bhacfaidh mac an bhacaigh leat.''<br>
(Literal translation) Don't bother with son the beggar's and not will-bother son the beggar's with-you.
* ''bhacaigh'' is the genitive of ''bacach''. The ''igh'' the result of [[affection (linguistics)|affection]]; the ''bh'' is the [[lenition|lenited]] form of ''b''.
* ''leat'' is the second person singular inflected form of the preposition ''le''.
* The order is verb–subject–object (VSO) in the second half. Compare this to English or French (and possibly Continental Celtic) which are normally subject–verb–object in word order.

(Welsh) ''pedwar ar bymtheg a phedwar ugain''<br>
(literally) four on fifteen and four twenties
* ''bymtheg'' is a mutated form of ''pymtheg'', which is ''pump'' ("five") plus ''deg'' ("ten"). Likewise, ''phedwar'' is a mutated form of ''pedwar''.
* The multiples of ten are ''deg, ugain, deg ar hugain, deugain, hanner cant, trigain, deg a thrigain, pedwar ugain, deg a phedwar ugain, cant''.*

==Possible Celtic languages==

It has been suggested that several poorly-documented languages may possibly have been Celtic.

*'''[[Pictish language|Pictish]]''' was for a long time thought to be a [[Pre-Indo-European languages|pre-Celtic, non-Indo-European language]] of Scotland.  It is now widely regarded as Celtic.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}
*'''[[Ligurian language (ancient)|Ligurian]]''' was spoken in Northern Mediterranean Coast straddling South-east French and North-west Italian coasts, including parts of [[Tuscany]], [[Elba]] island and [[Corsica]]. Xavier Delamarre argues that Ligurian was a Celtic language, similar to, but not the same as Gaulish.<ref>http://www.celtnet.org.uk/gods_v/vasio.html</ref> The Ligurian-Celtic question is also discussed by Barruol (1999). Ancient Ligurian is either listed as Celtic (epigraphic),<ref name=kruta1>{{cite book|last=Kruta|first=Venceslas|title=The Celts|year=1991|publisher=Thames and Hudson|pages=54}}</ref> or Para-Celtic (onomastic).<ref name=kruta2>{{cite book|last=Kruta|first=Venceslas|title=The Celts|year=1991|publisher=Thames and Hudson|pages=55}}</ref>
*'''[[Lusitanian language|Lusitanian]]''' was spoken in the area between the Douro and Tagus rivers of western [[Iberia]] (a region straddling the present border of [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]]). It is known from only five inscriptions and various place names.<ref name=Wodtko/> It is an Indo-European language and some scholars have proposed that it may be a para-Celtic language, which evolved alongside Celtic and/or formed a [[dialect continuum]] or [[sprachbund]] with Tartessian and Gallaecian. This is tied to a theory of an Iberian origin for the Celtic languages.<ref name=Wodtko>{{cite book|last=Wodtko|first=Dagmar S|title=Celtic from the West Chapter 11: The Problem of Lusitanian|year=2010|publisher=Oxbow Books, Oxford, UK|isbn=978-1-84217-410-4|pages=360–361}}</ref><ref name=cunliffe/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Ballester|first=X.|title="Páramo" o del problema del la */p/ en celtoide|journal=Studi Celtici|year=2004|volume=3|pages=45–56}}</ref>
: It is also possible that the Q-Celtic languages alone, including Goidelic, originated in western Iberia (a theory that was first put forward by [[Edward Lhuyd]] in 1707) and/or shared a common linguistic ancestor with Lusitanian.<ref>https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fDYyBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8&dq=edward+lhuyd+lusitanian+celtic&source=bl&ots=p9NxkvOEqy&sig=slJhEQWgllehbW7lzwuuJasMBds&hl=pt-PT&sa=X&ved=0CDsQ6AEwA2oVChMIyt-c0-D2xgIVCyDbCh3uzQps#v=onepage&q=edward%20lhuyd%20lusitanian%20celtic&f=false</ref> Secondary evidence for this hypothesis has been found in research by biological scientist, who have identified (firstly) deep-rooted similarities in human DNA found precisley in both the former [[Lusitania]] and [[Ireland]],<ref>Hill E. W., Jobling M. A. & Bradley D. G. 2000. ''Y chromosome variation and Irish origins''. Nature 404: 351.</ref><ref>McEvoy B., Richards M., Forster P. & Bradley D. G. 2004. ''The longue durée of genetic ancestry: multiple genetic marker systems and Celtic origins on the Atlantic facade of Europe''. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 75: 693-702..</ref> and; (secondly) the so-called "[[Disjunct distribution#Lusitanian distribution|Lusitanian distribution]]" of animals and plants unique to western Iberia and Ireland.  Both of these phenomena are now generally believed to have resulted from human emigration from Iberia to Ireland, during the late [[Paleolithic]] or early [[Mesolithic]] eras.<ref Mascheretti et al.
