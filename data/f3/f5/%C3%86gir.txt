In [[Norse mythology]], '''Ægir''' ([[Old Norse]] "sea")<ref name=LINDOW47>Lindow (2001:47).</ref> is a sea [[jötunn]] associated with the [[ocean]]. He is also known for hosting elaborate parties for the [[Æsir|gods]].

Ægir's servants are [[Fimafeng]] (killed by [[Loki]]) and [[Eldir]].

== Description ==
The ''[[Nafnaþulur]]'' attached to the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' list Ægir as a giant.<ref name=FAULKES156>Faulkes (1987:156)</ref> [[Richard Cleasby]] and [[Guðbrandur Vigfússon]] saw his name as pre-Norse, derived from an ancient Indo-European root.<ref name=CLEASBYVIGFUSSON758>Cleasby, Vigfússon (1957:[http://web.ff.cuni.cz/cgi-bin/uaa_slovnik/gmc_search_v3?cmd=viewthis&id=cv:b0758:26 758]).</ref>

== Attestations ==
Both ''[[Fundinn Noregr]]'' and [[Snorri Sturluson]] in ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'' state that Ægir is the same as the sea-giant '''Hlér''', who lives on the isle of [[Hlesey|Hlésey]], and this is borne out by kennings.<ref name=SIMEK151>Simek (1993:151).</ref><ref name=DEVRIES1251>de Vries (1956:251).</ref> Snorri uses his visiting the Æsir as the frame of that section of the [[Prose Edda]].

In ''[[Lokasenna]]'', Ægir hosts a party for the gods where he provides the ale brewed in an enormous pot or cauldron provided by [[Thor]] and [[Týr]]. The story of their obtaining the pot from the giant [[Hymir]] is told in ''[[Hymiskviða]]''.

The prose introduction to ''Lokasenna'' and Snorri's list of [[kenning]]s state that Ægir is also known as [[Gymir]], who is [[Gerðr]]'s father, but this is evidently an erroneous interpretation of kennings in which different giant-names are used interchangeably.<ref name=SIMEK126>Simek (1993:126).</ref>

== Family ==

According to ''Fundinn Noregr'', Ægir is a son of the giant [[Fornjót]]r, the [[Ancient kings of Finland|king of Finland]], [[Kvenland]] and [[Gotland]], and brother of [[Logi]] ("fire") and [[Kári]] ("wind").<ref name=LINDOW48>Lindow (2001:48).</ref>

Ægir's wife is [[Rán]]. She is by Ægir mother of [[Daughters of Ægir|nine billow maidens]], whose names are:
*Bára (or Dröfn, ''wave'')
*Blóðughadda (''the one with blood-red hair – the color of the waves after a naval battle'')
*Bylgja (''to billow'', or ''big wave'')
*Dúfa (''the pitching wave'')
*Hefring (''the surging wave'')
*Himinglæva (''the wave that reflects the light of the sky'')
*Hrönn (''the grasping wave'')
*Kólga (''the chilling wave'')
*Unnr (or Uðr, ''wave'')
