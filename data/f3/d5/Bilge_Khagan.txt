'''Bilge Khagan''' ([[Old Turkic language|Old Turkic]]: [[File:Old Turkic letter N1.svg|10px]][[File:Old Turkic letter G1.svg|10px]][[File:Old turkic letter Q.png|10px]] [[File:Old Turkic letter A.svg|10px]][[File:Old Turkic letter G2.svg|10px]][[File:Old Turkic letter L2.svg|10px]][[File:Old Turkic letter I.svg|10px]][[File:Old Turkic letter B2.svg|10px]], Bilge qaγan)<ref name="irq.kaznpu.kz">[http://irq.kaznpu.kz/?lang=e&mod=1&tid=1&oid=16&m=1 Bilge kagan’s Memorial Complex, TÜRIK BITIG]</ref> (683 or 684 – 734) was the [[khagan]] of the [[Göktürks#Second Turkic Khaganate|Second Turkic Khaganate]]. His accomplishments were described in the [[Orkhon inscriptions]].

==Names==

As was the custom, his personal name and the name after assuming the title Khagan were different. His personal name was : 阿史那默棘連, Ashǐnà mòjílián, a-shih-na mo-chi-lan) . His name after assuming the title was Bilge Khagan (or Bilge Qhagan). ([[Old Turkic]]: {{OldTurkicUnicode|𐰋𐰃𐰠𐰏𐰀 𐰴𐰍𐰣}}, Bilge qaγan,<ref name="irq.kaznpu.kz"/> [[wikt:毗|毗]][[wikt:伽|伽]][[wikt:可|可]][[wikt:汗|汗]], [[Pinyin]]: píjiā kěhàn, [[Wade–Giles]]: p'i-chia k'o-han, official title: {{OldTurkicUnicode|𐱅𐰭𐰼𐰃𐱅𐰏 𐱅𐰭𐰼𐰃𐰓𐰀 𐰉𐰆𐰞𐰢𐱁 𐱅𐰇𐰼𐰜 𐰋𐰃𐰠𐰏𐰀 𐰴𐰍𐰣}}, Teŋіriteg Тeŋiride bolmuš Türük Bilge qaγan,<ref>[http://irq.kaznpu.kz/index.php?l=t&wi=726&lang=e&mod=3 Ethno Cultural Dictionary, TÜRIK BITIG]</ref> His wife was [[Po Beg]], [[Tonyukuk]]'s daughter. "Bilge" meaning "wise" or "one who has wisdom" in Turkic languages. Khagan (Kağan) is a title for ruler (like king, earl, etc.). "Bilge", as is the case with many pure Turkic names, is a unisex name. Even in today's Turkey, Bilge continues to be adopted both as a male and female name. Kağan or Kaan, however, is used only as a male name in contemporary Turkish.

==As a khagan==
In 716, [[Kapaghan Khagan]] the second khaghan of the khaganate was killed in his campaign against [[Tokuz-Oguzes|Toquz Oghuz]] and his severed head was sent to [[Chang'an]].<ref name="Tang194">''[[Old Book of Tang]]'', [[:zh:s:舊唐書/卷194上|Vol. 194-I]]</ref> Although his son [[Inel Qaghan]] succeeded him, the legal claimant of the throne was his cousin Ashǐnà mòjílián. Mojilan's brother [[Kul Tigin]] and [[Tonyukuk]] carried out a [[coup d'état]] against Inel Qaghan. They killed Inel Qaghan and made Mojilan a khagan with the name Bilge Qaghan.<ref name="Tang194"/> His name literally means "wise king".

Bilge's khaganate spanned vast steppes from the [[Caspian Sea]] to [[Manchuria]]; he also invaded the western sections of the [[China|Chinese]] territories. After his death from poisoning, several [[stela]]e were erected in [[Orkhon Valley|the capital area]] by the [[Orkhon River]]. These [[Orkhon inscriptions]] are the first known texts in the [[Old Turkic language]].
He was poisoned by Buyruk Chor<ref>[http://mtad.humanity.ankara.edu.tr/IV-3_Eylul2007/240_47_MTAD4-3_EEkrem.pdf Erkin Ekrem, "Sarı Uygurların Kökeni", ''Modern Türklük Araştırma Dergisi'', Vol. 4, No. 3, 2007, p. 175.]</ref> (梅錄啜/梅录啜, méilù chuò, mei-lu-ch'o). He didn't die immediately and he had time to punish the family of Buyruk Chor with death.<ref name="Tang194"/>
