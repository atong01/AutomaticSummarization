The [[family (biology)|biological family]] '''Canidae''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|n|ɨ|d|iː}}
<ref>Canidae. Dictionary.com. The American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary. Houghton Mifflin Company. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Canidae (accessed: February 16, 2009).</ref> is a lineage of [[carnivoran]]s that includes [[dog|domestic dog]]s, [[gray wolf|wolves]], [[fox]]es, [[jackal]]s, [[coyote]]s, and many other [[Extant taxon|extant]] and [[Extinction|extinct]] dog-like mammals. A member of this family is called a '''canid''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|n|ɨ|d}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|eɪ|n|ɨ|d}}).<ref>Canid [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/canid Merriam-Webster.com. Canid definition] Merriam-Webster. Retrieved 2014-05-27</ref> The Canidae family is divided into two [[Tribe (biology)|tribes]]: the Canini (dogs, wolves, jackals, and some South American "foxes") and the Vulpini (true foxes).

Canids have a long evolutionary history. In the [[Eocene]], about 50 million years ago, the carnivorans split into two lineages, the [[Caniformia|caniforms]] (dog-like) and [[Feliformia|feliforms]] (cat-like). By the [[Oligocene]], some ten million years later, the first proper canids had appeared and the family had split into three subfamilies, [[Hesperocyoninae]], [[Borophaginae]], and [[Caninae]]. Only the last of these has survived until the present day.

Canids are found on all continents except Antarctica and vary in size from the 2-m-long (6&nbsp;ft 7 in) [[gray wolf]] to the 24-cm-long (9.4&nbsp;in) [[fennec fox]]. The body forms of canids are similar, typically having long muzzles, upright ears, teeth adapted for cracking bones and slicing flesh, long legs, and bushy tails. They are mostly social animals, living together in family units or small groups and behaving cooperatively. Typically, only the dominant pair in a group breeds, and a litter of young is reared annually in an underground den. Canids communicate by scent signals and by vocalizations. One canid, the domestic dog (including the dingo), long ago entered into a partnership with humans and today remains one of the most widely kept domestic animals.

[[DNA]] analysis shows that the first three form [[Monophyly|monophyletic]] [[cladistics|clades]]. The wolf-like canids and the fox-like canids together form the tribe Canini.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Behavioural Biology of Dogs |last=Jensen |first=Per |year=2007 |publisher=CABI |isbn=978-1-84593-188-9 |pages=11–13 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=SpkSd__EdKYC&pg=PA3&dq=Tribe+Canini+Vulpini }}</ref> Molecular data imply a North American origin of living Canidae some ten million years ago and an African origin of wolf-like canines (''Canis'', ''Cuon'', and ''Lycaon''), with the jackals being the most [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] of this group. The South American clade is rooted by the maned wolf and bush dog, and the fox-like canids by the fennec fox and Blanford's fox. The grey fox and island fox are basal to the other clades, however this topological difference is not strongly supported.<ref name=Lindblad-toh2005>{{cite  doi| 10.1038/nature04338}}</ref>

==Evolution==
The Canidae today includes a diverse group of some 34 species ranging in size from the [[maned wolf]] with its long limbs to the short-legged [[bush dog]]. Modern canids inhabit forests, tundra, savannahs and deserts throughout tropical and temperate parts of the world. The evolutionary relationships between the species have been studied in the past using [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] approaches but more recently, molecular studies have enabled the investigation of [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic relationships]]. In some species, [[genetic divergence]] has been suppressed by the high level of [[gene flow]] between different populations and where the species have hybridized, large [[hybrid zone]]s exist.<ref name=Wayne>{{cite web |url=http://wooferhouse.net/Links/MolecularEvolutionOfTheDogFamily/MolecularEvolutionOfTheDogFamily.htm |title=Molecular evolution of the dog family |author=Wayne, Robert K. |accessdate=2014-05-27}}</ref>

===Eocene epoch===
[[Carnivoran]]s evolved from [[miacoid]]s about 55 million years ago ([[Mya (unit)|Mya]]) during the late [[Paleocene]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paleodb.org/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?action=checkTaxonInfo&taxon_no=57534&is_real_user=1 |title=The Paleobiology Database |publisher=Paleodb.org |accessdate=2012-06-12}}</ref> Some five million years later, the carnivorans split into two main divisions: [[caniforms]] (dog-like) and [[feliforms]] (cat-like). By 40 Mya, the first member of the dog family proper had arisen. Called ''[[Prohesperocyon wilsoni]]'', its fossilized remains have been found in what is now the southwestern part of Texas. The chief features which identify it as a canid include the loss of the upper third molar (part of a trend toward a more shearing bite), and the structure of the middle ear which has an enlarged [[Auditory bulla|bulla]] (the hollow bony structure protecting the delicate parts of the ear). ''Prohesperocyon'' probably had slightly longer limbs than its predecessors, and also had parallel and closely touching toes which differ markedly from the splayed arrangements of the digits in bears.<ref name=Wang-Tedford>{{cite journal| last = Wang| first = Xiaoming| year = 2008| title = How Dogs Came to Run the World| journal = Natural History Magazine| volume = July/August| url = http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/features/15771/how-dogs-came-to-run-the-world| accessdate = 2014-05-24 }}</ref>

The canid family soon subdivided into three subfamilies, each of which diverged during the Eocene: [[Hesperocyoninae]] (about 39.74-15 Mya), [[Borophaginae]] (about 34-2 Mya), and [[Caninae]] (about 34-0 Mya). Caninae is the only surviving subfamily and all present-day canids including wolves, foxes, coyotes, jackals, and domestic dogs belong to it. Members of each subfamily showed an [[cope's rule|increase in body mass with time]], and some exhibited specialised [[hypercarnivorous]] diets that made them prone to extinction.<ref>{{cite journal | first1 = B.| last2 = Wang| last1 = Van Valkenburgh | first2 = X. | first3 = J. | title=Cope's Rule, Hypercarnivory, and Extinction in North American Canids| last3 = Damuth | journal=Science | volume=306| issue = 5693 | pages=101–104 | date=Oct 2004 | issn = 0036-8075| pmid = 15459388 | doi=10.1126/science.1102417|bibcode = 2004Sci...306..101V }}</ref>{{rp|Fig. 1}}

===Oligocene epoch===
By the Oligocene, all three subfamilies of canids (Hesperocyoninae, Borophaginae, and Caninae) had appeared in the fossil records of North America. The earliest and most primitive branch of the Canidae was the Hesperocyoninae lineage, which included the coyote-sized ''[[Mesocyon]]'' of the Oligocene (38-24 Mya). These early canids probably evolved for the fast pursuit of prey in a grassland habitat; they resembled modern [[civet]]s in appearance. Hesperocyonines eventually became extinct in the middle Miocene. One of the early members of the Hesperocyonines, the genus ''[[Hesperocyon]]'', gave rise to ''[[Archaeocyon]]'' and ''[[Leptocyon]]''. These branches led to the borophagine and canine [[evolutionary radiation|radiations]].<ref name=Gittleman>Martin, L.D. 1989. Fossil history of the terrestrial carnivora. Pages&nbsp;536–568 in J.L. Gittleman, editor. Carnivore Behavior, Ecology, and Evolution, Vol. 1. Comstock Publishing Associates: Ithaca.</ref>

===Miocene epoch===
Around 9–10 Mya during the [[Late Miocene]], ''[[Canis]]'', ''[[Urocyon]]'', and ''[[Vulpes]]'' genera expanded from southwestern [[North America]], where the canine radiation began. The success of these canines was related to the development of lower [[carnassial]]s that were capable of both [[mastication]] and shearing.<ref name=Gittleman/> Around 8 Mya, the [[Beringia]]n land bridge allowed members of the genus ''[[Eucyon]]'' a means to enter Asia and they continued on to colonise Europe.<ref name=Perini>{{cite journal |author=Perini, F.

===Pliocene epoch===
During the [[Pliocene]], around 4–5 Mya, ''[[Johnston's Coyote|Canis lepophagus]]'' appeared in North America. This was small and sometimes coyote-like. Others were wolf-like in characteristics.''Canis latrans'' (the coyote) is theorized to have descended from ''Canis lepophagus''.<ref>Nowak, R.M. 1979. North American Quaternary Canis. Monograph of the Museum of Natural History, University of Kansas 6:1 – 154.</ref>

The formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]], about 3 Mya, joined [[South America]] to North America, allowing canids to [[Great American Interchange|invade South America]], where they diversified. However the most recent common ancestor of the South American canids lived in North America some 4 Mya and the likelihood is that there were more than one incursion across the new land bridge. One of the resulting lineages consisted of the [[gray fox]] (''Urocyon cinereoargentus'') and the now extinct [[dire wolf]] (''Canis dirus''). The other lineage consisted of the so-called South American endemic species, the maned wolf (''Chrysocyon brachyurus''), the short-eared dog (''Atelocynus microtis''), the bush dog (''Speothos venaticus''), the crab-eating fox (''Cerdocyon thous'') and the [[South American fox]]es (''Lycalopex'' spp.). The monophyly of this group has been established by molecular means.<ref name=Perini/>

===Pleistocene epoch===
During the [[Pleistocene]], the North American wolf line appeared, with ''[[Canis edwardii]]'', clearly identifiable as a wolf, and ''[[Canis rufus]]'' appeared, possibly a direct descendent of ''Canis edwardii''. Around 0.8 Mya, ''[[Canis ambrusteri]]'' emerged in North America. A large wolf, it was found all over North and Central America, and was eventually supplanted by its descendant, the dire wolf, which then spread into South America during the late Pleistocene.<ref name=Larson>{{cite web |url=http://exhibits.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/larson/canis.html |title=Wolves, coyotes and dogs (Genus ''Canis'') |author=Larson, Robert |work=The Midwestern United States 16,000 years ago |publisher=Illinois State Museum |accessdate=2014-06-07}}</ref>

By 0.3 Mya, a number of subspecies of the gray wolf (''Canis lupus'') had developed and had spread throughout Europe and northern Asia.<ref>Nowak, R. 1992. Wolves: The great travelers of evolution. International Wolf 2(4):3 – 7.</ref> The gray wolf colonized North America during the late [[Rancholabrean]] era across the Bering land bridge, there being at least three separate invasions, with each one consisting of one or more different Eurasian gray wolf [[clade]]s.<ref name=Chambers>{{cite journal |title=An account of the taxonomy of North American wolves from morphological and genetic analyses |authors=Chambers, S.

In 2015, a study of mitochondrial genome sequences and whole genome nuclear sequences of African and Eurasian canids indicated that extant wolf-like canids have colonised Africa from Eurasia at least 5 times throughout the Pliocene and Pleistocene, which is consistent with fossil evidence suggesting that much of African canid fauna diversity resulted from the immigration of Eurasian ancestors, likely coincident with Plio-Pleistocene climatic oscillations between arid and humid conditions. When comparing the African and Eurasian golden jackals, the study concluded that the African specimens represented a distinct monophyletic lineage that should be recognized as a separate species, ''[[Canis anthus]]'' (African golden wolf). According to a phylogeny derived from nuclear sequences, the Eurasian golden jackal (''Canis aureus'') diverged from the wolf/coyote lineage 1.9 million years ago but the African golden wolf separated 1.3 million years ago. Mitochondrial genome sequences indicated the Ethiopian wolf diverged from the wolf/coyote lineage slightly prior to that.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.cub.2015.06.060}}</ref>{{rp|S1}}

All canids have a similar basic form, as exemplified by the grey wolf, although the relative length of muzzle, limbs, ears and tail vary considerably between species. With the exceptions of the bush dog, raccoon dog, and some [[dog breed|domestic breeds of ''Canis lupus'']], canids have relatively long legs and lithe bodies, adapted for chasing prey. The tails are bushy and the length and quality of the pelage varies with the season. The muzzle portion of the skull is much more elongated than that of the cat family. The [[zygomatic arch]]es are wide, there is a transverse [[lambdoidal|lambdoidal ridge]] at the rear of the [[cranium]] and in some species, a [[sagittal crest]] running from front to back. The bony orbits around the eye never form a complete ring and the auditory bullae are smooth and rounded.<ref name=Mivart>{{cite book |title=Dogs, Jackals, Wolves, and Foxes: A Monograph of the Canidae |last=Mivart |first=St George Jackson |year=1890 |pages=xiv–xxxvi |url=https://archive.org/details/dogsjackalswolv00keulgoog }}</ref>

All canids are [[digitigrade]], meaning they walk on their toes. The [[Rhinarium|tip of the nose]] is always naked, as are the cushioned pads on the soles of the feet. These latter consist of a single pad behind the tip of each toe and a more-or-less three-lobed central pad under the roots of the digits. Hairs grow between the pads and in the Arctic fox, the sole of the foot is densely covered with hair at some times of year. With the exception of the four-toed [[Lycaon pictus|African hunting dog]] (''Lycaon pictus''), there are five toes on the forefeet but the pollex (thumb) is reduced and does not reach the ground. On the hind feet, there are four toes, but in some domestic dogs, a fifth vestigial toe, known as a [[dewclaw]], is sometimes present but has no anatomical connection to the rest of the foot. The slightly curved nails are non-retractile and more or less blunt.<ref name=Mivart/>

[[Canine penis|The penis in male canids]] is supported by a bone called the [[baculum]]. It also contains a structure at the base called the [[bulbus glandis]] which helps to create a [[copulatory tie]] during mating, locking the animals together for up to an hour.<ref name="Ewer1973">{{cite book|author=Ewer, R.

===Dentition===
[[File:Lupocranio.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eurasian wolf]] skull]] Most canids have 42 [[tooth|teeth]], with a [[dentition|dental formula]] of: {{DentalFormula|upper=3.1.4.2|lower=3.1.4.3}}. The bush dog has only one upper molar with two below, the dhole has two above and two below, and the bat-eared fox has three or four upper molars and four lower ones.<ref name=Mivart/> As in other members of [[Carnivora]], the upper fourth [[premolar]] and lower first [[Molar (tooth)|molar]] are adapted as carnassial teeth for slicing flesh, although the bat-eared fox differs in this respect, being largely insectivorous. The molar teeth are strong in most species, allowing the animals to crack open bone to reach the [[bone marrow|marrow]]. The deciduous, or baby teeth, formula in canids is {{DentalFormula|upper=3.1.3|lower=3.1.3}}, molars being completely absent.<ref name=Mivart/>

Almost all canids are social animals and live together in groups. In general, they are territorial or have a home range and sleep in the open, using their dens only for breeding and sometimes in bad weather.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Harris |first1=Stephen |last2=Yalden |first2=Derek |title=Mammals of the British Isles|publisher=Mammal Society|edition=4th Revised |year=2008 |isbn=0-906282-65-9 |page=413 }}</ref>  In most foxes, and in many of the true dogs, a [[breeding pair|male and female pair]] work together to hunt and to raise their young. Gray wolves and some of the other larger canids live in larger groups called [[pack (canine)|packs]]. African wild dogs have packs which may consist of twenty to forty animals, and packs of fewer than about seven individuals may be incapable of successful reproduction.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.patriciamcconnell.com/theotherendoftheleash/comparative-canid-behavior |title=Comparative canid behaviour |author=McConnell, Patricia B. |date=2009-08-31 |work=The other end of the leash |accessdate=2014-06-12}}</ref> Hunting in packs has the advantage that larger prey items can be tackled. Some species form packs or live in small family groups depending on the circumstances, including the type of available food. In most species, some individuals live on their own. Within a canid pack, there is a system of dominance so that the strongest, most experienced animals lead the pack. In most cases, the dominant male and female are the only pack members to breed.<ref name=ADW>{{cite web | title = Canidae: Coyotes, dogs, foxes, jackals, and wolves | work = Animal Diversity Web | publisher =University of Michigan| url = http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Canidae/ | accessdate = 2014-06-13}}</ref>

Canids communicate with each other by [[scent marking|scent signals]], by visual clues and gestures, and by vocalizations such as growls, barks, and howls. In most cases, groups have a home territory from which they drive out other [[conspecific]]s. The territory is [[Raised-leg urination|marked by leaving urine scent marks]], which warn trespassing individuals.<ref>Nowak, R. M.; Paradiso, J. L. 1983. Walker's Mammals of the World. Baltimore, Maryland: The Johns Hopkins University Press. ISBN 0-8018-2525-3.</ref> Social behaviour is also mediated by secretions from glands on the upper surface of the tail near its root and from the [[anal gland]]s.<ref name=ADW/>

Canids as a group exhibit several reproductive traits that are uncommon among mammals as a whole. They are typically [[Monogamy|monogamous]], provide paternal care to their offspring, have reproductive cycles with lengthy [[Estrous cycle#Proestrus|proestral]] and [[Estrous cycle#Metestrus or diestrus|dioestral]] phases and have a copulatory tie during mating. They also retain adult offspring in the social group, suppressing the ability of these to breed while making use of the [[Alloparenting|alloparental care]] they can provide to help raise the next generation of offspring.<ref name=Asa>{{cite book |title=A review of Small Canid Reproduction: in The Swift Fox: Ecology and Conservation of Swift Foxes in a Changing World |last=Asa |first=Cheryl S. |last2=Valdespino |first2=Carolina |last3=Carbyn, Ludwig N.; Sovada, Marsha Ann (eds.) |year=2003 |publisher=University of Regina Press |isbn=978-0-88977-154-3 |pages=117–123 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Er1di1OqnlAC&pg=PA117 }}</ref>

During the proestral period, increased levels of [[oestradiol]] make the female attractive to the male. There is a rise in [[progesterone]] during the oestral phase and the female is now receptive. Following this, the level of oestradiol fluctuates and there is a lengthy dioestrous phase during which the female is pregnant. Pseudo-pregnancy frequently occurs in canids that have ovulated but failed to conceive. A period of [[Estrous cycle#anestrus|anoestrus]] follows pregnancy or [[false pregnancy|pseudo-pregnancy]], there being only one oestral period during each breeding season. Small and medium-sized canids mostly have a [[gestation]] period of fifty to sixty days while larger species average sixty to sixty-five days. The time of year in which the breeding season occurs is related to the length of day, as has been demonstrated in the case of several species that have been translocated across the equator to the other hemisphere and experiences a six-month shift of phase. Domestic dogs and certain small canids in captivity may come into oestrus more frequently, perhaps because the [[photoperiod]] stimulus breaks down under conditions of artificial lighting.<ref name=Asa/>

The size of a litter varies,with from one to sixteen or more pups being born. The young are born small, blind and helpless and require a long period of parental care. They are kept in a den, most often dug into the ground, for warmth and protection.<ref name=Mivart/> When the young begin eating solid food, both parents, and often other pack members, bring food back for them from the hunt. This is most often vomited up from the adult's stomach. Where such pack involvement in the feeding of the litter occurs, the breeding success rate is higher than is the case where females split from the group and rear their pups in isolation.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Behavioural Biology of Dogs |last=Jensen |first=Per (ed.) |year=2007 |publisher=CABI |isbn=978-1-84593-188-9 |pages=158–159 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=SpkSd__EdKYC&pg=PA3&dq=Tribe+Canini+Vulpini }}</ref> Young canids may take a year to mature and learn the skills they need to survive.<ref>Voelker, W. 1986.

One canid, the [[Origin of the domestic dog|domestic dog]], entered into a partnership with humans a long time ago. This partnership is documented as far back as 26,000 years ago, when the footprints of a young boy aged about eight to ten was found in [[Chauvet Cave]] in southern France, walking alongside what was identified as a large dog or wolf.<ref>{{cite news| last = Derr| first = Mark| title = From the Cave to the Kennel| newspaper = The Wall Street Journal| date = 2011-10-29| url = http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970203554104577001843790269560| accessdate = 2012-12-02| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20131122165950/http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970203554104577001843790269560 | archivedate = 2013-11-22}}</ref> The earliest recorded fossil of a dog was found to be around 36,000 years ago in Goyet Cave in Belgium.<ref>{{cite journal| last = Shipman| first = Pat.| year = 2009| title = The Woof at the Door.| journal = American Scientist| url = http://www.psychologytoday.com/files/attachments/72276/woofatthedoor09.pdf| format=PDF| accessdate = 2012-12-02| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20131204182451/http://www.psychologytoday.com/files/attachments/72276/woofatthedoor09.pdf | archivedate = 2013-12-04}}</ref>  Even earlier, wolves were found fossilized in the same locations as humans at sites that date back 300,000 years, showing how far back humans and wolves had interactions with one another.<ref name=Galibert>{{cite journal| last = Galibert| first = F.| year = 2011| title = Toward understanding dog evolutionary and domestication history| journal = Comptes Rendus Biologies| volume = 334| issue = 3| pages = 190–196| url = http://www.popgen.su.se/hund/dokument/Galibert_et_al_2011.pdf| format=PDF| accessdate = 2012-12-02| last2 = Quignon| first2 = P.| last3 = Hitte| first3 = C.| last4 = Andre| first4 = C.| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20131204142437/http://www.popgen.su.se/hund/dokument/Galibert_et_al_2011.pdf | archivedate = 2013-12-04| doi=10.1016/j.crvi.2010.12.011| pmid = 21377613}}</ref> The fact that wolves are pack animals with cooperative social structures may have been the reason that the relationship developed.
