==Pacific Gas and Electric litigation==
{{Main|Hinkley groundwater contamination}}
The case alleged contamination of drinking water with [[hexavalent chromium]] (also written as "chromium VI", "Cr-VI" or "Cr-6") in the southern California town of [[Hinkley, California|Hinkley]]. At the center of the case was a facility, the Hinkley compressor station, built in 1952 as a part of a natural-gas pipeline connecting to the San Francisco Bay Area. Between 1952 and 1966, PG&E used hexavalent chromium in a cooling tower system to fight [[corrosion]]. The wastewater was discharged to unlined ponds at the site, and some percolated into the groundwater, affecting an area near the plant approximately {{convert|2|by|1|mi}}.<ref>[http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/rwqcb6/water_issues/projects/pge/index.shtml  PG&E Hinkley Chromium Cleanup] California Environmental Protection Agency, 9/10/08</ref> The Regional Water Quality Control Board ("RWQCB") put the PG&E site under its regulations in 1968 (Region six - RWQCB WDRs and subsequent RWQCB board orders).

The case was [[settlement (law)|settled]] in 1996 for [[United States dollar|US$]]333 million, the largest settlement ever paid in a direct-action lawsuit in US history. [[Edward L. Masry|Masry & Vititoe]], the law firm for which Brockovich was a legal clerk, received 133.6 million dollars of that settlement, and Brockovich herself was given a bonus of two million dollars. However, the law firm didn't distribute the remaining money to the plaintiffs for more than six months until, after several threats of lawsuits, they finally paid out.<ref>{{cite web |last=Sharp |first=Kathleen |title='Erofn Brockovich': The Real Story |url=http://www.salon.com/2000/04/14/sharp/|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |accessdate=18 April 2013}}</ref> The firm also billed $10 million for undetailed expenses, in a violation of the [[American Bar Association's Model Rules of Professional Conduct]].<ref>{{cite web |title=BILLING FOR PROFESSIONAL FEES, DISBURSEMENTS AND OTHER EXPENSES |url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/genpractice/resources/costrecovery/ABA_CommEthics_Opinion.authcheckdam.pdf |work=ABA Comm. on Ethics and Professional Responsibility, Formal Op. 93-379|publisher=[[American Bar Association]]|accessdate=18 April 2013}}</ref>

A study released in 2010 by the California Cancer Registry showed that cancer rates in [[Hinkley, California|Hinkley]] "remained unremarkable from 1988 to 2008".<ref name=cancer>Schwartz, Naoki (2010-12-13) [http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2010/12/13/survey_shows_unremarkable_cancer_rate_in_ca_town/ "Survey shows unremarkable cancer rate in CA town"], ''[[The Boston Globe]] Dec 13, 2010''</ref> An [[epidemiology|epidemiologist]] involved in the study said that the 196 cases of [[cancer]] reported during the most recent survey of 1996 through 2008 were fewer than what he would expect based on demographics and the regional rate of cancer.<ref name=cancer/>  A June 2013 ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' magazine article featured an extensive critique from the [[Center for Public Integrity]] of the author's work on the later epidemiological studies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/05/erin-brockovich-hinkley-california-junk-science|title=Erin Brockovich's Biggest Debunker, Debunked|work=Mother Jones}}</ref>

Average Cr-6 levels in Hinkley were recorded as 1.19 ppb with a peak of 3.09 [[parts per notation|ppb]]. For comparison, the PG&E [[Topock, Arizona|Topock]] Compressor Station on the California-Arizona border averaged 7.8 ppb with peaks of 31.8 ppb based on a PG&E Background Study.<ref>[http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/rwqcb6/water_issues/projects/pge/docs/pge_background_study_faq2.pdf PG&E Background Study]</ref>  California's Public Health Goal (PHG), circa 2011, for hexavalent chromium is 0.02 ppb.<ref>{{cite web

==Other litigation==
Working with [[Edward L. Masry]], a lawyer based in [[Thousand Oaks, California]], Brockovich went on to participate in other anti-pollution lawsuits. One of those accuses the Whitman Corporation of chromium contamination in [[Willits, California|Willits]], [[California]].  Another lawsuit, which lists 1,200 [[plaintiff]]s, alleges contamination near PG&E's Kettleman Hills compressor station in [[Kings County, California|Kings County]], [[California]], along the same pipeline as the Hinkley site. The Kettleman suit was settled for $335 million in 2006.

In 2003, Brockovich received settlements of $430,000 from two parties and an undisclosed amount from a third party to settle her lawsuit alleging [[toxic mold]] in her [[Agoura Hills]], California, home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/ACTIVIST+ERIN+BROCKOVICH+SETTLES+HOME+MOLD+SUIT.-a0107814985|title=ACTIVIST ERIN BROCKOVICH SETTLES HOME MOLD SUIT|publisher=|accessdate=October 27, 2014}}</ref> After experiencing the problems with mold contamination in her own home in the [[Conejo Valley]], Brockovich became a prominent activist and educator in this area as well.

Brockovich and Masry filed suit against the [[Beverly Hills Unified School District]] in 2003, in which the district was accused of harming the health and safety of its students by allowing a contractor to operate a [[Beverly Hills Oil Field|cluster of oil wells]] on campus.<ref>[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20140105,00.html Beverly Hills Mystery] ''People Magazine''. May 19, 2003, Accessed May 30, 2009.</ref> Brockovich and Masry alleged that 300 cancer cases were linked to the oil wells. Subsequent testing and epidemiological investigation failed to corroborate a substantial link, and [[Los Angeles County]] Superior Court Judge Wendell Mortimer granted summary judgment against the plaintiffs.<ref>[http://www.cjac.org/newsandresearch/balance/bal3-07.pdf   "More Brockovich Claims Tossed."] ''Balance''.

Brockovich assisted in the filing of a lawsuit against Prime Tanning Corp. of [[St. Joseph, Missouri|St. Joseph]], [[Missouri]] in April 2009. The lawsuit claims that waste sludge from the production of leather, containing high levels of hexavalent chromium, was distributed to farmers in northwest Missouri to use as fertilizer on their fields. It is believed to be a potential cause of an abnormally high number of brain tumors (70 since 1996) around the town of [[Cameron, Missouri|Cameron]], [[Missouri]], which is currently being investigated by the EPA.<ref>[http://www.kansascity.com/105/story/1157579.html Lawsuit alleges fertilizer was contaminated around Cameron, Mo.]</ref>

In June 2009 Brockovich began investigating a case of contaminated water in [[Midland, Texas|Midland]], [[Texas]].<ref name="cbs">[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/06/10/earlyshow/main5076625.shtml "Brockovich: Midland, Texas Water Sullied."] CBS News.

On April 20th, 2015, Brockovich on her Facebook page made a statement opposing fluoridation. <ref>{{Cite news|url = https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/FluoridePoisoning/conversations/topics/12181|title = Erin Brockovich fluoridation opposition statement|last = |first = |date = |work = |access-date = |via = }}</ref>
