The earliest mention of the city was in the [[Amarna tablets|Amarna correspondence]] of 1350-1330 BCE during its habitation by the [[Canaan]]ites. The [[Hebrew Bible]] identifies it as the city [[David]] was from and where he was crowned as the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|king of Israel]]. The [[New Testament]] identifies Bethlehem as the birthplace of [[Jesus]]. Bethlehem was destroyed by the Emperor [[Hadrian]] during the second-century [[Bar Kokhba revolt]]; its rebuilding was promoted by Empress [[Helena (Empress)|Helena]], mother of [[Constantine the Great]], who commissioned the building of its great [[Church of the Nativity]] in 327 CE. The church was badly damaged by the [[Samaritans]], who sacked it during a [[Samaritan Revolts|revolt]] in 529, but was rebuilt a century later by Emperor [[Justinian I]].

Bethlehem became part of [[Jund Filastin]] following the [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Muslim conquest]] in 637. Muslim rule continued in Bethlehem until its conquest in 1099 by the [[Crusaders]], who replaced the town's [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] clergy with a [[Catholic Church|Latin]] one. In the mid-13th century, the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]] demolished the city's walls, which were subsequently rebuilt in the early 16th century, after Bethlehem became part of the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref name="BMH">{{cite web

==History==

===Canaanite period===
The earliest reference to Bethlehem appears in the [[Amarna letters|Amarna correspondence]] (c. 1400&nbsp;BCE). In one of his six letters to Pharaoh, [[Abdi-Heba]], Egypt's governor for Jerusalem, appeals for aid in retaking "''Bit-Lahmi''" in the wake of disturbances by [[Habiru|Apiru]] mercenaries.<ref>"''Oxford Archeological Guides: The Holy Land''", [[Jerome Murphy-O'Connor]], pp. 198–199, Oxford University Press, 1998, ISBN 978-0-19-288013-0</ref> employed by his rivals: "now even a town near Jerusalem, Bit-Lahmi by name, a village which once belonged to the king, has fallen to the enemy . . . Let the king hear the words of your servant Abdi-Heba, and send archers to restore the imperial lands of the king!"

It is thought that the similarity of this name to its modern forms indicates that this was a settlement of Canaanites who shared a Semitic cultural and linguistic heritage with the later arrivals.<ref>"''International Dictionary of Historic Places: Vol 4, Middle East and Africa''", Trudy Ring, K.A Berney, Robert M. Salkin, Sharon La Boda, Noelle Watson, Paul Schellinger, p. 133, Taylor & Francis, 1996, ISBN 978-1-884964-03-9.</ref> ''[[Lachmo]]'' was the [[Mesopotamian mythology|Chaldean]] god of fertility,<ref>{{cite book | title=The Uttermost Part of the Earth: A Guide to Places in the Bible | publisher=Wm. A. Eerdmans | author=Losch, Richard R. | year=2005 | pages=51}}</ref> worshipped by the [[Canaanites]] as ''[[Lachama]]''. Some time in the 3rd millennium BCE, they erected a temple to worship the god on the hill now known as the Hill of the Nativity. The town was known as ''Beit Lachama'', meaning "House of Lachama." The [[Philistines]] later established a garrison there.<ref name="Loschp51">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=S5GJaakRvPgC&pg=PA51&dq=bethlehem+canaanite#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The uttermost part of the earth: a guide to places in the Bible|author=Richard R.

Albright]] notes{{where|date=April 2014}} that the pronunciation of the name remained essentially the same for 3,500 years, but has meant different things: "'Temple of the God Lakhmu' in Canaanite, 'House of Bread' in Hebrew and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], 'House of Meat' in Arabic."{{Full|date=April 2014}}

===Israelite and Judean period===
Archaeological confirmation of Bethlehem as an Israelite city was uncovered in 2012 at the archaeological dig at the [[City of David]] in the form of a ''[[Bulla (seal)|bulla]]'' (seal impression in dried clay) in ancient Hebrew script that reads "From the town of Bethlehem to the King," indicating that it was used to seal the string closing a shipment of grain, wine, or other goods sent as a tax payment in the 8th or 7th century BCE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antiquities.org.il/article_Item_eng.asp?sec_id=25&subj_id=240&id=1938&module_id=#as|title=Israel Antiquities Authority|work=antiquities.org.il}}</ref>

Biblical scholars believe Bethlehem, located in the "hill country" of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], may be the same as the Biblical [[Ephrath]],<ref>{{bibleverse||Gen.|35:16}}, {{bibleverse||Gen.|48:7}}, {{bibleverse||Ruth|4:11}}</ref> which means "fertile", as there is a reference to it in the [[Book of Micah]] as Bethlehem Ephratah.<ref>{{bibleverse||Micah|5:2}}</ref> The Bible also calls it Beth-Lehem Judah,<ref>{{bibleverse||Sam|17:12}}</ref> and the New Testament describes it as the "City of David".<ref name="qjukjz">{{bibleverse||Luke|2:4|KJV}}</ref> It is first mentioned in the [[Tanakh]] and the Bible as the place where the matriarch [[Rachel]] died and was buried "by the wayside" (Gen. 48:7). [[Rachel's Tomb]], the traditional grave site, stands at the entrance to Bethlehem. According to the [[Book of Ruth]], the valley to the east is where [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]] of [[Moab]] gleaned the fields and returned to town with [[Naomi (Bible)|Naomi]]. It was the home of [[Jesse]],<ref>{{bibleverse||1Sam|16:1}}</ref> father of King [[David]] of [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Israel]], and the site of David's anointment by the prophet [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]].<ref>{{bibleverse||1Sam|16:4-13}}</ref> It was from the well of Bethlehem that three of his warriors brought him water when he was hiding in the cave of [[Adullam]].<ref>{{bibleverse||2Sam|23:13-17}}</ref>

Writing in the 4th century, the [[Pilgrim of Bordeaux]] reported that the sepulchers of [[David]], [[Ezekiel]], [[Asaph (Bible)|Asaph]], [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]], [[Jesse]], and [[Solomon]] were located near Bethlehem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centuryone.com/bordeaux.html |title=The Bordeaux Pilgrim @ |publisher=Centuryone.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224014259/http://www.centuryone.com:80/bordeaux.html|archivedate=2012-02-24}}</ref> There has been no corroboration of this.

===Roman and Byzantine Bethlehem===
[[File:StJohnsAshfield StainedGlass GoodShepherd Face.jpg|thumb|According to the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus]] was born in Bethlehem.]]

After the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] was crushed, [[Hadrian]] converted the Christian site above the Grotto into a shrine dedicated to the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] god [[Adonis]], to honour his favourite, the Greek youth [[Antinous]].<ref name="Giuseppe Ricciotti 1948 p. 276">Giuseppe Ricciotti, ''Vita di Gesù Cristo,'' Tipografia Poliglotta Vaticana (1948) p. 276 n.</ref><ref>Maier, Paul L.  "The First Christmas:  The True and Unfamiliar Story." 2001</ref> Some scholars hold the view that this site was one that had originally been dedicated to Adonis-Tammuz and Christians had taken it over.<ref>Marcello Craveri, ''The Life of Jesus'', Grove Press (1967) pp. 35-36</ref>

In 326-328, the empress [[Helena (Empress)|Helena]], [[queen consort|consort]] of the emperor [[Constantius Chlorus]], and mother of the emperor [[Constantine the Great]], made a pilgrimage to Syra-Palaestina, in the course of which she visited the ruins of Bethlehem.<ref name="BMH"/> The empress promoted the rebuilding of the city, and [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] writes that she was responsible for the construction of the [[Church of the Nativity]].

During the [[Samaritan Revolts|Samaritan revolt]] of 529, Bethlehem was sacked and its walls and the Church of the Nativity destroyed; they were rebuilt on the orders of the Emperor [[Justinian I]]. In 614, the [[Sassanid Empire|Persian Sassanid Empire]], supported by [[Jewish revolt against Heraclius|Jewish rebels]], invaded [[Palestina Prima]] and captured Bethlehem. A story recounted in later sources holds that they refrained from destroying the church on seeing the [[magi]] depicted in [[Iranian art|Persian]] clothing in a mosaic.<ref name="BMH"/>

In 1099, Bethlehem was captured by the [[First Crusade|Crusaders]], who fortified it and built a new monastery and cloister on the north side of the Church of the Nativity. The [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] clergy were removed from their [[Episcopal see|sees]] and replaced with [[Catholic Church|Latin]] clerics. Up until that point the official Christian presence in the region was Greek Orthodox. On Christmas Day 1100, [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin I]], first king of the Frankish [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], was crowned in Bethlehem, and that year a Latin episcopate was also established in the town.<ref name="BMH"/>

In 1187, [[Saladin]], the Sultan of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]] who led the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Muslim Ayyubids]], captured Bethlehem from the Crusaders. The Latin clerics were forced to leave, allowing the Greek Orthodox clergy to return. Saladin agreed to the return of two Latin priests and two deacons in 1192. However, Bethlehem suffered from the loss of the pilgrim trade, as there was a sharp decrease of European pilgrims.<ref name="BMH"/> [[William IV, Count of Nevers]] had promised the Christian bishops of Bethlehem that if Bethlehem should fall under Muslim control, he would welcome them in the small town of [[Clamecy, Nièvre|Clamecy]] in present-day [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], France. As such, The Bishop of Bethlehem duly took up residence in the hospital of Panthenor, Clamecy, in 1223. Clamecy remained the continuous '[[Titular see|in partibus infidelium]]' seat of the Bishopric of Bethlehem for almost 600 years, until the [[French Revolution]] in 1789.<ref>de Sivry, L: "Dictionnaire de Geographie Ecclesiastique", p. 375., 1852 ed, from ecclesiastical record of letters between the Bishops of Bethlehem 'in partibus' to the bishops of Auxerre.</ref>

Bethlehem—along with Jerusalem, [[Nazareth]], and [[Sidon]]—was briefly ceded to the Crusader [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] by a treaty between [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] and Ayyubid Sultan [[al-Kamil]] in 1229, in return for a ten-year truce between the Ayyubids and the Crusaders. The treaty expired in 1239, and Bethlehem was recaptured by the Muslims in 1244.<ref>Paul Reed, 2000, p. 206.</ref> In 1250, with the coming to power of the [[Mamluk]]s under [[Baibars|Rukn al-Din Baibars]], tolerance of Christianity declined; the clergies left the city, and in 1263 the town walls were demolished. The Latin clergy returned to Bethlehem the following century, establishing themselves in the monastery adjoining the Basilica of the Nativity. The Greek Orthodox were given control of the basilica and shared control of the Milk Grotto with the Latins and the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenians]].<ref name="BMH"/>

===Ottoman and Egyptian rule===
[[File:Bethlehem Polenov.jpg|thumb|right|A painting of Bethlehem by [[Vasily Polenov]], 1882]]

[[File:Bethlehem 1898.jpg|thumb|right|View of Bethlehem, 1898]]

From 1517, during the years of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] control, custody of the Basilica was bitterly disputed between the Catholic and Greek [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox churches]].<ref name="BMH"/> By the end of the 16th century, Bethlehem had become one of the largest villages in the District of Jerusalem, and was subdivided into seven quarters.<ref name="Singer"/> The Basbus family served as the heads of Bethlehem among other leaders during this period.<ref>Singer, 1994, p. [http://books.google.com/books?id=mrsAw_mk1d0C&pg=PA33 33]  </ref> The Ottoman tax record and census from 1596 indicates that Bethlehem had a population of 1,435, making it the 13th largest village in Palestine at the time. Its total revenue amounted to 30,000 [[akce]].<ref name="Petersen141">Petersen, 2005, p. 141.</ref>

Bethlehem paid taxes on wheat, barley and grapes. The Muslims and Christians were organized into separate communities, each having its own leader; five leaders represented the village in the mid-16th century, three of whom were Muslims. Ottoman tax records suggest that the Christian population was slightly more prosperous or grew more grain than grapes (the former being a more valuable commodity).<ref>Singer, 1994, p. [http://books.google.com/books?id=mrsAw_mk1d0C&pg=PA84 84]  </ref>

From 1831 to 1841, Palestine was under the rule of the [[Muhammad Ali Dynasty]] of [[Egypt]]. During this period, the town suffered an earthquake as well as the destruction of the Muslim quarter in 1834 by Egyptian troops, apparently as a reprisal for the murder of a favored loyalist of [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]].<ref>Thomson, 1860, p. 647.</ref> In 1841, Bethlehem came under Ottoman rule once again and remained so until the end of World War I. Under the Ottomans, Bethlehem's inhabitants faced unemployment, [[Conscription|compulsory military service]], and heavy taxes, resulting in mass emigration, particularly to [[South America]].<ref name="BMH"/> An American missionary in the 1850s reported a population of under 4,000, nearly all of whom belonged to the Greek Church. He also noted that a lack of water crippled the town's growth.<ref>W. M. Thomson, p. 647.</ref>

Jordan retained control of the city until the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, when Bethlehem was captured by Israel, along with the rest of the [[West Bank]]. Following the Six-Day War, Israel took control of the city. In 1995, Israel turned it over to the Palestinian National Authority in accordance with the [[Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip|Oslo peace accord]].

Today, the city is surrounded by two bypass roads for settlers, leaving the inhabitants squeezed between 37 Jewish enclaves, where a quarter of all West Bank settlers, roughly 170,000, live, and the gap between the two roads closed by the 8-metre high [[Israeli West Bank barrier]], which cuts Bethlehem off from its sister city Jerusalem.<ref>Nicholas Blincoe, [http://www.lrb.co.uk/2014/08/14/nicholas-blincoe/phantom-bids 'Phantom Bids,'] [[London Review of Books]] 14 August 2014

[[File:Jesus birthplace in Bethlehem.jpg|thumb|right|Silver star marking the place where Jesus was born according to Christian tradition]]
Early Christian traditions describe [[Jesus]] as being born in Bethlehem: in one, a verse in the [[Book of Micah]] is interpreted as a prophecy that the [[Messiah]] would be born there.<ref>Freed, 2004, p. 77.</ref><ref>{{bibleverse||Micah|5:2|KJV}}</ref> The [[New Testament]] has two different accounts of the birth. In the [[Gospel of Luke]], [[Jesus]]' parents live in [[Nazareth]] and travel for the [[Census of Quirinius]] to Bethlehem, where Jesus is born, after which they return home.<ref name="qjukjz"/> In the [[Gospel of Matthew]] version, which takes place at least a decade earlier during the reign of [[Herod the Great]], there is no mention of the census and the family are living in Bethlehem.<ref>[[Bart D. Ehrman]], ''[[Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium|Jesus: apocalyptic prophet of the new millennium]]'', Oxford University Press 1999, page 38.</ref> Told that a 'King of the Jews' has been born in the town, Herod orders the killing of all the boys aged two and under in the town and surrounding area. [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], warned of this in a dream, flees to Egypt with his family and later settle in Nazareth. Most modern biographers of Herod doubt the massacre was a real event.<ref>"most recent biographies of Herod the Great deny it entirely." Paul L. Maier, "Herod and the Infants of Bethlehem", in Chronos, Kairos, Christos II, Mercer University Press (1998), p.170</ref>

[[File:Bethlehem Christmas2.JPG|thumb|upright|Catholic procession on [[Christmas Eve]], 2006]]

Modern scholars are doubtful that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, seeing the biblical stories not as historical accounts but as symbolic narratives invented to present the birth as fulfillment of prophecy and imply a connection to the lineage of King David.<ref>Vermes, 2006, p. 22.</ref><ref>Sanders, 1993, p. 85.</ref><ref>Crossan and Watts, p.&nbsp;19.</ref><ref>Dunn, 2003, pp.&nbsp;344–345.</ref><ref>Marcus J. Borg, ''Meeting Jesus for the First Time'' (Harper San Francisco, 1995) page&nbsp;22–23.</ref> The [[Gospel of Mark]] and the [[Gospel of John]] do not include a nativity narrative, but refer to him only as being from Nazareth.<ref>Mills and Bullard, 1990, pp.&nbsp;445–446.

The existence of early traditions of Jesus' birth in Bethlehem is attested by the [[Christian apologetics|Christian apologist]] [[Justin Martyr]], who stated in his ''Dialogue with Trypho'' (c. 155–161) that the [[Holy Family]] had taken refuge in a cave outside of the town.<ref>Taylor, 1993, pp.&nbsp;99–100. "Joseph&nbsp;... took up his quarters in a certain cave near the village; and while they were there Mary brought forth the Christ and placed him in a manger, and here the Magi who came from Arabia found him."(Justin Martyr, ''Dialogue with Trypho'', chapter LXXVIII).</ref> [[Origen|Origen of Alexandria]], writing around the year 247, referred to a cave in the town of Bethlehem which local people believed was the birthplace of Jesus.<ref>In Bethlehem the cave is pointed out where he was born, and the manger in the cave where he was wrapped in swaddling clothes. And the rumor is in those places, and among foreigners of the Faith, that indeed Jesus was born in this cave who is worshipped and reverenced by the Christians. (Origen, ''[[Contra Celsum]]'', book I, chapter LI).</ref> This cave was possibly one which had previously been a site of the cult of [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]].<ref>Taylor, 1993, pp. 96–104.</ref>

===Christmas celebrations===
[[File:Bethlehem Christmas pilgrims enter town 1890.jpg|thumb|right|Christmas pilgrims, 1890]]

Christmas rites are held in Bethlehem on three different dates: December 25 is the traditional date by the Roman Catholic and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations, but Greek, [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] and [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syrian Orthodox]] Christians celebrate Christmas on January 6 and [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Orthodox]] Christians on January 19. Most Christmas processions pass through Manger Square, the plaza outside the [[Basilica of the Nativity]].

===Other religious festivals===
Bethlehem celebrates festivals related to saints and prophets associated with Palestinian folklore. One such festival is the annual [[Feast of Saint George]] ([[Al-Khidr|al-Khadr]]) on 5–6 May. During the celebrations, Greek Orthodox Christians from the city march in procession to the nearby town of [[al-Khader]] to baptize newborns in the waters around the [[Monastery of Saint George, al-Khader|Monastery of St. George]] and sacrifice a sheep in ritual.<ref>[http://www.bethlehem.ps/religious_sites/feasts/st_george.php St. George's Feast] Bethlehem.ps.</ref> The Feast of St. [[Elijah]] is commemorated by a procession to Mar Elias, a Greek Orthodox monastery north of Bethlehem.

==Culture==

===Embroidery===
{{See also|Palestinian costumes}}
[[File:Bethlehem woman edited.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Woman in traditional Bethlehem costume]]

The women embroiderers of Bethlehem were known for their bridalwear.<ref name="PCA2">{{cite web |title=Palestine costume before 1948: by region |publisher=Palestine Costume Archive |accessdate=2008-01-28 |url=http://www.palestinecostumearchive.org/regional.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061024053919/http://www.palestinecostumearchive.org/regional.htm |archivedate=2006-10-24}}</ref> Bethlehem embroidery was renowned for its "strong overall effect of colors and metallic brilliance."<ref>{{cite book |last=Stillman |first=Yedida Kalfon |title=Palestinian costume and jewelry |publisher=University of New Mexico Press |year=1979 |location=Albuquerque |pages=&nbsp;46 |isbn=978-0-8263-0490-2}}</ref> Less formal dresses were made of indigo fabric with a sleeveless coat (''bisht'') from locally woven wool worn over top. Dresses for special occasions were made of striped silk with winged sleeves with a short ''taqsireh'' jacket known as the Bethlehem jacket. The taqsireh was made of [[velvet]] or [[broadcloth]], usually with heavy embroidery.<ref name=PCA2/>

Bethlehem work was unique in its use of couched gold or silver cord, or silk cord onto the silk, wool, felt or velvet used for the garment, to create stylized floral patterns with free or rounded lines. This technique was used for "royal" [[wedding dress]]es (''thob malak''), taqsirehs and the ''shatwehs'' worn by married women. It has been traced by some to [[Byzantium]], and by others to the formal costumes of the Ottoman Empire's elite. As a Christian village, local women were also exposed to the detailing on church vestments with their heavy embroidery and silver brocade.<ref name=PCA2/>

===Mother-of-pearl carving===
The art of [[Mother-of-Pearl carving in Bethlehem|mother-of-pearl carving]] is said to have been a Bethlehem tradition since the 15th century when it was introduced by [[Franciscan]] [[friar]]s from [[Italy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palestine-family.net/index.php?nav=6-207&cid=498&did=2502&pageflip=1 |title=Tourist Products|publisher=Palestine-Family.net |date=2007-01-23 |accessdate=2012-02-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206210408/http://www.palestine-family.net/index.php?nav=6-207&cid=498&did=2502&pageflip=1|archivedate=2013-12-06}}</ref> A constant stream of [[pilgrim]]s generated a demand for these items, which also provided jobs for women.<ref>Weir, pp. 128, 280, n.30</ref> The industry was noted by [[Richard Pococke]], who visited Bethlehem in 1727.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=wY4qAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_summary_r&cad=0#PPA436,M1 ''A Description of the East and Some other Countries''], p. 436</ref>

==Local government==
[[File:Bethlehem-hamasrally.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Hamas]] rally in Bethlehem]]
Bethlehem is the ''muhfaza'' (seat) or district capital of the [[Bethlehem Governorate]].

Bethlehem held its first municipal elections in 1876, after the ''mukhtars'' ("heads") of the quarters of Bethlehem's Old City (excluding the Syriac Quarter) made the decision to elect a local council of seven members to represent each clan in the town. A [[Basic law|Basic Law]] was established so that if the victor for mayor was a Catholic, his deputy should be of the Greek Orthodox community.<ref name="BME"/>

Throughout, Bethlehem's rule by the British and Jordan, the Syriac Quarter was allowed to participate in the election, as were the Ta'amrah [[Bedouin]]s and Palestinian refugees, hence ratifying the number of municipal members in the council to 11. In 1976, an amendment was passed to allow women to vote and become council members and later the voting age was increased from 21 to 25.<ref name="BME">[http://www.bethlehem-city.org/English/TempVewMenuSub.php?Mid=6 Municipal Council Elections during the British and Jordanian Periods] Bethlehem Municipal Council. {{Wayback|url=http://www.bethlehem-city.org/English/TempVewMenuSub.php?Mid=6|date =20130729182700}}</ref>

Today, the Bethlehem Municipal Council consists of 15 elected members, including the mayor and deputy mayor. A special statute requires that the mayor and a majority of the municipal council be Christian, while the remainder are open seats, not restricted to any religion.<ref name="Day"/>

There are several branches of political parties on the council, including [[Communism|Communist]], [[Islamism|Islamist]], and secular. The leftist factions of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) such as the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP) and the [[Palestinian People's Party]] (PPP) usually dominate the reserved seats. [[Hamas]] gained the majority of the open seats in the 2005 [[Palestinian municipal elections, 2005|Palestinian municipal elections]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bethlehem-city.org/English/Counil/index.php |title=Bethlehem Municipality(Site Under Construction) |accessdate=2008-01-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118135922/http://www.bethlehem-city.org/English/Counil/index.php |archivedate=January 18, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref>
