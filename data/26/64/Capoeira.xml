Since the 17th century, Portuguese colonists began exporting slaves to their colonies, coming mainly from West Africa. Brazil, with its vast territory, received most of the slaves, almost 40% of all slaves sent through the Atlantic Ocean.</paragraph><paragraph>The early history of capoeira is still controversial, especially the period between the 16th century and the beginning of the 19th century, since historical documents were very scarce in Brazil at that time. But oral tradition, language and evidence leaves little doubt about its Brazilian roots. Different masters tend to have their own specific views on the history of Capoeira. A vast majority of masters recognize the art form as purely Brazilian, while certain masters have been researching for over 40 years to try and find any Capoeira link in Africa.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Origins</heading><paragraph>In the 16th century,<space/><link><target>Portugal</target></link><space/>had claimed one of the largest territories of the<space/><link><target>colonial empires</target></link>, but lacked people to colonize it, especially workers.

Portuguese colonists created large sugarcane farms called<space/><italics><link><target>engenho</target><trail>s</trail></link></italics>, which depended on the labor of slaves.

Since the 1970s, capoeira mestres began to emigrate and teach it in other countries. Present in many countries on every continent, every year capoeira attracts to Brazil thousands of foreign students and tourists. Foreign capoeiristas work hard to learn Portuguese to better understand and become part of the art. Renowned capoeira mestres often teach abroad and establish their own schools. Capoeira presentations, normally theatrical, acrobatic and with little martiality, are common sights around the world.</paragraph><paragraph>The martial art aspect is still present and still disguised, leading many non-practitioners to ignore its presence. Trickery is ever present and expert capoeiristas can even disguise an attack as a friendly gesture.</paragraph><paragraph>Symbol of the Brazilian culture, symbol of the ethnic amalgam that characterizes Brazil, symbol of resistance to the oppression, capoeira definitely changed its image and became a source of pride to Brazilian people. Capoeira is officially considered<space/><link><target>Intangible culture</target><part>intangible cultural heritage</part></link><space/>of Brazil.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Techniques</heading><paragraph><template><target>See also</target><arg>List of capoeira techniques</arg></template>Capoeira is a fast and versatile<space/><link><target>martial art</target></link><space/>which is historically focused on fighting outnumbered or in technological disadvantage. The style emphasizes using the lower body to kick, sweep and take down and the upper body to assist those movements and occasionally attack as well. It features a series of complex positions and body postures which are meant to get chained in an uninterrupted flow, in order to strike, dodge and move without breaking motion, conferring the style with a characteristic unpredictability and versatility.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Ginga de dos.gif</target><part>thumb</part><part>Simple animation depicting part of the ''ginga''</part></link>The<space/><italics><link><target>Ginga (capoeira)</target><part>ginga</part></link></italics><space/>(literally: rocking back and forth; to swing) is the fundamental movement in capoeira, important both for attack and defense purposes. It has two main objectives. One is to keep the capoeirista in a state of constant motion, preventing him or her from being a still and easy target. The other, using also fakes and feints, is to mislead, fool, trick the opponent, leaving them open for an attack or a counter-attack.</paragraph><paragraph>The attacks in the capoeira should be done when opportunity arises, and though can be preceded by feints or pokes, they must be precise and decisive, like a direct kick to the head, face or a vital body part, or a strong takedown. Most capoeira attacks are made with the legs, like direct or swirling kicks, rasteiras (leg sweeps),<space/><link><target>List of capoeira techniques#Tesoura</target><part>tesouras</part></link><space/>or knee strikes. Elbow strikes, punches and other forms of takedowns complete the main list. The head strike is a very important counter-attack move.</paragraph><paragraph>The defense is based on the principle of non-resistance, meaning avoiding an attack using evasive moves instead of blocking it. Avoids are called<space/><italics>esquivas</italics>, which depend on the direction of the attack and intention of the defender, and can be done standing or with a hand leaning on the floor. A block should only be made when the<space/><italics>esquiva</italics><space/>is completely non-viable. This fighting strategy allows quick and unpredictable counterattacks, the ability to focus on more than one adversary and to face empty-handed an armed adversary.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Auangole.gif</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>A capoeira movement (A Fechado) (click for animation).</part></link>A series of rolls and acrobatics (like the<space/><link><target>Cartwheel (Capoeira)</target><part>cartwheels</part></link><space/>called<space/><link><target>a</target></link><space/>or the transitional position called negativa) allows the capoeirista to quickly overcome a takedown or a loss of balance, and to position themselves around the aggressor in order to lay up for an attack. It is this combination of attacks, defense and mobility which gives capoeira its perceived 'fluidity' and choreography-like style.</paragraph><heading level='2'>As a game</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Capoeira Dance.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Capoeiristas outside</part></link>Playing capoeira is both a game and a method of practicing the application of capoeira movements in simulated combat. It can be played anywhere, but it's usually done in a<space/><italics>roda</italics>. During the game most capoeira moves are used, but capoeiristas usually avoid using punches or elbow strikes unless it's a very aggressive game.</paragraph><paragraph>The game usually does not focus on knocking down or destroying the opponent, rather it emphasizes skill. Capoeiristas often prefer to rely on a takedown like a<space/><italics>rasteira</italics>, then allowing the opponent to recover and get back into the game. It is also very common to slow down a kick inches before hitting the target, so a capoeirista can enforce superiority without the need of injuring the opponent. If an opponent clearly cannot dodge an attack, there is no reason to complete it. However, between two high-skilled capoeiristas, the game can get much more aggressive and dangerous. Capoeiristas tend to avoid showing this kind of game in presentations or to the general public.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Roda</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Roda de capoeira1.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Capoeiristas in a ''roda'' (<link><target>Porto Alegre</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Brazil</target></link>)</part></link>The<space/><italics><link><target>Roda (formation)</target><part>Roda</part></link></italics><space/>(pronounced<space/><template><target>IPA-pt</target><arg>ˈʁodɐ</arg><arg></arg></template>) is a circle formed by capoeiristas and capoeira musical instruments, where every participant sings the typical songs and claps their hands following the music.

So if a capoeirista was captured by the police, he would be unable to identify his fellow capoeiristas, even when tortured.</paragraph><paragraph><italics>Apelidos</italics><space/>can come from many different things.

This, however, is misleading as the meaning of<space/><italics>malicia</italics><space/>in capoeira is the capacity to understand someone's intentions. In Brazil men who used street smarts to make a living were called<space/><italics>malandros</italics>. Later the meaning expanded, indicating a person who is a quick thinker in finding a solution for a problem.</paragraph><paragraph>In capoeira,<space/><italics>malandragem</italics><space/>is the ability to quickly understand an opponent's aggressive intentions, and during a fight or a game, fool, trick and deceive him.</paragraph><paragraph>Similarly capoeiristas use the concept of<space/><italics>mandinga</italics>. Mandinga can be translated &quot;magic&quot; or &quot;spell&quot;, but in capoeira a<space/><italics>mandingueiro</italics><space/>is a clever fighter, able to trick the opponent. Mandinga is a tricky and strategic quality of the game, and even a certain esthetic, where the game is expressive and at times theatrical, particularly in the Angola style. The roots of the term<space/><italics>mandingueiro</italics><space/>would be a person who had the magic ability to avoid harm due to protection from the<space/><link><target>Orisha</target><part>Orixs</part></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'>&quot;O Fio Da Navalha&quot;, ESPN Brasil documentary, 2007</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Alternately Mandinga is a way of saying Mandinka (as in the Mandinka Nation) who are known as &quot;musical hunters&quot;. Which directly ties into the term &quot;vadiao&quot;. Vadiao is the musical wanderer (with flute in hand), traveler, vagabond.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Music</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Capoeira music</arg></template>Music is integral to capoeira.

Two low pitch berimbaus (called<space/><italics>berra-boi</italics><space/>and<space/><italics>mdio</italics>) form the base and a high pitch berimbau (called<space/><italics>viola</italics>) makes variations and improvisations. The other instruments must follow the berimbau's rhythm, free to vary and improvise a little, depending upon the capoeira group's musical style.</paragraph><paragraph>As the capoeiristas change their playing style significantly following the<space/><link><target>capoeira toques</target><part>toque</part></link><space/>of the berimbau, which sets the game's speed, style and aggressiveness, it is truly the music that drives a capoeira game.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Songs</heading><paragraph>Many of the songs are sung in a<space/><link><target>Call and response (music)</target><part>call and response</part></link><space/>format while others are in the form of a narrative. Capoeiristas sing about a wide variety of subjects. Some songs are about history or stories of famous capoeiristas. Other songs attempt to inspire players to play better. Some songs are about what is going on within the roda. Sometimes the songs are about life or love lost. Others have lighthearted and playful lyrics.</paragraph><paragraph>There are four basic kinds of songs in capoeira, the<space/><italics>Ladanha</italics>,<space/><italics>Chula</italics>,<space/><italics>Corrido</italics><space/>and<space/><italics>Quadra</italics>. The<space/><italics>Ladanha</italics><space/>is a narrative solo sung only at the beginning of a roda, often by a<space/><italics>mestre</italics><space/>(master) or most respected capoeirista present. The solo is followed by a<space/><italics>louvao</italics>, a call and response pattern that usually thanks God and one's master, among other things. Each call is usually repeated word-for-word by the responders. The<space/><bold>Chula</bold><space/>is a song where the singer part is much bigger than the chorus response, usually eight singer verses for one chorus response, but the proportion may vary. The<space/><bold>Corrido</bold><space/>is a song where the singer part and the chorus response are equal, normally two verses by two responses. Finally, the<space/><italics>Quadra</italics><space/>is a song where the same verse is repeated four times, either three singer verses followed by one chorus response, or one verse and one response.</paragraph><paragraph>Capoeira songs can talk about virtually anything, being it about a historical fact, a famous capoeirista, trivial life facts, hidden messages for players, anything. Improvisation is very important also, while singing a song the main singer can change the music's lyrics, telling something that's happening in or outside the roda.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Styles</heading><paragraph>Determining styles in capoeira is difficult, since there was never a unity in the original capoeira, or a teaching method before the decade of 1920. However, a division between two styles and a sub-style is widely accepted.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Capoeira Angola</heading><paragraph>Capoeira Angola refers to every capoeira that keeps the traditions held before the creation of the Regional style.</paragraph><paragraph>Existing in many parts of Brazil since colonial times, most notably in the cities of<space/><link><target>Rio de Janeiro</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Salvador, Bahia</target><part>Salvador</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Recife</target></link>, it's impossible to tell where and when Capoeira Angola began taking its present form. The name<space/><italics>Angola</italics><space/>starts as early as the beginning of slavery in Brazil, when Africans, taken to<space/><link><target>Luanda</target></link><space/>to be shipped to the Americas, were called in Brazil &quot;black people from Angola&quot;, regardless of their nationality. In some places of Brazil people would refer to capoeira as &quot;playing Angola&quot; and, according to Mestre Noronha, the capoeira school<space/><italics>Centro de Capoeira Angola Conceio da Praia</italics>, created in Bahia, already used the name<space/><italics>Capoeira Angola</italics><space/>illegally in the beginning of the 1920 decade.<extension extension_name='ref' name="noronha"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The name<space/><italics>Angola</italics><space/>was finally immortalized by<space/><link><target>Pastinha</target><part>Mestre Pastinha</part></link><space/>at February 23, 1941, when he opened the<space/><italics>Centro Esportivo de capoeira Angola</italics><space/>(CECA). Pastinha preferred the ludic aspects of the game rather than the martial side, and was much respected by recognized capoeira masters. Soon many other masters would adopt the name<space/><italics>Angola</italics>, even those who would not follow Pastinha's style.</paragraph><paragraph>The ideal of<space/><italics>Capoeira Angola</italics><space/>is to maintain capoeira as close to its roots as possible. Characterized by being strategic, with sneaking movements executed standing or near the floor depending on the situation to face, it values the traditions of<space/><italics>malcia</italics>,<space/><italics>malandragem</italics><space/>and unpredictability of the original capoeira.</paragraph><paragraph>Typical music<space/><italics>bateria</italics><space/>formation in a<space/><italics>roda</italics><space/>of<space/><italics>Capoeira Angola</italics><space/>is three<space/><italics>berimbaus</italics>, two<space/><italics>pandeiros</italics>, one<space/><italics>atabaque</italics>, one<space/><italics>agog</italics><space/>and one<space/><italics>ganzu</italics>.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Capoeira Regional</heading><paragraph>Capoeira Regional began to take form in the 1920 decade, when<space/><link><target>Mestre Bimba</target></link><space/>met his future student, Jos Cisnando Lima. Both believed that capoeira was losing its martial side and concluded there was a need to restructure it. Bimba created his<space/><italics>sequncias de ensino</italics><space/>(teaching combinations) and created capoeira's first teaching method. Advised by Cisnando, Bimba decided to call his style<space/><italics>Luta Regional Baiana</italics>, as capoeira was still illegal at that time.</paragraph><paragraph>The base of Capoeira Regional is the original capoeira without many of the aspects that were impractical in a real fight, with less subterfuge and more objectivity. Training was mainly focused on attack, dodging and counter-attack, giving high importance to precision and discipline. Bimba also added a few moves from other arts, notably the<space/><italics>batuque</italics>, an old street fight game practiced by his father. Use of jumps or aerial acrobacies was kept to a minimum, since one of its foundations was always keeping at least one hand or foot firmly attached to the ground. Mestre Bimba often said, &quot;<italics>o cho amigo do capoeirista</italics>&quot; (the floor is a friend to the capoeirista).</paragraph><paragraph><italics>Capoeira Regional</italics><space/>also introduced the first ranking method in capoeira.<space/><italics>Regional</italics><space/>had three levels:<space/><italics>calouro</italics><space/>(freshman),<space/><italics>formado</italics><space/>(graduated) and<space/><italics>formado especializado</italics><space/>(specialist). When a student completed a course, a special celebration ceremony was had resulting with a silk scarf being tied around the capoeirista's neck.</paragraph><paragraph>The traditions of<space/><italics>roda</italics><space/>and capoeira game were kept, being used to put into use what was learned during training. The disposition of musical instruments, however, was changed, being made by a single berimbau and two pandeiros.</paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><italics>Luta Regional Baiana</italics><space/>soon became popular, finally changing capoeira's bad image. Mestre Bimba made many presentations of his new style, but the best known was the one made at 1953 to Brazilian president<space/><link><target>Getlio Vargas</target></link>, where the president would say: &quot;<italics>A Capoeira o nico esporte verdadeiramente nacional</italics>&quot; (Capoeira is the only truly national sport).</paragraph><heading level='3'>Capoeira Contempornea</heading><paragraph>In the 1970s a mixed style began to take form, with practitioners taking the aspects they considered more important from both Regional and Angola. Notably more acrobatic, this sub-style is seen by some as the natural evolution of capoeira, by others as adulteration or even misinterpretation of capoeira.</paragraph><paragraph>Nowadays the label Contempornea applies to any capoeira group who don't follow Regional or Angola styles, even the ones who mix capoeira with other martial arts. Some notable groups whose style cannot be described as either Angola or Regional but rather &quot;a style of their own&quot;, include Senzala de Santos, Cordao de Ouro and Abada. In the case of Cordao de Ouro, the style may be described as &quot;Miudinho&quot;, a low and fast paced game, while in Senzala de Santos the style may described simply as &quot;Senzala de Santos&quot;, an elegant, playful combination of Angola and Regional. Capoeira Abada may be described as a more aggressive, less &quot;dance&quot; influenced style of Capoeira.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Mestre Sombra.jpeg</target><part>thumbnail</part><part>Mestre Sombra, founder of 'Senzala de Santos'</part></link></paragraph><heading level='2'>Ranks</heading><paragraph>Because of its origin, capoeira never had unity or a general agreement.

There are students, treinels, professors, contra-mestres and mestre but no cordas (belts). In some groups a capoeira is simply as it, capoeira, and therefore there is no need of cordas as &quot;belts does not play&quot;. One of the ideas to not have a belt is that there is as many belt systems as there is groups using of it. Therefore, groups can have a different meanings of level of same colour belts.
