'''Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|æ|r|ən|ˌ|h|aɪ|t}}; {{IPA-de|ˈfaːʀənhait|lang}}; 24 May 1686 – 16 September 1736) was a German [[physicist]], [[engineer]], and [[glass blower]] who is best known for inventing the [[mercury-in-glass thermometer]] (1714), and for developing a [[Fahrenheit|temperature scale now named after him]].<ref name="britannica.com">Encyclopedia Britannica  "Science & Technology: Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit" [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/200226/Daniel-Gabriel-Fahrenheit]</ref>

== Biography ==
Fahrenheit was born in 1686 in [[Gdańsk|Danzig]] (Gdańsk), in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], but lived most of his life in the [[Dutch Republic]]. The Fahrenheits were a German [[Hanse]] merchant family who had lived in several [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] cities. Fahrenheit's great-grandfather had lived in [[Rostock]], and research suggests that the Fahrenheit family originated in [[Hildesheim]].<ref>{{cite book | author = Kant, Horst | title = G. D. Fahrenheit / R. -A. F. de Réaumur / A. Celsius | year = 1984 | publisher = B. G. Teubner | url = http://books.google.com/?id=XYKtGQAACAAJ | accessdate = 14 June 2008 }}</ref> Daniel's grandfather moved from [[Kneiphof]] in [[Königsberg]] to Danzig and settled there as a merchant in 1650. His son, Daniel Fahrenheit (the father of the subject of this article), married Concordia Schumann, daughter of a well-known Danzig business family. Daniel was the eldest of the five Fahrenheit children (two sons, three daughters) who survived childhood. His sister, Virginia Elizabeth Fahrenheit, married Benjamin Ephraim Krueger of an aristocratic family from Danzig.<ref>See the [http://www.g-gruppen.net/danzigforedt.htm#a2 Fahrenheit and Krueger genealogies].</ref>

Daniel Gabriel  began training as a merchant in [[Amsterdam]] after his parents died on 14 August 1701 from eating [[Amanita phalloides|poisonous mushrooms]]. However, Fahrenheit's interest in natural science led him to begin studies and experimentation in that field. From 1717, he traveled to [[Berlin]], [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]], [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]], [[Copenhagen]], and also to his hometown, where his brother still lived. During that time, Fahrenheit met or was in contact with [[Ole Rømer]], [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]], and [[Gottfried Leibniz]]. In 1717, Fahrenheit settled in [[The Hague]] as a [[glassblower]], making [[barometer]]s, [[altimeter]]s, and [[thermometer]]s. From 1718 onwards, he lectured in [[chemistry]] in Amsterdam.  He visited England in 1724 and was the same year elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]].<ref>[http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=0&dsqSearch=((text)%3D'fahrenheit')  The Royal Society Archive catalogue]</ref> Fahrenheit died in The Hague and was buried there at the [[Kloosterkerk, The Hague|Kloosterkerk]] (Cloister Church).

In 2012, scientists made a computer image of his face using photos of his relatives.<ref>{{cite news | title = Scientists make computer image of inventor's face using photos of his relatives | newspaper = The Age | date = 28 November 2012 | url = http://www.theage.com.au/technology/sci-tech/scientists-make-computer-image-of-inventors-face-using-photos-of-his-relatives-20121128-2acjr.html}}</ref>

== Fahrenheit scale ==
[[File:Fahrenheit Celsius scales.svg|thumb|80px|The Celsius and Fahrenheit scales]]
{{main|Fahrenheit}}
According to Fahrenheit's 1724 article,<ref name = 'ftempsc'/><ref>Fahrenheit describes, in Latin, these numerical choices in the following paper: {{cite journal | author = Fahrenheit, D. G. | title = Experimenta et Observationes de Congelatione aquae in vacuo factae | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society | volume = 33 | pages = 78 | year = 1724 | url = | doi = 10.1098/rstl.1724.0016 | issue = 381–391 }}</ref> he determined his scale by reference to three fixed points of temperature.  The lowest temperature was achieved by preparing a [[frigorific mixture]] of [[ice]], water, and [[ammonium chloride]] (a salt), and waiting for it to reach equilibrium.  The thermometer then was placed into the mixture and the liquid in the thermometer allowed to descend to its lowest point.  The thermometer's reading there was taken as 0&nbsp;°F.  The second reference point was selected as the reading of the thermometer when it was placed in still water when ice was just forming on the surface.<ref name='why32'>{{cite web|url=http://www.physlink.com/Education/AskExperts/ae64.cfm?CFID=21412834&CFTOKEN=55577927 |title=Why does the Fahrenheit scale use 32 degrees as a freezing point? |accessdate=9 May 2008 |last=Heath |first=Jonathan |publisher=PhysLink }}</ref>  This was assigned as 32&nbsp;°F.  The third calibration point, taken as 96&nbsp;°F, was selected as the thermometer's reading when the instrument was placed under the arm or in the mouth.

Fahrenheit came up with the idea that mercury boils around 300 degrees on this temperature scale. Work by others showed that water boils about 180 degrees above its freezing point.  The Fahrenheit scale later was redefined to make the freezing-to-boiling interval exactly 180 degrees,<ref name='ftempsc'>{{cite web|url=http://www.sizes.com/units/temperature_Fahrenheit.htm |title=Fahrenheit temperature scale |accessdate=9 May 2008 |date=10 December 2006 |publisher=Sizes, Inc }}</ref> a convenient value as 180 is a [[highly composite number]], meaning that it is evenly divisible into many fractions. It is because of the scale's redefinition that normal body temperature today is taken as 98.2 degrees,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.1992.03490120092034 |title=A Critical Appraisal of 98.6°F, the Upper Limit of the Normal Body Temperature, and Other Legacies of Carl Reinhold August Wunderlich |year=1992 |last1=MacKowiak |first1=Philip A. |journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=268 |issue=12 |pages=1578}}</ref> whereas it was 96 degrees on Fahrenheit's original scale.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Elert | first = Glenn | title = Temperature of a Healthy Human (Body Temperature) | url = http://hypertextbook.com/facts/LenaWong.shtml | accessdate = 4 December 2008 | doi = 10.1046/j.1471-6712.2002.00069.x | year = 2002 | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences | volume = 16 | pages = 122–8 | pmid = 12000664 | last2 = Forsberg | first2 = C | last3 = Wahren | first3 = LK | issue = 2}}</ref>

Until the switch to the [[Celsius scale]],{{when|date=November 2014}} the Fahrenheit scale was widely used in Europe{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}. It is still used for everyday temperature measurements by the general population in the United States.<ref>For an early attempt to replace the Fahrenheit scale in the United States, see {{cite book | author = Johnson, Albert | title = Abolish the Fahrenheit Thermometer | year = 1916 | location = Washington, DC | url = http://books.google.com/?id=Bv5gc38ezBAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Abolish+the+Fahrenheit+Thermometer | publisher = G.P.O.}}</ref>
