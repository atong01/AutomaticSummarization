The [[Classical Sanskrit]] noun ''dharma'' is a derivation from the root ''dhṛ'', which has a meaning of "to hold, maintain, keep".{{refn|group=note|name="Monier Williams"}} The word "dharma" was already in use in the [[historical Vedic religion]], and its meaning and conceptual scope has evolved over several millennia.<ref name=phph/> The [[antonym]] of dharma is ''[[adharma]]''.

==Etymology==
The [[Classical Sanskrit]] noun ''dharma'' is a derivation from the root ''dhṛ'', which means "to hold, maintain, keep",{{refn|group=note|name="Monier Williams"|Monier Williams, ''A Sanskrit Dictionary'' (1899): "to hold , bear (also bring forth) , carry , maintain , preserve, keep , possess , have , use , employ , practise , undergo"<ref>Monier Willams</ref>}} and takes a meaning of "what is established or firm", and hence "law".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rajiv-malhotra/dharma-religion_b_875314.html | title=Dharma Is Not The Same As Religion | publisher=The Huffington Post | date=13 June 2011 | accessdate=24 April 2015 | author=Malhotra, Rajiv}}</ref> It is derived from an older [[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''n''-stem ''dharman-'', with a literal meaning of "bearer, supporter", in a [[Historical Vedic religion|religious sense]]  conceived as an aspect of [[Rta]].{{sfn|Day|1982|p=42-45}}

In the [[Rigveda]], the word appears as an ''n''-stem, ''{{IAST|dhárman-}}'', with a range of meanings encompassing "something established or firm" (in the literal sense of prods or poles). Figuratively, it means "sustainer" and "supporter" (of deities). It is semantically similar to the Greek ''[[ethos]]'' ("fixed decree, statute, law").<ref name=brereton>{{cite journal|last=Brereton|first=Joel P.|title=Dhárman in the Ṛgveda|journal=Journal of Indian Philosophy|year=2004|volume=32|pages=449–89|doi=10.1007/s10781-004-8631-8}}</ref> In [[Classical Sanskrit]], the noun becomes thematic: ''{{IAST|dharma-}}''.

The word ''dharma'' derives from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*dʰer-'' ("to hold"),<ref>{{Cite book |editor-first=Helmut |editor-last=Rix |editor-link=Helmut Rix |title=[[Lexikon der indogermanischen Verben]] |year=2001 |language=German |page=145 |publisher=Dr. Ludwig Reichert Verlag |edition=2nd |location=Wiesbaden}}</ref> which in Sanskrit is reflected as class-1 root ''[[wikt:धरति#Sanskrit|√dhṛ]]''. Etymologically it is related to [[Avestan language|Avestan]] √dar- ("to hold"), Latin ''[[wikt:frenum#Latin|frēnum]]'' ("rein, horse tack"), Lithuanian ''[[wikt:derėti#Lithuanian|derė́ti]]'' ("to be suited, fit"), Lithuanian ''dermė'' ("agreement")<ref>Karl Brugmann, Elements of the Comparative Grammar of the Indo-Germanic languages,  Volume III, B. Westermann & Co., New York, 1892, p. 100</ref> and ''darna'' ("harmony") and [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''[[wikt:дръжати#Old Church Slavonic|drъžati]]'' ("to hold, possess"). Classical Sanskrit word ''dharmas'' would formally match with Latin o-stem ''[[wikt:firmus#Latin|firmus]]'' from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] *''dʰer-mo-s'' "holding", were it not for its historical development from earlier Rigvedic n-stem.

In Classical Sanskrit, and in the [[Vedic Sanskrit]] of the [[Atharvaveda]], the stem is thematic: ''{{IAST|dhárma-}}'' ([[Devanāgarī]]: धर्म). In [[Pāli]], it is rendered ''dhamma''. In some [[Indo-Aryan languages#Contemporary languages|contemporary Indian languages]] and dialects it alternatively occurs as ''dharm''.

==Definition==
Dharma is a concept of central importance in [[Indian philosophy]] and [[Indian religions|religion]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dhand|first=Arti|title=The Dharma of Ethics, the Ethics of Dharma : Quizzing the Ideals of Hinduism|journal=Journal Of Religious Ethics|date=Fall 2002|volume=30|issue=3|page=351|accessdate=10 May 2013|doi=10.1111/1467-9795.00113}}</ref> It has multiple meanings in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.<ref name="EB-Dharma" /> It is difficult to provide a single concise definition for ''dharma'', as the word has a long and varied history and straddles a complex set of meanings and interpretations.<ref>J. A. B. Van Buitenen, Dharma and Moksa, Philosophy East and West, Volume 7, Number 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), page 36</ref> There is no equivalent single word translation for ''dharma'' in western languages.<ref name=lraw>see:

There have been numerous, conflicting attempts to translate ancient Sanskrit literature with the word dharma into German, English and French. The concept, claims Paul Horsch,<ref name=paulhorsch/> has caused exceptional difficulties for modern commentators and translators. For example, while Grassmann<ref>Hermann Grassmann, Worterbuch zum Rig-veda (German Edition), Motilal Banarsidass, ISBN 978-8120816367</ref> translation of Rig-veda identifies seven different meanings of dharma, [[Karl Friedrich Geldner]] in his translation of the Rig-veda employs 20 different translations for dharma, including meanings such as ‘law’, ‘order’, ‘duty’, ‘custom’, ‘quality’, ‘model’, among others.<ref name=paulhorsch/>

Dharma root is "dhri", which means ‘to support, hold, or bear’. It is the thing that regulates the course of change by not participating in change, but that principle which remains constant.<ref name=stevenrosen>Steven Rosen (2006), Essential Hinduism, Praeger, ISBN 0-275-99006-0, page 34-45</ref> Monier-Williams, the widely cited resource for definitions and explanation of Sanskrit words and concepts of Hinduism, offers<ref>see:

Yet, each of these definitions is incomplete, while combination of these translations do not convey the total sense of the word. In common parlance, ''dharma'' means ‘right way of living’ and ‘path of righteousness’.<ref name=stevenrosen/>

The meaning of word “dharma” depends on the context, and its meaning evolved as ideas of Hinduism developed over its long history. In earliest texts and ancient myths of Hinduism, ''dharma'' meant cosmic law, the rules that created the universe from chaos, as well as rituals; In later Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas and the Epics, the meaning became refined, richer, complex and the word dharma was applied to diverse contexts.<ref name=phph>see:

In certain contexts, ''dharma'' designates human behaviours considered necessary for order of things in the universe, principles that prevent chaos, behaviours and action necessary to all life in nature, society, family as well as at the individual level.<ref name="ODWR-Dharma" /><ref name=phph/><ref>see:

In Buddhism and Jainism, ''dharma'' incorporates the teachings and doctrines of the founders of Buddhism and Jainism, [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]] and [[Mahavira]].

==History==
According to the authoritative book ''[[History of Dharmasastra (P.V. Kane)|History of Dharmasastra]]'', in the hymns of the Rigveda the word Dharma appears at least fifty-six times, as an adjective or noun. According to Paul Horsch,<ref name=paulhorsch>Paul Horsch - From Creation Myth to World Law: the Early History of Dharma, Journal of Indian Philosophy, December 2004, Volume 32, Issue 5-6, pp 423-448</ref> the word Dharma has its origin in the myths of Vedic Hinduism. The Brahman (whom all the gods make up), claim the hymns of the Rig Veda, created the universe from chaos, they hold (dhar-) the earth and sun and stars apart, they support (dhar-) the sky away and distinct from earth, and they stabilize (dhar-) the quaking mountains and plains.<ref name=paulhorsch/><ref>RgVeda 6.70.1, 8.41.10, 10.44.8, for secondary source see [[Karl Friedrich Geldner]], Der Rigveda in Auswahl (2 vols.), Stuttgart; and [[Harvard Oriental Series]], 33-36, Bd.1-3: 1951</ref> The gods, mainly [[Indra]], then deliver and hold order from disorder, harmony from chaos, stability from instability - actions recited in the Veda with the root of word dharma.<ref name=phph/> In hymns composed after the mythological verses, the word dharma takes expanded meaning as a cosmic principle and appears in verses independent of gods. It evolves into a concept, claims Paul Horsch,<ref name=paulhorsch/> that has a dynamic functional sense in [[Atharvaveda]] for example, where it becomes the cosmic law that links cause and effect through a subject. Dharma, in these ancient texts, also takes a ritual meaning. The ritual is connected to the cosmic, and ‘‘dharmani’’ is equated to ceremonial devotion to the principles that gods used to create order from disorder, the world from chaos.<ref>Paul Horsch - From Creation Myth to World Law: the Early History of Dharma, Journal of Indian Philosophy, December 2004, Volume 32, Issue 5-6, pp 430-431</ref> Past the ritual and cosmic sense of dharma that link the current world to mythical universe, the concept extends to ethical-social sense that links human beings to each other and to other life forms. It is here that dharma as a concept of law emerges in Hinduism.<ref>P. Thieme, Gedichte aus dem Rig-Veda, Reclam Universal-Bibliothek Nr. 8930, pp. 52</ref><ref>Paul Horsch - From Creation Myth to World Law: the Early History of Dharma, Journal of Indian Philosophy, December 2004, Volume 32, Issue 5-6, pp 430-432</ref>

Dharma and related words are found in the oldest Vedic literature of Hinduism, in later Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas, and the Epics; the word dharma also plays a central role in the literature of other Indian religions founded later, such as Buddhism and Jainism.<ref name="phph"/> According to Brereton,<ref name=jbrereton/> ''Dharman'' occurs 63 times in [[Rigveda|Rig-veda]]; in addition, words related to Dharman also appear in Rig-veda, for example once as dharmakrt, 6 times as ''satyadharman'', and once as ''dharmavant'', 4 times as ''dharman'' and twice as ''dhariman''. There is no Iranian equivalent in old Persian for Dharma, suggesting the word dharman had origins in Indo-Aryan culture outside of Persia, or it is a concept that is indigenous to India.<ref name=jbrereton>Joel Brereton (2004), Dharman in the RgVeda, Journal of Indian Philosophy,  Vol. 32, pp 449-489</ref> However, ideas in parts overlapping to ''Dharma'' are found in other ancient cultures: such as Chinese [[Tao]], Egyptian [[Maat]], Sumerian [[Me (mythology)|Me]].<ref name="stevenrosen"/>

===Eusebeia and dharma===
[[File:AsokaKandahar.jpg|thumb|220px|Above rock inscription is from Indian [[Emperor Asoka]], from 258 BC, and found in [[Afghanistan]]. The inscription renders the word ''Dharma'' in Sanskrit as [[Eusebeia]] in Greek, suggesting ''Dharma'' in ancient India meant spiritual maturity, devotion, piety, duty towards and reverence for human community.<ref name=paulhacker/>]]
In mid 20th century, an inscription of the Indian [[Emperor Asoka]] from the year 258 BC was discovered in Afghanistan. This rock inscription contained Sanskrit, [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] text. According to [[:de:Paul Hacker|Paul Hacker]],<ref name=paulhacker/> on the rock appears a Greek rendering for the Sanskrit word dharma: the word [[eusebeia]].<ref name=paulhacker>Paul Hacker (1965), Dharma in Hinduism, ''[[Journal of Indian Philosophy]]'', Volume 34, Issue 5, pp 479–496 (English translated version by Donald R. Davis (2006))</ref> Scholars of Hellenistic Greece explain eusebeia as a complex concept. Eusebia means not only to venerate gods, but also spiritual maturity, a reverential attitude toward life, and includes the right conduct toward one’s parents, siblings and children, the right conduct between husband and wife, and the conduct between biologically unrelated people. This rock inscription, concludes Paul Hacker,<ref name=paulhacker/> suggests dharma in India, about 2300 years ago, was a central concept and meant not only religious ideas, but ideas of right, of good, of one’s duty toward the human community.<ref>[[Etienne Lamotte]], Bibliotheque du Museon 43, Louvain, 1958, pp. 249</ref>

===Rta, Maya and Dharma===
The evolving literature of Hinduism linked ''Dharma'' to two other important concepts: ''Ṛta'' and ''Māyā''. [[Ṛta]] in Vedas is the truth and cosmic principle which regulates and coordinates the operation of the universe and everything within it.<ref>Barbara Holdrege (2004), "Dharma" in: Mittal & Thursby (Editors) The Hindu World, New York: Routledge, ISBN 0-415-21527-7, pp. 213–248</ref><ref name=koller/> [[Māyā]] in Rig-veda and later literature means illusion, fraud, deception, magic that misleads and creates disorder,<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0800/mw__0844.html Māyā] Monier-Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary, ISBN 978-8120603691</ref> thus is contrary to reality, laws and rules that establish order, predictability and harmony. Paul Horsch<ref name=paulhorsch/> suggests Ṛta and Dharma are parallel concepts, the former being a cosmic principle, the latter being of moral social sphere; while Māyā and Dharma are also analogous concepts, the former being that which corrupts law and moral life, the later being that which strengthens law and moral life.<ref name=koller>Koller, J. M. (1972), Dharma: an expression of universal order. Philosophy East and West, 22(2), pp 136-142</ref><ref>Northrop, F. S. C. (1949), Naturalistic and cultural foundations for a more effective international law, Yale Law Journal, 59, pp 1430-1441</ref>

Day proposes Dharma is a manifestation of Ṛta, but suggests Ṛta may have been subsumed into a more complex concept of Dharma, as the idea developed in ancient India over time in a nonlinear manner.{{sfn|Day|1982|p=42-44}} The following verse from the [[Rigveda]] is an example where ''rta'' and dharma are linked:
{{quote|O Indra, lead us on the path of Rta, on the right path over all evils|[[Mandala 10|RV 10]].133.6}}

==Hinduism==
{{Hinduism small}}
Dharma in Hinduism, is an organizing principle that applies to human beings in solitude, in their interaction with human beings and nature, as well as between inanimate objects, to all of cosmos and its parts.<ref name=stevenrosen/> It refers to the order and customs which make life and universe possible, and includes behaviors, rituals, rules that govern society, and ethics.<ref name="ODWR-Dharma" />{{refn|group=note|name="ODWR-Dharma"}} Hindu dharma includes the religious duties, moral rights and duties of each individual, as well as behaviors that enable social order, right conduct, and those that are virtuous.<ref>Dharma, The Columbia Encyclopedia, 6th Ed. (2013), Columbia University Press, Gale, ISBN 978-0787650155</ref> Dharma, according to Van Buitenen,<ref name=vanbuitenen>J. A. B. Van Buitenen, Dharma and Moksa, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp 33-40</ref> is that which all existing beings must accept and respect to sustain harmony and order in the world. It is neither the act nor the result, but the natural laws that guide the act and create the result to prevent chaos in the world. It is innate characteristic, that makes the being what it is. It is, claims Van Buitenen, the pursuit and execution of one’s nature and true calling, thus playing one’s role in cosmic concert. In Hinduism, it is the dharma of the bee to make honey, of cow to give milk, of sun to radiate sunshine, of river to flow.<ref name=vanbuitenen/> In terms of humanity, dharma is the need for, the effect of and essence of service and interconnectedness of all life.<ref name=stevenrosen/><ref name=paulhacker/>

===Dharma in Vedas and Upanishads===
The [[Dharma#History|history section]] of this article discusses the development of dharma concept in Vedas. This development continued in the Upanishads and later ancient scripts of Hinduism. In Upanishads, the concept of dharma continues as universal principle of law, order, harmony, and truth. It acts as the regulatory moral principle of the Universe. It is explained as law of righteousness and equated to ''[[satya]]'' (Sanskrit: सत्यं, truth),<ref name=chjo/><ref name=paulh/> in hymn 1.4.14 of Brhadaranyaka Upanishad, as follows:

{{quote|
धर्मः तस्माद्धर्मात् परं नास्त्य् अथो अबलीयान् बलीयाँसमाशँसते धर्मेण यथा राज्ञैवम् ।<br>
यो वै स धर्मः सत्यं वै तत् तस्मात्सत्यं वदन्तमाहुर् धर्मं वदतीति धर्मं वा वदन्तँ सत्यं वदतीत्य् एतद्ध्येवैतदुभयं भवति ।।

Nothing is higher than Dharma. The weak overcomes the stronger by Dharma, as over a king. Truly that Dharma is the Truth (''Satya''); Therefore, when a man speaks the Truth, they say, "He speaks the Dharma"; and if he speaks Dharma, they say, "He speaks the Truth!" For both are one.|[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]|1.4.xiv <ref name=chjo>[[Charles Johnston (Theosophist)|Charles Johnston]], The Mukhya Upanishads: Books of Hidden Wisdom, Kshetra, ISBN 978-1495946530, page 481, for discussion: pages 478-505</ref><ref name=paulh>Paul Horsch (Translated by Jarrod Whitaker), ''From Creation Myth to World Law: The early history of Dharma'', Journal of Indian Philosophy, Vol 32, pages 423–448, (2004)</ref>}}

===Dharma in the Epics===
The Hindu religion and philosophy, claims [[Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Sr.|Daniel Ingall]],<ref>Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Dharma and Moksa, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp. 43</ref> places major emphasis on individual practical morality. In the Sanskrit epics, this concern is omnipresent.

In the Second Book of [[Ramayana]], for example, a peasant asks the King to do what dharma morally requires of him, the King agrees and does so even though his compliance with the law of dharma costs him dearly. Similarly, dharma is at the center of all major events in the life of Rama, Sita, and Lakshman in Ramayana, claims Daniel Ingall.<ref name=danielingalls>Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Dharma and Moksa, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp. 41-48</ref> Each episode of Ramayana presents life situations and ethical questions in symbolic terms. The issue is debated by the characters, finally the right prevails over wrong, the good over evil. For this reason, in Hindu Epics, the good, morally upright, law abiding king is referred to ‘‘dharmaraja’’.<ref>The Mahābhārata: Book 11: The Book of the Women; Book 12: The Book of Peace, Part 1 By Johannes Adrianus Bernardus Buitenen, James L.

In [[Mahabharata]], the other major Indian epic, similarly, dharma is central, and it is presented with symbolism and metaphors. Near the end of the epic, the god Yama, referred to as Dharma in the text, is portrayed as taking the form of a dog to test the compassion of Yudishthira, who is told he may not enter paradise with such an animal, but refuses to abandon his companion, for which decision he is then praised by Dharma.<ref>http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m17/m17003.htm</ref> The value and appeal of the Mahabharata is not as much in its complex and rushed presentation of metaphysics in the 12th book, claims Ingall,<ref name=danielingalls/> because Indian metaphysics is more eloquently presented in other Sanskrit scriptures; the appeal of Mahabharata, like Ramayana, is in its presentation of a series of moral problems and life situations, to which there are usually three answers given, according to Ingall:<ref name=danielingalls/> one answer is of [[Bhima]], which is the answer of brute force, an individual angle representing materialism, egoism, and self; the second answer is of [[Yudhishthira]], which is always an appeal to piety and gods, of social virtue and of tradition; the third answer is of introspective [[Arjuna]], which falls between the two extremes, and who, claims Ingall, symbolically reveals the finest moral qualities of man. The Epics of Hinduism are a symbolic treatise about life, virtues, customs, morals, ethics, law, and other aspects of Dharma.<ref>There is considerable amount of literature on dharma-related discussion in Hindu Epics: of Egoism versus Altruism, Individualism versus Social Virtues and Tradition; for examples, see:
* Johann Jakob Meyer (1989), Sexual life in ancient India, ISBN 8120806387, Motilal Banarsidass, pp. 92-93; Quote - “In Indian literature, especially in Mahabharata over and over again is heard the energetic cry - Each is alone. None belongs to anyone else, we are all but strangers to strangers; (...), none knows the other, the self belongs only to self. Man is born alone, alone he lives, alone he dies, alone he tastes the fruit of his deeds and his ways, it is only his work that bears him company. (...) Our body and spiritual organism is ever changing; what belongs, then, to us? (...) Thus, too, there is really no teacher or leader for anyone, each is his own Guru, and must go along the road to happiness alone. Only the self is the friend of man, only the self is the foe of man; from others nothing comes to him. Therefore what must be done is to honor, to assert one’s self...”; Quote - “(in parts of the epic), the most thoroughgoing egoism and individualism is stressed...”

H. Ingalls, Sr.|Ingall]]; for example, on free will versus destiny, when and why human beings believe in either, ultimately concluding that the strong and prosperous naturally uphold free will, while those facing grief or frustration naturally lean towards destiny.<ref>Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Dharma and Moksa, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp. 44-45; Quote - “(...)In the Epic, free will has the upper hand. Only when a man’s effort is frustrated or when he is overcome with grief does he become a predestinarian (believer in destiny).”; quote - “This association of success with the doctrine of free will or human effort (purusakara) was felt so clearly that among the ways of bringing about a king’s downfall is given the following simple advice: “Belittle free will to him, and emphasize destiny.” (Mahabharata 12.106.20)</ref> The Epics of Hinduism illustrate various aspects of Dharma, they are a means of communicating Dharma with metaphors.<ref>[[Huston Smith]], The World Religions, ISBN 978-0061660184, HarperOne (2009); For summary notes: [http://staff.gps.edu/montgomery/World%20Religions/Faiths/hinduism/Background%20to%20Hindu%20Literature.htm Background to Hindu Literature]</ref>

===Dharma according to 4th century Vatsyayana===
According to [[Klaus Klostermaier]], 4th century Hindu scholar [[Vātsyāyana]] explained dharma by contrasting it with adharma.<ref name=klausk>Klaus Klostermaier, A survey of Hinduism,, SUNY Press, ISBN 0-88706-807-3, Chapter 3: Hindu dharma</ref> Vātsyāyana suggested that Dharma is not merely in one’s actions, but also in words one speaks or writes, and in thought. According to Vātsyāyana:<ref name=klausk/><ref>Jha, Nyayasutras with Vatsyayana Bhasya, 2 vols, Oriental Books (1939)</ref>

# Adharma of body: himsa (violence), steya (steal, theft), pratisiddha maithuna (sexual indulgence with someone other than one’s partner)
# Dharma of body: dana (charity), paritrana (succor of the distressed) and paricarana (rendering service to others)
# Adharma from words one speaks or writes: mithya (falsehood), parusa (caustic talk), sucana (calumny) and asambaddha (absurd talk)
# Dharma from words one speaks or writes: satya (truth and facts), hitavacana (talking with good intention), priyavacana (gentle, kind talk), svadhyaya (self study)
# Adharma of mind: paradroha (ill will to anyone), paradravyabhipsa (covetousness), nastikya (denial of the existence of morals and religiosity)
# Dharma of mind: daya (compassion), asprha (disinterestedness), and sraddha (faith in others)

===Dharma according to Patanjali Yoga===
Dharma is part of [[yoga]], suggests Patanjali; the elements of Hindu Dharma are the attributes, qualities and aspects of yoga.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/yogasystemofpata00wooduoft The yoga-system of Patanjali] The ancient Hindu doctrine of concentration of mind, embracing the mnemonic rules, called Yoga-sutras, James Haughton Woods (1914), Harvard University Press</ref> Patanjali explained dharma in two categories: yama (restraints) and niyama (observances).<ref name=klausk/>

The five yama, according to Patanjali, are: abstain from injury to all living creatures ([[ahimsa]]), abstain from falsehood (satya), abstain from unauthorized appropriation of things-of-value from another (acastrapurvaka), abstain from coveting or sexually cheating on your partner, and abstain from expecting or accepting gifts from others.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/yogasystemofpata00wooduoft The yoga-system of Patanjali] Yoga-sutras, James Haughton Woods (1914), Harvard University Press, pp 178-180</ref> The five yama apply in action, speech and mind. In explaining yama, Patanjali clarifies that certain professions and situations may require qualification in conduct. For example, a fisherman must injure a fish, but he must attempt to do this with least trauma to fish and the fisherman must try to injure no other creature as he fishes.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/yogasystemofpata00wooduoft The yoga-system of Patanjali] Yoga-sutras, James Haughton Woods (1914), Harvard University Press, pp 180-181</ref>

The five niyama (observances) are cleanliness by eating pure food and removing impure thoughts such as arrogance or jealousy or pride, contentment in one’s means, meditation and silent reflection regardless of circumstances one faces, study and pursuit of historic knowledge, and devotion of all actions to the Supreme Teacher to achieve perfection of concentration.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/yogasystemofpata00wooduoft The yoga-system of Patanjali] Yoga-sutras, James Haughton Woods (1914), Harvard University Press, pp 181-191</ref>

===Sources of Dharma===
Dharma is an empirical and experiential inquiry for every man and woman, according to some texts of Hinduism.<ref name=paulhacker/><ref>Kumarila, Tantravarttika, Anandasramasamskrtagranthavalih, Vol. 97, p.204-205; For an English Translation, see Jha (1924), Bibliotheca Indica, Vol. 161, Vol. 1</ref> For example, [[Apastamba|Apastamba Dharmasutra]] states:

{{quote| ''Dharma'' and ''Adharma'' do not go around saying, ‘‘That is us.’’ Neither do gods, nor gandharvas, nor ancestors declare what is ''Dharma'' and what is ''Adharma''.| ''Apastamba Dharmasutra''<ref>[[Patrick Olivelle]], Dharmasūtras: The Law Codes of Ancient India, (Oxford World Classics, 1999)</ref>}}

In other texts, three sources and means to discover Dharma in Hinduism are described. These, according to [[:de:Paul Hacker|Paul Hacker]], are:<ref name=ph79/> First, learning historical knowledge such as Vedas, Upanishads, the Epics and other Sanskrit literature with the help of one’s teacher. Second, observing the behavior and example of good people. The third source applies when neither one’s education nor example exemplary conduct is known. In this case, ‘‘[[atmatusti]]’’ is the source of dharma in Hinduism, that is the good person reflects and follows what satisfies his heart, his own inner feeling, what he feels driven to.<ref name=ph79>Paul Hacker (1965), Dharma in Hinduism, Journal of Indian Philosophy, Volume 34, Issue 5, pp 487–489 (English translated version by Donald R. Davis (2006))</ref>

===Dharma, life stages and social stratification===
{{main|Ashrama (stage)|Puruṣārtha|l1=Āśrama}}
Some texts of Hinduism outline ''Dharma'' for society and at the individual level. Of these, the most cited one is ''[[Manusmriti]]'', which describes the four ''Varnas'', their rights and duties.<ref name=alfh>[[Alf Hiltebeitel]] (2011), Dharma: Its Early History in Law, Religion, and Narrative, ISBN 978-0195394238, Oxford University Press, pp 215-227</ref> Most texts of Hinduism, however, discuss ''Dharma'' with no mention of ''Varna'' ([[Caste system in India|caste]]).<ref>Thapar, R. (1995), The first millennium BC in northern India, Recent perspectives of early Indian history, 80-141</ref> Other Dharma texts and Smritis differ from Manusmriti on the nature and structure of Varnas.<ref name=alfh/> Yet, other texts question the very existence of varna. [[Bhrigu]], in the Epics, for example, presents the theory that dharma does not require any varnas.<ref>Thomas R. Trautmann (1964), On the Translation of the Term Varna, Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient, Vol. 7, No. 2 (Jul., 1964), pp. 196-201</ref> In practice, medieval India is widely believed to be a socially stratified society, with each social strata inheriting a profession and being endogamous. Varna was not absolute in Hindu Dharma; individuals had the right to renounce and leave their Varna, as well as their [[Ashrama (stage)|asramas]] of life, in search of moksa.<ref name=alfh/><ref>see:
* J. A. B. Van Buitenen (1957), Dharma and Moksa, Philosophy East and West, Volume 7, Number 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp 38-39
* Koller, J. M. (1972), Dharma: an expression of universal order. Philosophy East and West, 22(2), pp 131-144</ref> While neither Manusmriti nor succeeding Smritis of Hinduism ever use the word varnadharma (that is, the dharma of varnas), or varnasramadharma (that is, the dharma of varnas and asramas), the scholarly commentary on Manusmriti use these words, and thus associate dharma with varna system of India.<ref name=alfh/><ref>Kane, P.V. (1962), History of Dharmasastra (Ancient and Medieval Religious and Civil Law in India), Volume 1, pp 2-10</ref> In 6th century India, even Buddhist kings called themselves ‘protectors of varnasramadharma’ - that is, dharma of varna and asramas of life.<ref name=alfh/><ref>Olivelle, P. (1993), The Asrama System: The history and hermeneutics of a religious institution, New York: Oxford University Press</ref>

At the individual level, some texts of Hinduism outline [[Ashrama (stage)|four āśrama]]s, or stages of life as individual’s dharma. These are:<ref>Alban G. Widgery, The Principles of Hindu Ethics, International Journal of Ethics, Vol. 40, No. 2 (Jan., 1930), pp. 232-245</ref> (1) [[Brahmacharya|brahmacārya]], the life of preparation as a student, (2) [[Grihastha|gṛhastha]], the life of the householder with family and other social roles, (3) [[Vanaprastha|vānprastha]] or aranyaka, the life of the forest-dweller, transitioning from worldly occupations to reflection and renunciation, and (4) [[sannyāsa]], the life of giving away all property, becoming a recluse and devotion to moksa, spiritual matters.

The four stages of life complete the four human strivings in life, according to Hinduism.<ref name=jkkpwg/> Dharma enables the individual to satisfy the striving for stability and order, a life that is lawful and harmonious, the striving to do the right thing, be good, be virtuous, earn religious merit, be helpful to others, interact successfully with society. The other three strivings are [[Artha]] - the striving for means of life such as food, shelter, power, security, material wealth, etc.; [[Kama]] - the striving for sex, desire, pleasure, love, emotional fulfillment, etc.; and [[Moksa]] - the striving for spiritual meaning, liberation from life-rebirth cycle, self-realization in this life, etc. The four stages are neither independent nor exclusionary in Hindu Dharma.<ref name=jkkpwg>see:

* William F. Goodwin, Ethics and Value in Indian Philosophy, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 4, No. 4 (Jan., 1955), pp. 321-344</ref>

===Dharma and poverty===
Dharma while being necessary for individual and society, is dependent on poverty and prosperity in a society, according to Hindu Dharma scriptures. For example, according to Adam Bowles,<ref name=adambowles>Adam Bowles (2007), Dharma, Disorder, and the Political in Ancient India, Brill's Indological Library (Book 28), ISBN 978-9004158153, Chapter 3</ref> [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] 11.1.6.24 links social prosperity and ''Dharma'' through water. Waters come from rains, it claims; when rains are abundant there is prosperity on the earth, and this prosperity enables people to follow Dharma - moral and lawful life. In times of distress, of drought, of poverty, everything suffers including relations between human beings and the human ability to live according to Dharma.<ref name=adambowles/>

In Rajadharmaparvan 91.34-8, the relationship between poverty and dharma reaches a full circle. A land with less moral and lawful life suffers distress, and as distress rises it causes more immoral and unlawful life, which further increases distress.<ref name=adambowles/><ref>Derrett, J. D. M. (1959), Bhu-bharana, bhu-palana, bhu-bhojana: an Indian conundrum, Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, 22, pp 108-123</ref> Those in power must follow the raja dharma (that is, dharma of rulers), because this enables the society and the individual to follow dharma and achieve prosperity.<ref>[[Jan Gonda]], Ancient Indian Kingship from the Religious Point of View, Numen, Vol. 3, Issue 1 (Jan., 1956), pp. 36-71</ref>

===Dharma and law===
{{main|Hindu law}}
The notion of ''Dharma'' as duty or propriety is found in India's ancient legal and religious texts. In Hindu philosophy, justice, social harmony, and happiness requires that people live per dharma. The [[Dharmashastra]] is a record of these guidelines and rules.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gächter|first=Othmar|title=Anthropos|journal=Anthropos institute|year=1998}}</ref> The available evidence suggest India once had a large collection of dharma related literature (sutras, shastras); four of the sutras survive and these are now referred to as Dharmasutras.<ref name=polivelle/> Along with laws of Manu in Dharmasutras, exist parallel and different compendium of laws, such as the laws of Narada and other ancient scholars.<ref>Donald Davis, Jr., A Realist View of Hindu Law, Ratio Juris. Vol. 19 No. 3 September 2006, pp 287–313</ref><ref>Lariviere, Richard W. (2003), The Naradasmrti, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass</ref> These different and conflicting law books are neither exclusive, nor do they supersede other sources of Dharma in Hinduism. These Dharmasutras include instructions on education of the young, their rites of passage, customs, religious rites and rituals, marital rights and obligations, death and ancestral rites, laws and administration of justice, crimes, punishments, rules and types of evidence, duties of a king, as well as morality.<ref name=polivelle>Patrick Olivelle (1999), The Dharmasutras: The law codes of ancient India, Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-283882-2</ref>

==Buddhism==
{{Buddhism}}

In Buddhism ''dharma'' means cosmic law and order,<ref name="ODWR-Dharma" /> but is also applied to the teachings of the Buddha.<ref name="ODWR-Dharma" /> In [[Buddhist philosophy]], ''[[Dharma (Buddhism)|dhamma/dharma]]'' is also the term for "[[phenomena]]":<ref name="david"/> In East Asia, the translation for dharma is [[wiktionary:法|法]], pronounced ''fǎ'' in Mandarin, ''choe ཆོས་'' in Tibetan, ''beop'' in Korean, ''hō'' in Japanese, and ''pháp'' in Vietnamese. However, the term dharma can also be transliterated from its original form.

===Buddha's teachings===
For practicing Buddhists, references to "dharma" (''dhamma'' in Pali) particularly as "the Dharma", generally means the teachings of the Buddha, commonly known throughout the East as Buddha-Dharma. It includes especially the discourses on the fundamental principles (such as the [[Four Noble Truths]] and the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]), as opposed to the parables and to the poems.

The status of Dharma is regarded variably by different Buddhist traditions. Some regard it as an ultimate truth, or as the fount of all things which lies beyond the "[[three realms]]" (Sanskrit: ''tridhatu'') and the "wheel of becoming" (Sanskrit: ''[[bhavacakra]]''), somewhat like the pagan Greek and Christian [[logos]]: this is known as ''[[Dharmakaya]]'' (Sanskrit). Others, who regard the Buddha as simply an enlightened human being, see the Dharma as the [[essence]] of the "84,000 different aspects of the teaching" (Tibetan: ''chos-sgo brgyad-khri bzhi strong'') that the Buddha gave to various types of people, based upon their individual propensities and capabilities.

Dharma refers not only to the sayings of the Buddha, but also to the later traditions of interpretation and addition that the various [[schools of Buddhism]] have developed to help explain and to expand upon the Buddha's teachings. For others still, they see the Dharma as referring to the "truth," or the ultimate reality of "the way that things really are" (Tib. Cho).

The Dharma is one of the [[Three Jewels]] of Buddhism in which practitioners of Buddhism seek refuge, or that upon which one relies for his or her lasting happiness. The Three Jewels of Buddhism are the [[Buddhahood|Buddha]], meaning the mind's perfection of enlightenment, the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]], meaning the teachings and the methods of the Buddha, and the [[Sangha]], meaning the monastic community who provide guidance and support to followers of the Buddha.

===Buddhist phenomenology===
<!-- This section is linked from [[Buddhist philosophy]] -->
Other uses include dharma, normally spelled with a small "d" (to differentiate), which refers to a ''phenomenon'' or ''constituent factor'' of human experience. This was gradually expanded into a classification of constituents of the entire material and mental world. Rejecting the substantial existence of permanent entities which are qualified by possibly changing qualities, Buddhist [[Abhidharma]] philosophers enumerated lists of dharmas which varied by school. They came to propound that these "constituent factors" are the only type of entity that truly exists (and only some thinkers gave dharmas this kind of existence). This notion is of particular importance for the analysis of human experience: Rather than assuming that mental states inhere in a cognizing subject, or a soul-substance, Buddhist philosophers largely propose that mental states alone exist as "momentary elements of consciousness" and that a subjective perceiver is assumed.

One of the central tenets of Buddhism, is the denial of a separate permanent "I", and is outlined in the [[three marks of existence]].
# ''[[Dukkha]]'' – Suffering or unsatisfactoriness (Pali: ''Dukkha'')
# ''[[Anitya]]'' – Change/Impermanence (Pali: ''Anicca'')
# ''[[Anatman]]'' – Not-Self (Pali: ''[[Anatta]]'')

At the heart of Buddhism is the understanding of all phenomena as [[dependent origination|dependently originated]]. Later, Buddhist philosophers like [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]] would question whether the dharmas (momentary elements of consciousness) truly have a separate existence of their own.<ref>{{IAST|nirvṇānaparīkṣā}}, 25:22–24</ref>

According to [[S. N. Goenka]], the original meaning of dhamma is "''dharayati iti dharmaH''", or "one that contains, supports or upholds" and dharma in the Buddhist scriptures has a variety of meanings, including "phenomenon" and "nature" or "characteristic". Dharma also means "mental contents," and is paired with ''citta'', which means heart-mind. The pairing is paralleled with the combining of ''shareera'' (body) and ''vedana'' (feelings or sensations which arise within the body but are experienced through the mind) in major ''sutras'' such as the Mahasatipatthana sutra.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===East Asian Buddhism===
Dharma is employed in [[Ch'an]] in a specific context in relation to transmission of authentic doctrine, understanding and bodhi; recognized in [[Dharma transmission]].

==Jainism==
{{Main|Dharma (Jainism)}}
[[File:Jain Prateek Chihna.svg|thumb|160px|Jainism]]

In Jainism ''dharma'' refers to the teachings of the Jinas.<ref name="ODWR-Dharma" /> In [[Jainism]], dharma is natural. [[Acharya]] [[Samantabhadra]] writes, ''Vatthu sahavo dhammo'': "the dharma is the nature of an object". It is the nature of the soul to be free, thus for the soul, the dharma is ''paralaukika'', beyond worldly. However the nature of the body is to seek self-preservation and be engaged in pleasures. Thus there are two dharmas.

Acharya [[Haribhadra]] ({{circa}} 6th–7th centuries) discusses dharma in ''Dharma-Bindu''. He writes (translation by Y. Malaiya):

  {{IAST|soayam-anuṣṭhātṛ-bhedāt dvi-vidho}}<br />
  {{IAST|gṛhastha-dharmo yati-dharmaś ca}} |

Because of the difference in practice, dharma is of two kinds,
for the householders and for the monks.

  {{IAST|tatra gṛhastha-dharmo api dvi-vidhaḥ}}<br />
  {{IAST|sāmanyato viśeṣataś ca}} |

Of the householder's dharma, there are two kinds, "ordinary" and "special"

  {{IAST|tatra sāmanayato gṛhastha-dharmaḥ kula-krama-agatam-anindyaṃ}}<br />
  {{IAST|vibhavady-apekshayā nyāto anuṣṭhānaṃ}} |

The ordinary dharma of the householder should be carried out according to tradition, such that it is not objectionable, according to ones abilities such as wealth, in accordance with nyaya (everyone treated fairly and according to laws).

[[Somadeva]] suri (10th century) terms the "ordinary" and "special" dharmas ''laukika'' ("worldly") and ''pralaukika'' ("extra-worldly") respectively:

  {{IAST|dvau hi dharmau gṛhasthāṇam, laukikaḥ, pāralaukikaḥ}} |<br />
  {{IAST|lokāśrayo bhavedādyah, parah syād-āgama-āśrayaḥ}} ||

A householder follows both laukika and the paralaukika dharmas at the same time.

==Sikhism==
[[File:Khanda Orange.jpg|thumb|160px|Sikhism]]
{{main|Sikhism}}
For [[Sikh]]s, the word ''Dharm'' means the "path of righteousness" and proper religious practice.<ref>Robin Rinehart (2014), in Pashaura Singh, Louis E. Fenech (Editors), The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies, ISBN 978-0199699308, Oxford University Press, pp. 138-139</ref> Sikh Dharma is a distinct religion revealed through the teachings of ten Gurus who are accepted by the followers as if they were spiritually the same. In Sikhism, God is described as both ''[[Nirguna|Nirgun]]'' (transcendent) and ''[[Saguna|Sargun]]'' (immanent). [[Guru Granth Sahib]] in hymn 1353 connotes dharma as duty.<ref>W. Owen Cole (2014), in Pashaura Singh, Louis E. Fenech (Editors),  The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies, ISBN 978-0199699308, Oxford University Press, pp. 254</ref> The [[3HO]] movement in Western culture, which has incorporated certain Sikh beliefs, defines Sikh Dharma broadly as all that that constitutes religion, moral duty and way of life.<ref>Verne Dusenbery (2014), in Pashaura Singh and Louis E. Fenech (Editors),  The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies, ISBN 978-0199699308, Oxford University Press, pp. 560-568</ref>

===Scriptures and dharma===
The Guru Granth Sahib lays down the foundation of this "righteous path" and various salient points are found:{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}
* Sikh is bound by Dharma: The followers of this faith are bound by Dharma as advocated in their holy scriptures. The committed Sikh is encouraged to follow this path at all times. The first recitation of the Guru Granth Sahib called the [[Japji]] Sahib says the following: "The path of the faithful shall never be blocked. The faithful shall depart with honor and fame. The faithful do not follow empty religious rituals. The faithful people are fully bound to do whatever the Dharma wants them to do. Such is the Name of the Immaculate Lord. Only one who has faith comes to know such a state of mind." (14) ([[Guru Granth Sahib]] [[Japji]] page 3.)
* Deeds are recorded: The persons thoughts and deeds are said to be recorded and the faithful is warned that these will be read out in the presence of the "Lord of Dharma". Two scribes called ''Chitr'' and ''Gupt'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&Param=8&english=t&id=392#l392 |title=Sri Guru Granth Sahib |publisher=Sri Granth |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref> the angels of the conscious and the subconscious mind are busy writing ones thought and deeds. On death, the soul of the person he brought before "Lord of Dharma" are these account are read out as recorded in this quote: {{quote|Day and night are the two distracting but fascinating  nurses, in whose lap all the world forgetting reality is at play. Good deeds and bad deeds – the record is read out in the Presence of the Lord of Dharma. According to their own actions, some are drawn closer, and some are driven farther away. Those who have pondered on the Name have earned Merit through hard endeavor. Nanak, their faces radiant with Divine Light, many shall be emancipated in company with them.<ref>[http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&Param=8&english=t&id=382#l382 Guru Granth Sahib [[Japji]] page 8, Salok.]</ref>}}
* Dharma administered by God: The scriptures further outline how the "Judge of Dharma" administers justice depending on the way that one has conducted life on Earth. The soul is either "cleared" or "subject to God's command" depending on the review of the person history. The holy text says: "The Righteous Judge of Dharma, by the Hukam of God's Command, sits and administers True Justice".<ref>[http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&Param=38&english=t&id=1586#l1586 Guru Granth Sahib page 38]</ref> and those followers who "chant the name of the Lord" are cleared as outlined thus: "Her account is cleared by the Righteous Judge of Dharma, when she chants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har."<ref>[http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&Param=78&english=t&id=3145#l3145 Guru Granth Sahib page 78]</ref>

==Dharma in symbols==
[[File:Flag of India.png|thumb|200px|The wheel in the center of India’s flag symbolizes Dharma.]]
The importance of ''dharma'' to Indian sentiments is illustrated by India’s decision in 1947 to include the [[Ashoka Chakra]], a depiction of the ''[[dharmachakra]]'' ( the "wheel of dharma"),  as the central motif on its flag.<ref>Narula, S. (2006), International Journal of Constitutional Law, 4(4), pp 741-751</ref>
