'''Cow tipping''' is the purported activity of sneaking up on any unsuspecting or sleeping upright [[Cattle|cow]] and pushing it over for entertainment. The practice of cow tipping is generally considered an [[urban legend]], and the implication that a cow can be pushed over and not stand up again is incorrect, as, unless injured, cows routinely lie down and can easily regain their footing.  The implication that [[Rural area|rural]] citizens seek such entertainment due to lack of other alternatives is also generally viewed as a [[stereotype]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Winter|first1=Sam A.|title=Who You Calling a Hick?: Treatise of a Disgruntled Kansan|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2003/3/6/who-you-calling-a-hick-i/|accessdate=28 December 2014|work=The Harvard Crimson|date=March 6, 2003}}</ref>

==Scientific study==

The urban legend of cow tipping relies upon the presumption that cattle are slow-moving, dim-witted, and weak-legged, thus easily pushed over without much force. Some versions of the legend suggest that because cows sleep standing up, it is possible to approach them and push them over without the animals reacting.<ref name="register"/> However, cows only sleep lightly while standing up, and they are easily awoken from this state.<ref name = Cow1>{{cite news|last = Malvern|first = Jack|title = Cow-tipping myth hasn't got a leg to stand on|publisher = Times Online|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article1940322.ece|accessdate = 2006-10-28 | location=London | date=November 5, 2005|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110629083548/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article586737.ece|archivedate=2011-06-29|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Furthermore, numerous sources have questioned the practice's feasibility, since most cows weigh over half a ton, and easily resist any lesser force.<ref name = Cow1/><ref>{{cite web|last = Semke|first = Matt|title = The Statics of Cow Tipping|publisher = UNL College of Engineering and Mechanics Course Project|url = http://emweb.unl.edu/Mechanics-Pages/Matt-Semke/The%20Statics%20of%20Cow%20Tipping.htm|accessdate = 2007-04-17}}</ref>

A 2005 study led by Margo Lillie, a [[zoology|zoologist]] at the [[University of British Columbia]], concluded that tipping a cow would require an exertion of 2,910 [[newtons]] (654.2 [[lbf|lb<sub>f</sub>]]) of force,<ref name="register">{{cite news|last=Haines|first=Lester|title=Boffins debunk cow-tipping myth|newspaper=The Register|date=9 November 2005|accessdate=30 November 2012|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/11/09/cow_tipping}}</ref> and is therefore impossible to accomplish by a single person. Her calculations found that it would take at least two people to apply enough force to push over a cow if the cow did not react and reorient its footing. If the cow did react, it would take at least four people to push it over. Lillie noted that cattle are well aware of their surroundings and are very difficult to surprise, due to excellent senses of both smell and hearing,<ref name = Cow1/><ref name = "Debunk">{{Cite news|last = Colebourn|first = John|title = Debunking rural myth of cow tipping: It's udder nonsense, academics contend|newspaper = Montreal Gazette|pages = A10|date = November 9, 2005|url=|postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref><ref>Ian Denomme, "[http://www.gazette.uwo.ca/article.cfm?section=FrontPage&articleID=465&month=11&day=9&year=2005 Cow-tipping a mooo-yth?]", ''The Gazette'' (Western Daily Student Newspaper), November 9, 2005.

==Historical origins==
The belief that certain animals cannot rise if pushed over has historical antecedents, though cattle have never been so classified. [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] record a belief that European [[moose]] had no knee joints and could not get up if they fell over.<ref>{{Cite book | publisher = Harper & brothers | last = Caesar | first = Julius |author2=Aulus Hirtius | title = Caesar's Commentaries on the Gallic and civil wars | chapter = XXVII | page = 154 | year = 1879 | isbn = 0-217-45287-6 }}</ref><ref>https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10657/pg10657.txt</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Pliny the Elder, The Natural History (eds.

In 1255, [[Louis IX of France]] [[Sandwich, Kent#History|gave an elephant]] to [[Henry III of England]] for his [[menagerie]] in the [[Tower of London]]. Drawn from life by the historian [[Matthew Paris]] for his [[Chronica Majora]], it can be seen in his [[bestiary]] at [[Parker Library]] of [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], with an accompanying text revealing that at the time, Europeans believed that elephants did not have knees and so were unable to get up if they fell over. The bestiary contains a drawing depicting an elephant on its back being dragged along the ground by another elephant, with a caption stating that elephants lacked knees.<ref>Willene B.
