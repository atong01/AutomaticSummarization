Gaud was hired in September to design his new home, and on February 2 of 1905 the project was presented to the City Council and the work began. It was decided to demolish the existing building rather than reforming it, as had been done in the case of the Casa Batll. The building was completed in December 1910, and in October, 1911 the Mil moved there. Finally, on October 31, 1912 they got from Gaud the final certificate to rent the other floors of the building.</paragraph><list type='def'><listitem><defkey>Catholic symbols</defkey></listitem></list><paragraph><link><target>File:Proyecto Virgen Mil.jpg</target><part>thumbnail</part><part>right</part><part>180px</part><part>Part of the design plan drawings in 1906, showing the sculpture's mean to be mounted on the upper facade</part></link>Gaud, a Catholic and a devotee of the<space/><link><target>Virgin Mary</target></link>, planned for the Casa Mil to be a spiritual symbol.<extension extension_name='ref' name="google224"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="author"><space/>Stephen Sennott</arg><arg name="title"><space/>Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture: A-F</arg><arg name="url"><space/>http://books.google.com/?id</arg><arg name="year"><space/>2004</arg><arg name="publisher"><space/>Fitzroy Dearborn</arg><arg name="isbn"><space/>978-1-57958-433-7</arg><arg name="page"><space/>224<space/></arg></template></extension><space/>Overt religious elements include an excerpt from the<space/><link><target>Rosary</target></link><space/>prayer on the cornice and planned statues of Mary, specifically<space/><link><target>Our Lady of the Rosary</target></link>, and two<space/><link><target>archangels</target></link>,<space/><link><target>St. Michael</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>St. Gabriel</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="google224"></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="gaudiclub1906"><link type='external' href='http://www.gaudiclub.com/ingles/i_vida/pedrera.html'>La Pedrera (Casa Mil, 1906-1910)</link><space/>Gaudiclub.com</extension></paragraph><paragraph>The design by Gaud was not followed in some aspects.

In 1953 they commissioned Juan Francisco Barba Corsini the construction of 13 apartments in the attic, which until then had been the laundry, increasingly used and had become an unsafe place, filled with garbage. Barba Corsini respect Gaud's original volume and structure, the Logis-freedom approach that gave the open space and no right angles. The apartments were located on the outer side of the space, leaving a corridor of the distribution curve of the arches that give central courtyard, leaving the darker area between the two courtyards as dealer floor. Apartments were 2 or 3 pieces, some with a loft living, with a design and furniture typical of the early 1950s, with materials such as brick, ceramic, wood and furniture design similar to that of<space/><link><target>Eero Saarinen</target></link><space/><extension extension_name='ref' name="corsini"></extension><space/>as<italics><space/>Chair Quarry</italics>, among others.

The basement was intended to be the garage, the main floor the residence of the Mils (a flat of all 1,323 m<xhtml:sup>2</xhtml:sup>), and the rest distributed over 20 homes for rent. The resulting layout is shaped like an asymmetrical &quot;8&quot; because of the different shape and size of the courtyards. The attic housed the laundry and drying areas, forming an insulating space for the building and simultaneously determining the levels of the roof.</paragraph><paragraph>One of the most significant parts of the building is the roof, crowned with skylights, staircase exits, fans, and chimneys. All of these elements, constructed with timbrel coated with limestone, broken marble or glass, have a specific architectural function. Nevertheless, they have become real sculptures integrated into the building.</paragraph><paragraph>The building is a unique entity, where the shape of the exterior continues to the interior. The apartments feature ceilings with plaster reliefs of great dynamism, handcrafted wooden doors, windows, and furniture, and the design of the hydraulic pavement and different ornamental elements.</paragraph><paragraph>The stairways were intended for services, in that access to housing was by elevator except for the noble floor, where Gaud added a staircase of a particular configuration.</paragraph><paragraph>Gaud wanted the people who lived in the flats to all know each other. Therefore, there were only lifts on every second floor so people had to communicate with one another on different floors.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Structure</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:CasaMila-Balcons.jpg</target><part>thumbnail</part><part>right</part><part>150px</part><part>CasaMila-Balcony, showing the self-supporting stone facade, also supported by curved iron beams</part></link>Regarding the structure, Casa Mil is characterized by its self-supporting stone facade, meaning that it is free of the functions of a load-bearing wall, which connects to the internal structure of each floor by means of curved iron beams surrounding the perimeter of each floor. This construction system allows, on one hand, large openings in the facade which give light to the homes, and on the other, free structuring of the different levels, so that all walls can be demolished without affecting the stability of the building. This allows the owners to change their minds at will and to modify, without problems, the interior layout of the homes.<space/><extension extension_name='ref' name="any2002a"></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Constructive and decorative items</heading><heading level='4'>Facade</heading><paragraph>The facade is composed of large blocks of<space/><link><target>limestone</target></link><space/>from the<space/><link><target>Garraf Massif</target></link><space/>to the first floor of the quarry<space/><link><target>Villefranche-de-Conflent</target><part>Villefranche</part></link><space/>to the higher levels.

In 1928, the tailor Mosella opened the first store in La Pedrera, he works and eliminate the bars. This did not concern anyone, because in the middle of twentieth century, twisted ironwork had little importance.

The roof resembles both the ribs of a huge animal and a palm, giving the roof-deck a very unconventional shape similar to a landscape of hills and valleys. The shape and location of the courtyards make bows higher when the space is narrowed and lower when the space expands.</paragraph><paragraph>The builder Bay explained its construction: &quot;First the face of a wide wall was filled with mortar and plastered. After<space/><link><target>Josep Canaleta i Cuadras</target><part>Canaleta</part></link><space/>indicated the opening of each arc and Bay nailed a nail at each starting point of the arc at the top of the wall. From these nails was dangled a chain so that the lowest point coincided with the deflection of the bow. Then the profile displayed on the wall by the chain was drawn and on this profile the carpenter marked the corresponding centering, which was placed and the timbrel vault was started with three rows of plane bricks.
