He called his approach towards Judaism &quot;Positive-Historical,&quot; which meant that one should have a positive attitude towards accepting Jewish law and tradition as<space/><link><target>norm (sociology)</target><part>normative</part></link>, yet one should be open to developing the law in the same fashion that it has always historically developed. On the one hand, Frankel rejected the innovations of<space/><link><target>Reform Judaism</target></link><space/>as insufficiently based in Jewish history and communal practice.

When considering changes to halakha, Conservative Judaism's rabbinical authorities may rely on historical analysis as well as religious considerations. As Solomon Schechter noted, &quot;however great the literary value of a code may be, it does not invest it with infallibility, nor does it exempt it from the student or the Rabbi who makes use of it from the duty of examining each paragraph on its own merits, and subjecting it to the same rules of interpretation that were always applied to Tradition&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref'>Solomon Schechter,<space/><italics>Studies in Judaism</italics>, First Series, 1896, Jewish Publication Society of America.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Concerning interpretation of<space/><link><target>Halakha</target></link><space/>(or Jewish law): because of Judaism's legal tradition, the fundamental differences between modern Jewish denominations also involve the relevance, interpretation, and application of<space/><link><target>Halakha</target><part>Jewish law and tradition</part></link>.

Culture. Jewish Usenet Newsgroup FAQ) The Conservative movement makes a conscious effort to use historical sources to determine what kind of changes to Jewish tradition have occurred, how and why they occurred, and in what historical context. With this information they believe that they can better understand the proper way for rabbis to interpret and apply Jewish law to our conditions today.

Orthodoxy has clung fast to the principle of authority, but has in our own and recent generations rejected the right to any but minor interpretations. The Conservative view is that both are necessary for a living Judaism.

However, the Leadership Council of Conservative Judaism has a different sociological approach to this issue than does Orthodoxy, although agreeing religiously. In a press release it has stated:</paragraph><list type='ident'><listitem>&quot;In the past, intermarriage...was viewed as an act of rebellion, a rejection of Judaism.

We should continue to give our love and by that retain a measure of influence in their lives, Jewishly and otherwise. Life consists of constant growth and our adult children may yet reach a stage when Judaism has new meaning for them. However, the marriage between a Jew and non-Jew is not a celebration for the Jewish community. We therefore reach out to the couple with the hope that the non-Jewish partner will move closer to Judaism and ultimately choose to convert. Since we know that over 70 percent of children of intermarried couples are not being raised as Jews...we want to encourage the Jewish partner to maintain his/her Jewish identity, and raise their children as Jews.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.mishkantefila.com/Intermarriage.html'>LEADERSHIP COUNCIL OF CONSERVATIVE JUDAISM, Statement on Intermarriage, Adopted March 7, 1995</link></extension></listitem></list><heading level='3'>Gender equality</heading><paragraph>In the 1970s and early 1980s, Conservative Judaism was divided over issues of<space/><link><target>gender equality</target></link>.
