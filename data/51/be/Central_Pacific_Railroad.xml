Until the completion of the<space/><link><target>First Transcontinental Railroad</target><part>Transcontinental rail link</part></link><space/>and the railroad's opening of its own shops, all locomotives had to be purchased by builders in the northeastern U.S. The engines had to be dismantled, loaded on a ship, which would embark on a four-month journey that went around<space/><link><target>Cape Horn</target><part>South America's Cape Horn</part></link><space/>until arriving in Sacramento where the locomotives would be unloaded, re-assembled, and placed in service.</paragraph><paragraph>Locomotives at the time came from many manufacturers, such as<space/><link><target>Cooke Locomotive and Machine Works</target><part>Cooke</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Schenectady Locomotive Works</target><part>Schenectady</part></link>, Mason, Rogers, Danforth, Norris, Booth, and McKay &amp; Aldus, among others. Interestingly, the railroad had been on rather unfriendly terms with the<space/><link><target>Baldwin Locomotive Works</target></link>, one of the more well-known firms. It is not clear as to the cause of this dispute, though some attribute it to the builder insisting on cash payment (though this has yet to be verified). Consequently, the railroad refused to buy engines from Baldwin, and three former<space/><link><target>Western Pacific Railroad (18621870)</target><part>Western Pacific Railroad</part></link><space/>(which the CP had absorbed in 1870) engines were the only Baldwin engines owned by the Central Pacific.

Results suggest that even without land grants, rates of return were high enough to induce investment. Also, land grants did not pay for the construction of the railroad. Land grants, however, did produce large social returns in western states by accelerating construction of the system.</listitem><listitem><template><target>cite journal</target><arg name="title">Land Grants to American Railroads: Social Cost or Social Benefit?</arg><arg name="first"><space/>Lloyd J.</arg><arg name="last"><space/>Mercer</arg><arg name="journal"><space/>Business History Review</arg><arg name="volume"><space/>43</arg><arg name="issue"><space/>2</arg><arg name="year"><space/>1969</arg><arg name="pages"><space/>134–151</arg><arg name="doi">10.2307/3112269</arg></template><space/>Uses econometrics to determine the value of railroad land grants of the 19th century to the railroads and to society. The author summarizes and criticizes previous treatments of this subject, and discusses his own findings. Using the Central Pacific and the Union Pacific systems as the basis for his investigation, the author concludes that the railroad owners received unaided rates of return that substantially exceeded the private rate of return on the average alternative project in the economy during the same period. Thus, the projects were profitable, although contemporary observers expected that the roads would be privately unprofitable without the land grant aid. The land grants did not have a major effect, increasing the private rate of return only slightly. Nevertheless, he says the policy of subsidizing those railroad systems was beneficial for society since the social rate of return from the project was substantial and exceeded the private rate by a significant margin.</listitem><listitem><template><target>cite journal</target><arg name="title">The Central Pacific Railroad and Exploitation of Chinese Labor</arg><arg name="first"><space/>Paul M.</arg><arg name="last"><space/>Ong</arg><arg name="journal"><space/>Journal of Ethnic Studies</arg><arg name="volume"><space/>13</arg><arg name="issue"><space/>2</arg><arg name="year"><space/>1985</arg><arg name="pages"><space/>119–124</arg></template><space/>Ong tries to resolve the apparent inconsistency in the literature on Asians in early California, with contradictory studies showing evidence both for and against the exploitation of Chinese labor by the CPRR, using<space/><link><target>monopsony</target></link><space/>theory as developed by Joan Robinson. Because CPRR set different wages for whites and Chinese (each group had different elasticities of supply) and used the two classes in different types of positions, the two groups were complementary, rather than interchangeable. Calculations thus show higher levels of exploitation of the Chinese than found in previous studies.</listitem><listitem><template><target>cite journal</target><arg name="title">The Army of Canton in the High Sierra</arg><arg name="first"><space/>Alexander</arg><arg name="last"><space/>Saxton</arg><arg name="journal"><space/>Pacific Historical Review</arg><arg name="volume"><space/>35</arg><arg name="issue"><space/>2</arg><arg name="year"><space/>1966</arg><arg name="pages"><space/>141–151</arg><arg name="doi">10.2307/3636678</arg></template></listitem><listitem><template><target>cite journal</target><arg name="title">Stanford's Responses to Competition: Rhetoric Versus Reality</arg><arg name="first"><space/>Norman E.</arg><arg name="last"><space/>Tutorow</arg><arg name="journal"><space/>Southern California Quarterly</arg><arg name="volume"><space/>52</arg><arg name="issue"><space/>3</arg><arg name="year"><space/>1970</arg><arg name="pages"><space/>231–247</arg><arg name="doi">10.2307/41170298</arg></template><space/>Leland Stanford and the men who ran the CPRR paid lip-service to the idea of free competition, but in practice sought to dominate competing railroad and shipping lines. Analyzing the period 1869-1893, the author shows how Stanford and his associates repeatedly entered into pooling arrangements to prevent competition, bought out competitors, or forced rivals to agree not to compete. He concludes that Stanford and his partners viewed<space/><italics>laissez-faire</italics><space/>as applicable only to government controls, and not to businessmen's destruction of competition within the system.</listitem><listitem><template><target>cite journal</target><arg name="title">Information, Markets, and Corruption: Transcontinental Railroads in the Gilded Age</arg><arg name="first"><space/>Richard</arg><arg name="last"><space/>White</arg><arg name="journal"><space/>The Journal of American History</arg><arg name="volume"><space/>90</arg><arg name="issue"><space/>1</arg><arg name="year"><space/>2003</arg></template></listitem><listitem><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="title"><space/>A Great and Shining Road: The Epic Story of the Transcontinental Railroad</arg><arg name="first"><space/>John Hoyt</arg><arg name="last"><space/>Williams</arg><arg name="location"><space/>New York</arg><arg name="publisher"><space/>Times Books</arg><arg name="year"><space/>1988</arg><arg name="isbn">0-8129-1668-9<space/></arg></template></listitem><listitem><template><target>Cite episode</target><arg name="title"><space/>The Iron Road</arg><arg name="series"><space/>The American Experience</arg><arg name="credits"><space/>Neil Goodwin, Peace River Films</arg><arg name="network"><space/>PBS</arg><arg name="airdate"><space/>1990</arg></template></listitem><listitem><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="title"><space/>Iron Horses to Promontory</arg><arg name="first"><space/>Gerald M</arg><arg name="last"><space/>Best</arg><arg name="location"><space/>New York</arg><arg name="publisher"><space/>Golden West</arg><arg name="year"><space/>1969</arg><arg name="isbn"><space/></arg></template></listitem></list><heading level='2'>External links</heading><paragraph><template><target>commons category</target></template></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><link type='external' href='http://CPRR.org'>Central Pacific Railroad Photographic History Museum</link></listitem><listitem><link type='external' href='http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt6c602823'>Railroads in California</link>, handwritten report by L.
