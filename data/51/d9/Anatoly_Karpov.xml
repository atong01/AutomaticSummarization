He convincingly won the very strong<space/><link><target>Milan</target></link><space/>tournament in 1975, and captured his first of three Soviet titles in 1976. He created a phenomenal streak of tournament wins against the strongest players in the world. Karpov held the record for most consecutive tournament victories (nine) until it was shattered by<space/><link><target>Garry Kasparov</target></link><space/>(14).In 1978, Karpov's first title defence was against Korchnoi, the opponent he had defeated in the 197375 Candidates' cycle; the match was played at<space/><link><target>Baguio</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Philippines</target></link>, with the winner needing six victories.As in 1974, Karpov took an early lead, winning the eighth game after seven draws to open the match, but Korchnoi staged a comeback late in the match, as, after the score was +5 2 =20 in Karpov's favour, he won three of the next four games to draw level with Karpov.

The next seventeen games were drawn, setting the record for world title matches, and it took Karpov until game 27 to gain his fifth win. In game 31, Karpov had a winning position but failed to take advantage and settled for a draw. He lost the next game, after which fourteen more draws ensued. In particular, Karpov held a solidly winning position in Game 41, but again blundered and had to settle for a draw. After Kasparov won games 47 and 48, FIDE President<space/><link><target>Florencio Campomanes</target></link><space/>unilaterally terminated the match, citing the health of the players.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.mark-weeks.com/chess/84kk$$.htm'>1984 KarpovKasparov Title Match Highlights</link><space/>Mark Weeks' Chess Pages</extension><space/>The match had lasted an unprecedented five months, with five wins for Karpov, three for Kasparov, and forty draws.</paragraph><paragraph>A rematch was set for later in 1985, also in Moscow. The events of the so-called Marathon Match forced FIDE to return to the previous format, a match limited to 24 games (with Karpov remaining champion if the match should finish 1212). Karpov needed to win the final game to draw the match and retain his title, but wound up losing, thus surrendering the title to his opponent. The final score was 13-11 (+3 5 =16), in favour of Kasparov.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Rivalry with Kasparov</heading><paragraph>Karpov remained a formidable opponent (and the world #2) until the early 1990s.

All three matches were extremely close: the scores were 11 to 12 (+4 5 =15), 12 to 12 (+4 4 =16), and 11 to 12 (+3 4 =17). In all three matches, Karpov had winning chances up to the very last games. In particular, the 1987 Seville match featured an astonishing blunder by Kasparov in the 23rd game. In the final game, needing only a draw to win the title, Karpov cracked under pressure from the clock at the end of the first session of play, missed a variation leading to an almost forced draw, and allowed Kasparov to adjourn the game with an extra pawn. After a further mistake in the second session, Karpov was slowly ground down and resigned on move 64, ending the match and allowing Kasparov to keep the title.</paragraph><paragraph>In their five world championship matches, Karpov scored 19 wins, 21 losses, and 104 draws in 144 games.</paragraph><paragraph>Karpov is on record saying that if he had the opportunity to play Fischer for the crown in his twenties, he could have been a much better player as a result.</paragraph><heading level='3'>FIDE champion again (199399)</heading><paragraph><link><target>Image:Anatoly Karpov.jpg</target><part>220px</part><part>right</part><part>thumb</part><part>Karpov in 1996</part></link>In 1992, Karpov lost a Candidates Match against<space/><link><target>Nigel Short</target></link>.
