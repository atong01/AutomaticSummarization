It was created with equal representation from each of Ontario, Quebec, the Maritime region and the Western Provinces. However, it is currently the product of various specific exceptions, additions and compromises, meaning that regional equality is not observed, nor is representation-by-population. The normal number of senators can be exceeded by the monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister, as long as the additional senators are distributed equally with regard to region (up to a total of eight additional Senators). This power of additional appointment has only been used once, when Prime Minister<space/><link><target>Brian Mulroney</target></link><space/>petitioned<space/><link><target>Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom</target><part>Queen Elizabeth II</part></link><space/>to add eight seats to the Senate so as to ensure the passage of the<space/><link><target>Goods and Services Tax (Canada)</target><part>Goods and Services Tax</part></link><space/>legislation.</paragraph><paragraph>The House of Commons currently has 338 members elected in<space/><link><target>single-member district</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>in a<space/><link><target>plurality voting system</target></link><space/>(first past the post), meaning that members must attain only a<space/><link><target>Plurality (voting)</target><part>plurality</part></link><space/>(the most votes of any candidate) rather than a<space/><link><target>majority</target></link><space/>(50 percent plus one).

Normally the party leader stands as a candidate to be an MP during an election.</paragraph><paragraph>The election of a local MP gives a seat to one of the several political parties. The party that gets the most seats normally forms the government, with that party's leader becoming prime minister. The Prime Minister is not directly elected by the general population, although the Prime Minister is almost always directly elected as an MP within his or her constituency.</paragraph><paragraph>Canada's parliamentary system empowers political parties and their party leaders. Where one party gets a majority of the seats in the House of Commons, that party is said to have a &quot;majority government.&quot; Through party discipline, the party leader, who is only elected in one riding, exercises a great deal of control over the cabinet and the parliament.</paragraph><paragraph>A<space/><link><target>minority government</target></link><space/>situation occurs when the party that holds the most seats in the House of Commons holds less seats than the opposition parties combined. In this scenario the party leader whose party has the most seats in the House is selected by the Governor General to lead the government, however, to create stability, the leader chosen must have the support of the majority of the House, meaning they need the support of at least one other party.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Federal-provincial relations</heading><paragraph>In Canada,<space/><link><target>Provinces and territories of Canada</target><part>the provinces</part></link><space/>are considered co-sovereign;<space/><link><target>sovereignty</target></link><space/>of the provinces is passed on, not by the Governor General or the<space/><link><target>Parliament of Canada</target><part>Canadian parliament</part></link>, but through the Crown itself. This means that the Crown is &quot;divided&quot; into 11 legal jurisdictions; into 11 &quot;Crowns&quot; one federal and ten provincial.</paragraph><paragraph>Federal-provincial (or intergovernmental, formerly Dominion-provincial) relations is a regular issue in Canadian politics: Quebec wishes to preserve and strengthen its distinctive nature, western provinces desire more control over their abundant natural resources, especially energy reserves; industrialized Central Canada is concerned with its manufacturing base, and the Atlantic provinces strive to escape from being less affluent than the rest of the country.</paragraph><paragraph>In order to ensure that social programs such as health care and education are funded consistently throughout Canada, the &quot;have-not&quot; (poorer) provinces receive a proportionately greater share of federal &quot;<link><target>equalization payments</target><part>transfer (equalization) payments</part></link>&quot; than the richer, or &quot;have&quot;, provinces do; this has been somewhat controversial. The richer provinces often favour freezing transfer payments, or rebalancing the system in their favour, based on the claim that they already pay more in taxes than they receive in federal government services, and the poorer provinces often favour an increase on the basis that the amount of money they receive is not sufficient for their existing needs.</paragraph><paragraph>Particularly in the past decade, some scholars have argued that the federal government's exercise of its unlimited constitutional spending power has contributed to strained federal-provincial relations. This power, which allows the federal government to spend the revenue it raises in any way that it pleases, allows it to overstep the constitutional division of powers by creating programs that encroach on areas of provincial jurisdiction. The federal spending power is not expressly set out in the<space/><link><target>Constitution Act, 1867</target></link>; however, in the words of the<space/><link><target>Court of Appeal for Ontario</target></link><space/>the power &quot;can be inferred&quot; from s. 91(1A), &quot;the public debt and property&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2004/2004canlii15104/2004canlii15104.html'>''Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. v.

Regulation of health services is, under the Constitution, a provincial responsibility. However, by making the funding available to the provinces under the Canada Health Act contingent upon delivery of services according to federal standards, the federal government has the ability to influence health care delivery. This spending power, coupled with Supreme Court rulings such as<space/><link><target>Reference re Canada Assistance Plan (B.C.)</target></link><space/>that have held that funding delivered under the spending power can be reduced unilaterally at any time, has contributed to strained federal-provincial relations.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Quebec and Canadian politics</heading><paragraph>Except for three short-lived transitional or minority governments, prime ministers from<space/><link><target>Quebec</target></link><space/>led Canada continuously from 1968 to early 2006.

With the collapse of the PCs in that election, the Bloc and Liberals were seen as the only two viable parties in Quebec. Thus, prior to the 2006 election, any gain by one party came at the expense of the other, regardless of whether national unity was really at issue. The Bloc, then, benefited (with a significant increase in seat total) from the impressions of corruption that surrounded the Liberal Party in the leadup to the 2004 election. However, the newly unified Conservative party re-emerged as a viable party in Quebec by winning 10 seats in the 2006 election.

Residents of the four western provinces, particularly Alberta, have often been unhappy with a lack of influence and a perceived lack of understanding when residents of Central Canada consider &quot;national&quot; issues. While this is seen to play itself out through many avenues (media, commerce, and so on.), in politics, it has given rise to a number of political parties whose base constituency is in western Canada.

However, regardless of specific electoral successes or failures, the concept of western alienation continues to be important in Canadian politics, particularly on a provincial level, where opposing the federal government is a common tactic for provincial politicians.

This system was considered ground-breaking at the time since prior systems were slanted on the basis of ethnicity. However, many foreign nationals still found it challenging to secure work after immigrating, resulting in a higher unemployment rate among immigrants. After winning power in 2006, the conservative party has sought to curb this issue by placing weight on whether or not the applicant has a standing job offer in Canada. The change has been a source of some contention as opponents argue that businesses use this change to suppress wages, with corporate owners leveraging the knowledge that an immigrant should hold a job to successfully complete the immigration process.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.economist.com/news/americas/21638191-canada-used-prize-immigrants-who-would-make-good-citizens-now-people-job-offers-have'></link></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><paragraph><template><target>Portal</target><arg>Canadian politics</arg></template><template><target>colbegin</target><arg></arg><arg>25em</arg></template></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>AustraliaCanada relations</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Canadian nationalism</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Conservatism in Canada</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Council of the Federation</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Federal political financing in Canada</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Liberalism in Canada</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>List of Canadian federal general elections</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>List of Canadian federal electoral districts</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>List of Canadian political scandals</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>List of political parties in Canada</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Political culture of Canada</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Progressivism</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Socialism and social democracy in Canada</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Ten Percenter</target></link></listitem></list><paragraph><template><target>colend</target></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>reflist</target></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>Further reading</heading><paragraph><template><target>refbegin</target></template></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>Argyle, Ray.<space/><italics>Turning Points: The Campaigns That Changed Canada - 2011 and Before</italics><space/>(2011) 440pp<space/><link type='external' href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/B005233WJG/'>excerpt and text search</link><space/>ch 1</listitem><listitem><template><target>citation</target><arg name="last">Bickerton<space/></arg><arg name="first">James<space/></arg><arg name="year">2009<space/></arg><arg name="title">Canadian Politics<space/></arg><arg name="url"><space/>http://books.google.ca/books?id</arg><arg name="publisher">University of Toronto Press</arg><arg name="isbn">978-1-4426-0121-5<space/></arg></template></listitem><listitem><template><target>citation</target><arg name="last"><space/>Courtney<space/></arg><arg name="first"><space/>John C</arg><arg name="coauthor"><space/>David E.
