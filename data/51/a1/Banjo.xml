Clawhammer consists of downward striking of one or more of the four main strings with the index, middle or both finger(s)while the drone or fifth string is played with a 'lifting' (as opposed to downward pluck) motion of the thumb. The notes typically sounded by the thumb in this fashion are, usually, on the off beat. Melodies can be quite intricate adding techniques such as double thumbing and drop thumb. In old time Appalachian Mountain music, there is also a style called two finger up-pick, and a three finger version that<space/><link><target>Earl Scruggs</target></link><space/>developed into the famous &quot;Scruggs&quot; style picking, nationally aired in 1945 on the Grand Ole Opry.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">June 2013</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>While five-string banjos are traditionally played with either fingerpicks or the fingers themselves,<space/><link><target>tenor banjo</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>plectrum banjo</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>are played with a pick, either to strum full chords or, most commonly in<space/><link><target>Irish Traditional Music</target></link>, play single note melodies.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Modern banjo</heading><paragraph>The modern banjo comes in a variety of forms, including four- and five-string versions. A six-string version, tuned and played similarly to a<space/><link><target>guitar</target></link>, has gained popularity. In almost all of its forms, banjo playing is characterized by a fast<space/><link><target>arpeggiated</target></link><space/>plucking, though there are many different playing styles.</paragraph><paragraph>The body, or<space/><italics>pot</italics>, of a modern banjo typically consists of a circular rim (generally made of wood, though metal was also common on older banjos) and a tensioned head, similar to a drum head. Traditionally the head was made from animal skin, but today is often made of various synthetic materials. Most modern banjos also have a metal &quot;tone ring&quot; assembly that helps further clarify and project the sound, however many older banjos do not include a tone ring.</paragraph><paragraph>The banjo is usually tuned with friction<space/><link><target>tuning peg</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>planetary gear</target></link><space/>tuners, rather than the<space/><link><target>worm gear</target></link><space/><link><target>machine head</target></link><space/>used on guitars. Frets have become standard since the late 19th century, though fretless banjos are still manufactured and played by those wishing to execute<space/><link><target>glissando</target></link>, play quarter tones, or otherwise achieve the sound and feeling of early playing styles.</paragraph><paragraph>Modern banjos are typically strung with metal strings. Usually the fourth string is<space/><link><target>Strings (music)#Winding</target><part>wound</part></link><space/>with either steel or bronze-phosphor alloy. Some players may string their banjos with nylon or gut strings to achieve a more mellow, old-time tone.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Open-back and resonator</heading><paragraph>Some banjos have a separate resonator plate on the back of the pot to project the sound forward and give the instrument more volume.

The fifth string is usually the same gauge as the first, but starts from the fifth fret, three quarters the length of the other strings. (The long-necked Vega<space/><link><target>Pete Seeger</target></link><space/>model starts the fifth string from the eighth fret.) This lets the string be tuned to a higher open pitch than possible for the full-length strings. Because of the short fifth string, the five-string banjo uses a<space/><link><target>reentrant tuning</target></link>the string pitches don't proceed lowest to highest across the fingerboard. Instead, from low to high pitch, they are usually fourth highest, third, second, first, and fifth highest.</paragraph><paragraph>The short fifth string presents special problems for a<space/><link><target>capo</target></link>. For small changes (going up or down one or two semitones, for example) it is possible simply to re-tune the fifth string. Otherwise, various devices called<space/><italics>fifth string capos</italics><space/>effectively shorten the vibrating part of the string. Many banjo players use model railroad spikes or titanium spikes (usually installed at the seventh fret and sometimes at others), that they hook the string under to press it down on the<space/><link><target>fret</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Five-string banjo players use many tunings. Probably the most common, particularly in bluegrass, is the Open-G tuning G4 D3 G3 B3 D4. In earlier times, the tuning G4 C3 G3 B3 D4 was commonly used instead, and this is still the preferred tuning for some types of folk music and for<space/><link><target>classic banjo</target></link>. Other tunings found in old-time music include double C (G4 C3 G3 C4 D4), &quot;sawmill&quot; (G4 D3 G3 C4 D4) also called &quot;mountain modal&quot; and open D (F#4D3 F#3 A3 D4). These tunings are often taken up a tone, either by tuning up or using a<space/><link><target>capo</target></link>. For example, &quot;old-time D&quot; tuning (A4 D3 A3 D4 E4) commonly reached by tuning up from double C is often played to accompany fiddle tunes in the key of D and Open-A (A4 E3 A3 C#4 E4) is usually used for playing tunes in the key of A. There are dozens of other banjo tunings, used mostly in old-time music. These tunings are used to make it easier to play specific, usually, fiddle tunes, or groups of fiddle tunes.</paragraph><paragraph>The size of the five string banjo is largely standardizedbut smaller and larger sizes exist, including the long-neck or<space/><italics>Seeger neck</italics><space/>variation designed by<space/><link><target>Pete Seeger</target></link>. Petite variations on the five-string banjo have been available since the 1890s. S.S. Stewart introduced the<space/><link><target>banjeaurine</target></link>, tuned one fourth above a standard five-string. Piccolo banjos are smaller, and tuned one octave above a standard banjo. Between these sizes and standard lies the A-scale banjo, which is two frets shorter and usually tuned one full step above standard tunings. Many makers have produced banjos of other scale lengths, and with various innovations.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Don Wayne Reno playing the banjo with fingerpicks.jpg</target><part>left</part><part>thumb</part><part>250px</part><part>A five-string banjo.</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>American<space/><link><target>old-time music</target></link><space/>typically uses the five-string open back banjo.

With development of the archtop and electric guitar, the tenor banjo largely disappeared from jazz and popular music, though keeping its place in traditional &quot;Dixieland&quot; jazz.</paragraph><paragraph>Some 1920s Irish banjo players picked out the melodies of jigs, reels and hornpipes on tenor banjos, decorating the tunes with snappy triplet ornaments. The most important Irish banjo player of this era was Mike Flanagan of the New York-based Flanagan Brothers, one of the most popular Irish-American groups of the day. Other pre-WW2 Irish banjo players included Neil Nolan, who recorded with Dan Sullivan's Shamrock Band in Boston, and Jimmy McDade, who recorded with the Four Provinces Orchestra in Philadelphia. Meanwhile, in Ireland the rise of &quot;ceili&quot; bands provided a new market for a loud instrument like the tenor banjo. Use of the tenor banjo in Irish music has increased greatly since the folk revival of the 1960s.<extension extension_name='ref' name="meade"></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>The low banjos</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Item-ceb-4-1296 lg.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>100px</part><part>Cello banjo from Gold Tone</part><trail>In</trail></link><space/>the late 19th and early 20th centuries there was a vogue in plucked-string instrument ensemblesguitar orchestras, mandolin orchestras, banjo orchestrasin which the instrumentation was made to parallel that of the string section in symphony orchestras.

He opened a shop in London in 1846, and sold banjos with closed backs and up to seven strings. He marketed these as &quot;zither&quot; Banjos from his 1869 patent. American Alfred Davis Cammeyer (18621949), a young violinist-turned banjo concert player, devised the five or six-string zither banjo around 1880. It had a wood resonator and metal &quot;wire&quot; strings (the 1st and 2nd melody strings and 5th &quot;thumb&quot; string. The 3rd melody string was gut and the 4th was silk covered) as well as frets and guitar-style tuning machines.</paragraph><paragraph>A zither banjo usually has a closed back and sides with the drum body (usually metal) and skin tensioning system suspended inside the wooden rim/back, the neck and string tailpiece was mounted on the wooden outer rim, the short string usually led through a tube in the neck so that the tuning peg could be mounted on the peg head. They were often made by builders who used guitar tuners that came in banks of three and so if 5 stringed had a redundant tuner. The banjos could also be somewhat easily converted over to a six-string banjo. British<space/><link><target>opera</target></link><space/>diva<space/><link><target>Adelina Patti</target></link><space/>advised Cammeyer that the zither-banjo might be popular with English audiences (it was invented there), and Cammeyer went to London in 1888. With his virtuoso playing, he helped show that banjos could make sophisticated music than normally played by<space/><link><target>blackface</target></link><space/>minstrels. He was soon performing for London society, where he met Sir<space/><link><target>Arthur Sullivan</target></link>, who recommended that Cammeyer progress from arranging the music of others for banjo to composing his own music. (Supposedly unknown to Cammeyer, William Temlett had patented a seven-string closed back banjo in 1869, and was already marketing it as a &quot;zither-banjo.&quot;)<template><target>rn</target><arg name="date">July 2015</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>In the late 1890s Banjo maker F.C Wilkes developed a six-string version of the banjo, with the 6th string &quot;tunnelled&quot; through the neck. It is arguable that Arthur O. Windsor influenced development and perfection of the zither banjo and created the open-back banjo<extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.zither-banjo.org/pages/windsornew.htm</extension><space/>along with other modifications to the banjo type instruments, such as the modern non-solid attached resonator. (Gibson claims credit for this modification on the American Continent.) Windsor claimed he created the hollow neck banjo with a truss rod, and buried the 5th string in the neck after the 5th fret so to put the tuning peg on the peg-head rather than in the neck. Gibson claims credit for perfecting the tone ring.</paragraph><paragraph>Modern six-string bluegrass banjos have been made. These add a bass string between the lowest string and the drone string on a five-string banjo, and are usually tuned G4 G2 D3 G3 B3 D4.<space/><link><target>Sonny Osborne</target></link><space/>played one of these instruments for several years.
