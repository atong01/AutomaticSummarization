Chaplin became a worldwide icon through his screen persona &quot;<link><target>the Tramp</target></link>&quot; and is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the<space/><link><target>film industry</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="acclaim">Cousins, p. 72; Kemp, pp. 8, 22; Gunning, p. 41, Sarris, p. 139, Hansmeyer, p. 3.</extension><space/>His career spanned more than 75 years, from childhood in the<space/><link><target>Victorian era</target></link><space/>until a year before his death in 1977, and encompassed both adulation and controversy.</paragraph><paragraph>Chaplin's childhood in London was defined by poverty and hardship. As his father was absent and his mother struggled financially, he was sent to a<space/><link><target>workhouse</target></link><space/>twice before the age of nine. When he was 14, his mother was committed to a mental asylum. Chaplin began performing at an early age, touring<space/><link><target>music hall</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and later working as a stage actor and comedian. At 19 he was signed to the prestigious<space/><link><target>Fred Karno</target></link><space/>company, which took him to America. Chaplin was scouted for the film industry, and began appearing in 1914 for<space/><link><target>Keystone Studios</target></link>. He soon developed the Tramp persona and formed a large fan base. Chaplin directed his own films from an early stage, and continued to hone his craft as he moved to the<space/><link><target>Essanay</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Mutual Film</target><part>Mutual</part></link>, and<space/><link><target>First National</target></link><space/>corporations. By 1918, he was one of the best known figures in the world.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1919, Chaplin co-founded the distribution company<space/><link><target>United Artists</target></link>, which gave him complete control over his films. His first<space/><link><target>feature-length</target></link><space/>was<space/><italics><link><target>The Kid (1921 film)</target><part>The Kid</part></link></italics><space/>(1921), followed by<space/><italics><link><target>A Woman of Paris</target></link></italics><space/>(1923),<space/><italics><link><target>The Gold Rush</target></link></italics><space/>(1925), and<space/><italics><link><target>The Circus (film)</target><part>The Circus</part></link></italics><space/>(1928). He refused to move to<space/><link><target>sound film</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>in the 1930s, instead producing<space/><italics><link><target>City Lights</target></link></italics><space/>(1931) and<space/><italics><link><target>Modern Times (film)</target><part>Modern Times</part></link></italics><space/>(1936) without dialogue. Chaplin became increasingly political, and his next film,<space/><italics><link><target>The Great Dictator</target></link></italics><space/>(1940), satirised<space/><link><target>Adolf Hitler</target></link>. The 1940s were a decade marked with controversy for Chaplin, and his popularity declined rapidly. He was accused of<space/><link><target>communist</target></link><space/>sympathies, while his involvement in a<space/><link><target>paternity suit</target></link><space/>and marriages to much younger women caused scandal. An<space/><link><target>FBI</target></link><space/>investigation was opened, and Chaplin was forced to leave the United States and settle in Switzerland. He abandoned the Tramp in his later films, which include<space/><italics><link><target>Monsieur Verdoux</target></link></italics><space/>(1947),<space/><italics><link><target>Limelight (1952 film)</target><part>Limelight</part></link></italics><space/>(1952),<space/><italics><link><target>A King in New York</target></link></italics><space/>(1957), and<space/><italics><link><target>A Countess from Hong Kong</target></link></italics><space/>(1967).</paragraph><paragraph>Chaplin wrote, directed, produced, edited, starred in, and composed the music for most of his films. He was a perfectionist, and his financial independence enabled him to spend years on the development and production of a picture. His films are characterised by<space/><link><target>slapstick</target></link><space/>combined with<space/><link><target>pathos</target></link>, typified in the Tramp's struggles against adversity. Many contain social and political themes, as well as autobiographical elements. In 1972, as part of a renewed appreciation for his work, Chaplin received an<space/><link><target>Academy Honorary Award</target><part>Honorary Academy Award</part></link><space/>for &quot;the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century&quot;.
