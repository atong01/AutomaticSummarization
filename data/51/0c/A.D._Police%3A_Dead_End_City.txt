==Plot==
The manga is set in 2032.<ref name="manganews"/> The A.D. Police are an elite group of highly trained and specially equipped police officers, who have been formed to deal with [[terrorism|terrorist]] activities and Boomer crimes in the city of Mega Tokyo. They are more heavily armed and equipped (including power armors like the K-11 and K-12) than a normal police force, but more lightly than a military organization.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The A.D. Police are offered a great deal of leeway in their activities, often blockading large sections of the city and causing great amounts of property damage in the course of fulfilling their duty. Despite their dedication to their jobs, however, the citizens of Mega Tokyo tend to dislike and distrust members of the A.D. Police, seeing them as corrupt and ineffectual.
