'''Electricity generation''' is the process of generating [[electric power]] from other sources of [[primary energy]].
The fundamental principles of electricity generation were discovered during the 1820s and early 1830s by the British scientist [[Michael Faraday]]. His basic method is still used today: electricity is generated by the movement of a loop of wire, or [[Faraday disc|disc of copper]] between the [[Magnetic pole|poles]] of a [[magnet]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theiet.org/about/libarc/archives/biographies/faraday.cfm|title=Page not found|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref>
For [[electric utility|electric utilities]], it is the first process in the delivery of electricity to consumers. The other processes, electricity [[Electric power transmission|transmission]], [[Electric power distribution|distribution]], and electrical power storage and recovery using [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-storage]] methods are normally carried out by the [[electric power industry]].
Electricity is most often generated at a [[power station]] by electromechanical [[electrical generator|generators]], primarily driven by [[heat engine]]s fueled by chemical [[combustion]] or [[nuclear fission]] but also by other means such as the [[kinetic energy]] of flowing water and wind. Other energy sources include solar [[photovoltaics]] and [[geothermal power]] and electrochemical [[battery (electricity)|batteries]].

{{Main|Electrification}}
[[File:Electricity grid simple- North America.svg|upright=1.3|thumb|Diagram of an electric power system, generation system in red]]
Central power stations became economically practical with the development of [[alternating current]] power transmission, using power [[transformer]]s to transmit power at high voltage and with low loss.  Electricity has been generated at central stations since 1882. The first power plants were run on water power<ref>In 1881, under the leadership of Jacob Schoellkopf, the first [[hydroelectric]] generating station was built on [[Niagara Falls]].</ref> or coal,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Pearl_Street_Station|title=Pearl Street Station|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref> and today, rely mainly on [[coal]], [[nuclear power|nuclear]], [[natural gas]], [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]],  [[wind generator]]s, and [[petroleum]], with a small amount from [[solar energy]], [[tidal power]], and [[Geothermal power|geothermal]] sources.
The use of power-lines and power-poles have been significantly important in the distribution of electricity.

There are seven fundamental methods of directly transforming other forms of energy into electrical energy: 
*[[Static electricity]], from the physical separation and transport of charge (examples: [[triboelectric effect]] and [[lightning]])
*[[Electromagnetic induction]], where an [[electrical generator]], [[dynamo]] or [[alternator]] transforms [[kinetic energy]] (energy of motion) into electricity. This is the most used form for generating electricity and is based on [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]]. It can be experimented by simply rotating a magnet within closed loops of a conducting material (e.g. copper wire)
*[[Electrochemistry]], the direct transformation of [[chemical energy]] into electricity, as in a [[battery (electricity)|battery]], [[fuel cell]] or [[nerve impulse]]
*[[Photovoltaic effect]], the transformation of light into electrical energy, as in [[solar cell]]s
*[[Thermoelectric effect]], the direct conversion of temperature differences to electricity, as in [[thermocouple]]s, [[thermopile]]s, and [[thermionic converter]]s.
*[[Piezoelectric effect]], from the mechanical strain of electrically [[anisotropic]] molecules or crystals. Researchers at the US Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) have developed a [[piezoelectric]] generator sufficient to operate a [[liquid crystal display]] using thin films of M13 bacteriophage.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Electricity-generated-from-harmless-viruses/articleshow/13133756.cms|title= piezoelectric generator|accessdate=2012-05-20 | work=The Times Of India}}</ref>
*Nuclear transformation, the creation and acceleration of charged particles (examples: [[betavoltaics]] or [[alpha particle]] emission)
[[Static electricity]] was the first form discovered and investigated, and the [[electrostatic generator]] is still used even in modern devices such as the [[Van de Graaff generator]] and [[MHD generator]]s. Charge carriers are separated and physically transported to a position of increased electric potential.
Almost all commercial electrical generation is done using electromagnetic induction, in which [[mechanical energy]] forces an [[electrical generator]] to rotate.  There are many different methods of developing the mechanical energy, including [[heat engine]]s, hydro, wind and tidal power.
The direct conversion of [[nuclear potential energy]] to electricity by [[beta decay]] is used only on a small scale. In a full-size nuclear power plant, the heat of a nuclear reaction is used to run a heat engine. This drives a generator, which converts mechanical energy into electricity by magnetic induction.
Most electric generation is driven by [[heat engine]]s. The combustion of [[fossil fuel]]s
supplies most of the heat to these engines, with a significant fraction from [[nuclear fission]] and some from [[renewable source]]s. The modern [[steam turbine]] (invented by [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Sir Charles Parsons]] in 1884) currently generates about 80% of the [[electric power]] in the world using a variety of heat sources.

=== Turbines ===
[[File:Dreischluchtendamm hauptwall 2006.jpg|thumb|Large dams such as [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China can provide large amounts of [[hydroelectric]] power; it has a 22.5 [[Watt#Gigawatt|GW]] capability.]]
Almost all electrical power on Earth is generated with a [[turbine]] of some type. Turbines are commonly driven by wind, water, steam or burning gas. The turbine drives an [[electric generator]].
Power sources include:
*'''Steam'''
** Water is boiled by [[coal]] burned in a [[Fossil-fuel power station|thermal power plant]], about 40% of all electricity is generated this way.<ref>http://www.worldcoal.org/coal/uses-of-coal/coal-electricity/</ref>
** [[Nuclear fission]] heat created in a [[nuclear reactor]] creates steam. Less than 15% of electricity is generated this way.
**Renewables. The steam is generated by:
***[[Biomass]]
*** [[Solar thermal energy]] (the sun as the heat source): [[solar parabolic trough]]s and [[solar power tower]]s concentrate sunlight to heat a heat transfer fluid, which is then used to produce steam.
***[[Geothermal power]]. Either steam under pressure emerges from the ground and drives a turbine or hot water evaporates a low boiling liquid to create vapor to drive a turbine.
[[File:Hoover dam from air.jpg|thumb|Large dams such as [[Hoover Dam]] can provide large amounts of [[hydroelectric]] power; it has 2.07 [[Watt#Gigawatt|GW]] capability.]]

*'''Gas''' Natural gas is burned in a [[gas turbine]], turbines are driven directly by gases produced by [[combustion]]. [[Combined cycle]] are driven by both steam and natural gas. They generate power by burning natural gas in a [[gas turbine]] and use residual heat to generate steam. At least 20% of the worlds electricity is generated by natural gas.
*'''Water''' Energy is captured from the movement of water. From falling water (dam), the rise and fall of tides or [[Ocean thermal energy conversion|ocean thermal currents]]. Each driving a [[water turbine]] to produce approximately 16% of the worlds electricity.
*'''Wind''' The [[windmill]] was a very early [[wind turbine]]. In a [[solar updraft tower]] wind is artificially produced. Before 2010 less than 2% of the worlds electricity was produced from wind.

=== Reciprocating engines ===
Small electricity generators are often powered by [[reciprocating engine]]s burning [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], [[biogas]] or natural
gas. [[Diesel engine]]s are often used for back up generation, usually at low voltages. However most large power grids also use [[diesel generator]]s, originally provided as emergency back up for a specific facility such as a hospital, to feed power into the grid during certain circumstances. Biogas is often combusted where it is produced, such as a
landfill or wastewater treatment plant, with a reciprocating engine or a microturbine, which is a small gas turbine.
[[File:Mohave Generating Station 1.jpg|thumb|A coal-fired power plant in Laughlin, Nevada U.S.A. Owners of this plant ceased operations after declining to invest in pollution control equipment to comply with pollution regulations.<ref>{{cite news | author=Reuters News Service | title=Mohave Power Plant in Nevada to Close as Expected | date=2005-12-30 | publisher= | url =http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/34265/story.htm | work =Planet Ark | pages = | accessdate = 2007-07-16 }}</ref>]]

=== Photovoltaic panels ===
Unlike the solar heat concentrators mentioned above, [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic panels]] convert sunlight directly to electricity. Although sunlight is free and abundant, solar electricity is still usually more expensive to produce than large-scale mechanically generated power due to the cost of the panels. Low-efficiency silicon solar cells have been decreasing in cost and multijunction cells with close to 30% conversion efficiency are now commercially available. Over 40% efficiency has been demonstrated in experimental systems.<ref>[http://www.doe.gov/news/4503.htm ''New World Record Achieved in Solar Cell Technology''] (press release, 2006-12-05), U.S. Department of Energy.</ref> Until recently, photovoltaics were most commonly used in remote sites where there is no access to a commercial power grid, or as a supplemental electricity source for individual homes and businesses. Recent advances in manufacturing efficiency and photovoltaic technology, combined with subsidies driven by environmental concerns, have dramatically accelerated the deployment of solar panels. Installed capacity is growing by 40% per year led by increases in Germany, Japan, and the United States.

=== Electrochemical ===
[[Electrochemistry|Electrochemical]] electricity generation is important in portable and mobile applications. Currently, most electrochemical power comes from closed electrochemical cells ("[[Battery (electricity)|batteries]]").<ref>[http://www.eere.energy.gov/news/archive.cfm/pubDate=%7Bd%20'2003-09-24'%7D#6490 World's Largest Utility Battery System Installed in Alaska] (press release, 2003-09-24), U.S. Department of Energy. ''"13,670 nickel-cadmium battery cells to generate up to 40 megawatts of power for about 7 minutes, or 27 megawatts of power for 15 minutes."''</ref>

[[Primary cell]]s, such as the common [[zinc-carbon batteries]], act as power sources directly, but many types of cells are used as [[electricity storage|storage]] systems rather than primary generation systems.

Open electrochemical systems, known as [[fuel cell]]s, have been undergoing a great deal of research and development in the last few years. Fuel cells can be used to extract power either from natural fuels or from synthesized fuels (mainly electrolytic [[hydrogen]]) and so can be viewed as either generation systems or storage systems depending on their use.

=== Other generation methods ===
[[File:Turbine aalborg.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Wind turbine]]s usually provide electrical generation in conjunction with other methods of producing power.]]
Various other technologies have been studied and developed for power generation.

Solid-state generation (without moving parts) is of particular interest in portable applications. This area is largely dominated by [[thermoelectricity|thermoelectric]] (TE) devices, though [[thermionic converter|thermionic]] (TI) and [[thermophotovoltaic]] (TPV) systems have been developed as well. Typically, TE devices are used at lower temperatures than TI and TPV systems.

[[Piezoelectric]] devices are used for power generation from mechanical strain, particularly in [[power harvesting]].

[[Betavoltaics]] are another type of solid-state power generator which produces electricity from radioactive decay.
Fluid-based [[MHD generator|magnetohydrodynamic]] (MHD) power generation has been studied as a method for extracting electrical power from [[nuclear reactor]]s and also from more conventional fuel combustion systems. [[Osmotic power]] finally is another possibility at places where salt and fresh water merges (e.g. deltas, ...)

==Economics of generation and production of electricity ==
{{see also|Cost of electricity by source}}
The selection of electricity production modes and their economic viability varies in accordance with demand and region. The economics vary considerably [[Electricity pricing#Global electricity price comparison|around the world]], resulting in widespread selling prices, e.g. the price in Venezuela is 3 cents per kWh while in Denmark it is 40 cents per kWh. Hydroelectric plants, nuclear power plants, thermal power plants and renewable sources have their own pros and cons, and selection is based upon the local power requirement and the fluctuations in demand. All power grids have varying loads on them but the daily minimum is the base load, supplied by plants which run continuously.  Nuclear, coal, oil and gas plants can supply base load.

Thermal energy is economical in areas of high industrial density, as the high demand cannot be met by renewable sources. The effect of localized pollution is also minimized as industries are usually located away from residential areas. These plants can also withstand variation in load and consumption by adding more units or temporarily decreasing the production of some units.
Nuclear power plants can produce a huge amount of power from a single unit. However, recent disasters in Japan have raised concerns over the safety of nuclear power, and the capital cost of nuclear plants is very high. 
Hydroelectric power plants are located in areas where the potential energy from falling water can be harnessed for moving turbines and the generation of power. It is not an economically viable source of production where the load varies too much during the annual production cycle and the ability to store the flow of water is limited.

Renewable sources other than hydroelectricity (solar power, wind energy, tidal power, etc.) due to advancements in technology, and with mass production, their cost of production has come down and the energy is now in many cases cost-comparative with fossil fuels. Many governments around the world provide subsidies to offset the higher cost of any new power production, and to make the installation of renewable energy systems economically feasible. However, their use is frequently limited by their [[Intermittent energy source|intermittent nature]].
If natural gas prices are below $3 per million [[British thermal unit]]s, generating electricity from natural gas is cheaper than generating power by burning coal.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/modeledbehavior/2013/03/22/will-natural-gas-stay-cheap-enough-replace-coal-and-lower-us-carbon-emissions/ | work=Forbes | first=Karl | last=Smith| title= Will Natural Gas Stay Cheap Enough To Replace Coal And Lower Us Carbon Emissions| date= 22 March 2013| accessdate= 20 June 2015 }}</ref>

== Production ==
{{Update|section|date=March 2015}}

The production of electricity in 2009 was 20,053TWh.  Sources of electricity were fossil fuels 67%, renewable energy 16% (mainly hydroelectric, wind, solar and biomass), and nuclear power 13%, and other sources were 3%.  The majority of fossil fuel usage for the generation of electricity was coal and gas.  Oil was 5.5%, as it is the most expensive common commodity used to produce electrical energy.  Ninety-two percent of renewable energy was hydroelectric followed by wind at 6% and geothermal at 1.8%. Solar photovoltaic was 0.06%, and solar thermal was 0.004%.

==Cogeneration==
{{Main|Cogeneration}}
{{See also|Electrification}}
Co-generation is the practice of using exhaust or extracted steam from a turbine for heating purposes, such as drying paper, distilling petroleum in a refinery or for building heat.  Before central power stations were widely introduced it was common for industries, large hotels and commercial buildings to generate their own power and use low pressure exhaust steam for heating.<ref name=HB>{{Harvnb|Hunter|Bryant|1991}}</ref>  This practice carried on for many years after central stations became common and is still in use in many industries.

== Environmental concerns ==
{{Main|Environmental impact of electricity generation}}
{{see also|Global warming|Coal phase out}}
Variations between countries generating electrical power affect concerns about the environment. In France only 10% of electricity is generated from fossil fuels, the US is higher at 70% and China is at 80%.<ref name="Statistics and Balances"/>  The cleanliness of electricity depends on its source. Most scientists agree that emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases from fossil fuel-based electricity generation account for a significant portion of world greenhouse gas emissions; in the United States, electricity generation accounts for nearly 40% of emissions, the largest of any source. Transportation emissions are close behind, contributing about one-third of U.S. production of [[carbon dioxide]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003732690_carbon03.html | work=The Seattle Times | title=Carbon-emissions culprit? Coal | first=Seth | last=Borenstein | date=2007-06-03}}</ref>
In the United States, fossil fuel combustion for electric power generation is responsible for 65% of all emissions of [[sulfur dioxide]], the main component of acid rain.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sulfur Dioxide|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|url=http://www.epa.gov/air/sulfurdioxide/}}</ref> Electricity generation is the fourth highest combined source of [[NOx]], [[carbon monoxide]], and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] in the US.<ref>{{cite web|title=AirData|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|url=http://www.epa.gov/cgi-bin/broker?_service=airdata&_program=progs.webprogs.emcatbar.scl&_debug=2&geotype=us&geocode=USA&geoname=United+States&epol=CO+NOX+VOC+SO2+PM25+PM10&years=2002&mapsize=zsc&reqtype=viewmap}}</ref>
In July 2011, the UK parliament tabled a motion that "levels of (carbon) emissions from nuclear power were approximately three times lower per [[kilowatt hour]] than those of solar, four times lower than clean coal and 36 times lower than conventional coal".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2010-12/2061|title=Early day motion 2061|work=UK Parliament|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref>

==Water consumption==
Most large scale thermoelectric power stations consume considerable amounts of water for cooling purposes and boiler water make up - 1 L/kWh for once through (e.g. river cooling), and 1.7 L/kWh for cooling tower cooling.<ref>AAAS Annual Meeting 17 - 21 Feb 2011, Washington DC. Sustainable or Not? Impacts and Uncertainties of Low-Carbon Energy Technologies on Water.Evangelos Tzimas , European Commission, JRC Institute for Energy, Petten, Netherlands</ref> Water abstraction for cooling water accounts for about 40% of European total [[water abstraction]], although most of this water is returned to its source, albeit slightly warmer. Different cooling systems have different consumption vs. abstraction characteristics. [[Cooling tower]]s withdraw a small amount of water from the environment and evaporate most of it. Once-through systems withdraw a large amount but return it to the environment immediately, at a higher temperature.
