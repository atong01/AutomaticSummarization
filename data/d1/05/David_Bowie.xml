In David's account, Frampton led through force of personality, not intellect; his colleagues at Bromley Tech were famous for neither, and yielded the school's most gifted pupils to the arts, a regime so liberal that Frampton actively encouraged his own son, [[Peter Frampton|Peter]], to pursue a musical career with David, a partnership briefly intact thirty years later.<ref name">"bromleytech">Sandford (1997): pp. 21–22</ref></arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Bowie studied art, music and design, including layout and typesetting.
