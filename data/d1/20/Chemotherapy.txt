'''Chemotherapy''' (often abbreviated to '''chemo''' and sometimes '''CTX''' or '''CTx''') is a category of [[cancer treatment]] that uses [[chemical substance]]s, especially one or more anti-cancer drugs ([[list of chemotherapeutic agents|chemotherapeutic agents]]) that are given as part of a standardized [[chemotherapy regimen]]. Chemotherapy may be given with a [[cure|curative]] intent, or it may aim to prolong life or to [[Palliative care|reduce symptoms]] (palliative chemotherapy). Along with [[hormonal therapy (oncology)|hormonal therapy]] and [[targeted therapy]], it is one of the major categories of [[oncology#Specialties|medical oncology]] ([[pharmacotherapy]] for cancer). These modalities are often used in conjunction with other cancer treatments, such as [[radiation therapy]], [[surgery]], and/or [[hyperthermia therapy]]. Chemotherapy is also used to treat other conditions, including [[AL amyloidosis]], [[ankylosing spondylitis]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[Crohn's disease]], [[psoriasis]], [[psoriatic arthritis]], [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and [[scleroderma]].

Traditional chemotherapeutic agents are [[cytotoxicity|cytotoxic]], that is to say they act by killing cells that divide rapidly, one of the main properties of most cancer cells. This means that chemotherapy also harms cells that divide rapidly under normal circumstances: cells in the [[bone marrow]], [[digestive tract]], and [[hair follicle]]s. This results in the most common side-effects of chemotherapy: [[myelosuppression]] (decreased production of blood cells, hence also [[immunosuppression]]), [[mucositis]] (inflammation of the lining of the digestive tract), and [[alopecia]] (hair loss).

Some newer anticancer drugs (for example, various [[Monoclonal antibody therapy|monoclonal antibodies]]) are not indiscriminately cytotoxic, but rather target proteins that are abnormally expressed in cancer cells and that are essential for their growth. Such treatments are often referred to as [[targeted therapy]] (as distinct from classic chemotherapy) and are often used alongside traditional chemotherapeutic agents in antineoplastic treatment regimens.

Chemotherapy may use one drug at a time (single-agent chemotherapy) or several drugs at once (combination chemotherapy or polychemotherapy). The combination of chemotherapy and [[radiation therapy|radiotherapy]] is [[chemoradiotherapy]]. Chemotherapy using drugs that convert to cytotoxic activity only upon light exposure is called photochemotherapy or [[photodynamic therapy]].

There are a number of strategies in the administration of chemotherapeutic drugs used today. Chemotherapy may be given with a [[cure|curative]] intent or it may aim to prolong life or to [[Palliative care|palliate symptoms]].
* Combined modality chemotherapy is the use of drugs with other [[Cancer#Treatments|cancer treatments]], such as [[radiation therapy]], [[surgery]] and/or [[hyperthermia therapy]].
* Induction chemotherapy is the first line treatment of cancer with a chemotherapeutic drug. This type of chemotherapy is used for curative intent.<ref name="isbn0-470-09254-8">Airley, pp. 55-59</ref>
* Consolidation chemotherapy is given after remission in order to prolong the overall disease-free time and improve overall survival. The drug that is administered is the same as the drug that achieved remission.<ref name="isbn0-470-09254-8" />
* Intensification chemotherapy is identical to consolidation chemotherapy but a different drug than the induction chemotherapy is used.<ref name="isbn0-470-09254-8" />
* [[Combination chemotherapy]] involves treating a patient with a number of different drugs simultaneously. The drugs differ in their mechanism and side-effects. The biggest advantage is minimising the chances of resistance developing to any one agent. Also, the drugs can often be used at lower doses, reducing toxicity.<ref name="isbn0-470-09254-8" /><ref name="isbn0-443-07101-2 6">Wood, pp. 17-18</ref>
* [[Neoadjuvant]] chemotherapy is given prior to a local treatment such as surgery, and is designed to shrink the primary tumor.<ref name="isbn0-470-09254-8" /> It is also given to cancers with a high risk of micrometastatic disease.<ref name="isbn0-7817-7328-8">Perry, p. 42</ref>
* [[Adjuvant chemotherapy]] is given after a local treatment (radiotherapy or surgery). It can be used when there is little evidence of cancer present, but there is risk of recurrence.<ref name="isbn0-470-09254-8" /> It is also useful in killing any cancerous cells that have spread to other parts of the body. These [[micrometastases]] can be treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and can reduce relapse rates caused by these disseminated cells.<ref name="pmid16061845">{{cite journal | author = Epstein RJ | title = Maintenance therapy to suppress micrometastasis: the new challenge for adjuvant cancer treatment | journal = Clinical Cancer Research | volume = 11 | issue = 15 | pages = 5337–41 | date = Aug 2005 | pmid = 16061845 | doi = 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0437 }}</ref>
* [[Maintenance therapy|Maintenance]] chemotherapy is a repeated low-dose treatment to prolong remission.<ref name="isbn0-470-09254-8" />
* Salvage chemotherapy or palliative chemotherapy is given without curative intent, but simply to decrease tumor load and increase life expectancy. For these regimens, in general, a better toxicity profile is expected.<ref name="isbn0-470-09254-8" />

All chemotherapy regimens require that the patient be capable of undergoing the treatment. [[Performance status]] is often used as a measure to determine whether a patient can receive chemotherapy, or whether dose reduction is required.  Because only a fraction of the cells in a tumor die with each treatment ([[fractional kill]]), repeated doses must be administered to continue to reduce the size of the tumor.<ref name=skeel>{{cite book | name-list-format = vanc  |last1=Skeel |first1= R.

=== Efficacy ===
The efficacy of chemotherapy depends on the type of cancer and the stage. The overall effectiveness ranges from being curative for some cancers, such as some [[leukemias]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Nastoupil LJ, Rose AC, Flowers CR | title = Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: current treatment approaches | journal = Oncology | volume = 26 | issue = 5 | pages = 488–95 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22730604 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Freedman A | title = Follicular lymphoma: 2012 update on diagnosis and management | journal = American Journal of Hematology | volume = 87 | issue = 10 | pages = 988–95 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 23001911 | doi = 10.1002/ajh.23313 }}</ref> to being ineffective, such as in some [[brain tumors]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Rampling R, James A, Papanastassiou V | title = The present and future management of malignant brain tumours: surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 75 Suppl 2 | issue = Suppl 2 | pages = ii24–30 | date = Jun 2004 | pmid = 15146036 | pmc = 1765659 | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.2004.040535 }}</ref> to being needless in others, like most [[non-melanoma skin cancer]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Madan V, Lear JT, Szeimies RM | title = Non-melanoma skin cancer | journal = Lancet | volume = 375 | issue = 9715 | pages = 673–85 | date = Feb 2010 | pmid = 20171403 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61196-X }}</ref>

=== Dosage ===
[[File:Screenshot at 2013-08-16 14 52 30.png|thumb|left|Dose response relationship of cell killing by chemotherapeutic drugs on normal and cancer cells. At high doses the percentage of normal and cancer cells killed is very similar. For this reason, doses are chosen where anti-tumour activity exceeds normal cell death.<ref name=Corrie />]]
Dosage of chemotherapy can be difficult: If the dose is too low, it will be ineffective against the tumor, whereas, at excessive doses, the toxicity ([[adverse effect|side-effects]]) will be intolerable to the patient.<ref name=Corrie /> The standard method of determining chemotherapy dosage is based on calculated [[body surface area]] (BSA). The BSA is usually calculated with a mathematical formula or a [[nomogram]], using a patient's weight and height, rather than by direct measurement of body mass. This formula was originally derived in a 1916 study and attempted to translate medicinal doses established with laboratory animals to equivalent doses for humans.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Du Bois D|author2=Du Bois EF|title=A formula to estimate the approximate surface area if height and weight be known. 1916.|publisher=Archives Internal Medicine|volume=5|issue=5|pages=303–11}}</ref> The study only included 9 human subjects.<ref name="dosing strategies">{{cite journal|author1=Felici A.|author2=J.

Recently, the validity of this method in calculating uniform doses has been questioned. The reason for this is that the formula only takes into account the individual's weight and height. Drug absorption and clearance are influenced by multiple factors, including age, gender, metabolism, disease state, organ function, drug-to-drug interactions, genetics, and obesity, which has a major impact on the actual concentration of the drug in the patient's bloodstream.<ref name="pmid17305252" /><ref name="pmid11953888">{{cite journal | author = Gurney H | title = How to calculate the dose of chemotherapy | journal = British Journal of Cancer | volume = 86 | issue = 8 | pages = 1297–302 | date = Apr 2002 | pmid = 11953888 | pmc = 2375356 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bjc.6600139 }}</ref><ref name="pmid22965963">{{cite journal | author = Beumer JH, Chu E, Salamone SJ | title = Body-surface area-based chemotherapy dosing: appropriate in the 21st century? | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 30 | issue = 31 | pages = 3896–7 | date = Nov 2012 | pmid = 22965963 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2012.44.2863 }}</ref> As a result, there is high variability in the systemic chemotherapy drug concentration among patients dosed by BSA, and this variability has been demonstrated to be more than 10-fold for many drugs.<ref name="dosing strategies" /><ref name="role of body">{{cite journal|author1=Baker SD|author2=Verweij J|author3=Rowinsky EK|author4=Donehower RC|author5=Schellens JH|author6=Grochow LB|author7=Sparreboom A|title=Role of body surface area in dosing of investigational anticancer agents in adults, 1991–2001|publisher=J Natl Cancer Inst|year=2002|volume=94|issue=24|pages=1883–8}}</ref>   In other words, if two patients receive the same dose of a given drug based on BSA, the concentration of that drug in the bloodstream of one patient may be 10 times higher or lower compared to that of the other patient.<ref name="role of body" /> This variability is typical with many chemotherapy drugs dosed by BSA, and, as shown below, was demonstrated in a study of 14 common chemotherapy drugs.<ref name="dosing strategies" />

[[File:Improvement in Response Rate.jpg|thumb|180px|right|5-FU dose management results in significantly better response and survival rates versus BSA dosing.<ref name="individual fluorouracil" />]]
The result of this pharmacokinetic variability among patients is that many patients do not receive the right dose to achieve optimal treatment effectiveness with minimized toxic side effects. Some patients are overdosed while others are underdosed.<ref name="pmid17305252" /><ref name="pmid11953888" /><ref name="pmid22965963" /><ref name="individual fluorouracil">{{cite journal|author1=Gamelin EC|author2=Delva R|author3=Jacob J|author4=Merrouche Y|author5=Raoul JL|author6=Pezet D|author7=Dorval E|author8=Piot G|author9=Morel A|author10=Boisdron-Celle M|title= Individual fluorouracil dose adjustment based on pharmacokinetic follow-up compared with conventional dosage: Results of a multicenter randomized trial of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer|publisher=J Clin Oncol|year=2008|volume=26|issue=13|pages=2099–2105}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author1=Saam J|author2=Critchfield GC|author3=Hamilton SA|author4=Roa BB|author5=Wenstrup RJ|author6=Kaldate RR|title=Body Surface Area-based Dosing of 5-Fluorouracil Results in Extensive Interindividual Variability in 5-Fluorouracil Exposure in Colorectal Cancer Patients on FOLFOX Regimens|publisher=Clin Colorectal Cancer|year=2011|volume=10|issue=3|pages=203–206}}</ref><ref name="dose adjustment">{{cite journal|author1=Capitain O|author2=Asevoaia A|author3=Boisdron-Celle M|author4=Poirier AL|author5=Morel A|author6=Gamelin E|title=Individual Fluorouracil Dose Adjustment in FOLFOX Based on Pharmacokinetic Follow-Up Compared With Conventional Body-Area-Surface Dosing: A Phase II, Proof-of-Concept Study|publisher=Clin Colorectal Cancer|year=2012|volume=11|issue=4|pages=263–267}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author1=Kaldate RR|author2=Haregewoin A|author3=Grier CE|author4=Hamilton SA|author5=McLeod HL|title=Modeling the 5-fluorouracil area under the curve versus dose relationship to develop a pharmacokinetic dosing algorithm for colorectal cancer patients receiving FOLFOX6|publisher=Oncologist, 2012|volume=17|issue=3|pages=296–302}}</ref> For example, in a randomized clinical trial, investigators found 85% of metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) did not receive the optimal therapeutic dose when dosed by the BSA standard—68% were underdosed and 17% were overdosed.<ref name="individual fluorouracil" />

There has been recent controversy over the use of BSA to calculate chemotherapy doses for [[obese]] patients.<ref name="dosing chemotherapy">{{cite journal | author = Hunter RJ, Navo MA, Thaker PH, Bodurka DC, Wolf JK, Smith JA | title = Dosing chemotherapy in obese patients: actual versus assigned body surface area (BSA) | journal = Cancer Treatment Reviews | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–78 | date = Feb 2009 | pmid = 18922643 | doi = 10.1016/j.ctrv.2008.07.005 | publisher = Cancer Treat Rev }}</ref> Because of their higher BSA, clinicians often arbitrarily reduce the dose prescribed by the BSA formula for fear of [[overdosing]].<ref name="dosing chemotherapy" /> In many cases, this can result in sub-optimal treatment.<ref name="dosing chemotherapy" />

Several clinical studies have demonstrated that when chemotherapy dosing is individualized to achieve optimal systemic drug exposure, treatment outcomes are improved and toxic side effects are reduced.<ref name="individual fluorouracil" /><ref name="dose adjustment" /> In the 5-FU clinical study cited above, patients whose dose was adjusted to achieve a pre-determined target exposure realized an 84% improvement in treatment response rate and a six-month improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with those dosed by BSA.<ref name="individual fluorouracil" />

}}
In the same study, investigators compared the incidence of common 5-FU-associated grade 3/4 toxicities between the dose-adjusted patients and the BSA-dosed patients.<ref name="individual fluorouracil" /> The incidence of debilitating grades of diarrhea was reduced from 18% in the BSA-dosed group to 4% in the dose-adjusted group of patients and serious hematologic side effects were eliminated.<ref name="individual fluorouracil" />  Because of the reduced toxicity, dose-adjusted patients were able to be treated for longer periods of time.<ref name="individual fluorouracil" /> BSA-dosed patients were treated for a total of 680 months while dose-adjusted patients were treated for a total of 791 months.<ref name="individual fluorouracil" /> Completing the course of treatment is an important factor in achieving better treatment outcomes.

Similar results were found in a study involving colorectal cancer patients treated with the popular [[FOLFOX]] regimen.<ref name="dose adjustment" /> The incidence of serious diarrhea was reduced from 12% in the BSA-dosed group of patients to 1.7% in the dose-adjusted group, and the incidence of severe mucositis was reduced from 15% to 0.8%.<ref name="dose adjustment" />

The FOLFOX study also demonstrated an improvement in treatment outcomes.<ref name="dose adjustment" /> Positive response increased from 46% in the BSA-dosed patients to 70% in the dose-adjusted group.  Median progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) both improved by six months in the dose adjusted group.<ref name="dose adjustment" />

One approach that can help clinicians individualize chemotherapy dosing is to measure the drug levels in blood plasma over time and adjust dose according to a formula or algorithm to achieve optimal exposure. With an established target exposure for optimized treatment effectiveness with minimized toxicities, dosing can be personalized to achieve target exposure and optimal results for each patient.  Such an algorithm was used in the clinical trials cited above and resulted in significantly improved treatment outcomes.

[[File:Cross-linked DNA by nitrogen mustard.png|thumb|left| Two DNA bases that are cross-linked by a nitrogen mustard. Different nitrogen mustards will have different chemical groups (R). The nitrogen mustards most commonly alkylate the N7 nitrogen of guanine (as shown here) but other atoms can be alkylated.<ref name =Siddik />]]

==== Alkylating agents ====
{{Main|Alkylating antineoplastic agent}}
Alkylating agents are the oldest group of chemotherapeutics in use today. Originally derived from [[mustard gas]] used in [[World War I]], there are now many types of alkylating agents in use.<ref name=Corrie /> They are so named because of their ability to [[alkylation|alkylate]] many molecules, including [[protein]]s, [[RNA]] and [[DNA]]. This ability to bind [[covalent bond|covalently]] to DNA via their [[alkyl group]] is the primary cause for their anti-cancer effects.<ref name=lind>{{cite journal|last=Lind M.J.|title=Principles of cytotoxic chemotherapy|journal=Medicine|year=2008|volume=36|issue=1|pages=19–23|doi=10.1016/j.mpmed.2007.10.003|first1=M.J.}}</ref> DNA is made of two strands and the molecules may either bind twice to one strand of DNA (intrastrand crosslink) or may bind once to both strands (interstrand crosslink). If the cell tries to replicate crosslinked DNA during [[cell division]], or tries to repair it, the DNA strands can break. This leads to a form of programmed cell death called [[apoptosis]].<ref name =Siddik>{{cite book | name-list-format = vanc |last=Siddik ZH|title=Mechanisms of Action of Cancer Chemotherapeutic Agents: DNA-Interactive Alkylating Agents and Antitumour Platinum-Based Drugs|year=2005|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd|doi=10.1002/0470025077.chap84b}}</ref><ref name="pmid19002790" /> Alkylating agents will work at any point in the cell cycle and thus are known as cell cycle-independent drugs. For this reason the effect on the cell is dose dependent; the fraction of cells that die is directly proportional to the dose of drug.<ref name="pmid14508075" />

The subtypes of alkylating agents are the [[nitrogen mustard]]s, [[nitrosoureas]], [[tetrazine]]s, [[aziridine]]s,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Giorgi-Renault S., Renault J., Baron M., Gebel-Servolles P., Delic J., Cros S., Paoletti C. | year = 1988 | title = Heterocyclic quinones XIII.

Tetrazines include [[dacarbazine]], [[mitozolomide]] and [[temozolomide]]. Aziridines include [[thiotepa]], [[mytomycin]] and diaziquone (AZQ).

==== Antimetabolites ====
[[File:Deoxcytidine, Gemcitidine and Decitabine.png|thumb|Deoxcytidine (left) and two anti-metabolite drugs (centre and right); [[Gemcitabine]] and [[Decitabine]]. The drugs are very similar but they have subtle differences in their [[chemical group]]s.]]
{{Main|Antimetabolite}}
[[Anti-metabolite]]s are a group of molecules that impede DNA and RNA synthesis. Many of them have a similar structure to the building blocks of DNA and RNA. The building blocks are [[nucleotide]]s; a molecule comprising a [[nucleobase]], a sugar and a [[phosphate group]]. The nucleobases are divided into [[purine]]s ([[guanine]] and [[adenine]]) and [[pyrimidine]]s ([[cytosine]], [[thymine]] and [[uracil]]). Anti-metabolites resemble either nucleobases or nucleosides (a nucleotide without the phosphate group), but have altered [[chemical group]]s.<ref name="pmid19476376">{{cite journal | author = Parker WB | title = Enzymology of purine and pyrimidine antimetabolites used in the treatment of cancer | journal = Chemical Reviews | volume = 109 | issue = 7 | pages = 2880–93 | date = Jul 2009 | pmid = 19476376 | pmc = 2827868 | doi = 10.1021/cr900028p }}</ref> These drugs exert their effect by either blocking the enzymes required for DNA synthesis or becoming incorporated into DNA or RNA. By inhibiting the enzymes involved in DNA synthesis, they prevent mitosis because the DNA cannot duplicate itself. Also, after misincorporation of the molecules into DNA, [[DNA damage]] can occur and programmed cell death ([[apoptosis]]) is induced. Unlike alkylating agents, anti-metabolites are cell cycle dependent. This means that they only work during a specific part of the cell cycle, in this case [[S-phase]] (the DNA synthesis phase). For this reason, at a certain dose, the effect plateaus and proportionally no more cell death occurs with increased doses. Subtypes of the anti-metabolites are the [[antifolate|anti-folates]], fluoropyrimidines, deoxynucleoside analogues and [[thiopurine]]s.<ref name=lind /><ref name="pmid19476376" />

The anti-folates include [[methotrexate]] and [[pemetrexed]]. Methotrexate inhibits [[dihydrofolate reductase]] (DHFR), an enzyme that regenerates [[tetrahydrofolate]] from [[dihydrofolate]].

==== Anti-microtubule agents ====
[[File:Microtubules and alkaloids.png|thumb|left|Vinca alkaloids prevent the assembly of microtubules, whereas taxanes prevent their disassembly. Both mechanisms cause defective mitosis.]]
Anti-microtubule agents are [[plant]]-derived chemicals that block cell division by preventing [[microtubule]] function. Microtubules are an important cellular structure composed of two proteins; [[α-tubulin]] and [[β-tubulin]]. They are hollow rod shaped structures that are required for cell division, among other cellular functions.<ref name="pmid1687171">{{cite journal | author = Rowinsky EK, Donehower RC | title = The clinical pharmacology and use of antimicrotubule agents in cancer chemotherapeutics | journal = Pharmacology & Therapeutics | volume = 52 | issue = 1 | pages = 35–84 | date = Oct 1991 | pmid = 1687171 | doi = 10.1016/0163-7258(91)90086-2 }}</ref> Microtubules are dynamic structures, which means that they are permanently in a state of assembly and disassembly. [[Vinca alkaloid]]s and [[taxane]]s are the two main groups of anti-microtubule agents, and although both of these groups of drugs cause microtubule dysfunction, their mechanisms of action are completely opposite. The vinca alkaloids prevent the formation of the microtubules, whereas the taxanes prevent the microtubule disassembly. By doing so, they prevent the cancer cells from completing mitosis. Following this, cell cycle arrest occurs, which induces programmed cell death ([[apoptosis]]).<ref name=lind /><ref name="pmid20577942" /> Also, these drugs can affect blood vessel growth; an essential process that tumours utilise in order to grow and metastasise.<ref name="pmid20577942">{{cite journal | author = Yue QX, Liu X, Guo DA | title = Microtubule-binding natural products for cancer therapy | journal = Planta Medica | volume = 76 | issue = 11 | pages = 1037–43 | date = Aug 2010 | pmid = 20577942 | doi = 10.1055/s-0030-1250073 }}</ref>

Vinca alkaloids are derived from the [[Madagascar periwinkle]], ''Catharanthus roseus'' (formerly known as ''Vinca rosea''). They bind to specific sites on tubulin, inhibiting the assembly of tubulin into microtubules. The original vinca alkaloids are completely natural chemicals that include [[vincristine]] and [[vinblastine]]. Following the success of these drugs, semi-synthetic vinca alkaloids were produced: [[vinorelbine]], [[vindesine]], and [[vinflunine]].<ref name="pmid20577942" /> These drugs are [[cell cycle]]-specific. They bind to the tubulin molecules in [[S-phase]] and prevent proper microtubule formation required for [[M-phase]].<ref name="pmid14508075" />

Taxanes are natural and semi-synthetic drugs. The first drug of their class, [[paclitaxel]], was originally extracted from the [[Pacific Yew]] tree, ''Taxus brevifolia''.  Now this drug and another in this class, [[docetaxel]], are produced semi-synthetically from a chemical found in the bark of another Yew tree; ''[[Taxus baccata]]''. These drugs promote microtubule stability, preventing their disassembly. Paclitaxel prevents the cell cycle at the boundary of G2-M, whereas docetaxel exerts its effect during [[S-phase]]. Taxanes present difficulties in formulation as medicines because they are poorly soluble in water.<ref name="pmid20577942" />

[[Podophyllotoxin]] is an antineoplastic [[lignan]] obtained primarily from the [[American Mayapple]] (''Podophyllum peltatum'') and [[Himalayan Mayapple]] (''Podophyllum hexandrum'' or ''Podophyllum emodi''). It has anti-microtubule activity, and its mechanism is similar to that of vinca alkaloids in that they bind to tubulin, inhibiting microtubule formation. Podophyllotoxin is used to produce two other drugs with different mechanisms of action: [[etoposide]] and [[teniposide]].<ref name="pmid9562603">{{cite journal | author = Damayanthi Y, Lown JW | title = Podophyllotoxins: current status and recent developments | journal = Current Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 205–52 | date = Jun 1998 | pmid = 9562603 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Liu YQ, Yang L, Tian X|title=Podophyllotoxin: current perspectives|journal=Curr Bioactive Compounds|year=2007|volume=3|issue=1|pages=37–66|doi=10.1016/j.jallcom.2006.06.070|first1=Cong|last2=Zhang|first2=Wei|last3=Qian|first3=Zhengnan|last4=Hua|first4=Zhong|last5=Zhao|first5=Qibo|last6=Sui|first6=Yu|last7=Su|first7=Wenhui|last8=Zhang|first8=Ming|last9=Liu|first9=Zhuhong|last10=Liu|first10=Guodong|last11=Wu|first11=Guangheng}}</ref>

==== Topoisomerase inhibitors ====
[[File:Topoisomerase Inhibitor.JPG|thumb|Topoisomerase I and II Inhibitors]]
[[Topoisomerase inhibitor]]s are drugs that affect the activity of two enzymes: [[topoisomerase I]] and [[topoisomerase II]]. When the DNA double-strand helix is unwound, during DNA replication or [[transcription (biology)|transcription]], for example, the adjacent unopened DNA winds tighter (supercoils), like opening the middle of a twisted rope. The stress caused by this effect is in part aided by the topoisomerase enzymes. They produce single- or double-strand breaks into DNA, reducing the tension in the DNA strand. This allows the normal unwinding of DNA to occur during [[DNA replication|replication]] or [[transcription (biology)|transcription]]. Inhibition of topoisomerase I or II interferes with both of these processes.<ref>{{cite book | name-list-format = vanc |last=Lodish H, Berk A, Zipursky SL|title=Molecular Cell Biology. 4th edition.

Two topoisomerase I inhibitors, [[irinotecan]] and [[topotecan]], are semi-synthetically derived from [[camptothecin]], which is obtained from the Chinese ornamental tree ''[[Camptotheca acuminata]]''.<ref name="pmid14508075" /> Drugs that target topoisomerase II can be divided into two groups. The topoisomerase II poisons cause increased levels enzymes bound to DNA. This prevents DNA replication and [[transcription (biology)|transcription]], causes DNA strand breaks, and leads to programmed cell death ([[apoptosis]]). These agents include [[etoposide]], [[doxorubicin]], [[mitoxantrone]] and [[teniposide]]. The second group, catalytic inhibitors, are drugs that block the activity of topoisomerase II, and therefore prevent DNA synthesis and translation because the DNA cannot unwind properly. This group includes [[novobiocin]], merbarone, and [[aclarubicin]], which also have other significant mechanisms of action.<ref name="pmid19377506">{{cite journal | author = Nitiss JL | title = Targeting DNA topoisomerase II in cancer chemotherapy | journal = Nature Reviews.

==== Cytotoxic antibiotics ====
The cytotoxic antibiotics are a varied group of drugs that have various mechanisms of action. The group includes the [[anthracycline]]s and other drugs including [[actinomycin]], [[bleomycin]], [[plicamycin]], and [[mitomycin]]. [[Doxorubicin]] and [[daunorubicin]] were the first two anthracyclines, and were obtained from the [[bacterium]] ''[[Streptomyces peucetius]]''. Derivatives of these compounds include [[epirubicin]] and [[idarubicin]]. Other clinically used drugs in the anthracyline group are [[pirarubicin]], [[aclarubicin]], and [[mitoxantrone]]. The mechanisms of anthracyclines include [[DNA intercalation]] (molecules insert between the two strands of DNA), generation of highly reactive [[free radicals]] that damage intercellular molecules and topoisomerase inhibition.<ref name="pmid15169927">{{cite journal | author = Minotti G, Menna P, Salvatorelli E, Cairo G, Gianni L | title = Anthracyclines: molecular advances and pharmacologic developments in antitumor activity and cardiotoxicity | journal = Pharmacological Reviews | volume = 56 | issue = 2 | pages = 185–229 | date = Jun 2004 | pmid = 15169927 | doi = 10.1124/pr.56.2.6 }}</ref> Actinomycin is a complex molecule that intercalates DNA and prevents [[RNA synthesis]].<ref name="pmid2410919">{{cite journal | author = Sobell HM | title = Actinomycin and DNA transcription | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 82 | issue = 16 | pages = 5328–31 | date = Aug 1985 | pmid = 2410919 | pmc = 390561 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.82.16.5328 | bibcode = 1985PNAS...82.5328S }}</ref> Bleomycin, a [[glycopeptide]] isolated from ''Streptomyces verticillus'', also intercalates DNA, but produces [[free radical]]s that damage DNA.

=== Delivery ===
[[File:Cyclophosphamide iv.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Cyclophosphamide]] IV drip]]
Most chemotherapy is [[Route of administration|delivered]] [[intravenous therapy|intravenously]], although a number of agents can be administered orally (e.g., [[melphalan]], [[busulfan]], [[capecitabine]]).

There are many intravenous methods of drug delivery, known as vascular access devices. These include the [[Winged infusion set|winged infusion device]], [[Intravenous therapy#Peripheral cannula|peripheral cannula]], midline catheter, [[peripherally inserted central catheter]] (PICC), [[central venous catheter]] and [[implantable port]]. The devices have different applications regarding duration of chemotherapy treatment, method of delivery and types of chemotherapeutic agent.<ref name="isbn0-443-07101-2 3">{{cite book | name-list-format = vanc  |author=Wood, Miriam; David Brighton|title=The Royal Marsden Hospital handbook of cancer chemotherapy: a guide for the multidisciplinary team |publisher=Elsevier Churchill Livingstone |location=St. Louis, Mo |year=2005|pages=93–94 |isbn=0-443-07101-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Depending on the patient, the cancer, the stage of cancer, the type of chemotherapy, and the dosage, intravenous chemotherapy may be given on either an [[inpatient]] or an [[outpatient]] basis. For continuous, frequent or prolonged intravenous chemotherapy administration, various systems may be surgically inserted into the vasculature to maintain access.<ref name="isbn0-443-07101-2 5">Wood, pp. 113-118</ref> Commonly used systems are the [[Hickman line]], the [[Port-a-Cath]], and the [[PICC line]].

If the cancer has [[central nervous system]] involvement, or with meningeal disease, [[intrathecal]] chemotherapy may be administered.<ref name=Corrie />

== Adverse effects ==

[[Chemotherapeutic]] techniques have a range of side-effects that depend on the type of medications used. The most common medications affect mainly the [[fast-dividing cells]] of the body, such as blood cells and the cells lining the mouth, stomach, and intestines. Chemotherapy-related toxicities can occur acutely after administration, within hours or days, or chronically, from weeks to years.<ref name="isbn0-470-09254-8 2">Airley, p. 265</ref>

=== Immunosuppression and myelosuppression ===
Virtually all chemotherapeutic regimens can cause depression of the [[immune system]], often by paralysing the [[bone marrow]] and leading to a decrease of [[white blood cell]]s, [[red blood cell]]s, and [[platelet]]s.
[[Anemia]] and [[thrombocytopenia]], when they occur, are improved with [[blood transfusion]]. [[Neutropenia]] (a decrease of the [[neutrophil granulocyte]] count below 0.5 x 10<sup>9</sup>/[[litre]]) can be improved with synthetic [[G-CSF]] ([[granulocyte]]-colony-stimulating factor, e.g., [[filgrastim]], [[lenograstim]]).

In very severe [[myelosuppression]], which occurs in some regimens, almost all the bone marrow [[stem cell]]s (cells that produce [[white blood cells|white]] and [[red blood cell]]s) are destroyed, meaning ''allogenic'' or ''[[autologous]]'' [[bone marrow transplant|bone marrow cell transplants]] are necessary. (In autologous BMTs, cells are removed from the patient before the treatment, multiplied and then re-injected afterward; in ''allogenic'' BMTs, the source is a donor.) However, some patients still develop diseases because of this interference with bone marrow.

Although patients are encouraged to wash their hands, avoid sick people, and take other infection-reducing steps, about 85% of infections are due to naturally occurring microorganisms in the patient's own [[gastrointestinal tract]] (including [[oral cavity]]) and skin.<ref name="internal_medicine_a05">Huang, p. 130</ref> This may manifest as systemic infections, such as [[sepsis]], or as localized outbreaks, such as [[Herpes simplex]], [[shingles]], or other members of the [[human herpes virus|Herpesviridea]].<ref name="HSV">{{cite journal | author = Elad S, Zadik Y, Hewson I, Hovan A, Correa ME, Logan R, Elting LS, Spijkervet FK, Brennan MT | title = A systematic review of viral infections associated with oral involvement in cancer patients: a spotlight on Herpesviridea | journal = Supportive Care in Cancer | volume = 18 | issue = 8 | pages = 993–1006 | date = Aug 2010 | pmid = 20544224 | doi = 10.1007/s00520-010-0900-3 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/g476114717852h80/ }}</ref> Sometimes, chemotherapy treatments are postponed because the immune system is suppressed to a critically low level.

Weight gain can also be caused by some steroid medications. These side-effects can frequently be reduced or eliminated with [[antiemetic]] drugs. Self-care measures, such as eating frequent small meals and drinking clear liquids or [[Ginger#Medicinal use|ginger]] tea, are often recommended. In general, this is a temporary effect, and frequently resolves within a week of finishing treatment.

=== Nausea and vomiting ===
{{Further|Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting}}
[[Nausea]] and [[vomiting]] are two of the most feared cancer treatment-related side-effects for cancer patients and their families. In 1983, Coates et al. found that patients receiving chemotherapy ranked nausea and vomiting as the first and second most severe side-effects, respectively.

Effective mediation of these unpleasant and sometimes-crippling symptoms results in increased quality of life for the patient and more efficient treatment cycles, due to less stoppage of treatment due to better tolerance by the patient, and due to better overall health of the patient.

=== Hair loss ===
[[Alopecia|Hair loss]] (Alopecia) can be caused by chemotherapy that kills rapidly dividing cells; other medications may cause hair to thin.  These are most often temporary effects: hair usually starts to regrow a few weeks after the last treatment, and can sometimes change colour, texture, thickness and style. Sometimes hair has a tendency to curl after regrowth, resulting in "chemo curls." Severe hair loss occurs most often with drugs such as [[doxorubicin]], [[daunorubicin]], [[paclitaxel]], [[docetaxel]], [[cyclophosphamide]], [[ifosfamide]] and [[etoposide]]. Permanent thinning or hair loss can result from some standard chemotherapy regimens.

Chemotherapy induced hair loss occurs by a non-androgenic mechanism, and can manifests as [[alopecia totalis]], telogen effluvium, or less often [[alopecia areata]].<ref name="pmid17642856">{{cite journal | author = Chadha V, Shenoi SD | title = Hair loss in cancer chemotherapeutic patients | journal = Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprology | volume = 69 | issue = 2 | pages = 131–132 | year = 2003 | pmid = 17642856 }}</ref> It is usually associated with systemic treatment due to the high mitotic rate of hair follicles, and more reversible than androgenic hair loss,<ref name="pmid23187775">{{cite journal | author = Lemieux J | title = Reducing chemotherapy-induced alopecia with scalp cooling | journal = Clinical Advances in Hematology & Oncology | volume = 10 | issue = 10 | pages = 681–682 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 23187775 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Shapiro J, Price VH | title = Hair regrowth.

=== Secondary neoplasm ===
Development of secondary neoplasia after successful chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy treatment can occur. The most common [[secondary neoplasm]] is secondary acute myeloid leukemia, which develops primarily after treatment with alkylating agents or topoisomerase inhibitors.<ref>U. Rüther, C. Nunnensiek, H.-J.

=== Infertility ===
Some types of chemotherapy are gonadotoxic and may cause [[infertility]].<ref name=Brydoy>{{cite journal | author = Brydøy M, Fosså SD, Dahl O, Bjøro T | title = Gonadal dysfunction and fertility problems in cancer survivors | journal = Acta Oncologica | volume = 46 | issue = 4 | pages = 480–9 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17497315 | doi = 10.1080/02841860601166958 | url = http://informahealthcare.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02841860601166958 }}</ref> Chemotherapies with high risk include procarbazine and other alkylating drugs such as cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, busulfan, melphalan, chlorambucil, and chlormethine.<ref name=Brydoy /> Drugs with medium risk include doxorubicin and platinum analogs such as cisplatin and carboplatin.<ref name=Brydoy /> On the other hand, therapies with low risk of gonadotoxicity include plant derivatives such as vincristine and vinblastine, [[antibiotics]] such as bleomycin and dactinomycin, and antimetabolites such as methotrexate, mercaptopurine, and 5-fluorouracil.<ref name=Brydoy />

[[Female infertility]] by chemotherapy appears to be secondary to [[premature ovarian failure]] by loss of [[primordial follicles]].<ref name=Morgan2012>{{cite journal | author = Morgan S, Anderson RA, Gourley C, Wallace WH, Spears N | title = How do chemotherapeutic agents damage the ovary? | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 525–35 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22647504 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dms022 }}</ref> This loss is not necessarily a direct effect of the chemotherapeutic agents, but could be due to an increased rate of growth initiation to replace damaged developing follicles.<ref name=Morgan2012 />

Patients may choose between several methods of [[fertility preservation]] prior to chemotherapy, including [[cryopreservation]] of semen, ovarian tissue, oocytes, or embryos.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Gurgan T, Salman C, Demirol A | title = Pregnancy and assisted reproduction techniques in men and women after cancer treatment | journal = Placenta | volume = 29 Suppl B | issue =  | pages = 152–9 | date = Oct 2008 | pmid = 18790328 | doi = 10.1016/j.placenta.2008.07.007 }}</ref> As more than half of cancer patients are elderly, this adverse effect is only relevant for a minority of patients.

Potential protective or attenuating agents include [[GnRH analog]]s, where several studies have shown a protective effect ''[[in vivo]]'' in humans, but some studies show no such effect. [[Sphingosine-1-phosphate]] (S1P) has shown similar effect, but its mechanism of inhibiting the [[Sphingomyelin#Apoptosis|sphingomyelin apoptotic pathway]] may also interfere with the [[apoptosis]] action of chemotherapy drugs.<ref name="RonessKalich-Philosoph2014">{{cite journal | author = Roness H, Kalich-Philosoph L, Meirow D | title = Prevention of chemotherapy-induced ovarian damage: possible roles for hormonal and non-hormonal attenuating agents | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 759–774 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24833728 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmu019 }}</ref>

In chemotherapy as a [[conditioning regimen]] in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, a study of patients conditioned with cyclophosphamide alone for severe aplastic anemia came to the result that ovarian recovery occurred in all women younger than 26 years at time of transplantation, but only in five of 16 women older than 26 years.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Tichelli A, Rovó A | title = Fertility issues following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation | journal = Expert Review of Hematology | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 375–388 | date = Aug 2013 | pmid = 23991924 | doi = 10.1586/17474086.2013.816507 | url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/810686_2?nlid=34365_904 }}

=== Peripheral neuropathy ===
{{further|Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy}}
Between 30 and 40 percent of patients undergoing chemotherapy experience [[chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy]] (CIPN), a progressive, enduring, and often irreversible condition, causing pain, tingling, numbness and sensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes progressing to the arms and legs.<ref name = NCI>{{vcite journal | author = del Pino BM | date = Feb 23, 2010 | journal = NCI Cancer Bulletin | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | page = 6 | title = Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral Neuropathy | url = http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/research/chemotherapy-induced-peripheral-neuropathy}}</ref> Chemotherapy drugs associated with CIPN include [[thalidomide]], [[epothilone]]s, [[vinca alkaloid]]s, [[taxane]]s, [[proteasome inhibitor]]s, and the platinum-based drugs.<ref name = NCI /><ref>{{vcite journal|url=http://www.kup.at/kup/pdf/10376.pdf|author=Grisold W, Oberndorfer S, Windebank AJ|journal=European Association of Neurooncology Magazine|title=Chemotherapy and polyneuropathies|year=2012|volume=12|issue=1}}</ref><ref>http://www.ehealthme.com/ds/herceptin/peripheral%20sensory%20neuropathy</ref> Whether CIPN arises, and to what degree, is determined by the choice of drug, duration of use, the total amount consumed and whether the patient already has [[peripheral neuropathy]].

=== Tumor lysis syndrome ===
In particularly large tumors and cancers with high [[white cell count]]s, such as [[lymphoma]]s, [[teratoma]]s, and some [[leukemia]]s, some patients develop [[tumor lysis syndrome]]. The rapid breakdown of cancer cells causes the release of chemicals from the inside of the cells. Following this, high levels of [[hyperuricemia|uric acid]], [[hyperkalemia|potassium]] and [[hyperphosphatemia|phosphate]] are found in the blood. High levels of phosphate induce secondary hypoparathyroidism, resulting in low levels of calcium in the blood.  This causes kidney damage and the high levels of potassium can cause [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|cardiac arrhythmia]]. Although prophylaxis is available and is often initiated in patients with large tumors, this is a dangerous side-effect that can lead to death if left untreated.<ref name="isbn0-443-07101-2 4">Wood, p. 202</ref>

=== Organ damage ===
[[Cardiotoxicity]] (heart damage) is especially prominent with the use of [[anthracycline]] drugs ([[doxorubicin]], [[epirubicin]], [[idarubicin]], and [[liposomal doxorubicin]]). The cause of this is most likely due to the production of [[free radical]]s in the cell and subsequent [[DNA damage]]. Other chemotherapeutic agents that cause cardiotoxicity, but at a lower incidence, are [[cyclophosphamide]], [[docetaxel]] and [[clofarabine]].<ref name="pmid22382639">{{cite journal | author = Shaikh AY, Shih JA | title = Chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity | journal = Current Heart Failure Reports | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 117–27 | date = Jun 2012 | pmid = 22382639 | doi = 10.1007/s11897-012-0083-y }}</ref>

[[Hepatotoxicity]] (liver damage) can be caused by many cytotoxic drugs. The susceptibility of an individual to liver damage can be altered by other factors such as the cancer itself, [[viral hepatitis]], [[immunosuppression]] and [[nutritional deficiency]]. The liver damage can consist of damage to liver cells, [[Hepatic veno-occlusive disease|hepatic sinusoidal syndrome]] (obstruction of the veins in the liver), [[cholestasis]] (where bile does not flow from the liver to the intestine) and [[liver fibrosis]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Thatishetty AV, Agresti N, O'Brien CB | title = Chemotherapy-induced hepatotoxicity | journal = Clinics in Liver Disease | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 671–86, ix–x | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24099024 | doi = 10.1016/j.cld.2013.07.010 | url = http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cld.2013.07.010 }}</ref><ref name="pmid11306728">{{cite journal | author = King PD, Perry MC | title = Hepatotoxicity of chemotherapy | journal = The Oncologist | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 162–76 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11306728 | doi = 10.1634/theoncologist.6-2-162 }}</ref>

[[Nephrotoxicity]] (kidney damage) can be caused by [[tumor lysis syndrome]] and also due direct effects of drug clearance by the kidneys.

=== Other side-effects ===
Less common side-effects include red skin ([[erythema]]), dry skin, damaged fingernails, a dry mouth ([[xerostomia]]), [[Water retention (medicine)|water retention]], and [[sexual impotence]]. Some medications can trigger [[allergic]] or [[pseudoallergic]] reactions.

Specific chemotherapeutic agents are associated with organ-specific toxicities, including [[cardiovascular disease]] (e.g., [[doxorubicin]]), [[interstitial lung disease]] (e.g., [[bleomycin]]) and occasionally [[secondary neoplasm]] (e.g., [[MOPP (medicine)|MOPP]] therapy for Hodgkin's disease).

== Limitations ==
Chemotherapy does not always work, and even when it is useful, it may not completely destroy the cancer. Patients frequently fail to understand its limitations. In one study of patients who had been newly diagnosed with incurable, [[Stage-4 cancer|stage 4 cancer]], more than two-thirds of patients with lung cancer and more than four-fifths of patients with colorectal cancer still believed that chemotherapy was likely to cure their cancer.<ref name=Weeks>{{cite journal | author = Weeks JC, Catalano PJ, Cronin A, Finkelman MD, Mack JW, Keating NL, Schrag D | title = Patients' expectations about effects of chemotherapy for advanced cancer | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 367 | issue = 17 | pages = 1616–25 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 23094723 | pmc = 3613151 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1204410 }}</ref>

The [[blood–brain barrier]] poses a difficult obstacle to pass to deliver chemotherapy to the [[brain]]. This is because the brain has an extensive system in place to protect it from harmful chemicals. Drug transporters can pump out drugs from the brain and brain's blood vessel cells into the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] and blood circulation. These transporters pump out most chemotherapy drugs, which reduces their efficacy for treatment of brain tumors. Only small [[lipophilic]] [[alkylating agents]] such as [[lomustine]] or [[temozolomide]] are able to cross this blood–brain barrier.<ref name="pmid17363519">{{cite journal | author = Deeken JF, Löscher W | title = The blood-brain barrier and cancer: transporters, treatment, and Trojan horses | journal = Clinical Cancer Research | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 1663–74 | date = Mar 2007 | pmid = 17363519 | doi = 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-2854 }}</ref><ref name="pmid10794805">{{cite journal | author = Agarwala SS, Kirkwood JM | title = Temozolomide, a novel alkylating agent with activity in the central nervous system, may improve the treatment of advanced metastatic melanoma | journal = The Oncologist | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 144–51 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10794805 | doi = 10.1634/theoncologist.5-2-144 }}</ref><ref name="pmid17538177">{{cite journal | author = Gerstner ER, Fine RL | title = Increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier to chemotherapy in metastatic brain tumors: establishing a treatment paradigm | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 25 | issue = 16 | pages = 2306–12 | date = Jun 2007 | pmid = 17538177 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2006.10.0677 }}</ref>

[[Blood vessel]]s in tumors are very different from those seen in normal tissues. As a tumor grows, tumor cells furthest away from the blood vessels become low in oxygen ([[Tumor hypoxia|hypoxic]]). To counteract this they then signal for new blood vessels to grow. The newly formed tumor vasculature is poorly formed and does not deliver an adequate blood supply to all areas of the tumor. This leads to issues with drug delivery because many drugs will be delivered to the tumor by the [[circulatory system]].<ref name="pmid16862189">{{cite journal | author = Minchinton AI, Tannock IF | title = Drug penetration in solid tumours | journal = Nature Reviews.

== Resistance ==

[[Drug resistance|Resistance]] is a major cause of treatment failure in chemotherapeutic drugs. There are a few possible causes of resistance in cancer, one of which is the presence of small pumps on the surface of cancer cells that actively move chemotherapy from inside the cell to the outside. Cancer cells produce high amounts of these pumps, known as [[p-glycoprotein]], in order to protect themselves from chemotherapeutics. Research on [[p-glycoprotein]] and other such chemotherapy efflux pumps is currently ongoing. Medications to inhibit the function of [[p-glycoprotein]] are undergoing investigation, but due to toxicities and interactions with anti-cancer drugs their development has been difficult.<ref name="pmid12591977">{{cite journal | author = Goldman B | title = Multidrug resistance: can new drugs help chemotherapy score against cancer? | journal = Journal of the National Cancer Institute | volume = 95 | issue = 4 | pages = 255–7 | date = Feb 2003 | pmid = 12591977 | doi = 10.1093/jnci/95.4.255 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | name-list-format = vanc |last=E. Crowley, CA. McDevitt, R. Callaghan|title=Multidrug Resistance in Cancer. Generating Inhibitors of P-Glycoprotein: Where to, Now?|year=2009|publisher=Springer Protocols|pages=405–432}}</ref> Another mechanism of resistance is [[gene duplication|gene amplification]], a process in which multiple copies of a gene are produced by cancer cells. This overcomes the effect of drugs that reduce the expression of genes involved in replication. With more copies of the gene, the drug can not prevent all expression of the gene and therefore the cell can restore its proliferative ability. Cancer cells can also cause defects in the cellular pathways of [[apoptosis]] (programmed cell death). As most chemotherapy drugs kill cancer cells in this manner, defective apoptosis allows survival of these cells, making them resistant. Many chemotherapy drugs also cause DNA damage, which can be repaired by [[enzyme]]s in the cell that carry out [[DNA repair]]. Upregulation of these genes can overcome the DNA damage and prevent the induction of apoptosis. Mutations in genes that produce drug target proteins, such as [[tubulin]], can occur which prevent the drugs from binding to the protein, leading to resistance to these types of drugs.<ref name="pmid16103712">{{cite journal | author = Luqmani YA | title = Mechanisms of drug resistance in cancer chemotherapy | journal = Medical Principles and Practice | volume = 14 Suppl 1 | issue =  | pages = 35–48 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16103712 | doi = 10.1159/000086183 }}</ref>

== Cytotoxics and targeted therapies ==

[[Targeted therapy|Targeted therapies]] are a relatively new class of cancer drugs that can overcome many of the issues seen with the use of cytotoxics. They are divided into two groups: small molecule and antibodies. The massive toxicity seen with the use of cytotoxics is due to the lack of cell specificity of the drugs. They will kill any rapidly dividing cell, tumor or normal. Targeted therapies are designed to affect cellular proteins or processes that are utilised by the cancer cells. This allows a high dose to cancer tissues with a relatively low dose to other tissues. As different proteins are utilised by different cancer types, the targeted therapy drugs are used on a cancer type specific, or even on a patient specific basis. Although the [[adverse effects|side effects]] are often less severe than that seen of cytotoxic chemotherapeutics, life-threatening effects can occur. Initially, the targeted therapeutics were supposed to be solely selective for one protein. Now it is clear that there is often a range of protein targets that the drug can bind. An example target for targeted therapy is the protein produced by the [[Philadelphia chromosome]], a genetic lesion found commonly in [[chronic myelomonocytic leukemia]]. This fusion protein has enzyme activity that can be inhibited by [[imatinib]], a [[small molecule]] drug.<ref name="pmid18297955">{{cite journal | author = Gerber DE | title = Targeted therapies: a new generation of cancer treatments | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 77 | issue = 3 | pages = 311–9 | date = Feb 2008 | pmid = 18297955 | doi =  }}</ref><ref name="pmid12360278">{{cite journal | author = Allen TM | title = Ligand-targeted therapeutics in anticancer therapy | journal = Nature Reviews.

In the broad sense, most chemotherapeutic drugs work by impairing [[mitosis]] ([[cell division]]), effectively targeting [[fast-dividing cells]]. As these drugs cause damage to cells, they are termed ''cytotoxic''. They prevent mitosis by various mechanisms including damaging DNA and inhibition of the cellular machinery involved in cell division.<ref name="pmid14508075">{{cite journal | author = Malhotra V, Perry MC | title = Classical chemotherapy: mechanisms, toxicities and the therapeutic window | journal = Cancer Biology & Therapy | volume = 2 | issue = 4 Suppl 1 | pages = S2–4 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14508075 | doi=10.4161/cbt.199}}</ref><ref name="pmid19651324">{{cite journal | author = Kehe K, Balszuweit F, Steinritz D, Thiermann H | title = Molecular toxicology of sulfur mustard-induced cutaneous inflammation and blistering | journal = Toxicology | volume = 263 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–9 | date = Sep 2009 | pmid = 19651324 | doi = 10.1016/j.tox.2009.01.019 }}</ref> One theory as to why these drugs kill cancer cells is that they induce a programmed form of cell death known as [[apoptosis]].<ref name="pmid10928287">{{cite journal | author = Makin G, Hickman JA | title = Apoptosis and cancer chemotherapy | journal = Cell and Tissue Research | volume = 301 | issue = 1 | pages = 143–52 | date = Jul 2000 | pmid = 10928287 | doi = 10.1007/s004419900160 | bibcode = 1994RSPTB.345..319H }}</ref>

As chemotherapy affects cell division, tumors with high [[proliferative index|growth rates]] (such as [[acute myelogenous leukemia]] and the aggressive [[lymphoma]]s, including [[Hodgkin's disease]]) are more sensitive to chemotherapy, as a larger proportion of the targeted cells are undergoing [[cell division]] at any time.  Malignancies with slower growth rates, such as [[Indolent condition|indolent]] lymphomas, tend to respond to chemotherapy much more modestly.<ref name=Corrie>{{cite journal|last=Corrie PG|title=Cytotoxic chemotherapy: clinical aspects|journal=Medicine|year=2008|volume=36|issue=1|pages=24–28|doi=10.1016/j.mpmed.2007.10.012|first1=Pippa G.}}</ref> [[Tumour heterogeneity|Heterogeneic tumours]] may also display varying sensitivities to chemotherapy agents, depending on the subclonal populations within the tumor.

Chemotherapy drugs are also used in [[conditioning regimen]]s prior to bone marow transplant ([[hematopoietic stem cell transplant]]). Conditioning regimens are used to suppress the recipient's immune system in order to allow a transplant to engraft. Cyclophosphamide is a common cytotoxic drug used in this manner, and is often used in conjunction with [[total body irradiation]]. Chemotherapeutic drugs may be used at high doses to permanently remove the recipient's bone marrow cells (myeloablative conditioning) or at lower doses that will prevent permanent bone marrow loss (non-myeloablative and reduced intensity conditioning).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bacigalupo A, Ballen K, Rizzo D, Giralt S, Lazarus H, Ho V, Apperley J, Slavin S, Pasquini M, Sandmaier BM, Barrett J, Blaise D, Lowski R, Horowitz M | title = Defining the intensity of conditioning regimens: working definitions | journal = Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation | volume = 15 | issue = 12 | pages = 1628–33 | date = Dec 2009 | pmid = 19896087 | pmc = 2861656 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.07.004 }}</ref> When used in non-cancer setting, the treatment is still called Chemotherapy, and is often done in the same treatment center as cancer patients.

== Occupational precautions ==
Healthcare workers exposed to antineoplastic agents take precautions to keep their exposure to a minimum. There is a limitation in cytotoxics dissolution in Australia and the United States to 20 dissolutions per pharmacist/nurse,{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} since pharmacists who prepare these drugs or nurses who may prepare or administer them are the two occupational groups with the highest potential exposure to antineoplastic agents. In addition, physicians and operating room personnel may also be exposed through the treatment of patients. Hospital staff, such as shipping and receiving personnel, custodial workers, laundry workers, and waste handlers, all have potential exposure to these drugs during the course of their work. The increased use of antineoplastic agents in veterinary oncology also puts these workers at risk for exposure to these drugs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/antineoplastic/|title=NIOSH Occupational Exposure to Antineoplastic Agents |accessdate=10 October 2007 |publisher=United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/738076|title = Hazardous Drugs in Healthcare|date = March 7, 2011|accessdate = |website = NIOSH: Workplace Safety and Health|publisher = Medscape & NIOSH|last = Connor|first = Thomas H.}}</ref> Routes of entry into the worker's body are skin absorption, [[inhalation]], and [[ingestion]] via hand-to-mouth.<ref name=":0" /> The long-term effects of exposure include [[chromosomal abnormality|chromosomal abnormalities]] and [[infertility]].<ref name="isbn0-443-07101-2 2">Wood, p. 38.</ref>

{{Main|History of cancer chemotherapy}}
[[File:Sidney Farber nci-vol-1926-300.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Sidney Farber]] is regarded as the father of modern chemotherapy.]]
The first use of drugs to treat cancer was in the early 20th century, although it was not originally intended for that purpose. [[Mustard gas]] was used as a [[chemical warfare]] agent during [[World War I]] and was discovered to be a potent suppressor of [[hematopoiesis]] (blood production).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Krumbhaar EB |title=Role of the blood and the bone marrow in certain forms of gas poisoning |journal=JAMA |volume=72 |pages=39–41 |year=1919 |doi=10.1001/jama.1919.26110010018009f }}</ref> A similar family of compounds known as [[nitrogen mustards]] were studied further during [[World War II]] at the [[Yale School of Medicine]].<ref name="Fenn">{{cite journal | author = Fenn JE, Udelsman R | title = First use of intravenous chemotherapy cancer treatment: rectifying the record | journal = Journal of the American College of Surgeons | volume = 212 | issue = 3 | pages = 413–417 | date = Mar 2011 | pmid = 21247779 | doi = 10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2010.10.018 }}</ref> It was reasoned that an agent that damaged the rapidly growing white blood cells might have a similar effect on cancer.<ref name="Fenn" /> Therefore, in December 1942, several patients with advanced [[lymphomas]] (cancers of the lymphatic system and lymph nodes) were given the drug by vein, rather than by breathing the irritating gas.<ref name="Fenn" /> Their improvement, although temporary, was remarkable.<ref>{{cite journal |author1 =Goodman LS |author1-link=Louis S.

The survivors were later found to have very low white blood cell counts.<ref>Faguet, p. 71</ref> After WWII was over and the reports declassified, the experiences converged and led researchers to look for other substances that might have similar effects against cancer. The first chemotherapy drug to be developed from this line of research was [[mustine]]. Since then, many other drugs have been developed to treat cancer, and drug development has exploded into a multibillion-dollar industry, although the principles and limitations of chemotherapy discovered by the early researchers still apply.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Joensuu H | title = Systemic chemotherapy for cancer: from weapon to treatment | journal = The Lancet.

=== The term ''chemotherapy'' ===

The word ''chemotherapy'' without a modifier usually refers to cancer treatment, but its historical meaning was broader. The term was coined in the early 1900s by [[Paul Ehrlich]] as meaning any use of chemicals to treat any disease (''[[wikt:chemo-|chemo]]-'' + ''[[wikt:-therapy|-therapy]]''), such as the use of [[antibiotic]]s (''antibacterial chemotherapy'').<ref name="DeVita">{{cite journal | author = DeVita VT, Chu E | title = A history of cancer chemotherapy | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 68 | issue = 21 | pages = 8643–53 | date = Nov 2008 | pmid = 18974103 | doi = 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-6611 }}</ref>  Ehrlich was not optimistic that effective chemotherapy drugs would be found for the treatment of cancer.<ref name="DeVita" />  The first modern chemotherapeutic agent was [[arsphenamine]], an arsenic compound discovered in 1907 and used to treat [[syphilis]].<ref name="pmid19868743">{{cite journal | author = Nichols HJ, Walker JE | title = EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE PROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT OF SYPHILIS | journal = The Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 525–42 | date = Mar 1923 | pmid = 19868743 | pmc = 2128372 | doi = 10.1084/jem.37.4.525 }}</ref> This was later followed by [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamides]] (sulfa drugs) and [[penicillin]]. In today's [[usage]], the [[word sense|sense]] "any treatment of disease with drugs" is often expressed with the word ''[[pharmacotherapy]]''.

{{Main|Experimental cancer treatments}}

=== Targeted therapies ===
Specially targeted delivery vehicles aim to increase effective levels of chemotherapy for tumor cells while reducing effective levels for other cells. This should result in an increased tumor kill and/or reduced toxicity.<ref name="pmid21501554">{{cite journal | author = Chidambaram M, Manavalan R, Kathiresan K | title = Nanotherapeutics to overcome conventional cancer chemotherapy limitations | journal = Journal of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 67–77 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21501554 | doi =  }}</ref>

==== Antibody-drug conjugates ====

[[Antibody-drug conjugate]]s (ADCs) comprise an [[antibody]], drug and a linker between them. The antibody will be targeted at a preferentially expressed protein in the tumour cells (known as a [[tumor antigen]]) or on cells that the tumor can utilise, such as blood vessel [[endothelial cells]]. They bind to the tumor antigen and are internalised, where the linker releases the drug into the cell. These specially targeted delivery vehicles vary in their stability, selectivity, and choice of target, but, in essence, they all aim to increase the maximum effective dose that can be delivered to the tumor cells.<ref name="pmid22003066">{{cite journal | author = Teicher BA, Chari RV | title = Antibody conjugate therapeutics: challenges and potential | journal = Clinical Cancer Research | volume = 17 | issue = 20 | pages = 6389–97 | date = Oct 2011 | pmid = 22003066 | doi = 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-1417 }}</ref> Reduced systemic toxicity means that they can also be used in sicker patients, and that they can carry new chemotherapeutic agents that would have been far too toxic to deliver via traditional systemic approaches.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The first approved drug of this type was [[gemtuzumab ozogamicin]] (Mylotarg), released by [[Wyeth]] (now [[Pfizer]]). The drug was approved to treat [[acute myeloid leukemia]], but has now been withdrawn from the market because the drug did not meet efficacy targets in further clinical trials.<ref name="pmid11673694">{{cite journal | author = Sievers EL, Linenberger M | title = Mylotarg: antibody-targeted chemotherapy comes of age | journal = Current Opinion in Oncology | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 522–7 | date = Nov 2001 | pmid = 11673694 | doi = 10.1097/00001622-200111000-00016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=FDA|title=Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin): Market Withdrawal|url=http://www.fda.gov/safety/medwatch/safetyinformation/safetyalertsforhumanmedicalproducts/ucm216458.htm|accessdate=18 August 2013}}</ref> Two other drugs, [[trastuzumab emtansine]] and [[brentuximab vedotin]], are both in late clinical trials, and the latter has been granted accelerated approval for the treatment of [[refractory]] [[Hodgkins lymphoma]] and systemic [[anaplastic large cell lymphoma]].<ref name="pmid22003066" />

==== Nanoparticles ====

[[Nanoparticles]] are 1-1000 [[nanometer]] (nm) sized particles that can promote tumor selectivity and aid in delivering low-[[solubility]] drugs. Nanoparticles can be targeted passively or actively. Passive targeting exploits the difference between tumor blood vessels and normal blood vessels. Blood vessels in tumors are "leaky" because they have gaps from 200-2000&nbsp;nm, which allow nanoparticles to escape into the tumor. Active targeting uses biological molecules ([[antibodies]], [[protein]]s, [[DNA]] and [[receptor ligand]]s) to preferentially target the nanoparticles to the tumor cells. There are many types of nanoparticle delivery systems, such as [[mesoporous silica|silica]], [[polymer]]s, [[liposome]]s and magnetic particles. Nanoparticles made of magnetic material can also be used to concentrate agents at tumor sites using an externally applied magnetic field.<ref name="pmid21501554" />  They have emerged as a useful vehicle for poorly soluble agents such as [[paclitaxel]].<ref name="pmid19554862">{{cite journal | author = Vines T, Faunce T | title = Assessing the safety and cost-effectiveness of early nanodrugs | journal = Journal of Law and Medicine | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 822–45 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19554862 | doi =  }}</ref>

=== Electrochemotherapy ===
{{Main|Electrochemotherapy}}

Electrochemotherapy is the combined treatment in which injection of a chemotherapeutic drug is followed by application of high-voltage electric pulses locally to the tumor. The treatment enables the chemotherapeutic drugs, which otherwise cannot or hardly go through the membrane of cells (such as bleomycin and cisplatin), to enter the cancer cells. Hence, greater effectiveness of antitumor treatment is achieved.

Clinical electrochemotherapy has been successfully used for treatment of cutaneous and subcutaneous tumors irrespective of their histological origin.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Heller R, Gilbert R, Jaroszeski MJ | title = Clinical applications of electrochemotherapy | journal = Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 119–129 | date = Jan 1999 | pmid = 10837693 | doi = 10.1016/S0169-409X(98)00067-2 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Larkin JO, Collins CG, Aarons S, Tangney M, Whelan M, O'Reily S, Breathnach O, Soden DM, O'Sullivan GC | title = Electrochemotherapy: aspects of preclinical development and early clinical experience | journal = Annals of Surgery | volume = 245 | issue = 3 | pages = 469–479 | date = Mar 2007 | pmid = 17435555 | pmc = 1877027 | doi = 10.1097/01.sla.0000250419.36053.33 }}</ref><ref name="Marty M, Sersa G, Garbay JR, Gehl J, Collins CG, Snoj M, Billard V, Geertsen PF, Larkin JO, Miklavcic D, Pavlovic I, Paulin-Kosir SM, Cemazar M, Morsli N, Soden DM, Rudolf Z, Robert C, O'Sullivan GC, Mir LM. 2006">{{cite journal |author=Marty M, Sersa G, Garbay JR, Gehl J, Collins CG, Snoj M, Billard V, Geertsen PF, Larkin JO, Miklavcic D, Pavlovic I, Paulin-Kosir SM, Cemazar M, Morsli N, Soden DM, Rudolf Z, Robert C, O'Sullivan GC, Mir LM |title=Electrochemotherapy – An easy, highly effective and safe treatment of cutaneous and subcutaneous metastases |pages=3–13 |journal=Eur J Cancer Suppl |volume=4 |issue=11 |year=2006|doi=10.1016/j.ejcsup.2006.08.002 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Möller MG, Salwa S, Soden DM, O'Sullivan GC | title = Electrochemotherapy as an adjunct or alternative to other treatments for unresectable or in-transit melanoma | journal = Expert Review of Anticancer Therapy | volume = 9 | issue = 11 | pages = 1611–1630 | date = Nov 2009 | pmid = 19895245 | doi = 10.1586/era.09.129 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Testori A, Tosti G, Martinoli C, Spadola G, Cataldo F, Verrecchia F, Baldini F, Mosconi M, Soteldo J, Tedeschi I, Passoni C, Pari C, Di Pietro A, Ferrucci PF | title = Electrochemotherapy for cutaneous and subcutaneous tumor lesions: a novel therapeutic approach | journal = Dermatologic Therapy | volume = 23 | issue = 6 | pages = 651–661 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21054709 | doi = 10.1111/j.1529-8019.2010.01370.x }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Hampton T | title = Electric pulses help with chemotherapy, may open new paths for other agents | journal = Jama | volume = 305 | issue = 6 | pages = 549–551 | date = Feb 2011 | pmid = 21304073 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2011.92 }}</ref> The method has been reported as safe, simple and highly effective in all reports on clinical use of electrochemotherapy.

=== Hyperthermia therapy ===
[[Hyperthermia therapy]] is heat treatment for cancer that can be a powerful tool when used in combination with chemotherapy (thermochemotherapy) or radiation for the control of a variety of cancers.  The heat can be applied locally to the tumor site, which will dilate blood vessels to the tumor, allowing more chemotherapeutic medication to enter the tumor.  Additionally, the bi-lipid layer of the tumor cell membrane will become more porous, further allowing more of the chemotherapeutic medicine to enter the tumor cell.

Hyperthermia has also been shown to help prevent or reverse "chemo-resistance."  Chemotherapy resistance sometimes develops over time as the tumors adapt and can overcome the toxicity of the chemo medication. "Overcoming chemoresistance has been extensively studied within the past, especially using CDDP-resistant cells. In regard to the potential benefit that drug-resistant cells can be recruited for effective therapy by combining chemotherapy with hyperthermia, it was important to show that chemoresistance against several anticancer drugs (e.g. mitomycin C, anthracyclines, BCNU, melphalan) including CDDP could be reversed at least partially by the addition of heat.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Issels|first=R.|title=Hyperthermia Combined with Chemotherapy – Biological Rationale, Clinical Application, and Treatment Results|journal=Onkologie|year=1999|volume=22|issue=5|pages=374–381|doi=10.1159/000026986}}</ref>
