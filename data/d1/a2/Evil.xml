Misunderstanding God's reality leads to incorrect choices, which are termed evil. This has led to the rejection of any separate power being the source of evil, or of God as being the source of evil; instead, the appearance of evil is the result of a mistaken concept of good. Christian Scientists argue that even the most<space/><italics>evil</italics><space/>person does not pursue evil for its own sake, but from the mistaken viewpoint that he or she will achieve some kind of good thereby.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Zoroastrianism</heading><paragraph>In the originally<space/><link><target>Iranian religions</target><part>Persian</part></link><space/>religion of<space/><link><target>Zoroastrianism</target></link>, the world is a battle ground between the god<space/><link><target>Ahura Mazda</target></link><space/>(also called<space/><link><target>Ormazd</target></link>) and the malignant spirit<space/><link><target>Angra Mainyu</target></link><space/>(also called<space/><link><target>Ahriman</target></link>).

Universalists consider evil independent of culture, and wholly related to acts or intents. Thus, while the ideological leaders of Nazism and the Hutu Interhamwe accepted (and considered it moral) to commit genocide, the belief in genocide as<space/><italics>fundamentally</italics><space/>or<space/><italics>universally</italics><space/>evil holds that those who instigated this genocide are actually evil.<template><target>Synthesis-inline</target><arg name="date">November 2010</arg></template><space/>Other universalists might argue that although the commission of an evil act is always evil, those who perpetrate may not be wholly evil or wholly good entities. To say that someone who has stolen a candy bar, for instance, becomes wholly evil is a rather untenable position. However, universalists might also argue that a person can choose a decidedly evil or a decidedly good life career, and genocidal dictatorship plainly falls on the side of the former.</paragraph><paragraph>Views on the nature of evil tend to fall into one of four opposed camps:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Moral absolutism</target></link><space/>holds that good and evil are fixed concepts established by a<space/><link><target>deity</target></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>deities</target></link>, nature, morality, common sense, or some other source.</listitem><listitem><link><target>Amoralism</target></link><space/>claims that good and evil are meaningless, that there is no moral ingredient in nature.</listitem><listitem><link><target>Moral relativism</target></link><space/>holds that standards of good and evil are only products of local culture, custom, or prejudice.</listitem><listitem><link><target>Moral universalism</target></link><space/>is the attempt to find a compromise between the absolutist sense of morality, and the relativist view; universalism claims that morality is only flexible to a degree, and that what is truly good or evil can be determined by examining what is commonly considered to be evil amongst all humans.</listitem></list><paragraph><link><target>Plato</target></link><space/>wrote that there are relatively few ways to do good, but there are countless ways to do evil, which can therefore have a much greater impact on our lives, and the lives of other beings capable of suffering.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="title">The Sources of Evil According to Plato<space/></arg><arg name="first">Harold<space/></arg><arg name="last">Cherniss<space/></arg><arg name="authorlink">Harold F.
