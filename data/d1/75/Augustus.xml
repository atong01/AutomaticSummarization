Traditionally, proconsuls, or Roman province governors, lost their proconsular &quot;imperium&quot; when they crossed the Pomerium - the sacred boundary of Rome - and entered the city. In these situations, Augustus would have power as part of his tribunician authority but his constitutional imperium within the Pomerium would be less than that of a serving consul. That would mean that when he was in the city he may not be the constitutional magistrate with the most authority. Thanks to his prestige, or<space/><italics>auctoritas</italics>, his wishes would usually be obeyed, but there may be some difficulty. To fill this power vacuum, the Senate voted that Augustus's imperium proconsulare maius (superior proconsular power) should not lapse when he was inside the city walls and thus, all armed forces in the city, formerly under the control of the urban praetors and consuls, were now under the sole authority of Augustus.<extension extension_name='ref' name="eck 60">Eck (2003), 60.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>In addition, after this time the credit for each subsequent Roman military victory was given to Augustus because the majority of Rome's armies were stationed in imperial provinces commanded by Augustus through the<space/><link><target>legatus</target></link><space/>who were deputies of the princeps in the provinces.<extension extension_name='ref' name="eck 61"></extension><space/>Moreover, if a battle was fought in a Senatorial province Augustus' proconsular imperium maius allowed him to take command and, or credit for any major military victory.

Augustus' own experience, his patience, his tact, and his political acumen also played their parts. He directed the future of the Empire down many lasting paths, from the existence of a standing professional army stationed at or near the frontiers, to the dynastic principle so often employed in the imperial succession, to the embellishment of the capital at the emperor's expense. Augustus' ultimate legacy was the peace and prosperity the Empire enjoyed for the next two centuries under the system he initiated. His memory was enshrined in the political ethos of the Imperial age as a paradigm of the good emperor. Every Emperor of Rome adopted his name, Caesar Augustus, which gradually lost its character as a name and eventually became a title.<extension extension_name='ref' name="eck 124"></extension><space/>The Augustan era poets Virgil and Horace praised Augustus as a defender of Rome, an upholder of moral justice, and an individual who bore the brunt of responsibility in maintaining the empire.<extension extension_name='ref' name="kelsall 120">Kelsall (1976), 120.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>However, for his rule of Rome and establishing the principate, Augustus has also been subjected to criticism throughout the ages.

One opinion was as follows. Filial duty and a national emergency, in which there was no place for law-abiding conduct, had driven him to civil war—and this can neither be initiated nor maintained by decent methods. He had made many concessions to Anthony and to Lepidus for the sake of vengeance on his father's murderers. When Lepidus grew old and lazy, and Anthony's self-indulgence got the better of him, the only possible cure for the distracted country had been government by one man. However, Augustus had put the state in order not by making himself king or dictator, but by creating the Principate. The Empire's frontiers were on the ocean, or distant rivers. Armies, provinces, fleets, the whole system was interrelated. Roman citizens were protected by the law. Provincials were decently treated. Rome itself had been lavishly beautified. Force had been sparingly used—merely to preserve peace for the majority.<ref>Tacitus, The Annals, I 9</ref></arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>According to the second opposing opinion:<template><target>quote</target><arg>filial duty and national crisis had been merely pretexts.

The story of his career shows that Augustus was indeed ruthless, cruel, and ambitious for himself. This was only in part a personal trait, for upper-class Romans were educated to compete with one another and to excel. However, he combined an overriding concern for his personal interests with a deep-seated patriotism, based on a nostalgia of Rome's antique virtues. In his capacity as ''princeps'', selfishness and selflessness coexisted in his mind. While fighting for dominance, he paid little attention to legality or to the normal civilities of political life. He was devious, untrustworthy, and bloodthirsty. But once he had established his authority, he governed efficiently and justly, generally allowed freedom of speech, and promoted the rule of law. He was immensely hardworking and tried as hard as any [[Democracy in Ancient Rome|democratic]] parliamentarian to treat his senatorial colleagues with respect and sensitivity.
