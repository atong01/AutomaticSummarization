==Life and work==

===Early life===
Born to businessman Jacques Canetti and Mathilde ''née'' Arditti in [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Ruse]], a city on the [[Danube]] in [[Bulgaria]], Canetti was the eldest of three sons.<ref name="litenc">{{cite journal|last=Lorenz|first=Dagmar C. G.|date=17 April 2004 |title=Elias Canetti|journal=Literary Encyclopedia|publisher=The Literary Dictionary Company Limited|issn=1747-678X|url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=725|accessdate=2009-10-13}}</ref> His ancestors were [[Sephardi Jews]] who had been expelled from [[Spain]] in 1492. His paternal ancestors had settled in Ruse from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Edirne|Adrianople]].<ref name="litenc"/> The original family name was ''Cañete'', named after [[Cañete, Cuenca]], a village in [[Spain]].

In Ruse, Canetti's father and grandfather were successful merchants who operated out of a commercial building, which they had built in 1898.<ref name="gesellschaft">{{cite web|url=http://www.eliascanetti.org/73.0.html?&L=3|title=The Canetti House&nbsp;– a forum for alternative culture|publisher=Internationale Elias Canetti Gesellschaft|accessdate=2009-10-13}}</ref> Canetti's mother descended from one of the oldest Sephardi families in Bulgaria, Arditti, who were among the founders of the Ruse Jewish colony in the late 18th century. The Ardittis can be traced back to the 14th century, when they were court physicians and astronomers to the [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragonese]] royal court of [[Alfonso IV of Aragon|Alfonso IV]] and [[Peter IV of Aragon|Pedro IV]]. Before settling in Ruse, they had lived in [[Livorno]] in the 17th century.<ref name="ohrenzeuge">{{cite book|last=Angelova|first=Penka|title=Elias Canetti: Der Ohrenzeuge des Jahrhunderts|publisher=Internationale Elias-Canetti-Gesellschaft Rousse|year=2006|chapter=Die Geburtsstadt von Elias Canetti|url=http://www.archives.government.bg/tda/docs/canetti_izlojba_ruse.pdf|language=German}}</ref>
[[File:Elias Canettis fødested.JPG|right|thumb|Elias Canetti's native house in [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Ruse]], [[Bulgaria]]]]

Canetti spent his childhood years, from 1905 to 1911, in Ruse until the family moved to Manchester, England, where Canetti's father joined a business established by his wife's brothers. In 1912, his father died suddenly, and his mother moved with their children first to [[Lausanne]], then [[Vienna]] in the same year. They lived in Vienna from the time Canetti was aged seven onwards. His mother insisted that he speak German, and taught it to him. By this time Canetti already spoke [[Judezmo|Ladino]] (his native language), [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], English and some French; the latter two he studied in the one year they were in Britain. Subsequently the family moved first (from 1916 to 1921) to [[Zürich]] and then (until 1924) to [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]], where Canetti graduated from high school.

Canetti went back to Vienna in 1924 in order to study chemistry. However, his primary interests during his years in Vienna became philosophy and literature. Introduced into the literary circles of [[First Austrian Republic|First-Republic]]-[[Vienna]], he started writing. Politically leaning towards the left, he was present at the [[July Revolt of 1927]] – he came near to the action accidentally, was most impressed by the burning of books (recalled frequently in his writings), and left the place quickly with his bicycle.<ref>Stieg, Gerard, ''Fruits de Feu - l'incendie du Palais du Justice de Vienne en 1927 et ses consequences dans la litterature Autrichienne''.   Université de Rouen (ISBN 9782877750080), 1989.</ref>  He gained a degree in chemistry from the [[University of Vienna]] in 1929, but never worked as a chemist.

===Career===
A highly awarded German language writer, Canetti won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1981, "for writings marked by a broad outlook, a wealth of ideas and artistic power". He is known chiefly for his celebrated trilogy of autobiographical memoirs of his childhood and of pre-Anschluss [[Vienna]] (''Die Gerettete Zunge''; ''Die Fackel im Ohr''; and ''Das Augenspiel''), for his modernist novel ''[[Auto-da-Fé (novel)|Auto-da-Fé]]'' (''Die Blendung''), and for ''[[Crowds and Power]],'' a study of crowd behaviour as it manifests itself in human activities ranging from mob violence to religious congregations.

He died in Zürich in 1994.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/92556/Elias-Canetti ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'' profile]</ref>

==Personal life==
[[File:Canetti Peak.jpg|thumb|right|Canetti Peak, Antarctica, named after Elias Canetti]]

In 1934 he married Veza (Venetiana) Taubner-Calderon (1897–1963) with whom he had a dynamic relationship. She acted as his muse and devoted literary  assistant. Canetti however remained open to relationships with other women.

In 1938, after the [[Anschluss]] uniting Austria with Germany, Canetti moved to [[London]] where he became closely involved with the painter [[Marie-Louise von Motesiczky]], who was to remain a close companion for many years to come. His name has also been linked with that of the author [[Iris Murdoch]] (see [[John Bayley (writer)|John Bayley]]'s ''Iris, A Memoir of Iris Murdoch,'' where there are several references to an author, referred to as "the Dichter", who was a Nobel Laureate and whose works included ''Die Blendung'' [English title ''[[Auto-da-Fé (novel)|Auto-da-Fé]]'']).

Canetti's wife died in 1963. His second marriage was to Hera Buschor (1933–1988), with whom he had a daughter, Johanna, in 1972.

Canetti's brother [[Jacques Canetti|Jacques]] settled in Paris, where he championed a revival of French [[chanson]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.lemonde.fr/archives/article/1997/06/10/jacques-canetti-le-decouvreur-de-brassens-et-de-brel_3787006_1819218.html | title=Jacques Canetti, Le découvreur de Brassens et de Brel | work=Le Monde | author=Patrick Labesse | date=1997-06-10 | accessdate=2015-01-22}}</ref>

Despite being a German language writer, Canetti settled and stayed in Britain until the 1970s, receiving British citizenship in 1952. For his last 20 years, however, Canetti mostly lived in [[Zürich]].
