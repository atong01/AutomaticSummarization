The importance of foodcrops over exported<space/><link><target>cash crop</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>is illustrated by the fact that the total production of cassava, the staple food of most Central Africans, ranges between c. 200,000 and 300,000 tons a year, while the production of<space/><link><target>cotton</target></link>, the principal exported cash crop, ranges from c. 25,000 to 45,000 tons a year.</paragraph><paragraph>Foodcrops are not exported in large quantities but they still constitute the principal cash crops of the country because Central Africans derive far more income from the periodic sale of surplus foodcrops than from exported cash crops such as cotton or<space/><link><target>coffee</target></link>. Many rural and urban women also transform some foodcrops into<space/><link><target>Alcoholic beverage</target><part>alcoholic drinks</part></link><space/>such as<space/><link><target>sorghum beer</target></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>Distilled beverage</target><part>hard liquor</part></link><space/>and derive considerable income from the sale of these drinks. Much of the income derived from the sale of foods and alcohol is not &quot;on the books&quot; and thus is not considered in calculating<space/><link><target>per capita income</target></link>, which is one reason why official figures for per capita income are not accurate in the case of the CAR.</paragraph><paragraph>The per capita income of the CAR is often listed as being around $300 a year, said to be one of the lowest in the world, but this figure is based mostly on reported sales of<space/><link><target>export</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and largely ignores the more important but unregistered sale of foods, locally produced alcohol,<space/><link><target>diamond</target><trail>s</trail></link>,<space/><link><target>ivory</target></link>,<space/><link><target>bushmeat</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>traditional medicine</target><trail>s</trail></link>, for example.

Suffering from weak market infrastructure and legal and judicial frameworks, the financial system remains small, undeveloped, and dominated by commercial banks. Because of economic and security concerns, financial institutions, and particularly microfinance institutions (MFIs), have consolidated their business in the capital, Bangui, over the past few years.<extension extension_name='ref' name="MFW4A"><link type='external' href='http://www.mfw4a.org/central-african-republic/car-financial-sector-profile.html'>MFW4A</link></extension></paragraph><paragraph>With less than 1 percent of the total population holding a bank account, access to financial services is extremely limited in the CAR. Microfinance accounts only for 1 percent of the total credit facilities, serving 0.5 percent of the population. Low levels of mobile penetration which stand at 30 percent, a significantly lower percentage than in the rest of the continent dampen the potential expansion of access to financial services through mobile technology.<extension extension_name='ref' name="MFW4A"></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Fishing</heading><paragraph>Fishing is carried on extensively along the rivers, but most of the catch is sold or bartered on the<space/><link><target>Democratic Republic of the Congo</target></link><space/>(DRC) side of the<space/><link><target>Ubangi River</target></link>.

The CARs exploitable forests cover 27 million hectares (68 million acres), or 43% of the total land area. Transportation bottlenecks on rivers and lack of rail connections are serious hindrances to commercial exploitation. Most timber is shipped down the Ubangi and Zaire rivers and then on the Congo railway to the Atlantic.

Diamonds constitute the most important export of the CAR, frequently accounting for 40-55% of export<space/><link><target>revenue</target><trail>s</trail></link>, but an estimated 30-50% of the diamonds produced each year leave the country clandestinely.

Economic mismanagement, poor<space/><link><target>infrastructure</target></link>, a limited<space/><link><target>tax base</target></link>, scarce private investment, and adverse external conditions have led to deficits in both its<space/><link><target>budget</target></link><space/>and external<space/><link><target>trade</target></link>. Its debt burden is considerable, and the country has seen a decline in per capita<space/><link><target>gross national product</target></link><space/>over the last 40 years.</paragraph><paragraph>Important constraints to economic development include the CAR's landlocked position, a poor transportation system, a largely unskilled work force, and a legacy of misdirected<space/><link><target>macroeconomics</target><part>macroeconomic</part></link><space/>policies. The 50%<space/><link><target>devaluation</target></link><space/>of the currencies of 14 Francophone African nations on 12 January 1994 had mixed effects on the CAR's economy. Diamond, timber, coffee, and cotton exports increased, leading an estimated rise of GDP of 70% in 1994 and nearly 50% in 1995.</paragraph><paragraph>Military rebellions and social unrest in 1996 were accompanied by widespread destruction of property and a drop in GDP of 2%. Ongoing violence between the government and rebel military groups over pay issues, living conditions, and political representation has destroyed many businesses in the capital and reduced tax revenues for the government.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">October 2010</arg><arg name="reason">Needed for the whole paragraph.</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>International Monetary Fund</target></link><space/>(IMF) approved an Extended Structure Adjustment Facility in 1998.

Structural adjustment programs with the<space/><link><target>World Bank</target></link><space/>and IMF and interest-free credits to support investments in the<space/><link><target>agriculture</target></link>,<space/><link><target>livestock</target></link>, and transportation sectors have had limited impact. The World Bank and IMF are now encouraging the government to concentrate exclusively on implementing much-needed economic reforms to jump-start the economy and defining its fundamental priorities with the aim of alleviating poverty. As a result, many of the state-owned business entities have been privatized and limited efforts have been made to standardize and simplify labor and investment codes and to address problems of corruption. The Central African Government is currently in the process of adopting new labor and investment codes.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">October 2010</arg><arg name="reason">Needed for the whole paragraph.</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>Exchange Rates</heading><paragraph><template><target>Exchange Rate</target><arg>XAF</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Central African Republic</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Economy of Africa</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Mining industry of the Central African Republic</target></link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>Reflist</target></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>External links</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><template><target>dmoz</target><arg>Regional/Africa/Central_African_Republic/Business_and_Economy/Economic_Development</arg></template></listitem></list><paragraph><template><target>Central African Republic topics</target></template><template><target>Africa in topic</target><arg>Economy of</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>DEFAULTSORT:Economy of the Central African Republic</target></template><link><target>Category:Economy of the Central African Republic</target><part></part></link><link><target>Category:World Trade Organization member economies</target><part>Central African Republic</part></link><link><target>Category:African Union member economies</target><part>Central African Republic</part></link></paragraph></article>
