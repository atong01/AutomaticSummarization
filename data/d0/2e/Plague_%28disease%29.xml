The natural foci of plague are situated in a broad belt in the tropical and subtropical latitudes and the warmer parts of the temperate latitudes around the globe, between the parallels 55 degrees North and 40 degrees South.<extension extension_name='ref' name="PM"></extension>Contrary to popular belief, rats did not directly start the spread of the bubonic plague. It is mainly a disease in the<space/><link><target>flea</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>(<italics><link><target>Xenopsylla cheopis</target></link></italics>) that infested the rats, making the rats themselves the first victims of the plague. Infection in a human occurs when a person is bitten by a flea that has been infected by biting a rodent that itself has been infected by the bite of a flea carrying the disease. The bacteria multiply inside the flea, sticking together to form a plug that blocks its stomach and causes it to starve. The flea then bites a host and continues to feed, even though it cannot quell its hunger, and consequently the flea vomits blood tainted with the bacteria back into the bite wound. The bubonic plague bacterium then infects a new victim, and the flea eventually dies from starvation. Serious outbreaks of plague are usually started by other disease outbreaks in rodents, or a rise in the rodent population.In 1894, two bacteriologists,<space/><link><target>Alexandre Emile John Yersin</target><part>Alexandre Yersin</part></link><space/>of<space/><link><target>France</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Kitasato Shibasabur</target></link><space/>of<space/><link><target>Japan</target></link>, independently isolated the bacterium in<space/><link><target>Hong Kong</target></link><space/>responsible for the<space/><link><target>Third plague pandemic</target><part>Third Pandemic</part></link>. Though both investigators reported their findings, a series of confusing and contradictory statements by Kitasato eventually led to the acceptance of Yersin as the primary discoverer of the organism. Yersin named it<space/><italics>Pasteurella pestis</italics><space/>in honor of the<space/><link><target>Pasteur Institute</target></link>, where he worked, but in 1967 it was moved to a new genus, renamed<space/><italics><link><target>Yersinia pestis</target></link></italics><space/>in honor of Yersin. Yersin also noted that rats were affected by plague not only during plague epidemics but also often preceding such epidemics in humans, and that plague was regarded by many locals as a disease of rats: villagers in<space/><link><target>China</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>India</target></link><space/>asserted that, when large numbers of rats were found dead, plague outbreaks soon followed.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1898, the French scientist<space/><link><target>Paul-Louis Simond</target></link><space/>(who had also come to<space/><link><target>China</target></link><space/>to battle the Third Pandemic) established the rat-flea<space/><link><target>Vector (epidemiology)</target><part>vector</part></link><space/>that drives the disease. He had noted that persons who became ill did not have to be in close contact with each other to acquire the disease. In<space/><link><target>Yunnan, China</target></link>, inhabitants would flee from their homes as soon as they saw dead rats, and on the island of<space/><link><target>Formosa</target></link><space/>(<link><target>Taiwan</target></link>), residents considered the handling of dead rats heightened the risks of developing plague. These observations led him to suspect that the flea might be an intermediary factor in the transmission of plague, since people acquired plague only if they were in contact with recently dead rats, who had died less than 24 hours before. In a now classic experiment, Simond demonstrated how a healthy rat died of plague, after infected fleas had jumped to it, from a rat which had recently died of the plague.<extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.asnom.org/en/423_peste.html</extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Pathology</heading><heading level='3'>Bubonic plague</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Bubonic plague</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Plague -buboes.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Swollen inguinal lymph glands on a person infected with the bubonic plague.

DIC results in depletion of the body's clotting resources, so that it can no longer control bleeding. Consequently, there is bleeding into the skin and other organs, which can cause red and/or black patchy rash and hemoptysis/hematemesis (coughing up/ vomiting of blood). There are bumps on the skin that look somewhat like insect bites; these are usually red, and sometimes white in the center. Untreated, septicemic plague is usually fatal.

On the other hand, Northeastern Germany, Bohemia, Poland and Hungary are believed to have suffered less, and there are no estimates available for Russia or the Balkans.

Most modern outbreaks of bubonic plague amongst humans have been preceded by a striking, high mortality amongst rats, yet this phenomenon is absent from descriptions of some earlier plagues, especially the Black Death. The buboes, or swellings in the groin, that are especially characteristic of bubonic plague, are a feature of other diseases as well.</paragraph><paragraph>Research done by a team of biologists from the Institute of Pasteur in Paris and Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz in Germany by analyzing the DNA and proteins from plague pits was published in October 2010, reported beyond doubt that all 'the three major plagues' were due to at least two previously unknown strains of<space/><italics>Yersinia pestis</italics><space/>and originated from China. A team of medical geneticists led by Mark Achtman of University College Cork in Ireland reconstructed a family tree of the bacterium and concluded in an online issue of Nature Genetics published on 31 October 2010 that all three of the great waves of plague originated from China.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/01/health/01plague.html?src=me&amp;amp;ref=general'>Europes Plagues Came From China, Study Finds</link></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Plague as a biological weapon</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:World distribution of plague 1998.PNG</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>Worldwide distribution of plague infected animals 1998</part></link>Plague has a long history as a<space/><link><target>biological weapon</target></link>.
