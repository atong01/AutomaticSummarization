In [[computer science]], the '''Earley parser''' is an [[algorithm]] for [[parsing]] [[String (computer science)|strings]] that belong to a given [[context-free language]], though (depending on the variant) it may suffer problems with certain nullable grammars.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kegler|first=Jeffrey|title=What is the Marpa algorithm?|url=http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/2011/11/what-is-the-marpa-algorithm.html|accessdate=20 August 2013}}</ref> The algorithm, named after its inventor, [[Jay Earley]], is a [[chart parser]] that uses [[dynamic programming]]; it is mainly used for parsing in [[computational linguistics]].

Earley parsers are appealing because they can parse all context-free languages{{discuss}}, unlike [[LR parser]]s and [[LL parser]]s, which are more typically used in [[compiler]]s but which can only handle restricted classes of languages.  The Earley parser executes in cubic time in the general case <math>{O}(n^3)</math>, where ''n'' is the length of the parsed string, quadratic time for unambiguous grammars <math>{O}(n^2)</math>, and linear time for almost all [[LR parser|LR(k) grammars]]. It performs particularly well when the rules are written [[left recursion|left-recursively]].

== Earley recogniser ==
The following algorithm describes the Earley recogniser. The recogniser can be easily modified to create a parse tree as it recognises, and in that way can be turned into a parser.

== The algorithm ==
In the following descriptions, α, β, and γ represent any [[string (computer science)|string]] of [[Terminal and nonterminal symbols|terminals/nonterminals]] (including the [[empty string]]), X and Y represent single nonterminals, and ''a'' represents a terminal symbol.

Earley's algorithm is a top-down [[dynamic programming]] algorithm. In the following, we use Earley's dot notation: given a [[Formal grammar#The syntax of grammars|production]] X → αβ, the notation X → α • β represents a condition in which α has already been parsed and β is expected.

Input position 0 is the position prior to input.  Input position ''n'' is the position after accepting the ''n''th token.  (Informally, input positions can be thought of as locations at [[Lexical analysis|token]] boundaries.)  For every input position, the parser generates a ''state set''.  Each state is a [[tuple]] (X → α • β, ''i''), consisting of

* the production currently being matched (X → α β)
* our current position in that production (represented by the dot)
* the position ''i'' in the input at which the matching of this production began: the ''origin position''

(Earley's original algorithm included a look-ahead in the state; later research showed this to have little practical effect on the parsing efficiency, and it has subsequently been dropped from most implementations.)

The state set at input position ''k'' is called S(''k'').  The parser is seeded with S(0) consisting of only the top-level rule.  The parser then repeatedly executes three operations:  ''prediction'', ''scanning'', and ''completion''.

* ''Prediction'':  For every state in S(''k'') of the form (X → α • Y β, ''j'') (where ''j'' is the origin position as above), add (Y → • γ, ''k'') to S(''k'') for every production in the grammar with Y on the left-hand side (Y → γ).
* ''Scanning'': If ''a'' is the next symbol in the input stream, for every state in S(''k'') of the form (X → α • ''a'' β, ''j''), add (X → α ''a'' • β, ''j'') to S(''k''+1).
* ''Completion'': For every state in S(''k'') of the form (X → γ •, ''j''), find states in S(''j'') of the form (Y → α • X β, ''i'') and add (Y → α X • β, ''i'') to S(''k'').

It is important to note that duplicate states are not added to the state set, only new ones.  These three operations are repeated until no new states can be added to the set.  The set is generally implemented as a queue of states to process, with the operation to be performed depending on what kind of state it is.

 2 + 3 * 4

This is the sequence of state sets:

 (6)  P → S •         (0)    # complete from (4) and S(0)(1)

The state (P → S •, 0) represents a completed parse.  This state also appears in S(3) and S(1), which are complete sentences.

== Constructing the parse forest ==

But Tomita noticed<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tomita|first1=Masaru|title=Efficient Parsing for Natural Language: A Fast Algorithm for Practical Systems|date=April 17, 2013|publisher=Springer Science and Business Media|isbn=1475718853|page=74|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DAjkBwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP13&ots=IPlZ3qLP62&dq=Tomita%20Efficient%20Parsing%20for%20natural%20Language&lr&pg=PA74#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=16 September 2015}}</ref> that this does not take into account the relations between symbols, so if we consider the grammar S → SS | b and the string bbb, it only notes that each S can match one or two b's, and thus produces spurious derivations for bb and bbbb as well as the two correct derivations for bbb.

It is relatively straightforward to take the complete items from the chart and search through them from the top down, assembling the ones which fit together to make the parse forest.

Another method, described in,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Scott|first1=Elizabeth|title=SPPF-Style Parsing From Earley Recognizers|journal=Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science|date=April 1, 2008|volume=203|issue=2|pages=53–67|doi=10.1016/j.entcs.2008.03.044|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1571066108001497|accessdate=16 September 2015}}</ref> is to build the parse forest as you go, augmenting each Earley item with a pointer to a shared packed parse forest (SPPF) node labelled with a triple (s, i, j) where s is a symbol or an LR(0) item (production rule with dot), and i and j give the section of the input string derived by this node. A node's contents are either a pair of child pointers giving a single derivation, or a list of "packed" nodes each containing a pair of pointers and representing one derivation.  SPPF nodes are unique (there is only one with a given label), but may contain more than one derivation for ambiguous parses.  So even if an operation does not add an Earley item (because it already exists), it may still add a derivation to the item's parse forest.

* Predicted items have a null SPPF pointer.
* The scanner creates an SPPF node representing the non-terminal it is scanning.
* Then when the scanner or completer advance an item, they add a derivation whose children are the node from the item whose dot was advanced, and the one for the new symbol which was advanced over (the non-terminal or completed item).

Note also that SPPF nodes are never labeled with a completed LR(0) item: instead they are labelled with the symbol which is produced so that all derivations are combined under one node regardless of which alternative production they come from.
