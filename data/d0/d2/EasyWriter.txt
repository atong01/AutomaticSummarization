==Reception==
In an early review of the IBM PC, ''[[BYTE]]'' stated that EasyWriter for it or the Apple II "didn't seem to be of the same caliber as, say, [[VisiCalc]] or the [[Peachtree Software|Peachtree]] business packages", citing the lack of ease of use and slow scrolling as flaws, and advised those who planned to use the IBM PC primarily for word processing to buy another computer until alternative software became available.<ref name="williams198201">{{cite news | url=http://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1982-01/1982_01_BYTE_07-01_The_IBM_Personal_Computer#page/n37/mode/2up | title=A Closer Look at the IBM Personal Computer | work=BYTE | date=January 1982 | accessdate=19 October 2013 | author=Williams, Gregg | pages=36}}</ref> [[Andrew Fluegelman]] wrote in ''PC Magazine'' that although EasyWriter 1.0 appeared to be an easy-to-use word processor for casual users, it "contains a few very annoying inconveniences and some very serious traps". He cited several bugs, slow performance, and user-interface issues,<ref name="fluegelman19820203">{{cite news | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=w_OhaFDePS4C&lpg=RA2-PA18&pg=PA35#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Not-so-Easywriter | work=PC Magazine | date=February–March 1982 | accessdate=20 October 2013 | author=Fluegelman, Andrew | pages=35}}</ref> and later called it "pretty much a lemon".<ref name="fluegelman198211">{{cite news | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vy3cBZkjbZgC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA73#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Volkswriter 1.1: Camilo Wilson's Claim to Fame | work=PC Magazine | date=November 1982 | accessdate=21 October 2013 | author=Fluegelman, Andrew | pages=73}}</ref> EasyWriter 1.10 resolved most of Fluegelman's complaints. He reported that it "performs smoothly, will handle most any routine writing and printing job, and is easy to learn and operate", and that if IBM had released 1.10 first EasyWriter would likely have become the standard PC word processor.<ref name="fluegelman198208">{{cite news | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WYnHD9WSWdAC&lpg=RA2-PA220&pg=PA180#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=EasyWriter Resurrected | work=PC Magazine | date=August 1982 | accessdate=21 October 2013 | author=Fluegelman, Andrew | pages=180}}</ref>

''BYTE'' criticized EasyWriter II for running as a [[booter]] instead of using DOS, requiring specially formatted disks for storage and a utility to convert to DOS-formatted disks, not being compatible with double-sided drives, and using a heavily [[mode (computer interface)|modal]] editing interface.<ref name="shuford198305">{{cite news | url=http://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-05/1983_05_BYTE_08-05_The_Electronic_Office#page/n181/mode/2up | title=Word Tools for the IBM Personal Computer | work=BYTE | date=May 1983 | accessdate=19 October 2013 | author=Shuford, Richard S. | pages=176}}</ref>
