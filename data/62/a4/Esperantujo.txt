'''Esperantujo''' ({{IPA-all|e̞spe̞ranˈtujo̞|IPA}}) or '''Esperantio''' {{IPA-all|e̞spe̞ranˈti.o̞|}} is a term (meaning "Esperanto-land") used by speakers of the [[International auxiliary language|constructed international auxiliary language]] [[Esperanto]] to refer to the [[Esperanto culture|Esperanto community]] and the activities going on in the language. When two people are speaking Esperanto, they are said to be "in" ''Esperantujo''.

The word is formed analogously to country names. In Esperanto, the names of both lands and nation states were traditionally formed from the ethnic name of their inhabitants plus the suffix ''-ujo'', so for example "France" was ''Francujo'', from ''franco'' (a Frenchman). 

The term most analogous to ''Francujo'' would be ''Esperantistujo'' (Esperantist-land). However, that would convey the idea of the physical body of people, whereas using the name of the language as the basis of the word gives it the more abstract connotation of a cultural sphere. 

Currently, names of nation states are often formed with the suffix ''-io'' traditionally reserved for deriving country names from geographic features, so now ''Francio'', and recently the form ''Esperantio'' has been used ''i.a.'' in the [[Pasporta Servo]] and the Esperanto Citizens' Community.

In 1908, Doctor [[William Molly]] attempted to create an Esperanto nation in [[Neutral Moresnet]] known as "Amikejo" (place of friendship). What became of it is unclear, and Neutral Moresnet was annexed to [[Belgium]] in the [[Treaty of Versailles, 1919]].<ref>http://www.moresnet.nl/english/geschiedenis_en.htm#Dr. Wilhelm Molly</ref>
