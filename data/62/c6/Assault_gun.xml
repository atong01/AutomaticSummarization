The term is a literal translation of the German word<space/><italics>Sturmgeschtz</italics>. Nazi Germany introduced the first purpose-built assault gun, the StuG III, in the late 1930s, thus establishing this category of armoured vehicles.</paragraph><paragraph>Historically, the custom-built fully armoured assault guns usually mounted the<space/><link><target>gun</target></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>howitzer</target></link><space/>in a fully enclosed<space/><link><target>casemate</target></link><space/>on a<space/><link><target>tank</target></link><space/><link><target>chassis</target></link>. The use of a<space/><link><target>casemate</target></link><space/>instead of a<space/><link><target>gun turret</target><part>turret</part></link><space/>limited these weapons'<space/><link><target>field of fire (weaponry)</target><part>field of fire</part></link>, but allowed a larger gun to be fitted relative to the chassis, more armour to be fitted for the same weight, and provided a cheaper construction. In most cases, these turretless vehicles also presented a lower profile as a target for the enemy.</paragraph><paragraph>The assault gun looks and works in the same way as the similar<space/><link><target>tank destroyer</target></link>, the only difference in most cases being the gun. Assault guns generally used larger calibre, lower velocity guns, with their primary ammunition being that of high-explosive shells; these were meant for taking out soft targets as outlined in its infantry support role. This was contrasted with the tank destroyer, which utilized higher velocity, and therefore smaller calibre guns, firing armour-piercing shells as their primary ammunition. Therefore, these vehicles often sacrificed being able to fire a good high-explosive shell in exchange for maximal armour penetration characteristics. Towards the beginning of the war, a single vehicle could generally be used in both roles, but that changed as the classes became increasingly specialized as the war progressed.</paragraph><heading level='2'>History</heading><heading level='3'>World War II</heading><paragraph><link><target>Image:Su76 nn.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>The Soviet<space/><link><target>SU-76</target></link><space/>was easily constructed in small factories incapable of producing proper tanks.</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>Assault guns were primarily used during<space/><link><target>World War II</target></link><space/>by the forces of<space/><link><target>Nazi Germany</target></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>Soviet Union</target></link>.

As the amount of German armour encountered by the Allies decreased, especially in Italy, a number of American<space/><link><target>tank destroyer</target></link><space/>units were used in the assault gun role for infantry support.</paragraph><paragraph>The AVRE version of the Churchill Tank was armed with a<space/><link><target>Mortar (weapon)#Spigot mortar</target><part>Spigot mortar</part></link><space/>that fired a<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>40</arg><arg>lb</arg><arg>kg</arg><arg name="abbr">on</arg></template><space/><link><target>High explosive</target><part>HE</part></link>-filled projectile (nicknamed the<space/><italics>Flying Dustbin</italics>)<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>150</arg><arg>yd</arg><arg>m</arg></template>. Its task was to attack fortified positions such as<space/><link><target>bunker</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>at close range (see<space/><link><target>Hobart's Funnies</target></link>).</paragraph><heading level='3'>Post-war use</heading><paragraph>In the post-<link><target>World War II</target><part>WWII</part></link><space/>era, vehicles fitting into an &quot;assault gun&quot; category were developed as a light-weight, air-deployable, direct fire weapon for use with airborne troops. Current weapons were either based on<space/><link><target>jeep</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>or small<space/><link><target>Caterpillar track</target><part>tracked</part></link><space/>vehicles and the airborne troops thus always fought at a distinct disadvantage in terms of heavy weapons. The Soviet Union and the United States were the most attracted to the idea of providing this capability to traditionally light airborne forces. Their answers to the problem were similar, with the United States developing the<space/><link><target>M56 Scorpion</target></link><space/>and the Soviet Union developing the<space/><link><target>ASU-57</target></link>, both essentially air-droppable light anti-tank guns.</paragraph><paragraph>The Soviets went on to develop an improved air-droppable assault gun, the<space/><link><target>ASU-85</target></link>, which served through the 1980s, while their<space/><link><target>SU-100</target></link><space/>remained in service with Communist countries, including Vietnam and Cuba, years after WW2. The US M56 and another armoured vehicle, the<space/><link><target>Ontos</target><part>M50 Ontos</part></link>, were to be the last of the more traditional assault guns in US service. Improvised arrangements such as<space/><link><target>M113 Armored Personnel Carrier#Weapons</target><part>M113</part></link><space/>personnel carriers with recoilless rifles were quickly replaced by missile carrier vehicles in the anti-tank role.</paragraph><paragraph>The only vehicle with the qualities of an assault gun to be fielded after the removal of the M50 and M56 from service within the US military was the<space/><link><target>M551 Sheridan</target></link>. The Sheridan's gun was a low-velocity weapon suitable in the assault role, but with the addition of the<space/><link><target>Shillelagh missile</target></link><space/>could double in the anti-tank role as well. The Sheridan, however, was not developed as an assault gun but as a light reconnaissance vehicle.</paragraph><paragraph>Currently there appears to be a move toward wheeled vehicles fitting a &quot;tank destroyer&quot; or &quot;assault gun&quot; role, such as the<space/><link><target>M1128 Mobile Gun System</target></link><space/>of the<space/><link><target>US Army</target></link>, the<space/><link><target>Centauro</target></link><space/>Wheeled Tank Destroyer of the<space/><link><target>Italian Army</target><part>Italian</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Spanish Army</target><part>Spanish Armies</part></link>, the Chinese anti-tank gun PTL-02 and the French<space/><link><target>AMX 10 RC</target></link><space/>heavy armoured car. While these vehicles might be useful in a direct fire role, none were developed with this specifically in mind, reminiscent of the use of tank destroyers by the US military in the assault gun role during WWII.</paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Armoured warfare</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Sturmgeschtz</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Tank destroyer</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Armoured fighting vehicle</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>List of assault guns</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Self-propelled gun</target></link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><extension extension_name='references'></extension></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>Authority control</target></template><template><target>DEFAULTSORT:Assault Gun</target></template><link><target>Category:Assault guns</target><part></part></link></paragraph></article>
