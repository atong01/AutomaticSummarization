'''Camelot''' is a [[castle]] and court associated with the legendary [[King Arthur]]. Absent in the early Arthurian material, Camelot first appeared in 12th-century French romances and, after the [[Lancelot-Grail]] cycle, eventually came to be described as the fantastic capital of Arthur's realm and a symbol of the Arthurian world. The stories locate it somewhere in Great Britain and sometimes associate it with real cities, though more usually its precise location is not revealed. Most scholars regard it as being entirely fictional, its geography being perfect for romance writers; Arthurian scholar [[Norris J. Lacy]] commented that "Camelot, located no where in particular, can be anywhere".<ref name="Lacy">[[Norris J. Lacy|Lacy, Norris J.]] (1991). "Camelot". In Norris J. Lacy (Ed.), ''The New Arthurian Encyclopedia'', pp. 66–67. New York: Garland. ISBN 0-8240-4377-4.</ref> Nevertheless, arguments about the location of the "real Camelot" have occurred since the 15th century and continue to rage today in popular works and for tourism purposes.

== Early appearances ==
The castle is mentioned for the first time in [[Chrétien de Troyes]]' poem "[[Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart]]", dating to the 1170s, though it does not appear in all the manuscripts.<ref name="Lacy"/><ref>[http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/cammenu.htm "Camelot"]. From the Camelot Project. Retrieved October 9, 2008.</ref> It is mentioned in passing, and is not described:
:''A un jor d'une Acenssion / Fu venuz de vers Carlion / Li rois Artus et tenu ot / Cort molt riche a Camaalot / Si riche com au jor estut. ''<ref>[http://europa.perso.cegetel.net/lancelot/lancelot/lancelot01.htm Lancelot Ou Le Chevalier De La Charette<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
:Upon a certain Ascension Day King Arthur had come from Caerleon, and had held a very magnificent court at Camelot as was fitting on such a day.<ref>''Lancelot'', vv. 31-32.</ref>

Nothing in Chrétien's poem suggests the level of importance Camelot would have in later romances. For Chrétien, Arthur's chief court was in [[Caerleon]] in Wales; this was the king's primary base in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' and subsequent literature.<ref name="Lacy"/> Chrétien depicts Arthur, like a typical medieval monarch, holding court at a number of cities and castles. It is not until the 13th-century French prose romances, including the [[Lancelot-Grail]] and the [[Post-Vulgate Cycle]], that Camelot began to supersede Caerleon, and even then, many descriptive details applied to Camelot derive from Geoffrey's earlier grand depiction of the Welsh town.<ref name="Lacy"/> Most Arthurian romances of this period produced in English or Welsh did not follow this trend; Camelot was referred to infrequently, and usually in translations from French. One exception is ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'', which locates Arthur's court at "Camelot";<ref>''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', line 37.</ref> however, in Britain, Arthur's court was generally located at Caerleon, or at [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], which is usually identified with the "Carduel" of the French romances.<ref>Ashley, pp. 612-3.</ref> However, in the late 15th century, [[Thomas Malory]] created the image of Camelot most familiar to English speakers today in his ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', a work based mostly on the French romances. He firmly identifies Camelot with [[Winchester]], an identification that remained popular over the centuries, though it was rejected by Malory's own editor, [[William Caxton]], who preferred a Welsh location.<ref name="Caxton">Malory, ''Le Morte d'Arthur'', p. xvii.</ref>

=== Etymology ===
The name's derivation is uncertain. It has numerous different spellings in medieval French Arthurian romance, including: ''Camaalot'', ''Camalot'', ''Chamalot'', ''Camehelot'' (sometimes read as ''Camchilot''), ''Camaaloth'', ''Caamalot'', ''Camahaloth'', ''Camaelot'', ''Kamaalot'', ''Kamaaloth'', ''Kaamalot'', ''Kamahaloth'', ''Kameloth'', ''Kamaelot'', ''Kamelot'', ''Kaamelot'', ''Cameloth'', ''Camelot'', ''Kamelot'', ''Kaamelot'', and ''Gamalaot''.<ref name="Loomis, Roger Sherman 1961, p. 480">Loomis, Roger Sherman, Arthurian tradition & Chrétien de Troyes, Columbia University Press, 1961, p. 480.</ref><ref>Sommer, Heinrich Oskar, The Vulgate Version of the Arthurian Romances: Lestoire de Merlin, Carnegie Institution, 1916, p. 19.</ref><ref name="Brugger, Ernst 1905, pp. 1-71">Brugger, Ernst, "Beiträge zur Erklärung der arthurischen Geographie", in: Zeitschrift für französische Sprache und Literatur, Volume 28, 1905, pp. 1-71.</ref> Renowned Arthurian scholar Ernst Brugger suggested that it was a corruption of ''[[Camlann]]'',<ref name="Brugger, Ernst 1905, pp. 1-71"/> the site of Arthur's final battle in Welsh tradition. [[Roger Sherman Loomis]] believed it was derived from ''Cavalon'', a place name that he suggested was a corruption of [[Avalon]] (under the influence of the Breton place name ''Cavallon''). He further suggested that ''Cavalon/Camelot'' became Arthur's capital due to confusion with Arthur's other traditional court at ''Carlion'' (''Caer Lleon'' in Welsh).<ref name="Loomis, Roger Sherman 1961, p. 480"/>

Others have suggested a derivation from the [[Iron Age Britain|Iron Age]] and [[Roman Britain|Romano-British]] place name ''[[Camulodunum]]'', one of the first capitals of [[Roman Britain]] and which would have significance in [[Romano-British culture]]. Indeed, [[John Morris (historian)|John Morris]], the English historian who specialized in the study of the institutions of the [[Roman Empire]] and the history of [[Sub-Roman Britain]], suggested in his book ''The Age of Arthur'' that as the descendants of Romanized Britons looked back to a golden age of peace and prosperity under Rome, the name "Camelot" of Arthurian legend may have referred to the capital of [[Britannia]]  (''[[Camulodunum]]'', modern [[Colchester]]) in Roman times. It is unclear, however, where Chrétien would have encountered the name ''Camulodunum'', or why he would render it as ''Camaalot'', though Urban T. Holmes argued in 1929 that Chretien had access to [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/2*.html Book 2] of Pliny's ''[[Natural History]]'', where it is rendered as "Camaloduno".<ref>Nitze, William A. et al. ''Le Haut Livre del Graal: Perlesvaus - Volume 2: Commentary and Notes'', p. 196. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1937.</ref> Given Chrétien's known tendency to create new stories and characters, being the first to mention the hero [[Lancelot]]'s love affair with Queen [[Guinevere]] for example, the name might also be entirely invented.<ref name="Lacy"/>

== Description in the romances ==
The [[Lancelot-Grail]] Cycle and the texts it influenced depict the city of Camelot as standing along a river, downstream from [[Astolat]]. It is surrounded by plains and forests, and its magnificent cathedral, [[Saint Stephen|St. Stephen's]], is the religious centre for Arthur's [[Knights of the Round Table]]. There, Arthur and Guinevere are married and there are the tombs of many kings and knights. In a mighty castle stands the [[Round Table (Camelot)|Round Table]]; it is here that [[Galahad]] conquers the [[Siege Perilous]], and where the knights see a vision of the [[Holy Grail]] and swear to find it. Jousts are held in a meadow outside the city. In the ''[[Palamedes (romance)|Palamedes]]'' and other works, the castle is eventually destroyed by King [[Mark of Cornwall]] after the loss of Arthur at the [[Battle of Camlann]].<ref name="Lacy"/> However maddening to later scholars searching for Camelot's location, its imprecise geography serves the romances well, as Camelot becomes less a literal place than a powerful symbol of Arthur's court and universe.<ref name="Lacy"/> It should be noted, too, that there is a Kamaalot featured as the home of Perceval's mother in the romance ''[[Perlesvaus]]''.<ref>http://www.celtic-twilight.com/camelot/bruce_dictionary/index_k.htm</ref>

The romancers' versions of Camelot drew on earlier descriptions of Arthur's fabulous court. From Geoffrey's grand description of Caerleon, Camelot gains its impressive architecture, its many churches and the chivalry and courtesy of its inhabitants.<ref name="Lacy"/> Geoffrey's description in turn drew on an already established tradition in Welsh oral tradition of the grandeur of Arthur's court. The tale ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', associated with the ''[[Mabinogion]]'' and perhaps written in the 11th century, draws a dramatic picture of Arthur's hall and his many powerful warriors who go from there on great adventures, placing it in [[Celliwig]], an uncertain locale in [[Cornwall]]. Although the court at Celliwig is the most prominent in remaining early Welsh manuscripts, the various versions of the [[Welsh Triads]] agree in giving Arthur multiple courts, one in each of the areas inhabited by the [[Britons (historical)|Britons]]: [[Cornwall]], Wales and the [[Hen Ogledd|Old North]]. This perhaps reflects the influence of widespread oral traditions common by 800 which are recorded in various place names and features such as [[Arthur's Seat]] indicating Arthur was a hero known and associated with many locations across Brittonic areas of Britain as well as [[Brittany]]. Even at this stage Arthur could not be tied to one location.<ref name="Cadbury">[[Geoffrey Ashe|Ashe, Geoffrey]] (1991). "Topography and Local Legends". In Norris J. Lacy (Ed.), ''The New Arthurian Encyclopedia'', pp. 455–458. New York: Garland. ISBN 0-8240-4377-4.</ref> Many other places are listed as a location where Arthur holds court in the later romances, Carlisle and [[London]] perhaps being the most prominent.

== Identifications ==
The romancers' versions of Camelot draw on earlier traditions of Arthur's fabulous court. The Celliwig of ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'' appears in the [[Welsh Triads]] as well; interestingly, this early Welsh material places Wales' greatest leader outside its national boundaries. Geoffrey's description of [[Caerleon]] is probably based on his personal familiarity with the town and its impressive Roman ruins; it is less clear that Caerleon was associated with Arthur before Geoffrey. Several French romances (''[[Perlesvaus]]'', the Didot ''Perceval'' attributed to [[Robert de Boron]], and even the early romances of [[Chretien de Troyes]] such as ''[[Erec and Enide]]'' and ''[[Yvain, the Knight of the Lion]]'') have Arthur hold court at "Carduel in Wales," a northern city based on the real [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]].

Malory's identification of Camelot as [[Winchester]] was probably partially inspired by the latter city's history. It had been the capital of [[Wessex]] under [[Alfred the Great]], and boasted the [[Winchester Round Table]], an artifact constructed in the 13th century but widely believed to be the original by Malory's time. Malory's editor Caxton rejects the association, saying Camelot was in Wales and that its ruins could still be seen; this is a likely reference to the Roman ruins at [[Caerwent]].<ref name="Caxton"/> Malory associated other Arthurian locations with modern places, for instance locating [[Astolat]] at [[Guildford]].

In 1542, [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] reported the locals around [[Cadbury Castle, Somerset|Cadbury Castle]], formerly known as Camalet,<ref name=rev>Phelps, W. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_vw1AQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA118 ''The History and Antiquities of Somersetshire; Being a General and Parochial Survey of That Interesting County, to which is Prefixed an Historical Introduction, with a Brief View of Ecclesiastical History; and an Account of the Druidical, Belgic-British, Roman, Saxon, Danish, and Norman Antiquities, Now Extant'', Vol.&nbsp;II, Ch.&nbsp;VI, §1: "Camalet or Cadbury", p.&nbsp;118]. J.&nbsp;B. Nichols & Son (London), 1839.</ref> in [[Somerset]] considered it to be the original Camelot. This theory, which was repeated by later antiquaries, is bolstered, or may have derived from, Cadbury's proximity to the [[River Cam (Somerset)]] and the villages of [[Queen Camel]] and [[West Camel]], and remained popular enough to help inspire a large-scale archaeological dig in the 20th century.<ref name="Cadbury"/> These excavations, led by archaeologist [[Leslie Alcock]] from 1966–70, were titled "Cadbury-Camelot," and won much media attention, even being mentioned in the film of the musical ''[[Camelot (film)|Camelot]]''.<ref name="Cadbury"/> The dig revealed that the site seems to have been occupied as early as the 4th millennium {{sc|bc}} and to have been refortified and occupied by a major [[Britons (Celtic people)|British]] ruler and his [[teulu|warband]] from {{c.|470}}. This [[Sub-Roman Britain|early medieval]] settlement continued until around 580.<ref name=nhle>{{cite web|title=Large multivallate hillfort and associated earthworks at South Cadbury|url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1011980|work=National heritage list for England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=1 June 2013}}</ref> The works were by far the largest known fortification of the period, double the size of comparative ''[[caer]]s'' and with Mediterranean artifacts representing extensive trade<ref>{{cite book |last=Alcock |first=Leslie |authorlink=Leslie Alcock|title="By South Cadbury is that Camelot...": Excavations at Cadbury Castle 1966-70 |year=1972 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |isbn=0-8128-1505-X|ref=harv }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Alcock |first=Leslie|authorlink=Leslie Alcock |title=Arthur's Britain |year=1973 |publisher=Pelican |location=Harmondsworth |isbn=0-14-021396-1|ref=harv }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Tabor |first=Richard |title=Cadbury Castle: The hillfort and landscapes |year=2008 |publisher=The History Press |location=Stroud |pp=169–172|ref=harv|isbn=978-0-7524-4715-5}}</ref> and Saxon ones showing possible conquest.<ref name="Cadbury"/> The use of the name Camelot and the support of [[Geoffrey Ashe]] helped ensure much publicity for the finds, but Alcock himself later grew embarrassed by the supposed Arthurian connection to the site. Following the arguments of [[David Dumville]], Alcock felt the site was too late and too uncertain to be a tenable Camelot.<ref>Alcock &&nbsp;al.</ref> Modern archaeologists follow him in rejecting the name, calling it instead Cadbury Castle hill fort. Despite this, Cadbury remains widely associated with Camelot.

There were two towns in Roman Britain named [[Camulodunum]], [[Colchester]] in [[Essex]] and [[Slack, West Yorkshire|Slack]] in [[West Yorkshire]], derived from the Celtic god [[Camulos]], and this has led to the suggestion that they originated the name.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} However, the [[Essex]] Camulodunum was located well within territory usually thought to have been conquered early in the 5th century by [[Saxons]], so it is unlikely to have been the location of any "true" Camelot. The town was definitely known as Colchester as early as the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' in 917.<ref>[http://www.s-gabriel.org/names/badger/placenames.htm Place Names]</ref> Even Colchester Museum argues strongly regarding the historical Arthur: "It would be impossible and inconceivable to link him to the Colchester area, or to Essex more generally", pointing out that the connection between the name Camuloduum and Colchester was unknown till the 18th century.<ref>[http://www.camulos.com/arthur/official.htm Official Response to linking Arthur and Colchester]</ref> Other places in Britain with names related to "Camel" have also been suggested, such as [[Camelford]] in Cornwall, located down the [[River Camel]] from where Geoffrey places [[Battle of Camlann|Camlann]], the scene of Arthur's final battle. The area's connections with Camelot and Camlann are merely speculative.

== Later uses ==
Camelot has become a permanent fixture in interpretations of the Arthurian legend. The symbolism of Camelot so impressed [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] that he wrote up a prose sketch on the castle as one of his earliest attempts to treat the Arthurian legend.<ref>Staines, David (1991). "Alfred, Lord Tennyson". In Norris J. Lacy (Ed.), ''The New Arthurian Encyclopedia'', pp. 446–449. New York: Garland. ISBN 0-8240-4377-4.</ref> ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]'', a novel by Mark Twain in 1889, takes place in Camelot. Recent versions typically retain Camelot's lack of precise location and its status as a symbol of the Arthurian world, though they typically transform the castle itself into romantically lavish visions of a [[High Middle Ages]] palace.<ref name="Lacy"/> It lends its name to the 1960 musical ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'' by [[Alan Jay Lerner]] and [[Frederick Loewe]], which is based on [[T. H. White]]'s literary version of the legend, ''[[The Once and Future King]]''. The musical was adapted into a 1967 [[Camelot (film)|film of the same name]], which starred [[Richard Harris]] as Arthur, and which featured the Castle of [[Coca, Segovia]] as a fittingly opulent Camelot. Some writers of the "realist" strain of modern Arthurian fiction have attempted a more sensible Camelot; inspired by Alcock's Cadbury-Camelot excavation, writers [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]], [[Mary Stewart (novelist)|Mary Stewart]], and Catherine Christian place their Camelots in that place and describe it accordingly.<ref name="Cadbury"/>

Camelot makes only a brief appearance in the 1975 parody ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'': Having recruited several knights, King Arthur ([[Graham Chapman]]) invites them to reside with him at Camelot. The camera pans to a castle on a hill, then cuts to the knights as each in succession joyfully exclaims, "Camelot!" (Arthur's servant Patsy, played by co-director [[Terry Gilliam]], grumbles, "It's only a model.") Then, after an interior sequence, in which the resident knights sing, "We're Knights of the Round Table" while engaging in madcap antics, the camera cuts back to Arthur, who decides, "On second thought, let's not go there. It is a silly place."<ref>Python (Monty) Pictures, Ltd. (1975). ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail''. Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones (dir.); John Goldstone (executive producer).</ref>

In American contexts, the word "Camelot" is sometimes used to refer admiringly to the presidency of [[John F. Kennedy]]. The [[Camelot (musical)|Lerner and Loewe musical]] was still quite recent at the time and his widow [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jackie]] quoted its lines in a 1963 ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' interview following [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|JFK's assassination]]. She said the lines, "Don't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment, that was known as Camelot" were Kennedy's favorite in the score, adding that "there'll be great Presidents again, but there'll never be another Camelot again… It will never be that way again."<ref>Jacqueline Kennedy, interview with Theodore H. White, ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', Dec. 6, 1963. Coincidentally, the [http://artwork.barewalls.com/artwork/KennedyAssassinated.html?ArtworkID=250738&thumbs=1&productid=278738 November 23, 1963], edition of the ''London Herald'' had the subheadline: “America Mourns Camelot Dream.”</ref>

[[Camelot Theme Park]] was a resort and [[theme park]] located in the English county of Lancashire, UK.

''[[Kaamelott]]'' is a French [[television series]] that presents a humorous alternative version of the Arthurian legend.

Camelot is featured in ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]''. In "Heroes and Villains," Rumplestiltskin once visited Camelot to obtain a magic gauntlet. In "The Dark Swan," Camelot is fully seen. Brocéliande is somewhere near Camelot. According to an interview with [[Adam Horowitz]], Camelot is a few days ride away from the [[Enchanted forest|Enchanted Forest]] and Arendelle.<ref>http://tvline.com/2015/09/13/once-upon-a-time-season-5-preview-emma-dark-hook-regina-zelena/</ref>
