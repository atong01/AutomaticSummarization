The term '''clairvoyance''' (from French ''clair'' meaning "clear" and ''voyance'' meaning "vision") is used to refer to the ability to gain information about an object, person, location or physical event through means other than the known senses,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mw1.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/clairvoyance |title=Merriam-Webster Online dictionary, Retrieved 2007-10-05 "1: the power or faculty of discerning objects not present to the senses 2: ability to perceive matters beyond the range of ordinary perception: penetration" |publisher=Mw1.merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=November 17, 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9364105 Britannica Online Encyclopedia], Retrieved 2007-10-07.

==Usage==

Pertaining to the ability of clear-sightedness, clairvoyance refers to the [[paranormal]] ability to see persons and events that are distant in time or space.  It can be divided into roughly three classes: [[precognition]], the ability to perceive or predict future events, [[retrocognition]], the ability to see past events, and [[remote viewing]], the perception of contemporary events happening outside of the range of normal perception.<ref>[[J. Gordon Melton|Melton, John]]. (2001). ''The Encyclopedia of Occultism & Parapsychology''. p. 297. Gale Group, Detroit. ISBN 978-0810385702.</ref>

==Parapsychology==

===Early research===
The earliest record of somnambulistic clairvoyance is credited to the [[Armand-Marie-Jacques de Chastenet, Marquis of Puységur|Marquis de Puységur]], a follower of [[Franz Mesmer]], who in 1784 was treating a local dull-witted peasant named Victor Race. During treatment, Race reportedly would go into trance and undergo a personality change, becoming fluent and articulate, and giving diagnosis and prescription for his own disease as well as those of others.<ref>[[Ann Taves|Taves, Ann]]. (1999). ''Fits, Trances, and Visions: Experiencing Religion and Explaining Experience from Wesley to James''. Princeton University Press. p. 126. ISBN 0-691-01024-2</ref> Clairvoyance was a reported ability of some mediums during the [[Spiritualism|spiritualist]] period of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and psychics of many descriptions have claimed clairvoyant ability up to the present day.<ref>[[Ray Hyman|Hyman, Ray]].

Early researchers of clairvoyance included [[William Gregory (chemist)|William Gregory]], Gustav Pagenstecher, and [[Rudolf Tischner]].<ref>Roeckelein, Jon. (2006). ''Elsevier's Dictionary of Psychological Theories''. Elsevier Science. p. 450. ISBN 0-444-51750-2</ref> Clairvoyance experiments were reported in 1884 by [[Charles Richet]]. Playing cards were enclosed in envelopes and a subject put under hypnosis attempted to identify them. The subject was reported to have been successful in a series of 133 trials but the results dropped to chance level when performed before a group of scientists in Cambridge. J. M. Peirce and [[Edward Charles Pickering|E. C. Pickering]] reported a similar experiment in which they tested 36 subjects over 23, 384 trials which did not obtain above chance scores.<ref>[[C. E. M. Hansel|Hansel, C. E. M]]. ''The Search for a Demonstration of ESP''. In [[Paul Kurtz]]. (1985). ''A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology''. Prometheus Books. pp. 97-127. ISBN 0-87975-300-5</ref>

[[Ivor Lloyd Tuckett]] (1911) and [[Joseph McCabe]] (1920) analyzed early cases of clairvoyance and came to the conclusion they were best explained by coincidence or fraud.<ref>[[Joseph McCabe|McCabe, Joseph]].

A significant development in clairvoyance research came when [[Joseph Banks Rhine|J. B. Rhine]], a parapsychologist at [[Duke University]], introduced a standard methodology, with a standard statistical approach to analyzing data, as part of his research into [[extrasensory perception]]. A number of psychological departments attempted to repeat Rhine's experiments with failure. W. S. Cox (1936) from [[Princeton University]] with 132 subjects produced 25, 064 trials in a playing card ESP experiment. Cox concluded "There is no evidence of extrasensory perception either in the 'average man' or of the group investigated or in any particular individual of that group. The discrepancy between these results and those obtained by Rhine is due either to uncontrollable factors in experimental procedure or to the difference in the subjects."<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cox | first1 = W.

At Colgate University (40, 000 tests, 7 subjects), at Chicago (extensive series on 315 students), at Southern Methodist College (75, 000 tests), at Glasgow, Scotland (6, 650 tests), at London University (105, 000 tests), not a single individual was found who under rigidly conducted experiments could score above chance. At Stanford University it has been convincingly shown that the conditions favorable to the intrusion of subtle errors produce above-chance records which come down to chance when sources of error are eliminated."</ref><ref>[[C.

Tests often took place with minimal or no screening between the subject and the person administering the test. Subjects could see the backs of cards that were later discovered to be so cheaply printed that a faint outline of the symbol could be seen. Furthermore, in face-to-face tests, subjects could see card faces reflected in the tester’s eyeglasses or cornea. They were even able to (consciously or unconsciously) pick up clues from the tester’s facial expression and voice inflection. In addition, an observant subject could identify the cards by certain irregularities like warped edges, spots on the backs, or design imperfections."</ref><ref>[[Terence Hines|Hines, Terence]].

[[Eileen Garrett]] was tested by Rhine at Duke University in 1933 with [[Zener cards]]. Certain symbols that were placed on the cards and sealed in an envelope, and she was asked to guess their contents. She performed poorly and later criticized the tests by claiming the cards lacked a [[Energy (esotericism)|psychic energy]] called "energy stimulus" and that she could not perform clairvoyance to order.<ref>Hazelgrove, Jenny.

===Remote viewing===

[[Remote viewing]] also known as remote sensing, remote perception, telesthesia and travelling clairvoyance is the alleged paranormal ability to perceive a remote or hidden target without support of the senses.<ref>Blom, Jan. (2009). ''A Dictionary of Hallucinations''. Springer. p. 451. ISBN 978-1441912220</ref>

A well known study of remote viewing in recent times has been the US government-funded project at the [[SRI International|Stanford Research Institute]] during the 1970s through the mid-1990s. In 1972, [[Harold E. Puthoff|Harold Puthoff]] and [[Russell Targ]] initiated a series of human subject studies to determine whether participants (the ''viewers'' or ''percipients'') could reliably identify and accurately describe salient features of remote locations or ''targets''. In the early studies, a human ''sender'' was typically present at the remote location, as part of the experiment protocol. A three-step process was used, the first step being to randomly select the target conditions to be experienced by the senders. Secondly, in the viewing step, participants were asked to verbally express or sketch their impressions of the remote scene. Thirdly, in the judging step, these descriptions were matched by separate judges, as closely as possible, with the intended targets. The term [[remote viewing]] was coined to describe this overall process. The first paper by Puthoff and Targ on remote viewing was published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in March 1974; in it, the team reported some degree of remote viewing success.<ref name=nat251>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/251602a0 |title=Information transmission under conditions of sensory shielding |year=1974 |first=Russel |last=Targ |first2=Harold |last2=Puthoff |journal=Nature |volume=251 |pages=602–607 |pmid=4423858 |issue=5476}}</ref> After the publication of these findings, other attempts to replicate the experiments were carried out.<ref name=hast1>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1109/PROC.1976.10369 |title=A confirmatory remote viewing experiment in a group setting |date=October 1976 |author=Hastings, A.C. |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |volume=64 |pages=1544–1545 |last2=Hurt |first2=D.B.|issue=10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1109/PROC.1976.10371 |title=Preliminary experiments in group 'Remote viewing' |date=October 1976 |author=Whitson, T.W. |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |volume=64 |pages=1550–1551 |last2=Bogart |first2=D.N. |last3=Palmer |first3=J. |last4=Tart |first4=C.T.|issue=10}}</ref> and remotely linked groups using computer conferencing.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1109/PROC.1976.10372 |title=Remote viewing experiments through computer conferencing |date=October 1976 |author=Vallee, J. |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |volume=64 |pages=1551–1552 |last2=Hastings |first2=A.C. |last3=Askevold |first3=G.|issue=10}}</ref>

The psychologists [[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]] and Richard Kammann attempted to replicate Targ and Puthoff’s remote viewing experiments that were carried out in the 1970s at the Stanford Research Institute. In a series of 35 studies, they were unable to replicate the results so investigated the procedure of the original experiments. Marks and Kammann discovered that the notes given to the judges in Targ and Puthoff's experiments contained clues as to which order they were carried out, such as referring to yesterday's two targets, or they had the date of the session written at the top of the page. They concluded that these clues were the reason for the experiment's high hit rates.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Marks | first1 = David | authorlink = David Marks (psychologist) | last2 = Kammann | first2 = Richard | year = 1978 | title = Information transmission in remote viewing experiments | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 274 | issue = 5672| pages = 680–681 | doi=10.1038/274680a0}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Marks | first1 = David | authorlink = David Marks (psychologist) | year = 1981 | title = Sensory cues invalidate remote viewing experiments | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 292 | issue = 5819| page = 177 | doi=10.1038/292177a0}}</ref> Marks was able to achieve 100 per cent accuracy without visiting any of the sites himself but by using cues.<ref>Bridgstock, Martin. (2009). ''Beyond Belief: Skepticism, Science and the Paranormal''. Cambridge University Press. p. 106. ISBN 978-0521758932 "The explanation used by Marks and Kammann clearly involves the use of [[Occam's razor]]. Marks and Kammann argued that the 'cues' - clues to the order in which sites had been visited—provided sufficient information for the results, without any recourse to extrasensory perception. Indeed Marks himself was able to achieve 100 percent accuracy in allocating some transcripts to sites without visiting any of the sites himself, purely on the ground basis of the cues. From Occam's razor, it follows that if a straightforward natural explanation exists, there is no need for the spectacular paranormal explanation: Targ and Puthoff's claims are not justified".</ref> [[James Randi]] has written controlled tests by several other researchers, eliminating several sources of cuing and extraneous evidence present in the original tests, produced negative results. Students were also able to solve Puthoff and Targ's locations from the clues that had inadvertently been included in the transcripts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.randi.org/encyclopedia/remote%20viewing.html |title=James Randi Educational Foundation — An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural |publisher=Randi.org |accessdate=2014-04-11}}</ref>

In 1980, [[Charles Tart]] claimed that a rejudging of the transcripts from one of Targ and Puthoff’s experiments revealed an above-chance result.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tart | first1 = Charles | authorlink = Charles Tart | authorlink2 = Harold E.

(2003). ''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. p. 136. ISBN 978-1573929790</ref> Marks and Christopher Scott (1986) wrote "considering the importance for the remote viewing hypothesis of adequate cue removal, Tart’s failure to perform this basic task seems beyond comprehension. As previously concluded, remote viewing has not been demonstrated in the experiments conducted by Puthoff and Targ, only the repeated failure of the investigators to remove sensory cues."<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Marks | first1 = David | authorlink = David Marks (psychologist) | last2 = Scott | first2 = Christopher | year = 1986 | title = Remote Viewing Exposed | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 319 | issue = 6053| page = 444 | doi=10.1038/319444a0 | pmid=3945330}}</ref>

==Scientific reception==

According to scientific research, clairvoyance is generally explained as the result of [[confirmation bias]], [[Observer-expectancy effect|expectancy bias]], fraud, [[hallucination]], self-[[delusion]], [[sensory leakage]], [[subjective validation]], [[wishful thinking]] or failures to appreciate the base rate of chance occurrences and not as a paranormal power.<ref name=skepdic1/><ref>Rawcliffe, Donovan.

[[Scientific skepticism|Skeptics]] say that if clairvoyance were a reality it would have become abundantly clear. They also contend that those who believe in [[paranormal]] phenomena do so for merely psychological reasons.<ref>[[Chris French|French, Chis]]; Wilson, Krissy. (2007). ''Cognitive Factors Underlying Paranormal Beliefs and Experiences''. In Sala, Sergio. ''Tall Tales About the Mind and Brain: Separating Fact From Fiction''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 3-22. ISBN 978-0198568773</ref> According to [[David Myers (academic)|David G. Myers]] (''Psychology,'' 8th ed.):

<blockquote>The search for a valid and reliable test of clairvoyance has resulted in thousands of experiments. One controlled procedure has invited 'senders' to telepathically transmit one of four visual images to 'receivers' deprived of sensation in a nearby chamber (Bem & Honorton, 1994). The result? A reported 32 percent accurate response rate, surpassing the chance rate of 25 percent. But follow-up studies have (depending on who was summarizing the results) failed to replicate the phenomenon or produced mixed results (Bem & others, 2001; Milton & Wiseman, 2002; Storm, 2000, 2003).<br /><br />One skeptic, magician [[James Randi]], has a longstanding offer—now [[One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge|U.S. $1 million]]—“to anyone who proves a genuine psychic power under proper observing conditions” (Randi, 1999). French, Australian, and Indian groups have parallel offers of up to 200,000 euros to anyone with demonstrable paranormal abilities (CFI, 2003). Large as these sums are, the scientific seal of approval would be worth far more to anyone whose claims could be authenticated. To refute those who say there is no ESP, one need only produce a single person who can demonstrate a single, reproducible ESP phenomenon. So far, no such person has emerged. Randi’s offer has been publicized for three decades and dozens of people have been tested, sometimes under the scrutiny of an independent panel of judges. Still, nothing.  "People's desire to believe in the paranormal is stronger than all the evidence that it does not exist." [[Susan Blackmore]], "Blackmore's first law", 2004.<ref>[[David Myers (academic)|Myers, David]]. (2006). ''Psychology''. Worth Publishers; 8th edition. ISBN 978-0716764281</ref></blockquote>

==Other related terms==
The words "clairvoyance" and "psychic" are often used to refer to many different kinds of paranormal sensory experiences, but there are more specific names:

===Clairsentience (feeling/touching)===
