'''Action Against Hunger''' is a global [[humanitarian organization]] committed to ending world hunger. The organization helps malnourished children while providing communities with access to safe water and sustainable solutions to hunger.

==History==
Action Against Hunger was established in 1979 by a group of French doctors, scientists, and writers. Nobel Prize-winning physicist [[Alfred Kastler]] served as the organization's first chairman.

The group initially provided assistance to [[Afghan refugees]] in [[Pakistan]], famine-stricken [[Uganda]]n communities, and [[Cambodia]]n refugees in [[Thailand]]. It expanded to address additional humanitarian concerns in Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, the Balkans and elsewhere during the 1980s and 1990s. Action Against Hunger's Scientific Committee pioneered the therapeutic milk formula ([[F-100 (food)|F100]]), now used by all major humanitarian aid organizations to treat [[acute malnutrition]]. As a result, the global mortality rate of severely malnourished children under the age of five has been reduced from 25% to 5%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Definition and evaluation of therapeutic food for severely malnourished children in  situations of humanitarian emergencies|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10188315|publisher=PubMed}}</ref> A few years later, therapeutic milk was repackaged as ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTFs), a peanut-based paste packaged like a power bar. These bars allow for the treatment of malnutrition at home, and do not require any preparation or refrigeration.

Action Against Hunger – USA was established in 1997. The international network currently has headquarters in five countries – France, Spain, the United States, Canada, and the UK.
