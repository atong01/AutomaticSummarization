Hamming Medal|Hamming Medal]] from the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] in 1990 and the [[National Medal of Technology]] from [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] in 1999.  Ritchie was the head of [[Lucent Technologies]] [[System software|System Software]] Research Department when he retired in 2007.  He was the "R" in [[The C Programming Language|K&R C]] and commonly known by his [[User (computing)|username]] '''dmr'''.

==Personal life==
Ritchie was born in [[Bronxville, New York]]. His father was Alistair E. Ritchie, a longtime [[Bell Labs]] scientist and co-author of ''The Design of Switching Circuits'' on [[switching circuit theory]]. He moved with his family to [[Summit, New Jersey]], as a child, where he graduated from [[Summit High School (New Jersey)|Summit High School]].<ref>Keill, Liz. [http://www.nj.com/independentpress/index.ssf/2011/02/japan_prize_for_unix_was_a_sur.html "Berkeley Heights man wins Japan Prize for inventing UNIX operating system"], ''Independent Press'', February 1, 2011. Accessed October 17, 2011. "Ritchie, 69, has lived in Berkeley Heights for 15 years. He was born in Bronxville, New York, grew up in Summit and attended Summit High School before going to Harvard University."</ref> He graduated from [[Harvard University]] with [[academic degree|degree]]s in [[physics]] and [[applied mathematics]].

==Career==
[[File:Ken n dennis.jpg|thumb|[[Ken Thompson]] (left) and Dennis Ritchie (right)]]
[[File:Version 7 Unix SIMH PDP11 Emulation DMR.png|thumb|[[Version 7 Unix]] for the [[PDP-11]], including Dennis Ritchie's home directory: <tt>/usr/dmr</tt>]]

In 1967, Ritchie began working at the Bell Labs Computing Sciences Research Center, and in 1968, he defended his PhD thesis on  "Program Structure and Computational Complexity" at Harvard under the supervision of [[Patrick C. Fischer]]. However, Ritchie never officially received his PhD degree.<ref>{{cite journal |last=van Renesse |first=Robbert |date=January 2014 |title=The First SIGOPS Dennis M. Ritchie Doctoral Dissertation Award |journal=ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review |url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2626401 |volume=48 |issue=1 |page=100 |doi=10.1145/2626401.2626421}}</ref> <!-- I will have more information about this (and another reference) when I buy the book "Go To: The Story of the Math Majors, ..." (OriumX) -->

Ritchie was best known as the creator of the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], a key developer of the [[Unix]] operating system, and co-author of the book ''[[The C Programming Language]]'', and was the 'R' in ''K&R'' (a common reference to the book's authors [[Brian Kernighan|Kernighan]] and Ritchie).  Ritchie worked together with [[Ken Thompson]], the scientist credited with writing the original Unix; one of Ritchie's most important contributions to Unix was its porting to different machines and platforms.<ref>[Pioneer Programmer Shaped the Evolution of Computers, Wall Street Journal, October 14, 2011, p.A7]</ref> They were so influential on [[Research Unix]] that [[Doug McIlroy]] later wrote, "The names of Ritchie and Thompson may safely be assumed to be attached to almost everything not otherwise attributed."<ref name="reader">{{cite techreport |first1=M. D. |last1=McIlroy |authorlink1=Doug McIlroy |year=1987 |url=http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/reader.pdf |title=A Research Unix reader: annotated excerpts from the Programmer's Manual, 1971–1986 |series=CSTR |number=139 |institution=Bell Labs}}</ref>

The C language is widely used today in application, [[operating system]], and [[embedded system]] development, and its influence is seen in most modern programming languages. Unix has also been influential, establishing concepts and principles that are now precepts of computing.

Ritchie has described a 1970s collaboration with James Reeds and [[Robert Morris (cryptographer)|Robert Morris]] on a ciphertext-only attack on the [[M-209]] US cipher machine that could solve messages of at least 2000–2500 letters.<ref name="ritchiec">[https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/crypt.html Dennis M. Ritchie, Dabbling in the Cryptographic World — A Story]</ref> Ritchie relates that, after discussions with the [[NSA]], the authors decided not to publish it, as they were told the principle was applicable to machines then still in use by foreign governments.<ref name="ritchiec"/>

==Views on computing==
In an interview from 1999, Dennis Ritchie clarifies that he sees [[Linux]] and [[BSD]] operating systems as a continuation of the basis of the Unix operating system, and as derivatives of Unix:<ref name="Interview_1999">{{cite web|author=Benet, Manuel|url=http://www.linuxfocus.org/English/July1999/article79.html|title=Interview With Dennis M. Ritchie|date=1999|publisher=LinuxFocus.org}}</ref>

{{quote|I think the Linux phenomenon is quite delightful, because it draws so strongly on the basis that Unix provided. Linux seems to be among the healthiest of the direct Unix derivatives, though there are also the various BSD systems as well as the more official offerings from the [[workstation]] and [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] manufacturers.}}

In the same interview, he states that he views both Unix and Linux as "the continuation of ideas that were started by Ken and me and many others, many years ago."<ref name="Interview_1999" />

==Awards==
In 1983, Ritchie and Thompson received the [[Turing Award]]<cite> for their development of generic operating systems theory and specifically for the implementation of the UNIX operating system.</cite> Ritchie's Turing Award lecture was titled "Reflections on Software Research".<ref>{{Citation

On April 21, 1999, Thompson and Ritchie jointly received the [[National Medal of Technology]] of 1998 from President [[Bill Clinton]] for co-inventing the UNIX operating system and the C programming language which, according to the citation for the medal, "led to enormous advances in computer hardware, software, and networking systems and stimulated growth of an entire industry, thereby enhancing American leadership in the Information Age".<ref name="NationalMedalAnnouncement">''[http://www.bell-labs.com/news/1998/december/9/1.html Ritchie and Thompson &#091;to&#093; Get National Medal of Technology]'' Bell Labs pre-announcement</ref><ref name="NationalMedalPressRelease">''[http://www.bell-labs.com/news/1999/april/28/1.html Ritchie and Thompson Receive National Medal of Technology from President Clinton]'' Bell Labs press release</ref>

In 2005, the [[Industrial Research Institute]] awarded Ritchie with its [[IRI Achievement Award|Achievement Award]] in recognition of his contribution to science and technology, and to society generally, with his development of the Unix operating system.<ref>[http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/wps/portal/!ut/p/kcxml/04_Sj9SPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Y_QjzKLd4x3cg_SL8h2VAQAv8HY9g!!?LMSG_CABINET=Docs_and_Resource_Ctr&LMSG_CONTENT_FILE=News_Releases_LU_2005/LU_News_Article_005372.xml "Dennis Ritchie, Bell Labs Researcher and Co-Inventor of Unix, Receives 2005 Industrial Research Institute Achievement Award"], Alcatel-Lucent Press Release, Nov. 15, 2005, accessed Feb. 8, 2012.</ref>

*[[C (programming language)]] on which many currently used languages and technologies are based.
*[[Unix]] a multiuser operating system. Several workalikes (commonly referred to as [[Unix-like]] systems) have been developed based on Unix's design. Some of these follow [[POSIX]] standards, again based on Unix.
*''[[Man page|Unix Programmer's Manual]]'' (1971)
