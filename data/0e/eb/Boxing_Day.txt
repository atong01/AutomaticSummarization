'''Boxing Day''' is a holiday traditionally celebrated the day following [[Christmas Day]], when servants and [[tradesmen]] would receive gifts, known as a "Christmas box", from their bosses or employers,<ref name="(pseud.)1838">{{cite book|author=Parley, Peter (pseud.)|title=Tales about Christmas|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UVcEAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA323|accessdate=26 December 2011|year=1838|pages=323–8}}</ref> in the United Kingdom, Barbados, Canada, Hong Kong, Australia, Bermuda, New Zealand, Kenya, South Africa, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica and other former British colonies. Today, Boxing Day is the [[bank holiday]] that generally takes place on 26 December. <!-- Do not expand this in the Lead; it is explained correctly in the sub-section, Date -->

In South Africa, Boxing Day was renamed Day of Goodwill in 1994. Due to the Roman Catholic Church's liturgical calendar, the day is known as [[St. Stephen's Day]] to Catholics, as well as in Italy, Finland, and [[Alsace]] and [[Moselle (département)|Moselle]] in France. It is also known as both St. Stephen's Day and the Day of the Wren or [[Wren Day|Wren's Day]] in Ireland. In some European countries, most notably Germany, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands <!-- please add only sourced countries/regions --> and those in Scandinavia, 26 December is celebrated as the ''Second Christmas Day''.<ref name="Second Christmas Day">{{cite book|pages=21|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6w6u6YTsDdcC&pg=PA21|title=Christmas Facts, Figures & Fun: Facts, Figures and Fun|isbn=9781904332275|author1=Brown|first1=Cameron|date=28 August 2006}}</ref>

== Origins ==
Various competing theories for the origins of the term ''boxing day'' circulate in popular culture, none of which are definitive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/holidays/christmas/boxingday.asp|title=snopes.com: Boxing Day Origins|work=snopes.com}}</ref> However, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' gives the earliest attestations of the term as being from England in the 1830s, defining it as 'the first week-day after Christmas-day, observed as a holiday on which post-men, errand-boys, and servants of various kinds expect to receive a Christmas-box'.<ref>"Boxing-day, ''n''.", ''OED Online'', 1st edn (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1887).</ref>

The term ''Christmas-box'', meanwhile, dates back to the seventeenth century, and amongst other things meant:

:A present or gratuity given at Christmas: in Great Britain, usually confined to gratuities given to those who are supposed to have a vague claim upon the donor for services rendered to him as one of the general public by whom they are employed and paid, or as a customer of their legal employer; the undefined theory being that as they have done offices for this person, for which he has not directly paid them, some direct acknowledgement is becoming at Christmas.<ref>"Christmas-box, ''n''.", ''OED Online'', 1st edn (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1889), sense 3.</ref>

In Britain, it was a custom for tradespeople to collect "Christmas boxes" of money or presents on the first weekday after Christmas as thanks for good service throughout the year.<ref>Encyclopædia Britannica, 1953 "Boxing day"</ref> This is mentioned in [[Samuel Pepys]]' diary entry for 19 December 1663.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/12/19/ |title=Saturday 19&nbsp;December&nbsp;1663 (Pepys' Diary) |publisher=Pepysdiary.com |accessdate=26 December 2010}}</ref>
This custom is linked to an older English tradition: since they would have to wait on their masters on Christmas Day, the servants of the wealthy were allowed the next day to visit their families. The employers would give each servant a box to take home containing gifts, bonuses and sometimes leftover food.

The European tradition, which has long included giving money and other gifts to those who were needy and in service positions, has been dated to the [[Middle Ages]], but the exact origin is unknown. It is believed to be in reference to the Alms Box placed in places of worship to collect donations to the poor. Also, it may come from a custom in the late Roman/early Christian era, wherein metal boxes placed outside churches were used to collect special offerings tied to the [[St. Stephen's Day|Feast of Saint Stephen]],<ref>Collins, 2003, p. 38.</ref> which in the [[Latin Church|Western Church]] falls on the same day as Boxing Day.

==Date==
Boxing Day is a [[secular holiday]] that is traditionally celebrated on 26 December, the day after Christmas Day. 26 December is also [[St. Stephen's Day]], a [[religious holiday]].<ref>''American Heritage Dictionary'', Fourth Edition – 'Boxing Day'</ref><ref>''Oxford English''</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2004/11_november/17/radio4_sun26.shtml |title=BBC Radio 4 schedule, 3&nbsp;December&nbsp;2004 |date = 17 November 2004 |accessdate =17 December 2009}}</ref> When 26 December falls on a Sunday, Boxing Day in many Commonwealth countries and former British dominions is moved to 27 December. In the UK, Boxing Day is a [[bank holiday]]. If Boxing Day falls on a Saturday, the following Monday is given as a substitute bank holiday. On the occasion when Christmas Day is on a Saturday and 26 December on a Sunday, the following Monday, 27 December, is the substitute bank holiday for Boxing Day and Tuesday, 28 December, the substitute bank holiday for Christmas Day.

In [[Scotland]], Boxing Day has been specified as an additional bank holiday since 1974,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/46377/pages/9343 |title=London Gazette, 18&nbsp;October&nbsp;1974 |publisher=London-gazette.co.uk |date=18 October 1974 |accessdate=26 December 2010}}</ref> by [[Royal Proclamation]] under the [[Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/bank-holidays/FAQs|title=Bank Holidays in Scotland - Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2014}}</ref>

In Ireland&nbsp;– when the island as a whole was part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]&nbsp;– the [[Bank Holidays Act 1871]] established the feast day of [[St. Stephen]] as a non-movable public holiday on 26 December. Since the creation of the [[Republic of Ireland]] following [[Partition of Ireland|partition in 1920]], [[Northern Ireland]] – being part of the United Kingdom – officially reverted to use of the British name 'Boxing Day'.

In [[Australia]], Boxing Day is a federal public holiday. In the Australian state of South Australia, 28 December is a public holiday known as [[Proclamation Day]] and Boxing Day is not normally a public holiday. The holiday for Proclamation Day is observed on the first weekday after Christmas Day or the Christmas Day holiday.<ref>[http://www.safework.sa.gov.au/show_page.jsp?id=2483 Public Holidays<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
Nowadays Boxing Day is popular in Australia as the first day of a [[Test cricket]] match held at the [[MCG]] and the annual Sydney to Hobart yacht race.  A Test match is also often held in South Africa starting on Boxing Day.

In [[New Zealand]], Boxing Day is a statutory holiday; penalty rates and lieu time are provided to employees who work on the day.

In [[Canada]], Boxing Day is a federal statutory holiday. Government offices, banks and post offices/delivery are closed. In some Canadian provinces, Boxing Day is a statutory holiday<ref name="Manitoba">{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.mb.ca/labour/standards/doc,gen-holidays-after-april-30-07,factsheet.html#q13 |title = Fact Sheet |author = Manitoba Employment Standards Branch |date = 27 November 2009 |accessdate =17 December 2009}}</ref> that is always celebrated on 26 December. In Canadian provinces where Boxing Day was a statutory holiday, and it falls on a Saturday or Sunday, compensation days are given in the following week.<ref name="Manitoba"/>

In the [[United States]], Boxing Day is celebrated as a public holiday in some, mainly [[Southern United States|southern]], states: Kansas,<ref>{{cite web|title=Holidays for State of Kansas Executive Branch Employees|url=http://admin.ks.gov/offices/personnel-services/holidays|website=Department of Administration|publisher=State of Kansas|accessdate=8 October 2014|location=Topeka, KA}}</ref> Kentucky,<ref>{{cite web|title=State Holidays|url=https://personnel.ky.gov/pages/leave.aspx|website=Kentucky Personnel Cabinet|publisher=Commonwealth of Kentucky|accessdate=8 October 2014}}</ref> North Carolina,<ref>{{cite web|title=2014 Holiday Schedule|url=http://www.oshr.nc.gov/Holidays/holiday2014.pdf|website=Office of State Human Resources|publisher=State of North Carolina|accessdate=8 October 2014|location=Raleigh, NC|format=pdf}}</ref> South Carolina,<ref>{{cite web|title=South Carolina Code of Laws - Title 53 - Sundays, Holidays and Other Special Days|url=http://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/t53c005.php|website=Legislative Services Agency|publisher=State of South Carolina|accessdate=8 October 2014|location=Columbia, SC}}</ref> and Texas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Official Texas State Holidays|url=https://www.tsl.texas.gov/ref/abouttx/holidays.html|website=Texas State Library and Archives Commission|accessdate=8 October 2014|location=Austin TX}}</ref>

Boxing Day sales are common in Canada. It is a time when shops have sales, often with dramatic price reductions. For many merchants, Boxing Day has become the day of the year with the greatest number of returns. In the UK in 2009 it was estimated that up to 12 million shoppers appeared at the sales (a rise of almost 20% compared to 2008, although this was also affected by the fact that the [[VAT]] was about to revert to 17.5% from 1 January, following the temporary reduction to 15%).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8432144.stm |title=Boxing Day sales attract 'record' number of shoppers |publisher=BBC News |date=28 December 2009 |accessdate=26 December 2010}}</ref>

Many retailers open very early (typically 5&nbsp;am or even earlier) and offer [[doorbuster]] deals and [[loss leader]]s to draw people to their stores. It is not uncommon for long queues to form early in the morning of 26 December, hours before the opening of shops holding the big sales, especially at [[Big-box store|big-box consumer electronics]] retailers.<ref name="ctv.ca"/> Many stores have a limited quantity of big draw or deeply discounted items.<ref name="toronto.ctv.ca">{{cite web |url=http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20071213/boxing_day_071213?hub=EdmontonHome |title = How to become a Boxing Day shopping pro |date = 25 December 2007 |author = Ashleigh Patterson |accessdate =17 December 2009}}</ref> Because of the shoulder-to-shoulder crowds, many choose to stay home and avoid the hectic shopping experience. The local media often cover the event, mentioning how early the shoppers began queuing up, providing video of shoppers queuing and later leaving with their purchased items.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Canada/20071226/Boxing_Day_071226/ |title=Boxing Day begins with early rush of bargain hunters |author = toronto.ctv.ca |date = 26 December 2007 |accessdate =17 December 2009}}</ref> Many retailers have implemented practices aimed at managing large numbers of shoppers. They may limit entrances, restrict the number of patrons in a store at a time, provide tickets to people at the head of the queue to guarantee them a hot ticket item or canvass queued-up shoppers to inform them of inventory limitations.<ref name="toronto.ctv.ca"/>

In recent years, retailers have expanded deals to "[[Boxing Week]]". While Boxing Day is 26 December, many retailers will run the sales for several days before or after 26 December, often up to New Year's Eve. Notably, in [[Late 2000s recession|the recession of late 2008]], a record number of retailers were holding early promotions due to a weak economy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/TopStories/20081221/Shopping_Deals_081222/ |title = Boxing Day comes early as shoppers search for deals |author = CTV.ca News Staff |date = 21 December 2008 |accessdate =17 December 2009}}</ref> Canada's Boxing Day has often been compared with the American [[Super Saturday]], the Saturday before Christmas.

In some areas of Canada, particularly in [[Atlantic Canada]] and parts of [[Northern Ontario]], most retailers are prohibited from opening on Boxing Day, either by provincial law or municipal [[bylaw]], or instead by informal agreement among major retailers to provide a day of relaxation following Christmas Day. In these areas, sales otherwise scheduled for 26 December are moved to the 27th.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geschenkhexe.ch/media/archive/Boxing-Day-The-Debate-Continues.html |title=Boxing Day, The Debate Continues |author=soonews.ca |date=22 December 2007 |accessdate=26 December 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5hAtdtyDSIeYttaUmCcZLT_bGhGzg |title=Boxing Day madness: shoppers descend on stores looking for deals |author=The Canadian Press |date=26 December 2009 |accessdate=26 December 2009}}{{dead link|date=December 2011}}</ref> The city council of [[Greater Sudbury]], [[Ontario]], which was the largest city in Canada to maintain this restriction as of the early 2010s, formally repealed its store hours bylaw on 9 December 2014.<ref>[http://www.thesudburystar.com/2014/12/09/council-repeals-sudburys-store-hours-byline "Council repeals Sudbury's store hours bylaw"].

In 2009, many retailers with both online and [[High Street]] stores launched their online sales on Christmas Eve and their High Street sales on Boxing Day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geschenkhexe.ch/media/archive/IMRG-Press-Release-120m-to-be-spent-Online-on-Christmas-Day-2009.html |title = Many retailers' sales to start on Christmas Eve |date = 22 December 2009 |author = IMRG |accessdate =22 December 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/christmas/6858609/Boxing-Day-sales-start-on-Christmas-Eve.html |title = Boxing Day sales start on Christmas Eve |date = 22 December 2009 |author = Telegraph |accessdate =22 December 2009 | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref>

== Sport ==
In the United Kingdom, it is traditional for the [[Premier League]] (England), [[Scottish Premiership]] (Scotland) and [[NIFL Premiership]] (Northern Ireland), as well as the lower divisions and [[Rugby football|rugby]] leagues, to hold a full programme of [[association football|football]] and [[rugby union]] matches on Boxing Day. Traditionally, matches on Boxing Day are played against [[local derby|local rivals]]. This was originally to avoid teams and their fans having to travel a long distance to an away game on the day after Christmas Day. It also makes the day an important one in the sporting calendar. In Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, much anticipated cricket Test matches are played on Boxing Day. Prior to the formation of leagues, a number of important [[Rugby football|rugby]] fixtures took place on Boxing Day notably [[Llanelli RFC|Llanelli]] v [[London Welsh RFC|London Welsh]] and [[Leicester Tigers|Leicester]] v [[Barbarian F.C.|The Barbarians]].

In horse racing, there is the [[King George VI Chase]] at [[Kempton Park Racecourse]] in Surrey. It is the second most prestigious [[National Hunt racing|chase]] in Britain, after the [[Cheltenham Gold Cup]].

[[File:Keswick Boxing Day hunt 1962.jpg||thumb|right|276px|Boxing Day Meet of the Blencathra Foxhounds in Keswick, 1962]]

Boxing Day is one of the main days in the hunting calendar for [[list of foxhound packs of the United Kingdom|hunts]] in the UK and US, with most hunts (both mounted foxhound or harrier packs and foot packs of beagles or bassets) holding meets, often in town or village centres. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/countryside/10538429/Hundreds-of-thousands-turn-out-for-Boxing-Day-hunts.html|title=Hundreds of thousands turn out for Boxing Day hunts|date=26 December 2013|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=21 December 2014}}</ref>

Australia holds the first day of the [[Boxing Day Test]] in [[Melbourne]] at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] and the start to the [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]].

Australia's [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]] has played on Boxing Day since the 1998–99 season.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Several [[ice hockey]] contests are associated with the day. The [[IIHF World U20 Championship]] typically begins on 26 December, while the [[Spengler Cup]] also begins on 26 December in [[Davos]], Switzerland; the Spengler Cup competition includes [[HC Davos]], [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Team Canada]], and other top European Hockey teams. The [[National Hockey League]] traditionally had close to a full slate of games (10 were played in 2011<ref>{{cite web|title=NHL Hockey Schedule for December 26, 2011|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/schedulebyday.htm?date=12/26/2011|accessdate=27 August 2014}}</ref>), following the league-wide days off given for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. However, the 2013 collective bargaining agreement (which followed [[2012-13 NHL lockout|a lock-out]]) extended the league mandate of Christmas Eve and Christmas Day off to include Boxing Day, except when it falls on a Saturday, in which case the league can choose to make 23 December a league-wide off day instead for that year.<ref name="NHL CBA">{{cite web|title=National Hockey League CBA *Reference is on Page 101 - not digital page 101, the printed 101*|url=http://www.nhl.com/nhl/en/v3/ext/CBA2012/NHL_NHLPA_2013_CBA.pdf|website=http://www.nhl.com/nhl/en/v3/ext/CBA2012/NHL_NHLPA_2013_CBA.pdf|accessdate=27 August 2014}}</ref> In some African [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations, particularly Ghana, Uganda, Malawi, Zambia and Tanzania, prize fighting contests are held on Boxing Day.
