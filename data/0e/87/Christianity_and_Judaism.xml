Thus, Judaism has also been characterized as a culture or as a civilization. In his work<space/><italics><link><target>Judaism as a Civilization</target></link></italics>, the founder of the Reconstructionist Movement, Rabbi<space/><link><target>Mordecai Kaplan</target></link><space/>defines Judaism as an evolving religious civilization. One crucial sign of this is that one need not believe, or even do, anything to be Jewish; the historic definition of 'Jewishness' requires only that one be born of a Jewish mother, or that one<space/><link><target>Conversion to Judaism</target><part>convert to Judaism</part></link><space/>in accord with<space/><link><target>halakha</target><part>Jewish law</part></link>. (Today,<space/><link><target>Reform Judaism</target><part>Reform</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Reconstructionist Judaism</target><part>Reconstructionist Jews</part></link><space/>also include those born of Jewish fathers and Gentile mothers if the children are raised as Jews.)</paragraph><paragraph>To many religious<space/><link><target>Jew</target><trail>s</trail></link>, Jewish ethnicity is closely tied to their relationship with God, and thus has a strong theological component. This relationship is encapsulated in the notion that Jews are a<space/><link><target>chosen people</target></link>. For strictly observant Jews, being &quot;chosen&quot; fundamentally means that it was God's wish that a group of people would exist in a<space/><link><target>covenant (biblical)</target><part>covenant</part></link>, and would be bound to obey a certain set of laws as a duty of their covenant, and that the Children of Israel<space/><italics>chose</italics><space/>to enter into this covenant with God. They view their divine purpose as being ideally a &quot;light upon the nations&quot; and a &quot;holy people&quot; (i.e., a people who live their lives fully in accordance with Divine will as an example to others), not &quot;the one path to God&quot;. For Jews, salvation comes from God, freely given, and observance of the Law is one way of responding to God's grace.</paragraph><paragraph>Jews hold that other nations and peoples are not required (nor expected) to obey the<space/><link><target>613 Commandments</target><part>Law of Moses</part></link>, with the notable exception that the only laws Judaism believes are automatically binding (in order to be assured of a place in the<space/><link><target>Olam Haba</target><part>world to come</part></link>) on other nations are known as the<space/><link><target>Noahide Laws</target><part>Seven Laws of Noah</part></link>. Thus, as an<space/><link><target>ethnic religion</target></link>, Judaism holds that others may have their own, different, paths to God (or holiness, or &quot;salvation&quot;), as long as they are consistent with the<space/><italics>Seven Laws of Noah</italics>.</paragraph><paragraph>While ethnicity and culture play a large part in Jewish identity, they are not the only way Jews define themselves as Jews. There are secular Jews, who do use ethnicity and culture as their defining criteria. And there are religious Jews, who do not. Rather, religious Jews define their Jewishness within the context of their Judaism. In this context, a religious convert could &quot;feel&quot; more Jewish than a secular ethnic Jew. While Rabbi Kaplan defines Judaism as a civilization, there are many who would not agree, citing millennia of religious tradition and observance as more than simple civilization. Most observant Jews would say that Judaism is a love story.</paragraph><paragraph>Judaism and Christianity share the belief that there is One, True God, who is the only one worthy to be worshipped. Judaism sees this One, True God as a singular, ineffable, undefinable being. Phrases such as &quot;Ground of All Being&quot;, &quot;Unfolding Reality&quot; and &quot;Creator and Sustainer of Life&quot; capture only portions of who God is to Jews. While God does not change, our perception of God does, and so, Jews are open to new experiences of God's presence. Christianity, with a few exceptions, sees the One, True God as having triune personhood: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus) and God the Holy Spirit. God is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow, so Christians generally look to the Scriptures (both Hebrew and Christian) for an understanding of who God is.</paragraph><paragraph>Christianity is characterized by its<space/><link><target>Christian Universalism</target><part>claim to universality</part></link>, which marks a significant break from current Jewish identity and thought, but has its roots in<space/><link><target>Hellenistic Judaism</target></link>. Christians believe that Jesus represents the fulfillment of<space/><link><target>Abrahamic covenant</target><part>God's promise to Abraham and the nation of Israel</part></link>, that Israel would be a blessing to all nations. Most Christians believe that the Law was<space/><link><target>Supersessionism</target><part>&quot;completed&quot;</part></link><space/>by Jesus and has become irrelevant to<space/><link><target>Faith in Christianity</target><part>&quot;faith life&quot;</part></link>. Although Christians generally believe their religion to be very inclusive (since not only Jews but all gentiles can be Christian), Jews see Christianity as highly exclusive, because some denominations view non-Christians (such as Jews and<space/><link><target>Paganism</target><part>Pagans</part></link>) as having an incomplete or imperfect relationship with God, and therefore excluded from<space/><link><target>Grace (Christianity)</target><part>grace</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Salvation (Christianity)</target><part>salvation</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Heaven (Christianity)</target><part>heaven</part></link>, or<space/><link><target>Eternal life (Christianity)</target><part>eternal life</part></link>. For some Christians, it is the stated or &quot;confessed&quot; belief in Jesus as Savior that makes God's grace available to an individual, and salvation can come no other way (<link><target>Solus Christus</target></link><space/>in Protestantism,<space/><link><target>Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus</target></link><space/>in Catholicism, see<space/><link><target>dual covenant theology</target></link><space/>for a traditional view). In Catholicism, sanctifying grace is ordinarily received via the Sacraments, however, God can work outside of the Sacraments.<extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06701a.htm</extension><space/>Also see<space/><link><target>Invincible ignorance fallacy</target><part>&quot;Invincible Ignorance&quot;</part></link><space/>as understood in Catholic theology.</paragraph><paragraph>This crucial difference between the two religions has other implications. For example, while in a<space/><link><target>conversion to Judaism</target></link><space/>a convert must accept basic Jewish principles of faith, and renounce all other religions, the process is more like a form of adoption, or changing national citizenship (i.e. becoming a formal member of the people, or tribe), with the convert becoming a &quot;child of Abraham and Sarah.&quot; For many reasons, some historical and some religious, Judaism does not encourage its members to convert others and in fact would require the initiative from the person who would like to convert. In contrast, most Christian denominations actively seek converts, following the<space/><link><target>Great Commission</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>conversion to Christianity</target></link><space/>is generally a<space/><link><target>credo</target><part>declaration of faith</part></link><space/>(although some denominations view it specifically as adoption into a community of Christ, and orthodox Christian tradition views it as being a literal joining together of the members of<space/><link><target>Body of Christ</target><part>Christ's body</part></link>).</paragraph><paragraph>Both Christianity and Judaism have been affected by the diverse cultures of their respective members. For example, what Jews from Eastern Europe and from North Africa consider &quot;Jewish food&quot; has more in common with the cuisines of non-Jewish Eastern Europeans and North Africans than with each other, although for religious Jews all food-preparation must conform to the same laws of<space/><link><target>Kashrut</target></link>. According to non-Orthodox Jews and critical historians, Jewish law too has been affected by surrounding cultures (for example, some scholars argue that the establishment of absolute<space/><link><target>monotheism</target></link><space/>in Judaism was a reaction against the<space/><link><target>dualism</target></link><space/>of<space/><link><target>Zoroastrianism</target></link><space/>that Jews encountered when<space/><link><target>Yehud Medinata</target><part>living under Persian rule</part></link>; Jews rejected<space/><link><target>polygamy</target></link><space/>during the Middle Ages, influenced by their Christian neighbors). According to Orthodox Jews too there are variations in Jewish custom from one part of the world to another. It was for this reason that<space/><link><target>Joseph Karo</target></link>'s<space/><link><target>Shulchan Aruch</target></link><space/>did not become established as the authoritative code of Jewish law until after<space/><link><target>Moshe Isserlis</target></link><space/>added his commentary, which documented variations in local custom.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Sacred texts</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Development of the Hebrew Bible canon</arg><arg>Development of the Christian Biblical canon</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>Tanakh</target><part>Hebrew Bible</part></link><space/>is composed of three parts; the<space/><link><target>Torah</target></link><space/>(Instruction, the<space/><link><target>Septuagint</target></link><space/>translated the Hebrew to<space/><italics>nomos</italics><space/>or<space/><italics>Law</italics>), the<space/><link><target>Nevi'im</target></link><space/>(Prophets) and the<space/><link><target>Ketuvim</target></link><space/>(Writings). Collectively, these are known as the<space/><link><target>Tanakh</target></link>. According to<space/><link><target>Rabbinic Judaism</target></link><space/>the Torah was revealed by God to Moses; within it, Jews find<space/><link><target>613 Mitzvot</target></link><space/>(commandments).</paragraph><paragraph>Rabbinic tradition asserts that God revealed two Torahs to Moses, one that was written down, and one that was transmitted orally. Whereas the written Torah has a fixed form, the<space/><link><target>Oral Torah</target></link><space/>is a living tradition that includes not only specific supplements to the written Torah (for instance, what is the proper manner of<space/><italics><link><target>shechita</target></link></italics><space/>and what is meant by &quot;Frontlets&quot; in the<space/><link><target>Shema</target></link>), but also procedures for understanding and talking about the written Torah (thus, the Oral Torah revealed at Sinai includes debates among rabbis who lived long after Moses). The Oral Law elaborations of narratives in the Bible and stories about the rabbis are referred to as<space/><italics><link><target>aggadah</target></link></italics>. It also includes elaboration of the 613 commandments in the form of laws referred to as<space/><italics><link><target>halakha</target></link></italics>. Elements of the Oral Torah were committed to writing and edited by<space/><link><target>Judah HaNasi</target></link><space/>in the<space/><link><target>Mishnah</target></link><space/>in 200 CE; much more of the Oral Torah were committed to writing in the<space/><link><target>Babylonian Talmud</target><part>Babylonian</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Jerusalem Talmud</target><trail>s</trail></link>, which were edited around 600 CE and 450 CE, respectively. The Talmuds are notable for the way they combine law and lore, for their explication of the<space/><link><target>midrash</target><trail>ic</trail></link><space/>method of interpreting tests, and for their accounts of debates among rabbis, which preserve divergent and conflicting interpretations of the Bible and legal rulings.</paragraph><paragraph>Since the transcription of the Talmud, notable rabbis have compiled law codes that are generally held in high regard: the<space/><link><target>Mishneh Torah</target></link>, the<space/><link><target>Arba'ah Turim</target><part>Tur</part></link>, and the<space/><link><target>Shulchan Aruch</target></link>. The latter, which was based on earlier codes and supplemented by the commentary by<space/><link><target>Moshe Isserles</target></link><space/>that notes other practices and customs practiced by Jews in different communities, especially among Ashkenazim, is generally held to be authoritative by Orthodox Jews. The<space/><link><target>Zohar</target></link>, which was written in the 13th century, is generally held as the most important esoteric treatise of the Jews.</paragraph><paragraph>All contemporary Jewish movements consider the Tanakh, and the Oral Torah in the form of the Mishnah and Talmuds as sacred, although movements are divided as to claims concerning their divine revelation, and also their authority. For Jews, the Torah - written and oral - is the primary guide to the relationship between God and man, a living document that has unfolded and will continue to unfold whole new insights over the generations and millennia. A saying that captures this goes, &quot;Turn it [the Torah's words] over and over again, for everything is in it.&quot;</paragraph><paragraph>Christians accept the Written Torah and other books of the<space/><link><target>Hebrew Bible</target></link><space/>(alternatively called<space/><link><target>Old Testament</target></link>) as<space/><link><target>Scripture</target></link>, although they generally give readings from the<space/><link><target>Koine Greek</target></link><space/><link><target>Septuagint</target></link><space/>translation instead of the<space/><link><target>Biblical Hebrew</target></link>/<link><target>Biblical Aramaic</target></link><space/><link><target>Masoretic Text</target></link>.

Although a Jewish convert to Christianity may still be categorised a Jew according to a strict interpretation of the '''''halakhah''''' (Jewish law), most Jews are adamantly opposed to the idea that one can convert to Christianity and still remoan a Jew or be considered part of Jewish life. From a mainstream Christian perspective Messianic Judaisms can also provoke hostility for misrepresenting Christianity.

Both religions reject<space/><link><target>atheism</target></link><space/>on one hand and<space/><link><target>polytheism</target></link><space/>on the other.</paragraph><paragraph>Both religions agree that God shares both transcendent and immanent qualities. How these religions resolve this issue is where the religions differ. Christianity posits that God exists as a<space/><link><target>Trinity</target></link>; in this view God exists as three distinct persons who share a single divine<space/><link><target>Ousia</target><part>essence</part></link>, or<space/><link><target>Consubstantiality</target><part>substance</part></link>. In those three there is one, and in that one there are three; the one God is indivisible, while the three persons are distinct and unconfused,<space/><link><target>God the Father</target></link>,<space/><link><target>God the Son</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>God the Holy Spirit</target></link>. It teaches that God became especially immanent in physical form through the<space/><link><target>Incarnation (Christianity)</target><part>Incarnation</part></link><space/>of God the Son who was born as<space/><link><target>Jesus of Nazareth</target></link>, who is believed to be at once<space/><link><target>Hypostatic union</target><part>fully God and fully human</part></link>. There are denominations self-describing as Christian who question one or more of these doctrines, however, see<space/><link><target>Nontrinitarianism</target></link>. By contrast, Judaism sees God as a<space/><link><target>Divine simplicity</target><part>single entity</part></link>, and views trinitarianism as both incomprehensible and a violation of the Bible's teaching that God is one. It rejects the notion that Jesus or any other object or living being could be 'God', that God could have a literal 'son' in physical form or is divisible in any way, or that God could be made to be joined to the<space/><link><target>Nature</target><part>material world</part></link><space/>in such fashion. Although Judaism provides Jews with a word to label God's transcendence (<italics><link><target>Ein Sof</target></link></italics>, without end) and immanence (<italics><link><target>Shekhinah</target></link></italics>, in-dwelling), these are merely human words to describe two ways of experiencing God; God is one and indivisible.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Shituf</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Shituf</arg></template>A minority Jewish view, which appears in some codes of<space/><link><target>halakha</target><part>Jewish law</part></link>, is that while Christian worship is polytheistic (due to the multiplicity of the Trinity), it is permissible for them to swear in God's name, since they are referring to the one God.

God's existence is a given in Judaism, and not something that most authorities see as a matter of required belief. Although some authorities see the Torah as commanding Jews to believe in God, Jews see belief in God as a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a Jewish life. The quintessential verbal expression of Judaism is the<space/><link><target>Shema Yisrael</target></link>, the statement that the God of the Bible is their God, and that this God is unique and one. The quintessential physical expression of Judaism is behaving in accordance with the 613 Mitzvot (the commandments specified in the Torah), and thus live one's life in God's ways.</paragraph><paragraph>Thus fundamentally in Judaism, one is enjoined to bring holiness into life (with the guidance of God's laws), rather than removing oneself from life to be holy.</paragraph><paragraph>Much of Christianity also teaches that God wants people to perform<space/><link><target>good works</target></link>, but all branches hold that good works alone will not lead to salvation, which is called<space/><link><target>Legalism (theology)</target><part>Legalism</part></link>, the exception being<space/><link><target>dual-covenant theology</target></link>. Some Christian denominations hold that salvation depends upon transformational faith in Jesus, which expresses itself in good works as a testament (or witness) to ones faith for others to see (primarily Eastern Orthodox Christianity and Roman Catholicism), while others (including most Protestants) hold that<space/><link><target>Sola fide</target><part>faith alone</part></link><space/>is necessary for salvation.

The first group generally uses the term &quot;faith&quot; to mean &quot;intellectual and heartfelt assent and submission.&quot; Such a faith will not be salvific until a person has allowed it to effect a life transforming conversion (turning towards God) in their being (see<space/><link><target>Ontotheology</target></link>). The Christians that hold to &quot;salvation by faith alone&quot; (also called by its Latin name &quot;<link><target>sola fide</target></link>&quot;) define faith as being implicitly<space/><link><target>ontological</target></link>mere intellectual assent is not termed &quot;faith&quot; by these groups.

Both the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church define sin more or less as a &quot;macula&quot;, a spiritual stain or uncleanliness that constitutes damage to man's image and likeness of God.</paragraph><paragraph>Hebrew has several words for sin, each with its own specific meaning. The word<space/><italics>pesha</italics>, or &quot;trespass&quot;, means a sin done out of rebelliousness. The word<space/><italics>aveira</italics><space/>means &quot;transgression&quot;. And the word<space/><italics>avone</italics>, or &quot;iniquity&quot;, means a sin done out of moral failing. The word most commonly translated simply as &quot;sin&quot;,<space/><italics>het</italics>, literally means &quot;to go astray.&quot; Just as Jewish law,<space/><italics>halakha</italics><space/>provides the proper &quot;way&quot; (or path) to live, sin involves straying from that path. Judaism teaches that humans are born with<space/><link><target>free will</target></link>, and morally neutral, with both a<space/><italics><link><target>yetzer hatov</target></link></italics>, (literally, &quot;the good inclination&quot;, in some views, a tendency towards goodness, in others, a tendency towards having a productive life and a tendency to be concerned with others) and a<space/><italics><link><target>yetzer hara</target></link></italics>, (literally &quot;the evil inclination&quot;, in some views, a tendency towards evil, and in others, a tendency towards base or animal behavior and a tendency to be selfish). In Judaism all human beings are believed to have free will and can choose the path in life that they will take. It does not teach that choosing good is impossible - only at times more difficult. There is almost always a &quot;way back&quot; if a person wills it. (Although texts mention certain categories for whom the way back will be exceedingly hard, such as the slanderer, the habitual gossip, and the malicious person)</paragraph><paragraph>The rabbis recognize a positive value to the<space/><italics>yetzer hara</italics>: one tradition identifies it with the observation on the last day of creation that God's accomplishment was &quot;very good&quot; (God's work on the preceding days was just described as &quot;good&quot;) and explain that without the yetzer ha'ra there would be no marriage, children, commerce or other fruits of human labor; the implication is that yetzer ha'tov and yetzer ha'ra are best understood not as moral categories of good and evil but as selfless versus selfish orientations, either of which used rightly can serve God's will.</paragraph><paragraph>In contrast to the Jewish view of being morally balanced,<space/><link><target>Original Sin</target></link><space/>refers to the idea that the sin of<space/><link><target>Adam and Eve</target></link>'s disobedience (sin &quot;at the origin&quot;) has passed on a spiritual heritage, so to speak. Christians teach that human beings inherit a corrupted or damaged human nature in which the tendency to do bad is greater than it would have been otherwise, so much so that human nature would not be capable now of participating in the afterlife with God. This is not a matter of being &quot;guilty&quot; of anything; each person is only personally guilty of their own actual sins.

Talmudic sages Hillel and<space/><link><target>Rabbi Akiva</target></link><space/>commented that this is a major element of the Jewish religion. Also, this commandment is arguably at the center of the Jewish faith. As the third book of the Torah, Leviticus is literally the central book. Historically, Jews have considered it of central importance: traditionally, children began their study of the Torah with Leviticus, and the midrashic literature on Leviticus is among the longest and most detailed of midrashic literature (see Bamberger 1981: 737). Bernard Bamberger considers Leviticus 19, beginning with God's commandment in verse 3&quot;You shall be holy, for I the Lord your God, am holy&quot;to be &quot;the climactic chapter of the book, the one most often read and quoted&quot; (1981:889).

Nonetheless, the Talmud teaches that &quot;If someone comes with the intention to murder you, then one is obligated to kill in self-defense [rather than be killed]&quot;. The clear implication is that to bare one's throat would be tantamount to suicide (which Jewish law forbids) and it would also be considered helping a murderer kill someone and thus would &quot;place an obstacle in front of a blind man&quot; (i.e., makes it easier for another person to falter in their ways). The tension between the laws dealing with peace, and the obligation to self-defense, has led to a set of Jewish teachings that have been described as tactical-pacifism. This is the avoidance of force and violence whenever possible, but the use of force when necessary to save the lives of one's self and one's people.</paragraph><paragraph>Although killing oneself is forbidden under normal Jewish law as being a denial of God's goodness in the world, under extreme circumstances when there has seemed no choice but to either be killed or forced to betray their religion, Jews have committed<space/><link><target>suicide</target></link><space/>or mass suicide (see<space/><link><target>Masada</target></link>,<space/><link><target>History of the Jews in France#First persecution of the Jews</target><part>First French persecution of the Jews</part></link>, and<space/><link><target>York Castle</target></link><space/>for examples).

One who serves God out of love studies the Torah and practices the precepts and walks in the way of wisdom for no ulterior motive at all, neither out of fear of evil nor in order to acquire the good, but follows the truth because it is true and the good will follow the merit of attaining to it.

On December 6 the Pope issued a statement to further emphasize that the Church continued to support its traditional stance that salvation was available to believers of other faiths: &quot;The gospel teaches us that those who live in accordance with the Beatitudes--the poor in spirit, the pure of heart, those who bear lovingly the sufferings of life--will enter God's kingdom.&quot; He further added, &quot;All who seek God with a sincere heart, including those who do not know Christ and his church, contribute under the influence of Grace to the building of this Kingdom.&quot; On August 13, 2002 American Catholic bishops issued a joint statement with leaders of<space/><link><target>Reform Judaism</target><part>Reform</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Conservative Judaism</target></link>, called &quot;Reflections on Covenant and Mission&quot;, which affirmed that Christians should not target Jews for conversion. The document stated: &quot;Jews already dwell in a saving covenant with God&quot; and &quot;Jews are also called by God to prepare the world for God's Kingdom.&quot; However, some U.S.-led Baptist and other<space/><link><target>Christian fundamentalist</target><part>fundamentalist</part></link><space/>denominations still believe it is their duty to engage in what they refer to as outreach to &quot;unbelieving&quot; Jews.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Eastern Orthodox views</heading><paragraph>Eastern Orthodox Christianity emphasizes a continuing life of repentance or<space/><italics>metanoia</italics>, which includes an increasing improvement in thought, belief and action.

Orthodox Judaism deliberately makes it very difficult to<space/><link><target>Conversion to Judaism</target><part>convert</part></link><space/>and become a Jew, and requires a significant and full-time effort in living, study, righteousness, and conduct over several years. The final decision is by no means a foregone conclusion. A person cannot become Jewish by marrying a Jew, or by joining a synagogue, nor by any degree of involvement in the community or religion, but only by explicitly undertaking intense, formal, and supervised work over years aimed towards that goal. Some less strict versions of Judaism have made this process somewhat easier but it is still far from common.</paragraph><paragraph>In the past Judaism was more evangelistic,<extension extension_name='ref'>H.H.

With the increase of the Jewish population of Rome, the Jews intensified their efforts to make converts among the Romans. Although the activity of Jewish missionaries in Roman society caused Tiberius to expel them from that city in 19 CE, they soon returned, and Jewish religious propaganda was resumed and maintained even after the destruction of the Temple. Tacitus mentions it regretfully (<italics>Histories</italics><space/>5.5), and Juvenal, in his Fourteenth Satire (11. 96ff.), describes how Roman families 'degenerated' into Judaism: the fathers permitted themselves to adopt some of its customs and the sons became Jews in every respect. ... the Bible provided the apostles of Judaism with a literature unparalleled in any other religion.&quot;</extension><space/>but this was often more akin just to &quot;greater openness to converts&quot; rather than active soliciting of conversions.
