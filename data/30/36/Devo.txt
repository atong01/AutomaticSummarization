'''Devo''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|iː|v|oʊ}}, originally {{IPAc-en|d|iː|ˈ|v|oʊ}})<ref>[http://cluefree.org/devo/Jerry.shtml The DEVO FAQ, Info from Jerry Casale]{{dead link|date=August 2015}}, cluefree.org</ref> is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in 1972, consisting of members from [[Kent, Ohio|Kent]] and [[Akron, Ohio]]. The classic line-up of the band included two sets of brothers, the Mothersbaughs ([[Mark Mothersbaugh|Mark]] and [[Bob Mothersbaugh|Bob]]) and the Casales ([[Gerald Casale|Gerald]] and [[Bob Casale|Bob]]), along with [[Alan Myers (drummer)|Alan Myers]]. The band had a No.&nbsp;14 [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' chart]] hit in 1980 with the single "[[Whip It (Devo song)|Whip It]]", and has maintained a [[cult following]] throughout its existence.

Devo's style, over time, has shifted between [[punk rock|punk]], [[art rock]], [[post-punk]] and [[New wave music|new wave]]. Their music and [[stage show]] mingle [[kitsch]] [[List of science fiction themes|science fiction themes]], [[deadpan]] [[Surreal humour|surrealist humor]], and mordantly [[satire|satirical]] [[social commentary]]. Their often [[Consonance and dissonance|discordant]] pop songs feature unusual synthetic instrumentation and [[time signature]]s that have proven influential on subsequent popular music, particularly new wave, [[industrial music|industrial]] and [[alternative rock]] artists. Devo was also a pioneer of the [[music video]], creating many memorable clips for the [[LaserDisc]] format, with "Whip It" getting heavy airplay in the early days of [[MTV]].

==History==

===Early years===
The name ''Devo'' comes "from their concept of '[[Devolution (biology)|de-evolution]]'&nbsp;— the idea that instead of continuing to evolve, mankind has actually begun to regress, as evidenced by the dysfunction and [[herd mentality]] of American society."<ref name=bio>{{cite web |url=http://www.clubdevo.com/mp/bio.html |title=Devo Bio |publisher=clubdevo.com |accessdate=2007-09-11 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071011183248/http://clubdevo.com/mp/bio.html |archivedate=2007-10-11}}</ref> In the late 1960s, this idea was developed as a joke by [[Kent State University]] art students [[Gerald Casale]] and [[Bob Lewis (musician)|Bob Lewis]], who created a number of satirical art pieces in a devolution vein. At this time, Casale had also performed with the local band 15-60-75 ([[The Numbers Band]]). They met [[Mark Mothersbaugh]] around 1970, a talented keyboardist who had been playing with the band Flossy Bobbitt.<ref name=thoughts /> Mark brought a more humorous feel to the group, introduced them to material like the pamphlet "Jocko Homo Heavenbound",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fw_alden.tripod.com/id1.html |title=Jocko-Homo Heavenbound |publisher=Fw_alden.tripod.com |accessdate=2011-08-19}}</ref> which includes an illustration of a winged devil labeled "D-EVOLUTION" and would later inspire the song "[[Jocko Homo]]". The "joke" about de-evolution became serious following the [[Kent State shootings]] of May 4, 1970. This event would be cited multiple times as the impetus for forming the band Devo.

The first form of Devo was the "Sextet Devo" which performed at the 1973 Kent State performing arts festival.<ref name =thoughts>{{cite web |author=Lewis, Robert |authorlink=Bob Lewis (musician) |title=Some thoughts on Devo: the first Postmodern Band |year=2006 |url=http://devo.devaluate.com |accessdate=2011-01-21 |format=PDF |quote=Let me be plain about this: contrary to popular belief DEVO was not and is not a phenomenon of Akron, Ohio. It was rather a logical extension of a series of inexplicable forces that made Kent State University a mass culture nexus for a brief and shining moment. |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060207091108/http://devo.devaluate.com/Devolution.doc |archivedate=2006-02-07}}</ref><ref>[http://devobook.com/sextet.html Photos of Devo's First Live Performance]</ref> It included Casale, Lewis and Mothersbaugh, as well as Gerald's brother [[Bob Casale]] on guitar, and friends [[Rod Reisman]] and [[Fred Weber (singer)|Fred Weber]] on drums and vocals, respectively. This performance was filmed and a part was included on the home video ''[[The Complete Truth About Devolution]]''. This lineup performed only once. Devo returned to perform in the Student Governance Center (featured prominently in the film) at the 1974 Creative Arts Festival with a line-up including the Casale brothers, Bob Lewis, Mark Mothersbaugh, and Jim Mothersbaugh on drums.

The band continued to perform, generally as a quartet, but with a fluid lineup including Mark's brothers [[Bob Mothersbaugh]] and [[Jim Mothersbaugh]]. Bob played electric guitar, and Jim provided percussion using a set of homemade [[electronic drum]]s. Their first two music videos, "Secret Agent Man" and "Jocko Homo" featured on ''[[The Truth About De-Evolution]]'', were filmed in [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]], and Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, the hometown of most members. This lineup of Devo lasted until 1976 when Jim left the band. Bob Lewis would sometimes play guitar during this period. In concert, Devo would often perform in the guise of [[Characters in Devo music videos|theatrical characters]], such as [[Booji Boy]] and The Chinaman. Live concerts from this period were often confrontational, and would remain so until 1977. A recording of an early Devo performance from 1975 with the quartet lineup appears on ''[[DEVO Live: The Mongoloid Years]]'', ending with the promoters unplugging Devo's equipment.<ref name=bio />

Following Jim Mothersbaugh's departure, Bob Mothersbaugh found a new drummer, [[Alan Myers (drummer)|Alan Myers]], who played on a conventional, acoustic [[drum set]]. Casale re-recruited his brother Bob Casale, and the line-up of Devo remained the same for nearly ten years.
[[File:Devo Jocko Homo Mongoloid.jpg|thumb|right|The front and back covers of Devo's first release, the [[45rpm]] [[single (music)|single]] "[[Mongoloid (song)|Mongoloid]]" b/w "[[Jocko Homo]]" (1977), released on the band's [[Booji Boy Records]]]]

===1975–1980===
Devo gained some fame in 1976 when the short film ''[[The Truth About De-Evolution]]'' by Chuck Statler<ref>Liner notes to Devo, "Mongoloid" b/w "Jocko Homo". [[Booji Boy Records]], 1977, which say "'Jocko Homo' – from the soundtrack of 'In the Beginning Was the End...(the truth about De-Evoluation)' ''a film by Chuck Statler''." (emphasis added)</ref> won a prize at the [[Ann Arbor Film Festival]]. This attracted the attention of [[David Bowie]], who began work to get the band a recording contract with [[Warner Music Group]]. In 1977 Devo were asked by [[Neil Young]] to participate in the making of his film ''[[Human Highway]]''.<ref>[http://vermontreview.tripod.com/Interviews/devo.htm Oh Yes, It’s Devo: An Interview with Jerry Casale], Brian L. Knight, ''The Vermont Review''. Retrieved December 15, 2007. vermontreview.tripod.com</ref> Released in 1982, the film featured the band as "Nuclear garbagemen." The band members were asked to write their own parts and Mark Mothersbaugh scored and recorded much of the soundtrack, his first of many.<ref>{{cite web |last=Zulaica |first=Don |url=http://www.livedaily.com/news/2987.html |title=liveDaily Interview: Mark Mothersbaugh on soundtracks, surf and Devo |date=April 25, 2001 |publisher=liveDaily.com |accessdate=2007-09-05 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070930201817/http://www.livedaily.com/news/2987.html |archivedate=2007-09-30}}</ref>

In 1976 Devo released their first single "[[Mongoloid (song)|Mongoloid]]" b/w "[[Jocko Homo]]", the B-side of which came from the soundtrack to ''The Truth About De-Evolution'', on their independent label "Booji Boy." This was followed in 1977 by a [[cover version|cover]] of [[the Rolling Stones]]' ''"''[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]''".

In 1978 the ''[[Be Stiff EP]]'' was released by English independent label [[Stiff Records]], which included the single "Be Stiff" plus two previous Booji Boy releases.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/be-stiff-ep-mw0000939256|title=Devo: Be Stiff|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=13 August 2015}}</ref> "Mechanical Man", a 4 track 7" EP of demos, an apparent [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] but rumored to be put out by the band themselves, was also released that year.<ref>{{citation |url=http://devo-obsesso.com/html/7in-pgs/main/mechman-blu.html|title=Mechanical Man|accessdate=13 August 2015}}</ref>

[[File:Devo, Atlanta, Ga., Dec. 27, 1978 Agora Ballroom.jpg|thumb|left|Devo in Atlanta, Georgia, December 27, 1978:  Bob Casale and Gerald Casale]]Recommendations from David Bowie and [[Iggy Pop]] enabled Devo to secure a recording contract with [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1978. After Bowie backed out of the business deal due to previous commitments, their first album, ''[[Question: Are We Not Men? Answer: We Are Devo!|Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!]]'' was produced by [[Brian Eno]] and featured re-recordings of their previous singles "Mongoloid" and "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction".<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/q-are-we-not-men-a-we-are-devo%21-mw0000195665|title=Q: Are We Not Men A: We Are Devo!|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=13 August 2015}}</ref> On October 14, 1978, Devo gained national exposure with an appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', a week after the Rolling Stones, performing "Satisfaction" and "Jocko Homo."

After the band achieved this success, co-founder Bob Lewis asked for credit and compensation in 1978 for his contributions to the band. The band refused to negotiate, and sued Lewis in Los Angeles Superior Court,<ref name=lewisinterview>{{cite web|url=http://warmowski.wordpress.com/2010/03/01/devo-founder-bob-lewis-my-1997-interview/ |title=Interview with Bob Lewis |publisher=Warmowski.wordpress.com |accessdate=2011-08-19}}</ref> seeking a declaratory judgment stating Lewis had no rights to the name or theory of De-evolution. Lewis then filed an action in United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, alleging theft of intellectual property. During discovery, Lewis produced articles, promotional materials, documentary evidence and an interview<ref name=lewisinterview/> recorded at the [[Akron Art Museum]] following the premiere of ''In the Beginning was the End'' in which Mothersbaugh and other band members credited Lewis with developing the theory of de-evolution. The band quickly settled for an undisclosed sum.

The band followed up with ''[[Duty Now for the Future]]'' in 1979, which moved the band more towards electronic instrumentation. While not as successful as their first record, it did produce some fan favorites with the songs "Blockhead" and "The Day My Baby Gave Me a Surprize" {{sic}}, as well as a cover of the Johnny Rivers hit "[[Secret Agent Man (song)|Secret Agent Man]]". "Secret Agent Man" had been recorded first in 1974 for Devo's first film and performed live as early as 1976. In 1979 Devo traveled to Japan for the first time, and a live show from this tour was partially recorded. Devo appeared on ''[[Don Kirshner's Rock Concert]]'' in 1979, performing "Blockhead", "Secret Agent Man", "Uncontrollable Urge", and "Mongoloid". Also in 1979 [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]] --- in conjunction with LA radio station KROQ --- released ''Devotees'', a tribute album. It contained a set of covers of Devo songs interspersed with renditions of popular songs in Devo's style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-KROQ-Devotees-Album/release/1570542 |title=KROQ Devotees Album: RNSP 301 |publisher=discogs |accessdate=2011-08-19}}</ref>

Devo actively embraced the parody religion [[Church of the SubGenius]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.westword.com/music/devos-gerald-casale-were-the-predators-that-nobody-can-stop-5113527|title=DEVO'S GERALD CASALE: "WE'RE THE PREDATORS THAT NOBODY CAN STOP"|author=Murphy, Tom|date=26 July 2011|accessdate=13 August 2015}}</ref> In concert, Devo sometimes performed as their own opening act, pretending to be a [[Christian rock|Christian soft-rock]] group called "Dove (the Band of Love)", which is an [[anagram]] for "Devo". They appeared as Dove in the 1980 televangelism spoof ''[[Pray TV]]''. They also recorded music, later released on the CD ''[[E-Z Listening Disc]]'' (1987), with [[Elevator music|Muzak]] style versions of their own songs to play before their concerts.

Devo gained a new level of visibility with 1980's ''[[Freedom of Choice (album)|Freedom of Choice]]''. This album included their best-known hit, "[[Whip It (Devo song)|Whip It]]", which quickly became a [[Top 40]] hit. The album moved to an almost completely electronic sound, with the exception of acoustic drums and Bob 1's guitar. The tour for ''Freedom of Choice'' was ambitious for the band, including dates in Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands and Canada.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.huboon.com/1980.html|title=Devo Live Guide|accessdate=13 August 2015}}</ref> The band used a minimalist set including large custom light boxes which could be laid on their back to form a second, smaller stage during the second half of the set. Other popular songs from ''Freedom of Choice'' were "Girl U Want," the title track, and "Gates of Steel". The band released popular music videos for "Whip It" and "Girl U Want." Devo made two appearances on the TV show [[Fridays (TV series)|''Fridays'']] in 1980, as well as on ''Don Kirshner's Rock Concert'', ''[[American Bandstand]]'', and other shows.

===1981–1986===
In August 1981, the band's [[Devo Live (EP)|''Devo Live E.P.'']] spent [[List of number-one singles in Australia during the 1980s#1981 (Kent Music Report)|3 weeks at the top of the Australian charts]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://australianmusichistory.com/australian-singles-chart-for-1981|title=Australian Music History|accessdate=13 August 2015}}</ref> In 1982, they toured Australia and appeared on the TV show ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]''. Devo enjoyed continued popularity in Australia, where the nationally broadcast 1970s–1980s pop TV show ''Countdown'' was one of the first programs in the world to broadcast their video clips. They were given consistent radio support by Sydney-based noncommercial rock station [[Double Jay (radio network)|Double Jay]] (2JJ) and Brisbane-based independent community station Tripple Zed ([[4ZzZ]]), two of the first rock stations outside America to play their recordings. The late-night music program ''Nightmoves'' aired ''The Truth About De-Evolution''.

In 1981, Devo contributed a cover of "[[Working in the Coal Mine]]," recorded during the ''Freedom of Choice'' sessions, to the film ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]''. The band offered the song to be used in the film when Warner Bros refused to put it on the album, resulting in its success.  Warner then included it as an independent bonus single accompanying their 1981 release, ''[[New Traditionalists]]''. For this album Devo wore self-described "Utopian Boy Scout uniforms" topped with a "New Traditionalist Pomp," a plastic half-wig modeled on the hairstyle of [[John F. Kennedy]]. Among the singles from the album was "Through Being Cool," written as a reaction to their new-found fame from "Whip It," and seen as a response to new fans that misinterpreted the message behind the hit song. The album's accompanying tour featured the band performing an intensely physical show with treadmills and a large Greek temple set. That same year Devo served as [[Toni Basil]]'s backing band on [[Word of Mouth (Toni Basil album)|''Word of Mouth'']], her debut album, which included versions of three Devo songs, recorded with Basil singing lead.<ref name="Top One Hit Wonders: Mickey">{{cite web|title=Mickey — Toni Basil|url=http://toponehitwonders.com/pop/mickey-toni-basil/|publisher=Top One Hit Wonders|accessdate=2014-05-26}}</ref><ref name="Gruber: Mickey">{{cite web|last=Gruber|first=Xaque|title='Mickey' Turns 30: A Closer Look at the One and Only Toni Basil|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/xaque-gruber/toni-basil-mickey-anniversary_b_2080971.html|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=2014-05-26}}</ref>

''[[Oh, No! It's Devo]]'' followed in 1982. Produced by [[Roy Thomas Baker]], the album featured a darker, more sinister sound than its predecessors. According to Gerald Casale, the album's sound was inspired by reviewers calling them "fascist clowns" in articles.<ref>[http://www.expressmilwaukee.com/article-11426-lsdevo-is-like-the-house-band-on-the-titanicrs.html ‘Devo Is Like the House Band on the Titanic’] – expressmilwaukee.com</ref> The album's tour featured the band performing seven songs in front of a 12-foot high rear-projection screen with synchronized video, an image recreated using [[Chroma key|blue screen]] effects in the album's accompanying music videos. Devo also contributed two songs, "Theme from Doctor Detroit" and "Luv-Luv" to the 1983 [[Dan Aykroyd]] film ''[[Doctor Detroit]]'', and produced a music video for "Theme from Doctor Detroit" featuring clips from the film with live action segments.

Devo released their sixth album, ''[[Shout (Devo album)|Shout]]'', in 1984 to poor reviews. The album has been criticized for its overuse of the [[Fairlight CMI]] synthesizer and weak songwriting. However, the band's cover of the [[Jimi Hendrix]] song "'[[Are You Experienced? (song)|Are You Experienced?]]" and the accompanying music video received some praise. Following the commercial failure of ''Shout'', Warner Bros. dropped Devo from their label. Shortly after, claiming to feel creatively unfulfilled, Alan Myers left the band.<ref name=Myers /> This caused the remaining band members to abandon the plans for a ''Shout'' video LP, as well as their tour for the album. During the interim, Mark Mothersbaugh began composing music for the TV show ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]'', and released an elaborately packaged solo [[audio cassette|cassette]], ''Musik for Insomniaks,'' which was later expanded and released as two [[Compact disc|CD]]s in 1988.

===1987–1994===
In 1987, Devo reformed with new drummer David Kendrick, formerly of [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]]. Their first project was a soundtrack for the flop horror film ''[[Slaughterhouse Rock]]'', starring [[Toni Basil]]. The band released ''[[Total Devo]]'' in 1988 on [[Enigma Records]]. This album included two songs used in the ''Slaughterhouse Rock'' soundtrack. The song "Baby Doll" was used in the film ''[[Tapeheads]]'', with newly recorded Swedish lyrics, and was credited to (and shown in a music video by) a fictitious Swedish band called Cube-Squared. Devo followed this up with a world tour, and released the live album ''[[Now It Can Be Told: DEVO at the Palace]]''. However, ''Total Devo'' was not a commercial success, and received poor critical reviews.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/total-devo-19880811|title=Total Devo|publisher=Rolling Stone|author=Azerrad, Michael|date=11 August 1988|accessdate=13 August 2015}}</ref>

In 1989, members of Devo were involved in the project Visiting Kids, releasing a self-titled EP on the New Rose label in 1990.<ref>{{citation |url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/the_spawn_of_devo_the_visiting_kids|title=The Spawn of Devo: Visiting Kids|date=26 April 2012|accessdate=13 August 2015}}</ref> The group featured Mark's then-wife Nancye Ferguson, as well as David Kendrick, Bob Mothersbaugh, and Bob's daughter Alex Mothersbaugh. Their record was produced by Bob Casale and Mark Mothersbaugh, and Mark also co-wrote some of the songs. Visiting Kids appeared on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Rockula]]'', as well as on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''. A promotional video was filmed for the song "Trilobites".

In 1990 ''[[Smooth Noodle Maps]]'', Devo's last album for twenty years, was released. It too was a critical and commercial failure which, along with its only single "Post Post-Modern Man", hold the distinction of being Devo's worst-selling efforts, as both failed to appear on the U.S. charts.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/smooth-noodle-maps-mw0000689854|title=Devo: Smooth Noodle Maps|accessdate=13 August 2015}}</ref> Devo launched a European concert tour, but poor ticket sales caused it to end early. The band had a falling out soon after, but played two shows in 1991 before breaking up. Around this time, members of Devo appeared in the film ''[[Spirit of '76 (1990 film)|Spirit of '76]]'', except for Bob Mothersbaugh. Two albums of demo recordings from 1974 to 1977—''[[Hardcore Devo: Volume One]]'' (1990) and ''[[Hardcore Devo: Volume Two]]'' (1991)—were released on [[Rykodisc]], as well as an album of early live recordings, ''[[DEVO Live: The Mongoloid Years]]''.

Following the split, Mark Mothersbaugh established [[Mutato Muzika]], a commercial music production studio, along with Bob Mothersbaugh and Bob Casale.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/are-you-not-devo-you-are-mutato-2151061|title=Are you not Devo? You are Mutato|access-date=4 August 2015}}</ref> Mothersbaugh meant to further a career as a [[composer]], and the latter worked as a [[recording engineer]]. Mothersbaugh gained considerable success in [[songwriter|writing]] and producing music for television programs (starting with ''[[Pee Wee's Playhouse]]'' and perhaps most famously with ''[[Rugrats]]''), video games, cartoons, and movies (notably working alongside director [[Wes Anderson]]). David Kendrick also worked at Mutato for a period during the early 1990s. Gerald Casale began a career as a director of music videos and commercials, working with bands including [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Silverchair]], and the [[Foo Fighters]]. In the wake of Devo's dissolution, Bob Mothersbaugh attempted to start a solo career with The Bob I Band, recording an album that was never released. The tapes for this are now lost, though a bootleg recording of the band in concert has been reported.

===1995–2006===
In 1995, Devo reunited with a new recording of "[[Girl U Want]]" on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Tank Girl (film)|Tank Girl]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rosen |first=Craig |date=March 25, 1995 |title='Tank Girl' Set shoots From Hip |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=7AsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA10 |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=107 |issue=12 |pages=10, 44 |access-date=March 17, 2015}}</ref> In January 1996, Devo performed a reunion concert at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in [[Park City, Utah]]. The band performed on part of the 1996 [[Lollapalooza]] tour in the rotating Mystery Spot, with a setlist largely composed of material from their heyday between 1978 and 1982. Also in 1996, Devo released a multimedia CD-ROM [[adventure game]], ''[[Adventures of the Smart Patrol]]'' with [[Inscape (publisher)|Inscape]]. The game was not a success, but the Lollapalooza tour was received well enough to allow Devo to return in 1997 as a headliner. Devo performed sporadically from 1997 onwards. Some of their songs were used in a video game ''[[Interstate '82]]'' developed by Activision and released in 1999 ("Modern Life", "Faster and Faster" and "One Dumb Thing").

While they did not release any albums during this period, Devo recorded a number of songs for various films and compilations after their reunion, including a cover of the [[Nine Inch Nails]] hit "[[Head Like a Hole]]" for the film ''[[Police Story 3|Supercop]]''. In 2005 Devo recorded a new version of "[[Whip It (Devo song)|Whip It]]" to be used in [[Swiffer]] television commercials, a decision they have said they regretted. During an interview with the ''Dallas Observer'', Gerald Casale said, "It's just aesthetically offensive. It's got everything a commercial that turns people off has."<ref>{{cite web|last=Dearmore |first=Kelly |url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/2006-08-17/music/jihad-jerry/ |title=Jihad Jerry |publisher=DallasObserver.com |date=August 17, 2006 |accessdate=2011-08-19}}</ref> The song "Beautiful World" was also used in a re-recorded form for an ad for [[Target Corporation|Target]] stores. Due to rights issues with their back catalog, Devo has re-recorded songs for films and ads.

In 2005, Gerald Casale announced his "solo" project, [[Jihad Jerry & the Evildoers]] (the Evildoers themselves including the other members of Devo), and released the first EP, ''[[Army Girls Gone Wild]]'' in 2006. A full-length album, ''[[Jihad Jerry & the Evildoers#Mine Is Not a Holy War (2006)|Mine Is Not a Holy War]]'', was released on September 12, 2006, after a several-month delay. It features mostly new material, plus re-recordings of four obscure Devo songs: "I Need A Chick" and "I Been Refused" (from ''Hardcore Devo: Volume Two''), "Find Out" (which appeared on the single and EP of "Peek-A-Boo" in 1982), and "Beehive" (which was recorded by the band in 1974, at which point it was apparently abandoned with the exception of one appearance at a special show in 2001). Devo continued to tour actively in 2005 and 2006,<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.devo-obsesso.com/html/news_pgs/tour_05-1.html|title=Devo Live in 2005|accessdate=13 August 2015}}</ref> unveiling a new stage show at appearances in October 2006, with the Jihad Jerry character performing "Beautiful World" as an encore.

Also in 2006, Devo worked on a project with [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] known as [[Devo 2.0]]. A band of child performers was assembled and re-recorded Devo songs. A quote from the ''Akron Beacon Journal'' states, "...Devo recently finished a new project in cahoots with Disney called Devo 2.0, which features the band playing old songs and two new ones with vocals provided by children. Their debut album, a two disc CD/DVD combo entitled ''DEV2.0'', was released on March 14, 2006. The lyrics of some of the songs were changed for [[family-friendly]] airplay, which has been claimed by the band to be a play on irony of the messages of their classic hits. Mothersbaugh doesn't rule out the idea of the band gathering in the studio, eventually, to record a new Devo album."<ref>{{Cite news |last=Abram |first=Malcolm X |url=http://www.ohio.com/mld/beaconjournal/living/12412576.htm |title=Still DEVOlutionary |work=Akron Beacon Journal |date=August 18, 2005 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051026163419/http://www.ohio.com/mld/beaconjournal/living/12412576.htm |archivedate=October 26, 2005}}</ref>

In an April 2007 interview, Gerald Casale mentioned a tentative project for a [[biographical film]] about Devo's early days.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.getreadytorock.com/rock_stars/devo.htm|title=Interview: David Casale|accessdate=13 August 2015}}</ref> According to Casale, a script was supposedly in development, called ''The Beginning Was the End''. Casale stated that there might be some new Devo material coming as well, but whether this was related to the release of a film was unclear. Devo played their first European tour since 1990 in the summer of 2007, including a performance at [[Festival Internacional de Benicàssim]].

In June 2008 [[McDonald's]] released a [[Happy Meal]] toy wearing the Devo [[Energy dome]] that they named "New Wave Nigel". It was reported by [[Australian Associated Press|AAP]] that a band member had initiated legal action against McDonald's, as the hamburger chain had copied [[trademark]]ed elements of the band's look.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/4583430a12.html |title=McDonalds sued over Happy Meal toy |date=June 13, 2008 |agency=[[Australian Associated Press]] |publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=2011-09-28}}</ref> The following week it was reported a [[gag order]] had been placed on the band regarding further public statements on the matter.<ref>{{cite web |last=Thompson |first=Paul |url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/51517-devo-suing-mcdonalds-over-happy-meal-toy |title=Devo Suing McDonald's Over Happy Meal Toy | work = Pitchfork Media |date=June 26, 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080628140431/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/51517-devo-suing-mcdonalds-over-happy-meal-toy |archivedate=June 28, 2008}}</ref> By July 2008 various blogs referred to "an e-mail" from a colleague of the band's attorney that suggested the issue was "amicably resolved".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2008/07/02/whip-it-devos-law-firm-says-band-isnt-suing-over-mcdonalds-doll/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Whip It!

In December 2007, Devo released their first new single since 1990, "Watch Us Work It," which was featured in a commercial for [[Dell]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.modulatethis.com/2007/08/synth-pioneers--1.html|title=Synth Pioneers DEVO New Song "Watch Us Work It" in Dell Commercial|date=4 August 2007|accessdate=13 August 2015}}</ref> The song features a sample drum track from the ''New Traditionalists'' song "The Super Thing". The band announced in a July 23, 2007, [[MySpace]] bulletin that a full-length music video for the song was forthcoming, and the song itself was available on [[iTunes]] and [[eMusic]]. Casale said that this song was chosen from a batch of songs that the band was working on, and that also this was the closest the band had been to a new album.

In a December 5, 2007, article on [[Mutato Muzika]], ''[[LA Weekly]]'' reported that "After touring sporadically over the past decade but not releasing any new material, Devo are spending December at Mutato trying to create an album’s worth of new material and contemplating a method of dispersal in the post-record-company world."<ref>{{cite web|last=Roberts |first=Randall |url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/are-you-not-devo-you-are-mutato-2151061 |title=Are You Not Devo?

In a radio interview on April 17, 2008, Jerry stated that Mark had "killed the project" and that there would be no new Devo album. Casale, however, later stated that "We're going to finish what we started."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeoutsydney.com.au/music/devo-gerald-casale.aspx |title=Q: Are they not men? |publisher=TimeoutSydney.com |date=June 12, 2008 |accessdate=2011-08-19 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110815122357/http://www.au.timeout.com/sydney/music/features/2475/devo-gerald-casale |archivedate=2011-08-15}}</ref>

Devo's song "Gut Feeling/Slap Your Mammy" was featured in EA Sports' [[skateboard]] video game, ''Skate''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ea.com/skate/music.jsp |title=Skate |publisher=EA Sports |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071213012145/http://www.ea.com/skate/music.jsp |archivedate=2007-12-13}}</ref> The songs "Girl U Want" and "Through Being Cool" were released as downloadable content for the video game ''[[Rock Band]]'' on August 19, 2008. The song "Uncontrollable Urge" is featured in the video game ''[[Rock Band 2]]''. All three songs were rerecorded exclusively for ''Rock Band''.

Devo played in the United States, Japan, Australia, France, and Spain in the summer of 2008. Also in 2008 the band remixed the Attery Squash song "Devo Was Right About Everything" which was released on the B-side to the "[[Watch Us Work It]]" vinyl 12" single. They also remixed a song by [[Datarock]], "Computer Camp". Datarock routinely cites Devo as an influence. In 2008 a Japan exclusive [[box set]] was released containing the band's first six albums, ''[[This is the Devo Box]]''. On October 17, 2008, Devo performed a special concert at the Akron Civic Theater, their first in Akron since 1978, to promote Democratic presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]]. They were joined at the concert by fellow Akron-area musicians [[The Black Keys]] and [[Chrissie Hynde]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ohio.com/news/31221069.html |title=Devo's benefit concert whips up vote |work=Akron Beacon Journal |date=October 18, 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081019173127/http://www.ohio.com/news/31221069.html |archivedate=2008-10-19}}</ref>

Devo announced in early 2009 that they would be performing at [[SXSW]] on March 20, with a warmup show in Dallas on March 18.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.gratefulweb.com/articles/devo-sxsw|title=Devo at SXSW|accessdate=13 August 2015}}</ref> At these shows, Devo performed a new stage show utilizing synchronized video, similar to the 1982 tour, new costumes, and three new songs: "Don't Shoot, I'm a Man!", "What We Do", and "Fresh", which are tracks from their new album. All of these songs included a video backdrop for the band's performance. Devo also confirmed that they would be performing at [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] on May 6 and 8, with the performance of May 6 featuring the band performing their first album, ''[[Question: Are We Not Men? Answer: We Are Devo!|Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!]]'', in its entirety. The performance of May 8 was a "greatest hits" show, for the ATP "Fans Strike Back" event. In November 2009, Devo toured performances ''Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!'' and ''[[Freedom of Choice (album)|Freedom of Choice]]'' with two-night stands in several cities. Along with the tour, [[Warner Bros. Records]] released remastered editions of the two albums.

In April 2009 Devo debuted the music video for "[[Don't Shoot (I'm a Man)]]" on their website, through [[Vimeo]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://vimeo.com/4089275? |publisher=Vimeo |title=Don't Shoot, I'm a Man |year=2009}}</ref> In the June 2009 issue of ''Rolling Stone'', the band noted that the album's release had been pushed back to 2010 to allow for "radical remixing".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clubdevo.com/mp/news_pgs/rollingstone_june09.html |title=Devo Comeback Disc Gets Assist From LCD Soundsystem |date=June 2009 |work=Rolling Stone |publisher=clubdevo.com |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090710005029/http://www.clubdevo.com/mp/news_pgs/rollingstone_june09.html |archivedate=2009-07-10}}</ref> The album, ''[[Something for Everybody (Devo album)|Something for Everybody]]'' was eventually released in June 2010, preceded by a 12" single of "Fresh"/"What We Do".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://s82.photobucket.com/albums/j278/ChadGrisly/?action=view&current=SOMETHIN.jpg| title=SOMETHIN.jpg|author=ChadGrisly}}</ref> Earlier in the year the band had performed at one of the [[2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics]] victory concerts at Whistler Medals Plaza and donated a collection of objects to the Ohio Historical Society including an energy dome, jumpsuit, stickers, and T-shirts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ohiohistory.wordpress.com/2010/04/01/we-are-devo/ |title=We Are DEVO &#124; Ohio Historical Society Collections Blog |publisher=Ohiohistory.wordpress.com |date=April 1, 2010 |accessdate=2011-07-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ohiohistory.wordpress.com/2010/08/05/devo-visits-the-center/ |title=Devo visits the Center &#124; Ohio Historical Society Collections Blog |publisher=Ohiohistory.wordpress.com |date=August 5, 2010 |accessdate=2011-07-05}}</ref>

Devo was awarded the first [[Robert Moog|Moog]] Innovator Award on October 29, 2010, during [[Moogfest]] 2010 in [[Asheville, North Carolina]]. The Moog Innovator Award has been said to "[celebrate] pioneering artists whose genre-defying work exemplifies the bold, innovative spirit of Bob Moog".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://moogfest.com/2010/news/moogfest-2010-announces-devo-as-recipient-of-moog-innovation-award |title=MoogFest 2010 Announces Devo as Recipient of Moog Innovation Award |publisher=Moogfest.com |date=September 8, 2010 |accessdate=2011-08-19 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20111112154806/http://moogfest.com/2010/news/moogfest-2010-announces-devo-as-recipient-of-moog-innovation-award |archivedate=2011-11-12}}</ref> Devo was scheduled to perform at MoogFest, but Bob Mothersbaugh severely injured his hand three days prior, and the band was forced to cancel.

In an interview on March 3, 2011, Gerald Casale stated that he was "working on a script for a...  Devo musical" that would be aimed towards a live Broadway production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiego.com/articles/2011-03-03/devo-ask-charlie-sheen-join-band |title=Interview with Gerald Casale of Devo |publisher=Sandiego.com |date=March 3, 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-19}}</ref>

On February 14, 2012, the Devo Facebook page posted a status update that clubdevo.com would soon be launching a brand new "post-Warner Brothers" website that would feature new merchandise. On March 1, a new message from General Boy was added to the website confirming that the band had again separated from Warner Brothers. It stated that the new website would offer "new protective gear" and "unreleased material from the archives in vinyl disc format," as well as feature "WORLD-WIDE shipping...

In August 2012, the band released a single called "Don't Roof Rack Me, Bro (Seamus Unleashed)",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/08/devo-backs-seamus-dont-roof-rack-me-bro/| title= Devo Backs Seamus: 'Don't Roof Rack Me, Bro!'|date=August 16, 2012}}</ref> dedicated to Republican presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]]'s former pet dog Seamus. The title relates to the [[Mitt Romney dog incident]], which occurred in 1983 when Romney traveled twelve hours with the dog in a crate on his car's roof rack. Casale has also mentioned plans to release a collection of demos from the sessions of ''[[Something for Everybody (Devo album)|Something for Everybody]]'', with potential titles being ''Devo Opens the Vault'', ''Gems from the Devo Dumpster,'' or ''Something Else For Everybody.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/480289/devo-parts-with-warner-bros-bites-romney-in-new-song |title=Devo Parts With Warner Bros., Bites Romney in New Song |work=Billboard |date=August 23, 2012 |accessdate=2013-01-22}}</ref> The album was eventually titled ''Something Else For Everybody'' and was released on May 20, 2014.

The band toured the US and Canada in June and July 2014, playing ten dates consisting of their "experimental music" composed and recorded from 1974–1978. Planned as a 40th anniversary tour, this outing was billed as the "Hardcore Devo" tour.
