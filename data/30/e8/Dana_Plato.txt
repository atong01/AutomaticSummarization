'''Dana Michelle Plato''' (November 7, 1964 &ndash; May 8, 1999) was an American actress, notable for playing the role of [[Kimberly Drummond]] on the U.S. television [[Situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'' from 1978 to 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/person/57045/Dana-Plato|title=Dana Plato - About This Person - Movies & TV - NYTimes.com|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2015-01-26}}</ref> After leaving the cast of ''Diff'rent Strokes'', Plato attempted to establish herself as a working actress, with mixed success: she worked sporadically in made-for-TV movies and in independent films, and also did voice-over work. At age 34, after years of struggling with poverty and substance abuse, Plato died from an overdose of prescription drugs.<ref name="NYT">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/10/arts/dana-plato-34-star-of-diff-rent-strokes.html |title=’Dana Plato, 34, Star of 'Diff'rent Strokes' |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 10, 1999 |accessdate=2015-08-23}}</ref><ref name=deseret />

==Life and career==

===1964–77: Childhood and career beginnings===
Plato was born '''Dana Michelle Strain''' on November 7, 1964 in [[Maywood, California]], to Linda Strain, an unwed teenager who was already caring for an 18-month-old child. Seven months after her birth, in June 1965, she was adopted by Dean Plato, who owned a trucking company, and his wife Florine "Kay" Plato.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com|title=RootsWeb: Database Index|work=ancestry.com|accessdate=26 January 2015}}</ref> She was raised in the [[San Fernando Valley]]. When she was three, her adoptive parents divorced, and she lived with her mother.<ref name=LittleGirlLost>{{cite journal|last=Gliatto|first=Tom|date=May 24, 1999|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20128316,00.html|title=Little Girl Lost|magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]]|volume=51|issue=19|issn=0093-7673}}</ref>

Plato began attending auditions with her mother when she was very young. From the age of seven, she began appearing in television commercials; she reportedly appeared in over 100 commercials for companies as diverse as [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]], [[Dole Food Company|Dole]], and [[Atlantic Richfield]]. Plato later claimed that she was offered two highly sought-after movie roles: the role of [[spiritual possession|possessed]] child [[Regan MacNeil]] in the 1973 film ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' and the starring role in [[Louis Malle]]'s 1978 film ''[[Pretty Baby (film)|Pretty Baby]]''. According to Plato, her mother vetoed both jobs, either fearing that Plato would be [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]], or subjected to unsavory subject matter.<ref name=HowardSternShow/> However, ''Exorcist'' creator [[William Peter Blatty]] said he had "no such recollection" of Plato being offered the role. Plato made her film debut at the age of 12 in the 1977 horror film ''[[Return to Boggy Creek]]''.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/41121/Return-to-Boggy-Creek/cast|title=Return to Boggy Creek}}</ref> Other early credits included ''[[Exorcist II: The Heretic]]'' (1977) and ''[[California Suite (film)|California Suite]]'' (1978).

In addition to her acting career, Plato was also an accomplished figure skater; at one point she trained for a possible [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] team spot. It was during this time that she made a brief appearance on TV's ''[[The Gong Show]]'' and was spotted by a producer who helped her secure what became her most famous acting role, that of Kimberly Drummond on ''Diff'rent Strokes.'' According to Plato, her mother decided that she should cut back on her skating in order to focus on the role.

===1978–86: ''Diff'rent Strokes''===
{{Main|Diff'rent Strokes}}
''Diff'rent Strokes'' debuted on [[NBC]] in 1978, becoming an immediate hit. The show features Phillip Drummond ([[Conrad Bain]]), a wealthy white widower in New York City who adopts two black boys after the death of their parents. Plato played Kimberly, Drummond's teenage daughter, who at the start of the show becomes the sister of the two boys, Willis ([[Todd Bridges]]) and Arnold ([[Gary Coleman]]). Plato appeared on the show from 1978 until 1984 and again from 1985 to 1986; during her tenure the show appeared on two different networks. 

[[Image:Dana Plato in 1983.jpg|right|thumb|Plato in 1983]]

During her years on ''Diff'rent Strokes'', Plato struggled with drug and alcohol problems. She admitted to drinking and using [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and [[cocaine]], and she suffered an overdose of [[diazepam]] when she was 14.<ref name=LittleGirlLost/> In December 1983, Plato moved in with her boyfriend, rock guitarist [[Lanny Lambert]]. The couple married on April 24, 1984, and their only child, Tyler Edward Lambert, was born on July 2, 1984.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.familytreelegends.com/records/39461|title=Free Family Tree, Genealogy and Family History - MyHeritage|work=familytreelegends.com}}</ref><ref name="abcnews">{{cite news |first1=Luchina|last1=Fisher |first2=Sheila|last2=Marikar |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/dana-platos-son-tyler-lambert-commits-suicide-mom/story?id=10629167 |title=Growing Pains: The Trials and Tribulations of 1980s TV Child Stars |work=ABC News |date=May 13, 2010 |accessdate=2015-08-23}}</ref> During this time, Plato was let go from ''Diff'rent Strokes'' because the producers did not feel that a pregnancy would fit the show's wholesome image. Although rumors of drug use and other problems on the set surrounded her dismissal, the producers were adamant that Plato's pregnancy was the only reason her character was written out. She returned for several appearances during the show's seventh and eighth seasons, including an episode that aired on January 17, 1986 and was Plato's final appearance on the show, in which Kimberly suffers from the effects of [[bulimia]].

===1987–98: After ''Diff'rent Strokes''===
After leaving ''Diff'rent Strokes'', Plato attempted to establish herself as a serious actress, but found it difficult to achieve success outside of her sitcom career. She had [[breast implant]]s and modeled for a June 1989 ''[[Playboy]]'' pictorial, but her career remained in stagnation, and she started taking roles in such [[B-movies]] as ''Bikini Beach Race'' (1989) and ''Lethal Cowboy'' (1992). Plato separated from Lambert in January 1988, the same week her mother died of [[scleroderma]]. In desperation over these traumatic events, she signed over [[power of attorney]] to an accountant who disappeared with the majority of her money, leaving her with no more than $150,000. She claimed that the accountant was never found or prosecuted, despite an exhaustive search, and that he had also stolen more than $11 million of other people's money.<ref name=HowardSternShow/>

During their March 1990 divorce, Plato lost custody of her son to Lambert and was given visitation rights.<ref name=LittleGirlLost/><ref name="abcnews"/> She moved to Las Vegas, where she struggled with poverty and unemployment. At one point she worked at a dry-cleaning store, where customers reported being impressed by her lack of airs.<ref name=LittleGirlLost/> On February 28, 1991, she entered a video store, produced a gun, and demanded the money in the register. The clerk called [[9-1-1|911]] saying, "I've just been robbed by the girl who played Kimberly on ''Diff'rent Strokes''." Approximately 15 minutes after the robbery, Plato returned to the scene and was immediately arrested. The gun was only a [[pellet gun]] and the robbery netted Plato $164.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sporkin|first=Elizabeth|date=March 24, 1991|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20114736,00.html|title=Diff'rent Strokes, Fallen Stars|magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]]|volume=35|issue=11}}</ref> Las Vegas entertainer [[Wayne Newton]] posted her $13,000 bail.<ref name=reelReviews>''[http://www.franksreelreviews.com/shorttakes/plato.htm The Death of Dana Plato]'' at Morbidly Hollywood</ref> Plato was given five years' [[probation]]. She made headlines and became a subject of the national debate surrounding troubled child stars, particularly given the difficulties of her ''Diff'rent Strokes'' co-stars Gary Coleman and Todd Bridges. In January 1992, she was arrested again, this time for forging a prescription for Diazepam. She served 30 days in jail for violation of the terms of her probation and entered a drug rehabilitation program immediately thereafter.

In 1992, Plato was one of the first celebrities to star in a video game. The game, ''[[Night Trap]]'', was not a great success, but is considered a pioneering title because it was the first game to use live actors, specifically a well-known personality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-cd/night-trap |title=MobyGames Page on Night Trap |publisher=MobyGames |accessdate=2010-08-02}}</ref>  It was one of the first video game titles to have mature content and attracted controversy due to its depiction of violence.<ref>{{cite book |last=Slaven|first=Andy |title=Video Game Bible, 1985-2002 |year=2002 |publisher=Trafford Publishing |page=297 |isbn=1-55369-731-6}}</ref> The controversy, along with that surrounding ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'', eventually led to the creation of the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=A.V.

Toward the end of her career, Plato chose roles that could be considered [[erotic]] and [[softcore pornography|softcore]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/172923/Different-Strokes-The-Story-of-Jack-Jill-and-Jill/overview |title=Different Strokes: The Story of Jack & Jill... and Jill (1997) |date= |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher= |accessdate=2014-02-06}}</ref> She appeared nude in ''Prime Suspect'' (1989) and ''Compelling Evidence'' (1995), and in the softcore erotic drama ''[[Different Strokes (film)|Different Strokes: The Story of Jack and Jill...and Jill]]'' (1997), whose title was changed after filming in order to tie it to Plato's past. Following her appearance in the film, in 1998, Plato appeared in a cover story of the lesbian lifestyle magazine ''[[Girlfriends magazine|Girlfriends]]'', in which she [[coming out|came out]] as a [[lesbian]], although she later recanted. 

She became engaged to [[Fred Potts (film director)|Fred Potts]] a filmmaker and close friend of [[Johnny Whitaker]], but the romance soon broke up and she returned to drugs.<ref name=LittleGirlLost/> Just before her death, she was engaged to her manager Robert Menchaca, with whom she lived in a motor home in [[Navarre, Florida]].<ref name=reelReviews />

===1999: Final interview and death===
On May 7, 1999, the day before she died, Plato appeared on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]''. She spoke about her life, discussing her financial problems and her past run-ins with the law. She admitted to being a recovering alcoholic and drug addict, but claimed that she had been sober for more than ten years by that point, and was not using any drugs, with the exception of prescribed painkillers due to the recent extraction of her teeth. Many callers insulted her and questioned her sobriety, which provoked a defiant Plato, who offered to take a drug test on the air. Some callers, as well as host [[Howard Stern]], came to Plato's defense.<ref name=HowardSternShow>Dana Plato's final [http://www.sitcomsonline.com/sounds/dana_plato_05-07-99.ra interview] with [[Howard Stern]]</ref>

The next day, Plato and Menchaca were returning to California, the couple stopped at Menchaca's mother's home in [[Moore, Oklahoma|Moore]], [[Oklahoma]], for a [[Mother's Day]] visit.<ref name=LittleGirlLost/> Plato went to lie down inside her [[Winnebago Industries|Winnebago]] motor home parked outside the house, where she died of an overdose of the painkiller [[Hydrocodone/paracetamol|Lortab]] and the muscle-relaxant [[Carisoprodol|Soma]]. Her death was eventually ruled a suicide.<ref>{{cite journal|last=O'Neill|first=Anne-Marie|date=June 7, 1999|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20128431,00.html|title=Seeking Serenity|magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]]|volume=51|issue=20}}</ref> Her body was cremated.<ref>{{cite book|last=Benoit|first=Tod |title=Where Are They Buried?: How Did They Die?
