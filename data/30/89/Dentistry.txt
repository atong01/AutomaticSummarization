'''Dentistry''' is a branch of [[medicine]] that is involved in the study, [[diagnosis]], prevention, and treatment of [[diseases]], disorders and conditions of the [[mouth|oral cavity]], commonly in the [[dentition]]  but also the [[oral mucosa]], and of adjacent and related structures and tissues, particularly in the maxillofacial (jaw and facial) area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ada.org/glossaryforprofessionals.aspx|title=Glossary of Dental Clinical and Administrative Terms|publisher=[[American Dental Association]]|accessdate=1 February 2014}}</ref> Although primarily associated with [[teeth]] among the general public, the field of dentistry or dental medicine is thus not limited to '''odontology''' (from [[Ancient Greek]] ὀδούς (odoús, "tooth")) – the study of the structure, development, and abnormalities of the teeth. Because of their substantial overlap in concept, dentistry is often also understood to subsume the now largely defunct [[medical specialty]] of [[stomatology]] (the study of the mouth and its disorders and diseases) for which reason the two terms are used interchangeably in certain regions.

Dentistry is widely considered important for overall health. Dental treatment is carried out by the dental team, which often consists of a [[dentist]] and [[Dental auxiliary|dental auxiliaries]] ([[dental assistant]]s, [[dental hygienist]]s, [[dental technician]]s, and [[dental therapist]]s). Most dentists work in private practices ([[primary care]]), although some work in hospitals ([[secondary care]]) and institutions (prisons, armed forces bases, etc.).

The history of dentistry is almost as ancient as the history of humanity and civilization with the earliest evidence dating from 7000 BC. Remains from the early Harappan periods of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (c. 3300 BC) show evidence of teeth having been drilled dating back 9,000 years.<ref name="bbc">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4882968.stm | work=BBC News | title=Stone age man used dentist drill | date=6 April 2006 | accessdate=24 May 2010}}</ref> It is thought that dental surgery was the first specialization from [[medicine]].<ref name=Suddick1990>{{cite journal|last=Suddick|first=RP|author2=Harris, NO|title=Historical perspectives of oral biology: a series|journal=Critical reviews in oral biology and medicine : an official publication of the American Association of Oral Biologists|date=1990|volume=1|issue=2|pages=135–51|doi=10.1177/10454411900010020301|pmid=2129621}}</ref>

==Dental treatment==
Dentistry usually encompasses very important practices related to the oral cavity. Oral diseases are major public health problems due to their high incidence and prevalence across the globe with the disadvantaged affected more than other socio-economic groups.<ref>The World Oral Health Report 2003: continuous improvement of oral health in the 21st century – the approach of the WHO Global Oral Health Programme</ref>

The majority of dental treatments are carried out to prevent or treat the two most common [[Dental disease|oral diseases]] which are [[dental caries]] (tooth decay) and [[periodontal disease]] (gum disease or pyorrhea). Common treatments involve the [[dental restoration|restoration of teeth]], [[dental extraction|extraction]] or surgical removal of teeth, [[scaling and root planing]] and endodontic [[endodontic therapy|root canal]] treatment.

All dentists in the United States undergo at least three years of undergraduate studies, but nearly all complete a bachelor's degree.  This schooling is followed by four years of dental school to qualify as a "[[Doctor of Dental Surgery]]" (DDS) or "[[Doctor of Dental Medicine]]" (DMD). Dentists need to complete additional qualifications or continuing education to carry out more complex treatments such as [[sedation]], [[oral and maxillofacial surgery]], and [[dental implant]]s.

By nature of their general training they can carry out the majority of dental treatments such as restorative (fillings, [[crown (dentistry)|crowns]], [[bridge (dentistry)|bridges]]), prosthetic ([[dentures]]), endodontic (root canal) therapy, periodontal (gum) therapy, and extraction of teeth, as well as performing examinations, radiographs (x-rays) and diagnosis. Dentists can also prescribe medications such as [[antibiotic]]s, [[sedative]]s, and any other drugs used in patient management.

Dentists also encourage prevention of oral diseases through proper [[hygiene]] and regular, twice yearly, checkups for professional cleaning and evaluation. Conditions in the oral cavity may be indicative of systemic diseases such as [[osteoporosis]], [[diabetes]], or [[cancer]]. Many studies have also shown that [[gum disease (disambiguation)|gum disease]] is associated with an increased risk of diabetes, [[heart disease]], and [[preterm birth]]. The concept that oral health can have an impact on systemic health and disease is referred to as "oral-systemic health".

{{Main|Dentistry throughout the world}}
[[File:Early dental chair, Shamrock, TX IMG 6151.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Early dental chair in [[Pioneer West Museum]] in [[Shamrock, Texas]]]]

Dr. John M. Harris started the world's first dental school in [[Bainbridge, Ross County, Ohio|Bainbridge, Ohio]], and helped to establish dentistry as a health profession. It opened on 21 February 1828, and today is a [[Harris Dental Museum|dental museum]].<ref>Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1217–1218.</ref> The first dental college, [[Baltimore College of Dental Surgery]], opened in Baltimore, Maryland, USA in 1840. Philadelphia Dental College was founded in 1863 and is the second in the United States. In 1907 Temple University accepted a bid to incorporate the school.

Studies showed that dentists graduated from different countries,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zadik Yehuda|author2=Levin Liran |title=Clinical decision making in restorative dentistry, endodontics, and antibiotic prescription |journal=J Dent Educ |volume=72 |issue=1 |pages=81–6 |date=January 2008 |pmid=18172239 }}</ref> or even from different dental schools in one country,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zadik Yehuda|author2=Levin Liran |title=Decision making of Hebrew University and Tel Aviv University Dental Schools graduates in every day dentistry—is there a difference? |journal=J Isr Dent Assoc |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=19–23 |date=April 2006 |pmid=16886872 }}</ref> may have different clinical decisions for the same clinical condition.

In Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Finland, Sweden, Brazil, Chile, the United States, and Canada, a dentist is a healthcare professional qualified to practice dentistry after graduating with a degree of either Doctor of Dental Surgery ([[Doctor of Dental Surgery|DDS]]) or Doctor of Dental Medicine ([[Doctor of Dental Medicine|DMD]]). This is equivalent to the Bachelor of Dental Surgery/Baccalaureus Dentalis Chirurgiae ([[Bachelor of Dental Surgery|BDS, BDent, BChD, BDSc]]) that is awarded in the UK and British Commonwealth countries. In most western countries, to become a qualified dentist one must usually complete at least four years of postgraduate study{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}; within the [[European Union]] the education has to be at least five years. Dentists usually complete between five and eight years of post-secondary education before practising. Though not mandatory, many dentists choose to complete an internship or residency focusing on specific aspects of dental care after they have received their dental degree.

==Specialties {{anchor|Specialities<!--alt spelling-->}}==
{{Main|Specialty (dentistry)}}
Some dentists undertake further training after their initial degree in order to specialize. Exactly which subjects are recognized by dental registration bodies varies according to location. Examples include:

* [[Dental public health]] – The study of [[epidemiology]] and social health policies relevant to oral health
* [[Endodontics]] (also called endodontology) – [[Root canal therapy]] and study of diseases of the [[dental pulp]] and periapical tissues.
* [[Forensic odontology]] – The gathering and use of dental evidence in law. This may be performed by any [[dentist]] with experience or training in this field. The function of the forensic dentist is primarily documentation and verification of identity.
* [[Geriatric dentistry]] or Geriodontics – The delivery of dental care to older adults involving the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of problems associated with normal aging and age-related diseases as part of an interdisciplinary team with other health care professionals.
* [[Oral and maxillofacial pathology]] – The study, diagnosis, and sometimes the treatment of oral and maxillofacial related diseases.
* [[Oral and maxillofacial radiology]] – The study and radiologic interpretation of oral and maxillofacial diseases.
* [[Oral and maxillofacial surgery]] (also called oral surgery) – [[Extraction (dental)|Extractions]], [[Dental implant|implants]], and surgery of the jaws, mouth and face.<ref group="nb">The scope of Oral and maxillofacial surgery is variable. In some countries, both a medical and dental degree is required for training, and the scope includes head and neck oncology and craniofacial deformity.</ref>
* [[Oral biology]] – Research in dental and craniofacial biology
* [[Oral Implantology]] – The art and science of replacing extracted teeth with dental implants.
* [[Oral medicine]] – The clinical evaluation and [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] of [[oral cavity|oral]] [[oral mucosa|mucosal]] [[oral pathology|disease]]s
* [[Orthodontics]] and [[dentofacial orthopedics]]  – The straightening of teeth and modification of midface and mandibular growth.
* [[Pediatric dentistry]] (also called pedodontics) – Dentistry for children
* [[Periodontology]] (also called periodontics) – The study and treatment of diseases of the [[periodontium]] (non-surgical and surgical) as well as placement and maintenance of dental implants
* [[Prosthodontics]] (also called prosthetic dentistry) – [[Denture]]s, [[Bridge (dentistry)|bridges]] and the restoration of implants. Some prosthodontists further their training in "oral and maxillofacial prosthodontics", which is the discipline concerned with the replacement of missing facial structures, such as ears, eyes, noses, etc.
* [[Special needs dentistry]] (also called special care dentistry) – Dentistry for those with developmental and acquired disabilities.
* [[Veterinary dentistry]], a speciality of [[veterinary medicine]] – The field of dentistry applied to the care of animals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avdc.org/ |title=AVDC Home |publisher=Avdc.org |date=29 November 2009 |accessdate=18 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evdc.info/ |title=EVDC web site |publisher=Evdc.info |accessdate=18 April 2010}}</ref>

Historically, dental extractions have been used to treat a variety of illnesses. During the [[Middle Ages]] and throughout the 19th century, dentistry was not a profession in itself, and often dental procedures were performed by barbers or general [[physician]]s. [[Barber]]s usually limited their practice to extracting teeth which alleviated [[pain]] and associated chronic tooth [[infection]]. Instruments used for dental extractions date back several centuries. In the 14th century, [[Guy de Chauliac]] invented the dental pelican<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.dmd.co.il/antiques |title=Antique Dental Instruments |publisher=Dmd.co.il |accessdate=18 April 2010}}</ref> (resembling a [[pelican]]'s beak) which was used to perform [[dental extraction]]s up until the late 18th century. The pelican was replaced by the [[dental key]]<ref name="autogenerated1" /> which, in turn, was replaced by modern forceps in the 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
[[Image:Device-teeth-fauchard.jpg|thumb|150px|Dental [[needle-nose pliers]] designed by Fauchard in the late 17th century to use in [[prosthodontics]].]]

The first book focused solely on dentistry was the "Artzney Buchlein" in 1530,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://completedentalguide.co.uk/history-of-dentistry/|title=History Of Dentistry|work=Complete Dental Guide}}</ref> and the first dental textbook written in English was called "Operator for the Teeth" by Charles Allen in 1685.<ref name="bdatimeline">[http://www.bda.org/museum/the-story-of-dentistry/timeline.aspx The story of dentistry: Dental History Timeline], hosted on the British Dental Association website.

In the United Kingdom there was no formal qualification for the providers of dental treatment until 1859 and it was only in 1921 that the practice of dentistry was limited to those who were professionally qualified. The [[Royal Commission on the National Health Service]] in 1979 reported that there were then more than twice as many registered dentists per 10,000 population in the UK than there were in 1921.<ref>{{cite book|title=Royal Commission on the NHS Chapter 9|date=July 1979|publisher=HMSO|isbn=0101761503|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/royal-commission-on-the-national-health-service-contents/royal-commission-on-the-nhs-chapter-9/|accessdate=19 May 2015}}</ref>

===Modern dentistry===
It was between 1650 and 1800 that the science of modern dentistry developed. The English physician [[Thomas Browne]] in his ''[[A Letter to a Friend]]'' (pub. post. 1690) made an early dental observation with characteristic humour –

{{Quote|The Egyptian Mummies that I have seen, have had their Mouths open, and somewhat gaping, which affordeth a good opportunity to view and observe their Teeth, wherein 'tis not easie to find any wanting or decayed: and therefore in Egypt, where one Man practised but one Operation, or the Diseases but of single Parts, it must needs be a barren Profession to confine unto that of drawing of Teeth, and little better than to have been Tooth-drawer unto King Pyrrhus, who had but two in his Head.}}

The French surgeon [[Pierre Fauchard]] became known as the "father of modern dentistry". Despite the limitations of the primitive surgical instruments during the late 17th and early 18th century, Fauchard was a highly skilled [[surgeon]] who made remarkable improvisations of dental instruments, often adapting tools from [[watch|watch makers]], [[jeweler]]s and even [[barber]]s, that he thought could be used in dentistry. He introduced [[dental filling]]s as treatment for [[dental cavities]]. He asserted that [[sugar]] derivate acids like [[tartaric acid]] were responsible for [[caries|dental decay]], and also suggested that tumors surrounding the teeth and in the [[Gingiva|gums]] could appear in the later stages of tooth decay.<ref name="Besombes">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2RRqAAAAMAAJ|title=Pierre Fauchard (1678–1761): The First Dental Surgeon, His Work, His Actuality|author=André Besombes|author2=Phillipe de Gaillande|publisher=Pierre Fauchard Academy|date=1993}}</ref><ref name="Weinberger">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2wtqAAAAMAAJ|title=Pierre Fauchard, Surgeon-dentist: A Brief Account of the Beginning of Modern Dentistry, the First Dental Textbook, and Professional Life Two Hundred Years Ago|author=Bernhard Wolf Weinberger|date=1941|publisher=Pierre Fauchard Academy}}</ref>
[[File:Panoramic radiograph of historic dental implants.jpg|thumb|Panoramic radiograph of historic dental implants, made 1978]]

Fauchard was the pioneer of [[Prosthodontics|dental prosthesis]], and he discovered many methods to replace lost teeth. He suggested that substitutes could be made from carved blocks of [[ivory]] or [[bone]]. He also introduced [[dental braces]], although they were initially made of gold, he discovered that the teeth position could be corrected as the teeth would follow the pattern of the wires. Waxed [[linen]] or [[silk]] threads were usually employed to fasten the braces. His contributions to the world of dental science consist primarily of his 1728 publication Le chirurgien dentiste or The Surgeon Dentist.  The French text included "basic oral anatomy and function, dental construction, and various operative and restorative techniques, and effectively separated dentistry from the wider category of surgery".<ref name="Besombes" /><ref name="Weinberger" />

[[File:Dental office.jpg|thumb|left|A modern Dentist's chair.]]
After Fauchard, the study of dentistry rapidly expanded. Two important books, ''Natural History of Human Teeth'' (1771 ) and ''Practical Treatise on the Diseases of the Teeth'' (1778), were published by British surgeon [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]]. In 1763 he entered into a period of collaboration with the London-based dentist James Spence. He began to theorise about the possibility of tooth transplants from one person to another. He realised that the chances of an (initially, at least) successful tooth transplant would be improved if the donor tooth was as fresh as possible and was matched for size with the recipient.  These principles are still used in the transplantation of [[internal organ]]s. Hunter conducted a series of pioneering operations, in which he attempted a tooth transplant. Although the donated teeth never properly bonded with the recipients' gums, one of Hunter's patients stated that he had three which lasted for six years, a remarkable achievement for the period.<ref>{{cite book|author=Moore, Wendy |authorlink=Wendy Moore |title=The Knife Man|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DKInoTPFrBoC|accessdate=8 March 2012|date=30 September 2010|publisher=Transworld|pages=223–224|isbn=978-1-4090-4462-8}}</ref>

Major advances were made in the 19th century, and dentistry evolved from a trade to a profession. The profession came under government regulation by the end of the 19th century. In the UK the Dentist Act was passed in 1878 and the British Dental Association formed in 1879. In the same year, [[Francis Brodie Imlach]] was the first ever dentist to be elected President of the Royal College of Surgeons (Edinburgh), raising dentistry onto a par with clinical surgery for the first time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://historyofdentistry.co.uk/index_htm_files/2004Apr2.pdf|format=PDF|title=A pioneering history: dentistry and the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|first=Helen|last=Dingwall|date=April 2004|work=History of Dentistry Newsletter|issue=14}}</ref>

==Priority patients==
UK NHS priority patients include patients with congenital abnormalities (such as [[cleft palates]] and [[hypodontia]]), patients who have suffered orofacial trauma and those being treated for [[cancer]] in the head and neck region. These are treated in a multidisciplinary team approach with other hospital based dental specialities [[orthodontics]] and [[maxillofacial surgery]]. Other priority patients include those with infections (either third molars or necrotic teeth) or avulsed permanent teeth, as well as patients with a history of smoking or smokeless tobacco with ulcers in the oral cavity.
