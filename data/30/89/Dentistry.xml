His contributions to the world of dental science consist primarily of his 1728 publication Le chirurgien dentiste or The Surgeon Dentist. The French text included &quot;basic oral anatomy and function, dental construction, and various operative and restorative techniques, and effectively separated dentistry from the wider category of surgery&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Besombes"></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="Weinberger"></extension></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Dental office.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>A modern Dentist's chair.</part></link>After Fauchard, the study of dentistry rapidly expanded.

In 1763 he entered into a period of collaboration with the London-based dentist James Spence. He began to theorise about the possibility of tooth transplants from one person to another. He realised that the chances of an (initially, at least) successful tooth transplant would be improved if the donor tooth was as fresh as possible and was matched for size with the recipient. These principles are still used in the transplantation of<space/><link><target>internal organ</target><trail>s</trail></link>. Hunter conducted a series of pioneering operations, in which he attempted a tooth transplant. Although the donated teeth never properly bonded with the recipients' gums, one of Hunter's patients stated that he had three which lasted for six years, a remarkable achievement for the period.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="author">Moore, Wendy<space/></arg><arg name="authorlink">Wendy Moore<space/></arg><arg name="title">The Knife Man</arg><arg name="url">http://books.google.com/books?id</arg><arg name="accessdate">8 March 2012</arg><arg name="date">30 September 2010</arg><arg name="publisher">Transworld</arg><arg name="pages">223â€“224</arg><arg name="isbn">978-1-4090-4462-8</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Major advances were made in the 19th century, and dentistry evolved from a trade to a profession.
