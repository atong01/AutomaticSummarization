'''Alexanderplatz''' ({{IPA-de|ʔalɛkˈsandɐˌplats|pron|De-Alexanderplatz.ogg}}) is a large [[Town square|public square]] and transport hub in the central [[Mitte (locality)|Mitte]] district of [[Berlin]], near the [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]]. Berliners often call it simply '''''Alex''''', referring to a larger neighbourhood stretching from ''Mollstraße'' in the northeast to ''Spandauer Straße'' and the [[Rotes Rathaus]] in the southwest.

===Early history===
Originally a cattle market outside the city fortifications, it was named in honor of a visit of the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] to Berlin on 25 October 1805 by order of King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]]. The square gained a prominent role in the late 19th century with the construction of the [[Berlin Stadtbahn|Stadtbahn]] station of the same name and a nearby market hall, followed by the opening of a department store of [[Hermann Tietz]] in 1904, becoming a major commercial centre. The [[Berlin U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] station of the present-day [[U2 (Berlin U-Bahn)|U2]] line opened on 1 July 1913.

Its heyday was in the 1920s, when together with [[Potsdamer Platz]] it was at the heart of Berlin's [[Nightlife (activity)|nightlife]], inspiring the 1929 novel ''[[Berlin Alexanderplatz]]'' (see [[1920s Berlin]]) and the two [[film]]s based thereon, Piel Jutzi's 1931 film and [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]]'s 15½ hour [[Berlin Alexanderplatz (television)|second adaptation]], released in 1980. About 1920 the city's authorities started a rearrangement of the increasing traffic flows laying out a roundabout, accompanied by two buildings along the Stadtbahn viaduct, ''Alexanderhaus'' and ''Berolinahaus'' finished in 1932 according to plans designed by [[Peter Behrens]].

===East Germany===

Alexanderplatz has been subject to redevelopment several times in its history, most recently during the 1960s, when it was turned into a pedestrian zone and enlarged as part of the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]]'s redevelopment of the city centre. It is surrounded by several notable structures including the [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]] (TV Tower), the second tallest structure in the [[European Union]].

''Alex'' also accommodates the [[Park Inn Berlin]] and the [[World clock|World Time Clock]], a continually rotating installation that shows the time throughout the globe, and [[Hermann Henselmann]]'s ''Haus des Lehrers''. During the [[Peaceful Revolution]] of 1989, the [[Alexanderplatz demonstration]] on 4 November was the largest demonstration in the history of East Germany.

===After German reunification===
Since [[German reunification]], Alexanderplatz has undergone a gradual process of change with many of the surrounding buildings being renovated. Despite the reconstruction of the [[Berlin Straßenbahn|tram]] line crossing, it has retained its socialist character, including the much-[[graffiti]]ed "Fountain of Friendship between Peoples" (''Brunnen der Völkerfreundschaft''), a popular venue.

In 1993, architect [[Hans Kollhoff]]'s master plan for a major redevelopment including the construction of several skyscrapers was published.<ref name="bloomberg1">Dalia Fahmy (May 27, 2014), [http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-26/25-years-after-communism-eyesores-spur-landmark-debate.html 25 Years After Communism, Eyesores Spur Landmark Debate] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.</ref> Due to a lack of demand it is unlikely these will be constructed, with the exception (announced January 2014) of a 39-storey residential tower designed by Frank Gehry on which work is expected to begin in 2015. However, beginning with the reconstruction of the ''[[Metro AG|Kaufhof]]'' department store in 2004, and the biggest underground railway station of Berlin, some buildings will be redesigned and new structures built on the square's south-eastern side. Sidewalks were expanded to shrink one of the avenues, a new underground garage was built, and commuter tunnels meant to keep pedestrians off the streets were removed.<ref name="bloomberg1"/> The surrounding buildings now house chain stores, fast-food restaurants, and fashion discounters.<ref name="bloomberg1"/> The ''Alexa'' shopping mall, with approximately 180 stores opened nearby during 2007 and a large ''Saturn'' electronic store was built and is open on Alexanderplatz since 2008. The CUBIX [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]] cinema, which opened in November 2000, joined in 2007 the team of [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlinale]] cinemas and the festival is showing films on three of its screens.<ref>[http://www.berlinale.de/en/programm/spielst_tten/kinos/index.html Berlinale venues]</ref>

Many historic buildings are located in the vicinity of Alexanderplatz. The traditional seat of city government, the [[Rotes Rathaus]], or ''Red City Hall'',  is located nearby, as was the former East German parliament building, the [[Palast der Republik]], demolition of which began in February 2006 and has been completed. The reconstruction of the Baroque [[Stadtschloss, Berlin|Stadtschloss]] near Alexanderplatz has been in planning for several years.<ref>http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,594515,00.html</ref>

Alexanderplatz is also the name of the [[Berlin Alexanderplatz railway station|S-Bahn]] and [[Alexanderplatz (Berlin U-Bahn)|U-Bahn]] stations there. It is one of Berlin's largest and most important transportation hubs, being a cross of 3 subway (U-Bahn) lines, 3 S-Bahn lines, and many tram and bus lines, as well as regional trains.
