A '''catapult''' is a [[ballistics|ballistic]] device used to launch a [[projectile]] a great distance without the aid of explosive devices—particularly various types of ancient and medieval [[siege engine]]s.<ref>{{cite book | title = The art of the catapult: build Greek ballista, Roman onagers, English trebuchets, and more ancient artillery | last= Gurstelle|first= William|authorlink= William Gurstelle |year= 2004|publisher= Chicago Review Press | location =Chicago|isbn=978-1-55652-526-1 |oclc= 54529037}}</ref> Although the catapult has been used since ancient times, it has proven to be one of the most effective mechanisms during warfare.

The catapult and crossbow in [[Greece]] are closely intertwined. Primitive catapults were essentially “the product of relatively straightforward attempts to increase the range and penetrating power of missiles by strengthening the bow which propelled them”.<ref name = "Barton C. Hacker" /> The historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] (fl. 1st century BC), described the invention of a mechanical arrow-firing catapult (''katapeltikon'') by a Greek task force in 399&nbsp;BC.<ref>Diod. Sic. 14.42.1.</ref><ref name = "Duncan Campbell, p.3">{{Harvnb | Campbell | 2003 | p = 3}}.</ref>  The weapon was soon after employed against [[Sicilian Wars#The Second Sicilian War (410&nbsp;BC–340&nbsp;BC)|Motya]] (397&nbsp;BC), a key [[Carthaginian]] stronghold in [[Sicily]].<ref>Diod. Sic. 14.50.4</ref><ref name="Duncan Campbell, p.8">{{Harvnb | Campbell | 2003 | p = 8}}.</ref>  Diodorus is assumed to have drawn his description from the highly rated{{Sfn | Marsden | 1969 | pp = 48f}} history of [[Philistus]], a contemporary of the events then. The introduction of crossbows however, can be dated further back: according to the inventor [[Hero of Alexandria]] (fl. 1st century AD), who referred to the now lost works of the 3rd-century BC engineer [[Ctesibius]], this weapon was inspired by an earlier foot-held crossbow, called the ''[[gastraphetes]]'', which could store more energy than the Greek bows. A detailed description of the ''gastraphetes'', or the “belly-bow”,<ref name= "Serafina Cuomo">{{Citation | last = Cuomo | first = Serafina | url = http://www.jstor.org/stable/3836219 | title = The Sinews of War: Ancient Catapults}}.</ref>{{Page needed | date = December 2013}} along with a watercolor drawing, is found in Heron's technical treatise ''Belopoeica''.<ref name= "Duncan Campbell, p.4">{{Harvnb | Campbell | 2003 | p = 4}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | first1 = Stanley M | last1 = Burstein | first2 = Walter | last2 = Donlan | first3 = Sarah B | last3 = Pomeroy | first4 = Jennifer Tolbert | last4 = Roberts | year = 1999 | title = Ancient Greece: A Political, Social, and Cultural History | publisher = Oxford University Press | ISBN = 0-19-509742-4 | page = 366}}.</ref>

A third Greek author, Biton (fl. 2nd century BC), whose reliability has been positively reevaluated by recent scholarship,<ref name = "Duncan Campbell, p.3" />{{Sfn | Lewis | 1999}}{{Page needed | date = December 2013}} described two advanced forms of the ''gastraphetes'', which he credits to [[Zopyrus of Tarentum|Zopyros]], an engineer from [[Taranto|southern Italy]]. Zopyrus has been plausibly equated with a [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] of that name who seems to have flourished in the late 5th century BC.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pythagoreanism/ | first = Peter | last = Kingsley | title = Ancient Philosophy, Mystery and Magic | publisher = Clarendon | place = Oxford | year = 1995 | pages = 150ff}}.</ref>{{Efn | Lewis established a lower date of no later than the mid-4th century.{{Sfn | Lewis | 1999 | p = 160}}  So did de Camp.<ref>{{Citation | first = L Sprague | last = de Camp | title = Master Gunner Apollonios | journal = [[Technology and Culture]] | volume = 2 | number = 3 | year = 1961 | pages = 240–4 (241) | doi=10.2307/3101024}}.</ref>}}  He probably designed his bow-machines on the occasion of the sieges of [[Cumae]] and [[Milet]] between 421&nbsp;BC and 401&nbsp;BC.<ref>Biton 65.1–67.4, 61.12–65.1.</ref><ref name= "Duncan Campbell, p.5">{{Harvnb | Campbell | 2003 | p = 5}}.</ref> The bows of these machines already featured a winched pull back system and could apparently throw two missiles at once.<ref name="Duncan Campbell, p.8" />

Philo of Byzantium provides probably the most detailed account on the establishment of a theory of belopoietics (“belos” = projectile; “poietike” = (art) of making) circa 200&nbsp;BC. The central principle to this theory was that “all parts of a catapult, including the weight or length of the projectile, were proportional to the size of the torsion springs”. This kind of innovation is indicative of the increasing rate at which geometry and physics were being assimilated into military enterprises.<ref name="Serafina Cuomo" />{{Page needed | date = December 2013}}

From the mid-4th century BC onwards, evidence of the Greek use of arrow-shooting machines becomes more dense and varied: arrow firing machines (''katapaltai'') are briefly mentioned by [[Aeneas Tacticus]] in his treatise on siegecraft written around 350&nbsp;BC.<ref name="Duncan Campbell, p.8"/> An extant inscription from the [[Athens|Athenian]] arsenal, dated between 338 and 326&nbsp;BC, lists a number of stored catapults with shooting bolts of varying size and springs of sinews.<ref name = "Eric William Marsden, p.57">{{Harvnb | Marsden | 1969 | p = 57}}.</ref>  The later entry is particularly noteworthy as it constitutes the first clear evidence for the switch to [[torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] catapults which are more powerful than the flexible crossbows and came to dominate Greek and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] artillery design thereafter.<ref name = "Duncan Campbell, p.8">{{Harvnb | Campbell | 2003 | pp = 8ff}}.</ref> This move to torsion springs was likely spurred by the engineers of Philip II of Macedonia.<ref name= "Serafina Cuomo"/>{{Page needed | date = December 2013}} Another Athenian inventory from 330 to 329&nbsp;BC includes catapult bolts with heads and flights.<ref name = "Eric William Marsden, p.57" /> As the use of catapults became more commonplace, so did the training required to operate them. Many Greek children were instructed in catapult usage, as evidenced by “a 3rd Century B.C. inscription from the island of Ceos in the Cyclades [regulating] catapult shooting competitions for the young”.<ref name="Serafina Cuomo"/> Arrow firing machines in action are reported from [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]]'s siege of [[Perinth]] ([[Thrace]]) in 340&nbsp;BC.<ref name="Eric William Marsden, p.60">{{Harvnb | Marsden | 1969 | p = 60}}.</ref>  At the same time, Greek fortifications began to feature high towers with shuttered windows in the top, which could have been used to house anti-personnel arrow shooters, as in [[Aigosthena]].<ref>{{Citation | first = Josiah | last = Ober | title = Early Artillery Towers: Messenia, Boiotia, Attica, Megarid | journal = American Journal of Archaeology | volume = 91 | number = 4 | year = 1987 | pages = 569–604 (569) | doi=10.2307/505291}}.</ref> Projectiles included both arrows and (later) stones that were sometimes lit on fire.

The Romans started to use catapults as arms for their wars against [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], Macedon, Sparta and Aetolia (3rd and 2nd centuries BC). The Roman machine known as an [[arcuballista]] was similar to a large crossbow.<ref>{{Citation | contribution = Arcuballista | place = [[France|FR]] | url = http://dagr.univ-tlse2.fr/sdx/dagr/feuilleter.xsp?tome=1&partie=1&numPage=400&filtre=arbal%C3%A8te%20&nomEntree=ARCUBALLISTA | language = French | title = Dictionnaire des antiquités grecques et romaines | trans_title = Dictionary of Greek and Roman antiquities | publisher = Univ TLSE II}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | last = Bachrach | first = Bernard S | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=Is2WQyLMKV4C&pg=PA112 | title = Early Carolingian Warfare: Prelude to Empire | place = Philadelphia | publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press | year = 2001 | ISBN = 978-0-8122-3533-3 | accessdate = January 31, 2013 | pages = 110–12}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | last = Payne-Gallwey | first = Ralph | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=xCDK0twV82MC&pg=PA43 | title = The Crossbow: Its Military and Sporting History, Construction and Use | place = New York | publisher = Skyhorse | year = 2007 | ISBN = 978-1-60239-010-2 | accessdate = January 31, 2013 | pages= 43–44}}.</ref> Later the Romans used [[ballista]] catapults on their warships.

== Medieval catapults ==

[[File:Catapult 1 Mercato San Severino.jpg|thumb|Catapult 1 Mercato San Severino]]
[[Castle]]s and fortified [[walled cities]] were common during this period – and catapults were used as a key [[siege weapon]] against them. As well as attempting to breach the walls, [[Early thermal weapons|incendiary missiles]] could be thrown inside—or early [[biological warfare]] attempted with diseased carcasses or putrid garbage catapulted over the walls.

Defensive techniques in the Middle Ages progressed to a point that rendered catapults ineffective for the most part. The Viking siege of Paris (885–6&nbsp;A.D.) “saw the employment by both sides of virtually every instrument of siege craft known to the classical world, including a variety of catapults,” to little effect, resulting in failure.<ref name="Barton C. Hacker">{{Citation | last = Hacker | first = Barton C | url = http://www.jstor.org/stable/3102042 | title = Greek Catapults and Catapult Technology: Science, Technology, and War in Ancient World}}.</ref>

The most widely used catapults throughout the Middle Ages were as follows:<ref name = "Middle Ages">{{Citation | url = http://www.middle-ages.org.uk/catapults.htm | title = Middle ages | contribution = Catapults | place = [[United Kingdom|UK]]}}.</ref>

; [[Ballista]]: Ballistas were similar to giant crossbows and were designed to work through torsion. The ammunition used were basically giant arrows or darts made from wood with an iron tip. These arrows were then shot “along a flat trajectory” at a target. Ballistas are notable for their high degree of accuracy, but also their lack of firepower compared to that of a Mangonel or Trebuchet. Because of their immobility, most Ballistas were constructed on site following a siege assessment by the commanding military officer.<ref name = "Middle Ages" />

; [[Springald]]: The springald's design is similar to that of the ballista's, in that it was effectively a crossbow propelled by tension. The Springald's frame was more compact, allowing for use inside tighter confines, such as the inside of a castle or tower. This compromised the force though, making it an anti-personnel weapon at best.<ref name="Middle Ages" />

; [[Mangonel]]: These machines were designed to throw heavy projectiles from a “bowl-shaped bucket at the end of its arm”. Mangonels were mostly used for “firing various missiles at fortresses, castles, and cities,” with a range of up to 1300 feet. These missiles included anything from stones to excrement to rotting carcasses. Mangonels were relatively simple to construct, and eventually wheels were added to increase mobility.<ref name = "Middle Ages" />

; [[Onager (siege weapon)|Onager]]: Mangonels are also sometimes referred to as Onagers. Onager catapults initially launched projectiles from a sling, which was later changed to a “bowl-shaped bucket”. The word 'Onager' is derived from the Greek word 'onagros' for wild ass, referring to the “kicking motion and force”<ref name = "Middle Ages"/> that were recreated in the Mangonel's design. Historical records regarding onagers are scarce. The most detailed account of Mangonel use is from “Eric Marsden's translation of a text written by Ammianus Marcellius in the 4th Century AD” describing its construction and combat usage.<ref name = "catapults.info">{{Citation | url = http://www.catapults.info/ | title = Catapults info}}.</ref>

[[File:MongolsBesiegingACityInTheMiddleEast13thCentury.jpg|thumb|left|Mongol warriors using trebuchet to besiege a city.]]
; [[Trebuchet]]: Trebuchets were probably the most powerful catapult employed in the Middle Ages. The most commonly used ammunition were stones, but “darts and sharp wooden poles” could be substituted if necessary. The most effective kind of ammunition though involved fire, such as “firebrands, and deadly [[Greek Fire]]”. Trebuchets came in two different designs: Traction, which were powered by people, or Counterpoise, where the people were replaced with “a weight on the short end”.<ref name= "Middle Ages"/>  The most famous historical account of trebuchet use dates back to the siege of [[Stirling Castle]] in 1304, when the army of Edward I constructed a giant trebuchet known as [[Warwolf]], which then proceeded to “level a section of [castle] wall, successfully concluding the siege.”<ref name="catapults.info" />

; [[Trebuchet|Couillard]]: A simplified trebuchet, where the trebuchet's single counterweight is split, swinging on either side of a central support post.

; Leonardo da Vinci's catapult: [[Leonardo da Vinci]] sought to improve the efficiency and range of earlier designs. His design incorporated a large wooden [[leaf spring]] as an [[:wikt:accumulator|accumulator]] to power the catapult.{{citation needed |date=February 2011}} Both ends of the bow are connected by a rope, similar to the design of a [[bow and arrow]]. The leaf spring was not used to pull the catapult armature directly, rather the rope was wound around a drum. The catapult armature was attached to this drum which would be turned until enough potential energy was stored in the deformation of the spring. The drum would then be disengaged from the winding mechanism, and the catapult arm would snap around.{{citation needed | date = February 2011}} Though no records exist of this design being built during Leonardo's lifetime, contemporary enthusiasts have reconstructed it.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

== Modern use ==
[[File:French grenade catapult.jpg|left|thumb|200px|French troops using a catapult to throw [[hand grenade]]s and other explosives during [[World War I]]]]
The last large scale military use of catapults was during the [[trench warfare]] of [[World War I]]. During the early stages of the war, catapults were used to throw [[hand grenade]]s across [[no man's land]] into enemy trenches. They were eventually replaced by small [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]].

Special variants called ''[[aircraft catapult]]s'' are used to launch planes from land bases and sea carriers when the takeoff runway is too short for a powered takeoff or simply impractical to extend. Ships also use them to launch torpedoes and deploy bombs against submarines. Small catapults, referred to as ''traps'', are still widely used to launch [[clay target]]s into the air in the sport of [[clay pigeon shooting]].

Until recently, catapults were used by thrill-seekers to experience being catapulted through the air. The practice has been discontinued due to fatalities, when the participants failed to land onto the safety net.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theguardian.com/education/2005/oct/31/highereducation.uk4 | title=Inquest told of student catapult death | author= | date=October 31, 2005 | accessdate=December 8, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/oxfordshire/4401024.stm | title=BBC NEWS UK England Oxfordshire - Safety doubts over catapult death | author= | date=November 2, 2005 | accessdate=December 8, 2014 }}</ref>

''[[Pumpkin chunking]]'' is another widely popularized use, in which people compete to see who can launch a pumpkin the farthest by mechanical means (although the world record is held by a pneumatic air cannon).

In January 2011, PopSci.com, the news blog version of ''[[Popular Science]]'' magazine, reported that a group of smugglers used a homemade catapult to deliver [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] into the [[United States]] from [[Mexico]]. The machine was found 20 feet from the border fence with {{convert|4.4|lb}} bales of cannabis ready to launch.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.popsci.com/diy/article/2011-01/mexican-authorities-seize-homemade-marijuana-hurling-catapult-border | newspaper = Pop Sci |date=Jan 2011 | title = Mexican authorities seize homemade marijuana hurling catapult at border}}.</ref>

== Models ==
[[Image:Greek and Roman Ballista Catapult.jpg|thumb|A commercial model of a Greek and Roman Ballista]]
In the US, catapults of all types and sizes are being built for school science and history fairs, competitions or as a hobby. Catapult projects can inspire students to study different subjects including physics, engineering, science, math and history. These kits can be purchased from [[Renaissance fair|Renaissance Fairs]], or from several online stores.
