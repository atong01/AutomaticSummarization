This fragment holds much rich language that reflects the sentiment shared between the<space/><link><target>Qumran</target></link><space/>towards<space/><link><target>Belial</target></link>. In many ways this text shows how these people thought Belial influenced sin through the way they address him and speak of him. By addressing Belial and all his guilty lot, (4Q286:2) they make it clear that he is not only impious, but also guilty of sins. Informing this state of uncleanliness are both his hostile and wicked design (4Q286:3,4). Through this design, Belial poisons the thoughts of those who are not necessarily sinners. Thus a dualism is born from those inclined to be wicked and those who arent.<extension extension_name='ref'>Author=Frey, J. Title=DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF DUALISTIC THOUGHT IN THE QUMRAN LIBRARY IN: Legal Texts And Legal Issues, Year=1984, p. 287</extension><space/>It is clear that Belial directly influences sin by the mention of abominable plots and guilty inclination (4Q286:8,9). These are both mechanisms by which Belial advances his evil agenda that the Qumran have exposed and are calling upon God to protect them from. There is a deep sense of fear that Belial will establish in their heart their evil devices (4Q286:11,12). This sense of fear is the stimulus for this prayer in the first place. Without the worry and potential of falling victim to Belials demonic sway, the Qumran people would never feel impelled to craft a curse. This very fact illuminates the power Belial was believed to hold over mortals, and the fact that sin proved to be a temptation that must stem from an impure origin.</paragraph><paragraph>In<space/><link><target>Jubilees</target></link><space/>1:20, Belials appearance continues to support the notion that sin is a direct product of his influence. Moreover, Belials presence acts as a placeholder for all negative influences or those that would potentially interfere with Gods will and a pious existence. Similarly to the gentiles[who] cause them to sin against you (Jubilees 1:19), Belial is associated with a force that drives one away from God. Coupled in this plea for protection against foreign rule, in this case the Egyptians, is a plea for protection from the spirit of Belial (Jubilees 1:19). Belials tendency is to ensnare [you] from every path of righteousness (Jubilees 1:19). This phrase is intentionally vague, allowing room for interpretation. Everyone, in one way or another, finds themselves straying from the path of righteousness and by pawning this transgression off on Belial, he becomes a scapegoat for all misguidance, no matter what the cause. By associating Belial with all sorts of misfortune and negative external influence, the Qumran people are henceforth allowed to be let off for the sins they commit.</paragraph><paragraph>Belials presence is found throughout the War Scrolls, located in the Dead Sea Scrolls, and is established as the force occupying the opposite end of the spectrum of God. In Col. I, verse 1, the very first line of the document, it is stated that the first attack of the Sons of Light shall be undertaken against the forces of the Sons of Darkness, the army of Belial (1Q33;1:1).<extension extension_name='ref'>Author=Nickelsburg, George. Title=&quot;Jewish Literature between the Bible and the Mishna.&quot; N.d. Digital file.</extension><space/>This dichotomy sheds light on the negative connotations that Belial held at the time.<extension extension_name='ref'>Author=Frey, J. Title=DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF DUALISTIC THOUGHT IN THE QUMRAN LIBRARY IN: Legal Texts And Legal Issues, Year=1984, p. 278</extension><space/>Where God and his Sons of Light are forces that protect and promote piety, Belial and his Sons of Darkness cater to the opposite, instilling the desire to sin and encouraging destruction. This opposition is only reinforced later in the document; it continues to read that the holy ones will strike a blow at wickedness, ultimately resulting in the annihilation of the Sons of Darkness (1Q33:1:13). This epic battle between good and evil described in such abstract terms, however it is also applicable to everyday life and serves as a lens through which the Qumran see the world. Every day is the Sons of Light battle evil and call upon God to help them overcome evil in ways small and large.</paragraph><paragraph>Belials influence is not taken lightly. In Col. XI, verse 8, the text depicts God conquering the hordes of Belial (1Q33;11:8). This defeat is indicative of Gods power over Belial and his forces of temptation. However the fact that Belial is the leader of hordes is a testament to how persuasive he can be. If Belial was obviously an arbiter of wrongdoing and was blatantly in the wrong, he wouldnt be able to amass an army. This fact serves as a warning message, reasserting Gods strength, while also making it extremely clear the breadth of Belials prowess. Belials council is to condemn and convict, so the Qumran feel strongly that their people are not only aware of his purpose, but also equipped to combat his influence (1Q33;13:11).</paragraph><paragraph>In the<space/><link><target>Damascus Document</target></link>, Belial also makes a prominent appearance, being established as a source of evil and an origin of several types of sin. In Column 4, the first mention of Belial reads: Belial shall be unleashed against Israel (4Q266). This phrase is able to be interpreted myriad different ways. Belial is characterized in a wild and uncontrollable fashion, making him seem more dangerous and unpredictable. The notion of being unleashed is such that once he is free to roam; he is unstoppable and able to carry out his agenda uninhibited. The passage then goes to enumerate the three nets (4Q266;4:16) by which Belial captures his prey and forces them to sin. Fornication, riches, [and] the profanation of the temple (4Q266;4:17,18) make up the three nets. These three temptations were three agents by which people were driven to sin, so subsequently, the Qumran people crafted the nets of Belial to rationalize why these specific temptations were so toxic. Later in Column 5, Belial is mentioned again as one of the removers of bound who led Israel astray (4Q266;5:20). This statement is a clear display of Belials influence over man regarding sin. The passage goes on to state: they preached rebellion againstGod (4Q266;5:21,22). Belials purpose is to undermine the teachings of God, and he achieves this by imparting his nets on humans, or the incentive to sin.<extension extension_name='ref'>Author=Nickelsburg, George.

In Jubilees Mastema questions the loyalty of Abraham and tells God to &quot;bid him offer him as a burnt offering on the altar, and Thou wilt see if he will do this command&quot; (Jubilees 17:16). The discrepancy between the story in Jubilees and the story in Genesis 22 exists with the presence of Mastema.

The passage states, the wickedness of humankind on earth was great, and that Every inclination of the thoughts of their hearts was only continually evil (Genesis 5). The mention of the Nephilim in the preceding sentence connects the spread of evil to the Nephilim. Enoch is a very similar story to Genesis 6:45, and provides further description of the story connecting the Nephilim to the corruption of humans. In Enoch, sin originates when angels descend from heaven and fornicate with women, birthing giants as tall as 300 cubits. The giants and the angels departure of Heaven and mating with human women are also seen as the source of sorrow and sadness on Earth. The book of Enoch shows that these fallen angels can lead humans to sin through direct interaction or through providing forbidden knowledge. In Enoch, Semyaz leads the angels to mate with women. Angels mating with humans is against Gods commands and is a cursed action, resulting in the wrath of God coming upon Earth. Azazel indirectly influences humans to sin by teaching them divine knowledge not meant for humans. Asael brings down the stolen mysteries (Enoch 16:3). Asael gives the humans weapons, which they use to kill each other. Humans are also taught other sinful actions such as beautification techniques, alchemy, astrology and how to make medicine (considered forbidden knowledge at the time). Demons originate from the evil spirits of the giants that are cursed by God to wander the earth. These spirits are stated in Enoch to corrupt, fall, be excited, and fall upon the earth, and cause sorrow (Enoch 15:11).<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last">VanderKam</arg><arg name="first">James C.</arg><arg name="title">THE ANGEL STORY IN THE BOOK OF JUBILEES IN: Pseudepigraphic Perspectives : The Apocrypha And Pseudepigrapha In Light Of The Dead Sea Scrolls</arg><arg name="year">1999</arg><arg name="pages">151–170</arg></template></extension>The Book of Jubilees conveys that sin occurs when Cainan accidentally transcribes astrological knowledge used by the Watchers (Jubilees 8). This differs from Enoch in that it does not place blame on the Angels. However, in Jubilees 10:4 the evil spirits of the Watchers are discussed as evil and still remain on earth to corrupt the humans. God binds only 90 percent of the Watchers and destroys them, leaving 10 percent to be ruled by Mastema. Because the evil in humans is great, only 10 percent would be needed to corrupt and lead humans astray.
