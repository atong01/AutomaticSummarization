Its theme proved topical: while the film was in production, mass demonstrations were held against the new<space/><link><target>Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan</target><part>U.S.-Japan Security treaty</part></link>, which was seen by many Japanese, particularly the young, as threatening the country's democracy by giving too much power to corporations and politicians. The film opened in September 1960 to positive critical reaction and modest box office success. The 25-minute opening sequence, depicting a corporate wedding reception interrupted by reporters and police (who arrest an executive for corruption), is widely regarded as one of Kurosawa's most skillfully executed set pieces, but the remainder of the film is often perceived as disappointing by comparison. The movie has also been criticized for employing the conventional Kurosawan hero to combat a social evil that cannot be resolved through the actions of individuals, however courageous or cunning.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Harvnb</target><arg>Richie</arg><arg>1999</arg><arg name="pp">140–146</arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Harvnb</target><arg>Yoshimoto</arg><arg name="pp">274</arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Harvnb</target><arg>Galbraith</arg><arg name="pp">286–293</arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Harvnb</target><arg>Prince</arg><arg name="pp">175–188</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph><italics><link><target>Yojimbo (film)</target><part>Yojimbo</part></link></italics><space/>(<italics>The Bodyguard</italics>), Kurosawa Production's second film, centers on a masterless samurai, Sanjuro, who strolls into a 19th-century town ruled by two opposing violent factions and provokes them into destroying each other.

The budget was also cut, and the screen time allocated for the Japanese segment would now be no longer than 90 minutesa major problem, considering that Kurosawa's script ran over four hours. After numerous revisions, a more or less finalized cut screenplay was agreed upon in May 1968. Shooting began in early December, but Kurosawa would last only a little over three weeks as director. He struggled to work with an unfamiliar crew and the requirements of a Hollywood production, while his working methods puzzled his American producers, who ultimately concluded that the director must be mentally ill. On Christmas Eve 1968, the Americans announced that Kurosawa had left the production due to &quot;fatigue&quot;, effectively firing him.

(He had his name removed from the credits, though the script used for the Japanese half was still his and his co-writers'.) He became estranged from his longtime collaborator, writer Ryuzo Kikushima, and never worked with him again.

The film was shot quickly (by Kurosawa's standards) in about nine weeks, with Kurosawa determined to show he was still capable of working quickly and efficiently within a limited budget. For his first work in color, the dynamic editing and complex compositions of his earlier pictures were set aside, with the artist focusing on the creation of a bold, almost surreal palette of primary colors, in order to reveal the toxic environment in which the characters live. It was released in Japan in October 1970, but though a minor critical success, it was greeted with audience indifference. The picture lost money and caused the Club of the Four Knights to dissolve.

Significantly, for the first time in over forty years, Kurosawa, for this deeply personal project, wrote the screenplay alone.

This technique involved a disruptive depiction of screen space through the use of numerous unrepeated camera setups, a disregard for the traditional 180-degree axis of action around which Hollywood scenes have usually been constructed, and an approach in which &quot;narrative time becomes spatialized&quot;, with fluid camera movement often replacing conventional editing.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Harvnb</target><arg>Prince</arg><arg name="pp">63–64</arg></template></extension><space/>The following are some idiosyncratic aspects of the artist's style.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Axial cut</heading><paragraph>In his films of the 1940s and 1950s, Kurosawa frequently employs the &quot;<link><target>axial cut</target></link>&quot;, in which the camera moves closer to, or further away from, the subject, not through the use of<space/><link><target>tracking shot</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>Dissolve (filmmaking)</target><part>dissolves</part></link>, but through a series of matched<space/><link><target>jump cut</target><trail>s</trail></link>.

A few minutes later, when the villagers go to the mill to ask the village elder's advice, there is a long shot of the mill, with a slowly turning wheel in the river, then a closer shot of this wheel, and then a still closer shot of it. (As the mill is where the elder lives, these shots forge a mental association in the viewer's mind between that character and the mill.)<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Harvnb</target><arg>Seven Samurai</arg><arg name="loc">Stephen Prince commentary</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='4'>Cutting on motion</heading><paragraph>A number of scholars have pointed out Kurosawa's tendency to &quot;cut on motion&quot;: that is, to edit a sequence of a character or characters in motion so that an action is depicted in two or more separate shots, rather than one uninterrupted shot. One scholar, as an example, describes a tense scene in<space/><italics>Seven Samurai</italics><space/>in which the samurai Shichirji, who is standing, wishes to console the peasant Manzo, who is sitting on the ground, and he gets down on one knee to talk to him. Kurosawa chooses to film this simple action in two shots rather than one (cutting between the two only<space/><italics>after</italics><space/>the action of kneeling has begun) to fully convey Shichirji's humility. Numerous other instances of this device are evident in the movie. &quot;Kurosawa [frequently] breaks up the action, fragments it, in order to create an emotional effect.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="Mellentalk"><template><target>Harvnb</target><arg>Seven Samurai</arg><arg name="loc">DVD bonus featurette: ''Seven Samurai: Origins and Influences'', Joan Mellen commentary</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='4'>Wipe</heading><paragraph>A form of cinematic punctuation very strongly identified with Kurosawa is the<space/><link><target>Wipe (transition)</target><part>wipe</part></link>.

The inspiration for this innovation came from a family tragedy. When news reached Kurosawa of his father's death in 1948, he wandered aimlessly through the streets of Tokyo. His sorrow was magnified rather than diminished when he suddenly heard the cheerful, vapid song &quot;The Cuckoo Waltz&quot;, and he hurried to escape from this &quot;awful music&quot;. He then told his composer, Fumio Hayasaka, with whom he was working on<space/><italics>Drunken Angel</italics>, to use &quot;The Cuckoo Waltz&quot; as ironic accompaniment to the scene in which the dying gangster, Matsunaga, sinks to his lowest point in the narrative.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Harvnb</target><arg>Kurosawa</arg><arg>1983</arg><arg name="pp">162–163</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>This ironic approach to music can also be found in<space/><italics>Stray Dog</italics>, a film released a year after<space/><italics>Drunken Angel</italics>.
