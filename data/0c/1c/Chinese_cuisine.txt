{{Cuisine of China}}
{{Culture of China}}

'''Chinese cuisine''' includes styles originating from the diverse regions of [[China]], as well as from Chinese people in other parts of the world. The [[history of Chinese cuisine]] in China stretches back for thousands of years and has changed from period to period and in each region according to climate, imperial fashions, and local preferences. Over time, techniques and ingredients from the cuisines of other cultures were integrated into the cuisine of the Chinese people due both to imperial expansion and from the trade with nearby regions in pre-modern times, and from Europe and the New World in the modern period. In addition, [[dairy]] is rarely—if ever—used in any recipes in the style.

According to [[food critic]] Bonny Wolf, Chinese cuisine is one of the "Three Grand Cuisines" in the world, together with the [[French cuisine|French]] and [[Turkish cuisine]]s.<ref>http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128907103</ref>

Chinese society greatly valued gastronomy and developed an extensive study of the subject based on its [[traditional Chinese medicine|traditional medical beliefs]].  Chinese culture initially centered around the [[Central Plain (China)|North China Plain]]. The first domesticated crops seem to have been the [[foxtail millet|foxtail]] and [[broomcorn millet|broomcorn]] varieties of [[millet]], while [[rice]] was cultivated in the south. By 2000 BC, wheat had arrived from western Asia. However, these grains were typically served as warm [[noodle]] soups instead of baked into bread as in Europe. Nobles hunted various wild game and consumed mutton, pork, [[Dog meat#Mainland China|dog]], and beef as these animals were domesticated. Grain was stored against famine and flood and meat was preserved with salt, vinegar, curing, and fermenting. The flavor of the meat was enhanced by cooking it in the fat of a different animal.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

By the time of [[Confucius]] in the [[Warring States Period|late Zhou]], gastronomy was becoming a high art. He was recorded discussing one such picky eater: "For him, the rice could never be white enough. When it was not cooked right, he would not eat. When it was out of season, he would not eat. When the meat was not cut properly, he would not eat. When the food was not prepared with the right sauce, he would not eat."{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}  During [[Shi Huangdi]]'s [[Qin dynasty]], the empire expanded into the south. By the time of the [[Han Dynasty]], the different climes and cuisines of China's peoples were linked by major [[canal]]s and begun developing greater complexity. The philosophy behind it was rooted in the ''[[I Ching]]'' and [[Chinese traditional medicine]]: food was judged for color, aroma, taste, and texture and a good meal was expected to balance the [[Chinese herbology#Four Natures|Four Natures]] ('[[Yin and yang|hot]]', warm, cool, and '[[Yin and yang|cold]]') and the [[Chinese herbology#Five flavors|Five Tastes]] (pungent, sweet, sour, bitter, and salty). [[Salt in Chinese history#Salt in Chinese cuisine|
Salt was used as a preservative]] from early times, but in cooking was added in the form of soy sauce, and not at the table.{{sfnb|Anderson|1988| p = [http://books.google.com/books?id=BAcknxN_S8QC&pg=PA207#v=onepage&q=%22salt%20by%20itself%20was%20never%20used%22&f=false 267]}} The predominance of [[chopsticks]] and spoons as eating utensils also necessitated that most food be prepared in bite-sized pieces or (as with fish) be so tender that it could be easily picked apart.

By the Later Han period (2nd century), writers{{who|date=August 2013}} frequently complained of lazy aristocrats who did nothing but sit around all day eating smoked meats and roasts.

During the Han dynasty, Chinese developed methods of food preservation for military rations during campaigns such as drying meat into jerky and cooking, roasting, and drying grain.{{sfnb|Anderson|1988| p= [http://books.google.com/books?id=BAcknxN_S8QC&pg=PA52#v=onepage&q&f=false 52]}}
Chinese legends claim that the roasted flatbread [[Shaobing]] (shao-ping) was brought back from the [[Xiyu]] (the Western Regions, known as [[Central Asia]]) by the Han dynasty General [[Ban Chao]], and that it was originally known as Hubing 胡餅 (barbarian pastry). The shao-ping is believed to be descended from the Hu-ping (Hubing).<ref>{{cite book|title=Fermentations and Food Science, Volume 6|issue=|first=H. T.|last=Huang|editor-first=|editor-last=|edition=

During the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] non-Han people like the [[Xianbei]] of [[Northern Wei]] introduced their cuisine to northern China, and these influences continued up to the [[Tang dynasty]], popularizing meat like mutton and dairy products like goat milk, yogurts, and [[Kumis]] among even Han people. It was during the Song dynasty that Han Chinese developed an aversion to dairy products and abandoned the dairy foods introduced earlier.{{sfnb|Anderson|1988| p= [http://books.google.com/books?id=BAcknxN_S8QC&pg=PA80&dq=yogurt+fish+wei&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ylUrVMKRBMSnyATJjIHQBQ&ved=0CCsQ6wEwATgU#v=onepage&q=yogurt%20fish%20wei&f=false 80]}}

The Han Chinese rebel Wang Su who received asylum in the Xianbei Northern Wei after fleeing from Southern Qi, at first could not stand eating dairy products like goat's milk and meat like mutton and had to consume tea and fish instead, but after a few years he was able to eat yogurt and lamb, and the Xianbei Emperor asked him which of the foods of China (Zhongguo) he preferred, fish vs mutton and tea vs yogurt.<ref>{{cite book|title=Culture and Power in the Reconstitution of the Chinese Realm, 200-600|volume=Volume 200 of Harvard East Asian monographs|first=|last=|editor1-first=Scott|editor1-last=Pearce|editor2-first=Audrey G.|editor2-last=Spiro|editor3-first=Patricia Buckley|editor3-last=Ebrey|edition=illustrated|year=2001|publisher=Harvard Univ Asia Center|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PASE4LVLzQ0C&pg=PA22&dq=yogurt+fish+wei&hl=en&sa=X&ei=klUrVN3dB5CwyASRqoGYBA&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=yogurt%20fish%20wei&f=false|page=22|isbn=0674005236|accessdate=24 April 2014| ref=harv }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=China Between Empires|volume= |first=Mark Edward|last=Lewis|edition= |year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ch04UBWfplQC&pg=PA126&dq=wang+su+yoghurt&hl=en&sa=X&ei=pFcrVMboF-L-sATUkoGABw&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=wang%20su%20yoghurt&f=false|page=126|isbn=0674026055|accessdate=24 April 2014| ref=harv }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Fermentations and Food Science, Volume 6|first=H.

The great migration of Chinese people south during the invasions preceding and during the [[Song dynasty]] increased the relative importance of [[northern and southern China|southern Chinese]] staples such as rice and [[congee]]. The [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasties introduced [[Mongolian cuisine|Mongolian]] and [[Manchu cuisine]], warm northern dishes which popularized [[hot pot]] cooking. During the Yuan dynasty many [[Muslim Chinese|Muslim communities]] emerged in China, who practiced a porkless cuisine now preserved by [[Chinese Islamic cuisine|Hui restaurants]] throughout the country.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} [[Yunnan cuisine]] is unique in China for its cheeses like [[Rubing]] and [[Rushan cheese]] made by the [[Bai people]], and its yogurt, the yogurt may have been due to a combination of Mongolian influence during the Yuan dynasty, the Central Asian settlement in Yunnan, and the proximity and influence of India and Tibet on Yunnan.{{sfnb|Anderson|1988| p= [http://books.google.com/books?id=BAcknxN_S8QC&pg=PA52#v=onepage&q&f=false 91, 178]}}

As part of the last leg of the [[Columbian Exchange]], Spanish and Portuguese traders began introducing foods from the New World to China through the port cities of [[Guangdong|Canton]] and [[Macao]]. Mexican [[chili pepper]]s became essential ingredients in [[Sichuan cuisine]] and calorically-dense potatoes and corn became staple foods across the northern plains.

During the Qing Dynasty, Chinese gastronomes such as [[Yuan Mei]] focused upon a primary goal of extracting the maximum flavor of each ingredient. However, as noted in his culinary work the ''[[Suiyuan shidan]]'', the fashions of cuisine at the time were quite varied and in some cases were flamboyantly ostentatious,<ref>{{cite web| title=Things to Avoid 3: Meals for the Ears (戒耳餐)|website=Translating the Suiyuan Shidan|url=

The [[People's Republic of China]], amid numerous false starts, has largely industrialized food production. A side effect of this process was the introduction of [[poultry farming in the United States|American poultry-rearing techniques]], which has greatly increased the relative consumption of eggs and chicken in various Chinese cuisines.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Regional cuisines==
{{main|Chinese regional cuisine}}
A number of different styles contribute to Chinese cuisine but perhaps the best known and most influential are [[Guangdong cuisine|Cantonese cuisine]], [[Shandong cuisine]], [[Jiangsu cuisine]] (specifically [[Huaiyang cuisine]]) and [[Sichuan cuisine]].<ref name="Yao"/><ref>[http://www.kas.ku.edu/archived-site/chinese_food/regional_cuisine.html "Regions of Chinese food-styles/flavors of cooking."] [http://www.kas.ku.edu/ University of Kansas], Kansas Asia Scholars.

Jiangsu cuisine favours cooking techniques such as [[braising]] and [[stew]]ing, while Sichuan cuisine employs [[baking]], just to name a few.<ref name=Yao /> Hairy [[crab]] is a highly sought after local delicacy in [[Shanghai]], as it can be found in lakes within the region. [[Peking duck]] and dim-sum are other popular dishes well known outside of China.<ref name=Yao />

Based on the raw materials and ingredients used, the method of preparation and [[culture|cultural]] differences, a variety of foods with different flavors and textures are prepared in different regions of the country. Many traditional regional cuisines rely on basic methods of [[Food preservation|preservation]] such as [[Drying (food)|drying]], [[Salting (food)|salting]], [[pickling]] and [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]].<ref name=Hsieh>J.

==Staple foods==

===Rice===
[[Rice]] is a major [[staple food]] for people from rice farming areas in southern China.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} [[Steamed rice]], usually white rice, is the most commonly eaten form. Rice is also used to produce [[Beer in China|beers]], [[baijiu|wine]]s and vinegars.  Rice is one of the most popular foods in China and is used in many dishes. [[Glutinous rice]] ("sticky rice") is a variety of rice used in many specialty Chinese dishes.

===Noodles===
[[File:Billyzhajiang1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Zhajiangmian]] is a fried sauce noodles topped with a mixture of ground meat]]
{{main|Chinese noodles}}
[[Chinese noodles]] come dry or fresh in a variety of sizes, shapes and textures and are often served in soups or fried as toppings. Some varieties, such as [[Shou Mian]] (寿面, literally noodles of longevity), are symbolic of long life and good health according to Chinese tradition.<ref name=Yao /> Noodles can be served hot or cold with different toppings, with broth, and occasionally dry (as is the case with mi-fun).  Noodles are commonly made with rice flour or wheat flour, but other flours such as [[Soy flour|soybean]] are also used.

===Soybeans===
[[Tofu]] is made of [[soybean]]s and is another popular food product that supplies protein.<ref name=Hsieh>J. Li & Y. Hsieh. ''Traditional Chinese Food Technology and Cuisine''. Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition. 2004;13(2): 147–155.</ref> Other products such as [[soy milk]], [[soy paste]], [[soy oil]], and fermented [[soy sauce]] are also important in Chinese cooking.

===Wheat===
In wheat-farming areas in [[northern and southern China|Northern China]], people largely rely on [[flour]]-based food, such as [[Chinese noodle|noodles]], [[bread]]s, ''[[jiaozi]]'' (a kind of Chinese [[dumpling]]s), and ''[[mantou]]'' (a type of steamed buns).<ref name=Yao>Yao, Zhang.

===Vegetables===
[[File:Bokchoycooked.jpg|thumb|Cooked [[Chinese cabbage]]]]
Some common [[vegetable]]s used in Chinese cuisine include [[Chinese leaves]], [[Chinese cabbage|bok choy]] (Chinese cabbage), [[Chinese spinach]] (dao-mieu), on choy, yu choy, [[bitter melon]], and Chinese broccoli or [[Kai-lan|gailan]] (guy-lahn).  Other vegetables include [[bean sprout]]s, [[pea vine tips]], [[watercress]], [[celery]], [[carrot]]s, fresh [[mustard greens]], and (Western) [[broccoli]].

A variety of dried or pickled vegetables are also eaten, especially in drier or colder regions where fresh vegetables traditionally were hard to get out of season.

===Herbs and seasonings===
[[Spice]]s and [[seasoning]]s such as fresh [[ginger]] root, [[garlic]], [[scallion]], [[white pepper]], and [[sesame oil]] are widely used in many regional cuisines. [[Sichuan peppercorn]]s, [[star anise]], [[cinnamon]], [[fennel]], [[cilantro]], [[parsley]], and [[clove]]s are also used.<ref name=times>{{Wayback |df=yes|date=20100530060727 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/food_and_drink/real_food/article4262148.ece |title="Top 10 basic ingredients for Chinese cooking." }} [''The Times''].

When it comes to [[sauce]]s, China is home to [[soy sauce]], which is made from fermented soy beans and [[wheat]]. [[Oyster sauce]], clear [[rice vinegar]], chili, Chinkiang black rice vinegar, fish sauce and [[furu|fermented tofu]] (furu) are also widely used. A number of sauces are also based on fermented soybeans, including [[Hoisin sauce]], ground bean sauce and yellow bean sauce.

Fortune cookies are often served as a dessert in [[American Chinese cuisine|Chinese restaurants in the United States]] and some other countries, but are absent in [[China]]. The exact origin of fortune cookies is unclear, though various immigrant groups in [[California]] claim to have popularized them in the early 20th century, basing their recipe on a traditional [[Senbei|Japanese cracker]]. Fortune cookies have been summarized as being "introduced by the Japanese, popularized by the Chinese, but ultimately ... consumed by Americans."<ref name=solving>{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Jennifer|date=January 16, 2008|newspaper=The New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/16/dining/16fort.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all|title=Solving a Riddle Wrapped in a Mystery Inside a Cookie|accessdate=May 10, 2012}}</ref>

In larger cities, a wide variety of [[Chinese bakery products]] are available, including baked, steamed, boiled, or deep-fried sweet or savory snacks. [[Bing (Chinese flatbread)|Bing]]s are baked wheat flour based confections, and include [[moon cake]], red bean paste pancake, and sun cake ([[Suncake (Beijing)|Beijing]] and [[Suncake (Taiwan)|Taiwan]] varieties). Chinese candies and sweets, called ''táng''<ref name="kaleidoscope"/> are usually made with cane sugar, malt sugar, honey, nuts and fruit. [[Kueh|Gao or Guo]] are rice based snacks that are typically steamed<ref name="kaleidoscope"/> and may be made from glutinous or normal rice.

[[Ice cream]] is commonly available throughout China.<ref name="kaleidoscope"/> Another cold dessert is called ''baobing'', which is [[shaved ice]] with sweet syrup.<ref name="kaleidoscope"/> Chinese jellies are known collectively in the language as ''ices''. Many jelly desserts are traditionally set with agar and are flavored with fruits, though [[gelatin]] based jellies are also common in contemporary desserts.

Chinese dessert soups typically consist of sweet and usually hot soups<ref name="kaleidoscope"/> and [[custard]]s. Chinese desserts are frequently less sugary and milder in taste than western style desserts. Some restaurants do not serve dessert at all.

===Chinese sausage===
[[Chinese sausage]]s vary from region to region. Chinese sausage is commonly darker and thinner than western sausages. The most common sausage is made of pork and pork fat. Flavor is generally salty-sweet. Chinese sausage can be prepared in many different ways, including oven-roasting, stir-fry, and steaming.<ref>{{cite web|last=Parkinson|first=Rhonda|title=How To Cook Chinese Sausage|url=http://chinesefood.about.com/od/cookingfaqs/f/chinese-sausage.htm|accessdate=23 February 2013}}</ref>

===Tofu products===
[[Stinky tofu]] is a fermented tofu. Like [[blue cheese]] or [[durian]], it has a very distinct, potent smell, and is an acquired taste. It is often paired with soy sauce or something salty and spicy.

[[Doufulu]] is another type of fermented tofu which has a red skin and salty taste.  This is more of a pickled type of tofu and is not as strongly scented as stinky tofu.  Doufulu has the consistency of slightly soft blue cheese, and a taste similar to Japanese [[miso paste]], but less salty. Doufulu is frequently pickled together with soy beans and chili, and paired with [[Congee|rice congee]].

===Snacks===
It is common to eat noodles, especially soup-noodles between regular meals or in the evening, and many types of street foods, which vary from region to region. [[Prawn cracker]]s are an often-consumed snack in Southeast China and Vietnam.

In contrast to their popularity in the US, [[fortune cookie]]s are almost completely absent from Chinese cuisine within China.

==Drinks==

===Tea===
[[File:Longjing tea 3.jpg|thumb|[[Longjing tea]], also known as Dragon Well tea, is a variety of roasted green tea from [[Hangzhou]], [[Zhejiang]] Province, China, where it is produced mostly by hand and has been renowned for its high quality, earning the [[China Famous Tea]] title.]]

Chinese tea is often classified into several different categories according to the species of plant from which it is sourced, the region in which it is grown, and the method of production used. Some of these types are [[green tea]], [[oolong tea]], black tea, scented tea, [[white tea]], and [[compressed tea]]. There are four major [[tea plantation]] regions: [[Jiangbei District, Ningbo|Jiangbei]], [[Jiangnan]], [[Huanan County|Huanan]] and the southwestern region.<ref name=Hong /> Well known types of green tea include [[Longjing tea|Longjing]], [[Huangshan]], [[Mao Feng]], [[Bilochun]], [[Putuofeng Cha]], and [[Liu'an Guapian]].<ref name=Chang>Zonglin Chang Xukui Li.

===Herbal drinks===
{{Main|Chinese herb tea}}

Chinese herb tea, also known as ''medicinal herbal tea'', is a kind of tea-soup made from purely Chinese medicinal [[herb]]s.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Milk===
Chinese in earlier dynasties evidently drank milk and ate dairy products, although not necessarily from cows, but perhaps ''[[koumiss]]'' (fermented mare's milk) or goat's milk.

Most Chinese until recently have avoided milk, partly because pasturage for milk producers in a monsoon rice ecology is not economic.<ref>Jack Goody, ''Cooking, Cuisine, and Class:  A Study in Comparative Sociology'' (Cambridge; New York: Cambridge University Press, 1982), p. 107; Chang, ed., ''Food in Chinese Culture: Anthropological and Historical Perspectives'', 7, 25, 105-06.</ref>

But this non-dairy tradition has undergone some changes as a result of changing perceptions and global influences. For example, it has been suggested that, in the early 20th century Shanghai, “Western food, and in particular identifiably nourishing items like milk, became a symbol of a neo-traditional Chinese notion of family.”<ref>Mark Swislocki, ''Culinary Nostalgia: Regional Food Culture and the Urban Experience in Shanghai''  (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2009), p. 25.</ref>

==Recent trends==
In [[list of Chinese dynasties|imperial China]], the consumption of meat and animal products was strikingly low by comparison with other cultures. Most meals consisted of a starch {{ndash}} rice in the [[northern and southern China|south]] and dumplings or noodles in the [[northern and southern China|north]] {{ndash}} and green vegetables, with peanuts and soy products providing additional [[protein]]. Fats and sugars were luxuries not available to most of the population on a regular basis.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The initial attempts of the [[People's Republic of China]] to modernize Mainland China's productive but labor-intensive agricultural practices led to a series of debacles: the worst, the [[Great Leap Forward]], produced such widespread famines from 1958 to 1961 that the [[1963 Chinese census]] remained a state secret and whose existence was not acknowledged until the 1980s. Practices and technology were slowly modernized, however, and from the introduction of [[Chinese economic reform|economic reform]] by [[Deng Xiaoping]] in the late '70s, Chinese diets have steadily become richer over time and include more meats, fats, and sugar than before.<ref>Hsu Y.N., Vera & al. "Modern China: North", in ''Food in China'', pp. 302 & 311&ndash;313. Yale Univ. Press (New Haven), 1978.</ref> According to the [[United Nations]]' [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], China's ''per capita'' food consumption has increased from less than 1700 kcal in 1960 to 2570 kcal per day in 1995.<ref>UN FAO.

==Chinese cuisine in other parts of the world==
{{main|American Chinese cuisine}}
Where there are historical immigrant Chinese populations, the style of food has evolved and been adapted to local tastes and ingredients, and modified by the local cuisine, to greater or lesser extents. This has resulted in a number of forms of [[fusion cuisine]], often popular in the country in question; some, such as [[ramen]] (Japanese Chinese) have become popular internationally.

The large Chinese population in the United States operates many restaurants, has developed distinctive dishes (such as [[chop suey]]) based originally on Cantonese cuisine.<ref>Andrew Coe, ''Chop Suey: A Cultural History of Chinese Food in the United States'' (2009)</ref><ref>Yong Chen, ''Chop Suey, USA: The Story of Chinese Food in America'' (2014)</ref>

==Dining etiquette==
{{Main|Customs and etiquette in Chinese dining}}
The Chinese Dining etiquette has that youths should not sit at the table before the elders. In addition to this, youths should not start eating before the elders start eating. When eating with a bowl, one should not hold it with its bottom part, because it resembles the act of begging. Also, when taking a break from eating at the table, one should not put the chopstick into the rice vertically, because it resembles the Chinese traditional funeral tribute, which involves putting chopstick inside a bowl of rice vertically.

==Relation to Chinese art==
Chinese dishes stress the three main points of appearance, smell, and taste. A really well-cooked Chinese food would need to achieve all three of them. Also, there is teaching of food carving in Chinese culture, typically using vegetables as materials to carve the sculpture for animals and spiritual creatures, such as dragons.

==Relation to Chinese philosophy==
In Chinese philosophy, food is frequently used as in the message that the author is trying to convey. I Ching 《易》, a Chinese philosophy has that”《易》曰：君子以飲食宴樂。
又曰：君子慎言語，節飲食。”, which basically means that, “Gentlemen use eating as a way to attain happiness. They should be aware of what they say, and refrain from eating too much.
