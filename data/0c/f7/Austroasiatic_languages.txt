The '''Austroasiatic languages''',<ref>Sometimes also as '''Austro-Asiatic''' or '''Austroasian'''.</ref> in recent classifications synonymous with '''Mon–Khmer''',<ref>Bradley (2012) notes, ''MK in the wider sense including the Munda languages of eastern South Asia is also known as Austroasiatic.''</ref> are a large [[language family]] of continental [[Southeast Asia]], also scattered throughout [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]] and the southern border of [[China]]. The name ''Austroasiatic'' comes from the [[Latin]] words for "south" and "Asia", hence "South Asia". Of these languages, only [[Khmer language|Khmer]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], and [[Mon language|Mon]] have a long-established [[recorded history]], and only Vietnamese and Khmer have official status (in [[Vietnam]] and [[Cambodia]], respectively). The rest of the languages are spoken by minority groups. ''[[Ethnologue]]'' identifies 168 Austroasiatic languages. These form thirteen established families (plus perhaps [[Shompen language|Shompen]], which is poorly attested, as a fourteenth), which have traditionally been grouped into two, as Mon–Khmer and [[Munda languages|Munda]]. However, one recent classification posits three groups (Munda, Nuclear Mon-Khmer and  [[Khasi–Khmuic languages|Khasi-Khmuic]])<ref>Diffloth 2005</ref> while another has abandoned Mon–Khmer as a taxon altogether, making it synonymous with the larger family.<ref>Sidwell 2009</ref>

Austroasiatic languages have a disjunct distribution across India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Southeast Asia, separated by regions where other languages are spoken. They appear to be the [[autochthonous language]]s of Southeast Asia, with the neighboring [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]], [[Tai–Kadai languages|Tai–Kadai]], [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]], [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]], and [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] being the result of later migrations.<ref name="SidwellBlench2011" />

== Typology ==
{{Expand section|date=November 2010}}

The Austroasiatic languages are well known for having a [[sesquisyllable|"sesquisyllabic"]] pattern, with basic nouns and verbs consisting of a reduced [[minor syllable]] plus a full syllable. Many of them also have [[infix]]es. The Austroasiatic languages are further characterized as having unusually large vowel inventories and employing some sort of [[Register (phonology)|register]] contrast, either between [[modal voice|modal]] (normal) voice and [[breathy voice|breathy]] (lax) voice or between modal voice and [[creaky voice]].<ref>DIPFLOTH, Gerard. [http://www.sealang.net/archives/mks/pdf/15:139-154.pdf "Proto-Austroasiatic creaky voice."] (1989).</ref> Languages in the Pearic branch and some in the Vietic branch can have a three- or even four-way voicing contrast. However, some Austroasiatic languages have lost the register contrast by evolving more diphthongs or in a few cases, such as Vietnamese, [[tonogenesis]].

==Proto-language==
{{Main|Proto-Mon–Khmer language}}

Much work has been done on the reconstruction of [[Proto-Mon–Khmer]] in [[Harry L. Shorto]]'s ''Mon–Khmer Comparative Dictionary''. Little work has been done on the [[Munda languages]], which are not well documented. With their demotion from a primary branch, Proto-Mon–Khmer becomes synonymous with Proto-Austroasiatic.

[[Paul Sidwell]] (2005) reconstructs the consonant inventory of Proto-Mon–Khmer as follows:

{| class="IPA wikitable"
|-
|*p||*t||*c||*k||*ʔ
|-
|*b||*d||*ɟ||*ɡ||
|-
|*ɓ||*ɗ||*ʄ|| ||
|-
|*m||*n||*ɲ||*ŋ||
|-
|*w||*l, *r||*j|| ||
|-
| ||*s|| || ||*h
|}

This is identical to earlier reconstructions except for {{IPA|*ʄ}}.  {{IPA|*ʄ}} is better preserved in the [[Katuic languages]], which Sidwell has specialized in. Sidwell (2011) suggests that the likely homeland of Austroasiatic is the middle [[Mekong]], in the area of the Bahnaric and Katuic languages (approximately where modern Laos, Thailand, and Cambodia come together), and that the family is not as old as frequently assumed, dating to perhaps 2000 BCE.<ref name="SidwellBlench2011"/>

==Internal classification==
Linguists traditionally recognize two primary divisions of Austroasiatic: the Mon–Khmer languages of Southeast Asia, [[North-East India|Northeast India]] and the [[Nicobar Islands]], and the Munda languages of [[East India|East]] and Central India and parts of Bangladesh. However, no evidence for this classification has ever been published.

Each of the families that is written in boldface type below is accepted as a valid clade. By contrast, the relationships ''between'' these families within Austroasiatic is debated. In addition to the traditional classification, two recent proposals are given, neither of which accept traditional "Mon–Khmer" as a valid unit. However, little of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published, and therefore cannot be evaluated by peer review.

In addition, there are suggestions that additional branches of Austroasiatic might be preserved in substrata of [[Acehnese language|Acehnese]] in Sumatra (Diffloth), the [[Chamic languages]] of Vietnam, and the [[Land Dayak languages]] of Borneo (Adelaar 1995).<ref>Roger Blench, ''2009. Are there four additional unrecognised branches of Austroasiatic?'' Presentation at ICAAL-4, Bangkok, 29–30 October. Summarized in Sidwell and Blench (2011).</ref>

===Sidwell (2009, 2011)===
[[File:Mekongbasin.jpg|thumb|right|400px|[[Paul Sidwell]] and [[Roger Blench]] propose that the Austroasiatic phylum had dispersed via the [[Mekong]] River [[drainage basin]].]]
[[Paul Sidwell]] (2009a), in a [[lexicostatistical]] comparison of 36 languages which are well-known enough to exclude loan words, finds little evidence for internal branching, though he did find an area of increased contact between the Bahnaric and Katuic languages, such that languages of all branches apart from the geographically distant Munda and Nicobarese show greater similarity to Bahnaric and Katuic the closer they are to those branches, without any noticeable innovations common to Bahnaric and Katuic. He therefore takes the conservative view that the thirteen branches of Austroasiatic should be treated as equidistant on current evidence. Sidwell & [[Roger Blench|Blench]] (2011) discuss this proposal in more detail, and note that there is good evidence for a Khasi–Palaungic node, which could also possibly be closely related to Khmuic.<ref name="SidwellBlench2011">Sidwell, Paul, and Roger Blench. 2011. "The Austroasiatic Urheimat: the Southeastern Riverine Hypothesis." Enfield, N.J. (ed.) ''Dynamics of Human Diversity'', 317-345. Canberra: Pacific Linguistics. http://rogerblench.info/Archaeology/SE%20Asia/SR09/Sidwell%20Blench%20offprint.pdf</ref> If this would the case, Sidwell & Blench suggest that Khasic may have been an early offshoot of Palaungic that had spread westward. Sidwell & Blench (2011) suggest [[Shompen language|Shompen]] as an additional branch, and believe that a Vieto-Katuic connection is worth investigating. In general, however, the family is thought to have diversified too quickly for a deeply nested structure to have developed, since Proto-Austroasiatic speakers are believed by Sidwell to have radiated out from the central [[Mekong]] River valley relatively quickly.

===Previously existent branches===
[[Roger Blench]] (2009)<ref>Blench, Roger. 2009. "[http://icaal.org/abstract/blench-are.html Are there four additional unrecognised branches of Austroasiatic?]."</ref> also proposes that there may have been other primary branches of Austroasiatic that are now extinct, based on [[Stratum (linguistics)|substrate]] evidence in modern-day languages.
*'''Pre-[[Chamic language|Chamic]] languages''' (the languages of coastal Vietnam prior to the [[Chamic language|Chamic]] migrations). Chamic has various Austroasiatic loanwords that cannot be clearly traced to existing Austroasiatic branches (Sidwell 2006).<ref name="Sidwell2006">Sidwell, Paul. 2006. "[http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/sidwell2006dating.pdf Dating the Separation of Acehnese and Chamic By Etymological Analysis of the Aceh-Chamic Lexicon]." In The ''Mon-Khmer Studies Journal'', 36: 187-206.</ref>
*'''[[Acehnese language|Acehnese]] substratum''' (Sidwell 2006).<ref name="Sidwell2006"/> Acehnese has many basic words that are of Austroasiatic origin, suggesting that either Austronesian speakers may have absorbed earlier Austroasiatic residents in northern Sumatra, or that words may have been borrowed from Austroasiatic languages in southern Vietnam — or perhaps a combination of both.
*'''[[Bornean languages|Bornean]] substrate languages''' (Blench 2010).<ref>Blench, Roger. 2010. "Was there an Austroasiatic Presence in Island Southeast Asia prior to the Austronesian Expansion?" In ''Bulletin of the Indo-Pacific Prehistory Association '', Vol. 30.</ref> Blench cites Austroasiatic-origin words in modern-day Bornean branches such as [[Land Dayak languages|Land Dayak]] ([[Bidayuh languages|Bidayuh]], [[Bakati’ language|Dayak Bakatiq]], etc.), [[Dusunic languages|Dusunic]] ([[Dusun language|Central Dusun]], [[Brunei Bisaya language|Visayan]], etc.), [[Kayan–Murik languages|Kayan]], and [[Kenyah languages|Kenyah]], noting especially resemblances with [[Aslian languages|Aslian]]. As further evidence for his proposal, Blench also cites ethnographic evidence such as musical instruments in Borneo shared in common with Austroasiatic-speaking groups in mainland Southeast Asia.
*'''[[Lepcha language|Lepcha]] substratum''' ("'''''Rongic'''''").<ref>Blench, Roger. 2013. [https://www.academia.edu/5562335/Rongic_a_vanished_branch_of_Austroasiatic ''Rongic: a vanished branch of Austroasiatic'']. m.s.</ref> Many words of Austroasiatic origin have been noticed in Lepcha, suggesting a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] superstrate laid over an Austroasiatic substrate. Blench (2013) calls this branch "''Rongic''" based on the Lepcha autonym ''Róng''.

Other languages with proposed Austroasiatic substrata are:
*'''[[Jiamao language|Jiamao]]''', based on evidence from the register system of Jiamao, a [[Hlai languages|Hlai]] language (Thurgood 1992). <ref>Thurgood, Graham. 1992. The aberrancy of the Jiamao dialect of Hlai: speculation on its origins and history. In Ratliff, Martha S. and Schiller, E. (eds.), Papers from the First Annual Meeting of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society, 417-433. Arizona State University, Program for Southeast Asian Studies.</ref> Jiamao is known for its highly aberrant vocabulary.

[[Gérard Diffloth|Diffloth]] compares reconstructions of various clades, and attempts to classify them based on shared innovations, though like other classifications the evidence has not been published. As a schematic, we have:

This family tree is consistent with recent studies of migration of Y-Chromosomal [[Haplogroup O-M95 (Y-DNA)|haplogroup O2a1-M95]]. However, the dates obtained from by [[Zhivotovsky method]] DNA studies are several times older than that given by linguists.<ref name="Kumar">Kumar, Vikrant et al., Y-chromosome evidence suggests a common paternal heritage of Austroasiatic populations, BMC Evol Biol. 2007, 7: 47.</ref> The route map of the people with haplogroup O2a1-M95, speaking this language can be seen in this link.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/47/figure/F1 |title=Figure |doi=10.1186/1471-2148-7-47 |publisher=www.biomedcentral.com |date= |accessdate=11 March 2012}}</ref> Other geneticists criticise the Zhivotovsky method.

===Ilia Peiros (2004)===
Peiros is a [[lexicostatistics|lexicostatistic]] classification, based on percentages of shared vocabulary. This means that a language may appear to be more distantly related than it actually is due to [[language contact]]. Indeed, when Sidwell (2009a) replicated Peiros's study with languages known well enough to account for loans, he did not find the internal (branching) structure below.

==Writing systems==
Other than Latin-based alphabets, many Austroasiatic languages are written with the ancient Khmer alphabet, [[Thai alphabet]] and [[Lao alphabet]]. Vietnamese divergently had an indigenous script based on Chinese logographic writing. This has since been supplanted by the Latin alphabet in the 20th century. The following are examples of past-used alphabets or current alphabets of Austroasiatic languages.
