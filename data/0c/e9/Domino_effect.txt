A '''domino effect''' or '''[[chain reaction]]''' is the cumulative effect produced when one event sets off a chain of similar events.<ref>{{cite web|title=domino effect|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/domino+effect|website=The Free Dictionary|publisher=Farlex, Inc.|accessdate=29 September 2014}}</ref> The term is best known as a mechanical effect, and is used as an [[analogy]] to a [[Domino show|falling row]] of [[dominoes]]. It typically refers to a linked sequence of events where the time between successive events is relatively small. It can be used literally (an observed series of actual collisions) or metaphorically (causal linkages within systems such as global finance or politics).
