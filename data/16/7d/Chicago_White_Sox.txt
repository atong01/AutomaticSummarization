The '''Chicago White Sox''' are an [[United States|American]] professional [[baseball]] team based in the [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]] of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. The White Sox are members of the [[American League]] (AL) [[American League Central|Central]] division in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB). The White Sox play their home games at [[U.S. Cellular Field]]. They are one of two major league clubs in Chicago; the other is the [[Chicago Cubs]], who are a member of the [[National League]] (NL) [[National League Central|Central]] division. The team is currently owned by [[Jerry Reinsdorf]].

One of the American League's eight charter [[Major North American professional sports teams|franchises]], the Chicago team was established as a major league baseball club in {{baseball year|1900}}. The club was originally called the Chicago White Stockings, but this was soon shortened to Chicago White Sox. The team played home games at [[South Side Park]] before, in {{baseball year|1910}}, moving to [[Comiskey Park]] for the next eight decades.

The White Sox won the [[1906 World Series]] with a defense-oriented team dubbed "the Hitless Wonders", and the [[1917 World Series]] led by [[Eddie Cicotte]], [[Eddie Collins]], and [[Shoeless Joe Jackson]].  The [[1919 World Series]] was marred by the [[Black Sox Scandal]], in which several members of the White Sox were accused of conspiring with gamblers to [[Match fixing|fix games]]. In response, Major League Baseball's new [[Commissioner of Baseball|Commissioner]] [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] banned the players from Major League Baseball for life.  In [[1959 Chicago White Sox season|1959]], led by [[Early Wynn]], [[Nellie Fox]], [[Luis Aparicio]] and manager [[Al Lopez]], the White Sox won the [[List of American League pennant winners|American League pennant]]. They won the AL pennant again in [[2005 Chicago White Sox season|2005]], when they also went on to win the [[2005 World Series|World Series]].

==History==
{{Main|History of the Chicago White Sox}}
[[File:1906 Chicago White Sox.jpg|thumb|right|x200px|1906 White Sox, with club founder Charles Comiskey]]
The White Sox originated as the Sioux City Cornhuskers of the [[Western League (original)|Western League]], a [[minor league]] under the parameters of the National Agreement with the [[National League]]. In 1894, [[Charles Comiskey]] bought the Cornhuskers and moved them to [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], where they became the [[St. Paul Saints]]. In 1900, with the approval of Western League president [[Ban Johnson]], Charles Comiskey moved the Saints into his hometown neighborhood of [[Armour Square, Chicago]], where they became known as the '''White Stockings,''' the former name of Chicago's National League team, the Orphans (now the [[Chicago Cubs]]).<ref>{{cite web|last=Bova|first=George|title=Sox Fans' Guide to Sox Uniforms|url=http://www.whitesoxinteractive.com/rwas/index.php?category=3&id=2104|website=FlyingSock.Com|publisher=White Sox Interactive|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref>

In [[1901 Major League Baseball season|1901]], the Western League broke the National Agreement and became the new major league [[American League]]. The very first season in the American League ended with a White Stockings championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1901.shtml|title=1901 American League Team Statistics and Standings|website=[[Baseball Reference]]|publisher=[[Sports Reference]]|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref> However, that would be the end of the season as the [[World Series]] did not begin until [[1903 World Series|1903]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Stezano|first=Martin|title=6 Things You May Not Know About the World Series|url=http://www.history.com/news/6-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-world-series|date=October 24, 2012|website=[[History (TV channel)|History]]|publisher=[[A&E Television Networks]]|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> The franchise, now known as the '''Chicago White Sox''', made its first World Series appearance in [[1906 World Series|1906]], beating the crosstown Cubs in six games.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1906_WS.shtml|title=1906 World Series|publisher=Sports Reference|website=Baseball Reference|accessdate=January 2, 2010}}</ref>

The White Sox would win a third pennant and second World Series in [[1917 Chicago White Sox season|1917]], beating the [[1917 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] in six games with help from stars [[Eddie Cicotte]] and [[Shoeless Joe|"Shoeless" Joe Jackson]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1917_WS.shtml|title=1917 World Series|publisher=Sports Reference|website=Baseball Reference|accessdate=January 2, 2010}}</ref> The Sox were heavily favored in the [[1919 World Series]], but lost to the [[1919 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] in 8 games. Huge bets on the Reds fueled speculation that the series had been [[Match fixing|fixed]]. A criminal investigation went on in the 1920 season, and though all players were acquitted, commissioner [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] banned eight of the White Sox players for life, in what was known as the [[Black Sox Scandal]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Black Sox|url=http://www.chicagohs.org/history/blacksox.html|website=[[Chicago Historical Society]]|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> This set the franchise back, as they did not win another pennant for 40 years.

The White Sox did not finish in the upper half of the American League again until after club founder Charles Comiskey died and passed ownership of the club to his son, [[J. Louis Comiskey]].<ref>{{cite web|title=J. Louis Comiskey|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=J_Louis_Comiskey|website=Baseball Library|publisher=Idea Logical|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref> They finished in the upper half most years between 1936-1946 under the leadership of manager [[Jimmy Dykes]], with star shortstop [[Luke Appling]], known as Ol' Aches and Pains, and pitcher [[Ted Lyons]]. Appling and Lyons have their numbers 4 and 16 retired.<ref>{{cite web|title=Retired Numbers|url=http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/cws/history/retired_numbers.jsp|website=WhiteSox.com|publisher=[[MLB Advanced Media]]|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref>

After J. Louis Comiskey died in 1939, ownership of the club was passed down to his widow, [[Grace Comiskey]]. The club was later passed down to Grace's children [[Dorothy Comiskey Rigney|Dorothy]] and [[Chuck Comiskey|Chuck]] in 1956, with Dorothy selling a majority share to a group led by [[Bill Veeck]] after the [[1958 Chicago White Sox season|1958 season]].<ref>{{cite web|title=All-Time Owners|url=http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/cws/history/owners.jsp|website=WhiteSox.com|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> Veeck was notorious for his promotional stunts, attracting fans to [[Comiskey Park]] with the new "exploding scoreboard" and outfield shower. In 1961, [[Arthur Allyn, Jr.]] briefly owned the club before selling to his brother [[John Allyn]].

From 1951-1967, the White Sox had their longest period of sustained success, scoring a winning record for 17 straight seasons. Known as the "Go-Go White Sox" for their tendency to focus on speed and getting on base versus power hitting, they featured stars such as [[Minnie Minoso]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Minnie Minoso|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/minosmi01.shtml|website=Baseball Reference|publisher=Sports Reference|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> [[Nellie Fox]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Nellie Fox|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/f/foxne01.shtml|website=Baseball Reference|publisher=Sports Reference|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> [[Luis Aparicio]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Luis Aparicio|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/a/aparilu01.shtml|website=Baseball Reference|publisher=Sport Reference|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> [[Billy Pierce]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Billy Pierce|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/p/piercbi02.shtml|website=Baseball Reference|publisher=Sport Reference|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> and [[Sherm Lollar]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Sherm Lollar|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/l/lollash01.shtml|website=Baseball Reference|publisher=Sport Reference|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> From 1957-1965, the Sox were managed by [[Al Lopez]]. The Sox finished in the upper half of the American League in eight of his nine seasons, including six years in the top two of the league.<ref>{{cite web|title=Al Lopez|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/managers/lopezal01.shtml|website=Baseball Reference|publisher=Sport Reference|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> In [[1959 Chicago White Sox season|1959]], the White Sox ended the [[New York Yankees]] dominance over the American League, and won their first pennant since the ill-fated 1919 campaign.<ref>{{cite web|title=1959 Chicago White Sox season|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHW/1959.shtml|website=Baseball Reference|publisher=Sport Reference|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> Despite winning game one of the [[1959 World Series]] 11-0, they fell to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] in six games.<ref>{{cite web|title=1959 World Series|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/postseason/mlb_ws_recaps.jsp?feature=1959|website=MLB.com|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref>

The late 60s and the 70s were a tumultuous time for the Sox, as they struggled to win games and attract fans. Allyn and [[Bud Selig]] agreed to a handshake deal that would give Selig control of the club and move them to [[Milwaukee]]; however, this was blocked by the American League.<ref name="BovaSOS">{{cite web|last=Bova|first=George|title=Save Our Sox!|url=http://whitesoxinteractive.com/History&Glory/SaveOurSox.htm|website=FlyingSock.com|publisher=White Sox Interactive|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref> Selig instead bought the [[Seattle Pilots]] and moved them to Milwaukee, putting enormous pressure on the American League to place a team in [[Seattle]]. A plan was in place for the Sox to move to Seattle and for [[Charlie Finley]] to move his [[Oakland A's]] to Chicago. However, Chicago had a renewed interest in the Sox after the 1972 season, and the American League instead added the expansion [[Seattle Mariners]]. The [[1972 Chicago White Sox season|1972 White Sox]]  were one of the lone successful season of this era, as [[Dick Allen]] wound up winning the American League MVP award.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dick Allen|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/a/allendi01.shtml?redir|website=Baseball Reference|publisher=Sport Reference|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> Some have said that Dick Allen is responsible for saving the White Sox in Chicago. Bill Veeck returned as owner of the Sox in 1975, and despite not having much money, they managed to win 90 games in [[1977 Chicago White Sox season|1977]], a team known as the South Side Hitmen.

However, the team's fortunes plummeted after the 1977 season, plagued by 90-loss teams and scarred by the notorious [[Disco Demolition Night]] promotion in 1979.<ref>{{cite news|last=Vettel|first=Phil|title=Steve Dahl's Disco Demolition at Comiskey Park|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/chi-chicagodays-disco-story-story.html|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> Bill Veeck was forced to sell the team. He rejected offers from ownership groups intent on moving the club to [[Denver]], eventually agreeing to sell the club to [[Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr.|Ed DeBartolo]], who was the only prospective owner who promised to keep the Sox in Chicago. However, DeBartolo was rejected by the owners, and the club was then sold to a group headed by [[Jerry Reinsdorf]] and [[Eddie Einhorn]]. The Reinsdorf era started off well, as the Sox won their first division title in [[1983 Chicago White Sox season|1983]], led by manager [[Tony La Russa]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Tony La Russa|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/managers/larusto01.shtml|website=Baseball Reference|publisher=Sport Reference|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> and stars [[Carlton Fisk]], [[Tom Paciorek]], [[Ron Kittle]], [[Harold Baines]], and [[LaMarr Hoyt]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1983 Chicago White Sox Season|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHW/1983.shtml|website=Baseball Reference|publisher=Sport Reference|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> During the 1986 season, La Russa was fired by announcer-turned-GM [[Ken Harrelson]]. La Russa went on to manage in six World Series (winning 3) with the [[Oakland A's]] and [[St. Louis Cardinals]], ending up in the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] as the third-winningest manager of all time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Garfein|first=Chuck|title=Hawk Opens Up on Firing La Russa|url=http://www.csnchicago.com/blog/sox-drawer/hawk-opens-firing-la-russa|date=February 4, 2013|website=[[CSN Chicago]]|accessdate=May 26, 2015}}</ref>

[[File:Frank Thomas 1997.jpg|thumb|Frank Thomas in 1997]]
The White Sox struggled for the rest of the 80s, as Chicago fought to keep the Sox in town. Reinsdorf wanted to replace the aging [[Comiskey Park]], and sought public funds to do so. When talks stalled, there was a strong offer to move the team to the [[Tampa, Florida]] area.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sullivan|first=Paul Francis|title=The Franchise moves that never happened|url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/the-franchise-moves-that-almost-happened/|date=June 21, 2011|website=[[The Hardball Times]]|accessdate=May 26, 2015}}</ref> Funding for a new ballpark was approved in an 11th hour deal by the [[Illinois State Legislature]] on June 30, 1988, with the stipulation that new park had to be built on the corner of 35th and Shields, across the street from the old ballpark, as opposed to the suburban ballpark the owners had designed.<ref name="BovaSOS" /> Architects offered to redesign the ballpark to a more "retro" feel that would fit in the city blocks around Comiskey Park; however, the ownership group was set on a 1991 open date, and so they kept the old design.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bova|first=George|title=A Conversation with Phillip Bess|url=http://whitesoxinteractive.com/FixComiskey/Bess/Conversation1.htm|website=FlyingSock.com|publisher=White Sox Interactive|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> In 1991, the [[new Comiskey Park]] opened. However, it would be rendered obsolete a year later with the opening of the retro-inspired [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]]. The park, now known as [[U.S. Cellular Field]], underwent many renovations in the early 2000s to give it a more retro feel.

The White Sox were fairly successful in the 1990s and early 2000s, with 12 winning seasons between 1990-2005. First Baseman [[Frank Thomas (designated hitter)|Frank Thomas]] became the face of the franchise, ending his career as the White Sox' all-time leader in runs, doubles, home runs, total bases and walks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Frank Thomas|url=http://baseballhall.org/hof/thomas-frank|publisher=[[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]]|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> Other major players included [[Robin Ventura]], [[Ozzie Guillen]], [[Jack McDowell]], and [[Bobby Thigpen]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1993 Chicago White Sox|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHW/1993.shtml|website=Baseball Reference|publisher=Sport Reference|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> The Sox would win the West division in [[1993 Chicago White Sox season|1993]], and were in first place in [[1994 Chicago White Sox season|1994]] when the season was cancelled due to the [[1994 MLB Strike]].

Guillen had marginal success during the rest of his tenure, with the Sox winning the Central Division title in [[2008 Chicago White Sox season|2008]] after a [[2008 American League Central tie-breaker game|one game playoff]] with the [[2008 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Merkin|first=Scott|title=White Sox claim AL Central Crown|url=http://m.whitesox.mlb.com/news/article/3576317/|date=October 1, 2008|website=WhiteSox.com|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref> However, Guillen left the White Sox after the [[2011 Chicago White Sox season|2011 season]], and was replaced by former teammate [[Robin Ventura]].

==Ballparks==
{{Main|U.S. Cellular Field}}

In the late 1980s, the franchise threatened to relocate to [[Tampa Bay Area|Tampa Bay]] (as did the [[San Francisco Giants]]), but frantic<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-05-12/news/8803160481_1_sox-owners-comiskey-park-james-thompson |work=Chicago Tribune | first=John | last=Kass | title=Thompson: Sox Vow To Stay If Bill Passes | date=May 12, 1988}}</ref> lobbying on the part of the Illinois governor [[James R. Thompson]] and state legislature resulted in approval (by one vote) of public funding for a new stadium. Although designed primarily as a baseball stadium (as opposed to a "multipurpose" stadium) New Comiskey Park (redubbed [[U.S. Cellular Field]] in 2003) was built in a 1960s style similar to [[Dodger Stadium]] and [[Kauffman Stadium]]. It opened in {{baseball year|1991}} to positive reviews; many praised its wide open concourses, excellent sight lines, and natural grass (unlike other stadiums of the era such as [[Rogers Centre]] in Toronto). However, it was quickly overshadowed in the public imagination by the wave of "nostalgia" or "retro" ballparks, beginning with [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]]. The park's inaugural season drew 2,934,154 fans&nbsp;— at the time, an all-time attendance record for any Chicago baseball team.

[[File:Uscellular.jpg|thumb|250px|View from the upper deck of U.S. Cellular Field in 2006]]
Despite a number of innovations in its original construction&nbsp;— including a lower deck concourse that circumscribes the entire stadium, allowing a view of the game from any location&nbsp;— the park was often criticized for its sterile appearance and steep upper deck.

In recent years, money accrued from the sale of naming rights to [[U.S. Cellular]] has been allocated for renovations to make the park more aesthetically appealing and fan friendly. Notable renovations of early phases included: re-orientation of the bullpens parallel to the field of play (thus decreasing slightly the formerly symmetrical dimensions of the outfield); filling seats in up to and shortening the outfield wall; ballooning foul-line seat sections out toward the field of play; creating a new multi-tiered [[batter's eye]], allowing fans to see out through one-way screens from the center-field vantage point, and complete with concession stand and bar-style seating on its 'fan deck'; renovating all concourse areas with brick, historic murals, and new concession stand ornaments to establish a more friendly feel. The stadium's steel and concrete was repainted dark gray and black. The scoreboard Jumbotron was also replaced with a new [[Mitsubishi]] Diamondvision [[High-definition television|HDTV]] giant screen.

More recently, the top quarter of the upper deck was removed in {{baseball year|2004}} and a black wrought metal roof was placed over it, covering all but the first eight rows of seats. This decreased [[seating capacity]] from 47,098 to 40,615. 2005 also saw the introduction of the Scout Seats, redesignating (and re-upholstering) 200 lower deck seats behind home plate as an exclusive area, with seat-side waitstaff and a complete restaurant located underneath the concourse. The most significant structural addition besides the new roof was {{baseball year|2005}}'s FUNdamentals Deck, a multi-tiered structure on the left field concourse containing batting cages, a small [[Tee Ball]] field, speed pitch, and several other child-themed activities intended to entertain and educate young fans with the help of coaching staff from the Chicago Bulls/Sox Training Academy. This structure was used during the 2005 playoffs by [[ESPN]] and [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] as a broadcasting platform.

Designed as a 7-phase plan, the renovations were completed before the {{baseball year|2007}} season with the 7th and final phase. The most visible renovation in this final phase was replacing the original blue seats with green seats. The upper deck already had new green seats, put in before the beginning of the 2006 season. Beginning with the {{baseball year|2007}} season a new luxury seating section was added in the former press box. This section has amenities similar to those of the Scout Seats section. After the 2007 season the ballpark continued renovation projects despite that the 7-phase plan was complete.

==Logos and uniforms==
{{See also|Major League Baseball uniforms}}
Over the years the White Sox have become noted for many of their [[baseball uniform|uniform]] innovations and changes. In 1960, the White Sox became the first team in the major sports to put players' last names on [[jersey (clothing)#In sports|jerseys]].

[[File:Im cws logo 1912.png|frame|1912–1917, 1919–1929, 1931, and 1936–1938 Chicago White Sox logo]]

In 1912 the White Sox debuted one of the most enduring and famous [[logo]]s in baseball—a large "S" in a Roman-style [[font]], with a small "O" inside the top loop of the "S" and a small "X" inside the bottom loop. This is the logo associated with the 1917 World Series championship team and the 1919 Black Sox. With a couple of brief interruptions, the dark-blue logo with the large "S" lasted through 1938 (but continued in a modified block style into the 1940s). Through the 1940s, the White Sox team colors were primarily navy blue trimmed with red.

The White Sox logo in the 1950s and 1960s (actually beginning in the 1949 season) was the word "SOX" in an Old English font, diagonally arranged, with the "S" larger than the other two letters. From 1949 through 1963, the primary color was black (trimmed with red after 1951). The Old English "SOX" in black lettering is the logo associated with the Go-Go Sox era.

In 1964, the primary color went back to navy blue, and the road uniforms changed from gray to pale blue. In 1971, the team's primary color changed from royal blue to red, with the color of their [[pin stripes|pinstripes]] and [[baseball cap|caps]] changing to red. The 1971–1975 uniform included red [[baseball uniform#Stockings and pants|socks]].

[[File:White Sox old logo.png|frame|Chicago White Sox logo from 1976 to 1987]]

In 1976 the team's uniforms changed again. The team's primary color changed back from red to navy. The team based their uniforms on a style worn in the early days of the franchise, with white jerseys worn at home, blue on the [[road (sports)|road]]. The team brought back white socks for the last time in team history. The socks featured a different stripe pattern every year. The team also had the option to wear blue or white pants with either jersey. Additionally the teams "SOX" logo was changed to a modern-looking "SOX" in a bold font, with 'CHICAGO' written across the jersey. Finally, the team's logo featured a [[silhouette]] of a batter over the words "SOX".

The new uniforms also featured [[collar (clothing)|collars]] and were designed to be worn untucked&nbsp;— both unprecedented. Yet by far the most unusual wrinkle was the option to wear shorts, which the White Sox did for the first game of a [[doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]] against the [[Kansas City Royals]] in 1976. The [[Hollywood Stars]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]] had previously tried the same concept, it was also poorly received. Apart from aesthetic issues, as a practical matter shorts are not conducive to sliding, due to the likelihood of significant abrasions.

Upon taking over the team in 1980 new owners [[Eddie Einhorn]] and [[Jerry Reinsdorf]] announced a contest where fans were invited to create new uniforms for the White Sox. The winning entry was submitted by a fan where the word "SOX" was written across the front of the jersey, in the same font as a cap, inside of a large blue stripe trimmed with red. The red and blue stripes were also on the sleeves, and the road jerseys were gray to the home whites.  In those jerseys the White Sox won 99 games and the AL West championship in 1983, the best record in the majors.

[[File:White Sox Alt Logo.svg|thumb|150px|Alternate logo, on road uniforms from 1990 to 2011]]

After five years those uniforms were retired and replaced with a more basic uniform which had "White Sox" written across the front in script, with "Chicago" on the front of the road jersey. The cap logo was also changed to a cursive "C", although the batter logo was retained for several years.

For a mid-season 1990 game at Comiskey Park the White Sox appeared once in a uniform based on that of the 1917 White Sox.

The White Sox then switched their regular uniform style once more.  In September, for the final series at Old Comiskey Park, the old English "SOX" logo (a slightly simplified version of the 1949–63 logo) was restored, and the new uniform also had the black pinstripes restored. The team's primary color changed back to black, this time with silver trim. The team also introduced a new flying sock logo which appeared as a sleeve patch on the away and alternate uniforms until 2011 when the patch was switched with the primary logo on the away uniform. With minor modifications (i.e., occasionally wearing vests, black game jerseys) the White Sox have used this style ever since.

During the 2012 and 2013 seasons, the White Sox wore their throwback uniforms at home every Sunday, starting with the 1972 red-pinstriped throwback jerseys worn during the 2012 season, followed by the 1981–86 uniforms the next season. In the 2014 season, the "Winning Ugly" throwbacks were promoted to full-time alternate status, and is now worn at home on select dates. In one game during the 2014 season, the White Sox paired their throwbacks with a cap featuring the batter logo instead of the wordmark "SOX"; this is currently their batting practice cap prior to games in the throwback uniforms.

===Nicknames===
The White Sox were originally known as the White Stockings, a reference to the original name of the [[Chicago Cubs]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Chicago Cubs Team History & Encyclopedia|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHC/|website=Baseball Reference|publisher=Sports Reference|accessdate=December 28, 2014}}</ref> To fit the name in headlines, local newspapers such as the [[Chicago Tribune]] abbreviated the name alternatively to Stox and Sox.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Engber|first=Daniel|title=X Marks The Baseball team|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2005/10/x_marks_the_baseball_team.html|date=October 25, 2015|magazine=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|department=Explainer|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref> Charles Comiskey would officially adopt the White Sox nickname in the club's first years, making them the first team to officially use the "Sox" name.

Other nicknames include the synonymous "Pale Hose";<ref>{{cite web|last=DeFord|first=Frank|title=The Finest Nickname in Baseball|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4656212|date=May 18, 2005|website=National Public Radio|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref> "the ChiSox", a combination of "Chicago" and "Sox", used mostly by the national media to differentiate them between the Boston Red Sox (BoSox); and "the Good Guys", a reference to the team's one-time motto "Good guys wear black", coined by broadcaster [[Ken Harrelson]]. Most fans and Chicago media refer to the team as simply "the Sox". The [[Spanish language]] media sometimes refer to the team as ''Medias Blancas'' for "White Socks."

Several White Sox teams have received nicknames over the years:

*The [[1906 Chicago White Sox season|1906 team]] were known as the '''Hitless Wonders,''' due to their .230 batting average, worst in the American League.<ref>{{cite web|title=1906: The Hitless Wonders|url=http://www.thisgreatgame.com/1906-baseball-history.html|website=This Great Game|accessdate=December 28, 2014}}</ref> Despite their hitting woes, the Sox would beat the crosstown Cubs for their first world title.

*The [[1959 Chicago White Sox season|1959 White Sox]] were referred to as the '''Go-Go White Sox''' due to their speed-based offense. The period from 1950-1964, in which the White Sox had 15 consecutive winning seasons, is sometimes referred to as the Go-Go Era.<ref>{{cite news|last=Secter|first=Bob|title=The 1959 'Go-Go' White Sox and the air-raid sirens|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/chi-chicagodays-whitesox1959-story-story.html|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=December 28, 2014}}</ref>

===Mascots===
[[File:Southpaw.jpg|thumb|right|Southpaw]]
{{See also|List of Major League Baseball mascots}}
From 1961 until 1991, lifelong Chicago resident Andrew Rozdilsky performed as the unofficial yet popular [[mascot]] "[[Andy the Clown]]" for the White Sox at the original Comiskey Park. Known for his elongated "Come on you White Sox" battle cry, Andy got his start after a group of friends invited him to a Sox game in 1960, where he decided to wear his clown costume and entertain fans in his section. That response was so positive that when he won free [[1961 Chicago White Sox season|1961]] season tickets, he decided to wear his costume to all games.<ref>{{cite news|last=Singer|first=Stacey|title=Andrew Rozdilsky, 77, Clown for Sox|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-09-24/news/9509240307_1_clown-international-harvester-home-opener|date=September 24, 1995|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref> Comiskey Park ushers eventually offered free admission to Rozdilsky.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ley|first=Tom|title=A Brief History of Terrible Chicago Mascots|url=http://deadspin.com/a-brief-history-of-terrible-chicago-mascots-1501106550|date=January 14, 2014|website=[[Deadspin]]|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref> Starting in [[1981 Chicago White Sox season|1981]], the new ownership group led by Jerry Reinsdorf introduced a twosome, called [[Ribbie and Roobarb]], as the official team mascots, and banned Rozdilsky from performing in the lower seating level. Ribbie and Roobarb were very unpopular, as they were seen as an attempt to get rid of the beloved Andy the Clown.<ref>{{cite web|title=White Sox History: The sad story of Ribbie and Roobarb|url=http://www.southsidesox.com/2013/3/16/4106198/white-sox-history-the-sad-story-of-ribbie-and-roobarb|date=March 16, 2013|website=South Side Sox|publisher=SBNation|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref>

In 1988, the Sox got rid of Ribbie and Roobarb, and Andy The Clown was not permitted to perform in new Comiskey Park when it opened in [[1991 Chicago White Sox season|1991]]. In the early 1990s the White Sox had a cartoon mascot named, 'Waldo The White Sox Wolf' that advertised the ‘Silver and Black Pack’, the team kid's club at the time. The team's current mascot, [[Southpaw (mascot)|SouthPaw]], was introduced in 2004 to attract young fans.<ref>{{cite web|last=Padilla|first=Doug|title=Sox: 'No grief about our mascot'|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/chicago/white-sox/post/_/id/17962/sox-no-grief-about-our-mascot|date=January 23, 2014|website=ESPN Chicago|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref>

Similar to the [[Boston Red Sox]] with "[[Sweet Caroline]]" and the [[New York Yankees]] with "[[Theme from New York, New York]]", several songs have become associated with the White Sox over the years. They include:
*[[Let's Go, Go-Go White Sox|"Let's Go Go Go White Sox"]] by [[Captain Stubby and the Buccaneers]] - A tribute to the "Go-Go White Sox" of the late 1950s, this song serves as the unofficial fight song of the White Sox. In 2005, scoreboard operator Jeff Szynal found a record of the song and played it for a "Turn Back the Clock" game against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], whom the Sox played in the [[1959 World Series]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Theiser|first=Kelly|title=Go-Go song revival a hit with fans|url=http://m.whitesox.mlb.com/news/article/1254100/|date=October 18, 2005|website=White Sox official website|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref> After catcher [[A.J.

===Rivalries===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2008}}
{{Original research|section|date=August 2008}}

====Crosstown Classic====
[[File:West Side Grounds 1905.jpg|thumb|right|Fielder Jones of the White Sox hits the ball against Cubs at West Side Grounds, 1905]]
{{Main|Cubs–White Sox rivalry}}
The [[Chicago Cubs]] are the [[Cubs–White Sox rivalry|crosstown rivals]] of the White Sox, a rivalry that some made fun of prior to the White Sox's 2005 title because both of them had extremely long championship droughts. The nature of the rivalry is unique; with the exception of the [[1906 World Series]], in which the White Sox upset the favored Cubs, the teams never met in an official game until {{baseball year|1997}}, when interleague play was introduced. In the intervening time, the two teams sometimes met for exhibition games. The White Sox currently lead the regular season series 48–39, winning the last 4 seasons in a row. The BP Crosstown Cup was introduced in 2010 and the White Sox have won the trophy each time. There have been seven series sweeps since interleague play began: four by the Cubs in 1998, 2004, 2007, and 2008, and three by the White Sox in 1999, 2008 and 2012, with 1999 and 2012 occurring in Wrigley Field.

An example of this volatile rivalry is the game played between the White Sox and the [[Chicago Cubs]] at [[U.S. Cellular Field]] on May 20, {{baseball year|2006}}. White Sox catcher [[A. J. Pierzynski]] was running home on a sacrifice fly by center fielder [[Brian Anderson (outfielder)|Brian Anderson]] and smashed into Cubs catcher [[Michael Barrett (baseball)|Michael Barrett]], who was blocking home plate. Pierzynski lost his helmet in the collision, and slapped the plate as he rose. Barrett stopped him and, after exchanging a few words, punched Pierzynski in the face, causing a melee to ensue. Brian Anderson and Cubs first baseman [[John Mabry]] got involved in a separate confrontation, although it was later determined that Mabry was attempting to be a peacemaker. After 10 minutes of conferring following the fight, the umpires ejected Pierzynski, Barrett, Anderson, and Mabry. As Pierzynski entered his dugout, he pumped his arms, causing the soldout crowd at [[U.S. Cellular Field]] to erupt in cheers. When play resumed, White Sox second baseman [[Tadahito Iguchi]] blasted a grand slam to put the White Sox up 5–0 on their way to a 7–0 win over their crosstown rivals. While there are other major league cities and metropolitan areas in which two teams co-exist, all of the others feature at least one team which began playing there in {{baseball year|1961}} or later, whereas the White Sox and Cubs have been competing for their city's fans since 1901.

====Divisional====
{{main|White Sox-Tigers Rivalry}}

The White Sox enjoy healthy divisional rivalries. The [[Detroit Tigers]] are one of Chicago's primary rivals, and the cities of Chicago and Detroit share rivalries in other sports as well, such as the [[Bulls–Pistons rivalry]], [[Blackhawks–Red Wings rivalry]] and the [[Bears–Lions rivalry]]. The rivalry has had its fair share of fights as well.

{{main|White Sox-Twins rivalry}}

The [[Minnesota Twins]] are high-profile rivals as well, with fans of both teams showing up to US Cellular Field in healthy numbers. The White Sox and Twins also played in a one-game playoff in [[2008 American League Central tie-breaker game|2008]], the White Sox would win the game 1–0 and the division.

Chicago has another rivalry with the [[Cleveland Indians]], who always enjoy a large away contingent at U.S. Cellular Field. The rivalry first started upon the creation of the AL Central in 1994. On July 15, 1994 an umpire confiscated [[Albert Belle]]'s bat, presuming that it was corked. They put it in the umpire's room at Comiskey Park. However, Indians pitcher [[Jason Grimsley]] climbed through the ceiling from the visitor's clubhouse and stole the bat. The theft was discovered and Belle was suspended; Grimsley later owned up to the theft. Belle further inflamed matters by spurning the Indians and signing a large free agent contract with the White Sox in 1997.

====Historical====
A historical regional rival was the St. Louis Browns. Through the 1953 season, the two teams were located pretty close to each other (including the 1901 season when the Browns were the Milwaukee Brewers), and could have been seen as the American League equivalent of the [[Cardinals–Cubs rivalry]], being that Chicago and St. Louis have for years been connected by the same highway ([[U.S. Route 66]] and now [[Interstate 55]]). The rivalry has been somewhat revived at times in the past, involving the Browns' current identity, the [[Baltimore Orioles]], most notably in 1983.

The current [[Milwaukee Brewers]] franchise was also a primary White Sox rival, due to the proximity of the two cities, and with the teams competing in the same division for the 1970 and 1971 seasons, and then again from 1994 to 1997. The rivalry died down however, when the Brewers moved to the [[National League]] in 1998.

An [[NBC]] owned & operated station, it was the home of the Sox until the 1996 season (with the exception of brief stints on [[WRDZ (AM)|1300 AM WTAQ]] and [[WBBM (AM)|780 AM WBBM]]). After Elson's retirement in 1970, [[Harry Caray]] began his tenure as the voice of the White Sox, on radio as well as on television. Although best remembered as a broadcaster for the rival Cubs, Caray was very popular with White Sox fans, pining for a "cold one" during broadcasts.<ref>{{cite web|title=1989 Ford Frick Award Winner Harry Caray|url=http://baseballhall.org/discover/awards/ford-c-frick/harry-caray|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> Caray would often broadcast from the stands, sitting at a table set up amidst the bleachers. It became a badge of honor among Sox fans to "Buy Harry a beer..." By game's end you'd see a large stack of empty beer cups beside his microphone. This only endeared him to fans that much more. In fact, it was with the Sox that he started his tradition of leading the fans in the singing of [[Take Me Out To The Ballgame]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Bohn|first=Matt|title=Harry Caray|url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/d6a6a34e|website=SABR.org|publisher=Society for American Baseball Research|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> Caray, alongside color analyst [[Jimmy Piersall]], was never afraid to criticize the Sox, which angered numerous Sox managers and players, notably [[Bill Melton]] and [[Chuck Tanner]]. He left to succeed [[Jack Brickhouse]] as the voice of the Cubs in 1981, where he became a national icon.

The White Sox shifted through several announcers in the 80s, before hiring [[John Rooney (sportscaster)|John Rooney]] as play-by-play announcer in 1989. In 1992, he was paired with color announcer [[Ed Farmer]]. In 14 seasons together, the duo became a highly celebrated announcing team, even being ranked by [[USA Today]] as the top broadcasting team in the American League.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gardner|first=Steve|title=Rooney, Farmer give White Sox AL's top radio team|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2005-07-26-announcers-al_x.htm|date=July 26, 2005|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref> Starting with Rooney and Farmer's fifth season together, Sox games returned to the 1000 AM frequency for the first time in 30 years (now the [[ESPN Radio|ESPN owned & operated]] station [[WMVP (AM)|WMVP]]). The last game on WMVP was Game 4 of the 2005 World Series, with the White Sox clinching their first World Series title in 88 years. That also was Rooney's last game with the Sox, as he left to join the radio broadcast team of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]].

In 2006, radio broadcasts returned to 670 AM, now the [[CBS Radio|CBS-Owned]] all-sports station [[WSCR]], branded as 670 the Score. Ed Farmer became the play-by-play man after Rooney left, joined in the booth by [[Chris Singleton (baseball)|Chris Singleton]] from 2006–07 and then [[Steve Stone (baseball)|Steve Stone]] in 2008. In 2009, [[Darrin Jackson]] became the color announcer for White Sox radio, where he remains today.<ref>{{cite web|title=Broadcasters|url=http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/team/broadcasters.jsp?c_id=cws|website=WhiteSox.com|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> Farmer and Jackson are joined by Chris Rogney, who hosts pregame and postgame shows on WSCR. The [[Chicago White Sox Radio Network]] currently has 18 affiliates in 3 states, and the White Sox are on contract with 670 the Score through the 2015 season.<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio Afiliates|url=http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/cws/schedule/radio_affiliates.jsp|website=WhiteSox.com|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> As of recently, White Sox games are also broadcast in Spanish with play-by-play announcer [[Hector Molina]] joined in the booth by Billy Russo.<ref>{{cite web|title=White Sox Announce new Spanish radio broadcasters|url=http://m.whitesox.mlb.com/news/article/27702400/white-sox-announce-new-spanish-radio-broadcasters|date=March 28, 2012|website=WhiteSox.com|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|department=Press release|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref> Formerly broadcasting on [[ESPN Deportes Radio]] via [[WEBG|WNUA]], games will begin to be broadcast on [[WRTO (AM)|1200 AM WRTO]] during the 2015 season.<ref>{{cite web|title=2015 Broadcast Schedule|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/schedule/broadcast/index.jsp?c_id=cws|website=Official Site of the Chicago White Sox|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|accessdate=March 4, 2015}}</ref>

===Television===
White Sox games appeared sporadically on television throughout the first half of the 20th century, most commonly announced by Jack Brickhouse on Channel 9, [[WGN-TV]]. Starting in 1968, [[Jack Drees]] took play-by-play duties as the Sox were broadcast on channel 32, [[WFLD]].<ref>{{cite web|title=All-Time Broadcasters- Television|url=http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/cws/history/broadcasters.jsp|website=WhiteSox.com|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> After 1972, Harry Caray (joined by Jimmy Piersall in 1977) began double duty as a TV and Radio announcer for the Sox, as broadcasts were moved to channel 44, [[WSNS-TV]], from 1972-1980, followed by one year on WGN-TV.

[[Don Drysdale]] became the play-by-play announcer in 1982, as the White Sox began splitting their broadcasts between WFLD and the new Pay-TV channel, [[Sportsvision]]. Ahead of its time, Sportsvision had a chance to gain huge profits for the Sox. However, few people would subscribe to the channel after being used to free-to-air broadcasts for many years, resulting in the franchise losing around $300,000 a month.<ref>{{cite web|title=White Sox History: The story of SportsVision|url=http://www.southsidesox.com/2012/11/30/3707810/white-sox-history-the-story-of-sportsvision|date=November 30, 2012|website=South Side Sox|publisher=SB Nation|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> While this was going on, every Cubs game was on WGN, with Harry Caray becoming the national icon he never was with the White Sox. The relatively easy access to Cubs games versus Sox games in this era, combined with the popularity of Caray and the Cubs being owned by the [[Tribune Company]], is said by some to be the main cause of the Cubs advantage in popularity over the Sox.

[[File:Hawk Harrelson 2007 CROP.jpg|thumb|235px|Harrelson in the broadcast booth in 2007]]
Three major changes to White Sox broadcasting happened each year from 1989 to 1991: in 1989, Sportsvision was replaced by the [[cable TV]] channel [[FSN Chicago|SportsChannel Chicago]]. In 1990, over-the-air broadcasts shifted back to WGN. And in 1991, [[Ken Harrelson]] became the play by play announcer of the White Sox.<ref>{{cite web|last=Edelman|first=Alexander|title=Ken Harrelson|url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/442dbc70|website=SABR.org|publisher=Society for American Baseball Research|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> One of the most polarizing figures in baseball, "Hawk" has been both adored and scorned for his emotive announcing style. His history of calling out umpires has earned him reprimands from the Commissioner's office, and he has been said to be the most biased announcer in baseball.<ref>{{cite news|title=Selig reprimands Harrelson for rant against umpire|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-06-01/sports/chi-selig-reprimands-harrelson-for-rant-against-umpire-20120601_1_umpire-friday-s-white-sox-selig|date=June 1, 2012|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref> However, Harrelson has said that he is proud of being "the biggest homer in baseball," saying that he is a White Sox fan like his viewers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Diamond|first=Jared|title=How Biased Is Your Announcer?|url=http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10000872396390444180004578016652376246198|date=September 26, 2012|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref>

Currently, White Sox local television broadcasts are split between three channels: the majority of games are broadcast on cable by the regional sports network [[Comcast SportsNet Chicago]] (which the club has a 20% stake in), and remaining games are produced by [[WGN Sports]] and are broadcast locally on either [[WGN-TV]] or [[WPWR-TV]]. WGN and WPWR games are also occasionally picked up by local stations in Illinois, Iowa, and Indiana. In the past, WGN games were broadcast nationally on the [[WGN America]] superstation, but those broadcasts ended after the 2014 season as WGN America began its transition to a standard cable station.<ref>{{cite web|last=Feder|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Feder|title=WGN America comes home to Chicago|url=http://www.robertfeder.com/2014/12/15/wgn-america-comes-home-to-chicago/|date=December 15, 2014|website=Robert Feder|subscription=yes|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref> WGN Sports-produced White Sox games not carried by WGN-TV were carried by [[WCIU-TV]] until the 2015 season, when they moved to [[MyNetworkTV]] station WPWR-TV.<ref name=trib-whitesoxwpwr>{{cite news|last=Sherman|first=Ed|title=White Sox add WPWR-Ch. 50 to station rotation|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/whitesox/chi-white-sox-channel-50-20150219-story.html|date=February 19, 2015|accessdate=May 25, 2015|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}</ref>

The announcers are the same no matter where the games are broadcast: Harrelson provides play-by-play, and [[Steve Stone (baseball)|Steve Stone]] has provided color analysis since 2009.<ref>{{cite web|last=Berger|first=Ralph|title=Steve Stone|url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/a906928e|website=SABR.org|publisher=Society for American Baseball Research|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> Games that are broadcast on CSN Chicago feature pregame and postgame shows, hosted by Chuck Garfein with analysis from [[Bill Melton]] and occasionally [[Frank Thomas (designated hitter)|Frank Thomas]].
