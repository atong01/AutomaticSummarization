The interned Jewish refugees came from Germany, as the U.S. government did not differentiate between ethnic Jews and ethnic Germans (the term &quot;Jewish&quot; was defined as a religious practice, not an ethnicity). Some of the internees of European descent were interned only briefly, while others were held for several years beyond the end of the war. Like the Japanese internees, these smaller groups had American-born citizens in their numbers, especially among the children. A few members of ethnicities of other Axis countries were interned, but exact numbers are unknown.</paragraph><heading level='2'>World War II internment camps under Executive Order 9066</heading><paragraph>Secretary of War<space/><link><target>Henry L.

As construction on the more permanent and isolated WRA camps was completed, the population was transferred by truck or train. These accommodations consisted of tar paper-walled frame buildings in parts of the country with bitter winters and often hot summers. The camps were guarded by armed soldiers and fenced with barbed wire (security measures not shown in published photographs of the camps). Camps held up to 18,000 people, and were small cities, with medical care, food, and education provided by the government. Adults were offered &quot;camp jobs&quot; with wages of $12 to $19 per month, and many camp services such as medical care and education were provided by the camp inmates themselves.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Calisphere"></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Post-World War II</heading><paragraph>In December 1944, President Roosevelt suspended Executive Order 9066.
