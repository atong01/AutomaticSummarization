In 2009, the spending budget was increased by 25% and totaled $920 millions.

== History ==
{{Main|Military history of Ecuador}}

[[File:Ecuador-peru-land-claims-01.png|thumb|Map of the long-lasting territorial dispute between [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]], settled only in 1998. (in Spanish)]]

[[Ecuador]]'s [[military]] history dates far back to its first attempt to secure freedom from [[Spain]] in 1811. In 1822 Ecuadorian troops, alongside other rebel forces, scored a [[decisive victory]] over the [[Spain|Spanish]] royalist [[army]] at the [[Battle of Pichincha]]. Although assisted by Peruvian troops, it would fight these only a few years later in 1828, as a member of the Confederation of [[Gran Colombia]]. Confederation forces, fewer than half of which were [[Ecuadorians]],{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} defeated a much larger Peruvian force near [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]], at the [[Battle of Tarqui]]. Eventually, Civil War would plunge the country and the army into disorder. In 1941 the Ecuadorian Military found itself weak and disorganized; the by now long-lasting territorial dispute with [[Peru]] escalated into a major conflict, the [[Ecuadorian–Peruvian War|Ecuadorian–Peruvian War of 1941]]. A much larger and better equipped Peruvian force quickly overwhelmed the Ecuadorian forces, driving them back and invading the Ecuadorian territory. Ecuador had no choice but to accept Peru's territorial claims and signed [[Rio Protocol|Peace treaty]] in 1942. However, the treaty of 1942 failed to settle the border dispute and occasional clashes occurred in a then still non-demarcated border area between the nations. These clashes flared into another outbreak of serious fighting in January 1981 called the [[Paquisha War]]; similar incidents occurred in 1983 and again in 1984. The last [[military]] conflict with Peru occurred in 1995, during the [[Cenepa War]], in which both sides claimed to be fighting inside their own territory until the signing of a ceasefire and the eventual separation of forces. The longest-running source of armed international conflict in the Western Hemisphere had ended.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyguy.com/hgnews_ecuador-peru.html |title=News:Ecuador-Peru |publisher=The History Guy |date= |accessdate=28 July 2010}}</ref>

The present day '''Ecuadorian Navy''' or (''Armada del Ecuador'') is a compact, efficient and well-balanced force. However, limited funds hinder any major acquisitions and the chances of maintaining a strong force within the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Since end 2009, the Navy's structure became simplified. The Ecuadorian Naval-Zone became one and measures, {{convert|2237|km|0|abbr=on}} of the [[Pacific Coast]] and 6,720&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of the [[Pacific Ocean]], (including the [[Galápagos Islands]]). Most sea-going assets are based at [[Guayaquil]]. The Navy focuses mainly on the border-control and illegal immigration. The [[Ecuadorian Navy|Navy]] operates around 20 major vessels (including two submarines) and 25 aircraft. It has a personnel of 7,258.<ref name="ccmr.org"/> To increase its operational capabilities it acquired recently:

== Equipment sources ==
Historically, [[Ecuador]] depended on a wide variety of foreign suppliers for virtually all of its equipment needs. Only in the 1980s did it begin to develop a modest domestic arms industry as the Directorate of Army Industries manufactured rifle ammunition, uniforms, boots, and other consumable items.

In the 1960s and 1970s, [[France]] became a leading supplier and delivered [[AMX-13]] tanks and various aircraft. [[Ecuador]] purchased also [[Type 209 submarine]]s and [[Lürssen]]-Seawolf TNC 45 patrol boats from [[West Germany]]. Whereas various types of [[Infantry]] weapons were acquired from [[Belgium]].

[[Ecuador]] became a substantial customer for [[Israel]]i arms in the 1970s, purchasing [[IAI Arava|Arava aircraft]], [[Gabriel missile]] for naval patrol crafts and [[Uzi]] submachine guns. Under technical assistance contracts, [[Israel]] serviced [[Israel]]i planes within the [[Ecuadorian Air Force|air force]] inventory as well as [[Boeing]] civilian aircraft flown by [[TAME]] and ''Ecuatoriana Airlines''. [[Ecuador]] reportedly also employed [[Israel]]i security specialists as consultants in the fight against terrorism. In 1976 [[Ecuador]] became the first foreign country to order the [[Kfir]], an advanced jet-fighter equipped with the General Electric J-79 engine produced in [[Israel]] under license. The transaction, which required [[United States]] government approval because of the engine technology, was rejected by the administration of President [[Jimmy Carter]] in order to discourage the proliferation of sophisticated military equipment in the [[Third World]]. The action caused an uproar in [[Israel]] where the sale was regarded as an important breakthrough in [[Israel]]s efforts to develop international markets for the [[Kfir]]. In 1981, after the inauguration of President [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Federal government of the United States|Washington]] removed its objection to the sale. Although the contract called for the purchase of 12 [[Kfir]]s and an option to purchase an additional 12, [[Ecuador]] acquired only the original group, at a price estimated at US$196 million.

[[Ecuador]] became a relatively heavy importer of arms in the late 1970s and early 1980s, averaging US$150 million annually and reaching a peak of US$280 million in 1982. These imports declined sharply to an average of only US$50 million annually between 1985 and 1987, presumably as a result of a dramatic reduction in oil revenues and the precipitous drop in the value of the [[Ecuadorian sucre|sucre]], which made imported arms extremely expensive. Between 1983 and 1987, [[Ecuador]] imported an estimated US$460 million of arms, primarily from [[Italy]], [[France]], the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. In 1995, during the [[Cenepa War]] against [[Peru]], [[Argentina]] gave to [[Ecuador]] in a controversial move, 6.500 [[ton]]s of rifles, cannons, [[anti-tank rockets]], and ammunition.<ref>{{cite news|author=Redacción BBC Mundo |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/latin_america/newsid_7274000/7274638.stm |title=BBC Mundo &#124; América Latina &#124; Así fue la última guerra |publisher=BBC News |date= 3 March 2008|accessdate=28 July 2010}}</ref>

Recent times saw changes within [[Ecuador]]s foreign policy and it decided to look for alternative weapon suppliers. These were found also, in its long-term allies [[Chile]], which sold since 2008 [[Leopard 1]] tanks, [[Leander class frigate]]s. [[Israel]], delivered in 2009 its [[unmanned aerial vehicles]] and [[Brazil]], supplied additional military vehicles and [[Embraer EMB 314 Super Tucano|Super Tucano]] combat-aircraft. Countries like [[Russia]] and [[China]] had already delivered a small quantity of military equipment some years earlier, but gained on importance during the past few years. Since then, Chinese radars, anti-aircraft systems and infantry weapons were purchased. In 2009 two additional [[Mil Mi-17]] helicopters have been ordered from [[Russia]] with further deals planned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=108411&sectionid=351020706 |title=Ecuador seeks arms deal with Russia |publisher=Presstv.ir |date=11 October 2009 |accessdate=28 July 2010}}</ref> [[India]] delivered [[HAL Dhruv]] helicopters and [[South Africa]] is about to deliver 12 [[Atlas Cheetah]] [[supersonic]]-aircraft. [[Ecuador]]'s political ally, [[Venezuela]], donated military equipment and six [[Dassault Mirage 5|Mirage 50]] aircraft. In 2010, the [[Diplomatic mission|U.S. embassy]] in [[Ecuador]] announced that it had delivered $1.2 million of donated military equipment to the Ecuadorian military. The donations were intended to support operations countering drug-smuggling and guerilla activity along its [[Colombia]]n border.
