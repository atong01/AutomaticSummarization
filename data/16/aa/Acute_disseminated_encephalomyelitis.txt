'''Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis''' ('''ADEM''') (or acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis) is a rare [[autoimmune]] disease marked by a sudden, widespread attack of inflammation in the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]].  ADEM also attacks the nerves of the central nervous system and damages their myelin insulation, which, as a result, destroys the [[white matter]]. It is often triggered after the patient has received a [[virus (biology)|viral]] [[infection]] or [[vaccination]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dale RC |title=Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis |journal=Semin Pediatr Infect Dis |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=90–5 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12881796 |doi=10.1053/spid.2003.127225 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Garg RK |title=Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis |journal=Postgrad Med J |volume=79 |issue=927 |pages=11–7 |date=January 2003 |pmid=12566545 |doi= 10.1136/pmj.79.927.11|url=http://pmj.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12566545 |pmc=1742586}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Jones CT |title=Childhood autoimmune neurologic diseases of the central nervous system |journal=Neurol Clin |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=745–64 |date=November 2003 |pmid=14743647 |doi= 10.1016/S0733-8619(03)00007-0|url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Huynh W, Cordato DJ, Kehdi E, Masters LT, Dedousis C |title=Post-vaccination encephalomyelitis: literature review and illustrative case |journal=J Clin Neurosci |volume=15 |issue=12 |pages=:1315–1322 |date=Dec 2008 |pmid=18976924 |doi=10.1016/j.jocn.2008.05.002 |url= |last2=Cordato |last3=Kehdi |last4=Masters |last5=Dedousis }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Rust RS |title=Multiple sclerosis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and related conditions |journal=Semin Pediatr Neurol |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=66–90 |date=June 2000 |pmid=10914409 |doi= 10.1053/pb.2000.6693|url=}}</ref><ref name="Poser and Brinar 2007">{{cite journal |author=Poser CM, Brinar VV |title=Disseminated encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis: two different diseases - a critical review |journal=Acta Neurol.

ADEM's symptoms resemble the symptoms of [[multiple sclerosis]] (MS), so the disease itself is sorted into the classification of the [[multiple sclerosis borderline]] diseases. However, ADEM has several features that distinguish it from MS.<ref>Lauren B. Krupp et al. Consensus definitions proposed for pediatric multiple sclerosis and related disorders, 2007 by AAN Enterprises, Inc. [http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/documents/neurology/files/Consensus%20definitions%20proposed%20for%20pediatric%20multiple%20sclerosis%20and%20related%20disorders%20(International%20Pediatric%20MS%20Study%20Group,%20Neurology,%202007)(1).pdf]</ref> Unlike MS, ADEM occurs usually in children and is marked with rapid fever, although adolescents and adults can get the disease too. ADEM consists of a single flare-up whereas MS is marked with several flare-ups over a long period of time. ADEM is also distinguished by a loss of consciousness, coma and death, which is very rare in MS, except in severe cases.

The incidence rate is about 8 per 1,000,000 people per year.<ref name="Leake et al. 2004">{{cite journal |author=Leake JA, Albani S, Kao AS |title=Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in childhood: epidemiologic, clinical and laboratory features |journal=Pediatr.

ADEM produces multiple [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] [[lesion]]s in the brain and [[spinal cord]], particularly in the [[white matter]].

==Presentation==
ADEM has an abrupt onset and a monophasic course. Symptoms usually begin 1–3 weeks after infection. Major symptoms include [[fever]], [[headache]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], [[confusion]], [[Blindness|vision impairment]], drowsiness, [[non-epileptic seizure|seizure]]s and [[coma]]. Although initially the symptoms are usually mild, they worsen rapidly over the course of hours to days, with the average time to maximum severity being about four and a half days.<ref name="Tenembaum et al. 2002" /> Additional symptoms include hemiparesis, paraparesis, and cranial nerve palsies.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Allmendinger A, Krauthamer A, Spektor V | year = 2009 | title = Case of the month | url = http://www.diagnosticimaging.com/case-studies/content/article/113619/1493546 | journal = Diagnostic Imaging | volume = 31 | issue = 12| page = 10 }}</ref>

==Treatment==
No controlled clinical trials have been conducted on ADEM treatment, but aggressive treatment aimed at rapidly reducing inflammation of the CNS is standard. The widely accepted [[first-line treatment]] is high doses of intravenous [[corticosteroid]]s,<ref name="Shahar et al. 2002" /> such as [[methylprednisolone]] or [[dexamethasone]], followed by 3–6 weeks of gradually lower oral doses of [[prednisolone]]. Patients treated with methylprednisolone have shown better outcomes than those treated with dexamethasone.<ref name="Tenembaum et al. 2002" /> Oral tapers of less than three weeks duration show a higher chance of relapsing,<ref name="Anlar B, Basaran C, Kose G, et al. 2003 194–9" /><ref name="Dale RC, de Sousa C, Chong WK, Cox TC, Harding B, Neville BG 2000 2407–22" /> and tend to show poorer outcomes.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}} Other anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapies have been reported to show beneficial effect, such as [[plasmapheresis]], high doses of intravenous [[immunoglobulin]] (IVIg),<ref name="Shahar et al. 2002">{{cite journal |author=Shahar E, Andraus J, Savitzki D, Pilar G, Zelnik N |title=Outcome of severe encephalomyelitis in children: effect of high-dose methylprednisolone and immunoglobulins |journal=J.

These are considered alternative therapies, used when corticosteroids cannot be used, or fail to show an effect.

There is some evidence to suggest that patients may respond to a combination of methylprednisolone and immunoglobulins if they fail to respond to either separately<ref>{{cite journal |author=Straussberg R, Schonfeld T, Weitz R, Karmazyn B, Harel L |title=Improvement of atypical acute disseminated encephalomyelitis with steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins |journal=Pediatr.

In a study of 16 children with ADEM, 10 recovered completely after high-dose methylprednisolone, one severe case that failed to respond to steroids recovered completely after IV Ig; the five most severe cases -with ADAM and severe [[peripheral neuropathy]]- were treated with combined high-dose methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin, two remained paraplegic, one had motor and cognitive handicaps, and two recovered.<ref name="Shahar et al. 2002" /> A recent review of IVIg treatment of ADEM (of which the previous study formed the bulk of the cases) found that 70% of children showed complete recovery after treatment with IVIg, or IVIg plus corticosteroids.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Feasby T, Banwell B, Benstead T |title=Guidelines on the use of intravenous immune globulin for neurologic conditions |journal=Transfus Med Rev |volume=21 |issue=2 Suppl 1 |pages=S57–107 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17397768 |doi=10.1016/j.tmrv.2007.01.002 |url=|display-authors=etal}}</ref> A study of IVIg treatment in adults with ADEM showed that IVIg seems more effective in treating sensory and motor disturbances, while steroids seem more effective in treating impairments of cognition, consciousness and rigor.<ref name="Ravaglia S, Piccolo G, Ceroni M, et al. 2007 1518–23" /> This same study found one subject, a 71-year-old man who had not responded to steroids, that responded to an IVIg treatment 58 days after disease onset.

==Prognosis==
Full recovery is seen in  50 to 70% of cases, ranging to 70 to 90% recovery with some minor residual disability (typically assessed using measures such as [[Modified Rankin Scale|mRS]] or [[Expanded Disability Status Scale|EDSS]]), average time to recover is one to six months.<ref name="Menge et al. 2007" /> The mortality rate may be as high as 5%.<ref name="Menge et al. 2007" /> Poorer outcomes are associated with unresponsiveness to steroid therapy, unusually severe neurological symptoms, or sudden onset. Children tend to have more favorable outcomes than adults, and cases presenting without fevers tend to have poorer outcomes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lin CH, Jeng JS, Hsieh ST, Yip PK, Wu RM |title=Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis: a follow-up study in Taiwan |journal=J.

===Motor deficits===
Residual motor deficits are estimated to remain in about 8 to 30% of cases, the range in severity from mild clumsiness to [[ataxia]] and [[hemiparesis]].<ref name="Tenembaum et al. 2007" />

Again, all groups means were within one standard deviation of the controls, meaning that while effects were statistically reliable, the children were as a whole, still within the normal range. There were also more behavioural problems in the early onset group, although there is some suggestion that this may be due, at least in part, to the stress of hospitalization at a young age.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Douglas JW |title=Early hospital admissions and later disturbances of behaviour and learning |journal=Dev Med Child Neurol |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=456–80 |date=August 1975 |pmid=1158052 |doi= 10.1111/j.1469-8749.1975.tb03497.x|url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Daviss WB, Racusin R, Fleischer A, Mooney D, Ford JD, McHugo GJ |title=Acute stress disorder symptomatology during hospitalization for pediatric injury |journal=J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=569–75 |date=May 2000 |pmid=10802974 |doi= 10.1097/00004583-200005000-00010|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0890-8567&volume=39&issue=5&spage=569}}</ref>

==Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis==
While ADEM and MS both involve autoimmune demyelination, they differ in many clinical, genetic, imaging, and histopathological aspects.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wingerchuk DM, Lucchinetti CF |title=Comparative immunopathogenesis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, neuromyelitis optica, and multiple sclerosis |journal=Curr.

Normally ADEM appears in children after a vaccination and it is monophasic. Nevertheless, ADEM can appear in adults, and can also be clinically multiphasic.<ref>Lauren B. Krupp et al, Consensus definitions proposed for
pediatric multiple sclerosis and related disorders. NEUROLOGY 2007;68(Suppl 2):S7–S12</ref>

Problems for differential diagnosis increase due to the lack of agreement for a definition of Multiple Sclerosis.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lassmann H | year = | title = Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 133 | issue = | pages = 317–319 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awp342 }}</ref> For some people MS should be considered a clinical entity based in inflammatory lesions separated in time and space.<ref name="pmid11456302">{{cite journal |author=McDonald WI, Compston A, Edan G |title=Recommended diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis: guidelines from the International Panel on the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis|url=|journal=[[Ann.

The pathology of ADEM is very similar to that of MS with some differences. The pathological hallmark of ADEM is perivenular inflammation with limited ‘‘sleeves of demyelination.’’.<ref>Nathan P. Young, Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis: Current Understanding and Controversies. Thieme Medical Publishers (Semin Neurol. 2008 Feb;28(1):84-94) [https://www.orpha.net/data/patho/Pro/en/AcuteDisseminatedEncephalomyelitisr-FRenPro11590v01.pdf]</ref>

Plaques in the white matter in MS are sharply delineated, while the [[glial scar]] in ADEM is smooth. Axons are better preserved in ADEM lesions. Inflammation in ADEM is widely disseminated and ill-defined, and finally, lesions are strictly perivenous, while in MS they are disposed around veins, but not so sharply.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lu Z, Zhang B, Qiu W, Kang Z, Shen L | year = 2011 | title = Comparative Brain Stem Lesions on MRI of Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis, Neuromyelitis Optica, and Multiple Sclerosis | url = | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 8| page = e22766 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0022766 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>

Nevertheless, the co-occurrence of perivenous and confluent demyelination in some individuals suggests pathogenic overlap between acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis and misclassification even with biopsy<ref>{{cite journal | author = Nathan P. | year = 2010 | title = Young ''et al.''

==Multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis==

When the patient suffers more than one demyelinating episode of ADEM, the disease is then called '''recurrent disseminated encephalomyelitis''' or '''multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis'''<ref name="Dale RC, de Sousa C, Chong WK, Cox TC, Harding B, Neville BG 2000 2407–22" /> (MDEM).

It has been found that anti-[[Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein|MOG]] auto-antibodies are related to this kind of ADEM<ref>M. Baumann, E.M. Hennes, K. Schanda, M. Karenfort, B. Bajer-Kornek, K.

==Acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis==

Acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (AHL, or AHLE), also known as acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE), acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis (AHEM), acute necrotizing hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (ANHLE), Weston-Hurst syndrome, or Hurst's disease, is a hyperacute and frequently fatal form of ADEM.
