'''Cluny''' or '''Clugny''' is a [[Communes of France|commune]] in the [[Saône-et-Loire]] [[Departments of France|department]] of the [[Regions of France|region]] of [[Burgundy]], in eastern [[France]]. It is 20&nbsp;km northwest of [[Mâcon]].

The town grew up around the [[Benedictine]] [[Abbey of Cluny]], founded by Duke [[William I of Aquitaine]] in 910. The height of Cluniac influence was from the second half of the 10th century through the early 12th. The abbey was sacked by the [[Huguenots]] in 1562, and many of its valuable manuscripts were destroyed or removed.

==Geography==
The river [[Grosne River|Grosne]] flows northward through the commune and crosses the town.
