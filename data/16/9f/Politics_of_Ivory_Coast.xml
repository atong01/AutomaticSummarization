Most countries maintain their embassies in Abidjan, although some (including the United Kingdom) have closed their missions because of the continuing violence and attacks on Europeans. The population continues to suffer because of an ongoing civil war. International human rights organizations have noted problems with the treatment of captive non-combatants by both sides and the re-emergence of child slavery among workers in cocoa production. Since the incident on 19 September 2002 (see<space/><link><target>History of Ivory Coast</target></link>), a civil war broke out, and the north part of the country has been seized by the rebels, the<space/><italics><link><target>Forces Nouvelles de Cte d'Ivoire</target><part>New Forces</part></link></italics><space/>(FN). A new presidential election was expected to be held in October 2005. However, this new election could not be held on time due to delay in preparation and has been postponed to October 2006 after an agreement was reached amongst the rival parties. After a long delay, elections were finally held in 2010.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Civil war</heading><paragraph><template><target>further</target><arg>Civil war in CÃ´te d'Ivoire</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Troops, mostly hailing from the north of the country, mutinied in the early hours of September 19, 2002.

The events in Abidjan shows that it is not a tribal issue, but a crisis of transition from a dictatorship to a democracy, with the clashes inherent in the definition of citizenship.Forces involved in the conflict include:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>Government forces, the National Army (FANCI), also called<space/><italics>loyalists</italics>, formed and equipped essentially since 2003</listitem><listitem>The<space/><italics><link><target>Congrs Panafricain des Jeunes et des Patriotes</target><part>Young Patriots</part></link></italics>: nationalist groups aligned with President<space/><link><target>Laurent Gbagbo</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Mercenaries</target></link><space/>recruited by President Gbagbo:<list type='bullet'><listitem>allegedly,<space/><link><target>Belarus</target><trail>ians</trail></link></listitem><listitem>some former combatants of<space/><link><target>Liberia</target></link>, including under-17 youths, forming the so-called &quot;Lima militia&quot;<space/><link type='external' href='http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/03/30/cotedi10404.htm'></link></listitem></list></listitem><listitem><italics><link><target>Forces Nouvelles de Cte d'Ivoire</target><part>New Forces</part></link></italics><space/>(Forces Nouvelles, FN), ex-northern rebels, who hold 60% of the country; their political expression is the<space/><italics>Mouvement patriotique de Cte d'Ivoire</italics>, or MPCI</listitem><listitem>French forces: troops sent within the framework of<space/><link><target>Operation Unicorn</target></link><space/>and under<space/><link><target>UN Mandate</target><part>UN mandate</part></link><space/>(<link><target>United Nations Operation in Cte d'Ivoire</target></link>), 3000 men in February 2003 and 4600 in November 2004;</listitem><listitem>Soldiers of the<space/><link><target>Economic Community of West African States</target></link><space/>(ECOWAS),<space/><italics>White helmets</italics>, also under the UN.</listitem></list><preblock><preline></preline></preblock><heading level='2'>Executive branch</heading><paragraph><template><target>office-table</target></template>|<link><target>President of Ivory Coast</target><part>President</part></link>|<link><target>Alassane Ouattara</target></link>|<link><target>Rally of the Republicans</target></link>|4 December 2011|-|<link><target>List of heads of government of Ivory Coast</target><part>Prime Minister</part></link>|<link><target>Daniel Kablan Duncan</target></link>|<link><target>Democratic Party of Cte d'Ivoire African Democratic Rally</target><part>Democratic Party</part></link>|21 November 2012|}</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Ivory Coast</target></link>'s 1959 constitution provides for strong presidency within the framework of a<space/><link><target>separation of powers</target></link>.

According to the constitution, the President of the National Assembly assumes the presidency in the event of a vacancy, and he completes the remainder of the deceased president's term. The cabinet is selected by and is responsible to the president.

Gbagbo was elected president in 2000 in an election boycotted by many oppositional forces. The president is elected by popular vote for a five-year term; election last held 26 October 2000. The prime minister is usually appointed by the president. The present prime minister is appointed by the international community (South African President Jacob Zuma, Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo and Niger President Mamadu Tandja) as transitional Prime Minister following a resolution of the UN Security Council and a resolution of the African Union.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Legislative branch</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Asnat codivoire.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part><link><target>National Assembly of Ivory Coast</target></link>.</part></link>The<space/><link><target>National Assembly of Ivory Coast</target><part>National Assembly</part></link><space/>(<italics>Assemble Nationale</italics>) has 225 members, elected for a five-year term in single-seat<space/><link><target>constituency</target><part>constituencies</part></link>.
