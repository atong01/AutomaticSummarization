A '''school voucher''', also called an '''education voucher''', with the system overall being called the '''voucher system''', is a certificate of funding issued by the government, which the parents of a schoolchild have control of and are able to direct towards the public or private school of their own choosing to fully or partially pay for the tuition of their child at that school for that year, term or semester.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} In some countries, states or local jurisdictions, the voucher can be used to cover or reimburse [[home schooling]] expenses.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} In some countries, vouchers only exist for tuition at private schools.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}  Under many non-voucher education systems, people who pay for private schooling are still taxed for public schools, these parents fund both public schools (through taxes) and private schools (through tuition) simultaneously; although, in some countries, states or local jurisdictions (e.g. in [[Australia]]) private schools may still receive substantial government funding.<ref>{{cite web|title=Private schools reap government funding at expense of public schools|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/private-schools-reap-government-funding-at-expense-of-public-schools-20140128-31jj0.html|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=February 8, 2014|date=January 28, 2014}}</ref>

==History==
The oldest continuing school voucher programs existing today in the United States are the Town Tuitioning programs in Vermont and Maine, beginning in 1869<ref name=Vermont>{{cite web|url= http://www.friedmanfoundation.org/friedman/schoolchoice/ShowProgramItem.do?id=32|title=Friedman Foundation - Vermont: Town Tuitioning Program}}</ref> and 1873<ref name=maine>{{cite web|url=http://www.friedmanfoundation.org/friedman/schoolchoice/ShowProgramItem.do?id=23|title=Friedman Foundation - Maine: Town Tuitioning Program}}</ref> respectively. Because some towns in these states operate neither local high schools nor elementary schools, students in these towns "are eligible for a voucher to attend [either] public schools in other towns or non-religious private schools. In these cases, the 'sending' towns pay tuition directly to the 'receiving' schools."<ref name=Vermont/><ref name=maine/>

{{Disputed-section|date=March 2014}} A system of educational vouchers was introduced in the Netherlands in 1917. Today, more than 70% of pupils attend privately run but publicly funded schools, mostly split along denominational lines.<ref name="RDV 1997">{{cite journal |journal=Economics of Education Review |volume=16 |issue=3 |date=June 1997 |pages=329–335 |doi=10.1016/S0272-7757(96)00078-7 |title=School finance and school choice in the Netherlands |author=Jozef M.

Nobel Prize–winning economist [[Milton Friedman]] argued for the modern concept of vouchers in the 1950s, stating that competition would improve schools and cost efficiency.  The view further gained popularity with the 1980 TV broadcast of Friedman's book ''[[Free to Choose]]'' for which video chapter 6 was devoted entirely to promoting educational freedom through programs like school vouchers.<ref>[http://www.freetochoose.tv/ See Volume 6 - "What's Wrong with our Schools"]</ref>

In some Southern states during the 1960s, school vouchers were used as a method of perpetuating segregation. In a few instances, public schools were closed outright and vouchers were issued to parents. The vouchers, in many cases, were only good at privately segregated schools, known as [[segregation academies]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Vergakis |first=Brock |url=http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,660226540,00.html |title=Deseret Morning News - Do vouchers equal segregation? |publisher=Deseretnews.com |date=June 4, 2007 |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref> In 2005, [[Allah Bakhsh Malik|Dr. Allah Bakhsh Malik]] Managing Director Punjab Education Foundation, under the supervision of Professor Henry M. Levin introduced Education Vouchers scheme in Pakistan with the features of equity, productivity, social cohesion and freedom of choice.

==Definitions==
There are important distinctions between different kinds of schools:
* [[State school|Public schools]] operate publicly and are funded by [[taxation|taxes]].
* [[Private school]]s operate privately and are funded by private money such as [[tuition]] or donations.
* '''School vouchers''' are subsidies given directly to parents for tuition at any school (there is technically no such thing as a "voucher school").
* [[Charter school]]s are publicly funded schools which operate privately.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uscharterschools.org |title=US Charter Schools Home |publisher=Uscharterschools.org |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref><ref name="What is a Charter School">{{cite web|url=http://www.publicschoolreview.com/articles/3 |title=What is a Charter School? |publisher=Public School Review |date=December 4, 2007 |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref><ref name=ISR>{{cite journal

* [[school choice|Open enrollment]] is the process of allowing parents to choose which public school their child attends instead of being assigned one (provided the school has not reached its maximum capacity number for students). This is sometimes confused with vouchers as a promotion for [[school choice]].
* Education tax credit, tuition tax credit, or tax-credit scholarship:<ref name = "NeoVouchers" >Kevin G. Welner, ''NeoVouchers: The Emergence of Tuition Tax Credits for Private Schooling'' Rowman & Littlefield (September 29, 2008), hardcover, 194 pages, ISBN 0742540790 ISBN 978-0742540798; trade paperback, Rowman & Littlefield (September 29, 2008), ISBN 0742540804 ISBN 978-0742540804</ref> There are two types of education tax credits: personal use, and donation.  Personal use tax credits are tax credits given to individual taxpayers for education expenditures made on behalf of their own children.  Donation tax credits are tax credits given to individual taxpayers or businesses who donate to nonprofit organizations that give out private school scholarships.<ref name=NYTBD>{{cite news|title=Public Money Finds Back Door to Private Schools|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/22/education/scholarship-funds-meant-for-needy-benefit-private-schools.html|accessdate=May 22, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 21, 2012|author=Stephanie Saul}}</ref>

==Controversy==
{{Globalize/US|date=December 2010}}

===Proponents===
Proponents assert that school voucher and education tax credit systems promote [[free market]] competition among both private and public schools. By allowing parents and students to "vote with their feet," they incentivize schools to increase accountability and school performance.<ref>https://mises.org/media/2349/Roads-Education-and-Waterways-The-Case-Against-Public-Services</ref> Proponents argue that the competition spurred by vouchers and education tax credits increases the quality and efficiencies of both eligible private schools and local public schools, as they both must perpetually improve in order to maintain enrollment caused by the competitive nature of [[dollar voting]] and the swift accountability that results from increasing [[consumer sovereignty]] - allowing individuals to control what product or service they prefer to buy as opposed to a [[Public administration|bureaucracy]].<ref>http://ingrimayne.com/econ/AllocatingRationing/DollarVoting.html</ref><ref>http://ingrimayne.com/econ/government/MajorityRule.html</ref>

The argument that school vouchers increases quality and efficiencies in schools forced to compete is supported by studies such as "When Schools Compete: The Effects of Vouchers on Florida Public School Achievement" ([[Manhattan Institute for Policy Research]], 2003), which concluded that public schools located near private schools that were eligible to accept voucher students made significantly more improvements than did similar schools not located near eligible private schools. Stanford's C.M. Hoxby, who has researched the systemic effects of school choice, determined that areas with greater residential school choice have consistently higher test scores at a lower per-pupil cost than areas with very few school districts (see Hoxby, 1998).  Hoxby found that the effects of vouchers in Milwaukee and of charter schools in Arizona and Michigan on nearby public schools forced to compete made greater test score gains than schools not faced with such competition (see Hoxby, 2001), and that the so-called effect of [[cream skimming]] did not exist in any of the voucher districts examined. Hoxby's research has found that both private and public schools improved through the use of vouchers.<ref>Hoxby, Caroline, “Rising Tide” Education Next, Winter, 2001.</ref><ref>Hoxby, Caroline “Analyzing School Choice Reforms that Use America’s Traditional Forms of Parental Choice” in Paul E. Peterson and Bryan C. Hassel eds., Learning from School Choice, Brookings Institution, 1998.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/ewp_02.htm |title=Education Working Paper 2 &#124; When Schools Compete: The Effects of Vouchers on Florida Public School Achievement |publisher=Manhattan-institute.org |date=March 14, 2001 |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allianceforschoolchoice.org/UploadedFiles/ResearchResources/Competition-%20Hoxby.pdf |title=chap06.choice |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref>  Also, similar competition has helped in manufacturing, energy, transportation, and parcel postal ([[United Parcel Service|UPS]], [[FedEx]] vs. [[USPS]]) sectors of government that have been [[Socialism|socialized]] and later opened up to free market competition.<ref>([http://www.fee.org/publications/the-freeman/article.asp?aid=2237)] http://www.fee.org/publications/the-freeman/article.asp?aid=2237([http://www.lexingtoninstitute.org/713.shtml])http://www.lexingtoninstitute.org/713.shtml</ref>

Similarly, it is argued that such competition has helped in higher education, with publicly funded universities directly competing with private universities for tuition money provided by the Government, such as the [[GI Bill]] and the [[Pell Grant]] in the United States. The [[Foundation for Educational Choice]] alleges that a school voucher plan "embodies exactly the same principle as the GI bills that provide for educational benefits to military veterans. The veteran gets a voucher good only for educational expense and he is completely free to choose the school at which he uses it, provided that it satisfies certain standards."<ref>http://www.edchoice.org/The-Friedmans/The-Friedmans-on-School-Choice/What-s-Wrong-with-Our-Schools-.aspx</ref>

Proponents claim that frequently institutions are forced to operate at higher efficiencies when they are allowed to compete<ref>([http://www.allianceforschoolchoice.org/UploadedFiles/ResearchResources/Competition-%20Hoxby.pdf])http://www.allianceforschoolchoice.org/UploadedFiles/ResearchResources/Competition-%20Hoxby.pdf</ref> and that any resulting job losses in the public sector would be offset by the increased demand for jobs in the private sector.<ref>([http://www.friedmanfoundation.org/friedman/downloadFile.do?id=284])http://www.friedmanfoundation.org/friedman/downloadFile.do?id=284</ref>

[[Friedrich von Hayek]] on the privatizing of education:

{{quote|As has been shown by Professor Milton Friedman (M. Friedman, The role of government in education, 1955), it would now be entirely practicable to defray the costs of general education out of the public purse without maintaining government schools, by giving the parents vouchers covering the cost of education of each child which they could hand over to schools of their choice. It may still be desirable that government directly provide schools in a few isolated communities where the number of children is too small (and the average cost of education therefore too high) for privately run schools. But with respect to the great majority of the population, it would undoubtedly be possible to leave the organization and management of education entirely to private efforts, with the government providing merely the basic finance and ensuring a minimum standard for all schools where the vouchers could be spent. (F. A. Hayek, in his 1960 book [[The Constitution of Liberty]], section 24.3)}}

{{quote|
The problem is bureaucracy. I'm one of these people who believes the best thing we could ever do is go to the full voucher system.

I have a 17-year-old daughter who went to a private school for a few years before high school. This private school is the best school I've seen in my life. It was judged one of the 100 best schools in America. It was phenomenal. The tuition was $5,500 a year, which is a lot of money for most parents. But the teachers were paid less than public school teachers - so it's not about money at the teacher level. I asked the state treasurer that year what California pays on average to send kids to school, and I believe it was $4,400. While there are not many parents who could come up with $5,500 a year, there are many who could come up with $1,000 a year.

If we gave vouchers to parents for $4,400 a year, schools would be starting right and left. People would get out of college and say, "Let's start a school."

Some proponents of school vouchers, including the Sutherland Institute and many supporters of the Utah voucher effort, see it as a remedy for the negative cultural impact caused by under-performing public schools, which falls disproportionately on demographic minorities.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} During the run-up to the November referendum election Sutherland issued a controversial publication:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sutherlandinstitute.org/uploads/vouchersvows.pdf |title=Sutherland Institute &#124; Vouchers Vows & Vexations |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref> Voucher, Vows, & Vexations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,695210997,00.html |title=Deseret Morning News &#124; Voucher foe in 'lion's den'? |publisher=Deseretnews.com |date=September 18, 2007 |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref> Sutherland called the publication an important review of the history of education in Utah while critics just called it revisionist history.<ref>[http://www.sutherlandinstitute.org/news/news_details.asp?c=1&id=274 The Sutherland Institute] {{wayback|url=http://www.sutherlandinstitute.org/news/news_details.asp?c=1&id=274 |date=20071217202856 }}</ref>  Sutherland then released the subsequent companion article in a law journal<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sutherlandinstitute.org/uploads/lawreview2008witte.pdf |title=Removing Classrooms from the Battlefield: Liberty, Paternalism, and the Redemptive Promise of Educational Choice, 2008 BYU Law Review 377 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref> as part of an academic conference about school choice.<ref>[http://lawreview.byu.edu/archives/2008_2.htm Law School Conference on School Choice] {{wayback|url=http://lawreview.byu.edu/archives/2008_2.htm |date=20150106215010 }}</ref>

The Friedman [[Foundation for Educational Choice]], founded by Milton and Rose Friedman in 1996, is a non-profit organization that promotes universal school vouchers and other forms of school choice. In defense of vouchers, it cites empirical research showing that students who were randomly assigned to receive vouchers had higher academic outcomes than students who applied for vouchers but lost a random lottery and did not receive them; and that vouchers improve academic outcomes at public schools, reduce racial segregation, deliver better services to special education students, and do not drain money from public schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.friedmanfoundation.org/friedman/downloadFile.do?id=255 |title=Forster, Greg.

===Opponents===
The main controversy over both school vouchers and education tax credits is that they put public education in direct competition with private education, threatening to reduce and reallocate public school funding to private schools.  Proponents of a voucher system are encouraged by private school sector growth as it is their view that private schools are typically more efficient at achieving results at a much lower per pupil cost when compared to public schools. A [[CATO Institute]] study of public and private school per pupil spending in Phoenix, Los Angeles, D.C., Chicago, New York City, and Houston found that public schools spend 93% more than estimated median private schools.<ref>{{cite web | last=Schaeffer | first=Adam | title=They Spend WHAT? (The Real Cost of Public Schools) | url=http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=11432 | publisher=Cato Institute | year=2010}}</ref> However, much variation exists in private school spending, so an average of how much "less" private schools spend as compared to public schools can be misleading.<ref>See Baker, B. (July 2009). Private schooling in the US: Expenditures, supply, and policy implications. [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/education/p/PRIVATE_REPORT.pdf]</ref>

[[Jonathan Kozol]], a former public school teacher and prominent public school reform thinker has called vouchers the "single worst, most dangerous idea to have entered education discourse in my adult life."<ref>Lisa Kaiser, "[http://www.expressmilwaukee.com/article-5728-an-interview-with-educator-and-activist-jonathan-kozol.html An Interview with Educator and Activist Jonathan Kozol]", March 4, 2009, Express Milwaukee.com</ref> Other public school teachers and teacher unions have also fought against school vouchers. In the United States, public school teacher unions,<ref>{{cite web|last=Bender |first=Michael C. |url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/state/content/state/epaper/2008/06/13/0613constitutionalamendments.html |title=Local News: West Palm Beach, Palm Beach County, Martin & St. Lucie Counties |publisher=The Palm Beach Post |date=June 13, 2008 |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref> most notably the [[National Education Association]] (the largest labor union in the USA), argue against the idea of school vouchers for concern that it would erode educational standards and reduce funding, and that giving money to parents who choose to send their child to a religious or other school is unconstitutional; however, the latter issue has been struck down by the [[Supreme Court]] case [[Zelman v. Simmons-Harris]], which upheld Ohio's voucher plan in a 5-4 ruling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryindex.com/pages/1661/Getting-an-Education-VOUCHER-CONTROVERSY.html |title=Getting an Education - The Voucher Controversy - School, Public, Schools, Charter, Private, and Vouchers |publisher=Libraryindex.com |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.org/home/16378.htm |title=Vouchers |publisher=NEA |date=October 30, 2008 |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.org/home/19133.htm |title=List of NEA beliefs and legal fights against vouchers |publisher=Nea.org |date=November 13, 2008 |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref> In contrast, the use of public school funding for vouchers to private schools was upheld by the Louisiana Supreme Court in 2013. In its ruling the Louisiana Supreme Court did not declare vouchers unconstitutional; just the use of money earmarked for public schools via the Louisiana Constitution for funding Louisiana's voucher program.<ref>See Strauss, V. (May 7, 2013). Louisiana Supreme Court rules school voucher funding unconstitutional. [http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/05/07/louisiana-supreme-court-rules-school-voucher-funding-unconstitutional/]</ref> The [[National Education Association]] also points out that access to vouchers is just like “a chance in a lottery” where parents had to have luckiness in order to get a space in this program. Since almost all students and their families would like to choose the best schools, those schools, as a result, quickly reach its maximum capacity number for students that state law permits. The major “unlucky families” then have to compete again to look for some other less preferred and competitive schools or give up searching and go back to their assigned local schools.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pons|first=Michael|title=School Vouchers: The Emerging Track Record|url=http://www.nea.org/home/16970.htm|publisher=National Education Association|accessdate=November 20, 2012}}</ref>

It is interesting to note that efforts to make vouchers available aren't always noticed by those able to use them.  In April 2012, a bill passed in Louisiana that made vouchers available to low-income families whose children attended poorly ranked schools.  Under the new law, any student whose household income was sufficiently low (up to about $44,000 for a family of three) that attended a school ranked "C", "D", or "F" could apply for vouchers to attend another school.<ref>[http://www.louisianaweekly.com/voucher-bills-pass/ See Tidmore, C. (2012, April 10).  Voucher bill passes]</ref>  Of the estimated 380,000<ref>See Mooney, K. (March 12, 2012). Louisiana legislature prepares to debate expansion of voucher program. [http://www.thepelicanpost.org/2012/03/12/louisiana-legislature-prepares-to-debate-expansion-of-voucher-program/]</ref> students that were eligible for the vouchers during the 2012-2013 school year (the same year the bill was passed), only 5,000 students knew about and applied for the vouchers, and accepted them.<ref>See Louisiana State Department of Education website for its Louisiana Scholarship program.[http://www.louisianabelieves.com/schools/louisiana-scholarship-program]</ref>

In 2006, the [[United States Department of Education]] released a report concluding that average test scores for reading and mathematics, when adjusted for student and school characteristics, tend to be very similar among public schools and private schools.  If results were left unadjusted for factors such as race, gender, and free or reduced price lunch program eligibility, private schools performed significantly better than public schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2006461 |title=Comparing Private Schools and Public Schools Using Hierarchical Linear Modeling |publisher=Nces.ed.gov |date=July 14, 2006 |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref> Other research questions assumptions that large improvements would result from a more comprehensive voucher system.<ref>[http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2008/wp2008_08.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, ''School Vouchers and Student Achievement: Recent Evidence, Remaining Questions'', August 2008]</ref>

Given the limited budget for schools, it is claimed that a voucher system would weaken public schools while at the same time not necessarily providing enough money for people to attend [[private school]]s. 76% of the money handed out for Arizona’s voucher program has gone to children already in private schools.<ref>{{cite book | last=Palast | first=Greg | title=Armed Madhouse (No Child's Behind Left) | url=http://www.gregpalast.com/no-childs-behind-left/ | publisher=Dutton Adult | year=2006 | isbn=0-525-94968-2}}</ref>

Some sources claim that public schools' higher per pupil spending is due to having a higher proportion of students with behavioral, physical and emotional problems. They argue that some, if not all, of the cost difference between public and private schools comes from a process known as [[cream skimming]]—selecting only those students that belong to a preferred economic, religious, or ethnic group—rather than from differences in administration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/briefs/bp-025.html |title=What Would A School Voucher Buy The Real Cost Of Private Schools |publisher=Cato.org |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://economics.about.com/b/2007/10/28/are-private-schools-more-cost-effective-than-public-ones.htm |title=Are Private Schools More Cost Effective Than Public Ones? |publisher=Economics.about.com |date=October 28, 2007 |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref>

In the United States, public schools must by law accept any student regardless of race, gender, religion, disability, etc. Thus, it has been argued that a voucher system would lead students who do not belong to a preferred religious or ethnic group, or those with disabilities, to become concentrated within the public school system.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Gifted Children Left Behind |author=Susan Goodkin and David G. Gold |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=August 27, 2007 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/26/AR2007082600909.html |accessdate=August 27, 2007}}</ref> Of the ten state-run voucher programs in the United States at the beginning of 2011, however, four targeted low-income students, two targeted students in failing schools, and six targeted students with special needs. (Note that Louisiana ran a single program targeting all three groups.)<ref>{{cite journal |last=Campanella |first=Andrew |title=Hope for America's Children (School Choice Yearbook 2010-11) |url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/AFC/scy2011.pdf |publisher=Alliance for School Choice |date=2011 }}</ref>

Another argument against the implementation of a school voucher system is its lack of accountability to the taxpayer. In many states, members of a community's board of education are elected by voters. Similarly, a school budget faces a referendum. Meetings of the Board of Education must be announced in advance, and members of the public are permitted to voice their concerns directly to board members. Although vouchers may be used in private and religious schools, taxpayers are not able to vote on budgetary issues, elect members of the board or even attend board meetings. [[Kevin G. Welner|Kevin Welner]] points out that vouchers funded through a convoluted tax credit system—a policy he calls "Neovouchers"—present additional accountability concerns. With neovoucher systems, a taxpayer owing money to the state instead donates that money to a private, nonprofit organization. That organization then bundles donations and gives them to parents as vouchers to be used for private school tuition. The state then steps in and forgives (through a tax credit) some or all of the taxes that the donor has given to the organization. While conventional tax credit systems are structured to treat all private school participants equally, neovoucher systems effectively delegate to individual private taxpayers (those owing money to the state) the power to decide which private schools will benefit.<ref>See Welner, Kevin G. (2008) [http://www.rowmanlittlefield.com/Catalog/SingleBook.shtml?command=Search&db=%5EDB/CATALOG.db&eqSKUdata=0742540790&thepassedurl=%5Bthepassedurl%5D NeoVouchers: The Emergence of Tuition Tax Credits for Private Schooling]. Rowman & Littlefield Publishers</ref>

An example of lack of accountability is the voucher situation in Louisiana. In 2012,  Louisiana State Superintendent of Education John White selected private schools to receive vouchers then attempted to fabricate criteria (including site visits) after schools had already received approval letters. One school of note, New Living Word in Ruston, Louisiana, did not have sufficient facilities for the over-300 students White and the state board of education had approved.<ref>See Leader, Barbara (July 2, 2012). Email exchange reveals voucher scheme. [http://www.thenewsstar.com/article/20120702/NEWS01/207020308/Email-exchange-reveals-voucher-scheme]</ref> Following a voucher audit in 2013, New Living Word had overcharged the state $395,000. White referred to the incident as a "lone substantive issue." <ref>See Sentell, W. (June 30, 2013). Ruston school banned from accepting voucher students. [http://theadvocate.com/home/6377589-125/ruston-school-banned-from-accepting]</ref>
However, most voucher schools did not undergo a complete audit for not having a separate checking account for state voucher money.<ref>See CenLamar (July 8, 2013).Audit reveals systemic, widespread problems in Louisiana's voucher program. [http://cenlamar.com/2013/07/08/audit-reveals-systemic-widespread-problems/]</ref>

According to Susanne Wiborg, an expert on comparative education, Sweden's voucher system introduced in 1992 has "augmented social and ethnic segregation, particularly in relation to schools in deprived areas."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-10725724 |title=Free schools 'could widen social divide' |first=Hannah |last=Richardson |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]] |date=July 22, 2010}}</ref>

Tax-credit scholarships which are in most part disbursed to current private school students or to families which made substantial donations to the scholarship fund, rather than to low-income students attempting to escape from failing schools, amount to nothing more than a mechanism to use public funds in the form of foregone taxes to support private, often religiously based, private schools.<ref name=NYTBD />

==Implementations==

===Chile===
In [[Chile]], there is an extensive voucher system in which the State pays private and municipal schools directly based on student attendance. This system covers nearly 90% of its students. It was introduced in 1981.<ref>{{cite journal |title=National Voucher Plans in Chile and Sweden: Did Privatization Reforms Make for Better Education? |first=Martin |last=Carnoy |journal=Comparative Education Review |volume=42 |issue=3 |date=August 1998 |pages=309–337 |jstor=1189163 |doi=10.1086/447510}}</ref> Dr. Martin Carnoy of Stanford, Patrick J. McEwan claims that based on his research, when controls for the student's background (parental income and education) are introduced, the difference in performance between public and private subsectors is not significant.<ref>''Does Privatization Improve Education? The Case of Chile's National Voucher Plan'' by Martin Carnoy and Patrick J. McEwan</ref>

===Europe===
In most European countries, education for all primary and secondary schools is fully subsidized. In some countries (e.g. Belgium), parents are free to choose which school their child attends.

====Ireland====
Most schools in Ireland are state-aided parish schools, established under diocesan patronage but with capital costs, teachers salaries and a per head fee paid to the school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.education.ie/home/home.jsp?maincat=&pcategory=17216&ecategory=20658&sectionpage=12251&language=EN&link=link001&page=1&doc=18626 |title=Irish Government Department of Education website'' |publisher=Education.ie |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref> These are given to the school regardless of whether or not it requires its students to pay fees. (Although fee-paying schools are in the minority, there has been much criticism over the state aid they receive with opponents claiming this gives them an unfair advantage.)

There is a recent trend towards multi-denominational schools established by parents, which are organised as limited companies without share capital. Parents and students are free to choose their own school. In the event of a school failing to attract students it immediately loses its per-head fee and over time loses its teaching posts- and teachers are moved to other schools which are attracting students. The system is perceived to have achieved very successful outcomes for most Irish children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/35/44/38574871.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Irish report 02_04_07.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref>

The 1995-7 Rainbow Coalition (which contained parties of the centre right and the left) introduced free third-level education to primary degree level. Critics of the latter development charge that it has not increased the number of students from economically deprived backgrounds attending university. However, studies have shown that the removal of tuition fees at third level has increased the number of students overall and those from lower socio-economic backgrounds. This concurs with evidence from the UK of a decrease in attendance numbers after the introduction of fees. However, since the economic crisis, there has been extensive talk and debate regarding the reintroduction of third-level fees.

====Sweden====
{{Further|Education in Sweden}}
In [[Sweden]], a system of school vouchers (called ''skolpeng'') were introduced in 1992 at primary and secondary school level, enabling free choice among publicly run schools and privately run ''friskolor'' ("free schools"). The voucher is paid with public funds from the local [[Municipalities of Sweden|municipality]] (''kommun'') directly to a school based solely on its number of students. Both public schools and free schools are funded the same way. Free schools can be run by not-for-profit groups as well as by for-profit companies, but may not charge top-up fees or select students other than on a first-come, first-served basis.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Choice Revolution: Privatization of Swedish Welfare Services in the 1990s |first=Paula|last=Blomqvist |journal=Social Policy & Administration |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=139–155 |date=April 2004 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9515.2004.00382.x}}</ref> Over 10% of Swedish pupils were enrolled in free schools in 2008 and the number is growing fast, leading the country to be viewed as a pioneer of the model.<ref name="swedishmodeleconomist">{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11535645|title=Making money from schools: The Swedish model|publisher=The Economist | date=June 12, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=The Spectator|year=2008|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/526631/made-in-sweden-the-new-tory-education-revolution.thtml|title=Made in Sweden: the new Tory education revolution}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/3717744.stm|title=Swedish parents enjoy school choice | location=London | date=October 5, 2004 | accessdate=May 23, 2010 | first=Mike | last=Baker}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Washington Times|year=2008|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/aug/11/embracing-private-schools/|title=Embracing private schools: Sweden lets companies use taxes for cost-efficient alternatives}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|year=2008|publisher=The Telegraph|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1435386/How-choice-has-transformed-education-in-Sweden.html|title=How choice has transformed education in Sweden | location=London | first=Johnny | last=Munkhammar | date=May 25, 2007 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref>

[[Per Unckel]], governor of Stockholm and former Minister of Education, has promoted the system, saying "Education is so important that you can’t just leave it to one producer, because we know from monopoly systems that they do not fulfill all wishes."

===Hong Kong===
A voucher system for children three to six years-old who attend a non-profit [[kindergarten]] was implemented in [[Hong Kong]] in 2007. Each child will get HK$13,000 pa. The $13,000 subsidy will be separated into two parts. $10,000 is used to subsidize the school fee and the remaining $3,000 is used for kindergarten teachers to pursue further education and obtain a certificate in Education. Also, there are some restrictions on the voucher system. Parents can only choose those non-profit making with yearly fee less than $24,000. The government hopes that all kindergarten teachers can obtain an Education certificate by the year 2011-2012, at which point the subsidies are to be adjusted to $16000 for each student, all of which will go toward the school fee.

[[Milton Friedman]] criticised the system, saying "I do not believe that [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|CE]] Mr. Tsang's proposal is properly structured." He said that the whole point of a voucher system is to provide a competitive market place so should not be limited to non-profit kindergartens. <!--source: ming pao news
2006 11 13-->

After protests by parents with children enrolled in for profit kindergartens, the program was extended to children in for- profit kindergartens, but only for children enrolled in or before September 2007. The government will also provide up to HK$30,000 subsidy to for profit kindergartens wanting to convert to non profit.

===Pakistan===
Dr. Allah Bakhsh Malik Managing Director and Chief Executive of Punjab Education Foundation - PEF introduced Education Voucher Scheme - EVS in Punjab especially in urban slums and poorest of the poor in 2005. The initial study was sponsored by Open Society Institute New York USA. Professor Henry M Levin extended Pro-Bono services for the children of poor families from Punjab.To ensure educational justice and avoid educational apartheid, the government must ensure that the poorest of the poor have equal access to quality education. Only then will future generations be able to escape from the vicious cycle of poverty and deprivation. In collaboration with the Teachers College, Columbia University, and the Open Society Institute, the PEF designed the Education Voucher Scheme (EVS) for the slums (or katchi abadies) in the province of Punjab. The EVS aims to promote freedom of choice, efficiency, equity, and social cohesion. A pilot project was started in 2006 in the urban slums of Sukhnehar, Lahore, where a survey showed that all households were living below the poverty line. Through the EVS, the foundation would deliver education vouchers to every household with children 5–13 years of age. The vouchers would be redeemable against tuition payments at participating private schools. In the pilot stage, 1,053 households were given an opportunity to send their children to a private school of their choice. The EVS makes its partner schools accountable to the parents rather than to the bureaucrats at the Ministry of Education. In the FAS program, every school principal has the choice of admitting a
student or not. In the EVS, however, the decision regarding where a child attends school is up to the parents because they are the ones carrying the education voucher issued by the PEF. The partner schools are also accountable to the PEF: they are subject to periodic reviews of their student learning outcomes, additional private investments, and improvements in working
conditions of the teachers. The EVS provides an incentive to parents to send their children to school, and so it has become a source of competition among private schools seeking to join the program. When it comes to the selection of schools, the following criteria are applied across the board: (i) The fee paid by the PEF to EVS partner schools is PKR 300 per child per month. Schools
charging higher fees can also apply to the program, but they will not be paid more than PKR 450, and they will not be entitled to charge the difference from students’ families. (ii) Total school enrollment should be between 100 and 500 children.  (iii) The school should have an adequate infrastructure and a good learning environment. (iv) EVS partner schools should be located within a half-kilometer radius of the residences of voucher holders. However, if the parents prefer a particular school that is farther away, the PEF will have no objection, provided that the school fulfills the EVS selection criteria.
(v) The PEF advertises to stimulate the interest of potential partner schools. It then gives students at short-listed schools preliminary tests in selected subjects, and conducts physical inspections of these schools. PEF offices display a list of all the EVS partner
schools so that parents may consult it and choose a school for their children.

By now more than 140, 000 students are benefiting from EVS and the program is being scaled up by financing from Government of the Punjab.

===United States===
In the 1980s, the Reagan administration pushed for vouchers, as did the George W. Bush administration in the initial education-reform proposals leading up to the [[No Child Left Behind Act]]. In 2011, it was estimated that nearly 171,000 students would participate in 18 existing school choice programs in 10 states (Vermont, Maine, New Mexico and 7 others) and the District of Columbia. Most of these programs were offered to students in low-income families, low performing schools, or special-education programs. By 2014, the number participating in either vouchers or tax-credit scholarships increased to 250,000, a 30% increase from 2010, but still a small fraction compared to the 55 million in traditional schools.<ref name=politico>{{cite news|last1=Stephanie|first1=Simon|title=Special report: Taxpayers fund creationism in the classroom|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/education-creationism-104934.html|accessdate=24 February 2015|date=2014-03-24}}</ref>

In 1990, the city of [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]'s [[Milwaukee Public Schools|public schools]] were the first to offer vouchers and has nearly 15,000 students using vouchers as of 2011. The 2006-2007 school year marked the first time in Milwaukee that more than $100 million was paid in vouchers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=533306|title=Vouchers to Pass $100 Million Mark, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, November 21, 2006|accessdate=November 21, 2006}}</ref> Twenty-six percent of Milwaukee students will receive public funding to attend schools outside the traditional Milwaukee Public School system. In fact, if the voucher program alone were considered a school district, it would mark the sixth-largest district in Wisconsin.  [[St. Anthony High School (Milwaukee)|St. Anthony Catholic School]], located on Milwaukee's south side, boasts 966 voucher students, meaning that it very likely receives more public money for general school support of a parochial elementary or high school than any before it in American history. Under the current state formula for paying school vouchers, however, Milwaukee residents pay more in property taxes for voucher students than for students attending public schools. This imbalance has received considerable criticism, and is the subject of 2007 legislative proposals designed to alter the formula.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} A study of Milwaukee students' state test scores during the 2006-2007 school year found that on average students using vouchers did not have higher scores than public school students.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.edweek.org/ew/issues/vouchers/|title = Vouchers|last = |first = |date = August 11, 2011|work = Education Week|access-date = July 17, 2015|via = }}</ref>

Recent analysis of the competitive effects of school vouchers in Florida suggests that more competition improves performance in the regular public schools.<ref>David Figlio & Cassandra M. D. Hart, 2014. "Competitive Effects of Means-Tested School Vouchers," American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, American Economic Association, vol. 6(1), pages 133-56, January</ref>

====Legal challenges====
The school voucher question in the United States has also received a considerable amount of judicial review in the early 2000s.

A program launched in the city of [[Cleveland]] in 1995 and authorized by the state of [[Ohio]] was challenged in court on the grounds that it violated both the federal constitutional principle of separation of church and state and the guarantee of religious liberty in the [[Ohio Constitution]]. These claims were rejected by the [[Ohio Supreme Court]], but the federal claims were upheld by [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio|the local federal district court]] and by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth Circuit appeals court]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edreform.com/school_choice/supreme_court_ruling.htm|title=Legal Summary of U.S. Supreme Court decision in Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 436 U.S.|accessdate=April 21, 2006}}</ref> The fact that nearly all of the families using vouchers attended Catholic schools in the Cleveland area was cited in the decisions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/LAW/06/27/scotus.school.vouchers/|accessdate=April 21, 2006|title=Supreme Court affirms school voucher program|first=Terry|last=Friden|date=July 27, 2002 | work=CNN}}</ref>

This was later reversed during 2002 in a landmark case before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]], [[Zelman v. Simmons-Harris]], in which the divided court, in a 5-4 decision, ruled the Ohio school voucher plan constitutional and removed any constitutional barriers to similar voucher plans in the future, with conservative justices [[Anthony Kennedy]], [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], [[William Rehnquist]], [[Antonin Scalia]], and [[Clarence Thomas]] in the majority.

[[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[William Rehnquist]], writing for the majority, stated that "The incidental advancement of a religious mission, or the perceived endorsement of a religious message, is reasonably attributable to the individual aid recipients not the government, whose role ends with the disbursement of benefits." The Supreme Court ruled that the Ohio program did not violate the [[Establishment Clause]], because it passed a five-part test developed by the Court in this case, titled the Private Choice Test.

Dissenting opinions included Justice Stevens's, who wrote "...the voluntary character of the private choice to prefer a parochial education over an education in the public school system seems to me quite irrelevant to the question whether the government's choice to pay for religious indoctrination is constitutionally permissible." and Justice Souter's, whose opinion questioned how the Court could keep ''[[Everson v. Board of Education]]'' on as precedent and decide this case in the way they did, feeling it was contradictory. He also found that religious instruction and secular education could not be separated and this itself violated the Establishment Clause.

In 2006, the Florida Supreme Court struck down legislation known as the [[Florida Opportunity Scholarship Program]] (OSP), which would have implemented a system of school vouchers in Florida.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5159138|accessdate=April 21, 2006|title=Court Throws Out Florida School Voucher Program}}</ref> The court ruled that the OSP violated article IX, section 1(a) of the Florida Constitution: "Adequate provision shall be made by law for a uniform, efficient, safe, secure, and high quality system of free public schools."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2006/sc04-2323.pdf|accessdate=November 1, 2006|title=Florida Supreme Court Official Opinion: SC04-2323 – John Ellis "Jeb" Bush, Etc., Et Al. v.

====Political support====
Political support for school vouchers in the United States is mixed. On the left/right spectrum, conservatives are more likely to support vouchers. Some state legislatures have enacted voucher laws.  In [[New Mexico]], Libertarian [[Gary Johnson]] made school voucher provision the major issue of his second term as [[Governor of New Mexico|Governor]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heartland.org/schoolreform-news.org/Article/10881/Better_Education_Does_Make_All_the_Difference_Governor_Gary_E_Johnson.html |title=Better Education Does Make All the Difference: Governor Gary E.

Opportunity Scholarship Program]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonscholarshipfund.org/index.html |title=Washington Scholarship Fund |publisher=Washington Scholarship Fund |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref>  until in early March 2009 congressional Democrats were moving to close down the program  and remove children from their voucher-funded school places at the end of the 09/10 school year under the $410 billion [[Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009]]<ref>Under Title IV of H.R.1015</ref> which, as of March 7 had passed the House and was pending in the Senate. The Obama administration stated<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2009-03-04-duncan-vouchers_N.htm |title=Secretary Duncan wants D.C. kids to keep vouchers |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=March 4, 2009 |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref> that it preferred to allow children already enrolled in the program to finish their schooling while closing the program to new entrants.  However, its preference on this matter does not appear to be strong enough to prevent the President from signing the Bill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Briefing-by-White-House-Press-Secretary-Robert-Gibbs-3/2/09/ |title=Briefing by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, 3/2/09 &#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date=March 2, 2009 |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref>

Whether or not the public generally supports vouchers is debatable. Majorities seem to favor improving existing schools over providing vouchers, yet as many as 40% of those surveyed admit that they do not know enough to form an opinion or do not understand the system of school vouchers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publicagenda.org/citizen/issueguides/education/publicview/redflags|title=Public Agenda Online, "Red Flags on Education: Lack of Knowledge About Vouchers."|accessdate=July 25, 2008}}</ref>

In November 2000, a voucher system proposed by [[Tim Draper]] was placed on the [[California]] ballot as Proposition 38. It was unusual among school voucher proposals in that it required neither [[accreditation]] on the part of schools accepting vouchers, nor proof of need on the part of families applying for them; neither did it have any requirement that schools accept vouchers as payment-in-full, nor any other provision to guarantee a reduction in the real cost of private school tuition. The measure was defeated by a final percentage tally of 70.6 to 29.4.

A statewide universal school voucher system providing a maximum tuition subsidy of $3000 was passed in Utah in 2007, but 62% of voters repealed it in a statewide referendum before it took effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,695225580,00.html|title=Vouchers Killed|accessdate=November 3, 2007}}</ref> On April 27, 2011 [[Indiana]] passed a statewide voucher program, the largest in the U.S. It offers up to $4,500 to students with househould incomes under $41,000, and lesser benefits to households with higher incomes. The vouchers can be used to fund a variety of education options outside the public school system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wishtv.com/dpp/news/politics/state_politics/keys-to-govs-education-reform-pass|title=Gov's Education Reform Passes|publisher=WISHTV News|date=April 27, 2011|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}</ref> In March 2013, the [[Indiana Supreme Court]] found that the program does not violate the state constitution.<ref>{{cite news | title =Indiana court upholds broadest school voucher program | publisher =Associated Press | date =March 26, 2013 | url =http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/26/indiana-court-upholds-broadest-school-voucher-program/ | accessdate =March 26, 2013 }}</ref>

====Teaching creationism instead of evolution====
Some schools in voucher programs teach [[creationism]] instead of the [[Evolution|theory of evolution]], including religious schools that teach religious theology side-by-side with or in place of science.<ref name=politico/>  Over 300 schools in the USA have been documented as teaching creation and receive taxpayer money. Contrary to public belief, this was deemed constitutional in Zelman v. Simmons-Harris.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/01/16/creationism-spreading-in-schools-thanks-to-vouchers/ |title=Creationism spreading in schools, thanks to vouchers|first=Zack|last=Kopplin|date=January 16, 2013 | work=MSNBC}}</ref>
