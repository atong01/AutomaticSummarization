It may still be desirable that government directly provide schools in a few isolated communities where the number of children is too small (and the average cost of education therefore too high) for privately run schools. But with respect to the great majority of the population, it would undoubtedly be possible to leave the organization and management of education entirely to private efforts, with the government providing merely the basic finance and ensuring a minimum standard for all schools where the vouchers could be spent.

The problem is bureaucracy. I'm one of these people who believes the best thing we could ever do is go to the full voucher system.

I have a 17-year-old daughter who went to a private school for a few years before high school. This private school is the best school I've seen in my life. It was judged one of the 100 best schools in America. It was phenomenal. The tuition was $5,500 a year, which is a lot of money for most parents. But the teachers were paid less than public school teachers - so it's not about money at the teacher level. I asked the state treasurer that year what California pays on average to send kids to school, and I believe it was $4,400. While there are not many parents who could come up with $5,500 a year, there are many who could come up with $1,000 a year.

If we gave vouchers to parents for $4,400 a year, schools would be starting right and left. People would get out of college and say, "Let's start a school."

The major unlucky families then have to compete again to look for some other less preferred and competitive schools or give up searching and go back to their assigned local schools.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="last">Pons</arg><arg name="first">Michael</arg><arg name="title">School Vouchers: The Emerging Track Record</arg><arg name="url">http://www.nea.org/home/16970.htm</arg><arg name="publisher">National Education Association</arg><arg name="accessdate">November 20, 2012</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>It is interesting to note that efforts to make vouchers available aren't always noticed by those able to use them. In April 2012, a bill passed in Louisiana that made vouchers available to low-income families whose children attended poorly ranked schools. Under the new law, any student whose household income was sufficiently low (up to about $44,000 for a family of three) that attended a school ranked &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, or &quot;F&quot; could apply for vouchers to attend another school.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.louisianaweekly.com/voucher-bills-pass/'>See Tidmore, C.

In many states, members of a community's board of education are elected by voters. Similarly, a school budget faces a referendum. Meetings of the Board of Education must be announced in advance, and members of the public are permitted to voice their concerns directly to board members. Although vouchers may be used in private and religious schools, taxpayers are not able to vote on budgetary issues, elect members of the board or even attend board meetings.<space/><link><target>Kevin G. Welner</target><part>Kevin Welner</part></link><space/>points out that vouchers funded through a convoluted tax credit systema policy he calls &quot;Neovouchers&quot;present additional accountability concerns. With neovoucher systems, a taxpayer owing money to the state instead donates that money to a private, nonprofit organization. That organization then bundles donations and gives them to parents as vouchers to be used for private school tuition. The state then steps in and forgives (through a tax credit) some or all of the taxes that the donor has given to the organization. While conventional tax credit systems are structured to treat all private school participants equally, neovoucher systems effectively delegate to individual private taxpayers (those owing money to the state) the power to decide which private schools will benefit.<extension extension_name='ref'>See Welner, Kevin G.

The initial study was sponsored by Open Society Institute New York USA. Professor Henry M Levin extended Pro-Bono services for the children of poor families from Punjab.To ensure educational justice and avoid educational apartheid, the government must ensure that the poorest of the poor have equal access to quality education. Only then will future generations be able to escape from the vicious cycle of poverty and deprivation. In collaboration with the Teachers College, Columbia University, and the Open Society Institute, the PEF designed the Education Voucher Scheme (EVS) for the slums (or katchi abadies) in the province of Punjab. The EVS aims to promote freedom of choice, efficiency, equity, and social cohesion. A pilot project was started in 2006 in the urban slums of Sukhnehar, Lahore, where a survey showed that all households were living below the poverty line. Through the EVS, the foundation would deliver education vouchers to every household with children 513 years of age. The vouchers would be redeemable against tuition payments at participating private schools. In the pilot stage, 1,053 households were given an opportunity to send their children to a private school of their choice. The EVS makes its partner schools accountable to the parents rather than to the bureaucrats at the Ministry of Education. In the FAS program, every school principal has the choice of admitting astudent or not. In the EVS, however, the decision regarding where a child attends school is up to the parents because they are the ones carrying the education voucher issued by the PEF. The partner schools are also accountable to the PEF: they are subject to periodic reviews of their student learning outcomes, additional private investments, and improvements in workingconditions of the teachers. The EVS provides an incentive to parents to send their children to school, and so it has become a source of competition among private schools seeking to join the program. When it comes to the selection of schools, the following criteria are applied across the board: (i) The fee paid by the PEF to EVS partner schools is PKR 300 per child per month. Schoolscharging higher fees can also apply to the program, but they will not be paid more than PKR 450, and they will not be entitled to charge the difference from students families. (ii) Total school enrollment should be between 100 and 500 children. (iii) The school should have an adequate infrastructure and a good learning environment. (iv) EVS partner schools should be located within a half-kilometer radius of the residences of voucher holders. However, if the parents prefer a particular school that is farther away, the PEF will have no objection, provided that the school fulfills the EVS selection criteria.(v) The PEF advertises to stimulate the interest of potential partner schools. It then gives students at short-listed schools preliminary tests in selected subjects, and conducts physical inspections of these schools. PEF offices display a list of all the EVS partnerschools so that parents may consult it and choose a school for their children.</paragraph><paragraph>By now more than 140, 000 students are benefiting from EVS and the program is being scaled up by financing from Government of the Punjab.</paragraph><heading level='3'>United States</heading><paragraph>In the 1980s, the Reagan administration pushed for vouchers, as did the George W.
