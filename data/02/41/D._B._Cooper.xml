It had &quot;single-point fueling&quot; capability, a recent innovation that allowed all tanks to be refueled rapidly through a single fuel port. It also had the ability (unusual for a commercial jet airliner) to remain in slow, low-altitude flight without stalling; and Cooper knew how to control its air speed and altitude without entering the cockpit, where he could have been overpowered by the three pilots.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Gunther</arg><arg>1985</arg><arg name="p">46</arg></template><space/>In addition, Cooper was familiar with important details, such as the appropriate flap setting of 15 degrees (which was unique to that aircraft), and the typical refueling time.

The very best time for this is in front of a four-day weekend, which is the timing Dan Cooper chose for his crime.&quot; Furthermore, &quot;if he was planning ahead, he knew he had to hitchhike out of the woods, and it is much easier to get picked up in a suit and tie than in old blue jeans.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="conclusions"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Despite his careful planning and attention to detail, the Bureau feels strongly that Cooper lacked crucial skydiving skills and experience. &quot;We originally thought Cooper was an experienced jumper, perhaps even a paratrooper,&quot; said Special Agent Larry Carr, leader of the investigative team since 2006. &quot;We concluded after a few years this was simply not true.
