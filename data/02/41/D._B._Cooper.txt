'''D. B. Cooper''' is a media [[epithet]] popularly used to refer to an unidentified man who [[aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] a [[Boeing 727]] aircraft in the airspace between [[Portland, Oregon]], and [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], on November 24, 1971, extorted [[United States dollar|$]]200,000 in ransom ({{Inflation|US|200000|1971|r=-4|fmt=eq}}), and parachuted to an uncertain fate. Despite an extensive manhunt and an ongoing [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] investigation, the perpetrator has never been located or positively identified. The case remains the only unsolved air piracy in American aviation history.<ref name="Gray-NYmag2007-10-21" />{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=135}}<ref name="Pasternak-USNWR2000-07-24" />

The suspect purchased his airline ticket using the alias '''Dan Cooper''', but because of a news media miscommunication he became known in popular lore as "D. B. Cooper". Hundreds of leads have been pursued in the ensuing years, but no conclusive evidence has ever surfaced regarding Cooper's true identity or whereabouts. Numerous theories of widely varying plausibility have been proposed by experts, reporters, and amateur enthusiasts.<ref name="Gray-NYmag2007-10-21" /><ref name="AP2008-01-02" /> The discovery of a small cache of ransom bills in 1980 triggered renewed interest but ultimately only deepened the mystery, and the great majority of the ransom remains unrecovered.

While FBI investigators have stated from the beginning that Cooper probably did not survive his risky jump,<ref name="FBI-Redux" /> the agency maintains an active case file—which has grown to more than 60 volumes<ref name="Seven1996-11-17" />—and continues to solicit creative ideas and new leads from the public. "Maybe a hydrologist can use the latest technology to trace the $5,800 in ransom money found in 1980 to where Cooper landed upstream," suggested Special Agent Larry Carr, leader of the investigation team since 2006. "Or maybe someone just remembers that odd uncle."<ref name="FBI-Redux" />

==Hijacking==
The incident began mid-afternoon on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] eve, November 24, 1971, at [[Portland International Airport]] in Portland, Oregon. A man carrying a black attaché case approached the flight counter of [[Northwest Orient Airlines]]. He identified himself as "Dan Cooper" and purchased a one-way ticket on Flight&nbsp;305, a 30-minute trip to Seattle, Washington.<ref name="Olson1999" />

Cooper boarded the aircraft, a Boeing 727-100 ([[FAA]] registration N467US), and took seat 18C<ref name="Gray-NYmag2007-10-21" /> (18E by one account,<ref>History's Greatest Unsolved Crimes.

He lit a cigarette and ordered a bourbon and soda.  Eyewitnesses on board recalled a man in his mid-forties, between {{convert|5|ft|10|in}} and {{convert|6|ft|0|in}} tall.  He wore a black lightweight raincoat, [[Slip-on shoe|loafers]], a dark suit, a neatly pressed white collared shirt, a black necktie, and a [[nacre|mother of pearl]] tie pin.<ref name="SFChronicle">{{cite news| title = D.B.

Flight&nbsp;305, approximately one-third full, took off on schedule at 2:50&nbsp;pm, local time ([[Pacific Standard Time|PST]]). Cooper passed a note to Florence Schaffner, the [[flight attendant]] situated nearest to him in a [[jump seat#Aviation|jump seat]] attached to the [[aft]] stair door.<ref name="Gray-NYmag2007-10-21" /> Schaffner, assuming the note contained a lonely businessman's phone number, dropped it unopened into her purse.<ref>{{cite book | title = Myths and Mysteries of Washington | last = Bragg | first = Lynn E. | year = 2005 | publisher = Globe Pequot |location=[[Guilford, Connecticut|Guilford]], [[Connecticut]] | page = 2 | isbn = 0-7627-3427-2}}</ref> Cooper leaned toward her and whispered, "Miss, you'd better look at that note.

The pilot, William Scott, contacted [[Seattle-Tacoma International Airport|Seattle-Tacoma Airport]] [[air traffic control]], which in turn informed local and federal authorities. The 36 other passengers were informed that their arrival in Seattle would be delayed because of a "minor mechanical difficulty".{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=20}} Northwest Orient's president, [[Donald Nyrop]], authorized payment of the ransom and ordered all employees to cooperate fully with the hijacker.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=19}} The aircraft circled [[Puget Sound]] for approximately two hours to allow [[Seattle Police Department|Seattle police]] and the FBI time to assemble Cooper's parachutes and ransom money, and to mobilize emergency personnel.<ref name="Gray-NYmag2007-10-21" />

Schaffner recalled that Cooper appeared familiar with the local [[terrain]]; at one point he remarked, "Looks like Tacoma down there," as the aircraft flew above it. He also mentioned, correctly, that [[McChord Air Force Base]] was only a 20-minute drive from Seattle-Tacoma Airport.<ref name="CrimeLibrary4" /><ref group="note" name="traveltimenote">Because of a {{convert|70|mph|abbr=on}} speed limit on Interstate 5 and a lack of traffic congestion, this was a reasonable travel time in 1971</ref> Schaffner described him as calm, polite, and well-spoken, not at all consistent with the stereotypes (enraged, hardened criminals or [[List of Cuba–United States aircraft hijackings|"take-me-to-Cuba"]] political dissidents) popularly associated with air piracy at the time. Tina Mucklow, another flight attendant, agreed. "He wasn't nervous," she told investigators. "He seemed rather nice. He was never cruel or nasty. He was thoughtful and calm all the time."<ref name="CrimeLibrary4" /> He ordered a second bourbon and water, paid his drink tab (and insisted Schaffner keep the change),<ref name="Gray-NYmag2007-10-21" /> and offered to request meals for the flight crew during the stop in Seattle.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=22}}

FBI agents assembled the ransom money from several Seattle-area banks—10,000 unmarked 20-dollar bills, many with serial numbers beginning with the letter "L" indicating issuance by the [[Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco]], most carrying a "Series 1969-C" designation<ref name="CrimeLibrary4">{{cite web| title = The D.B.

Seattle police obtained them from a local [[Parachuting|skydiving]] school.<ref name="CrimeLibrary4" />

===Passengers released===
At 5:24&nbsp;pm Cooper was informed that his demands had been met, and at 5:39&nbsp;pm the aircraft landed at Seattle-Tacoma Airport.<ref name="CrimeLibrary5">{{cite web| title = The D.B. Cooper Story: 'Everything Is Ready' | last=Krajicek | first = David | url = http://www.crimelibrary.com/criminal_mind/scams/DB_Cooper/5.html | work = [[Crime Library]] | accessdate = January 3, 2008 }}</ref> Cooper instructed Scott to taxi the jet to an isolated, brightly lit section of the [[tarmac]] and extinguish lights in the cabin to deter police snipers. Northwest Orient's Seattle operations manager, Al Lee, approached the aircraft in street clothes (to avoid the possibility that Cooper might mistake his airline uniform for that of a police officer) and delivered the cash-filled knapsack and parachutes to Mucklow via the aft stairs.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=28}} Once the delivery was completed Cooper permitted all passengers, Schaffner, and senior flight attendant Alice Hancock to leave the plane.<ref name="CrimeLibrary5" />

During refueling Cooper outlined his flight plan to the cockpit crew: a southeast course toward Mexico City at the minimum airspeed possible without stalling the aircraft{{mdash}}approximately {{convert|100|kn}}{{mdash}}at a maximum {{convert|10000|foot}} altitude. He further specified that the [[landing gear]] remain deployed in the takeoff/landing position, the [[Flaps (aircraft)|wing flaps]] be lowered 15&nbsp;degrees, and the cabin remain [[cabin pressurization|unpressurized]].<ref>Rothenberg and Ulvaeus, p. 5.</ref> Copilot William Rataczak informed Cooper that the aircraft's range was limited to approximately {{convert|1000|mi}} under the specified flight configuration, which meant that a second refueling would be necessary before entering Mexico. Cooper and the crew discussed options and agreed on [[Reno, Nevada]], as the refueling stop.<ref name="CrimeLibrary5" /> Finally, Cooper directed that the plane take off with the rear exit door open and its staircase extended. Northwest's home office objected, on grounds that it was unsafe to take off with the aft staircase deployed. Cooper countered that it was indeed safe, but he would not argue the point; he would lower it himself once they were airborne.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|pp=33–34}}

An FAA official requested a face-to-face meeting with Cooper aboard the aircraft, which was denied.<ref>{{cite book| last1 = Rothenberg| first1 = David |last2=Ulvaeus |first2=Marta | title = The New Earth Reader: The Best of Terra Nova | publisher = [[MIT Press]] | year= 1999 | location = [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]] | page = 4 | isbn =  0-262-18195-9 }}</ref> The refueling process was delayed because of a [[vapor lock]] in the fuel tanker truck's pumping mechanism,{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=32}} and Cooper became suspicious;<ref name="Gray-NYmag2007-10-21" /> but he allowed a replacement tanker truck to continue the refueling—and a third after the second ran dry.<ref name="CrimeLibrary5" />

===Back in the air===
[[File:Rwr727tail.jpg|thumb|right|[[Boeing 727]] with the aft airstair open]]
At approximately 7:40&nbsp;pm the 727 took off with only Cooper, pilot Scott, flight attendant Mucklow, copilot Rataczak, and flight engineer H. E. Anderson aboard. Two [[F-106]] fighter aircraft scrambled from nearby McChord Air Force Base followed behind the airliner, one above it and one below, out of Cooper's view.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=36}} A [[Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star|Lockheed T-33]] trainer, diverted from an unrelated [[Air National Guard]] mission, also shadowed the 727 until it ran low on fuel and turned back near the Oregon–California border.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=53}}

After takeoff Cooper told Mucklow to join the rest of the crew in the cockpit and remain there with the door closed. As she complied, Mucklow observed Cooper tying something around his waist.<ref name="CrimeLibrary6">{{cite web| title = The D.B. Cooper Story: The Jump | last=Krajicek | first = David | date = | url = http://www.crimelibrary.com/criminal_mind/scams/DB_Cooper/6.html | work = [[Crime Library]] | accessdate = January 9, 2008 }}</ref> At approximately 8:00&nbsp;pm a warning light flashed in the cockpit, indicating that the aft [[airstair]] apparatus had been activated. The crew's offer of assistance via the aircraft's intercom system was curtly refused.<ref name="CrimeLibrary6" /> The crew soon noticed a subjective change of air pressure, indicating that the aft door was open.

At approximately 8:13&nbsp;pm the aircraft's tail section sustained a sudden upward movement, significant enough to require trimming to bring the plane back to level flight.<ref name="Braggp4">Bragg, p. 4.</ref> At approximately 10:15&nbsp;pm Scott and Rataczak landed the 727, with the aft airstair still deployed, at Reno Airport.

==Investigation==
Aboard the airliner FBI agents recovered 66 unidentified latent fingerprints,<ref name="Pasternak-USNWR2000-07-24" /> Cooper's black clip-on tie and mother of pearl tie clip, and two of the four parachutes,<ref name="parachutes" /> one of which had been opened and two shroud lines cut from its canopy.<ref>{{cite news| title = F.B.I. reheats cold case | work = [[National Post]] | last = Cowan | first = James | date = January 3, 2008 | url = http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=211616 | accessdate = January 9, 2008 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080121231748/http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=211616 | archivedate = January 21, 2008}}</ref> Eyewitnesses in Portland, Seattle, and Reno, and all those who personally interacted with Cooper were interviewed.

Local police and FBI agents immediately began questioning possible suspects. One of the first was an Oregon man with a minor police record named D. B. Cooper, contacted by Portland police on the off-chance that the hijacker had used his real name, or the same alias in a previous crime. His involvement was quickly ruled out; but an inexperienced wire service reporter (Clyde Jabin of [[United Press International|UPI]] by most accounts,<ref>Guzman, Monica (November 27, 2007). Update: Everyone wants a piece of the D. B. Cooper legend.

The mistake was picked up and repeated by numerous other media sources, and the moniker "D. B. Cooper" became lodged in the public's collective memory.<ref name="Braggp4" />

A precise search area was difficult to define, as even small differences in estimates of the aircraft's speed, or the environmental conditions along the flight path (which varied significantly by location and altitude), changed Cooper's projected landing point considerably.<ref name="new" /> An important variable was the length of time he remained in free fall before pulling his rip cord—if indeed he succeeded in opening a parachute at all.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=68}} Neither of the Air Force fighter pilots saw anything exit the airliner, either visually or on radar, nor did they see a parachute open; but at night, with extremely limited visibility and cloud cover obscuring any ground lighting below, an airborne human figure clad entirely in black clothing could easily have gone undetected.<ref>{{cite news| title = D.B.

An experimental re-creation was conducted using the same aircraft hijacked by Cooper in the same flight configuration, piloted by Scott. FBI agents, pushing a {{convert|200|lb|adj=on}} sled out of the open airstair, were able to reproduce the upward motion of the tail section described by the flight crew at 8:13&nbsp;pm. Based on this experiment, it was concluded that 8:13&nbsp;pm was the most likely jump time.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|pp=80–81}} At that moment the aircraft was flying through a heavy rainstorm over the [[Lewis River (Washington)|Lewis River]] in southwestern Washington.<ref name="new" />

Initial extrapolations placed Cooper's landing area on the southernmost outreach of [[Mount St. Helens]], a few miles southeast of [[Ariel, Washington]], near [[Lake Merwin]], an artificial lake formed by a dam on the Lewis River.<ref>{{cite news| title = 30 years ago, D.B.

Door-to-door questioning and searches of local farmhouses were also carried out. Other search parties ran patrol boats along Lake Merwin and [[Yale Lake]], the reservoir immediately to its east.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|pp=67–68}} No trace of Cooper, nor any of the equipment presumed to have left the aircraft with him, was found.

The FBI also coordinated an aerial search, using fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters from the [[Oregon Army National Guard]], along the entire flight path (known as [[Victor airways|Victor 23]] in standard aviation terminology<ref>{{cite web | title = Aeronautical Information Manual  | publisher = Federal Aviation Administration | url = http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim/chap5/aim0503.html | accessdate = August 10, 2011 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721041334/http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim/Chap5/aim0503.html <!--Added by H3llBot--> | archivedate = July 21, 2011}}</ref> but "Vector 23" in most Cooper {{nobr|literature<ref name="Gray-NYmag2007-10-21" /><ref name="Pasternak-USNWR2000-07-24" />{{sfn|Nuttall|2010|pp=90–91}})}} from Seattle to Reno. While numerous broken treetops and several pieces of plastic and other objects that, from the air, resembled parachute canopies were sighted and investigated, nothing relevant to the hijacking was found.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=71}}

In early 1972, shortly after the spring thaw, teams of FBI agents aided by some 200 Army soldiers from [[Fort Lewis]], along with Air Force personnel, National Guard troops, and civilian volunteers, conducted another thorough ground search of Clark and Cowlitz Counties for eighteen days in March, and then an additional eighteen days in April.{{sfn|Olson|2010|p=34}} Electronic Explorations Company, a marine salvage firm, used a submarine to search the {{convert|200|ft|m|adj=on}} depths of Lake Merwin.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|pp=101–104}} Two local women stumbled upon a skeleton in an abandoned structure in Clark County; it was later identified as the remains of a female teenager who had been abducted and murdered several weeks before.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=86}} Ultimately, the search operation—arguably the most extensive, and intensive, in U.S. history—uncovered no significant material evidence related to the hijacking.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|pp=87–89}}

===Later developments===
Subsequent analyses called the original landing zone estimate into question: Scott, who was flying the aircraft manually because of Cooper's speed and altitude demands, later determined that his flight path was significantly farther east than initially assumed.<ref name="Seven1996-11-17" /> Additional data from a variety of sources—in particular [[Continental Airlines]] pilot Tom Bohan, who was flying four minutes behind Flight 305—indicated that the wind direction factored into drop zone calculations had been wrong, possibly by as much as 80 degrees.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|pp=111–113}} This and other supplemental data suggested that the actual drop zone was probably south-southeast of the original estimate, in the drainage area of the [[Washougal River]].{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|pp=114–116}}

"I have to confess," wrote retired FBI chief investigator Ralph Himmelsbach in his 1986 book, "if I [were] going to look for Cooper, I would head for the Washougal."{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=115}} The Washougal Valley and its surroundings have been searched by multiple private individuals and groups in subsequent years; to date, nothing directly traceable to the hijacking has been found.<ref name="Seven1996-11-17" />

===Search for ransom money===
In late 1971 the FBI distributed lists of the ransom serial numbers to financial institutions, casinos, race tracks, and other businesses routinely conducting significant cash transactions, and to law enforcement agencies around the world. Northwest Orient offered a reward of 15&nbsp;percent of the recovered money, to a maximum of $25,000. In early 1972 U.S. Attorney General [[John N. Mitchell|John Mitchell]] released the serial numbers to the general public.<ref name="timeline" /> In 1972 two men used counterfeit 20-dollar bills printed with Cooper serial numbers to swindle $30,000 from a ''[[Newsweek]]'' reporter named Karl Fleming in exchange for an interview with a man they falsely claimed was the hijacker.<ref>[http://www.howstuffworks.com/framed.htm?parent=american-history/db-cooper.htm&url=http://foia.fbi.gov/filelink.html?file=/cooper_d_b/cooper_d_b_part01.pdf FBI files on Fleming case, released via Freedom of Information Act] Retrieved February 15, 2011.</ref>

In early 1973, with the ransom money still missing, ''[[The Oregon Journal]]'' republished the serial numbers and offered $1,000 to the first person to turn in a ransom bill to the newspaper or any FBI field office. In Seattle, [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer|the ''Post-Intelligencer'']] made a similar offer with a $5,000 reward. The offers remained in effect until Thanksgiving 1974, and though there were several near-matches, no genuine bills were found.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=95}} In 1975 Northwest Orient's insurer, Global Indemnity Co., complied with an order from the Minnesota Supreme Court and paid the airline's $180,000 claim on the ransom money.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=184}}

===Statute of limitations===
In 1976 discussion arose over impending expiration of the [[statute of limitations]] on the hijacking.  Most published legal analysis agreed that it would make little difference,<ref>Frazier, Joe (November 13, 1976): "Sky Thief: Bandit Who Stole $200,000 in 1971 Still Being Sought"  Pittsburgh ''Post-Gazette'', p. B-1. Retrieved March 3, 2013</ref> as interpretation of the statute varies considerably from case to case and court to court, and a prosecutor could argue that Cooper had forfeited immunity on any of several valid technical grounds.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=179}}<ref>CRS Report for Congress: Statutes of Limitation in Federal Criminal Cases: An Overview.

===Physical evidence===
In 1978 a placard containing instructions for lowering the aft stairs of a 727 was found by a deer hunter near a logging road about {{convert|13|mi|km}} east of [[Castle Rock, Washington]], well north of Lake Merwin, but within the basic path of Flight 305.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=108}}

The discovery launched several new rounds of conjecture, and ultimately raised many more questions than it answered. Initial statements by investigators and scientific consultants were founded on the assumption that the bundled bills washed freely into the Columbia River from one of its many connecting tributaries. An [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] [[Hydrology|hydrologist]] noted that the bills had disintegrated in a "rounded" fashion, and were matted together, indicating that they had been deposited by river action, as opposed to having been deliberately buried.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=110}} If so, it confirmed that Cooper had not landed near Lake Merwin, nor in any other part of the Lewis River, which feeds into the Columbia well downstream from the discovery site; and it lent credence to supplemental speculation (see [[#Later developments|Later developments]] above) placing the drop zone near the Washougal River, which merges with the Columbia upstream from the discovery site.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|pp=110–111}}

But the "free floating" hypothesis presented its own difficulties; it did not explain the ten bills missing from one packet, nor was there a logical reason that the three packets would have remained together after separating from the rest of the money. Physical evidence was incompatible with geologic evidence: Himmelsbach observed that free-floating bundles would have had to wash up on the bank "within a couple of years" of the hijacking; otherwise the rubber bands would have long since deteriorated,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://foia2.fbi.gov/cooper_d_b/cooper_d_b_part07.pdf | title=FBI Freedom of Information Act documents, part 7, p. 15 | format=PDF | accessdate=April 23, 2011}}</ref> an observation confirmed experimentally by the Cooper Research Team (see [[#Ongoing investigation|Ongoing investigation]] below).<ref name = "conclusions">[http://www.citizensleuths.com/conclusions.html ''Research Conclusions'': Cooper Research Team web site].  Retrieved August 28, 2014.</ref>  Geologic evidence suggested, however, that the bills arrived at the area of their discovery—a beach front known as Tina (or Tena) Bar—well after 1974, the year of a Corps of Engineers [[dredging]] operation on that stretch of the river. Geologist Leonard Palmer of [[Portland State University]] found two distinct layers of sand and sediment between the clay deposited on the river bank by the dredge and the sand layer in which the bills were buried, indicating that the bills arrived long after dredging had been completed.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=110}}<ref>{{cite web | title = Cash linked to 'D.B.

That finding, if true, favors an arrival time of less than one year after the event (based on the rubber band experiment), but does not help to explain how the bundles got to Tina Bar, or from where they came.<ref>[http://www.citizensleuths.com/palmer-report.html ''Palmer Report'': Cooper Research Team web site]. Retrieved May 9, 2015.</ref>

Multiple alternative theories were advanced. Some surmised that the money had been found at a distant location by someone (or possibly even a wild animal), carried to the river bank, and reburied there. There was also the possibility that the money had been found on the riverbank earlier, perhaps before the dredging, and buried in a superficial sand layer at a later time.<ref>Nuttall, George C. (2010) ''D.B. Cooper Case Exposed''. Vantage Press. ISBN 0-533-16390-0</ref> The sheriff of Cowlitz County proposed that Cooper accidentally dropped a few of the bundles on the airstair, which then blew off the aircraft after he jumped and fell into the Columbia River. One local newspaper editor theorized that Cooper, knowing he could never spend the money, dumped it in the river or buried it there (and possibly elsewhere) himself.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=203}} No hypothesis offered to date satisfactorily explains all of the existing evidence.<ref name = "conclusions"/>

In late 2007 the FBI announced that a partial DNA profile had been obtained from three organic samples found on the hijacker's clip-on tie in 2001,<ref name="new">{{cite web | title =D.B.

===Ongoing investigation===
In March 2009 the FBI disclosed that Tom Kaye, a paleontologist from the [[Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture]] in Seattle, had assembled a team of "citizen sleuths" including scientific illustrator Carol Abraczinskas and metallurgist Alan Stone. The group, now known as the Cooper Research Team,<ref name="citizensleuths">[http://www.citizensleuths.com/ Cooper Research Team web site]</ref> is using technology unavailable in 1971 to reinvestigate important components of the case. Using [[GPS]] and satellite imagery, they are attempting to determine if the money found by Ingram floated freely to its discovery location over time, or was found elsewhere and reburied. They have reexamined the 727's flight path from Seattle to Reno to more precisely estimate Cooper's landing zone.<ref name="isodbc" /> Using [[electron microscopy]] they examined hundreds of particles on Cooper's tie, identifying ''[[Lycopodium]]'' spores (likely from a pharmaceutical product), and fragments of [[bismuth]] and [[aluminum]].<ref name="citizensleuths" />

In November 2011 Kaye announced that particles of pure (unalloyed) [[titanium]] had also been found on the tie. He explained that titanium, which was much rarer in the 1970s than it is today, was found at that time only in metal fabrication or production facilities, or at chemical companies using it (combined with aluminum) to store extremely corrosive substances.<ref>Ingalls C (November 23, 2011): "40 years later, new evidence unveiled in DB Cooper case".

==Theories and conjectures==
[[File:Dbc.jpg|thumb|FBI sketch of Cooper, with age progression]]
In the years since the hijacking the FBI has periodically made public some of its working hypotheses and tentative conclusions about the case, drawn from witness testimony and the scarce physical evidence.<ref name="NPR">{{cite news| title = F.B.I. Seeks Help in Solving Skyjacking Mystery | work = [[National Public Radio]] | last = Tedford |first = Deborah | date = January 2, 2008 | url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=17787290 | accessdate = March 11, 2008}}</ref>

The official physical description remains unchanged and is considered reliable. Flight attendants Schaffner and Mucklow, who spent the most time with Cooper, were interviewed on the same night in separate cities,<ref name="FBI-Redux" /> and gave nearly identical descriptions: {{convert|5|ft|10|in}} to {{convert|6|ft|0|in}} tall, {{convert|170|to|180|lb}}, mid-40s, with close-set piercing brown eyes. Passengers and other eyewitnesses gave very similar descriptions.<ref name="enigma" />

Agents believe that Cooper was familiar with the Seattle area and may have been an Air Force veteran, based on testimony that he recognized the city of Tacoma from the air as the jet circled Puget Sound, and his accurate comment to Mucklow that McChord Air Force Base was approximately 20&nbsp;minutes' driving time from the Seattle-Tacoma Airport<ref group="note" name="traveltimenote"/>—a detail most civilians would not know, or comment upon.<ref name="CrimeLibrary4" /> His financial situation was very likely desperate, as extortionists and other criminals who steal large amounts of money nearly always do so, according to experts, because they need it urgently; otherwise, the crime is not worth the considerable risk.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=96}} (A minority opinion is that Cooper was "a thrill seeker" who made the jump "just to prove it could be done."{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=115}})

Agents theorize that he took his alias from a popular [[Belgian comics|Belgian comic book]] series of the 1970s featuring the fictional hero [[Dan Cooper (comics)|Dan Cooper]], a [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] test pilot who took part in numerous heroic adventures, including parachuting. (One cover from the series, reproduced on the FBI web site, depicts test pilot Cooper skydiving in full paratrooper regalia.<ref name="isodbc" />) Because the Dan Cooper comics were never translated into English nor imported to the US, they speculate that he may have encountered them during a tour of duty in Europe.<ref name="isodbc">{{cite news | title = In Search of D.B.

The FBI task force believes that Cooper was a careful and shrewd planner. He demanded four parachutes to force the assumption that he might compel one or more hostages to jump with him, thus ensuring he would not be deliberately supplied with sabotaged equipment.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=44}}  He chose a 727-100 aircraft because it was ideal for a bail-out escape, due not only to its aft airstair, but also the high, aftward placement of all three engines, which allowed a reasonably safe jump without risk of immediate incineration by jet exhaust. It had "single-point fueling" capability, a recent innovation that allowed all tanks to be refueled rapidly through a single fuel port. It also had the ability (unusual for a commercial jet airliner) to remain in slow, low-altitude flight without stalling; and Cooper knew how to control its air speed and altitude without entering the cockpit, where he could have been overpowered by the three pilots.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=46}} In addition, Cooper was familiar with important details, such as the appropriate flap setting of 15 degrees (which was unique to that aircraft), and the typical refueling time. He knew that the aft airstair could be lowered during flight—a fact never disclosed to civilian flight crews, since there was no situation on a passenger flight that would make it necessary—and that its operation, by a single switch in the rear of the cabin, could not be overridden from the cockpit.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=136}} He may even have known that the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] had been using 727s to drop agents and supplies behind enemy lines during the [[Vietnam War]].{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=43}}

Cooper's meticulous planning may also have extended to the timing of his operation, and even his choice of attire, according to Kaye's research team.  "The FBI searched but couldn't find anyone who disappeared that weekend," Kaye wrote, suggesting that the perpetrator may have simply returned to his normal occupation.  "If you were planning on going 'back to work on Monday', then you would need as much time as possible to get out of the woods, find transportation and get home.  The very best time for this is in front of a four-day weekend, which is the timing Dan Cooper chose for his crime."  Furthermore, "if he was planning ahead, he knew he had to hitchhike out of the woods, and it is much easier to get picked up in a suit and tie than in old blue jeans."<ref name = "conclusions"/>

Despite his careful planning and attention to detail, the Bureau feels strongly that Cooper lacked crucial skydiving skills and experience. "We originally thought Cooper was an experienced jumper, perhaps even a paratrooper," said Special Agent Larry Carr, leader of the investigative team since 2006. "We concluded after a few years this was simply not true. No experienced parachutist would have jumped in the pitch-black night, in the rain, with a 200-mile-an-hour wind in his face, wearing loafers and a trench coat. It was simply too risky. He also missed that his reserve 'chute was only for training, and had been sewn shut—something a skilled skydiver would have checked."<ref name="isodbc" /> He also failed to bring or request a helmet,{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=15}} chose to jump with the older and technically inferior of the two primary parachutes supplied to him,<ref name="new" /> and jumped into a {{convert|-70|°F|°C}} wind chill.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper = USA Today|title=D.B.

Assuming that Cooper was not a paratrooper, but was an Air Force veteran, Carr believes that he could have been an aircraft cargo loader. Such an assignment would have given him knowledge and experience in the aviation industry; and loaders—because they throw cargo out of flying aircraft—wear emergency parachutes and receive rudimentary jump training.   Such training would have given Cooper a working knowledge of parachutes—but "not necessarily sufficient knowledge to survive the jump he made."<ref name=autogenerated1>In Search of D.B.

The Bureau has argued from the beginning that Cooper did not survive his jump.<ref name="isodbc" /> "Diving into the wilderness without a plan, without the right equipment, in such terrible conditions, he probably never even got his 'chute open," said Carr.<ref name="FBI-Redux" /> Even if he did land safely, agents contend, survival in the mountainous terrain would have been all but impossible without an [[accomplice]] at a predetermined landing point, which would have required a precisely timed jump—necessitating, in turn, cooperation from the flight crew. There is no evidence that Cooper had any such help from the crew, nor any clear idea where he was when he jumped into the stormy, overcast darkness.<ref name="enigma">"It's an Enigma."

Cooper was not the first to attempt air piracy for personal gain.

==Suspects==
Since 1971 the FBI has processed over a thousand "serious suspects" along with assorted publicity seekers and deathbed confessors, most of whom have been definitively ruled out.<ref name="Pasternak-USNWR2000-07-24" /> Some notable examples:

===Kenneth Christiansen===
In 2003 a Minnesota resident named Lyle Christiansen, after watching a television documentary about the Cooper hijacking, became convinced that his late brother Kenneth was D. B. Cooper.<ref name="Gray-NYmag2007-10-21" />  After repeated futile attempts to convince first the FBI, and then the author and film director [[Nora Ephron]] (whom he hoped would make a movie about the case), he contacted a private investigator in New York. In 2010 the detective, Skipp Porteous, published a book{{sfn|Porteous|Blevins|2010}} postulating that Christiansen was indeed the hijacker. In early 2011 an episode of the [[History (TV channel)|History]] series ''[[Brad Meltzer's Decoded]]'' also summarized the circumstantial evidence linking Christiansen to the Cooper case.<ref name=BradMeltzer>{{cite episode|series=[[Brad Meltzer's Decoded]]|title=D.B. Cooper|network= [[History (TV channel)|History]]|airdate=January 6, 2011|season=1|number=6}}</ref>

Christiansen enlisted in the Army in 1944 and was trained as a paratrooper. The war had ended by the time he was deployed in 1945, but he made occasional training jumps while stationed in Japan with occupation forces in the late 1940s. After leaving the Army he joined Northwest Orient in 1954 as a mechanic in the South Pacific, and subsequently became a flight attendant, and then a [[purser]], based in Seattle.<ref name="Gray-NYmag2007-10-21" /> Christiansen was 45 years old at the time of the hijacking, but he was shorter (5&nbsp;ft. 8 in.), thinner (150 pounds), and lighter complected than eyewitness descriptions.<ref name="Gray-NYmag2007-10-21" /> Christiansen smoked (as did the hijacker), and displayed a particular fondness for bourbon (Cooper's preferred beverage). He was also left-handed. (Evidence photos of Cooper's black tie show the tie clip applied from the left side, suggesting a left-handed wearer.<ref name="FBI-Redux" />) Flight attendant Florence Schaffner told a reporter that photos of Christiansen fit her memory of the hijacker's appearance more closely than those of other suspects she had been shown.<ref name="Gray-NYmag2007-10-21" /> (Tina Mucklow, who had the most contact with Cooper, has never granted a press interview).<ref>{{cite news|title=Tina Mucklow, D.B. Cooper-hijacking flight attendant found; Woman was go-between for Cooper, crew | author=McShane, Larry|date=September 2, 2011|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/tina-mucklow-b-cooper-hijacking-flight-attendant-found-woman-go-between-cooper-crew-article-1.953428 | location=New York | work=Daily News}}</ref>

Christiansen reportedly purchased a house with cash a few months after the hijacking.  While dying of cancer in 1994 he told Lyle, "There is something you should know, but I cannot tell you." Lyle said he never pressed his brother to explain.<ref name="Gray-NYmag2007-10-21" /> After Christiansen's death family members discovered gold coins and a valuable stamp collection, along with over $200,000 in bank accounts. They also found a folder of Northwest Orient news clippings which began about the time he was hired in the 1950s, and stopped just prior to the date of the hijacking, despite the fact that the hijacking was by far the most momentous news event in the airline's history. Christiansen continued to work part-time for the airline for many years after 1971, but apparently never clipped another Northwest news story.<ref name="Gray-NYmag2007-10-21" />

Despite the publicity generated by Porteous's book and the 2011 television documentary, the FBI is standing by its position that Christiansen cannot be considered a prime suspect.<ref name="new" /><ref name="CNN2011-08-01"/> They cite a poor match to eyewitness physical descriptions, a level of skydiving expertise above that predicted by their suspect profile, and an absence of direct incriminating evidence.<ref>{{cite news| title = F.B.I. rejects latest D.B.

===William Gossett===
William Pratt Gossett was a [[Marine Corps]], Army, and [[Army Air Force]] veteran who saw action in Korea and Vietnam. His military experience included advanced jump training and wilderness survival. After retiring from military service in 1973 he worked as an [[ROTC]] instructor, taught military law at [[Weber State University]] in [[Ogden, Utah]], and hosted a radio talk show in [[Salt Lake City]] which featured discussions about the [[paranormal]].<ref name="craig">Craig, John S. "D.B. Cooper Suspect Named: William Pratt Gossett," associatedcontent.com.</ref> He died in 2003.<ref name="yet" />

Gossett was widely known to be obsessed with the Cooper hijacking. He amassed a voluminous collection of Cooper-related news articles, and told one of his wives that he knew enough about the case to "write the epitaph for D.B. Cooper". Late in his life he reportedly told three of his sons, a retired Utah judge, and a friend in the Salt Lake City public defender's office that he had committed the hijacking.<ref name="yet">Yet Another D.

According to Galen Cook, a lawyer who has collected information related to Gossett for years, Gossett once showed his sons a key to a [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] safe deposit box which, he claimed, contained the long-missing ransom money.<ref name="The Canadian PressF.B.I.">{{cite news | title = U.S. lawyer believes notorious fugitive D.B.

Cooper' | work = Depoe Bay Beacon | date = May 28, 2008}}</ref>

In 1988 Gossett changed his name to "Wolfgang" and became a Catholic priest, which Cook and others interpreted as an effort to disguise his identity.<ref name="craig" /> Other circumstantial evidence includes testimony that Cook claims to have obtained from William Mitchell, a passenger on the hijacked aircraft, regarding a mysterious "physical detail" (which he will not divulge) common to the hijacker and Gossett.<ref>Craig, John S. "1971 D.B. Cooper Letters Linked to Suspect William Gossett," associatedcontent.com.</ref> Cook also claims to have found "possible links" to Gossett in each of four letters signed by "D.B. Cooper" and mailed to three newspapers within days after the hijacking, although there is no evidence that the actual hijacker created or mailed any of the letters.<ref>"Letter to Gazette Checked in FBI Hunt for Skyjacker," '' Reno Evening Gazette,'' November 29, 1971; "Words in 'Skyjacker Note' to Gazette Clipped from Modesto Bee, FBI Told," ''Reno Evening Gazette,'' November 30, 1971; "Gazette Receives Hijacker 'Letter' – Second in a Week," ''Reno Evening Gazette,'' December 3, 1971. For detailed analysis of letters see "1971 D.B. Cooper Letters Linked to Suspect William Gossett," associatedcontent.com.</ref>

"When I shot Richard McCoy," he said, "I shot D. B. Cooper at the same time."<ref name="CrimeLibrary9" />

===Duane Weber===
Duane L. Weber was a World War II Army veteran who served time in at least six prisons from 1945 to 1968 for burglary and forgery. He was proposed as a suspect by his widow, based primarily on a deathbed confession: Three days before he died in 1995, Weber told his wife, "I am Dan Cooper."  The name meant nothing to her, she said; but months later, a friend told her of its significance in the hijacking. She went to her local library to research D.B. Cooper, found [[Max Gunther]]'s book, and discovered notations in the margins in her husband's handwriting.<ref name="Pasternak-USNWR2000-07-24" />

She then recalled, in retrospect, that Weber once had a nightmare during which he talked in his sleep about jumping from a plane, leaving his fingerprints on the "aft stairs".<ref name="CrimeLibrary10">{{cite web| title = The D.B. Cooper Story: "I'm Dan Cooper.

Like the hijacker, Weber drank bourbon and chain smoked. Other circumstantial evidence included a 1979 trip to Seattle and the Columbia River, during which Weber took a walk alone along the river bank in the Tina Bar area; four months later Brian Ingram made his ransom cash discovery in the same area.<ref name="Pasternak-USNWR2000-07-24" />

The FBI eliminated Weber as an active suspect in July 1998 when his fingerprints did not match any of those processed in the hijacked plane,<ref name="CrimeLibrary10" /> and no other direct evidence could be found to implicate him.<ref name="Pasternak-USNWR2000-07-24" /> Later, his DNA also failed to match the samples recovered from Cooper's tie,<ref name="new" /><ref name="CNN2011-08-01"/> though the Bureau has since conceded that they cannot be certain that the organic material on the tie came from Cooper.<ref name="no match"/>

In 2006 two amateur researchers named Daniel Dvorak and Matthew Myers proposed him as a suspect once again, attracting coverage from a Portland television station<ref>{{YouTube | id=sw6bXxqaq0s | title = D.B.

Coffelt was a conman, ex-convict, and purported government informant who claimed to have been the chauffeur and confidante of [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s last undisputed descendant, great-grandson [[Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith]].

He said he landed near [[Mount Hood]], about {{convert|50|mi|km}} southeast of Ariel, injuring himself and losing the ransom money in the process. Photos of Coffelt bear a resemblance to the composite drawings, although he was in his mid-fifties in 1971. He was reportedly in Portland on the day of the hijacking, and sustained leg injuries around that time which were consistent with a skydiving mishap.<ref>{{cite web|title=Has The Mystery of D.B.

She also recalled that her uncle, who died in 1999, was obsessed with the Canadian comic book hero Dan Cooper (see [[D. B.

In August ''New York'' magazine published an alternative witness sketch, reportedly based on a description by Flight 305 eyewitness Robert Gregory, depicting horn-rimmed sunglasses, a "russet"-colored suit jacket with wide lapels, and [[marcelled]] hair.

==Aftermath==

===Airport security===
The Cooper hijacking marked the beginning of the end for unfettered and unscrutinized airline travel. Despite initiation of the federal [[Sky Marshal program]] the previous year,<ref name="Wu">Wu, Annie. The History of Airport Security. [http://savvytraveler.publicradio.org/show/features/2000/20000915/security.shtml SavvyTraveler.publicradio.org] Retrieved February 14, 2011.</ref> 31 hijackings were committed in U.S. airspace in 1972, 19 of them for the specific purpose of extorting money. (Most of the rest were attempts to reach Cuba.)<ref>Holden, Robert T. The Contagiousness of Aircraft Hijacking [http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~surette/hijacking.html UCF.edu Archive] Retrieved February 14, 2011.</ref> In 15 of the extortion cases the hijackers also demanded parachutes.<ref name="gladwell">Gladwell, Malcolm. ''The New Yorker'' (October 1, 2001): Safety in the Skies. [http://gladwell.com/safety-in-the-skies/ New Yorker Archive] Retrieved February 14, 2011.</ref> In early 1973 the FAA began requiring airlines to search all passengers and their bags. Amid multiple lawsuits charging that such searches violated [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] protections against search and seizure, federal courts ruled that they were acceptable when applied universally, and when limited to searches for weapons and explosives.<ref name="Wu" /> In contrast to the 31 hijackings in 1972, only two were attempted in 1973, both by psychiatric patients, [[Samuel Byck|one of whom]] intended to crash the airliner into the White House to kill President Nixon.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=120}}

===Aircraft modifications===
In the wake of multiple "copycat" hijackings in 1972 the FAA required that all Boeing&nbsp;727 aircraft be fitted with a device, later dubbed the "[[Cooper vane]]", which prevented lowering of the aft airstair during flight.<ref name="ST">{{cite news | title = D.B. Cooper puzzle: The legend turns 30 | last=Gilmore | first = Susan | date = November 22, 2001 | url = http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=cooper22m&date=20011122 | work = [[The Seattle Times]] | accessdate = January 2, 2008 }}</ref> Several airlines elected to abandon use of the airstair entirely, and welded the aft doors of their 727s shut.<ref name="Wu" />

A less-well-known modification mandated as a direct result of the hijacking was the installation of peepholes in all cockpit doors, making it possible for the cockpit crew to observe events in the passenger cabin with the cockpit door closed.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=50}}

===Subsequent history of N467US===
In 1978 the hijacked 727-100 aircraft was sold by Northwest to [[Piedmont Airlines (1948–1989)|Piedmont Airlines]] where it was reregistered N838N and continued in domestic carrier service.<ref>[http://www.jetpiedmont.com Piedmont Historical Archives] Retrieved May 29, 2013.</ref> In 1984 it was purchased by the now-defunct charter company Key Airlines, reregistered N29KA, and incorporated into the Air Force's civilian charter fleet that shuttled workers between [[Nellis Air Force Base]] and the [[Tonopah Test Range]] during the top-secret [[F-117 Nighthawk]] development program.<ref>Hengi, B.I. Airlines Remembered. Midland (June 10, 2000). ISBN 1-85780-091-5, pp. 56–7.</ref> In 1996 the aircraft was scrapped for parts in a Memphis boneyard.<ref name="timeline" />

===Earl Cossey===
In late April 2013 Earl Cossey, the owner of the skydiving school that furnished the four parachutes given to Cooper, was found dead in his home in [[Woodinville, Washington|Woodinville]], a suburb of Seattle. His death was ruled a homicide due to blunt-force trauma to the head.

{{Main|D. B. Cooper in popular culture}}
While D.B. Cooper was an air pirate and extortionist (Himmelsbach famously called him a "rotten sleazy crook"{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=116}}) who endangered the lives of 42 people and caused immeasurable inconvenience for many others, his bold, adventurous, unprecedented crime inspired a cult following, expressed through song, film and literature. Cities in the Pacific Northwest sold tourist souvenirs and held celebrations in his memory. He is remembered in [[Ariel, Washington]], with a "Cooper Day" event held annually on the weekend after Thanksgiving weekend, and elsewhere with Cooper-themed promotions held by restaurants and bowling alleys. Cooper has also been used in the storylines of such popular TV series as ''[[Prison Break]]'', ''[[White Collar (TV series)|White Collar]]'', ''[[NewsRadio]]'', and ''[[Numb3rs]]'', as well as a book titled ''The Vesuvius Prophecy'', based on ''[[The 4400]]'' TV series.<!--Once again, please do not add additional examples here; if you have a citable example, please consider adding it to the article "D.

Cooper in popular culture".--><ref name="slatta">{{cite book | first = Richard W. | last = Slatta | year = 2001 | title = The Mythical West: An Encyclopedia of Legend, Lore and Popular Culture}} Over the years there have been a few small bars in various United States cities named D.B. Cooper's. In 2004 the movie "Without a Paddle" involved the missing D. B. Cooper.</ref>

<ref name="cylinders">
  When Schaffner's description was relayed to the FBI command post in Portland, agents pointed out that dynamite sticks are typically brown or beige in color; the eight red cylinders were probably highway or railroad flares. But because they could not be certain, intervention could not be recommended. ({{harvnb|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|pp=40–41}})
</ref>

<ref name="twenty">
  According to most sources, Cooper directed that the ransom be supplied in the form of 20-dollar bills; but Himmelsbach, who was present when the demands were first received, wrote that he specified only "negotiable American currency, denomination not important." ({{harvnb|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=18}}) All sources agree that the ransom was supplied in the form of 20-dollar bills.
</ref>

<ref name="parachutes">
  Earl Cossey, the skydiving instructor who supplied the parachutes, told some sources that three of the four parachutes (one primary and both reserves) were returned to him. The FBI has always maintained that only two parachutes, a primary and a cannibalized reserve, were found aboard the plane. ({{harvnb|Gunther|1985|p=50}})
