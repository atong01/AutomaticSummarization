His father, Wilfred Everett Bixby II, was a store clerk and his mother, Jane (ne MacFarland) Bixby, was a senior manager at I. Magnin &amp; Co. In 1942, when Bixby was eight years old, his father enlisted in the Navy during World War II and traveled to the South Pacific. While in the seventh grade, Bixby attended Grace Cathedral and sang in the church's choir. In one notable incident, he shot the bishop using a slingshot during one service and was kicked out of the choir. In 1946, his mother encouraged him to take ballroom dance lessons and from there he started dancing all around the city. While dancing, he attended<space/><link><target>Lowell High School (San Francisco)</target><part>Lowell High School</part></link><space/>where he perfected his oratory and dramatic skills as a member of the Lowell Forensic Society. Though he received average grades, he also competed in high school speech tournaments regionally. After graduation from high school in 1952, against his parents' wishes, he majored in drama at<space/><link><target>San Francisco City College</target></link>, where he was a classmate to<space/><link><target>Lee Meriwether</target></link>, another young actress who was later to win the title of Miss America as Miss California 1954.

Later, he attended the<space/><link><target>University of California, Berkeley</target></link>, his parents' alma mater. Just four credits short of earning a degree, Bixby dropped out of college and was drafted into the Marines.</paragraph><paragraph>He then moved to<space/><link><target>Hollywood, California</target></link>, where he had a string of odd jobs that included bellhop and lifeguard.

Bill wasn't the first actor to portray a single widowed father, but he became one of the popular ones, because of his easy-going way of this crazy little kid.&quot; Prior to Bixby's promotion as the director, Brandon said, &quot;He was looking for the best dolly grip, along with the boom operator that if something was called specifically and failed, Bill could be easily angry.&quot; On the kind of relationship Bill had wanted with his co-star, Brandon also said, &quot;Bill would never speak down to me. Bill treated me as an equal. He made sure that we had a lot of time together, just so he could kinda crawl inside my head and see what actually made a kid tick.&quot; The final thing he realized of Bill's real-life father's death in 1971, and when asked about his mentors fathers loss, he stated: &quot;He had that type of mentality that the show must go on, thinking it was just a great T.V. show, after he broke down weeping.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="author"><space/></arg><arg name="title">Bill Bixby biography</arg><arg name="url">http://www.biography.com/people/bill-bixby-9542610<space/></arg><arg name="work">A+E Networks Digital</arg><arg name="date"><space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">January 27, 2013</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>1973 to 1977</heading><paragraph>In 1973, Bixby starred in<space/><italics><link><target>The Magician (U.S. TV series)</target><part>The Magician</part></link></italics>.
