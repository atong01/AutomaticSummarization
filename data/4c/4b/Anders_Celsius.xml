Celsius' participation in the Lapland expedition won him much respect in Sweden with the government and his peers, and played a key role in generating interest from the Swedish authorities in donating the resources required to construct a new modern observatory in Uppsala. He was successful in the request, and Celsius founded the<space/><link><target>Uppsala Astronomical Observatory</target></link><space/>in 1741. The observatory was equipped with instruments purchased during his long voyage abroad, comprising the most modern instrumental technology of the period.</paragraph><paragraph>In astronomy, Celsius began a series of observations using colored glass plates to record the magnitude (a measure of brightness) of certain stars. This was the first attempt to measure the intensity of starlight with a tool other than the human eye. He made observations of eclipses and various astronomical objects and published catalogues of carefully determined magnitudes for some 300 stars using his own photometric system (mean error=0.4 mag).<extension extension_name='ref' name="astro.uu.se"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Celsius was the first to perform and publish careful experiments aiming at the definition of an international<space/><link><target>temperature</target></link><space/><link><target>Celsius</target><part>scale</part></link><space/>on scientific grounds. In his Swedish paper &quot;Observations of two persistent degrees on a thermometer&quot; he reports on experiments to check that the freezing point is independent of latitude (and of atmospheric pressure). He determined the dependence of the boiling of water with atmospheric pressure which was accurate even by modern day standards. He further gave a rule for the determination of the boiling point if the barometric pressure deviates from a certain standard pressure.<extension extension_name='ref' name="history"><link type='external' href='http://www.astro.uu.se/history/celsius_scale.html'>History of the Celsius temperature scale</link></extension><space/>He proposed the Celsius temperature scale in a paper to the<space/><link><target>Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala</target></link>, the oldest Swedish scientific society, founded in 1710. His thermometer was calibrated with a value of 100 for the freezing point of water and 0 for the boiling point. In 1745, a year after Celsius' death, the scale was reversed by<space/><link><target>Carl Linnaeus</target></link><space/>to facilitate more practical measurement.<extension extension_name='ref' name="reversed"><link type='external' href='http://www.linnaeus.uu.se/online/life/6_32.html'>Linnaeus' thermometer</link></extension><space/>Celsius originally called his scale centigrade derived from the Latin for &quot;hundred steps&quot;.
