{{Eucharist}}

The '''Eucharist''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|juː|k|ər|ɪ|s|t}} (also called '''Holy Communion''', the '''Lord's Supper''',<!-- Along with "Eucharist" these two names are the most common and should appear here. Do not add other names to the lead --> and [[#Names|other names]]) is a [[rite]] considered by most [[Christianity|Christian]] churches to be a [[sacrament]]. According to the [[New Testament]], it was instituted by [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] during his [[Last Supper]]. Giving his disciples bread and wine during the [[Passover]] meal, Jesus commanded his followers to "do this in memory of me," while referring to the bread as "my body" and the wine as "my blood."<ref name="EB" /><ref>Ignazio Silone, ''Bread and Wine'' (1937).</ref> Through the Eucharistic celebration Christians remember [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ's sacrifice]] of himself once and for all on the cross.<ref name="Methcat">{{cite book|title=A Catechism for the use of people called Methodists|date=2000|publisher=Methodist Publishing House|location=Peterborough, England|isbn=9781858521824|pages=26}}</ref>

[[Christian]]s generally recognize a special presence of Christ in this rite, though they differ about exactly how, where, and when Christ is present. While all agree that there is no perceptible change in the elements, some believe that they actually become the [[Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist|body and blood of Christ]], others believe the true body and blood of Christ are really present [[Sacramental union|in, with, and under]] the bread and wine (whose reality remains unchanged), others believe in a "real" but merely spiritual presence of Christ in the Eucharist, and still others take the act to be only a symbolic reenactment of the Last Supper. Many [[Protestantism|Protestants]] view the Eucharist as an ''[[Ordinance (Christianity)|ordinance]]'' in which the ceremony is seen not as a specific channel of divine [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]], but as an expression of faith and of obedience to Christ.

In spite of differences between Christians about various aspects of the Eucharist, there is, according to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', "more of a consensus among Christians about the meaning of the Eucharist than would appear from the confessional debates over the sacramental presence, the effects of the Eucharist, and the proper auspices under which it may be celebrated."<ref name="EB">[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9033174/Eucharist Encyclopædia Britannica, s.v. Eucharist]</ref>

The word ''Eucharist'' may refer not only to the rite but also to the [[Sacramental bread|consecrated bread]] (leavened or unleavened) and [[Sacramental wine|wine]] (or grape juice) used in the rite. In this sense, communicants (that is, those who partake of the communion elements) may speak of "receiving the Eucharist", as well as "celebrating the Eucharist".

===Lord's Supper===
{{anchor|Supper}}
The Lord's Supper, in [[Greek language|Greek]] Κυριακὸν δεῖπνον (''Kyriakon deipnon''), was in use in the early 50s of the 1st century,<ref name=LaV/><ref name=Schr/> as witnessed by the [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#11:20|11:20-21]]): <blockquote>When you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper you eat, for as you eat, each of you goes ahead without waiting for anybody else. One remains hungry, another gets drunk.</blockquote> Those mentioned above in relation to the term "Eucharist" rarely use the expression "the Lord's Supper", but it is the predominant term among [[Baptist]] groups, who generally avoid using the term "Communion", and is preferred also by some evangelical [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] and [[Methodism|Methodists]].

[[File:Last-supper-from-Kremikovtsi.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Kremikovtsi Monastery]] fresco (15th century) depicting the [[Last Supper]] celebrated by Jesus and his disciples. The early Christians too would have celebrated this meal to commemorate Jesus' death and subsequent resurrection.]]

===Communion or Holy Communion===
{{anchor|Communion}}
Communion or Holy Communion are used by some groups originating in the [[Protestant Reformation]] to mean the entire Eucharistic rite. Others, such as the Catholic Church, do not use this term for the rite, but instead mean by it the act of partaking of the consecrated elements: they speak of receiving Holy Communion even outside of the rite, and of participating in the rite without receiving Holy Communion. The term "Communion" is derived from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''communio'' ("sharing in common"), which translates Greek κοινωνία (''koinōnía'') in {{bibleref2|1cor|10:16|||1 Corinthians 10:16}}:<blockquote> The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the ''communion'' of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the ''communion'' of the body of Christ?.</blockquote>

===Other terms===
;Breaking of Bread: The phrase ({{lang-gr|του κλασαι αρτον}}) appears five times in the New Testament ({{Bibleref2|Luke|24:35}}; {{Bibleref2|Acts|2:42}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|2:46}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|20:7}} and {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|20:11}}) in contexts which, according to some, refer to celebration of the Eucharist.<ref>{{cite book| last=Richardson| first=Alan| title=Introduction to the Theology of the New Testament| location=London| publisher=SCM| page=364}}</ref> It is the term used by the [[Plymouth Brethren]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia| encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church; Nature| editor1-last=Cross| editor1-first=F.

;Mass: [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] is used in the [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Catholic Church]], some Anglicans ([[Anglo-Catholicism]]), the [[Church of Sweden]], the [[Church of Norway]], the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]], and some other forms of [[Western Christianity]]. Among the many other terms used in the Catholic Church are "Holy Mass", "the Memorial of the Passion, Death and Resurrection of the Lord", the "Holy Sacrifice of the Mass", and the "Holy Mysteries".<ref>{{cite book | author=Catholic Church | year=2006 |title=Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church | page=275 | publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana }}, and {{cite book | author=Catholic Church | year=1997 |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church | pages=1328–1332 | isbn=978-1-57455-110-5 |url =http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3Y.HTM }}</ref> The term "Mass" is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''{{lang|la|missa}}'' (dismissal), a word used in the concluding formula of Mass in Latin: ''Ite, missa est'' ("Go; it is the dismissal").<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Liturgy of the Mass}}</ref>  The word 'dismissal' has come to imply a 'mission', because at the end of the Mass the congregation are sent out to serve Christ.<ref name="Methcat" />

;Sacrament or Blessed Sacrament: The "[[Blessed Sacrament]]" and the "Blessed Sacrament of the Altar" are common terms used by Catholics, Lutherans and some Anglicans (Anglo-Catholicism) for the consecrated elements, especially when reserved in a [[Church tabernacle|tabernacle]]. "Sacrament of the Altar" is in common use also among Lutherans. In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] the term "[[Sacrament (Mormonism)|The Sacrament]]" is used of the rite.

;Divine Liturgy: [[Divine Liturgy|This term]] is used in [[Byzantine Rite]] traditions, whether in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] or among the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]. These also speak of "the Divine Mysteries", especially in reference to the consecrated elements, which they also call "the Holy Gifts".<ref group="note">Within [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], the "Oblation" is the term used in the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syrian]], [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] and [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian]] churches, while "Consecration" is used in the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]]. "Oblation" and "Consecration" are of course used also by the Eastern Catholic Churches that are of the same liturgical tradition as these churches. Likewise, in the [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] language of Ireland and Scotland the word "Aifreann", usually translated into English as "Mass", is derived from [[Late Latin]] "Offerendum", meaning "oblation", "offering".</ref>

;Divine Service: [[Divine Service (Lutheran)|This]] is the title for the liturgy in Lutheran churches and is used by most [[Confessional Lutheran|conservative Lutheran]] churches to refer to the Eucharistic liturgy.

[[File:Juan de Juanes 002.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Christ with the Eucharist'', [[Vicente Juan Masip]], 16th century.]]

===Biblical basis===
The [[Last Supper]] appears in all three [[Synoptic Gospels]]: [[Gospel according to Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel according to Mark|Mark]], and [[Gospel according to Luke|Luke]]. It also is found in the [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]],<ref name=EB/><ref>Tyndale Bible Dictionary / editors, Philip W. Comfort, Walter A. Elwell, 2001 ISBN 0-8423-7089-7, article: ''Lord's Supper, The''</ref><ref>Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church / editors, F. L. Cross & E. A. Livingstone 2005 ISBN 978-0-19-280290-3, article ''Eucharist''</ref> which suggests how early Christians celebrated what [[Paul the Apostle]] called the Lord's Supper.

====Paul the Apostle and the Lord's Supper====
In his [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] (''c'' 54-55), [[Paul the Apostle]] gives the earliest recorded description of Jesus' [[Last Supper]]: "The Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, 'This is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me. ' In the same way he took the cup also, after supper, saying, 'This cup is the [[New Covenant|new covenant]] in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me{{' "}}.{{Bibleref2c|1cor|11:23-25||1 Cor. 11:23-25}}

====Gospels====
{{Expand section|1=<nowiki />
* more from the Synoptic gospels
|date=September 2014}}

The synoptic gospels, {{Bibleref2|Mark|14:22-25}}, {{Bibleref2|Matthew|26:26-29|NIV}}, {{Bibleref2|Luke|22:13-20|NIV}}, depict Jesus as presiding over the Last Supper. The versions in Matthew and Mark are almost identical;<ref>Heron, Alisdair >I.C. ''Table and Tradition'' Westminster Press, Philadelphia (1983) p. 3</ref> but Luke's Gospel presents a textual problem in that a few manuscripts omit the second half of verse 19 and all of v.20 ("given for you … poured out for you") which are found in the vast majority of ancient witnesses to the text.<ref>Metzger, Bruce M. ''A Textual Commentary on the New Testament'' UBS (1971) pp.173f</ref> If the shorter text is the original one, then Luke's account is independent of both that of Paul and that of Matthew/Mark.  If the majority longer text comes from the author of the third gospel then his version is very similar to that of Paul in 1 Corinthians being somewhat fuller in its description of the early part of the Supper,<ref>Heron, Alisdair >I.C. ''Table and Tradition'' Westminster Press, Philadelphia (1983) p. 5</ref> particularly in making specific mention of a cup being blessed before the bread was broken.<ref>Caird, G.B. ''The Gospel of Luke'' Pelican (1963) p. 237</ref>

In the gospel of John, however, the account of the Last Supper does not mention Jesus taking bread and "the cup" and speaking of them as his body and blood; instead it recounts his humble act of washing the disciples' feet, the prophecy of the betrayal, which set in motion the events that would lead to the cross, and his long discourse in response to some questions posed by his followers, in which he went on to speak of the importance of the unity of the disciples with him and each other.<ref name="Harris">[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.</ref><ref>Tyndale Bible Dictionary / editors, Philip W. Comfort, Walter A. Elwell, 2001 ISBN 0-8423-7089-7, article: "John, Gospel of"</ref> In {{Bibleref2|John|6:26-65|NIV}}, the evangelist attributes a long discourse to Jesus which deals with the subject of the living bread and in {{Bibleref2|John|6:51-59|NIV|verses 52-59}} contains echoes of Eucharistic language. The interpretation of the whole passage has been extensively debated.{{why|date=May 2015}} Hoskyns{{who|date=May 2015}} notes three main schools of thought: (a) the language is metaphorical and verse 63: "The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you—they are full of the Spirit" and life" gives the author's precise meaning; (b) vv 51-58 are a later interpolation which cannot be harmonized with the context; (c) the discourse is homogeneous, sacrificial and sacramental and can be harmonized though not all attempts are satisfactory.<ref>Hoskyns, Sir Edwyn, ''The Fourth Gospel'', Faber and Faber, 1940, p. 304</ref>

====Agape feast====
[[File:Agape feast 07.jpg|thumb|right|Early Christian painting of an Agape feast.]]
The expression ''The Lord's Supper'', derived from [[St. Paul]]'s usage in {{bibleref2|1cor|11:17-34||1 Cor. 11:17-34}}, may have originally referred to the [[Agape feast]] (or love feast), the shared communal meal with which the Eucharist was originally associated.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lambert |first=J.C. |title=''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co. |year=1978 |edition=reprint |isbn=0-8028-8045-2}}</ref> The Agape feast is mentioned in {{Bibleref2|Jude|12|NIV}}. But ''The Lord's Supper'' is now commonly used in reference to a celebration involving no food other than the sacramental bread and wine.

===Early Christian sources===
The [[Didache]] (Greek: teaching) is an early Church treatise that includes instructions for [[Baptism]] and the Eucharist. Most scholars date it to the early 2nd century,<ref>[[Bruce Metzger]]. The canon of the New Testament. 1997</ref> and distinguish in it two separate Eucharistic traditions, the earlier tradition in chapter 10 and the later one preceding it in chapter 9.<ref>"There are now two quite separate Eucharistic celebrations given in Didache 9-10, with the earlier one now put in second place".

But let no one eat or drink of your Eucharist, unless they have been baptized into the name of the Lord; for concerning this also the Lord has said, "Give not that which is holy to the dogs". 10.1 After you have had your fill, give thanks thus: 10.2 We give thanks to you holy Father for your holy Name which you have made to dwell in our hearts and for the knowledge, faith and immortality which you have revealed to us through Jesus your servant.

==Eucharistic theology==
{{Main|Eucharistic theology}}
Many Christian denominations classify the Eucharist as a [[sacrament]].<ref>For example, Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, "Anglo-Catholic" Anglicans, Old Catholics; and cf. the presentation of the Eucharist as a sacrament in the [http://www.oikoumene.org/en/resources/documents/wcc-commissions/faith-and-order-commission/i-unity-the-church-and-its-mission/baptism-eucharist-and-ministry-faith-and-order-paper-no-111-the-lima-text/baptism-eucharist-and-ministry. html#c10499 ''Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry'' document] of the [[World Council of Churches]]</ref> Some [[Protestants]] prefer to call it an ''[[Ordinance (Christianity)|ordinance]]'', viewing it not as a specific channel of [[divine grace]] but as an expression of faith and of obedience to Christ.

Most Christians, even those who deny that there is any real change in the elements used, recognize a special presence of [[Christ]] in this rite. But Christians differ about exactly how, where and how long Christ is present in it.<ref>"Most Christian traditions also teach that Jesus is present in the Eucharist in some special way, though they disagree about the mode, the locus, and the time of that presence" ([http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9033174/Eucharist Encyclopædia Britannica Online)].</ref> [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], and the [[Church of the East]] teach that the reality (the "substance") of the elements of bread and wine is wholly changed into the body and blood of Jesus Christ, while the appearances (the "species") remain. [[Transubstantiation]] (change of the reality) is the term used by Catholics to denote ''what'' is changed, not to explain ''how'' the change occurs, since the Catholic Church teaches that "the signs of bread and wine become, ''in a way surpassing understanding'', the Body and Blood of Christ".<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3Z.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1333] (emphasis added)</ref> [[Lutheran]]s believe that the body and blood of Jesus are present "in, with and under" the forms of bread and wine, a concept known as the [[sacramental union]]. The [[Reformed]] churches, following the teachings of [[John Calvin]], believe in an immaterial, spiritual (or "pneumatic") presence of Christ by the power of the [[Holy Spirit]] and received by faith. [[Anglicans]] adhere to [[Anglican eucharistic theology|a range of views]] although the teaching on the matter in the [[Thirty-Nine Articles|Articles of Religion]] holds that the presence is real only in a heavenly and spiritual sense. Some Christians reject the concept of the real presence, believing that the Eucharist is only a ceremonial remembrance or [[memorialism|memorial]] of the death of Christ.

The ''Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry'' document of the [[World Council of Churches]],<ref>[http://www.oikoumene.org/en/resources/documents/wcc-commissions/faith-and-order-commission/i-unity-the-church-and-its-mission/baptism-eucharist-and-ministry-faith-and-order-paper-no-111-the-lima-text?set_language=en Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry (Faith and Order Paper no. 111, the "Lima Text")]</ref> attempting to present the common understanding of the Eucharist on the part of the generality of Christians, describes it as "essentially the sacrament of the gift which God makes to us in Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit", "Thanksgiving to the Father", "Anamnesis or Memorial of Christ", "the sacrament of the unique sacrifice of Christ, who ever lives to make intercession for us", "the sacrament of the body and blood of Christ, the sacrament of his [[Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist|real presence]]", "Invocation of the Spirit", "Communion of the Faithful", and "Meal of the Kingdom".

==Ritual and liturgy==

===Roman Catholic===
{{Main|Eucharist in the Catholic Church}} {{see also|Mass (liturgy)}}
[[File:Ecce Agnus Dei.jpg|thumb|right|250px|At a Solemn [[Tridentine Mass]], the host is displayed to the people before communion.]]

The [[Catholic Church]] teaches that once consecrated in the Eucharist, the elements cease to be bread and wine and actually ''become'' the body and blood of Christ,<ref>[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct13.html Council of Trent, Decree concerning the Most Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist, chapter IV and canon II]</ref> each of which is accompanied by the other and by Christ's soul and divinity.<ref>Council of Trent, Decree concerning the Most Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist, canon III</ref> The empirical appearance and physical properties are not changed, but for Catholics, the reality is. The consecration of the bread (known as the [[Host (Holy Communion)|host]]) and wine represents the separation of Jesus' body from his blood at [[Calvary]]. However, since he has risen, the Church teaches that his body and blood can no longer be truly separated. Where one is, the other must be. Therefore, although the priest (or [[extraordinary minister of Holy Communion]]) says, "The body of Christ", when administering the host, and, "The blood of Christ", when presenting the chalice, the communicant who receives either one receives Christ, whole and entire.

[[File:BentoXVI-51-11052007 (frag).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Pope Benedict XVI]] celebrates a Mass.]]
The Catholic Church sees as the main basis for this belief the words of Jesus himself at his Last Supper: the [[Synoptic Gospels]] ({{Bibleref2|Matthew|26:26-28|NAB}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|14:22-24|NAB}}; {{Bibleref2|Luke|22:19-20|NAB}}) and [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul's]]  {{bibleref2|1cor|11:23-25||1&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;11:23-25}}) recount that in that context Jesus said of what to all appearances were bread and wine: "This is my body … this is my blood." The Catholic understanding of these words, from the Patristic authors onward, has emphasized their roots in the covenantal history of the Old Testament. The interpretation of Christ's words against this Old Testament background coheres with and supports belief in the [[Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist|Real Presence]].<ref>[http://stephenpimentel.tripod.com/papers/eucharist2.html "Abrahamic, Mosaic, and Prophetic Foundations of the Eucharist". ''Inside the Vatican'' 16, no. 4 (2008): 102-105.]</ref>

In 1551, the [[Council of Trent]] definitively declared: "Because Christ our Redeemer said that it was truly his body that he was offering under the species of bread,{{Bibleref2c|Jn.|6:51}} it has always been the conviction of the Church of God, and this holy Council now declares again, that by the consecration of the bread and wine there takes place a change of the whole substance of the bread into the substance of the body of Christ our Lord and of the whole substance of the wine into the substance of his blood. This change the holy Catholic Church has fittingly and properly called [[transubstantiation]]."<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P41.html ''CCC 1376'']</ref><ref>[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct13.html Session XIII, chapter IV]; cf. canon II)</ref> The [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] in 1215 had spoken of "Jesus Christ, whose body and blood are truly contained in the sacrament of the altar under the forms of bread and wine; the bread being changed (''transsubstantiatis'') by divine power into the body, and the wine into the blood."<ref group="note">[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/lateran4.html Canon 1.] A misprint in this source gives "transubstantiatio" in place of "transubstantiatis" of the original: "Iesus Christus, cuius corpus et sanguis in sacramento altaris sub speciebus panis et vini veraciter continentur, transsubstantiatis pane in corpus, et vino in sanguinem potestate divina" ([http://catho.org/9.php?d=bxw#bo5 Denzinger 8020.]</ref> The attempt by some twentieth-century Catholic theologians to present the Eucharistic change as an alteration of significance ([[transignification]] rather than transubstantiation) was rejected by [[Pope Paul VI]] in his 1965 encyclical letter [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_03091965_mysterium_en.html ''Mysterium fidei''] In his 1968 [http://www.ewtn.com/library/papaldoc/p6credo.htm ''Credo of the People of God''], he reiterated that any theological explanation of the doctrine must hold to the twofold claim that, after the consecration, 1) Christ's body and blood are really present; and 2) bread and wine are really absent; and this presence and absence is ''real'' and not merely something in the mind of the believer.

On entering a church, [[Latin Church]] Catholics [[genuflect]] to the consecrated host in the [[church tabernacle|tabernacle]] that holds the consecrated host, in order to acknowledge respectfully the presence of Jesus in the [[Blessed Sacrament]], a presence to which a [[votive candle]] or [[sanctuary lamp]] kept burning close to such a tabernacle draws attention.

===Eastern Christianity===
[[File:Liturgy St James 1.jpg|thumb|Eucharistic elements prepared for the Divine Liturgy.]]
{{Main|Divine Liturgy}}
Among Eastern Christians, the Eucharistic service is called the ''Divine Liturgy'' ([[Byzantine Rite]]) or similar names in other rites. It comprises two main divisions: the first is the ''Liturgy of the Catechumens'' which consists of introductory litanies, antiphons and scripture readings, culminating in a reading from one of the [[Gospels]] and, often, a [[homily]]; the second is the ''Liturgy of the Faithful'' in which the Eucharist is offered, consecrated, and received as Holy Communion. Within the latter, the actual Eucharistic prayer is called the ''[[anaphora (liturgy)|anaphora]], '' literally: "offering" or "carrying up" ({{lang|grc|ἀνα- + φέρω}}). In the [[Rite of Constantinople]], two different anaphoras are currently used: one is attributed to Saint [[John Chrysostom]], the other to [[Basil of Caesarea|Saint Basil the Great]]. Among the [[Oriental Orthodox]], a variety of anaphoras are used, but all are similar in structure to those of the Constantinopolitan Rite, in which the Anaphora of Saint John Chrysostom is used most days of the year; Saint Basil's is offered on the Sundays of [[Great Lent]], the eves of [[Christmas]] and [[Theophany]], [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]], [[Holy Saturday]], and upon his feast day (1 January). At the conclusion of the Anaphora the bread and wine are held to be the Body and Blood of Christ. Unlike the Latin Church, the [[Byzantine Rite]] uses leavened bread, with the leaven symbolizing the presence of the Holy Spirit.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=zSXu17g7BRwC&pg=PA90#v=onepage&q&f=false Steven Runciman, The Great Church in Captivity (Cambridge University Press 1968 ISBN 0-521-31310-4), p. 90]</ref> The [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], like the Latin Church, uses unleavened bread.

Conventionally this change in the elements is understood to be accomplished at the ''[[Epiclesis]]'' ([[Greek language|Greek:]] "invocation") by which the [[Holy Spirit]] is invoked and the [[consecration]] of the bread and wine as the true and genuine Body and Blood of Christ is specifically requested, but since the anaphora as a whole is considered a unitary (albeit lengthy) prayer, no one moment within it can be readily singled out.

===Anglican===
{{Main|Anglican Eucharistic theology}} {{see also|Book of Common Prayer}}
In most churches of the [[Anglican Communion]], the Eucharist is celebrated every Sunday, having replaced Morning Prayer as the principal service. The rites for the Eucharist are found in the various [[Book of Common Prayer|prayer books]] of [[Anglican]] churches. Wine and unleavened wafers or leavened bread is used. Daily celebrations are the norm in many [[cathedral]]s and parish churches typically offer one or more Eucharists during the week. Only a small minority of parishes with a priest do not celebrate the Eucharist at least once each Sunday. The nature of the ceremony, however, varies according to the theological orientation of the priest, parish, [[diocese]] or regional church.

===Protestant===
{{Overly detailed|date=April 2015|section=yes}}
====Baptist====
[[File:Communion Baptist.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Serving of elements individually, to be taken in unison, is common among Baptists]]
The bread and "fruit of the vine" indicated in Matthew, Mark and Luke as the elements of the ''Lord's Supper''<ref>{{bibleref|Matthew|26:26–29}}, {{bibleref|Mark|14:22–25}}, {{bibleref|Luke|22:19}}</ref> are interpreted by many [[Baptists]] as unleavened bread (although leavened bread is often used) and, in line with the historical stance of some Baptist groups (since the mid-19th century) against partaking of alcoholic beverages, [[grape juice]], which they commonly refer to simply as "the Cup".<ref>See, e.g., {{cite book | first=J. R. | last=Graves | year=1928 | title=What is It to Eat and Drink Unworthily | publisher=Baptist Sunday School Committee | oclc=6323560}}</ref> The unleavened bread also underscores the symbolic belief attributed to Christ's breaking the bread and saying that it was his body. A [[saltine cracker|soda cracker]] is often used.

Most Baptists do not consider the Communion or its elements to be sacramental; rather, it is considered to be an act of remembrance of Christ's atonement, and a time of renewal of personal commitment. However, with the rise of [[confessionalism (religion)|confessionalism]], many Baptists have denied memorialism as a 19th-century doctrinal novelty, and have taken up a Reformed view of Communion.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Confessional Baptists believe in pneumatic presence, which is expressed in the [[1689 Baptist Confession of Faith|Second London Baptist Confession]], specifically in Chapter 30, Articles 3 and 7:

{{quote|Art. 3. The Lord Jesus hath, in this ordinance, appointed his ministers to pray, and bless the elements of bread and wine, and thereby to set them apart from a common to a holy use, and to take and break the bread; to take the cup, and, they communicating also themselves, to give both to the communicants.<br/>
Art. 7. Worthy receivers, outwardly partaking of the visible elements in this ordinance, do then also inwardly by faith, really and indeed, yet not carnally and corporally, but spiritually receive, and feed upon Christ crucified, and all the benefits of his death; the body and blood of Christ being then not corporally or carnally, but spiritually present to the faith of believers in that ordinance, as the elements themselves are to their outward senses.}}

This view is prevalent among [[Southern Baptists]], those in the Founders movement (a Calvinistic movement within the some [[Independent Baptists]], [[Freewill Baptists]], and several individuals in other Baptist associations.

As in many churches, Communion practices and frequency vary among congregations. A typical practice is to have small cups of juice and plates of broken bread distributed to the seated congregation by a group of deacons, elders, or ushers. In others congregations, communicants may proceed to the altar to receive the elements, then return to their seats. A widely accepted practice is for all to receive and hold the elements until everyone is served, then consume the bread and cup in unison. Usually, music is performed and Scripture is read during the receiving of the elements.

Some Baptist churches are closed-Communionists (even requiring full membership in the church before partaking), with others being partially or fully open-Communionists. It is rare to find a Baptist church where The Lord's Supper is observed every Sunday; most observe monthly or quarterly, with some holding Communion only during a designated Communion service or following a worship service.

====Lutheran====
[[File:EucharistELCA.JPG|right|thumb|Table set for the Eucharist in an ELCA service]]
{{Main|Eucharist in Lutheranism}}
{{see also|Divine Service (Lutheran)}}
[[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]s believe that the body and blood of Christ are "truly and substantially present in, with, and under the forms" of the consecrated bread and wine (the elements), so that communicants eat and drink the body and blood of Christ himself as well as the bread and wine in this [[Lutheran sacraments|sacrament]].<ref>[[Augsburg Confession]], Article 10</ref> The Lutheran doctrine of the Real Presence is more accurately and formally known as the "[[sacramental union]]". It has been inaccurately called "[[consubstantiation]]".<ref>F. L. Cross, ed., ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'', second edition, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1974), 340 ''sub loco''.</ref> This term is specifically rejected by Lutheran churches and theologians since it creates confusion about the actual doctrine and subjects the doctrine to the control of a non-biblical philosophical concept in the same manner as, in their view, does the term "[[transubstantiation]]".<ref>J. T. Mueller, <cite>''Christian Dogmatics: A Handbook of Doctrinal Theology''</cite>, (St. Louis: CPH, 1934), 519; cf. also Erwin L. Lueker, <cite>''Christian Cyclopedia''</cite>, (St. Louis: CPH, 1975), under the entry "consubstantiation".</ref>

While an official movement exists in Lutheran congregations celebrate Eucharist weekly, using formal rites very similar to the Catholic and "high" Anglican services, it was historically common for congregations to celebrate monthly or even quarterly.<ref>[http://www.livingwordmedina.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7&Itemid=8 What Lutherans Believe About Holy Communion].

====Mennonites and Anabaptists====
Traditional [[Mennonite]] and German Baptist Brethren Churches such as the [[Church of the Brethren]] churches and congregations have the Agape Meal, footwashing and the serving of the bread and wine two parts to the Communion service in the [[Lovefeast]]. In the more modern groups, Communion is only the serving of the Lord’s Supper. In the communion meal, the members of the Mennonite churches renew their covenant with God and with each other.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gameo.org/encyclopedia/contents/O745ME.html |title=Ordinances |publisher=GAMEO |date=24 August 2013 |accessdate=11 October 2013}}</ref>

====Open Brethren and Exclusive Brethren====
Among [[Open Brethren|Open]] assemblies, also termed [[Plymouth Brethren]], the Eucharist is more commonly called the Breaking of Bread or the Lord's Supper. It is seen as a symbolic memorial and entirely non-sacramental, and central to the worship of both individual and assembly.<ref name="Darby">Darby, J.N., quoted in Bradshaw, P.F. ''The new SCM dictionary of liturgy and worship'', p.375</ref> In principle the service is open to all [[baptism|baptised]] Christians, however an individual's eligibility to participate depends on the views of each particular assembly. The service takes the form of non-liturgical, open worship with all male participants allowed to pray audibly and select hymns or readings. The breaking of bread itself typically consists of one leavened loaf which is prayed over and broken by a participant in the meeting,<ref>Muller, G. (1860) ''A Narrative of some of the Lords dealings with George Muller'', pp.279-281</ref> and then shared around. The wine is poured from a single container into one or several vessels, and these are again shared around.<ref>Bradshaw, P.F. ''The new SCM dictionary of liturgy and worship'', p.375</ref><ref>[http://www.brethrenonline.org/faqs/Brethren.htm Brethren Online FAQs]</ref>

The [[Exclusive Brethren]] follow a similar practice to the [[Open Brethren]]. The Eucharist they also call the Breaking of Bread or the Lord's Supper.<ref name="Darby" />

====Reformed/Presbyterian====
In the [[Reformed Churches]] the Eucharist is variously administered. The Calvinist view of the Sacrament sees a real presence of Christ in the supper which differs both from the objective ontological presence of the Catholic view, and from the real absence of Christ and the mental recollection of the memorialism of the Zwinglians<ref>McGrath, Alister E. ''Reformation Thought'' Oxford: Blackwell (2003) p.189</ref> and their successors.

[[File:South Leith communion token reverse.jpg|thumb|150px|Many Presbyterian churches historically used [[communion token]]s to provide entrance to the Lord's Supper.]]
The bread and wine become the means by which the believer has real communion with Christ in his death and Christ's body and blood are present to the faith of the believer as really as the bread and wine are present to their senses but this presence is "spiritual", that is the work of the Holy Spirit.<ref>Hendry, George S. ''The Westminster Confession for Today'' SCM (1960) p.232</ref> There is no standard frequency; John Calvin desired weekly communion, but the city council only approved monthly, and monthly celebration has become the most common practice in Reformed churches today.

Many, on the other hand, follow [[John Knox]] in celebration of the Lord's supper on a quarterly basis, to give proper time for reflection and inward consideration of one's own state and sin. Recently, Presbyterian and Reformed Churches have been considering whether to restore more frequent communion, including weekly communion in more churches, considering that infrequent communion was derived from a memorialist view of the Lord's Supper, rather than Calvin's view of the sacrament as a means of grace.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.opc.org/OS/html/V6/4l.html|title=The Lord’s Supper: How Often?|author=D. G. Hart and John R. Muether|journal=Ordained Servant|volume=6|issue=4|date=October 1997}}</ref> Some churches use bread without any raising agent (whether [[leaven]] or [[yeast]]), in view of the use of [[matzo|unleavened bread]] at [[Passover seder|Jewish Passover meals]], while others use any bread available.

The [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]], for instance, prescribes "bread common to the culture". Harking back to the [[regulative principle of worship]], the Reformed tradition had long eschewed coming forward to receive communion, preferring to have the elements distributed throughout the congregation by the presbyters (elders) more in the style of a shared meal. Wine and grape juice are both used, depending on the congregation.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}
 
Openness ranges between open communion (any believer may participate, e.g. the PCUSA) to closed (only members of the denomination may partake). Most Reformed churches would practice a balance between these, i.e., all believers who are united to a church of like faith and practice, and who are not living in sin, would be allowed to join in the Sacrament, sometimes with a requirement of pastoral or elder approval.

====Methodist====
[[File:Methodistcommunion6.jpg|150px|thumb|right|A United Methodist minister consecrating the elements]]
[[Methodism|Methodists]] have differing views on the nature of the Sacrament, but commonly grape juice is used instead of wine to include those who do not take alcohol for any reason.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umc.org/what-we-believe/why-do-most-methodist-churches-serve-grape-juice-instead-of-wine |title=... the use of unfermented grape juice by The United Methodist Church ... expresses pastoral concern for recovering alcoholics, enables the participation of children and youth, and supports the church's witness of abstinence.}}</ref> Variations of the Eucharistic Prayer are provided for various occasions, including communion of the sick and brief forms for occasions that call for greater brevity. Though the ritual is standardized, there is great variation amongst United Methodist churches, from typically high-church to low-church, in the enactment and style of celebration. Methodist clergy are not required to be vested when celebrating the Eucharist, though the [[alb]] and [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] is common.

[[United Methodists]] in the United States are encouraged to celebrate the Eucharist every Sunday, though it is typically celebrated on the first Sunday of each month, while a few go as long as celebrating quarterly (a tradition dating back to the days of [[circuit rider (religious)|circuit rider]]s that served multiple churches). Communicants may receive standing, kneeling, or while seated. Gaining more wide acceptance is the practice of receiving by intinction (receiving a piece of consecrated bread or wafer, dipping it in the blessed wine, and consuming it). The most common alternative to intinction is for the communicants to receive the consecrated juice using small, individual, specially made glass or plastic cups known as communion cups.<ref>[http://www.christianbook.com/Christian/Books/product Communion Cups, 1000] from Broadman / Holman Church Supply. Christianbook.com. Accessed 5 July 2009.</ref> United Methodists practice open communion, inviting "all who intend a Christian life, together with their children" to receive Communion.<ref>UMC 1992, 29.</ref> 

The ''Catechism for the use of the people called Methodists'' states that, "[in the Eucharist] Jesus Christ is present with his worshipping people and gives himself to them as their Lord and Saviour".<ref name="Methcat" /> The ''Catechism'' does not identify the exact nature of this [[Real presence|presence]].

====Nondenominational/Evangelical Christians====
[[File:Lord's cup and Bread.JPG|thumb|right|Communion elements: [[matzo]] is sometimes used for bread, emphasising the "re-creation" of the Last Supper.]]
Many Non-denominational Christians including the [[Churches of Christ]] receive communion every Sunday. Others, including [[Evangelical]] churches such as the [[Church of God (Anderson, Indiana)|Church of God]], [[Calvary Chapel]] and many forms of [[Baptist]], typically receive communion on a monthly or periodic basis. Many Non-denominational Christians hold to the Biblical [[autonomy]] of local churches and have no universal requirement among congregations.

The [[Churches of Christ]], among others, use [[grape juice]] and unleavened wafers or unleavened bread and practice open communion.

===Other Christian churches===
====Syriac====
{{Main|Holy Qurbana}}
'''Holy Qurbana''' or '''Qurbana Qadisha, ''' the "Holy Offering" or "Holy Sacrifice", refers to the Eucharist as celebrated according to the [[East Syrian Rite|East Syrian]] and [[West Syrian Rite|West Syrian traditions]] of [[Syriac Christianity]]. The main [[Anaphora (liturgy)|Anaphora]] of the East Syrian tradition is the [[Holy Qurbana of Addai and Mari]], while that of the West Syrian tradition is the [[Liturgy of Saint James]]. Both are extremely old, going back at least to the third century, and are the oldest extant liturgies continually in use.

====Seventh-day Adventists====
In the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] the Holy Communion service customarily is celebrated once per quarter. The service includes the ordinance of [[footwashing]] and the Lord’s Supper. Unleavened bread and unfermented (non-alcoholic) grape juice is used. [[Open communion]] is practised: all who have committed their lives to the Saviour may participate. The communion service must be conducted by an ordained pastor, minister or church elder.<ref>Seventh-day Adventist Church Manual, 17th edition, 2005, pp. 81-86.

====Jehovah's Witnesses====
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] commemorate Christ's death as a [[ransom sacrifice|ransom]] or [[propitiation |propitiatory sacrifice]] by observing the '''Lord's Evening Meal''', also known as the '''Memorial of Christ's Death''', each year on the evening that corresponds to the Passover,<ref>''Reasoning From The Scriptures'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1989, p. 265.</ref> [[Quartodeciman|Nisan 14]], according to the ancient Jewish calendar.<ref>''Insight On The Scriptures'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1988, p. 392.</ref> They believe that this is the only annual religious observance commanded for Christians in the Bible.<ref>"Jehovah is a God of Covenants", ''The Watchtower'', February 1, 1998, page 8, "Jesus instituted the only annual religious observance commanded for Christians—the Memorial of his death."</ref>

Of those who attend the Memorial a small minority worldwide partake of the wine and unleavened bread. Jehovah's Witnesses believe that [[144,000#Jehovah's Witnesses|only 144,000]] people will receive heavenly salvation and immortal life and thus spend eternity with God and Christ in heaven, as under-priests and co-rulers under [[Christ the King]] and [[High priest#Christianity|High Priest]], in [[God's Kingdom|Jehovah's Kingdom]]. Paralleling the [[anointing]] of kings and priests, they are referred to as the "anointed" class and are the only ones who should partake of the bread and wine.  They believe that the "[[other sheep]]" of Christ's flock also benefit from the [[ransom sacrifice]], and are respectful observers of the Lord's Supper Remembrance, with hope of receiving everlasting life in Paradise restored on a "New Earth".<ref name=jwbh>{{cite book|title=What Does the Bible Really Teach?|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1102005155|publisher=Watch Tower Society|page=207}}</ref>

The Memorial, held after sundown, includes a sermon on the meaning and importance of the celebration and gathering, and includes the circulation and viewing among the audience of unadulterated red wine and unleavened bread (matzo). Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the bread symbolizes and represents Jesus Christ's perfect body which he gave on behalf of mankind, and that the wine represents his perfect blood which redeems fallen man from inherited sin and death. The wine and the bread (sometimes referred to as "emblems") are viewed as symbolic and commemorative; the Witnesses do not believe in [[transubstantiation]] or [[consubstantiation]]; so not a literal presence of flesh and blood in the emblems, but that the emblems are simply symbolisms denoting spiritual realities.<ref name=jwbh /><ref>"Discerning What We Are — At Memorial Time", ''The Watchtower'', February 15, 1990, p. 16.</ref>

==Non-observing denominations==

While the [[Salvation Army]] does not reject the Eucharistic practices of other churches or deny that their members truly receive grace through this sacrament, it does not practice the sacraments of Communion or [[baptism]].  This is because they believe that these are unnecessary for the living of a Christian life, and because in the opinion of Salvation Army founders William and Catherine Booth, the sacrament placed too much stress on outward ritual and too little on inward spiritual conversion.<ref>[http://www.waterbeachsalvationarmy.org.uk/what-to-know-more/why-does-the-salvation-army-not-baptise-or-hold-communion/ Why Does the Salvation Army Not Baptize or Hold Communion Services?]</ref>

Emphasizing the inward spiritual experience of their adherents over any outward ritual, [[Quakers]] (members of the Religious Society of Friends) generally do not baptize or observe Communion.<ref>[http://www.fgcquaker.org/explore/faqs-about-quakers#Sacraments How do Quakers Practice Baptism and Communion?]</ref>

==Practice and customs==
===Open and closed communion===
{{Main|Open communion|Closed communion|Full communion}}
[[File:Eucharist001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|In the [[Latin Church|Western]] [[Catholic Church]], the administration of the Eucharist to children requires that they have sufficient knowledge and careful preparation to receive the body of Christ with faith and devotion.]]

[[Christianity|Christian]] denominations differ in their understanding of whether they may receive the Eucharist with those with whom they are not in [[full communion]]. The famed apologist [[Saint|St.]] [[Justin Martyr]] (c. 150) wrote: "No one else is permitted to partake of it, except one who believes our teaching to be true...." For the first several hundred years, non-members were forbidden even to be present at the sacramental ritual; visitors and [[catechumen]]s (those still undergoing instruction) were dismissed halfway through the Liturgy, after the Bible readings and sermon but before the Eucharistic rite. This ancient custom is still evident in the [[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite]], where the Mass is divided into two parts; the Mass of the Catechumens, and the Mass of the Faithful. The [[Divine Liturgy]] of St. John Chrysostom, used in the [[Byzantine Rite]], still has a formula of dismissal of catechumens (not usually followed by any action) at this point.

Churches such as the Catholic and the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox Churches]] practice [[closed communion]] under normal circumstances. However, the Catholic Church allows administration of the Eucharist, at their spontaneous request, to properly disposed members of the eastern churches ([[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Church of the East]]) not in full communion with it and of other churches that the [[Holy See]] judges to be sacramentally in the same position as these churches; and in grave and pressing need, such as danger of death, it allows the Eucharist to be administered also to individuals who do not belong to these churches but who share the Catholic Church's faith in the reality of the Eucharist and have no access to a minister of their own community.<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2S.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 844]</ref> Some [[Protestant]] communities exclude non-members from Communion.

Most [[Protestant]] communities, including, [[Congregational churches]], the [[Church of the Nazarene]], the [[Assemblies of God]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], most [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], [[Nondenominational Christianity]] (including the [[Churches of Christ]]), and [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] practice [[open communion]] in the sense of not limiting it to members of their own Church alone, but some of them require that the communicant be a baptized person or a member of a partner church. Some Progressive Christian congregations offer communion to any individual who wishes to commemorate the life and teachings of Christ, regardless of religious affiliation.<ref>In most United Church of Christ local churches, the Communion Table is "open to all Christians who wish to know the presence of Christ and to share in the community of God's people". (Book of Worship). [http://www.ucc.org/worship/communion/ Holy Communion: A Practice of Faith in the United Church of Christ]</ref>

In the [[Episcopal Church (United States)]], those who do not receive Holy Communion may enter the communion line with their arms crossed over their chest, in order to receive a [[blessing]] from the priest, instead of receiving Holy Communion.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Episcopal Handbook|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=C_s5hetFBYoC&pg=PA24&dq=Anglican+Cross+Arms+over+Chest+communion&hl=en&sa=X&ei=2Q7oT9L8KaPq2AXqzIyJDg&ved=0CF4Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=25 June 2012|date=1 September 2008|publisher=Church Publishing, Inc|quote=Pastoral blessings are often available for children or adults who are not communing. Simply cross your arms over your chest if you wish to receive a blessing.}}</ref>

Most Latter-Day Saint churches practice closed communion; one notable exception is the [[Community of Christ]], the second-largest denomination in this movement.<ref>[http://www.cofchrist.org/sacraments/communion.asp Community of Christ: Communion]</ref> While The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the largest of the LDS denominations) technically practice a closed communion, their official direction to local Church leaders (in Handbook 2, section 20.4.1, last paragraph) is as follows: "Although the sacrament is for Church members, the bishopric should not announce that it will be passed to members only, and nothing should be done to prevent nonmembers from partaking of it."<ref>https://www.lds.org/handbook/handbook-2-administering-the-church/priesthood-ordinances-and-blessings?lang=eng#204</ref>

===Preparation===
{{Main|Eucharistic discipline}}

====Catholic====
The Catholic Church requires its members to receive the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacrament]] of [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Penance or Reconciliation]] before taking Communion, if they are aware of having committed a grave sin,<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P39.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 916]</ref><ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-2_lt.html#TITULUS_XVI Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 711]</ref> and to prepare by fasting, prayer and other works of piety.<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-2_lt.html#TITULUS_XVI Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 713]</ref><ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P39.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 919]</ref>

====Eastern Orthodox====
Traditionally, the Eastern Orthodox church has required its members to have observed all church-appointed fasts (most weeks, this will be at least Wednesday and Friday) for the week prior to partaking of communion, and to fast from all food and water from midnight the night before.  In addition, Orthodox Christians are to have made a recent confession to their priest (the frequency varying with one's particular priest),<ref>[http://www.orthodoxchristian.info/pages/communion.htm Preparing to Receive Holy Communion]</ref> and they must be at peace with all others, meaning that they hold no grudges or anger against anyone.<ref name="How to Prepare for the Eucharist">[http://www.stgeorgegoc.org/eucharist.html How to Prepare for the Eucharist]</ref> In addition, one is expected to attend [[Vespers]] or the [[All-Night Vigil]], if offered, on the night before receiving communion.<ref name="How to Prepare for the Eucharist"/> Furthermore, various pre-communion prayers have been composed, which many (but not all) Orthodox churches require or at least strongly encourage members to say privately before coming to the Eucharist.<ref>[http://www.stlukeorthodox.com/html/parishinfo/preparation.cfm Preparation for Holy Communion]</ref>

====Protestant confessions====
Many Protestant congregations generally reserve a period of time for self-examination and private, silent confession just before partaking in the Lord's Supper.

====Footwashing====
Seventh Day Adventists, [[Mennonites]], and some other groups participate in "[[foot washing]]" (cf. {{Bibleref2|John|13:3-17}}) as a preparation for partaking in the Lord's Supper. At that time they are to individually examine themselves, and confess any sins they may have between one and another.

===Adoration===
{{Further|Eucharistic adoration}}
[[File:Eucharistic Adoration.jpg|thumb|upright|The Eucharist displayed in a [[monstrance]], flanked by candles]]
Eucharistic adoration is a practice in the Roman Catholic, Anglo-Catholic and some Lutheran traditions, in which the [[#Other terms|Blessed Sacrament]] is exposed to and adored by the faithful. When this exposure and adoration is constant (twenty-four hours a day), it is called ''Perpetual Adoration''. In a parish, this is usually done by volunteer parishioners; in a [[monastery]] or convent, it is done by the resident [[monk]]s or [[nun]]s. In the ''Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament'', the Eucharist is displayed in a [[monstrance]], typically placed on an altar, at times with a light focused on it, or with candles flanking it.

===Health issues===
====Gluten====
{{Main|Coeliac disease #Social and religious issues}}
The [[gluten]] in wheat bread may be dangerous to people with [[celiac disease]]. For the Catholic Church, this issue was addressed in the 24 July 2003 [http://www.adoremus.org/CDF_Lowgluten-mustum2003.html letter] of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], which summarized and clarified earlier declarations. The Catholic Church believes that the matter for the Eucharist must be wheaten bread and fermented wine from grapes: it holds that, if the gluten has been entirely removed, the result is not true wheaten bread,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/Liturgy/zlitur47.htm |title=Gluten-free Hosts |accessdate=2008-04-22 |last=McNamara |first= Father Edward |date=2004-09-14 |year=|month= |work= ZENIT International News Agency}}</ref> For celiacs, but not generally, it allows low-gluten bread. It also permits Holy Communion to be received under the form of either bread or wine alone, except by a priest who is celebrating Mass without other priests or as principal celebrant.<ref>The same 24 July 2003 letter of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]].</ref> Many Protestant churches offer communicants gluten-free alternatives to wheaten bread, usually in the form of a rice-based cracker or gluten-free bread.<ref>Jax Peter Lowell, [http://books.google.com/books?id=IRhm1A2_EkkC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false ''The Gluten-Free Bible''], p. 279.</ref>

====Alcohol====
{{See also|Christianity and alcohol}}
The Catholic Church believes that grape juice that has not begun even minimally to ferment cannot be accepted as wine, which it sees as essential for celebration of the Eucharist. For alcoholics, but not generally, it allows the use of [[mustum]] (grape juice in which fermentation has begun but has been suspended without altering the nature of the juice), and it holds that, "since Christ is sacramentally present under each of the species, communion under the species of bread alone makes it possible to receive all the fruit of Eucharistic grace. For pastoral reasons this manner of receiving communion has been legitimately established as the most common form in the Latin rite. "<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P42.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1390]</ref>

As already indicated, the one exception is in the case of a priest celebrating Mass without other priests or as principal celebrant. The water that in the [[Latin Church]] is prescribed to be mixed with the wine must be only a relatively small quantity.<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3A.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 924 §1]</ref> The practice of the [[Coptic Church]] is that the mixture should be two parts wine to one part water.<ref>[http://www.copticchurch.net/topics/thecopticchurch/sacraments/4_eucharist.html Sacrament of the Eucharist: Rite of Sanctification of the Chalice]</ref>

Many Protestant churches allow clergy and communicants to take [[mustum]] instead of wine. In addition to, or in replacement of wine, some churches offer grape juice which has been [[pasteurization|pasteurized]] to stop the fermentation process the juice naturally undergoes; de-alcoholized wine from which most of the alcohol has been removed (between 0.5% and 2% remains); or water.<ref>Compare John Howard Spahr, [http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=1605 I Smell the Cup], ''Christian Century'', 12 March 1974, pp. 257-259.</ref> Exclusive use of unfermented grape juice is common in [[Baptist]] churches, the [[United Methodist Church]], [[Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Christian Churches/Churches of Christ]], [[Churches of Christ]], [[Church of God (Anderson, Indiana)]] some [[Lutherans]], [[Assemblies of God]], [[Pentecostals]], [[Evangelicals]], the [[Christian Missionary Alliance]], and other American [[Nondenominational Christianity|independent]] Protestant churches.,

====Fear of transmission of diseases====
Risk of infectious disease transmission related to use of a common communion cup is low, to the point of being undetectable. No case of transmission of an infectious disease related to a common communion cup has ever been documented. The most likely diseases to be transmitted would be common viral illnesses such as the [[common cold]], but a study of 681 individuals found that taking communion up to daily from a common cup did not increase the risk of infection beyond that of those who did not attend services at all.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Risk of Infectious Disease Transmission from a Common Communion Cup |first=Lilia P. |last=Manangan |first2=Lynne M. |last2=Sehulster |first3=Linda |last3=Chiarello |first4=Dawn N. |last4=Simonds |first5=William R. |last5=Jarvis |journal=American Journal of Infection Control |date=October 1998 |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=538–539 |url= http://www.ntnl.org/index.php/component/docman/doc_download/470-common-cup-cdc |doi=10.1016/s0196-6553(98)70029-x}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Pellerin | first1 = J. | last2 = Edmond | first2 = M.

In influenza epidemics, some churches suspend the giving of communion under the form of wine, for fear of spreading the disease. This is in full accord with Catholic Church belief that communion under the form of bread alone makes it possible to receive all the fruit of Eucharistic grace. However, the same measure has been taken also by churches that normally insist on the importance of receiving communion under both forms. This was done in 2009 by the [[Church of England]].<ref>[http://www.christiantoday.com/article/archbishops.advise.against.sharing.chalice.during.swine.flu.pandemic/23882.htm Archbishops advise against sharing chalice during swine flu pandemic]</ref>

Some fear contagion through the handling involved in distributing the hosts to the communicants, even if they are placed on the hand rather than on the tongue. Accordingly, some churches use mechanical wafer dispensers or "pillow packs" (communion wafers with wine inside them). While these methods of distributing communion are not accepted in Catholic Church parishes, one such church provides a mechanical dispenser to allow those intending to communicate to place in a bowl, without touching them by hand, the hosts for use in the celebration.<ref>{{cite web| first= Sumathi |last=Reddy |url= http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704415104576065982762908782.html |title= Hands Off After Wafer Scare| publisher= Wall Street Journal| date=7 January 2011| accessdate=2012-10-12}}</ref>
