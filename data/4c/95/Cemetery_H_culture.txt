The '''Cemetery H culture''' was a Bronze Age culture in the Punjab, north-western India, from about 1900 BCE until about 1300 BCE. It has been related to both the late phase of the [[Harappan civilisation|Harappan]] (Indus Valley) civilisation, and the [[Indo-Aryan migrations]].

==Origins==
The Cemetery H culture was located in and around the [[Punjab region]] in present-day [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. It was named after a cemetery found in "area H" at [[Harappa]]. Remains of the culture have been dated from about 1900 BCE until about 1300 BCE.

According to Rafique Mughal, the Cemetery H culture developed out of the northern part of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] around 1700 BCE, being part of the Punjab Phase,<ref>M Rafiq Mughal Lahore Museum Bulletin, off Print, vol.III, No.2, Jul-Dec. 1990 [http://www.rafiquemughal.com/MUGHAL_1990_Decline-of-the-Indus_Lahore-Mus-Bulletin.pdf]</ref> one of three cultural phases that developed in the [[Localization Era]] or "Late Harappan phase" of the [[Indus Valley Tradition]].{{sfn|Kenoyer|1991a}}{{sfn|Shaffer|1992}} According to Kenoyer, the Cemetery H culture "may only reflect a change in the focus of settlement organization from that which was the pattern of the earlier Harappan phase and not cultural discontinuity, urban decay, invading aliens, or site abandonment, all of which have been suggested in the past."{{sfn|Kenoyer|1991b|p=56}} According to Kennedy and Mallory & Adams, the Cemetery H culture also "shows clear biological affinities" with the earlier population of Harappa.{{sfn|Kennedy|2000|p=312}} {{sfn|Mallory|Adams|1997|pp=103, 310}}

Some traits of the Cemetery H culture have been associated with the [[Gandhara Grave cuture|Swat culture]], which has been regarded as evidence of the Indo-Aryan movement toward the Indian subcontinent.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|1997|p=103}} According to Parpola, the Cemetery H culture represents a first wave of [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|Indo-Aryan migration]] from as early as 1900 BCE, which was followed by a migration to the Punjab c. 1700-1400 BCE.{{sfn|Parpola|1998}} According to Kochhar, the Swat IV co-founded the Harappan Cemetery H phase in Punjab (2000-1800 BCE), while the Rigvedic Indo-Aryans of Swat V later absorbed the Cemetery H people and gave rise to the Painted Grey Ware culture (to 1400 BCE).{{sfn|Kochhar|2000|pp=185-186}}

Together with the [[Gandhara grave culture]] and the [[Ochre Coloured Pottery culture]], the Cemetery H culture is considered by some scholars as a factor in the formation of the [[Vedic civilization]].{{sfn|Kochhar|2000|pp=185-186}}

==Features==
The distinguishing features of this culture include:<ref>http://pubweb.cc.u-tokai.ac.jp/indus/english/3_1_02.html</ref>
* The use of [[cremation]] of human remains. The bones were stored in painted pottery burial urns. This is completely different from the Indus civilization where bodies were buried in wooden coffins. The urn burials and the "grave skeletons" were nearly contemporaneous.{{sfn|Sarkar|1964}}
* Reddish pottery, painted in black with [[antelope]]s, [[peacock]]s etc., [[sun]] or [[star]] motifs, with different surface treatments to the earlier period.
* Expansion of settlements into the east.
* [[Rice]] became a main crop.
* Apparent breakdown of the widespread trade of the Indus civilization, with materials such as marine shells no longer used.
* Continued use of mud brick for building.

==Archeology==
Cremation in India is first attested in the Cemetery H culture, which is coincidentally referred to in the [[Vedas]]. The [[Rigveda]] contains a reference to the emerging practice, in [[Mandala 10|RV 10]].15.14, where the forefathers "both cremated (''agnidagdhá-'') and uncremated (''ánagnidagdha-'')" are invoked.<ref>Dudi, Amar Singh.
