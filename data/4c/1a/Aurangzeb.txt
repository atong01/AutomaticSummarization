'''Abul Muzaffar Muhi-ud-Din Muhammad Aurangzeb''' (14 October 1618 – 20 February 1707), commonly known as '''Aurangzeb Alamgir''' and by his imperial title '''Alamgir''' ("world-seizer" or "universe-seizer") and simply referred to as '''Aurangzeb''' was the sixth [[Mughal emperors|Mughal Emperor]] and ruled over most of the [[Indian subcontinent]] during some parts of his reign. His reign lasted for 49 years from 1658 until his death in 1707.

Aurangzeb was a notable expansionist and during his reign, the Mughal Empire temporarily reached its greatest extent. During his lifetime, victories in the south expanded the [[Mughal Empire]] to [[List of largest empires#Largest empires by land area and population|more than 3.2&nbsp;million square kilometres]] and he ruled over a population estimated as being in the range of 100–150 million subjects, with an annual yearly tribute of £38,624,680 in 1690 (the highest in the world at that time).

Aurangzeb's policies partly abandoned the legacy of pluralism, which remains a very controversial aspect of his reign. Rebellions and wars led to the exhaustion of the imperial Mughal treasury and army. He was a strong-handed authoritarian ruler, and following his death the expansionary period of the Mughal Empire came to an end, and centralized control of the empire declined rapidly.

==Early life==
[[File:ShujaAurganzebMurad.jpg|thumb|upright|A painting from circa 1637 shows the brothers (left to right) [[Shah Shuja (Mughal)|Shah Shuja]], Aurangzeb and [[Murad Baksh]] in their younger years.]]
Aurangzeb was born on 14 October 1618, in [[Dahod]], [[Gujarat]]. He was the third son and sixth child of [[Shah Jahan]] and [[Mumtaz Mahal]]. His father was a governor of Gujarat at that time. In June 1626, after an unsuccessful rebellion by his father, Aurangzeb and his brother [[Dara Shikoh]] were kept as hostages under their grandparents' ([[Nur Jahan]] and [[Jahangir]]) [[Lahore]] court. On 26 February 1628, Shah Jahan was officially declared the Mughal Emperor, and Aurangzeb returned to live with his parents at [[Agra Fort]], where Aurangzeb received his formal education in [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]. His daily allowance was fixed at Rs. 500 which he spent on religious education and the study of history. He also accused his brothers of alcoholism and womanising.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

On 28 May 1633 Aurangzeb escaped death when a powerful [[war elephant]] stampeded through the Mughal Imperial encampment. He rode against the elephant and struck its trunk with a [[lance]],<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schimmel|first=Annemarie|url=http://books.google.com/?id=N7sewQQzOHUC|year=2004|title=The empire of the great Mughals|publisher=Reaktion Books|place=London|isbn=1-86189-185-7|page=54}}
</ref> and successfully defended himself from being crushed. Aurangzeb's valour was appreciated by his father who conferred him the title of ''[[Rao Bahadur|Bahadur]]'' (Brave) and had him weighed in gold and presented gifts worth Rs. 200,000. This event was celebrated in [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Urdu]] verses and Aurangzeb said:<ref name="Hansen1986">{{cite book|author=Waldemar Hansen|title=The Peacock Throne: The Drama of Mogul India|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AV--abKg9GEC&pg=PA122|accessdate=23 November 2012|date=1 January 1986|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-0225-4|pages=122–124}}</ref>

==Early military campaigns and administration==

===Bundela War===

On 15 December 1634, Aurangzeb was given his first command, comprising 10,000 horse and 4000 [[Trooper (rank)|troopers]]. He was allowed to use the red tent, which was an imperial prerogative.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Subsequently, Aurangzeb was nominally in charge of the force sent to [[Bundelkhand]] with the intent of subduing the rebellious ruler of [[Orchha State|Orchha]], [[Jhujhar Singh]], who had attacked another territory in defiance of Shah Jahan's policy and was refusing to atone for his actions.<ref name="Richards1996p130">{{cite book |title=The Mughal Empire |series=The New Cambridge History of India |volume=5 |first=John F. |last=Richards |edition=Reprinted |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |isbn=9780521566032 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HHyVh29gy4QC&pg=PA1 |page=130 |accessdate=28 September 2012}}</ref> By arrangement, Aurangzeb stayed in the rear, away from the fighting, and took the advice of his generals as the [[Mughal Army]] gathered and commenced the Siege of Orchha in 1635.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} The campaign was successful and Singh was removed from power.<ref name="Richards1996p130" />

===Viceroy of the Deccan===

In 1644, Aurangzeb's sister, [[Jahanara Begum Sahib|Jahanara]], was burned when the chemicals in her perfume were ignited by a nearby lamp while in [[Agra]]. This event precipitated a family crisis with political consequences. Aurangzeb suffered his father's displeasure by not returning to Agra immediately but rather three weeks later. Shah Jahan had been nursing Jahanara back to health in that time and thousands of vassals had arrived in Agra to pay their respects.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Shah Jahan was outraged to see Aurangzeb enter the interior palace compound in military attire and immediately dismissed him from his position of Viceroy of the Deccan; Aurangzeb was also no longer allowed to use red tents or to associate himself with the official military standard of the Mughal emperor.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In 1645, he was barred from the court for seven months and mentioned his grief to fellow Mughal commanders. Thereafter, Shah Jahan appointed him governor of Gujarat where he served well and was rewarded for bringing stability.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In 1647, Shah Jahan moved Aurangzeb from Gujarat to be governor of [[Balkh]], replacing a younger son, [[Murad Baksh]], who had proved ineffective there. The area was under attack from [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] and [[Turkmen people|Turkoman]] tribes. Whilst the Mughal artillery and muskets were a formidable force, so too were the skirmishing skills of their opponents. The two sides were in stalemate and Aurangzeb discovered that his army could not live off the land, which was devastated by war. With the onset of winter, he and his father had to make a largely unsatisfactory deal with the Uzbeks, giving away territory in exchange for nominal recognition of Mughal sovereignty. The Mughal force suffered still further with attacks by Uzbeks and other tribesmen as it retreated through snow to [[Kabul]]. By the end of this two-year campaign, into which Aurangzeb had been plunged at a late stage, a vast sum of money had been expended for little gain.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Mughal Empire |series=The New Cambridge History of India |volume=5 |first=John F. |last=Richards |edition=Reprinted |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |isbn=9780521566032 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HHyVh29gy4QC&pg=PA1 |pages=132–133 |accessdate=29 September 2012}}</ref>

Further inauspicious military involvements followed, as Aurangzeb was appointed governor of [[Multan]] and [[Sindh]]. His efforts in 1649 and 1652 to dislodge the [[Safavid]]s at [[Kandahar]], which they had recently retaken after a decade of Mughal control, both ended in failure as winter approached. The logistical problems of supplying an army at the extremity of the empire, combined with the poor quality of armaments and the intransigence of the opposition have been cited by John Richards as the reasons for failure, and a third attempt in 1653, led by Dara Shikoh, met with the same outcome.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Mughal Empire |series=The New Cambridge History of India |volume=5 |first=John F. |last=Richards |edition=Reprinted |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |isbn=9780521566032 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HHyVh29gy4QC&pg=PA1 |pages=134–135 |accessdate=29 September 2012}}</ref>

Dara Shikoh's appointment followed the removal of Aurangzeb, who once again became Viceroy in the Deccan. He regretted this and harboured feelings that Shikoh had manipulated the situation to serve his own ends. Aurangbad's two ''[[jagir]]s'' (land grants) were moved there as a consequence of his return and, because the Deccan was a relatively impoverished area, this caused him to lose out financially. So poor was the area that grants were required from [[Malwa]] and Gujarat in order to maintain the administration and the situation caused ill-feeling between father and son. Shah Jahan insisted that things could be improved if Aurangzeb made efforts to develop cultivation, but the efforts that were made proved too slow in producing results to satisfy the emperor.<ref name="Chandra2005p267" />

Aurangzeb proposed to resolve the situation by attacking the dynastic occupants of [[Golconda]] (the [[Qutb Shahi]]s) and [[Bijapur district, Karnataka|Bijapur]] (the [[Adil Shahi]]s). As an adjunct to resolving the financial difficulties, the proposal would also extend Mughal influence by accruing more lands. Again, he was to feel that Dara had exerted influence on his father: believing that he was on the verge of victory in both instances, Aurangzeb was frustrated that Shah Jahan chose then to settle for negotiations with the opposing forces rather than pushing for complete victory.<ref name="Chandra2005p267" />

===War of Succession===
[[File:Aurangzebs palace.jpg|thumb|[[Sepoy]]s loyal to the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb maintain their positions around the palace, at Aurangabad, in 1658.]]
The four sons of Shah Jahan all held posts as governors during their father's reign. The emperor favoured the eldest, Dara Shikoh, and this had caused resentment among the younger three, who sought at various times to strengthen alliances between themselves and against Dara. There was no Muslim tradition of [[primogeniture]] and historian [[Satish Chandra]] says that "In the ultimate resort, connections among the powerful military leaders, and military strength and capacity [were] the real arbiters."<ref name="Chandra2005p267" /> Jacques Weber, emeritus professor of modern history at the [[University of Nantes]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.univ-nantes.fr/weber-j |title=Jacques Weber |publisher=Université de Nantes |date=19 November 2009 |language=French |accessdate=30 September 2012}}</ref> explains that "...&nbsp;the loyalties of these officials seem to have been motivated more by their own interests, the closeness of the family relation and above all the charisma of the pretenders than by ideological divides."<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uzOmy2y0Zh4C |chapter=Mogul Splendour: The successors of Akbar (1605–1707) |first=Jacques |last=Weber |editor-first=Claude |editor-last=Markovits |title=A History of Modern India, 1480–1950 |location=London |publisher=Anthem Press |year=2004 |origyear=1994 (Librarie Arthême Fayard, as ''L'Histoire de L'Inde Modern'')|isbn=9781843310044 |page=96 |accessdate=30 September 2012}}</ref> The contest for power was primarily between Dara Shikoh and Aurangzeb because, although all four sons had demonstrated competence in their official roles, it was around these two that the supporting cast of officials and other influential people mostly circulated.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Mughal Empire |series=The New Cambridge History of India |volume=5 |first=John F. |last=Richards |edition=Reprinted |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |isbn=9780521566032 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HHyVh29gy4QC&pg=PA151 |pages=151–152 |accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref> There were ideological differences&nbsp;— Dara was an intellectual and a religious liberal in the mould of Akbar, while Aurangzeb was much more conservative&nbsp;—&nbsp;but, as historians [[Barbara D.

Jahanara, certainly, interceded at various times on behalf of all of the princes and was well-regarded by Aurangzeb even though she shared the religious outlook of Dara.<ref name="Chandra2005p271" />

Having made clear that he wanted Dara to succeed him, Shah Jahan became ill with [[stranguary]] in 1657 and was closeted under the care of his favourite son in the newly built city of [[Shahjahanabad]] (Old Delhi). Rumours of the death of Shah Jahan abounded and the younger sons were concerned that Dara might be hiding it for [[Machiavellian]] reasons. Thus, they took action: [[Shah Shuja (Mughal)|Shah Shuja]] prepared to contest the throne from [[Bengal]], where he had been governor since 1637, while Murad did the same in his governorship of Gujarat and Aurangzeb did so in the Deccan. It is not known whether these preparations were made in the mistaken belief that the rumours of death were true or whether the challengers were just taking advantage of the situation.<ref name="Chandra2005p267">{{cite book |title=Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals |volume=2 |publisher=Har-Anand Publications |year=2005 |isbn=9788124110669 |first=Satish |last=Chandra |authorlink=Satish Chandra |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0Rm9MC4DDrcC&pg=PA267 |pages=267–269 |accessdate=29 September 2012}}</ref>

[[File:Estampes par Nicolas de Larmessin.f153.Aurangzeb, grand moghol.jpg|thumb|Aurangzeb becomes emperor.]]

After regaining some of his health, Shah Jahan moved to Agra and Dara urged him to send forces to challenge Shah Shuja and Murad, who had declared themselves rulers in their respective territories. While Shah Shuja was defeated at [[Varanasi|Banares]] in February 1658, the army sent to deal with Murad discovered to their surprise that he and Aurangzeb had combined their forces,<ref name="Chandra2005p271" /> the two brothers having agreed to partition the empire once they had gained control of it.<ref name="Chandra2005p272" /> The two armies clashed at Dharmat in April 1658, with Aurangzeb being the victor. Shuja was being chased through [[Bihar]] and the victory of Aurangzeb proved this to be a poor decision by Dara Shikoh, who now had a defeated force on one front and a successful force unnecessarily pre-occupied on another. Realising that his recalled Bihar forces would not arrive at Agra in time to resist the emboldened Aurangzeb's advance, Dara scrambled to form alliances in order but found that Aurangzeb had already courted key potential candidates. When Dara's disparate, hastily concocted army clashed with Aurangzeb's well-disciplined, battle-hardened force at the [[Battle of Samugarh]] in late May, neither Dara's men nor his generalship were any match for Aurangzeb. Dara had also become over-confident in his own abilities and, by ignoring advice not to lead in battle while his father was alive, he cemented the idea that he had usurped the throne.<ref name="Chandra2005p271">{{cite book |title=Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals |volume=2 |publisher=Har-Anand Publications |year=2005 |isbn=9788124110669 |first=Satish |last=Chandra |authorlink=Satish Chandra |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0Rm9MC4DDrcC&pg=PA270 |pages=270–271 |accessdate=29 September 2012}}</ref> "After the defeat of Dara, Shah Jahan was imprisoned in the fort of Agra where he spent eight long years under the care of his favourite daughter Jahanara."<ref name="sen2">{{Cite book |last=Sen |first=Sailendra |title=A Textbook of Medieval Indian History |publisher=Primus Books |year=2013 |isbn=978-9-38060-734-4 |page=183}}</ref>

Aurangzeb then broke his arrangement with Murad Baksh, which probably had been his intention all along.<ref name="Chandra2005p272" /> Instead of looking to partition the empire between himself and Murad, he had his brother arrested and imprisoned at Gwalior Fort. Murad was executed on 4 December 1661, ostensibly for the murder of the ''[[Diwan (title)|diwan]]'' of Gujarat some time earlier. The allegation was encouraged by Aurangzeb, who caused the ''diwan's'' son to seek retribution for the death under the principles of [[Sharia law]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Mughal Empire |series=The New Cambridge History of India |volume=5 |first=John F. |last=Richards |edition=Reprinted |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |isbn=9780521566032 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HHyVh29gy4QC&pg=PA162 |page=162 |accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref> Meanwhile, Dara gathered his forces, and moved to the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. The army sent against Shuja was trapped in the east, its generals [[Jai Singh I|Jai Singh]] and Dilir Khan submitted to Aurangzeb, but Dara's son, Suleiman Shikoh, escaped. Aurangzeb offered Shah Shuja the governorship of Bengal. This move had the effect of isolating Dara Shikoh and causing more troops to defect to Aurangzeb. Shah Shuja, who had declared himself emperor in Bengal began to annex more territory and this prompted Aurangzeb to march from Punjab with a new and large army that fought during the [[Battle of Khajwa]], where Shah Shuja and his [[chain mail|chain-mail]] armored war elephants were routed by the forces loyal to Aurangzeb. Shah Shuja then fled to [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] (in present-day Burma), where he was executed by the local rulers.<ref>''The Cambridge History of India'' (1922), vol. IV, p. 481.</ref>

With Shuja and Murad disposed of, and with his father immured in Agra, Aurangzeb pursued Dara Shikoh, chasing him across the north-western bounds of the empire. Aurangzeb claimed that Dara was no longer a Muslim and accused him of poisoning the Mughal [[Grand Vizier]] Saadullah Khan. Both of these statements however lacked any evidence.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} After a series of battles, defeats and retreats, Dara was betrayed by one of his generals, who arrested and bound him. In 1658, Aurangzeb arranged his formal coronation in Delhi.

"On 10 August 1659, Dara was executed on grounds of apostasy."<ref name="sen2"/>  Having secured his position, Aurangzeb confined his frail father at the Agra Fort but did not mistreat him. Shah Jahan was cared for by Jahanara and died in 1666.<ref name="Chandra2005p272">{{cite book |title=Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals |volume=2 |publisher=Har-Anand Publications |year=2005 |isbn=9788124110669 |first=Satish |last=Chandra |authorlink=Satish Chandra |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0Rm9MC4DDrcC&pg=PA270 |page=272 |accessdate=29 September 2012}}</ref>

Historian Katherine Brown has noted that "The very name of Aurangzeb seems to act in the popular imagination as a signifier of politico-religious bigotry and repression, regardless of historical accuracy."

[[File:Aurangzeb 27.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Aurangzeb compiled [[Hanafi]] law by introducing the [[Fatawa-e-Alamgiri]].]]

As emperor, Aurangzeb enforced morals and banned the consumption, usage and practices of: alcoholism, gambling, castration, servitude, [[eunuch]]s, music, [[nautch]] and [[narcotic]]s in the Mughal Empire. He learnt that at [[Sindh]], [[Multan]], [[Thatta]] and particularly at [[Varanasi]], the Hindu [[Brahmins]] attracted large numbers of indigenous local Muslims to their discourses. He ordered the Subahdars of these provinces to demolish the schools and the temples of non-Muslims.<ref name="Mukhiapp25-26" /> Aurangzeb also ordered Subahdars to punish Muslims who dressed like non-Muslims. The executions of the [[antinomian]] Sufi mystic [[Sarmad Kashani]] and the ninth Sikh Guru [[Tegh Bahadur]] bear testimony to Aurangzeb's religious intolerance; the former was beheaded on multiple accounts of heresy,{{efn| It has however been argued that the Mughal emperor had political motives for this particular execution.

Another instance of Aurangzeb's notoriety was his policy of temple destruction, for which figures vary wildly from 80 to 60,000.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Richard M. |last=Eaton |url=http://www.hindu.com/fline/fl1726/17260700.pdf |title=Temple Desecration and Indo-Muslim States |year=2000 |page=297 |location=Chennai, India |work=The Hindu}}</ref> Indian historian [[Harbans Mukhia]] wrote that "In the end, as recently recorded in Richard Eaton's careful tabulation, some 80 temples were demolished between 1192 and 1760 (15 in Aurangzeb's reign) and he compares this figure with the claim of 60,000 demolitions, advanced rather nonchalantly by 'Hindu nationalist' propagandists,' although even in that camp professional historians are slightly more moderate."<ref name="Mukhiapp25-26">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dFDV5IJSbWEC |title=The Mughals of India |first=Harbans |last=Mukhia |pages=25–26}}</ref> Among the Hindu temples he demolished were the three most sacred: the [[Kashi Vishwanath temple]], [[Kesava Deo temple]] and [[Somnath temple]].

[[Francois Bernier]], who traveled and chronicled Mughal India during the War of Succession, notes the distaste of both Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb for Christians. This led to the demolition of Christian settlements near the European factories and enslavement of Christian converts by Shah Jahan. Furthermore, Aurangzeb stopped all the aid to Christian missionaries (Frankish Padres) that had been initiated by Akbar and Jahangir.<ref>{{cite book |first=Francois |last=Bernier |authorlink=Francois Bernier |title=Travels Through the Mogul Empire |isbn=978-1-931641-22-7}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2012}}

[[Ram Puniyani]] states that Aurangzeb was not always fanatically anti-Hindu, and kept changing his policies depending on the needs of the situation. He banned the construction of new temples, but permitted the repair and maintenance of existing temples. He also made generous donations of ''[[jagir]]''s to several temples to win the sympathies of his Hindu subjects. There are several ''firman''s (orders) in his name, supporting temples and [[gurudwara]]s, including [[Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga|Mahakaleshwar temple]] of [[Ujjain]], Balaji temple of [[Chitrakoot district|Chitrakoot]], [[Umananda Temple]] of [[Guwahati]] and the [[Shatrunjaya]] Jain temples.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=Fn7GhTpJ4esC&lpg=PA60&ots=n_1c4gWmr8&dq=Balaji%20temple%20aurangzeb&pg=PA60#v=onepage&q=firmans&f=false Communal politics: facts versus myths] by Ram Puniyani, Page 60</ref> During his time, the number of Hindu Mansabdars increased from 22% to 31% in the Mughal administration as he needed them to continue his fight in the Deccan.<ref name="google1"/>

===Execution of opponents===
The first prominent execution during the long reign of Aurangzeb started with that of his brother Prince [[Dara Shikoh]], who was accused of being influenced by Hinduism although some sources argue it was done for political reasons.<ref name="Larson">Gerald James Larson, ''India's Agony Over Religion'', (State University of New York Press, 1995), 111.</ref><ref name="Larson" /> Aurangzeb had his allied brother Prince [[Murad Baksh]] held for murder, judged and then executed.<ref>''The Cambridge Shorter History of India'', Vol. II, ed.

===Expansion of the Mughal Empire===
[[File:Darbarscene.jpg|thumb|Aurangzeb seated on a golden throne holding a [[Hawk]] in the [[Durbar (court)|Durbar]]. Standing before him is his son, [[Azam Shah]].]]

Throughout his reign, Aurangzeb engaged in almost constant warfare. He built up a massive army and began a program of military expansion along all the boundaries of his empire. He pushed north-west into the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and also drove south, conquering two further Muslim kingdoms{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} - the Adil Shahis of Bijapur and Qutbshahis of Golconda&nbsp;— to add to the defeat of the [[Ahmednagar Sultanate]] that had been accomplished in 1636 while he had been viceroy of the Deccan. These new territories were administered by the Mughal [[Nawab]]s loyal to Aurangzeb.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Soon after seizing the throne, Aurangzeb began advancements against the unruly [[Sultan]] of Bijapur and during 1657, the Mughals are known to have utilized [[rocket]]s during the [[Siege of Bidar]], against [[Sidi Marjan]].<ref name="Prasad1974">{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yAJuAAAAMAAJ |title=The Mughal Empire |first=Ishwari |last=Prasad |publisher=Chugh Publications |year=1974 |accessdate=29 April 2012}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2012}} Aurangzeb's forces discharged rockets and grenades while scaling the walls, and Sidi Marjan himself was mortally wounded after a rocket struck his large gunpowder depot. After twenty-seven days of hard fighting, [[Bidar]] was captured by the Mughals.<ref name="Prasad1974" />

In 1663, during his visit to [[Ladakh]], Aurangzeb established direct control over that part of the empire and loyal subjects such as Deldan Namgyal agreed to pledge tribute and loyalty. Deldan Namgyal is also known to have constructed a Grand Mosque in [[Leh]], which he dedicated to Mughal rule.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mg8My6WaWRcC&pg=PA63 |title=Rediscovery of Ladakh |first=H.

In 1664, [[Shaista Khan]] (the son of [[Abul-Hasan ibn Mirza Ghiyas Beg|Asaf Khan IV]]), was appointed the [[Subedar]] of Bengal. He immediately eliminated Portuguese and [[Arakanese people|Arakanese]] pirates from the region, and in 1666 led an army of 70,000 men to recapture the port of [[Chittagong]] from the Arakanese king [[Sanda Thudhamma]]. Chittagong remained a key port throughout Mughal rule.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uzOmy2y0Zh4C |chapter=Mogul Splendour: The successors of Akbar (1605–1707) |first=Jacques |last=Weber |editor-first=Claude |editor-last=Markovits |title=A History of Modern India, 1480-1950 |location=London |publisher=Anthem Press |year=2004 |origyear=1994 (Librarie Arthême Fayard, as ''L'Histoire de L'Inde Modern'')|isbn=9781843310044 |accessdate=30 September 2012}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2012}}

In 1685, Aurangzeb dispatched his son, [[Muhammad Azam Shah]], with a force of nearly 50,000 men to capture [[Bijapur Fort]] and defeat [[Sikandar Adil Shah]] (the ruler of Bijapur) who refused to be a vassal. The Mughals could not make any advancements upon Bijapur Fort mainly because of the superior usage of cannon batteries on both sides. Outraged by the stalemate Aurangzeb himself arrived on 4 September 1686 and commanded the [[Siege of Bijapur]]; after eight days of fighting, the Mughals were victorious.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Only one remaining ruler, [[Abul Hasan Qutb Shah]] (the Qutbshahi ruler of Golconda), refused to surrender. He and his servicemen fortified themselves at Golconda and fiercely protected the [[Kollur Mine]], which was then probably the world's most productive diamond mine, and an important economic asset. In 1687, Aurangzeb led his grand Mughal army against the Deccan Qutbshahi fortress during the [[Siege of Golconda]]. The Qutbshahis had constructed massive fortifications throughout successive generations on a [[granite]] hill over 400&nbsp;ft high with an enormous eight-mile long wall enclosing the city. The main gates of Golconda had the ability to repulse any war elephant attack. Although the Qutbshahis maintained the impregnability of their walls, at night Aurangzeb and his infantry erected complex [[scaffold]]ing that allowed them to scale the high walls. During the eight-month siege the Mughals faced many hardships including the death of their experienced commander [[Kilich Khan II|Kilich Khan Bahadur]]. Eventually, Aurangzeb and his forces managed to penetrate the walls by capturing a gate, and their entry into the fort led Abul Hasan Qutb Shah to surrender peacefully.

Despite these innovations, most soldiers used bows and arrows, the quality of sword manufacture was so poor that they preferred to use ones imported from England, and the operation of the cannons was entrusted not to Mughals but to European gunners. Other weapons used during the period included rockets, cauldrons of boiling oil, muskets and [[manjaniq]]s (stone-throwing catapults).<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of Greek Fire and Gunpowder |first=James Riddick |last=Partington |authorlink=James Riddick Partington |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=1998 |origyear=1960 (Cambridge: W.

====War elephants====
In the year 1703, the Mughal commander at [[Coromandel Coast|Coromandel]], Daud Khan Panni spent 10,500 coins to purchase 30 to 50 [[war elephant]]s from [[Ceylon]].<ref>{{Google books |id=3C1vz5ioOMwC |page=122 |title=Mughal Warfare: Indian Frontiers and Highroads to Empire, 1500–1700 }}</ref>

===Art and Culture===
Aurangzeb was known to be of a more austere nature than his predecessors. Being religious he encouraged Islamic calligraphy. His reign also saw the building of the Lahore  badshahi Mosque, and Bibi ka Maqbara in Aurangabad.

====Calligraphy====

====Architecture====
Unlike his father, Aurangzeb was not much interested in architecture. The structure of [[Bibi Ka Maqbara]] in Aurangabad,which now is a historical monument was constructed by the sons of Aurangzeb in remembrance of their mother. The inspiration came from Taj mahal as is quite visible from its architecture. Aurangzeb ordered the construction of the [[Badshahi Mosque]] in [[Lahore]]. Aurangzeb constructed a small marble mosque known as the [[Moti Masjid (Delhi)|Moti Masjid]] (Pearl Mosque) in the [[Red Fort]] complex in Delhi. He also constructed a mosque on [[Benares]]. The mosque he constructed in Srinagar is still the largest in [[Kashmir]].

====Textile====
The Textile industry in the Mughal Empire emerged very firmly during the reign of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb and was particularly well noted by Francois Bernier, a French physician of the Mughal Emperor. Francois Bernier writes how ''Karkanahs'', or workshops for the artisans, particularly in textiles flourished by "employing hundreds of embroiderers, who were superintended by a master". He further writes how "Artisans manufacture of silk, fine brocade, and other fine muslins, of which are made turbans, robes of gold flowers, and tunics worn by females, so delicately fine as to wear out in one night, and cost even more if they were well embroidered with fine needlework".<ref name="saudiaramcoworld">{{cite web|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/201104/mughal.maal.htm|title=Saudi Aramco World :         Mughal Maal|publisher=saudiaramcoworld.com|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>

He also explains the different techniques employed to produce such complicated textiles such as ''Himru'' (whose name is Persian for "brocade"), ''Paithani'' (whose pattern is identical on both sides), ''Mushru'' (satin weave) and how ''Kalamkari'', in which fabrics are painted or block-printed, was a technique that originally came from Persia. Francois Bernier provided some of the first, impressive descriptions of the designs and the soft, delicate texture of [[Shawl|Pashmina Shawl]]s also known as ''Kani'', which were very valued for their warmth and comfort among the Mughals, and how these textiles and shawls eventually began to find their way to [[France]] and [[England]].<ref name="saudiaramcoworld2">{{cite web|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200204/pashmina-kashmir.s.best.cashmere.htm|title=Saudi Aramco World :         Pashmina: Kashmir's Best Cashmere|publisher=saudiaramcoworld.com|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>

As soon as he became emperor, Aurangzeb sent some of the finest ornate gifts such as carpets, lamps, [[tile]]s and others to the Islamic shrines at [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]. He also ordered the construction of very large ships in [[Surat]] that would transport these gifts and even pilgrims to the [[Hijaz]].

===Relations with the Uzbek===
Subhan Quli, Balkh's Uzbek ruler was the first to recognize him in 1658 and requested for a general alliance, he worked alongside the new Mughal Emperor since 1647 when Aurangzeb was the Subedar of Balkh.

===Relations with the Safavid dynasty===
Aurangzeb received the embassy of [[Abbas II of Persia]] in 1660 and returned them with gifts. However relations between the Mughal Empire and the [[Safavid dynasty]] were tense because the Persians attacked the Mughal army positioned near [[Kandahar]]. Aurangzeb prepared his armies in the Indus River Basin for a counteroffensive, but Abbas II's death in 1666 caused Aurangzeb to end all hostilities. Aurangzeb's rebellious son, [[Sultan Muhammad Akbar]], sought refuge with [[Suleiman I of Persia]], who had rescued him from the [[Imam]] of [[Musqat]] and later refused to assist him in any military adventures against Aurangzeb.<ref>{{cite book |first=Rudi |last=Matthee |title=Persia in Crisis: Safavid Decline and the Fall of Isfahan |pages=126, 136 |url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=fFaw4od7nfUC&pg=PA126|isbn=9781845117450 |date=2011-12-15 }}</ref>

===Relations with the French===
In the year 1667 the French East India Company ambassadors Le Gouz and Bebert presented [[Louis XIV of France]]'s letter which urged the protection of French merchants from various rebels in the Deccan. In response to the letter Aurangzeb issued a [[Firman]] allowing the French to open a factory in [[Surat]].

===Relations with the Sultanate of Maldives===
In the 1660s, the Sultan of the Maldives, [[Ibrahim Iskandar I]], requested help from Aurangzeb's representative, the [[Faujdar]] of [[Balasore]].

===Relations with the English===
[[File:The English ask pardon of Aurangzeb.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A member of the [[English East India Company]] requests pardon from Aurangzeb during the [[Child's War]].]]

In 1686, the English East India Company, which had unsuccessfully tried to obtain a [[firman]], an imperial directive that would grant England regular trading privileges throughout the Mughal empire, initiated the so-called [[Child's War]]. This hostility against the empire ended in disaster for the English, particularly when Aurangzeb dispatched a strong fleet from [[Janjira]] commanded by the [[Sidi Yaqub]] and manned by [[Mappila]] loyal to [[Arakkal kingdom|Ali Raja Ali II]] and [[People of Ethiopia|Abyssinian]] sailors firmly blockaded Bombay in 1689.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vvNtAAAAMAAJ |title=Aurangzeb and His times |first=Zahiruddin |last=Faruki |publisher=Idarah-i Adabiyāt-i Delli |year=1935 |location=Bombay |edition=Reprinted |accessdate=29 April 2012}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2012}} In 1690 the company sent envoys to Aurangzeb's camp to plead for a pardon. The company's envoys had to prostrate themselves before the emperor, pay a large indemnity, and promise better behavior in the future.

In September 1695, English pirate [[Henry Every]] perpetrated one of the most profitable pirate raids in history with his capture of a Grand Mughal convoy near [[Surat]]. The Indian ships had been returning home from their annual pilgrimage to Mecca when the pirates struck, capturing the ''[[Ganj-i-Sawai]]'', reportedly the greatest ship in the Muslim fleet, and its escorts in the process. When news of the piracy reached the mainland, a livid Aurangzeb nearly ordered an armed attack against the English-governed city of [[Bombay]], though he finally agreed to compromise after the East India Company promised to pay financial reparations, estimated at £600,000 by the Mughal authorities.<ref name="Burgess">{{cite journal |last1=Burgess |first1=Douglas R. |year=2009 |title=Piracy in the Public Sphere: The Henry Every Trials and the Battle for Meaning in Seventeenth‐Century Print Culture |journal=Journal of British Studies |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=887–913 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |doi=10.1086/603599 }}</ref> Meanwhile, Aurangzeb shut down four of the East India Company's factories, imprisoned the workers and captains (who were nearly lynched by a rioting mob), and threatened to put an end to all English trading in India until Every was captured.<ref name="Burgess"/> The Privy Council and East India Company offered a massive bounty for Every's apprehension, leading to the first worldwide manhunt in recorded history.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Pirates' Pact: The Secret Alliances Between History's Most Notorious Buccaneers and Colonial America |last=Burgess |first=Douglas R. |year=2009 |publisher= McGraw-Hill |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-07-147476-4 |page=144}}</ref> However, Every successfully eluded capture.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

In 1657, while Aurangzeb attacked Golconda and Bijapur in the Deccan, the [[Hindu]] [[Maratha]] warrior aristocrat, [[Shivaji]], used guerrilla tactics to take control of three Adil Shahi forts formerly under his father's command. With these victories, Shivaji assumed de facto leadership of many independent Maratha clans. The Marathas harried the flanks of the warring Adil Shahis and Mughals, gaining weapons, forts, and territory.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kincaid |first=Dennis |year=1937 |title=The Grand Rebel: An Impression of Shivaji, Founder of the Maratha Empire |location=London |publisher=Collins |pages=72–78}}</ref> Shivaji's small and ill-equipped army survived an all out Adil Shahi attack, and Shivaji personally killed the Adil Shahi general, Afzal Khan.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kincaid |first=Dennis |year=1937 |title=The Grand Rebel: An Impression of Shivaji Maharaj, Founder of the Maratha Empire |location=London |publisher=Collins |pages=121–125}}</ref> With this event, the Marathas transformed into a powerful military force, capturing more and more Adil Shahi and Mughal territories.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kincaid |first=Dennis |year=1937 |title=The Grand Rebel: An Impression of Shivaji, Founder of the Maratha Empire |location=London |publisher=Collins |pages=130–138}}</ref> Shivaji went on to neutralise Mughal power in the region.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uzOmy2y0Zh4C |chapter=Mogul Splendour: The successors of Akbar (1605–1707) |first=Jacques |last=Weber |editor-first=Claude |editor-last=Markovits |title=A History of Modern India, 1480-1950 |location=London |publisher=Anthem Press |year=2004 |origyear=1994 (Librarie Arthême Fayard, as ''L'Histoire de L'Inde Modern'')|isbn=9781843310044 |page=102|accessdate=30 September 2012}}</ref>

In 1659, Aurangzeb sent his trusted general and maternal uncle Shaista Khan, the [[Wali]] in Golconda to recover forts lost to the Maratha rebels. Shaista Khan drove into Maratha territory and took up residence in Pune. But in a daring raid on the governor's palace in Pune during a midnight wedding celebration, the Marathas killed Shaista Khan's son and maimed Shaista Khan by cutting off the fingers of his hand. Shaista Khan, however, survived and was re-appointed the administrator of Bengal going on to become a key commander in the war against the Ahoms.

[[File:SIVAJI OPENLY DEFIES THE GREAT MOGHUL.gif|thumb|left|A depiction of Shivaji in Aurangzeb's court in [[Agra]] in 1666.]]

Shivaji captured forts belonging to both Mughals and Bijapur. At last Aurangzeb ordered the armament of the [[Daulatabad, Maharashtra|Daulatabad Fort]] with two [[Bombard (weapon)|bombards]] (the Daulatabad Fort was later utilized as a Mughal bastion during the Deccan Wars). Aurangzeb also sent his general [[Jai Singh I|Raja Jai Singh]] of [[Amber, India|Amber]], a Hindu Rajput, to attack the Marathas. Jai Singh won the fort of Purandar after fierce battle in which the Maratha commander Murarbaji fell. Foreseeing defeat, Shivaji agreed for a truce and a meeting with Aurangjeb at Delhi. Jai Singh also promised Shivaji his safety, placing him under the care of his own son, the future Raja [[Ram Singh I]]. However, circumstances at the Mughal court were beyond the control of the Raja, and when Shivaji and his son Sambhaji went to Agra to meet Aurangzeb, they were placed under house arrest, from which they managed to effect a daring escape.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kincaid |first=Dennis |year=1937 |title=The Grand Rebel: An Impression of Shivaji, Founder of the Maratha Empire |location=London |publisher=Collins |page=197}}</ref>

When Maharaja Jaswant Singh of [[Jodhpur]] died in 1679, a conflict ensued over who would be the next Raja. Aurangzeb's choice of a nephew of the former Maharaja was not accepted by other members of Jaswant Singh's family and they rebelled, albeit in vain. Thereat, Aurangzeb seized control of Jodhpur. He also moved on [[Udaipur]], which was the only other state of [[Rajputana]] to support the rebellion. There was never a clear resolution to this conflict, although it is noted that the other Rajputs, including the [[Kachhwaha]] Rajput clan of Raja Jai Singh, the [[Bhatti]]s, and the [[Rathore]]s, remained loyal. On the other hand, Aurangzeb's third son [[Sultan Muhammad Akbar|Akbar]] left the Mughal court along with a few Muslim Mansabdar supporters and joined Muslim rebels in the Deccan. Aurangzeb in response moved his court to Aurangabad and took over command of the Deccan campaign. The rebels were defeated and Akbar fled south to the shelter of Sambhaji, Shivaji's successor. More battles ensued, and Akbar fled to [[Persia]] and never returned.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Great Moghuls |first1=Bamber |last1=Gascoigne |first2=Christina |last2=Gascoigne |authorlink1=Bamber Gascoigne |publisher=Cape |year=1971 |pages=228–229 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-ryFAAAAIAAJ}}</ref>

In 1689, Aurangzeb's forces captured Sambhaji. His successor [[Rajaram Chhatrapati|Rajaram]] and his Maratha forces fought individual battles against the forces of the Mughal Empire, and territory changed hands repeatedly during years of interminable warfare. As there was no central authority among the Marathas, Aurangzeb was forced to contest every inch of territory, at great cost in lives and money. Even as Aurangzeb drove west, deep into Maratha territory&nbsp;– notably conquering [[Satara]]&nbsp;— the Marathas expanded their attacks further into Mughal lands&nbsp;– [[Malwa]], [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]] and [[Gingee|Jinji]] in Tamil Nadu. Aurangzeb waged continuous war in the Deccan for more than two decades with no resolution.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Great Moghuls |first1=Bamber |last1=Gascoigne |first2=Christina |last2=Gascoigne |authorlink1=Bamber Gascoigne |publisher=Cape |year=1971 |pages=239–246 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-ryFAAAAIAAJ}}</ref> He thus lost about a fifth of his army fighting rebellions led by the Marathas in [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan India]].

Aurangzeb's shift from conventional warfare to anti-insurgency in the Deccan region shifted the paradigm of Mughal military thought. There were conflicts between Marathas and Mughals in [[Pune]], [[Gingee|Jinji]], [[Malwa]] and [[Vadodara]]. The Mughal Empire's port city of [[Surat]] was sacked twice by the Marathas during the reign of Aurangzeb and the valuable port was in ruins.<ref name="google7">{{cite book|title=A History of India|author1=Stein, B.|author2=Arnold, D.|date=2010|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9781444323511|url=http://books.google.com.pk/books?id=QY4zdTDwMAQC|page=181|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>

===Ahom campaign===
[[File:Aurangzeb in old age 2.jpg|thumb|Aurangzeb reading the [[Quran]].]]
While Aurangzeb and his brother Shah Shuja had been fighting against each other, the Hindu rulers of [[Kuch Behar]] and [[Assam]] took advantage of the disturbed conditions in the Mughal Empire, had invaded imperial dominions. For three years they were not attacked, but in 1660 [[Mir Jumla II]], the viceroy of Bengal, was ordered to recover the lost territories.<ref name="Jadunath Sarkar 1948">{{cite book |first1=R. C. |last1=Majumdar |first2=Jadunath |last2=Sarkar |title=History of Bengal |location=Dacca |year=1943–1948 |volume=II |page=364}}</ref>

The Mughals set out in November 1661, and within weeks occupied the capital of Kuch Behar after a few fierce skirmishes. The Kuch Behar was annexed, and the Mughal Army reorganized and began to retake their territories in Assam. Mir Jumla II's forces captured Pandu, [[Guwahati]], and Kajali practically unopposed. In February 1662, Mir Jumla II initiated the Siege of Simalugarh and after the Mughal [[cannon]] breached the fortifications, the Ahoms abandoned the fort and escaped. Mir Jumla II then proceeded towards Garhgaon the capital of the [[Ahom kingdom]], which was reached on 17 March 1662, although the ruler [[Raja]] [[Sutamla]] fled and the victorious Mughals captured 100 elephants, about 300,000 coins of silver, 8000 shields, 1000 ships, and 173 massive stores of rice.<ref name="Jadunath Sarkar 1948"/>

Later that year in December 1663, the aged Mir Jumla II died on his way back to [[Dacca]] of natural causes, but skirmishes continued between the Mughals and Ahoms after the rise of [[Chakradhwaj Singha]], who refused to pay further indemnity to the Mughals and during the wars that continued the Mughals suffered great hardships. Munnawar Khan emerged as a leading figure and is known to have supplied food to vulnerable Mughal forces in the region near Mathurapur. Although the Mughals under the command of Syed Firoz Khan the [[Faujdar]] at [[Guwahati]] were overrun by two Ahom armies in the year 1667, but they continued to hold and maintain presence along their the eastern territories even after the [[Battle of Saraighat]] in the year 1671.<ref>{{cite book |first1=R. C. |last1=Majumdar |first2=Jadunath |last2=Sarkar |title=History of Bengal |location=Dacca |year=1943–1948 |volume=II |page=378}}</ref>

The [[Battle of Saraighat]] was fought in 1671 between the Mughal empire (led by the Kachwaha king, Raja Ramsingh I), and the Ahom Kingdom (led by Lachit Borphukan) on the Brahmaputra river at Saraighat, now in Guwahati. Although much weaker, the Ahom Army defeated the Mughal Army by brilliant uses of the terrain, clever diplomatic negotiations to buy time, guerrilla tactics, psychological warfare, military intelligence and by exploiting the sole weakness of the Mughal forces—its navy.

The Battle of Saraighat was the last battle in the last major attempt by the Mughals to extend their empire into Assam. Though the Mughals managed to regain Guwahati briefly after a later Borphukan deserted it, the Ahoms wrested control in the Battle of Itakhuli in 1682 and maintained it till the end of their rule.<ref>Sarkar, J.

Aurangzeb responded by organizing a [[Army of the Mughal Empire|Mughal army]] of 10,000 troops and artillery, and dispatched detachments of his own personal Mughal imperial guards to carry out several tasks. In order to boost Mughal morale, Aurangzeb wrote Islamic prayers, made [[amulet]]s, and drew designs that would become emblems in the Mughal Army.

[[File:Zafarnama.jpg|thumb|[[Zafarnamah|Zafarnama]] is the name given to the letter sent by the tenth Sikh Guru, [[Guru Gobind Singh]] in 1705 to Aurangzeb. The letter is written in Persian script.]]

Early in Aurangzeb's reign, various insurgent groups of Sikhs engaged Mughal troops in increasingly bloody battles. The ninth Sikh Guru, [[Guru Tegh Bahadur]], like his predecessors was opposed to conversion of the local population as he considered it wrong. Approached by [[Kashmiri Pandit]]s to help them retain their faith and avoid [[forced conversion|forced religious conversions]], Guru Tegh Bahadur took on Aurangzeb. The emperor perceived the rising popularity of the Guru as a threat to his sovereignty and in 1670 had him executed,<ref>{{cite book |title=Converted Kashmir: Memorial of Mistakes |first=Narender |last=Sehgal |location=Delhi |publisher=Utpal Publications |year=1994 |url=http://www.kashmir-information.com/ConvertedKashmir/Chapter14.html |isbn=9788185217062}}{{dead link|date=October 2015}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2012}} which infuriated the Sikhs. In response, Guru Tegh Bahadur's son and successor, [[Guru Gobind Singh]], further militarized his followers, starting with the establishment of [[Khalsa]] in 1699, eight years before Aurangzeb's death.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} In 1705, Guru Gobind Singh sent a letter entitled ''[[Zafarnamah]]'' to Aurangzeb.

===Pashtun rebellion===
[[File:The Emperor Aurangzeb on Horseback ca. 1690–1710 The Cleveland Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|left|Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb on horseback.]]

The Pashtun revolt in 1672 under the leadership of the warrior poet [[Khushal Khan Khattak]] of [[Kabul]], was triggered when soldiers under the orders of the Mughal Governor Amir Khan allegedly molested women of the [[Pashtun tribes]] in modern-day [[Kunar Province]] of [[Afghanistan]]. The Safi tribes retaliated against the soldiers. This attack provoked a reprisal, which triggered a general revolt of most of tribes. Attempting to reassert his authority, Amir Khan led a large Mughal Army to the [[Khyber Pass]], where the army was surrounded by tribesmen and routed, with only four men, including the Governor, managing to escape.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

After that the revolt spread, with the Mughals suffering a near total collapse of their authority in the Pashtun belt. The closure of the important [[Attock]]-[[Kabul]] trade route along the [[Grand Trunk road]] was particularly disastrous. By 1674, the situation had deteriorated to a point where Aurangzeb camped at Attock to personally take charge. Switching to diplomacy and bribery along with force of arms, the Mughals eventually split the rebels and partially suppressed the revolt, although they never managed to wield effective authority outside the main trade route.

By 1689, almost all of [[Southern India]] was a part of the Mughal Empire and after the conquest of Golconda, Aurangzeb may have been the richest and most powerful man alive.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} Mughal victories in the south expanded the Mughal Empire to 3.2&nbsp;million square kilometres, with a population estimated as being between 100&nbsp;million and 150&nbsp;million.

Aurangzeb's vast imperial campaigns against rebellion-affected areas of the Mughal Empire caused his opponents to exaggerate the "importance" of their rebellions. The results of his campaigns were made worse by the incompetence of his regional Nawabs.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Muslim views regarding Aurangzeb vary. Most Muslim historians believe that Aurangzeb was the last powerful ruler of an empire inevitably on the verge of decline. The major rebellions organized by the Sikhs and the Marathas had deep roots in the remote regions of the Mughal Empire.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Unlike his predecessors, Aurangzeb considered the royal treasury to be held in trust for the citizens of his empire. He made caps and copied the Quran to earn money for his use. Aurangzeb constructed a small marble mosque known as the [[Moti Masjid (Delhi)|Moti Masjid]] (Pearl Mosque) in the [[Red Fort]] complex in Delhi. However, his constant warfare, especially with the Marathas, drove his empire to the brink of bankruptcy just as much as the wasteful personal spending and opulence of his predecessors.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} Aurangzeb knew he would not return to the throne after his final campaign against the Marathas in 1706, in which he was joined by newly emerging commanders in the Mughal army such as [[Sayyid Brothers|Syed Hassan Ali Khan Barha]], [[Saadat Ali Khan I|Saadat Ali Khan]] and [[Qamar-ud-din Khan, Asaf Jah I|Asaf Jah I]], and Daud Khan.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

{{quote|the conquest of the Deccan, to which Aurangzeb devoted the last 26 years of his life, was in many ways a Pyrrhic victory, costing an estimated hundred thousand lives a year during its last decade of futile chess game warfare. The expense in gold and rupees can hardly be accurately estimated.

Even when ill and dying, Aurangzeb made sure that the populace knew he was still alive, for if they had thought otherwise then the turmoil of another war of succession was likely.<ref>{{cite book |title=Civilization and Capitalism: 15th-18th Century: The Perspective of the World |volume=III |first=Fernand |last=Braudel |authorlink=Fernand Braudel |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley & Los Angeles |year=1992 |origyear=1979 (Paris: Librairie Armand Colin: ''Le Temps du Monde'') |isbn=9780520081161 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xMZI2QEer9QC&pg=PA514 |page=514 |accessdate=30 September 2012}}</ref> He died in Ahmednagar on 20 February 1707 at the age of 88, having outlived many of his children. His modest open-air grave in [[Khuldabad]] expresses his deep devotion to his Islamic beliefs. It is sited in the courtyard of the shrine of the Sufi saint Shaikh Burhan-u'd-din Gharib, who was a disciple of [[Nizamuddin Auliya]] of Delhi.

Brown writes that after his death, "a string of weak emperors, wars of succession, and coups by noblemen heralded the irrevocable weakening of Mughal power". She notes that the populist but "fairly old-fashioned" explanation for the decline is that there was a reaction to Aurangzeb's oppression.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Katherine Butler |last=Brown |date=January 2007 |title=Did Aurangzeb Ban Music?

Immediately after Bahadur Shah occupied the throne, the Maratha Empire&nbsp;– which Aurangzeb had held at bay, inflicting high human and monetary costs even on his own empire – consolidated and launched effective invasions of Mughal territory, seizing power from the weak emperor.
