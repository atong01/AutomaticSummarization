No ship in the 15th century could have carried enough food and fresh water for such a long voyage, and the dangers involved in navigating through the uncharted ocean would have been formidable.

Veneration of Columbus in America dates back to colonial times. The name<space/><link><target>Columbia (name)</target><part>Columbia</part></link><space/>for &quot;America&quot; first appeared in a 1738 weekly publication of the debates of the British Parliament.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/ilej/image1.pl?item=page&amp;amp;seq=5&amp;amp;size=1&amp;amp;id=gm.1738.6.x.8.x.x.285a'>''The Gentleman's Magazine'', Vol. 8, June 1738, p. 285</link>.</extension><space/>The use of Columbus as a founding figure of New World nations and the use of the word &quot;Columbia&quot;, or simply the name &quot;Columbus&quot;, spread rapidly after the American Revolution. Columbus' name was given to the federal capital of the United States (<link><target>Washington, D.C.</target><part>District of Columbia</part></link>), the<space/><link><target>capital city</target><part>capital cities</part></link><space/>of two U.S.<space/><link><target>State (United States)</target><part>states</part></link><space/>(<link><target>Ohio</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>South Carolina</target></link>), and the<space/><link><target>Columbia River</target></link>.

Numerous cities, towns, counties, streets, and plazas (called Plaza Coln or Plaza de Coln throughout Latin America and Spain) have been named after him. A candidate for sainthood in the Catholic Church in 1866, celebration of Columbus' legacy perhaps reached a zenith in 1892 with the 400th anniversary of his first arrival in the Americas.

Upon his recovery, Columbus organized his troops' efforts, forming a squadron of several hundred heavily armed men and more than twenty attack dogs.
