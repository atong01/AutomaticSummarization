Ada&amp;nbsp;95 added support for<space/><link><target>object-oriented programming</target></link>, including<space/><link><target>dynamic dispatch</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>The syntax of Ada minimizes choices of ways to perform basic operations, and prefers English keywords (such as &quot;or else&quot; and &quot;and then&quot;) to symbols (such as &quot;||&quot; and &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;). Ada uses the basic arithmetical operators &quot;+&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, and &quot;/&quot;, but avoids using other symbols. Code blocks are delimited by words such as &quot;declare&quot;, &quot;begin&quot;, and &quot;end&quot;, where the &quot;end&quot; (in most cases) is followed by the identifier of the block it closes (e.g.,<space/><italics>if end if</italics>,<space/><italics>loop end loop</italics>). In the case of conditional blocks this avoids a<space/><italics><link><target>dangling else</target></link></italics><space/>that could pair with the wrong nested if-expression in other languages like C or Java.</paragraph><paragraph>Ada is designed for development of very large software systems. Ada packages can be compiled separately. Ada package specifications (the package interface) can also be compiled separately without the implementation to check for consistency. This makes it possible to detect problems early during the design phase, before implementation starts.</paragraph><paragraph>A large number of compile-time checks are supported to help avoid bugs that would not be detectable until run-time in some other languages or would require explicit checks to be added to the source code. For example, the syntax requires explicitly named closing of blocks to prevent errors due to mismatched end tokens. The adherence to strong typing allows detection of many common software errors (wrong parameters, range violations, invalid references, mismatched types, etc.) either during compile-time, or otherwise during run-time. As concurrency is part of the language specification, the compiler can in some cases detect potential deadlocks. Compilers also commonly check for misspelled identifiers, visibility of packages, redundant declarations, etc. and can provide warnings and useful suggestions on how to fix the error.</paragraph><paragraph>Ada also supports run-time checks to protect against access to unallocated memory,<space/><link><target>buffer overflow</target></link><space/>errors, range violations,<space/><link><target>off-by-one error</target><trail>s</trail></link>, array access errors, and other detectable bugs. These checks can be disabled in the interest of runtime efficiency, but can often be compiled efficiently. It also includes facilities to help program verification. For these reasons, Ada is widely used in critical systems, where any<space/><link><target>anomaly in software</target><part>anomaly</part></link><space/>might lead to very serious consequences, e.g., accidental death, injury or severe financial loss. Examples of systems where Ada is used include<space/><link><target>avionics</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Air traffic control</target><part>ATC</part></link>, railways, banking, military and space technology.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="title">Ada helps churn out less-buggy code</arg><arg name="url">http://gcn.com/Articles/1999/06/30/Ada-helps-churn-out-lessbuggy-code.aspx</arg><arg name="publisher">Government Computer News</arg><arg name="accessdate">2010-09-14</arg><arg name="author">S.

Ada does not have generic or untyped<space/><link><target>pointer (computer programming)</target><part>pointers</part></link>; nor does it implicitly declare any pointer type. Instead, all dynamic memory allocation and deallocation must take place through explicitly declared<space/><italics>access types</italics>.Each access type has an associated<space/><italics>storage pool</italics><space/>that handles the low-level details of memory management; the programmer can either use the default storage pool or define new ones (this is particularly relevant for<space/><link><target>Non-Uniform Memory Access</target></link>). It is even possible to declare several different access types that all designate the same type but use different storage pools.Also, the language provides for<space/><italics>accessibility checks</italics>, both at compile time and at run time, that ensures that an<space/><italics>access value</italics><space/>cannot outlive the type of the object it points to.</paragraph><paragraph>Though the semantics of the language allow automatic<space/><link><target>garbage collection (computer science)</target><part>garbage collection</part></link><space/>of inaccessible objects, most implementations do not support it by default, as it would cause unpredictable behaviour in real-time systems. Ada does support a limited form of<space/><link><target>region-based memory management</target></link>; also, creative use of storage pools can provide for a limited form of automatic garbage collection, since destroying a storage pool also destroys all the objects in the pool.</paragraph><paragraph>Ada was designed to resemble the English language in its syntax for<space/><link><target>Comment (computer programming)</target><part>comments</part></link>: a double-<link><target>dash</target></link><space/>(&quot;--&quot;), resembling an<space/><link><target>em dash</target></link>, denotes comment text. Comments stop at end of line, so there is no danger of unclosed comments accidentally voiding whole sections of source code. Prefixing each line (or column) with &quot;--&quot; will skip all that code, while being clearly denoted as a column of repeated &quot;--&quot; down the page. There is no limit to the nesting of comments, thereby allowing prior code, with commented-out sections, to be commented-out as even larger sections. All<space/><link><target>Unicode</target></link><space/>characters are allowed in comments, such as for symbolic formulas (E[0]=mc). To the compiler, the double-dash is treated as end-of-line, allowing continued parsing of the language as a<space/><link><target>context-free grammar</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>The semicolon (&quot;;&quot;) is a<space/><link><target>statement terminator</target></link>, and the null or no-operation statement is<space/><xhtml:code>null;</xhtml:code>. A single<space/><xhtml:code><list type='def'><listitem><defkey></defkey></listitem></list></xhtml:code><space/>without a statement to terminate is not allowed.</paragraph><paragraph>Unlike most<space/><link><target>International Organization for Standardization</target><part>ISO</part></link><space/>standards, the Ada language definition (known as the<space/><italics>Ada Reference Manual</italics><space/>or<space/><italics>ARM</italics>, or sometimes the<space/><italics>Language Reference Manual</italics><space/>or<space/><italics>LRM</italics>) is<space/><link><target>free content</target></link>. Thus, it is a common reference for Ada programmers and not just programmers implementing Ada compilers. Apart from the reference manual, there is also an extensive rationale document which explains the language design and the use of various language constructs. This document is also widely used by programmers. When the language was revised, a new rationale document was written.</paragraph><paragraph>One notable<space/><link><target>free software</target></link><space/>tool that is used by many Ada programmers to aid them in writing Ada source code is the<space/><link><target>GNAT Programming Studio</target></link>.</paragraph><heading level='2'>History</heading><paragraph>In the 1970s, the<space/><link><target>United States Department of Defense</target><part>US Department of Defense</part></link><space/>(DoD) was concerned by the number of different programming languages being used for its embedded computer system projects, many of which were obsolete or hardware-dependent, and none of which supported safe modular programming. In 1975, a<space/><link><target>working group</target></link>, the<space/><link><target>High Order Language Working Group</target></link><space/>(HOLWG), was formed with the intent to reduce this number by finding or creating a programming language generally suitable for the department's and UK Ministry of Defence requirements. After many iterations beginning with an original<space/><link><target>Straw man proposal</target></link><space/>the eventual programming language was named Ada. The total number of high-level programming languages in use for such projects fell from over 450 in 1983 to 37 by 1996.</paragraph><paragraph><template><target>Wikisource</target><arg>Steelman language requirements</arg></template><space/>The HOLWG working group crafted the<space/><link><target>Steelman language requirements</target></link>, a series of documents stating the requirements they felt a programming language should satisfy.

In April 1978, after public scrutiny, the Red and Green proposals passed to the next phase. In May 1979, the Green proposal, designed by Jean Ichbiah at CII Honeywell Bull, was chosen and given the name Adaafter<space/><link><target>Ada Lovelace</target><part>Augusta Ada, Countess of Lovelace</part></link>. This proposal was influenced by the programming language<space/><link><target>LIS programming language</target><part>LIS</part></link><space/>that Ichbiah and his group had developed in the 1970s.

This declaration in turn is not based on the internal representation of the type but on describing the goal which should be achieved. This allows the compiler to determine a suitable memory size for the type, and to check for violations of the type definition at compile time and run time (i.e., range violations, buffer overruns, type consistency, etc.). Ada supports numerical types defined by a range, modulo types, aggregate types (records and arrays), and enumeration types. Access types define a reference to an instance of a specified type; untyped pointers are not permitted.Special types provided by the language are task types and protected types.</paragraph><paragraph>For example, a date might be represented as:</paragraph><paragraph><extension extension_name='syntaxhighlight' lang="ada"><paragraph>type Day_type is range 1 .. 31;type Month_type is range 1 .. 12;type Year_type is range 1800 .. 2100;type Hours is mod 24;type Weekday is (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday);</paragraph><paragraph>type Date is</paragraph><preblock><preline><space/><space/>record</preline><preline><space/><space/><space/><space/>Day : Day_type;</preline><preline><space/><space/><space/><space/>Month : Month_type;</preline><preline><space/><space/><space/><space/>Year : Year_type;</preline><preline><space/><space/>end record;</preline></preblock></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Types can be refined by declaring subtypes:<extension extension_name='syntaxhighlight' lang="ada"><paragraph>subtype Working_Hours is Hours range 0 .. 12; -- at most 12 Hours to work a daysubtype Working_Day is Weekday range Monday ..

The fundamental concurrent unit in Ada is a<space/><italics>task</italics><space/>which is a built-in limited type. Tasks are specified in two parts the task declaration defines the task interface (similar to a type declaration), the task body specifies the implementation of the task.Depending on the implementation, Ada tasks are either mapped to operating system tasks or processes, or are scheduled internally by the Ada runtime.</paragraph><paragraph>Tasks can have entries for synchronisation (a form of<space/><link><target>message passing</target><part>synchronous message passing</part></link>). Task entries are declared in the task specification. Each task entry can have one or more<space/><italics>accept</italics><space/>statements within the task body. If the control flow of the task reaches an accept statement, the task is blocked until the corresponding entry is called by another task (similarly, a calling task is blocked until the called task reaches the corresponding accept statement). Task entries can have parameters similar to procedures, allowing tasks to synchronously exchange data. In conjunction with<space/><italics>select</italics><space/>statements it is possible to define<space/><italics>guards</italics><space/>on accept statements (similar to Dijkstra's<space/><link><target>guarded commands</target></link>).</paragraph><paragraph>Ada also offers<space/><italics><link><target>protected object</target><trail>s</trail></link></italics><space/>for<space/><link><target>mutual exclusion</target></link>. Protected objects are a<space/><link><target>Monitor (synchronization)</target><part>monitor-like</part></link><space/>construct, but use guards instead of conditional variables for signaling (similar to conditional critical regions). Protected objects combine the data encapsulation and safe mutual exclusion from monitors, and entry guards from conditional critical regions. The main advantage over classical monitors is that conditional variables are not required for signaling, avoiding potential deadlocks due to incorrect locking semantics. Like tasks, the protected object is a built-in limited type, and it also has a declaration part and a body.</paragraph><paragraph>A protected object consists of encapsulated private data (which can only be accessed from within the protected object), and procedures, functions and entries which are guaranteed to be mutually exclusive (with the only exception of functions, which are required to be side effect free and can therefore run concurrently with other functions). A task calling a protected object is blocked if another task is currently executing inside the same protected object, and released when this other task leaves the protected object. Blocked tasks are queued on the protected object ordered by time of arrival.</paragraph><paragraph>Protected object entries are similar to procedures, but additionally have<space/><italics>guards</italics>. If a guard evaluates to false, a calling task is blocked and added to the queue of that entry; now another task can be admitted to the protected object, as no task is currently executing inside the protected object. Guards are re-evaluated whenever a task leaves the protected object, as this is the only time when the evaluation of guards can have changed.</paragraph><paragraph>Calls to entries can be<space/><italics>requeued</italics><space/>to other entries with the same signature. A task that is requeued is blocked and added to the queue of the target entry; this means that the protected object is released and allows admission of another task.</paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><italics>select</italics><space/>statement in Ada can be used to implement non-blocking entry calls and accepts, non-deterministic selection of entries (also with guards), time-outs and aborts.</paragraph><paragraph>The following example illustrates some concepts of concurrent programming in Ada.<extension extension_name='syntaxhighlight' lang="ada"><paragraph>with Ada.Text_IO;
