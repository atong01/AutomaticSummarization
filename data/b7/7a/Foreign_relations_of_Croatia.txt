{{Politics of Croatia}}

'''[[Croatia|The Republic of Croatia]]''' is a sovereign state at the crossroads of [[Central Europe]], [[Southeast Europe]], and the [[Mediterranean]] that declared its independence from [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] on June 25, 1991. Croatia is a member of the [[European Union]] (EU), [[United Nations]] (UN), the [[Council of Europe]], [[NATO]], the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), [[Union for the Mediterranean]] as well as a number of many other international organizations. As of 2015, Croatia has established diplomatic relations with 174 countries.

The main objectives of Croatian foreign policy during the 1990s were gaining international recognition and joining the United Nations. After these objectives have been achieved by year 2000, two main goals became [[NATO]] and [[European Union|EU]] membership. Croatia fulfilled both of these goals, first in 2009, second in 2013. Current Croatian goals in foreign policy are: positioning within the EU institutions and in the region, cooperation with NATO partners and strengthening multilateral and bilateral cooperation.<ref>http://www.mvep.hr/hr/vanjska-politika</ref>

==History==
[[File:Croatia diplomatic relations.png|thumb|right|400px|Foreign relation of Croatia{{legend|#008000|diplomatic relations established}} {{legend|#00ff00|diplomatic recognition only}}]]

[[Croatia]]n [[foreign policy]] has focused on greater Euro-Atlantic integration, mainly entering the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]]. In order to gain access to European and [[Transatlantic relations|trans-Atlantic]] institutions, it has had to undo many negative effects of the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] and the [[Croatian War of Independence|war]] that ensued, and improve and maintain good relations with its neighbors.

Key issues over the last decade have been the implementation of the [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Accords]] and the [[Erdut Agreement]], nondiscriminatory facilitation of the return of [[refugee]]s and [[displaced person]]s from the 1991-95 war including property restitution for ethnic [[Serbs]], resolution of border disputes with [[Slovenia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]], and general [[Democracy|democratization]].

Croatia has had an uneven record in these areas between 1996 and 1999 during the [[right-wing]] [[Croatian Democratic Union|HDZ]] government, inhibiting its relations with the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]]. Improvement in these areas severely hindered the advance of Croatia's prospects for further Euro-Atlantic integration. Progress in the areas of Dayton, Erdut, and refugee returns were evident in 1998, but progress was slow and required intensive international engagement.

Croatia's unsatisfactory performance implementing broader [[Democratization|democratic reform]]s in 1998 raised questions about the ruling party's commitment to basic democratic principles and norms. Areas of concern included restrictions on [[freedom of speech]], one-party control of [[Public broadcasting|public TV and radio]], repression of independent media, unfair electoral regulations, a [[judiciary]] that is not fully independent, and lack of [[human rights|human]] and [[civil rights]] protection.

A [[centre-left]] [[coalition government]] was elected in early [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2000|2000]]. The [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia|SDP]]-led government slowly relinquished control over public media companies and did not interfere with freedom of speech and independent media, though it didn't complete the process of making [[Croatian Radiotelevision]] independent. Judiciary reforms remained a pending issue as well.

Major Croatian advances in foreign relations during this period have included:
* admittance into NATO's [[Partnership for Peace]] Programme in May 2000
* admittance into [[World Trade Organization]] in July 2000;
* signing a [[European Union Association Agreement|Stabilization and Association Agreement]] with the EU in October 2001
* becoming part of NATO's [[Membership Action Plan]] in May 2002
* becoming a member of the [[Central European Free Trade Agreement]] (CEFTA) in December 2002
* application for membership in the EU in February 2003
* full cooperation with the [[ICTY|Hague Tribunal]] and the beginning of accession negotiations with the EU in October 2005

The EU application was the last major international undertaking of the [[Cabinet of Ivica Račan II| Račan government]], which submitted a 7,000-page report in reply to the questionnaire by the [[European Commission]].

Foreign relations were severely affected by the government's hesitance and stalling of the extradition of Croatian general [[Janko Bobetko]] to the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY), and inability to take general [[Ante Gotovina]] into custody for questioning by the Court.

Refugee returns accelerated since 1999, reached a peak in 2000, but then slightly decreased in 2001 and 2002. The [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] mission in Croatia has continued to monitor the return of refugees and is still recording civil rights violations. [[Serbs of Croatia|Croatian Serbs]] continue to have problems with restitution of property and acceptance to the reconstruction assistance programmes. Combined with lacking economic opportunities in the rural areas of [[Republic of Serbian Krajina|former Krajina]], the return process is highly troubled.

===Accession to the European Union===
{{main|2013 enlargement of the European Union}}
At the time of Croatia's application to the European Union, three EU members states were yet to ratify the Stabilization and Association Agreement: [[United Kingdom]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Italy]]. The new [[Cabinet of Ivo Sanader I|Sanader government]] elected in [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2003|2003 elections]] repeated the assurances that Croatia will fulfill the missing political obligations, and expedited the extradition of several ICTY inductees. The [[European Commission]] replied to the answers of the questionnaire sent to Croatia on April 20, 2004 with a positive opinion. The country was finally accepted as EU candidate in July 2004. Italy and United Kingdom ratified the Stabilization and Association Agreement shortly thereafter, while the ten EU member states that were admitted to membership that year ratified it all together at a 2004 European Summit. In December 2004, the EU leaders announced that accession negotiations with Croatia would start on March 17, 2005 provided that Croatian government cooperates fully with the ICTY. The main issue, the flight of general [[Ante Gotovina|Gotovina]], however, remained unsolved and despite the agreement on an accession negotiation framework, the negotiations did not begin in March 2005. On October 4, 2005 Croatia finally received green light for accession negotiations after the Chief Prosecutor of the ICTY [[Carla Del Ponte]] officially stated that Croatia is fully cooperating with the Tribunal. This has been the main condition demanded by EU foreign ministers for accession negotiations. The ICTY called upon other southern European states to follow Croatia's good example. Thanks to the consistent position of [[Austria]] during the meeting of EU foreign ministers, a long period of instability and the questioning of the determination of the Croatian government to extradite alleged war criminals has ended successfully. Croatian Prime minister [[Ivo Sanader]] declared that full cooperation with the Hague Tribunal will continue. The accession process was also complicated by the insistence of [[Slovenia]], an EU member state, that the [[Croatia–Slovenia border disputes|two countries' border issues]] be dealt with prior to Croatia's accession to the EU. 

Croatia finished accession negotiations on 30 June 2011,<ref name="eu" /> and on 9 December 2011, signed the [[Treaty of Accession 2011|Treaty of Accession]]. A [[Croatian European Union membership referendum, 2012|referendum on EU accession]] was held in Croatia on 22 January 2012, with 66% of participants voting in favour of joining the Union.<ref name="Dw-world.de">{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,6702424,00.html |title=Croats say 'yes' to EU membership &#124; Europe &#124; DW.DE &#124; 22.01.2012 |publisher=Dw-world.de |accessdate=3 April 2012}}</ref><ref name="referendum1">{{cite web|author=Independent Newspapers Online |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/world/croatia-sets-date-for-eu-referendum-1.1204088 |title=Croatia sets date for EU referendum |publisher=Iol.co.za |date=23 December 2011 |accessdate=3 April 2012}}</ref><ref name="referendum2">{{cite web|url=http://focus-fen.net/?id=n267023 |title=Croatian parliament calls EU referendum for January 22 |publisher=Focus-fen.net |accessdate=3 April 2012}}</ref><ref name="referendum3">{{cite web|url=http://daily.tportal.hr/166910/Parl-t-decides-that-EU-referendum-will-be-held-on-22-January.html |title=Parl't decides that EU referendum will be held on 22 January |publisher=Daily.tportal.hr |accessdate=3 April 2012}}</ref>  The ratification process was concluded on 21 June 2013, and entry into force and accession of Croatia to the EU took place on 1 July 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eu2011.hu/news/eu-summit-accession-treaty-croatia-be-signed-2011|title=EU Summit: Accession Treaty with Croatia to be signed in 2011|date=27 June 2011|publisher=eu2011.hu|accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref>

==Current events==

==Foreign support==
Croatia receives support from donor programs of:
* [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (EBRD)
* [[European Union]]
* [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]]
* [[International Monetary Fund]]
* [[USAID]]

Between 1991 and 2003, the EBRD had directly invested a total of 1,212,039,000 [[Euro|EUR]] into projects in Croatia.

In 1998, U.S. support to Croatia came through the Southeastern European Economic Development Program (SEED), whose funding in Croatia totaled $23.25 million. More than half of that money was used to fund programs encouraging sustainable returns of refugees and displaced persons. About one-third of the assistance was used for democratization efforts, and another 5% funded financial sector restructuring.

In 2003 USAID considered Croatia to be on a "glide path for graduation" along with [[Bulgaria]]. Its 2002/2003/2004 funding includes around $10 million for economic development, up to $5 million for the development of democratic institutions, about $5 million for the return of population affected by war and between 2 and 3 million dollars for the "mitigation of adverse social conditions and trends". A rising amount of funding is given to cross-cutting programs in anti-[[political corruption|corruption]], slightly under one million dollars.

The European Commission has proposed to assist Croatia's efforts to join the European Union with 245 million euros from [[PHARE]], [[Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-Accession|ISPA]] and [[SAPARD]] aid programs over the course of 2005 and 2006.

==International disputes==
Relations with neighbouring states have normalized somewhat since the breakup of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. Work has begun — bilaterally and within the [[Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe]] since 1999 — on political and economic cooperation in the region.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
[[File:Генерални конзулат Републике Хрватске у Бањалуци.jpg|thumb|Consulate-General in [[Banja Luka]]]]
{{main|Bosnia and Herzegovina–Croatia relations}}
Discussions continue between Croatia and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] on various sections of the border, the longest border with another country for each of these countries.

Sections of the [[Una (Sava)|Una]] river and villages at the base of Mount [[Plješevica]] are in Croatia, while some are in Bosnia, which causes an excessive number of border crossings on a single route and impedes any serious development in the region. The [[Zagreb]]-[[Bihać]]-[[Split (city)|Split]] railway line is still closed for major traffic due to this issue.

The border on the Una river between [[Hrvatska Kostajnica]] on the northern, Croatian side of the river, and [[Kostajnica, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosanska Kostajnica]] on the southern, Bosnian side, is also being discussed. A river island between the two towns is under Croatian control, but is also claimed by Bosnia. A shared border crossing point has been built and has been functioning since 2003, and is used without hindrance by either party.

The Herzegovinian [[municipality]] of [[Neum]] in the south makes the southernmost part of Croatia an [[exclave]] and the two countries are negotiating special transit rules through Neum to compensate for that. Recently Croatia has opted to build a [[Pelješac bridge|bridge to the Pelješac peninsula]] to connect the Croatian mainland with the exclave but Bosnia and Herzegovina has protested that the bridge will close its access to [[international waters]] (although Croatian territory and [[territorial waters]] surround Bosnian-Herzegovinian territory and waters completely) and has suggested that the bridge must be higher than 55 meters for free passage of all types of ships. Negotiations are still being held.

===Italy===
{{main|Croatia–Italy relations}}
The relations between Croatia and Italy have been largely cordial and friendly, although occasional incidents do arise on issues such as the [[Istrian exodus]] or the [[Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone]].

===Montenegro===
{{main|Croatia–Montenegro relations}}
Croatia and Montenegro have a largely latent border dispute over the [[Prevlaka]] peninsula.

===Serbia===
{{main|Croatia–Serbia relations}}
The [[Danube]] border between Croatia and [[Serbia]] is in dispute, particularly in [[Baranja]], the [[Island of Vukovar]] and the [[Island of Šarengrad]].

===Slovenia===
{{main|Croatia–Slovenia relations|Croatia–Slovenia border disputes}}
Croatia and [[Slovenia]] have several land and [[maritime boundary]] disputes, mainly in the [[Gulf of Piran]], regarding
Slovenian access to international waters, a small number of pockets of land on the right-hand side of the river [[Dragonja]],
and around the [[Sveta Gera]] peak.

Slovenia was disputing Croatia's claim to establish the [[Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone]], an economic section of the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]].

Other issues that have yet to be fully resolved include:
* Croatian depositors' savings in the former [[Ljubljanska banka]]
