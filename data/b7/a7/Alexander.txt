'''Alexander''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|ə|g|z|ˈ|æ|n|d|ər}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|ə|g|z|ˈ|ɑː|n|d|ər}}) is a common male first name, and less common [[Alexander (surname)|surname]] derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] "Αλέξανδρος" (Aléxandros). The most famous is [[Alexander the Great]], who created one of the largest empires in ancient history.

==Origin==
[[Etymology|Etymologically]], the name is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc-gre|Ἀλέξανδρος}} (Aléxandros), meaning "Defender of the people" or "Defending men"<ref>{{LSJ|a)le/candros|Ἀλέξανδρος|ref}}.</ref> and also, "Protector of men", a compound of the verb {{lang|grc|ἀλέξειν}} ''alexein'', "to ward off, to avert, to defend"<ref>{{LSJ|a)le/cw|ἀλέξειν|shortref}}.</ref> and the noun {{lang|grc|ἀνήρ}} ''anēr'', "man" (<small>[[Genitive|GEN]]</small> {{lang|grc|ἀνδρός}} ''andros'').<ref>{{LSJ|a)nh/r|ἀνήρ|shortref}}.</ref> It is an example of the widespread motif of Greek (or Indo-European more generally) names expressing "battle-prowess", in this case the ability to withstand or push back an enemy [[shield wall|battle line]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The earliest attested form of the name is the [[Mycenaean Greek]] feminine [[anthroponym]] {{lang|gmy|𐀀𐀩𐀏𐀭𐀅𐀨}}, ''a-re-ka-sa-da-ra'' (transcribed as ''[[Alexandra]]''), written in the [[Linear B]] syllabic script.<ref>Tablet [[Mycenae|MY]] V 659 (61). {{cite web|url=http://www.palaeolexicon.com/default.aspx?static=12&wid=217|title=The Linear B word a-re-ka-sa-da-ra|website=Palaeolexicon.

The name was one of the titles ("epithets") given to the Greek goddess [[Hera]] and as such is usually taken to mean "one who comes to save warriors". In the [[Iliad]], the character [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] is known also as Alexander.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0073%3Aentry%3D*%29ale%2Fcandros Ἀλέξανδρος],
Georg Autenrieth, ''A Homeric Dictionary'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref> The name's popularity was spread throughout the Greek world by the military conquests of [[Alexander the Great|King Alexander III, commonly known as "Alexander the Great"]]. Most later Alexanders in various countries were directly or indirectly named for him.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}}
