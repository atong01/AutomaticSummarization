In contrast, modern, quantum-mechanical atoms interact via electric and magnetic force fields and are far from inert.</paragraph><paragraph>The theory of the atomists appears to be more nearly aligned with that of modern science than any other theory of antiquity. However, the similarity with modern concepts of science can be confusing when trying to understand where the hypothesis came from. It is obvious that classical atomists would never have had a solid empirical basis for our modern concepts of atoms and molecules.<space/><link><target>Bertrand Russell</target></link><space/>states that they just hit on a lucky hypothesis, only recently confirmed by evidence.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Russell66">Russell, p. 66.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>However,<space/><link><target>Lucretius</target></link>, describing atomism in his<space/><italics><link><target>De rerum natura</target></link></italics>, gives very clear and compelling empirical arguments for the original atomist theory. He observes that any material is subject to irreversible decay. Through time, even hard rocks are slowly worn down by drops of water. Things have the tendency to get mixed up: mix water with soil and you get mud, that will usually not un-mix by itself. Wood decays. However, we see in nature and technology that there are mechanisms to recreate &quot;pure&quot; materials like water, air, and metals.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">July 2010</arg></template><space/>The seed of an oak will grow out into an oak tree, made of similar wood as historical oak trees, the wood of which has already decayed. The conclusion is that many properties of materials must derive from something inside, that will itself never decay, something that stores for eternity the same inherent, indivisible properties. The basic question is: why has everything in the world not yet decayed, and how can exactly the same materials, plants, animals be recreated again and again? One obvious solution to explain how indivisible properties can be conveyed in a way not easily visible to human senses, is to hypothesize the existence of &quot;atoms&quot;. These classical &quot;atoms&quot; are nearer to our modern concept of &quot;molecule&quot; than to the atoms of modern science. The other big point of classical atomism is that there must be a lot of open space between these &quot;atoms&quot;: the void. Lucretius gives reasonable arguments<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">July 2010</arg></template><space/>that the void is absolutely necessary to explain how gasses and liquids can change shape, flow, while metals can be molded, without changing the basic material properties.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Void hypothesis</heading><paragraph>The atomistic void hypothesis was a response to the paradoxes of<space/><link><target>Parmenides</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Zeno of Elea</target><part>Zeno</part></link>, the founders of metaphysical logic, who put forth difficult to answer arguments in favor of the idea that there can be no movement.

The &quot;bastard&quot; knowledge is concerned with the perception through the senses, therefore it is insufficient and subjective. The reason is that the sense-perception is due to the effluences of the atoms from the objects to the senses. When these different shapes of atoms come to us, they stimulate our senses according to their shape, and our sense-impressions arise from those stimulations.<extension extension_name='ref'><link><target>#Fr</target><part>Fr. 135</part></link><space/>(Bakalis (2005)):<space/><link><target>Theophrastus</target></link><space/>12,<space/><italics>De Sensu</italics><space/>[<italics>On the Senses</italics>], 4983.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>The second sort of knowledge, the &quot;legitimate&quot; one, can be achieved through the intellect, in other words, all the sense-data from the &quot;bastard&quot; must be elaborated through reasoning. In this way one can get away from the false perception of the &quot;bastard&quot; knowledge and grasp the truth through the inductive reasoning. After taking into account the sense-impressions, one can examine the causes of the appearances, draw conclusions about the laws that govern the appearances, and discover the<space/><link><target>causality</target></link><space/>(,<space/><italics>aetiologia</italics>) by which they are related. This is the procedure of thought from the parts to the whole or else from the apparent to non-apparent (inductive reasoning). This is one example of why Democritus is considered to be an early scientific thinker. The process is reminiscent of that by which science gathers its conclusions:</paragraph><paragraph><template><target>quote</target><arg>But in the Canons Democritus says there are two kinds of knowing, one through the senses and the other through the intellect. Of these he calls the one through the intellect 'legitimate' attesting its trustworthiness for the judgement of truth, and through the senses he names 'bastard' denying its inerrancy in the discrimination of what is true. To quote his actual words: Of knowledge there are two forms, one legitimate, one bastard. To the bastard belong all this group: sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch. The other is legitimate and separate from that. Then, preferring the legitimate to the bastard, he continues: When the bastard can no longer see any smaller, or hear, or smell, or taste, or perceive by touch, but finer matters have to be examined, then comes the legitimate, since it has a finer organ of perception.<ref>[[#Fr|Fr. 11]] (Bakalis (2005)): [[#Sextus|Sextus]] vii.138.</ref></arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>And:</paragraph><paragraph><template><target>quote</target><arg>In the Confirmations ... he says: But we in actuality grasp nothing for certain, but what shifts in accordance with the condition of the body and of the things (atoms) which enter it and press upon it.<ref>[[#Fr|Fr. 9]] (Bakalis (2005)): [[#Sextus|Sextus]] vii.136.</ref></arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>As well as:</paragraph><paragraph><template><target>quote</target><arg>Democritus used to say that 'he prefers to discover a causality rather than become a king of Persia'.<ref>[[#Fr|Fr. 118]] (Bakalis (2005))</ref></arg></template></paragraph><heading level='3'>Ethics and politics</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Bramante heracleitus and democritus.jpeg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>''Crying<space/><link><target>Heraclitus</target></link><space/>and laughing Democritus'', from a 1477 Italian fresco, Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan.</part></link>The ethics and politics of Democritus come to us mostly in the form of maxims.

Poverty in a democracy is better than prosperity under tyrants, for the same reason one is to prefer liberty over slavery. Those in power should &quot;take it upon themselves to lend to the poor and to aid them and to favor them, then is there pity and no isolation but companionship and mutual defense and concord among the citizens and other good things too many to catalogue.&quot; Money when used with sense leads to generosity and charity, while money used in folly leads to a common expense for the whole society excessive hoarding of money for one's children is avarice. While making money is not useless, he says, doing so as a result of wrongdoing is the &quot;worst of all things.&quot; He is on the whole ambivalent towards wealth, and values it much less than self-sufficiency. He disliked violence but was not a pacifist: he urged cities to be prepared for war, and believed that a society had the right to execute a criminal or enemy so long as this did not violate some law, treaty, or oath.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Barnes87"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Goodness, he believed, came more from practice and discipline than from innate human nature. He believed that one should distance oneself from the wicked, stating that such association increases disposition to vice. Anger, while difficult to control, must be mastered in order for one to be rational. Those who take pleasure from the disasters of their neighbors fail to understand that their fortunes are tied to the society in which they live, and they rob themselves of any joy of their own. Democritus believed that happiness was a property of the soul. He advocated a life of contentment with as little grief as possible, which he said could not be achieved through either idleness or preoccupation with worldly pleasures. Contentment would be gained, he said, through moderation and a measured life; to be content one must set their judgment on the possible and be satisfied with what one hasgiving little thought to envy or admiration. Democritus approved of extravagance on occasion, as he held that feasts and celebrations were necessary for joy and relaxation. He considers education to be the noblest of pursuits, but cautioned that learning without sense leads to error.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Barnes87"></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Mathematics</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Cone 3d.png</target><part>thumb</part><part>250px</part><part>right</part><part>Right circular and oblique circular cones</part></link>Democritus was also a pioneer of mathematics and geometry in particular.

They were driven together into societies for fear of wild animals, he said. He believed that these early people had no language, but that they gradually began to articulate their expressions, establishing symbols for every sort of object, and in this manner came to understand each other. He says that the earliest men lived laboriously, having none of the utilities of life; clothing, houses, fire, domestication, and farming were unknown to them. Democritus presents the early period of mankind as one of learning by trial and error, and says that each step slowly led to more discoveries; they took refuge in the caves in winter, stored fruits that could be preserved, and through reason and keenness of mind came to build upon each new idea.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Barnes87"></extension><extension extension_name='ref'><link><target>#DS</target><part>Diodorus</part></link><space/>I.viii.17.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Democritus held that the Earth was round (spherical), and stated that originally the universe was composed of nothing but tiny atoms churning in chaos, until they collided together to form larger unitsincluding the earth and everything on it.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Barnes87"></extension><space/>He surmised that<space/><link><target>Cosmic pluralism</target><part>there are many worlds</part></link>, some growing, some decaying; some with no sun or moon, some with several.
