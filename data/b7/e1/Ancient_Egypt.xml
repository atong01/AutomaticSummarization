Quote: &quot;First coined in 1881 by the French Egyptologist G. Maspero (1896), the somewhat misleading term &quot;Sea Peoples&quot; encompasses the ethnonyms Lukka, Sherden, Shekelesh, Teresh, Eqwesh, Denyen, Sikil / Tjekker, Weshesh, and Peleset (Philistines). [Footnote: The modern term &quot;Sea Peoples&quot; refers to peoples that appear in several New Kingdom Egyptian texts as originating from &quot;islands&quot; (tables 1-2; Adams and Cohen, this volume; see, e.g.,<space/><link><target>Robert Drews</target><part>Drews</part></link><space/>1993, 57 for a summary). The use of quotation marks in association with the term &quot;Sea Peoples&quot; in our title is intended to draw attention to the problematic nature of this commonly used term. It is noteworthy that the designation &quot;of the sea&quot; appears only in relation to the Sherden, Shekelesh, and Eqwesh. Subsequently, this term was applied somewhat indiscriminately to several additional ethnonyms, including the Philistines, who are portrayed in their earliest appearance as invaders from the north during the reigns of Merenptah and Ramesses Ill (see, e.g., Sandars 1978; Redford 1992, 243, n. 14; for a recent review of the primary and secondary literature, see Woudhuizen 2006). Hencefore the term Sea Peoples will appear without quotation marks.]&quot;</extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="Drews48"><link type='external' href='https://books.google.com/books?id=bFpK6aXEWN8C&amp;amp;pg=PA48&amp;amp;lpg=PA48'>The End of the Bronze Age: Changes in Warfare and the Catastrophe Ca. 1200 B.C., Robert Drews, p4861</link><space/>Quote: &quot;The thesis that a great &quot;migration of the Sea Peoples&quot; occurred ca. 1200 B.C. is supposedly based on Egyptian inscriptions, one from the reign of Merneptah and another from the reign of Ramesses III.
