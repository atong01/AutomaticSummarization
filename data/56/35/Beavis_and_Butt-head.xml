Their most common shared activity is watching music videos, which they tend to judge by deeming them &quot;cool,&quot; or by exclaiming, &quot;This sucks!&quot; (the latter is sometimes followed by the demand, &quot;Change it!&quot;). They also apply these judgments to other things that they encounter, and will usually deem something &quot;cool&quot; if it is associated with violence, sex, or the<space/><link><target>macabre</target></link>.
