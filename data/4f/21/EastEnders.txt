'''''EastEnders''''' is a British [[soap opera]]; the first episode was broadcast in the United Kingdom on [[BBC One]] on 19 February 1985. ''EastEnders'' storylines examine the domestic and professional lives of the people who live and work in the fictional [[Walford|London Borough of Walford]] in the [[East End of London]]. The series primarily centres on the residents of [[Albert Square]], a Victorian square of terraced houses, and its neighbouring streets, namely Bridge Street, Turpin Road and George Street. The area encompasses a pub, street market, night club, community centre, [[Funeral home|funeral parlour]], café, wine bar, various other small businesses, a park and allotments.

The series was originally screened as two half-hour episodes per week. Since August 2001, episodes are broadcast each weekday, apart from Wednesdays, on BBC One, and again on [[BBC Three]] at 10.00pm. An omnibus edition was broadcast at various times over the weekend, before being discontinued in April 2015.<ref>{{cite news|first=Paul |last=Millar |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a375759/eastenders-omnibus-moves-permanently-to-friday-nights.html |title='EastEnders Omnibus' moves permanently to Friday nights |work=Digital Spy |date=10 April 2012 |accessdate=10 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/9197702/EastEnders-Sunday-omnibus-axed-by-the-BBC.html|title= EastEnders Sunday omnibus axed by the BBC|newspaper= The Daily Telegraph|date= 11 April 2012|accessdate=11 April 2012|location=London}}</ref>

It is one of the UK's highest-rated programmes, often appearing near or at the top of the week's [[Broadcaster's Audience Research Board|BARB]] ratings. Within eight months of its launch, it reached the number-one spot in the ratings, and has consistently remained among the top-rated TV programmes in Britain. As of July 2013, the average audience share for an episode is around 30 percent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a502337/coronation-street-79m-watch-paul-and-lloyds-showdown.html|title='Coronation Street': 7.9m watch Paul and Lloyd's showdown|work=Digital Spy|accessdate=9 August 2015}}</ref> Created by producer [[Julia Smith]] and script editor [[Tony Holland]], ''EastEnders'' has remained a significant programme in terms of the BBC's success and audience share, and also in the history of British television drama, tackling many controversial and taboo issues in [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British culture]] and social life, previously unseen on United Kingdom mainstream television.<ref>Pamela Demory, Christopher Pullen (2013).

== Setting ==
[[File:The Queen Vic.jpg|right|thumb|[[The Queen Victoria|The Queen Victoria Public House]] (as it looked from November 1992 to September 2010) is the main focus point of Albert Square (''pictured'').]]
The central focus of ''EastEnders'' is the fictional [[Victorian era|Victorian]] square [[Albert Square]] in the fictional [[Walford|London Borough of Walford]]. Albert Square was built in the late 19th century, named after [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Albert]] (1819–1861), the husband of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] (1819–1901, reigned 1837–1901). Thus, central to Albert Square is [[The Queen Victoria|The Queen Victoria Public House]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/haveyoursay/yourquestions/yourq_content/yourq_queen_vic.shtml |title= What's the history of the Queen Vic? |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061220221434/http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/haveyoursay/yourquestions/yourq_content/yourq_queen_vic.shtml |archivedate=20 December 2006|publisher=BBC}}</ref>

Fans have tried to establish the actual location of Walford within London. [[Walford East tube station|Walford East]] is a fictional tube station for Walford, and with the aid of a map that was first seen on air in 1996, it has been established that Walford East is located between [[Bow Road tube station|Bow Road]] and [[West Ham tube station|West Ham]], which realistically would replace [[Bromley-by-Bow tube station|Bromley-by-Bow]] on the [[District line|District]] and [[Hammersmith & City line|Hammersmith & City]] lines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://underground-history.co.uk/walford.php |title=Underground EastEnders|publisher=Underground History|accessdate=4 November 2009}}</ref>

Walford has the [[postal district]] of E20. The postcode district was selected as if it were part of the actual [[E postcode area]] which covers much of east London although the next unused postcode district in the area was, and still is, E19.<ref>Royal Mail, ''Address Management Guide'', (2004)</ref> The ''E'' stands for ''Eastern''.<ref name=inner>HMSO, ''The Inner London Letter Post'', (1980)</ref> In 1917 the current postal districts in London were assigned alphabetically according to the name of the main [[sorting office]] for each district.<ref name=bpma>{{cite web|publisher=British Postal Museum and Archive |url=http://www.postalheritage.org.uk/history/downloads/BPMA_Info_Sheet_Postcodes_web.pdf |title=Archive Information Sheet: Postcodes |accessdate=5 July 2010 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090320052708/http://www.postalheritage.org.uk/history/downloads/BPMA_Info_Sheet_Postcodes_web.pdf |archivedate=20 March 2009 }}</ref> If Walford had been assigned in this scheme it would have been given E17, which is the current postcode district for [[Walthamstow]]. Fans have tried to pinpoint the location using this postcode, however, in reality London East postal districts stopped at E18 at that time; the show's creators opted for E20 instead of E19 as it was thought to sound better.<ref name="20years">{{Cite book| author=Smith, Rupert | title=EastEnders: 20 Years in Albert Square | publisher=BBC Books, BBC Worldwide Ltd | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-563-52165-5}}</ref> In March 2011, [[Royal Mail]] allocated the E20 postal district to the [[Olympic Park, London|2012 Olympic Park]].<ref name=bbcpostcode>{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-12789694|title=Olympic Park to share EastEnders'' Walford E20 postcode|accessdate=19 March 2011|date=19 March 2011}}</ref> In September 2011 the postal code for Albert Square was revealed in an episode as E20 6PQ.

An Albert Square exists in the [[East End of London]] in [[Ratcliff]], and a further such square exists just beyond the East End in [[Stratford, London|Stratford]], but the show's producers based the square's design on [[Fassett Square]] in [[Dalston]].<ref name="eehistory">{{cite web|url=http://www.hackney.gov.uk/xp-factsandfigures-placesfaces.htm|title=Interesting Places and Famous Faces|publisher=Hackney Borough Council|accessdate=13 December 2009}}</ref> There is also a market close to Fassett Square at [[Ridley Road Market|Ridley Road]]. The postcode for the area, [[London E8|E8]], was one of the working titles for the series. The name ''Walford'' is both a street in Dalston where Tony Holland lived and a [[Blend word|blend]] of [[Walthamstow]] and Stratford—the areas of Greater London where the creators were born.<ref name="20years"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/haveyoursay/yourquestions/yourq_content/yourq_street_names.shtml |title= How was the name Walford chosen?|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070405114814/http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/haveyoursay/yourquestions/yourq_content/yourq_street_names.shtml |archivedate=5 April 2007|publisher=BBC}}</ref> Other parts of the Square and set interiors are based on other locations. The bridge is based upon one near the [[BBC Television Centre]], the Queen Vic on the old pub at the end of Scrubs Lane/Harrow Road NW10, and the interior to the Fowlers' is based on a house in Manor Road, Colchester, close to where the supervising art director lived.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The fictional local newspaper, the ''Walford Gazette'', in which local news events such as the arrests or murders of characters appear, mirrors the area's own ''[[Hackney Gazette]]''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}<!--in-merger from [[The Walford Gazette]]-->

''EastEnders'' is built around the idea of relationships and strong families, with each character having a place in the community. This theme encompasses the whole Square, making the entire community a family of sorts, prey to upsets and conflict, but pulling together in times of trouble. Co-creator [[Tony Holland]] was from a large East End family, and such families have typified ''EastEnders''. The first central family was the combination of the [[Fowler family]], consisting of [[Pauline Fowler]], her husband [[Arthur Fowler]], and teenage children [[Mark Fowler]] and [[Michelle Fowler]] and the [[Beale family]], consisting of [[Pete Beale]] (Pauline's twin brother), his wife [[Kathy Beale]] and their teenage son [[Ian Beale]]. Pauline and Pete's mother was the domineering [[Lou Beale]], who lived with Pauline and her family. Holland drew on the names of his own family for the characters.<ref name="Insidestory">{{Cite book |last1=Smith |first1=Julia |authorlink=Julia Smith |author2=[[Tony Holland|Holland, Tony]] |title=[[EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books|EastEnders&nbsp;– The Inside Story]] |year=1987 |publisher=Book Club Associates |isbn=978-0-563-20601-9}}</ref>

The [[Watts family|Watts]] and [[Mitchell family|Mitchell]] families have been central to many notable ''EastEnders'' storylines, the show having been dominated by the Watts in the 1980s, with the 1990s focusing on the Mitchells. The early 2000s saw a shift in attention towards the newly introduced female Slater clan, before a renewal of emphasis upon the restored Watts family beginning in 2003. Since 2006, ''EastEnders'' has largely been dominated by the Mitchell and [[Branning family|Branning]] families, though the early 2010s also saw a renewed focus on the Moon family, and from 2013 onwards, on the [[Carter family (EastEnders)|Carters]]. The Beales are the show's longest running family, having been in ''EastEnders'' since it began in 1985. Key people involved in the production of ''EastEnders'' have stressed how important the idea of strong families is to the programme.<ref name="Insidestory"/> [[Peggy Mitchell]], in particular, is notorious for her ceaseless repetition of such statements as "You're a Mitchell!" and "It's all about family!". Pauline Fowler is also known for her insistence on family and mentioning her brother and husband to instil loyalty from family members. Her mother Lou Beale is renowned for her family meetings and traditional approach to family. More recently, [[Derek Branning]] regularly expresses the importance of a strong family unit. As the eldest sibling, he is constantly asserting his position as head of his family and reminding everyone to pull together in times of trouble. Additionally, Derek commonly refers to himself, [[Max Branning]] and [[Jack Branning]] as "the Branning brothers."

Some families feature a stereotypical East End [[matriarch]]. Indeed, the matriarchal role is one that has been seen in various reincarnations since the programme's inception, often depicted as the centre of the family unit.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite book|last= Smith|first= Rupert|title= [[EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books|''EastEnders: 20 years in Albert Square]] |year=2005|publisher=BBC books|isbn=978-0-563-52165-5}}</ref> The original matriarch was Lou Beale, though later examples include Pauline Fowler,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aiLdpt0zpg2E&refer=muse|title='EastEnders' Star Wendy Richard Dies of Cancer at 65 (Update1)|date=26 February 2009|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]|accessdate=19 January 2013}}</ref> [[Mo Harris]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/eastenders|title=EastEnders|last=Dougan|first=John|date=19 August 2002|work=PopMatters|accessdate=19 January 2013}}</ref> [[Pat Butcher]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/entertainment/eastenders-matriarch-for-xmas-exit-525722.html|title='Eastenders' matriarch for Xmas exit|date=25 October 2011|publisher=BreakingNews.ie|accessdate=19 January 2013}}</ref> Peggy Mitchell,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/ten/news/2009/0630/417869-eastenders/|title=Peggy's EastEnders nightmare returns|date=30 June 2009|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]]|accessdate=19 January 2013}}</ref> [[Zainab Masood]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2248900/Nina-Wadia-quits-EastEnders-years-playing-Zainab-Masood.html|title=Nina Wadia quits EastEnders after five years of playing Zainab Masood|last=Sanders|first=Louise|date=16 December 2012|work=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=18 January 2013|location=London}}</ref> [[Cora Cross]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walfordweb.co.uk/ww/spotlight/4108/exclusive-qa-bryan-kirkwood |title=Exclusive: Q&A with Bryan Kirkwood |date=20 June 2011 |publisher=Walford Web |accessdate=19 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120930053732/http://www.walfordweb.co.uk:80/ww/spotlight/4108/exclusive-qa-bryan-kirkwood |archivedate=30 September 2012 }} </ref> and to some extent [[Dot Branning]]. These characters are seen as being loud and interfering but most importantly, responsible for the well-being of the family and usually stressing the importance of family, reflecting on the past.

As is traditional in British soaps, female characters in general are central to the programme. These characters include strong, brassy, long-suffering women who exhibit [[diva]]-like behaviour and stoically battle through an array of tragedy and misfortune.<ref name="redpepper">{{cite web|url=http://www.redpepper.org.uk/cularch/xeastend.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061229113716/http://www.redpepper.org.uk/cularch/xeastend.html |archivedate=29 December 2006 |title=Square deal|publisher=Redpepper|accessdate=4 November 2009}}</ref> Such characters include [[Angie Watts]], [[Kathy Beale]], [[Sharon Rickman]], [[Pat Butcher]], [[Denise Fox]] and [[Tanya Cross]]. Conversely there are female characters who handle tragedy less well, depicted as eternal victims and endless sufferers, who include [[Sue Osman]], [[Little Mo Mitchell]], [[Laura Beale]], [[Lisa Fowler]], [[Ronnie Mitchell]] and [[Linda Carter]]. The '[[Hooker with a heart of gold|tart with a heart']] is another recurring character, often popular with viewers. Often their [[promiscuity]] masks a hidden [[vulnerability]] and a desire to be loved. Such characters have included [[Pat Butcher]] (though in her latter years, this changed), [[Tiffany Mitchell]], [[Kat Moon]], [[Stacey Branning]], [[Dawn Swann]] and [[Roxy Mitchell]].<ref name="Dowling">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4695877.stm|title=Will Kat's exit harm EastEnders?|last=Dowling|first=Stephen|date=19 July 2005|publisher=BBC|accessdate=31 January 2011}}</ref>

A gender balance in the show is maintained via the inclusion of various "macho" male personalities such as [[Mick Carter]], [[Phil Mitchell]], [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]], [[Jack Branning]] and [[Max Branning]], "bad boys" such as [[Den Watts]], [[Joey Branning]], [[Michael Moon (EastEnders)|Michael Moon]] and [[Vincent Hubbard]], and "heartthrobs" such as [[Simon Wicks]], [[Jamie Mitchell]] and [[Dennis Rickman]]. Another recurring male character type is the smartly dressed businessman, often involved in gang culture and crime and seen as a local authority figure. Examples include [[Derek Branning]], [[Steve Owen (EastEnders)|Steve Owen]], [[Jack Dalton (EastEnders)|Jack Dalton]], [[Andy Hunter (EastEnders)|Andy Hunter]] and [[Johnny Allen (EastEnders)|Johnny Allen]]. Following criticism aimed at the show's over-emphasis on '[[gangster]]s' in 2005, such characters have been significantly reduced.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/tv/2007/03/a_new_beginning_for_eastenders.html|title=A new beginning for EastEnders|first=Kate|last=Bevan|work=The Guardian |date=19 March 2007|accessdate=5 July 2010 | location=London}}</ref> Another recurring male character seen in ''EastEnders'' is the 'loser' or 'soft touch', males often comically under the thumb of their female counterparts, which have included [[Arthur Fowler]], [[Ricky Butcher]], [[Lofty Holloway]] and [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]].<ref name="20years"/> Other recurring character types that have appeared throughout the serial are "cheeky-chappies" [[Pete Beale]], [[Alfie Moon]], [[Garry Hobbs]] and [[Kush Kazemi]], "lost girls" such as [[Mary Smith (EastEnders)|Mary Smith]], [[Donna Ludlow]] and [[Mandy Salter]], [[juvenile delinquency|delinquents]] such as [[Stacey Branning]], [[Jay Brown|Jay Mitchell]] and [[Lola Pearce]], "villains" such as [[Nick Cotton]], [[Trevor Morgan (EastEnders)|Trevor Morgan]], [[May Wright]] and [[Yusef Khan]], "bitches" such as [[Cindy Beale]], [[Janine Butcher]], [[Lucy Beale]] and [[Abi Branning]] and cockney "[[wide boy]]s" or "[[Opportunism|wheeler dealers]]"<ref name="20years"/> such as [[Frank Butcher]], [[Alfie Moon]], [[Kevin Wicks]], [[Darren Miller]] and [[Fatboy (EastEnders)|Fatboy]].

[[File:Dot Lou Ethel ee.jpg|left|thumb|[[Dot Cotton]], [[Ethel Skinner]] and [[Lou Beale]] were Walford's original pensioners.]]
Over the years ''EastEnders'' has typically featured a number of elderly residents, who are used to show vulnerability, [[nostalgia]], stalwart-like attributes and are sometimes used for comedic purposes. The original elderly residents included Lou Beale, [[Ethel Skinner]] and [[Dot Branning|Dot Cotton]]. Over the years they have been joined by the likes of [[Mo Butcher]], [[Jules Tavernier (EastEnders)|Jules Tavernier]], [[Marge Green]], [[Nellie Ellis]], [[Jim Branning]], [[Patrick Trueman]], [[Cora Cross]], [[Rose Cotton (EastEnders)|Rose Cotton]], [[Stan Carter]] and [[Babe Smith]]. Focus on elderly characters has decreased since the show's inception. The programme has more recently included a higher number of teenagers and successful young adults in a bid to capture the younger television audience.<ref name="young">{{cite web|url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Students/hlr9501.html |title=Why are soap operas so popular? |first=Helena |last=Robson |publisher=aber.co.uk |date=15 November 1996 |accessdate=5 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100316142905/http://www.aber.ac.uk:80/media/Students/hlr9501.html |archivedate=16 March 2010 }}</ref><ref name="young2">{{Cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20060708/ai_n16529613|title=Young viewers switch from BBC to the internet|work=The Independent |publisher=Independent Print Media|accessdate=18 March 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071016200917/http%3A//www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20060708/ai_n16529613 |archivedate = 16 October 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> This has spurred criticism, most notably from the actress [[Anna Wing]], who played Lou Beale in the show.

''EastEnders'' has always featured a culturally diverse cast which has included [[black people|black]], Asian, [[Turkish people|Turkish]], Polish and Latvian characters. "The expansion of minority representation signals a move away from the traditional soap opera format, providing more opportunities for audience identification with the characters and hence a wider appeal".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/E/htmlE/eastenders/eastenders.htm |title=EastEnders |work=museum.tv |first=Danielle|last=Aron  |first2=Sonia|last2=Livingston |accessdate=5 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060412075647/http://www.cre.gov.uk/Default.aspx.LocID-0hgnew06m.RefLocID-0hg00900c008.Lang-EN.htm|url=http://www.cre.gov.uk/Default.aspx.LocID-0hgnew06m.RefLocID-0hg00900c008.Lang-EN.htm |archivedate=12 April 2006|title= Coronation Street and EastEnders battle it out for coveted CRE Race in the Media Award|publisher=cre.gov.uk|accessdate=27 March 2007}}</ref> Despite this, the programme has been criticised by the [[Commission for Racial Equality]], who argued in 2002 that ''EastEnders'' was not giving a realistic representation of the East End's "ethnic make-up". They suggested that the average proportion of visible minority faces on ''EastEnders'' was substantially lower than the actual ethnic minority population in East London boroughs, and it therefore reflected the East End in the 1960s, not the East End of the 2000s. Furthermore, it was suggested that an element of "[[tokenism]]" and [[stereotype|stereotyping]] surrounded many of these minority characters.<ref>"[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20020421/ai_n12842465 EastEnders hasn't got enough black and Asian actors]", ''Sunday Mirror''.

''EastEnders'' has been praised for its portrayal of characters with disabilities, including [[Adam Best (EastEnders)|Adam Best]] ([[spina bifida]]), [[Noah Chambers]] (deaf), [[Jean Slater]] and her daughter [[Stacey Slater|Stacey]] ([[bipolar disorder]]), [[Janet Mitchell]] ([[Down's syndrome]]), [[Jim Branning]] ([[stroke]]).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/news/091201-radar.shtml|title=Radar announce EastEnders as winners!|publisher=BBC|date=1 December 2009|accessdate=1 February 2010}}</ref>

The character of [[Nick Cotton]] gained a reputation for making constant exits and returns since the programme's first year, until the character's death in 2015.

Over ''EastEnders'' 30-year history, Sharon, [[Kathy Beale]] and [[Ian Beale]] are the only three original characters remaining in the soap, following Kathy's return from the dead during ''EastEnders'' 30th anniversary episode. Ian Beale is the only character to have appeared continuously from the first episode without officially leaving, and is the longest serving character in ''EastEnders''. Dot Cotton is the longest serving female character in the show having served since 1985, while Pat Butcher is the longest-serving former character, appearing from 1986 until early 2012.

Although episodes are predominantly recorded weeks before they are broadcast, occasionally, ''EastEnders'' includes current events in their episodes.

''EastEnders'' is often filmed on location, away from the studios in Borehamwood. Sometimes an entire quartet is filmed on location, which has a practical function and are the result of ''EastEnders'' making a "double bank", when an extra week's worth of episodes are recorded at the same time as the regular schedule, enabling the production of the programme to stop for a two-week break at Christmas.

=== Rebuilding the ''EastEnders'' set ===

Aside from this, soap opera staples of youthful romance, jealousy, domestic rivalry, gossip and extramarital affairs are regularly featured, with high-profile storylines occurring several times a year. [[Whodunit]]s also feature regularly, including the "[[Who Shot Phil?]]" storyline in 2001 that attracted over 19 million viewers and was one of the biggest successes in British soap television. Another whodunit is [[Who Killed Archie?|the murder of]] [[Archie Mitchell]] ([[Larry Lamb]]) who was killed on Christmas Day 2009 after making several enemies. The killer was revealed to be [[Stacey Branning]] in a special live episode of the show to mark its 25th anniversary; an episode which drew a peak of 17 million viewers.

== History ==
{{Main|History of EastEnders}}
The idea for a new soap opera on BBC1 was conceived in 1983, by BBC executives, principally David Reid, the then Head of Series & serials, who was keen for the BBC to produce a new evening soap opera. They gave the job of creating this new soap to script writer [[Tony Holland]] and producer [[Julia Smith]], famous for their work together on ''[[Z-Cars]]''. They created twenty-four original characters for the show, based upon Holland's own family, and people they remembered from their own experiences in the East End. [[Granada Television]] gave Smith unrestricted access to the ''Coronation Street'' production for a month so that she could get a sense how a continuing drama was produced.<ref>{{cite web | format=podcast

They cast actors for their characters, and began to film the show at [[Elstree Studios#The BBC period|BBC Elstree Centre]] in [[Borehamwood]], Hertfordshire. Alan Jeapes and [[Simon May]] created the title sequence and [[EastEnders theme tune|theme tune]], and the show with a working title of ''East 8'' was renamed ''EastEnders'', when Smith and Holland realised they had been phoning casting agencies for months asking whether they had "any real East Enders" on their books. Julia Smith thought "''Eastenders''" "looked ugly written down", and capitalised the second 'e', and thus the name ''EastEnders'' was born. Filming commenced in late-1984 and the show was first broadcast on 19 February 1985, and became wildly popular, often displacing ''Coronation Street'' from the top of the ratings for the rest of the 1980s.

== Scheduling ==

=== Broadcast ===
Since 1985, ''EastEnders'' has remained at the centre of BBC One's primetime schedule. It is currently broadcast at 7.30pm on Tuesday and Thursday, and 8pm on Monday and Friday. ''EastEnders'' was originally broadcast twice weekly at 7&nbsp;pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 19 February 1985, with an [[omnibus (broadcast)|omnibus]] at 3:30&nbsp;pm on Sundays; however, in August 1985 the two episodes were moved to 7:30&nbsp;pm as Michael Grade did not want the soap running in direct competition with ''Emmerdale Farm'', and this remained the same until 7 April 1994. The BBC had originally planned to take advantage of the 'summer break' that ''Emmerdale Farm'' usually took to capitalise on ratings, but ITV added extra episodes and repeats so that ''Emmerdale Farm'' was not taken off the air over the summer. Realising the futility of the situation, Grade decided to move the show to the later 7:30&nbsp;pm slot, but to avoid tabloid speculation that it was a 'panic move' on the BBC's behalf, they had to "dress up the presentation of that move in such a way as to protect the show" giving "all kinds of reasons" for the move.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

''EastEnders'' output then increased to three times a week on Mondays, Tuesday and Thursdays from 11 April 1994 until 2 August 2001.<ref name="edures">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/haveyoursay/howcani/howcani_content/howcani_0011.shtml |title= Educational resource (part one) |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070403175032/http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/haveyoursay/howcani/howcani_content/howcani_0011.shtml |archivedate=3 April 2007|publisher=BBC}}</ref>
From 10 August 2001, ''EastEnders'' then added its fourth episode (shown on Fridays).<ref name="edures"/> This caused some controversy as it clashed with ''Coronation Street'', which at the time was moved to 8pm to make way for an hour-long episode of rural soap ''Emmerdale'' at 7pm The move immediately provoked an angry response from ITV insiders, who argued that the BBC's last-minute move—only revealed at 3.30pm on the day—broke an unwritten scheduling rule that the two flagship soaps would not be put directly against each other. In this first head-to-head battle, ''EastEnders'' claimed victory over its rival.<ref>{{Cite news

In early 2003, viewers could watch episodes of ''EastEnders'' on digital channel [[BBC Three]] before they were broadcast on BBC One. This was to coincide with the relaunch of the channel and helped BBC Three break the one million viewers mark for the first time with 1.03 million who watched to see [[Mark Fowler]]'s departure.<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2003/feb/14/bbc.overnights|title = BBC3 breaks down the barriers|work=The Guardian |date = 14 February 2003|accessdate =16 July 2006| location=London| first=Jason| last=Deans}}</ref> EastEnders is now repeated each evening it is broadcast on BBC One at 22.30 on BBC Three&nbsp;– having previously been shown on that channel at 22.00.

In 1998, ''[[EastEnders Revealed]]'' was launched on [[BBC Choice]] (now BBC Three). The show takes a look behind the scenes of the ''EastEnders'' and investigates particular places, characters or families within ''EastEnders''. An episode of ''EastEnders Revealed'' that was commissioned for BBC Three attracted 611,000 viewers.

As part of the BBC's digital push, ''[[EastEnders Xtra]]'' was introduced in 2005. The show was presented by [[Angellica Bell]] and was available to digital viewers at 8.30pm on Monday nights. It was also shown after the Sunday omnibus. The series went behind the scenes of the show and spoke to some of the cast members. A new breed of behind-the-scenes programmes have been broadcast on BBC Three since 1 December 2006. These are all documentaries related to current storylines in ''EastEnders'', in a similar format to ''EastEnders Revealed'', though not using the ''EastEnders Revealed'' name.

In October 2009, a 12-part Internet spin-off series entitled ''[[EastEnders: E20]]'' was announced. The series was conceived by executive producer Diederick Santer "as a way of nurturing new, young talent, both on- and off-screen, and exploring the stories of the soaps' anonymous bystanders."<ref name=Rushton>{{Cite news|author= Rushton, Katherine|date= 22 October 2009|url= http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/multi-platform/web-drama-comes-of-age-with-eastenders-spin-off/5007149.article|title= Web drama comes of age with EastEnders spin-off|work= Broadcast|accessdate=22 October 2009}}</ref> ''E20'' features a group of sixth-form characters and targets the "''Hollyoaks'' demographic".

=== Ratings ===
{{Recentism|section|date=May 2011}}
''EastEnders'' proved highly popular and Appreciation Indexes reflected this, rising from 55–60 at the launch to 85–95 later on, a figure which was nearly ten points higher than the average for a British soap opera. Research suggested that people found the characters true to life, the plots believable and, importantly in the face of criticism of the content, people watched as a family and regarded it as viewing for all the family. Based on market research by BBC commissioning in 2003, ''EastEnders'' is most watched by 60- to 74-year-olds, closely followed by 45- to 59-year-olds.

=== Criticism ===
''EastEnders'' is the most complained about programme on the BBC.<ref name="Wadia bans children">{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1381341/EastEnders-Nina-Wadia-reveals-wont-let-kids-watch-adult-soap.html|title=EastEnder Nina Wadia admits she's banned her kids from watching her 'very adult' soap |last=Thomas|first=Liz|date=28 April 2011|work=Daily Mail |accessdate=28 April 2011|location=London}}</ref> It has received both praise and criticism for most of its storylines, which have dealt with difficult themes, such as violence, rape, murder and child abuse.

[[Mary Whitehouse]], English social critic, argued at the time that ''EastEnders'' represented a violation of "family viewing time" and that it undermined the [[watershed (television)|watershed]] policy. She regarded ''EastEnders'' as a fundamental assault on the family and morality itself. She made reference to representation of family life and emphasis on psychological and emotional violence within the show. She was also critical of language such as "bleeding", "bloody hell", "bastard" and "for Christ's sake". However, Whitehouse also praised the programme, describing [[Michelle Fowler]]'s decision not to have an abortion as a "very positive storyline". She also felt that ''EastEnders'' had been cleaned up as a result of her protests, though she later commented that ''EastEnders'' had returned to its old ways. Her criticisms were widely reported in the tabloid press as ammunition in its existing hostility towards the BBC. The stars of ''Coronation Street'' in particular aligned themselves with Mary Whitehouse, gaining headlines such as "STREETS AHEAD! RIVALS LASH SEEDY EASTENDERS" and "CLEAN UP SOAP! Street Star Bill Lashes 'Steamy' EastEnders".<ref>David Buckingham (1987). ''Public secrets: EastEnders and its audience''. p.129. [[British Film Institute]], 1987.</ref>

In 1997, several episodes were shot and set in Ireland, resulting in criticisms for portraying the Irish in a negatively stereotypical way. Ted Barrington, the Irish Ambassador to the UK at the time, described the portrayal of Ireland as an "unrepresentative caricature", stating he was worried by the negative stereotypes and the images of drunkenness, backwardness and isolation. [[Jana Bennett]], the BBC's then director of production, later apologised for the episodes, stating on BBC1's news bulletin: "It is clear that a significant number of viewers have been upset by the recent episodes of ''EastEnders'', and we are very sorry, because the production team and programme makers did not mean to cause any offence." A year later BBC chairman Christopher Bland admitted that as result of the Irish-set EastEnders episodes, the station failed in its pledge to represent all groups accurately and avoid reinforcing prejudice.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/172718.stm BBC sets out pledges], BBC News.

The long-running storyline of Mark Fowler's HIV was so successful in raising awareness that in 1999, a survey by the National Aids Trust found teenagers got most of their information about HIV from the soap, though one campaigner noted that in some ways the storyline was not reflective of what was happening at the time as the condition was more common among the [[gay community]]. Still, heterosexual Mark struggled with various issues connected to his HIV status, including public fears of contamination, a marriage breakdown connected to his inability to have children and the side effects of combination therapies. In 2002, when the makers of the series decided to write Mark out of the series as his disease became untreatable, he left Walford in 2003 to travel the world, and his death was announced a year later.<ref name="ko">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2580435.stm|title=EastEnders' Mark to be killed off|publisher=BBC|date=16 December 2002|accessdate=16 June 2011}}</ref>

''EastEnders'' is often criticised for being too violent, most notably during a [[domestic violence]] storyline between Little Mo Morgan and her husband Trevor. As ''EastEnders'' is shown pre-watershed, there were worries that some scenes in this storyline were too graphic for its audience. Complaints against a scene in which Little Mo's face was pushed in [[gravy]] on Christmas Day were upheld by the Broadcasting Standards Council. However, a helpline after this episode attracted over 2000 calls. [[Erin Pizzey]], who became internationally famous for having started one of the first [[Women's shelter|Women's Refuges]], said that ''EastEnders'' had done more to raise the issue of violence against women in one story than she had done in 25 years. The character of [[Phil Mitchell]] (played by [[Steve McFadden]] since early 1990) has been criticised on several occasions for glorifying violence and proving a bad role model to children. On one occasion following a scene in an episode broadcast in October 2002, where Phil brutally beat his godson, [[Jamie Mitchell]] (Jack Ryder), 31 complaints came from viewers who watched the scenes.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2712133.stm BBC rapped over EastEnders] BBC News, last asccessed on 31 January 2003</ref>

In 2008, the show was criticised for stereotyping their Asian and Black characters, by having a black single mum, [[Denise Wicks]], and an Asian shopkeeper, [[Zainab Masood]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a112057/report-brands-soaps-too-white.html |title=Report brands soaps 'too white' |work=[[Digital Spy]] |first=Alex |last=Fletcher |date=17 July 2008 |accessdate=4 November 2009}}</ref>

In 2010, ''EastEnders'' came under criticism from the police for the way that they were portrayed during the "[[Who Killed Archie?]]" storyline. During the storyline, [[Jill Marsden (EastEnders)|DCI Jill Marsden]] and [[Wayne Hughes (EastEnders)|DC Wayne Hughes]] talk to locals about the case and Hughes accepts a bribe. The police claimed that such scenes were "damaging" to their reputation and added that the character [[Deanne Cunningham|DC Deanne Cunningham]] was "irritatingly inaccurate". In response to the criticism, ''EastEnders'' apologised for offending real-life detectives and confirmed that they use a police consultant for such storylines.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/7288626/Detectives-claim-EastEnders-has-damaged-their-profession.html|title=Detectives claim EastEnders has 'damaged their profession'|last=Leach|first=Ben|date=22 February 2010|work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=22 February 2010 | location=London}}</ref> In July 2010, complaints were received following the storyline of Christian minister [[Lucas Johnson]] committing a number of murders that he believed was his duty to God, claiming that the storyline was offensive to Christians.<ref name="BBC defends">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a242230/bbc-defends-eastenders-lucas-storyline.html|title=BBC defends 'EastEnders' Lucas storyline|last=Love|first=Ryan|date=12 July 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=13 July 2010|location=London}}</ref>

Bridget Robb, acting chief of the BASW, said the storyline provoked "real anger among a profession well used to a less than accurate public and media perception of their jobs ..

In October 2014, the BBC defended a storyline, after receiving 278 complaints about the 6 October 2014 episode where pub landlady Linda Carter was raped.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29519061|title=BBC defends EastEnders rape storyline|publisher=BBC News|date=7 October 2014|accessdate=7 October 2014}}</ref>  On 17 November 2014 it was announced that [[Ofcom]] will investigate over the storyline.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-30080764|title=EastEnders investigated by Ofcom over rape storyline|publisher=BBC News|date=17 November 2014}}</ref> On 5 January 2015, the investigation was cleared by Ofcom. A spokesman of Ofcom said: "After carefully investigating complaints about this scene, Ofcom found the BBC took appropriate steps to limit offence to viewers. This included a warning before the episode and implying the assault, rather than depicting it. Ofcom also took into account the programme's role in presenting sometimes challenging or distressing social issues." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a619266/eastenders-dean-linda-rape-episode-cleared-by-ofcom.html#~p0wHiTe211DzIA|title=EastEnders: Dean, Linda rape episode cleared by Ofcom|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=5 January 2015|accessdate=5 January 2015}}</ref>
