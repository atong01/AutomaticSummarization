While both the Anglo-Saxons and the Danes attacked settlements to seize wealth and other resources, they employed very different strategies. In their raids, the Anglo-Saxons traditionally preferred to attack head-on by assembling their forces in a<space/><link><target>shield wall</target></link>, advancing against their target and overcoming the oncoming wall marshaled against them in defence.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Abels 1998 pages=1945"><template><target>harvnb</target><arg>Abels</arg><arg>1998</arg><arg name="pages">194–5</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>In contrast, the Danes preferred to choose easy targets, mapping cautious forays designed to avoid risking all their accumulated plunder with high-stake attacks for more.

It was the responsibility of the shire fyrd to deal with local raids. The king could call up the national militia to defend the kingdom; however, in the case of hit and run raids by Vikings, problems with communication and raising supplies meant that the national militia could not be mustered quickly enough: It was only after the raids were underway that a call went out to landowners to gather men for battle. Large regions could be devastated before the newly assembled fyrd arrived. And although the landowners were obliged to the king to supply these men when called, during the attacks in 878, many of them opportunistically abandoned their king and collaborated with Guthrum.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>harvnb</target><arg>Abels</arg><arg>1998</arg><arg name="pages">139, 152</arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="cannon398"><template><target>harvnb</target><arg>Cannon</arg><arg>1997</arg><arg name="page">398</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>With these lessons in mind, Alfred capitalised on the relatively peaceful years immediately following his victory at Edington by focusing on an ambitious restructuring of his kingdom's military defences. On a trip to Rome, Alfred had stayed with<space/><link><target>Charles the Bald</target></link><space/>and it is possible that he may have studied how the Carolingian kings had dealt with the Viking problem, and learning from their experience was able to put together a system of taxation and defence for his own kingdom. Also, there had been a system of fortifications in pre-Viking Mercia that may have been an influence. So when the Viking raids resumed in 892, Alfred was better prepared to confront them with a standing, mobile field army, a network of garrisons, and a small fleet of ships navigating the rivers and estuaries.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>harvnb</target><arg>Abels</arg><arg>1998</arg><arg name="page">194</arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="keynes14"><template><target>harvnb</target><arg>Keynes</arg><arg>Lapidge</arg><arg>1983</arg><arg name="page">14</arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="lavelle212"><template><target>harvnb</target><arg>Lavelle</arg><arg>2010</arg><arg name="page">212</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Administration and taxation</heading><paragraph>Tenants in Anglo-Saxon England had a threefold obligation based on their landholding; the so-called &quot;common burdens&quot; of military service, fortress work, and bridge repair.

The mercy that Christ infused into Mosaic Law underlies the injury tariffs that figure so prominently in barbarian law codes, since Christian synods &quot;established, through that mercy which Christ taught, that for almost every misdeed at the first offence secular lords might with their permission receive without sin the monetary compensation, which they then fixed.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="keynes"><italics>Alfred</italics>, Intro, 49.7, trans.<space/><template><target>harvnb</target><arg>Keynes</arg><arg>Lapidge</arg><arg>1983</arg></template><space/>pp. 1645</extension></paragraph><paragraph>The only crime that could not be compensated with a payment of money is treachery to a lord, &quot;since Almighty God adjudged none for those who despised Him, nor did Christ, the Son of God, adjudge any for the one who betrayed Him to death; and He commanded everyone to love his lord as Himself.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="keynes"></extension><space/>Alfred's transformation of Christ's commandment from &quot;Love your neighbour as yourself&quot; (Matt. 22:3940) to love your secular lord as you would love the Lord Christ himself underscores the importance that Alfred placed upon lordship, which he understood as a sacred bond instituted by God for the governance of man.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>harvnb</target><arg>Abels</arg><arg>1998</arg><arg name="p">250</arg></template><space/>cites<space/><italics>Alfred's Pastoral Care</italics>, ch. 28</extension></paragraph><paragraph>When one turns from the<space/><italics>domboc</italics>'s introduction to the laws themselves, it is difficult to uncover any logical arrangement.

It reflected Alfred's own belief in a doctrine of divine rewards and punishments rooted in a vision of a hierarchical Christian world order in which God is the Lord to whom kings owe obedience and through whom they derive their authority over their followers. The need to persuade his nobles to undertake work for the 'common good' led Alfred and his court scholars to strengthen and deepen the conception of Christian kingship that he had inherited by building upon the legacy of earlier kings such as Offa as well as clerical writers such as Bede, Alcuin and the other luminaries of the<space/><link><target>Carolingian renaissance</target></link>. This was not a cynical use of religion to manipulate his subjects into obedience, but an intrinsic element in Alfred's worldview. He believed, as did other kings in ninth-century England and Francia, that God had entrusted him with the spiritual as well as physical welfare of his people. If the Christian faith fell into ruin in his kingdom, if the clergy were too ignorant to understand the Latin words they butchered in their offices and liturgies, if the ancient monasteries and collegiate churches lay deserted out of indifference, he was answerable before God, as Josiah had been. Alfred's ultimate responsibility was the pastoral care of his people.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Abels</arg><arg>1998</arg><arg name="pp">219–257</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>Appearance and character</heading><paragraph><link><target>Asser</target></link><space/>wrote of Alfred in his<space/><italics><link><target>Asser</target><part>Life of King Alfred</part></link></italics>:<extension extension_name='blockquote'>&quot;Now, he was greatly loved, more than all his brothers, by his father and motherindeed, by everybodywith a universal and profound love, and he was always brought up in the royal court and nowhere else. ...

It is true, however, that Alfred was an excellent listener and had an incredible memory, and he retained poetry and psalms very well. A story is told by Asser about how his mother held up a book of Saxon poetry to him and his brothers, and said; 'I shall give this book to whichever one of you can learn it the fastest.' After excitedly asking, 'Will you really give this book to the one of us who can understand it the soonest and recite it to you?'

Asser writes that &quot;[Alfred] could not satisfy his craving for what he desired the most, namely the liberal arts; for, as he used to say, there were no good scholars in the entire kingdom of the West Saxons at that time.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="Keynes, Simon 1983.
