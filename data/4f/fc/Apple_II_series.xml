The<space/><link><target>Group Code Recording</target></link><space/>used by the controller was simpler and easier to implement in software than the more common<space/><link><target>Modified Frequency Modulation</target><part>MFM</part></link>. In the end, the low chip count of the controller helped make Apple's Disk II the first affordable floppy drive for personal computers. As a side effect, Wozniak's scheme made it easy for<space/><link><target>proprietary software</target></link><space/>developers to<space/><link><target>copy protection</target><part>copy-protect</part></link><space/>the media on which their software shipped by changing the low-level sector format or stepping the drive's head between the tracks; inevitably, other companies eventually sold software to foil this protection. Another Wozniak optimization allowed him to omit Shugart's Track-0 sensor. When the Operating System wants to go to track 0, the controller simply moves 40 times toward the next-lower-numbered track, relying on the mechanical stop to prevent it going any further down than track 0. This process, called &quot;recalibration&quot;, made a loud buzzing (rapid mechanical chattering) sound that often frightened Apple novices.</paragraph><paragraph>The approach taken in the Disk II controller was typical of Wozniak's design sensibility. The Apple II used several engineering shortcuts to save hardware and reduce costs. For example, taking advantage of the way that 6502 instructions only access memory every other clock cycle, the video generation circuitry's memory access on the otherwise unused cycles avoided memory contention issues and also eliminated the need for a separate refresh circuit for the DRAM chips. Rather than use a complex analog-to-digital circuit to read the outputs of the game controller, Wozniak used a simple timer circuit whose period was proportional to the resistance of the game controller, and used a software loop to measure the timer.</paragraph><paragraph>The text and graphics screens had a complex arrangement (the scanlines were not stored in sequential areas of memory) which was reputedly due to Wozniak's realization that doing it that way would save a chip; it was less expensive to have software calculate or look up the address of the required scanline than to include the extra hardware. Similarly, in the high-resolution graphics mode, color was determined by pixel position and could thus be implemented in software, saving Wozniak the chips needed to convert bit patterns to colors. This also allowed for sub-pixel<space/><link><target>font</target></link><space/>rendering since orange and blue pixels appeared half a pixel-width further to the right on the screen than green and purple pixels.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="last">Gibson<space/></arg><arg name="first">Steve</arg><arg name="title">The origins of sub-pixel font rendering</arg><arg name="url">http://www.grc.com/ctwho.htm</arg><arg name="accessdate">August 4, 2006</arg><arg name="archiveurl"><space/>http://web.archive.org/web/20060721130149/http://www.grc.com/ctwho.htm</arg><arg name="archivedate"><space/>July 21, 2006<space/></arg><arg name="deadurl"><space/>no</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Color on the Apple II series took advantage of a quirk of the<space/><link><target>National Television System Committee</target><part>NTSC</part></link><space/>television signal standard, which made color display relatively easy and inexpensive to implement. The original NTSC television signal specification was black-and-white. Color was tacked on later by adding a 3.58-MHz subcarrier signal that was partially ignored by B&amp;W TV sets. Color is encoded based on the<space/><italics><link><target>phase (waves)</target><part>phase</part></link></italics><space/>of this signal in relation to a reference<space/><italics><link><target>color burst</target></link></italics><space/>signal. The result is that the position, size, and intensity of a series of pulses define color information. These pulses can translate into<space/><italics><link><target>pixel</target><trail>s</trail></link></italics><space/>on the computer screen.</paragraph><paragraph>The Apple II display provided two pixels per subcarrier cycle. When the color burst reference signal was turned on and the computer attached to a color display, it could display green by showing one alternating pattern of pixels, magenta with an opposite pattern of alternating pixels, and white by placing two pixels next to each other. Later, blue and orange became available by tweaking the offset of the pixels by half a pixel-width in relation to the colorburst signal. The high-resolution display offered more colors simply by compressing more, narrower pixels into each subcarrier cycle. The coarse, low-resolution graphics display mode worked differently, as it could output a short burst of high-frequency signal per pixel to offer more color options.</paragraph><paragraph>The epitome<template><target>by whom</target><arg name="date">October 2012</arg></template><space/>of the Apple II design philosophy was the Apple II sound circuitry. Rather than having a dedicated sound-synthesis chip, the Apple II had a toggle circuit that could only emit a click through a built-in speaker or a line out jack; all other sounds (including two, three and, eventually, four-voice music and playback of audio samples and speech synthesis) were generated entirely by software that clicked the speaker at just the right times. Not for nearly a decade would an Apple II be released with a dedicated sound chip (though with six expansion slots, users could add sound functionality with various<space/><link><target>Apple II sound cards</target><part>sound cards</part></link>). Similar techniques were used for cassette storage: the cassette output worked the same as the speaker, and the input was a simple<space/><link><target>Zero crossing threshold detector</target><part>zero-crossing detector</part></link><space/>that served as a crude (1-bit) audio digitizer. Routines in the ROM were used to encode and decode data in<space/><link><target>frequency-shift keying</target></link><space/>for the cassette. Since the Apple II mainboard had no interrupts, it was impossible to use the speaker without taking CPU time and so most games had little sound.</paragraph><paragraph>Wozniak's open design and the Apple II's multiple expansion slots permitted a wide variety of third-party devices, including<space/><link><target>Apple II peripheral cards</target></link><space/>such as<space/><link><target>Apple II serial cards</target><part>serial controllers</part></link>, display controllers, memory boards, hard disks, networking components, and<space/><link><target>Apple II system clocks</target><part>realtime clocks</part></link>. There were plug-in<space/><link><target>Apple II processor cards</target><part>expansion cards</part></link><space/>such as the<space/><link><target>Z-80 SoftCard</target></link><extension extension_name='ref' name="z80"></extension><space/>that permitted the Apple to use the<space/><link><target>Zilog Z80</target><part>Z80</part></link><space/>processor and run a multitude of programs developed under the<space/><link><target>CP/M</target></link><space/>operating system,<extension extension_name='ref' name="z80"></extension><space/>including the<space/><link><target>dBase</target><part>dBase II</part></link><space/>database and the<space/><link><target>WordStar</target></link><space/>word processor.

RAM prices fell during 198081 and all II+ machines came from the factory with a full 48k of memory already installed. The language card in Slot 0 added another 16k, but it had to be<space/><link><target>bank switch</target><trail>ed</trail></link><space/>since the remaining CPU address space was occupied by the ROMs and I/O area. For this reason, the extra RAM in the language card was bank-switched over the machine's built-in ROM, allowing code loaded into the additional memory to be used as if it actually were ROM. Users could thus load Integer BASIC into the language card from disk and switch between the Integer and Applesoft dialects of BASIC with DOS 3.3's INT and FP commands just as if they had the BASIC ROM expansion card.

This card contained only RAM; the hardware and firmware for the 80-column display was built into the Apple IIe, remaining fairly compatible with the older Videx-style cards, even though the low-level details were very different. An &quot;extended 80-column card&quot; with more memory expanded the machine's RAM to 128&amp;nbsp;kB.</paragraph><paragraph>As with the language card, the memory in the 80-column card was bank-switched over the machine's main RAM; this made the memory better suited to data storage than to running software, and in fact the<space/><link><target>Apple ProDOS</target><part>ProDOS</part></link><space/>operating system, which was introduced with the Apple IIe, would automatically configure this memory as a<space/><link><target>RAM disk</target></link><space/>upon booting.</paragraph><paragraph>Third-party aux-slot memory cards later allowed expansion up to 1&amp;nbsp;<link><target>megabyte</target><part>MB</part></link>. The<space/><template><target>nowrap</target><arg>1 K</arg></template><space/>80-column card also enabled one new graphics mode, Double Lo-Res (8048 pixels). The extended 80-column card enabled two, Double Lo-Res and Double Hi-Res (560192 pixels). Both modes doubled the horizontal resolution in comparison to the standard Lo-Res (4048) and Hi-Res (280192) Modes; in the case of Double Hi-Res, the number of available colors was increased as well, from 6 to 15. Apple IIes from the very first production run could not use Double Hi-Res. Neither of these modes was directly supported by the built-in BASIC, however, so the user had to resort to the use of lots of POKE and CALL commands in BASIC, or assembly language programming, or one of a number of software Toolkits to exploit these modes.</paragraph><paragraph>While it was possible for software to switch out the 80-column firmware, making the firmware of a card in slot 3 available with a card in the auxiliary slot, it was not a common thing to do. However, even with the 80-column firmware enabled, slot 3's I/O memory range was still usable, giving it approximately the capability of slot 0 on a II or II plus. This meant that it actually was possible to use slot 3 for things, such as coprocessor cards and language cards, that did not use slot firmware space.</paragraph><paragraph>Introduced with the IIe was the DuoDisk, essentially two Disk II 5.25-inch drives in a single enclosure designed to stack between the computer and the monitor, and a new controller card to run it. This controller was (by design) functionally identical to the original Disk II controller but used a different connector, allowing a single cable to control both drives in the DuoDisk. The DuoDisk was plagued by reliability problems, however, and did not catch on as well as the Apple IIe itself.</paragraph><paragraph>The Apple IIe was the most popular Apple II ever built and was widely considered the &quot;workhorse&quot; of the line. It also has the distinction of being the longest-lived Apple computer of all time it was manufactured and sold with only minor changes for nearly 11 years. In that time, following the original, two important variations were introduced known as the<space/><link><target>Apple IIe#The Enhanced IIe</target><part>Apple IIe Enhanced</part></link><space/>(four new replacement chips to give it some of the features of the later model<space/><link><target>Apple IIc</target></link>, including an upgraded processor called the 65C02) and the<space/><link><target>Apple IIe Platinum</target></link><space/>(a modernized new look for the case color to match other Apple products of the era, along with the addition of a built-in<space/><link><target>numeric keypad</target></link>). An Enhanced IIe with 128&amp;nbsp;kB of RAM can be considered the minimum requirement for running most Apple II software released after about 1988. //e models were distinguished from the standard IIe by having 128k of memory, DHGR graphics mode, and a 65C02 CPU.</paragraph><paragraph>Two and a half years before the Apple IIe, Apple produced and unsuccessfully marketed a computer called the<space/><italics><link><target>Apple III</target></link></italics><space/>for business users.

Unlike previous Apple II models, the IIc had no internal expansion slots at all, this being the means by which its compact size was attained. Third parties did eventually figure out how to wedge up to 1&amp;nbsp;MB of additional memory and a real-time clock into the machine, and a later revision of the motherboard provided an expansion slot that could accept an Apple memory card bearing up to 1&amp;nbsp;MB of RAM. The disk port, originally intended for a second 5.25-inch floppy drive, eventually was able to interface to 3-inch disk drives and (via third parties) even hard disks.</paragraph><paragraph>IIc machines supported the 16 color DHGR (double hi-resolution graphics) graphics mode and from a software standpoint were identical to the //e.</paragraph><paragraph>To play up the portability, two different monochrome<space/><link><target>LCD</target></link><space/>displays were sold for use with the IIc's video expansion port, although both were short-lived due to high cost and poor legibility.

However, programmers in search of a graphics challenge could always turn to 3200-color mode, which involved precisely swapping in a different 16-color palette for each of the screen's 200 scanlines as the monitor's electron beam traced the screen line by line.

The computer could run existing 8-bit Apple II software (including software written for the very first Apple II in Integer BASIC), but also supported 16-bit software running under a new (albeit modified) OS called ProDOS 16 and later replaced by a full 16-bit OS called GS/OS.<extension extension_name='ref' name="making"></extension><space/>The new OS eventually included a Finder that could be used for managing disks and files and opening documents and applications, along with desk accessories just like the Macintosh.

The IIc Plus's accelerator was derived from a design licensed from Zip Technologies, a third-party maker of accelerators for the Apple II, though Apple used separate chips instead of combining the processor, cache, and supporting logic on a multi-chip module as did Zip. Like later models of the original Apple IIc, the IIc Plus included a memory expansion slot that would accept a daughter-card carrying up to a<space/><link><target>megabyte</target></link><space/>of RAM.

Because of that, the illegal cloning industry of Apple II-based computers was strong there. In the early 1980s, there were around 20 different clones of Apple II Plus computers in that country, all of them using illegally copied software and hardware (since the Apple II and II Plus used commonly-available TTL integrated circuits). Some of the names include Elppa (&quot;Apple&quot; spelled backwards), Maxtro, Exato MC4000 (by CCE), AP II (by Unitron), and even an &quot;Apple II Plus&quot; (manufactured by a company called Milmar, which was using the name illegally). There were only two clones of the Apple IIe, since it used custom IC chips that could not be copied, and therefore had to be reversed-engineered and developed in the country. These clones were the TK3000 IIe by Microdigital and Exato IIe by CCE. In addiiton, the Laser IIc was manufactured by Milmar and, despite the name, was a clone of the Apple II Plus, not of the Apple IIc, although it had a design similar to that of the Apple IIc, with an integrated floppy controller and 80-column card, but without an integrated floppy disk drive.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">July 2014</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>The Ace clones from<space/><link><target>Franklin Computer Corporation</target></link><space/>were the best known Apple II clones and had the most lasting impact, as Franklin copied Apple's ROMs and software and freely admitted to doing so. Franklin's response was that a computer's ROM was simply a pattern of switches locked into a fixed position, and one cannot copyright a pattern of switches. Apple fought Franklin in court for about five years to get its clones off the market, and was ultimately successful when a court ruled that software stored in ROM was in fact copyrightable in the U.S. (See<space/><link><target>Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp.</target></link>) Franklin later released non-infringing but less-compatible clones; these could run ProDOS and AppleWorks and had an Applesoft-like BASIC, but compatibility with other software was hit-or-miss.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">July 2014</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Apple also challenged<space/><link><target>VTech</target></link>'s<space/><link><target>Laser 128</target></link>, an enhanced clone of the Apple IIc first released in 1984, in court.

The uses of common consumer cassette recorders and a standard video monitor or television set (with a third party R-F modulator) made the total cost of owning an Apple II less expensive and helped contribute to the Apple II's success.</paragraph><paragraph>Cassette storage may have been inexpensive, but it was also slow and unreliable. The Apple II's lack of a disk drive was &quot;a glaring weakness&quot; in what was otherwise intended to be a polished, professional product. Recognizing that the II needed a disk drive to be taken seriously, Apple set out to develop a disk drive and a DOS to run it. Wozniak spent the 1977 Christmas holidays designing a disk controller that reduced the number of chips used by a factor of 10 compared to existing controllers. Still lacking a DOS, and with Wozniak inexperienced in operating system design, Jobs approached Shepardson Microsystems with the project. On April 10, 1978 Apple signed a contract for $13,000 with Sheperdson to develop the DOS.<extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.cnet.com/news/the-untold-story-behind-apples-13000-operating-system/</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Even after disk drives made the cassette input and output ports obsolete they were still used by enthusiasts as simple one-bit audio input-output ports. Ham radio operators used the cassette input to receive slow scan TV (single frame images). A commercial speech recognition Blackjack program was available, after some user-specific voice training it would recognize simple commands (Hit, stand). Bob Bishop's &quot;Music Kaleidoscope&quot; was a simple program which monitored the cassette input port and based on zero-crossings created color patterns on the screen, a predecessor to current audio visualization plug-ins for media players. Music Kaleidoscope was especially popular on projection TV sets in dance halls.</paragraph><paragraph>Apple and many third-party developers made software available on tape at first, but after the Disk II became available in 1978, tape-based Apple II software essentially disappeared from the market. The initial price of the Disk II drive and controller was $595 USD, although a $100 off coupon was available through the Apple newsletter &quot;Contact&quot;. The controller could handle two drives and a second drive (without controller) retailed for $495.</paragraph><paragraph>The Disk II single-sided floppy drive used 5.25-inch<space/><link><target>floppy disk</target><trail>s</trail></link>; double-sided disks could be used, one side at a time, by turning them over and notching a hole for the write protect sensor. The first<space/><link><target>disk operating system</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>for the Apple II were<space/><link><target>Apple DOS</target><part>DOS 3.1</part></link><space/>and DOS 3.2, which stored 113.75&amp;nbsp;kB on each disk, organized into 35 tracks of 13 256-byte sectors each. After about two years, DOS 3.3 was introduced, storing 140&amp;nbsp;kB thanks to a minor firmware change on the disk controller that allowed it to store 16 sectors per track. (This upgrade was user-installable as two PROMs on older controllers.) After the release of DOS 3.3, the user community discontinued use of DOS 3.2 except for running legacy software. Programs that required DOS 3.2 were fairly rare; however, as DOS 3.3 was not a major architectural change aside from the number of sectors per track, a program called MUFFIN was provided with DOS 3.3 to allow users to copy files from DOS 3.2 disks to DOS 3.3 disks. It was possible for software developers to create a DOS 3.2 disk which would also boot on a system with DOS 3.3 firmware.</paragraph><paragraph>Later, double-sided drives, with heads to read both sides of the disk, became available from third-party companies. (Apple only produced double-sided 5.25&quot; disks for the Lisa 1 computer).</paragraph><paragraph>On a DOS 3.x disk, tracks 0, 1, and most of track 2 were reserved to store the operating system. (It was possible, with a special utility, to reclaim most of this space for data if a disk did not need to be bootable.) A short ROM program on the disk controller had the ability to seek to track zero which it did without regard for the read/write head's current position, resulting in the characteristic &quot;chattering&quot; sound of a Disk II boot, which was the read/write head hitting the rubber stop block at the end of the rail and read and execute code from sector 0. The code contained in there would then pull in the rest of the operating system. DOS stored the disk's directory on track 17, smack in the middle of the 35-track disks, in order to reduce the average<space/><link><target>seek time</target></link><space/>to the frequently used directory track. The directory was fixed in size and could hold a maximum of 105 files. Subdirectories were not supported.</paragraph><paragraph>Most game publishers did not include DOS on their floppy disks, since they needed the memory it occupied more than its capabilities; instead, they often wrote their own boot loaders and read-only file systems. This also served to discourage &quot;crackers&quot; from snooping around in the game's copy-protection code, since the data on the disk was not in files that could be accessed easily.</paragraph><paragraph>Some third-party manufacturers produced floppy drives that could write 40 tracks to most 5.25-inch disks, yielding 160&amp;nbsp;kB of storage per disk, but the format did not catch on widely, and no known commercial software was published on 40-track media. Most drives, even Disk IIs, could write 36 tracks; a two byte modification to DOS to format the extra track was common.</paragraph><paragraph>The Apple Disk II stored 140&amp;nbsp;kB on single-sided, &quot;single-density&quot; floppy disks, but it was very common for Apple II users to extend the capacity of a single-sided floppy disk to 280&amp;nbsp;kB by cutting out a second write-protect notch on the side of the disk using a &quot;disk notcher&quot; or hole puncher and inserting the disk flipped over. Double-sided disks, with notches on both sides, were available at a higher price, but in practice the magnetic coating on the reverse of nominally single-sided disks was usually of good enough quality to be used (both sides were coated in the same way to prevent warping, although only one side was certified for use). Early on, diskette manufacturers routinely warned that this technique would damage the read/write head of the drives or wear out the disk faster, and these warnings were frequently repeated in magazines of the day. In practice, however, this method was an inexpensive way to store twice as much data for no extra cost, and was widely used for commercially released floppies as well.</paragraph><paragraph>Later, Apple IIs were able to use 3.5-inch disks with a total capacity of 800&amp;nbsp;kB and hard disks. DOS 3.3 did not support these drives natively; third-party software was required, and disks larger than about 400&amp;nbsp;kB had to be split up into multiple &quot;virtual disk volumes.&quot;</paragraph><paragraph>DOS 3.3 was succeeded by<space/><link><target>Apple ProDOS</target><part>ProDOS</part></link>, a 1983 descendent of the Apple ///'s SOS. It added the capabilities for subdirectories and larger storage capacities.</paragraph><paragraph>ProDOS became the Apple II operating system of choice for users with these larger disks thanks to its native support of volumes up to 32&amp;nbsp;MB in size and the fact that AppleWorks and other newer programs required it.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Renditions of the &quot;II&quot; name</heading><paragraph>The &quot;II&quot; portion of the Apple II name was rendered in a variety of creative ways using stylized characters which resembled punctuation symbols on the front lids of the computers, and most printed material followed this lead.

The first peripheral card was a blank prototyping card intended for electronics enthusiasts who wanted to design their own peripherals for the Apple II.</paragraph><paragraph>Specialty peripherals kept the Apple II in use in industry and education environments for many years after Apple Computer stopped supporting the Apple II.
