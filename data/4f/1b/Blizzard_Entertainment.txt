'''Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.''' is an American [[video game developer]] and [[video game publisher|publisher]] founded February 8, 1991, under the name '''Silicon & Synapse''' by three graduates of the [[University of California, Los Angeles]],<ref name="UCLAHonorDinner2006_11_06" /> [[Michael Morhaime]], [[Frank Pearce (businessman)|Frank Pearce]], and [[Allen Adham]] and is currently a subsidiary of American company [[Activision Blizzard]]. Based in [[Irvine, California]], the company originally concentrated primarily on the creation of game [[Porting|ports]] for other studios before beginning development of their own software in 1993 with the development of games like ''[[Rock n' Roll Racing]]'' and ''[[The Lost Vikings]]''. In 1994 the company became '''Chaos Studios''' then '''Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.''' after being acquired by distributor [[Davidson & Associates]].

Shortly thereafter, Blizzard shipped out what would become their first breakthrough smash hit ''[[Warcraft: Orcs & Humans]]''. Blizzard then went on to create several other successful video games, including other ''[[Warcraft]]'' sequels, the ''[[Diablo (series)|Diablo]]'' series, the ''[[StarCraft (series)|StarCraft]]'' series, and also in 2004 the hugely popular [[MMORPG]] ''[[World of Warcraft]]''. Their most recent projects include: the second expansion for ''[[StarCraft II]]:'' ''[[StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm|Heart of the Swarm]]'', the first expansion for ''[[Diablo III]]:'' ''[[Diablo III: Reaper of Souls|Reaper of Souls]]'', the online [[collectible card game]] [[Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft|Hearthstone]], the fifth expansion for ''[[World of Warcraft]]:'' [[World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor|''Warlords of Draenor'']], and the new "Hero Brawler" ''[[Heroes of the Storm]]''. Currently in [[beta testing]] and soon to be released is the third and final expansion for ''[[StarCraft II]]:'' ''[[StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void|Legacy of the Void]]''. Finally there are two titles that are currently in development. ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'', is an upcoming [[multiplayer]] [[first-person shooter]] first announced at [[BlizzCon]] on November 7, 2014 and entered [[beta testing]] in the third quarter of 2015. Lastly is the sixth expansion for ''[[World of Warcraft]]:'' ''[[World of Warcraft: Legion|Legion]]''. It was announced on August 6, 2015 at [[Gamescom 2015]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/06/gamescom-2015-world-of-warcraft-legion-announced|title=Gamescom 2015: World of Warcraft: Legion announced|work=IGN|last=Karmali|first=Luke|date=August 6, 2015|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}</ref>

Ports include titles such as ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, Vol. I (1990 video game)|J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, Vol. I]]'' and ''Battle Chess II: Chinese Chess''.<ref name="blizz_tline">{{cite web|url=http://www.blizzard.com/blizz-anniversary/timeline.shtml|title=Blizzard Timeline|publisher=Blizzard Entertainment|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010215105033/http://www.blizzard.com/blizz-anniversary/timeline.shtml|archivedate=February 15, 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/browse/games/blizzard-entertainment-inc/ported-by/list-games/|title=Ported by Blizzard Entertainment Inc.|publisher=Mobygames}}</ref> In 1993, the company developed games such as ''[[Rock n' Roll Racing]]'' and ''[[The Lost Vikings]]'' (published by [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay Productions]]).

In early 1994 they were acquired by distributor [[Davidson & Associates]] for $6.75&nbsp;million.<ref>Dean Takahashi: ''[http://articles.latimes.com/print/1994-03-13/business/fi-33584_1_video game-development Co-Founder Looks at Chaos in Early Stages and Future Challenges.]'' In: Los Angeles Times, March 13, 1994. – Interview with Allen Adham.</ref> The same year the company briefly changed its name to '''Chaos Studios,''' before finally settling on Blizzard Entertainment after it was discovered that another company with the Chaos name already existed.<ref>Dean Takahashi: ''[http://articles.latimes.com/print/1994-05-24/business/fi-61596_1_chaos-studios Briefcase: Technology.]'' In: Los Angeles Times, May 24, 1994.</ref> Shortly thereafter, Blizzard shipped their breakthrough hit ''[[Warcraft: Orcs & Humans]]''.

Blizzard has changed hands several times since then: Davidson was acquired along with [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra On-Line]] by a company called [[CUC International]] in 1996; CUC then merged with a hotel, real-estate, and car-rental franchiser called [[HFS Corporation]] to form [[Cendant]] in 1997. In 1998 it became apparent that CUC had engaged in accounting fraud for years before the merger; Cendant's stock lost 80% of its value over the next six months in the ensuing widely discussed accounting scandal. The company sold its consumer software operations, Sierra On-line which included Blizzard, to French publisher [[Havas]] in 1998, the same year Havas was purchased by [[Vivendi]]. Blizzard was part of the [[Vivendi Games]] group of Vivendi. In July 2008 Vivendi Games merged with [[Activision]], using Blizzard's name in the resulting company, [[Activision Blizzard]].

In 1996, Blizzard acquired Condor Games, which had been working on the game ''[[Diablo (video game)|Diablo]]'' for Blizzard at the time. Condor was renamed [[Blizzard North]], and has since developed hit games ''[[Diablo (video game)|Diablo]]'', ''[[Diablo II]]'', and its expansion pack ''[[Diablo II: Lord of Destruction]]''. Blizzard North was located in [[San Mateo, California]]; the company originated in [[Redwood City, California]].

Blizzard launched their online gaming service ''[[Battle.net]]'' in January 1997 with the release of their action-[[role-playing video game|RPG]] ''Diablo''. In 2002, Blizzard was able to reacquire rights for three of its earlier Silicon & Synapse titles from [[Interplay Entertainment]] and re-release them under [[Game Boy Advance]].<ref>{{cite interview | url=http://www.blizzard.com/us/insider/011/lostvikings.html | title=The Making of The Lost Vikings | date=November 22, 2002 | accessdate=June 23, 2007 | last=Morhaime | first=Mike | interviewer=Blizzard Insider | program=Blizzard Insider | format=url | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030211022815/http://www.blizzard.com/insider/011/lostvikings.shtml | archivedate=February 11, 2003}}</ref> In 2004, Blizzard opened European offices in the Paris suburb of [[Vélizy-Villacoublay|Vélizy]], Yvelines, France, responsible for the European in-game support of ''[[World of Warcraft]]''. On November 23, 2004, Blizzard released World of Warcraft, its [[MMORPG]] offering. On May 16, 2005, Blizzard announced the [[Takeover|acquisition]] of [[Swingin' Ape Studios]], a [[video game developer]] which had been developing ''[[StarCraft: Ghost]]''. The company was then merged into Blizzard's other teams after ''StarCraft: Ghost'' was "postponed indefinitely". <!-- reliable source needed for this news: Production on Starcraft: Ghost has since been cancelled. -->On August 1, 2005, Blizzard announced the [[Consolidation (business)|consolidation]] of Blizzard North into the headquarters at 131 Theory in [[UC Irvine]]'s University Research Park in [[Irvine, California]]. In 2007, Blizzard moved their headquarters to 16215 Alton Parkway in [[Irvine, California]].

=== Main franchises ===
Currently, Blizzard has three main franchises in the gaming industry: ''[[Warcraft]]'', ''[[Diablo (series)|Diablo]]'', and ''[[StarCraft (series)|StarCraft]]''. Multiple games have been released for each game series, and other media based around the [[intellectual property]] for each franchise. Books have been written to expand the story for each series, along with media such as comics and collectible card games. Blizzard Entertainment announced in 2006 that they will be producing a [[Warcraft (film)|''Warcraft'' live-action movie]]. The movie is currently in development, financed and produced by [[Legendary Pictures]], [[Atlas Entertainment]] and [[Film4 Productions|Film4]], and will be distributed by [[Universal Pictures]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.blizzard.com/press/060509.shtml| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060526064526/http://www.blizzard.com/press/060509.shtml| archivedate=May 26, 2006| title=Blizzard Entertainment – Press Release| accessdate=August 31, 2006|date=May 9, 2006}}</ref> It is scheduled to be released in 2016 and is directed by [[Duncan Jones]].

=== Unreleased games ===
Notable unreleased titles include ''[[Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans]]'', which was cancelled on May 22, 1998, ''Shattered Nations'', and ''[[StarCraft: Ghost]]'', which was "Postponed indefinitely" on March 24, 2006 after being in [[development hell]] for much of its lifespan. After seven years of development, Blizzard revealed the cancellation of an unannounced MMO codenamed ''[[Titan (Blizzard Entertainment project)|"Titan"]]'' on September 23, 2014.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.polygon.com/2014/9/23/6833953/blizzard-cancels-titan-next-gen-mmo-pc | title = Blizzard cancels its next-gen MMO Titan after seven years | last = Kollar | first = Philip | publisher = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | date = September 23, 2013}}</ref> The company also has a history of declining to set release dates, choosing to instead take as much time as needed, generally saying a given product is "done when it's done."<ref>{{Cite news |author=GamePro Staff |url = http://www.gamepro.com/article/news/79448/gamepro-q-a-blizzards-jeff-kaplan-on-the-burning-crusade/ |title = GamePro Q&A: Blizzard's Jeff Kaplan on The Burning Crusade |publisher=[[GamePro]] |date = August 29, 2006 |accessdate =September 30, 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090114012421/http://www.gamepro.com/article/news/79448/gamepro-q-a-blizzards-jeff-kaplan-on-the-burning-crusade/|archivedate=2009-01-14}}</ref>

''Pax Imperia II'' was originally announced as a title to be published by Blizzard. Blizzard eventually dropped ''Pax Imperia II'', though, when it decided it might be in conflict with their other space strategy project, which became known as ''[[StarCraft (series)|StarCraft]]''. THQ eventually contracted with Heliotrope and released the game in 1997 as ''[[Pax Imperia: Eminent Domain]]''.

== Technology ==

=== Warden client ===
{{Main|Warden (software)}}

Blizzard has made use of a special form of software known as the 'Warden Client'. The Warden client is known to be used with Blizzard's Online Games such as ''Diablo'' and ''World of Warcraft'', and the Terms of Service contain a clause consenting to the Warden software's RAM scans while a Blizzard game is running.<ref>[http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/legal/termsofuse.html WoW -> Legal -> Terms of Use]. Worldofwarcraft.com (December 9, 2010). Retrieved July 8, 2011.</ref>

The Warden client scans a small portion of the [[code segment]] of running processes in order to determine whether any third-party programs are running. The goal of this is to detect and address players who may be attempting to run unsigned code or third party programs in the game. This determination of third party programs is made by [[Hash function|hashing]] the scanned [[String (computer science)|strings]] and comparing the hashed value to a list of hashes assumed to correspond to banned third party programs.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/*hh_/www.rootkit.com/blog.php?newsid=358 rootkit.com]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}</ref> The Warden's reliability in correctly discerning legitimate versus illegitimate actions was called into question when a large scale incident happened when many Linux users were banned after an update to Warden caused it to incorrectly detect [[Cedega (software)|Cedega]] as a cheat program.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080216041937/http://www.linuxlookup.com/2006/nov/15/linux_users_banned_from_world_of_warcraft Linux Users Banned From World of Warcraft? | Linuxlookup].

Web.archive.org (August 3, 2008). Retrieved July 8, 2011.</ref>
Warden scans all processes running on a computer, not just the World of Warcraft game, and could possibly run across what would be considered private information and other [[personally identifiable information]]. It is because of these peripheral scans that Warden has been accused of being [[spyware]] and has run afoul of controversy among [[privacy]] advocates.<ref>Guttridge, Luke. (November 8, 2005) [http://play.tm/news/6837/wow-s-warden-stirs-controversy/ WoW's Warden stirs controversy – news – play]. Play.tm.

=== Battle.net 2.0 ===
{{main|Battle.net}}
Blizzard released its revamped Battle.net service in 2009. This service allows people who have purchased Blizzard products (''[[StarCraft]]'', ''[[StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty|StarCraft II]]'', ''[[Diablo II]]'', and ''[[Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos|Warcraft III]]'', as well as their expansions) to download digital copies of games they have purchased, without needing any physical media.

On November 11, 2009, Blizzard required all ''World of Warcraft'' accounts to switch over to Battle.net Accounts. This transition now means that all current Blizzard titles can be accessed, downloaded, and played with a singular Battle.net login.<ref>[http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/index.xml World of Warcraft]. World of Warcraft. Retrieved July 8, 2011.</ref>

Battle.net 2.0 is the new platform for matchmaking service for Blizzard games which  offers players a host of additional features. Players will now be able to track their friend's achievements, view match history, avatars, etc. Players will also be able to unlock a wide range of achievements (rewards for completing game content) for Blizzard games. This means players can enjoy new avatars, decals, badges etc, for their accounts.

The service  also allows players to chat simultaneously with players from other Blizzard games. For example, players no longer need to create multiple user names or accounts for most Blizzard products. StarCraft II, Diablo III, Hearthstone, World of Warcraft and the Battle.net Launcher  support the ability for users to cross communicate. This means that a player could be in a game of StarCraft II, and he/she may send or receive messages from friends playing World of Warcraft or Diablo III. To enable cross game communication players need to become either Battletag or Real ID friends..

== Privacy controversy and Real ID ==
On July 6, 2010, Blizzard announced that they were changing the way their forums worked to require that users identify themselves with their real name.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forums.battle.net/thread.html?topicId=25626109041&sid=3000&pageNo=1 |title=Battle.net Update: Upcoming Changes to the Forums |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100709053633/http://forums.battle.net/thread.html?topicId=25626109041&sid=3000&pageNo=1 |archivedate=2010-07-09 |accessdate=April 1, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://wow.joystiq.com/2010/07/06/official-forum-changes-real-life-names-to-be-displayed|title=Official forum changes, real life names to be displayed}}</ref> The reaction from the community was overwhelmingly negative with multiple game magazines calling the change "foolhardy"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/254846/news/fans-rage-over-blizzard-forum-plans/|title=Fans rage over Blizzard forum plans}}</ref> and an "Epic Fail".<ref>[http://www.pcgamer.com/2010/07/07/why-blizzard%E2%80%99s-new-forum-plan-is-an-epic-fail Why Blizzard’s new forum plan is an epic fail].

Some technology media outlets suggested that displaying real names through Real ID is a good idea and would benefit both Battle.net and the Blizzard community.<ref>[http://www.kombo.com/article.php?artid=15106] {{wayback|url=http://www.kombo.com/article.php?artid=15106 |date=20130203103306 }}</ref> But others were worried that Blizzard were opening their fans up to real-life dangers such as stalking, harassment, and employment issues, since a simple Internet search by someone's employer can reveal their online activities.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ve3d.ign.com/articles/news/55728/Is-Blizzards-Real-ID-Safe-Or-A-Playground-For-Sexual-Deviants|title=Is Blizzard's Real ID Safe, Or A Playground For Sexual Deviants?}}</ref><ref>[http://www.geekingoutabout.com/2010/07/06/21st-century-digital-redacted/ Geeking Out About… » 21st Century Digital REDACTED].

Blizzard initially responded to some of the concerns by saying that the changes would not be retroactive to previous posts, that parents could set up the system so that minors cannot post, and that posting to the forums is optional.<ref name="holisky1">{{cite web|last=Holisky |first=Adam |url=http://wow.joystiq.com/2010/07/06/blizzards-responses-on-the-real-id-situation/ |title=Blizzard's responses on the Real ID situation |publisher=Wow.com |accessdate=July 8, 2010}}</ref> However, due to the huge negative response, Blizzard President [[Michael Morhaime]] issued a statement rescinding the plan to use real names on Blizzard's forums for the time being.<ref>[http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?sid=1&topicId=25968987278 World of Warcraft – English (NA) Forums -> Regarding real names in forums]. Forums.worldofwarcraft.com. Retrieved July 8, 2011.</ref>

Apart from the negative side effects of Real ID relating to privacy, the new addition boasts new features for current Blizzard titles. For instance, real names for friends, cross-realm and cross-game chat, rich presence and broadcasts are included with the Real ID system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20007841-1.html?tag=mncol;txt|title=Warcraft Gamers to get Real ID, Dong Ngo}}</ref>

=== ''FreeCraft'' ===
{{Main|Stratagus}}

On June 20, 2003, Blizzard issued a [[cease and desist]] letter to the developers of an [[open source]] clone of the Warcraft engine called ''FreeCraft'', claiming [[trademark infringement]]. This hobby project had the same gameplay and characters as ''Warcraft II'', but came with different graphics and music.

As well as a similar name, ''FreeCraft'' enabled gamers to use ''Warcraft II'' graphics, provided they had the ''Warcraft II'' CD. The programmers of the clone shut down their site without challenge. Soon after that the developers regrouped to continue the work by the name of ''[[Stratagus]]''.<ref>[http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2004/07/15/stratagus.html Howard Wen, '&#39;Stratagus: Open Source Strategy Games'&#39; linuxdevcenter.com July 15, 2004].

=== World of Warcraft Private Server Complications ===
On December 5, 2008, Blizzard issued a [[cease and desist]] letter to many administrators of high population ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' private servers (essentially slightly altered hosting servers of the actual [[World of Warcraft]] game, that players do not have to pay for). Blizzard used the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] to influence many private servers to fully shut down and cease to exist.<ref>[http://wow.joystiq.com/2008/12/05/blizzard-legal-targets-private-servers/ Blizzard legal targets private servers] (Accessed Oct. 12, 2009)</ref> In 2008 a private server by the name of ChaosCrusade was served with a DMCA notification.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://newenthusiast.com/blizzard-hitting-wow-pirates-20081205248 | title=ChaosCrusade DMCA Notice | publisher=[http://www.newenthusiast.com New Enthusiast] | date=December 5, 2008 | accessdate=June 5, 2011}}</ref>

=== Founder Electronics infringement lawsuit ===
On August 14, 2007, [[Beijing University]] [[Founder Electronics]] Co., Ltd. sued Blizzard Entertainment Limited for copyright infringement claiming 100 million [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] in damages.

=== MDY Industries, LLC v. Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. ===
{{Main|Glider (bot)}}

On July 14, 2008, the [[United States District Court for the District of Arizona]] ruled on the case ''[[MDY Industries, LLC v. Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.]]''. The Court found that MDY was liable for [[copyright infringement]] since users of its [[glider (bot)|Glider]] bot program were breaking the End User License Agreement and Terms of Use for ''[[World of Warcraft]]''. MDY Industries appealed the judgment of the district court, and a judgment was delivered by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on December 14, 2010, in which the summary judgment against MDY for contributory copyright infringement was reversed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/09-15932/920101214/|title=MDY Industries, LLC v.
