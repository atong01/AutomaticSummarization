In 1961, with DC's JLA as the specific spur,<template><target>refn</target><arg>Apocryphal legend has it that in 1961, either [[Jack Liebowitz]] or [[Irwin Donenfeld]] of DC Comics (then known as National Periodical Publications) bragged about DC's success with the Justice League (which had debuted in ''The Brave and the Bold'' #28 [February 1960] before going on to its own title) to [[publisher]] [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]] (whose holdings included the nascent [[Marvel Comics]]) during a game of golf.
<br><br>
However, film producer and comics historian [[Michael Uslan]] partly debunked the story in a letter published in ''Alter Ego'' #43 (December 2004), pp. 43–44
{{quote|Irwin said he never played golf with Goodman, so the story is untrue. I heard this story more than a couple of times while sitting in the lunchroom at DC's 909 Third Avenue and 75 Rockefeller Plaza office as [[Sol Harrison]] and [production chief] [[Jack Adler]] were schmoozing with some of us ... who worked for DC during our college summers.... [T]he way I heard the story from Sol was that Goodman was playing with one of the heads of Independent News, not DC Comics (though DC ''owned'' Independent News). ... As the distributor of DC Comics, this man certainly knew all the sales figures and was in the best position to tell this tidbit to Goodman. ... Of course, Goodman would want to be playing golf with this fellow and be in his good graces. ... Sol worked closely with Independent News' top management over the decades and would have gotten this story straight from the horse's mouth.}}

Goodman, a publishing trend-follower aware of the JLA's strong sales, confirmably directed his comics editor, [[Stan Lee]], to create a comic-book series about a team of superheroes. According to Lee in ''Origins of Marvel Comics'' ([[Marvel Fireside Books|Simon and Schuster/Fireside Books]], 1974), p. 16:
"Martin mentioned that he had noticed one of the titles published by National Comics seemed to be selling better than most. It was a book called ''The'' {{sic}} ''Justice League of America'' and it was composed of a team of superheroes. ... ' If the Justice League is selling ', spoke he, 'why don't we put out a comic book that features a team of superheroes?'"</arg><arg name="group">n</arg></template><space/><link><target>Marvel Comics</target></link><space/>writer-editor<space/><link><target>Stan Lee</target></link><space/>and legendary creator<space/><link><target>Jack Kirby</target></link><space/>ushered in the sub-Silver Age &quot;Marvel Age&quot; of comics with the debut issue of<space/><italics><link><target>The Fantastic Four</target></link></italics>.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.psu.edu/dept/inart10_110/inart10/cmbk6silver.html'>Integrative Arts 10: &quot;The Silver Age&quot; by Jamie Coville</link>.

In June 1978, five months before the release of the<space/><link><target>Superman (1978 film)</target><part>first Superman movie</part></link>, Kahn expanded the line further, increasing the number of titles and story pages, and raising the price from 35 cents to 50 cents.

This publishing format allowed for the deliberate creation of finite storylines within a more flexible publishing format that could showcase creations without forcing the talent into unsustainable openended commitments.</paragraph><paragraph>These changes in policy shaped the future of the medium as a whole, and in the short term allowed DC to entice creators away from rival Marvel, and encourage stability on individual titles. In November 1980 DC launched the ongoing series<space/><italics><link><target>Teen Titans</target><part>The New Teen Titans</part></link></italics>, by writer<space/><link><target>Marv Wolfman</target></link><space/>and artist<space/><link><target>George Prez</target></link>, two popular talents with a history of success.

In addition, Wolfman and Prez took advantage of the limited-series option to create a<space/><link><target>Spin-off (media)</target><part>spin-off</part></link><space/>title,<space/><italics>Tales of the New Teen Titans</italics>, to present origin stories of their original characters without having to break the narrative flow of the main series or oblige them to double their work load with another ongoing title.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Modern Age</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Modern Age of Comic Books</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>This successful revitalization of the Silver Age Teen Titans led DC's editors<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">January 2014</arg></template><space/>to seek the same for the wider<space/><link><target>DC Universe</target></link>. The result, the Wolfman/Prez 12-issue limited series<space/><italics><link><target>Crisis on Infinite Earths</target></link></italics>, gave the company an opportunity to realign and jettison some of the characters' complicated backstory and continuity discrepancies.

The letters &quot;DC&quot; stood for<space/><italics>Detective Comics</italics>, the name of Batman's flagship title. The small logo, with no background, read simply, &quot;A DC Publication&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>The November 1941 DC titles introduced an updated logo. This version was almost twice the size of the previous one, and was the first version with a white background. The name &quot;Superman&quot; was added to &quot;A DC Publication&quot;, effectively acknowledging both Superman and Batman. This logo was the first to occupy the top-left corner of the cover, where the logo has usually resided since. The company now referred to itself in its advertising as &quot;Superman-DC&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>In November 1949, the logo was modified to incorporate the company's formal name, National Comics Publications. This logo would also serve as the round body of Johnny DC, DC's<space/><link><target>mascot</target></link><space/>in the 1960s.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:dc variantlogo.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>150px</part><part>1987 test logo.</part></link>In October 1970, DC briefly retired the circular logo in favor of a simple &quot;DC&quot; in a rectangle with the name of the title, or the star of the book; the logo on many issues of<space/><italics>Action Comics</italics>, for example, read &quot;DC Superman&quot;. An image of the lead character either appeared above or below the rectangle. For books that did not have a single star, such as<space/><link><target>Anthology</target><part>anthologies</part></link><space/>like<space/><italics><link><target>House of Mystery</target></link></italics><space/>or team series such as<space/><italics>Justice League of America</italics>, the title and &quot;DC&quot; appeared in a stylized logo, such as a<space/><link><target>bat</target></link><space/>for &quot;House of Mystery&quot;. This use of characters as logos helped to establish the likenesses as<space/><link><target>trademark</target><trail>s</trail></link>, and was similar to Marvel's contemporaneous use of characters as part of its cover branding.</paragraph><paragraph>DC's<space/><link type='external' href='http://www.metropolisplus.com/dc100page/index.htm'>&quot;100 Page Super-Spectacular&quot;</link><space/>titles and later 100-page and &quot;Giant&quot; issues published from 1972 to 1974 featured a logo exclusive to these editions: the letters &quot;DC&quot; in a simple<space/><link><target>sans-serif</target></link><space/><link><target>typeface</target></link><space/>within a circle. A variant had the letters in a square.</paragraph><paragraph>The July 1972 DC titles featured a new circular logo. The letters &quot;DC&quot; were rendered in a block-like typeface that would remain through later logo revisions until 2005. The title of the book usually appeared inside the circle, either above or below the letters.</paragraph><paragraph>In December 1973, this logo was modified with the addition of the words &quot;The Line of DC Super-Stars&quot; and the star motif that would continue in later logos. This logo was placed in the top center of the cover from August 1975 to October 1976.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:DC Comics logo.svg</target><part>150px</part><part>thumb</part><part>20052012 logo.</part></link>When Jenette Kahn became DC's<space/><link><target>Publishing</target><part>publisher</part></link><space/>in late 1976, she commissioned graphic designer<space/><link><target>Milton Glaser</target></link><space/>to design a new logo. Popularly referred to as the &quot;DC bullet&quot;, this logo premiered on the February 1977 titles. Although it varied in size and colour and was at times cropped by the edges of the cover, or briefly rotated 4 degrees, it remained essentially unchanged for nearly three decades. Despite logo changes since 2005, the old &quot;DC bullet&quot; continues to be used only on the<space/><link><target>DC Archive Editions</target></link><space/>series.</paragraph><paragraph>In July 1987, DC released variant editions of<space/><italics>Justice League</italics><space/>#3 and<space/><italics>The Fury of Firestorm</italics><space/>#61 with a new DC logo.
