It produces, for all practical purposes, a<space/><link><target>monochromatic</target></link><space/>orange/yellow light, which gives a similarly monochromatic perceprtion of any illuminated scene. For this reason, it is generally reserved for outdoor public lighting usages. Low-pressure sodium lights are favoured for public lighting by astronomers, since the<space/><link><target>light pollution</target></link><space/>that they generate can be easily filtered, contrary to broadband or continuous spectra.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Incandescent light bulb</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Incandescent light bulb</arg></template>The modern incandescent lightbulb, with a coiled filament of tungsten, was commercialized in the 1920s developed from the carbon<space/><link><target>Electrical filament</target><part>filament</part></link><space/>lamp introduced in about 1880. As well as bulbs for normal illumination, there is a very wide range, including low voltage, low-power types often used as components in equipment, but now largely displaced by LEDs</paragraph><paragraph>There is currently interest in banning some types of filament lamp in some countries, such as Australia planning to ban standard incandescent light bulbs by 2010, because they are inefficient at converting electricity to light. Sri Lanka has already banned importing filament bulbs because of high use of electricity and less light. Less than 3% of the input energy is converted into usable light. Nearly all of the input energy ends up as heat that, in warm climates, must then be removed from the building by<space/><link><target>Ventilation (architecture)</target><part>ventilation</part></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>air conditioning</target></link>, often resulting in more energy consumption. In colder climates where heating and lighting is required during the cold and dark winter months, the heat byproduct has at least some value.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Halogen lamp</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Halogen lamp</arg></template></paragraph><preblock><preline></preline></preblock><paragraph>Halogen lamps are usually much smaller than standard incandescents, because for successful operation a bulb temperature over 200&amp;nbsp;C is generally necessary. For this reason, most have a bulb of fused silica (quartz), but sometimes aluminosilicate glass. This is often sealed inside an additional layer of glass. The outer glass is a safety precaution, reducing UV emission and because halogen bulbs can occasionally explode during operation. One reason is if the quartz bulb has oily residue from<space/><link><target>fingerprint</target><trail>s</trail></link>. The risk of burns or fire is also greater with bare bulbs, leading to their prohibition in some places unless enclosed by the luminaire.</paragraph><paragraph>Those designed for 12 V or 24 V operation have compact filaments, useful for good optical control, also they have higher efficiencies (lumens per watt) and better lives than non halogen types. The light output remains almost constant throughout life.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Fluorescent lamp</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Fluorescent lamp</arg></template><link><target>Fluorescent lighting</target><part>Fluorescent</part></link><space/>lamps consist of a glass tube that contains mercury vapour or argon under low pressure.

The<space/><link><target>electric arc</target></link><space/>is struck by touching the rods then separating them. The ensuing arc heats the carbon tips to white heat. These lamps have higher efficiency than filament lamps, but the carbon rods are short lived and require constant adjustment in use. The lamps produce significant<space/><link><target>ultra-violet</target></link><space/>output, they require ventilation when used indoors, and due to their intensity they need protecting from direct sight.</paragraph><paragraph>Invented by<space/><link><target>Humphry Davy</target></link><space/>around 1805, the carbon arc was the first practical electric light. They were used commercially beginning in the 1870s for large building and street lighting until they were superseded in the early 20th century by the incandescent light. Carbon arc lamps operate at high powers and produce high intensity white light. They also are a point source of light. They remained in use in limited applications that required these properties, such as<space/><link><target>movie projector</target><trail>s</trail></link>,<space/><link><target>stage lighting</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>searchlight</target><trail>s</trail></link>, until after World War 2.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Discharge lamp</heading><paragraph>A<space/><bold>discharge lamp</bold><space/>has a glass or silica envelope containing two metal<space/><link><target>electrode</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>separated by a gas.

This requires an electrical circuit called an igniter, which is part of the<space/><link><target>Ballast (electrical)</target><part>ballast</part></link><space/>circuitry. After the arc is struck, the internal resistance of the lamp drops to a low level, and the ballast limits the current to the operating current. Without a ballast, excess current would flow, causing rapid destruction of the lamp.</paragraph><paragraph>Some lamp types contain a little neon, which permits striking at normal running voltage, with no external ignition circuitry.<space/><link><target>Sodium vapor lamp</target><part>Low pressure sodium lamps</part></link><space/>operate this way.</paragraph><paragraph>The simplest ballasts are just an inductor, and are chosen where cost is the deciding factor, such as street lighting. More advanced electronic ballasts may be designed to maintain constant light output over the life of the lamp, may drive the lamp with a square wave to maintain completely flicker-free output, and shut down in the event of certain faults.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Lamp life expectancy</heading><preblock><preline>Life expectancy is defined as the number of hours of operation for a lamp until 50% of them fail. This means that it is possible for some lamps to fail after a short amount of time and for some to last significantly longer than the rated lamp life. This is an average (median) life expectancy. Production tolerances as low as 1% can create a variance of 25% in lamp life. For LEDs, lamp life is when 50% of lamps have lumen output drop to 70% or less.</preline></preblock><paragraph>Lamps are also sensitive to switching cycles. The rapid heating of a lamp filament<template><target>dubious</target><arg name="date">August 2012</arg></template><space/>or electrodes when a lamp is turned on is the most stressful event on the lamp. Most test cycles have the lamps on for 3 hours and then off for 20 minutes. (Some standard had to be used since it is unknown how the lamp will be used by consumers.) This switching cycle repeats until the lamps fail and the data is recorded. If switching is increased to only 1 hour on, the lamp life is usually reduced because the number of times the lamp has been turned on has increased. Rooms with frequent switching (bathroom, bedrooms, etc.) can expect much shorter lamp life than what is printed on the box.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Public lighting</heading><paragraph>The total amount of artificial light (especially from<space/><link><target>street light</target></link>) is sufficient for cities to be easily visible at night from the air, and from space.
