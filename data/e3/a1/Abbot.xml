Sometimes he ruled over only one community, sometimes over several, each of which had its own abbot as well. Saint<space/><link><target>John Cassian</target></link><space/>speaks of an abbot of the<space/><link><target>Thebaid</target></link><space/>who had 500 monks under him. By the<space/><link><target>Rule of St Benedict</target></link>, which, until the<space/><link><target>Cluniac reforms</target></link>, was the norm in the West, the abbot has jurisdiction over only one community. The rule, as was inevitable, was subject to frequent violations; but it was not until the foundation of the<space/><link><target>Abbey of Cluny</target><part>Cluniac</part></link><space/>Order that the idea of a supreme abbot, exercising jurisdiction over all the houses of an order, was definitely recognized.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Venables</arg><arg>1911</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Monks, as a rule, were laymen, nor at the outset was the abbot any exception. For the reception of the<space/><link><target>sacraments</target></link>, and for other religious offices, the abbot and his monks were commanded to attend the nearest church. This rule proved inconvenient when a monastery was situated in a desert or at a distance from a city, and necessity compelled the<space/><link><target>ordination</target></link><space/>of some monks. This innovation was not introduced without a struggle,<space/><link><target>ecclesiology</target><part>ecclesiastical</part></link><space/>dignity being regarded as inconsistent with the higher<space/><link><target>spirituality</target><part>spiritual</part></link><space/>life, but, before the close of the 5th century, at least in the East, abbots seem almost universally to have become<space/><link><target>deacon</target><trail>s</trail></link>, if not priests. The change spread more slowly in the West, where the office of abbot was commonly filled by laymen till the end of the 7th century. The ecclesiastical leadership exercised by abbots despite their frequent lay status is proved by their attendance and votes at ecclesiastical councils.

The<space/><link><target>Code of Justinian</target></link><space/>(lib. i. tit. iii. de Ep. leg. xl.) expressly subordinates the abbot to episcopal oversight. The first case recorded of the partial exemption of an abbot from episcopal control is that of Faustus, abbot of Lerins, at the council of Arles, AD 456; but the exorbitant claims and exactions of bishops, to which this repugnance to episcopal control is to be traced, far more than to the arrogance of abbots, rendered it increasingly frequent, and, in the 6th century, the practice of exempting religious houses partly or altogether from episcopal control, and making them responsible to the pope alone, received an impulse from<space/><link><target>Pope Gregory I</target><part>Pope Gregory the Great</part></link>. These exceptions, introduced with a good object, had grown into a widespread evil by the 12th century, virtually creating an<space/><italics>imperium in imperio,</italics><space/>and depriving the bishop of all authority over the chief centres of influence in his<space/><link><target>diocese</target></link>.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Venables</arg><arg>1911</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='3'>Later Middle Ages</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Mitre#Christian clergy</arg><arg name="l1">Mitres</arg></template>In the 12th century, the abbots of<space/><link><target>Fulda monastery</target><part>Fulda</part></link><space/>claimed precedence of the<space/><link><target>archdiocese of Cologne</target><part>archbishop of Cologne</part></link>.

One of the main goals of monasticism was the purgation of self and selfishness, and obedience was seen as a path to that perfection. It was sacred duty to execute the abbot's orders, and even to act without his orders was sometimes considered a transgression. Examples among the Egyptian monks of this submission to the commands of the superiors, exalted into a virtue by those who regarded the entire crushing of the individual will as a goal, are detailed by Cassian and others, e.g. a monk watering a dry stick, day after day, for months, or endeavoring to remove a huge rock immensely exceeding his powers.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Venables</arg><arg>1911</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='4'>Appointments</heading><paragraph>When a vacancy occurred, the bishop of the diocese chose the abbot out of the monks of the<space/><link><target>abbey</target><part>convent</part></link>, but the right of election was transferred by jurisdiction to the monks themselves, reserving to the bishop the confirmation of the election and the benediction of the new abbot.

Cassian speaks of an abbot in Egypt doing this; and in later times we have another example in the case of St Bruno. Popes and sovereigns gradually encroached on the rights of the monks, until in Italy the pope had usurped the nomination of all abbots, and the king in France, with the exception of Cluny, Premontr and other houses, chiefs of their order. The election was for life, unless the abbot was canonically deprived by the chiefs of his order, or when he was directly subject to them, by the pope or the bishop, and also in England it was for a term of 812 years.<extension extension_name='ref' name="EB"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The ceremony of the formal admission of a<space/><link><target>Benedictine</target></link><space/>abbot in medieval times is thus prescribed by the<space/><link><target>Consuetudinary (book)</target><part>consuetudinary</part></link><space/>of Abingdon. The newly elected abbot was to put off his shoes at the door of the church, and proceed barefoot to meet the members of the house advancing in a procession. After proceeding up the<space/><link><target>nave</target></link>, he was to kneel and pray at the topmost step of the entrance of the choir, into which he was to be introduced by the bishop or his<space/><link><target>commissary</target></link>, and placed in his stall. The monks, then kneeling, gave him the kiss of peace on the hand, and rising, on the mouth, the abbot holding his<space/><link><target>staff of office</target></link>.

When he appeared either in church or chapter all present rose and bowed. His letters were received kneeling, as were those of the pope and the king. No monk might sit in his presence, or leave it without his permission, reflecting the hierarchical etiquette of families and society. The highest place was assigned to him, both in church and at table. In the East he was commanded to eat with the other monks. In the West the<space/><link><target>Rule of St Benedict</target></link><space/>appointed him a separate table, at which he might entertain guests and strangers. Because this permission opened the door to luxurious living,<space/><link><target>Synods of Aachen (816819)</target></link>, decreed that the abbot should dine in the<space/><link><target>refectory</target></link>, and be content with the ordinary fare of the monks, unless he had to entertain a guest. These ordinances proved, however, generally ineffectual to secure strictness of diet, and contemporaneous literature abounds with satirical remarks and complaints concerning the inordinate extravagance of the tables of the abbots. When the abbot condescended to dine in the refectory, his<space/><link><target>chaplain</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>waited upon him with the dishes, a servant, if necessary, assisting them. When abbots dined in their own private hall, the Rule of St Benedict charged them to invite their monks to their table, provided there was room, on which occasions the guests were to abstain from quarrels, slanderous talk and idle gossiping.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Venables</arg><arg>1911</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Image:Template-Abbot - Provost.svg</target><part>right</part><part>thumb</part><part>Arms of a Roman Catholic abbot are distinguished by a gold<space/><link><target>crozier</target></link><space/>with a veil attached and a black<space/><link><target>galero</target></link><space/>with twelve tassels (the galero of a<space/><link><target>territorial abbot</target></link><space/>would be green)</part></link>The ordinary attire of the abbot was according to rule to be the same as that of the monks. But by the 10th century the rule was commonly set aside, and we find frequent complaints of abbots dressing in silk, and adopting sumptuous attire. Some even laid aside the monastic habit altogether, and assumed a secular dress. With the increase of wealth and power, abbots had lost much of their special religious character, and become great lords, chiefly distinguished from lay lords by<space/><link><target>clerical celibacy</target><part>celibacy</part></link>. Thus we hear of abbots going out to hunt, with their men carrying bows and arrows; keeping horses, dogs and huntsmen; and special mention is made of an abbot of<space/><link><target>Leicester</target></link>, c. 1360, who was the most skilled of all the nobility in hare hunting. In magnificence of equipage and<space/><link><target>retinue</target></link><space/>the abbots vied with the first nobles of the realm. They rode on mules with gilded bridles, rich saddles and housings, carrying hawks on their wrist, followed by an immense train of attendants. The bells of the churches were rung as they passed. They associated on equal terms with laymen of the highest distinction, and shared all their pleasures and pursuits.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Venables</arg><arg>1911</arg></template><space/>This rank and power was, however, often used most beneficially. For instance, we read of Whiting, the last abbot of<space/><link><target>Glastonbury Abbey</target><part>Glastonbury</part></link>, judicially murdered by<space/><link><target>Henry VIII of England</target><part>Henry VIII</part></link>, that his house was a kind of well-ordered court, where as many as 300 sons of noblemen and gentlemen, who had been sent to him for virtuous education, had been brought up, besides others of a lesser rank, whom he fitted for the universities. His table, attendance and officers were an honour to the nation. He would entertain as many as 500 persons of rank at one time, besides relieving the poor of the vicinity twice a week. He had his country houses and fisheries, and when he travelled to attend parliament his retinue amounted to upwards of 100 persons.

These lay abbacies were not merely a question of overlordship, but implied the concentration in lay hands of all the rights, immunities and jurisdiction of the foundations, i.e. the more or less complete secularization of spiritual institutions. The lay abbot took his recognized rank in the feudal hierarchy, and was free to dispose of his fief as in the case of any other. The<space/><link><target>enfeoffment</target></link><space/>of abbeys differed in form and degree.

The connection of the lesser lay abbots with the abbeys, especially in the south of France, lasted longer; and certain feudal families retained the title of abbes chevaliers (abbates milltes) for centuries, together with certain rights over the abbey lands or revenues. The abuse was not confined to the West. John,<space/><link><target>patriarch of Antioch</target></link>, at the beginning of the 12th Century, informs us that in his time most monasteries had been handed over to laymen,<space/><italics>bencficiarii,</italics><space/>for life, or for part of their lives, by the emperors.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Venables</arg><arg>1911</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Giraldus Cambrensis</target></link><space/>reported (<italics>Itinerary</italics>, ii.iv) the common customs of lay abbots in the late 12th-century Church of Wales:</paragraph><list type='ident'><listitem>&quot;for a bad custom has prevailed amongst the clergy, of appointing the most powerful people of a parish stewards, or, rather, patrons, of their churches; who, in process of time, from a desire of gain, have usurped the whole right, appropriating to their own use the possession of all the lands, leaving only to the clergy the altars, with their tenths and oblations, and assigning even these to their sons and relations in the church. Such defenders, or rather destroyers, of the church, have caused themselves to be called abbots, and presumed to attribute to themselves a title, as well as estates, to which they have no just claim.&quot;</listitem></list><paragraph>In conventual cathedrals, where the bishop occupied the place of the abbot, the functions usually devolving on the superior of the monastery were performed by a<space/><link><target>prior</target></link>.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Modern practices</heading><paragraph>In the Roman Catholic Church, abbots continue to be elected by the monks of an abbey to lead them as their religious superior in those orders and monasteries that make use of the term (some orders of monks, as the<space/><link><target>Carthusians</target></link><space/>for instance, have no abbots, only<space/><link><target>prior</target><trail>s</trail></link>).

Once chosen, he must request blessing: the blessing of an abbot is celebrated by the bishop in whose diocese the monastery is or, with his permission, another abbot or bishop. The ceremony of such a blessing is similar in some aspects to the consecration of a bishop, with the new abbot being presented with the<space/><link><target>mitre</target></link>, the ring, and the<space/><link><target>crosier</target></link><space/>as symbols of office and receiving the laying on of hands and blessing from the celebrant. Though the ceremony installs the new abbot into a position of legal authority, it does not confer further sacramental authority- it is not a further degree of Holy Orders (although some abbots have been ordained to the episcopacy).</paragraph><paragraph>Once he has received this blessing, the abbot not only becomes father of his monks in a spiritual sense, but their major superior under canon law, and has the additional authority to confer the ministries of acolyte and lector (formerly, he could confer the minor orders, which are not sacraments, that these ministries have replaced). The abbey is a species of &quot;exempt religious&quot; in that it is, for the most part, answerable to the Pope, or to the abbot primate, rather than to the local bishop.</paragraph><paragraph>The abbot wears the same habit as his fellow monks, though by tradition he adds to it a pectoral cross.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Territorial abbot</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>follow all of the above, but in addition must receive a mandate of authority from the Pope over the territory around the monastery for which they are responsible.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Abbatial hierarchy</heading><paragraph>In some monastic families, there is a hierarchy of precedence or authority among abbots.

Being men of presumed learning and undoubted leisure, many of the class found admission to the houses of the French nobility as tutors or advisers. Nearly every great family had its abb.

In the<space/><link><target>Orthodox Church</target></link>, only actual monastics are permitted to be elevated to the rank of Archimandrite. Married priests are elevated to the parallel rank of<space/><link><target>Archpriest</target></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>Protopresbyter</target></link>.

Since the time of<space/><link><target>Catherine II of Russia</target><part>Catherine II</part></link><space/>the ranks of Abbot and Archimandrite have been given as honorary titles in the Russian Church, and may be given to any monastic, even if he does not in fact serve as the superior of a monastery. In Greek practice the title or function of Abbot corresponds to a person who actually serves as the head of a monastery, although the title of the Archimandrite may be given to any celibate priest who could serve as the head of a monastery.</paragraph><paragraph>In the<space/><link><target>Evangelical Church in Germany</target><part>German Evangelical Church</part></link>, the German title of<space/><italics>Abt</italics><space/>(abbot) is sometimes bestowed, like the French<space/><italics>abb</italics>, as an honorary distinction, and survives to designate the heads of some monasteries converted at the Reformation into collegiate foundations.Of these the most noteworthy is<space/><link><target>Loccum Abbey</target></link><space/>in<space/><link><target>Hanover</target></link>, founded as a<space/><link><target>Cistercian</target></link><space/>house in 1163 by Count Wilbrand of Hallermund, and reformed in 1593.
