Thus, an analog signal is one represented by a continuous stream of data, in this case along an electrical circuit in the form of voltage, current or charge changes<space/><italics>(compare with digital signals below)</italics>. Analog signal processing (ASP) then involves physically altering the continuous signal by changing the voltage or current or charge via various electrical means.</paragraph><paragraph>Historically, before the advent of widespread<space/><link><target>digital technology</target></link>, ASP was the only method by which to manipulate a signal.

To be perceived as echo, the delay has to be of order 35 milliseconds or above. Short of actually playing a sound in the desired environment, the effect of echo can be implemented using either<space/><link><target>Digital data</target><part>digital</part></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>analog (signal)</target><part>analog</part></link><space/>methods. Analog echo effects are implemented using<space/><link><target>Delay (audio effect)</target><part>tape delay</part><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and/or<space/><link><target>spring reverb</target><trail>s</trail></link>. When large numbers of delayed signals are mixed over several seconds, the resulting sound has the effect of being presented in a large room, and it is more commonly called<space/><link><target>reverberation</target></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>reverberation</target><part>reverb</part></link><space/>for short.</listitem><listitem><italics><link><target>flanging</target><part>flanger</part></link></italics><space/>- to create an unusual sound, a delayed signal is added to the original signal with a continuously variable delay (usually smaller than 10 ms). This effect is now done electronically using<space/><link><target>digital signal processing</target><part>DSP</part></link>, but originally the effect was created by playing the same recording on two synchronized tape players, and then mixing the signals together. As long as the machines were synchronized, the mix would sound more-or-less normal, but if the operator placed his finger on the flange of one of the players (hence &quot;flanger&quot;), that machine would slow down and its signal would fall out-of-phase with its partner, producing a phasing effect. Once the operator took his finger off, the player would speed up until its<space/><link><target>tachometer</target></link><space/>was back in phase with the master, and as this happened, the phasing effect would appear to slide up the frequency spectrum. This phasing up-and-down the register can be performed rhythmically.</listitem><listitem><italics><link><target>phaser (effect)</target><part>phaser</part></link></italics><space/>- another way of creating an unusual sound; the signal is split, a portion is<space/><link><target>audio filter</target><part>filtered</part></link><space/>with an<space/><link><target>all-pass filter</target></link><space/>to produce a phase-shift, and then the unfiltered and filtered signals are mixed. The phaser effect was originally a simpler implementation of the flanger effect since delays were difficult to implement with analog equipment. Phasers are often used to give a &quot;synthesized&quot; or electronic effect to natural sounds, such as human speech. The voice of<space/><link><target>C-3PO</target></link><space/>from<space/><link><target>Star Wars</target></link><space/>was created by taking the actor's voice and treating it with a phaser.</listitem><listitem><italics><link><target>chorus effect</target><part>chorus</part></link></italics><space/>- a delayed signal is added to the original signal with a constant delay. The delay has to be short in order not to be perceived as echo, but above 5 ms to be audible. If the delay is too short, it will destructively interfere with the un-delayed signal and create a<space/><link><target>flanging</target></link><space/>effect. Often, the delayed signals will be slightly pitch shifted to more realistically convey the effect of multiple voices.</listitem><listitem><italics><link><target>equalization (audio)</target><part>equalization</part></link></italics><space/>- different frequency bands are<space/><link><target>Attenuation</target><part>attenuated</part></link><space/>or boosted to produce desired spectral characteristics. Moderate use of equalization (often abbreviated as &quot;EQ&quot;) can be used to &quot;fine-tune&quot; the tone quality of a recording; extreme use of equalization, such as heavily cutting a certain frequency can create more unusual effects.</listitem><listitem><italics><link><target>audio filter</target><part>filtering</part></link></italics><space/>- Equalization is a form of filtering.

For example, a signal may be shifted an octave up or down. This is usually applied to the entire signal, and not to each note separately. Blending the original signal with shifted duplicate(s) can create harmonies from one voice. Another application of pitch shifting is<space/><link><target>pitch correction</target></link>. Here a musical signal is tuned to the correct pitch using digital signal processing techniques. This effect is ubiquitous in karaoke machines and is often used to assist pop singers who sing out of tune.
