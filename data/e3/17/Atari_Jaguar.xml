With development of the Jaguar running ahead of schedule, the Panther was cancelled, and the release of the Jaguar was pushed forward. It was originally released to test markets in<space/><link><target>New York City</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>San Francisco</target></link><space/>in November 1993, and to the general public in 1994, with<space/><italics><link><target>Cybermorph</target></link></italics><space/>as the<space/><link><target>pack-in game</target><part>pack-in</part></link><space/>launch game.</paragraph><paragraph>Upon release, it was criticized for its complex controller design, failure to distinguish itself from its 16-bit competitors, and low quality game library. The console's multi-chip architecture made game development for the console difficult, and underwhelming sales further contributed to the console's lack of third party support. This, in addition to the lack of internal development at Atari, led to a limited games library, comprising only 67 licensed titles.</paragraph><paragraph>Atari attempted to extend the lifespan of the Jaguar by releasing a<space/><link><target>CD-ROM</target></link><space/><link><target>Video game accessory</target><part>add-on</part></link><space/>known as the<space/><link><target>Atari Jaguar CD</target></link><space/>and marketing the Jaguar as the low-cost next generation console, with a price tag over $100 less than any of its competitors.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite journal</target><arg name="title">Once and Future Kings</arg><arg name="work">[[GamePro]]</arg><arg name="issue">80</arg><arg name="publisher">[[International Data Group|IDG]]</arg><arg name="date">May 1995</arg><arg name="pages">28-30</arg></template></extension><space/>With the release of the<space/><link><target>Sega Saturn</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Sony Computer Entertainment</target><part>Sony</part></link>'s<space/><link><target>PlayStation (console)</target><part>PlayStation</part></link><space/>in 1995, sales of the Jaguar continued to fall, ultimately selling no more than 250,000 units before it was eventually discontinued in 1996.

Atari attributes the poor performance of Jaguar to a number of factors including (i) extensive delays in development of software for the Jaguar which resulted in reduced orders due to consumer concern as to when titles for the platform would be released and how many titles would ultimately be available, and (ii) the introduction of competing products by Sega and Sony in May 1995 and September 1995, respectively.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/802019/0000891618-96-000213.txt'>Atari Corporation Annual Report, 1993</link>. pp 3.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Lack of titles was attributable to two main factors: the Jaguar's questionable long-term prospects among third-party game-publishers and the problematic nature of developing games for the Jaguar. Atari had one opportunity to convince third-party developers, vital for the diversity of Jaguar's game library, with a solid retail-performance, but as things played out, post-holiday sales figures questioned the viability of Atari's business; Atari failed to attract many third-party developers already committed to other game platforms. In addition, the Jaguar's underlying hardware was crippled by a flaw in the CPU's<space/><link><target>memory controller</target></link>, which prevented code execution out of system<space/><link><target>Random-access memory</target><part>RAM</part></link>. Less severe, but still annoying defects included a buggy<space/><link><target>Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter</target><part>UART</part></link>. The memory controller flaw could have been mitigated by a mature code-development environment, to unburden the programmer from having to micromanage small chunks of code. Jaguar's development tools left much to the programmer's own implementation, as documentation was incomplete. Writing game-code was often an endurance exercise in the tedious<space/><link><target>assembly language</target><part>assembler</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>In a July 1995 interview with<space/><italics><link><target>Next Generation (magazine)</target><part>Next Generation</part></link></italics>, then-CEO Sam Tramiel declared that the Jaguar was as powerful, if not more powerful, than the<space/><link><target>Sega Saturn</target></link>, and slightly weaker than the<space/><link><target>PlayStation (console)</target><part>PlayStation</part></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Cite news</target><arg name="title">Atari's President talks back<space/></arg><arg name="magazine"><space/>Next Generation<space/></arg><arg name="date"><space/>July 1995<space/></arg><arg name="postscript"><space/></arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Decline</heading><paragraph>By the end of<space/><link><target>1995 in video gaming</target><part>1995</part></link>, Atari's revenues declined by more than half, from US$38.7 million in 1994 to $14.6 million in 1995.<extension extension_name='ref' name="10-K405 SEC Filing, filed by ATARI CORP on 4/12/1996"><link type='external' href='http://sec.edgar-online.com/1996/04/12/00/0000891618-96-000213/Section8.asp'>ATARI CORP Annual Report (Regulation S-K, item 405) (10-K405) ITEM 7.
