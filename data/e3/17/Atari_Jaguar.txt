The '''Atari Jaguar''' is a [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|fifth generation]] [[home video game console]] that was developed by [[Atari Corporation]]. The console was the sixth and last programmable console to be developed under the [[Atari]] brand, originally released in North America in November 1993. Marketed by Atari as the first [[64-bit]] video game console, the Jaguar was designed to compete with the 16-bit [[Sega Genesis]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] and the 32-bit [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer]] platform.

Development on the Atari Jaguar started in the early 90s, and was designed by [[Flare Technology]], who were tasked by Atari to create two consoles; the [[Atari Panther]], which would compete with the Sega Genesis and the Super Nintendo, and a successor, the Jaguar, which would surpass the capabilities of any other console on the market at the time. With development of the Jaguar running ahead of schedule, the Panther was cancelled, and the release of the Jaguar was pushed forward. It was originally released to test markets in [[New York City]] and [[San Francisco]] in November 1993, and to the general public in 1994, with ''[[Cybermorph]]'' as the [[pack-in game|pack-in]] launch game.

Upon release, it was criticized for its complex controller design, failure to distinguish itself from its 16-bit competitors, and low quality game library. The console's multi-chip architecture made game development for the console difficult, and underwhelming sales further contributed to the console's lack of third party support. This, in addition to the lack of internal development at Atari, led to a limited games library, comprising only 67 licensed titles.

Atari attempted to extend the lifespan of the Jaguar by releasing a [[CD-ROM]] [[Video game accessory|add-on]] known as the [[Atari Jaguar CD]] and marketing the Jaguar as the low-cost next generation console, with a price tag over $100 less than any of its competitors.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Once and Future Kings|work=[[GamePro]]|issue=80|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=May 1995|pages=28-30}}</ref> With the release of the [[Sega Saturn]] and [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]]'s [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in 1995, sales of the Jaguar continued to fall, ultimately selling no more than 250,000 units before it was eventually discontinued in 1996. The Jaguar was deemed a [[List of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failure]], and prompted Atari to leave the home video game console market. After [[Hasbro Interactive]] bought out Atari in the late 1990s, the patents to the Jaguar were released into the [[public domain]], with the console being declared an open platform. Since then, the Jaguar has gained a cult following, with a developer base that produces [[homebrew (video games)|homebrew games]] for the console.

==History==

===Development===
The Jaguar was developed by the members of [[Flare Technology]], a company formed by [[Martin Brennan (engineer)|Martin Brennan]] and [[John Mathieson (computer scientist)|John Mathieson]]. The team had claimed that they could not only make a console superior to the [[Sega Genesis]] or the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], but they could also be cost-effective.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Impressed by their work on the [[Konix Multisystem]], Atari persuaded them to close Flare and form a new company called [[Flare Technology|Flare II]], with Atari providing the funding.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Flare II initially set to work designing two consoles for Atari Corp. One was a 32-bit architecture (codenamed "[[Atari Panther|Panther]]"), and the other was a 64-bit system (codenamed "Jaguar"); however, work on the Jaguar design progressed faster than expected, so Atari Corp. canceled the Panther project to focus on the more promising Jaguar.

===Launch===
The Jaguar was introduced in 1993 at a price of $249.99,<ref name="gamepro">{{cite web|url= http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/111823/the-10-worst-selling-consoles-of-all-time-page-2-of-2/|title=The 10 Worst-Selling Consoles of All Time| accessdate=2008-08-01|author=Blake Snow|publisher=[[GamePro]].com|date=2007-05-04|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080905175411/http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/111823/the-10-worst-selling-consoles-of-all-time-page-2-of-2/|archivedate=2008-09-05}}</ref> under a $500 million manufacturing deal with [[IBM]]. The system was initially marketed only in [[New York City]] and [[San Francisco]], under the slogan "Do the Math",<ref name="gamepro"/> claiming superiority over competing 16-bit and 32-bit systems. A US-wide release followed in early 1994.

The Atari Jaguar struggled to attain a substantial user base. In 1993, Atari reported that they had shipped 17,000 units as part of the system's initial test market.<ref>Atari Corporation Annual Report, 1993. pp 14.</ref> By the end of 1994, Atari reported that they had sold approximately 100,000 systems and had reduced the price to improve the competitive nature of the console.<ref>Atari Corporation Annual Report. pp 11.</ref> By the end of 1995, [[Sony]] and [[Sega]] had entered the marketplace with competing consoles and Atari's sales declined rapidly. In Atari's 1995 annual report, they noted:

"Jaguar sales were substantially below Atari's expectations, and Atari's business and financial results were materially adversely affected in 1995 as Atari continued to invest heavily in Jaguar game development, entered into arrangements to publish certain licensed titles and reduced the retail price for its Jaguar console unit. Atari attributes the poor performance of Jaguar to a number of factors including (i) extensive delays in development of software for the Jaguar which resulted in reduced orders due to consumer concern as to when titles for the platform would be released and how many titles would ultimately be available, and (ii) the introduction of competing products by Sega and Sony in May 1995 and September 1995, respectively."<ref>[http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/802019/0000891618-96-000213.txt Atari Corporation Annual Report, 1993]. pp 3.</ref>

Lack of titles was attributable to two main factors: the Jaguar's questionable long-term prospects among third-party game-publishers and the problematic nature of developing games for the Jaguar.  Atari had one opportunity to convince third-party developers, vital for the diversity of Jaguar's game library, with a solid retail-performance, but as things played out, post-holiday sales figures questioned the viability of Atari's business; Atari failed to attract many third-party developers already committed to other game platforms. In addition, the Jaguar's underlying hardware was crippled by a flaw in the CPU's [[memory controller]], which prevented code execution out of system [[Random-access memory|RAM]]. Less severe, but still annoying defects included a buggy [[Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter|UART]]. The memory controller flaw could have been mitigated by a mature code-development environment, to unburden the programmer from having to micromanage small chunks of code. Jaguar's development tools left much to the programmer's own implementation, as documentation was incomplete. Writing game-code was often an endurance exercise in the tedious [[assembly language|assembler]].

In a July 1995 interview with ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'', then-CEO Sam Tramiel declared that the Jaguar was as powerful, if not more powerful, than the [[Sega Saturn]], and slightly weaker than the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=Atari's President talks back | magazine = Next Generation | date = July 1995 | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>

===Decline===
By the end of [[1995 in video gaming|1995]], Atari's revenues declined by more than half, from US$38.7 million in 1994 to $14.6 million in 1995.<ref name="10-K405 SEC Filing, filed by ATARI CORP on 4/12/1996">[http://sec.edgar-online.com/1996/04/12/00/0000891618-96-000213/Section8.asp ATARI CORP Annual Report (Regulation S-K, item 405) (10-K405) ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL C]{{Dead link|date=September 2009}}</ref> In late 1995, Atari Corp. ran early-morning [[infomercial]] advertisements with enthusiastic salesmen touting the powerful game system. The infomercials ran most of the year, but did not significantly sell the remaining stock of Jaguar systems. In its 10-K405 SEC Filing, filed April 12, 1996, Atari informed their stockholders of the truly dire nature of the Jaguar business: {{quote|From the introduction of Jaguar in late 1993 through the end of 1995, Atari sold approximately 125,000 units of Jaguar.

Production of the Jaguar ceased after Atari Corp. merged with [[JT Storage]] in a [[reverse takeover]].<ref name="jtmerger">{{cite web | url=http://contracts.onecle.com/atari/jt.mer.1996.04.08.shtml | title=Atari and JT Storage Reorganisation Plan | publisher=One Cle | accessdate=2006-11-25| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061209123854/http://contracts.onecle.com/atari/jt.mer.1996.04.08.shtml| archivedate= 9 December 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In a last-ditch effort to revive the Jaguar, Atari Corp. tried to play down the other two consoles by proclaiming the Jaguar was the only "64-bit" system.

Atari Corp.'s reasoning that the 32-bit "Tom" and "Jerry" chips work in tandem to add up to a 64-bit system was ridiculed in a mini-editorial by ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'', which commented that "If Sega did the math for the Sega Saturn the way Atari did the math for their 64-bit Jaguar system, the Sega Saturn would be a 112-bit monster of a machine."<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=The Hot Number: 112|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=71|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=June 1995|page=30}}</ref> Design specs for the console allude to the GPU or DSP being capable of acting as a CPU, leaving the Motorola 68000 to read controller inputs. In practice, however, many developers used the Motorola 68000 to drive gameplay logic.

==Technical specifications==

===COJAG Arcade Games===
[[Atari Games]] licensed the Atari Jaguar's chipset for use in its arcade games. The system, named '''COJAG''' (for "Coin-Op Jaguar"), replaced the [[Motorola 68000|68000]] with a [[Motorola 68020|68020]] or [[MIPS Technologies|MIPS]] [[R3000]]-based CPU (depending on the board version), and added a hard drive and more RAM. It ran the lightgun games ''[[Area 51 (1995 video game)|Area 51]]'' and ''[[Maximum Force]]'', which were released by Atari as dedicated cabinets or as the Area 51/Maximum Force combo machine. Other games (''3 On 3 Basketball''; ''Fishin' Frenzy''; ''Freeze''; ''Vicious Circle'') were developed but never released.

===Atari Jaguar Duo===
The '''Atari Jaguar Duo''' was a proposed console similar to the [[Sega Genesis#Variations|Sega CDX]]. It was an attempt by [[Atari]] to combine the Atari Jaguar and [[Atari Jaguar CD]] to make a new console. It was never completed and was thus never released. After cancelling the console, Atari was bought by [[Hasbro]] and ceased all console development.<ref>{{cite web|last=Edwards |first=Benj |url=http://www.pcmag.com/slideshow/story/264435/10-unreleased-video-game-consoles/3 |title=10 Unreleased Video Game Consoles - Atari Jaguar Duo (1995) - Slideshow from |publisher=PCMag.com |date=2011-05-14 |accessdate=2013-11-24}}</ref>

==Peripherals==
[[File:Atari-Jaguar-Pro-Controller-Flat.jpg|thumb|right|The redesigned controller, dubbed the "ProController", was released in response to criticism of the original controller.]]
Prior to the launch of the console in November 1993, Atari had announced a variety of peripherals and add-ons for the Jaguar to be released over the console's lifespan. This included a [[CD-ROM]]-based add-on console, a [[Dial-up Internet access|dial-up internet link]] with support for online gaming, a [[virtual reality]] headset, and an [[MPEG-2]] video card, among other things.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Atari's 64-bit Jaguar Stalks the Competition|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=51|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=October 1993|pages=16–17}}</ref> However, due to the poor sales and eventual commercial failure of the Jaguar, most of the peripherals in development were scrapped. The only peripherals and add-ons released by Atari for the Jaguar were a redesigned controller, an adapter for [[Multiplayer video game|four-players]], a CD console add-on and a link cable for [[Local area network]] (LAN) gaming.

The redesigned second controller for the Jaguar, named the "ProController" by Atari, added three more face buttons, two triggers, and had a flat interface. The controller was created in response to the criticism of the original controller that the console came with. Sold independently, however, it was never bundled with the system after its release. A peripheral that allowed 4 controllers to be plugged into the console was also released. Dubbed the "Team Tap", it was released independently and as a bundle with ''[[White Men Can't Jump (video game)|White Men Can't Jump]]''.<ref name="computinghistory.org.uk">{{cite web|title=Atari Team Tap Multi-Player Adapter|url=http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/34799/Atari-Team-Tap-Multi-Player-Adapter/|website=[[The Centre for Computing History]]|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref> However, the Team Tap was only compatible with ''White Men Can't Jump'' and ''[[NBA Jam Tournament Edition]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=NBA Jam Tournament Edition (Jaguar) - Manual|url=https://atariage.com/manual_html_page.html?SoftwareID=2512|website=[[Atari Age#AtariAge (website)|AtariAge]]|publisher=[Original publisher: [[Midway Games]]]|date=February 1995|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref> Eight player gameplay with the Team Tap peripheral is also possible if a second Team Tap is plugged into the second controller port on the console.<ref name="computinghistory.org.uk"/> Local area network multiplayer gameplay was achieved through the use of the Jaglink Interface, which allowed two Jaguar consoles to be linked together through a modular extension and a [[Twisted pair#Unshielded twisted pair|UTP]] phone cable. The Jaglink was compatible with three games: ''[[AirCars]]'', ''[[BattleSphere]]'' and ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]''.

In 1994 at the CES, Atari announced that it partnered up with Phylon, Inc. to create the Jaguar Voice/Data Communicator. The unit was delayed and eventually in 1995 mass production was canceled all together, but not before an estimated 100 or so were made. The JVM as it became known, utilized a 19.9kbit/s dial up modem and had the ability to answer incoming phone calls and store up to 18 phone numbers. Players were required to directly dial each other for online game play. The only Jaguar game that supports the JVM is [[Ultra Vortek]], the modem is initialized in the Ultra Vortek start up screen by entering 911 on the key pad.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vinciguerra|first=Robert|title=A Complete History of Online Console Gaming in the United States|url=http://www.revrob.com/sci-a-tech-topmenu-52/38-a-complete-history-of-online-console-gaming-in-the-united-states|work=The Rev.

{{main|Atari Jaguar CD}}

The Atari Jaguar CD is an add-on to the Jaguar that made use of [[CD-ROM]]s to distribute games. Developed and marketed in response to Sony's [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and Sega's [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]] console, it was released in September 1995, two years after the Jaguar's launch. Twelve games were released for the system during its manufacturing lifetime, with many more being made after, by [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] developers. Each copy of the Jaguar CD console also came with a [[Virtual Light Machine]], which displayed light patterns corresponding to music, if the user inserts an Audio CD into the console. It was developed by [[Jeff Minter]], who had created the program after experimenting with graphics during the development of ''[[Tempest 2000]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Minter|first1=Jeff|title=VLM - History|url=http://www.minotaurproject.co.uk/vlm.php|publisher=[[Jeff Minter|Llamasoft]]|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref> The program was deemed a spiritual successor to the [[Atari Video Music]], a system which served a similar purpose, released in 1976.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wolf|first1=Mark J.

An additional accessory for the Jaguar CD, which allowed Jaguar CD games to save persistent data such as preferences and saved games, was also released. Known as the Memory Track, it was a cartridge that contained a 128&nbsp;K [[EEPROM]], and was to be inserted into the cartridge slot on the Jaguar CD while the user played a Jaguar CD game. The program manager for the Memory Track is accessed by pushing the option button while the system is starting, and exited by pushing the * and # keys simultaneously.<ref>{{cite web|title=Atari Memory Track - User Manual|url=http://kick-ass.asuscomm.com/html/library/documents/mt.pdf|publisher=[[Atari Corporation]]|date=1995|accessdate=12 June 2015}}</ref> There were plans to make a second model of the Jaguar console that combined both the Jaguar and the Jaguar CD into one unit, a la the [[TurboDuo]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Todd|first=Mowatt|title=Atari to Unleash New Jaguar CD and Jaguar III|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=70|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=May 1995|pages=28}}</ref> Originally codenamed the Jaguar III, and later the Jaguar Duo, the proposed model was developed to feasibly compete with the PlayStation and Sega Saturn, however, the idea was scrapped after the discontinuation of the Jaguar.<ref>{{cite web|last=Edwards|first=Benj|url=http://www.pcmag.com/slideshow/story/264435/10-unreleased-video-game-consoles/3|title=10 Unreleased Video Game Consoles - Atari Jaguar Duo (1995)|website=[[PC Magazine]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis|Ziff Davis LLC]]|date=14 May 2011|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref>

===Unlicensed peripherals===
An unofficial expansion peripheral for the Atari Jaguar dubbed the "Catbox" was released by the [[Rockford, Illinois]] company ICD. It was originally slated to be released early in the Jaguar's life, in the second quarter of 1994,<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Jaguar's Cat Box|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=69|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1994|pages=184–186}}</ref> but was not actually released until mid-1995.<ref name="GPro83">{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=No Litterbox|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=83|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=August 1995|page=108}}</ref> The ICD CatBox plugs directly into the AV/DSP connectors located in the rear of the Jaguar console and provides three main functions. These are audio, video, and communications. It features six output formats, three for audio ([[Line level|line level stereo]], RGB monitor, [[Headphones|headphone]] jack with volume control) and three for video ([[Composite video|composite]], [[S-Video]], and [[RGB color model|RGB analog component video]]) making the Jaguar compatible with multiple high quality monitor systems and multiple monitors at the same time. It is capable of communications methods known as CatNet and [[RS-232]] as well as [[Digital signal processor|DSP]] pass through, allowing the user to connect two or more Jaguars together for multi player games either directly or with modems. The ICD CatBox features a polished stainless steel casing<ref name="GPro83"/> and red [[Light-emitting diode|LED]]s in the jaguar's eyes on the logo that indicate communications activity. An [[IBM Personal Computer/AT|IBM AT]] type null modem cable may be used to connect two Jaguars together.<ref>Official CatBox Manual - Final Version 1.01c - May 8, 1996</ref> The CatBox is also compatible with Atari's Jaglink Interface peripheral.

An adaptor for the Jaguar that allows for [[MSN TV|WebTV]] access was revealed in 1998, one prototype is known to exist.

==Reception==
[[File:Atari-Jaguar-Controller.jpg|thumb|right|The original controller was criticized for complexity of design.<ref name=harris/>]]
In 2006 [[IGN]] editor Craig Harris rated the Jaguar controller as the worst ever,<ref name =harris>{{cite web |title=Top 10 Tuesday: Worst Game Controllers |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/690/690449p1.html |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2009-08-07 |date=2006-02-21}}</ref> criticizing the complexity of the "phone keypad". A version that has six action buttons, the Pro Controller, is suggested for certain games. Reviewing the Jaguar just a few weeks prior to its launch, ''[[GamePro]]'' gave it a "thumbs sideways". They praised the power of the hardware but criticized the controller, and were dubious of how the software lineup would turn out, commenting that Atari's failure to secure support from key third party publishers such as [[Capcom]] was a bad sign. They concluded that "Like the [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]], the Jaguar is a risky investment - just not quite as expensive."<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=System Shopper|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=53|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=December 1993|pages=46–49}}</ref> Jaguar did earn praise with titles such as ''[[Tempest 2000]]'', ''[[Doom (video game)|Doom]]'', and ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]''.<ref>''[http://www.atariage.com/Jaguar/history.html Atari Jaguar History]''.

Digital Spy commented: "Like many failed hardware ventures, it still maintains something of a cult following but can only be considered a misstep for Atari."<ref>http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/gaming/news/a453849/atari-retrospective-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-gaming-giant.html</ref>

After the Atari Corporation properties were bought out by [[Hasbro Interactive]] in the late 1990s, Hasbro released the rights to the Jaguar, declaring the console an open platform and opening the doors for [[homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] development.<ref name="hasbro">{{cite web | url=http://www.atariage.com/Jaguar/archives/HasbroRights.html | title=Hasbro Releases Jaguar Publishing Rights | publisher=Hasbro Interactive | accessdate=2008-05-14}}</ref><ref name="redundant">{{cite web | last = Goss | first = Patrick | title = Redundant gadgets (Atari Jaguar entry) | url=http://tech.uk.msn.com/features/gallery.aspx?cp-documentid=6171299&imageindex=5  | accessdate = 2007-10-23

In the [[United Kingdom]] in 2001, a deal was struck between Telegames and retailer [[Game (retailer)|Game]] to bring the Jaguar to Game's retail outlets. The machine was initially sold for £29.99 brand new and software prices ranged between £9.99 for more common games such as ''[[Doom (video game)|Doom]]'' and ''[[Ruiner Pinball]]'', and £39.99 for more sought-after releases such as ''[[Defender 2000]]'' and ''[[Checkered Flag (video game)|Checkered Flag]]''. The machine had a presence in the stores until 2007 when remaining consoles were sold off for £9.99 and games were sold for as low as 97p.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

This deal was seen as a move to remain competitive with Game's rival at the time, [[Gamestation]], who were well known for stocking retro formats.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

Imagin Systems, a manufacturer of dental imaging equipment, has since purchased the molding plates for the Jaguar's casing as with minor modification they were found to be the right size for housing their HotRod camera.<ref>{{cite web | title = Atari Jaguar Revived As Dental Camera | date = January 1, 2010 | work = 1UP | url = http://www.1up.com/news/atari-jaguar-revived-dental-camera | accessdate = October 24, 2010 }}</ref> The game cartridge molds were reused to create an optional memory expansion card.<ref>{{cite web | title = HotRod | publisher = Imagin | url = http://www.imaginsystems.com/Graphics/HotRod%20DS-final.pdf | accessdate = October 24, 2010 }}</ref>

In December 2014, the molds for the console and cartridges were purchased from Imagin Systems by Mike Kennedy, owner of the ''GameGavel'' video game auction website and ''Retro Magazine'', a [[Kickstarter]] funded print and digital retro video game magazine, to manufacture shells for a brand new, Kickstarter funded, cartridge-based video game console, called the ''[[Retro VGS]]'' (Retro Video Game System). The purchase of the molds from Imagin Systems was far cheaper than designing and manufacturing entirely new molds, and Kennedy described their acquisition as "the entire reason [the Retro VGS] is possible".<ref>http://www.retrovgs.com/media.html</ref>

The Jaguar continues to have a very small and dedicated game development circle.
