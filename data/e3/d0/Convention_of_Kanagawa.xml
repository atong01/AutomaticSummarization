Signed under threat of force, it effectively meant the end of Japans 220-year-old policy of national seclusion (<italics><link><target>sakoku</target></link></italics>), by opening the ports of<space/><link><target>Shimoda, Shizuoka</target><part>Shimoda</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Hakodate</target></link><space/>to American vessels.<extension extension_name='ref'>Perry, Matthew Calbraith (1856).<space/><link type='external' href='http://ebook.lib.hku.hk/CTWE/B36599566/'>''Narrative of the expedition of an American Squadron to the China Seas and Japan, 1856.''</link></extension><space/>It also ensured the safety of American castaways and established the position of an American<space/><link><target>consul</target></link><space/>in Japan. The treaty also precipitated the signing of similar treaties establishing diplomatic relations with other western powers.</paragraph><heading level='2'>The isolation of Japan</heading><paragraph>Since the beginning of the seventeenth century, the Tokugawa shogunate pursued a policy of isolating the country from outside influences. Foreign trade was maintained only with the<space/><link><target>Netherlands</target><part>Dutch</part></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>Qing Dynasty</target><part>Chinese</part></link><space/>and was conducted exclusively at<space/><link><target>Nagasaki, Nagasaki</target><part>Nagasaki</part></link><space/>under a strict government monopoly. This policy had two main objectives. One was the fear that trade with western powers and the spread of Christianity would serve as a pretext for the invasion of Japan by imperialist forces, as had been the case with most of the nations of Asia. The second objective was fear that foreign trade and the wealth developed would lead to the rise of a<space/><link><target>daimyo</target></link><space/>powerful enough to overthrow the ruling<space/><link><target>Tokugawa clan</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Beasley1">W. G. Beasley,<space/><italics>The Meiji Restoration</italics>, p.74-77</extension></paragraph><paragraph>By the early nineteenth century, this policy of isolation was increasingly under challenge. In 1844, King<space/><link><target>William II of the Netherlands</target></link><space/>sent a letter urging Japan to end the isolation policy on its own before change would be forced from the outside. In 1846, an official American expedition led by Commodore<space/><link><target>James Biddle</target></link><space/>arrived in Japan asking for ports to be opened for trade, but was sent away.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Beasley2">W.

The Americans were also driven by concepts of<space/><link><target>Manifest Destiny</target></link><space/>and the desire to impose the benefits of western civilization on what they perceived as backwards Asian nations. For the Japanese standpoint, increasing contacts with foreign warships and the increasing disparity between western military technology and the Japanese feudal armies created growing concern. The Japanese had been keeping abreast of world events via information gathered from Dutch traders in<space/><link><target>Dejima</target></link><space/>and had been forewarned by the Dutch of Perrys voyage.<extension extension_name='ref'>W. G. Beasley,<space/><italics>The Meiji Restoration</italics>, p.88.</extension><space/>There was considerable internal debate in Japan on how best to meet this potential threat to Japans economic and political sovereignty.</paragraph><paragraph>Perry arrived with four warships at<space/><link><target>Uraga, Kanagawa</target><part>Uraga</part></link>, at the mouth of<space/><link><target>Edo Bay</target></link><space/>on July 8, 1853. After refusing Japanese demands that he proceed to Nagasaki, which was the designated port for foreign contact, and after threatening to continue directly on to<space/><link><target>Edo</target></link>, the nations capital and to burn it to the ground if necessary, he was allowed to land at nearby<space/><link><target>Kurihama, Yokosuka</target><part>Kurihama</part></link><space/>on July 14 and to deliver his letter.<extension extension_name='ref'>W. G. Beasley,<space/><italics>The Meiji Restoration</italics>, p.89.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Despite years of debate on the isolation policy, Perrys letter created great controversy within the highest levels of the Tokugawa shogunate. The Shogun himself,<space/><link><target>Tokugawa Ieyoshi</target></link><space/>died days after Perrys departure, and was succeeded by his sickly young son,<space/><link><target>Tokugawa Iesada</target></link>, leaving effective administration in the hands of the Council of Elders (<italics><link><target>rj</target></link></italics>) led by<space/><link><target>Abe Masahiro</target></link>. Abe felt that it was currently impossible for Japan to resist the American demands by military force, and yet was reluctant to take any action on his own authority for such an unprecedented situation. Attempting to legitimize any decision taken, Abe polled all of the<space/><link><target>daimyo</target></link><space/>for their opinions. This was the first time that the Tokugawa shogunate had allowed its decision-making to be a matter of public debate, and had the unforeseen consequence of portraying the Shogunate as weak and indecisive.<extension extension_name='ref'>J. W. Hall,<space/><italics>Japan</italics>, p.211.</extension><space/>The results of the poll also failed to provide Abe with an answer, as of the 61 known responses, 19 were in favor of accepting the American demands, and 19 were equally opposed. Of the remainder, 14 gave vague responses expressing concern of possible war, 7 suggested making temporary concessions and two advised that they would simply go along with whatever was decided.<extension extension_name='ref' name="ReferenceA">W.

Negotiations began on March 8 and proceeded for around one month. The Japanese side gave in to almost all of Perrys demands, with the exception of a commercial agreement modeled after previous American treaties with China, which Perry agreed to defer to a later time. The main controversy centered on the selection of the ports to open, with Perry adamantly rejecting Nagasaki. The treaty, written in English, Dutch, Chinese and Japanese was signed at<space/><link><target>Kanagawa-juku</target><part>Kanagawa</part></link>, adjacent to the site of the future city of<space/><link><target>Yokohama</target></link><space/>on March 31.<extension extension_name='ref' name="ReferenceA"></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Treaty of Peace and Amity (1854)</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:KanagawaTreaty.gif</target><part>thumb</part><part>English text of the Kanagawa Treaty</part></link>The &quot;JapanUS Treaty of Peace and Amity&quot; has twelve articles:<space/></paragraph><table class="wikitable"><tablerow><tablehead>Article</tablehead><tablehead>Summary</tablehead></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell><space/>I</tablecell><tablecell>Mutual peace between the United States and the Empire of Japan</tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell><space/>II</tablecell><tablecell>Opening of the ports of<space/><link><target>Shimoda, Shizuoka</target><part>Shimoda</part></link><space/>&amp;<space/><link><target>Hakodate</target></link></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell><space/>III</tablecell><tablecell>Assistance to be provided to shipwrecked American sailors</tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell><space/>IV</tablecell><tablecell>Shipwrecked sailors not to be imprisoned or mistreated</tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell><space/>V</tablecell><tablecell>Freedom of movement for temporary foreign residents in treaty ports (with limitations) .<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=980DE2D9113CE13BBC4052DFB667838E649FDE'>&quot;From Washington; The Japanese Treaty-Its Advantages and Disadvantages-The President and Col.
