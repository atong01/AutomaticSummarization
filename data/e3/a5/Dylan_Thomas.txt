'''Dylan Marlais Thomas''' (27 October 1914&nbsp;– 9 November 1953) was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] poet and writer whose works include the poems "[[Do not go gentle into that good night]]" and "[[And death shall have no dominion]]", the "Play for Voices", ''[[Under Milk Wood]]'', and stories and radio broadcasts such as ''[[A Child's Christmas in Wales]]'' and ''[[Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog]]''. He became popular in his lifetime and remained so after his premature death in New York City. In his later life he acquired a reputation, which he encouraged, as a "roistering, drunken and doomed poet".<ref name="WAEoW">{{cite book |editor1-first=John |editor1-last=Davies|editor1-link=John Davies (historian)|editor2-first=Nigel |editor2-last=Jenkins | editor2-link=Nigel Jenkins| editor3-first=Baines |editor3-last=Menna|editor4-first=Peredur I. |editor4-last=Lynch|displayeditors=4|title=The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales |year=2008 |publisher=University of Wales Press |location=Cardiff |pages=861–862|isbn=978-0-7083-1953-6}}</ref>

Thomas was born in [[Swansea]], Wales, in 1914. An undistinguished pupil, he left school at 16, becoming a journalist for a short time. Although many of his works appeared in print while he was still a teenager, it was the publication of "Light breaks where no sun shines", in 1934, that caught the attention of the literary world. While living in London, Thomas met [[Caitlin Thomas|Caitlin Macnamara]], whom he married in 1937. Their relationship was defined by alcoholism and was mutually destructive.<ref name="WAEoW"/> In the early part of his marriage, Thomas and his family lived hand-to-mouth, settling in the Welsh fishing village of [[Laugharne]].

Although Thomas was appreciated as a popular poet in his lifetime, he found earning a living as a writer difficult, which resulted in his augmenting his income with reading tours and broadcasts. His radio recordings for the [[BBC]] during the late 1940s brought him to the public's attention and he was used by the Corporation as a populist voice of the literary scene. In the 1950s, Thomas travelled to America, where his readings brought him a level of fame, and his erratic behaviour and drinking worsened. His time in America cemented Thomas's legend, and he recorded to vinyl works such as ''A Child's Christmas in Wales''. During his fourth trip to New York in 1953, Thomas became gravely ill and fell into a coma from which he did not recover. Thomas died on 9 November 1953 and his body was returned to Wales where he was buried at the village churchyard in Laugharne on 25 November 1953.

Thomas wrote exclusively in the [[English language]]. He has been acknowledged as one of the most important Welsh poets of the 20th century and noted for his original, rhythmic and ingenious use of words and imagery.  Thomas's position as one of the great modern poets has been much discussed. He remains popular with the public, who find his work accessible.

Dylan Thomas was born in [[Swansea]], on 27 October 1914, to David John Thomas (1876–1952), a teacher, and Florence Hannah (''née'' Williams) (1882–1958), a [[seamstress]].

Of the 90 poems he published, half were written during these years.<ref Name="ONDB"/>

In his free time, he joined the amateur dramatic group at the [[Dylan Thomas Theatre|Little Theatre]] in [[Mumbles]], visited the cinema in Uplands, took walks along [[Swansea Bay]], and frequented Swansea's [[pub]]s, especially the Antelope and the Mermaid Hotels in Mumbles.<ref>{{cite book|title=Dylan Thomas: The Pubs|first=Jeff|last=Towns|year=2013|publisher=Y Lolfa|isbn=978-1-84771-693-4|pages=73–84}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Where+Dylan+Thomas+'communed+with+his+legendary+creatures'.-a0145458555|title=Where Dylan Thomas 'communed with his legendary creatures'|first=Robin|last=Turner|publisher=thefreelibrary.com|work=Western Mail|date=6 May 2006|accessdate=27 July 2012}}</ref> In the [[Kardomah Café]], close to the newspaper office in Castle Street, he met his creative contemporaries, including his friend the poet [[Vernon Watkins]].

===1933–1939===
Thomas was a teenager when many of the poems for which he became famous were published: "[[And death shall have no dominion]]", "Before I Knocked" and "The Force That Through the Green Fuse Drives the Flower". "And death shall have no dominion" appeared in the ''[[New English Weekly]]'' in May 1933.<ref Name="ONDB"/> When "Light breaks where no sun shines" appeared in ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'' in 1934, it caught the attention of three senior figures in literary London, [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Geoffrey Grigson]] and [[Stephen Spender]].<ref Name="CUP">{{cite book|title=Cambridge Book of English Verse, 1939–1975 |year=1976 |first=Alan Norman |last=Bold |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=60 |isbn=978-0-521-09840-3}}</ref><ref>Ferris (1989), p. 91</ref><ref>Ferris (1989), p. 102</ref> They contacted Thomas and his first poetry volume, ''18 Poems'', was published in December 1934.

In early 1936, Thomas met [[Caitlin Thomas|Caitlin Macnamara]] (1913–1994), a 22-year-old blonde-haired, blue-eyed dancer of Irish descent.

By the late 1930s, Thomas was embraced as the "poetic herald" for a group of English poets, the [[New Apocalyptics]].<ref name="Jackaman">{{cite book|title=The Course of English Surrealist Poetry Since The 1930s|url=http://books.google.com/?id=DV9_6DAOSscC&pg=PA179&dq=%22dylan+Thomas%22+%22+d+h+lawrence%22#v=onepage&q=%22dylan%20Thomas%22%20%22%20d%20h%20lawrence%22&f=false|first=Rob|last=Jackaman|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press|year=1989|page=188|isbn=0-88946-932-6|accessdate=26 July 2012}}</ref> Thomas refused to align himself with them and declined to sign their manifesto.

===Wartime, 1939–1945===
In 1939 ''The Map of Love'' appeared as a collection of 16 poems and seven of the 20 short stories published by Thomas in magazines since 1934.<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 177</ref> Ten stories in his next book, ''Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog'' (1940), were based less on lavish fantasy than ''The Map of Love'' and more on real life romances featuring himself in Wales.<ref Name="ONDB"/> Sales of both books were poor, resulting in Thomas living on meagre fees from writing and reviewing. At this time he borrowed heavily from friends and acquaintances.<ref>Ferris (1989), pp. 178–180</ref> Hounded by creditors, Thomas and his family left Laugharne in July 1940 and moved to the home of critic John Davenport in [[Marshfield, Gloucestershire]].{{refn|Davenport was, for many years, literary editor of ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper. "From July to November 1940 Dylan Thomas and his family stayed at 'The Malting House' 78 High Street, Marshfield, near Chippenham in Gloucestershire, with the critic John Davenport and his American painter wife, Clement, who kept an open house for musicians and writers. The composers Lennox Berkeley and Arnold Cooke, the music critic William Glock and writer Antonia White, joined them."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewordtravels.com/dylan-thomas-in-marshfield.html|title=Dylan Thomas in Marshfield|publisher=thewordtravels.com|accessdate=10 August 2012}}</ref>|group="nb"}} There Thomas collaborated with Davenport on the satire ''The Death of the King's Canary'', though due to fears of libel the work was not published until 1976.<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 345</ref><ref>Read (1964), p. 102</ref>

At the outset of the [[Second World War]], Thomas was worried about conscription and referred to his ailment as "an unreliable lung". Coughing sometimes confined him to bed and he had a history of bringing up blood and mucus.<ref>Thomas, D. N. (2008), p. 11</ref> After initially seeking employment in a [[reserved occupation]], he managed to be classified Grade III, which meant that he would be among the last to be called up for service.{{refn|The reason for being graded unsuitable for military service is vague. His mother said it was due to "punctured lungs", while Vernon Watkins believed it was "scarred" lungs. Neither statement is corroborated by Thomas's autopsy, although Milton Helpern found  some [[emphysema]] probably caused by chain-smoking.<ref>{{harvnb|Ferris|1989|pp=178–179}}</ref>|group="nb"}} Saddened to see his friends going on active service, he continued drinking and struggled to support his family. He wrote begging letters to random literary figures asking for support, a plan he hoped would provide a long-term regular income.<ref Name="ONDB"/> Thomas supplemented his income by writing scripts for the [[BBC]], which not only gave him additional earnings but also provided evidence that he was producing essential war work.<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 183</ref>

In February 1941, [[Swansea Blitz|Swansea was bombed]] by the [[Luftwaffe]] in a "three nights' blitz". Castle Street was one of many streets that suffered badly; rows of shops, including the Kardomah Café, were destroyed. Thomas walked through the bombed-out shell of the town centre with his friend Bert Trick. Upset at the sight, he concluded: "Our Swansea is dead".<ref>{{cite book|title=Dylan Remembered  |volume=2 1935–1953 |first= David N. |last=Thomas|publisher= Seren|year=2004 |page=92|isbn=978-1-85411-363-4}}</ref> Soon after the bombing raids, Thomas wrote a radio play, ''Return Journey Home'', which described the café as being "razed to the snow".<ref>"Thomas, Dylan."

In May 1941, Thomas and Caitlin moved to London, leaving their son with his grandmother at [[Blashford]] in [[Hampshire]].<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 187</ref> Thomas hoped to find employment in the film industry and wrote to the director of the films division of the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] (MOI).<ref Name="ONDB"/> After being rebuffed he found work with Strand Films providing him with his first regular income since the ''Daily Post''.<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 188</ref> Strand produced films for the MOI; Thomas scripted at least five films in 1942, ''This Is Colour'' (a history of the British dyeing industry) and ''New Towns For Old'' (on post-war reconstruction).

===Broadcasting years 1945–1949===
Although Thomas had previously written for the BBC, it was a minor source of income and the occurrences intermittent. In 1943 he wrote and recorded a 15-minute talk entitled "Reminiscences of Childhood" for the Welsh BBC. In December 1944 he recorded ''Quite Early One Morning'' (produced by [[Aneirin Talfan Davies]], again for the Welsh BBC) but when Davies offered it for national broadcast BBC London turned it down.<ref name="Ferris 1989 213"/> On 31 August 1945 the [[BBC Home Service]] broadcast ''Quite Early One Morning'', and in the three years beginning October 1945, Thomas made over a hundred broadcasts for the corporation.<ref>Read (1964), p. 115</ref> Thomas was employed not only for his poetry readings, but for discussions and critiques.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dylanthomas.com/dylan/dylans-work/dylan-thomas-broadcasts/|title=Dylan Thomas&nbsp;– The Broadcasts|publisher=dylanthomas.com|accessdate=22 July 2014}}</ref><ref>FitzGibbon (1965), pp. 395–399</ref>

By late September 1945 the Thomases had left Wales and were living with various friends in London.<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 216</ref> The publication of ''[[Deaths and Entrances]]'' in 1946 was a turning point for Thomas.

In the second half of 1945, Thomas began reading for the BBC Radio programme, ''Book of Verse'', broadcast weekly to the Far East<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 218</ref> providing Thomas with a regular income and bringing him into contact with [[Louis MacNeice]], a congenial drinking companion whose advice Thomas cherished.<ref name="Read 1964, p. 116">Read (1964), p. 116</ref> On 29 September 1946, the BBC began transmitting the ''[[BBC Third Programme|Third Programme]]'', a high-culture network which  provided opportunities for Thomas.<ref>Ferris (1989), pp. 219–220</ref> He appeared in the play ''Comus'' for Third Programme, the day after the network launched, and his rich, sonorous voice led to character parts, including the lead in Aeschylus' ''[[Agamemnon (play)|Agamemnon]]'' and Satan in an adaptation of ''[[Paradise Lost]]''.<ref name="Read 1964, p. 116"/><ref>FitzGibbon (1965), pp. 396–397</ref> Thomas remained a popular guest on radio talk shows for the BBC who regarded him as "useful should a younger generation poet be needed".<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 219</ref> He had an uneasy relationship with BBC management and a staff job was never an option, with drinking cited as the problem.<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 221</ref> Despite this, Thomas became a familiar radio voice and within Britain was "in every sense a celebrity".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.questia.com/library/1G1-18167167/the-ambiguous-reversal-of-dylan-thomas-s-in-country|title=The Ambiguous Reversal of Dylan Thomas's "In Country Sleep." |first=James J.|last=Balakier|year=1996|work=Papers on Language & Literature|volume=32|accessdate=10 August 2012|publisher=questia.com}}</ref>

Thomas visited the home of historian [[A. J. P. Taylor]] in [[Disley]]. Although Taylor disliked him intensely, he stayed for a month, drinking "on a monumental scale", up to 15 or 20 pints of beer a day. In late 1946 Thomas turned up at the Taylors' again, this time homeless and with Caitlin. Margaret Taylor let them take up residence in the garden summerhouse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/sep/02/historybooks.books|title=Oxford affairs|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=17 November 2014}}</ref> In May 1949 Thomas and his family moved to his final home, the [[Dylan Thomas Boathouse|Boat House]] at Laugharne purchased for him at a cost of £2,500 in April 1949 by Margaret Taylor.<ref>Ferris (1989), p.239</ref> Thomas acquired a garage a hundred yards from the house on a cliff ledge which he turned into his writing shed, and where he wrote several of his most acclaimed poems.<ref name="Writing shed">{{cite web|url=http://www.dylanthomasboathouse.com/english/boathouse/shed.html |title=The Writing Shed| accessdate=25 July 2012|work=dylanthomasboathouse.com}}</ref> Just before moving into there, Thomas rented "Pelican House" opposite his regular drinking den, [[Brown's Hotel (Laugharne)|Brown's Hotel]], for his parents<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 240</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/nature/sites/walking/pages/sw_laugharne.shtml|title=Laugharne|accessdate=27 July 2012|publisher=BBC}}</ref> who lived there from 1949 until 1953.

On returning to Britain Thomas began work on two further poems, "In the white giant's thigh", which he read on the ''Third Programme'' in September 1950, and the incomplete "In country heaven".<ref>Ferris (1989), pp. 279–280</ref> 1950 is also believed{{by whom|date=July 2015}} to be the year that he began work on 'Under Milk Wood', under the working title 'The Town That Was Mad'.<ref>Lycett (2003), p.395</ref> The task of seeing this work through to production was assigned to the BBC's [[Douglas Cleverdon]], who had been responsible for casting Thomas in 'Paradise Lost'.<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 280</ref> Despite Cleverdon's urges, the script slipped from Thomas's priorities and in early 1951 he took a trip to [[Iran]] to work on a film for the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]]. The film was never made, with Thomas returning to Wales in February, though his time there allowed him to provide a few minutes of material for a BBC documentary entitled 'Persian Oil'.<ref>Ferris (1989), pp. 281–282</ref> Early that year Thomas wrote two poems, which Ferris describes as "unusually blunt"; the ribald "Lament" and an ode, in the form of a [[villanelle]], to his dying father "[[Do not go gentle into that good night]]".<ref>Ferris (1989), pp. 282–283</ref>

Despite a range of wealthy patrons, including Margaret Taylor, Princess Marguerite [[Caetani]] and Marged Howard-Stepney, Thomas was still in financial difficulty, and he wrote several begging letters to notable literary figures including the likes of [[T. S. Eliot]].<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 285</ref> Taylor was not keen on Thomas taking another trip to the United States, and thought that if Thomas had a permanent address in London he would be able to gain steady work there.<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 287</ref> She bought a property, 54 Delancey Street, in [[Camden Town]], and in late 1951 Thomas and Caitlin lived in the basement flat.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://openplaques.org/plaques/592 | title= Dylan Thomas blue plaque in London | publisher= openplaques.org | accessdate= 4 May 2013}}</ref> Thomas would describe the flat as his "London house of horror" and did not return there after his 1952 tour of America.<ref>{{cite book |title= Literary London: A Street by Street Exploration of the Capital's Literary Heritage |first= Ed|last= Glinert|isbn= 978-0-14-190159-6|publisher= Penguin|year= 2007}}</ref>

Thomas undertook a second tour of the United States in 1952, this time with Caitlin - after she had discovered he had been unfaithful on his earlier trip.<ref>Ferris (1989), pp.&nbsp;286–287, p. 296</ref> They drank heavily, and Thomas began to suffer with [[gout]] and [[Respiratory distress|lung problems]]. The second tour was the most intensive of the four, taking in 46 engagements.<ref>FitzGibbon (1965), pp. 403–410</ref> The trip also resulted in Thomas recording his first poetry to vinyl, which [[Caedmon Audio|Caedmon Records]] released in America later that year.<ref>Ferris (1989) p. 301</ref> One of his works recorded during this time, ''[[A Child's Christmas in Wales]]'',  became his most popular prose work in America.<ref name="Ferris 1989, p. 214"/> The original 1952 recording of ''A Child's Christmas in Wales'' was a 2008 selection for the [[United States National Recording Registry]], stating that it is "credited with launching the [[audiobook]] industry in the United States".<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/registry/nrpb-2008reg.html |title= The National Recording Registry 2008 | accessdate= 16 July 2012 | work= National Recording Preservation Board of the Library of Congress | publisher= The Library of Congress}}</ref>

In April 1953 Thomas returned alone for a third tour of America.<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 316</ref> He performed a "work in progress" version of ''Under Milk Wood'', solo, for the first time at [[Harvard University]] on 3 May.<ref>FitzGibbon (1965), p. 385</ref> A week later the work was performed with a full cast at the Poetry Centre in New York. He met the deadline only after being locked in a room by Brinnin's assistant, Liz Reitell, and was still editing the script on the afternoon of the performance; its last lines were handed to the actors as they put on their makeup.<ref>Thomas, D. N. (2008), p. 33</ref><ref Name="Bold61"/> In the wake of the play's US success, the composer [[Stravinsky]] invited Thomas to write a libretto for an opera.<ref Name="Bold61"/> Thomas spent the last nine or ten days of his third tour in New York mostly in the company of Reitell, with whom he had an affair.<ref name="Ferris1989p321">Ferris (1989), p. 321</ref> During this time Thomas fractured his arm falling down a flight of stairs when drunk.

After returning home, Thomas worked on ''Under Milk Wood'' in Wales before sending the original manuscript to Douglas Cleverdon on 15 October 1953.

And death shall have no dominion.
Dead men naked they shall be one
With the man in the wind and the west moon;
When their bones are picked clean and the clean bones gone,
They shall have stars at elbow and foot;
Though they go mad they shall be sane,
Though they sink through the sea they shall rise again
Though lovers be lost love shall not;
And death shall have no dominion.

Thomas arrived in New York on 20 October 1953 to undertake another tour of poetry reading and talks, organised by Brinnin.<ref group="nb">Although both agree that he left London on 19 October, biographers Ferris and FitzGibbon disagree on his arrival date. Ferris in his 1989 work gives Thomas's arrival in New York as 19 October (p. 329) while FitzGibbon writing in 1965 states 20 October (p. 391).</ref> He was ill, complaining of chest trouble and gout while still in Britain, though there is no record he received medical treatment for either condition.<ref name="Ferris1989p315">Ferris (1989), p. 315</ref><ref group="nb">David N. Thomas (2008) writes: "He knew that he should see a doctor but feared that he would be pronounced unfit and the trip cancelled". Thomas was financially committed to going.</ref> He was in a melancholy mood about the trip and his health was poor, relying on an inhaler to aid his breathing and there were reports that he was suffering from [[Syncope (medicine)|blackouts]].<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 327</ref><ref name="Thomas2008p57">Thomas, D.

(2008), pp. 46–47 and notes</ref>

His first appearance was planned to be at a rehearsal of ''Under Milk Wood'' at the Poetry Centre. Brinnin, who was director of the Poetry Centre, did not travel to New York but remained in [[Boston]] to write.<ref name="Fatal Neglect">{{cite web|url=http://www.freewebs.com/deathofdylanthomas/|title=Fatal Neglect: Who Killed Dylan Thomas?|first=David N.|last=Thomas|accessdate=31 July 2012|publisher=freewebs.com}}</ref> He handed responsibility to his assistant, Liz Reitell, who was keen to see Thomas for the first time since their three-week romance early in the year. She met Thomas at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|Idlewild Airport]] and was shocked at his appearance, as he "looked pale, delicate and shaky, not his usual robust self."<ref name="Thomas2008p57"/> Thomas told her he had had a terrible week, had missed her terribly and wanted to go to bed with her. Despite Reitell's previous misgivings about their relationship, they spent the rest of the day and night together. After being taken by Reitell to check in at the [[Hotel Chelsea|Chelsea Hotel]], Thomas took the first rehearsal of ''Under Milk Wood''. They then went to the [[White Horse Tavern (New York City)|White Horse Tavern]] in Greenwich Village, before returning to the Chelsea Hotel.<ref>Thomas, D. N. (2008)</ref>

The next day Reitell invited him to her apartment but he declined. They went sight-seeing, but Thomas was unwell and retired to his bed for the rest of the afternoon. Reitell gave him half a [[Grain (unit)|grain]] (32.4 [[milligram]]s) of [[phenobarbitone]] to help him sleep and spent the night at the hotel with him. Two days later, on 23 October, Herb Hannum, a friend from an earlier trip, noticed how sick Thomas looked and suggested an appointment with Feltenstein before the performances of ''Under Milk Wood'' that evening. Feltenstein administered injections and Thomas made it through the two performances, but collapsed immediately afterwards.<ref>FitzGibbon (1965), p. 392</ref> Reitell later said that Feltenstein was "rather a wild doctor who thought injections would cure anything".<ref>Ferris (1989), pp. 336–337</ref>

A turning point came on 2 November. [[Smog|Air pollution]] in New York had risen significantly and exacerbated chest illnesses, such as Thomas had.

Reitell became increasingly concerned and telephoned Feltenstein for advice. He suggested she get male assistance, so she called upon the painter Jack Heliker, who arrived before 11&nbsp;pm.<ref name="Todd"/> At midnight on 5 November, Thomas's breathing became more difficult and his face turned blue.<ref name="Todd"/> An ambulance was summoned.<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 338</ref><ref group="nb">Ruthven Todd states in his letter dated 23 November that the police were called, who then called the ambulance, while Ferris in his 1989 biography writes that Feltenstein was summoned again and called the ambulance.

Thomas was admitted to the emergency ward at [[Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center|St Vincent's Hospital]] at 1:58&nbsp;am.

===Aftermath===
[[File:Geoff Charles visits Laugharne with his camera, Dylan Thomas country (15206921025).jpg|thumb|Dylan Thomas' writing shed in [[Laugharne]] in 1955, largely untouched since his death]]
Rumours circulated of a [[brain haemorrhage]], followed by competing reports that he had been mugged and even that he had drunk himself to death.<ref Name="BBC"/> Later, there was speculation about drugs and [[diabetes]]. At the [[post-mortem]], the pathologist found three causes of death&nbsp;– pneumonia, brain swelling and a fatty liver. Despite his heavy drinking his liver showed no sign of [[cirrhosis]].<ref Name="History">{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2004/nov/27/books.booksnews |title=History has Dylan Thomas dying from drink.

Dylan's legacy as the "doomed poet" was cemented with the publication of Brinnin's 1955 biography ''Dylan Thomas in America'', which focuses on his last few years and paints a picture of him as a drunk and a philanderer.<ref name="Poetry Foundation">{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/dylan-thomas |title=Dylan Thomas: 1914–1953|work=Poetry Foundation|accessdate=21 July 2012}}</ref> Later biographies are critical of Brinnin's view, especially his coverage of Thomas's death. David Thomas in ''Fatal Neglect: Who Killed Dylan Thomas?'' claims that Brinnin, along with Reitell and Feltenstein, were culpable.<ref name="Fatal Neglect"/> FitzGibbon's 1965 biography ignores Thomas's heavy drinking and skims over his death, giving just two pages in his detailed book to Thomas's demise. Ferris in his 1989 biography includes Thomas's heavy drinking, but is more critical of those around him in his final days and does not draw the conclusion that he drank himself to death. Feltenstein's role and actions have been criticised by many sources, especially his incorrect diagnosis of [[delirium tremens]] and the high dose of morphine he administered.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Dylan Thomas: From Grave to Cradle |series=Arena |airdate=16 May 2009 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0078mv0|network=BBC |season=13 |number= |credits=Williams, Nigel (presenter)}}</ref>  Dr B. W. Murphy and Dr C.

==Poetry==

===Poetic style and influences===
Thomas' refusal to align with any literary group or movement has made him and his work difficult to categorize.<ref name="Poetry Foundation"/>  Although influenced by the modern symbolism and surrealism movement he refused to follow its creed.<ref name="Poetry Foundation"/> Instead Thomas is viewed as part of the [[modernism]] and [[romanticism]] movements, though attempts to pigeon-hole him within a particular [[Neo-romanticism|neo-romantic]] school have been unsuccessful.<ref name="Poetry Foundation"/> [[Elder Olson]], in his 1954 critical study of Thomas's poetry, wrote "...&nbsp;a further characteristic which distinguished Thomas's work from that of other poets. It was unclassifiable." Olson continued that in a postmodern age that continually attempted to demand that poetry have social reference, none could be found in Thomas's work, and that his work was so obscure that critics could not explicate it.<ref>Olson (1954) p.2</ref>

Thomas's verbal style played against strict verse forms, such as in the [[villanelle]] "Do not go gentle into that good night". His images were carefully ordered in a patterned sequence, and his major theme was the unity of all life, the continuing process of life and death and new life that linked the generations. Thomas saw biology as a magical transformation producing unity out of diversity, and in his poetry sought a poetic ritual to celebrate this unity. He saw men and women locked in cycles of growth, love, [[procreation]], new growth, death, and new life. Therefore, each image engenders its opposite. Thomas derived his closely woven, sometimes self-contradictory images from the Bible, [[Welsh mythology|Welsh folklore]], preaching, and [[Sigmund Freud]].<ref>{{cite book|editor1-first=M. H.|editor1-last=Abrams |editor2-first=Stephen |editor2-last=Greenblatt |title=The Norton Anthology of English Literature|location=New York |publisher=W.W. Norton |pages=2705–2706}}</ref>

Thomas's early poetry was noted for its verbal density, [[alliteration]], [[sprung rhythm]] and [[internal rhyme]], and he was described by some critics as having been influenced by the English poet [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]].<ref name="WAEoW"/> This is attributed to Hopkins, who taught himself Welsh and who used sprung verse, bringing some features of Welsh poetic [[Metre (poetry)|metre]] into his work.<ref name="Ferris(1989)115">Ferris (1889), p. 115</ref> When [[Henry Treece]] wrote to Thomas comparing his style to that of Hopkins, Thomas wrote back denying any such influence.<ref name="Ferris(1989)115"/> One poet Thomas greatly admired, and who is regarded as an influence, was [[Thomas Hardy]].<ref name="WAEoW"/><ref name="Ferris(1989)259">Ferris (1889), pp.&nbsp;259–260</ref> When Thomas travelled in America, he recited Hardy's work in his readings.<ref name="Ferris(1989)259"/>

Other poets from whom critics believe Thomas drew influence include [[James Joyce]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and [[D. H. Lawrence]]. [[William York Tindall]], in his 1962 study, ''A Reader's Guide to Dylan Thomas'', finds comparison between Thomas's and Joyce's wordplay, while he notes the themes of rebirth and nature are common to the works of Lawrence and Thomas.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Reader's Guide to Dylan Thomas|first=William York |last=Tindall|authorlink = William York Tindall |year=1962|publisher=Syracuse University Press|location=New York|page=14 |accessdate=26 July 2012 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=EVIGMyDkaNQC&pg=PA14&dq=%22dylan+Thomas%22+%22+d+h+lawrence%22#v=onepage&q=%22dylan%20Thomas%22%20%22%20d%20h%20lawrence%22&f=false|isbn=978-0-8156-0401-3}}</ref><ref group="nb">In reply to a student's questions in 1951, Thomas stated: "I do not think that Joyce has had any hand at all in my writing; certainly his ''Ulysses'' has not. On the other hand, I cannot deny on the shaping of some of my ''Portrait'' stories might owe something to Joyce's stories in the volume, ''Dubliners''. But then ''Dubliners'' was a pioneering work in the world of the short story, and no good storywriter since can have failed, in some way, however little, to have benefited by it." FitzGibbon (1965), p. 370</ref> Although Thomas described himself as the "Rimbaud of Cwmdonkin Drive", he stated that the phrase "Swansea's Rimbaud" was coined by poet [[Roy Campbell (poet)|Roy Campbell]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/dylanthomas-kunitz-3524|title=Review of Dylan Thomas: His Life & Work by John Ackerman|first=Daniel|last=Kunitz|accessdate=20 July 2012|date=September 1996}}</ref><ref>Ferris (1989), p. 186</ref><ref group="nb">In his notes to page 186, Ferris (1989) states that in a [[BBC Home Service]] programme aired in 1950, ''Poetic License'', in which Campbell and Thomas appeared, Thomas said "I won't forgive you for the Swansea's Rimbaud, because you called me that first Roy".</ref> Critics have explored the connection between the creation of Thomas's mythological pasts into his works such as "The Orchards", which Ann Elizabeth Mayer believes reflects the Welsh myths of the ''Mabinogion''.<ref name="UMW Chron"/><ref>{{cite book|title=Artists in Dylan Thomas's Prose Works: Adam Naming and Aesop Fabling|first=Ann Elizabeth|last=Mayer |year=1995|publisher=McGill-Queens |location=|page=31|accessdate=26 July 2012 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=N89BWqRT0IYC&pg=PA31&dq=%22dylan+Thomas%22+%22welsh+myth%22#v=onepage&q=%22dylan%20Thomas%22%20%22welsh%20myth%22&f=false|isbn=978-0-7735-1306-8}}</ref><ref group="nb">"The Orchard" makes reference to the 'Black Book of Llareggub'. Here Thomas makes links with religion and the mythic Wales of the [[White Book of Rhydderch]] and the [[Black Book of Carmarthen]].</ref>
Thomas's poetry is notable for its musicality,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/poetryseason/poets/dylan_thomas.shtml |title=Creating the Thomas myth|publisher=BBC|accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref> most clear in "Fern Hill", "In Country Sleep", "Ballad of the Long-legged Bait" and "In the White Giant's Thigh" from ''Under Milk Wood''.

Thomas once confided that the poems which had most influenced him were ''Mother Goose'' rhymes which his parents taught him when he was a child:
<blockquote>
I should say I wanted to write poetry in the beginning because I had fallen in love with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance&nbsp;... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Poetic Terms |year=2003| last1=Myers |first1=Jack |last2=Wukasch|first2=Don |publisher=University of North Texas Press, U.S. | isbn=1-57441-166-7}}</ref>
</blockquote>

Thomas was an accomplished writer of [[prose poetry]], with collections such as ''Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog'' (1940) and ''Quite Early One Morning'' (1954) showing he was capable of writing moving short stories.<ref name="WAEoW"/> His first published prose work was ''After the Fair'', printed in The New English Weekly on 15 March 1934.<ref>{{cite book|title=Gurdjieff and Orage: Brothers in Elysium|last=Taylor|first=Paul Beekman|isbn=978-1-57863-128-5|year=2001|publisher=Weiser Books|page=193}}</ref> Jacob Korg believes that Thomas's fiction work can be classified into two main bodies, vigorous fantasies in a poetic style and, after 1939, more straightforward narratives.<ref name="Korg Prose">Korg (1965), pp.&nbsp;154–182</ref> Korg surmises that Thomas approached his prose writing as an alternate poetic form, which allowed him to produce complex, involuted narratives that do not allow the reader to rest.<ref name="Korg Prose"/>

Not for the proud man apart
From the raging moon I write
On these spindrift pages

Nor heed my craft or art.

Thomas disliked being regarded as a provincial poet, and decried any notion of 'Welshness' in his poetry.<ref name="Ferris(1989)115"/> When he wrote to [[Stephen Spender]] in 1952, thanking him for a review of his ''Collected Poems'', he added "Oh, & I forgot. I'm not influenced by Welsh bardic poetry. I can't read Welsh."<ref name="Ferris(1989)115"/> Despite this his work was rooted in the geography of Wales. Thomas acknowledged that he returned to Wales when he had difficulty writing, and John Ackerman argues that "His inspiration and imagination were rooted in his Welsh background".<ref name="geoforum">{{cite journal|title=Cultural policy and place promotion: Swansea and Dylan Thomas|first1=Helen|last1=Watkins|first2=David|last2=Herbert |date=26 July 2002|work=Geoforum 2003|page=254}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Welsh Dylan: An Exhibition to Mark the Twentieth Anniversary of the Poet's Death|first=John|last=Ackerman|year=1973|publisher=Welsh Arts Council|location=Cardiff|page=27|isbn=}}</ref> Caitlin Thomas wrote that he worked "in a fanatically narrow groove, although there was nothing narrow about the depth and understanding of his feelings.

Head of Programmes Wales at the BBC, [[Aneirin Talfan Davies]], who commissioned several of Thomas's early radio talks, believed that the poet's "whole attitude is that of the medieval bards." [[Kenneth O. Morgan]] counter-argues that it is a 'difficult enterprise' to find traces of ''[[cynghanedd]]'' (harmony) or ''[[cerdd dafod]]'' (tongue-craft) in Thomas's poetry.<ref name="Morgan">{{cite book |last=Morgan |first=Kenneth O. |title=A Rebirth of a Nation |year=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford|pages=263–265 |isbn=0-19-821760-9}}</ref> Instead he believes his work, especially his earlier more autobiographical poems, are rooted in a changing country which echoes the Welshness of the past and the [[Anglicisation]] of the new industrial nation: "rural and urban, chapel-going and profane, Welsh and English, Unforgiving and deeply compassionate."<ref name="Morgan"/> Fellow poet and critic [[Glyn Jones (Welsh writer)|Glyn Jones]] believed that any traces of ''cynghanedd'' in Thomas's work was accidental, although he felt Thomas consciously employed one element of Welsh metrics; that of counting syllables per line instead of [[Foot (prosody)|feet]].{{refn|Jones notes that in Thomas's early work, such as ''Eighteen Poems'' that the [[Iamb (foot)|iambic foot]] was the rhythmic basis of his line, while in his later work a count of syllables replaced a count of [[Accent (poetry)|accents]].<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1968|pp=179–180}}</ref>|group="nb"}} [[Constantine Fitzgibbon|Constantine FitzGibbon]], Thomas's first in-depth biographer, wrote "No major English poet has ever been as Welsh as Dylan".<ref>FitzGibbon (1965), p. 19</ref>

Although Thomas had a deep connection with Wales, he disliked [[Welsh nationalism]]. He once wrote, "[[Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau|Land of my fathers]], and my fathers can keep it".<ref name="FitzGibbon 10">FitzGibbon (1965), p. 10</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2003/oct/25/unitedkingdom.guardiansaturdaytravelsection |title=To begin at the beginning&nbsp;... |date=25 October 2003|accessdate=27 July 2012|first=Nick|last=Wroe|publisher=guardian.co.uk}}</ref> While often attributed to Thomas himself, this line actually comes from the character Owen Morgan-Vaughan, in the [[screenplay]] Thomas wrote for the 1948 British melodrama ''[[The Three Weird Sisters]]'' (Screenplays 299). Robert Pocock, a friend from the BBC, recalled "I only once heard Dylan express an opinion on Welsh Nationalism. He used three words. Two of them were Welsh Nationalism."<ref name="FitzGibbon 10"/> Although not expressed as strongly, Glyn Jones believed that he and Thomas's friendship cooled in the later years as he had not 'rejected enough' of the elements that Thomas disliked&nbsp;– "Welsh nationalism and a sort of hill farm morality".<ref>Jones (1968), p. 198</ref> Apologetically, in a letter to [[Keidrych Rhys]], editor of literary magazine ''[[Wales (magazine)|Wales]]'', Thomas's father wrote that he was "afraid Dylan isn't much of a Welshman".<ref name="FitzGibbon 10"/> Though FitzGibbon asserts that Thomas's negativity towards Welsh nationalism was fostered by his father's hostility towards the Welsh language.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1966/feb/03/dylan-thomas/?pagination=false|title=Dylan Thomas, in response |first=Constantine|last=FitzGibbon|publisher=nybooks.com|date=3 February 1966|accessdate=28 July 2012}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
Thomas's work and stature as a poet have been much debated by critics and biographers since his death. Critical studies have been clouded by Thomas's personality and mythology, especially his drunken persona and death in New York. When [[Seamus Heaney]] gave an [[Oxford University|Oxford]] lecture on the poet he opened by addressing the assembly, "Dylan Thomas is now as much a case history as a chapter in the history of poetry", querying how 'Thomas the Poet' is one of his forgotten attributes.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=40548687|title=Dylan the Durable? On Dylan Thomas|first=Seamus|last=Heaney|year=1993|pages=66–85|work=[[Salmagundi (magazine)|Salmagundi]]|publisher=jstor.org|issue=100}}</ref> [[David Holbrook]], who has written three books about Thomas, stated in his 1962 publication ''Llareggub Revisited'', "the strangest feature of Dylan Thomas's notoriety-not that he is bogus, but that attitudes to poetry attached themselves to him which not only threaten the prestige, effectiveness and accessibility to English poetry, but also destroyed his true voice and, at last, him."<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=U0harY5GMjUC&pg=PA233&lpg=PA233&dq=%22Dylan+Thomas%22+criticism+holbrook#v=onepage&q=%22Dylan%20Thomas%22%20criticism%20holbrook&f=false|title=Powers of Being: David Holbrook and his Work|year=1995|editor-first=Edwin|editor-last=Webb|chapter="The Petals of the Man": The Relationship of David Holbrooks Criticism to his Poetry|first=John|last=Ferns|page=234|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press |accessdate=28 July 2012|isbn=978-0-8386-3529-2}}</ref>

Many critics have argued that Thomas's work is too narrow and that he suffers from verbal extravagance.<ref name="Wroe 2003">{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2003/nov/15/poetry.highereducation|title=An insult to the brain|first=Nicholas|last=Wroe|publisher=guardian.co.uk|accessdate=27 July 2012|date=15 November 2003}}</ref> Those that have championed his work have found the criticism baffling. [[Robert Lowell]] wrote in 1947, "Nothing could be more wrongheaded, than the English disputes about Dylan Thomas's greatness&nbsp;... He is a dazzling obscure writer who can be enjoyed without understanding."<ref name="LRB 04-03-04">{{cite web|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n05/adam-phillips/a-terrible-thing-thank-god|title=A Terrible Thing, Thank God|first=Adam|last=Philips|publisher=lrb.co.uk|accessdate=27 July 2012|date=4 March 2004}}</ref> [[Kenneth Rexroth]] said, on reading ''Eighteen Poems'', "The reeling excitement of a poetry-intoxicated schoolboy smote the Philistine as hard a blow with one small book as [[Algernon Charles Swinburne|Swinburne]] had with ''Poems and Ballads''."<ref>{{cite web|title=Dylan Marlais Thomas| work=Encyclopedia of World Biography|year=2004 |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=31 July 2012|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Dylan_Thomas.aspx}}</ref> [[Philip Larkin]] in a letter to [[Kingsley Amis]] in 1948, wrote that "no one can 'stick words into us like pins'...&nbsp;like he [Thomas] can", but followed that by stating that he "doesn't use his words to any advantage".<ref name="LRB 04-03-04"/> Amis was far harsher, finding little of merit in his work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v22/n11/ian-hamilton/sorry-to-go-on-like-this |title=Sorry to go on like this |first=Ian|last=Hamilton|publisher=lrb.co.uk|accessdate=27 July 2012|date=1 June 2000}}</ref> In 1956, the publication of the anthology ''New Lines'' featuring works by the British collective [[The Movement (literature)|The Movement]], which included Amis and Larkin amongst its number, set out a vision of modern poetry that was damning towards the poets of the 1940s. Thomas's work in particular was criticised. David Lodge, writing about The Movement in 1981 stated "Dylan Thomas was made to stand for everything they detest, verbal obscurity, metaphysical pretentiousness, and romantic rhapsodizing".<ref>{{cite book|last=Lodge|first=David|title= Working with Structuralism|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul Books. |year=1981|isbn=978-0-7100-0658-5|page=9|format=pdf|url=http://www.iasj.net/iasj?func=fulltext&aId=73337}}</ref>

Despite criticism by sections of academia, Thomas's work has been embraced by readers more so than many of his contemporaries, and is one of the few modern poets whose name is recognised by the general public.<ref name="Wroe 2003"/> Several of his poems have passed into the cultural mainstream, and his work has been used by authors, musicians and film and television writers.<ref name="Wroe 2003"/> The BBC Radio programme, [[Desert Island Discs]], in which guests usually choose their favourite songs, has heard 50 participants select a Dylan Thomas recording.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/find-a-castaway?q=Dylan+Thomas&type=music| title=Desert Island Discs: Dylan Thomas |accessdate=14 December 2014|publisher=BBC}}</ref> John Goodby states that this popularity with the reading public allows Thomas's work to be classed as vulgar and common.<ref name="Goodby Preface">Goodby (2013), pp.&nbsp;6–8</ref> He also cites that despite a brief period during the 1960s when Thomas was considered a cultural icon, that the poet has been marginalized in critical circles due to his exuberance, in both life and work, and his refusal to know his place. Goodby believes that Thomas has been mainly snubbed since the 1970s and has become "...&nbsp;an embarrassment to twentieth-century poetry criticism"<ref name="Goodby Preface"/> his work failing to fit standard narratives and is thus ignored rather than studied.<ref>Goodby (2013), p.15</ref>
