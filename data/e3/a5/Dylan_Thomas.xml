An undistinguished pupil, he left school at 16, becoming a journalist for a short time. Although many of his works appeared in print while he was still a teenager, it was the publication of &quot;Light breaks where no sun shines&quot;, in 1934, that caught the attention of the literary world. While living in London, Thomas met<space/><link><target>Caitlin Thomas</target><part>Caitlin Macnamara</part></link>, whom he married in 1937. Their relationship was defined by alcoholism and was mutually destructive.<extension extension_name='ref' name="WAEoW"></extension><space/>In the early part of his marriage, Thomas and his family lived hand-to-mouth, settling in the Welsh fishing village of<space/><link><target>Laugharne</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Although Thomas was appreciated as a popular poet in his lifetime, he found earning a living as a writer difficult, which resulted in his augmenting his income with reading tours and broadcasts. His radio recordings for the<space/><link><target>BBC</target></link><space/>during the late 1940s brought him to the public's attention and he was used by the Corporation as a populist voice of the literary scene. In the 1950s, Thomas travelled to America, where his readings brought him a level of fame, and his erratic behaviour and drinking worsened. His time in America cemented Thomas's legend, and he recorded to vinyl works such as<space/><italics>A Child's Christmas in Wales</italics>. During his fourth trip to New York in 1953, Thomas became gravely ill and fell into a coma from which he did not recover. Thomas died on 9 November 1953 and his body was returned to Wales where he was buried at the village churchyard in Laugharne on 25 November 1953.</paragraph><paragraph>Thomas wrote exclusively in the<space/><link><target>English language</target></link>. He has been acknowledged as one of the most important Welsh poets of the 20th century and noted for his original, rhythmic and ingenious use of words and imagery. Thomas's position as one of the great modern poets has been much discussed. He remains popular with the public, who find his work accessible.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Life and career</heading><heading level='3'>Early life</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Dylan thomas birthplace.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>upright</part><part>left</part><part>5 Cwmdonkin Drive,<space/><link><target>Swansea</target></link>, birthplace of Dylan Thomas</part><part>alt=On a hill street stands a two storied semi-detached house with bay windows to the front and a sloped tiled roof with a chimney.</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>Dylan Thomas was born in<space/><link><target>Swansea</target></link>, on 27 October 1914, to David John Thomas (18761952), a teacher, and Florence Hannah (<italics>ne</italics><space/>Williams) (18821958), a<space/><link><target>seamstress</target></link>.

And death shall have no dominion.
Dead men naked they shall be one
With the man in the wind and the west moon;
When their bones are picked clean and the clean bones gone,
They shall have stars at elbow and foot;
Though they go mad they shall be sane,
Though they sink through the sea they shall rise again
Though lovers be lost love shall not;
And death shall have no dominion.

Not for the proud man apart
From the raging moon I write
On these spindrift pages
Nor for the towering dead
With their nightingales and psalms
But for the lovers, their arms
Round the griefs of the ages,
Who pay no praise or wages
Nor heed my craft or art.
