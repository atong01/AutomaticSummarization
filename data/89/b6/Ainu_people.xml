The terms &quot;Kurile&quot;, &quot;Kamchatka Kurile&quot;, etc., were used to identify the ethnic group. During Soviet times, people with Ainu surnames were sent to gulags and labor camps, as they were often mistaken for Japanese. As a result, large numbers of Ainu changed their surnames to Slavic ones. After World War II, most of the Ainu living in Sakhalin were deported to Japan. Of the 1,159 Ainu, only around 100 remained in Russia. Of those who remained, only the elderly were full-blooded Ainu. Others were either mixed race or married to ethnic Russians. The last of the Ainu households disappeared in the late 1960s, when Yamanaka Kitaro committed suicide after the death of his wife. The couple was childless.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.agesmystery.ru/node/630</arg><arg name="title">У последней черты – Айны о себе - Тайны веков</arg><arg name="work">agesmystery.ru</arg></template></extension><space/>To eradicate Ainu identity, Soviet authorities removed the ethnic group from the list of nationalities which could be mentioned in a Soviet passport. Due to this, children born after 1945 were not able to identify themselves as Ainu. The last known deportation of Ainu to Japan occurred in 1982, when Keizo Nakamura, a full blooded Northern Kuril Ainu, was deported to Hokkaido after serving 15 years' hard labor in the province of<space/><link><target>Magadan Oblast</target><part>Magadan</part></link>. His wife, Tamara Timofeevna Pikhteevoi, was of mixed Sakhalin Ainu and Gilyak ancestry.

This is due to the fact that the clan originally immigrated to Kamchatka from<space/><link><target>Kunashir</target></link><space/>in 1789. The Ainu of Kunashir are South Kuril Ainu. They settled down near<space/><link><target>Kurile Lake</target></link>, which was inhabited by the Kamchatka Ainu and North Kuril Ainu. In 1929 the Ainu of<space/><link><target>Kurile Lake</target></link><space/>fled to the island of<space/><link><target>Paramushir</target></link><space/>after an armed conflict with the Soviet authorities. At that time, Paramushir was under Japanese rule. During the<space/><link><target>Invasion of the Kuril Islands</target></link>, Akira Nakamura (b.&amp;nbsp;1897) was captured by the Soviet army and his elder son Takeshi Nakamura (192545) was killed in the battle.

The reasons for this were, among others, that in late autumn,<space/><link><target>plant gathering</target></link>, salmon fishing and other activities of securing food came to an end, and hunters readily found game in fields and mountains in which plants had withered. A village possessed a hunting ground of its own or several villages used a joint hunting territory (iwor). Heavy penalties were imposed on any outsiders trespassing on such hunting grounds or joint hunting territory. The Ainu hunted bear, Ezo deer (a subspecies of<space/><link><target>sika deer</target></link>), rabbit, fox,<space/><link><target>raccoon dog</target></link>, and other animals. Ezo deer were a particularly important food resource for the Ainu as were<space/><link><target>salmon</target></link>.

The recipe for this poison was a household secret that differed from family to family. They enhanced the poison with mixtures of roots and stalks of dog's bane, boiled juice of Mekuragumo, Matsumomushi, tobacco, and other ingredients. They also used stingray stingers or skin covering stingers. They hunted in groups with dogs. Before the Ainu went hunting, for animals like bear in particular, they prayed to the<space/><link><target>Kamuy Fuchi</target><part>god of fire</part></link><space/>and the house guardian god to convey their wishes for a large catch, and safe hunting to the god of mountains.</paragraph><paragraph>The Ainu usually hunted bear during the time of the spring thaw. At that time bears were weak because they had not fed at all during long hibernation. Ainu hunters caught hibernating bears or bears that had just left hibernation dens. When they hunted bear in summer, they used a spring trap loaded with an arrow, called an<space/><italics>amappo</italics>. The Ainu usually used arrows to hunt deer. Also they often used traps, including spring traps loaded with arrows. Also, they drove deer into a river or sea and shot them with arrows.

A child was promised in marriage by arrangement between his or her parents and the parents of his or her betrothed or by a go-between. When the betrothed reached a marriageable age, they were told who their spouse was to be. There were also marriages based on mutual consent of both sexes. In some areas, when a daughter reached a marriageable age, her parents let her live in a small room called<space/><italics>tunpu</italics><space/>annexed to the southern wall of her house.

When a man became engaged to a woman or they learned that their engagement had been arranged, they exchanged gifts with each other. He sent her a small engraved knife, a workbox, a spool, and other gifts. She sent him embroidered clothes, coverings for the back of the hand, Ieggings, and other handmade clothes.

If the man and woman agreed to marry, the man and his father would bring her to their house or the man would stay at her house for a while and then bring her to his house.
