'''Divination''' (from Latin ''divinare'' "to foresee, to be inspired by a god",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Divinatio.html|title=LacusCurtius • Greek and Roman Divination (Smith's Dictionary, 1875)|work=uchicago.edu}}</ref> related to ''divinus'', [[divinity|divine]]) is the attempt to gain insight into a question or situation by way of an [[occult]]ic, standardized process or ritual.<ref>Peek, P.M. ''African Divination Systems: Ways of Knowing.'' page 2. Indiana University Press. 1991.</ref> Used in various forms throughout history, diviners ascertain their interpretations of how a [[querent]] should proceed by reading signs, events, or [[omen]]s, or through alleged contact with a [[supernatural]] agency.

Divination can be seen as a systematic method with which to organize what appear to be disjointed, random facets of existence such that they provide insight into a problem at hand. If a distinction is to be made between divination and [[fortune-telling]], divination has a more formal or ritualistic element and often contains a more social character, usually in a [[religion|religious]] context, as seen in [[traditional African medicine]]. Fortune-telling, on the other hand, is a more everyday practice for personal purposes. Particular divination methods vary by culture and religion.

Divination is dismissed by the [[scientific community]] and skeptics as being [[superstition]]. In the 2nd century, [[Lucian]] devoted a witty essay to the career of a [[charlatan]], "[[Alexander of Abonoteichus|Alexander the false prophet]]", trained by "one of those who advertise enchantments, miraculous incantations, charms for your love-affairs, visitations for your enemies, disclosures of buried treasure, and successions to estates",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tertullian.org/rpearse/lucian/lucian_alexander.htm|title=Lucian of Samosata : Alexander the False Prophet|work=tertullian.org}}</ref> even though most Romans believed in prophetic dreams and [[Amulet|charms]].

{{Further|List of magical terms and traditions}}

Psychologist [[Julian Jaynes]] categorized divination into the following four types:{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}
# [[Omen]]s and omen texts. Chinese history offers scrupulously documented occurrences of strange births, the tracking of natural phenomena, and other data. Chinese governmental planning relied on this method of forecasting for long-range strategies. It is not unreasonable to assume that modern scientific inquiry began with this kind of divination; [[Joseph Needham]]'s work considered this very idea.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}
# Sortilege ([[cleromancy]]). This consists of the casting of lots, or ''[[Sortes (ancient Rome)|sortes]]'', whether with sticks, stones, bones, beans, coins, or some other item.  Modern playing cards and board games developed from this type of divination.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}
# [[Augury]]. This ranks a set of given possibilities. It can be qualitative (such as shapes, proximities, etc.): for example, [[dowsing]] (a form of [[rhabdomancy]]) developed from this type of divination. The [[Roman Republic|Romans]], in classical times, used [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] methods of augury such as [[hepatoscopy]] (actually a form of [[extispicy]]) (for example, [[haruspex|Haruspices]] examined the livers of sacrificed animals). Augury is normally considered to specifically refer to divination by studying the flight patterns of birds. But also, the use of the [[rooster]] through [[alectryomancy]] may be further understood within that religious character and likewise defined as a [[Cockfight (Sacred)|cockfight]], or [[Cockfight (Sacred)|cockfighting]]<ref>Encyclopaedia Perthensis; or Universal dictionary of the arts, sciences, literature, &c. intended to supersede the use of other books of reference, Volume 1; Printed by John Brown;  1816. [http://books.google.com/books?id=vvVPAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA394&lpg=PA394&dq=Alectryomancy+cockfight&source=bl&ots=SIaoyDrXYA&sig=oelfp0KzDKF09rNXN9p8ilP5FuI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=uwLKT5v5NISQ8wS32byXDw&ved=0CD0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Alectryomancy%20cockfight&f=false]</ref> with the intent of communication between the gods and man.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}
# Spontaneous. An unconstrained form of divination, free from any particular medium, and actually a generalization of all types of divination. The answer comes from whatever object the diviner happens to see or hear. Some religions use a form of [[bibliomancy]]: they ask a question, riffle the pages of their [[holy]] book, and take as their answer the first passage their eyes light upon. Other forms of spontaneous divination include reading [[Aura (paranormal)|auras]] and [[New Age]] methods of ''[[feng shui]]'' such as "intuitive" and "''fuzion''".{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In addition to these four broad categories, there is [[palmistry]], also called chiromancy, a practice common to many different places on the [[Eurasia]]n landmass;<ref>Bhojraj Dwivedi. Wonders of Palmistry pp. 16-20</ref> it has been practised in the cultures of India, Tibet, China, Persia, Sumeria, Ancient Israel and Babylonia. In this practice, the diviner examines the hands of a person for whom they are divining for indications of their future.

==Historical examples==

===Ancient Egypt===
The Oracle of Amun at the [[Siwa Oasis]] was made famous when [[Alexander the Great]] visited it after delivering Egypt from Persian rule in 332 BC.

===Hebrew Bible===
{{bibleref2|Deuteronomy|18:10-12}} or {{bibleref2|Leviticus|19:26}} can be interpreted as categorically forbidding divination. However, other verses of the Hebrew Bible include many positive examples of the use of divination by the ancient [[Israelites]]. For example, Exodus 28 gives members of the priestly class the use of the [[Urim and Thummim]] to discover the will of [[Yahweh]] before times of [[sacrifice]] and Gideon uses a piece of fleece or wool in {{bibleref2|Judges|6:36-40}} to predict the outcome of an important battle. Especially valued by the ancient Hebrews was the divination method of "casting lots" ([[Cleromancy]]) which was even used in {{bibleref2|Joshua|14:1-5}} and {{bibleref2|Joshua|18:1-10}} to divide the conquered lands of Canaan between the twelve tribes.

===Ancient Greece===
{{See also|Oracle}}
Both oracles and seers in ancient Greece practiced divination. [[Oracle#Greece|Oracles]] were the conduits for the gods on earth; their prophecies were understood to be the will of the gods verbatim. Because of the high demand for oracle consultations and the oracles’ limited work schedule, they were not the main source of divination for the ancient Greeks. That role fell to the seers (''μάντεις'' in Greek).

Seers were not in direct contact with the gods; instead, they were interpreters of signs provided by the gods. Seers used many methods to explicate the will of the gods including [[extispicy]], bird signs, etc. They were more numerous than the oracles and did not keep a limited schedule; thus, they were highly valued by all Greeks, not just those with the capacity to travel to Delphi or other such distant sites.

The disadvantage to seers was that only direct yes-or-no questions could be answered. Oracles could answer more generalized questions, and seers often had to perform several sacrifices in order to get the most consistent answer. For example, if a general wanted to know if the omens were proper for him to advance on the enemy, he would ask his seer both that question and if it were better for him to remain on the defensive. If the seer gave consistent answers, the advice was considered valid.

At battle, generals would frequently ask seers at both the [[campground]] (a process called the ''hiera'') and at the [[battle]]field (called the ''sphagia''). The hiera entailed the seer slaughtering a sheep and examining its liver for answers regarding a more generic question; the sphagia involved killing a young female goat by slitting its throat and noting the animal’s last movements and blood flow. The battlefield sacrifice only occurred when two armies prepared for battle against each other. Neither force would advance until the seer revealed appropriate [[omen]]s.

Because the seers had such power over influential individuals in ancient Greece, many were skeptical of the accuracy and honesty of the seers. Of course the degree to which seers were honest depends entirely on the individual seers. Despite the doubt surrounding individual seers, the craft as a whole was well regarded and trusted by the Greeks.<ref>Flower, Michael Attyah. ''The Seer in Ancient Greece.'' Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008.</ref>

===Christianity and Western society===
The divination method of casting lots ([[Cleromancy]]) was used by the remaining eleven disciples of Jesus in {{bibleref2|Acts|1:23-26}} to select a replacement for [[Judas Iscariot]]. Therefore, divination was arguably an accepted practice in the early church. However, divination became viewed as a pagan practice by the institutional Christian church.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} The Catholic Church later passed [[canon law]]s forbidding the practice of divination.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} In 692 the [[Quinisext Council]], also known as the "Council in Trullo" in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], passed canons to eliminate pagan and divination practices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apostolicconfraternityseminary.com/council_of_trullo.html|title=Council of Trullo - Apostolic Confraternity Seminary|work=apostolicconfraternityseminary.com}}</ref> [[Fortune-telling]] and other forms of divination were widespread through the Middle Ages.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} In the constitution of 1572 and public regulations of 1661 of Kur-Saxony, capital punishment was used on those predicting the future.<ref>(Ennemoser, p59, 1856)</ref> Laws forbidding divination practice continue to this day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pluralism.org/news/view/147|title=Wiccan Priest Fights Local Ordinance Banning Fortune Telling (Louisiana)|work=pluralism.org}}</ref>

===Mesoamerica===
{{see also|Mesoamerican religion}}
Divination was a central component of ancient [[Mesoamerican]] religious life. Many [[Aztec religion|Aztec gods]], including central [[creator deity|creator gods]], were described as diviners and were closely associated with [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]]. [[Tezcatlipoca]] is the patron of sorcerers and practitioners of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. His name means "smoking mirror", a reference to a device used for divinatory [[scrying]].<ref name="Miller 2007">{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Mary|title=Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico|year=2007|publisher=Thames & Hudson|location=London}}</ref> In the [[Maya mythology|Mayan]] ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', the creator gods [[Xmucane and Xpiacoc]] perform divinatory hand casting during the creation of people.<ref name="Miller 2007"/>

Every civilization that developed in [[Ancient Mexico]], from the [[Olmecs]] to the [[Aztecs]], practiced divination in daily life, both public and private. Scrying through the use of reflective water surfaces, [[Mirrors in Mesoamerican culture|mirrors]], or the [[Cleromancy|casting of lots]] were among the most widespread forms of divinatory practice. [[Vision (spirituality)|Vision]]s derived from [[hallucinogens]] were another important form of divination, and are still widely used among contemporary diviners of Mexico. Among the more common [[hallucinogenic plants]] used in divination are [[morning glory]], [[jimson weed]], and [[peyote]].<ref name="Miller 2007"/>

===Serer religion===
{{main|Saltigue}}
Divination is one of the tenets of [[Serer religion]]. However, only those who have been initiated as [[Saltigue]]s (the [[Serer people|Serer]] high priests and priestesses) can divine the future.<ref>[[Alioune Sarr|Sarr, Alioune]], « Histoire du Sine-Saloum » (introduction, bibliographie et notes par Charles Becker), in Bulletin de l'IFAN, tome 46, série B, nos 3-4, 1986-1987 pp 31-38</ref><ref name="Kalis">Kalis, Simone, "Medecine Traditionnele Religion et Divination Chez Les [[Serer people|Seereer]] [[Kingdom of Sine|Siin]] du [[Senegal]]", L'Harmattan (1997), pp 11-297 ISBN 2-7384-5196-9</ref> These are the "hereditary rain priests"<ref name="Galvan"/> whose role is both religious and medicinal.<ref name="Kalis"/><ref name="Galvan">Galvan, Dennis Charles, "The State Must be our Master of Fire : How Peasants Craft Culturally Sustainable Development in Senegal", Berkeley, University of California Press, (2004), pp 86-135, ISBN 978-0-520-23591-5.</ref>

===Yoruba religion===
{{Main|Yoruba religion}}

The  [[Yoruba people]] of [[West Africa]] are internationally known for having developed the [[Ifá]] system, an intricate process of divination that is performed by an ''[[Babalawo|Awo]]'', an initiated priest or priestess of [[Orunmila]], the spirit of the Yoruba [[oracle]].

{{Main|Årsgång}}
[[Småland]] is famous for Årsgång, a practice which occurred until the early 19th century in some parts of Småland. Generally occurring on Christmas and New Year's Eve, it is a practice in which one would fast and keep themselves away from light in a room until midnight to then complete a set of complex events to interpret symbols encountered throughout the journey to foresee the coming year.<ref>Kuusela, T., 2014.
