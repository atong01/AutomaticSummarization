The first [[World Congress of Esperanto]] was organized in France in 1905. Since then, congresses have been held in various countries every year, with the exceptions of years during the world wars. Although no country has adopted Esperanto officially, Esperanto was recommended by the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in 1921 and recognized [[Montevideo Resolution|by UNESCO in 1954]], which recommended in 1985 that international [[non-governmental organization]]s use Esperanto. Esperanto was the 32nd language accepted as adhering to the "[[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]]" in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edukado.net/ekzamenoj/referenckadro|title=edukado.net → / Ekzamenoj / Referenckadro|publisher=Edukado.net|accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref>

Esperanto is seen by many of its speakers as an alternative or addition to the growing use of [[English language|English]] throughout the world, offering a language that is easier to learn than English.<ref>Grin Report, page 81 "Thus Flochon (2000: 109) notes that 'the Institute of Cybernetic Education of Paderborn (Germany) has compared the learning times of several groups of French-speaking baccalauréat students to reach an equivalent "standard" level in four different languages: Esperanto, English, German and Italian. The results are as follows: to reach this level, 2000 hours of German study produce a linguistic level equivalent to 1500 hours of English study, 1000 hours of Italian study and … 150 hours of Esperanto study.' No comment." Other estimates scattered in the literature confirm faster achievement in target language skills in Esperanto than in all the other languages with which the comparison has been made (Ministry of Education [Italy], 1995) as well as propaedeutic benefits of Esperanto (Corsetti and La Torre, 1995)."</ref>

== History ==
{{Main|History of Esperanto}}

=== Creation ===
[[File:Unua Libro.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The first Esperanto book by L. L. Zamenhof.]]

Esperanto was created in the late 1870s and early 1880s by [[Ludwig Lazarus Zamenhof|L. L. Zamenhof]], a [[History of Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish]] ophthalmologist from [[Białystok]], then part of the Russian Empire. According to Zamenhof, he created the language to foster harmony between people from different countries. His feelings and the situation in Białystok may be gleaned from an extract from his letter to Nikolai Borovko:<ref>The letter is quoted in [http://www.u-matthias.de/latino/latin_en.htm Esperanto: The New Latin for the Church and for Ecumenism], by Ulrich Matthias. Translation from Esperanto by Mike Leon and Maire Mullarney</ref>

{{quote|"The place where I was born and spent my childhood gave direction to all my future struggles. In Białystok the inhabitants were divided into four distinct elements: Russians, Poles, Germans and Jews; each of these spoke their own language and looked on all the others as enemies. In such a town a sensitive nature feels more acutely than elsewhere the misery caused by language division and sees at every step that the diversity of languages is the first, or at least the most influential, basis for the separation of the human family into groups of enemies. I was brought up as an idealist; I was taught that all people were brothers, while outside in the street at every step I felt that there were no people, only Russians, Poles, Germans, Jews and so on. This was always a great torment to my infant mind, although many people may smile at such an 'anguish for the world' in a child. Since at that time I thought that 'grown-ups' were omnipotent, so I often said to myself that when I grew up I would certainly destroy this evil."|L. L. Zamenhof, in a letter to Nikolai Borovko, ca. 1895}}

After some ten years of development, which Zamenhof spent translating literature into Esperanto as well as writing original prose and verse, the [[Unua Libro|first book of Esperanto grammar]] was published in Warsaw on the 26th of July 1887. The number of speakers grew rapidly over the next few decades, at first primarily in the Russian Empire and Central Europe, then in other parts of Europe, the Americas, China, and Japan. In the early years, speakers of Esperanto kept in contact primarily through correspondence and periodicals, but in 1905 the first [[World Congress of Esperanto|world congress of Esperanto speakers]] was held in [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]], France. Since then world congresses have been held in different countries every year, except during the two World Wars. Since the Second World War, they have been attended by an average of more than 2,000 people and up to 6,000 people.

Zamenhof's name for the language was simply ''{{lang|eo|Internacia Lingvo}}'' ("International Language").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~hana/esr/ |title=Esperanto |publisher=Ling.ohio-state.edu |date=2003-01-25 |accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref>

=== Early proposals ===
[[File:1905-03-ge-frankf-mapo.jpg|thumb|250px|Map of Esperanto groups in Europe in 1905.]]
The autonomous territory of [[Neutral Moresnet]], between what is today Belgium and Germany, had a sizable proportion of Esperanto-speakers among its small and multiethnic population. There was a proposal to make Esperanto its official language.

However, neither Belgium nor Prussia (now within Germany) had ever surrendered its original claim to it. Around 1900, Germany in particular was taking a more aggressive stance towards the territory and was accused of sabotage and of obstructing the administrative process in order to force the issue. It was the First World War, however, that was the catalyst that brought about the end of neutrality. On 4 August 1914, Germany invaded Belgium, leaving Moresnet at first "an oasis in a desert of destruction".<ref>Musgrave, George Clarke. ''Under Four Flags for France'', 1918, p. 8</ref> In 1915, the territory was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia, without international recognition.

After the Great War, there was a proposal for the League of Nations to accept Esperanto as their working language, following a report by [[Nitobe Inazō]], an official delegate of League of Nations during the 13th World Congress of Esperanto in Prague. Ten delegates accepted the proposal with only one voice against, the French delegate, [[Gabriel Hanotaux]]. Hanotaux did not like how the French language was losing its position as the international language and saw Esperanto as a threat, effectively wielding his veto power to block the decision. However, two years later, the League recommended that its member states include Esperanto in their educational curricula. For this reason, many people see the 1920s as the heyday of the Esperanto movement. [[Anarchism]] as a political movement was very supportive during this time of [[anationalism]] as well as of the Esperanto language.<ref>{{lang|eo|"Anarkiistoj estis inter la pioniroj de la disvastigo de Esperanto. En 1905 fondiĝis en Stokholmo la unua anarkiisma Esperanto-grupo. Sekvis multaj aliaj: en Bulgario, Ĉinio kaj aliaj landoj. Anarkiistoj kaj anarki-sindikatistoj, kiuj antaŭ la Unua Mondmilito apartenis al la nombre plej granda grupo inter la proletaj esperantistoj, fondis en 1906 la internacian ligon Paco-Libereco, kiu eldonis la Internacian Socian Revuon. Paco-libereco unuiĝis en 1910 kun alia progresema asocio, Esperantista Laboristaro. La komuna organizaĵo nomiĝis Liberiga Stelo. Ĝis 1914 tiu organizaĵo eldonis multe da revolucia literaturo en Esperanto, interalie ankaŭ anarkiisma. Tial povis evolui en la jaroj antaŭ la Unua Mondmilito ekzemple vigla korespondado inter eŭropaj kaj japanaj anarkiistoj. En 1907 la Internacia Anarkiisma Kongreso en Amsterdamo faris rezolucion pri la afero de internacia lingvo, kaj venis dum la postaj jaroj similaj kongresaj rezolucioj. Esperantistoj, kiuj partoprenis tiujn kongresojn, okupiĝis precipe pri la internaciaj rilatoj de la anarkiistoj."}}[http://www.nodo50.org/esperanto/anarkiismo.htm "ESPERANTO KAJ ANARKIISMO" by Will Firth]</ref>

=== Responses of 20th-century totalitarian regimes to Esperanto ===

[[File:1911 Anvers Congrès Esperanto.jpg|thumb|7th Esperanto congress, Antwerp August 1911.]]
Esperanto attracted the suspicion of many totalitarian states. The situation was especially pronounced in Nazi Germany, Francoist Spain up until the 1950s, and in the Soviet Union from 1937 to 1956.

In Nazi Germany, there was a motivation to persecute Esperanto because Zamenhof was Jewish, and due to the internationalist nature of Esperanto, which was perceived as "Bolshevist". In his work, ''Mein Kampf'', Adolf Hitler specifically mentioned Esperanto as an example of a language that could be used by an international Jewish conspiracy once they achieved world domination.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sutton|first=Geoffrey|title=Concise Encyclopedia of the Original Literature of Esperanto, 1887–2007|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-Z_8CG9g2jIC&pg=PA161|year=2008|publisher=Mondial|isbn=978-1-59569-090-6|quote="Hitler specifically attacked Esperanto as a threat in a speech in Munich (1922) and in ''Mein Kampf'' itself (1925).  The Nazi Minister for Education banned the teaching of Esperanto on 17 May 1935 ....all Esperantists were essentially enemies of the state, serving through their language Jewish-internationalist aims" (pages 161–162)}}</ref> [[Esperantist]]s were killed during the Holocaust, with Zamenhof's family in particular singled out for murder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esperantodc.org/esw6.html |title=About ESW and the Holocaust Museum |publisher=Esperantodc.org |date=1995-12-05 |accessdate=2010-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20101125045310/http://esperantodc.org:80/esw6.html |archivedate=25 November 2010 }}</ref> The efforts of a minority of Esperantists to expel Jewish colleagues and align themselves with the Reich were futile and Esperanto was legally forbidden in 1935. Esperantists in German concentration camps taught the language to fellow prisoners, telling guards they were teaching Italian, the language of one of Germany's Axis allies.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lins|first=Ulrich|title=Die gefährliche Sprache|year=1988|publisher=Bleicher|location=Gerlingen|isbn=3-88350-023-2|pages=112}}</ref>

In Imperial Japan, the left-wing of the Japanese Esperanto movement was persecuted, but its leaders were careful enough not to give the impression to the government that the Esperantists were socialist revolutionaries, which proved a successful strategy.<ref name="Esperanto as language and idea in China
and Japan">{{cite journal |last=Lins |first=Ulrich |year=2008 |title=Esperanto as language and idea in China and Japan |journal=Language Problems and Language Planning |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=47–60 |publisher=John Benjamins |format=PDF |issn=0272–2690 |doi=10.1075/lplp.32.1.05lin |accessdate=2 July 2012 |url=http://benjamins.com/series/lplp/32-1/art/05lin.pdf}}</ref>

After the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, Esperanto was given a measure of government support by the new workers' states in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|former Russian Empire]] and later by the [[Soviet Union]] government, with the [[Soviet Esperanto Association]] being established as an officially recognized organization.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/EBook/chap07.html |title=Donald J. Harlow, The Esperanto Book, chapter 7 |publisher=Donh.best.vwh.net |accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref> In his biography on [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Leon Trotsky]] mentions that Stalin had studied Esperanto.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1940/xx/stalin/ch04.htm|title=Chapter IV: The period of reaction: Leon Trotsky: Stalin  –An appraisal of the man and his influence (1940)|author=Leon Trotsky|publisher=Marxists.org|accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref> However, in 1937, at the height of the [[Great Purge]], Stalin completely reversed the Soviet government's policies on Esperanto, denouncing it as "the language of spies" and had Esperantists exiled or executed. The use of Esperanto was then banned in the Soviet Union until 1956.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

Fascist Italy allowed the use of Esperanto, finding its phonology similar to that of Italian and publishing some tourist material in the language.

During and after the [[Spanish Civil War]], Francoist Spain persecuted [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchists]], socialists and [[Catalan nationalist]]s for many years, among whom the use of Esperanto was extensive,<ref name="Del Barrio">{{cite web|url=http://www.nodo50.org/esperanto/artik68es.htm|title=La utilización del esperanto durante la Guerra Civil Española|publisher=Nodo50.org|accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref> but in the 1950s the Esperanto movement was tolerated again.

=== Increasing use of Esperanto ===

There are several numbers indicating an increasing use of Esperanto during the last decades.

The Hungarian census calculated 942 Esperanto speakers in 1941, 2,083 in 1990, 4,575 in 2001<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nepszamlalas2001.hu/hun/kotetek/18/tables/load1_32.html|title=18.

In the 1960s the ''Jarlibro'' (yearbook) of the Universal Esperanto Association listed 58 (1961), 67 (1962) and 83 (1965) names of [[Native Esperanto speakers|native speakers of Esperanto]].<ref>See the references at [[:eo:Denaskaj Esperanto-parolantoj#Nombro kaj denaskuloj de dua kaj tria generacio|Denaskaj Esperanto-parolantoj]]</ref>  As of 1996, there were 350 or so attested cases of families with native Esperanto speakers.<ref>Corsetti, Renato (1996). A mother tongue spoken mainly by fathers. Language Problems and Language Planning 20: 3, 263-73</ref> Assuming an average of two children per family this means some 700 children.

There are now Esperanto associations in some twenty African countries;<ref>[http://uea.org/landoj/afriko Universal Esperanto Association]</ref> nearly all of them were founded after 1960. The number of African addresses in the ''[[Pasporta Servo]]'' hospitality service went from 18 in 1988/89 to 59 in 2005.<ref>See [[:eo:Statistiko de Esperantujo#Afriko|Statistiko Afriko]] for sources</ref>

[[File:Renkontighoj en Germanio partoprenantoj.png|thumb|250px|left|Esperanto meetings in Germany (and one meeting in Poland, AS), number of participants 1957–2007]]
There were four new music albums in Esperanto in the sixties, 17 in the seventies, 58 in the eighties, 75 in the nineties and over one hundred in the first decade of the new millennium.<ref>See the list of music albums on [[:eo:Esperanto-muzikalbumoj#Resumo laŭ jardekoj|Esperanto-muzikalbumoj]]</ref> There are now more than 3000 songs in Esperanto.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esperantorondo.blogspot.de/2013/05/3000-kantoj-en-la-libera-esperanto.html|title=EsperantoRondo: 3000 kantoj en la Libera Esperanto-Kantaro!|author=Esperanto, internacia lingvo de libereco...!|work=esperantorondo.blogspot.de}}</ref>

The number of participants in Esperanto meetings of one week or longer in Germany went from around 100 in the early seventies to around 800 in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/eo/2/21/Renkonti%C4%9Doj_en_Germanio_partoprenantoj.png|title=Esperanto meetings in Germany (and one meeting in Poland, AS), number of participants 1957–2007|publisher=Wikimedia Commons}}</ref>

The [[Esperanto Wikipedia]] now has over 215,000 articles (June 2015); there are around 1000 new articles every month. These numbers are similar to the Slovak (around 205,000 articles), Bulgarian (202,000) and Danish (200,000) versions of Wikipedia.<ref>[https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias#100_000.2B_articles List of Wikipedia], 2015-06-15, 5h58 UCT</ref> Before the foundation of the Esperanto Wikipedia in 2001 there was no general-knowledge encyclopedia in Esperanto at all; the ''[[Enciklopedio de Esperanto]]'' (documenting the Esperanto movement) was published in 1934 and only reprinted, but never edited.

Between 1906 and 1971 there were about 28 dissertations about Esperanto and [[interlinguistics]]; about one in two or three years. This number increased significantly: Between 1975 and 1987 there were about 95 dissertations - an average of seven per year after 1975.<ref>Edward Symoens.

== Official use ==
[[File:Moresnet.png|thumb|alt=|Location of Moresnet.]]
Esperanto has not been a secondary official language of any recognized country. However, there were plans at the beginning of the 20th century to establish [[Neutral Moresnet]] as the world's first Esperanto state. In addition, the self-proclaimed artificial island [[micronation]] of [[Republic of Rose Island|Rose Island]] used Esperanto as its official language in 1968. In February 2013 an [[Avaaz]] petition was created to make Esperanto one of the official languages of the European Union.

The [[China|Chinese]] government has used Esperanto since 2001 for daily news on china.org.cn. China also uses Esperanto in [[China Radio International]] and for the internet magazine ''El Popola Ĉinio''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esperanto.china.org.cn/|title=China Interreta Informa Centro-esperanto.china.org.cn|work=china.org.cn}}</ref>

The [[Vatican Radio]] has an Esperanto version of its website.<ref>h{{cite web|url=ttp://eo.radiovaticana.va/|title=Radio Vatikana}}</ref>

The US Army has published military phrase books in Esperanto,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kafejo.com/lingvoj/auxlangs/eo/maneuver/ |title=''The Maneuver Enemy'' website |publisher=Kafejo.com |date=2004-06-02 |accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref> to be used from the 1950s through the 1970s in war games by mock enemy forces.

Esperanto is the working language of several non-profit international organizations such as the ''{{lang|eo|[[Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda]]}}'', a left-wing cultural association, or [[E@I|Education@Internet]], which has developed from an Esperanto organization; most others are specifically Esperanto organizations. The largest of these, the [[World Esperanto Association]], has an official consultative relationship with the [[United Nations]] and [[UNESCO]], which recognized Esperanto as a medium for international understanding in 1954.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uea.org/info/angle/an_ghisdatigo.html |title=Unesco and Esperanto |publisher=Uea.org |date=2010-06-08 |accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref> Esperanto is also the first language of teaching and administration of one university, the [[Akademio Internacia de la Sciencoj San Marino|International Academy of Sciences San Marino]].<ref name=ais>{{cite web|url=http://www.ais-sanmarino.org/ |title=Akademio Internacia de la Sciencoj (AIS) San-Marino |publisher=Ais-sanmarino.org |accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref>

In the summer of 1924, the [[American Radio Relay League]] adopted Esperanto as its official international auxiliary language, and hoped that the language would be used by radio amateurs in international communications, but its actual use for radio communications was negligible.

All the personal documents issued by the [[World Service Authority]], including the [[World Passport]], are written in Esperanto, together with English, French, Spanish, Russian, Arabic, and Chinese.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldservice.org/doc.html|title=World Government Documents (Personal)|publisher=Worldservice.org|accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref>

== Linguistic properties ==

=== Classification ===
As a [[constructed language]], most scholars would say Esperanto is not [[Language family|genealogically related]] to any [[natural language]]. The [[phonology]], [[grammar]], [[vocabulary]], and [[semantics]] are based on the [[Indo-European languages]] spoken in Europe. The [[phoneme|sound inventory]] is essentially [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], as is much of the semantics, whereas the vocabulary derives primarily from the [[Romance languages]], with a lesser contribution from [[Germanic languages]] and minor contributions from Slavic languages and Greek. [[Pragmatics]] and other aspects of the language not specified by Zamenhof's original documents were influenced by the native languages of early authors, primarily Russian, Polish, German, and French.  However, [[Paul Wexler (linguist)|Paul Wexler]] proposes that Esperanto is [[relexified]] [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], which in turn he claims is a relexified Slavic language.<ref name=Wexler>

Esperanto has been described as "a language [[Lexicon|lexically]] predominantly [[Romance languages|Romanic]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] intensively [[agglutination|agglutinative]], and to a certain degree [[isolating languages|isolating]] in character".<ref>{{cite book|last=Blank |first=Detlev |title=Internationale Plansprachen.

An Introduction") |publisher=Akademie-Verlag |year=1985 |id=ISSN 0138-55 X }}</ref> [[Linguistic typology|Typologically]], Esperanto has [[preposition]]s and a [[information flow|pragmatic word order]] that by default is ''[[subject–verb–object]].'' Adjectives can be freely placed before or after the nouns they modify, though placing them before the noun is more common. New words are formed through extensive [[prefix (linguistics)|prefixing]] and [[suffix]]ing.

=== Phonology ===
{{Main|Esperanto phonology}}

Esperanto has 23 consonants, five vowels, and two [[semivowel]]s that combine with the vowels to form six [[diphthong]]s. (The consonant {{IPA|/j/}} and semivowel {{IPA|/i̯/}} are both written ''j'', and the uncommon consonant {{IPA|/dz/}} is written with the digraph ''[[Dz (digraph)|dz]]'',<ref>Kalocsay & Waringhien (1985) ''{{lang|eo|Plena analiza gramatiko de Esperanto}}'', §&nbsp;17, 22</ref> which is the only consonant that doesn't have its own letter.) [[tone (linguistics)|Tone]] is not used to distinguish meanings of words. [[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] is always on the second-last vowel in fully Esperanto words unless a final vowel ''{{lang|eo|o}}'' is elided, which occurs mostly in poetry. For example, ''{{wikteo|familio}}'' "family" is {{IPA|[fa.mi.ˈli.o]}}, with the stress on the second ''i'', but when the word is used without the final ''{{lang|eo|o}} ({{lang|eo|famili’}}),'' the stress remains on the second ''{{lang|eo|i}}'': {{IPA|[fa.mi.ˈli]}}.

The sound {{IPAslink|r}} is usually [[alveolar trill|trilled]] {{IPAblink|r}}, but may be [[alveolar tap|tapped]] {{IPAblink|ɾ}}. The {{IPAslink|v}} is normally pronounced like [[English language|English]] ''v,'' but may be pronounced {{IPAblink|ʋ}} (between English ''v'' and ''w'') or {{IPAblink|w}}, depending on the language background of the speaker. A semivowel {{IPA|/u̯/}} normally occurs only in [[diphthong]]s after the vowels {{IPAslink|a}} and {{IPAslink|e̞|e}}, not as a consonant {{IPA|/w/}}. Common, if debated, [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] includes the pronunciation of ''{{lang|eo|nk}}'' as {{IPA|[ŋk]}} and ''{{lang|eo|kz}}'' as {{IPA|[ɡz]}}.

A large number of consonant clusters can occur, up to three in initial position (as in ''{{wikteo|stranga}}'', "strange") and four in medial position (as in ''{{wikteo|instrui}}'', "teach"). Final clusters are uncommon except in foreign names, poetic elision of final ''{{wikteo|o}},'' and a very few basic words such as ''{{wikteo|cent}}'' "hundred" and ''{{wikteo|post}}'' "after".

==== Vowels ====
Esperanto has the five vowels found in such languages as <!--Not Italian: Italian has 7 vowels.-->[[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Modern Hebrew]], and [[Modern Greek]].
{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;"

|-
! style="text-align: right;" | [[Open vowel|Open]]
| colspan=2 | <span style="font-size:125%;">{{IPA link|ä|a}}</span>
|}

There are also two semivowels, {{IPA|/i̯/}} and {{IPA|/u̯/}}, which combine with the monophthongs to form six falling [[diphthongs]]: ''{{lang|eo|aj}}, {{lang|eo|ej}}, {{lang|eo|oj}}, {{lang|eo|uj}}, {{lang|eo|aŭ}},'' and ''{{lang|eo|eŭ}}''.

Since there are only five vowels, a good deal of variation in pronunciation is tolerated. For instance, ''e'' commonly ranges from {{IPA|[e]}} (French ''{{lang|fr|é}}'') to {{IPA|[ɛ]}} (French ''{{lang|fr|è}}''). These details often depend on the speaker's native language. A [[glottal stop]] may occur between adjacent vowels in some people's speech, especially when the two vowels are the same, as in ''{{wikteo|heroo}}'' "hero" ({{IPA|[he.ˈro.o]}} or {{IPA|[he.ˈro.ʔo]}}) and ''{{wikteo|praavo}}'' "great-grandfather" ({{IPA|[pra.ˈa.vo]}} or {{IPA|[pra.ˈʔa.vo]}}).

=== Alphabet ===
{{Main|Esperanto orthography}}

The Esperanto alphabet is based on the [[Latin script]], using a one-sound-one-letter principle, except for [d͡z]. It includes six [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] with [[diacritic]]s: [[ĉ]], [[ĝ]], [[ĥ]], [[ĵ]], [[ŝ]] (with [[circumflex]]), and [[ŭ]] (with [[breve]]). The alphabet does not include the letters ''q, w, x,'' or ''y'', which are only used when writing unassimilated foreign terms or proper names.

The 28-letter alphabet is:
<span style="font-size:125%;line-height:150%;"><center>'''{{lang|eo|a b c ĉ d e f g ĝ h ĥ i j ĵ k l m n o p r s ŝ t u ŭ v z}}'''</center></span>

All unaccented letters are pronounced approximately as in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], with the exception of ''c''. Esperanto ''j'' and ''c'' are used in a way familiar to speakers of many European languages, but which is largely unfamiliar to English speakers: ''j'' has a ''y'' sound, as in '''''y'''ellow'' and ''bo'''y''','' and ''c'' has a ''ts'' sound, as in ''hi'''ts''''' or the ''zz'' in ''pi'''zz'''a''.<ref>These letters occasionally have these values in English as well, for example the ''j'' in ''[[hallelujah|hallelu'''j'''ah]], [[Jarlsberg cheese|'''J'''arlsberg]],'' or ''[[Jägermeister|'''J'''ägermeister]]'', and the ''c'' in the name of composer ''[[Krzysztof Penderecki|Pendere'''c'''ki]]'', Czech president ''[[Václav Havel|Vá'''c'''lav Havel]]'', or the mineral ''[[letovicite]]''.</ref> The accented letters are a bit like ''h''-digraphs in English: ''Ĉ'' is pronounced like English ''ch'', and ''ŝ'' like ''sh''. ''Ĝ'' is the ''g'' in '''''g'''em'', ''ĵ'' a ''zh'' sound, as in ''fu'''s'''ion'' or French '''''J'''acques'', and the rare ''ĥ'' is like the German {{lang|de|''Ba'''ch'''''}}, older Scottish English ''lo'''ch''''', or how Scouse people sometimes pronounce the 'k' in ''boo'''k''''' and 'ck' in ''chi'''ck'''en''.

==== Writing diacritics ====
Until the widespread adoption of Unicode, the letters with diacritics (found in the "Latin-Extended A" section of the [[Unicode Standard]]) caused problems with printing and computing. This was particularly true of the five letters with circumflexes, as they do not occur in any other language. These problems have abated, and are now normally seen only with computing applications that are limited to [[ASCII]] characters (typically internet chat systems and databases).

There are two principal workarounds to this problem, which substitute [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] for the accented letters. Zamenhof, the inventor of Esperanto, created an "h-convention", which replaces ''ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ,'' and ''ŭ'' with ''ch, gh, hh, jh, sh,'' and ''u,'' respectively. If used in a database, a program in principle could not determine whether to render, for example, ''ch'' as ''c'' followed by ''h'' or as ''ĉ'', and would fail to render, for example, the word ''{{lang|eo|[[wikt:senchava|senchava]]}}'' properly. A more recent "[[x-convention]]" has gained ground since the advent of computing. This system replaces each diacritic with an ''x'' (not part of the Esperanto alphabet) after the letter, producing the six digraphs ''cx, gx, hx, jx, sx,'' and ''ux.''

There are computer [[keyboard layouts]] that support the Esperanto alphabet, and some systems use software that automatically replaces x- or h-convention digraphs with the corresponding diacritic letters ({{lang|eo|EK}} for [[Microsoft Windows]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esperanto.mv.ru/Ek/index.html|title=Ek!|publisher=Esperanto.mv.ru|accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref> and {{lang|eo|Esperanta Klavaro}} for [[Windows Phone]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/esperanta-klavaro/e2264bb4-b596-4fb2-a5d3-42d007d6b53c|title=Esperanta Klavaro|work=windowsphone.com}}</ref> are examples). Another example is the Esperanto Wikipedia, which accepts the x-convention for input: when a contributor types ''cx'' when editing an article, it will appear as the correct ''{{lang|eo|ĉ}}'' in the article text. (The input pane also accepts ''{{lang|eo|ĉ}}''; when the page is saved, it will be changed to ''cx'', so that the x-convention applies uniformly in the wikitext.)

=== Grammar ===
{{Main|Esperanto grammar}}
Esperanto words are [[Morphological derivation|derived]] by stringing together [[prefix (linguistics)|prefixes]], [[Root (linguistics)|roots]], and [[suffix]]es. This process is regular, so that people can create new words as they speak and be understood. [[Compound (linguistics)|Compound]] words are formed with a modifier-first, [[head (linguistics)|head-final]] order, as in English (compare "birdsong" and "songbird," and likewise, ''{{lang|eo|birdokanto}}'' and ''{{lang|eo|kantobirdo}}'').

The different [[Part of speech|parts of speech]] are marked by their own suffixes: all [[common noun]]s end in ''{{lang|eo|-o}}'', all [[adjective]]s in ''{{lang|eo|-a}}'', all derived adverbs in ''{{lang|eo|-e}}'', and all [[verb]]s in one of six [[Grammatical tense|tense]] and [[Grammatical mood|mood]] suffixes, such as the [[present tense]] ''{{lang|eo|-as}}''. Nouns and adjectives have two cases: [[Nominative case|nominative]] for grammatical subjects and in general, and [[Accusative case|accusative]] for direct objects and (after a preposition) to indicate direction of movement.

[[Grammatical number|Singular]] nouns used as [[grammatical subject]]s end in ''{{lang|eo|-o}}'', [[Grammatical number|plural]] subject nouns in ''{{lang|eo|-oj}}'' (pronounced like English "oy"). Singular [[direct object]] forms end in ''{{lang|eo|-on}}'', and plural direct objects with the combination ''{{lang|eo|-ojn}}'' (rhymes with "coin"): ''{{lang|eo|-o-}}'' indicates that the word is a noun, ''{{lang|eo|-j-}}'' indicates the plural, and ''{{lang|eo|-n}}'' indicates the [[accusative case|accusative]] (direct object) case. Adjectives [[Grammatical number#Adjectives and determiners|agree]] with their nouns; their endings are singular subject ''{{lang|eo|-a}}'' (rhymes with "ha!"), plural subject ''{{lang|eo|-aj}}'' (pronounced "eye"), singular object ''{{lang|eo|-an}}'', and plural object ''{{lang|eo|-ajn}}'' (rhymes with "fine").

|}

The suffix ''{{lang|eo|-n}}'', besides indicating the direct object, is used to indicate movement and a few other things as well.

The six verb [[inflection]]s consist of three tenses and three moods. They are [[present tense]] ''{{lang|eo|-as}}'', [[future tense]] ''{{lang|eo|-os}}'', [[past tense]] ''{{lang|eo|-is}}'', [[infinitive]] mood ''{{lang|eo|-i}}'', [[conditional mood]] ''{{lang|eo|-us}}'' and [[jussive mood]] ''{{lang|eo|-u}}'' (used for wishes and commands). Verbs are not marked for person or number. Thus, ''{{lang|eo|kanti}}'' means "to sing", ''{{lang|eo|mi kantas}}'' means "I sing", ''{{lang|eo|vi kantas}}'' means "you sing", and ''{{lang|eo|ili kantas}}'' means "they sing".

Word order is comparatively free. Adjectives may precede or follow nouns; subjects, verbs and objects may occur in any order. However, the [[article (grammar)|article]] ''{{lang|eo|la}}'' "the", [[demonstrative]]s such as ''{{lang|eo|tiu}}'' "that" and [[preposition]]s (such as ''{{lang|eo|ĉe}}'' "at") must come before their related nouns. Similarly, the negative ''{{lang|eo|ne}}'' "not" and [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]] such as ''{{lang|eo|kaj}}'' "and" and ''{{lang|eo|ke}}'' "that" must precede the [[phrase]] or [[clause]] that they introduce. In [[copula (linguistics)|copular]] (A = B) clauses, word order is just as important as in English: "people are animals" is distinguished from "animals are people".

=== Vocabulary ===
{{Main|Esperanto vocabulary}}

The core vocabulary of Esperanto was defined by ''{{lang|eo|Lingvo internacia}}'', published by Zamenhof in 1887. This book listed 900 roots; these could be expanded into tens of thousands of words using prefixes, suffixes, and compounding. In 1894, Zamenhof published the first Esperanto [[dictionary]], ''{{lang|eo|Universala Vortaro}}'', which had a larger set of roots. The rules of the language allowed speakers to borrow new roots as needed; it was recommended, however, that speakers use most international forms and then derive related meanings from these.

Since then, many words have been borrowed, primarily (but not solely) from the European languages. Not all proposed borrowings become widespread, but many do, especially [[technical terminology|technical]] and [[science|scientific]] terms. Terms for everyday use, on the other hand, are more likely to be derived from existing roots; ''{{lang|eo|komputilo}}'' "computer", for instance, is formed from the verb ''{{lang|eo|komputi}}'' "compute" and the suffix ''{{lang|eo|-ilo}}'' "tool". Words are also [[calque]]d; that is, words acquire new meanings based on usage in other languages. For example, the word ''{{lang|eo|muso}}'' "mouse" has acquired the meaning of a [[mouse (computing)|computer mouse]] from its usage in English. Esperanto speakers often debate about whether a particular borrowing is justified or whether meaning can be expressed by deriving from or extending the meaning of existing words.

Some compounds and formed words in Esperanto are not entirely straightforward; for example, ''{{lang|eo|eldoni}}'', literally "give out", means "publish", paralleling the usage of certain European languages (such as [[German (language)|German]]). In addition, [[Esperanto words with the ad hoc suffix -um|the suffix ''-um-'']] has no defined meaning; words using the suffix must be learned separately (such as ''{{lang|eo|dekstren}}'' "to the right" and ''{{lang|eo|dekstrumen}}'' "clockwise").

There are not many idiomatic or [[slang]] words in Esperanto, as these forms of speech tend to make international communication difficult—working against Esperanto's main goal.

{{Listen|filename=Eo-drako-reĝo.ogg|title=Listen to this excerpt}}
The following short extract gives an idea of the character of Esperanto.<ref>Maire Mullarney ''Everyone's Own Language'', p147, Nitobe Press, Channel Islands, 1999</ref> (Pronunciation is covered above; the Esperanto letter ''j'' is pronounced like English ''y''.)
* Esperanto:
:«{{lang|eo|En multaj lokoj de Ĉinio estis temploj de la drako-reĝo. Dum trosekeco oni preĝis en la temploj, ke la drako-reĝo donu pluvon al la homa mondo. Tiam drako estis simbolo de la supernatura estaĵo. Kaj pli poste, ĝi fariĝis prapatro de la plej altaj regantoj kaj simbolis la absolutan aŭtoritaton de feŭda imperiestro. La imperiestro pretendis, ke li estas filo de la drako. Ĉiuj liaj vivbezonaĵoj portis la nomon drako kaj estis ornamitaj per diversaj drakofiguroj. Nun ĉie en Ĉinio videblas drako-ornamentaĵoj, kaj cirkulas legendoj pri drakoj.}}»
* English translation:
:''In many places in China, there were temples of the dragon-king. During times of drought, people would pray in the temples that the dragon-king would give rain to the human world. At that time the dragon was a symbol of the supernatural. Later on, it became the ancestor of the highest rulers and symbolised the absolute authority of a feudal emperor. The emperor claimed to be the son of the dragon. All of his personal possessions carried the name "dragon" and were decorated with various dragon figures. Now dragon decorations can be seen everywhere in China and legends about dragons circulate.''

== Education ==

=== Third-language acquisition ===
{{Main|Propaedeutic value of Esperanto}}
Four primary schools in Britain, with some 230 pupils, are currently following a course in "[[propaedeutics|propaedeutic]] Esperanto"—that is, instruction in Esperanto to raise language awareness and accelerate subsequent learning of foreign languages—under the supervision of the University of Manchester. As they put it,
:''Many schools used to teach children the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], not to produce a nation of recorder players, but as a preparation for learning other instruments. [We teach] Esperanto, not to produce a nation of Esperanto-speakers, but as a preparation for learning other languages.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.springboard2languages.org |title=Springboard to Languages |publisher=Springboard2languages.org |accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref>

==== Number of speakers ====
An estimate of the number of Esperanto speakers was made by [[Sidney S. Culbert]], a retired [[psychology]] professor at the [[University of Washington]] and a longtime Esperantist, who tracked down and tested Esperanto speakers in sample areas in dozens of countries over a period of twenty years. Culbert concluded that between one and two million people speak Esperanto at [[ILR or Foreign Service Level language ability measures|Foreign Service Level 3]], "professionally proficient" (able to communicate moderately complex ideas without hesitation, and to follow speeches, radio broadcasts, etc.).<ref name=Culbert>Culbert, Sidney S. [http://www.panix.com/~dwolff/docs/ Three letters about his method for estimating the number of Esperanto speakers], scanned and HTMLized by David Wolff</ref> Culbert's estimate was not made for Esperanto alone, but formed part of his listing of estimates for all languages of more than one million speakers, published annually in the [[World Almanac]] and Book of Facts. Culbert's most detailed account of his methodology is found in a 1989 letter to David Wolff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.panix.com/~dwolff/docs/culbert-methods.html |title=Number of Esperantists (methods) |publisher=Panix.com |accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref> Since Culbert never published detailed intermediate results for particular countries and regions, it is difficult to independently gauge the accuracy of his results.

In the Almanac, his estimates for numbers of language speakers were rounded to the nearest million, thus the number for Esperanto speakers is shown as two million. This latter figure appears in ''[[Ethnologue]]''. Assuming that this figure is accurate, that means that about 0.03% of the world's population speaks the language. Although it is not Zamenhof's goal of a [[international auxiliary language|universal language]], it still represents a level of popularity unmatched by any other constructed language.

Marcus Sikosek (now [[Ziko van Dijk]]) has challenged this figure of 1.6 million as exaggerated. He estimated that even if Esperanto speakers were evenly distributed, assuming one million Esperanto speakers worldwide would lead one to expect about 180 in the city of [[Cologne, Germany|Cologne]]. Van Dijk finds only 30 [[fluency|fluent]] speakers in that city, and similarly smaller-than-expected figures in several other places thought to have a larger-than-average concentration of Esperanto speakers. He also notes that there are a total of about 20,000 members of the various Esperanto organizations (other estimates are higher). Though there are undoubtedly many Esperanto speakers who are not members of any Esperanto organization, he thinks it unlikely that there are fifty times more speakers than organization members.<ref name=Sikosek_2003 />

[[Finnish people|Finnish]] [[linguistics|linguist]] [[Jouko Lindstedt]], an expert on native-born Esperanto speakers, presented the following scheme<ref name=Lindstedt_1996>Lindstedt, Jouko. "Re: {{lang|eo|Kiom?}}" (posting). [http://www.helsinki.fi/~jslindst/denask-l.html DENASK-L@helsinki.fi], 22 April 1996.</ref> to show the overall proportions of language capabilities within the Esperanto community:
* ''1,000 have Esperanto as their native language.
* ''10,000 speak it fluently.
* ''100,000 can use it actively.
* ''1,000,000 understand a large amount passively.
* ''10,000,000 have studied it to some extent at some time.''

In the absence of Dr. Culbert's detailed sampling data, or any other census data, it is impossible to state the number of speakers with certainty. According to the [[website]] of the [[World Esperanto Association]]:
:Numbers of [[textbook]]s sold and membership of local societies put the number of people with some knowledge of the language in the hundreds of thousands and possibly millions.<ref name=UEA>[http://www.uea.org/info/angle/an_ghisdatigo.html] {{dead link|date=January 2015}}</ref>

Historically, much [[Esperanto music]], such as ''{{lang|eo|Kaj Tiel Plu}}'', has been in various folk traditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicexpress.com.br/artisto.asp?Artista=135#musica=Adiaux%20Birdeto%20Mia|title=musicexpress.com.br|publisher=Musicexpress.com.br|accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref> There is also a variety of classical and semi-classical choral music, both original and translated, as well as large ensemble music that includes voices singing Esperanto texts. [[Lou Harrison]], who incorporated styles and instruments from many world cultures in his music, used Esperanto titles and/or texts in several of his works, most notably ''{{lang|eo|La Koro-Sutro}}'' (1973). [[David Gaines (composer)|David Gaines]] used Esperanto poems as well as an excerpt from a speech by Dr. Zamenhof for his ''Symphony No. 1 (Esperanto)'' for mezzo-soprano and orchestra (1994–98). He wrote original Esperanto text for his ''{{lang|eo|Povas plori mi ne plu}}'' (''I Can Cry No Longer'') for unaccompanied [[SATB]] choir (1994).

There are also shared [[tradition]]s, such as [[Zamenhof Day]], and shared [[behaviour]] patterns. [[Esperantist]]s speak primarily in Esperanto at [[World Esperanto Congress|international Esperanto meetings]].

Detractors of Esperanto occasionally criticize it as "having no culture". Proponents, such as Prof. [[Humphrey Tonkin]] of the [[University of Hartford]], observe that Esperanto is "culturally neutral by design, as it was intended to be a facilitator between cultures, not to be the carrier of any one national culture". The late [[Scotland|Scottish]] Esperanto author [[William Auld]] wrote extensively on the subject, arguing that Esperanto is "the expression of a [[Esperanto as an international language|common human culture]], unencumbered by national frontiers. Thus it is considered a culture on its own."<ref>Auld, William. ''{{lang|eo|La Fenomeno Esperanto}}'' ("The Esperanto Phenomenon"). Rotterdam: {{lang|eo|Universala Esperanto-Asocio}}, 1988.</ref>

[[File:Vestaĵoj Malnovaj.png|thumb|250px|Scene from Chaplin's ''The Great Dictator'' with a shop sign reading ''{{lang|eo|Vestaĵoj Malnovaj}}'' ("Old Clothes").]]

Esperanto has been used in a number of films and novels. Typically, this is done either to add the exotic flavour of a foreign language without representing any particular ethnicity, or to avoid going to the trouble of inventing a new language. The [[Charlie Chaplin]] film ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940) showed [[Warsaw ghetto|Jewish ghetto]] shop signs in Esperanto. Two full-length [[feature film]]s have been produced with [[dialogue]] entirely in Esperanto: ''{{lang|eo|[[Angoroj]]}},'' in 1964, and ''[[Incubus (1965 film)|Incubus]],'' a 1965 [[B-movie]] horror film. A language school teaching Esperanto is featured in Graham Greene's novel ''[[The Confidential Agent]]'', which was made [[Confidential Agent|into a film]] starring Charles Boyer and Lauren Bacall (1945). Other amateur productions have been made, such as a dramatization of the novel ''{{lang|eo|Gerda Malaperis}}'' (Gerda Has Disappeared). In ''Stamboul Train'', Greene used Esperanto as the language on signs at the main train station in Budapest. A number of mainstream films in national languages have used Esperanto in some way.

Esperanto is used as the universal language in the far future of [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]'s ''[[Stainless Steel Rat]]'' and ''[[Deathworld]]'' stories. [[Poul Anderson]]'s story "[[High Treason (Anderson story)|High Treason]]" takes place in a future where Earth became united politically but was still divided into many languages and cultures, and Esperanto became the language of its space armed forces, fighting wars with various extraterrestrial races.

The opening song to the popular video game ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'', "{{lang|eo|Memoro de la Ŝtono}}", was written in Esperanto. It was the first game in the series that was played online, and would have players from both Japan and North America (official European support was added after the North American launch) playing together on the same servers, using an auto-translate tool to communicate. The composer, [[Nobuo Uematsu]], felt that Esperanto was a good language to symbolize worldwide unity.

In the geek fiction novel "Off to Be the Wizard", Esperanto is programmed as the language that triggers all of the wizard's spells. Philip, Martin's teacher, explains that this is because "no one really speaks Esperanto and it's easy to learn".

Esperanto is also found in the comic book series ''[[Saga (comic book)|Saga]]'' as the language Blue, spoken by the inhabitants of Wreath. It is rendered in blue-colored text. Blue is generally only spoken by inhabitants of Wreath, while most other cultures use a universal language that appears to be simply named "Language." Some Wreath inhabitants use translator rings to communicate with those who don't speak Blue. Magic seems to be activated via the linguistic medium of blue.

In the television show ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', the bulk of which takes place more than three million years in the future, crewman [[Arnold Rimmer]] constantly spends his time trying to learn Esperanto and failing, even compared to his bunkmate [[Dave Lister (Red Dwarf)|Dave Lister]] who only maintains a casual interest. Additionally many of the signs around the ship ''[[Red Dwarf ships#Red Dwarf|Red Dwarf]]'' are written in both English and Esperanto. The novel ''[[Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers]]'' states that, although not required, it is widely expected that officers in the Space Corps be fluent in the language, hence Rimmer's interest.

=== Science ===
[[File:Bertalan Farkas (Author - Rudolf Csiba).jpg|thumb|left|Hungarian astronaut [[Bertalan Farkas]], the first Esperantist in space.]]

In 1921 the [[French Academy of Sciences]] recommended using Esperanto for international scientific communication.<ref name="EspMov181" /> A few scientists and mathematicians, such as [[Maurice René Fréchet|Maurice Fréchet]] (mathematics), [[John C. Wells]] (linguistics), [[Helmar Frank]] (pedagogy and cybernetics), and [[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel laureate]] [[Reinhard Selten]] (economics) have published part of their work in Esperanto. Frank and Selten were among the founders of the [[Akademio Internacia de la Sciencoj San Marino|International Academy of Sciences]] in [[San Marino]], sometimes called the "Esperanto University", where Esperanto is the primary language of teaching and administration.<ref name="rande de pereo">{{cite web |url=http://www.liberafolio.org/2011/akademio-internacia-de-la-sciencoj-rande-de-pereo |title=Akademio Internacia de la Sciencoj rande de pereo |date=2011-09-05 |work=Libera Folio |language=Esperanto |accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref><ref name="AIS-">{{cite book |title=AIS&nbsp;— La Akademio Internacia de la Sciencoj San Marino / Die Internationale Akademie der Wissenschaften San Marino|last=Frank |first=Helmar |authorlink=Helmar Frank |author2=Fössmeier, Reinhard |year=2000 |publisher=Institut für Kybernetik |location= |isbn=978-3-929853-12-4 |page= |pages=449 |accessdate=July 1, 2012 |url=}}</ref>

=== Commerce and trade ===
Esperanto business groups have been active for many years. The French Chamber of Commerce did research in the 1920s and reported in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1921 that Esperanto seemed to be the best business language.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70817F8395810738DDDAF0994DA405B818EF1D3|title=PARIS BUSINESS MEN WOULD USE ESPERANTO; Chamber of Commerce Committee Finds It Useful as a Code in International Trade.|work=The New York Times|date=16 February 1921|accessdate=22 October 2013}}</ref>

=== Goals of the movement ===
Zamenhof's intention was to create an easy-to-learn language to foster international understanding. It was to serve as an international auxiliary language, that is, as a universal second language, not to replace ethnic languages. This goal was widely shared among Esperanto speakers in the early decades of the movement. Later, Esperanto speakers began to see the language and the culture that had grown up around it as ends in themselves, even if Esperanto is never adopted by the United Nations or other international organizations.<ref name="EspMov181" />

Those Esperanto speakers who want to see Esperanto adopted officially or on a large scale worldwide are commonly called ''{{lang|eo|[[Finvenkismo|finvenkistoj]]}}'', from ''{{lang|eo|fina venko}}'', meaning "final victory", or ''{{lang|eo|pracelistoj}}'', from ''{{lang|eo|pracelo}}'', meaning "original goal".<ref>[http://members.aol.com/enrike/BostnGlb.htm]  {{wayback|url=http://members.aol.com/enrike/BostnGlb.htm |date=20150219234054 }}</ref> Those who focus on the intrinsic value of the language are commonly called ''{{lang|eo|[[Raumism|raŭmistoj]]}}'', from [[Rauma, Finland|Rauma]], [[Finland]], where a declaration on the near-term unlikelihood of the "{{lang|eo|fina venko}}" and the value of Esperanto culture was made at the International Youth Congress in 1980.<ref>[http://www.esperanto.org/Ondo/H-silf55.htm]  {{wayback|url=http://www.esperanto.org/Ondo/H-silf55.htm |date=20130511160216 }}</ref>

The earliest flag, and the one most commonly used today, features a green five-pointed star against a white [[canton (flag)|canton]], upon a field of green. It was proposed to Zamenhof by [[Ireland|Irishman]] [[Richard H. Geoghegan|Richard Geoghegan]], author of the first Esperanto textbook for English speakers, in 1887. The flag was approved in 1905 by delegates to the first conference of Esperantists at Boulogne-sur-Mer. A version with an "{{lang|eo|E}}" superimposed over the green star is sometimes seen. Other variants include that for Christian Esperantists, with a white [[Christian cross]] superimposed upon the green star, and that for Leftists, with [[Red flag (politics)|the color of the field changed from green to red]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flagspot.net/flags/qy-eo.html|title=Flags of Esperanto|publisher=Flagspot.net|accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref>

In 1987, a second flag design was chosen in a contest organized by the UEA celebrating the first centennial of the language. It featured a white background with two stylised curved "E"s facing each other. Dubbed the "{{lang|eo|jubilea simbolo}}" ([[Esperanto jubilee symbol|jubilee symbol]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/qy-eo.html#jub |title=Esperanto flag: The jubilee symbol |publisher=Fotw.net |accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref> it attracted criticism from some Esperantists, who dubbed it the "{{lang|eo|melono}}" (melon) because of the design's elliptical shape. It is still in use, though to a lesser degree than the traditional symbol, known as the "{{lang|eo|verda stelo}}" (green star).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/qy-eo.html |title=Esperanto flag |publisher=Fotw.net |accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref>

=== Politics ===
Esperanto has been placed in many proposed political situations. The most popular of these is the [[Europe—Democracy—Esperanto]], which aims to establish Esperanto as the [[official language]] of the [[European Union]]. [[Grin's Report]], published in 2005 by [[François Grin]] found that the use of English as the lingua franca within the European Union costs billions annually and significantly benefits English-speaking countries financially. The report considered a scenario where Esperanto would be the lingua franca and found that it would have many advantages, particularly economically speaking, as well as ideologically.

=== Religion ===
Esperanto has served an important role in several religions, such as [[Oomoto]] from Japan and the [[Bahá'í Faith]] from [[Iran]], and has been encouraged by others, like some [[Spiritist]] movements.

==== Oomoto ====
The [[Oomoto]] religion encourages the use of Esperanto among its followers and includes Zamenhof as one of its deified spirits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oomoto.or.jp/Esperanto/index-es.html |title=The Oomoto Esperanto portal |publisher=Oomoto.or.jp |accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref>

==== Bahá'í Faith ====
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] encourages the [[Bahá'í Faith and auxiliary language|use of an auxiliary international language]]. The Baha'i's believe that it will not be the language of the future, although it has great potential in this role, as it has not been chosen by the people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bahai.de/bahaaeligo/angla/englisch.htm |title=The Baha'i Faith and Esperanto |publisher=Bahaa Esperanto-Ligo ( B.E.L. ) |accessdate=2006-08-26 }}</ref> [[L. L. Zamenhof]]'s daughter [[Lidia Zamenhof|Lidja]] became a Bahá'í,<ref name="BahaiEnc368" /> and various volumes of the [[Bahá'í literature]]s and other Baha'i books have been translated into Esperanto. In 1973, the [[Bahá'í Esperanto-League]] for active Bahá'í supporters of Esperanto was founded.

==== Spiritism ====
In 1908, [[Spiritism|spiritist]] Camilo Chaigneau wrote an article named "Spiritism and Esperanto" in the periodic ''La Vie d'Outre-Tombe'' recommending the use of Esperanto in a "central magazine" for all spiritists and esperantists. Esperanto then became actively promoted by spiritists, at least in [[Brazil]], initially by [[Ismael Gomes Braga]] and [[František Lorenz]]; the latter is known in Brazil as Francisco Valdomiro Lorenz, and was a pioneer of both spiritist and Esperantist movements in this country.<ref>{{pt icon}} [http://www.espirito.org.br/portal/artigos/geae/o-esp-e-o-esperanto.html O Espiritismo e o Esperanto (Spiritism and Esperanto)]</ref>

The Brazilian Spiritist Federation publishes Esperanto coursebooks, translations of [[Spiritist Codification|Spiritism's basic books]], and encourages Spiritists to become Esperantists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.math.uu.se/esperanto/207pardue.pdf#search=%22esperanto%20%2Breligion%22 |title=Uma só língua, uma só bandeira, um só pastor: Spiritism and Esperanto in Brazil by David Pardue|format=PDF|publisher=[[University of Kansas]] Libraries|accessdate=2006-08-26 }}</ref>

==== Bible translations ====
The first translation of the [[Bible]] into Esperanto was a translation of the [[Tanakh]] or Old Testament done by [[L. L. Zamenhof]]. The translation was reviewed and compared with other languages' translations by a group of British clergy and scholars before its publication at the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] in 1910. In 1926 this was published along with a New Testament translation, in an edition commonly called the "{{lang|eo|Londona Biblio}}". In the 1960s, the ''{{lang|eo|Internacia Asocio de Bibliistoj kaj Orientalistoj}}'' tried to organize a new, ecumenical Esperanto Bible version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.att.net/~el_sxadaj/kbiblio.htm |title=La Sankta Biblio&nbsp;– "Londona text" |publisher= |accessdate=2006-08-26|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061222215537/http://home.att.net/~el_sxadaj/kbiblio.htm|archivedate=2006-12-22 }}</ref> Since then, the Dutch Remonstrant pastor Gerrit Berveling has translated the [[Deuterocanonical]] or apocryphal books in addition to new translations of the Gospels, some of the New Testament epistles, and some books of the Tanakh or Old Testament. These have been published in various separate booklets, or serialized in ''{{lang|eo|Dia Regno}}'', but the [[Deuterocanonical]] books have appeared in recent editions of the Londona Biblio.

==== Christianity ====
[[File:Esperanto-meso La Habana 2010 (Peter Knauer).jpg|thumb|250px|Mass in Esperanto during the 95th World Congress of Esperanto in Havana.]]

Christian Esperanto organizations include two that were formed early in the history of Esperanto:
* 1910—The [[International Union of Catholic Esperantists]]. Two Roman Catholic popes, [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] and [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]], have regularly used Esperanto in their multilingual ''{{lang|la|[[urbi et orbi]]}}'' blessings at Easter and Christmas each year since Easter 1994.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
* 1911—The [[List of Esperanto organizations#Religion|International Christian Esperantists League]].

Individual churches using Esperanto include:
* The [[Quaker]] Esperanto Society, with activities as described in an issue of "The Friend"<ref>{{cite journal
|journal=The Friend
|title=Esperanto Lives On
|author=Eric Walker
|date=27 May 2005

* 1910—First [[Christadelphian]] publications in Esperanto.<ref>Botten J. The Captive Conscience 2002 p.110 re.

* There are instances of [[Christian apologetics|Christian apologists]] and teachers who use Esperanto as a medium. Nigerian pastor Bayo Afolaranmi's "{{lang|eo|[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/spiritanutrajxo/ Spirita nutraĵo]}}" (spiritual food) Yahoo mailing list, for example, has hosted weekly messages since 2003.<ref>{{cite web

[[Chick Publications]], publisher of [[Fundamentalist Christianity|Protestant fundamentalist]] themed evangelistic tracts, has published a number of comic book style tracts by [[Jack T. Chick]] translated into Esperanto, including "This Was Your Life!" ("{{lang|eo|Jen Via Tuta Vivo!}}")<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chick.com/reading/tracts/1370/1370_01.asp |title=Esperanto "This Was Your Life" |publisher=Chick.com |accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref>

==== Islam ====
[[Ayatollah Khomeini]] of Iran called on Muslims to learn Esperanto and praised its use as a medium for better understanding among peoples of different religious backgrounds. After he suggested that Esperanto replace English as an international [[lingua franca]], it began to be used in the seminaries of [[Qom]]. An Esperanto translation of the Qur'an was published by the state shortly thereafter.<ref name="webcom">{{cite web|url=http://www.webcom.com/~donh/efaq.html |title=Esperanto&nbsp;– Have any governments opposed Esperanto?|publisher=Donald J.

== Criticism ==
{{Main|Criticism of Esperanto}}

Esperanto was conceived as a language of international communication, more precisely as a universal [[second language]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esperanto.org.nz/what_is_eo.html |title=Esperanto.org |publisher=Esperanto.org |accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref> Since publication, there has been debate over whether it is possible for Esperanto to attain this position, and whether it would be an improvement for international communication were it to do so; Esperanto proponents have also been criticized for diverting public funds to encourage its study over more-useful living [[world language]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christopherculver.com/en/writings/esperanto.php |title=Christopherculver.com |publisher=Christopherculver.com |accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref>

Since Esperanto is a planned language, there have been many criticisms of minor points.<ref>There have been a number of attempts to reform the language, the most well-known of which is the language {{lang|io|[[Ido (language)|Ido]]}} which resulted in a schism in the community at the time, beginning in 1907. See "Why {{lang|io|Ido}}?" The International Language of {{lang|io|Ido}}. 18 March 2008. 4 February 2009 [http://www.idolinguo.org.uk/whyido.htm Idolinguo.org.uk.]</ref> An example is Zamenhof's choice of the word ''{{lang|eo|edzo}}'' over something like ''{{lang|eo|spozo}}'' for "husband, spouse",<ref name=WhyIdo>"Why {{lang|io|Ido}}?" The International Language of {{lang|io|Ido}}. 18 March 2008. 4 February 2009 [http://www.idolinguo.org.uk/whyido.htm Idolinguo.org].</ref> or his choice of the Classic Greek and Old Latin singular and plural endings ''-{{lang|eo|o}}, -{{lang|eo|oj}}, -{{lang|eo|a}}, -{{lang|eo|aj}}'' over their Medieval contractions ''-{{lang|eo|o}}, -{{lang|eo|i}}, -{{lang|eo|a}}, -{{lang|eo|e}}.'' (Both these changes were adopted by the {{lang|io|Ido}} reform, though {{lang|io|Ido}} dispensed with adjectival agreement altogether.) Some more common examples of general criticism include the following:
* Esperanto has not yet achieved the hopes of its founder to become a universal second language. Well over a century since its publication, the Esperanto-speaking community remains comparatively tiny with respect to the world population. In the case of the [[United Kingdom]], for instance, Esperanto is rarely taught in schools, because it is regarded by the government as not meeting the needs of the national [[curriculum]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Who, What, Why? |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7505820.stm |title=Bbc News |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-07-16 |accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref>
* The vocabulary and grammar are based on major European languages, and are not universal. Both the grammar and the 'international' vocabulary are difficult for many Asians, among others, and give an advantage to speakers of European languages.<ref name="autogenerated2" />
* The vocabulary, diacritic letters,<ref name=WhyIdo /> and grammar are too dissimilar from the major European languages,{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} and therefore Esperanto is not as easy as it could be for speakers of those languages to learn, even though it is much easier to learn than any other European language.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://claudepiron.free.fr/articlesenanglais/communication.htm|title=Claude Piron, articles en anglais: "Linguistic Communication – A Comparative Field Study"|publisher=Claudepiron.free.fr|accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref><ref>C.E. King, A.S. Bryntsev, F.D. Sohn, Report on the implications of additional languages in the United Nations system, Geneva: UN, Joint Inspection Unit, 1977, document A/32/237</ref>  Attempts to address the "not European enough" criticism include the younger planned languages {{lang|io|[[Ido (language)|Ido]]}} and [[Interlingua]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.language-learning-advisor.com/what-is-esperanto.html |title=What is Esperanto? |publisher=Langsuuage-learning-advisor.com |accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref>
* Either that Esperanto has no native culture,<ref name="critiche">{{cite web|url=http://parracomumangi.altervista.org/domande.htm |title=Critiche all'esperanto ed alle altre lingue internazionali |publisher=Parracomumangi.altervista.org |accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref> or that Esperanto culture is Euro-centric. Although it has a large international literature, Esperanto does not encapsulate a specific culture. Its vocabulary and semantics are derived from European languages. Both infuse the language with a European world view.<ref>[http://dok.esperantic.org/ced/eurlan.htm Europe's Babylon] {{wayback|url=http://dok.esperantic.org/ced/eurlan.htm |date=20121222105548 }}</ref>
* The vocabulary is too large. Rather than deriving new words from existing roots, large numbers of new roots are adopted into the language with the intent of being internationally accommodating when in reality the language only caters to European languages. This makes the language more difficult for non-Europeans than it needs to be.<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web|url=http://www.rickharrison.com/language/bloated.html |title=Is Esperanto's vocabulary bloated? |publisher=Rickharrison.com |accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref> A similar argument is made by many Esperanto speakers, not against the language itself but against the way it is (in their view) misused by many (mostly European) speakers; they argue that compounds or derivations should be used whenever possible, and new root words borrowed only when absolutely necessary.<ref name="piron1989">''{{lang|eo|La Bona Lingvo}}'', [[Claude Piron]]. Vienna: {{lang|eo|Pro Esperanto}}, 1989. ''{{lang|eo|La lingvo volas eleganti, ne elefanti.}}'' "The language wants to be elegant, not elephantine."</ref><ref name="corsetti2007">[http://www.bonalingvo.it/index.php/%C4%88i-tiu_Esperanto_estus_turka] {{dead link|date=January 2015}}</ref>
* Esperanto asymmetry in gender formation makes it [[sexism|sexist]].<ref name="critiche" /> Most kin terms and titles are masculine by default and only feminine when so specified. There have been many attempts to address this issue, of which one of the better known is iĉism<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bertilow.com/pmeg/gramatiko/o-vortoj/seksa_signifo.html|title=PMEG|publisher=Bertilow.com|accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref> (used by the Esperantist writer [[Jorge Camacho (writer)|Jorge Camacho]]),<ref>Camacho, Jorge. ''{{lang|eo|Sur la linio. Rakontoj kaj noveloj de Georgo Kamaĉo. Enkonduko de Fernando de Diego.}}&nbsp;– Berkeley : {{lang|eo|Eldonejo Bero}}, 1991''.</ref> from which [[Riism]] derived.
* Esperanto is, looks, and/or sounds artificial. This criticism is often due to the letters with circumflex diacritics, which some find odd or cumbersome, along with their being invented specifically for Esperanto rather than borrowed from existing languages; as well as being arguably unnecessary, as for example with the use of ''ŭ'' instead of ''w''.<ref name="critiche" /> Others claim that an artificial language will necessarily be deficient, due to its very nature,<ref name="piron1994">Claude Piron cites and replies to several such criticisms in his ''{{lang|fr|Le Défi des Langues}}'' (Paris: L'Harmattan, 1994).</ref> although the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] has found that Esperanto fulfills all the requirements of a living language.<ref>''{{lang|eo|Laŭ la komuna opinio de gvidaj fakuloj de la Instituto, Esperanto apartenas al la kategorio de vivaj lingvoj. Pli detale traktante la temon, konsiderante la historion kaj la nunan staton de Esperanto, a.) ĝi estas grandmezure normigita, b.) amplekse sociiĝinta, c.) ne-etna viva lingvo, kiu en sekundara lingva komunumo plenumas ĉiujn eblajn lingvajn funkciojn, kaj samtempe ĝi funkcias kiel pera lingvo.&nbsp;– Ĉi supre diritaj respegulas la sciencan starpunkton de nia Instituto.}} {{lang|eo|[http://www.esperanto.hu/hu-lernejo.htm "Malgranda fina venko". El Hungario]}}</ref> In [[Culture and Value]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] said: {{quote|Esperanto. The feeling of disgust we get if we utter an invented word with invented derivative syllables. The word is cold, lacking in associations, and yet it plays at being 'language'. A system of purely written signs would not disgust us so much.<ref name="culture and value">{{cite web|url=http://www.autodidactproject.org/quote/wittgenstein_esperanto.html |title=Wittgenstein on Esperanto |publisher=The Autodidact Project |accessdate=2012-07-17}}</ref>}}

== Modifications ==
{{Main|Esperantido}}

Though Esperanto itself has changed little since the publication of the ''{{lang|eo|[[Fundamento de Esperanto]]}}'' (Foundation of Esperanto), a number of reform projects have been proposed over the years, starting with [[Reformed Esperanto|Zamenhof's proposals in 1894]] and {{lang|io|[[Ido (language)|Ido]]}} in 1907. Several later constructed languages, such as [[Universal (Esperantido)|Universal]], were based on Esperanto.

In modern times, attempts have been made to eliminate perceived sexism in the language, such as [[Riism]].

== Eponymous entities ==
There are some geographical and astronomical features named after Esperanto, or after its creator L. L. Zamenhof. These include [[Esperanto Island]] in [[Zed Islands]] off [[Livingston Island]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/scar/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=136818|title=Esperanto Island|publisher=Data.aad.gov.au|accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref> and the asteroids [[1421 Esperanto]] and [[1462 Zamenhof]] discovered by Finnish astronomer and Esperantist [[Yrjö Väisälä]].
