All-star teams popped up, and with them the creation of the United States All-Star Federation (USASF). ESPN first broadcast the National High School Cheerleading Competition nationwide in 1983. Cheerleading organizations such as the American Association of Cheerleading Coaches and Advisors (AACCA), founded in 1987, started applying universal safety standards to decrease the number of injuries and prevent dangerous stunts, pyramids and tumbling passes from being included in the cheerleading routines.<extension extension_name='ref' name="AACCA"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="title">About the AACCA<space/></arg><arg name="url">http://www.aacca.org/about.asp<space/></arg><arg name="archiveurl">http://web.archive.org/web/20061206110741/http://www.aacca.org/about.asp<space/></arg><arg name="archivedate">2006-12-06<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2007-01-11</arg></template></extension><space/>In 2003, the National Council for Spirit Safety and Education (NCSSE) was formed to offer safety training for youth, school, all star and college coaches.

Cheerleaders are quite often seen as ambassadors for their schools, and leaders among the student body.

Several colleges that compete at cheerleading competitions offer cheerleading scholarships. School-sponsored cheerleading promotes school spirit, motivates the players and fans as well as gives enjoyment for the participants. A cheerleading team may compete (local, regional, and national competitions), as well as cheer for sporting events and encourage audience participation. Cheerleading is quickly becoming year-round, starting with tryouts during the spring of the preceding school year, organized camp as a team, practices, attendance at various events and ending with National competition season, typically from winter through spring.</paragraph><paragraph>School cheerleaders also compete with recreational-style routines at many competitions year-round. They practice intensely for them and come up with a no greater than 2 minute 30 second routine to show off at the competitions. Like other school-level athletes they compete to win their league title and move on to bigger competitions eventually reaching nationals, the ultimate title for a school squad. The advantages to a school squad versus an all-star squad is cheering at various games. For some squads the level of competition on the weekends can equal that of an all-star squad.</paragraph><paragraph>The tryout process sometimes takes place over many days. The cheerleading coach usually will arrange for a cheerleading clinic, during which basic materials are taught or reviewed before the final day of tryouts. The clinic gives returning cheerleaders and new cheerleaders an equal chance of becoming familiar with the material. Skills that coaches look for include jumps, tumbling, motions, and dance ability. Tryouts often take place during the spring, so that the coach has the squad chosen in time to attend summer camp as a team.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Middle school</heading><paragraph><link><target>Middle school</target></link><space/>cheerleading evolved shortly after high school squads started.

However, many middle school cheer squads will go year-round like high school squads. Middle school cheerleaders use the same cheerleading movements as their older counterparts, yet they perform less extreme stunts. These stunts range from simple elevators, knee stands, and extensions to harder stunts such as the heel stretch and scorpion.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">January 2011</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Mercer Island High School Cheerleaders.jpg</target><part>left</part><part>thumb</part><part>275px</part><part>High school cheerleaders</part></link></paragraph><heading level='4'>High school</heading><paragraph>In high school, there are usually two squads per school:<space/><link><target>varsity team</target><part>varsity</part></link><space/>and a<space/><link><target>junior varsity team</target><part>junior varsity</part></link>.

Most squads practice at least three days a week for about two hours each practice during the summer. Many teams also attend separate tumbling sessions outside of practice. During the school year, cheerleading is usually practiced five- to six-days-a-week. During competition season it often becomes seven days with practice twice a day sometimes. The school spirit aspect of cheerleading involves cheering, supporting, and &quot;pumping up&quot; the crowd at football games, basketball games, and even at wrestling meets. Along with this they make posters, perform at pep rallies, and bring school spirit to the other students.

In 1986, the National Cheerleaders Association (NCA) addressed this situation by creating a separate division for teams lacking a sponsoring school or athletic association, calling it the All-Star Division and debuting it at their 1987 competitions. As the popularity of this type of team grew, more and more of them were formed, attending competitions sponsored by many different organizations and companies, each using its own set of rules, regulations and divisions. This situation became a concern to gym owners because the inconsistencies caused coaches to keep their routines in a constant state of flux, detracting from time that could be better utilized for developing skills and providing personal attention to their athletes. More importantly, because the various companies were constantly vying for a competitive edge, safety standards had become more and more lax. In some cases, unqualified coaches and inexperienced squads were attempting dangerous stunts as a result of these expanded sets of rules.<extension extension_name='ref' name="varsity2004"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="title"><space/>The Cheerleading Worlds Administered by the USASF<space/></arg><arg name="publisher"><space/>Varsity Brands, Inc.<space/></arg><arg name="url"><space/>http://www.varsity.com/index.asp?article</arg><arg name="accessdate"><space/>2007-09-20<space/></arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The USASF was formed in 2003 by the competition companies to act as the national governing body for all star cheerleading and to create a standard set of rules and judging standards to be followed by all competitions sanctioned by the Federation, ultimately leading to the Cheerleading Worlds.

The squad prepares year-round for many different competition appearances, but they only actually perform for up to 2 minutes during their team's routines. The numbers of competitions a team participates in varies from team to team, but generally, most teams tend to participate in eight to twelve competitions a year. These competitions include locals, which are normally taken place in school gymnasiums or local venues, nationals, hosted in big venues all around the U.S. with national champions, and the Cheerleading Worlds, taken place at Disney World in Orlando, Florida. During a competition routine, a squad performs carefully choreographed stunting, tumbling, jumping, and dancing to their own custom music. Teams create their routines to an eight-count system and apply that to the music so that the team members execute the elements with precise timing and synchronization.</paragraph><paragraph>There are many different organizations that host their own state and national competitions. Some major companies include: Universal Spirit, AmeriCheer, Cheersport, Planet Spirit, Eastern Cheer and Dance Association, and<space/><link><target>JAM Brands</target><part>The JAM Brands</part></link>. This means that many gyms within the same area could be state and national champions for the same year and never have competed against each other. Currently, there is no system in place that awards only one state or national title.</paragraph><paragraph>Judges at the competition watch closely for illegal moves from the group or any individual member. Here, an illegal move is something that is not allowed in that division due to difficulty and/or safety restrictions. They look out for deductions, or things that go wrong, such as a dropped stunt. They also look for touch downs in tumbling for deductions. More generally, judges look at the difficulty and execution of jumps, stunts and tumbling, synchronization, creativity, the sharpness of the motions, showmanship, and overall routine execution.</paragraph><paragraph>All-star cheerleaders are placed into divisions, which are grouped based upon age, size of the team, gender of participants, and ability level.
