The area was originally part of the<space/><link><target>Worcestershire</target></link><space/>parish of<space/><link><target>King's Norton</target></link>, and was added to the<space/><link><target>county borough</target></link><space/>of Birmingham in<space/><link><target>Warwickshire</target></link><space/>on 1 October 1891.</paragraph><paragraph>During negotiations in the previous year it had been promised a public baths and a free library.

By this time the small lake (<italics>Lady Pool</italics><space/>on old maps) at the end of Ladypool Road had been filled-in to create a park.<space/></paragraph><paragraph>Balsall Heath initially had a reasonably affluent population, which can still be seen in the dilapidated grandeur of some of the larger houses. A railway station on Brighton Road (on the Birmingham to<space/><link><target>Bristol</target></link><space/>line) led to further expansion, and the end of the 19th century saw a proliferation of high-density small<space/><link><target>terraced house</target><trail>s</trail></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>A<space/><link><target>Muslim</target></link><space/>community was started in June 1940 when two<space/><link><target>Yemen</target><trail>is</trail></link><space/>purchased an artisan cottage on Mary Street. They went on to establish the first mosque in the city. With the mosque being located in the area, more Muslim immigrants began to move into private lodgings in Balsall Heath.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="author">Abner Cohen</arg><arg name="title">Urban Ethnicity</arg><arg name="pages">96</arg><arg name="year">2004</arg><arg name="publisher">Routledge</arg><arg name="isbn">0-415-32982-5</arg></template></extension><space/>Today, Balsall Heath has one of the largest Muslim communities in Birmingham. It is also home to diverse communities from across the<space/><link><target>Commonwealth of Nations</target><part>Commonwealth</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>By the 1980s, many of Balsall Heath's houses were in a dilapidated condition, some were still without bathrooms or indoor toilets. The local council considered demolishing these properties but chose to refurbish them as part of an<space/><link><target>urban renewal</target></link><space/>scheme. Most of these Victorian terraces still exist and, along with more modern<space/><link><target>social housing</target></link>, characterise the area today. The area's traditional 'brick' pavements were replaced at this time by the more modern and conventional paving slabs.<space/></paragraph><paragraph>Balsall Heath's low rents also attracted a<space/><link><target>Bohemianism</target><part>bohemian</part></link><space/>student population. Its proximity to the<space/><link><target>University of Birmingham</target></link>, the city centre and the 'trendy' area of<space/><link><target>Moseley</target></link><space/>were all contributing factors. There was little conflict between the students and locals despite their vastly differing lifestyles. However a knife-incident in 1991 led to an article in<space/><link><target>Redbrick (Newspaper)</target><part>Redbrick</part></link><space/>warning students not to live in the area.</paragraph><paragraph>In July 2005 Balsall Heath was hit by a<space/><link><target>Birmingham Tornado (UK)</target><part>tornado</part></link>, which devastated many buildings around Church Road and Ladypool Road. Birmingham City Council offered loans to those who were unable to repair their properties, and the area has now made a full recovery.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Red light era</heading><paragraph><link><target>Street prostitution</target></link><space/>first appeared in Balsall Heath during the 1950s.

By the 1970s the area was notorious for<space/><link><target>robbery</target><part>street robberies</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>drug dealing</target></link>. Cheddar Road was the centre of a red-light district worked by 450 women. About half of the 50 houses on this road had prostitutes advertising themselves in the windows, similar to<space/><link><target>De Wallen</target><part>Amsterdam</part></link>.
