It begins with Achilles' withdrawal from battle after he is dishonored by<space/><link><target>Agamemnon</target></link>, the commander of the<space/><link><target>Achaeans (Homer)</target><part>Achaean</part></link><space/>forces.

The prophet<space/><link><target>Calchas</target></link><space/>correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless Achilles vows to protect him. Achilles does so and Calchas declares Chryseis must be returned to her father. Agamemnon consents, but then commands that Achilles' battle prize<space/><link><target>Briseis</target></link><space/>be brought to him to replace Chryseis. Angry at the dishonor of having his plunder and glory taken away (and as he says later, because he loved Briseis),<extension extension_name='ref'><italics>Iliad</italics><space/>9.334343.</extension><space/>with the urging of his mother Thetis, Achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces. At this same time, burning with rage over Agamemnon's theft, Achilles prays to Thetis to convince Zeus to help the Trojans gain ground in the war, so that he may regain his honor.</paragraph><paragraph>As the battle turns against the Greeks, thanks to the influence of Zeus,<space/><link><target>Nestor (mythology)</target><part>Nestor</part></link><space/>declares that the Trojans are winning because Agamemnon has angered Achilles, and urges the king to appease the warrior.

Here is his temple and his statue, an archaic work. This island is not inhabited, and goats graze on it, not many, which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships, sacrifice to Achilles. In this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts, craters, rings and precious stones, offered to Achilles in gratitude. One can still read inscriptions in Greek and Latin, in which Achilles is praised and celebrated. Some of these are worded in Patroclus honor, because those who wish to be favored by Achilles, honor Patroclus at the same time. There are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds, which look after Achilles temple. Every morning they fly out to sea, wet their wings with water, and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it. And after they finish the sprinkling, they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings. Other people say still more, that some of the men who reach this island, come here intentionally. They bring animals in their ships, destined to be sacrificed. Some of these animals they slaughter, others they set free on the island, in Achilles honor. But there are others, who are forced to come to this island by sea storms. As they have no sacrificial animals, but wish to get them from the god of the island himself, they consult Achilles oracle. They ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island, and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair. But in case the oracle denies them permission, because there is an oracle here, they add something to the price offered, and if the oracle refuses again, they add something more, until at last, the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient. And then the victim doesnt run away any more, but waits willingly to be caught. So, there is a great quantity of silver there, consecrated to the hero, as price for the sacrificial victims. To some of the people who come to this island, Achilles appears in dreams, to others he would appear even during their navigation, if they were not too far away, and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships&quot;. (quoted in Densuianu)</paragraph><paragraph>The heroic cult of Achilles on Leuce island was widespread in antiquity, not only along the sea lanes of the<space/><link><target>Black Sea</target><part>Pontic Sea</part></link><space/>but also in maritime cities whose economic interests were tightly connected to the riches of the Black Sea.</paragraph><paragraph>Achilles from Leuce island was venerated as<space/><italics>Pontarches</italics><space/>the lord and master of the Pontic Sea, the protector of sailors and navigation.
