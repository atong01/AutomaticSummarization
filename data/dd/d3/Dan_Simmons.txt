'''Dan Simmons''' (born April 4, 1948) is an American [[science fiction]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]] writer and author of the [[Hugo Award]]-winning science fiction series, the [[Hyperion Cantos]], and the [[Locus Awards|Locus]]-winning [[Ilium/Olympos]] cycle.

His work spans the science fiction, horror and fantasy [[genres]], sometimes within a single novel: a typical example of Simmons' intermingling of genres is ''[[Song of Kali]]'' (1985), winner of [[World Fantasy Award]].<ref name="WWE-1986"/> He also writes mysteries and [[thriller (genre)|thriller]]s, some of which feature the continuing character Joe Kurtz.

==Biography==
Born in [[Peoria, Illinois]], Simmons received a B.A. in English from [[Wabash College]] in 1970, and, in 1971, a Masters in Education from [[Washington University in St. Louis]].

He soon started to write short stories, although his career did not take off until 1982, when, through [[Harlan Ellison]]'s help, his short story "[[Prayers to Broken Stones#"The River Styx Runs Upstream"|The River Styx Runs Upstream]]" was published and awarded first prize in a ''[[Twilight Zone Magazine]]'' story competition. His first novel, ''Song of Kali'', was released in 1985.

He worked in elementary education until 1989.

==Horror fiction==
''[[Summer of Night]]'' (1991) recounts the childhood of a group of pre-teens who band together in the 1960s to defeat a centuries-old evil that terrorizes their hometown of Elm Haven, [[Illinois]]. The novel, which was praised by [[Stephen King]]{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}, is similar to King's ''[[It (novel)|It]]'' in its focus on small town life, the corruption of innocence, the return of an ancient evil, and the responsibility for others that emerges with the transition from youth to adulthood.

In the sequel to ''Summer of Night'', ''[[A Winter Haunting]]'', Dale Stewart (one of the first book's protagonists, and now an adult), revisits his boyhood home to come to grips with mysteries that have disrupted his adult life. ''[[Children of the Night (Simmons novel)|Children of the Night]]'', another loose sequel, features Mike O'Rourke, now much older and a Roman Catholic priest, who is sent on a mission to investigate bizarre events in a European city. Another ''Summer of Night'' character, Dale's younger brother, Lawrence Stewart, appears as a minor character in Simmons' thriller ''Darwin's Blade,'' while the adult Cordie Cooke appears in ''[[Fires of Eden]]''.

Soon after ''[[Summer of Night]]'', Simmons, who had written mostly horror fiction, began to focus on writing science fiction, although in 2007 he returned with a work of [[historical fiction]] and horror, ''[[The Terror (novel)|The Terror]]''. In 2009 he also wrote a book, ''[[Drood (novel)|Drood]]'', based on the last years of [[Charles Dickens]]' life, those leading up to the writing of ''[[The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]'', which Dickens had partially completed at the time of his death.<ref name="st090215"/>

==Historical fiction==

''The Terror'' (2007) crosses the bridge between horror and historical fiction. It is a fictionalized account of Captain Sir John Franklin's expedition to find the Northwest Passage. The two ships ''HMS Erebus'' and ''HMS Terror'' become icebound the first winter, and the captains and crew struggle to survive while being stalked across an Arctic landscape by a monster.

''The Abominable'' (2013) recounts a late 1920's attempt on Mount Everest by five climbers—two English, one French, one Sherpa, and one American, the narrator—to recover the body of the cousin of one of the English characters. What follows is a tale of the early days of mountain climbing, a history of the early assaults on Everest, intrigue, espionage, and human dedication and willpower.

==Literary references==
Simmons became famous in [[1989 in literature|1989]] for ''Hyperion'', winner of Hugo and [[Locus Award]]s for the best science fiction novel.<ref name="WWE-1990"/> This novel deals with a space war, and is inspired in its structure by [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio's]] ''[[Decameron]]'' and [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''.

Many of his works have similarly strong ties with classic literature:{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}
* ''[[Carrion Comfort]]'' derives its title and many of its themes from a poem by [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]]
* ''Vanni Fucci Is Alive and Well and Living In Hell'', a 1988 short story lampooning [[televangelist]]s included in ''[[Prayers to Broken Stones]]'', is about a brief return to earth by the title character, an inhabitant of [[Dante]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy|Inferno]]''
* The ''[[Hyperion Cantos]]'' take their titles from poems by the English Romantic, [[John Keats]].
* The basic structure of ''[[Hyperion (Simmons novel)|Hyperion]]'' is taken from the Middle-English cycle of stories ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''. A varied group of individuals are on a pilgrimage to solicit a kind of demon-god called the Shrike on the planet Hyperion in a universe on the edge of the apocalypse. Each pilgrim tells his or her tale of why they are going to see the Shrike. ''The Fall of Hyperion'' is the conclusion to the story of the pilgrims rather than a stand-alone sequel. ''Hyperion'' and ''Fall of Hyperion'' are essentially one work in two volumes.
* ''[[The Hollow Man (1992 novel)|The Hollow Man]]'' (1992) is influenced by Dante's ''Inferno'' and [[T. S. Eliot]]
* A short story from [[1993 in literature|1993]], ''The Great Lover'', is inspired by the [[World War I]] [[War Poets]].
* In ''[[The Fall of Hyperion (novel)|The Fall of Hyperion]]'', [[John Keats]] appears as one of the main characters, with references to characters in ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'' and ''[[The Time Machine]]''.
* His ''[[Ilium/Olympos]]'' cycle is inspired by [[Homer]]'s works. Both Shakespeare and Proust are mentioned as well.
* The character of Ada and her home Ardis Hall in the ''Ilium'' cycle are inspired by [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s novel ''[[Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle|Ada or Ardor]]'', which was one of Nabokov's forays into the science fiction genre and alternate history.
* His collection of short stories, ''Worlds Enough & Time'', takes its name from the first line of the poem ''[[His Coy Mistress|To His Coy Mistress]]'' by British poet Andrew Marvell: 'Had we but world enough, and time,'.
* The detective in ''Flashback'' is named [[Nick Bottom]] after the character in Shakespeare's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.

==Screen adaptations==
In 2009, [[Scott Derrickson]] was set to direct ''"Hyperion Cantos"'' for [[Warner Bros.]] and Graham King, with Trevor Sands penning the script to blend the first two cantos "Hyperion" and "The Fall of Hyperion" into one film.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fleming|first=Michael|title=Scott Derrickson to direct 'Hyperion'|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117999283?refCatId=13|publisher=[[variety.com]]|accessdate=2012-12-10|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6CoW8C7Fr|archivedate=2012-12-10|date=Jan 29, 2009}}</ref>  In 2011, actor [[Bradley Cooper]] expressed interest in taking over the adaptation.<ref>{{cite web|last=Falconer|first=Robert |title=Bradley Cooper Anxious to Adapt Dan Simmons’s Hyperion for the Screen|publisher=[[cinemaspy.com]]|url=http://www.cinemaspy.com/movie-news/bradley-cooper-anxious-to-adapt-dan-simmonss-hyperion-for-the-screen-7564|accessdate=2012-12-10|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6CoWkcEaJ|archivedate=2012-12-10|date=May 27, 2011}}</ref> It was recently announced that TV channel [[Syfy]] will produce a mini-series based on the Hyperion Cantos with the involvement of Cooper and King.<ref>{{cite web|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley |title=Bradley Cooper, Graham King, Todd Phillips Adapting Dan Simmons' 'Hyperion' for Syfy|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/bradley-cooper-graham-king-todd-801537|publisher=[[Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=2015-08-05|date=June 10, 2015}}</ref>
