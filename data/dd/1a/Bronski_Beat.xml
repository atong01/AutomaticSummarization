It was a success, reaching #3 in the UK,<extension extension_name='ref' name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums"></extension><space/>equalling the chart achievement of &quot;Smalltown Boy&quot;. Although the original had been one of Marc Almond's all-time favourite songs, he sang &quot;What'll it be, what'll it be, you and me&quot; instead of &quot;Falling free, falling free, falling free&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>The band and their producer Mike Thorne had gone back into the studio in early 1985 to record a new single, &quot;Run From Love&quot;. PolyGram (London Records' parent company at that time) had pressed a number of promo singles and 12&quot; versions of the song, sending them out to both radio and record stores in the UK. However, the single was shelved as tensions in the band, both personal and political, resulted in Somerville leaving Bronski Beat in the summer of that year.</paragraph><paragraph>&quot;Run From Love&quot; was subsequently released in a<space/><link><target>remix</target></link><space/>form on the Bronski Beat album<space/><italics><link><target>Hundreds &amp; Thousands (album)</target><part>Hundreds &amp; Thousands</part></link></italics>, a collection of mostly remixes (LP) and<space/><link><target>A-side and B-side</target><part>b-sides</part></link><space/>(as bonus tracks on the CD version) as well as the hit &quot;I Feel Love&quot;.

A second single, &quot;C'mon C'mon&quot;, also charted in the UK Top 20 and an album,<space/><italics><link><target>Truthdare Doubledare</target></link></italics>, released in May 1986, peaked at #18.<extension extension_name='ref' name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums"></extension><space/>The film<space/><italics><link><target>Parting Glances</target></link></italics><space/>(1986) included Bronski Beat songs &quot;Love and Money&quot;, &quot;Smalltown Boy&quot; and &quot;Why?&quot;. During this period, the band teamed up with producer Mark Cunningham on the first-ever<space/><link><target>BBC</target></link><space/><link><target>Children In Need</target></link><space/>single, a cover of David Bowie's &quot;<link><target>Heroes (David Bowie song)</target><part>Heroes</part></link>&quot;, released in 1986 under the name of The County Line.</paragraph><paragraph>Foster left the band in 1987. Following Foster's departure, Bronski Beat began work on their next album,<space/><italics>Out and About</italics>. The tracks were recorded at Berry Street studios in London with engineer Brian Pugsley. Some of the song titles were &quot;The Final Spin&quot; and &quot;Peace And Love&quot;. The latter track featured<space/><link><target>Strawberry Switchblade</target></link><space/>vocalist Rose McDowell and appeared on several internet sites in 2006. One of the other songs from the project called &quot;European Boy&quot; was recorded in 1987 by disco group Splash. The lead singer of Splash was former<space/><link><target>Tight Fit</target></link><space/>singer Steve Grant. Steinbachek and Bronski toured extensively with the new material and got great reviews, however the project was abandoned as the group were dropped by London Records. Also in 1987, Bronski Beat and Somerville performed at a reunion concert for &quot;International AIDS Day&quot;, supported by<space/><link><target>New Order</target></link>, at the<space/><link><target>Brixton Academy</target></link>, London.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1989, Jonathan Hellyer became lead singer, and the band extensively toured the U.S. and Europe with back-up vocalist Annie Conway and had one minor hit with the song &quot;Cha Cha Heels&quot;, a one-off collaboration sung by American actress and singer<space/><link><target>Eartha Kitt</target></link>. The song was originally written for movie and recording star<space/><link><target>Divine (actor)</target><part>Divine</part></link>, who was unable to record the song before his death in 1988. 199091 saw Bronski Beat release three further singles on the Zomba record label, &quot;I'm Gonna Run Away&quot;, &quot;One More Chance&quot; and &quot;What More Can I Say&quot;. The singles were produced by Mike Thorne.</paragraph><paragraph>Foster and Bronski Beat teamed up again in 1994, and released a<space/><link><target>techno</target></link><space/>&quot;Tell Me Why '94&quot; and an<space/><link><target>acoustic music</target><part>acoustic</part></link><space/>&quot;Smalltown Boy '94&quot; on the German<space/><link><target>record label</target></link>,<space/><link><target>ZYX Music</target></link>. The album<space/><italics>Rainbow Nation</italics><space/>was released the following year with Hellyer returning as lead vocalist, as Foster had dropped out of the project. Bronski Beat then dissolved with Steve Bronski going on to become a producer for other artists. Larry Steinbachek became the musical director for<space/><link><target>Michael Laub</target></link>'s theatre company, 'Remote Control Productions'.</paragraph><paragraph>In 2007, Bronski remixed the song &quot;Stranger To None&quot; by the UK<space/><link><target>alternative rock</target></link><space/>band,<space/><link><target>All Living Fear</target></link>. Four different mixes were done, with one appearing on their retrospective album,<space/><italics>Fifteen Years After</italics>. Bronski also remixed the track &quot;Flowers in the Morning&quot; by Northern Irish<space/><link><target>electronic music</target><part>electronic</part></link><space/>band, Electrobronze in 2007, changing the style of the song from<space/><link><target>Classical music</target><part>classical</part></link><space/>to<space/><link><target>Hi-NRG</target></link><space/>disco.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Members</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem>Steve Bronski keyboards, percussion<space/><xhtml:small>(198395)</xhtml:small></listitem><listitem>Larry Steinbachek keyboards, percussion<space/><xhtml:small>(198395)</xhtml:small></listitem><listitem><link><target>Jimmy Somerville</target></link><space/>vocals<space/><xhtml:small>(198385, 1987)</xhtml:small></listitem><listitem><link><target>John Foster (singer)</target><part>John Foster</part></link><space/>vocals<space/><xhtml:small>(19851987, 199495)</xhtml:small></listitem><listitem>Jonathan Hellyer vocals<space/><xhtml:small>(198994)</xhtml:small></listitem></list><heading level='2'>Discography</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Bronski Beat discography</arg></template></paragraph><list type='def'><listitem><defkey>Studio albums</defkey></listitem></list><list type='bullet'><listitem>1984:<space/><italics><link><target>The Age of Consent</target></link></italics></listitem><listitem>1986:<space/><italics><link><target>Truthdare Doubledare</target></link></italics></listitem><listitem>1995:<space/><italics>Rainbow Nation</italics></listitem></list><heading level='2'>See also</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Jimmy Somerville discography</target></link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>Reflist</target></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>Refend</target></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>External links</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><template><target>discogs artist</target></template></listitem></list><paragraph><template><target>Jimmy Somerville</target></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>Authority control</target></template><link><target>Category:British dance music groups</target></link><link><target>Category:British electronic music groups</target></link><link><target>Category:British pop music groups</target></link><link><target>Category:British Hi-NRG groups</target></link><link><target>Category:LGBT-themed musical groups</target></link><link><target>Category:Musical groups established in 1983</target></link><link><target>Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1995</target></link><link><target>Category:English New Wave musical groups</target></link><link><target>Category:Synthpop New Wave musical groups</target></link><link><target>Category:Bronski Beat</target><part></part></link></paragraph></article>
