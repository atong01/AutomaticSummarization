Marshall Field was at first unimpressed by the impecunious Beatty as a future son-in-law, but was persuaded by his heroic reputation, impressive record of promotion and future prospects. There was the possibility that Field might revoke the settlement he had made on his daughter at the time of her first marriage and the new couple would have no means of support. Beatty's father was also unhappy about the match, fearing a repeat of the difficulties he had faced with his own relationship with a married woman, but with the added risk of publicity because both Beatty and Ethel were famous and the risk that Beatty's illegitimacy might be exposed. Beatty went so far as to consult a fortune teller, Mrs. Roberts, who predicted a fine outcome to the match. Ethel wrote to Arthur, telling him that it was her firm intention never to live with him again as his wife, though not naming any particular person or reason. Arthur agreed to cooperate, and filed for divorce in America on the grounds of desertion, which was granted 9 May 1901. Beatty and Ethel married on 22 May 1901 at the registry office, St. George's, Hanover Square,<space/><link><target>London</target></link><space/>with no family attending. Although Arthur Tree was himself from a wealthy American family, he now had to adjust to reduced circumstances without Ethel's support. He elected to remain in Britain and their son Ronald remained with him. Ronald and his mother were never reconciled from his perception that she had deserted his father, but he visited in later life and became friendly with Beatty. Ronald later became a member of parliament and, during<space/><link><target>World War II</target></link><space/>became a link between the British and United States governments, lending his country house,<space/><link><target>Ditchley</target><part>Ditchley Park</part></link><space/>near<space/><link><target>Oxford</target></link>, to<space/><link><target>Winston Churchill</target></link><space/>for weekend visits when the official residences were considered unsafe.

These included failing to engage the German battlecruiser squadron with all his ships, thus throwing away a two to one numerical superiority and instead fighting one-to-one. Beatty was given command of the<space/><link><target>5th Battle Squadron</target></link><space/>to replace a squadron of battlecruisers away for training. These were four of the most powerful ships in the world, but he positioned them so far away from his six battlecruisers that they were unable to take part in most of the engagement with<space/><link><target>Franz Hipper</target><part>Admiral Hipper's</part></link><space/>squadron of five battlecruisers.<extension extension_name='ref'>Brooks p. 232-234</extension><space/>Beatty did not take advantage of the time available to him between sighting the enemy and the start of fighting to position his battlecruisers to most effectively attack the enemy. At the point the German ships opened fire with accurately determined ranges for their<space/><link><target>naval artillery</target><part>guns</part></link>, Beatty's ships were still maneuvering, some could not see the enemy because of their own smoke, and hardly any had the opportunity of a period of steady course as they approached to<space/><link><target>gun laying</target><part>properly determine target range</part></link>. As a result, the German ships had a significant advantage in early hits, with obvious benefit. During this time he also lost the potential advantage of the larger guns on his ships: they could commence firing at a longer range than the German ships.<extension extension_name='ref'>Brooks p. 234-240</extension><space/>He did not ensure that signals sent to his ships were handled properly and received by the intended ships. Lost signals added to the confusion and lost opportunities during the battle. This issue had already arisen in previous battles, where the same signals officer had been involved, but no changes had been made.<extension extension_name='ref'>Brooks p. 232-233, 237</extension><space/>Although Beatty was supposed as a fast armoured scout and report to Jellicoe the exact position of the German ships he encountered, or to keep in contact with the German fleet while he retreated to the main British Grand Fleet, he failed to do so. This information was important to Jellicoe to know how best to position the main fleet to make the most of its eventual engagement with the German High Seas Fleet. Despite this, Jellicoe succeeded in positioning his ships to good advantage, relying on other closer<space/><link><target>cruiser</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>for final knowledge of the German's position, but necessitating last-minute decisions.<extension extension_name='ref'>Brooks p. 232-240</extension><space/>Additionally, the gunnery of Beatty's ships was generally poor compared to the rest of the fleet. This was partly a consequence of his ships being stationed at Rosyth, rather than Scapa Flow with the main fleet, since local facilities at Rosyth were limited, but this was a problem identified months before Jutland which Beatty had failed to correct.<extension extension_name='ref'>Brooks p.226-227</extension></paragraph><paragraph>After the war a report of the battle was prepared by the Admiralty under First Sea Lord<space/><link><target>Baron Wester Wemyss</target><part>Rosslyn Wemyss</part></link>.

When the authors refused to comply, he ordered it to be destroyed and instead had prepared an alternative report, which proved highly critical of Jellicoe. Considerable argument broke out as a result, with significant numbers of servicemen disputing the published version, including Admiral<space/><link><target>Reginald Bacon</target></link>, who wrote
