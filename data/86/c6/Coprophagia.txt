'''Coprophagia''' {{IPAc-en|k|ɒ|p|.|r|ə|.|ˈ|f|eɪ|.|dʒ|i|.|ə}}<ref>''Coprophagia.'' (2012). Dictionary.com September 2, 2012, from [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/coprophagia link]</ref> or '''coprophagy''' {{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|p|r|ɒ|f|ə|dʒ|iː}} is the consumption of [[feces]].  The word is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] κόπρος ''copros'', "feces" and φαγεῖν ''phagein'', "to eat". ''Coprophagy'' refers to many kinds of feces eating, including eating feces of other species (heterospecifics), of other individuals (allocoprophagy), or its own (autocoprophagy) – those once deposited or taken directly from the [[anus]].<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Hirakawa |first1=H | year=2001 | title=Coprophagy in leporids and other mammalian herbivores | journal=Mammal Review | volume=31 | issue=1 | pages=61–80|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bsc/mam/2001/00000031/00000001/art00005 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2907.2001.00079.x}}</ref>

In humans, coprophagia has been observed in individuals with mental illness. Some animal [[species]] eat feces as a normal behavior; other species may [[List of abnormal behaviours in animals|not normally]] consume feces but do so under very unusual conditions. 

==Humans==
Coprophagia has been observed in individuals with [[schizophrenia]]<ref>{{cite journal | author = Harada KI, Yamamoto K, Saito T.| title = Effective treatment of coprophagia in a patient with schizophrenia with the novel atypical antipsychotic drug perospirone | journal = Pharmacopsychiatry | year = 2006 | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | page = 113 | doi = 10.1055/s-2006-941487  | pmid = 16721701 }} </ref> and [[Pica (disorder)|pica]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Rose, E.A., Porcerelli, J.H., & Neale, A.V. | title = Pica: Common but commonly missed | journal = The Journal of the American Board of Family Practice | year = 2000 | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 353–358 | pmid = 11001006 }}</ref>

Consuming feces carries the risk of contracting diseases and bacteria spread such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', [[Hepatitis A]], [[Hepatitis E]], [[pneumonia]], [[polio]], and [[influenza]]. Coprophagia also carries a risk of contracting [[intestinal parasite]]s.{{mcn|date=February 2015}}

Coprophagous insects consume and [[digestion|redigest]] the feces of large animals. These feces contain substantial amounts of semi-digested [[food]] ([[herbivore]]s' [[Gastrointestinal tract|digestive systems]] are especially inefficient). Two feces-eating insects are the [[dung-beetle]] and the [[fly]].

[[Termite]]s eat one another's feces as a means of obtaining their [[hindgut]] [[protist]]s. Termites and protists have a [[symbiotic]] relationship (e.g. with the protozoan that allows the termites to digest the cellulose in their diet via the protists. For example, in one group of termites, there is a three-way symbiotic relationship - termites of the family Rhinotermitidae, cellulolytic protists of the genus ''Pseudotrichonympha'' in the guts of these termites, and intracellular bacterial symbionts of the protists.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Cospeciation in the triplex symbiosis of termite gut protists (Pseudotrichonympha spp.), their hosts, and their bacterial endosymbionts.|author=Noda, S., Kitade, O., Inoue, T., Kawai, M., Kanuka, M., Hiroshima, K., Hongoh, Y., Constantino, R., Uys, V., Zhong, J., Kudo, T. and Ohkuma, M.|journal=Molecular Ecology|volume=16|issue=6|year=2007|pages=1257-1266|url=http://www.unboundmedicine.com/medline/citation/17391411/Cospeciation_in_the_triplex_symbiosis_of_termite_gut_protists__Pseudotrichonympha_spp___their_hosts_and_their_bacterial_endosymbionts_}}</ref>

===Vertebrates===
Domesticated and wild mammals are known to consume feces. 
In the wild they either bury or eat waste to protect their trail from predators. Mothers of certain species are known to eat the feces of their newborn young during the earliest phase after birth, presumably to eliminate cues to potential predators and to keep the den clean.{{cn|date=January 2015}}

[[Rabbit]]s reingest their own droppings (rather than [[Ruminant|chewing the cud]] as do cows and many other herbivores) to digest their food and extract sufficient nutrients. Chewed plant material collects in a chamber between the large and small intestine containing large quantities of symbiotic bacteria that help with the digestion of cellulose and also produce certain B vitamins.  After being excreted, they are eaten whole by the rabbit and redigested in a special part of the stomach. The pellets remain intact for up to six hours in the stomach; the bacteria within continue to digest the plant carbohydrates. This double-digestion process enables rabbits to use nutrients that they may have missed during the first passage through the gut, as well as the nutrients formed by the microbial activity and thus ensures that maximum nutrition is derived from the food they eat.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica">{{cite encyclopedia | title = rabbit | encyclopedia = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] | location = Chicago | edition = Standard | year = 2007}}</ref> This process serves the same purpose within the rabbit as [[ruminant|rumination]] does in cattle and sheep.<ref>''The Private Life of the Rabbit'', R. M. Lockley, 1964. Chapter 10.</ref> <!-- This reference is for the whole section, as written 30 July 2007 -->

[[Cattle]] in the United States are often fed [[chicken litter]]. There are concerns that the practice of feeding chicken litter to cattle could lead to [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (mad-cow disease) because of the crushed [[meat and bone meal|bone meal]] in chicken feed. The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] regulates this practice by attempting to prevent the introduction of any part of a cow's brain or spinal cord into [[livestock]] feed.<ref>[http://www.thepoultrysite.com/poultrynews/18835/fda-urged-to-ban-feeding-chicken-litter-to-cattle FDA Urged to Ban Feeding Chicken Litter to Cattle], 2009-11-02, L.A. Times</ref> Other countries, like Canada, have banned chicken litter for use as a livestock feed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/feeds/regulatory-guidance/rg-2/eng/1328859106165/1328859287377|website=Canadian Food Inspection Agency|title=Feeding of Poultry Manure to Cattle Prohibited}}</ref>

The young of [[elephant]]s, [[Giant Panda|giant pandas]], [[koala]]s, and [[Hippopotamus|hippo]]s eat the feces of their mothers or other animals in the herd to obtain the [[bacteria]] required to properly digest [[vegetation]] found on their ecosystems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/adaptations/Coprophagia |title=BBC Nature&nbsp;— Dung eater videos, news and facts |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-11-27}}</ref> When they are born, their [[intestine]]s do not contain these bacteria, they are sterile. Without them, they would be unable to obtain any nutritional value from plants.

Hamsters, [[guinea pigs]], [[chinchillas]] and [[naked mole-rat]] eat their own droppings, which are thought to be a source of [[vitamin]]s [[B vitamins|B]] and [[Vitamin K|K]], produced by gut bacteria.{{cn|date=January 2015}} [[Gorilla]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s eat their own feces and the feces of other gorillas and chimpanzees. This may serve to improve absorption of vitamins or of nutritive elements made available from the re-ingestion of seeds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pages.nycep.org/rothman/6PWUnutr.pdf |title=Nutritional Aspects of the Diet of Wild Gorillas |accessdate=2013-06-29}}</ref> 

[[Pig]]s sometimes eat the feces of herbivores that leave a significant amount of semi-digested matter, including their own. In some cultures, it was common for poor families to collect horse feces to feed their pigs, which contributes to the risk of parasite infection.{{cn|date=January 2015}}

==Plants==
Some carnivorous plants, such as pitcher plants of the genus ''[[Nepenthes]]'', obtain nourishment from the feces of [[commensalism|commensal]] animals.{{cn|date=January 2015}}

==History==
Lewin reported that "...&nbsp;consumption of fresh, warm [[camel]] feces has been recommended by [[Bedouin]]s as a remedy for bacterial [[dysentery]]; its efficacy (probably attributable to the antibiotic [[subtilisin]] from ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'') was anecdotally confirmed by German soldiers in Africa during World War II".<ref>{{cite journal | author=Lewin, Ralph A.| title=More on merde| journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine| year=2001| volume=44| issue=4| pages=594–607| doi = 10.1353/pbm.2001.0067 | pmid = 11600805 }}</ref>

Centuries ago, physicians tasted their patients' feces, to better judge their state and condition.<ref>notes to ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=qsv_Y0DOVUsC The Works of Francis Rabelais, Volume II, Volume 2]'', p. 56</ref>

==Society and culture==
Coprophagia is depicted in [[pornography]], usually under the term ''scat'' (from ''[[scatology]]'').<ref name="Holmes">{{cite book |last= Holmes |first= Ronald M. |title= Sex Crimes: Patterns and Behavior |publisher= Sage Publications |location= Thousand Oaks |isbn= 0-7619-2417-5 |oclc= 47893709 |page=  244}}</ref>

''[[The 120 Days of Sodom]]'', a novel by the [[Marquis de Sade]] written in 1785, is replete with detailed descriptions of erotic sadomasochistic coprophagia.<ref>le Marquis de Sade (1785) Les 120 journées de Sodome, ou L'École du Libertinage</ref>  [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s award winning 1973 novel ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'' contains a detailed scene of coprophagia.<ref>Thomas Pynchon (1973) ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'', Part 2, episode 4.</ref> [[François Rabelais]], in his classic ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'', often employs the expression ''mâche-merde'' or ''mâchemerde'', meaning ''shit-chewer''. It is in turn a citation of the Greek comedians [[Aristophanes]] and particularly [[Menander]], who often use the term skatophagos (''σκατοϕάγος'').<ref>Rabelais, Book 1, ch. 40 and Book 3 chap. 25</ref> In one dialogue, Rabelais speaks of coprophagia as a [[Christian]] gesture, saying that monks ''swallow the shit of the world, that is the sins'', and for this they are ostracized by society.<ref>Rabelais, Book 1, ch. 40 quote: "ilz mangent la merde du monde, c'est à dire, les pechez"</ref>
