The '''endocrine system''' refers to the collection of [[gland]]s of an organism that [[secrete]] [[hormone]]s directly into the [[circulatory system]] to be carried towards distant target organs. The major [[endocrine gland]]s include the [[pineal gland]], [[pituitary gland]], [[pancreas]], [[Ovary|ovaries]], [[Testicle|testes]], [[thyroid|thyroid gland]], [[parathyroid gland]], [[hypothalamus]], [[gastrointestinal tract]] and [[adrenal gland]]s.  The endocrine system is in contrast to the [[exocrine system]], which secretes its hormones using [[Duct (anatomy)|ducts]]. The endocrine system is an information signal system like the nervous system, yet its effects and mechanism are classifiably different.  The endocrine system's effects are slow to initiate, and prolonged in their response, lasting from a few hours up to weeks.  The nervous system sends information very quickly, and responses are generally short lived.  In [[vertebrate]]s, the [[hypothalamus]] is the neural control center for all endocrine systems. The field of study dealing with the endocrine system and its disorders is [[endocrinology]], a branch of [[internal medicine]].<ref name=Marieb>{{cite book | last = Marieb | first = Elaine | title = Anatomy & physiology | publisher = Pearson Education, Inc | location = Glenview, IL | year = 2014 | isbn = 978-0321861580 }}</ref>
Special features of [[endocrine gland]]s are, in general, their ductless nature, their vascularity, and commonly the presence of intracellular vacuoles or granules that store their hormones. In contrast, [[exocrine gland]]s, such as [[salivary gland]]s, [[sweat gland]]s, and [[glands]] within the [[gastrointestinal tract]], tend to be much less vascular and have ducts or a hollow [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]].

In addition to the specialised endocrine organs mentioned above, many other organs that are part of other body systems, such as [[bone]], [[kidney]], [[liver]], [[heart]] and [[gonad]]s, have secondary endocrine functions. For example the kidney secretes endocrine hormones such as [[erythropoietin]] and [[renin]]. Hormones can consist of either amino acid complexes, steroids, eicosanoids, leukotienes, or prostiglandins.<ref name=Marieb/>

A number of glands that signal each other in sequence are usually referred to as an axis, for example, the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]].

As opposed to endocrine factors that travel considerably longer distances via the circulatory system, other signaling molecules, such as [[paracrine]] factors involved in [[paracrine signalling]] diffuse over a relatively short distance.

The word endocrine derives from the Greek words ἐνδο- ''endo-'' "inside, within," and κρίνειν ''krinein'' "to separate, distinguish".

=== Pituitary gland (hypophysis) ===
The [[pituitary gland]] (or hypophysis) is an endocrine gland about the size of a pea and weighing {{convert|0.5|g|oz}} in humans. It is a protrusion off the bottom of the [[hypothalamus]] at the base of the [[brain]], and rests in a small, bony cavity ([[sella turcica]]) covered by a [[Dura mater|dural]] fold  ([[diaphragma sellae]]). The pituitary is functionally connected to the [[hypothalamus]] by the [[median eminence]] via a small tube called the infundibular stem or [[pituitary stalk]]. The pituitary fossa, in which the pituitary gland sits, is situated in the [[sphenoid bone]] in the [[middle cranial fossa]] at the base of the brain. The pituitary gland secretes nine [[hormone]]s that regulate [[homeostasis]] and the secretion of other hormones.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

== Diffuse neuro-endocrine system (DNES) ==
The Diffuse neuro-endocrine system (DNES) comprises hormone-secreted cells, that have commonalities with neurons and are found in the [[Epithelium]] of organs of the body.

==Major endocrine systems==
The human endocrine system consists of several systems that operate via [[feedback loop]]s. Several important feedback systems are mediated via the hypothalamus and pituitary.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Human Physiology: From Cells to Systems|author=Sherwood, L.|publisher=Wadsworth Pub Co|year=1997|isbn=0495391840}}</ref>

   }}</ref> including conditions such as [[diabetes mellitus]], [[thyroid]] disease, and [[obesity]].
Endocrine disease is characterized by disregulated hormone release (a productive [[pituitary adenoma]]), inappropriate response to signaling  ([[hypothyroidism]]), lack of a gland ([[diabetes mellitus type 1]], diminished [[erythropoiesis]] in [[chronic renal failure]]), or structural enlargement in a critical site such as the thyroid ([[toxic multinodular goitre]]). Hypofunction of endocrine glands can occur as a result of loss of reserve, hyposecretion, [[agenesis]], atrophy, or active destruction. Hyperfunction can occur as a result of hypersecretion, loss of suppression, [[hyperplasia|hyperplastic]] or [[neoplastic]] change, or hyperstimulation.

Endocrinopathies are classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary. Primary endocrine disease inhibits the action of downstream glands. Secondary endocrine disease is indicative of a problem with the pituitary gland. Tertiary endocrine disease is associated with dysfunction of the hypothalamus and its releasing hormones.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

As the [[Thyroid cancer|thyroid]], and hormones have been implicated in signaling distant tissues to proliferate, for example, the [[estrogen receptor]] has been shown to be involved in certain [[breast cancer]]s. Endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine signaling have all been implicated in proliferation, one of the required steps of [[oncogenesis]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bhowmick NA, Chytil A, Plieth D, Gorska AE, Dumont N, Shappell S, Washington MK, Neilson EG, Moses HL |title=TGF-beta signaling in fibroblasts modulates the oncogenic potential of adjacent epithelia |journal=Science |volume=303 |issue=5659 |pages=848–51 |year=2004 |pmid=14764882 |doi=10.1126/science.1090922 }}</ref>

==Other types of signaling==
The typical mode of [[cell signaling]] in the endocrine system is endocrine signaling. However, there are also other modes, i.e., paracrine, autocrine, and [[neuroendocrine]] signaling. Purely neurocrine signaling between [[neurons]], on the other hand, belongs completely to the [[nervous system]].

===Autocrine===
{{Main|Autocrine signalling}}
Autocrine signaling is a form of signaling in which a cell secretes a hormone or chemical messenger (called the autocrine agent) that binds to autocrine receptors on the same cell, leading to changes in the cells.

===Paracrine===
{{Main|Paracrine signaling}}
Some endocrinologists and clinicians include the paracrine system as part of the endocrine system, but there is not consensus. Paracrines are slower acting, targeting cells in the same tissue or organ. An example of this is [[somatostatin]] which is released by some pancreatic cells and target other pancreatic cells.<ref name=Marieb/>

===Juxtacrine===
{{Main|Juxtacrine signalling}}
Juxtacrine signaling is a type of intercellular communication that is transmitted via oligosaccharide, lipid, or protein components of a cell membrane, and may affect either the emitting cell or the immediately adjacent cells.

It occurs between adjacent cells that possess broad patches of closely opposed plasma membrane linked by transmembrane channels known as connexons. The gap between the cells can usually be between only 2 and 4&nbsp;nm.

Unlike other types of cell signaling (such as paracrine and endocrine), juxtacrine signaling requires physical contact between the two cells involved.

Juxtacrine signaling has been observed for some growth factors, cytokine and chemokine cellular signals.
