In<space/><link><target>Glossary of Australian rules football</target><part>Australian rules terminology</part></link>, these players wait for substitution &quot;on the bench&quot;an area with a row of seats on the sideline. Players must interchange through a designated interchange &quot;gate&quot; with strict penalties for too many players from one team on the field. In addition, some leagues like the AFL have each team designate one player as a substitute who can be used to make a single permanent exchange of players during a game.</paragraph><paragraph>There is no<space/><link><target>offside (sport)</target><part>offside rule</part></link><space/>nor are there set positions in the rules; unlike many other forms of football, players from both teams may disperse across the whole field before the start of play.

Only four players from each team are allowed within the centre square (<template><target>convert</target><arg>50</arg><arg>m</arg><arg>yd</arg></template>) at every centre bounce, which occurs at the commencement of each quarter, and to restart the game after a goal is scored. There are also other rules pertaining to allowed player positions during set plays (that is, after a mark or free kick) and during kick-ins following the scoring of a behind.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Match duration</heading><paragraph>A game consists of four quarters and a timekeeper officiates their duration. At professional level quarters consist of 20 minutes of play, with the clock being stopped for instances such as scores, the ball going out of play or at the umpire's discretion. The umpire signals<space/><italics>time-off</italics><space/>to stop the clock for various reasons, such as the player in possession being tackled to the ground and leading to stagnant play as neither side can recover the ball. Time resumes when the umpire signals<space/><italics>time-on</italics><space/>or when the ball is brought into play. Such stoppages generally lead to quarters being extended by between five and ten minutes. The official game clock is only known on the field by the timekeepers. Official game time is not displayed to the players or the public; the only knowledge they have of time is when sirens sound to mark the beginning and end of each quarter. Official time may be approximated by broadcasters to display to television audiences. Teams change ends at the end of each quarter; umpires change ends at half time.</paragraph><heading level='3'>General play</heading><paragraph><template><target>unreferenced section</target><arg name="date">May 2012</arg></template><link><target>File:John Coleman mark 1950.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>upright</part><part><link><target>Mark (Australian football)</target><part>Marking</part></link><space/>the ball is one of Australian football's distinctive features.

Before the game, the winner of a<space/><link><target>coin toss</target></link><space/>determines which directions the teams will play to begin. Australian football begins after the first<space/><link><target>siren (noisemaker)</target><part>siren</part></link>, when the umpire<space/><link><target>Ball-up</target><part>bounces the ball on the ground</part></link><space/>(or throws it into the air if the condition of the ground is poor), and the two<space/><link><target>Ruckman (Australian rules football position)</target><part>ruckmen</part></link><space/>(typically the tallest players from each team) battle for the ball in the air on its way back down. This is known as the<space/><italics>ball-up</italics>. Certain disputes during play may also be settled with a<space/><italics>ball-up</italics><space/>from the point of contention. If the ball ever goes<space/><link><target>Out of bounds#Australian rules football</target><part>out of bounds</part></link><space/>(beyond the oval boundary line around the edge of the field), a boundary umpire will stand with his back to the infield and return the ball into play with a<space/><italics>throw-in</italics>, a high backwards toss back into the field of play.</paragraph><paragraph>The ball can be propelled in any direction by way of a foot, clenched fist (called a<space/><link><target>handball (Australian rules football)</target><part>handball</part></link><space/>or<space/><italics>handpass</italics>) or open-hand tap but it cannot be thrown under any circumstances. Once a player takes possession of the ball he must dispose of it by either kicking or handballing it. Any other method of disposal is illegal and will result in a<space/><link><target>Free kick (Australian rules football)</target><part>free kick</part></link><space/>to the opposing team. This is usually called &quot;incorrect disposal&quot;, &quot;dropping the ball&quot; or &quot;throwing&quot;. If the ball is not in the possession of one player it can be moved on with any part of the body.</paragraph><paragraph>A player may run with the ball, but it must be<space/><link><target>Running bounce</target><part>bounced or touched on the ground</part></link><space/>at least once every 15&amp;nbsp;metres.

The ball carrier may only be tackled between the shoulders and knees. If the opposition player forcefully contacts a player in the back while performing a tackle, the opposition player will be penalised for a<space/><link><target>push in the back</target></link>. If the opposition tackles the player with possession below the knees (a<space/><italics>low tackle</italics><space/>or a<space/><italics>trip</italics>) or above the shoulders (a<space/><italics>high tackle</italics>), the team with possession of the football gets a free kick.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Aussie rules kicking.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>upright</part><part>Precise field and goal kicking is the most important skill in Australian football.</part></link>If a player takes possession of the ball that has travelled more than<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>15</arg><arg>m</arg><arg>yd</arg></template><space/>from another player's kick, by way of a catch, it is claimed as a<space/><italics><link><target>mark (Australian football)</target><part>mark</part></link></italics><space/>(meaning that the game stops while he prepares to kick from the point at which he marked). Alternatively, he may choose to &quot;play on&quot; forfeiting the set shot in the hope of pressing an advantage for his team (rather than allowing the opposition to reposition while he prepares for the free kick). Once a player has chosen to play on, normal play resumes and the player who took the mark is again able to be tackled.</paragraph><paragraph>There are different<space/><link><target>kick (football)</target><part>styles of kicking</part></link><space/>depending on how the ball is held in the hand. The most common style of kicking seen in today's game, principally because of its superior accuracy, is the<space/><link><target>drop punt</target></link>, where the ball is dropped from the hands down, almost to the ground, to be kicked so that the ball rotates in a reverse end over end motion as it travels through the air. Other commonly used kicks are the<space/><link><target>torpedo punt</target></link><space/>(also known as the spiral, barrel, or screw punt), where the ball is held flatter at an angle across the body, which makes the ball spin around its long axis in the air, resulting in extra distance (similar to the traditional motion of an<space/><link><target>Punt (gridiron football)</target><part>American football punt</part></link>), and the<space/><link><target>checkside punt</target></link><space/>or &quot;banana&quot;, kicked across the ball with the outside of the foot used to curve the ball (towards the right if kicked off the right foot) towards targets that are on an angle. There is also the &quot;snap&quot;, which is almost the same as a checkside punt except that it is kicked off the inside of the foot and curves in the opposite direction. It is also possible to kick the ball so that it bounces along the ground. This is known as a &quot;grubber&quot;. Grubbers can bounce in a straight line, or curve to the left or right.</paragraph><paragraph>Apart from free kicks, marks or when the ball is in the possession of an umpire for a<space/><italics>ball up</italics><space/>or<space/><italics>throw in</italics>, the ball is always in dispute and any player from either side can take possession of the ball.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Scoring</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Sherrin footy.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part><link><target>Sherrin</target></link><space/>is the official game ball of the Australian Football League.</part></link><link><target>File:AFL-Goalposts.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>The two tall central posts are the goal posts, and the two shorter outer posts are the behind posts</part></link>A<space/><italics>goal</italics>, worth 6 points, is scored when the football is propelled through the goal posts at any height (including above the height of the posts) by way of a kick from the attacking team. It may fly through &quot;on the full&quot; (without touching the ground) or bounce through, but must not have been touched, on the way, by any player from either team. A goal cannot be scored from the foot of an opposition (defending) player.</paragraph><paragraph>A<space/><italics>behind</italics>, worth 1 point, is scored when the ball passes between a goal post and a behind post at any height, or if the ball hits a goal post, or if any player sends the ball between the goal posts by touching it with any part of the body other than a foot. A behind is also awarded to the attacking team if the ball touches any part of an opposition player, including his foot, before passing between the goal posts. When an opposition player deliberately scores a behind for the attacking team (generally as a last resort, because of the risk of their scoring a goal) this is termed a<space/><link><target>rushed behind</target></link>.

While many one-off matches are recorded to have taken place between several early teams from Melbourne's suburbs and country Victoria (such as the<space/><link><target>Ballarat</target></link><space/>and Geelong competitions), in the early days many had not yet formed clubs for regular competition.</paragraph><paragraph>The first trophy for Australian Rules Football, the 1861<space/><link><target>Challenge Cup (Australia)</target><part>Challenge Cup</part></link>, was won in 1862 under Melbourne's rules by University over Melbourne.

Two further competitions, the South Yarra Challenge Cup (which had evolved from the Caledonian Games) and &quot;Second Twenties&quot; were held in the 1860s and 1870s.</paragraph><paragraph>Some rival rules eventually gave way to an acceptance of the Melbourne rules. In 1860, the Melbourne Football Club redrafted its rules following the input of several other clubs. The requirement to bounce the ball while running was introduced in a significant redraft of the Melbourne rules in 1866 by H. C. A.

The new rules became known as the Victorian rules, which became more widely adopted. In 1869, a 100-minute time limit was introduced to the game for the first time. Previous to this, winners were decided in a number of ways, but most commonly the first side to kick two goals.</paragraph><paragraph>The relationship with cricket primarily came out of co-existence and many of football's founders were cricketers. As a result, the sport shares some terminology (i.e. &quot;umpires&quot; and &quot;boundary&quot;).

The first football match played at the<space/><link><target>Melbourne Cricket Ground</target></link><space/>(MCG) was not until 1876.

Each club was required to pay a licence fee which allowed the Victorian-based clubs to survive.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Port Adelaide heads for the AFL.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>upright</part><part>Founded in 1870,<space/><template><target>AFL Por</target></template><space/>was the only pre-existing club outside Victoria to gain entry into the AFL.</part></link>The league changed its name to the<space/><link><target>Australian Football League</target></link><space/>(AFL) following the 1989 season. In 1991, it gained its first South Australian team, the<space/><link><target>Adelaide Crows</target></link>, which paid five million dollars to enter the AFL.

The AFL, currently with 18 member clubs, is the sport's elite competition and the most powerful body and continues to seek further opportunities to expand into new markets.</paragraph><paragraph>Following the emergence of the Australian Football League, the SANFL, WAFL and other state leagues rapidly declined to a secondary status. Apart from these there are many semi-professional and amateur leagues around Australia, where they play a very important role in the community, and particularly so in rural areas. The VFA, still in existence a century after the original schism, merged with the former VFL reserves competition in 1998. The new entity adopted the VFL name and remained a primarily state-based competition.</paragraph><paragraph>State of origin games also declined in importance, especially after an increasing number of withdrawals by AFL players. The AFL turned its focus for representation to an annual<space/><link><target>International Rules Series</target></link><space/>against<space/><link><target>Ireland</target></link><space/>in 1998 before abolishing State of Origin in 1999. The second-tier state and territorial leagues still contest interstate representative matches.</paragraph><paragraph>Although a<space/><link><target>Tasmanian AFL Bid</target></link><space/>has been ongoing, the AFL's recent focus has been gaining market share in lucrative broadcasting rights in two populous Australian states, helped by introducing clubs on the<space/><link><target>Gold Coast, Queensland</target><part>Gold Coast</part></link><space/>and in<space/><link><target>Greater Western Sydney</target></link>.
