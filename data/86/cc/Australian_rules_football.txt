<!-- This is NOT a place to put the complete rules of the game&nbsp;... just a brief summary about what makes the game different/notable for someone who knows nothing of the sport. Rules can be fleshed out in subsequent sections -->
The main way to score points is by kicking the [[Football (ball)#Australian rules football|ball]] between the two tall goal posts. The team with the higher total score at the end of the match wins<ref>[http://afl.com.au/Portals/0/2012/AM_6967_0112_AFL_laws.pdf 2012 Laws of the game] (p. 6)</ref> unless a [[Tie (draw)|draw]] is declared.<ref>In some special situations such as [[Grand Final]]s or other [[Single-elimination tournament|knockout tournaments]], if the score is tied, either [[extra time]] or a [[Grand Final Replay|rematch]] the following week is required to get a result.</ref>

During general play, players may position themselves anywhere on the field and use any part of their bodies to move the ball. The primary methods are [[kick (football)|kicking]], [[handball (Australian rules football)|handballing]] and running with the ball. There are rules on how the ball can be handled: for example, players running with the ball must intermittently [[running bounce|bounce or touch it on the ground]]. Throwing the ball is not allowed and players must not get caught [[holding the ball]]. Possession of the ball is in dispute at all times except when a ''[[Free kick (Australian rules football)|free kick]]'' or mark is paid. A distinctive feature of the game is the [[Mark (Australian football)|mark]], where players anywhere on the field who catch a ball from a kick (with specific conditions) are awarded possession.<ref>[http://afl.com.au/Portals/0/2012/AM_6967_0112_AFL_laws.pdf 2012 Laws of the game] Section 14, page 45</ref>

Australian football is a contact sport in which players can [[tackle (football move)|tackle]] using their hands or use their whole body to [[Shepherding (Australian rules football)|obstruct]] opponents. Dangerous physical contact (such as [[push in the back|pushing an opponent in the back]]), interference when marking and deliberately slowing the play are discouraged with free kicks, [[50-metre penalty|distance penalties]] or [[suspension (punishment)|suspension]] for a certain number of matches, depending on the seriousness of the infringement. Frequent physical contests, [[spectacular mark]]ing, fast movement of both players and the ball and high scoring are the game's main attributes.

The [[Origins of Australian football|game's origins]] can be traced to football matches played in [[Melbourne]] in 1858. Australian football became codified in May 1859 when the first [[laws of Australian football|laws]] were published by the [[Melbourne Football Club]].<ref>[http://afl.com.au/Development/AFLExplained/History/tabid/10296/Default.aspx History] Official Website of the Australian Football League</ref><ref>{{cite book | author=[[Wendy Lewis]], Simon Balderstone and John Bowan | title=Events That Shaped Australia | page=61 | publisher=New Holland | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-74110-492-9 }}</ref>

The most prestigious competition is the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL), culminating in the annual [[AFL Grand Final]], currently the [[List of sports attendance figures#Top Leagues in recent domestic club championship event attendance|highest attended club championship event in the world]]. The [[Laws of Australian football|rules]] of Australian football are governed by the [[AFL Commission]] with the advice of the AFL's Laws of the Game Committee.

== Laws of the game ==
{{Main|Laws of Australian rules football}}
{{For|terminology|Glossary of Australian rules football}}
{{See also|Australian rules football playing field|Australian rules football tactics and skills}}

=== Field ===
[[File:AFL stadium.svg|thumb|Typical [[Australian rules football playing field]].]]

Both the ball and the field of play are [[oval]] in shape. No more than 18 players of each team are permitted to be on the field at any time.

Up to three [[Interchange (Australian rules football)|interchange]] (reserve) players may be swapped for those on the field at any time during the game. In [[Glossary of Australian rules football|Australian rules terminology]], these players wait for substitution "on the bench"—an area with a row of seats on the sideline. Players must interchange through a designated interchange "gate" with strict penalties for too many players from one team on the field. In addition, some leagues like the AFL have each team designate one player as a substitute who can be used to make a single permanent exchange of players during a game.

There is no [[offside (sport)|offside rule]] nor are there set positions in the rules; unlike many other forms of football, players from both teams may disperse across the whole field before the start of play. However, a typical on-field structure consists of six [[Australian rules football positions#Full forward|forwards]], six [[Fullback (Australian rules football)|defenders]] or "backmen" and six [[Midfielder (Australian Rules)|midfielders]], usually two [[Centre line (football)|wingmen]], one [[Centre line (football)|centre]] and three [[Follower (Australian rules football)|followers]], including a [[Ruckman (Australian rules football position)|ruckman]], [[Follower (Australian rules football)|ruck-rover]] and [[Follower (Australian rules football)|rover]]. Only four players from each team are allowed within the centre square ({{convert|50|m|yd}}) at every centre bounce, which occurs at the commencement of each quarter, and to restart the game after a goal is scored. There are also other rules pertaining to allowed player positions during set plays (that is, after a mark or free kick) and during kick-ins following the scoring of a behind.

===Match duration===

A game consists of four quarters and a timekeeper officiates their duration. At professional level quarters consist of 20 minutes of play, with the clock being stopped for instances such as scores, the ball going out of play or at the umpire's discretion. The umpire signals ''time-off'' to stop the clock for various reasons, such as the player in possession being tackled to the ground and leading to stagnant play as neither side can recover the ball. Time resumes when the umpire signals ''time-on'' or when the ball is brought into play. Such stoppages generally lead to quarters being extended by between five and ten minutes. The official game clock is only known on the field by the timekeepers. Official game time is not displayed to the players or the public; the only knowledge they have of time is when sirens sound to mark the beginning and end of each quarter. Official time may be approximated by broadcasters to display to television audiences. Teams change ends at the end of each quarter; umpires change ends at half time.

===General play===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
[[File:John Coleman mark 1950.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mark (Australian football)|Marking]] the ball is one of Australian football's distinctive features. (Pictured: Essendon great [[John Coleman (Australian footballer)|John Coleman]] takes a [[spectacular mark]] in 1950.)]]
Games are officiated by [[umpire (Australian rules football)|umpires]]. Before the game, the winner of a [[coin toss]] determines which directions the teams will play to begin. Australian football begins after the first [[siren (noisemaker)|siren]], when the umpire [[Ball-up|bounces the ball on the ground]] (or throws it into the air if the condition of the ground is poor), and the two [[Ruckman (Australian rules football position)|ruckmen]] (typically the tallest players from each team) battle for the ball in the air on its way back down. This is known as the ''ball-up''. Certain disputes during play may also be settled with a ''ball-up'' from the point of contention. If the ball ever goes [[Out of bounds#Australian rules football|out of bounds]] (beyond the oval boundary line around the edge of the field), a boundary umpire will stand with his back to the infield and return the ball into play with a ''throw-in'', a high backwards toss back into the field of play.

The ball can be propelled in any direction by way of a foot, clenched fist (called a [[handball (Australian rules football)|handball]] or ''handpass'') or open-hand tap but it cannot be thrown under any circumstances. Once a player takes possession of the ball he must dispose of it by either kicking or handballing it. Any other method of disposal is illegal and will result in a [[Free kick (Australian rules football)|free kick]] to the opposing team. This is usually called "incorrect disposal", "dropping the ball" or "throwing". If the ball is not in the possession of one player it can be moved on with any part of the body.

A player may run with the ball, but it must be [[Running bounce|bounced or touched on the ground]] at least once every 15&nbsp;metres. Opposition players may [[Shepherding (Australian rules football)|bump]] or [[tackle (football move)|tackle]] the player to obtain the ball and, when tackled, the player must dispose of the ball cleanly or risk being penalised for [[holding the ball]]. The ball carrier may only be tackled between the shoulders and knees. If the opposition player forcefully contacts a player in the back while performing a tackle, the opposition player will be penalised for a [[push in the back]]. If the opposition tackles the player with possession below the knees (a ''low tackle'' or a ''trip'') or above the shoulders (a ''high tackle''), the team with possession of the football gets a free kick.

[[File:Aussie rules kicking.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Precise field and goal kicking is the most important skill in Australian football.]]
If a player takes possession of the ball that has travelled more than {{convert|15|m|yd}} from another player's kick, by way of a catch, it is claimed as a ''[[mark (Australian football)|mark]]'' (meaning that the game stops while he prepares to kick from the point at which he marked). Alternatively, he may choose to "play on" forfeiting the set shot in the hope of pressing an advantage for his team (rather than allowing the opposition to reposition while he prepares for the free kick). Once a player has chosen to play on, normal play resumes and the player who took the mark is again able to be tackled.

There are different [[kick (football)|styles of kicking]] depending on how the ball is held in the hand. The most common style of kicking seen in today's game, principally because of its superior accuracy, is the [[drop punt]], where the ball is dropped from the hands down, almost to the ground, to be kicked so that the ball rotates in a reverse end over end motion as it travels through the air. Other commonly used kicks are the [[torpedo punt]] (also known as the spiral, barrel, or screw punt), where the ball is held flatter at an angle across the body, which makes the ball spin around its long axis in the air, resulting in extra distance (similar to the traditional motion of an [[Punt (gridiron football)|American football punt]]), and the [[checkside punt]] or "banana", kicked across the ball with the outside of the foot used to curve the ball (towards the right if kicked off the right foot) towards targets that are on an angle. There is also the "snap", which is almost the same as a checkside punt except that it is kicked off the inside of the foot and curves in the opposite direction. It is also possible to kick the ball so that it bounces along the ground. This is known as a "grubber". Grubbers can bounce in a straight line, or curve to the left or right.

Apart from free kicks, marks or when the ball is in the possession of an umpire for a ''ball up'' or ''throw in'', the ball is always in dispute and any player from either side can take possession of the ball.

===Scoring===
[[File:Sherrin footy.jpg|thumb|[[Sherrin]] is the official game ball of the Australian Football League.]]
[[File:AFL-Goalposts.jpg|thumb|The two tall central posts are the goal posts, and the two shorter outer posts are the behind posts]]
A ''goal'', worth 6 points, is scored when the football is propelled through the goal posts at any height (including above the height of the posts) by way of a kick from the attacking team. It may fly through "on the full" (without touching the ground) or bounce through, but must not have been touched, on the way, by any player from either team. A goal cannot be scored from the foot of an opposition (defending) player.

A ''behind'', worth 1 point, is scored when the ball passes between a goal post and a behind post at any height, or if the ball hits a goal post, or if any player sends the ball between the goal posts by touching it with any part of the body other than a foot. A behind is also awarded to the attacking team if the ball touches any part of an opposition player, including his foot, before passing between the goal posts. When an opposition player deliberately scores a behind for the attacking team (generally as a last resort, because of the risk of their scoring a goal) this is termed a [[rushed behind]]. Before the start of the 2009 season, there was no additional penalty imposed for rushing a behind, compared to any other behind. However, for the start of the 2009 season<ref>[http://www.foxsports.com.au/breaking-news/afl-rules-on-deliberate-rushed-behinds/story-e6frf33c-1111118325150 AFL rules on deliberate rushed behinds]</ref> a new rule was announced<ref>[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/all-clear-for-rushed-behind-rule/story-e6frf9jf-1225700531493 All clear for rushed behind rule | Herald Sun<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> awarding a free kick against any player who deliberately rushes a behind.

The [[Umpire (Australian rules football)|goal umpire]] signals a goal with two hands pointed forward at elbow height, or a behind with one hand. The umpire then confirms the signal with the other goal umpire by waving flags above their heads.

The team that has scored the most points at the end of play wins the game. If the scores are level on points at the end of play, then the game is a draw; extra time applies only during finals matches in some competitions.

As an example of a score report, consider a match between {{AFL Col}} and {{AFL Stk}}. Collingwood's score of 16 goals and 12 behinds equates to 108 points. St Kilda's score of 7 goals and 10 behinds equates to a 52-point tally. Collingwood wins the match by a margin of 56 points. Such a result would be written as:

:"'''{{AFL Col}} 16.12 (108)''' defeated {{AFL StK}} 7.10 (52)."

And said:

:"Collingwood, sixteen-twelve, one hundred and eight, defeated St Kilda seven-ten, fifty-two".

Additionally, it can be said that:

:"Collingwood defeated St Kilda by fifty-six points".

The home team is typically listed first and the visiting side is listed second. The scoreline is written with respect to the home side.

For example, {{AFL Por}} won in successive weeks, once as the home side and once as the visiting side. These would be written out thus:

:"'''{{AFL Por}} 23.20 (158)''' defeated {{AFL Ess}} 8.14 (62)."<ref>http://www.footywire.com/afl/footy/ft_match_statistics?mid=1845</ref>
:
:"{{AFL WCE}} 17.13 (115) defeated by '''{{AFL Por}} 18.10 (118)'''."<ref>http://www.footywire.com/afl/footy/ft_match_statistics?mid=1851</ref>

The ''football season'' proper is from March to August (early autumn to late winter in Australia) with finals being held in September and October.<ref>[http://mm.afl.com.au/afl_archive/cp2/c2/webi/article/304261bn.pdf] {{wayback|df=yes|url=http://mm.afl.com.au/afl_archive/cp2/c2/webi/article/304261bn.pdf |date=20110930213606 }}</ref> In the [[tropics]], the game is sometimes played in the [[wet season]] (October to March).<ref>[http://www.worldfootynews.com/article.php/20061130160918957 Bombers soaring on the Tiwi Islands]</ref> Pre-season competitions in [[southern Australia]] usually begin in late February.

The AFL is recognised by the [[Australian Sports Commission]] as being the National Sporting Organisation for Australian Football.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ais.org.au/austrules/index.asp |title=Australian Institute of Sport – Australian football |publisher=Ais.org.au |date= |accessdate=19 February 2010}}</ref> There are also seven state/territory-based organisations in Australia, most of which are now either owned by or affiliated to the AFL.

Most of these hold annual semi-professional club competitions while the others oversee more than one league. Local semi-professional or amateur organisations and competitions are often affiliated to their state organisations.

The AFL is the ''[[de facto]]'' world governing body for Australian football. There are also a number of affiliated organisations governing [[List of Australian rules football leagues outside Australia|amateur clubs and competitions around the world]].<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/Development/International/tabid/10238/Default.aspx |title=International – Official Website of the Australian Football League |publisher=Afl.com.au |date= |accessdate=19 February 2010}}</ref>

For almost all Australian football club competitions the aim is to win the ''Premiership''. The premiership is always decided by a ''finals series''. The teams that occupy the highest positions on the ''ladder'' after the ''home-and-away'' season play off in a "semi-knockout" finals series, culminating in a single [[Grand Final]] match to determine the premiers. Typically between four and eight teams contest the finals series. The team which finishes first on the ladder after the home-and-away season is referred to as a "[[minor premier]]", but this usually holds little stand-alone significance, other than receiving a better draw in the finals.

Many suburban and amateur leagues have a sufficient number of teams to be played across several tiered divisions, with [[promotion and relegation|promotion]] of the lower division premiers and [[promotion and relegation|relegation]] of the upper division's last placed team at the end of each year. At present, none of the top level national or state level leagues in Australia are large enough to warrant this structure.

==History==

===Origins===
{{main|Origins of Australian rules football}}
[[File:Tom wills statue.jpg|thumb|200px|Statue next to the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] on the approximate site of the 1858 "foot-ball" match between [[Melbourne Grammar]] and [[Scotch College, Melbourne|Scotch College]]. [[Tom Wills]] is depicted umpiring behind two young players contesting the ball. The plaque reads that Wills "did more than any other person – as a footballer and umpire, co-writer of the rules and promoter of the game – to develop Australian football during its first decade."<ref>[http://monumentaustralia.org.au/themes/culture/sport/display/32315-first-australian-rules-game First Australian Rules Game], Monument Australia. Retrieved 18 June 2013.</ref>]]
As early as 1841, there is documented evidence of "foot-ball" being played in metropolitan and country [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] as well as mention of early matches in [[Adelaide]] (1843) and southern [[Van Diemen's Land]] (Tasmania). While the exact rules being played in these matches are unknown they may have shared similarities and influences.

In the late 1850s Melbourne's schools are first recorded organising football games modeled on [[English public school football games|precedents at English schools]].<ref>Pennings, Mark (2012). ''Origins of Australian Football: Victoria's Early History: Volume 1: Amateur Heroes and the Rise of Clubs, 1858 to 1876.'' Connor Court Publishing Pty Ltd.

Published 2003. Hardie Grant Books. South Yarra. ISBN 1-74066-049-8. pg. 182</ref>

On 10 July 1858, the Melbourne-based ''[[Bell's Life in Victoria and Sporting Chronicle]]'' published a letter by prominent Victorian cricketer [[Tom Wills]], calling for the formation of a "foot-ball club" with a "code of laws" to keep [[cricketer]]s fit during winter.<ref>{{cite web| title=Letter from Tom Wills | work=MCG website | url=http://www.mcg.org.au/default.asp?pg=footballdisplay&articleid=37|accessdate=14 July 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060625081726/http://www.mcg.org.au/default.asp?pg=footballdisplay&articleid=37 |archivedate = 25 June 2006}}</ref> This letter is regarded by many historians as giving impetus for the development of a new code of football today known as Australian football.

On 31 July, a [[scratch match]] was held at the [[Richmond Paddock]] adjoining the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]. Trees were used for goal posts and there were no boundaries and the match lasted from 1 p.m. until dark. There were no rules and fights frequently broke out. Melbourne being a relatively young city, the majority of the early players were migrants and the media of the time noted that participants of each nationality played the game their own distinctive way: some were "guided by their particular set of rules, others by no rules at all".

Another significant milestone in the sport's development was a match between [[Melbourne Grammar School]] and [[Scotch College, Melbourne|Scotch College]], which began on 7 August 1858 at Richmond Paddock, was umpired by Wills and [[John Macadam]],<ref>The Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848–1954) Monday 9 August 1858</ref> and which also involved Scotch College headmaster [[Thomas H. Smith]].<ref>pg 36. Melbourne FC Since 1858 – An Illustrated History</ref> A second day of play took place on 21 August<ref>The Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848–1954) Tuesday 17 August 1858</ref> and a third, and final, day on 4 September.<ref name="piesse">{{Cite book| author=[[Ken Piesse]]| title=The Complete Guide to Australian Football | publisher=Pan Macmillan Australia | year=1995 | isbn=0-330-35712-3 }} p303.</ref> While the full rules that were used is unknown, some details of the match survived. It was played with a round ball, the distance between the goals was approximately half a mile (approximately four times longer than the modern [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] playing surface), there were 40 players per side and one goal each side was scored with the game being declared a draw. The two schools have competed annually ever since in the [[Cordner-Eggleston Cup]], the world's [[oldest football competitions|oldest continuous football competition]].<ref>{{cite news |date=4 June 2012 |title=The oldest of school rivals |work=The Weekly Review Stonnington |url=http://www.theweeklyreviewstonnington.com.au/story/286185/the-oldest-of-school-rivals/ |accessdate=19 June 2013 |first=Daniel |last=Paproth}}</ref>

The theory that Australian football was derived from [[Gaelic football]] became popular in the mid-20th century, despite the fact that Australian football was codified almost 30 years before the Irish game.<ref>{{cite book |last=Collins |first=Tony |editor-first=Stephen |editor-last=Wagg |title=Myths and Milestones in the History of Sport |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2011 |page=14 |chapter=Chapter 1: National Myths, Imperial Pasts and the Origins of Australian Rules Football |isbn=0-230-24125-5}}</ref> There is no archival evidence in favour of a Gaelic origin, and the style of play shared between the two modern codes was evident in Australia long before the Irish game evolved in a similar direction.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Blainey|first=Geoffrey|title=A Game of Our Own: The Origins of Australian Football|publisher=Black Inc.|year=2010|pages=187–196|isbn=1-86395-347-7}}</ref> Since the 1980s, the theory that Australian football comes from the Aboriginal game of [[Marn Grook]] has also gained attention.<ref>{{cite news |date=22 May 2011 |title=Searching for marngrook |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |url=http://www.smh.com.au/afl/afl-news/searching-for-marngrook-20110521-1exzv.html |accessdate=18 June 2013 |first=Martin |last=Flanagan}}</ref> It is claimed that Tom Wills, growing up amongst Aborigines in Victoria, may have seen or played Marn Grook, and used elements from the game when formulating the laws of Australian football.

===First rules===
{{See also|History of Australian rules football in Victoria (1859–1900)}}
The Melbourne Football Club's rules of 1859 are the oldest surviving set of laws for Australian football. The [[Melbourne rules#Melbourne Rules of 1859|ten simple rules]] were drawn up on 17 May at a meeting chaired by Tom Wills and in attendance were journalists [[William Hammersley|W. J. Hammersley]] and [[J. B. Thompson]], and [[Thomas H. Smith]].<ref name="piesse" /> The meeting was held at the Parade Hotel, [[East Melbourne]] hosted by owner and Melbourne Cricket Club member [[James Bryant (Australian cricketer)|Jerry Bryant]]. The publican was a friend of Wills with a personal interest in introducing football to Melbourne's schools. Bryant had played a role in organising early football matches at the nearby Richmond Paddock and his son was one of the first players.<ref>''Melbourne FC Since 1858: An Illustrated History''. Goeff Slattery Publishing, pg 20–10.</ref> The rules were signed by Tom Wills, William Hammersley, J. Sewell, J. B. Thompson, Alex Bruce, T. Butterworth and Thomas H. Smith. Importantly, the rules were widely publicised and distributed. Having been codified in 1859, Australian football is older than any other major football code, including [[association football|soccer]] (codified in 1863) and [[rugby union]] (codified in 1871).

===Early competition in Victoria===
{{See also|List of Australian rules football clubs by date of establishment}}
[[File:Australianfootball1866.jpg|thumb|left|Engraving of a football match at the [[Yarra Park|Richmond Paddock]] ([[Yarra Park]]), 1860s. A pavilion at the MCG is on the left in the background.]]

In 1859 several new football clubs formed including the [[Castlemaine Football Club]], [[Geelong Football Club]] and the [[Melbourne University Football Club]]. While many one-off matches are recorded to have taken place between several early teams from Melbourne's suburbs and country Victoria (such as the [[Ballarat]] and Geelong competitions), in the early days many had not yet formed clubs for regular competition.

The first trophy for Australian Rules Football, the 1861 [[Challenge Cup (Australia)|Challenge Cup]], was won in 1862 under Melbourne's rules by University over Melbourne. The competition continued into the 1860s with the addition of other teams from Melbourne's suburbs. Two further competitions, the South Yarra Challenge Cup (which had evolved from the Caledonian Games) and "Second Twenties" were held in the 1860s and 1870s.

Some rival rules eventually gave way to an acceptance of the Melbourne rules. In 1860, the Melbourne Football Club redrafted its rules following the input of several other clubs. The requirement to bounce the ball while running was introduced in a significant redraft of the Melbourne rules in 1866 by H. C. A. Harrison and his rules committee to satisfy the Geelong Football Club's own set of very different rules.<ref>G. M. Hibbins. ''Sport and Racing in Colonial Melbourne: The Cousins and Me: Colden Harrison, Tom Wills and William Hammersley''. Lynedoch 2007, chs 8, 9.</ref> Behind posts, introduced at this time, are also believed to have come directly from the Geelong rules. The new rules became known as the Victorian rules, which became more widely adopted. In 1869, a 100-minute time limit was introduced to the game for the first time. Previous to this, winners were decided in a number of ways, but most commonly the first side to kick two goals.

The relationship with cricket primarily came out of co-existence and many of football's founders were cricketers. As a result, the sport shares some terminology (i.e. "umpires" and "boundary"). However cricket authorities did not initially allow football to be played on their grounds and in the early years football was played primarily in parks. The first football match played at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG) was not until 1876. Cricket authorities soon saw the opportunity to capitalise on the rapid growth of Australian football, however, and soon most grounds in Victoria were expanded to accommodate the dual purpose, a situation that continues to this day.

Football matches between 1859 and 1899 were played in a 20-per-side format.

===Spread to other colonies===
{{Main|Australian rules football in Australia}}
[[File:Intercolonial Football Match 1879.jpg|right|thumb|Engraving of the first intercolonial football match between Victoria and South Australia at the [[East Melbourne Cricket Ground]], 1879]]
Gradually the game, known at first as "Melbourne rules" which became "Victorian rules" and then "Australian rules" or "Australasian rules," gained roots in other Australasian colonies—beginning with [[Australian rules football in South Australia|South Australia]] (1860), [[Australian rules football in Tasmania|Tasmania]] (1864), [[Australian rules football in Queensland|Queensland]] (1866), and [[Australian rules football in New Zealand|New Zealand]] (1871). In 1877, the sport's first [[sports governing body|governing bodies]], the [[SANFL|South Australian Football Association]] and the [[Victorian Football League|Victorian Football Association]] were formed on 30 April and 17 May respectively. The game began to be played in [[Australian rules football in New South Wales|New South Wales]] in 1877, in [[Australian rules football in Western Australia|Western Australia]] in 1881 (during the [[Australian rules football in Western Australia|1880s]], young men sent to school in Adelaide brought the game home when they had finished their education—more came from the eastern states later in the [[Western Australian gold rush]]) and the [[Australian rules football in the Australian Capital Territory|Australian Capital Territory]] in 1911. By 1916, the game was first played in the [[Australian rules football in the Northern Territory|Northern Territory]], establishing a permanent presence in all [[Australian states and territories|Australian states and mainland territories]].

Despite being the dominant code in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia late in the century the code was beginning to decline in New South Wales and Queensland largely due to competition with other more popular football codes, as well as [[Australian regional rivalries|interstate rivalries]] and the lack of strong local governing bodies. In the case of Sydney, denial of access to grounds and the loss of professional players to other football codes directly inhibited to the game's growth.

The first [[interstate matches in Australian rules football|intercolonial match]] had been played between Victoria and South Australia on 2 August 1879.

===Emergence of the VFL===
In 1896, delegates from the stronger and wealthier VFA clubs—Carlton, Collingwood, Essendon, Fitzroy, Geelong, Melbourne, St Kilda and South Melbourne—met to form a breakaway competition and in 1897, the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] (VFL), was born as an eight-team competition. Popularity of the VFL grew rapidly and by 1925 with 12 teams, had become the most prominent league in the game and would dominate so many aspects of the sport from that point on.

===Effects of the two world wars===

[[File:An appeal from the Dardanelles.jpg|thumb|upright|Australia's first [[recruitment poster]], published in 1915, questions the public's commitment to Australian football, rather than [[World War I|the war]].]]
Both World War I and World War II had a devastating effect on Australian football and on Australian sport in general. While scratch matches were played by Australian "[[digger (soldier)|diggers]]" in remote locations around the world, the game lost many of its great players to wartime service. Some competitions never fully recovered. Between 1914 and 1915 talks were held for a proposed amalgamation with [[rugby league]], the predominant code of football in New South Wales and Queensland, resulting in a trial run.<ref>{{Cite news

In Queensland, the state league went into recess for the duration of the war. VFL club University left the league and went into recess due to severe casualties. The WAFL lost two clubs and the SANFL was suspended for one year in 1916 due to heavy club losses. [[The ANZAC Day clash]] is one example of how the war continues to be remembered in the football community.

===Interstate football and the Australian National Football Council===
{{Further|Interstate matches in Australian rules football}}
[[File:SCG Aussie Rules 1933.jpg|thumb|left|New South Wales and Queensland compete at the [[1933 Sydney Carnival|1933 Australian Football Carnival]] at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]].]]
The Australian National Football Council's primary role was to govern the game at national level to facilitate interstate representative and club competition.

The ANFC ran the [[Championship of Australia]], the first national club competition, which commenced in 1888 and saw clubs from different states compete on an even playing field. During this time, the [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] won a record four national club championships. Although clubs from other states were at times invited, the final was almost always between the premiers from the two strongest state competitions of the time—South Australia and Victoria—and the majority of matches were played in Adelaide at the request of the [[South Australian National Football League|SAFA/SAFL]]. The last match was played in 1976, with [[North Adelaide Football Club|North Adelaide]] being the last non-Victorian winner in 1972. Between 1976 and 1987, the ANFC, and later the Australian Football Championships (AFC) ran a [[Australian Football League pre-season competition|night series]], which invited clubs and representative sides from around the country to participate in a knock-out tournament parallel to the premiership seasons, which Victorian sides still dominated.

With the lack of international competition, representative matches between state teams were regarded with great importance. Originating from the early intercolonial matches, these tests continued well after [[Federation of Australia]] in 1901 and the Australian Football Council co-ordinated regular interstate carnivals. In 1908, a [[1908 Melbourne Carnival|Jubilee Australasian Football Carnival]] was held to celebrate 50 years of Australian Football. The carnival included teams representing [[Australian rules football in Victoria|Victoria]], [[Australian rules football in South Australia|South Australia]], [[Australian rules football in Queensland|Queensland]], [[Australian rules football in New South Wales|New South Wales]], [[Australian rules football in Tasmania|Tasmania]], [[Australian rules football in Western Australia|Western Australia]] and [[Australian rules football in New Zealand|New Zealand]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australianfootball.com/articles/view/A%2Bfalse%2Bdawn%2B-%2B1908%2BMelbourne%2BCarnival%253A%2BNew%2BZealand%2Bv%2BNew%2BSouth%2BWales/57|title=A False Dawn |publisher=AustralianFootball.com |date=20 August 1908 |accessdate=19 February 2010 |deadurl=no}}</ref> Due in part to Victoria recruiting some of the best players to play in the VFL, Victoria dominated interstate matches for three quarters of a century. Representative football was kept alive longer than the national club competition with the introduction of [[Interstate matches in Australian rules football#State of origin|State of origin]] rules in 1977. The new rules mean that rather than representing the state of their adopted club, players would return to play for the state they were first recruited in. This instantly broke Victoria's stranglehold over state titles and Western Australia and South Australia began to win more of their games against Victoria. Both New South Wales and Tasmania scored surprise victories at home against Victoria in 1990.

===Towards a national competition===

Traditionally held at the MCG, the Grand Final is the [[List of sports attendance figures#Top Leagues in recent domestic club championship event attendance|highest attended club championship event in the world]].]]
In 1978, the term [[Barassi Line]] was used to describe the dichotomy that existed in Australia's football culture, where Australian Football was most popular in all states bar New South Wales and Queensland. This description prompted the first suggestions of regular interstate club competition and of overcoming the dichotomy and establishing a national league.<ref>Referenced in {{Cite book| last = Hutchinson | first = Garrie | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1983 | title = The Great Australian Book of Football Stories | publisher = Currey O'Neil | location = Melbourne | id = }}</ref>

By 1980, the way the game was played had changed dramatically due to innovative coaching tactics, with the phasing out of many of the game's kicking styles and the increasing use of handball; while presentation was influenced by television.<ref>WICKS, B. M. Whatever Happened to Australian Rules? Hobart, Tasmania, Libra Books. 1980, First Edition. (ISBN 0-909619-06-9)</ref>

In 1982, in a move that heralded big changes within the sport, one of the original VFL clubs and now struggling, South Melbourne, relocated to Sydney and became known as the [[Sydney Swans]]. In the late 1980s, due to the poor financial standing of many of the Victorian clubs, the VFL pursued a more national competition. Two more non-Victorian clubs, the [[West Coast Eagles]] and the [[Brisbane Bears Football Club|Brisbane Bears]], began playing in 1987. In their early years, the Sydney and Brisbane clubs struggled both on and off-field because the substantial TV revenues they generated by playing on a Sunday went to the VFL. To protect these revenues the VFL granted significant draft concessions and financial aid to keep them competitive. Each club was required to pay a licence fee which allowed the Victorian-based clubs to survive.

[[File:Port Adelaide heads for the AFL.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Founded in 1870, {{AFL Por}} was the only pre-existing club outside Victoria to gain entry into the AFL.]]
The league changed its name to the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) following the 1989 season. In 1991, it gained its first South Australian team, the [[Adelaide Crows]], which paid five million dollars to enter the AFL. During the next five years, two more non-Victorian teams, the [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle Dockers]] and [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide Power]], joined the league. In 2011 and 2012, respectively, two new non-Victorian teams were added to the competition, the [[Gold Coast Football Club|Gold Coast Suns]] and [[Greater Western Sydney Giants]]. The AFL, currently with 18 member clubs, is the sport's elite competition and the most powerful body and continues to seek further opportunities to expand into new markets.

Following the emergence of the Australian Football League, the SANFL, WAFL and other state leagues rapidly declined to a secondary status. Apart from these there are many semi-professional and amateur leagues around Australia, where they play a very important role in the community, and particularly so in rural areas. The VFA, still in existence a century after the original schism, merged with the former VFL reserves competition in 1998. The new entity adopted the VFL name and remained a primarily state-based competition.

State of origin games also declined in importance, especially after an increasing number of withdrawals by AFL players. The AFL turned its focus for representation to an annual [[International Rules Series]] against [[Ireland]] in 1998 before abolishing State of Origin in 1999. The second-tier state and territorial leagues still contest interstate representative matches.

Although a [[Tasmanian AFL Bid]] has been ongoing, the AFL's recent focus has been gaining market share in lucrative broadcasting rights in two populous Australian states, helped by introducing clubs on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] and in [[Greater Western Sydney]]. The AFL regularly schedules pre-season exhibition matches in all Australian states and territories as part of the [[Regional Challenge]].

The AFL has signalled further expansion by scheduling a competition match in New Zealand 2013 and up to three competition matches in 2014 played in Wellington.

After World War II, the sport experienced a small amount of growth in the Pacific region, particularly in [[Australian rules football in Nauru|Nauru]], where Australian football is the [[national sport]], as well as [[Australian rules football in Papua New Guinea|Papua New Guinea]] and [[Australian rules football in New Zealand|New Zealand]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://afl.com.au/tabid/208/default.aspx?newsid=64399 |title=Team Profile: Nauru Chiefs |first=Chelsea |last=Roffey |author-link=Chelsea Roffey|publisher=Afl.com.au |date=30 July 2008 |accessdate=19 February 2010}}</ref>

===International rules football===
{{Main|International rules football}}
{{See also|Relationship between Gaelic football and Australian rules football}} 
Since 1967 there have been many matches between Australian football teams (mainly from Australia) and [[Gaelic football]] teams (mainly from Ireland), under various sets of hybrid, compromise rules known as [[International rules football]]. In 1984, the first official representative matches of International Rules were played, and these were played annually each October between the AFL and the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], also known as the GAA, between 1998 and 2006. These were part of the official [[International Rules Series]], which attracted large crowds and media interest in Ireland and Australia. In 2007 the international rules series was abandoned because of the aggression and the severity of the Australian team in the previous year, but in 2008, under new rules to protect the player with the ball, it resumed in Australia.
