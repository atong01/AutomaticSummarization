'''Alexander II''' was a king of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]], and the son of [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] and [[Lanassa (wife of Pyrrhus)|Lanassa]], the daughter of the Sicilian tyrant [[Agathocles of Syracuse|Agathocles]].<ref name="DGRBM">{{cite encyclopedia | last = Mason | first = Charles Peter | authorlink = | title = Alexander | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] | volume = 1 | pages = 116 | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]] | location = Boston | year = 1867 | url = http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moa;cc=moa;idno=acl3129.0001.001;size=l;frm=frameset;seq=131;page=root;view=image}}</ref>

==Reign==
He succeeded his father as king in 272 BC, and continued the war which his father had begun with [[Antigonus II Gonatas]], whom he succeeded in driving from the kingdom of [[Macedon]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}  
He was, however, dispossessed of both [[Macedon]] and [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] by [[Demetrius II of Macedon]], the son of Antigonus II; upon which he took refuge amongst the [[Acarnania]]ns. By their assistance and that of his own subjects, who entertained a great attachment for him, he recovered Epirus. It appears that he was in alliance with the [[Aetolia]]ns.

Alexander married his paternal half-sister [[Olympias II of Epirus|Olympias]], by whom he had two sons, [[Pyrrhus II of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], [[Ptolemy of Epirus|Ptolemy]] and a daughter, [[Phthia of Macedon|Phthia]]. On the death of Alexander, around 242 BC, Olympias assumed the regency on behalf of her sons, and married Phthia to Demetrius.<ref>''Universal Pronouncing Dictionary of Biography and Mythology'', by Joseph Thomas - 1908 - page 90</ref>  
There are extant silver and copper coins of this king.  
The former bear a youthful head covered with the skin of an elephant's head.  
The reverse represents Pallas holding a spear in one hand and a shield in the other, and before her stands an eagle on a thunderbolt.<ref>[[Justin (historian)|Justin]], xvii. 1, xxvi. 2, 3, xxviii. 1</ref><ref>[[Polybius]],  ii. 45, ix. 34</ref><ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Pyrrhus'' 9</ref>

Alexander is apparently mentioned in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], as one of the recipients of the Indian Emperor [[Ashoka the Great|Ashoka]]'s [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] proselytism.<ref>"The conquest by [[Dharma]] has been won here, on the borders, and even six hundred [[yojana]]s (5,400-9,600 km) away, where the Greek king [[Antiochus II Theos|Antiochos]] rules, beyond there where the four kings named [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy]], [[Antigonus Gonatas|Antigonos]], [[Magas of Cyrene|Magas]] and Alexander rule, likewise in the south among the [[Chola dynasty|Chola]]s, the [[Pandya]]s, and as far as [[Tamraparni]] ([[Sri Lanka]])." ([[Edicts of Ashoka]], 13th Rock Edict, S. Dhammika).</ref>
