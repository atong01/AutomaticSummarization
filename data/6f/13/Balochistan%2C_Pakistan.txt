'''Balochistan'''  ([[Balochi language|Balochi]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], {{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|'''بلوچِستان'''}}}}, {{transl|ur|''Balōčistān''}}, {{IPA-hns|bəloːt͡ʃɪst̪ɑːn|pron}}), is one of the [[Four Provinces (Pakistan)|four provinces of Pakistan]], located in the [[Geography of Pakistan|southwestern]] region of the country. Its provincial capital and largest city is [[Quetta]]. It shares borders with [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] and the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] to the northeast, [[Sindh]] to the southeast,   the [[Arabian Sea]] to the south,  [[Iran]] to the west, and [[Afghanistan]] to the north.

Most of the province's inhabitants are [[Baloch people|Baloch]]s, [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]] and [[Brahui people|Brahuis]] though there are smaller communities of [[Baloch people|Iranian Baloch]]s, [[Hazara people|Hazara]]s, [[Sindhis]], [[Punjabis]], and other settlers such as the [[Uzbeks]], and [[Turkmens]]. The name [[Balochistan]] means "''the land of the Baloch''" in many regional languages. Although largely underdeveloped, the [[Economy of Balochistan, Pakistan|provincial economy]] is dominated by natural resources, especially its [[Oil and Gas Development Company|natural gas fields]], which supply the entire country. [[Gwadar Port]] also plays a significant role in the economic development of the province.

Balochistan is noted for its unique culture, extremely dry [[List of deserts of Pakistan|desert climate]], and the [[Sulaiman Mountains]].<ref>Weiss, Anita M. and Mughal, Muhammad Aurang Zeb. 2012.

===Early history===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2012}}
[[File:IVC-major-sites-2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Map showing the sites and extent of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]]. [[Mohenjo-Daro]] and [[Mehrgarh]] were one of the centers of the Indus Valley Civilisation, both located in modern-day Pakistani Balochistan. Pakistani Balochistan marked the westernmost territory of the civilisation, and the latter was one of the most developed in the old [[Bronze Age]] in the world.]]
Pakistani Balochistan occupies the very southeastern-most portion of the [[Iranian Plateau]], the site of the earliest known farming settlements in the pre-[[Indus Valley Civilization]] era, the earliest of which was [[Mehrgarh]], dated at 7000 BC, located in modern-day Pakistani Balochistan. Pakistani Balochistan marked the westernmost extent of the Indus Valley Civilisation. Centuries before the arrival of [[Islam]] in the 7th Century, parts of Pakistani Balochistan was ruled by the [[Paratarajas]], an [[Indo-Scythians|Indo-Scythian]] dynasty. At certain times, the [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]] also held political sway on parts of Pakistani Balochistan.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

A theory of the origin of the [[Baloch people]], the largest ethnic group in the region, is that they are of [[Medes|Median]] descent,<ref>M. Longworth Dames, Balochi Folklore, ''Folklore'', Vol. 13, No. 3 (29 Sep. 1902), pp. 252–274</ref> and are a Kurdish group that has absorbed [[Ancient Dravidian culture|Dravidian]] genes and cultural traits, primarily from [[Brahui people]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} With time, Baloch tribes linguistically absorbed all the local people in [[Makran]], southern Sistan and the Brahui country, becoming rival in size to the other [[Iranian languages|Iranian-speaking]] groups in the region.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

In 654, Abdulrehman ibn Samrah, governor of Sistan and the newly emerged [[Rashidun caliphate]] at the expense of Sassanid Persia and the Byzantine Empire, sent an Islamic army to crush a revolt in [[Zaranj]], which is now in southern Afghanistan. After conquering Zaranj, a column of the army pushed north, conquering [[Kabul]] and [[Ghazni]], in the [[Hindu Kush]] mountain range, while another column moved through [[Quetta District]] in north-western Balochistan and conquered the area up to the ancient cities of ''Dawar'' and ''Qandabil'' ([[Bolan District|Bolan]]).<ref>Tabqat ibn Saad, Vol. 8, p. 471</ref> By 654, the whole of what is now Balochistan was controlled by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], except for the well-defended mountain town of ''QaiQan'' which is now [[Kalat, Pakistan|Kalat]]. However, this town was later conquered during the reign of Caliph Ali.<ref>[[Futuh al-Buldan]], p. 386 incomplete citation, needs edition statement to identify the page</ref>{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Abdulrehman ibn Samrah made Zaranj his provincial capital and remained governor of these conquered areas from 654 to 656, until Uthman was murdered.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

During the Caliphate of Ali, revolt broke out in southern Balochistan's Makran region.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Due to civil war in the Rashidun Caliphate, Ali was unable to deal with these areas until 660, when he sent a large force, under the command of Haris ibn Marah Abdi, towards Makran and Sindh.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Haris ibn Marah Abdi arrived in Makran and conquered it by force, and then moved northward to north-eastern Balochistan and reconquered ''Qandabil'' (Bolan). Finally, he moved south and conquered Kalat after a fierce battle.<ref>Rashidun Caliphate and Hind, by Qazi Azher Mubarek Puri, published by Takhliqat, [[Lahore]] [[Pakistan]]</ref> In 663, during the reign of [[Umayyad]] Caliph [[Muawiyah I]], Muslims lost control of north-eastern Balochistan and Kalat when Haris ibn Marah and large part of his army died in battle against a revolt in Kalat.<ref>Tarikh al Khulfa, Vol. 1, pp. 214–215, 229</ref> Muslim forces later regained control of the area during the Umayyad reign. It also remained a part of the [[Abbasid]] Caliphate.

In the 15th century, [[Mir Chakar Khan Rind]] became the first king of Afghan and Pakistani Balochistan, after which the region was dominated by the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurids]], who controlled most of [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[Western Asia]]. The [[Mughal Empire]] also controlled some parts of the area. When [[Nadir Shah]] won the allegiance of the rulers of eastern Balochistan, he ceded [[Kalhora]], one of the [[Sindh]] territories of [[Sibi]]-Kachi to the Khan of Kalat.<ref>[http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/the-newspaper/letters-to-the-editor/baloch-national-identity-in-karachi Dawn.com] {{wayback|url=http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/the-newspaper/letters-to-the-editor/baloch-national-identity-in-karachi |date=20121008054413 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.iranica.com/newsite/index.isc?Article=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v3f6/v3f6a030.html Iranica.com] {{wayback|url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/index.isc?Article=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v3f6/v3f6a030.html |date=20120604103740 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://panhwar.org/Article26.htm|title=Ghulam Shah Kalhora and Relations With Kutch|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2014}}</ref> [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]], founder of the Afghan Empire, also won the allegiance of that area's rulers. Most of the area would eventually revert to local Baloch control, after Afghan rule.

===British rule===
During the period of the [[British Raj]], there were four [[Princely State]]s in Balochistan: [[Makran (princely state)|Makran]], [[Kharan (princely state)|Kharan]], [[Las Bela (princely state)|Las Bela]] and [[Kalat (princely state)|Kalat]]. In 1876, Sir [[Robert Groves Sandeman|Robert Sandeman]] negotiated the [[Treaty of Kalat]], which brought the Khan's territories, including Kharan, Makran, and Las Bela, under British suzerainty.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Naseer|last1=Dashti|title=The Baloch and Balochistan: A Historical Account from the Beginning to the Fall of the Baloch State|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xIjyLNpusbAC|year= 2012|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=978-1-4669-5896-8|p=247}}</ref> After the [[Second Afghan War]] was ended by the [[Treaty of Gandamak]] in May 1879, the [[Mohammad Yaqub Khan|Afghan Emir]] ceded the districts of Quetta, [[Pishin District|Pishin]], [[Harnai District|Harnai]], Sibi and [[Thal Chotiali]] to the British. In 1883, the British took control of the [[Bolan Pass]], south-east of Quetta, from the [[Khan of Kalat]]. In 1887, some areas of Balochistan were declared British territory. In 1893, Sir [[Mortimer Durand]] negotiated an agreement with the [[Amir]] of Afghanistan, [[Abdur Rahman Khan]], to fix the [[Durand Line]] running from [[Chitral]] to Balochistan as the boundary between the [[Emirate of Afghanistan]] and British-controlled areas. Two devastating earthquakes occurred in Balochistan during British colonial rule: the [[1935 Balochistan earthquake]], which devastated [[Quetta]], and the [[1945 Balochistan earthquake]] with its epicentre in the Makran region.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

===After independence===
In August 1947 the [[Chief Commissioner's Province of Balochistan]] immediately became part of Pakistan, followed by the princely states of [[Makran]], [[Kharan (princely state)|Kharan]], [[Las Bela (princely state)|Las Bela]], and the [[Khanate of Kalat]], who decided to accede to Pakistan in March 1948. The Khan of Kalat agreed to join Pakistan under the condition that defence, currency, foreign relations, and finance would be controlled by the federal government, but that the province would remain otherwise autonomous. The four princely states together formed the [[Balochistan States Union]] in October 1952. The enclave of [[Gwadar]] was excluded from this as it was still part of the Sultanate of Oman.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In October 1955, formation of one unit resulted in the Balochistan States Union and the Chief Commissioner's Province of Balochistan being merged with all the remaining provinces and princely states in other parts of Pakistan to form the province of [[West Pakistan]]. The enclave of Gwadar was purchased from Oman in October 1958 and was also merged with West Pakistan. The province was officially dissolved in 1970 and the former Balochistan States Union, former Chief Commissioner's Province of Balochistan were combined to form the new province of Balochistan. The government of Pakistan later decided to incorporate Gwadar in to Balochistan in 1977, thus expanding Balochistan province to its current form.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}[[Balochistan conflict|Insurgencies]] by Baloch nationalists took place in 1948, 1958–59, 1962–63 and 1973-77<ref name=Hussain-4-25-13/> — with a new and reportedly stronger ongoing insurgency by autonomy-seeking Baloch groups beginning in 2003.<ref name=Hussain-4-25-13>{{cite news|last1=Hussain|first1=Zahid|title=The battle for Balochistan|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/794058/the-battle-for-balochistan|accessdate=22 June 2015|agency=Dawn|date=Apr 25, 2013|quote=Since Balochistan became part of Pakistan some 65 years ago, Baloch nationalists have led four insurgencies — in 1948, 1958-59, 1962-63 and 1973-77 — which were brutally suppressed by the state.

==Geography==
[[File:Astola Island.jpg|thumb|left|[[Astola Island]]]]
Balochistan is situated in the southwest of Pakistan and covers an area of {{convert|347,190|km2|mi2}}. It is Pakistan's largest province by area, constituting 44% of Pakistan's total land mass. The province is bordered by [[Afghanistan]] to the north and north-west, Iran to the south-west, [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] and Sindh, and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] to the north-east. To the south lies the [[Arabian Sea]]. Balochistan is located on the south-eastern part of the Iranian plateau. It borders the geopolitical regions of the Middle East and Southwest Asia, Central Asia and South Asia. Balochistan lies at the mouth of the [[Strait of Hormuz]] and provides the shortest route from seaports to Central Asia. Its geographical location has placed the otherwise desolate region in the scope of competing global interests for all of recorded history.

The capital city Quetta is located in a densely populated portion of the [[Sulaiman Mountains]] in the north-east of the province. It is situated in a river valley near the Bolan Pass, which has been used as the route of choice from the coast to Central Asia, entering through Afghanistan's [[Kandahar]] region. The British and other historic empires have crossed the region to invade Afghanistan by this route.<ref>Bolan Pass – Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition</ref>

Balochistan is rich in exhaustible and renewable resources; it is the second major supplier of natural gas in Pakistan. The province's renewable and human resource potential has not been systematically measured or exploited due to pressures from within and without Pakistan. Local inhabitants have chosen to live in towns and have relied on sustainable water sources for thousands of years.

===Climate===
The climate of the upper highlands is characterised by very cold winters and hot summers.<ref>Weiss, Anita M. and Mughal, Muhammad Aurang Zeb. 2012. [http://dro.dur.ac.uk/10909/2/10909P.pdf Pakistan]. Louis Kotzé and Stephen Morse (eds), Berkshire Encyclopedia of Sustainability, Vol. 9. Great Barrington, MA: Berkshire, pp. 236-240.</ref> In the lower highlands, winters vary from extremely cold in northern districts [[Ziarat]], Quetta, Kalat, Muslim Baagh and Khanozai to milder conditions closer to the Makran coast. Winters are mild on the plains, with temperature never falling below freezing point. Summers are hot and dry, especially in the arid zones of Chagai and Kharan districts. The plains are also very hot in summer, with temperatures reaching {{convert|50|C|F}}.The record highest temperature, {{convert|53|C|F}}, was recorded in Sibi on 26 May 2010,<ref>[http://www.pakmet.com.pk/latest%20news/Latest%20News.html Pakmet.com.pk]</ref> exceeding the previous record, {{convert|52|C|F}}. Other hot areas includes, [[Turbat]], and [[Dalbandin]]. The desert climate is characterised by hot and very arid conditions. Occasionally strong windstorms make these areas very inhospitable.

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Balochistan, Pakistan}}
The economy of Balochistan is largely based upon the production of natural gas, coal and other minerals.<ref name="Ethnic Subnationalist Insurgencies in South Asia: Identities, Interests and Challenges to State Authority">{{cite book|last1=Chima|first1=Jugdep S.|title=Ethnic Subnationalist Insurgencies in South Asia: Identities, Interests and Challenges to State Authority|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1138839922|page=126|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=x8sqBwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA126&dq=Balochistan%2C%20Pakistan%20gas%2C%20coal&pg=PA126#v=onepage&q=Balochistan,%20Pakistan%20gas,%20coal&f=false}}</ref> Other important economic sectors include fisheries, mining, manufacturing industries, trade and other services being rendered by public and private sector organisations. Tourism remains limited but has increased due to the exotic appeal of the province. Limited farming in the east and fishing along the Arabian Sea coastline provide income and sustenance for the local population. Due to the tribal lifestyle of many Baloch and Brahui people, animal husbandry and trading bazaars found throughout the province are important.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Balochistan has been called a "neglected province where a majority of population lacks amenities".<ref name=dawn-22-3-12>{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/704521/balochistan-ruling-elites-lifestyle-outshines-that-of-arab-royals|title=Baloch ruling elite's lifestyle outshines that of Arab royals|work=Dawn|date=22 March 2012|accessdate=6 July 2015}}</ref><ref name=kupecz/> Since the mid-1970s the province's share of Pakistan's GDP has dropped from 4.9 to 3.7%,<ref>Jetly, Rajsree.

Though the province remains largely underdeveloped, several major development projects, including the construction of a new deep sea port at the strategically important town of [[Gwadar]],<ref name="pakboi">{{cite web|url=http://www.pakboi.gov.pk/News_Event/Gawadar.html|title=Gawader|accessdate=2006-11-19|work=Pakistan Board of Investment |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061002105003/http://www.pakboi.gov.pk/News_Event/Gawadar.html |archivedate = 2006-10-02}}</ref> are in progress in Balochistan.

===Natural resource extraction===
Balochistan's share of Pakistan's national income has historically ranged between 3.7% to 4.9%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spdc.org.pk/pubs/nps/nps5.pdf|title=Provincial Accounts of Pakistan: Methodology and Estimates 1973–2000}}{{dead link|date=June 2015}}</ref> Since 1972, Balochistan's gross income has grown in size by 2.7 times.<ref>[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/PAKISTANEXTN/Resources/293051-1241610364594/6097548-1257441952102/balochistaneconomicreportvol2.pdf Siterresources.worldbank.org]</ref> Outside Quetta, the resource extraction infrastructure of the province is gradually developing but still lags far behind other parts of Pakistan.

There is Chinese involvement in the nearby [[Saindak]] gold and copper mining project where deposits exist in the [[Chagai District]] in [[Reko Diq]] area. The main license is held jointly by the Government of Balochistan (25%), the rest by foreign interests [[Antofagasta Minerals]] (37.5%) and [[Barrick Gold]] (37.5%).
