He also studied vibrational theory, the theory of Brownian movement, and mathematical statistics. In 1912, at the request of the editors of the<space/><italics>Handbook of Electricity and Magnetism</italics>, Schrdinger wrote an article titled<space/><italics>Dieelectrism</italics>. That same year, Schrdinger gave a theoretical estimate of the probable height distribution of radioactive substances, which is required to explain the observed radioactivity of the atmosphere, and in August 1913 executed several experiments in Zeehame that confirmed his theoretical estimate and those of Victor Franz Hess. For this work, Schrdinger was awarded the 1920 Haytingera Prize (Haitinger-Preis) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Mehra">Mehra, J. and Rechenberg, H.

The last work he performed together with his friend Fritz Kohlrausch. In 1919, Schrdinger performed his last physical experiment on coherent light and subsequently focused on theoretical studies.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Quantum mechanics</heading><heading level='4'>New quantum theory</heading><paragraph>In the first years of his career Schrdinger became acquainted with the ideas of quantum theory, developed in the works of<space/><link><target>Max Planck</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Albert Einstein</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Niels Bohr</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Arnold Sommerfeld</target></link>, and others. This knowledge helped him work on some problems in theoretical physics, but the Austrian scientist at the time was not yet ready to part with the traditional methods of classical physics.</paragraph><paragraph>The first publications of Schrdinger about atomic theory and the theory of spectra began to emerge only from the beginning of the 1920s, after his personal acquaintance with Sommerfeld and<space/><link><target>Wolfgang Pauli</target></link><space/>and his move to Germany. In January 1921, Schrdinger finished his first article on this subject, about the framework of the Bohr-Sommerfeld effect of the interaction of electrons on some features of the spectra of the alkali metals. Of particular interest to him was the introduction of relativistic considerations in quantum theory. In autumn 1922 he analyzed the electron orbits in an atom from a geometric point of view, using methods developed by the mathematician<space/><link><target>Hermann Weyl</target></link><space/>(18851955). This work, in which it was shown that quantum orbits are associated with certain geometric properties, was an important step in predicting some of the features of wave mechanics. Earlier in the same year he created the Schrdinger equation of the relativistic Doppler effect for spectral lines, based on the hypothesis of light quanta and considerations of energy and momentum. He liked the idea of his teacher Exner on the statistical nature of the conservation laws, so he enthusiastically embraced the articles of Bohr,<space/><link><target>Hans Kramers</target><part>Kramers</part></link>, and<space/><link><target>John C.
