[[File:Printer.ogg|thumb|A video showing an [[inkjet printer]] while printing a page.]]

In computing, a '''printer''' is a [[peripheral]] which makes a persistent human readable representation of graphics or text on paper or similar physical media.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/printer|title=Printer - Definition of printer by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com}}</ref> The two most common printer mechanisms are black and white [[laser printer]]s used for common documents, and color [[inkjet printer]]s which can produce high quality photograph quality output.

The world's first computer printer was a 19th-century mechanically driven apparatus invented by [[Charles Babbage]] for his [[difference engine]].<ref>{{citation | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/710950.stm | title = Babbage printer finally runs | publisher = BBC News | date = 13 April 2000}}</ref> This system used a series of metal rods with characters printed on them and stuck a roll of paper against the rods to print the characters. The first commercial printers generally used mechanisms from [[electric typewriter]]s and [[Teletype]] machines, which operated in a similar fashion. The demand for higher speed led to the development of new systems specifically for computer use. Among the systems widely used through the 1980s were [[daisy wheel printing|daisy wheel]] systems similar to typewriters, [[line printer]]s that produced similar output but at much higher speed, and [[Dot matrix printing|dot matrix]] systems that could mix text and graphics but produced relatively low-quality output. The [[plotter]] was used for those requiring high quality line art like [[blueprint]]s.

The introduction of the low-cost laser printer in 1984 with the first [[HP LaserJet]], and the addition of [[PostScript]] in next year's [[LaserWriter|Apple LaserWriter]], set off a revolution in printing known as [[desktop publishing]]. Laser printers using PostScript mixed text and graphics, like dot-matrix printers, but at quality levels formerly available only from commercial [[typesetting]] systems. By 1990, most simple printing tasks like fliers and brochures were now created on [[personal computer]]s and then laser printed; expensive [[offset printing]] systems were being dumped as scrap. The [[HP Deskjet]] of 1988 offered the same advantages as laser printer in terms of flexibility, but produced somewhat lower quality output (depending on the paper) from much less expensive mechanisms. Inkjet systems rapidly displaced dot matrix and daisy wheel printers from the market. By the 2000s high-quality printers of this sort had fallen under the $100 price point and became commonplace.

The rapid update of [[internet]] [[email]] through the 1990s and into the 2000s has largely displaced the need for printing as a means of moving documents, and a wide variety of reliable storage systems means that a "physical backup" is of little benefit today. Even the desire for printed output for "offline reading" while on mass transit or aircraft has been displaced by [[e-book reader]]s and [[tablet computer]]s. Today, traditional printers are being used more for special purposes, like printing photographs or artwork, and are no longer a must-have peripheral.

Starting around 2010, [[3D printing]] became an area of intense interest, allowing the creation of physical objects with the same sort of effort as an early laser printer required to produce a brochure. These devices are in their earliest stages of development and have not yet become commonplace.

== Types of printers ==
''Personal'' printers are primarily designed to support individual users, and may be connected to only a single computer. These printers are designed for low-volume, short-turnaround [[print job]]s, requiring minimal setup time to produce a hard copy of a given document. However, they are generally slow devices ranging from 6 to around 25 pages per minute (ppm), and the cost per page is relatively high. However, this is offset by the on-demand convenience. Some printers can print documents stored on [[memory card]]s or from [[digital camera]]s and [[image scanner|scanner]]s.

''Networked'' or ''shared'' printers are "designed for high-volume, high-speed printing."  They are usually shared by many users on a network and can print at speeds of 45 to around 100 ppm.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Morley|first1=Deborah|title=Understanding Computers: Today & Tomorrow, Comprehensive 2007 Update Edition|date=April 2007|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9781305172425|page=164|url=http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Computers-Tomorrow-Comprehensive-Update-ebook/dp/B00H7HUHXY/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1402428267&sr=1-1&keywords=9781305172425}}</ref> The [[Xerox 9700]] could achieve 120 ppm.

A ''[[virtual printer]]'' is a piece of computer software whose user interface and [[Application programming interface|API]] resembles that of a printer driver, but which is not connected with a physical computer printer.

A ''[[3D printing|3D printer]]'' is a device for making a three-dimensional object from a 3D model or other electronic data source through additive processes in which successive layers of material ( including plastics, metals, food, cement, wood, and other materials) are laid down under computer control.  It is called a printer by analogy with an inkjet printer which produces a two-dimensional document by a similar process of depositing a layer of ink on paper.

== Technology ==
The choice of print technology has a great effect on the cost of the printer and cost of operation, speed, quality and permanence of documents, and noise. Some printer technologies don't work with certain types of physical media, such as [[carbon paper]] or [[transparency (projection)|transparencies]].

A second aspect of printer technology that is often forgotten is resistance to alteration: liquid [[ink]], such as from an inkjet head or fabric ribbon, becomes absorbed by the paper fibers, so documents printed with liquid ink are more difficult to alter than documents printed with toner or solid inks, which do not penetrate below the paper surface.

Cheques can be printed with liquid ink or on special cheque paper with toner anchorage so that alterations may be detected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abagnale.com/pdf/protection_b.pdf|format=PDF|title=Protection Against Cheque Fraud|publisher=abagnale.com|author=Abagnale, Frank|authorlink=Frank Abagnale|year=2007|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> The machine-readable lower portion of a cheque must be printed using [[magnetic ink character recognition|MICR]] toner or ink. Banks and other clearing houses employ automation equipment that relies on the [[magnetic flux]] from these specially printed characters to function properly.

=== Modern print technology ===

The following [[printing]] technologies are routinely found in modern printers:

==== Toner-based printers ====
{{main|Laser printer}}

A [[laser printer]] rapidly produces high quality text and graphics. As with digital photocopiers and multifunction printers (MFPs), laser printers employ a [[xerography|xerographic]] printing process but differ from analog photocopiers in that the image is produced by the direct scanning of a [[laser]] beam across the printer's [[photodetector|photoreceptor]].

Another toner-based printer is the [[LED printer]] which uses an array of [[light-emitting diode|LEDs]] instead of a [[laser]] to cause toner [[adhesion]] to the print drum.

==== Liquid inkjet printers ====

[[File:Ink-jet-cartridge.jpg|thumb|left|Liquid ink cartridge from Hewlett-Packard HP 845C inkjet printer]]
[[Inkjet printer]]s operate by propelling variably sized droplets of liquid ink onto almost any sized page. They are the most common type of computer printer used by consumers.

==== Solid ink printers ====
{{main|Solid ink}}

[[Solid ink]] printers, also known as phase-change printers, are a type of [[thermal transfer printer]]. They use solid sticks of [[CMYK color model|CMYK]]-coloured ink, similar in consistency to candle wax, which are melted and fed into a piezo crystal operated print-head. The printhead sprays the ink on a rotating, oil coated drum. The paper then passes over the print drum, at which time the image is immediately transferred, or transfixed, to the page. Solid ink printers are most commonly used as colour office printers, and are excellent at printing on transparencies and other non-porous media. Solid ink printers can produce excellent results. Acquisition and operating costs are similar to [[laser printers]]. Drawbacks of the technology include high [[energy conservation|energy consumption]] and long warm-up times from a cold state. Also, some users complain that the resulting prints are difficult to write on, as the wax tends to repel inks from [[pen]]s, and are difficult to feed through [[automatic document feeder]]s, but these traits have been significantly reduced in later models. In addition, this type of printer is only available from one manufacturer, [[Xerox]], manufactured as part of their [[Xerox Phaser]] office printer line. Previously, [[solid ink]] printers were manufactured by [[Tektronix]], but Tek sold the printing business to Xerox in 2001.

==== Dye-sublimation printers ====
{{main|Dye-sublimation printer}}

[[Image:RGB dye sublimation panels.jpg|thumb|300px|A disassembled dye sublimation cartridge.]]
A dye-sublimation printer (or dye-sub printer) is a printer which employs a printing process that uses heat to transfer dye to a medium such as a plastic card, paper or [[canvas print|canvas]]. The process is usually to lay one colour at a time using a ribbon that has colour panels. Dye-sub printers are intended primarily for high-quality colour applications, including colour photography; and are less well-suited for text. While once the province of high-end print shops, dye-sublimation printers are now increasingly used as dedicated consumer photo printers.

==== Inkless printers{{anchor|Thermal printers}} ====

[[File:Twitter receipt printer.jpg|thumb|Receipt printer printing a Twitter timeline]]
[[inkless printers]] work by selectively heating regions of special heat-sensitive paper. Monochrome thermal printers are used in cash registers, [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]], [[Fuel dispenser|gasoline dispensers]] and some older inexpensive fax machines. Colours can be achieved with special papers and different temperatures and heating rates for different colours; these coloured sheets are not required in black-and-white output. One example is the ZINK technology (Zero INK Technology).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.zink.com/content/technology-0 |title=Technology–How it works &#124; ZINK &#124; Zero Ink |publisher=ZINK |date= |accessdate=2012-11-02}}</ref>

=== Obsolete and special-purpose printing technologies ===
[[File:Epson MX-80.jpg|thumb|Epson MX-80, a popular model of dot-matrix printer in use for many years]]

The following technologies are either obsolete, or limited to special applications though most were, at one time, in widespread use.

==== Impact printers ====
{{anchor|Impact_printers}}'''Impact printers''' rely on a forcible impact to transfer ink to the media. The impact printer uses a print head that either hits the surface of the ink ribbon, pressing the ink ribbon against the paper (similar to the action of a [[typewriter]]), or, less commonly, hits the back of the paper, pressing the paper against the ink ribbon (the [[IBM 1403]] for example).  All but the [[dot matrix printer]] rely on the use of ''fully formed characters'', [[letterform]]s that represent each of the characters that the printer was capable of printing. In addition, most of these printers were limited to monochrome, or sometimes two-color, printing in a single typeface at one time, although [[emphasis (typography)|bolding]] and [[underlining]] of text could be done by "overstriking", that is, printing two or more impressions either in the same character position or slightly offset. Impact printers varieties include typewriter-derived printers, teletypewriter-derived printers, daisywheel printers, dot matrix printers and line printers. Dot matrix printers remain in common use in businesses where multi-part forms are printed. ''An overview of impact printing''<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/416/zable.pdf| format=PDF-2031 KB | title=An overview of impact printing| publisher=[[IBM]] | work=Journal of Research and Development| author1=J.

===== Typewriter-derived printers =====
[[File:IBM Selectric typeball.jpg|thumb|left|typeball print element from IBM Selectric-type printer]]
{{main|Friden Flexowriter|IBM Selectric typewriter}}
Several different computer printers were simply computer-controllable versions of existing electric typewriters. The [[Friden Flexowriter]] and [[IBM Selectric typewriter|IBM Selectric-based]] printers were the most-common examples. The Flexowriter printed with a conventional typebar mechanism while the Selectric used IBM's well-known "golf ball" printing mechanism. In either case, the letter form then struck a ribbon which was pressed against the paper, printing one character at a time. The maximum speed of the Selectric printer (the faster of the two) was 15.5 characters per second.

===== Teletypewriter-derived printers =====
{{main|Teleprinter}}

The common [[teleprinter]] could easily be interfaced to the computer and became very popular except for those computers manufactured by [[IBM]]. Some models used a "typebox" that was positioned, in the X- and Y-axes, by a mechanism and the selected letter form was struck by a hammer. Others used a type cylinder in a similar way as the Selectric typewriters used their type ball. In either case, the letter form then struck a ribbon to print the letterform. Most teleprinters operated at ten characters per second although a few achieved 15 CPS.

===== Daisy wheel printers =====
[[File:Daisywheel 1.jpg|thumb|left|"daisy wheel"  print element]]
{{main|Daisy wheel printer}}
Daisy wheel printers operate in much the same fashion as a [[typewriter]]. A hammer strikes a wheel with petals, the "daisy wheel", each petal containing a letter form at its tip. The letter form strikes a ribbon of [[ink]], depositing the ink on the page and thus printing a character. By rotating the daisy wheel, different characters are selected for printing. These printers were also referred to as ''letter-quality printers'' because they could produce text which was as clear and crisp as a typewriter. The fastest letter-quality printers printed at 30 characters per second.

===== Dot-matrix printers =====
{{main|Dot matrix printer}}

[[File:Dot matrix example text.png|thumb|right|sample output from  9-pin dot matrix printer (one character expanded to show detail)]]
The term [[dot matrix printer]] is used for impact printers that use a matrix of small [[pin]]s to transfer ink to the page. The advantage of dot matrix over other impact printers is that they can produce [[graphic design|graphical]] images in addition to text; however the text is generally of poorer quality than impact printers that use letterforms (''type'').

Dot-matrix printers can be broadly divided into two major classes:
* Ballistic wire printers
* [[Stored energy printer]]s

Dot matrix printers can either be [[character (computing)|character]]-based or line-based (that is, a single horizontal series of pixels across the page), referring to the configuration of the print head.

In the 1970s & 80s, dot matrix printers were one of the more common types of printers used for general use, such as for home and small office use. Such printers normally had either 9 or 24 pins on the print head (early 7 pin printers also existed, which did not print [[descender]]s). There was a period during the early home computer era when a range of printers were manufactured under many brands such as the [[Commodore International|Commodore]] VIC-1525 using the [[Seikosha]] '''Uni-Hammer''' system.  This used a single solenoid with an oblique striker that would be actuated 7 times for each column of 7 vertical pixels while the head was moving at a constant speed. The angle of the striker would align the dots vertically even though the head had moved one dot spacing in the time.  The vertical dot position was controlled by a synchronised longitudinally ribbed platen behind the paper that rotated rapidly with a rib moving vertically seven dot spacings in the time it took to print one pixel column.<ref>{{cite web|title=MPS-801 printer|url=http://sleepingelephant.com/denial/wiki/index.php?title=MPS-801_printer|publisher=DenialWIKI|accessdate=22 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=VIC-1525 Graphics Printer User Manual|url=http://www.classiccmp.org/cini/pdf/Commodore/VIC-1525%20Printer%20User%27s%20Manual.pdf|publisher=Commodore Computer|accessdate=22 February 2015}}</ref> 24-pin print heads were able to print at a higher quality and started to offer additional type styles and were marketed as [[Dot matrix printing#Near Letter Quality .28NLQ.29|Near Letter Quality]] by some vendors. Once the price of inkjet printers dropped to the point where they were competitive with dot matrix printers, dot matrix printers began to fall out of favour for general use.

Some dot matrix printers, such as the NEC P6300, can be upgraded to print in colour. This is achieved through the use of a four-colour ribbon mounted on a mechanism (provided in an upgrade kit that replaces the standard black ribbon mechanism after installation) that raises and lowers the ribbons as needed. Colour graphics are generally printed in four passes at standard resolution, thus slowing down printing considerably. As a result, colour graphics can take up to four times longer to print than standard monochrome graphics, or up to 8-16 times as long at high resolution mode.

Dot matrix printers are still commonly used in low-cost, low-quality applications such as [[cash register]]s, or in demanding, very high volume applications like [[invoice]] printing. Impact printing, unlike laser printing, allows the pressure of the print head to be applied to a stack of two or more forms to print [[Multipart stationery|multi-part documents]] such as sales invoices and [[credit card]] receipts using [[continuous stationery]] with [[carbonless copy paper]]. Dot-matrix printers were being superseded even as receipt printers after the end of the twentieth century.

===== Line printers =====
{{main|Line printer}}
[[File:PrinterIBM1403 090325.jpg|thumb|left|IBM 1403 line printer]]

Line printers, as the name implies, print an entire line of text at a time. Four principal designs existed.
*''Drum printers'', where a horizontally mounted rotating drum carries the entire character set of the printer repeated in each printable character position.  The [[IBM 1132]] printer is an example of a drum printer. Drum printers were also found in adding machines and other numeric printers (POS), the dimensions were compact as only a dozen characters needed to be supported.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wolff|first1=John|title=The Olivetti Logos 240 Electronic Calculator - Technical Description|url=http://www.johnwolff.id.au/calculators/Tech/Logos240/Logos240.htm|publisher=John Wolff's Web Museum|accessdate=22 February 2015}}</ref>
*''Chain or train printers'', where the character set is arranged multiple times around a linked chain or a set of character slugs in a track traveling horizontally past the print line.  The [[IBM 1403]] is perhaps the must popular, and came in both chain and train varieties.  The ''band printer'' is a later variant where the characters are embossed on a flexible steel band.  The LP27 from Digital Equipment Corporation is a band printer.
*''Bar printers'', where the character set is attached to a solid bar that moves horizontally along the print line, such as the [[IBM 1443]].<ref>{{cite book|last=IBM Corporation|title=IBM 1443 PRINTER for 1620/1710 Systems|url=http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/ibm/1620/A26-5730-2_1443_printer_for_1620.pdf}}</ref>
*A fourth design, used mainly on very early printers such as the IBM 402, featured independent type bars, one for each printable position. Each bar contained the character set to be printed.  The bars moved vertically to position the character to be printed in front of the print hammer.<ref>{{cite book|last=IBM Corporation|title=IBM 402, 403 and 419 Accounting Machines Manual of Operation|year=1963|url=http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/ibm/punchedCard/AccountingMachine/224-1614-13_402-403-419.pdf}}</ref>

In each case, to print a line, precisely timed hammers strike against the back of the paper at the exact moment that the correct character to be printed is passing in front of the paper. The paper presses forward against a ribbon which then presses against the character form and the impression of the character form is printed onto the paper.

*''Comb printers'', also called ''[[line matrix printer]]s'', represent the fifth major design. These printers were a hybrid of [[dot matrix printing]] and line printing. In these printers, a comb of hammers printed a portion of a row of pixels at one time, such as every eighth pixel. By shifting the comb back and forth slightly, the entire pixel row could be printed, continuing the example, in just eight cycles. The paper then advanced and the next pixel row was printed. Because far less motion was involved than in a conventional dot matrix printer, these printers were very fast compared to dot matrix printers and were competitive in speed with formed-character line printers while also being able to print dot matrix graphics.  The [[Printronix]] P7000  series of line matrix printers are still manufactured as of 2013.

Line printers were the fastest of all impact printers and were used for bulk printing in large computer centres. A line printer could print at 1100 lines per minute or faster, frequently printing pages more rapidly than many current laser printers.  On the other hand, the mechanical components of line printers operated with tight tolerances and required regular [[preventive maintenance]] (PM) to produce top quality print. They were virtually never used with [[personal computer]]s and have now been replaced by high-speed [[laser printer]]s.  The legacy of line printers lives on in many computer [[operating system]]s, which use the abbreviations "lp", "lpr", or "LPT" to refer to printers.

==== Liquid ink electrostatic printers ====
{{refimprove section|date=May 2012}}

Liquid ink electrostatic printers use a chemical coated paper, which is charged by the print head according to the image of the document. The paper is passed near a pool of liquid ink with the opposite charge. The charged areas of the paper attract the ink and thus form the image. This process was developed from the process of [[electrofax|electrostatic copying]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cms.ironk12.org/TeacherWebsites/RyanDurfee/USHistory/HistoryStudentsWebsites/MadisonAlgerHISTORYWEBSITE/electrostaticprinter.html |title=Madison's website on Renn Zaphiropoulos |publisher=Cms.ironk12.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-02}}</ref> Color reproduction is very accurate, and because there is no heating the scale distortion is less than  ±0.1%. (All laser printers have an accuracy of ±1%.)

Worldwide, most survey offices used this printer before color inkjet plotters become popular. Liquid ink electrostatic printers were mostly available in {{convert|36|to|54|in}} width and also 6 color printing. These were also used to print large billboards. It was first introduced by Versatec, which was later bought by [[Xerox]]. [[3M]] also used to make these printers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wide-format-printers.org/3M_Scotchprint_Printer_2000/3M_Scotchprint_2000_signs.htm |title=Introduction to the 3M Scotchprint 2000 electrostatic printer |publisher=Wide-format-printers.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-02}}</ref>

==== Plotters ====
{{main|Plotter}}
[[File:Calcomp 565 drum plotter.jpg|thumb|right|A Calcomp 565 drum plotter.]]
Pen-based '''[[plotter]]s''' were an alternate printing technology once common in engineering and architectural firms. Pen-based plotters rely on contact with the paper (but not impact, per se) and special purpose pens that are mechanically run over the paper to create text and images. Since the pens output continuous lines, they were able to produce technical drawings of higher resolution than was achievable with dot-matrix technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hpmuseum.net/exhibit.php?class=4&cat=24|title=HP Computer Museum}}</ref>  Some plotters used roll-fed paper, and therefore had minimal restriction on the size of the output in one dimension. These plotters were capable of producing quite sizable drawings.

=== Other printers ===

A number of other sorts of printers are important for historical reasons, or for special purpose uses:

* [[Minilab|Digital minilab]] ([[photographic paper]])
* [[VT52|Electrolytic printers]]
* [[Spark printer]]
* Barcode printer multiple technologies, including: [[thermal printing]], [[inkjet printing]], and [[laser printing]] [[barcode]]s
* Billboard / sign paint spray printers
* Laser etching (product packaging) industrial printers
* Microsphere (special paper)

== Attributes ==

=== Printer control languages ===
Most printers other than line printers accept [[control character]]s or unique character sequences to control various printer functions.  These may range from shifting from lower to upper case or from black to red ribbon on typewriter printers to switching fonts and changing character sizes and colors on raster printers. Early printer controls were not standardized, with each manufacturer's equipment having its own set.  The IBM [[Personal Printer Data Stream]] (PPDS) became a commonly used command set for dot-matrix printers.

Today, most printers accept one or more [[page description language]]s (PDLs). Laser printers with greater processing power frequently offer support for variants of Hewlett-Packard's [[Printer Command Language]] (PCL), [[PostScript]] or [[XML Paper Specification]]. Most inkjet devices support manufacturer proprietary PDLs such as [[ESC/P]]. The diversity in mobile platforms have led to various standardization efforts around device PDLs such as the [[Printer Working Group]] (PWG's) [[PWG Raster]].

=== Printing speed ===

The speed of early printers was measured in units of ''characters per minute'' (cpm) for character printers, or ''lines per minute'' (lpm) for line printers. Modern printers are measured in ''pages per minute'' (ppm). These measures are used primarily as a marketing tool, and are not as well standardised as [[ISO/IEC 19752|toner yields]]. Usually pages per minute refers to sparse monochrome office documents, rather than dense pictures which usually print much more slowly, especially colour images. PPM are most of the time referring to [[ISO 216|A4 paper]] in Europe and [[letter (paper size)|letter]] paper in the United States, resulting in a 5-10% difference.

=== Sales ===

Since 2005, the world's top selling brand of [[inkjet]] and [[laser printer]]s has been [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], which now has 46% of sales in inkjet and 55.5% in laser printers.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://money.cnn.com/2009/02/27/news/companies/lashinsky_hurd.fortune/index.htm |title=Mark Hurd's moment |first=Adam |last=Lashinsky |date=March 3, 2009 |work=[[CNNMoney.com]]}}</ref>

=== Printing mode ===

The data received by a printer may be:

* [[plain text|A string of characters]]
* [[raster graphics|A bitmapped image]]
* [[vector graphics|A vector image]]
* A [[computer program]] written in a [[page description language]], such as [[page description language|PCL]] or [[PostScript]]

Some printers can process all four types of data, others not.

* Character printers, such as [[daisy wheel printer]]s, can handle only plain text data or rather simple point plots.
* Pen [[plotter]]s typically process [[vector image]]s. Inkjet based plotters can adequately reproduce all four.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}
* Modern printing technology, such as [[laser printer]]s and [[inkjet printer]]s, can adequately reproduce all four. This is especially true of printers equipped with support for PCL or PostScript, which includes the vast majority of printers produced today.

Today it is possible to print everything (even plain text) by sending ready bitmapped images to the printer. This allows better control over formatting, especially among machines from different vendors. Many [[printer driver]]s do not use the text mode at all, even if the printer is capable of it.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

=== Monochrome, colour and photo printers ===

A [[monochrome]] printer can only produce an [[image]] consisting of one [[colour]], usually black. A monochrome printer may also be able to produce various tones of that color, such as a [[grayscale|grey-scale]]. A colour printer can produce images of multiple colours. A photo printer is a colour printer that can produce images that mimic the [[gamut|colour range]] (gamut) and [[image resolution|resolution]] of prints made from [[photographic film]]. Many can be used on a standalone basis without a computer, using a [[memory card]] or [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] connector.

=== Page yield ===

The page yield is number of pages that can be printed from a [[toner cartridge]] or [[ink cartridge]]—before the cartridge needs to be refilled or replaced.
The actual number of pages yielded by a specific cartridge depends on a number of factors.<ref>
[http://static.highspeedbackbone.net/html/printeryieldguide.html "The Science Behind Page Counts, Cartridge Yields and The 5% Rule"].
</ref>

For a fair comparison, many laser printer manufacturers use the [[ISO/IEC 19752]] process to measure "the" toner cartridge yield.<ref name="measuring_yield">

quote: "Many original equipment manufacturers of printers and multifunction products (MFPs), including Lexmark, utilize the international industry standards for page yields (ISO/IEC 19752, 19798, and 24711)."
</ref>

=== Cost per page ===

In order to fairly compare operating expenses of printers with a relatively small [[ink cartridge]] to printers with a larger, more expensive [[toner cartridge]] that typically holds more toner and so prints more pages before the cartridge needs to be replaced, many people prefer to estimate operating expenses in terms of [[cost per page]] (CPP).<ref name="measuring_yield" /><ref name="officeworks" /><ref>

Often the [[freebie marketing|"razor and blades" business model]] is applied. That is, a company may sell a printer at cost, and make profits on the [[ink cartridge]], paper, or some other [[spare part|replacement part]]. This has caused legal disputes regarding the right of companies other than the printer manufacturer to sell [[computer compatibility|compatible]] ink cartridges. To protect their business model, several manufacturers invest heavily in developing new cartridge technology and patenting it.

Other manufacturers, in reaction to the challenges from using this business model, choose to make more money on printers and less on the ink, promoting the latter through their advertising campaigns. Finally, this generates two clearly different proposals: "cheap printer&nbsp;– expensive ink" or "expensive printer&nbsp;– cheap ink". Ultimately, the consumer decision depends on their reference [[interest rate]] or their [[time preference]]. From an [[economics]] viewpoint, there is a clear [[trade-off]] between cost per copy and cost of the printer.<ref>[http://www.officenet.com.ar/impresoras/ Cost per Page versus Printer cost in currently available printers<!-- could not find an English version, only Spanish or Portuguese http://www.officenet.com.br/impresoras/-->]</ref>

The dots are barely visible and contain encoded printer serial numbers, as well as date and time stamps.

=== Wireless printers ===
More than half of all printers sold at U.S. retail in 2010 were wireless-capable, but nearly three-quarters of consumers who have access to those printers weren't taking advantage of the increased access to print from multiple devices according to the new Wireless Printing Study.<ref>{{citation|title=Wireless Printers: A Technology That's Going to Waste?, |author=The [[NPD Group]] |url= https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/pr_101101a/}}</ref>
