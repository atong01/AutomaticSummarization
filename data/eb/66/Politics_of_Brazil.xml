The 1988 constitution allows states to keep their own taxes, set up<space/><link><target>State Senator (Brazil)</target><part>State Houses</part></link>, and mandates regular allocation of a share of the taxes collected locally by the federal government.</paragraph><paragraph>The Executive role is held by the<space/><italics>Governador</italics><space/>(Governor) and his appointed<space/><italics>Secretrios</italics><space/>(Secretaries); the Legislative role is held by the<space/><italics>Assemblia Legislativa</italics><space/>(Legislative Assembly); and the Judiciary role, by the<space/><italics>Tribunal de Justia</italics><space/>(Justice Tribunal). The governors and the members of the assemblies are elected, but the members of the Judiciary are appointed by the governor from a list provided by the current members of the State Law Court containing only judges (these are chosen by merit in exams open to anyone with a Law degree). The name chosen by the governor must be approved by the Assembly before inauguration. The 1988 Constitution has granted the states the greatest amount of autonomy since the Old Republic.</paragraph><paragraph>Each of the 26 state governors must achieve more than 50% of the vote, including a second round run-off between the top two candidates if necessary. In contrast to the federal level, state legislatures are unicameral, although the deputies are elected through similar means, involving an open-list system in which the state serves as one constituency. State level elections occur at the same time as those for the presidency and Congress. In 2002, candidates from eight different parties won the gubernatorial contest while 28 parties are represented in the country's state legislatures.

The only possible difference is regarding the municipalities that have a court of first instance and those that do not. The former are called<space/><italics>Sedes de Comarca</italics><space/>(seats of a<space/><italics>comarca</italics>, which is the territory under the rule of that court). Other than that, only size and importance differs one from another.</paragraph><paragraph>The municipality (<italics>municpio</italics>) is a territory comprising one urban area, the<space/><italics>sede</italics><space/>(seat), from which it takes the name, and several other minor urban or rural areas, the<space/><italics>distritos</italics><space/>(districts). The seat of a municipality must be the most populous urban area within it; when another urban area grows too much it usually splits from the original municipality to form another one.</paragraph><paragraph>A municipality is relatively autonomous: it enacts its own &quot;constitution&quot;, which is called<space/><italics>organic law</italics><space/>(<italics>Lei Orgnica</italics>), and it is allowed to collect taxes and fees, to maintain a municipal police force (albeit with very restricted powers), to pass laws on any matter that do not contradict either the state or the national constitutions, and to create symbols for itself (like a flag, an anthem and a coat-of-arms). However, not all municipalities exercise all of this autonomy. For instance, only a few municipalities keep local police forces, some of them do not collect some taxes (to attract investors or residents) and many of them do not have a flag (although they are all required to have a coat-of-arms).</paragraph><paragraph>Municipalities are governed by an elected<space/><italics>prefeito</italics><space/>(<link><target>Mayor</target></link>) and a unicameral<space/><italics>Cmara de Vereadores</italics><space/>(Councillors' Chamber).

The opposition candidate,<space/><link><target>Tancredo Neves</target></link>, was elected President, but died of natural causes before he was able to take office. Fearing a political vacuum that might stifle the democratic effort, Neves' supporters urged vice-president,<space/><link><target>Jos Sarney</target></link><space/>to take the oath and govern the country. Tancredo Neves had said that his election and the demise of military rgime would create a &quot;New Republic&quot; and Sarney's term of government is often referred to by this name.</paragraph><paragraph>Sarney's government was disastrous in almost every field. The ongoing<space/><link><target>recession</target></link><space/>and the soaring<space/><link><target>external debt</target></link><space/>drained the country's assets while ravaging<space/><link><target>inflation</target></link><space/>(which later turned into<space/><link><target>hyperinflation</target></link>) demonetized the currency and prevented any stability. In an attempt to revolutionize the economy and defeat inflation, Sarney carried on an ambitious &quot;heterodox&quot; economic plan (<link><target>Cruzado</target></link>) in 1986, which included price controls, default on the external debts and reduction of salaries. The plan seemed successful for some months, but it soon caused wholesale shortages of consumer goods (especially of easily exportable goods like meat, milk, automobiles, grains, sugar and alcohol) and the appearance of a black market in which such goods were sold for higher prices. Buoyed by the ensuing popularity from the apparent success of the plan, Sarney secured the hugest electoral win in Brazilian history; the party he had just joined,<space/><link><target>Brazilian Democratic Movement Party</target></link><space/>(PMDB), won in 26 out of 27 states and in more than 3,000 municipalities. Just after the elections, Sarney's &quot;corrections&quot; to the economy failed to control inflation and the public perception that he had used an artificial control of inflation to win the elections proved to be his undoing. His popularity never recovered and he was plagued by vehement criticism from most sectors of society until the end of his term. Despite popular rejection, Sarney managed to extend his term from four to five years, and exerted pressure on the Constitutional Assembly that was drafting the new constitution to abort the adoption of<space/><link><target>Parliamentarism</target></link>.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Collor government (19901992)</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Fernando Collor de Mello</arg></template>In 1989 Fernando Collor de Mello was elected president for the term from 19901994.

He had to face a country with hyper-inflation, high levels of misery and unemployment. Far-left organizations were trying to turn the anti-Collor campaign into a wider revolutionary fight to overthrow the regime. Itamar finally granted full powers to his Minister of Economy, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, so the minister could launch the<space/><link><target>Plano Real</target></link>, a new economic plan that seemed to be just the same as the many unsuccessful plans launched by Sarney, Collor and their military predecessor.
