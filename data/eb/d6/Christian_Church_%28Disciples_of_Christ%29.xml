This was even more formalized in 1919 with the establishment of the United Christian Missionary Society. Denominational structure of the Disciples of Christ was formed in 1968.

As the basic teachings of Jesus are studied and applied to life, there is the freedom to interpret Jesus' teaching in different ways.

It is not uncommon to find individuals who seemingly hold diametrically opposed beliefs within the same congregation affirming one another's journeys of faith as sisters and brothers in Christ.</paragraph><paragraph>Members and seekers are encouraged to take being disciples seriously, meaning that they are student followers of Jesus. Often the best teaching comes in the form, &quot;I'll tell you what I think, but read the Bible for yourself, and then study and pray about it. Decide in what ways God is calling you to be a follower of Jesus.&quot;</paragraph><paragraph>Modern Disciples reject the use of creeds as &quot;tests of faith,&quot; that is, as required beliefs, necessary to be accepted as a follower of Jesus. Although Disciples respect the great creeds of the church as informative affirmations of faith, they are never seen as binding. Since the adoption of The Design of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ),<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.disciples.org/AboutTheDisciples/TheDesignoftheChristianChurch/tabid/228/Default.aspx'>The Design of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)</link></extension><space/>in 1968, Disciples have celebrated a sense of unity in reading the preamble to the Design publicly. It is as a meaningful affirmation of faith, not binding upon any member. It was originally intended to remind readers that this Church seeks God through Jesus Christ, even when it adopts a design for its business affairs.</paragraph><paragraph><xhtml:center><paragraph><bold><italics>&quot;. . .the church of Christ upon earth is essentially, intentionally, and constitutionally one;<xhtml:br></xhtml:br>consisting of all those in every place that profess their faith in Christ<space/><xhtml:br></xhtml:br>and obedience to him in all things. . .&quot;</italics></bold></paragraph><paragraph><xhtml:small><xhtml:br></xhtml:br><link><target>Thomas Campbell (clergyman)</target><part>Thomas Campbell</part></link>&amp;nbsp; Proposition 1 of the<space/><link><target>Declaration and address</target></link></xhtml:small></paragraph></xhtml:center></paragraph><paragraph>The Disciples celebrate their oneness with all who seek God through Jesus Christ, throughout time and regardless of location.

Typically, these ministries have a scope that is larger than Regional Ministries, and often have a global perspective. The church agencies report to the General Assembly, which meets biennially in odd numbered years. The General Minister and President (GMP) is the designated leader for the General Church, but does not have the administrative authority to direct any of the general church agencies other than &quot;The Office of General Minister and President.&quot; The GMP has influence that derives from the respect of the church much as the pastor of a local church leads a local congregation.</paragraph><paragraph>The General Ministries are:<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="title">General Ministries Directory</arg><arg name="url">http://www.disciples.org/GeneralMinistries/GeneralMinistryDirectory/tabid/83/Default.aspx</arg><arg name="work">Disciples.org website</arg><arg name="accessdate">11 December 2011</arg></template></extension></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>Office of the General Minister and President</listitem><listitem>Christian Board of Publication/Chalice Press</listitem><listitem>Christian Church Foundation</listitem><listitem>Church Extension</listitem><listitem>Council on Christian Unity</listitem><listitem><link><target>Disciples of Christ Historical Society</target></link></listitem><listitem>Disciples Home Missions</listitem><listitem>Division of Overseas Ministries/Global Ministries</listitem><listitem>Higher Education and Leadership Ministries</listitem><listitem>National Benevolent Association</listitem><listitem>Pension Fund</listitem></list><paragraph>One highly popular and respected General Agency program is the &quot;Week of Compassion,&quot; named for the special offering to fund the program when it began in the 1950s.
