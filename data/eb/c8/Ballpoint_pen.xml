In these inventions, the ink was placed in a thin tube whose end was blocked by a tiny ball, held so that it could not slip into the tube or fall out of the pen. The ink clung to the ball, which spun as the pen was drawn across the paper, therefore giving areas of the ball with its ink removed another coating.</paragraph><paragraph>The first<space/><link><target>patent</target></link><space/>for a ballpoint pen<extension extension_name='ref'>Collingridge, M.

Refills allow for the entire internal ink reservoir, including a ballpoint and socket, to be replaced. Such characteristics are usually associated with designer-type pens or those constructed of finer materials. The simplest types of ballpoint pens are disposable and have a cap to cover the tip when the pen is not in use, or a mechanism for retracting the tip,<extension extension_name='ref' name="bpp encyc"></extension><space/>which varies between manufacturers but is usually a spring- or screw-mechanism.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Rollerball pen</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>employ the same ballpoint mechanics, but with the use of water-based inks instead of oil-based inks. Compared to oil-based ballpoints, rollerball pens are said to provide more fluid ink-flow, but the water-based inks will blot if held stationary against the writing surface.
