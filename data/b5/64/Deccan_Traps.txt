The '''Deccan Traps''' are a [[large igneous province]] located on the [[Deccan Plateau]] of west-central [[India]] (between 17°–24°N, 73°–74°E) and one of the largest [[volcanic]] features on Earth. They consist of multiple layers of solidified [[flood basalt]] that together are more than 2,000&nbsp;m (6,562&nbsp;ft) thick and cover an area of 500,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (193,051&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) and a volume of 512,000&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> (123,000&nbsp;cu&nbsp;mi).

==Etymology==
The term "[[Trap rock|trap]]" has been used in [[geology]] since 1785–95 for such [[rock formation]]s. It is derived from the Swedish word for stairs ("trapp") and refers to the step-like hills forming the landscape of the region.<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/trap Trap] at dictionary.reference.com</ref>

==History==
The Deccan Traps began forming 66.250 [[geologic timescale|million years ago]],<ref>"[https://newsoffice.mit.edu/2014/volcanic-eruption-dinosaur-extinction-1211 What really killed the dinosaurs? Before an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs, Earth experienced a short burst of intense volcanism." Jennifer Chu | "MIT News Office," December 11, 2014]
</ref> at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period. The bulk of the volcanic eruption occurred at the [[Western Ghats]] (near [[Mumbai]]) some 66&nbsp;million years ago. This series of eruptions may have lasted less than 30,000&nbsp;years in total.<ref>"[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/08/050810130729.htm India's Smoking Gun: Dino-killing Eruptions]." ''ScienceDaily,'' 10 August 2005.</ref>

The original area covered by the [[lava flow]]s is estimated to have been as large as 1.5&nbsp;million km², approximately half the size of modern [[India]]. The Deccan Traps region was reduced to its current size by [[erosion]] and plate tectonics; the present area of directly observable lava flows is around {{convert|512000|km²|0|abbr=on}}.

==Effect on climate and contemporary life==
The release of [[volcanic gas]]es, particularly [[sulfur dioxide]], during the formation of the traps contributed to contemporary [[climate change]]. Data points to an average drop in temperature of 2&nbsp;°C in this period.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Royer, D. L., Berner, R. A., Montañez, I. P., Tabor, N. J., [[Beerling, D. J.]]|year=2004| title=CO<sub>2</sub> as a primary driver of Phanerozoic climate|journal=GSA Today|volume=14|issue=3|pages=4–10|issn=1052-5173|url=http://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/14/3/pdf/i1052-5173-14-3-4.pdf|doi=10.1130/1052-5173(2004)014<4:CAAPDO>2.0.CO;2}}</ref>

Because of its magnitude, scientists formerly speculated that the gases released during the formation of the Deccan Traps played a role in the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] (also known as the K–Pg extinction), which included the [[extinction]] of the non-avian [[dinosaur]]s. Sudden cooling due to sulfurous volcanic gases released by the formation of the traps and localised gas concentrations may have contributed significantly to mass extinctions. However, the current consensus among the scientific community is that the extinction was triggered by the [[Chicxulub crater|Chicxulub impact event]] in Central America (which would have produced a sunlight-blocking dust cloud that killed much of the plant life and reduced global temperature, called an [[impact winter]]).<ref name="science">{{cite journal|last=Schulte|first=Peter|date=5 March 2010|title=The Chicxulub Asteroid Impact and Mass Extinction at the Cretaceous-Paleogene Boundary|journal=Science|publisher=AAAS|volume=327|issue=5970|pages=1214–1218|issn=1095-9203 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/327/5970/1214|accessdate=5 March 2010|doi=10.1126/science.1177265|pmid=20203042|bibcode=2010Sci...327.1214S|display-authors=etal}}</ref> 

Work published in 2014 by geologist [[Gerta Keller]] and others on the timing of the Deccan volcanism suggests the extinction may have been caused by both the volcanism and the impact event.<ref>Keller, G., ''Deccan volcanism, the Chicxulub impact, and the end-Cretaceous mass extinction: Coincidence?

==Chemical composition==
Within the Deccan Traps at least 95% of the lavas are [[tholeiitic basalt]]s, however other rock types do occur:

* [[Alkali basalt]]s
* [[Nephelinite]]s
* [[Lamprophyre]]
* [[Carbonatite]]s

Mantle [[xenolith]]s have been described from [[Kachchh]] (northwestern India) and elsewhere in the western Deccan.

== Fossils==
The Deccan Traps are famous for the beds of fossils that have been found between layers of lava. Particularly well known species include the frog ''Oxyglossus pusillus'' (Owen) of the [[Eocene]] of [[India]] and the toothed frog ''Indobatrachus'', an early lineage of modern frogs, which is now placed in the Australian family Myobatrachidae.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Noble | first1 = Gladwyn Kingsley | authorlink = Gladwyn Kingsley Noble | year = | title = The Fossil Frogs of the Intertrappean Beds of Bombay, India | url = http://hdl.handle.net/2246/3061 | journal = American Museum of Natural History | volume = 401 | issue = | page = 1930 }}</ref><ref>http://tolweb.org/Myobatrachinae/16946</ref>  The infratrappean and intertrappean beds also contain fossil freshwater mollusks.<ref>Hartman, J.H., Mohabey, D.M., Bingle, M., Scholz, H., Bajpai, S., and Sharma, R., 2006, Initial survivorship of nonmarine molluscan faunas in end-Cretaceous Deccan intertrappean strata, India: Geological Society of America (annual meeting, Philadelphia) Abstracts with Programs, v. 38, no. 7, p. 143.</ref>

== Theories of formation ==
It is postulated that the Deccan Traps eruption was associated with a deep [[mantle plume]]. The area of long-term eruption (the [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]]), known as the [[Réunion hotspot]], is suspected of both causing the Deccan Traps eruption and opening the [[rift]] that once separated the [[Mascarene Plateau|Seychelles plateau]] from India. [[Seafloor spreading]] at the boundary between the Indian and [[African Plate]]s subsequently pushed India north over the plume, which now lies under [[Réunion]] island in the [[Indian Ocean]], southwest of India.  The mantle plume model has, however, been challenged.<ref name="mantleplumes">Sheth, Hetu C. "[http://www.mantleplumes.org/Deccan.html The Deccan Beyond the Plume Hypothesis]." ''MantlePlumes.org,'' 2006.</ref>

Data continues to emerge which supports the plume model. The motion of the Indian tectonic plate and the eruptive history of the Deccan traps show strong correlations. Based on data from marine magnetic profiles, a pulse of unusually rapid plate motion begins at the same time as the first pulse of Deccan flood basalts, which is dated at 67 million years ago. The spreading rate rapidly increased and reached a maximum at the same time as the peak basaltic eruptions.  The spreading rate then dropped off, with the decrease occurring around 63 million years ago, by which time the main phase of Deccan volcanism ended. This correlation is seen as driven by plume dynamics.<ref name=Cande>S.C. Cande & D.R. Stegman;  Indian and African plate motions driven by the push force of the Réunion plume head; Nature; Volume 475; pp. 47–52; (7 July 2011) {{doi|10.1038/nature10174}}</ref>

The Indian and African plates' motions have also been shown to be coupled, with the common element being the position of these plates relative to the location of the Réunion plume head. The onset of accelerated motion of India coincides with a large slowing of the rate of counterclockwise rotation of Africa. The close correlations between the plate motions suggest that they were both driven by the force of the Réunion plume.<ref name=Cande/>

There is some evidence to link the Deccan Traps eruption to the asteroid impact which created the Chicxulub crater in the Mexican state of Yucatan. The combination of the asteroid impact and the resulting eruption may have been responsible for the mass extinctions that occurred at the time that separates the Cretaceous and [[Paleogene]] periods, known as the [[K–Pg boundary]]. <ref>http://www.sciencenewsline.com/articles/2015050109530049.html</ref>

==Suggested link to Shiva Crater ==
A geological structure exists in the sea floor off the west coast of India that has been suggested as a possible impact crater, in this context called the [[Shiva crater]].  It has also been dated at approximately 66&nbsp;million years ago, potentially matching the Deccan traps. The researchers claiming that this feature is an impact crater suggest that the impact may have been the triggering event for the Deccan Traps as well as contributing to the acceleration of the Indian plate in the early [[Paleogene]].<ref>[[Sankar Chatterjee|Chatterjee, Sankar]].

Paper No. 60-8, Seattle Annual Meeting, November 2003.</ref> However, the current consensus in the Earth science community is that this feature is unlikely to be an actual impact crater.<ref name="Leslie2008a">{{cite web|author=Mullen, Leslie|date=2 November 2004|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/deepimpact-04r.html|title=Shiva: Another K-Pg Impact?|work=Spacedaily.com|accessdate=20 February 2008}} - original article at [http://www.astrobio.net/news/article1281.html source]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/091018-dinosaur-crater.html |title=New Dino-destroying Theory Fuels Hot Debate |first=Clara |last=Moskowitz |publisher=space.com |date=18 October 2009 }}</ref>
