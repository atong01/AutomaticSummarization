When the Soviet passed a resolution prohibiting its leaders from joining the government, Kerensky delivered a stirring speech at a Soviet meeting.

On 10 May (<link><target>Julian calendar</target></link>), Kerensky started for the front, and visited one division after another, urging the men to do their duty. His speeches were impressive and convincing for the moment, but had little lasting effect. Under Allied pressure to continue the war, he launched what became known as the<space/><link><target>Kerensky Offensive</target></link><space/>against the Austro-Hungarian/German South Army on 17 June (<link><target>Julian calendar</target></link>). At first successful, the offensive was soon stopped and then thrown back by a strong counter-attack. The Russian army suffered heavy losses and it was clear from the many incidents of desertion, sabotage, and mutiny that the army was no longer willing to attack.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:KresnkiEnUnDiscursoALosSoldadosDelFrenteMayo1917.png</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>Kerensky in May 1917</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>Kerensky was heavily criticised by the military for his liberal policies, which included stripping officers of their mandates (handing over-riding control to revolutionary inclined &quot;soldier committees&quot; instead), the abolition of the death penalty, and allowing various revolutionary agitators to be present at the front. Many officers jokingly referred to commander in chief Kerensky as &quot;persuader in chief&quot; (another possible translation of this joking expression from Russian into English &quot;commander in cheer&quot;).</paragraph><paragraph>On 2 July 1917, the first coalition collapsed over the question of<space/><link><target>Ukraine</target></link>'s autonomy.

Russia's continued involvement in the world war was not popular among the lower and middle classes and especially the soldiers. They had all believed that Russia would stop fighting when the Provisional Government took power, and now they felt deceived. Furthermore,<space/><link><target>Vladimir Lenin</target></link><space/>and his<space/><link><target>Bolshevik</target></link><space/>party were promising &quot;peace, land, and bread&quot; under a communist system. The army was disintegrating owing to a lack of discipline, leading to desertion in large numbers. By autumn 1917, an estimated two million men had unofficially left the army.</paragraph><paragraph>Kerensky and the other political leaders continued their obligation to Russia's allies by continuing involvement in World War I, fearing that the economy, already under huge stress from the war effort, might become increasingly unstable if vital supplies from France and the United Kingdom were cut off. The dilemma of whether to withdraw was a great one, and Kerensky's inconsistent and impractical policies further destabilised the army and the country at large.</paragraph><paragraph>Furthermore, Kerensky adopted a policy that isolated the right-wing conservatives, both democratic and monarchist-oriented. His philosophy of &quot;no enemies to the left&quot; greatly empowered the Bolsheviks and gave them a free hand, allowing them to take over the military arm or &quot;voyenka&quot; of the Petrograd and Moscow Soviets. His arrest of<space/><link><target>Lavr Kornilov</target><part>Kornilov</part></link><space/>and other officers left him without strong allies against the Bolsheviks, who ended up being Kerensky's strongest and most determined adversaries, as opposed to the right wing, which evolved into the<space/><link><target>White movement</target></link>.</paragraph><heading level='2'>October Revolution of 1917</heading><paragraph>During the<space/><link><target>Kornilov Affair</target></link>, Kerensky had distributed arms to the<space/><link><target>Petrograd</target></link><space/>workers, and by November most of these armed workers had gone over to the Bolsheviks.
