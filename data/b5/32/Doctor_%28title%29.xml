In recent times, other surgically orientated specialists, such as<space/><link><target>gynaecologist</target><trail>s</trail></link>, have also adopted these prefixes. A surgeon who is also a professor is usually known as &quot;Professor&quot; and, similarly, a surgeon who has been ennobled, knighted, created a baronet or appointed a dame uses the corresponding title (Lord, Sir, Dame).<space/><link><target>Physician</target><trail>s</trail></link>, on the other hand, when they pass their &quot;<link><target>Membership of the Royal College of Physicians</target><part>MRCP</part></link>&quot; examinations, which enable them to become members of the<space/><link><target>Royal College of Physicians</target></link>, do not drop the &quot;Doctor&quot; prefix and remain Doctor, even when they are consultants. In the United Kingdom the status and rank of consultant surgeons with the FRCS, addressed as &quot;Mister&quot;, and consultant physicians with the MRCP, addressed as &quot;Doctor&quot;, is equivalent.

The LL.D. is a doctorate-level academic degree in law requiring at least three years of post-graduate full-time study at the University of Malta, Malta's national university. At least three years of previous law study are required for entry. Students are required to complete coursework in a number of core areas of law, as well as to submit a thesis which is to be &quot;an original work on the approved subject or other contribution to the knowledge showing that he/she has carried out sufficient research therein&quot;. It confers the title of Doctor, which in Malta is rigorously used to address a holder of the degree. The LL.D. is one of the requirements for admission to the profession of advocate in Malta (an advocate, as opposed to a legal procurator, has rights of representation in superior courts).</paragraph><paragraph>Notable holders of the LL.D. degree include Dr.<space/><link><target>Ugo Mifsud Bonnici</target></link><space/>(former President of Malta), the late Prof.<space/><link><target>Guido de Marco</target></link><space/>(former President of the United Nations General Assembly and former President of Malta), the late Dr.<space/><link><target>George Borg Olivier</target></link><space/>(first post-independence Prime Minister of Malta), and Dr.<space/><link><target>Lawrence Gonzi</target></link><space/>(former Prime Minister of Malta).</paragraph><heading level='4'>The Netherlands</heading><paragraph>In the<space/><link><target>Dutch language</target></link><space/>the word &quot;dokter&quot; refers to a physician, whereas &quot;doctor&quot; refers to the academic title. The doctor title is abbreviated as dr. placed before the holders name (note the lowercase).</paragraph><paragraph>To enter a Dutch doctoral defense, the candidate must hold a validated master's degree (a master's degree of an acknowledged university, or a master equivalent degree validated on a case by case basis by the Dutch government). In some cases the candidate can be granted special dispensation if no master's degree is held.There is no specific notation of the discipline in which the doctorate is obtained. Exceptions only exist for the disciplines with specific master titles of engineering &quot;ir.&quot; (&quot;ingenieur&quot;, i.e. Engineer) and law &quot;mr.&quot; (&quot;meester, i.e. Master of Law) where the title dr. is added to the original master title. For these disciplines, the original master's degree abbreviation is combined with the dr. abbreviation thus resulting in for example &quot;dr. ir. Familyman&quot;. The dr. title is always placed in front of the ir. title. In the case of a PhD in law, the original mr. title is placed before the dr. title (mr. dr. see e.g.<space/><link><target>Jan Peter Balkenende</target></link>), for a person having a law master's degree, but holding a PhD in another field than law the mr. title is placed after the dr. titel (dr. mr.). No specific notation or title for the medical disciplines exists in the Netherlands. Although a physician is usually referred to as &quot;dokter&quot; (note the spelling difference) this does not necessarily imply the physician holds a doctoral degree; nor does it give the physician an title equivalent to that of PhD.</paragraph><paragraph>Confusion can be caused by the original Dutch Master level title &quot;drs.&quot; (for all non-engineering and non-law master's degrees). This abbreviation stands for the Dutch title<space/><link><target>doctorandus</target></link><space/>Latin for &quot;he who should become a doctor&quot; (female form is &quot;doctoranda&quot;). Dutch drs. should not be confused with the plural 'doctorates': having a PhD in multiple disciplines. Once a doctorate is achieved the doctorandus is promoted to doctor, and no longer uses the drs. abbreviation.<xhtml:br></xhtml:br>Stacking of multiples titles of the same level, as seen in countries like for example Germany (Dr. Dr. Dr. Musterfrau) is highly uncommon in the Netherlands (although stacking of titles with different levels is common: prof. dr. ir. Appelmans). Those who have multiple doctor titles may use dr.mult. before their name, although this is rarely used.</paragraph><paragraph>After obtaining a doctorate successfully, Dutch doctors may bear either the title dr. (lower case) before, or the letter D (rarely in practice) behind their name, but not both simultaneously. In the Netherlands, Academic titles are used exclusively within academia. Holding a PhD title has become a standard requirement for a university career. The doctor title has little to no meaning or implications for public life outside academia. It cannot be added to documentation (e.g. passport, drivers licence), and is used infrequently in daily practice.</paragraph><paragraph>Historically, The Netherlands used their own academic degree nomenclature, but for many years now have recognised and implemented the<space/><link><target>Bologna declaration</target></link>. In everyday practice, the Anglo Saxon titles (e.g. PhD) are frequently used. Dutch academic titles are legally protected. PhD degrees can only be granted by recognised (research) universities.
