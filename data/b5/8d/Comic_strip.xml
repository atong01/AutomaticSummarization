Daily strips usually are printed in black and white, and Sunday strips are usually in color. However, a few newspapers have published daily strips in color, and some newspapers have published Sunday strips in black and white. The two conventional formats for newspaper comics are strips and single gag panels. The strips are usually displayed horizontally, wider than they are tall. Single panels are square, circular or taller than they are wide. Strips usually, but not always, are broken up into several smaller panels with continuity from panel to panel. A horizontal strip can also be used for a single panel with a single gag, as seen occasionally in<space/><link><target>Mike Peters (cartoonist)</target><part>Mike Peters</part></link>'<space/><italics><link><target>Mother Goose and Grimm</target></link></italics>.</paragraph><paragraph>During the 1930s, the original art for a daily strip could be drawn as large as 25&amp;nbsp;inches wide by six inches high.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/5761968'>Live Auctioneers, ''Etta Kett'', January 2, 1933.</link></extension><space/>As strips have become smaller, the number of panels have been reduced.<space/></paragraph><paragraph>The popularity and accessibility of strips meant they were often clipped and saved; authors including<space/><link><target>John Updike</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Ray Bradbury</target></link><space/>have written about their childhood collections of clipped strips.

At a time when comic books were coming under fire for supposed sexual, violent, and subversive content, Kelly feared the same would happen to comic strips.

Hearst's critics often assumed that all the strips in his papers were fronts for his own political and social views. Hearst did occasionally work with or pitch ideas to cartoonists, most notably his continued support of<space/><link><target>George Herriman</target></link>'s<space/><italics><link><target>Krazy Kat</target></link></italics>.

One particularly humorous example of such promotional efforts is the<space/><link><target>Comic strip switcheroo</target><part>Great Comic Strip Switcheroonie</part></link>, held in 1997 on April Fool's Day, an event in which dozens of prominent artists took over each other's strips.<space/><italics>Garfield</italics>s Jim Davis, for example, switched with<space/><italics><link><target>Blondie (comic strip)</target><part>Blondie</part></link></italics>s Stan Drake, while Scott Adams (<italics>Dilbert</italics>) traded strips with Bil Keane (<italics><link><target>The Family Circus</target></link></italics>). Even the United States Postal Service got into the act, issuing a series of commemorative stamps marking the comic-strip centennial in 1996.</paragraph><paragraph>While the Switcheroonie was a one-time publicity stunt, for one artist to take over a feature from its originator is an old tradition in newspaper cartooning (as it is in the comic book industry). In fact, the practice has made possible the longevity of the genre's more popular strips.

Daily strips have suffered as well, in 1910 the strips had an unlimited amount of panels, covering the entire width page, while by 1930 most &quot;dailies&quot; had four or five panels covering six of the eight columns occupied by a traditional broadsheet paper, by 1958 those four panels would be narrower, and those would have half of the space a 1910 daily strip had, and by 1998 most strips would have three panels only (with a few exceptions), or even two or one on an occasional basis, apart from strips being smaller, as most papers became slightly narrower. While most cartoonist decided to follow the tide, some cartoonists have complained about this, with<space/><italics><link><target>Pogo (comic strip)</target><part>Pogo</part></link></italics><space/>ending in 1975 as a form of protest from its creators against the practice.

Between the 1960s and the late 1980s, as<space/><link><target>television news</target></link><space/>relegated newspaper reading to an occasional basis rather than daily, syndicators were abandoning long stories and urging cartoonists to switch to simple daily gags, or week-long &quot;storylines&quot; (with six consecutive (mostly unrelated) strips following a same subject), with longer storylines being used mainly on adventure-based and dramatic strips. Strips begun during the mid-1980s or after (such as<space/><italics><link><target>Get Fuzzy</target></link></italics>,<space/><italics><link><target>Over the Hedge</target></link></italics>,<space/><italics><link><target>Monty (comic strip)</target><part>Monty</part></link></italics>, and others) are known for their heavy use of storylines, lasting between one and three weeks in most cases.</paragraph><paragraph>The writing style of comic strips changed as well after World War II.

Stephan Pastis has lamented that the &quot;unwritten&quot; censorship code is still &quot;stuck somewhere in the 1950s.&quot; Generally, comics are not allowed to include such words as &quot;damn&quot;, &quot;sucks&quot;, &quot;screwed&quot;, and &quot;hell&quot;, although there have been exceptions such as the September 22, 2010<space/><italics><link><target>Mother Goose and Grimm</target></link></italics><space/>in which an elderly man says, &quot;This nursing home food sucks,&quot; and a pair of<space/><italics>Pearls Before Swine</italics><space/>comics from January 11, 2011 with a character named Ned using the word &quot;crappy&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.grimmy.com/comics.php<space/></arg><arg name="title">Mother Goose and Grimm/Mike Peters Website<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Grimmy.com<space/></arg><arg name="date">1994-01-01<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2012-12-27</arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://comics.com/pearls_before_swine/2011-01-10/<space/></arg><arg name="title">Pearls Before Swine Comic Strip, January 10, 2011 on GoComics.com<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Comics.com<space/></arg><arg name="date">2011-01-10<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2012-12-27</arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://comics.com/pearls_before_swine/2011-01-11/<space/></arg><arg name="title">Pearls Before Swine Comic Strip, January 11, 2011 on GoComics.com<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Comics.com<space/></arg><arg name="date">2011-01-11<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2012-12-27</arg></template></extension><space/>Naked backsides and shooting guns cannot be shown, according to<space/><italics><link><target>Dilbert</target></link></italics><space/>cartoonist<space/><link><target>Scott Adams</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="authorlink">Scott Adams<space/></arg><arg name="last">Adams<space/></arg><arg name="first">Scott<space/></arg><arg name="title">Stick to Drawing Comics, Monkey Brain!: Cartoonist Ignores Helpful Advice<space/></arg><arg name="year">2007<space/></arg><arg name="isbn">978-1-59184-185-2</arg></template></extension><space/>Such comic strip taboos were detailed in<space/><link><target>Dave Breger</target></link>'s book<space/><italics>But That's Unprintable</italics><space/>(Bantam, 1955).<space/></paragraph><paragraph>Many issues such as<space/><link><target>sex</target></link>,<space/><link><target>narcotics</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>terrorism</target></link><space/>cannot or can very rarely be openly discussed in strips, although there are exceptions, usually for<space/><link><target>satire</target></link>, as in<space/><italics>Bloom County</italics>.

Young cartoonists have claimed commonplace words, images, and issues should be allowed in the comics. Some of the taboo words and topics are mentioned daily on television and other forms of visual media.
