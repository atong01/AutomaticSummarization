Individuals create meaning for themselves or make sense of new information by selecting, organizing, and integrating information with other knowledge, often in the context of social interactions. Constructivism can occur in two ways: individual and social. Individual constructivism is when a person constructs knowledge through cognitive processes of their own experiences rather than by memorizing facts provided by others. Social constructivism is when individuals construct knowledge through an interaction between the knowledge they bring to a situation and social or cultural exchanges within that content.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Edpsych2"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Jean Piaget, a Swiss developmental psychologist, proposed that learning is an active process because children learn through experience and make mistakes and solve problems.

Microsystem is the direct environment in our lives such as our home and school. Mesosystem is how relationships connect to the microsystem.

The mesosystem is the combination of two microsystems and how they influence each other (example: sibling relationships at home vs. peer relationships at school). The exosystem is the interaction among two or more settings that are indirectly linked (example: a father's job requiring more overtime ends up influencing his daughter's performance in school because he can no longer help with her homework). The macrosystem is broader taking into account social economic status, culture, beliefs, customs and morals (example: a child from a wealthier family sees a peer from a less wealthy family as inferior for that reason). Lastly, the chronosystem refers to the chronological nature of life events and how they interact and change the individual and their circumstances through transition (example: a mother losing her own mother to illness and no longer having that support in her life).<extension extension_name='ref' name="Edpsych2"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last">Reese-Weber</arg><arg name="first">Lisa Bohlin, Cheryl Cisero Durwin, Marla</arg><arg name="title">Edpsych : modules</arg><arg name="publisher">McGraw-Hill Humanities/Social Sciences/Languages</arg><arg name="location">New York</arg><arg name="isbn">9780078097867</arg><arg name="pages">30â€“132</arg><arg name="edition">2nd</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Since its publication in 1979, Bronfenbrenner's major statement of this theory,<space/><italics>The Ecology of Human Development</italics><extension extension_name='ref'>Bronfenbrenner, U.

Stage is the order hierarchical complexity of the tasks the participant's successfully addresses. He expanded Piaget's original eight stage (counting the half stages) to fifteen stages.
