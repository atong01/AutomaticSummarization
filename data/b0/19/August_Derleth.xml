He is a champion and a justification of regionalism. Yet he is also a burly, bounding, bustling, self-confident, opinionated, and highly-sweatered young man with faults so grievous that a melancholoy perusal of them may be of more value to apprentices than a study of his serious virtues. If he could ever be persuaded that he isn't half as good as he thinks he is, if he would learn the art of sitting still and using a blue pencil, he might become twice as good as he thinks he iswhich would about rank him with Homer.&quot; Derleth good humoredly reprinted the criticism along with a photograph of himself sans sweater, on the back cover of his 1948 country journal:<space/><italics>Village Daybook</italics>.</paragraph><paragraph>A lighter side to the<space/><italics>Sac Prairie Saga</italics><space/>is a series of quasi-autobiographical short stories known as the &quot;Gus Elker Stories,&quot; amusing tales of country life that<space/><link><target>Peter Ruber</target></link>, Derleth's last editor, said were &quot;...models of construction and...fused with some of the most memorable characters in American literature.&quot; Most were written between 1934 and the late 1940s, though the last, &quot;Tail of the Dog&quot;, was published in 1959 and won the<space/><italics>Scholastic Magazine</italics><space/>short story award for the year.

Most notable among this work was a series of 70 stories in affectionate pastiche of<space/><link><target>Sherlock Holmes</target></link>, whose creator, Sir<space/><link><target>Arthur Conan Doyle</target></link>, he admired greatly. These included one published novel as well (<italics>Mr. Fairlie's Final Journey</italics>). The series features a (Sherlock Holmes-styled) British detective named<space/><link><target>Solar Pons</target></link>, of<space/><link><target>Praed Street</target></link><space/>in London.

Though Derleth never wrote a Pons novel to equal<space/><italics>The Hound of the Baskervilles</italics>, editor Peter Ruber wrote: &quot;...Derleth produced more than a few Solar Pons stories almost as good as Sir Arthur's, and many that had better plot construction.&quot;</paragraph><paragraph>Although these stories were a form of diversion for Derleth, Ruber, who edited<space/><italics><link><target>The Original Text Solar Pons Omnibus Edition</target></link></italics><space/>(2000), argued: &quot;Because the stories were generally of such high quality, they ought to be assessed on their own merits as a unique contribution in the annals of mystery ficton, rather than suffering comparison as one of the endless imitators of Sherlock Holmes.&quot;</paragraph><paragraph>Some of the stories were self-published, through a new imprint called &quot;<link><target>Mycroft &amp; Moran</target></link>&quot;, an appellation of humorous significance to Holmesian scholars.

Arguably most important among his works for younger readers, however, is the<space/><italics>Steve and Sim Mystery Series</italics>. The ten-volume series is set in Sac Prairie of the 1920s and can thus be considered in its own right a part of the<space/><italics>Sac Prairie Saga</italics>, as well as an extension of Derleth's body of mystery fiction. Robert Hood, writing in the<space/><italics>New York Times</italics><space/>said: &quot;Steve and Sim, the major characters, are twentieth-century cousins of Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer; Derleth's minor characters, little gems of comic drawing.&quot; The first novel in the series,<space/><italics>The Moon Tenders</italics>, does, in fact, involve a rafting adventure down the<space/><link><target>Wisconsin River</target></link>, which led regional writer<space/><link><target>Jesse Stuart</target></link><space/>to suggest the novel was one that &quot;older people might read to recapture the spirit and dream of youth.&quot; The connection to the<space/><italics>Sac Prairie Saga</italics><space/>was noted by the<space/><italics><link><target>Chicago Tribune</target></link></italics>: &quot;Once again a small midwest community in 1920s is depicted with perception, skill, and dry humor.&quot;</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Weird Tales September 1941.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>Derleth's first Mythos story, &quot;Beyond the Threshold&quot; was featured on the cover of ''Weird Tales'' in September 1941</part></link></paragraph><heading level='3'>Arkham House and the &quot;Cthulhu Mythos&quot;</heading><paragraph>Derleth was a correspondent and friend of<space/><link><target>H.

However<space/><link><target>Robert M. Price</target></link><space/>points out that while Derleth's tales are distinct from Lovecraft's in their use of hope and his depiction of a struggle between good and evil, nevertheless the basis of Derlerth's systemization are found in Lovecraft. He also suggests that the differences can be over stated:<extension extension_name='blockquote'>Derleth<space/><italics>was</italics><space/>more optimistic than Lovecraft in his conception of the Mythos, but we are dealing with a difference more of degree than kind. There are indeed tales wherein Derleth's protagonists get off scot-free (like &quot;The Shadow in the Attic&quot;, &quot;Witches' Hollow&quot;, or &quot;The Shuttered Room&quot;), but often the hero is doomed (e.g., &quot;The House in the Valley&quot;, &quot;The Peabody Heritage&quot;, &quot;Something in Wood&quot;), as in Lovecraft. And it must be remembered that an occasional Lovecraftian hero does manage to overcome the odds, e.g., in &quot;The Horror in the Museum&quot;, &quot;The Shunned House&quot;, and 'The Case of Charles Dexter Ward'.<space/><extension extension_name='ref'>http://crypt-of-cthulhu.com/lovecraftderleth.htm</extension></extension>Derleth also treated Lovecraft's<space/><link><target>Old Ones</target></link><space/>as representatives of elemental forces, creating new fictional entities to flesh out this framework.</paragraph><paragraph>Such debates aside, Derleth's founding of Arkham House and his successful effort to rescue Lovecraft from literary obscurity are widely acknowledged by practitioners in the horror field as seminal events in the field.

Lovecraft from literary obscurity at the time of Lovecraft's death, Derleth also built a body of horror and spectral fiction of his own; still frequently anthologized. The best of this work, recently reprinted in four volumes of short storiesmost of which were originally published in<space/><italics>Weird Tales</italics>, illustrates Derleth's original abilities in the genre. While Derleth considered his work in this genre less important than his most serious literary efforts, the compilers of these four anthologies, including Ramsey Campbell, note that the stories still resonate after more than fifty years.</paragraph><paragraph>In 2009,<space/><link><target>The Library of America</target></link><space/>selected Derleths story<space/><italics>The Panelled Room</italics><space/>for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American Fantastic Tales.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Other works</heading><paragraph>Derleth also wrote many historical novels, as part of both the<space/><italics>Sac Prairie Saga</italics><space/>and the<space/><italics>Wisconsin Saga</italics>.

The work was one in a series entitled &quot;The Rivers of America&quot;, conceived by writer Constance Lindsay Skinner in the<space/><link><target>Great Depression</target></link><space/>as a series that would connect Americans to their heritage through the history of the great rivers of the nation. Skinner wanted the series to be written by artists, not academicians. Derleth, while not a trained historian, was, according to former Wisconsin state historian William F. Thompson, &quot;...a very competent regional historian who based his historical writing upon research in the primary documents and who regularly sought the help of professionals... .&quot; In the foreword to the 1985 reissue of the work by<space/><link><target>The University of Wisconsin Press</target></link>, Thompson concluded: &quot;No other writer, of whatever background or training, knew and understood his particular 'corner of the earth' better than August Derleth.&quot;</paragraph><paragraph>Derleth wrote several volumes of poems, as well as biographies of<space/><link><target>Zona Gale</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Ralph Waldo Emerson</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Henry David Thoreau</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>He also wrote introductions to several collections of classic early 20th century comics, such as<space/><italics><link><target>Buster Brown</target></link></italics>,<space/><italics><link><target>Little Nemo in Slumberland</target></link></italics>, and<space/><italics><link><target>Katzenjammer Kids</target></link></italics>, as well as a book of children's poetry entitled<space/><italics>A Boy's Way</italics>, and the foreword to<space/><italics><link><target>Tales from an Indian Lodge</target></link></italics><space/>by<space/><italics><link><target>Phebe Jewell Nichols</target></link>.</italics><space/>Derleth also wrote under the<space/><link><target>nom de plume</target><part>noms de plume</part></link><space/>Stephen Grendon, Kenyon Holmes and Tally Mason.</paragraph><paragraph>Derleth's papers and comic book collection (valued at a considerable sum upon his death) were donated to the<space/><link><target>Wisconsin Historical Society</target></link><space/>in Madison.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;amp;term_id=9140&amp;amp;search_term=derleth'>Derleth, August, 19091971</link></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Bibliography</heading><heading level='3'>Novels</heading><paragraph><template><target>columns-list</target><arg>2</arg><arg>
