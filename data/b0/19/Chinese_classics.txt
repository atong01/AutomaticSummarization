'''Chinese classic texts''' or '''canonical texts''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]:&nbsp;<small>[[traditional characters|t]]</small>&nbsp;{{nowrap|{{lang|zh|{{linktext|中國|古典|典籍}}}}}}, <small>[[simplified characters|s]]</small>&nbsp;{{nowrap|{{lang|zh|{{linktext|中国|古典|典籍}}}}}}, <small>[[pinyin|p]]</small>&nbsp;''Zhōngguó gǔdiǎn diǎnjí'') refers to the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[Chinese literature|texts]] which originated before the imperial unification by the [[Qin dynasty]] in {{nowrap|221 BC,}} particularly the "[[Four Books and Five Classics]]" of the [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] tradition, themselves a customary abridgment of the "[[Thirteen Classics]]". All of these pre-Qin texts were written in [[classical Chinese]]. All three canons are collectively known as the '''classics''' (<small>[[traditional characters|t]]</small>&nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|經}}}}, <small>[[simplified characters|s]]</small>&nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|经}}}}, ''jīng'', <small>lit.</small>&nbsp;"[[warp (weaving)|warp]]").<ref name=Voorst>{{cite book|title=Anthology of World Scriptures|author=Voorst, Robert E.

Chinese classic texts may more broadly refer to texts written either in [[vernacular Chinese]] or in the classical Chinese that was current until the fall of the last imperial dynasty, the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]], in 1912. These can include ''shi'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|史}}}}, [[Chinese historiography|historical works]]), ''zi'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|子}}}}, [[Chinese philosophy|philosophical works]] belonging to schools of thought other than the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] but also including works on agriculture, [[Traditional Chinese medicine|medicine]], mathematics, [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]], divination, art criticism, and other miscellaneous writings) and ''ji'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|集}}}}, literary works) as well as ''jing''.

In the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and Qing dynasties, the Four Books and Five Classics were the subject of mandatory study by those [[Confucianism|Confucian]] scholars who wished to take the [[imperial exams]] to become [[mandarin (official)|government officials]]. Any political discussion was full of references to this background, and one could not be one of the [[Scholar-bureaucrats|literati]] (or, in some periods, even a military officer) without having memorized them. Generally, children first memorized the [[Chinese characters]]  of the "[[Three Character Classic]]" and the "[[Hundred Family Surnames]]" and then went on to memorize the other classics. The literate elite therefore shared a common culture and set of values.

Scholarship on these texts naturally divides itself into two periods, before and after the [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|burning of the books]] during the fall of the Qin dynasty, when many of the original pre-Qin texts were lost.<ref name=Voorst/>

==Before 221 BC==
*The Classics of [[Confucianism]]
** The [[Four Books]]
*** The ''[[Great Learning]]'' is a chapter from the ''Classic of Rites'' (see below).
*** The ''[[Doctrine of the Mean]]'' is another chapter from the ''Classic of Rites''.
*** The ''[[Analects of Confucius]]'' (''Lun Yu''), a twenty-chapter work of dialogues attributed to Confucius and his disciples; traditionally believed to have been written by Confucius's own circle it is thought to have been set down by later Confucian scholars.
*** The ''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]]'' (''Mengzi''), a book of anecdotes and conversations of [[Mencius]], a disciple of Confucius.
**The [[Five Classics]]
*** The ''[[I Ching]]'' (or ''Book of Changes'') is a manual of divination based on the eight [[bagua|trigram]]s attributed to the mythical figure [[Fuxi]] (by at least the time of the early Eastern Zhou these eight trigrams had been multiplied to sixty-four [[Hexagram (I Ching)|hexagram]]s). The ''I Ching'' is still used by modern adherents of [[folk religion]].
*** The ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'' (''Shi Jing'') is made up of 305 poems divided into 160 folk songs, 74 minor festal songs, traditionally sung at court festivities, 31 major festal songs, sung at more solemn court ceremonies, and 40 hymns and eulogies, sung at sacrifices to gods and ancestral spirits of the royal house. This book is traditionally credited as a compilation from Confucius. A standard version, named ''Maoshi Zhengyi'', was compiled in the mid-7th century under the leadership of [[Kong Yingda]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawpark.jimdo.com/list-of-36/detailed-list-19-24/ |title=Detailed List 19-24 - lawpark's JimdoPage! |publisher=Lawpark.jimdo.com |date=2014-01-27 |accessdate=2014-04-30}}</ref>

**** The ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'' (''Commentary of Zuo'') is a different report of the same events as the ''Spring and Autumn Annals'' with a few significant differences.
