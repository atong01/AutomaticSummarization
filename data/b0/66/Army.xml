This decentralized system was necessary due to the social order of the time, but could lead to motley forces with variable training, equipment and abilities. The more resources the noble had access to the better his troops would be.</paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>knight</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>were drawn to battle by feudal and social obligation, and also by the prospect of profit and advancement. Those who performed well were likely to increase their landholdings and advance in the social hierarchy. The prospect of significant income from pillage, and ransoming prisoners was also important. For the mounted knight war could be a relatively low risk affair.</paragraph><paragraph>As central governments grew in power, a return to the citizen armies of the classical period also began, as central levies of the<space/><link><target>peasantry</target></link><space/>began to be the central recruiting tool.<space/><link><target>England</target></link><space/>was one of the most centralized states in the Middle Ages, and the armies that fought in the<space/><link><target>Hundred Years' War</target></link><space/>were, predominantly, composed of paid professionals.</paragraph><paragraph>In theory, every Englishman had an obligation to serve for forty days. Forty days was not long enough for a campaign, especially one on the continent.</paragraph><paragraph>Thus the<space/><link><target>scutage</target></link><space/>was introduced, whereby most Englishmen paid to escape their service and this money was used to create a permanent army. However, almost all high medieval armies in Europe were composed of a great deal of paid core troops, and there was a large<space/><link><target>mercenary</target></link><space/>market in Europe from at least the early 12th century.</paragraph><paragraph>As the Middle Ages progressed in<space/><link><target>Italy</target></link>, Italian cities began to rely mostly on mercenaries to do their fighting rather than the militias that had dominated the early and high medieval period in this region. These would be groups of career soldiers who would be paid a set rate. Mercenaries tended to be effective soldiers, especially in combination with standing forces, but in Italy they came to dominate the armies of the city states. This made them considerably less reliable than a standing army. Mercenary-on-mercenary warfare in Italy also led to relatively bloodless campaigns which relied as much on maneuver as on battles.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1439 the<space/><link><target>France</target><part>French</part></link><space/>legislature, known as the<space/><link><target>Estates General (France)</target><part>Estates General</part></link><space/>(<link><target>French language</target><part>French</part></link>:<space/><italics>tats gnraux</italics>), passed laws that restricted military recruitment and training to the king alone. There was a new tax to be raised known as the<space/><italics><link><target>taille</target></link></italics><space/>that was to provide funding for a new Royal army. The mercenary companies were given a choice of either joining the Royal army as<space/><italics><link><target>Compagnie d'ordonnance</target><part>compagnies d'ordonnance</part></link></italics><space/>on a permanent basis, or being hunted down and destroyed if they refused. France gained a total standing army of around 6,000 men, which was sent out to gradually eliminate the remaining mercenaries who insisted on operating on their own. The new standing army had a more disciplined and professional approach to warfare than its predecessors. The reforms of the 1440s, eventually led to the<space/><link><target>Battle of Castillon</target><part>French victory at Castillon</part></link><space/>in 1453, and the conclusion of the<space/><link><target>Hundred Years' War</target></link>.

Such mercenaries typically formed at the ends of periods of conflict, when men-at-arms were no longer needed by their respective governments.</paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>veteran</target></link><space/>soldiers thus looked for other forms of employment, often becoming mercenaries. Free Companies would often specialize in forms of combat that required longer periods of training that was not available in the form of a mobilized militia.</paragraph><paragraph>As late as the 1650s, most troops were mercenaries. However, after the 17th century, most states invested in better disciplined and more politically reliable permanent troops. For a time mercenaries became important as trainers and administrators, but soon these tasks were also taken by the state. The massive size of these armies required a large supporting force of administrators.</paragraph><paragraph>The newly centralized states were forced to set up vast organized bureaucracies to manage these armies, which some historians argue is the basis of the modern bureaucratic state. The combination of increased taxes and increased centralisation of government functions caused a series of revolts across Europe such as the<space/><link><target>Fronde</target></link><space/>in France and the<space/><link><target>English Civil War</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>In many countries, the resolution of this conflict was the rise of<space/><link><target>absolute monarchy</target></link>. Only in England and the Netherlands did representative government evolve as an alternative. From the late 17th century, states learned how to finance wars through long term low interest loans from national banking institutions. The first state to master this process was the<space/><link><target>Dutch Republic</target></link>. This transformation in the armies of Europe had great social impact. The defense of the state now rested on the commoners, not on the aristocrats.</paragraph><paragraph>However, aristocrats continued to monopolise the officer corps of almost all early modern armies, including their high command. Moreover, popular revolts almost always failed unless they had the support and patronage of the noble or gentry classes. The new armies, because of their vast expense, were also dependent on taxation and the commercial classes who also began to demand a greater role in society. The great commercial powers of the Dutch and English matched much larger states in military might.</paragraph><paragraph>As any man could be quickly trained in the use of a musket, it became far easier to form massive armies. The inaccuracy of the weapons necessitated large groups of massed soldiers. This led to a rapid swelling of the size of armies. For the first time huge masses of the population could enter combat, rather than just the highly skilled professionals.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Battle-of-Fontenoy.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>The colonels of the<space/><link><target>Gardes franaises</target><part>French Guards</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Grenadier Guards</target><part>British guard</part><trail>s</trail></link><space/>politely discussing who should fire first at the<space/><link><target>Battle of Fontenoy</target></link><space/>(1745).<extension extension_name='ref'>Mackinnon, Daniel.<space/><link type='external' href='http://archive.org/details/originandservic03mackgoog'>Origin and services of the Coldstream Guards</link>, London 1883, Vol. 1, p. 368, note 2</extension><space/>An example of &quot;lace war&quot;.</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>It has been argued that the drawing of men from across the nation into an organized corps helped breed national unity and patriotism, and during this period the modern notion of the<space/><link><target>nation state</target></link><space/>was born.
