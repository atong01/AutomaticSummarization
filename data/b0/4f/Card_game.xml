In the 18th century the card images of the traditional Italian tarot decks became popular in<space/><link><target>cartomancy</target></link><space/>and evolved into &quot;esoteric&quot; decks used primarily for the purpose; today most tarot decks sold in North America are the occult type, and are closely associated with fortune telling. In Europe, &quot;playing tarot&quot; decks remain popular for games, and have evolved since the 18th century to use regional suits (Spades/Hearts/Diamonds/Clubs in France, Leaves/Hearts/Bells/Acorns in Germany) as well as other familiar aspects of the Anglo-American deck such as corner card indices and &quot;stamped&quot; card symbols for non-court cards. Decks differ regionally based on the number of cards needed to play the games; the French tarot consists of the &quot;full&quot; 78 cards, while Germanic, Spanish and Italian Tarot variants remove certain values (usually low suited cards) from the deck, creating a deck with as few as 32 cards.</paragraph><paragraph>The French suits were introduced around 1480 and, in France, mostly replaced the earlier Latin suits of<space/><italics>swords</italics>,<space/><italics>clubs</italics>,<space/><italics>cups</italics><space/>and<space/><italics>coins</italics>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="parlett"><list type='bullet'><listitem><template><target>Citation</target><arg name="last">Parlett<space/></arg><arg name="first">David<space/></arg><arg name="title">The Oxford guide to card games: a historical survey<space/></arg><arg name="year">1990<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Oxford University Press<space/></arg><arg name="isbn">978-0-19-214165-1</arg></template></listitem></list></extension><template><target>rp</target><arg>43</arg></template><space/>(which are still common in Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries as well as in some northern regions of Italy)<extension extension_name='ref' name="parlett"></extension><template><target>rp</target><arg>30f</arg></template><space/>The suit symbols, being very simple and single-color, could be stamped onto the playing cards to create a deck, thus only requiring special full-color card art for the court cards. This drastically simplifies the production of a deck of cards versus the traditional Italian deck, which used unique full-color art for each card in the deck. The French suits became popular in English playing cards in the 16th century (despite historic animosity between France and England), and from there were introduced to British colonies including North America. The rise of Western culture has led to the near-universal popularity and availability of French-suited playing cards even in areas with their own regional card art.</paragraph><paragraph>In Japan, a distinct 48-card<space/><link><target>hanafuda</target></link><space/>deck is popular. It is derived from 16th-century Portuguese decks, after undergoing a long evolution driven by laws enacted by the<space/><link><target>Shogun</target><part>Tokugawa Shogunate</part></link><space/>attempting to ban the use of playing cards.</paragraph><paragraph>The best-known deck internationally is the 52-card Anglo-American deck used for such games as<space/><link><target>poker</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>contract bridge</target></link>.

The trump cards and<space/><italics>knight</italics><space/>cards from the French playing tarot are not included.</paragraph><paragraph>Originally the term &quot;knave&quot; was more common than &quot;jack&quot;; the card had been called a jack as part of the terminology of<space/><link><target>All Fours (game)</target><part>All-Fours</part></link><space/>since the 17th century, but the word was considered vulgar. (Note the exclamation by Estella in<space/><link><target>Charles Dickens</target></link>'s novel<space/><italics><link><target>Great Expectations</target></link></italics>: &quot;He calls the knaves, Jacks, this boy!&quot;) However, because the card abbreviation for knave (&quot;Kn&quot;) was so close to that of the king, it was very easy to confuse them, especially after suits and rankings were moved to the corners of the card in order to enable people to fan them in one hand and still see all the values. (The earliest known deck to place suits and rankings in the corner of the card is from 1693, but these cards did not become common until after 1864 when Hart reintroduced them along with the knave-to-jack change.) However, books of card games published in the third quarter of the 19th century evidently still referred to the &quot;knave&quot;, and the term with this definition is still recognized in the<space/><link><target>United Kingdom</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Since the 19th century some decks have been specially printed for certain games. Old Maid, Phase 10, Rook, and Uno are examples of games that can be played with one or more 52 card decks but are usually played with custom decks.

The most significant dividing lines run between one-player games and two-player games, and between two-player games and multi-player games. Card games for one player are known as<space/><italics>solitaire</italics><space/>or<space/><italics>patience</italics><space/>card games. (See<space/><link><target>list of solitaire card games</target></link>.) Generally speaking, they are in many ways special and atypical, although some of them have given rise to two- or multi-player games such as<space/><link><target>Spite and Malice</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>In card games for two players, usually not all cards are distributed to the players, as they would otherwise have perfect information about the game state. Two-player games have always been immensely popular and include some of the most significant card games such as<space/><link><target>piquet</target></link>,<space/><link><target>bezique</target></link>,<space/><link><target>sixty-six (card game)</target><part>sixty-six</part></link>,<space/><link><target>klaberjass</target></link>,<space/><link><target>gin rummy</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>cribbage</target></link>. Many multi-player games started as two-player games that were adapted to a greater number of players. For such adaptations a number of non-obvious choices must be made beginning with the choice of a game orientation.</paragraph><paragraph>One way of extending a two-player game to more players is by building two teams of equal size. A common case is four players in two fixed partnerships, sitting crosswise as in<space/><link><target>whist</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>contract bridge</target></link>. Partners sit opposite to each other and cannot see each other's hands. If communication between the partners is allowed at all, then it is usually restricted to a specific list of permitted signs and signals. 17th-century French partnership games such as<space/><link><target>cart</target><part>triomphe</part></link><space/>were special in that partners sat next to each other and were allowed to communicate freely so long as they did not exchange cards or played out of order.</paragraph><paragraph>Another way of extending a two-player game to more players is as a<space/><italics>cut-throat</italics><space/>game, in which all players fight on their own, and win or lose alone. Most cut-throat card games are<space/><italics>round games</italics>, i.e. they can be played by any number of players starting from two or three, so long as there are enough cards for all.</paragraph><paragraph>For some of the most interesting games such as<space/><link><target>ombre</target></link>,<space/><link><target>tarot, tarock and tarocchi games</target><part>tarot</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>skat (card game)</target><part>skat</part></link>, the associations between players change from hand to hand. Ultimately players all play on their own, but for each hand, some game mechanism divides the players into two teams. Most typically these are<space/><italics>solo games</italics>, i.e. games in which one player becomes the soloist and has to achieve some objective against the others, who form a team and win or lose all their points jointly. But in games for more than three players, there may also be a mechanism that selects two players who then have to play against the others.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Direction of play</heading><paragraph>The players of a card game normally form a circle around a table or other space that can hold cards. The<space/><italics>game orientation</italics><space/>or<space/><italics>direction of play</italics>, which is only relevant for three or more players, can be either<space/><link><target>clockwise</target></link><space/>or counterclockwise. It is the direction in which various roles in the game proceed. Most regions have a traditional direction of play, such as:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>Counterclockwise in most of Asia and in Latin America.</listitem><listitem>Clockwise in North America and Australia.</listitem></list><paragraph>Europe is roughly divided into a clockwise area in the north and a counterclockwise area in the south. The boundary runs between<space/><link><target>Ireland</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Great Britain</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Netherlands</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Germany</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Austria</target></link><space/>(mostly),<space/><link><target>Slovakia</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Ukraine</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Russia</target></link><space/>(<link><target>clockwise</target></link>) and<space/><link><target>France</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Switzerland</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Italy</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Slovenia</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Croatia</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Hungary</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Romania</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Bulgaria</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Turkey</target></link><space/>(counterclockwise).</paragraph><paragraph>Games that originate in a region with a strong preference are often initially played in the original direction, even in regions that prefer the opposite direction. For games that have official rules and are played in tournaments, the direction of play is often prescribed in those rules.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Determining who deals</heading><paragraph>Most games have some form of asymmetry between players. The roles of players are normally expressed in terms of the<space/><italics>dealer</italics>, i.e. the player whose task it is to shuffle the cards and distribute them to the players. Being the dealer can be a (minor or major) advantage or disadvantage, depending on the game. Therefore, after each played hand, the deal normally passes to the next player according to the game orientation.</paragraph><paragraph>As it can still be an advantage or disadvantage to be the first dealer, there are some standard methods for determining who is the first dealer. A common method is by cutting, which works as follows. One player shuffles the deck and places it on the table. Each player lifts a packet of cards from the top, reveals its bottom card, and returns it to the deck. The player who reveals the highest (or lowest) card becomes dealer. In case of a tie, the process is repeated by the tied players. For some games such as whist this process of cutting is part of the official rules, and the hierarchy of cards for the purpose of cutting (which need not be the same as that used otherwise in the game) is also specified. But in general any method can be used, such as tossing a coin in case of a two-player game, drawing cards until one player draws an ace, or rolling dice.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Hands, rounds and games</heading><preblock><preline>A<space/><italics>hand</italics><space/>is a unit of the game that begins with the dealer shuffling and dealing the cards as described below, and ends with the players scoring and the next dealer being determined. The set of cards that each player receives and holds in his or her hands is also known as that player's hand.</preline></preblock><paragraph>The hand is over when the players have finished playing their hands. Most often this occurs when one player (or all) has no cards left. The player who sits after the dealer in the direction of play is known as<space/><bold>eldest hand</bold><space/>(or in two-player games as<space/><bold>elder hand</bold>). A<space/><italics>game round</italics><space/>consists of as many hands as there are players. After each hand, the deal is passed on in the direction of play, i.e. the previous eldest hand becomes the new dealer. Normally players score points after each hand. A game may consist of a fixed number of rounds. Alternatively it can be played for a fixed number of points. In this case it is over with the hand in which a player reaches the target score.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Shuffling</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Shuffling</arg></template>Shuffling is the process of bringing the cards of a pack into a random order. There are a large number of techniques with various advantages and disadvantages.<space/><italics>Riffle shuffling</italics><space/>is a method in which the deck is divided into two roughly equal-sized halves that are bent and then released, so that the cards interlace. Repeating this process several times randomizes the deck well, but the method is harder to learn than some others and may damage the cards. The<space/><italics>overhand shuffle</italics><space/>and the<space/><italics>Hindu shuffle</italics><space/>are two techniques that work by taking batches of cards from the top of the deck and reassembling them in the opposite order. They are easier to learn but must be repeated more often. A method suitable for small children consists in spreading the cards on a large surface and moving them around before picking up the deck again. This is also the most common method for shuffling tiles such as dominoes.</paragraph><paragraph>For casino games that are played for large sums it is vital that the cards be properly randomised, but for many games this is less critical, and in fact player experience can suffer when the cards are shuffled too well. The official<space/><link><target>skat (card game)</target><part>skat</part></link><space/>rules stipulate that the cards are<space/><italics>shuffled well</italics>, but according to a decision of the German skat court, a one-handed player should ask another player to do the shuffling, rather than use a<space/><link><target>shuffling machine</target></link>, as it would shuffle the cards<space/><italics>too</italics><space/>well. French<space/><link><target>belote</target></link><space/>rules go so far as to prescribe that the deck never be shuffled between hands.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Deal</heading><preblock><preline></preline></preblock><paragraph>The dealer takes all of the cards in the pack, arranges them so that they are in a uniform stack, and<space/><link><target>shuffle</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>them. In strict play, the dealer then offers the deck to the previous player (in the sense of the game direction) for<space/><italics><link><target>cut (playing cards)</target><part>cutting</part></link></italics>. If the deal is clockwise, this is the player to the dealer's right; if counterclockwise, it is the player to the dealer's left. The invitation to cut is made by placing the pack, face downward, on the table near the player who is to cut: who then lifts the upper portion of the pack clear of the lower portion and places it alongside. (Normally the two portions have about equal size. Strict rules often indicate that each portion must contain a certain minimum number of cards, such as three or five.) The formerly lower portion is then replaced on top of the formerly upper portion. Instead of cutting, one may also knock on the deck to indicate that one trusts the dealer to have shuffled fairly.</paragraph><paragraph>The actual<space/><italics>deal</italics><space/>(distribution of cards) is done in the direction of play, beginning with eldest hand. The dealer holds the pack, face down, in one hand, and removes cards from the top of it with his or her other hand to distribute to the players, placing them face down on the table in front of the players to whom they are dealt. The cards may be dealt one at a time, or in batches of more than one card; and either the entire pack or a determined number of cards are dealt out. The undealt cards, if any, are left face down in the middle of the table, forming the<space/><italics>stock</italics><space/>(also called the talon, widow, skat or kitty depending on the game and region).</paragraph><paragraph>Throughout the shuffle, cut, and deal, the dealer should prevent the players from seeing the faces of any of the cards. The players should not try to see any of the faces. Should a player accidentally see a card, other than one's own, proper etiquette would be to admit this. It is also dishonest to try to see cards as they are dealt, or to take advantage of having seen a card. Should a card accidentally become exposed, (visible to all), any player can demand a redeal (all the cards are gathered up, and the shuffle, cut, and deal are repeated) or that the card be replaced randomly into the deck (&quot;burning&quot; it) and a replacement dealt from the top to the player who was to receive the revealed card.</paragraph><paragraph>When the deal is complete, all players pick up their cards, or 'hand', and hold them in such a way that the faces can be seen by the holder of the cards but not the other players, or vice versa depending on the game. It is helpful to fan one's cards out so that if they have corner indices all their values can be seen at once. In most games, it is also useful to sort one's hand, rearranging the cards in a way appropriate to the game. For example, in a<space/><link><target>trick-taking game</target></link><space/>it may be easier to have all one's cards of the same suit together, whereas in a<space/><link><target>rummy</target></link><space/>game one might sort them by rank or by potential combinations.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Rules</heading><paragraph>A new card game starts in a small way, either as someone's invention, or as a modification of an existing game. Those playing it may agree to change the rules as they wish. The rules that they agree on become the &quot;house rules&quot; under which they play the game. A set of house rules may be accepted as valid by a group of players wherever they play, as it may also be accepted as governing all play within a particular house, caf, or club.</paragraph><paragraph>When a game becomes sufficiently popular, so that people often play it with strangers, there is a need for a generally accepted set of rules. This need is often met when a particular set of house rules becomes generally recognized. For example, when<space/><link><target>Whist</target></link><space/>became popular in 18th-century<space/><link><target>England</target></link>, players in the<space/><link><target>Portland Club (London)</target><part>Portland Club</part></link><space/>agreed on a set of house rules for use on its premises. Players in some other clubs then agreed to follow the &quot;Portland Club&quot; rules, rather than go to the trouble of codifying and printing their own sets of rules. The Portland Club rules eventually became generally accepted throughout England and Western cultures.</paragraph><paragraph>It should be noted that there is nothing static or &quot;official&quot; about this process. For the majority of games, there is no one set of universal rules by which the game is played, and the most common ruleset is no more or less than that. Many widely played card games, such as<space/><link><target>Canasta</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Pinochle</target></link>, have no official regulating body. The most common ruleset is often determined by the most popular distribution of rulebooks for card games. Perhaps the original compilation of popular playing card games was collected by<space/><link><target>Edmund Hoyle</target></link>, a self-made authority on many popular parlor games. The<space/><link><target>U.S. Playing Card Company</target></link><space/>now owns the eponymous Hoyle brand, and publishes a series of rulebooks for various families of card games that have largely standardized the games' rules in countries and languages where the rulebooks are widely distributed. However, players are free to, and often do, invent &quot;house rules&quot; to supplement or even largely replace the &quot;standard&quot; rules.</paragraph><paragraph>If there is a sense in which a card game can have an &quot;official&quot; set of rules, it is when that card game has an &quot;official&quot; governing body. For example, the rules of tournament<space/><link><target>contract bridge</target><part>bridge</part></link><space/>are governed by the World Bridge Federation, and by local bodies in various countries such as the<space/><link><target>American Contract Bridge League</target></link><space/>in the U.S., and the<space/><link><target>English Bridge Union</target></link><space/>in England. The rules of<space/><link><target>Skat (card game)</target><part>skat</part></link><space/>are governed by<space/><link><target>The International Skat Players Association</target></link><space/>and in<space/><link><target>Germany</target></link><space/>by the<space/><link><target>Deutscher Skatverband</target></link><space/>which publishes the<space/><italics>Skatordnung</italics>. The rules of<space/><link><target>French tarot</target></link><space/>are governed by the<space/><link><target>Fdration Franaise de Tarot</target></link>. The rules of<space/><link><target>Poker</target></link>'s variants are largely traditional, but enforced by the<space/><link><target>World Series of Poker</target></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>World Poker Tour</target></link><space/>organizations which sponsor tournament play. Even in these cases, the rules must only be followed exactly at games sanctioned by these governing bodies; players in less formal settings are free to implement agreed-upon supplemental or substitute rules at will.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Rule infractions</heading><paragraph>An infraction is any action which is against the rules of the game, such as playing a card when it is not one's turn to play or the accidental exposure of a card, informally known as 'bleeding'.</paragraph><paragraph>In many official sets of rules for card games, the rules specifying the penalties for various infractions occupy more pages than the rules specifying how to play correctly. This is tedious, but necessary for games that are played seriously. Players who intend to play a card game at a high level generally ensure before beginning that all agree on the penalties to be used. When playing privately, this will normally be a question of agreeing house rules. In a tournament there will probably be a tournament director who will enforce the rules when required and arbitrate in cases of doubt.</paragraph><paragraph>If a player breaks the rules of a game deliberately, this is cheating. Most card players would refuse to play cards with a known cheat. The rest of this section is therefore about accidental infractions, caused by ignorance, clumsiness, inattention, etc.</paragraph><paragraph>As the same game is played repeatedly among a group of players, precedents build up about how a particular infraction of the rules should be handled. For example, &quot;Sheila just led a card when it wasn't her turn. Last week when Jo did that, we agreed ... etc.&quot; Sets of such precedents tend to become established among groups of players, and to be regarded as part of the house rules. Sets of house rules become formalized, as described in the previous section. Therefore, for some games, there is a &quot;proper&quot; way of handling infractions of the rules. But for many games, without governing bodies, there is no standard way of handling infractions.</paragraph><paragraph>In many circumstances, there is no need for special rules dealing with what happens after an infraction. As a general principle, the person who broke a rule should not benefit by it, and the other players should not lose by it. An exception to this may be made in games with fixed partnerships, in which it may be felt that the partner(s) of the person who broke a rule should also not benefit. The penalty for an accidental infraction should be as mild as reasonable, consistent with there being no possible benefit to the person responsible.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Types</heading><heading level='3'>Trick-taking games</heading><paragraph><template><target>See also</target><arg>List of trick-taking games</arg></template>The object of a<space/><link><target>trick-taking game</target></link><space/>is based on the play of multiple rounds, or tricks, in each of which each player plays a single card from their hand, and based on the values of played cards one player wins or &quot;takes&quot; the trick. The specific object varies with each game and can include taking as many tricks as possible, taking as many scoring cards within the tricks won as possible, taking as few tricks (or as few penalty cards) as possible, taking a particular trick in the hand, or taking an exact number of tricks.<space/><link><target>Contract bridge</target><part>Bridge</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Whist</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Euchre</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Spades</target></link>, and the various<space/><link><target>Tarot card games</target></link><space/>are popular examples.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Matching games</heading><paragraph><template><target>see also</target><arg>Category:Matching card games</arg></template>The object of<space/><link><target>Rummy</target></link>, and various other melding or matching games, is to acquire the required groups of matching cards before an opponent can do so.
