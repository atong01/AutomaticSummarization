In 1947, Miller's play ''[[All My Sons]]'', the writing of which had commenced in 1941, was a success on Broadway (earning him his first [[Tony Award]], [[Tony Award for Best Author|for Best Author]]) and his reputation as a playwright was established.<ref>{{Cite book | year=2005 | title=Arthur Miller: A Critical Study | author=Bigsby, C.

In 1949, Miller exchanged letters with [[Eugene O'Neill]] regarding Miller's production of ''All My Sons''. O'Neill had sent Miller a congratulatory telegram; in response, he wrote a letter that consisted of a few paragraphs detailing his gratitude for the telegram, apologizing for not responding earlier, and inviting Eugene to the opening of ''Death of a Salesman''. O'Neill replied, accepting the apology, but declining the invitation, explaining that his [[Parkinson's disease]] made it difficult to travel. He ended the letter with an invitation to Boston, which never occurred.<ref>Dan Isaac, Founding Father: O'Neill's Correspondence with Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams, The Eugene O'Neill Review,Vol. 17, No. 1/2 (Spring/Fall 1993), pp. 124–33</ref>

===The critical years===
In 1956, a [[One-act play|one-act version]] of Miller's [[Verse drama and dramatic verse|verse drama]] ''[[A View from the Bridge]]'' opened on Broadway in a joint bill with one of Miller's lesser-known plays, ''[[A Memory of Two Mondays]]''. The following year, Miller revised ''A View from the Bridge'' as a two-act [[prose]] drama, which [[Peter Brook]] directed in London.<ref>Miller, Arthur (1988) Introduction to ''Plays: One'', London: Methuen, p. 51, ISBN 0413175502.</ref> A French-Italian co-production ''[[A View from the Bridge (film)|Vu du pont]]'', based on the play, was released in 1962.

In June 1956, Miller left his first wife Mary Slattery and on June 29 he married [[Marilyn Monroe]].<ref name="Observer_obit"/> Miller and Monroe had met in April 23, 1951, when they had a brief affair, and had remained in contact since then.<ref name="Observer_obit"/><ref name="Times_obit" />

Miller began work on ''[[The Misfits (film)|The Misfits]]'', starring his wife. Miller later said that the filming was one of the lowest points in his life; shortly before the film's premiere in 1961, the pair divorced.<ref name="Observer_obit"/><ref name="chronology"/> 19 months later, Monroe died of a possible drug overdose. Miller's future wife [[Inge Morath]] worked as a photographer documenting the film's production. The film proved to be the last appearances for both Monroe and [[Clark Gable]], and one of the last for [[Montgomery Clift]].

Miller married photographer [[Inge Morath]] on February 17, 1962 and the first of their two children, [[Rebecca Miller|Rebecca]], was born September 15, 1962. Their son Daniel was born with [[Down syndrome]] in November 1966; he was institutionalized and excluded from the Millers' personal life at Arthur's insistence.<ref name="VanityFair">{{cite news|work=Vanity Fair |title=Arthur Miller's Missing Act|author=Andrews, Suzanna |date=September 2007|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/fame/features/2007/09/miller200709?printable=true&currentPage=all|accessdate=August 17, 2007}}</ref> The couple remained together until Inge's death in 2002.

====HUAC controversy and "The Crucible"====
In 1952, [[Elia Kazan]] appeared before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC); unwilling to risk his promising career in Hollywood for the Communist cause that he had come to despise, Kazan named eight members of the Group Theatre, including [[Clifford Odets]], [[Paula Strasberg]], [[Lillian Hellman]], [[J.

Though widely considered only somewhat successful at the time of its initial release, today ''[[The Crucible]]'' is Miller's most frequently produced work throughout the world<ref name="Observer_obit" /> and was adapted into an [[The Crucible (opera)|opera]] by [[Robert Ward (composer)|Robert Ward]], which won the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1962.

When Miller applied in 1956 for a routine renewal of his passport, the [[House Unamerican Activities Committee]] used this opportunity to [[subpoena]] him to appear before the committee. Before appearing, Miller asked the committee not to ask him to name names, to which the chairman, [[Francis E. Walter]] (D-PA) agreed.<ref name="BBCOnThisDay">{{cite news

When Miller attended the hearing, to which Monroe accompanied him, risking her own career,<ref name="Observer_obit" /> he gave the committee a detailed account of his political activities. Reneging on the chairman's promise, the committee demanded the names of friends and colleagues who had participated in similar activities.<ref name="BBCOnThisDay"/> Miller refused to comply, saying "I could not use the name of another person and bring trouble on him."<ref name="BBCOnThisDay" /> As a result, a judge found Miller guilty of [[contempt of Congress]] in May 1957. Miller was sentenced to a $500 fine or thirty days in prison, blacklisted, and disallowed a US passport.<ref name="UMICH_Early"/> In 1958, his conviction was overturned by the court of appeals, which ruled that Miller had been misled by the chairman of the HUAC.<ref name="UMICH_Early"/>

Miller's experience with the HUAC affected him throughout his life. In the late 1970s he became very interested in the highly publicized Barbara Gibbons murder case, in which Gibbons' son Peter Reilly was convicted of his mother's murder based on what many felt was a coerced confession and little other evidence. ''[[City Confidential]]'', an [[A&E Network]] series, produced an episode about the murder, postulating that part of the reason Miller took such an active interest (including supporting Reilly's defense and using his own celebrity to bring attention to Reilly's plight) was because he had felt similarly persecuted in his run-ins with the HUAC. He sympathized with Reilly, whom he firmly believed to be innocent and to have been railroaded by the Connecticut State Police and the Attorney General who had initially prosecuted the case.<ref>

In 1964'' [[After the Fall (play)|After the Fall]]'' was produced, and is said to be a deeply personal view of Miller's experiences during his marriage to Monroe. The play reunited Miller with his former friend Kazan: they collaborated on both the script and the direction.

Miller was an unusually articulate commentator on his own work.  In 1978 he published a collection of his ''Theater Essays'', edited by Robert A. Martin and with a foreword by Miller.  Highlights of the collection included Miller's introduction to his ''Collected Plays'', his reflections on the theory of tragedy, comments on the McCarthy Era, and pieces arguing for a publicly supported theater.  Reviewing this collection in the ''Chicago Tribune,'' [[Studs Terkel]] remarked, "in reading [the ''Theater Essays'']...you are exhilaratingly aware of a social critic, as well as a playwright, who knows what he's talking about."<ref>Martin, Robert A. (1978) ed., ''The Theater Essays of Arthur Miller.''  Viking, ISBN 0670698016.</ref>

In 1983, Miller traveled to China to produce and direct ''Death of a Salesman'' at the People's Art Theatre in Beijing. The play was a success in China<ref name="UMICH_60s70s80s" /> and in 1984, ''Salesman in Beijing,'' a book about Miller's experiences in Beijing, was published. Around the same time, ''Death of a Salesman'' was made into a TV movie starring [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Willy Loman. Shown on CBS, it attracted 25 million viewers.<ref name="chronology" /><ref>''The Cambridge History of American Theatre: Post-World War II to the 1990s'', page 296 ([[Cambridge University Press]], 2006).</ref> In late 1987, Miller's autobiographical work,
''Timebends'', was published. Before it was published, it was well known that Miller would not talk about Monroe in interviews; in ''Timebends'' Miller talks about his experiences with Monroe in detail.<ref name="Observer_obit" />

During the early-mid 1990s, Miller wrote three new plays: ''[[The Ride Down Mt. Morgan]]'' (1991), ''[[The Last Yankee]]'' (1992), and ''[[Broken Glass (play)|Broken Glass]]'' (1994). In 1996, [[The Crucible (1996 film)|a film]] of ''The Crucible'' starring [[Daniel Day-Lewis]], [[Paul Scofield]], [[Bruce Davison]], and [[Winona Ryder]] opened. Miller spent much of 1996 working on the screenplay to the film.<ref name="chronology" />
''[[Mr. Peters' Connections]]'' was staged [[Off-Broadway]] in 1998, and ''Death of a Salesman'' was revived on Broadway in 1999 to celebrate its fiftieth anniversary. The play, once again, was a large critical success, winning a Tony Award for best revival of a play.<ref>{{cite web

==Miller's styles, themes, and characters==

Miller successfully  diverse dramatic styles and movements in the belief that a play should embody a delicate balance between the individual and society, between the singular personality and the polity, and between the separate and collective elements of life. He thought himself a writer of social plays with a strong emphasis on moral problems in American society and often questioned psychological causes of behavior. He also built on the realist tradition of Henrik Ibsen in his exploration of the individual’s conflict with society but also borrowed Symbolist and expressionist techniques from Bertolt Brecht and others. Some critics attempt to interpret his work from either an exclusively political or an exclusively psychological standpoint but fail to pierce the social veil that Miller creates in his work.<ref name="Rollyson, Carl 2003, p1-12">Rollyson, Carl; Price, Victoria, Author Biography,Critical Survey of Drama, Second Revised Edition, April 2003, pp. 1–1</ref> Miller often stressed that society made his characters what they are and how it dictated all of their fears and choices.<ref>McCormack, Thomas, "Arthur Millers Manifesto", ''The American Scholar'', Vol. 74, No. 3(Summer 2005), p. 143</ref>

===Themes===

====All American Family====
While Miller comes under criticism for his reputation, most critics note him as a dramatist of the family. One of his greatest strengths is his penetrating insight into familial relationships.<ref>Carson, Neil,Contemporary Literary Criticism. Ed. Jean C. Stine and Bridget Broderick. Vol. 26. Detroit: Gale, 1983. From Literature Resource Center</ref> Often, Miller positions his characters are living in service of their family. The conventions of the family play, such as patterns, setting, and style of representation were set canonically by [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[Tennessee Williams]], and Miller. In these plays, white men are privileged with their family and social responsibility; typically, these men are lower class. Miller maintained that family relationships and families must be immersed in social context.<ref>Lenke Németh
Hungarian Journal of English and American Studies (HJEAS), ARTHUR MILLER'S "THE RIDE DOWN MOUNT MORGAN" AND THE FAMILY-PLAY TRADITION, Vol. 11, No. 2, Representations of the Family in Modern English-Language Drama In Memory of Arthur Miller (Fall, 2005), pp. 77–88</ref>

====Social responsibility====
Arthur Miller is known for the consciousness of the characters in his play. In his plays, he confronts a level of banality with the roller coaster of guilt and responsibility. Some strong examples of characters who portray this struggle between their conscious and their social responsibility are Joe Keller in [[All My Sons]] and John Proctor in [[The Crucible]].<ref>Popkin, Henry, Arthur Miller: The Strange Encounter, The Sewanee Review,Vol. 68, No. 1 (Winter, 1960), pp. 34-60</ref> Miller often creates consequences for characters who ignore or violate their social responsibilities.

====Life, death, and human purpose====

Miller's determination to deal with the eternal themes of life, death and human purpose is one of his most prominent themes across his works. This theme spans from Willy Lowman's dedication to providing for his family and his inherent belief that his death would leave a legacy, to John Proctor's willingness to die to preserve his name. Mostly all of Miller's protagonists struggle with the mark they leave on life and what it means to die.<ref>Broderick, Bridget and Stein, Jean, ″Contemporary Literary Criticism″, eds. Vol. 26. Detroit: Gale, 1983. 617 pp.</ref>

===Characters===

====Willy Loman====
In [[Death of a Salesman]] – originally entitled “The Inside of His Head” – Miller brilliantly solves the problem of revealing his main character’s inner discord, rendering Willy Loman as solid as the society in which he tries to sell himself. Indeed, many critics believe that Miller has never surpassed his achievement in this play, which stands as his breakthrough work, distinguished by an extremely long Broadway run, by many revivals, and by many theater awards, including the Pulitzer Prize in 1949.<ref name="Rollyson, Carl 2003, p1-12"/><ref>Arthur Miller, The Pulitzer Prices, pulitzerprize.org</ref> Death of a Salesman seems destined to remain an American classic and a standard text in American classrooms.
Willy Loman desperately wants to believe that he has succeeded, that he is “well liked” as a great salesman, a fine father, and a devoted husband. That he has not really attracted the admiration and popularity at which he has aimed is evident, however, in the weariness that belabors him from the beginning of the play. Nearing retirement he suffers a drastic decrease in sales work, a dissatisfying marriage, and a turbulent relationship with his sons which inexorably leads to his suicide with the justification that the insurance will finally provide for his family.<ref name="Rollyson, Carl 2003, p1-12"/>

====Eddie Carbone====
Eddie Carbone is the central character in [[A View From The Bridge]] and is not positioned as the protagonist or the antogonist. He is a longshoreman who lives with his wife, Beatrice, and his 17-year-old niece, Catherine. When his family from Italy, Rodolpho and Marco, migrate illegally and begin to live with him, the small world that he operates in is disrupted. Eddie becomes conflicted and ultimately self-destructive over his sexual attraction to his niece and her involvement with one of his Italian tenants. His character arc culminates as he becomes an informer to the immigration authorities which leads to a confrontation with one of his tenants. Marco labels him as an informer and Eddie perceives this as a permanent blemish on his good name. This confrontation ultimately leads to his death, leaving Eddie as one of Miller's examples of tragic figures.<ref>EPSTEIN, Arthur, "A Look at A View From The Bridge",Texas Studies in Literature and Language,Vol. 7, No. 1 (Spring 1965), pp. 109–22</ref><ref>Krase, Jerome, "The AMerican Italian Historical Society: A View From The Bridge, Polish American Studies, Vol. 65, No. 1 (Spring, 2008), pp. 23–40</ref>

====John Proctor====
John Proctor is the protagonist of one of Miller's most controversial works, [[The Crucible]]. He is a faithful farmer who lives by a strict moral code that he violates by succumbing to an affair with a young girl, Abigail, who serves in his home. After rejecting her, Abigail spitefully accuses John's wife of witchcraft, involving him in a string of affairs that challenge his beliefs and convictions. In his attempts to save his wife, he is convicted of witchcraft as well, and will only be acquitted if he confesses to his crime and signs his name to a piece of paper.<ref>Popkin, Harry, "Arthur Miller's The Crucible", College English,
Vol. 26, No. 2 (Nov., 1964), pp. 139–14<!-- Not the correct page range --></ref> Proctor is a strong, vital man in the prime of his life both in his confession of witchcraft and the subsequent passion with which he defends his name at the cost of his life.<ref>McGill, William Jr. "The Crucible of History: Miller's John Proctor"The New England Quarterly,Vol. 54, No. 2 (Jun., 1981), pp. 258–64</ref>

====Joe Keller====
Critics have long admired the playwright’s suspenseful handling of the Keller family’s burden in the play [[All My Sons]]. The critical character in this work is Joe Keller, who permitted defective parts to remain in warplanes that subsequently crash. Not only does Joe Keller fail to recognize his social responsibility, but also he allows his business partner to take the blame and serve the prison term for the crime. Gradually, events combine to strip Keller of his rationalizations. He argues that he never believed that the cracked engine heads would be installed and that he never admitted his mistake because it would have driven him out of business at the age of sixty-one, when he would not have another chance to “make something” for his family, his highest priority. Joe's irresponsibility is exposed through his son's questioning of his very humanity.<ref name="Rollyson, Carl 2003, p1-12"/> Joe's suicide results from the tremendous guilt and self-awareness that arises during the play. This reversal from staunchly defensive over his honorable need to protect his family to discovering his social responsibility had some critics claiming that this was a theatrical trick.

===Literary and public criticism===
[[Christopher Bigsby]] wrote ''Arthur Miller: The Definitive Biography'' based on boxes of papers Miller made available to him before his death in 2005.<ref name=Times>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article3499774.ece|title=Unseen writings show anti-racist passions of young Arthur Miller|author=Alberge, Dalya |work=The Times |location=London |date=March 7, 2008|accessdate=March 7, 2008 }}</ref> The book was published in November 2008, and is reported to reveal unpublished works in which Miller "bitterly attack[ed] the injustices of American racism long before it was taken up by the civil rights movement".<ref name=Times/>
