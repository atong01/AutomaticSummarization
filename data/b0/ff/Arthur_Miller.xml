He thought himself a writer of social plays with a strong emphasis on moral problems in American society and often questioned psychological causes of behavior. He also built on the realist tradition of Henrik Ibsen in his exploration of the individuals conflict with society but also borrowed Symbolist and expressionist techniques from Bertolt Brecht and others. Some critics attempt to interpret his work from either an exclusively political or an exclusively psychological standpoint but fail to pierce the social veil that Miller creates in his work.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Rollyson, Carl 2003, p1-12">Rollyson, Carl; Price, Victoria, Author Biography,Critical Survey of Drama, Second Revised Edition, April 2003, pp. 11</extension><space/>Miller often stressed that society made his characters what they are and how it dictated all of their fears and choices.<extension extension_name='ref'>McCormack, Thomas, &quot;Arthur Millers Manifesto&quot;,<space/><italics>The American Scholar</italics>, Vol. 74, No. 3(Summer 2005), p. 143</extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Themes</heading><heading level='4'>All American Family</heading><paragraph>While Miller comes under criticism for his reputation, most critics note him as a dramatist of the family.

In his plays, he confronts a level of banality with the roller coaster of guilt and responsibility.

This theme spans from Willy Lowman's dedication to providing for his family and his inherent belief that his death would leave a legacy, to John Proctor's willingness to die to preserve his name.

Indeed, many critics believe that Miller has never surpassed his achievement in this play, which stands as his breakthrough work, distinguished by an extremely long Broadway run, by many revivals, and by many theater awards, including the Pulitzer Prize in 1949.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Rollyson, Carl 2003, p1-12"></extension><extension extension_name='ref'>Arthur Miller, The Pulitzer Prices, pulitzerprize.org</extension><space/>Death of a Salesman seems destined to remain an American classic and a standard text in American classrooms.Willy Loman desperately wants to believe that he has succeeded, that he is well liked as a great salesman, a fine father, and a devoted husband. That he has not really attracted the admiration and popularity at which he has aimed is evident, however, in the weariness that belabors him from the beginning of the play. Nearing retirement he suffers a drastic decrease in sales work, a dissatisfying marriage, and a turbulent relationship with his sons which inexorably leads to his suicide with the justification that the insurance will finally provide for his family.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Rollyson, Carl 2003, p1-12"></extension></paragraph><heading level='4'>Eddie Carbone</heading><paragraph>Eddie Carbone is the central character in<space/><link><target>A View From The Bridge</target></link><space/>and is not positioned as the protagonist or the antogonist. He is a longshoreman who lives with his wife, Beatrice, and his 17-year-old niece, Catherine. When his family from Italy, Rodolpho and Marco, migrate illegally and begin to live with him, the small world that he operates in is disrupted. Eddie becomes conflicted and ultimately self-destructive over his sexual attraction to his niece and her involvement with one of his Italian tenants. His character arc culminates as he becomes an informer to the immigration authorities which leads to a confrontation with one of his tenants. Marco labels him as an informer and Eddie perceives this as a permanent blemish on his good name. This confrontation ultimately leads to his death, leaving Eddie as one of Miller's examples of tragic figures.<extension extension_name='ref'>EPSTEIN, Arthur, &quot;A Look at A View From The Bridge&quot;,Texas Studies in Literature and Language,Vol. 7, No. 1 (Spring 1965), pp. 10922</extension><extension extension_name='ref'>Krase, Jerome, &quot;The AMerican Italian Historical Society: A View From The Bridge, Polish American Studies, Vol. 65, No. 1 (Spring, 2008), pp. 2340</extension></paragraph><heading level='4'>John Proctor</heading><paragraph>John Proctor is the protagonist of one of Miller's most controversial works,<space/><link><target>The Crucible</target></link>.

The critical character in this work is Joe Keller, who permitted defective parts to remain in warplanes that subsequently crash. Not only does Joe Keller fail to recognize his social responsibility, but also he allows his business partner to take the blame and serve the prison term for the crime. Gradually, events combine to strip Keller of his rationalizations. He argues that he never believed that the cracked engine heads would be installed and that he never admitted his mistake because it would have driven him out of business at the age of sixty-one, when he would not have another chance to make something for his family, his highest priority.
