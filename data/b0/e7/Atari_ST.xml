He secured funding and bought Atari's Consumer Division (which included the console and home computer departments) in July. As executives and engineers left Commodore to join Tramiel's new<space/><link><target>Atari Corporation</target></link>, Commodore responded by filing lawsuits against four former engineers for theft of trade secrets.</paragraph><paragraph>The Tramiels did not purchase the employee contracts when they bought the assets of Atari Inc., so one of their first acts was to interview Atari Inc. employees to decide whom to hire at what was essentially a brand new company. This company was originally called TTL (Tramiel Technologies Limited), later renamed to Atari Corp. At the time of the purchase of Atari Inc's assets, there were roughly 900 employees remaining from a high point of 10,000. After the interviews, approximately 100 employees were hired to work at Atari Corp.</paragraph><paragraph>At one point a promising sound processor called AMY was a planned component for the new ST computer design, but the chip's design had issues and needed more time to complete. The Tramiels were already running on a slim budget and an extremely aggressive time line, so AMY was dropped in favor of an off the shelf Yamaha sound chip.</paragraph><paragraph>It was during this time in late July/early August that Leonard Tramiel discovered the original Amiga contract, which required Amiga Corporation to deliver the Lorraine chipset to Atari on June 30, 1984. Amiga Corp. had sought more monetary support from investors in spring 1984 (among them Tramel Technology, which wished to replace nearly everyone at Amiga).</paragraph><heading level='3'>Commodore and Amiga</heading><paragraph>Having heard rumors that Tramiel was negotiating to buy Atari, Amiga Corp. entered into discussions with Commodore. The discussions led to Commodore wanting to purchase Amiga Corporation outright, which Commodore believed would cancel any outstanding contracts, including Atari's. Instead of Amiga Corp. delivering Lorraine to Atari, Commodore delivered a check of $500,000 to Atari on Amiga's behalf, in effect returning the funds Atari invested into Amiga for the chipset. Tramiel countersued Amiga Corp. on August 13, 1984. He sought damages and an injunction to bar Amiga (and effectively Commodore) from producing anything with its technology.</paragraph><paragraph>At Commodore, the Amiga team was in limbo during the summer of 1984 because of the lawsuit. No word on the status of the chipset, the Lorraine computer, or the team's fate was known. In the fall of 1984, Commodore informed the team that the Lorraine project was active again, the chipset was to be improved, the operating system developed, and the hardware design completed. While Commodore announced the<space/><link><target>Amiga 1000</target></link><space/>with the Lorraine chipset in July 1985, the delay gave Atari, with its many former Commodore engineers, time to deliver the first Atari ST units in June 1985. In March 1987, the two companies settled the dispute out of court in a closed decision.<extension extension_name='ref' name="3years"><template><target>cite news</target><arg name="first"><space/>Jeffrey<space/></arg><arg name="last"><space/>Daniels<space/></arg><arg name="title"><space/>3 Years With the ST<space/></arg><arg name="url"><space/>http://www.atarimagazines.com/startv3n1/threeyearsofst.html<space/></arg><arg name="work"><space/>START Magazine<space/></arg><arg name="publisher"><space/>James Capparell<space/></arg><arg name="page"><space/>22<space/></arg><arg name="date"><space/>Summer 1988<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate"><space/>2010-05-15<space/></arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="jayminer"><template><target>Wayback</target><arg name="date">20040703222312<space/></arg><arg name="url">http://www.heartbone.com/comphist/JayMiner.html<space/></arg><arg name="title">Jay G.

The color hardware supports two different resolutions, 320 200 with 16 out of 512 colors, or 640 200 with 4 out of 512 colors. The monochrome monitor was less expensive and has a single resolution of 640 400. Due to its higher vertical resolution and noninterlaced operation at 70&amp;nbsp;Hz, the monochrome monitor was better suited to business applications. The attached monitor determines available resolutions, so software either supports both types of monitors or only works with one.<extension extension_name='ref' name="byte198601"><template><target>cite news</target><arg name="title">The Atari ST<space/></arg><arg name="work">BYTE<space/></arg><arg name="date">January 1986<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">4 November 2013<space/></arg><arg name="author">Edwards, Jon R.; Robinson, Phillip; McLaughlin, Brenda<space/></arg><arg name="pages">84</arg></template></extension><space/>Color is required by a majority of games.

Later drives were double-sided versions that stored 720&amp;nbsp;kB. Due to the early sales of so many of the single-sided drives, some commercial software, particularly games, shipped by default on single-sided disks, even supplying two 360kB floppies instead of a single double-sided one, for fear of alienating<space/><link><target>early adopter</target><trail>s</trail></link><template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">March 2014</arg></template>. The problem was exacerbated by the early drive's single read/write head being on the &quot;wrong&quot; side of the disc - that is, reading/writing the same side of the disc as a more standard 720kB drive's &quot;second&quot; head (&quot;head 1&quot;) instead of its &quot;first&quot; (&quot;head 0&quot;). The boot sector and FAT was typically written to &quot;side 0&quot; by double-sided drives (in both STs and other marques fitted with 3.5&quot; drives), so owners of single-sided machines could not read any useful data from a standard double-sided disc at all, not even the root directory listing, and might well mistakenly end up reformatting just one side of a seemingly &quot;faulty&quot; disc as a result.</paragraph><paragraph>ST magazines wishing to cater to the entire audience while still supplying a large amount of material on a single cover disc had to adopt innovative custom formats to work around this problem, forcing the bootsector and FAT onto &quot;side 1&quot;, along with the disc's main feature program, and tucking supplemental programs onto &quot;side 0&quot; (typically falsely renamed &quot;side B&quot;, in allusion to classic 45rpm singles), &quot;inside&quot; a particular file folder which would only open successfully for owners of 720kB drives. Owners of single-sided drives were encouraged, if they wished to gain access to &quot;side B&quot;, to send the original coverdisk(s) back to the publisher with a token fee for postage and duplication, for which they would be sent a set of single-sided discs containing the full software complement. This scheme was also operated by some producers of productivity software in later years, mirroring the PC situation where software would ship by default on a particular disc format (3.5&quot; or 5.25&quot;, double or high density) and a customer who bought the wrong type could have it replaced by mail order.</paragraph><paragraph>Another early sticking point with the ST's floppy drives was that, whilst double-sided drive equipped STs could happily read discs formatted under MS-DOS on IBM PCs, PCs could not themselves read Atari disks, because the initial versions of TOS could recognise, read, and write to - but not themselves create - discs in the same particular specification used and indeed demanded by MS-DOS (single-sided Atari drives were completely incompatible in either direction, as MS-DOS never officially supported single-sided 3.5&quot; hardware, and still placed its filesystem information on &quot;side 0&quot;).<template><target>clarify</target><arg name="date">April 2014</arg></template><space/>Achieving successful data interchange between the two platforms using floppies thus required pre-formatting dedicated file transfer discs under MS-DOS, and copying the necessary data onto them from any unsuitable Atari formatted discs. This formatting issue was soon resolved by the emergence of third-party formatting and file copier software, MS-DOS disc imaging software capable of reading the unusual formats used by the ST and various other machines (such as the Commodore Amiga) and, a few years later, Atari's own version 1.4 (and later) TOS upgrades.</paragraph><heading level='3'>STF and STFM models</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Atari ST 1040.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Atari 1040ST<xhtml:sup>F</xhtml:sup></part></link></paragraph><paragraph>Atari later upgraded the basic design in 1986 with the<space/><italics>1040ST<xhtml:sup>F</xhtml:sup></italics><space/>(also written<space/><italics>STF</italics>).

Apart from these frequencies, it is also able to play the STE sample frequencies (up to 50066&amp;nbsp;Hz) in 8 or 16 bit, mono/stereo, all by using the same DMA interface as the STE, with a few additions. The Falcon can both play back and record samples; it has 8 mono channels / 4 stereo channels; thus this allowed musicians to use the computer for harddisk recording. Although the 68030 microprocessor is capable of using 32-bit memory, the Falcon uses a 16-bit bus which affects performance, but also served to reduce its cost. In another cost-reduction measure, Atari shipped the Falcon in an inexpensive case much like that of the ST<xhtml:sup>F</xhtml:sup><space/>and ST<xhtml:sup>E</xhtml:sup>.

(This change was also greatly welcomed as older ST machines with memory below 512 kB suffered, as GEM loaded its entire 192 kB code into RAM when booting the desktop). Having the OS loaded from disk was due to Atari trying to rush the machines to market without ironing out all the bugs in the OS. Soon after this change, most production models became ST<xhtml:sup>F</xhtml:sup>s, with an integrated single- (520STF/512 kB RAM) or double-sided (1040STF/1024 kB RAM) double density floppy disk drive built-in, but no other changes.
