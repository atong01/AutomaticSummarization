[[File:Gyroskop.jpg|thumb|right|This [[gyroscope]] remains upright while spinning due to the conservation of its angular momentum.]]

In [[physics]], '''angular momentum''' (rarely, '''moment of momentum''' or '''rotational momentum''') is the rotational analog of [[linear momentum]]. It is an important quantity in physics because it is a [[Conservation law|conserved quantity]] – the angular momentum of a system remains constant unless acted on by an external [[torque]].

Angular momentum is related to the [[rotation]] or revolution of [[matter]]. It is, in effect, a measure of the quantity of rotation of a system of matter, taking into account its [[mass]], [[angular velocity|rotations]], [[Motion (physics)|motions]] and [[shape]]. The conservation of angular momentum explains many observed phenomena.  For example, the increase in rotational speed of a spinning [[figure skater]] as the skater's arms are contracted, the high rotational rates of [[neutron star]]s, the [[falling cat problem]] and [[precession]] can all be explained in terms of angular momentum conservation. It has numerous applications in physics, engineering and everyday life, for instance, the [[gyrocompass]], [[control moment gyroscope]], [[Inertial navigation system|inertial guidance systems]], [[reaction wheel]]s, [[top]]s, [[Flying disc|flying discs or Frisbees]] and [[Earth's rotation]].

==== Scalar — angular momentum in two dimensions ====
[[File:Ang mom 2d.png|right|thumb|[[Velocity]] of the [[particle]] ''m'' with respect to the origin ''O'' can be resolved into components parallel to (''v''<sub>//</sub>) and perpendicular to (''v''<sub>⊥</sub>) the radius vector ''r''. The '''angular momentum''' of ''m'' is proportional to the [[perpendicular component]] ''v''<sub>⊥</sub> of the velocity, or equivalently, to the perpendicular distance ''r''<sub>⊥</sub> from the origin.]]

Angular momentum is a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantity (more precisely, a [[pseudovector]]) that represents the product of a body's [[Moment of inertia|rotational inertia]] and [[Angular velocity|rotational velocity]] about a particular axis. In the simple case of revolution of a [[particle]] in a [[circle]] about a center of rotation, the particle remaining always in the same [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] and having always the same distance from the center, it is sufficient to discard the [[Euclidean vector|vector]] nature of angular momentum, and treat it as a [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]].<ref name="Wilson">{{cite book

Unlike mass, which depends only on amount of matter, moment of inertia is also dependent on the position of the axis of rotation and the shape of the matter. Unlike linear speed, which occurs in a straight line, angular speed occurs about a center of rotation.

Because <math>I=r^2m</math> for a single particle and <math>\omega=v/r</math> for circular motion, angular momentum can be expanded, <math>L=(r^2m)\left ( \frac{v}{r} \right ) ,</math> and reduced to,

This simple analysis can also apply to non-circular motion if only the component of the motion which is [[perpendicular]] to the [[Position (vector)|radius vector]] is considered. In that case,

where <math>v_\perp = v\sin\theta</math> is the perpendicular component of the motion. Expanding, <math>L=rmv\sin{\theta}, </math> rearranging, <math>L=r\sin{\theta}mv, </math> and reducing, angular momentum can also be expressed,

where <math>r_\perp = r\sin{\theta}</math> is the length of the [[Torque#Moment arm formula|''moment arm'']], a line dropped perpendicularly from the origin onto the path of the particle.

[[File:Torque animation.gif|frame|right|Relationship between [[force]] ('''F'''), [[torque]] (τ), [[momentum]] ('''p'''), and angular momentum ('''L''') vectors in a rotating system. (r) is the radius.]]

To completely define angular momentum in [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]], it is required to know the [[Angular velocity|angle swept out in unit time]], the direction of the axis of rotation, and the sense (right- or left-handed) of the rotation, as well as the [[mass]] involved.<ref>{{cite book

In [[vector notation]], the angular momentum of a [[Point particle|particle]] in motion about the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin of coordinates]] is defined as:

:<math>\mathbf{L} =  I\boldsymbol{\omega},</math> where

::<math>I=r^2m</math> is the [[moment of inertia]] for a [[Point particle|point mass]],

::<math>\boldsymbol{\omega}=\frac{\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{v}}{r^2}</math> is the [[angular velocity]] of the particle about the origin,

::<math>\mathbf{r}</math> is the [[Position (vector)|position vector]] of the particle relative to the origin, <math>r=\left\vert\mathbf{r}\right\vert</math>,

::<math>\mathbf{v}</math> is the [[velocity|linear velocity]] of the particle relative to the origin,

::and <math>m</math> is the [[mass]] of the particle.

This can be expanded, <math>\mathbf{L}=(r^2m)\left(\frac{\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{v}}{r^2}\right),</math> reduced, <math>\mathbf{L} = m(\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{v}),</math>
and by the rules of [[Vector calculus|vector algebra]] rearranged to the form,
:<math>\begin{align}\mathbf{L}&=\mathbf{r}\times m\mathbf{v}\\ &= \mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{p}, \end{align}</math>
which is the [[cross product]] of the position vector <math>\mathbf{r}</math> and the linear momentum <math>\mathbf{p}=m\mathbf{v}</math> of the particle. By the definition of the cross product, the <math>\mathbf{L}</math> vector is [[perpendicular]] to both <math>\mathbf{r}</math> and <math>\mathbf{p}</math>. It is directed along the axis of rotation as indicated by the [[right-hand rule]] – so that the rotation is seen as [[clockwise|counter-clockwise]] from the head of the vector. Conversely, the <math>\mathbf{L}</math> vector defines the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] in which <math>\mathbf{r}</math> and <math>\mathbf{p}</math> lie.

By defining a [[unit vector]] <math>\mathbf{\hat{u}}</math> in the direction of the axis of rotation, a [[angular frequency|scalar angular speed]] <math>\omega</math> results, where
:<math>\omega\mathbf{\hat{u}}=\boldsymbol{\omega},</math> and
:<math>\omega=\frac{v_{\perp}}{r},</math> where <math>v_{\perp}</math> is the perpendicular component of the motion, as above.
The two-dimensional scalar equations of the previous section can thus be given direction:
:<math>\begin{align}\mathbf{L}&=I\boldsymbol{\omega}\\
&=I\omega\mathbf{\hat{u}}\\
&=(r^2m)\omega\mathbf{\hat{u}}\\
&=rmv_{\perp}\mathbf{\hat{u}}\\
&=r_{\perp}mv\mathbf{\hat{u}},
\end{align}</math>
and <math>\mathbf{L}=rmv\mathbf{\hat{u}}</math> for circular motion, where all of the motion is perpendicular to the radius <math>r</math>.

=== Discussion ===
Angular momentum can be described as the rotational analog of [[linear momentum]]. Like linear momentum it involves elements of [[mass]] and [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]]. Unlike linear momentum it also involves elements of [[Position (vector)|position]] and [[shape]].

Many problems in physics involve matter in motion about some certain point in space, be it in actual rotation about it, or simply moving past it, where it is desired to know what effect the moving matter has on the point — can it exert energy upon it or perform work about it? [[Energy]], the ability to do [[Work (physics)|work]], can be stored in matter by setting it in motion — a combination of its [[inertia]] and its displacement. Inertia is measured by its [[mass]], and displacement by its [[velocity]]. Their product,

:<math>\begin{align}
(\text{amount of inertia}) \times (\text{amount of displacement})&=\text{amount of (inertia·displacement)}\\
\text{mass} \times \text{velocity} &= \text{momentum}\\
m \times v &= p\\
\end{align}
</math>

is the matter's [[momentum]].<ref>{{cite book

For instance, a particle of matter at the outer edge of a wheel is, in effect, at the end of a [[lever]] of the same length as the wheel's radius, its momentum turning the lever about the center point. This imaginary lever is known as the ''moment arm''. It has the effect of multiplying the momentum's effort in proportion to its length, an effect known as a [[Moment (physics)|''moment''.]] Hence, the particle's momentum referred to a particular point,

:<math>\begin{align}
(\text{moment arm}) \times (\text{amount of inertia}) \times (\text{amount of displacement})&=\text{moment of (inertia·displacement)}\\
\text{length} \times \text{mass} \times \text{velocity} &= \text{moment of momentum}\\
r \times m \times v &= L\\
\end{align}
</math>

is the ''angular momentum'', sometimes called, as here, the ''moment of momentum'' of the particle versus that particular center point. The equation <math>L=rmv</math> combines a moment (a mass <math>m</math> turning moment arm <math>r</math>) with a linear (straight-line equivalent) speed <math>v</math>. Linear speed referred to the central point is simply the product of the distance <math>r</math> and the angular speed <math>\omega</math> versus the point: <math>v=r\omega,</math> another moment. Hence, angular momentum contains a double moment: <math>L=rmr\omega.</math> Simplifying slightly, <math>L=r^2m\omega,</math> the quantity <math>r^2m</math> is the particle's [[moment of inertia]], sometimes called the second moment of mass. It is a measure of rotational inertia.<ref>{{cite book

[[File:Moment of inertia examples.gif|thumb|right|[[Moment of inertia]] (shown here), and therefore angular momentum, is different for every possible configuration of [[mass]] and [[Rotation around a fixed axis|axis of rotation]].]]

Because rotational inertia is a part of angular momentum, it necessarily includes all of the complications of [[moment of inertia]], which is calculated by multiplying elementary bits of the mass by the [[Square (algebra)|squares]] of their [[distances]] from the center of rotation.<ref name="Oberg">{{cite book

For a [[rigid body]], for instance a wheel or an asteroid, the orientation of rotation is simply the position of the [[Rotation around a fixed axis|rotation axis]] versus the matter of the body. It may or may not pass through the [[center of mass]], or it may lie completely outside of the body. For the same body, angular momentum may take a different value for every possible axis about which rotation may take place.<ref>{{cite book

For a collection of objects revolving about a center, for instance all of the bodies of the [[Solar System]], the orientations may be somewhat organized, as is the Solar System, with most of the bodies' axes lying close to the system's axis. Their orientations may also be completely random.

In brief, the more mass and the farther it is from the center of rotation (the longer the [[Torque#Moment arm formula|moment arm]]), the greater the moment of inertia, and therefore the greater the angular momentum for a given [[angular velocity]]. In many cases the [[moment of inertia]], and hence the angular momentum, can be simplified by,<ref>{{cite book

Angular momentum's dependence on position and shape is reflected in its [[Units of measurement|units]] versus linear momentum: [[SI derived unit|kg·m<sup>2</sup>/s]], [[SI derived unit|N·m·s]]  or [[SI derived unit|J·s]] for angular momentum versus [[SI derived unit|kg·m/s]] or [[SI derived unit|N·s]] for linear momentum. Angular momentum's units can be interpreted as [[torque]]·seconds, [[Work (physics)|work]]·seconds, or [[energy]]·seconds.

==== Angular momentum and torque ====
{{See also|Torque#Definition and relation to angular momentum}}
[[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's second law|Newton's Second Law of Motion]] can be expressed mathematically,
:<math>\mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a},</math>
or [[Force]] = [[mass]] × [[acceleration]]. The rotational equivalent is
:<math>\boldsymbol{\tau} = I\boldsymbol{\alpha},</math>
or [[torque]] = [[moment of inertia]] × [[angular acceleration]]. Because angular acceleration is the time [[derivative]] of [[angular velocity]], this is equivalent to <math>\boldsymbol{\tau} = I\frac{d\boldsymbol{\omega}}{dt}.</math> Rearranging into a form suitable for [[Integral|integration]], <math>\boldsymbol{\tau} = \frac{d(I\boldsymbol{\omega})}{dt}</math> and <math>\boldsymbol{\tau}dt = d(I\boldsymbol{\omega}),</math> and integrating with respect to time,
:<math>\int \boldsymbol{\tau}dt = I\boldsymbol{\omega} + constant.</math>
Therefore, a torque acting over time is equivalent to a [[Angular momentum#Vector – angular momentum in three dimensions|change in angular momentum]]. The constant can be interpreted as the initial angular momentum of the body, before the torque began to act. In particular, if torque <math>\boldsymbol{\tau} = \mathbf{0},</math> then angular momentum <math>\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{0} + constant.</math><ref>{{cite book

:<math>\mathbf{L} = I\boldsymbol{\omega}</math>
or Angular momentum = [[moment of inertia]] × [[angular velocity]], and its time [[derivative]] is
:<math>\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \frac{dI}{dt}\boldsymbol{\omega} + I\frac{d\boldsymbol{\omega}}{dt}. </math>

Because moment of inertia is constant, <math>\frac{dI}{dt}</math> is zero, and <math>\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = 0 + I\frac{d\boldsymbol{\omega}}{dt},</math> which, as above, reduces to

:<math>\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = I\boldsymbol{\alpha}.</math>
Therefore, the time rate of change of angular momentum is equivalent to [[torque]]. If angular momentum is constant, <math>\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = 0</math> and no torque is applied.

The conservation of angular momentum is used in analyzing [[Classical central-force problem|''central force motion'']]. If the net force on some body is directed always toward some point, the ''center'', then there is no torque on the body with respect to the center, as all of the force is directed along the [[Position (vector)|radius vector]], and none is [[perpendicular]] to the radius. Mathematically, torque <math>\boldsymbol{\tau} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F} = \mathbf{0}, </math> because in this case <math>\mathbf{r}</math> and <math>\mathbf{F}</math> are parallel vectors. Therefore, the angular momentum of the body about the center is constant. This is the case with [[gravity|gravitational attraction]] in the [[orbit]]s of [[planet]]s and [[satellite]]s, where the gravitational force is always directed toward the primary body and orbiting bodies conserve angular momentum by exchanging distance and velocity as they move about the primary. Central force motion is also used in the analysis of the [[Bohr model]] of the [[atom]].

For a planet, angular momentum is distributed between the spin of the planet and its revolution in its orbit, and these are often exchanged by various mechanisms. The conservation of angular momentum in the [[Lunar theory|Earth–Moon system]] results in the transfer of angular momentum from Earth to Moon, due to [[Tidal acceleration|tidal torque]] the Moon exerts on the Earth. This in turn results in the slowing down of the rotation rate of Earth, at about 65.7 nanoseconds per day,<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/313/1524/47

[[File:PrecessionOfATop.svg|thumb|right|250px|The [[torque]] caused by the two opposing forces '''F'''<sub>g</sub> and −'''F'''<sub>g</sub> causes a change in the angular momentum '''L''' in the direction of that torque (since torque is the time derivative of angular momentum). This causes the top to [[precess]].]]

The conservation of angular momentum explains the angular acceleration of an [[Ice skating|ice skater]] as she brings her arms and legs close to the vertical axis of rotation. By bringing part of the mass of her body closer to the axis she decreases her body's moment of inertia. Because angular momentum is the product of [[moment of inertia]] and [[angular velocity]], if the angular momentum remains constant (is conserved), then the angular velocity (rotational speed) of the skater must increase.

The same phenomenon results in extremely fast spin of compact stars (like [[white dwarf]]s, [[neutron star]]s and [[black hole]]s) when they are formed out of much larger and slower rotating stars. Decrease in the size of an object ''n'' times results in increase of its angular velocity by the factor of ''n''<sup>2</sup>.

=== Angular momentum in orbital mechanics ===
{{Main|Specific relative angular momentum}}
In astrodynamics and [[celestial mechanics]], a ''massless'' (or ''per unit mass'') angular momentum is defined
:<math>\mathbf{h} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{v}, </math>
called ''[[Specific relative angular momentum|specific angular momentum]]''. Note that <math>\mathbf{L} = m\mathbf{h}.</math> [[Mass]] is often unimportant in orbital mechanics calculations, because motion is defined by [[gravity]]. The primary body of the system is often so much larger than any bodies in motion about it that the smaller bodies have a negligible gravitational effect on it; it is, in effect, stationary. All bodies are apparently attracted by its gravity in the same way, regardless of mass, and therefore all move approximately the same way under the same conditions.

=== Solid bodies ===
For a continuous mass distribution with [[density]] function ''ρ''('''r'''), a differential [[volume element]] ''dV'' with [[position vector]] '''r''' within the mass has a mass element ''dm'' = ''ρ''('''r''')''dV''. Therefore the [[infinitesimal]] angular momentum of this element is:

:<math>d\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r}\times dm \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{r}\times \rho(\mathbf{r}) dV \mathbf{v} = dV \mathbf{r}\times \rho(\mathbf{r}) \mathbf{v}</math>

and [[volume integral|integrating]] this [[differential (infinitesimal)|differential]] over the volume of the entire mass gives its total angular momentum:

:<math>\mathbf{L}=\int_V dV \mathbf{r}\times \rho(\mathbf{r}) \mathbf{v}</math>

=== Collection of particles ===

==== Center of mass ====
[[File:Ang mom vector diagram.png|thumb|The angular momentum of the particles ''i'' is the sum of the cross products '''R''' x ''M'''''V''' + Σ'''r'''<sub>''i''</sub> x ''m<sub>i</sub>'''''v'''<sub>''i''</sub>.]]

It is convenient to develop the equation of angular momentum for a collection of particles in motion about an arbitrary origin by resolving their motion into components about their own center of mass and about the origin. Given,
: <math>m_i</math> is the mass of particle <math>i</math>,
: <math>\mathbf{R}_i</math> is the position vector of particle <math>i</math> vs the origin,
: <math>\mathbf{V}_i</math> is the velocity of particle <math>i</math> vs the origin,
: <math>\mathbf{R}</math> is the position vector of the center of mass vs the origin,
: <math>\mathbf{V}</math> is the velocity of the center of mass vs the origin,
: <math>\mathbf{r}_i</math> is the position vector of particle <math>i</math> vs the center of mass,
: <math>\mathbf{v}_i</math> is the velocity of particle <math>i</math> vs the center of mass,

The total mass of the particles is simply their sum,
:<math>M=\sum_i m_i.</math>

The position vector of the center of mass is defined by,<ref>{{cite book

The first term is the angular momentum of the center of mass relative to the origin. Similar to [[Angular momentum#Single particle|'''Single particle''']], below, it is the angular momentum of one particle of mass ''M'' at the center of mass moving with velocity '''V'''. The second term is the angular momentum of the particles moving relative to the center of mass, similar to [[Angular momentum#Fixed center of mass|'''Fixed center of mass''']], below. The result is general — the motion of the particles is not restricted to rotation or revolution about the origin or center of mass. The particles need not be individual masses, but can be elements of a continuous distribution, such as a solid body.

Rearranging equation ({{EquationNote|2}}) by vector identities, multiplying both terms by "one", and grouping appropriately,

:<math>\begin{align}\mathbf{L} &= M(\mathbf{R} \times \mathbf{V}) + \sum_i [m_i(\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{v}_i)],\\

&= R^2M \left ( \frac{\mathbf{R} \times \mathbf{V}}{R^2} \right ) + \sum_i \left [ r_i^2m_i \left ( \frac{\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{v}_i}{r_i^2} \right ) \right ] ,\\

gives the total angular momentum of the system of particles in terms of [[moment of inertia]] <math>I</math> and [[angular velocity]] <math>\boldsymbol{\omega}</math>,

== Angular momentum (modern definition) ==
[[File:Angular momentum bivector and pseudovector.svg|275px|thumb|The 3-angular momentum as a [[bivector]] (plane element) and [[axial vector]], of a particle of mass ''m'' with instantaneous 3-position '''x''' and 3-momentum '''p'''.]]

In modern (20th century) theoretical physics, angular momentum (not including any intrinsic angular momentum – see [[#Angular momentum in quantum mechanics|below]]) is described using a different formalism, instead of a classical pseudovector. In this formalism, angular momentum is the [[2-form]] [[Noether charge]] associated with rotational invariance. As a result, angular momentum is not conserved for general [[curved space]]times, unless it happens to be asymptotically rotationally invariant.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In classical mechanics, the angular momentum of a particle can be reinterpreted as a plane element:

:<math>\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r} \wedge \mathbf{p} \,, </math>

in which the [[exterior product]] ∧ replaces the [[cross product]] × (these products have similar characteristics but are nonequivalent). This has the advantage of a clearer geometric interpretation as a plane element, defined from the '''x''' and '''p'''  vectors, and the expression is true in any number of dimensions (two or higher). In Cartesian coordinates:

:<math> \begin{array}{rl}\mathbf{L} & =\left(xp_{y}-yp_{x}\right)\mathbf{e}_{x}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{y}+\left(yp_{z}-zp_{y}\right)\mathbf{e}_{y}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{z}+\left(zp_{x}-xp_{z}\right)\mathbf{e}_{z}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{x}\\ & =L_{xy}\mathbf{e}_{x}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{y}+L_{yz}\mathbf{e}_{y}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{z}+L_{zx}\mathbf{e}_{z}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{x} \,, \end{array} </math>

or more compactly in index notation:

:<math>L_{ij}=x_{i}p_{j}-x_{j}p_{i}\,.</math>

The angular velocity can also be defined as an antisymmetric second order tensor, with components ''ω<sub>ij</sub>''. The relation between the two antisymmetric tensors is given by the moment of inertia which must now be a fourth order tensor:<ref>Synge and Schild, Tensor calculus, Dover publications, 1978 edition, p. 161.  ISBN 978-0-486-63612-2.</ref>

:<math>L_{ij} = I_{ijk\ell} \omega_{k\ell} \,. </math>

Again, this equation in '''L''' and '''ω''' as tensors is true in any number of dimensions. This equation also appears in the [[geometric algebra]] formalism, in which '''L''' and '''ω''' are bivectors, and the moment of inertia is a mapping between them.

In [[relativistic mechanics]], the [[relativistic angular momentum]] of a particle is expressed as an [[antisymmetric tensor]] of second order:

:<math> M_{\alpha\beta} = X_\alpha\ P_\beta - X_\beta P_\alpha </math>

in the language of [[four-vector]]s, namely the [[Four-position|four position]] ''X'' and the [[four momentum]] ''P'', and absorbs the above '''L''' together with the motion of the [[centre of mass]] of the particle.

In each of the above cases, for a system of particles, the total angular momentum is just the sum of the individual particle angular momenta, and the centre of mass is for the system.

== Angular momentum in quantum mechanics ==
{{Main|Angular momentum operator}}
Angular momentum in [[quantum mechanics]] differs in many profound respects from angular momentum in [[classical mechanics]]. In [[relativistic quantum mechanics#Relativistic quantum angular momentum|relativistic quantum mechanics]], it differs even more, in which the above relativistic definition becomes a tensorial operator.

=== Spin, orbital, and total angular momentum ===
{{Main|Spin (physics)}}

[[File:Classical angular momentum.svg|350px|thumb|Angular momenta of a ''classical'' object.<br /><br />'''Left:''' "spin" angular momentum '''S''' is really orbital angular momentum of the object at every point,<br /><br />'''right:''' extrinsic orbital angular momentum '''L''' about an axis,<br /><br />'''top:''' the [[moment of inertia tensor]] '''I''' and [[angular velocity]] '''ω''' ('''L''' is not always parallel to '''ω'''),<ref>{{cite book|title=Feynman's Lectures on Physics (volume 2)|author=R.P. Feynman, R.B. Leighton, M. Sands|publisher=Addison–Wesley|year=1964|pages=31–7|isbn=978-0-201-02117-2}}</ref><br /><br />'''bottom:''' momentum '''p''' and its radial position '''r''' from the axis.</p> The total angular momentum (spin plus orbital) is '''J'''. For a ''quantum'' particle the interpretations are different; [[spin (physics)|particle spin]] does ''not'' have the above interpretation.]]

The classical definition of angular momentum as <math>\mathbf{L}=\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{p}</math> can be carried over to quantum mechanics, by reinterpreting '''r''' as the quantum [[position operator]] and '''p''' as the quantum [[momentum operator]]. '''L''' is then an [[Operator (physics)|operator]], specifically called the ''[[angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum operator]]''.

However, in quantum physics, there is another type of angular momentum, called ''[[spin (physics)|spin angular momentum]]'', represented by the spin operator '''S'''. Almost all [[elementary particle]]s have spin. Spin is often depicted as a particle literally spinning around an axis, but this is a misleading and inaccurate picture: spin is an intrinsic property of a particle, unrelated to any sort of motion in space and fundamentally different from orbital angular momentum. All [[elementary particles]] have a characteristic spin, for example [[electron]]s always have "spin 1/2" (this actually means "spin [[reduced Planck constant|ħ]]/2") while [[photon]]s always have "spin 1" (this actually means "spin ħ").

Finally, there is [[total angular momentum]] '''J''', which combines both the spin and orbital angular momentum of all particles and fields. (For one particle, '''J''' = '''L''' + '''S'''.) [[Conservation of angular momentum]] applies to '''J''', but not to '''L''' or '''S'''; for example, the [[spin–orbit interaction]] allows angular momentum to transfer back and forth between '''L''' and '''S''', with the total remaining constant.

=== Quantization ===
In [[quantum mechanics]], angular momentum is [[angular momentum quantization|quantized]] – that is, it cannot vary continuously, but only in "[[Quantum number|quantum leaps]]" between certain allowed values. For any system, the following restrictions on measurement results apply, where <math>\hbar</math> is the [[reduced Planck constant]] and <math>\hat{n}</math> is any [[direction vector]] such as x, y, or z:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
|'''If you [[measurement in quantum mechanics|measure]]...'''
|'''The result can be...'''
|-
|<math>L_{\hat{n}}</math>
|<math>\ldots, -2\hbar, -\hbar, 0, \hbar, 2\hbar, \ldots</math>
|-
|<math>S_{\hat{n}}</math> or <math>J_{\hat{n}}</math>
|<math>\ldots, -\frac{3}{2}\hbar, -\hbar, -\frac{1}{2}\hbar, 0, \frac{1}{2}\hbar, \hbar, \frac{3}{2}\hbar, \ldots</math>
|-
|<math>L^2</math> <br /> (<math>= L_x^2+L_y^2+L_z^2</math>)
|<math>(\hbar^2 n(n+1))</math>, where <math>n=0,1,2,\ldots</math>
|-
|<math>S^2</math> or <math>J^2</math>
|<math>(\hbar^2 n(n+1))</math>, where <math>n=0,\frac{1}{2},1,\frac{3}{2}, \ldots</math>
|}
[[File:Circular Standing Wave.gif|thumb|right|In this [[standing wave]] on a circular string, the circle is broken into exactly 8 [[wavelength]]s. A standing wave like this can have 0,1,2, or any integer number of wavelengths around the circle, but it ''cannot'' have a non-integer number of wavelengths like 8.3. In quantum mechanics, angular momentum is quantized for a similar reason.]]
(There are additional restrictions as well, see [[angular momentum operator]] for details.)

The [[reduced Planck constant]] <math>\hbar</math> is tiny by everyday standards, about 10<sup>−34</sup> [[Joule-second|J s]], and therefore this quantization does not noticeably affect the angular momentum of macroscopic objects. However, it is very important in the microscopic world. For example, the structure of [[electron shell]]s and subshells in chemistry is significantly affected by the quantization of angular momentum.

Quantization of angular momentum was first postulated by [[Niels Bohr]] in his [[Bohr model]] of the atom and was later predicted by [[Erwin Schrödinger]] in his [[Schrödinger equation#Quantization|Schrödinger equation]].

=== Uncertainty ===
In the definition <math>\mathbf{L}=\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{p}</math>, six operators are involved: The [[position operator]]s <math>r_x</math>, <math>r_y</math>, <math>r_z</math>, and the [[momentum operator]]s <math>p_x</math>, <math>p_y</math>, <math>p_z</math>. However, the [[uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] tells us that it is not possible for all six of these quantities to be known simultaneously with arbitrary precision. Therefore, there are limits to what can be known or measured about a particle's angular momentum. It turns out that the best that one can do is to simultaneously measure both the angular momentum vector's [[magnitude (vector)|magnitude]] and its component along one axis.

The uncertainty is closely related to the fact that different components of an [[angular momentum operator]] do not [[commutator|commute]], for example <math>L_xL_y \neq L_yL_x</math>. (For the precise [[commutation relation]]s, see [[angular momentum operator]].)

=== Total angular momentum as generator of rotations ===
As mentioned above, orbital angular momentum '''L''' is defined as in classical mechanics: <math>\mathbf{L}=\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{p}</math>, but ''total'' angular momentum '''J''' is defined in a different, more basic way: '''J''' is defined as the "generator of rotations".<ref name=littlejohn>{{cite web|url=http://bohr.physics.berkeley.edu/classes/221/1011/notes/spinrot.pdf|title= Lecture notes on rotations in quantum mechanics|first= Robert |last=Littlejohn|accessdate= 13 Jan 2012|work=Physics 221B Spring 2011|year=2011}}</ref> More specifically, '''J''' is defined so that the operator
:<math>R(\hat{n},\phi) \equiv \exp\left(-\frac{i}{\hbar}\phi\, \mathbf{J}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}\right)</math>
is the [[Rotation operator (quantum mechanics)|rotation operator]] that takes any system and rotates it by angle <math>\phi</math> about the axis <math>\hat{\mathbf{n}}</math>. (The "exp" in the formula refers to [[matrix exponential|operator exponential]])

The relationship between the angular momentum operator and the rotation operators is the same as the relationship between [[lie algebra]]s and [[lie group]]s in mathematics. The close relationship between angular momentum and rotations is reflected in [[Noether's theorem]] that proves that angular momentum is conserved whenever the laws of physics are rotationally invariant.

== Angular momentum in electrodynamics ==
{{See also|Momentum#Particle in field|l1=Momentum (Particle in field)}}

When describing the motion of a [[charged particle]] in an [[electromagnetic field]], the [[canonical momentum]] '''P''' (derived from the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] for this system) is not [[gauge invariant]]. As a consequence, the canonical angular momentum '''L''' = '''r''' × '''P''' is not gauge invariant either. Instead, the momentum that is physical, the so-called ''kinetic momentum'' (used throughout this article), is (in [[SI units]])

:<math> \mathbf{p} = m\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{P} - e \mathbf{A} </math>

where ''e'' is the [[electric charge]] of the particle and '''A''' the [[magnetic vector potential]] of the electromagnetic field. The [[Gauge theory|gauge-invariant]] angular momentum, that is ''kinetic angular momentum'', is given by

:<math>\mathbf{K}= \mathbf{r} \times ( \mathbf{P} - e\mathbf{A} )</math>

The interplay with quantum mechanics is discussed further in the article on [[canonical commutation relation]]s.

== History ==
[[Isaac Newton|Newton]], in the [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|''Principia'']], hinted at angular momentum in his examples of the [[Newton's laws of motion|First Law of Motion]],
:''A top, whose parts by their cohesion are perpetually drawn aside from rectilinear motions, does not cease its rotation, otherwise than as it is retarded by the air. The greater bodies of the planets and comets, meeting with less resistance in more free spaces, preserve their motions both progressive and circular for a much longer time.''<ref>{{cite book
|last1 = Newton
|first1 = Isaac
|title = The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy
|publisher = H. D. Symonds, London
|others=Andrew Motte, translator
|date=1803
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=exwAAAAAQAAJ|chapter=Axioms; or Laws of Motion, Law I|via=Google books}}</ref>

He did not further investigate angular momentum directly in the ''Principia'',
:''From such kind of reflexions also sometimes arise the circular motions of bodies about their own centres. But these are cases which I do not consider in what follows; and it would be too tedious to demostrate every particular that relates to this subject.''<ref>Newton, Axioms; or Laws of Motion, Corollary III</ref>
However, his geometric proof of the [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Second law|Law of Areas]] is an outstanding example of Newton's genius, and indirectly proves angular momentum conservation in the case of a [[central force]].

=== The Law of Areas ===
{{Main|Classical central-force problem|Areal velocity}}

==== Newton's derivation ====
[[File:Newton area law derivation.gif|frame|right|Newton's derivation of the area law using geometric means.]]

As a [[planet]] orbits the [[Sun]], the line between the Sun and the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time. This had been known since [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] expounded his [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Second Law of Planetary Motion]]. Newton derived a unique geometric proof, and went on to show that the attractive force of the Sun's [[gravity]] was the cause of all of Kepler's laws.

During the first interval of time, an object is in motion from point '''A''' to point '''B'''. Undisturbed, it would continue to point '''c''' during the second interval. When the object arrives at '''B''', it receives an impulse directed toward point '''S'''. The impulse gives it a small added velocity toward '''S''', such that if this were its only velocity, it would move from '''B''' to '''V''' during the second interval. By the [[Parallelogram of force|rules of velocity composition]], these two velocities add, and point '''C''' is found by construction of parallelogram '''BcCV'''. Thus the object's path is deflected by the impulse so that it arrives at point '''C''' at the end of the second interval. Because the triangles '''SBc''' and '''SBC''' have the same base '''SB''' and the same height '''Bc''' or '''VC''', they have the same area. By symmetry, triangle '''SBc''' also has the same area as triangle '''SAB''', therefore the object has swept out equal areas '''SAB''' and '''SBC''' in equal times.

At point '''C''', the object receives another impulse toward '''S''', again deflecting its path during the third interval from '''d''' to '''D'''. Thus it continues to '''E''' and beyond, the triangles '''SAB''', '''SBc''', '''SBC''', '''SCd''', '''SCD''', '''SDe''', '''SDE''' all having the same area. Allowing the time intervals to become ever smaller, the path '''ABCDE''' approaches indefinitely close to a continuous curve.

Note that because this derivation is geometric, and no specific force is applied, it proves a more general law than Kepler's Second Law of Planetary Motion. It shows that the Law of Areas applies to any central force, attractive or repulsive, continuous or non-continuous, or zero.

==== Conservation of angular momentum in the Law of Areas ====
The proportionality of angular momentum to the area swept out by a moving object can be understood by realizing that the bases of the triangles, that is, the lines from '''S''' to the object, are equivalent to the [[Angular momentum#Scalar – angular momentum in two dimensions|radius {{math|<var>r</var>}}]], and that the heights of the triangles are proportional to the perpendicular component of [[Angular momentum#Scalar – angular momentum in two dimensions|velocity {{math|<VAR>v</var><sub>⊥</sub>}}]]. Hence, if the area swept per unit time is constant, then by the triangular area formula {{math|<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>(base)(height)}}, the product {{math|(base)(height)}} and therefore the product {{math|<VAR>rv</var><sub>⊥</sub>}} are constant: if {{math|<VAR>r</var>}} and the base length are decreased, {{math|<VAR>v</var><sub>⊥</sub>}} and height must increase proportionally. Mass is constant, therefore [[Angular momentum#Scalar – angular momentum in two dimensions|angular momentum {{math|<VAR>rmv</var><sub>⊥</sub>}}]] is conserved by this exchange of distance and velocity.

In the case of triangle '''SBC''', area is equal to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>('''SB''')('''VC'''). Wherever '''C''' is eventually located due to the impulse applied at '''B''', the product ('''SB''')('''VC'''), and therefore {{math|<VAR>rmv</var><sub>⊥</sub>}} remain constant. Similarly so for each of the triangles.

=== After Newton ===
[[Leonhard Euler]], [[Daniel Bernoulli]], and [[Patrick d'Arcy]] all understood angular momentum in terms of conservation of [[areal velocity]], a result of their analysis of [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Second law|Kepler's Second Law]] of planetary motion. It is unlikely that they realized the implications for ordinary rotating matter.<ref>see {{cite web

In 1799, [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] first realized that a fixed plane was associated with rotation — his ''[[invariable plane]]''.

[[Louis Poinsot]] in 1803 began representing rotations as a line segment perpendicular to the rotation, and elaborated on the "conservation of moments".

In 1852 [[Léon Foucault]] used a [[gyroscope]] in an experiment to display the Earth's rotation.

[[William John Macquorn Rankine|William J. M. Rankine's]] 1858 ''Manual of Applied Mechanics'' defined angular momentum in the modern sense for the first time:
:''...a line whose length is proportional to the magnitude of the angular momentum, and whose direction is perpendicular to the plane of motion of the body and of the fixed point, and such, that when the motion of the body is viewed from the extremity of the line, the radius-vector of the body seems to have right-handed rotation.''

In an 1872 edition of the same book, Rankine stated that "The term ''angular momentum'' was introduced by Mr. Hayward,"<ref>{{cite book

Before this, angular momentum was typically referred to as "momentum of rotation" in English.<ref>see, for instance, {{cite journal
