A '''color code''' or '''colour code''' is a system for displaying information by using different [[color]]s.

The earliest examples of color codes in use are for long distance communication by use of flags, as in [[Flag semaphore|semaphore]] communication.<ref>''Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers: Volume 29'' (1893), p. 507.</ref> The [[United Kingdom]] adopted a color code scheme for such communication wherein [[red]] signified [[Risk|danger]] and [[white]] signified [[safety]], with other colors having similar assignments of meaning.

As chemistry and other technologies advanced, it became expedient to use coloration as a signal for telling apart things that would otherwise be confusingly similar, such as [[Electrical wiring|wiring]] in electrical and electronic devices, and pharmaceutical [[Pill (pharmacy)|pills]].

The use of color codes has been extended to abstractions, such as the [[Homeland Security Advisory System]] color code in the United States. Similarly, [[hospital emergency codes]] often incorporate colors (such as the widely used "Code Blue" indicating a [[cardiac arrest]]), although they may also include numbers, and may not conform to a uniform standard.

Color codes are often difficult for [[color blindness|color blind]] and blind people to interpret.

==Examples==
Systems incorporating color-coding include:

*In electronics:
**[[Electrical wiring]] — AC power phase, neutral, and grounding wires
**[[Electronic color code]] — for electronic components
**[[Jump start (vehicle)|Jumper cables]] used to jump-start a vehicle
**[[Surround sound#Channel identification|Surround Sound ports and cables]]
**[[Audio and video connector#Color codes|Audio Connectors]]
**[[Audio and video connector#Color codes 2|Video Connectors]]
**[[Color coding of optical fibers|Optical fibers]]
**[[PC System Design Guide#Color-coding scheme for connectors and ports|PC connectors and ports]]
**[[Three-phase electric power#Color codes|Three-phase electric power]] (electrical wiring)
**[[25-pair color code]] — telecommunications wiring

*In video games
**[[Minecraft]]
**[[Health (gaming)|Health]] and [[Magic (gaming)|Magic Points]]
**To distinguish friend from foe, for instance in [[Starcraft]], [[Halo (game)|Halo]], or [[League of Legends]]

*In navigation:
**[[Navigation light]]
**[[Sea mark]]
**[[Characteristic light]]
**[[Traffic light]]s

*Other technology:
**[[Bottled gas]]es
**[[Fire extinguisher]]s
**[[Utility color code|Underground utility location]]
**[[Black hat hacking]], [[White hat (computer security)|white hat]], [[grey hat]]

*In military use:
**[[NATO Military Symbols for Land Based Systems#Affiliation]]
**[[Artillery shell]]s and other munitions, which are color-coded according to their pyrotechnic contents
**[[Rainbow Herbicides]]
**[[List of Rainbow Codes]]

*In social functions:
**[[ISO 22324]], Guidelines for color-coded alerts in public warning
**[[Handkerchief code]]
**[[Ribbon]] colors ''see:'' [[:Category:Ribbon symbolism]]
**[[Rank in Judo]]
**[[Blue-collar worker]], [[White-collar worker]], [[Pink-collar worker]], [[Gold-collar worker]], [[Grey-collar]], [[Green-collar worker]]
*At point of sale (especially for [[packaging]] within a huge range of [[Stock keeping unit|products]]: to quickly differentiate variants, brands, categories)
