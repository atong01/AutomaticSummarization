'''Curry''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ʌr|i}}, plural '''curries''') is a dish originating in the cuisine of the [[South Asian cuisine|Indian Subcontinent]] and [[Southeast Asian cuisine|Southeast Asia]]. The common feature is the incorporation of complex combinations of spices or herbs, usually including fresh or dried hot chillies.  Some limit the use of the term '''curry''' to dishes prepared in a sauce,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/curry_7|title=curry definition and synonyms - Macmillan Dictionary|work=macmillandictionary.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://glosbe.com/en/hi/curry Glosbe_English-Hindi Dictionary|work=Hindi Dictionary|title=Curry}}</ref> but curries may be "dry" or "wet". A curry dish may be spiced with leaves from the [[curry tree]], but many curries do not have this ingredient.<ref>{{cite news|work=NPR|url=http://www.npr.org/2011/09/28/140735689/fresh-curry-leaves-add-a-touch-of-india|date=September 28, 2011|title=Fresh Curry Leaves Add a Touch of India}}</ref>

There are many varieties of dishes called "curries". For example, in original traditional cuisines, the precise selection of spices for each dish is a matter of national or regional cultural tradition, religious practice, and, to some extent, family preference. Such dishes are called by specific names that refer to their ingredients, spicing, and cooking methods.<ref>{{cite book|author=Collingham, Lizzie|title=Curry: A Tale of Cooks and Conquerors|location=New York, NY|publisher= Oxford University Press|date= 2006|page=115}} "No Indian, however, would have referred to his or her food as a curry. The idea of a curry is, in fact, a concept that the Europeans imposed on India's food culture. Indians referred to their different dishes by specific names ... But the British lumped all these together under the heading of curry." </ref>  Traditionally, spices are used both whole and ground; cooked or raw; and they may be added at different times during the cooking process to produce different results.  The main spices found in most curry powders of the Indian subcontinent  are [[coriander]], [[cumin]], and [[turmeric]]; a wide range of additional spices may be included depending on the geographic region and the foods being included (fish, lentils, red or white meat, rice, and vegetables).<ref>{{cite book|author=Raghavan, S. |title=Handbook of Spices, Seasonings and Flavourings|publisher= CRC Press|date= 2007 |isbn=0-8493-2842-X|page= 302}}</ref>[[Curry powder]], a commercially prepared mixture of spices, is largely a Western notion, dating to the 18th century. Such mixtures are commonly thought to have first been prepared by Indian merchants for sale to members of the [[British Raj|British Colonial government and army]] returning to Britain.

Dishes called "curry" may contain fish, meat, poultry, or shellfish, either alone or in combination with vegetables. Additionally, many instead are entirely vegetarian, eaten especially among those who hold ethical or religious proscriptions against eating meat or seafood.

Curries may be either "dry" or "wet".  Dry curries are cooked with very little liquid which is allowed to evaporate, leaving the other ingredients coated with the spice mixture. Wet curries contain significant amounts of sauce or gravy based on yoghurt, cream, coconut milk, coconut cream, legume purée (''[[dal]]''), or stock.

==Etymology==
Curry was adopted and anglicised from the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] word ''{{IAST|ka<u>r</u>i}}'' (கறி) meaning "sauce",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:705.hobson |title=University of Chicago |publisher=Dsal.uchicago.edu |date=1 September 2001 |accessdate=8 June 2009}}</ref> which is usually understood to mean vegetables and/or meat cooked with spices with or without a gravy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cookeryonline.com/India/INDIA4.html#K |title=Indian Cookery Terms |publisher=Cookeryonline.com |date=24 February 2007 |accessdate=8 June 2009}}</ref> According to this theory, ''kari'' was first encountered in the mid-17th century by members of the British [[East India Company]] trading with Tamil (Indian) merchants along the [[Coromandel Coast]] of southeast India,<ref name = "SahniCur">Sahni, Julie. ''Classic Indian Cooking.'' (New York, NY: William Morrow and Company, Inc., c.1980), p.39-40.</ref> particularly at [[Fort St. George]] (later called [[Madras]] and renamed [[Chennai]] in 1996). Here, they became familiar with "a spice blend used for making kari dishes ... called ''kari podi'' or curry powder.".<ref name = "SahniCur" /> A further explanation put forward in ''The Flavours of History'' claims the origins of the word curry to be from old English first recorded in 'The Forme of Cury' (1390) <ref name=flavours>{{cite book|title=The Flavours of History |author=Peter & Colleen Grove |publisher=Godiva Books |year=2011 }}</ref> although, in this case, "cury" merely means "cooking".

==Origins and dissemination==
Dishes of highly spiced meat are thought to have originated in pre-historic times among the inhabitants of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]].<ref name=lawler>{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2013/01/indus_civilization_food_how_scientists_are_figuring_out_what_curry_was_like.single.html |title=The Mystery of Curry |work=Slate |author=Andrew Lawler |date=29 January 2013 |accessdate=3 February 2013}}</ref> Archaeological evidence dating to 2600 BCE from [[Mohenjo-daro]] suggests the use of mortar and pestle to pound spices including mustard, fennel, cumin, and tamarind pods with which they flavoured food.<ref>Iyer, Raghavan. ''660 Curries.'' (New York, NY: Workman Publishing, c.2008), p.2-3.</ref> Such dishes are also recorded during the [[Vedic period|Vedic Period]] of Indian history, roughly 1700 to 500 BCE.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Spiced dishes in the Indian style were apparently carried eastward to Burma, Thailand, and China by Buddhist monks in the 7th century CE,{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} and carried southwards to Indonesia, The Philippines, and elsewhere by coastal traders at about the same time.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} The establishment of the [[Mughal Empire]], beginning in the early 16th century, transformed much of older Indian cuisine, especially in the north. Another influence was the establishment of the Portuguese trading centre in [[Goa]] in 1510, resulting in the first introduction of the [[chili pepper]] to India, as a byproduct of the [[Columbian Exchange]].

From the mid-19th century, curry has been increasingly popular in Great Britain. During the 19th century, curry was also carried to the Caribbean by Indian [[indenture]]d workers in the British sugar industry. Since the mid-20th century, curries of many national styles have become popular far from their origins, and increasingly become part of international [[fusion cuisine]].

==Indian Subcontinent==
From the culinary point of view, it is useful to consider the [[Indian Subcontinent]] to be the entire historical region encompassed prior to independence in August 1947; that is, the modern countries of [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Bangladesh]]. It is usual to distinguish broadly between "northern" and "southern" styles of Indian cuisine, recognising that within those categories are innumerable sub-styles and variations.<ref name = "CamNS">Kiple, Kenneth F. and Kriemhild Coneè Ornelas, eds. ''Cambridge World History of Food, The.'' (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, c.2000), vol.2, p.1149f.</ref> The distinction is commonly made with reference to the staple starch: wheat in the form of unleavened breads in the north; rice in the east; rice and millet in the south.<ref name = "CamNS" />

===India===
{{see also|Indian cuisine}}
[[File:Rajma and Chawal, from India.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Rajma]]-[[Chawal]]'', curried red kidney beans with steamed rice, from India.]] 
Curries are the most recognized part of the Indian cuisine. Most Indian dishes are usually curry based, made by adding different type of vegetable, lentils or occasional meats in the curry. The content of the curry and style of preparation varies as per the region. Most curries are water based, with occasional use of dairy and coconut milk. Curry dishes are usually thick and spicy and are eaten along with steamed rice and variety of Indian breads.

====Andhra Pradesh and Telangana====
{{see also|Telugu cuisine}}
The food in general from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, both with Telugu-speaking natives, is considered the hottest in India. The state, being the leading producer of [[Chili pepper|red chilli]] and [[green chilli]], influences the liberal use of spices, making their curries, chutneys, savories and pickles the hottest and spiciest in taste.

====Goa====
[[File:Vindalho.jpg|thumb|Pork Vindaloo in a Goan restaurant.]]
Curries known as [[vindaloo]] have become well known in Great Britain, America, and elsewhere, where the name is usually used simply to indicate a fiery dish of lamb or chicken frequently including potatoes. Such dishes are far from the Goan originals.

The name "vindaloo" derives from the Portuguese ''vinha d'alhos'' or wine (''vinho'') and garlic (''alho''), the two definitive flavour ingredients. The dish was originally made with pork, not taboo to the Christian Portuguese. The inclusion of potatoes was a later Indian addition, thought to be the result of confusion with the Hindi word for potato, ''aloo''.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

====Gujarat====
{{Main|Gujarati cuisine}}
Although "wet curries" play a smaller role in Gujarat than elsewhere, there are a number of vegetarian examples with gravies based on buttermilk or coconut milk. The main ingredient may variously be brinjal (eggplant or aubergine), potatoes, fresh corn kernels, okra, tomatoes, etc. In addition, there are several common [[kofta]] dishes which, of course, substitute vegetables for meat.<ref>Reejhsinghani, Aroona. ''Vegetarian Wonders from Gujarat.'' (Mumbai: Jaico Publishing House, c.2002), p.123-128.</ref> [[Undhiyu]], a Gujarati specialty, is a spicy "wet" mixed-vegetable "casserole" cooked in an earthenware pot, often eaten during the winter months.
<!-- Curry varies in flavour and heat. Mild curry could be made of [[cardamom]], [[coriander]], [[cumin]], [[turmeric]], [[star anise]], and salt.-->

====Karnataka====
{{Main|Cuisine of Karnataka}}
[[Image:Karnatakadishes.jpg|thumb|Curry-based dishes from [[Karnataka]], India.]]
The curries of Karnataka are typically vegetarian and with meat and fish around mostly coastal areas. They use a wide variety of vegetables and spices and coconut and [[jaggery]] are common tastes. There are dry and sauce-based curries. Some typical sauce-based dishes include [[Saaru]], Gojju, Thovve, Huli, Majjige Huli; which is similar to the "kadi" made in the north, Sagu or Kootu, which is eaten mixed with hot rice.

====Kashmir====
[[Image:Rogan josh02.jpg|thumb|Kashmiri [[rogan josh]]]]
In the West, the best-known curry is ''[[rogan josh]]'', a wet curry of lamb with a brilliant red gravy whose colour is derived from a combination of Kashmiri chillis (''kashmiri mirchi'') and an extract derived from the red flowers of the [[Celosia|cockscomb plant]] (''mawal'').<ref>"Rogan Josh," in Khan Mohammed Sharief Waza, Khan Mohammed Shafi Waza, and Khan Mohammed Rafiq Waza. ''Wazwaan: Traditional Kashmiri Cuisine.'' (New Delhi: Roli & Janssen BV, c.2007), p.34.</ref> ''Goshtaba'' (large lamb meatballs cooked in yoghurt gravy) is another curry dish from the [[Wazwan]] tradition occasionally found in Western restaurants.<ref>"Ghushtaba" in Khan Mohammed Sharief Waza, Khan Mohammed Shafi Waza, and Khan Mohammed Rafiq Waza. ''Wazwaan: Traditional Kashmiri Cuisine.'' (New Delhi: Roli & Janssen BV, c.2007), p.37.</ref>
<!--''[[Kadhi]]'' is a specific dish, made by stirring [[yoghurt]] into a [[roux]] of [[ghee]] and [[Gram flour|besan]]. The spices added vary, but usually include turmeric, [[black mustard]] seed, and curry leaves. It is often eaten with rice. [[North India]], where dishes are classified as ''sukhi'' (dry) and ''tari'' (with liquid), the word ''curry'' is often confounded with the similar-sounding [[Hindi]] word ''tari'' (from the [[Persian language|Persian]]-derived ''tar'' meaning ''wet'') and has no implications for the presence or absence of spice, or whether the dish is Indian or not (e.g. any stew, spicy or not, would be considered a curry dish, simply because it is wet).<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Fk8FQa2ZSFQC |title=India| author=Sarina Singh |publisher=Lonely Planet |accessdate=17 May 2010|quote=generally cooked sukhi (dry) or tari (in a sauce) | isbn=978-1-74059-694-7}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=E2saAQAAIAAJ|title=Hanklyn-janklin: a stranger's rumble-tumble guide to some words, customs, and quiddities, Indian and Indo-British| author=Nigel B.

====Kerala====
{{Main|Cuisine of Kerala}}

[[Malayali]] curries of [[Kerala]] typically contain shredded [[coconut]] paste or [[coconut milk]], [[Curry tree|curry leaves]], and various spices. Mustard seeds are used in almost every dish, along with onions, curry leaves, and sliced red chilies fried in hot oil. Most of the non-vegetarian dishes are heavily spiced. Kerala is known for its traditional [[sadya]], a vegetarian meal served with boiled rice and a host of side dishes such as [[parippu]] (green gram), [[papadum]], [[ghee]], [[Sambar (dish)|sambar]], [[rasam]], [[aviyal]], [[kaalan]], [[kichadi]], [[pachadi]], [[injipuli]], [[Koottukari]], [[Indian pickle|pickles]] (mango, lime), [[thoran]], one to four types of [[payasam]], [[Boli (food)|boli]], [[Olan (dish)|olan]], pulissery, moru ([[buttermilk]]), upperi, and [[banana]] chips. The sadya is customarily served on a banana leaf.

====Maharashtra====
{{Main|Maharashtrian cuisine}}
[[File:Solkadi and Bangda Fry.jpg|thumb|A Maharastrian ''thaali'', containing [[Solkadhi]], a type of curry usually eaten with rice.]]
The curries of [[Maharashtra]] vary from mildly spicy to very spicy and include vegetarian, mutton, chicken and fish. Coastal Maharashtrian – Konkani – curries use coconut extensively along with spices. In western Maharashtra, curries are very spicy and [[Peanut|groundnut]] (peanut) powder is often added to it. Vidarbha's cuisine is usually spicier than that of the coastal and southern regions. The ingredients commonly used are besan, or [[chickpea]] flour, and groundnut powder. As a result of the  Mughal rule in the region, the cuisine of Aurangabad has been highly influenced by the North Indian method of cooking. Khandeshi food is very spicy and the most famous dish is Shev bhaji.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Others include [[eggplant|brinjal]] wange, che bharit, Udidachi dal, Bharleli wangi, [[thecha]] bhakari, and spicy mutton. Most of the people are farmers so their traditional food is very simple.

====Punjab====
{{Main|Punjabi cuisine}}
[[File:Kadhi Chawal from India.jpg|thumb|''[[Kadhi chawal]]'' (yoghurt and gram flour curry) served with steamed rice, from India.]]
Punjabi cuisine like rest of Indian cuisine has lot of curry based dishes. Most Punjabi dishes are prepared using ''Tadka'', which is made  with the frying of a [[spice mix|masala]] which is a concoction of ginger, garlic, onions and tomatoes with some dried spices, this is followed by the addition of other ingredients, water and occasional milk. Normally spicy, spice level varies greatly depending on the household itself. [[Ghee]] and [[Mustard oil]] are the most commonly used cooking fat. Many popular Punjabi dishes such as [[Butter Chicken]] and [[Rajma]] are curry based. These dishes are usually served with steamed rice and [[Chapati]]s.

====Rajasthan====
{{Main|Rajasthani cuisine}}
[[Rajasthan]]i cuisine was influenced by both the war-like lifestyles of its inhabitants and the availability of ingredients in this arid region.<ref name="Dubey">Krishna Gopal Dubey, The Indian Cuisine, PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd., pp.193</ref> Food that could last for several days and could be eaten without heating was preferred. Scarcity of water and fresh green vegetables have all had their effect on the cooking. Hence the curries in Rajasthan are usually made using dry spices and herbs and other dry items like gram flour. ''[[Kadhi]]'' is a popular gram flour curry, usually served with steamed rice and bread. To decrease the use of water in this desert state they use a lot of milk and milk products to cook curries. [[Laal maans]] is a popular meat curry from Rajasthan.

====Tamil Nadu====
{{Main|South Indian cuisine}}

[[Tamil cuisine]]'s distinctive flavour and aroma is achieved by a blend and combination of [[spice]]s including [[Curry tree|curry leaves]], [[tamarind]], [[coriander]], [[ginger]], [[garlic]], [[chili pepper|chili]], [[black pepper|pepper]], [[poppy seed]]s, [[mustard seed]]s, [[cinnamon]], [[clove]]s, [[cardamom]], [[cumin]], [[fennel]] or [[anise]] seeds, [[fenugreek seed]]s, [[nutmeg]], [[coconut]], [[turmeric]] root or powder, and [[rosewater]]. [[Lentil]]s, [[vegetable]]s and [[dairy product]]s are essential accompaniments and are often served with rice. Traditionally vegetarian foods dominate the menu with a range of non-vegetarian dishes including [[freshwater]] [[Fish (food)|fish]] and [[seafood]] cooked with spices and seasoning.

====West Bengal and Bangladesh====
{{Main|Bangladeshi cuisine|Bengali cuisine|}}

[[File:Pointed Gourd Curry - Kolkata 2011-09-20 5428.JPG|right|thumb|Bengali gourd curry.]]
[[Bengali cuisine]] includes curries, including seafood and fresh fish. Mustard seeds and mustard oil are added to many recipes, as are poppy seeds.

===Nepal===
{{Main|Nepalese cuisine}}

The curries of Nepalese cuisine have been influenced by its neighbours, namely [[Cuisine of Burma|Burma]] and [[Tibetan cuisine|Tibet]]. Well known Indian spices are used less. [[Yak]] is a popular meat in the Himalayan region of Nepal.

[[Daal bhaat]] (rice and [[lentil soup]]) is a staple dish of [[Nepal]]. [[Newa cuisine]] is a type of cuisine developed over centuries by the [[Newar]]s of Nepal.

===Pakistan===
{{Main|Pakistani cuisine}}
[[File:Chicken Curry 1.JPG|thumb|[[Curry chicken]] from Pakistan]]
Pakistani curries, specially in the provinces of Punjab and Sindh are basically similar to their counterparts in northern India. Meat, including mutton and beef, are often an ingredient. A typical Pakistani lunch or dinner often consists of some form of bread (such as naan or roti) or rice with a meat or vegetable-based curry. Barbecue style or roasted meats are also very popular in the form of kebabs.

It is worth noting that the term ''curry'' is virtually never used inside the country; instead, regional words such as ''salan'' or ''shorba'' are used to denote what is known outside the country as a "curry". In addition, curry powder is almost never used in a Pakistani curry.

Several different types of curries exist, depending on the cooking style, such as bhuna, bharta, roghan josh, qorma, qeema, and shorba. A favourite [[Pakistan]]i curry is [[karahi]], which is either mutton or chicken cooked in a cooking utensil called karahi, which is similar in shape to a wok. Lahori karahi incorporates garlic, ginger, fresh chillies, tomatoes and select spices. Peshawari karahi is another very popular version made with just meat, salt, tomatoes, and coriander.

====Khyber Pakhtunkhwa====
{{Main|Afghan cuisine|Pashtun cuisine}}
The cuisine from the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province of [[Pakistan]] is somewhat similar to the cuisine of neighbouring [[Afghanistan]]. Extreme winters in some areas made the supply of fresh vegetables impossible, therefore a lot of dried fruits and vegetables are incorporated in the cuisine. The province still produces a large amount of nuts which are used abundantly in traditional cooking, along with cereals like wheat, maize, barley, and rice. Accompanying these staples are dairy products (yoghurt, whey), various nuts, native vegetables, and fresh and dried fruits. Peshawari karahi from the provincial capital of [[Peshawar]] is a popular curry all over the country.

===Maldives===
{{See also|Maldivian cuisine}}

The most important curry in the cuisine of the [[Maldives]] is cooked with diced fresh [[tuna]] and is known as ''[[mas riha]]''. ''Kukulhu riha'', [[chicken curry]], is cooked with a different mixture of spices.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/4398927/Eating_on_the_Islands_-_As_times_have_changed_so_has_the_Maldives_unique_cuisine_and_culture|title=Eating on the Islands - As times have changed, so has the Maldives' unique cuisine and culture|author=Xavier Romero-Frias|work=academia.edu}}</ref>

Traditional vegetable curries in the Maldives include those that use ''bashi'' ([[eggplant]]), ''tora'' (''[[Luffa aegyptiaca]]''), ''barabō'' ([[pumpkin]]), ''chichanda'' (''[[Trichosanthes cucumerina]]'') and ''muranga'' (''[[Moringa oleifera]]''), as well as green unripe [[banana]]s and certain leaves as their main ingredients. Pieces of [[Maldive fish]] are normally added to give the vegetable curry a certain flavour.<ref name="ReferenceA">[[Xavier Romero-Frias]], ''The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom'', Barcelona 1999, ISBN 84-7254-801-5</ref>

====Punjab====
{{Main|Punjabi cuisine}}
[[File:Nihari.JPG|thumb|Mutton [[Nihari]] with garnish, from Pakistan.]]
Cuisine in Pakistani Punjab differs from Indian Punjab on account of contents and religious diet rules. A typical Punjabi meal consists of some form of bread or rice with a ''salan'' (curry). Most preparations start with the frying of a [[spice mix|masala]] which is a concoction of ginger, garlic, onions and tomatoes with some dried spices. This is followed by the addition of other ingredients. Spice level varies greatly depending on the sub-region as well as the household itself. A popular cooking fat is pure [[desi]] [[ghee]], and some dishes are often enriched with liberal amounts of [[butter]] and [[cream]]. There are certain dishes that are exclusive to Punjab, such as maash di dal and saron da saag (sarson ka saag). In Punjab & Kashmir, the only dish known as Kardhi (Curry ) is a dish made of yougurt and dumplings made from gram flour. Everything else is called by its proper name.

====Sindh====
{{Main|Sindhi cuisine}}
In Pakistan, the provinces of Sindh and Balochistan border the [[Arabian Sea]]. Due to this, the Sindhi cuisine often has abundant use of fish in curries. Among Pakistani food, the Sindhi curries generally tend to be the hottest. The daily food in most Sindhi households consists of [[wheat]]-based flatbread ([[phulka]]) and rice accompanied by two dishes, one [[gravy]] and one dry.

===Sri Lanka===
{{see also|Sri Lankan cuisine}}

In [[Sri Lanka]]n cuisine, [[rice]], which is usually consumed daily, can be found at any special occasion, while spicy curries are favourite dishes for lunch and dinner. "[[Rice and curry]]" refers to a range of Sri Lankan dishes. Examples are [[Chicken curry| "Chicken Curries]] and Pork Curries.

==Southeast Asia==
{{See also|Cambodian cuisine|Lao cuisine|Singaporean cuisine}}

[[Southeast Asia]]n countries, including [[Thailand]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Philippines]], [[Burma]], [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]] and [[Vietnam]] have their own versions of curry.

===Burma===
{{See also|Burmese cuisine}}
[[Burma|Burmese]] cuisine is based on a very different understanding of curries. The principal ingredients of almost all Burmese curries are fresh onion (which provides the gravy and main body of the curry), Indian spices and red chilies. Usually, meat and fish are the main ingredients for popular curries.

Burmese curries can be generalised into two types – the hot spicy dishes which exhibit north Indian or Pakistani influence, and the milder "sweet" curries. Burmese curries almost overwhelmingly lack coconut milk, setting them apart from most southeast Asian curries.

Regular ingredients include fresh onion, garlic and [[chili paste (disambiguation)|chili paste]]. Common spices include [[garam masala]], dried chili powder, cumin powder, turmeric and [[Cuisine of Burma#Ngapi|ngapi]], a fermented paste made from either fish or prawns. Burmese curries are quite oily, as the extra oil helps the food to last longer. A spaghetti equivalent called [[Nan gyi thohk]] exists, in which wheat or rice noodles are eaten with thick chicken curry.

===Indonesia===
{{See also|Indonesian cuisine}}
[[File:Roti Cane Kari Kambing.jpg|thumb|''Kari kambing'' (mutton curry) served with ''[[roti canai]]'' in [[Sumatra]].]]
In [[Indonesia]] curry is called ''kari'' or ''kare''. The most common type of ''kari'' consumed in Indonesia is ''kari ayam'' (chicken curry) and ''kari kambing'' (goat meat curry). In [[Aceh]] and [[North Sumatra]] [[Roti Canai|roti cane]] is often eaten with ''kari kambing''. Other dishes such as [[gulai]] and [[Opor ayam|opor]] are dishes based on curry. They are often highly localised and reflect the meat and vegetables available. They can therefore employ a variety of meats (chicken, beef, water buffalo and goat as in the flavoursome ''gulai kambing''), seafood (prawn, crab, mussel, clam, squid, etc.), fish (tuna, mackerel, carp, pangasius, catfish), or vegetables (young [[jackfruit]], common beans, [[cassava]] leaf) dishes in a spiced sauce. They use local ingredients such as [[chili pepper]]s, [[kaffir lime]] leaves, [[lemongrass]], [[galangal]], [[Bay leaf#Taxonomy|Indonesian bay leaves]] (salam leaf), [[candlenut]]s, turmeric, turmeric leaves, [[Garcinia atroviridis|asam gelugur]] and [[Garcinia#Selected species|asam kandis]] (sour [[Garcinia|mangosteens]] similar to [[tamarind]]), [[terasi|shrimp paste]] (terasi), cumin, coriander seed and [[coconut milk]]. In Aceh, curries use ''daun salam koja'' or ''daun kari'' (''[[Murraya koenigii]]'') translated as "curry leaves".

One popular dish, [[rendang]] from [[Minangkabau cuisine|West Sumatran cuisine]], is often describes as caramelized beef dry curry.<ref name="William Wongso">{{cite web|url=http://indonesiaproud.wordpress.com/2010/11/23/william-wongso-duta-rendang-di-dunia-kuliner-internasional/ |publisher=Indonesia Proud | title=William Wongso: Duta Rendang di Dunia Kuliner Internasional}}</ref> In Indonesia, rendang is usually not considered to be curry since it is richer and contains less liquid than is normal for Indonesian curries.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Arti Dibalik Masakan Rendang |date=30 April 2014|url=http://www.rendangnaniko.com/blog/arti-diabalik-masakan-rendang/|publisher=Rendang Naniko|language=Indonesian|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref> Authentic rendang uses water buffalo meat slow-cooked in thick coconut milk for a number of hours to tenderise, caramelise, and flavour the meat. [[Opor Ayam]] is another variation of curry, which tastes very similar to that of gulai. Opor is usually whitish in colour and uses neither cinnamon or turmeric, while gulai may contain either or both. Opor is also often part of a family meal around [[Eid ul-Fitr|Lebaran]], while gulai can be commonly found in [[Padang food|Padang restaurants]].

===Malaysia===
{{See also|Malaysian cuisine}}
Being at the crossroads of ancient trade routes has left a mark on the Malaysian cuisine. While the curry may have initially found its way to Malaysian shores via the Indian population, it has since become a staple among the Malays and Chinese too. Malaysian curries differ from state to state, even within similar ethnic groupings, as they are influenced by many factors, be it cultural, religious, agricultural or economical.

Malaysian curries typically use curry powders rich in turmeric, coconut milk, shallots, ginger, [[belacan]] (shrimp paste), chili peppers, and garlic. [[Tamarind]] is also often used. [[Rendang]] is another form of curry consumed in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines; although it is drier and contains mostly meat and more coconut milk than a conventional Malaysian curry. Rendang was mentioned in Malay literature [[Hikayat Amir Hamzah]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rahQDaE0bD8C&pg=PA10&dq=rendang+hikayat |title=Hikayat Amir Hamzah |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=8 June 2009 | isbn=978-983-192-116-6}}</ref> (1550s)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mcp.anu.edu.au/N/AHmz_bib.html |title=malay concordance project |publisher=Mcp.anu.edu.au |date= |accessdate=8 June 2009}}</ref> is popular among Indonesians, Singaporeans and Malaysians. All sorts of things are curried in Malaysia, including mutton, chicken, shrimp, cuttlefish, fish, aubergines, eggs, and vegetables.The vegetarians in Malaysia would make vegetarian curries with vegetables or tofu based products.

===Philippines===

{{See also|Philippine cuisine}}
In the Philippines, two kinds of curry traditions are seen corresponding with the cultural divide between the Westernized north and Islamized south. In the northern areas, a linear range of curry recipes could be seen. Chicken cooked in coconut milk, chillies and curry powder is the usual curry dish that northern Filipinos are familiar with. A typical northern Filipino curry dish would be usually of either pork or chicken as the meat while cooked at a similar manner as to other local dishes such as ''[[adobo]]'', ''[[kaldereta]]'', and ''[[mechado]]'', ''patis'' ([[fish sauce]]), with potatoes, bay leaf, coconut milk, and sometimes lemongrass and carrots to complement.

In southern areas of Mindanao, the Sulu Archipelago and southern Palawan, various curries are seen, and owe their origins to their non-colonized histories and thus centuries of continued contact with [[Indonesia]], the [[Malaysia|Malay Peninsula]] and the [[South Asia]]. These Mindanaoan curries include ''Kulma'', synonymous with [[Korma]], ''Tiyula Itum'' which is a beef curry blackened with burned coconut-meat powder, and [[Rendang]], also eaten in Indonesia and Malaysia. Meats used in these curries include beef, lamb and chicken. Pork is not used in accordance with Islamic dietary laws.

===Thailand===
{{Main|Thai curry}}
[[File:Phanaeng mu.jpg|thumb|Thai ''phanaeng'' with pork]]
In Thai cuisine, curries are called ''kaeng'', and usually consist of meat, fish and/or vegetables in a sauce based on a paste made from chilies, onions or shallots, garlic, and [[shrimp paste]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thaicooking.nationmultimedia.com/?p=1382 |title=Thai cooking,food thai,Thai menu, pad thai recipe |publisher=Thaicooking.nationmultimedia.com |date= |accessdate=22 October 2013}}</ref> Additional spices and herbs define the type of curry. Local ingredients, such as chili peppers, [[kaffir lime]] leaves, [[lemon grass]], [[galangal]] and, in central and southern Thai cuisine, also coconut milk are used. Northern and northeastern Thai curries generally do not contain coconut milk. Due to the use of fresh herbs, spices, and other fresh ingredients, Thai curries tend to be more aromatic than Indian curries. In the West, some of the Thai curries are described by colour; [[red curry|red curries]] use red chilies while [[green curry|green curries]] use green chilies. [[Yellow curry]] - called ''Kaeng kari'' (by various spellings) in [[Thai language|Thai]], of which a literal translation could be "curry soup" - is more similar to Indian curries, with the use of turmeric, [[cumin]], and other dried spices. A few stir-fried Thai dishes also use an Indian style curry powder (Thai: ''pong kari'').

Thai curries:
* [[Yellow curry]]
* [[Massaman curry]]
* [[Green curry]]
* [[Red curry]]
* [[Phanaeng curry]]
* [[Khao soi]]
* Kaeng hangle
* [[Kaeng som]]

===Vietnam===
{{See also|Vietnamese cuisine}}

In [[Vietnam]], curry is called ''cà ri''. Vietnamese curry features coconut milk, potato, sweet potato, taro roots, chicken garnished with [[cilantro]] and green onion and is more soup-like than Indian curry. Goat curry also exists but only at a few specialised restaurants.{{cn|date=August 2015}} The curry is usually eaten with a baguette, rice vermicelli or steamed rice. Vietnamese curry is considered a Southern food.

==Other Asian countries==

===China===
{{See also|Chinese cuisine}}
Chinese curries (咖哩, gā lǐ) typically consist of chicken, beef, fish, lamb, or other meats, green peppers, onions, large chunks of potatoes, and a variety of other ingredients and spices in a mildly spicy yellow curry sauce, and topped over [[steamed rice]]. White pepper, soy sauce, hot sauce, and/or hot chili oil may be applied to the sauce to enhance the flavour of the curry.

The most common Chinese variety of curry sauce is usually sold in powder form. It seems to have descended from a Singaporean and Malaysian variety, countries which also introduced the [[satay]] sauce to the Chinese.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} The ethnic Cantonese (dominant in [[Kuala Lumpur]]), this yellow, [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese-Malaysian]] variety was naturally introduced to China by the Cantonese, and features typically in Hong Kong cuisine, where curry is often cooked with [[brisket]] or [[fish balls]]. Malay satay seems to have been introduced to China with wider success by the ethnic [[Teochew people|Teochew]], who make up the second largest group of Chinese of [[Chinese Singaporean|Singapore]] and are the dominant group in [[Thai Chinese|Thailand]].

There are many different varieties of Chinese curry, depending on each restaurant. "Galimian," (from Malaysian "curry mee" or "curry noodles,") is also a popular Chinese curry dish.

===Fiji===
In [[Fiji]] curries are made in most Indian homes and is eaten with rice or [[roti]]. Roti (circle or square) is mainly eaten for breakfast with vegetable curries. Lunch is often dal and rice with some side dishes. Most working people take roti and curry for their lunch. Dinner is usually curry, rice with some chutneys. Curries are normally cooked in vegetable oil. Ghee is mainly used to fry dal, to make puris or sweets. To make a curry, spices like cumin, fenugreek, mustard, and curry leaves are added to the hot oil. Onion is chopped or slices and garlic crushed and added to the pot. Once the onion and garlic have turned slightly golden then turmeric and garam masala are added. For every 1 tsp turmeric normally 2 tsp masala is added. Salt and chillies are added according to taste. Curry  is cooked on low heat until well cooked. Water is added so that it can be mixed with rice. If coriander leaves are available then it is added to add extra flavour.

Sometimes potatoes or vegetables are also added to curries to increase volume and make them more nutritious. Often coconut cream is added to seafood curries for example prawn, crab or fish curries. Almost every food can be curried with the exception of dark green leafy vegetables. Curries are often very healthy if less oil is used in cooking and they can be made even healthier if vegetables are added and fat is removed from meat. A portion of curry would be about 1 cup cooked curry. Dal is often cooked with only turmeric and then fried in cumin, onion, and garlic. Sometimes carrots and leafy vegetables like ''chauraiya'' or ''saijan'' are added for extra flavour and nutrients.

===Japan===
{{Main|Japanese curry}}
[[File:Curry rice by Hyougushi in Kyoto.jpg|thumb|Japanese style ''Karē-Raisu'' (Curry rice)]]
[[File:Curry-bun,curry-pan,katori-city,japan.JPG|thumb|''Karē-Pan'' (Curry bread)]]
{{Nihongo|Japanese curry|カレー|karē}} is one of the most popular dishes in [[Japan]], where people eat it an average of 78 times a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sbcurry.com/qa/number_1.html|title=Curry Q&A|author=S&B Foods Inc|language=Japanese|accessdate=11 April 2008}}</ref> It is usually eaten as ''karē raisu'' — curry, rice, and often pickled vegetables, served on the same plate and eaten with a spoon, a common lunchtime canteen dish. It is less spicy and seasoned than Indian and Southeast Asian curries, being more of a thick stew than a curry.

British people brought curry from the [[British Raj|Indian colony]] back to Britain<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sb-worldwide.com/curry/history.html|title=History of Japanese curry|author=S&B Company}}</ref> and introduced it to Japan during the [[Meiji period]], after Japan ended its policy of national self-isolation ([[Sakoku]]), and curry in Japan was categorised as a [[Yōshoku|Western dish]]. Its spread across the country is commonly attributed to its use in the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Army]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Navy]] which adopted it extensively as convenient field and naval canteen cooking, allowing even conscripts from the remotest countryside to experience the dish. The [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]] traditionally have curry every Friday for lunch and many ships have their own unique recipes.

The standard Japanese curry contains [[onion]]s, [[carrot]]s, [[potato]]es, and sometimes [[celery]], and a meat that is cooked in a large pot. Sometimes grated [[apple]]s or [[honey]] are added for additional sweetness and other vegetables are sometimes used instead. For the meat, [[pork]], [[beef]] and [[Chicken (food)|chicken]] are the most popular, in order of decreasing popularity. In northern and eastern Japan including [[Tokyo]], pork is the most popular meat for curry. Beef is more common in western Japan, including [[Osaka]], and in [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]] chicken is favoured.<ref>[http://curryken.fc2web.com/minzoku/minzoku.htm The Curry Rice Research] (in Japanese)</ref> Curry seasoning is commonly sold in the form of a condensed brick which dissolves in the mixture of meat and vegetables.

Sometimes the curry-rice is topped with breaded pork cutlet ([[tonkatsu]]); this is called "Katsu-curry". [[Korokke]] (potato croquettes) are also a common topping.

Apart from with rice, curry is also served over [[noodle]]s, possibly even on top of broth in addition, in dishes such as curry [[udon]] and curry [[ramen]]. It is also used as the filling in a fried [[curry bread]] pastry.

===Korea===
When the Japanese occupied Korea during the early 20th century, they introduced curry, and hence Korean curry is nearly identical to the Japanese version.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

==Britain==
{{See also|Anglo-Indian cuisine}}

===Historical development===
Historically, the word "curry" was first used in [[British cuisine]] to denote dishes of meat (often leftover lamb) in a Western-style sauce flavoured with [[curry powder]].

The first curry recipe in Britain appeared in ''[[Art of Cookery|The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy]]'' by [[Hannah Glasse]] in 1747.<ref>{{Cite book| title= The art of cookery, made plain and easy | author=Hannah Glasse | id=OCLC 4942063 | year = 1747}}</ref> The first edition of her book used only black pepper and coriander seeds for seasoning of "currey". By the fourth edition of the book, other ingredients such as turmeric and ginger were called for. The use of hot spices was not mentioned, which reflected the limited use of chili in India — [[chili pepper|chili plants]] had only been introduced into India around the late 15th century and at that time were only popular in southern India.

Many curry recipes are contained in 19th century cookbooks such as those of [[Charles Elmé Francatelli]] and [[Mrs Beeton]]. In ''[[Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management]]'', a recipe for curry powder is given that contains coriander, turmeric, cinnamon, cayenne, mustard, ginger, allspice and fenugreek; although she notes that it is more economical to purchase the powder at "any respectable shop".<ref>{{Cite book| title= Mrs. Beeton's book of household management | author=Isabella Mary Beeton | page=215 | isbn=0-304-35726-X | year = 1861}}</ref>

<!--However, the use of fresh spices such as ginger and [[garlic]], and preparation of an initial masala from freshly ground dried spices are sometimes used.-->
According to legend, one 19th century attempt at curry resulted in the invention of [[Worcestershire sauce]].<ref>{{Cite book| title= Curry: A tale of cooks and conquerors | author=Lizzie Collingham | isbn=0-09-943786-4 | year = 2006 | publisher = Vintage | chapter = Curry Powder| pages=149–150 }}</ref>

Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, curry grew increasingly popular in Britain owing to the large number of British civil servants and military personnel associated with the [[British Raj]]. Following World War II, curry became even more popular in Britain owing to the large number of immigrants from South Asia.

Curry has become an integral part of British cuisine, so much so that, since the late 1990s, [[chicken tikka masala]] has been referred to as "a true British national dish".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/race/story/0,,657407,00.html|title=Robin Cook's chicken tikka masala speech|accessdate=12 December 2006 | work=The Guardian | location=London | date=19 April 2001}}</ref> It is now available on [[InterCity (British Rail)|Intercity]] rail trains, as a flavour for [[potato chip|crisp]]s and even as a pizza topping.

Other British curry derivatives include "[[Coronation chicken]]", a cold dish, often used as a sandwich filling, invented to commemorate the coronation of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1953 – and '''curry sauce''' (or '''curry gravy'''), usually served warm with traditional British fast food dishes such as [[French fried potatoes|chips]]. Curry sauce occasionally includes [[Sultana (grape)|sultana]]s.

====Curry house====
In 1810, the entrepreneur [[Sake Dean Mahomed]], from the [[Bengal Presidency]], opened the first Indian curry house in England: the [[Hindoostanee Coffee House]] in London.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Curry house founder is honoured|date=29 September 2005|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4290124.stm|accessdate=9 October 2008 | location=London}}</ref> (Curry was served prior to this in some London [[Coffee House|coffee houses]].) <ref>{{cite web|last=Jahangir |first=Rumeana |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8370054.stm |title=How Britain got the hots for curry |publisher=BBC News |date=26 November 2009 |accessdate=22 October 2013}}</ref>

The first modern "upscale" Indian restaurant in Britain is thought to have been The Shafi in 1915,<ref>Grove, Peter and Colleen.  ''The Flavours of History.'' (London?: Godiva Books, 2011).</ref>  followed by [[Veeraswamy]] in London's Regent Street, founded in 1926.<ref>Basu, Shrabani. ''Curry: The Story of the Nation's Favourite Dish.'' (Stroud, Gloucestershire: Sutton Publishing, c.2003), p.127.</ref>

Bengalis in the UK settled in big cities with industrial employment. In London, they settled in the East End. For centuries, the East End has been the first port of call for many immigrants working in the docks and shipping from east Bengal. Their regular stopover paved the way for food and curry outlets to be opened up catering for an all-male workforce as family migration and settlement took place some decades later. [[Brick Lane]] in the East [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]] is famous for its many curry houses.

Until the early 1970s, more than three-quarters of Indian restaurants in Britain were identified as being owned and run by people of Bengali origin. Most were run by migrants from East Pakistan, which became Bangladesh in 1971. Bangladeshi restaurateurs overwhelmingly come from the northeastern division of [[Sylhet Division|Sylhet]]. Until 1998, as many as 85% of curry restaurants in the UK were [[British Bangladeshi]] restaurants,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.curryhouse.co.uk/scene/ethnshow.htm|title=UK Curry Scene|accessdate=12 December 2006}}</ref> but in 2003 this figure declined to just over 65%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/177_food/page5.shtml|title=Indian Curry in London|accessdate=12 December 2006}}</ref> Currently, the dominance of Bangladeshi restaurants is generally declining in some parts of London and the further north one travels. In Glasgow, there are more restaurants of Punjabi origin than any other.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.menumagazine.co.uk/book/restauranthistory.html|title=The history of the "ethnic" restaurant in Britain|accessdate=12 December 2006}}</ref>

Regardless of the ethnic origin of a restaurant's ownership, the menu will often be influenced by the wider [[South Asia]] (sometimes including [[Nepalese cuisine|Nepalese dishes]]), and sometimes cuisines from further afield (such as [[Cuisine of Iran|Persian dishes]]). Some British variations on Indian food are now being exported from the U.K. to India.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/8635456.stm|title=Can the British curry take off in India?|accessdate=23 April 2010 | work=BBC News | date=21 April 2010}}</ref> British-style curry restaurants are also popular in [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].

This cuisine is characterised by the use of a common base for all the sauces to which spices are added when individual dishes are prepared. The standard "feedstock" is usually a sautéed mixture of onion, garlic and fresh ginger, to which various spices are added, depending on the recipe, but which may include: cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, chilies, peppercorns, cumin and mustard seeds. Ground coriander seed is widely used as a thickening agent, and turmeric is added for colour and its digestive qualities. Fresh or canned tomatoes and bell peppers are a common addition.

Better quality restaurants will normally make up new sauces on a daily basis, using fresh ingredients wherever possible and grinding their own spices. More modest establishments are more likely to resort to frozen or dried ingredients and pre-packaged spice mixtures{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}.

====Terminology====
Restaurants in Great Britain have adopted a number of Indian terms to identify popular dishes. Although the names may derive from traditional dishes, often the recipes do not. Representative names include:

* Bhuna – medium, thick sauce, some vegetables (''bhunna'' in Urdu means "to be fried").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bhuna |title=Bhuna &#124; Define Bhuna at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=22 October 2013}}</ref>
* [[Biryani]] – spiced rice and meat cooked together and usually served with vegetable curry sauce.
* Curry – the most common name for a meat dish (most often chicken or lamb) with a medium-spicy, brown, gravy-like sauce.
* [[Dhansak]] – in the curry house, it may be made with either lamb or chicken and frequently contains pineapple, though this is not original.<ref>Chapman, Pat. ''Favourite Restaurant Curries.'' (The Curry Club). (London: Piatkus, c.1988), p.96.</ref> The name derives from a Parsi dish of mutton cooked with lentils (''dal'') and vegetables.
* [[Dupiaza]]/dopiaza – medium curry (the word means "double onion", referring to the boiled and fried onions used as its primary ingredient).
* [[Jalfrezi]] – onion, green chili and a thick sauce.
* [[Kofta]] – refers to dishes containing meatballs (most frequently lamb), or vegetable substitutes (most often ground nuts).
* [[Korma]]/kurma – mild, yellow in colour, with almond and coconut powder.
* [[Madras curry sauce|Madras curry]] – "the standard hot, slightly sour curry at the Indian restaurant."<ref name="Chapman, Pat 1988 p.34">Chapman, Pat. ''Favourite Restaurant Curries.'' (The Curry Club). (London: Piatkus, c.1988), p.34.</ref>
* [[Pasanda]] – in the UK, a mild curry sauce made with cream, coconut milk, and almonds or cashews, served with lamb, chicken, or king prawns (US: jumbo shrimp). The name was derived from a Mughlai dish of lamb strips beaten to make them tender.
* Naga curry – relatively new extremely hot dish with unique savoury taste made with the highly aromatic [[Ghost pepper|Naga Morich]] or Bhut Jolokia chilli pepper.
* [[Pathia]] – a hot curry, generally similar to a "Madras" with the addition of lemon juice and tomato purée.
* [[Phall|Phaal]] – "this is the hottest curry the restaurants can make. There is nothing like it in India — it is pure invention."<ref>Chapman, Pat. ''Favourite Restaurant Curries.'' (The Curry Club). (London: Piatkus, c.1988), p.35.</ref>
* [[Rogan josh|Roghan josh]] – a medium-spicy curry, usually of lamb, with a deep red sauce containing tomatoes and paprika. It derives from a Kashmiri dish of the same name.
* [[Sambar (dish)|Sambar]] – medium-heat, sour curry made with lentils and tamarind.
* [[Vindaloo]] – generally regarded as the classic "hot" restaurant curry. Progressively hotter versions are sometimes called "tindaloo" and "bindaloo".<ref name="Chapman, Pat 1988 p.34"/>
<!-- although a true vindaloo does not specify any particular level of spiciness. The name has European origins, derived from the Portuguese term "vinha d'alhos", a marinade containing [[wine]] ("vinho"), or sometimes vinegar, and [[garlic]] ("alho"), used to prevent the pork from going off in hot weather.-->

The [[tandoor]] was introduced into Britain in the 1960s, and [[tandoori]] and tikka chicken became popular dishes.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Other dishes may feature with varying strengths, with those of north Indian origin, such as [[butter chicken]], tending to be mild, and recipes from the south of India tending to be hotter.

====Balti====

Baltis are a style of curry thought to have been developed in [[Birmingham]], [[England]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oed.com/bbcwordhunt/list.html#balti |title=Wordhunt appeal list - Balderdash Wordhunt - Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Oed.com |date= |accessdate=8 June 2009}}</ref> which have spread to other western countries and are traditionally cooked and served in the same, typically cast iron pot called a '''balty'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-18490695 |title=BBC News - Birmingham Balti curry seeks EU protected status |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=19 June 2012 |accessdate=22 October 2013}}</ref>

===At home===
The popularity of curry houses in Britain has encouraged a number of publications aiming to show how the curry house cuisine, as opposed to authentic Indian cuisine, can be recreated at home. A notable publication is Kris Dhillon's book ''The Curry Secret'', which was first published in 1989 but has been reprinted as recently as 2008.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Dhillon | first = Kris | title = The Curry Secret | publisher = Right Way | isbn = 978-0-7160-2191-9}}</ref> Dhillon reports having had experience working in her own Indian-style restaurant before publishing the book.<ref>

The series consisted of three articles published in the [[Curry Club Magazine]].<ref>{{Cite news| last = Edwards | first = Bruce | title = Curry House Cookery | work = Curry Club Magazine, Winter issue 1990 }}</ref> Edwards published a follow-up series in the same magazine three years later, using information he had since learned from a behind-the-scenes look at an Indian take-away restaurant.<ref>{{Cite news| last = Edwards | first = Bruce | title = Curry House Cookery | work = Curry Club Magazine, first issue of 1993 }}</ref> Edwards' articles are still used as a reference by members of the online forum "Curry Recipes Online", where he has also informally published a few brief further follow-ups.<ref>{{cite web| last = Edwards | first = Bruce | title = Comments received from Bruce Edwards 14 October 2008 | url = http://cr0.co.uk/curry/index.php?topic=3074.0 | accessdate = 5 April 2010 }}</ref>

==South Africa==
{{Main|South African cuisine#Indian cookery}}

[[African cuisine|African]] curries, [[Cape Malay]] curries and [[Natal, South Africa|Natal]] curries include the traditional Natal curry, the Durban curry, [[bunny chow]], and roti rolls. The history of South African curries goes back 250 years, when the first Indians arrived on the shores of the Natal Colony, well before the boom of British curries.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

[[Durban]] has the largest single population of Indians outside of India, who have been developing traditional Natal curries since their arrival. Natal curries are mostly based on South Indian dishes and mostly consist of simple spiced lamb and chicken dishes (with large amounts of [[ghee]] and oils), but also include very complex and elaborate seafood, chicken and lamb specialties (chicken and prawn curry is a Natal favourite). European recipes have also evolved alongside [[Indian South African]] curries. European versions use mainly traditional recipes with the addition of [[wine|red wine]], [[milk]], [[cream]], vanilla or [[butter]] instead of ghee.

Bunny chow, a South African standard, has spread in popularity throughout the country and into other southern African countries and countries with large South African immigrant populations. It consists of either lamb, chicken or bean curry poured into a tunnelled-out loaf of [[bread]] to be eaten with one's fingers. The roti roll is another classic take-away curry that could either be a curry in a very flat roti bread (similar to a kebab bread) or the classic "chip, cheese and curry" roll which basically consists of [[French fries|fried chips]] with melted [[cheese]] and curry gravy rolled into a roti roll.

==West Indies==
In the [[West Indies]], curry is a very popular dish. The Indian indentured servants that were brought over from India by different European powers, brought this dish, as well as their culture, to the West Indies. In Jamaica and Trinidad, curried goat is prominently featured. Curry can be found at both inexpensive and upscale Caribbean restaurants, and ingredients can range from chicken or vegetables to shellfish such as shrimp and scallops. Examples of curries in the West Indies include:

* [[Cuisine of Jamaica|Jamaica]]: Especially curried chicken, goat, fish and shrimp.
* [[Cuisine of Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad and Tobago]]: Most notably curried chicken, duck, goat, beef, shrimp, and curry aloo, along with various curried wild meats.
* [[Cuisine of Guyana|Guyana]]: Chicken curry, goat curry, duck curry, shrimp curry, beef curry (eaten by Muslims and Christians), aloo curry (potato), fish (different varieties) curry, etc..

==Other==
* [[African cuisine|Central Africa]]: Groundnut stew, though not technically a curry, is a similar style.
* [[Central Europe]]: [[Goulash]] is a spicy stew or soup usually made with paprika, garlic, potatoes, beef or pork and dill. Not served with rice.
* [[Ethiopian cuisine|Ethiopia]]: [[Wat (food)|Wat]], a thick, heavily spiced stew.
* [[Fiji]], [[Samoa]], and [[Tonga]]: Generally known as "kare" or "kale", the spice is a popular ingredient in curried lamb, mutton, and chicken stew. Often prepared with coconut milk and accompanied by rice or taro.
* [[German cuisine|Germany]]: [[Currywurst]].
* [[Mexico]]: Mole, which also originally meant sauce, features different regional variations and combinations of chilies, spices, and chocolate.

==Curry powder==
{{Main| Curry powder}}
Curry powder is a spice mixture of widely varying composition developed by the British during the days of the ''Raj'' as a means of approximating the taste of Indian cuisine at home. [[spice mix|Masala]] refers to spices, and this is the name given to the thick and pasty sauce based on a combination of spices with ghee (clarified butter), butter, palm oil or coconut milk. Most commercial curry powders available in Britain, the U.S. and Canada, rely heavily on ground turmeric, in turn producing a very yellow sauce. Lesser ingredients in these Western yellow curry powders are often coriander, cumin, [[fenugreek]], mustard, chili, black pepper and salt. By contrast, curry powders and curry pastes produced and consumed in India are extremely diverse; some red, some yellow, some brown; some with five spices and some with as many as 20 or more. Besides the previously mentioned spices, other commonly found spices in different curry powders in India are allspice, white pepper, ground mustard, ground ginger, cinnamon, roasted cumin, cloves, nutmeg, mace, green cardamom seeds or black cardamom pods, bay leaves and coriander seeds.

Curry powder is used as an incidental ingredient in other cuisines, including for example a "curry sauce" (''sauce au curry'', sometimes even ''au cari'') variation of the classic French [[béchamel]].
