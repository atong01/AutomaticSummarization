{{trade bloc}}

An '''economic and monetary union''' is a type of [[trade bloc]] which is composed of an [[economic union]] ([[common market]] and [[customs union]]) with a [[monetary union]]. It is to be distinguished from a mere [[monetary union]] (e.g. the [[Latin Monetary Union]] in the 19th century), which does not involve a common market.  This is the sixth stage of [[economic integration]]. EMU is established through a currency-related [[trade pact]]. An intermediate step between pure EMU and a [[complete economic integration]] is the [[fiscal union]].

==List of economic and monetary unions==
<!-- listed below are 'economic and monetary unions' only – see respective articles for lists of customs unions; monetary unions; common markets; economic unions; customs and monetary unions -->
