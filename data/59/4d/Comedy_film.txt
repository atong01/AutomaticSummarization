'''Comedy''' is a genre of [[film]] in which the main emphasis is on [[humour]]. These films are designed to entertain the audience through amusement, and most often work by exaggerating characteristics of real life for humorous effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/comedyfilms.html |title=Comedy Films |publisher=Filmsite.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-29}}</ref> Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (the [[black comedy]] being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. Later, when the sound came in 1927, Comedy films took another swing, due to laughter can now be caused not only by the burlesque situations, but also the dialogues.

Comedy, unlike other [[film genre]]s, puts much more focus on individual stars, with many former [[stand-up comics]] transitioning to the film industry due to their popularity. While many comic films are lighthearted stories with no intent other than to amuse, others contain political or social commentary (such as ''[[Wag the Dog]]'' and ''[[Man of the Year (2006 film)|Man of the Year]]'').

==Types==
A '''[[Comedy of manners]]''' film satirises the manners and affectations of a social class, often represented by stock characters. Also, the plot of the comedy is often concerned with an illicit love affair or some other scandal. However, the plot is generally less important for its comedic effect than its witty dialogue. This form of comedy has a long ancestry, dating back at least as far as ''[[Much Ado about Nothing]]'' created by [[William Shakespeare]].

'''[[Slapstick|Slapstick films]]''' involve exaggerated, boisterous action to create impossible and humorous situations. Because it relies predominately on visual depictions of events, it does not require sound. Accordingly, the subgenre was ideal for silent movies and was prevalent during that era. Popular silent stars of the slapstick genre include [[Buster Keaton]], [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Roscoe Arbuckle]], and [[Harold Lloyd]]. Some of these stars, as well as acts such as [[Laurel and Hardy]] and [[The Three Stooges]], also found success incorporating slapstick comedy into sound films.

In a '''fish out of water comedy film''', the main character or character finds himself in an unusual environment, which drives most of the humour. Situations can be swapping gender roles, as in ''[[Tootsie]]'' (1982); an age changing role, as in ''[[Big (film)|Big]]'' (1988); a freedom-loving individual fitting into a structured environment, as in ''[[Police Academy (film)|Police Academy]]'' (1984); a rural backwoodsman in the big city, as in ''[["Crocodile" Dundee]]'', and so forth. The Coen Brothers are known for using this technique in all of their films, though not always to comic effect. Some films including people fitting the "fish-out-of-water" bill include ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'' and ''[[A Serious Man]]''.

A '''[[Parody film|parody or spoof film]]''' is a comedy that satirizes other film genres or classic films. Such films employ sarcasm, stereotyping, mockery of scenes from other films, and the obviousness of meaning in a character's actions. Examples of this form include ''[[Mud and Sand]]'' (1922), ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' (1974), ''[[Airplane!]]'' (1980), ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' (1974) and ''[[Scary Movie]] (2000).

The '''anarchic comedy film''', as its name suggests, is a random or stream-of-consciousness type of humour which often lampoons a form of authority.<ref>{{cite web|title=Absurd Comedy|url=http://www.allmovie.com/subgenre/absurd-comedy-d622|publisher=Allmovies}}</ref>  The genre dates from the silent era, and the most famous examples of this type of film would be those produced by [[Monty Python]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Sexton|first=Timothy|title=Anarchic Comedy from the Silent Era to Monty Python|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/news/anarchic-comedy-silent-era-monty-python-173500945.html|publisher=Yahoo! Movies}}</ref>   Others include ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'' (1933) and ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'' .

The '''[[black comedy]]''' film deals with normally [[taboo]] subjects, including, death, murder, sexual relations, suicide and war, in a satirical manner.  Examples include ''[[Arsenic and Old Lace (film)|Arsenic and Old Lace]]'' (1944), ''[[Monsieur Verdoux]]'' (1947), ''[[Kind Hearts and Coronets]]'' (1949), ''[[The Ladykillers]]'' (1955), ''[[Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'' (1964), ''[[The Loved One]]'' (1965), ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' (1970), ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life]]'' (1983), ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'' (1985), ''[[War of the Roses (film)|The War of the Roses]]'' (1989), ''[[Heathers]]'' (1989), ''[[Your Friends & Neighbors]]'' (1998), ''[[Keeping Mum]]'' (2005), and ''[[Burn After Reading]]'' (2008).

'''[[Gross out]] films''' are a relatively recent development, and rely heavily on vulgar, sexual or "toilet" humour. Examples include ''[[Porky's]]'' (1982), ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]'' (1994), ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'' (1998), and ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' (1999).

The '''[[romantic comedy film]]''' subgenre typically involves the development of a relationship between a man and a woman. The stereotyped plot line follows the "boy-gets-girl", "boy-loses-girl", "boy gets girl back again" sequence. Naturally there are innumerable variants to this plot, and much of the generally light-hearted comedy lies in the social interactions and sexual tensions between the pair. Examples of this style of film include ''[[It (1927 film)|It]]'' (1927), ''[[City Lights]]'' (1931), ''[[It's a Wonderful World (1939 film)|It's a Wonderful World]]'' (1939), ''[[The Shop Around the Corner]]'' (1940), ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]'' (1954), ''[[Annie Hall]]'' (1977), ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'' (1989), ''[[Pretty Woman]]'' (1990), ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'' (1994) and "[[There's Something About Mary]]" .

It was not uncommon for the early [[romantic comedy film]] to also be a '''[[screwball comedy film]]'''. This form of comedy film was particularly popular during the 1930s and 1940s. There is no consensus definition of this film style, and it is often loosely applied to slapstick or romantic comedy films. Typically it can include a romantic element, an interplay between people of different economic strata, quick and witty [[repartee]], some form of role reversal, and a happy ending. Some examples of the screwball comedy are: ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934), ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' (1938), ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|Philadelphia Story]]'' (1940), ''[[His Girl Friday]]'' (1940), and more recently ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]'' (1972).

===Hybrid genres===

====Action comedy====
Films in this subgenre blend comic antics and action where the film stars combine wit and one-liners with a thrilling plot and daring stunts. The genre became a specific draw in North America in the eighties when comedians such as [[Eddie Murphy]] started taking more action oriented roles such as in ''[[48 Hrs.]]'' and ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]''. These type of films are often [[buddy films]], with mismatched partners such as in ''[[Midnight Run]]'', ''[[Rush Hour (1998 film)|Rush Hour]]'', ''[[21 Jump Street (film)|21 Jump Street]]'', ''[[Bad Boys (1995 film)|Bad Boys]]'', ''[[Starsky and Hutch (film)|Starsky and Hutch]]'' and ''[[Hot Fuzz]]''. [[Slapstick]] [[martial arts films]] became a mainstay of [[Hong Kong action cinema]] through the work of [[Jackie Chan]] among others. It may also focus on [[superhero]]es such as ''[[The Incredibles]]'', ''[[Hancock (film)|Hancock]]'' , ''[[Kick-Ass (film)|Kick-Ass]]'' and ''[[Mystery Men (film)|Mystery Men]].

====Comedy horror====
Comedy horror is a type of horror film in which the usual dark themes are treated with a humorous approach. These films either use goofy horror clichés such as in ''[[Scream (film series)|Scream]]'', ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'', ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (1986 film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'', ''[[Haunted Mansion (film)|Haunted Mansion]]'' and ''[[Scary Movie]]'' where campy styles are favoured.  Some are much more subtle and don't parody horror, such as ''[[An American Werewolf In London]]''. Another style of comedy horror can also rely on over the top violence and gore such as in ''[[Dead Alive]]'' (1992), ''[[Evil Dead]]'' (1981), ''[[The Toxic Avenger (film)|The Toxic Avenger]]'' (1984), and ''[[Club Dread]]'' - such films are sometimes known as ''splatstick'', a portmanteau of the words ''splatter'' and ''slapstick''. It would be reasonable to put ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' in this category.

====Fantasy comedy====
Fantasy comedy films are types of films that uses [[magic (fantasy)|magic]], [[supernatural]] and or mythological figures for comic purposes. Most fantasy comedy includes an element of parody, or satire, turning many of the fantasy conventions on their head such as the hero becoming a cowardly fool, the princess being a klutz. Examples of these films include ''[[Being John Malkovich]]'', ''[[Ernest Saves Christmas]]'', ''[[Ernest Scared Stupid]]'', ''[[Night at the Museum]]'', ''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]'', ''[[Click (2006 film)|Click]]'' and ''[[Shrek]]''.

====Sci-fi comedy====
Sci-fi comedy films, like most hybrid genre of comedy use the elements of [[science fiction films]] to over the top extremes and exaggerated science fiction stereotypical characters. Examples of these types of films include ''[[Back to the Future]]'', ''[[Spaceballs]]'', ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', ''[[Evolution (2001 film)|Evolution]]'', ''[[Innerspace]]'', ''[[Galaxy Quest]]'', ''[[Mars Attacks!]]'', ''[[Men in Black (series)|Men in Black]]'' and ''[[The World's End (film)|The World's End]]''.

====Military comedy====
{{anchor|Service comedy}}Military comedy films involve comic situations in a military setting. When a film is primarily about the experience of civilians called into military service and still feeling out of place, it may be referred to as a "service comedy". Because war is such a grim subject, many military comedies are set in peacetime or during wartime but away from battle zones. Military and service comedies include:
