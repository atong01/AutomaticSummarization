<article title='Compound_turbine'><paragraph>A<space/><bold>compound turbine</bold><space/>is a<space/><link><target>steam turbine</target></link><space/>in which there are two casings, a high-<link><target>pressure</target></link><space/>casing and a low-pressure casing, operating in concert to extract work from a single source of steam. The steam is partially expanded in the high-pressure casing, then exhausted to the low-pressure casing.<space/></paragraph><heading level='2'>Tandem compound or cross compound</heading><paragraph>The rotor arrangement can be either tandem-compound in which the two<space/><link><target>axle</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>are joined end to end, or cross-compound in which the two turbines have separate axles.
