The original posters showed J. M. Bennett himself: a kindly-looking old man offering guidance and support to would-be students with the phrase &quot;Let me be your father&quot; attached. According to Burgess, after Bennett's death, his son took over the company, and the posters were replaced with pictures of the son (who looked imposing and stern in contrast to his father's kindly demeanor) with the text &quot;Let me be your big brother.&quot;</paragraph><paragraph>Additional speculation from Douglas Kellner of<space/><link><target>UCLA</target></link><space/>argued that Big Brother represents<space/><link><target>Joseph Stalin</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/index.html</arg><arg name="title">Douglas Kellner, George F.

At one point, Winston Smith, the protagonist of Orwell's novel, tries &quot;to remember in what year he had first heard mention of Big Brother. He thought it must have been at some time in the sixties, but it was impossible to be certain. In the Party histories, of course, Big Brother figured as the leader and guardian of the Revolution since its very earliest days. His exploits had been gradually pushed backwards in time until already they extended into the fabulous world of the forties and the thirties, when the capitalists in their strange cylindrical hats still rode through the streets of London...&quot;</paragraph><paragraph>In the book<space/><italics>The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism</italics>, read by Winston Smith and purportedly written by Goldstein, Big Brother is referred to as infallible and all-powerful. No-one has ever seen him and there is a reasonable certainty that he will never die. He is simply &quot;the guise in which the Party chooses to exhibit itself to the world&quot;, since the emotions of love, fear and reverence are more easily focussed on an individual (if only a face on the hoardings and a voice on the telescreens), than an organisation. When Winston Smith is later arrested,<space/><link><target>O'Brien (Nineteen Eighty-Four)</target><part>O'Brien</part></link><space/>repeats that Big Brother will never die. When Smith asks if Big Brother exists, O'Brien describes him as &quot;the embodiment of the Party&quot; and says that he will exist as long as the Party exists. When Winston asks &quot;Does Big Brother exist the same way I do?&quot; (meaning is Big Brother an actual human being), O'Brien replies &quot;You do not exist&quot; (meaning that Smith is now an<space/><link><target>unperson</target></link>; an example of<space/><link><target>doublethink</target></link>).</paragraph><heading level='3'>Cult of personality</heading><paragraph>A spontaneous ritual of devotion to Big Brother (&quot;BB&quot;) is illustrated at the end of the &quot;<link><target>Two Minutes Hate</target></link>&quot;:</paragraph><paragraph><template><target>quote</target><arg>
At this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep, slow, rhythmic chant of 'B-B! .... B-B! .... B-B!'—over and over again, very slowly, with a long pause between the first 'B' and the second—a heavy murmurous sound, somehow curiously savage, in the background of which one seemed to hear the stamps of naked feet and the throbbing of tom-toms. For perhaps as much as thirty seconds they kept it up. It was a refrain that was often heard in moments of overwhelming emotion. Partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom and majesty of Big Brother, but still more it was an act of self-hypnosis, a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise.<ref>Orwell, George (1949).
