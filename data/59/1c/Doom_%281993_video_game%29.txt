It is considered one of the most significant and influential titles in the video game industry, for having ushered in the popularity of the first-person shooter genre. The original game was divided into three nine-level episodes and was distributed via [[shareware]] and [[mail order]]. '''''The Ultimate Doom''''', an updated release of the original game featuring a fourth episode, was released in 1995 and sold at retail.

In ''Doom'', players assume the role of an unnamed [[space marine]], who became popularly known as "[[Doomguy]]", fighting his way through hordes of invading demons from [[Hell]].<ref name="game_SeeT">{{Cite web| title = See The Original Sketch And Model That Inspired Doom's Doomguy| author = Kyle Hillard| work = GameInformer| date = 2014-12-13| accessdate = 2015-03-26| url = http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2014/12/13/see-the-original-sketch-and-model-that-inspired-doom-39-s-doomguy.aspx}}</ref> With one third of the game, nine levels, distributed as [[shareware]], ''Doom'' was played by an estimated 15–20&nbsp;million people<ref name="Armitage">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=znUoeG5ulvQC&lpg=PA14&dq=doom%20copies%20sold&pg=PA14#v=onepage&q=doom%20copies%20sold&f=false | title=Networking and Online Games: Understanding and Engineering Multiplayer Internet Games | publisher=John Wiley & Sons | author=Armitage, Grenville ; Claypool, Mark ; Branch, Philip | year=2006 | location=Chichester, England | pages=14 | isbn=0470030461}}</ref> within two years of its release, popularizing the mode of gameplay and spawning a [[Video game culture|gaming subculture]]. In addition to popularizing the [[first-person shooter|FPS]] genre, it pioneered immersive [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]], networked [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] gaming, and support for customized additions and modifications via packaged files in a data archive known as "[[Doom WAD|WAD]]s". As a sign of its effect on the industry, first-person shooter games from the genre's boom in the 1990s, helped in no small part by the game's release, became known simply as "[[Doom clone|''Doom'' clones]]". Its graphic violence, as well as satanic imagery, made ''Doom'' the subject of [[video game controversy|controversy]].

The [[Doom (series)|''Doom'' franchise]] was later continued with the follow-up ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'' (1994) and numerous [[expansion pack]]s, including ''[[Master Levels for Doom II]]'' (1995), and ''[[Final Doom]]'' (1996). Originally released for [[PC DOS]], the games have later been [[porting|ported]] to numerous other platforms. Once the game's [[source code]] was released in 1997, it spawned even more adaptations, as fans further ported the code to countless devices. The series started to lose mainstream appeal as the technology of the [[Doom engine|''Doom'' game engine]] was surpassed in the mid-1990s, although fans have continued making [[Wads|WADs]], [[speedrun]]s, and modifications to the original. The franchise again received popular attention in 2004 with the release of ''[[Doom 3]]'', a retelling of the original game using new technology, and an associated 2005 [[Doom (film)|''Doom'' motion picture]]. ''[[Doom (2016 video game)|Doom 4]]'' was announced as in production in 2008 and was later retitled simply as ''Doom''.

==Plot==
''Doom'', a [[science fiction]]/[[Horror (genre)|horror]] themed video game, has a background which is given in the game's instruction manual; the rest of the story is advanced with short messages displayed between each section of the game (called ''episodes''), the action as the [[player character]] progresses through the [[Level (video games)|levels]], and some visual cues.

The player takes the role of an unnamed space marine ("[[Doomguy]]") who has been punitively posted to [[Mars]] after assaulting his commanding officer, who ordered his unit to fire on civilians. The Martian space marine base acts as security for the Union Aerospace Corporation, a multi-planetary conglomerate, which is performing secret experiments with [[teleportation]] by creating gateways between the two moons of Mars, [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]]. Mars is considered by space marines to be the dullest assignment imaginable. This all changes when the UAC experiments go horribly wrong. Computer systems on Phobos malfunction, Deimos disappears entirely, and "something fragging evil" starts pouring out of the gateway, killing or possessing all UAC personnel.

Responding to a frantic distress call from the overrun scientists, the Martian marine unit is quickly sent by ship from Mars to Phobos to investigate, where the player character is left to guard the perimeter with only a pistol while the rest of the group proceeds inside. The marine hears assorted radio messages, gunfire, and screams, followed by silence: "Seems your buddies are dead." The player cannot navigate the ship off of Phobos alone and sees that the only way out is to fight through the Phobos complex.

As the last man standing, the player character's mission is to fight through the entire onslaught of demonic enemies by himself in order to keep them from attacking Earth. ''Knee-Deep in the Dead'', the first episode and the only one in the [[shareware]] version, is set in the high-tech military bases, power plants, computer centers and geological anomalies on Phobos. It ends with the player character entering the teleporter leading to Deimos, only to be overwhelmed by monsters.

In the second episode, ''The Shores of Hell'', the marine has successfully teleported to Deimos. He fights his way through installations on Deimos, similar to those on Phobos, but warped and distorted from the demon invasion and interwoven with beastly architecture. After defeating the titanic [[Cyberdemon]], the marine discovers the truth about the vanished moon: it is floating above [[Hell]].

The third episode, called ''Inferno'', begins after the marine climbs off Deimos to the surface. The marine fights his way through Hell and defeats the Spider Mastermind that planned the invasion. Then a hidden doorway back to Earth opens for the hero, who has "proven too tough for Hell to contain". However, a burning city and a rabbit's head impaled on a stake (named in ''The Ultimate Doom'' as the marine's pet rabbit, Daisy) show that the demons have invaded Earth, setting the stage for ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth|Hell on Earth]]''. The [[Doom II: Hell on Earth|sequel]] [[retcon]]s the events of ''Doom'' as an alien invasion of the Mars moon bases.

In ''The Ultimate Doom'' expansion, in the fourth episode ''Thy Flesh Consumed'', it tells that the marine fought valiantly against the hordes of demons that the Spider Mastermind sent through that hidden doorway but ultimately the forces of Hell prevailed in the invasion of Earth. The locales of ''Thy Flesh Consumed'' are varied, including a mix of high-tech bases and demonic temples, though the atmosphere appears to be Earth.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Doom ingame 1.png|thumb|left|"Episode I: Knee-Deep in the Dead" takes place in the research, industrial and military facilities on the surface of [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]]. In the screenshot, the player armed with a chainsaw confronts a basic zombie marine on a bridge over a chemical waste storage]]

Being a [[first-person shooter]], ''Doom'' is experienced through the eyes of [[Doomguy|the main character]]. This character is not named throughout the game. The game's designer, [[John Romero]], has pointed out that this is so the player feels more involved in the game: "There was never a name for the DOOM marine because it's supposed to be you."<ref>{{cite web |first=John |last=Romero |title=''Doom Marine's Name'' forum post at Planet Romero |year=2002 |url=http://rome.ro/smf/index.php/topic,1521.msg31827.html#msg31827 |accessdate=August 23, 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140203112006/http://rome.ro/smf/index.php/topic,1521.msg31827.html |archivedate=2014-02-03 }}</ref> At its core, the gameplay is similar to classic [[shooter game]]s, presenting the player with the challenge of surviving while shooting every enemy in sight, but with its [[2.5D|pseudo-3D]] [[First person (video games)|first-person perspective]] giving environments a spatial representation that has a major effect on the level design and gameplay experience.<ref>{{citation|title=An Introduction to Games Studies: Games in Culture|first=Frans|last= Mäyrä|publisher=[[SAGE Publications|SAGE]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4129-3445-9 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iI0kAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=April 10, 2011|page=104|quote=The gameplay of Doom is at its core familiar from the early classics like ''Space Invaders'' ... it presents the player with the clear and simple challenge of surviving while shooting everything that moves.}}</ref>

In order for the game to be completed, the marine must fight through Phobos, Deimos, and then Hell itself, each presented as an episode containing eight distinct levels, along with an optional ninth hidden level for each one. ''The Ultimate Doom'', the retail store version of the game, adds a fourth episode, ''Thy Flesh Consumed.'' Set between the end of ''Doom'' and before ''Doom II'' and featuring the first contribution of [[Tim Willits]] to the Doom franchise, the fourth episode was designed for expert Doom players seeking a major challenge (being considerably more difficult than the original episodes).

The objective of each level is simply to locate the exit room that leads to the next area, marked with an [[exit sign]] and/or a special kind of door, while surviving all hazards on the way. Among the obstacles are demonic monsters, pits of [[Toxic waste|toxic or radioactive slime]], ceilings that lower and crush anything below them, and locked doors which require a [[keycard]], skull-shaped key device, or a remote switch to be located. The levels are sometimes labyrinthine and feature plenty of items such as additional ammo, health increases and other "[[power-up]]s" along the way, as well as the occasional secret areas which are not immediately obvious as a reward for players who explore more carefully. To ease navigation through the levels, a full screen [[automap]] is available and shows the areas explored to that point. Many versions of ''Doom'' (and its sequels) include secret levels which are accessed by the player discovering alternate exits, often hidden behind secret doors, hidden passageways, or in areas which are difficult to reach. Despite carrying masses of high-tech weaponry, the main character can still run at blistering speeds.

''Doom'' is notable for the [[weapon]]s arsenal available to the marine, which became prototypical for first-person shooters. The player character starts armed only with a [[pistol]], and fists in case the [[ammunition]] runs out, but larger weapons can be picked up: these are a [[chainsaw]], a [[shotgun]], a [[minigun|chaingun]], a [[Shoulder-launched missile weapon|rocket launcher]], a [[plasma rifle]], and finally the immensely powerful [[BFG (weapon)|BFG 9000]]. There is a wide array of power-ups, such as a [[backpack]] that increases the player character's ammunition-carrying capacity, [[armour|armor]], [[first aid kit]]s to restore health, the [[Berserker#Modern context|berserk]] pack which both restores health and causes the player's punching attack to deal enormous damage, supernatural blue orbs (named ''soul spheres'' in the manuals) that boost the player character's health up to a maximum of 200%, nightvision, computer maps (which show every area of the level), partial invisibility, and protective suits that allow the player to survive in toxic acids.

The enemy monsters in ''Doom'' make up the central gameplay element. The player character faces them in large numbers, with the number generally increased when the higher of the game's five [[difficulty level]]s is chosen when starting a new game. There are 10 types of monsters, including [[Spirit possession|possessed]] undead humans as well as demons, all which vary in many ways. The monsters have very simple behavior, consisting of either walking toward their opponent, or attacking by throwing fireballs, biting, and scratching. They will [[monster infighting|fight each other]] if one monster is accidentally harmed by another (though most monsters are not harmed by the ranged attacks of their own kind).

Aside from the [[single-player|single player]] game mode, ''Doom'' features two [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] modes playable over a network: "[[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative]]", in which two to four players team up, and "[[deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]]", in which two to four players play against each other. [[Online multiplayer]] was eventually made available through the [[DWANGO]] service.<ref name="mastersofdoom" />

==Development==
{{Main|Development of Doom}}

The development of ''Doom'' started in 1992, when [[John D. Carmack]] developed a new 3D [[game engine]], the [[Doom engine]], while the rest of the id Software team finished the ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'' [[prequel]], ''[[Spear of Destiny (computer game)|Spear of Destiny]]''. When the [[Video game design|game design]] phase began in late 1992, the main thematic influences were the [[science fiction]] [[action film]] ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' and the [[horror film]] ''[[Evil Dead II]]''. The title of the game was picked by John Carmack: "There is a scene in ''[[The Color of Money]]'' where [[Tom Cruise]] {{sic}} shows up at a pool hall with a custom pool cue in a case. 'What do you have in there?' asks someone. 'Doom.' replied Cruise with a cocky grin. That, and the resulting carnage, was how I viewed us springing the game on the industry."<ref>{{cite web |author=Doomworld |title=Interview with John Carmack |url=http://doomworld.com/interviews/int7.shtml |accessdate=November 15, 2005|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131028050052/http://www.doomworld.com:80/interviews/int7.shtml |archivedate=2013-10-28 }}</ref>

Designer [[Tom Hall]] wrote an elaborate [[design document]] called the ''Doom Bible'', according to which the game would feature a detailed storyline, multiple player characters, and a number of interactive features.<ref>{{cite web |author=Hall, Tom |title=The Doom Bible |year=1992 |publisher=Doomworld (1998) |url=http://5years.doomworld.com/doombible/ |accessdate=November 15, 2005|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131130021931/http://5years.doomworld.com:80/doombible/ |archivedate=2013-11-30 }}</ref> However, many of his ideas were discarded during development in favor of simpler design primarily advocated by John Carmack, resulting in Hall in the end being forced to resign due to not contributing effectively in the direction the rest of the team was going. Most of the [[level design]] that ended up in the final game is that of John Romero and [[Sandy Petersen]]. The graphics, by [[Adrian Carmack]], [[Kevin Cloud]] and [[Gregor Punchatz]], were modelled in various ways: although much was drawn or painted, several of the monsters were built from sculptures in [[clay]] or [[latex]], and some of the weapons are toy guns from [[Toys "R" Us]]. A [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]-[[Ambient music|ambient]] soundtrack was supplied by [[Robert Prince (video game composer)|Bobby Prince]].<ref name="mastersofdoom">{{cite book |author=Kushner, David |title=[[Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture]] |publisher=Random House Publishing Group |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-375-50524-9}}</ref>

===Engine technology===
{{Main|Doom engine}}

''Doom''{{'}}s primary distinguishing feature at the time of its release was its relatively realistic [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]].<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=The First Pictures|journal=Maximum: The Video Game Magazine|issue=1|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=October 1995|pages=134–5|quote=Doom was praised for its sheer realism ...}}</ref> The advance from [[id Software]]'s previous game ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'' was enabled by several new features in the ''Doom'' engine, including height differences (all rooms in ''Wolfenstein 3D'' have the same height), non-[[perpendicular]] walls (all walls in ''Wolfenstein 3D'' run along a rectangular grid), full [[texture mapping]] of all surfaces (in ''Wolfenstein 3D'', floors and ceilings are flat colors) and varying light levels and custom [[palette (computing)|palette]]s (all areas in ''Wolfenstein 3D'' are fully lit at the same brightness). The latter contributed to ''Doom''{{'}}s visual authenticity, atmosphere and gameplay, as the use of darkness to frighten or confuse the player was nearly unheard of in games released prior to ''Doom''; palette modifications were used to enhance effects such as the berserk power-up which tints the player's vision red.

In contrast to the static levels of ''Wolfenstein 3D'', those in ''Doom'' are highly dynamic: platforms can lower and rise, floors can rise sequentially to form [[staircase]]s, and bridges can rise and fall. The immersive environments were enhanced further by the [[stereo sound]] system, which made it possible to roughly determine the direction and distance of a sound effect. The player is kept on guard by the grunts and growls of monsters, and receives occasional clues to finding secret areas in the form of sounds of hidden doors opening remotely. As in ''Wolfenstein 3D'', enemies can also become aware of the player's presence by hearing distant gunshots.

John Carmack had to make use of several tricks for these features to run smoothly on home computers of 1993. Most significantly, the ''Doom'' engine and levels are not truly three-dimensional; they are internally represented on a single [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]], with height differences stored separately as displacements (a similar technique is still used in many games to create expansive outdoor environments). This allows a two point perspective projection, with several design limitations: for example, it is not possible in the ''Doom'' engine to create one room over another room in a level. However, thanks to its two-dimensional property, the environment can be rendered very quickly, using a [[binary space partitioning]] method. Another benefit was the clarity of the automap, as that could be rendered with 2D vectors without any risk of overlapping. Additionally, the BSP tree technology created by Bruce Naylor was used.<ref>"In the Chain with ... John Romero", ''[[Retro Gamer]]'', issue 75, pp. 78–89.</ref>

Another important feature of the ''Doom'' engine is its modular data files, which allow most of the game's content to be replaced by loading custom [[Doom WAD|WAD files]]. ''Wolfenstein 3D'' was not designed to be expandable, but fans had nevertheless figured out how to create their own levels for it, and ''Doom'' was designed to further extend the possibilities. The ability to create custom scenarios contributed significantly to the game's popularity (see the section on [[#WADs|WADs]], below).

==Release==
[[File:Billdoom.png|thumb|To promote [[Windows 95]], [[Bill Gates]], aware of the video game's popularity, showcased a video presentation while digitally superimposed into ''Doom'']]

The development of ''Doom'' was surrounded by much anticipation. The large number of posts in Internet [[newsgroup]]s about ''Doom'' led to the SPISPOPD joke,<ref>SPISPOPD = Smashing Pumpkins Into Small Piles Of Putrid Debris [http://www.trilobite.org/spispopd/ Seth Cohn's S.P.I.S.P.O.P.D.] {{Wayback|url=http://www.trilobite.org/spispopd/|date =20130224215355}}</ref> to which a nod was given in the game in the form of a [[cheat code]]. In addition to news, rumors and [[screenshot]]s, unauthorized leaked [[alpha version]]s also circulated online. Many years later these alpha versions were sanctioned by id Software because of historical interest; they reveal how the game progressed from its early design stages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://toastytech.com/dooma/index.html |title=Doom Alphas and Betas|publisher=Nathan's Toasty Technology page |date= |accessdate=July 27, 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20121113094842/http://toastytech.com:80/dooma/index.html|archivedate=2012-11-13}}</ref> The first public version of ''Doom'' was uploaded to [[Software Creations BBS]] and an [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] server at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] on December 10, 1993.<ref>[http://www.gamers.org/docs/FAQ/doomfaq/intro.html The Official DOOM FAQ: Introduction] {{Wayback|url=http://www.gamers.org/docs/FAQ/doomfaq/intro.html|date =20120412063232}}</ref>

''Doom'' was released as [[shareware]], with people encouraged to distribute it further. Although most users did not purchase the registered version, over one million copies have been sold, and the popularity helped the sales of later games in the ''Doom'' series that were not released as shareware. In 1995, ''The Ultimate Doom'' (version 1.9, including Episode IV) was released, making this the first time that ''Doom'' was sold commercially in stores.

In a press release dated January 1, 1993, id Software had written that they expected ''Doom'' to be "the number one cause of decreased productivity in businesses around the world."<ref>"Pac-Man, Tetris – and Now It's Doom's Day", ''Washington Post'', October 10th, 1994</ref> This prediction came true at least in part: ''Doom'' became a major problem at workplaces, both occupying the time of employees and clogging [[computer network]]s with traffic caused by deathmatches. [[Intel]], [[Lotus Development]] and [[Carnegie Mellon University]] are among many organizations reported to form policies specifically disallowing ''Doom''-playing during work hours. At the [[Microsoft]] campus, ''Doom'' was by one account equal to a "religious phenomenon".<ref name="mastersofdoom" />

In late 1995, ''Doom'' was estimated to be installed on more computers worldwide than Microsoft's new operating system [[Windows 95]], despite million-dollar advertising campaigns for the latter.<ref name=windows-95>{{cite news|url=http://www.extremetech.com/gaming/167253-gabe-newell-made-windows-a-viable-gaming-platform-and-linux-is-next?origref=|title=Gabe Newell Made Windows a Viable Gaming Platform, and Linux Is Next|author=Sebastian Anthony|publisher=''[[ExtremeTech]]''|date=24 September 2013|accessdate=11 August 2015}}</ref> The game's popularity prompted [[Bill Gates]] to consider buying id Software briefly<ref name="mastersofdoom" /> and led for Microsoft to develop a Windows 95 port of ''Doom'', their team led by a then-employee [[Gabe Newell]],<ref name=windows-95/> to promote the operating system as a gaming platform.

===Expansions and ports===
{{main|Official versions of Doom}}

The popularity of ''Doom'' led to the development of expansion packs and alternate versions based on the same game engine, including ''The Ultimate Doom'' (1995), ''[[Final Doom]]'' (1996), and ''[[Doom 64]]'' (1997). ''Doom'' became a [[killer application|"killer app"]] that all capable [[game console|console]]s and [[operating system]]s were expected to have, and versions of ''Doom'' have subsequently been released for the following systems: [[DOS]], [[OS/2]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]], [[Amiga]], [[Apple Macintosh]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]], [[Sega 32X]], [[Sony PlayStation]], [[Game Boy Advance]], [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]], [[Symbian OS]], [[RISC OS]], [[Atari Jaguar]], [[Sega Saturn]], [[Tapwave Zodiac]], [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], and [[Xbox Live Arcade]]. Some of these were bestsellers even many years after initial release.<ref>Gallup UK Playstation sales chart, April 1996, published in [[Official UK PlayStation Magazine]] issue 5</ref> In 2013, a version of ''Doom'' was ported to the [[Commodore VIC-20]], a vintage 1980 introductory home computer having only 3,583 bytes of BASIC RAM, an 8 bit 6502A processor with rudimentary graphics, no sprites and just 8 colors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commodorecomputerclub.com/video-doom-for-the-commodore-vic-20/|title=Video: Doom for the Commodore VIC-20}}</ref>

===WADs===
{{Main|Doom WAD}}
The ability for others to create custom levels and otherwise modify the game, in the form of custom [[WAD file]]s (short for "Where's All the Data?"),<ref>{{cite web |title=Doom Bible Appendices |url=http://5years.doomworld.com/doombible/appendices.shtml |accessdate=April 20, 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131029193812/http://5years.doomworld.com/doombible/appendices.shtml|archivedate=2013-10-29}}</ref> turned out to be a particularly popular aspect of ''Doom''. Gaining the first large [[mod (computer gaming)|mod]]-making community, ''Doom'' affected the culture surrounding first-person shooters, and also the industry. Several future professional [[game designer]]s started their careers making ''Doom'' WADs as a hobby, among them [[Tim Willits]], who later became the lead designer at id Software.

The first [[level editor]]s appeared in early 1994, and additional tools have been created that allow most aspects of the game to be edited. Although the majority of WADs contain one or several custom levels mostly in the style of the original game, others implement new monsters and other resources, and heavily alter the gameplay; several popular movies, television series, other video games and other brands from popular culture have been turned into ''Doom'' WADs by fans, including ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[The X-Files]]'', ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'',''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Sailor Moon]]'', ''[[Dragon Ball|Dragon Ball Z]]'', ''[[Red Faction]]'', ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'', ''[[Pokémon]]'', ''[[Beavis and Butthead]]'', ''[[Batman]]'' and ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Sonic Retro |title=Sonic Doom II – Bots on Mobious |year=2013 |url=http://www.sonicretro.org/2013/06/fan-game-frenzy-sonic-doom-ii-bots-on-mobius/ |accessdate=June 5, 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131012043444/http://www.sonicretro.org/2013/06/fan-game-frenzy-sonic-doom-ii-bots-on-mobius/ |archivedate=2013-10-12 }}</ref> Some works, like the ''Theme Doom Patch'', combined enemies from several films, such as ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' and ''[[The Terminator]]''. Some add-on files were also made that changed the sounds made by the various characters and weapons.

Around 1994 and 1995, WADs were primarily distributed online over [[bulletin board system]]s or sold in collections on [[compact disc]]s in computer shops, sometimes bundled with editing guide books. [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] servers became the primary method in later years. A few WADs have been released commercially, including the ''[[Master Levels for Doom II]]'', which was released in 1995 along with ''Maximum Doom'', a CD containing 1,830 WADs that had been downloaded from the Internet. Several thousand WADs have been created in total: the ''idgames'' FTP archive contains over 18,000 files,<ref>{{cite web |author=Doomworld |title=/idgames database |url=http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/ |accessdate=September 3, 2005|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140528180311/http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/ |archivedate=2014-05-28 }}</ref> and this represents only a fraction of the complete output of ''Doom'' fans. Third party programs were also written to handle the loading of various WADs, since the game is a [[DOS]] game and all commands had to be entered on the [[command line]] to run. A typical launcher would allow the player to select which files to load from a menu, making it much easier to start. In 1995, [[WizardWorks Software]] released the ''D!Zone'' pack featuring hundreds of levels for ''Doom'' and ''Doom II''.<ref name="Dragon217"/> ''D!Zone'' was reviewed in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' by Jay & Dee; Jay gave the pack 1 out of 5 stars, while Dee gave the pack 1½ stars.<ref name="Dragon217">{{cite journal|title=Eye of the Monitor|author=Jay & Dee |journal=Dragon|issue=217|date=May 1995|pages=65–74}}</ref>

''Doom'' was widely praised in the gaming press and is broadly considered to be one of the most important and influential titles in gaming history. Upon release, ''[[GamesMaster]]'' gave it a 90% rating.<ref name="GR"/> ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' gave it five stars, praising the improvements over ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', the "fast-moving [[Arcade game|arcade]] [[shoot 'em up]]" gameplay, and network play.<ref name="Dragon"/> ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' gave it a 7/10 rating, criticizing the "fairly simple 3D perspective [[List of maze video games|maze]] adventure/shoot 'em up" gameplay but praising the graphics and levels.<ref name="Edge"/>

A common criticism of ''Doom'' was that it was not a true 3D game, since the game engine did not allow corridors and rooms to be stacked on top of one another, and instead relied on graphical trickery to make it appear that the player character and enemies were moving along differing [[elevation]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=The First Pictures|journal=Maximum: The Video Game Magazine|issue=1|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=October 1995|pages=134–5|quote=Doom was criticised for not being a true 3D product – in fact, it's best described as 2.5D (if you will) because although each level could be staged at various heights, it was impossible to stack two corridors on top of one another in any given stage.}}</ref>

The game was [[Official versions of Doom#Consoles|ported to numerous console gaming platforms]] both domestically and abroad where it maintained its popularity, receiving generally favorable critical reception.

===Controversies===
[[File:Doom gibs.png|thumb|''Doom''{{'s}} high level of graphic violence made the game highly controversial. In the screenshot, effects of a rocket hitting a group of enemies]]

''Doom'' was notorious for its high levels of [[graphic violence]]<ref>{{cite web |author=Entertainment Software Rating Board |title=Game ratings |url=http://www.esrb.org/search_results.asp?key=doom&x=0&y=0&type=game |accessdate=December 4, 2004|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060216031317/www.esrb.org:80/search_results.asp?key=doom&x=0&y=0&type=game |archivedate=2006-02-16 }}</ref> and [[Satanism|satanic]] imagery (despite the fact that players assume their role models as the "[[Doomguy]]" hero), which generated controversy from a broad range of groups.

The game again sparked controversy throughout a period of [[school shooting]]s in the United States when it was found that [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]], who committed the [[Columbine High School massacre]] in 1999, were avid players of the game. While planning for the massacre, Harris said that the killing would be "like playing ''Doom''", and "it'll be like the [[1992 Los Angeles riots|LA riots]], the [[Oklahoma City bombing|Oklahoma bombing]], [[World War II|WWII]], [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], ''[[Duke Nukem 3D|Duke Nukem]]'' and ''Doom'' all mixed together", and that his shotgun was "straight out of the game".<ref>{{cite web |author=4–20: a Columbine site |title=Basement Tapes: quotes and transcripts from Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold's video tapes |url=http://columbine.free2host.net/quotes.html |accessdate=November 15, 2005 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060223025846/columbine.free2host.net/quotes.html |archivedate=February 23, 2006}}</ref> A rumor spread afterwards that Harris had designed a ''Doom'' level that looked like the high school, populated with representations of Harris's classmates and teachers, and that Harris practiced for his role in the shootings by playing the level over and over. Although Harris did design ''Doom'' levels, none of them were based on [[Columbine High School]].
While ''Doom'' and other violent video games have been blamed for nationally covered school shootings, 2008 research featured by [[Greater Good Science Center]]<ref>[http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/greatergood/2008spring/Smith744.html Playing the Blame Game] article from [[Greater Good Science Center#Print and online publications|Greater Good magazine]] {{Wayback|url=http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/greatergood/2008spring/Smith744.html|date =20131203054843}}</ref> shows that the two are not closely related. [[Harvard medical school]] researchers Cheryl Olson and Lawrence Kutner found that violent video games did not correlate to school shootings. The [[U.S. Secret Service]] and [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] analyzed 37 incidents of school violence and sought to develop a profile of school shooters, they discovered that the most common traits among shooters were that they were male and had histories of depression and attempted suicide. While many of the killers—like the vast majority of young teenage boys—did play video games, this study did not find a relationship between game play and school shootings. In fact, only one eighth of the shooters showed any special interest in violent video games; far less than the number of shooters who seemed attracted to books and movies with violent content.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secretservice.gov/ntac/ssi_final_report.pdf |title=The Final Report and Findings of the Safe School Initiative |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-11-29|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130215200047/www.secretservice.gov/ntac/ssi_final_report.pdf|archivedate=2013-02-15}}</ref>

===Excess web usage===
When ''Doom'' came out, complaints soon started from internet node managers about excess load on their servers caused by ''Doom'' inter-player communication packages, and to some server managers' [[antivirus software]] was added an "Antidoom" package that blocked ''Doom''-related packages and sent a ''Doom'' "end this game" code to any ''Doom'' players detected.

==Legacy==

===''Doom'' franchise===
{{main|Doom (series)}}

''Doom'' has appeared in several forms in addition to video games, including a [[Doom comic book|''Doom'' comic book]], four novels by [[Dafydd Ab Hugh]] and [[Brad Linaweaver]] (loosely based on events and locations in the games), a [[Doom: The Boardgame|''Doom'' board game]] and [[Doom (film)|a live-action film]] starring [[Karl Urban]] and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] released in 2005. The game's development and impact on popular culture is also the subject of the book ''[[Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture|Masters of Doom]]'' by [[David Kushner]].

The ''Doom'' series remained dormant between 1997 and 2000, when ''[[Doom 3]]'' was announced. A retelling of the original ''Doom'' using entirely new graphics technology, ''Doom 3'' was hyped to provide as large a leap in realism and interactivity as the original game and helped renew interest in the franchise when it was released in 2004. After the ''[[Doom (2016 video game)|Doom 4]]'' project development was scrapped in 2013, id's Tim Willits said that the next game in the ''Doom'' series was still the team's focus, but it has not been confirmed to be titled ''Doom 4''.<ref name="mtv">{{cite web|url=http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2013/08/05/id-software-and-bethesdas-cancelled-doom-4-just-wasnt-doom-enough |title=id Software and Bethesda's Cancelled 'Doom 4' Just Wasn't 'Doom' Enough |publisher=Multiplayerblog.mtv.com |date=2013-08-05 |accessdate=2013-11-29|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131104102655/http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2013/08/05/id-software-and-bethesdas-cancelled-doom-4-just-wasnt-doom-enough |archivedate=2013-11-04 }}</ref> It was renamed to simply ''Doom'' in 2014.

===Clones===
{{Main|First-person shooter}}
[[File:Doom clone vs first person shooter.png|thumb|The phrase "[[Doom clone|''Doom'' clone]]" was initially popular to describe the style of gameplay in ''Doom''-like games, but after 1996 was gradually replaced by "[[first-person shooter]]". By 1998 the phrase "first-person shooter" had firmly superseded "''Doom'' clone".]]
''Doom'' was influential and dozens of new first-person shooter titles appeared following ''Doom''{{'s}} release, and they were often referred to as "[[Doom clone|''Doom'' clones]]" rather than "first-person shooters". The term "''Doom'' clone" was used to described the style of gameplay in ''Doom''-like games. While the term was initially popular, it was after 1996 gradually replaced by "[[first-person shooter]]", around 1998 the phrase "first-person shooter" had firmly superseded "''Doom'' clone". Some of these were certainly "[[Clone (computing)|clones]]"—hastily assembled and quickly forgotten—others explored new grounds of the genre and were highly acclaimed. Many of the games closely imitated features in ''Doom'' such as the selection of weapons and cheat codes. ''Doom''{{'s}} principal rivals were [[3D Realms|Apogee]]'s ''[[Rise of the Triad]]'' and [[Looking Glass Studios]]' ''[[System Shock]]''. The popularity of ''[[Star Wars]]''-themed WADs is rumored to have been the factor that prompted [[LucasArts]] to create their first-person shooter ''[[Dark Forces]]''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Turner, Benjamin & Bowen, Kevin |title=Bringin' in the DOOM Clones |url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/december03/doom/clones/index2.shtml |publisher=GameSpy |year=2003 |accessdate=November 15, 2005|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120127062845/http://archive.gamespy.com:80/articles/december03/doom/clones/index2.shtml |archivedate=2012-01-27 }}</ref>

The ''Doom'' game engine was licensed by id Software to several other companies, who released their own games based on the technology, including ''[[Heretic (video game)|Heretic]]'', ''[[Hexen: Beyond Heretic]]'', ''[[Strife (video game)|Strife: Quest for the Sigil]]'', and ''[[Doom WAD#Total conversions|Hacx: Twitch 'n Kill]]''. A ''Doom''-based game called ''[[Chex Quest]]'' was released in 1996 by [[Ralston Foods]] as a promotion to increase cereal sales,<ref>{{cite web|last=House |first=Michael L. |url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14300&tab=overview |title=Chex Quest – Overview |publisher=allgame |date= |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref> and the [[United States Marine Corps]] released ''[[Marine Doom]]''.

When, three years later, [[3D Realms]] released ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]'', a tongue-in-cheek science fiction shooter based on [[Ken Silverman]]'s technologically similar [[Build engine|''Build'' engine]], id Software was nearly finished developing ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', its next-generation game, which mirrored ''Doom''{{'}}s success for much of the remainder of the 1990s and reduced interest in its predecessor.

===Community===
In addition to the thrilling nature of the single-player game, the [[deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]] mode was an important factor in the game's popularity. ''Doom'' was not the first first-person shooter with a deathmatch mode; ''[[Maze War]]'', an FPS released in 1974, was running multiplayer deathmatch over [[ethernet]] on Xerox computers by 1977. The widespread distribution of PC systems and the violence in ''Doom'' made deathmatching particularly attractive. Two-player multiplayer was possible over a phone line by using a [[modem]], or by linking two PCs with a null-modem cable. Because of its widespread distribution, ''Doom'' hence became the game that introduced deathmatching to a large audience and was also the first game to use the term "deathmatch".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2000_3|title=Games of the Millennium|author=Gestalt|publisher=''[[Eurogamer]]''|date=29 December 1999|accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref>

Although the popularity of the ''Doom'' games dropped with the release of more modern first-person shooters, the game still retains a strong fan base that continues to this day by playing competitively and creating WADs, and ''Doom''-related news is still tracked at multiple websites such as [[Doomworld]]. Interest in ''Doom'' was renewed in 1997, when the [[source code]] for the [[Doom engine|''Doom'' engine]] was released (it was also placed under the [[GNU General Public License]] in 1999). Fans then began [[porting]] the game to various operating systems, even to previously unsupported platforms such as the [[Dreamcast]]. As for the PC, over 50 different [[Doom source ports|''Doom'' source ports]] have been developed. New features such as [[OpenGL]] rendering and [[Scripting language|scripting]] allow WADs to alter the gameplay more radically.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Devoted players have spent years creating [[speedrun]]s for ''Doom'', competing for the quickest completion times and sharing knowledge about routes through the levels and how to exploit [[computer bug|bugs]] in the ''Doom'' engine for shortcuts. Achievements include the completion of both ''Doom'' and ''Doom II'' on the difficulty setting "Ultra-Violence" in less than 30&nbsp;minutes each. In addition, a few players have also managed to complete ''Doom II'' in a single run on the difficulty setting "Nightmare!", on which monsters are more aggressive, launch faster projectiles (or, in the case of the Pinky Demon, simply move faster), and respawn roughly 30&nbsp;seconds after they have been killed (level designer John Romero characterized the idea of such a run as "[just having to be] impossible").<ref>{{cite web |author=Hegyi, Adam |title=Player profile for Thomas "Panter" Pilger |year=1992 |url=http://www.doom.com.hr/index.php?page=compet-n_players&player_id=101 |accessdate=November 15, 2005|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131203221826/http://www.doom.com.hr/index.php?page=compet-n_players&player_id=101 |archivedate=2013-12-03 }}</ref> Movies of most of these runs are available from the COMPET-N website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doom.com.hr/compet-n/ |title=C O M P E T – N |publisher=Doom.com.hr |date= |accessdate=2013-11-29|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140519230448/http://www.doom.com.hr/compet-n/|archivedate=2014-05-19}}</ref>

In 2011, a modification for ''Doom'' was released with the intent of replicating the design style of the original game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/?id=16721 |title=Doom the way id did |publisher=Doomworld.com |date=2011-09-26 |accessdate=2013-11-29|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131103091523/http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/?id=16721 |archivedate=2013-11-03 }}</ref>
