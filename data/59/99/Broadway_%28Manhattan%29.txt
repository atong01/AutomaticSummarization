'''Broadway''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|ɔː|d|w|eɪ}} is a road in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York]]. Perhaps best known for the portion that runs through the [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]], it actually runs {{convert|13|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} through Manhattan and {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} through [[the Bronx]], exiting north from the city to run an additional {{convert|18|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} through the municipalities of [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]], [[Hastings-on-Hudson, New York|Hastings-On-Hudson]], [[Dobbs Ferry, New York|Dobbs Ferry]], [[Irvington, New York|Irvington]], and [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]], and terminating north of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].<ref>There are four other streets named "Broadway" in New York City's remaining three boroughs: one each in [[Brooklyn]] ([[Broadway (Brooklyn)|see main article]]) and [[Staten Island]], and two in [[Queens]] (one running from [[Astoria, Queens|Astoria]] to [[Elmhurst, Queens|Elmhurst]], and the other in [[Hamilton Beach, Queens|Hamilton Beach]]). Each borough therefore has a street named "Broadway". See also from [[Forgotten NY]]:

It is the oldest north–south main thoroughfare in New York City, dating to the first [[New Amsterdam]] settlement. The name ''Broadway'' is the English literal translation of the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] name, ''Breede weg''. Broadway is known widely as the heart of the [[Broadway theatre|American theatre industry]].<ref name="1776 NYC Map" />

==History==
[[File:NewYorkCity1860.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Broadway in 1860]]
[[File:Broadway-1885-APL.jpeg|thumb|left|225px|In 1885 the Broadway commercial district was overrun with telephone, telegraph, and electrical lines. This view was north from Cortlandt and [[Maiden Lane (Manhattan)|Maiden Lane]].]]

Broadway was originally the Wickquasgeck Trail, carved into the brush of Manhattan by its [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] inhabitants.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Streets Where History Lives |first=Russell |last=Shorto|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B00E5DD1F3BF93AA35751C0A9629C8B63 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=9 February 2004 |accessdate=4 April 2008 |quote=And what about a marker for the Wickquasgeck Trail, the Indian path that ran the length of the island, which the Dutch made into their main highway and the English renamed Broadway?
}}</ref> This trail originally snaked through swamps and rocks along the length of Manhattan Island.

Upon the arrival of the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]], the trail soon became the main road through the island from ''Nieuw Amsterdam'' at the southern tip. The Dutch explorer and entrepreneur [[David Pietersz. de Vries]] gives the first mention of it in his journal for the year 1642 ("the Wickquasgeck Road over which the Indians passed daily"). The Dutch named the road "''Heerestraat''".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Epic of New York City |author=Ellis, Edward Robb |publisher=Old Town Books |year=1966 |pages=26}}</ref> Although current street signs are simply labeled as "Broadway", in a 1776 map of New York City, Broadway is explicitly labeled "Broadway Street".<ref name="1776 NYC Map">See the map inset.

In the 18th century, Broadway ended at the town commons north of [[Wall Street]], where traffic continued up the [[East Side (Manhattan)|East Side]] of the island via [[Eastern Post Road]] and the [[West Side (Manhattan)|West Side]] via Bloomingdale Road. The western Bloomingdale Road would be widened and paved during the 19th century, and called "Western Boulevard"<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=gpxBAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA130&lpg=PA130&dq=western+boulevard+manhattan&source=bl&ots=L_2jQM1jW3&sig=eCVyOU0yN1w-3yHwyiaaRxBRPcU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=H8P7UvChFuv60gH45oEo&ved=0CFwQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=western%20boulevard%20manhattan&f=false Traffic regulations for the Western Boulevard] General Ordinances of the City of New York</ref> or "The Boulevard" north of the Grand Circle, now called [[Columbus Circle]].

===Traffic flow===
Broadway once was a [[two-way street]] for its entire length. The present status, in which it runs [[one-way traffic|one-way]] southbound south of [[Columbus Circle]] ([[59th Street (Manhattan)|59th Street]]), came about in several stages. On 6 June 1954, [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]] became southbound and [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth Avenue]] became northbound south of Broadway. None of Broadway became one-way, but the increased southbound traffic between Columbus Circle (Eighth Avenue) and [[Times Square]] (Seventh Avenue) caused the city to re-stripe that section of Broadway for four southbound and two northbound lanes.<ref>{{cite news |title=7th and 8th Aves.

In August 2008, two traffic lanes from 42nd to 35th Streets were taken out of service and converted to public plazas. Additionally, bike lanes were added on Broadway from 42nd Street down to Union Square.<ref>{{cite news |title=City to Make Two Broadway Lanes Bikes, Walkers Only for Seven Blocks |first=Pete |last=Donohue |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/07/10/2008-07-10_city_to_make_two_broadway_lanes_bikes_wa.html |newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |location=New York |date=10 July 2008 |accessdate=11 July 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/broadwayblvd.pdf Broadway Boulevard I]</ref>

Since May 2009, the portions of Broadway through Duffy Square, Times Square, and Herald Square have been closed entirely to automobile traffic, except for cross traffic on the Streets and Avenues, as part of a traffic and pedestrianization experiment, with the pavement reserved exclusively for walkers, cyclists, and those lounging in temporary seating placed by the city.  The city decided that the experiment was successful and decided to make the change permanent in February 2010.  Though the anticipated benefits to traffic flow were not as large as hoped, pedestrian injuries dropped dramatically and foot traffic increased in the designated areas; the project was popular with both residents and businesses.<ref>{{cite news |title=New York Traffic Experiment Gets Permanent Run |first=Michael M. |last=Grynbaum |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=11 February 2010 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/12/nyregion/12broadway.html |accessdate=11 July 2010}}</ref> The current portions converted into pedestrian plazas are between West 47th Street and West 42nd Street within Times and Duffy Squares, and between West 35th Street and West 33rd Street in the Herald Square area. Additionally, portions of Broadway in the Madison Square and Union Square have been dramatically narrowed, allowing ample pedestrian plazas to exist along the side of the road.

In May 2013, the [[New York City Department of Transportation|NYCDOT]] decided to redesign Broadway between 35th and 42nd Streets for the second time in five years, owing to poor connections between pedestrian plazas and decreased vehicular traffic. With the new redesign, the bike lane is now on the right side of the street; it was formerly on the left side adjacent to the pedestrian plazas, causing conflicts between pedestrian and bicycle traffic.<ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/2012-10-22-broadway-blvd-35-42.pdf Broadway Boulevard II]</ref>

==Route==
{{For|the concurrency with U.S. 9 north of 178th Street|U.S. Route 9 in New York}}

===Route description===
[[File:Proposed arcade railway broadway NY 1868 crop.jpg|thumb|355px|right|Plan of 1868 for an "arcade railway"]]
Broadway runs the length of Manhattan Island, roughly parallel to the [[North River (Hudson River)|North River]] (the portion of the [[Hudson River]] bordering Manhattan), from [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]] at the south to [[Inwood, Manhattan|Inwood]] at the northern tip of the island. South of [[Columbus Circle]], it is a one-way southbound street. Since 2009, vehicular traffic has been banned at [[Times Square]] between [[47th Street (Manhattan)|47th]] and [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Streets]], and at [[Herald Square]] between 35th and 33rd Streets as part of a pilot program; the right-of-way is intact and reserved for cyclists and pedestrians. From the northern shore of Manhattan, Broadway crosses [[Spuyten Duyvil Creek]] via the [[Broadway Bridge (Manhattan)|Broadway Bridge]] and continues through [[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]] (a discontinuous portion of the borough of Manhattan) and [[the Bronx]] into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|U.S. 9]] continues to be known as Broadway until its junction with [[New York State Route 117|NY 117]].

====Lower Manhattan====

[[File:Upbroadway e.jpg|left|thumb|220px|A view up Broadway from Bowling Green, with the [[Chrysler Building]] visible in the background]]

The section of lower Broadway from its origin at Bowling Green to City Hall Park is the historical location for the city's [[ticker-tape parade]]s, and is sometimes called the "[[#Canyon of Heroes|Canyon of Heroes]]" during such events. West of Broadway, as far as [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]], was the city's fashionable residential area until circa 1825; landfill has more than tripled the area, and the [[Hudson River]] shore now lies far to the west, beyond [[Tribeca]] and [[Battery Park City]].

Broadway marks the boundary between [[Greenwich Village]] to the west and the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] to the east, passing [[Astor Place]]. It is a short walk from there to [[New York University]] near [[Washington Square Park]], which is at the foot of [[Fifth Avenue]]. A bend in front of [[Grace Church (Manhattan)|Grace Church]] allegedly avoids an earlier tavern; from 10th Street it begins its long diagonal course across Manhattan, headed almost due north.

====Midtown Manhattan====

[[File:Bway.jpg|thumb|right|205px|A view of Broadway in 1909]]

Because Broadway preceded the grid that the [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811]] imposed on the island, Broadway crosses [[midtown Manhattan]] diagonally, intersecting with both the east-west streets and north-south avenues. Broadway's intersections with avenues, marked by "[[town square|squares]]" (some merely triangular slivers of open space), have induced some interesting architecture, such as the [[Flatiron Building]].

At [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]], Broadway crosses [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]], merges with 4th Avenue, and continues its diagonal uptown course from the Square's northwest corner; Union Square is the only location wherein the physical section of Broadway is discontinuous in Manhattan (other portions of Broadway in Manhattan are pedestrians-only plazas). At [[Madison Square]], the location of the [[Flatiron Building]], Broadway crosses Fifth Avenue at [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]]. At [[Greeley Square]] (West 33rd Street), Broadway crosses [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]] (Avenue of the Americas), and is discontinuous to vehicles. [[Macy's Herald Square]] department store, one block north of the vehicular discontinuity, is located on the northwest corner of Broadway and West 34th Street and southwest corner of Broadway and West 35th Street; it is one of the largest [[department store]]s in the world.

One famous stretch near [[Times Square]], where Broadway crosses Seventh Avenue in [[midtown Manhattan]], is the home of many [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[theatre (structure)|theatres]], housing an ever-changing array of commercial, large-scale plays, particularly [[musical theater|musicals]]. This area of Manhattan is often called the Theater District or the Great White Way, a nickname originating in the headline "Found on the Great White Way" in the edition of 3 February 1902 of the ''[[New York Evening Telegram]]''. The journalistic nickname was inspired by the millions of lights on theater [[Marquee (sign)|marquees]] and [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]] advertisements that illuminate the area. After becoming the city's de facto [[Red-light district|Red Light District]] in the 1960s and 1970s (as can be seen in the films ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' and ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]''), since the late 1980s Times Square has emerged as a family tourist center, in effect being [[Disneyfication|Disneyfied]] following the company's purchase and renovation of the [[New Amsterdam Theatre]] on 42nd Street in 1993.  Until June 2007, ''[[The New York Times]]'', from which the Square gets its name, was published at offices at 239 West 43rd Street; the paper stopped printing papers there on 15 June 2007.<ref>{{cite news |title=Copy! |first=David W. |last=Dunlap |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/10/weekinreview/10dunlap.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=10 June 2007 |accessdate=10 October 2008 |quote=The sound is muffled by wall-to-wall carpet tiles and fabric-lined cubicles. But it’s still there, embedded in the concrete and steel sinews of the old factory at 229 West 43rd Street, where The New York Times was written and edited yesterday for the last time.}}</ref>

====Upper West Side====

[[File:72Bway.png|left|thumb|225px|X-shaped intersection of Broadway (from lower right to upper left) and Amsterdam Avenue (lower left to upper right), looking north from Sherman Square to West 72nd Street and the thick treetops of Verdi Square]]

At the southwest corner of [[Central Park]], Broadway crosses [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth Avenue]] (called Central Park West north of 59th Street) at [[59th Street (Manhattan)|West 59th Street]] and [[Columbus Circle]]; on the site of the former [[New York Coliseum]] convention center is the new shopping center at the foot of the [[Time Warner Center]], headquarters of [[Time Warner]]. From Columbus Circle northward, Broadway becomes a wide [[boulevard]] to 169th Street; it retains landscaped [[median (road)|center islands]] that separate northbound from southbound traffic.  The medians are a vestige of the central mall of "The Boulevard" that had become the spine of the [[Upper West Side]], and many of these contain public seating.

Broadway intersects with [[Columbus Avenue (Manhattan)|Columbus Avenue]] (known as Ninth Avenue south of [[59th Street (Manhattan)|West 59th Street]]) at West 65th and 66th Streets where the [[Juilliard School]] and [[Lincoln Center]], both well-known performing arts landmarks, as well as the [[Manhattan New York Temple]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] are located.

From West 70th to West 73rd Streets, Broadway intersects with [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|Amsterdam Avenue]] (known as 10th Avenue south of West 59th Street).  The wide intersection of the two thoroughfares has historically been the site of numerous traffic accidents and pedestrian casualties, partly due to the long crosswalks.<ref>{{cite web| title = Safety Fixes Slated for One of Manhattan’s Most Dangerous Intersections | url = http://www.streetsblog.org/2010/09/23/safety-fixes-slated-for-one-of-manhattans-most-dangerous-intersections/ | accessdate = 10 February 2014}}</ref>  Two small triangular plots of land were created at points where Broadway slices through Amsterdam Avenue.  One is a tiny fenced-in patch of shrubbery and plants at West 70th Street called [[Sherman Square]] (although it and the surrounding intersection have also been known collectively as Sherman Square), and the other triangle is a lush tree-filled garden bordering Amsterdam Avenue from just above West 72nd Street to West 73rd Street.  Called [[Verdi Square]] for its monument to Italian composer [[Giuseppe Verdi]], which was erected in 1909, this triangular sliver of public space was designated a Scenic Landmark by the Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1974.  In the 1960s and 1970s, the area surrounding both Verdi Square and Sherman Square was known by local drug users and dealers as "Needle Park",<ref>{{cite news|first=Richard F.|last=Shepard|title=Strolling Up Broadway, The West Side's Spine|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE2D7113CF93BA35757C0A96E948260|newspaper=The New York Times|date=8 April 1988|accessdate=18 April 2008}}</ref> and was featured prominently in the gritty 1971 dramatic film ''[[The Panic in Needle Park]]'', directed by [[Jerry Schatzberg]] and starring [[Al Pacino]] in his second onscreen role.

The original brick and stone shelter leading to the entrance of the [[72nd Street (IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line)|72nd Street]] subway station, one of the [[Early history of the IRT subway|first 28 subway stations]] in Manhattan, remains located on one of the wide islands in the center of Broadway, on the south side of West 72nd Street.  For many years, all traffic on Broadway flowed on either side of this median and its subway entrance, and its uptown lanes went past it along the western edge of triangular Verdi Square.  In 2001 and 2002, renovation of the historic 72nd St. station and the addition of a second subway control house and passenger shelter on an adjacent center median just north of 72nd Street, across from the original building, resulted in the creation of a public plaza with stone pavers and extensive seating, connecting the newer building with Verdi Square, and making it necessary to divert northbound traffic to Amsterdam Avenue for one block.  While Broadway's southbound lanes at this intersection were unaffected by the new construction, its northbound lanes are no longer contiguous at this intersection.  Drivers can either continue along Amsterdam Avenue to head uptown or turn left on West 73rd Street to resume traveling on Broadway.

Several notable apartment buildings are in close proximity to this intersection, including [[The Ansonia]], its ornate architecture dominating the cityscape here. After the Ansonia first opened as a hotel, live seals were kept in indoor fountains inside its lobby.  Later, it was home to the infamous [[Plato's Retreat]] nightclub.<ref>{{cite news|first=Michael|last=deCourcy Hinds|title=A Conversion Plan Roils the Ansonia|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/08/realestate/a-conversion-plan-roils-the-ansonia.html?smid=pl-share|newspaper=The New York Times|date=8 November 1987|accessdate=10 February 2014}}</ref> Immediately north of Verdi Square is the formidable [[Apple Bank for Savings]] building, formerly the Central Savings Bank, which was built in 1926 and designed to resemble the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.<ref>{{cite web|title=Amsterdammin' from West 72nd–110th|url=http://forgotten-ny.com/2010/11/amsterdammin-from-west-72nd-110th/|date=November 2010|accessdate=10 February 2014}}</ref> Broadway is also home to the Beacon Theater at West 74th Street, designated a national landmark in 1979 and still in operation as a concert venue after its establishment in 1929 as a vaudeville and music hall, and "sister" venue to Radio City Music Hall.<ref>{{cite web|title=Beacon Theatre History|url=http://www.beacontheatre.com/about/history.html|accessdate=10 February 2014}}</ref>

At its intersection with West 78th Street, Broadway shifts direction and continues directly uptown and aligned approximately with the Commissioners' grid. Past the bend are the historic  [[the Apthorp|Apthorp]] apartment building, built in 1908, and the [[First Baptist Church in the City of New York]], incorporated in New York in 1762, its current building on Broadway erected in 1891. The road heads north and passes historically important apartment houses such as [[the Belnord]], the [[Astor Court Building]], and the [[Art Nouveau]] [[The Cornwall|Cornwall]].<ref>Horsley, Carter B. [http://www.thecityreview.com/uws/bway/cornwall.html "The Cornwall"] ''City Review''</ref><ref>{{cite AIA4}} p. 351</ref>

At Broadway and 95th Street, one finds [[Symphony Space]], established in 1978 as home to avant-garde and classical music and dance performances in the former Symphony Theatre, which was originally built in 1918 as a premier "music and motion-picture house".<ref>{{cite web | title = Written on the Screen| url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F20B10FD345B11738DDDA80A94DC405B888DF1D3 | date = 21 April 1918 | accessdate=10 February 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = Symphony Space History | url = http://www.symphonyspace.org/history | accessdate=10 February 2014 }}</ref>  At 99th Street, Broadway passes between the controversial skyscrapers of [[the Ariel]] East and West.

At 107th Street, Broadway intersects with [[West End Avenue]] to form [[Straus Park]] with its Titanic Memorial by [[Augustus Lukeman]].

Broadway then passes the campus of [[Columbia University]] at [[116th Street (Manhattan)|116th Street]] in [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Morningside Heights]], in part on the tract that housed the [[Bloomingdale Insane Asylum|Bloomingdale (Lunatic) Asylum]] from 1808 until it moved to [[Westchester County]] in 1894. Still in Morningside Heights, Broadway passes the handsome, park-like campus of [[Barnard College]]. Next, the beautiful Gothic quadrangle of [[Union Theological Seminary (Manhattan)|Union Theological Seminary]] and the brick buildings of the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] with their beautifully landscaped interior courtyards face one another across Broadway. On the next block is the [[Manhattan School of Music]].

Broadway then runs past the proposed uptown campus of Columbia University, and the main campus of [[City College of New York|CUNY—City College]] near 135th Street; the beautiful Gothic buildings of the original City College campus are out of sight, a block to the east. Also to the east are the handsome [[brownstone]]s of Hamilton Heights. Hamilton Place is a surviving section of Bloomingdale Road, and originally the address of [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s house, [[Hamilton Grange National Memorial|The Grange]], which has been moved.<ref>Simmons, Eleanor Booth [http://myinwood.net/where-cobwebs-thrive-on-manhattan-isle/ Where Cobwebs Thrive on Manhattan Isle] ''New York Tribune;'' 6 November 1921</ref>

Broadway achieves a verdant, park-like effect, particularly in the spring, when it runs between the uptown [[Trinity Church Cemetery]] and the former Trinity Chapel, now the [[Church of the Intercession (Manhattan)|Church of the Intercession]] near 155th Street.

[[NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital]] lies on Broadway near 166th, 167th, and 168th Streets in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]]. The intersection with [[Saint Nicholas Avenue (Manhattan)|Saint Nicholas Avenue]] at 167th Street forms [[Mitchell Square Park]]. At 178th Street, [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|U.S. 9]] becomes concurrent with Broadway.

Broadway crosses the [[Harlem River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Manhattan)|Broadway Bridge]] to [[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]]. Afterward, it then enters [[the Bronx]], where it is the eastern border of [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] and the western border of [[Van Cortlandt Park]]. At 253rd Street, [[New York State Route 9A|NY 9A]] joins with U.S. 9 and Broadway. (NY 9A splits off Broadway at Ashburton Avenue in Yonkers.)

====Westchester County====
The northwestern corner of the park marks the city limit and Broadway enters [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]], where it is now known as South Broadway. It trends ever westward, closer to the [[Hudson River]], remaining a busy urban commercial street. In downtown Yonkers, it drops close to the river, becomes North Broadway and 9A leaves via Ashburton Avenue. Broadway climbs to the nearby ridgetop runs parallel to the river and the railroad, a few blocks east of both as it passes [[St. John's Riverside Hospital]]. The neighborhoods become more residential and the road gently undulates along the ridgetop.<ref name="nymap07"/> In Yonkers, Broadway passes historic [[Philipse Manor Hall State Historic Site|Philipse Manor]] house, which dates back to colonial America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nysparks.com/historic-sites/37/details.aspx|title=Philipse Manor Hall State Historic Site|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref>

It remains Broadway as it leaves Yonkers for [[Hastings-on-Hudson, New York|Hastings-on-Hudson]], where it splits into separate north and south routes for {{convert|0.6|mi|km|1}}. The trees become taller and the houses, many separated from the road by stone fences, become larger. Another National Historic Landmark, the [[John William Draper House]], was the site of the first [[astrophotograph]] of the [[Moon]].<ref name="nymap07">{{cite map |title=1977–2007 I Love New York State Map |year=2007 |publisher=[[I Love New York]] |accessdate=13 April 2008}}</ref>

In the next village, [[Dobbs Ferry, New York|Dobbs Ferry]], Broadway has various views of the Hudson River while passing through the residential section. Broadway passes by the [[Old Croton Aqueduct]] and nearby the shopping district of the village. After intersecting with Ashford Avenue, Broadway passes [[Mercy College (New York)|Mercy College]], then turns left again at the center of town just past [[South Presbyterian Church]], headed for equally comfortable [[Ardsley-on-Hudson, New York|Ardsley-on-Hudson]] and [[Irvington, New York|Irvington]]. [[Villa Lewaro]], the home of [[Madam C.J. Walker]], the first African-American millionaire, is along the highway here.<ref name="Villa Lewaro">{{cite web |title=Villa Lewaro |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/pwwmh/ny22.htm |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |work=Places Where Women Made History |date=30 March 1998 |accessdate=31 May 2009}}</ref> At the north end of the village of Irvington, a [[Washington Irving Memorial|memorial]] to writer [[Washington Irving]], after whom the village was renamed, marks the turnoff to his home at [[Sunnyside (Tarrytown, New York)|Sunnyside]]. Entering into the southern portion of Tarrytown, Broadway passes by historic [[Lyndhurst (mansion)|Lydhurst mansion]], a massive mansion built along the Hudson River built in the early 1800s.

North of here, at the [[Kraft Foods]] technical center, the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] becomes visible. After crossing under the [[New York State Thruway|Thruway]] and I-87 again, here concurrent with [[Interstate 287|I-287]], and then intersecting with the four-lane [[New York State Route 119|NY&nbsp;119]], where 119 splits off to the east, Broadway becomes the busy main street of [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]]. [[Christ Episcopal Church (Tarrytown, New York)|Christ Episcopal Church]], where Irving worshiped,<ref name="Christ Episcopal Church NRHP nom">{{cite web |last=Larson |first=Neil |title=National Register of Historic Places nomination, Christ Episcopal Church |url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=10711 |publisher=[[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]] |date=February 1987 |accessdate=11 June 2008}}</ref> is along the street. Many high quality restaurants and shops are along this main road. This downtown ends at the eastern terminus of [[New York State Route 448|NY&nbsp;448]], where Broadway slopes off to the left, downhill, and four signs indicate that Broadway turns left, passing the [[Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow]], another NHL. The road then enters [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] (formerly North Tarrytown), passing the visitors' center for [[Kykuit]], the [[National Historic Landmark]] that was (and partially still is) the [[Rockefeller family]]'s [[Estate (house)|estate]].<ref name="nymap07"/> Broadway then passes the historic [[Sleepy Hollow Cemetery]], which includes the resting place of Washington Irving and the setting for [[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sleepyhollowcemetery.org/|title=The Original Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in New York|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref>

Broadway expands to four lanes at the trumpet intersection with [[New York State Route 117|NY&nbsp;117]], where it finally ends and U.S.&nbsp;9 becomes [[Albany Post Road]] (and Highland Avenue) at the northern border of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]].

===Nicknamed sections===

====Canyon of Heroes====
{{see also|List of ticker-tape parades in New York City}}
[[File:Apollo 11 ticker tape parade 2.jpg|thumb|300px|Canyon of Heroes during a ticker-tape parade for the [[Apollo 11]] [[astronaut]]s on August 13, 1969]]

''Canyon of Heroes'' is occasionally used to refer to the section of lower Broadway in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] that is the location of the city's [[ticker-tape parade]]s.

The traditional route of the parade is northward from [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]] to [[City Hall Park]]. Most of the route is lined with tall office buildings along both sides, affording a view of the parade for thousands of office workers who create the snowstorm-like jettison of shredded paper products that characterize the parade.

While typical sports championship parades have been showered with some 50 tons of confetti and shredded paper, the [[Victory over Japan Day|V-J Day]] parade on August 14–15, 1945 – marking the end of [[World War II]] – was covered with 5,438 tons of paper, based on estimates provided by the [[New York City Department of Sanitation]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Q & A: Today’s Giants Ticker-Tape Parade|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/05/q-a-todays-giants-ticker-tape-parade/ |newspaper=The New York Times |date=5 February 2008 |accessdate=4 August 2008}}</ref>

More than 200 black granite strips embedded in the sidewalks along the Canyon of Heroes list honorees of past ticker-tape parades.<ref>{{cite news |title=Super Bowl-Winning Giants Get Canyon of Heroes Honor |first=Fernanda |last=Santos |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/11/nyregion/11bloomberg.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=11 June 2008 |accessdate=4 August 2008 |quote=The plaque is one of the more than 200 granite strips in a route known as the Canyon of Heroes, marking those who have been honored by the city with ticker-tape parades.}}</ref>

The most recent parade up the Canyon of Heroes took place on July 10, 2015 for the [[United States women's national soccer team]] in honor of their [[2015 FIFA Women's World Cup]] championship.<ref>West, Melanie Grayce and King, Kate.

====Great White Way====

"The Great White Way" is a nickname for a section of Broadway in [[Midtown Manhattan]], specifically the portion that encompasses the [[Theater District, Manhattan|Theater District]], between [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd]] and [[53rd Street (Manhattan)|53rd Streets]], and encompassing [[Times Square]].

In 1880, a stretch of Broadway between [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]] and [[Madison Square]] was illuminated by [[Charles F. Brush|Brush]] [[arc lamp]]s, making it among the first electrically lighted streets in the United States.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, p. 1063</ref> By the 1890s, the portion from [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]] to [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]] was so brightly illuminated by electrical advertising signs, that people began calling it "The Great White Way".<ref>Burrows & Wallace, p. 1066</ref> When the theater district moved uptown, the name was transferred to the Times Square area.

The phrase ''Great White Way'' has been attributed to Shep Friedman, columnist for the ''[[New York Morning Telegraph]]'' in 1901, who lifted the term from the title of a book about the Arctic by [[Albert Paine]].<ref name="bloom">Bloom, Ken. [http://books.google.com/books?id=GBiEO8q59f0C&pg=PA499&dq=%22great+white+way%22+Shep+Friedman&hl=en&ei=TDzQTNneAsKclgf-mOi9Bg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22great%20white%20way%22%20Shep%20Friedman&f=false Broadway: its history, people, and places : an encyclopedia], p.499 (2003) (ISBN 978-0415937047)</ref>  The headline "Found on the Great White Way" appeared in the February 3, 1902, edition of the ''[[New York World-Telegram|New York Evening Telegram]]''.<ref name="bloom"/>

A portrait of Broadway in the early part of the 20th century and "The Great White Way" late at night appeared in "Artist In Manhattan"(1940)<ref>Jerome Myers, Artist in Manhattan, New York: American Artists Group, Inc. 1940.</ref> written by the artist-historian [[Jerome Myers]]:

{{quote|Early morn on Broadway, the same light that tips the mountain tops of the Colorado canyons gradually discloses the quiet anatomy, the bare skeletons of the huge iron signs that trellis the sky, now denuded of the attractions of the volcanic night. Almost lifeless, the tired entertainers of the night clubs and their friends straggle to their rooms, taximen compare notes and earnings, the vast street scene has had its curtain call, the play is over.

Dear old Broadway, for many years have I dwelt on your borders. I have known the quiet note of your dawn. Even earlier I would take my coffee at Martin's, at 54th Street–now, alas, vanished–where I would see creatures of the night life before they disappeared with the dawn.

One night a celebrated female impersonator came to the restaurant in all his regalia, directly from a club across the street. Several taximen began to poke fun at him. Unable any longer to bear their taunts, he got up and knocked all the taximen out cold. Then he went back to the club, only to lament under his bitter tears, "See how they've ruined my dress!"

Gone are the old-time Broadway oyster bars and chop houses that were the survivors of a tradition of their sporting patrons, the bon vivants of Manhattan. Gone are the days when the Hoffman House flourished on Madison Square, with its famous nudes by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau|Bouguereau]]; when barrooms were palaces, on nearly every corner throughout the city; when [[Steve Brodie (bridge jumper)|Steve Brodie]], jumping from [[Brooklyn Bridge]], splashed the entire country with publicity; when [[Bowery]] concert halls dispensed schooners of beer for a nickel, with a stage show thrown in; when Theis's Music Hall still resounded on 14th Street with its great mechanical organ, the wonder of its day, a place of beauty, with fine paintings and free company and the frankest of female life. Across the street was [[Tammany Hall]], and next to it [[Tony Pastor]]'s, where stars of the stage were born. Tony himself, in dress clothes and top hat, sang his ballads, a gallant trouper introducing [[Lillian Russell]] and others to fame through his audience.}}

==Transportation==
From south to north, Broadway at one point or another runs over or under various [[New York City Subway]] lines, including the [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]], the [[BMT Broadway Line]], [[IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line]], and [[IND Eighth Avenue Line]] (the [[IND Sixth Avenue Line]] is the only north-south trunk line in Manhattan that does not run along Broadway).
* The IRT Lexington Avenue Line runs under Broadway from [[Bowling Green (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Bowling Green]] to [[Fulton Street (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Fulton Street]] ({{NYCS trains|Lexington south}}).
* The BMT Broadway Line runs under it from [[City Hall (BMT Broadway Line)|City Hall]] to [[Times Square – 42nd Street (BMT Broadway Line)|Times Square – 42nd Street]] ({{NYCS trains|Broadway}}).
* The IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line runs under and over Broadway from [[Times Square – 42nd Street (IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line)|Times Square]] to [[168th Street (IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line)|168th Street]] ({{NYCS trains|Broadway-Seventh}}), and again from 218th Street to its terminal in [[the Bronx]] at [[Van Cortlandt Park – 242nd Street (IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line)|Van Cortlandt Park – 242nd Street]] ({{NYCS trains|Broadway-Seventh north local}}).
* The northern portion of the IND Eighth Avenue Line runs under Broadway from [[Dyckman Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|Dyckman Street]] to [[Inwood – 207th Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|Inwood – 207th Street]] ({{NYCS trains|Eighth far north}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/nyct/maps/subwaymap.pdf|title=NYC Subway Map|publisher=MTA|accessdate=6 June 2014}}</ref>

[[File:Broadway under 1 subway.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Broadway under the [[IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line]]'s elevated structure]]

Early [[street railway]]s on Broadway included the Broadway and Seventh Avenue Railroad's Broadway and University Place Line (1864?) between [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]] ([[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]]) and [[Times Square]] ([[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]]), the Ninth Avenue Railroad's [[Ninth and Amsterdam Avenues Line]] (1884) between 65th Street and 71st Street, the Forty-second Street, Manhattanville and St. Nicholas Avenue Railway's [[Broadway Branch Line]] (1885?) between Times Square and [[125th Street (Manhattan)|125th Street]], and the Kingsbridge Railway's Kingsbridge Line<!--when?--> north of 169th Street. The Broadway Surface Railroad's [[Broadway Line (Lower Manhattan surface)|Broadway Line]], a [[cable car (railway)|cable car]] line, opened on lower Broadway (below Times Square) in 1893, and soon became the core of the [[Metropolitan Street Railway]], with two cable branches: the [[Broadway and Lexington Avenue Line]] and [[Broadway and Columbus Avenue Line]].

These streetcar lines were replaced with [[bus route]]s in the 1930s and 1940s. Before Broadway became one-way, the main bus routes along it were the [[New York City Omnibus Company]]'s (NYCO) [[6 (NYCO)|6]] (Broadway below Times Square), [[7 (NYCO)|7]] (Broadway and Columbus Avenue), and [[11 (NYCO)|11]] (Ninth and Amsterdam Avenues), and the [[Surface Transportation Corporation]]'s [[M100 (New York City bus)|M100]] (Kingsbridge) and [[M104 (New York City bus)|M104]] (Broadway Branch). Additionally, the [[Fifth Avenue Coach Company]]'s (FACCo) [[4 (FACCo)|4]] and 5 used Broadway from [[135th Street (Manhattan)|135th Street]] north to Washington Heights, and their 5 and 6 used Broadway between [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th Street]] and [[72nd Street (Manhattan)|72nd Street]]. With the implementation of one-way traffic, the northbound 6 and 7 were moved to [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]].

{{As of|2014}}, Broadway is now served by the [[M4 (New York City bus)|M4]] (ex-FACCo 4), [[M5 (New York City bus)|M5]] (ex-FACCo 5), [[M7 (New York City bus)|M7]] (ex-NYCO 7), [[M100 (New York City bus)|M100]], and [[M104 (New York City bus)|M104]]. Other routes that use part of Broadway include the [[M10 (New York City bus)|M10]], [[M20 (New York City bus)|M20]], [[M60 (New York City bus)|M60]] [[Select Bus Service#M60 route|Select Bus Service]], [[Bx7 (New York City bus)|Bx7]], [[Bx9 (New York City bus)|Bx9]], and [[Bx20 (New York City bus)|Bx20]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/nyct/maps/manbus.pdf|title=Manhattan Bus Map|publisher=MTA|accessdate=6 June 2014}}</ref>

[[Bee-Line Bus System|Bee-Line]] buses also serves Broadway within [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] and Westchester County. Routes [[List of bus routes in Westchester County|1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 13]], and several others run on a portion of Broadway.
