Along with his Academy Award, Hopkins has also won three [[BAFTA Award]]s, two [[Emmy Award|Emmys]] and the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award|Cecil B. DeMille Award]].

==Early life==
Hopkins was born on 31 December 1937 in [[Margam]], [[Port Talbot]], [[Wales]], the son of Annie Muriel (née Yeates) and Richard Arthur Hopkins, a baker.<ref name="actors">Stated in interview on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', 2007.</ref> His schooldays were unproductive; he found that he would rather immerse himself in art, such as painting and drawing, or playing the piano, than attend to his studies. In 1949, to instill discipline, his parents insisted he attend [[West Monmouth School|Jones' West Monmouth Boys' School]] in Pontypool, Wales. He remained there for five terms and was then educated at [[Cowbridge Grammar School]] in the [[Vale of Glamorgan]], Wales.<ref name="cowbridge">[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1252033/Anthony-Hopkins.html Anthony Hopkins: My life in pictures] ''[[Daily Mail]]''. Retrieved 6 January 2011.</ref>

Hopkins was influenced and encouraged by Welsh compatriot [[Richard Burton]] (also born in Port Talbot), whom he met briefly at the age of 15. Hopkins promptly enrolled at the [[Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama]] in [[Cardiff]], Wales, from which he graduated in 1957.<ref name="telegraph"/> After two years in the British Army doing his [[national service]], he moved to London, where he trained at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]].<ref name="RADA">[http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/1998/dec/05/features A dark and stormy knight] ''[[The Guardian]]''.

==Career==

===Roles===
Hopkins made his first professional stage appearance in the [[Palace Theatre, Swansea]], in 1960 with Swansea Little Theatre's production of ''Have a Cigarette''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sir Anthony Hopkins Biography|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/anthony-hopkins.html|publisher=[[Bio.

In 1965, after several years in repertory, he was spotted by [[Laurence Olivier]], who invited him to join the [[Royal National Theatre]] in London.<ref name="telegraph">[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/nationaltreasures/2193352/Sir-Anthony-Hopkins-portrait.html Sir Anthony Hopkins portrait] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. Retrieved 6 January 2011.</ref> Hopkins became Olivier's [[understudy]], and filled in when Olivier was struck with [[appendicitis]] during a production of [[August Strindberg]]'s ''The Dance of Death''. Olivier later noted in his memoir, ''Confessions of an Actor'', that "A new young actor in the company of exceptional promise named Anthony Hopkins was understudying me and walked away with the part of Edgar like a cat with a mouse between its teeth."<ref name="falk">{{cite book|first=Quentin|last=Falk|year=2004|title=Anthony Hopkins: The Biography|edition=4th|publisher=Virgin Books|isbn=0-7535-0999-7}}</ref>

Despite his success at the National, Hopkins tired of repeating the same roles nightly and yearned to be in films. He made his small-screen debut in a 1967 BBC broadcast of ''[[A Flea in Her Ear]]''. In 1968, he got his break in ''[[The Lion in Winter (1968 film)|The Lion in Winter]]'' playing [[Richard I of England|Richard I]]. Although Hopkins continued in theatre (most notably at the National Theatre as Lambert Le Roux in ''[[Pravda (play)|Pravda]]'' by [[David Hare (playwright)|David Hare]] and [[Howard Brenton]] and as Antony in ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' opposite [[Judi Dench]] as well as in the Broadway production of [[Peter Shaffer]]'s ''[[Equus (play)|Equus]]'') he gradually moved away from it to become more established as a television and film actor. He portrayed [[Charles Dickens]] in the BBC television film ''[[The Great Inimitable Mr. Dickens]]'' in 1970, and [[Pierre Bezukhov]] in the BBC's mini series ''[[War and Peace (1972 TV series)|War and Peace]]'' (1972).<ref>[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/1204295/ BFI Screenonline: Sherrin, Ned (1931-2007) Biography].

Set in 1950s post-war Britain, Hopkins starred opposite [[Emma Thompson]] in the critically acclaimed ''[[The Remains of the Day]]'' (1993). Hopkins was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his performance, and the film frequently ranks among the best British films of all time.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturepicturegalleries/9848319/The-49-best-British-films-of-all-time.html "The 49 best British films of all time"].

===Acting style===
[[File:I Rossellini A Hopkins.jpg|right|thumb|[[Isabella Rossellini]] and Sir Anthony Hopkins in Berlin to shoot scenes for ''[[The Innocent (1993 film)|The Innocent]]'' (1993)]]

Hopkins is renowned for his preparation for roles. He has indicated in interviews that once he has committed to a project, he will go over his lines as many times as is needed (sometimes upwards of 200) until the lines sound natural to him, so that he can "do it without thinking". This leads to an almost casual style of delivery that belies the amount of groundwork done beforehand. While it can allow for some careful improvisation, it has also brought him into conflict with the occasional director who departs from the script, or demands what the actor views as an excessive number of takes. Hopkins has stated that after he is finished with a scene, he simply discards the lines, not remembering them later on. This is unlike others who usually remember their lines from a film even years later.<ref>"Anthony Hopkins: Lecter and Me"&nbsp;— ''Red Dragon'' DVD interview</ref> [[Richard Attenborough]], who directed Hopkins on five occasions, found himself going to great lengths during the filming of ''[[Shadowlands (1993 film)|Shadowlands]]'' (1993) to accommodate the differing approaches of his two stars (Hopkins and [[Debra Winger]]), who shared many scenes. Whereas Hopkins, preferring the spontaneity of a fresh take, liked to keep rehearsals to a minimum, Winger rehearsed continuously. To allow for this, Attenborough stood in for Hopkins during Winger's rehearsals, only bringing him in for the last one before a take. The director praised Hopkins for "this extraordinary ability to make you believe when you hear him that it is the very first time he has ever said that line. It's an incredible gift."<ref name="falk" />

Renowned for his ability to remember lines, Hopkins keeps his memory supple by learning things by heart such as poetry, and Shakespeare. In Steven Spielberg's ''[[Amistad (film)|Amistad]]'', Hopkins astounded the crew with his memorisation of a seven-page courtroom speech, delivering it in one go. An overawed Spielberg couldn't bring himself to call him Tony, and insisted on addressing him as Sir Anthony throughout the shoot.<ref name="RADA" />

Hopkins is a gifted [[Impressionist (entertainment)|mimic]], adept at turning his native Welsh accent into whatever is required by a character. He duplicated the voice of his late mentor, Laurence Olivier, for additional scenes in ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' in its 1991 restoration. His interview on the 1998 relaunch edition of the British TV talk show ''[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]]'' featured an [[impersonation]] of comedian [[Tommy Cooper]]. Hopkins has said acting "like a submarine" has helped him to deliver credible performances in his thriller movies. He said, "It's very difficult for an actor to avoid, you want to show a bit. But I think the less one shows the better."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8512396.stm |title=Sir Anthony Hopkins acts 'like a submarine' |publisher=BBC News  |date=12 February 2010 |accessdate=7 March 2010 | location=London}}</ref>

===Hannibal Lecter===
Perhaps Hopkins' most famous role is as the cannibalistic serial killer [[Hannibal Lecter]] in ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', for which he won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] in 1991, opposite [[Jodie Foster]] as [[Clarice Starling]], who also won for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. The film won [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]]. Hopkins reprised his role as Lecter twice in ''[[Hannibal (film)|Hannibal]]'' (2001) and ''[[Red Dragon (film)|Red Dragon]]'' (2002). His original portrayal of the character in ''The Silence of the Lambs'' has been labelled by the [[American Film Institute]] as the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains|number-one film villain]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/handv.aspx| publisher=AFI.com | title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains| accessdate=21 May 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070507035737/http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/handv.aspx <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 7 May 2007}}</ref> At the time he was offered the role, Hopkins was making a return to the London stage, performing in ''[[M. Butterfly]]''. He had come back to Britain after living for a number of years in Hollywood, having all but given up on a career there, saying, "Well that part of my life's over; it's a chapter closed. I suppose I'll just have to settle for being a respectable actor poncing around the West End and doing respectable BBC work for the rest of my life."<ref name="falk" />

Hopkins played the iconic villain in adaptations of the first three of the Lecter novels by [[Thomas Harris]]. The author was reportedly very pleased with Hopkins' portrayal of his antagonist. However, Hopkins stated that ''[[Red Dragon (film)|Red Dragon]]'' would feature his final performance as the character, and that he would not reprise even a narrative role in the latest addition to the series, ''[[Hannibal Rising (film)|Hannibal Rising]]''.
