He has indicated in interviews that once he has committed to a project, he will go over his lines as many times as is needed (sometimes upwards of 200) until the lines sound natural to him, so that he can &quot;do it without thinking&quot;. This leads to an almost casual style of delivery that belies the amount of groundwork done beforehand. While it can allow for some careful improvisation, it has also brought him into conflict with the occasional director who departs from the script, or demands what the actor views as an excessive number of takes. Hopkins has stated that after he is finished with a scene, he simply discards the lines, not remembering them later on. This is unlike others who usually remember their lines from a film even years later.<extension extension_name='ref'>&quot;Anthony Hopkins: Lecter and Me&quot;&amp;nbsp;<space/><italics>Red Dragon</italics><space/>DVD interview</extension><space/><link><target>Richard Attenborough</target></link>, who directed Hopkins on five occasions, found himself going to great lengths during the filming of<space/><italics><link><target>Shadowlands (1993 film)</target><part>Shadowlands</part></link></italics><space/>(1993) to accommodate the differing approaches of his two stars (Hopkins and<space/><link><target>Debra Winger</target></link>), who shared many scenes. Whereas Hopkins, preferring the spontaneity of a fresh take, liked to keep rehearsals to a minimum, Winger rehearsed continuously. To allow for this, Attenborough stood in for Hopkins during Winger's rehearsals, only bringing him in for the last one before a take. The director praised Hopkins for &quot;this extraordinary ability to make you believe when you hear him that it is the very first time he has ever said that line. It's an incredible gift.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="falk"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Renowned for his ability to remember lines, Hopkins keeps his memory supple by learning things by heart such as poetry, and Shakespeare.
