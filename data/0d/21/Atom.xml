The word &quot;atom&quot;, in fact, was coined by ancient Greek philosophers. However, these ideas were founded in philosophical and theological reasoning rather than evidence and experimentation. As a result, their views on what atoms look like and how they behave were incorrect. They also could not convince everybody, so atomism was but one of a number of competing theories on the nature of matter. It was not until the 19th century that the idea was embraced and refined by scientists, when the blossoming science of chemistry produced discoveries that only the concept of atoms could explain.</paragraph><heading level='3'>First evidence-based theory</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Daltons symbols.gif</target><part>right</part><part>thumb</part><part>Various atoms and molecules as depicted in<space/><link><target>John Dalton</target></link>'s ''A New System of Chemical Philosophy'' (1808).</part></link>In the early 1800s,<space/><link><target>John Dalton</target></link><space/>used the concept of atoms to explain why<space/><link><target>Chemical element</target><part>elements</part></link><space/>always react in ratios of small whole numbers (the<space/><link><target>law of multiple proportions</target></link>). For instance, there are two types of<space/><link><target>tin oxide (disambiguation)</target><part>tin oxide</part></link>: one is 88.1% tin and 11.9% oxygen and the other is 78.7% tin and 21.3% oxygen (<link><target>tin(II) oxide</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>tin dioxide</target></link><space/>respectively). This means that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5g or 27g of oxygen. 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1:2, a ratio of small whole numbers. This common pattern in chemistry suggested to Dalton that elements react in whole number multiples of discrete unitsin other words, atoms. In the case of tin oxides, one tin atom will combine with either one or two oxygen atoms.<extension extension_name='ref' name="From AtomosToAtom"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="author">Andrew G. van Melsen<space/></arg><arg name="year">1952<space/></arg><arg name="title">From Atomos to Atom<space/></arg><arg name="isbn"><space/>0-486-49584-1<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Dover Publications<space/></arg><arg name="location">Mineola, N.Y.</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Dalton also believed atomic theory could explain why water absorbs different gases in different proportions.
