These higher speeds better serve the longer distances involved. Some services include express services which skip some stations in order to run faster and separate longer distance riders from short-distance ones.</paragraph><paragraph>The general range of commuter trains' distance varies between 15 and 200&amp;nbsp;km (10 and 125 miles). Sometimes long distances can be explained by that the train runs between two or several cities (e.g. S-Bahn in the<space/><link><target>Ruhr</target></link><space/>area of Germany). Distances between stations may vary, but are usually much longer than those of urban rail systems. In city centers the train either has a terminal station or passes through the city centre with notably fewer station stops than those of urban rail systems.

They can be divided into two major types. In<space/><link><target>Berlin</target></link>, the<space/><link><target>Berlin S-Bahn</target><part>S-Bahn systems</part></link><space/>do fulfill all considerations of a true metro system (despite the existence of<space/><link><target>U-Bahn</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>as well) the trains run on tracks that are entirely separated from other trains, they have most of their stations within highly populated urban areas, has short distances between stations, has high frequency departures (all day) at fixed minutes and uses tunnels. The main difference between the S-Bahn systems of Berlin compared to the U-Bahns of the same cities are most notable at major railroad stations, where their (track-separated) platforms are located parallel to common railroad platforms. Some S-Bahn lines do run a bit further out from the city centre, compared with U-Bahn.<space/></paragraph><paragraph>This type of S-train also exists in<space/><link><target>Copenhagen</target></link><space/>(where a<space/><link><target>Copenhagen Metro</target><part>metro system</part></link><space/>also exists) and in<space/><link><target>Vienna</target></link><space/>(where the S-Bahn and U-Bahn constitute a common system). In Hamburg and Copenhagen, other, diesel driven trains, do continue where the S-Bahn ends (&quot;<link><target>AKN Eisenbahn</target><part>A-Bahn</part></link>&quot; in Hamburg area, and &quot;L-tog&quot; in Copenhagen). In both Berlin and Copenhagen a ring line (circle line) is run by S-trains through highly populated boroughs, but outside the city centre core. (In Copenhagen the circle isn't complete, due to the city's location by the sea.)</paragraph><paragraph>The second type, found in the Ruhr area, has longer lines and lacks a separate track system, and the trains runs between cities rather than within a city, although cities like<space/><link><target>Dortmund</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Essen</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Gelsenkirchen</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Dsseldorf</target></link><space/>are almost<space/><link><target>Urban agglomeration</target><part>agglomerated</part></link><space/>together. This type of S-Bahn also applies to Munich and Frankfurt. S-Bahns does also exist in some mid-size cities like Rostock and Magdeburg, but in that case the S-trains do not depart as often as metro systems do, the tracks are not separated from other trains and the number of lines are few. The distances between stations however are usually short.</paragraph><paragraph>S-trains (S-Bahns) are a rather wide concept but only in a number of cases can they be truly considered as commuter rail. The consideration for this is open to subjective thoughts and different opinions however, especially since such S-trains only exists in a few countries (Germany, Austria, Denmark, Italy and Romania) and do differ from city to city even within these countries.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Regional rail</heading><paragraph><link><target>Regional rail</target></link><space/>usually provides<space/><link><target>rail transport</target><part>rail services</part></link><space/>between towns and cities, rather than purely linking major population hubs in the way<space/><link><target>inter-city rail</target></link><space/>does. Regional rail operates outside major cities. Unlike Inter-city, it stops at most or all stations between cities. It provides a service between smaller communities along the line, and also connections with long-distance services at interchange stations located at junctions or at larger towns along the line. Alternative names are &quot;local train&quot; or &quot;stopping train&quot;.

For example, so-called &quot;<link><target>Inter-city rail</target><part>intercity</part></link>&quot; trains in<space/><link><target>Belgium</target></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>Netherlands</target></link><space/>carry many commuters and their equipment, range and speeds are similar to those of commuter trains in some larger countries. In the<space/><link><target>United Kingdom</target></link><space/>there is no real division of organisation and brand name between commuter, regional and inter-city trains, making it hard to categorize train connections.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Elektrichka</target><part>Russian commuter trains</part></link>, on the other hand, frequently cover areas larger than Belgium itself, although these are still short distances by Russian standards. They have a different ticketing system from long-distance trains, and in major cities they often operate from a separate section of the train station.</paragraph><paragraph>The easiest way to identify these &quot;inter-city&quot; services is that they tend to operate as express services - only linking the main stations in the cities they link, not stopping at any other stations. However, this term is used in Australia (Sydney for example) to describe the regional trains operating beyond the boundaries of the suburban services, even though some of these &quot;inter-city&quot; services stop all stations similar to German regional services. In this regard, the German service delineations and corresponding naming conventions are clearer and better used for academic purposes.</paragraph><heading level='4'>High-speed rail</heading><paragraph>Sometimes<space/><link><target>high-speed rail</target></link><space/>can serve daily use of commuters.

Japanese commuter rail also tends to be heavily interlined with subway lines, with commuter rail trains continuing into the subway network, and then out onto different commuter rail systems on the other side of the city. Many Japanese commuter systems operate several levels of express trains to reduce the travel time to distant locations, often using station bypass tracks instead of dedicated express tracks.

As with Japanese suburban railways or Germany's and Switzerland's S-Bahns, these Australian networks have far more frequent services and far higher ridership per capita than US 'commuter rail' in the usual sense of the term. To some US observers these networks may appear to operate as commuter/metro hybrids, however, they are simply the result of full utilisation of the available track capacity in the core of the suburban rail network, this being fed from multiple feeder lines. This is particularly so in Sydney and Melbourne, where headways on many lines in the core of the network reach 35 minutes in peaks and 1020 minutes off peak (about 18 hours a day) and enter an underground loop for passenger distribution in the city centre; and where ridership per capita exceeds the sum of metro and commuter rail in comparable North American urban areas such as Toronto, Boston or the San Francisco Bay Area. All systems, however, are based on established main line rail systems, and track sharing with inter-city and freight services on parts of the network inhibit higher frequencies on some tracks.
