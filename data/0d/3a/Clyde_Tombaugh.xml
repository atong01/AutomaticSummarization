When he shifted between the two images, a moving object, such as a planet, would appear to jump from one position to another, while the more distant objects such as stars would appear stationary. Tombaugh noticed such a moving object in his search, near the place predicted by Lowell, and subsequent observations showed it to have an orbit beyond that of Neptune. This ruled out classification as an asteroid, and they decided this was the ninth planet that Lowell had predicted. The discovery was made on Tuesday, February 18, 1930, using images taken the previous month.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.kshs.org/portraits/tombaugh_clyde.htm'>Kansas State Historical Society portrait</link></extension><space/>The name &quot;Pluto&quot; was suggested by<space/><link><target>Venetia Burney</target></link>, then an 11-year-old<space/><link><target>England</target><part>English</part></link><space/>schoolgirl, who died in April 2009, having lived to see the reclassification of Pluto as a dwarf planet.
