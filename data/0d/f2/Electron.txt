The [[#Quantum properties|wave properties of electrons]] are easier to observe with experiments than those of other particles like neutrons and protons because electrons have a lower mass and hence a higher [[De Broglie wavelength]] for typical energies.

Many [[physics|physical]] phenomena involve electrons in an essential role, such as [[electricity]], [[magnetism]], and [[thermal conductivity]], and they also participate in [[gravitation]]al, [[Lorentz force|electromagnetic]] and [[weak interaction|weak]] [[Fundamental interaction|interactions]].<ref name="anastopoulos1" /> An electron generates an [[electric field]] surrounding it. An electron moving relative to an observer generates a [[magnetic field]]. External magnetic fields deflect an electron. Electrons radiate or absorb energy in the form of photons when accelerated. Laboratory instruments are capable of containing and observing individual electrons as well as [[Plasma (physics)|electron plasma]] using electromagnetic fields, whereas dedicated [[telescope]]s can detect electron plasma in outer space.

==History==
{{See also|History of electromagnetic theory|label 1=History of electromagnetism}}

The [[Ancient Greece#Science and technology|ancient Greeks]] noticed that [[amber]] attracted small objects when rubbed with fur. Along with [[lightning]], this phenomenon is one of humanity's earliest recorded experiences with [[Electricity#History|electricity]].
<ref name="DictOrigins" /> In his 1600 treatise {{lang|la|''[[De Magnete]]''}}, the English scientist [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] coined the [[New Latin]] term {{lang|la|''electricus''}}, to refer to this property of attracting small objects after being rubbed.
<ref name="Baigrie1" /> Both ''electric'' and ''electricity'' are derived from the Latin ''{{lang|la|ēlectrum}}'' (also the root of the [[electrum|alloy of the same name]]), which came from the Greek word for amber, {{lang|grc|ἤλεκτρον}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|ēlektron}}'').

In the early 1700s, [[Francis Hauksbee]] and French chemist [[Charles François de Cisternay du Fay|Charles François de Fay]] independently discovered what they believed were two kinds of frictional electricity—one generated from rubbing glass, the other from rubbing resin. From this, Du Fay theorized that electricity consists of two [[Aether theories|electrical fluids]], ''vitreous'' and ''resinous'', that are separated by friction, and that neutralize each other when combined.<ref>

Stoney initially coined the term ''electrolion'' in 1881. Ten years later, he switched to ''electron'' to describe these elementary charges, writing in 1894: "... an estimate was made of the actual amount of this most remarkable fundamental unit of electricity, for which I have since ventured to suggest the name ''electron''". A 1906 proposal to change to ''electrion'' failed because [[Hendrik Lorentz]] preferred to keep ''electron''.<ref>

The German physicist [[Johann Wilhelm Hittorf]] studied electrical conductivity in [[wikt:rarefied|rarefied]] gases: in 1869, he discovered a glow emitted from the [[cathode]] that increased in size with decrease in gas pressure. In 1876, the German physicist [[Eugen Goldstein]] showed that the rays from this glow cast a shadow, and he dubbed the rays [[cathode ray]]s.<ref>[[#refDahl1997|Dahl (1997:55–58).]]</ref> During the 1870s, the English chemist and physicist Sir [[William Crookes]] developed the first cathode ray tube to have a [[vacuum|high vacuum]] inside.<ref name="dekosky">

The German-born British physicist [[Arthur Schuster]] expanded upon Crookes' experiments by placing metal plates parallel to the cathode rays and applying an [[electric potential]] between the plates. The field deflected the rays toward the positively charged plate, providing further evidence that the rays carried negative charge. By measuring the amount of deflection for a given level of [[Electric current|current]], in 1890 Schuster was able to estimate the [[Mass-to-charge ratio|charge-to-mass ratio]]<!-- Note: the older sources list charge-to-mass rather than the modern mass-to-charge ratio --> of the ray components. However, this produced a value that was more than a thousand times greater than what was expected, so little credence was given to his calculations at the time.<ref name="leicester"/><ref>[[#refDahl1997|Dahl (1997:99).]]</ref>

In 1896, the British physicist [[J. J. Thomson]], with his colleagues [[John Sealy Townsend|John S. Townsend]] and [[Harold A. Wilson (physicist)|H. A.

The electron's charge was more carefully measured by the American physicists [[Robert Andrews Millikan|Robert Millikan]] and [[Harvey Fletcher]] in their [[Oil drop experiment|oil-drop experiment]] of 1909, the results of which were published in 1911. This experiment used an electric field to prevent a charged droplet of oil from falling as a result of gravity. This device could measure the electric charge from as few as 1–150 ions with an error margin of less than 0.3%. Comparable experiments had been done earlier by Thomson's team,<ref name="thomson"/> using clouds of charged water droplets generated by electrolysis,<ref name="dahl"/> and in 1911 by [[Abram Ioffe]], who independently obtained the same result as Millikan using charged microparticles of metals, then published his results in 1913.<ref>

This small difference was later called [[anomalous magnetic dipole moment]] of the electron.

}}</ref> In [[classical physics]], the angular momentum and magnetic moment of an object depend upon its physical dimensions. Hence, the concept of a dimensionless electron possessing these properties might seem paradoxical and inconsistent to experimental observations in Penning traps which point to finite non-zero radius of the electron. A possible explanation of this paradoxical situation is given below in the "[[#Virtual particles|Virtual particles" subsection]] by taking into consideration the [[Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation]]. The issue of the radius of the electron is a challenging problem of the modern theoretical physics. The admission of the hypothesis of a finite radius of the electron is incompatible to the premises of the theory of relativity. On the other hand, a point-like electron (zero radius) generates serious mathematical difficulties due to the [[self-energy]] of the electron tending to infinity.<ref>[[Eduard Shpolsky]], Atomic physics (Atomnaia fizika),second edition, 1951</ref> These aspects have been analyzed in detail by [[Dmitri Ivanenko]] and [[Arseny Sokolov]].

===Quantum properties===
As with all particles, electrons can act as waves. This is called the [[wave–particle duality]] and can be demonstrated using the [[double-slit experiment]].

The wave-like nature of the electron allows it to pass through two parallel slits simultaneously, rather than just one slit as would be the case for a classical particle. In quantum mechanics, the wave-like property of one particle can be described mathematically as a [[complex number|complex]]-valued function, the [[wave function]], commonly denoted by the Greek letter psi (''ψ''). When the [[Absolute value#Complex numbers|absolute value]] of this function is [[square (algebra)|squared]], it gives the probability that a particle will be observed near a location—a [[probability density function|probability density]].<ref name="munowitz">{{cite book

There are symmetric hills along one axis and symmetric valleys along the other, roughly giving a saddle-shape|Example of an antisymmetric wave function for a quantum state of [[Particle in a box|two identical fermions in a 1-dimensional box]]. If the particles swap position, the wave function inverts its sign.]]
Electrons are [[identical particles]] because they cannot be distinguished from each other by their intrinsic physical properties. In quantum mechanics, this means that a pair of interacting electrons must be able to swap positions without an observable change to the state of the system. The wave function of fermions, including electrons, is antisymmetric, meaning that it changes sign when two electrons are swapped; that is, {{nowrap|''ψ''(''r''<sub>1</sub>, ''r''<sub>2</sub>) {{=}} −''ψ''(''r''<sub>2</sub>, ''r''<sub>1</sub>)}}, where the variables ''r''<sub>1</sub> and ''r''<sub>2</sub> correspond to the first and second electrons, respectively. Since the absolute value is not changed by a sign swap, this corresponds to equal probabilities. [[Boson]]s, such as the photon, have symmetric wave functions instead.<ref name="munowitz"/>{{rp|162–218}}

In the case of antisymmetry, solutions of the wave equation for interacting electrons result in a zero probability that each pair will occupy the same location or state. This is responsible for the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which precludes any two electrons from occupying the same quantum state. This principle explains many of the properties of electrons. For example, it causes groups of bound electrons to occupy different [[atomic orbital|orbitals]] in an atom, rather than all overlapping each other in the same orbit.<ref name="munowitz"/>{{rp|162–218}}

While an electron–positron virtual pair is in existence, the [[Coulomb's law|coulomb force]] from the ambient [[electric field]] surrounding an electron causes a created positron to be attracted to the original electron, while a created electron experiences a repulsion. This causes what is called [[vacuum polarization]]. In effect, the vacuum behaves like a medium having a [[Relative permittivity|dielectric permittivity]] more than unity. Thus the effective charge of an electron is actually smaller than its true value, and the charge decreases with increasing distance from the electron.<ref name="genz">

An electron can be ''bound'' to the nucleus of an atom by the attractive Coulomb force. A system of one or more electrons bound to a nucleus is called an atom. If the number of electrons is different from the nucleus' electrical charge, such an atom is called an [[ion]]. The wave-like behavior of a bound electron is described by a function called an [[atomic orbital]]. Each orbital has its own set of quantum numbers such as energy, angular momentum and projection of angular momentum, and only a discrete set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus. According to the Pauli exclusion principle each orbital can be occupied by up to two electrons, which must differ in their [[spin quantum number]].

Electrons can transfer between different orbitals by the emission or absorption of photons with an energy that matches the difference in potential.<ref>

The orbital angular momentum of electrons is [[Angular momentum operator#Quantization|quantized]]. Because the electron is charged, it produces an orbital magnetic moment that is proportional to the angular momentum. The net magnetic moment of an atom is equal to the vector sum of orbital and spin magnetic moments of all electrons and the nucleus. The magnetic moment of the nucleus is negligible compared with that of the electrons. The magnetic moments of the electrons that occupy the same orbital (so called, paired electrons) cancel each other out.<ref>

These are electrons with opposed spins, allowing them to occupy the same molecular orbital without violating the Pauli exclusion principle (much like in atoms). Different molecular orbitals have different spatial distribution of the electron density. For instance, in bonded pairs (i.e. in the pairs that actually bind atoms together) electrons can be found with the maximal probability in a relatively small volume between the nuclei. On the contrary, in non-bonded pairs electrons are distributed in a large volume around nuclei.<ref>

If a body has more or fewer electrons than are required to balance the positive charge of the nuclei, then that object has a net electric charge. When there is an excess of electrons, the object is said to be negatively charged. When there are fewer electrons than the number of protons in nuclei, the object is said to be positively charged. When the number of electrons and the number of protons are equal, their charges cancel each other and the object is said to be electrically neutral. A macroscopic body can develop an electric charge through rubbing, by the [[triboelectric effect]].<ref>

Metals make relatively good conductors of heat, primarily because the delocalized electrons are free to transport thermal energy between atoms. However, unlike electrical conductivity, the thermal conductivity of a metal is nearly independent of temperature. This is expressed mathematically by the [[Wiedemann–Franz law]],<ref name="ziman" /> which states that the ratio of [[thermal conductivity]] to the electrical conductivity is proportional to the temperature. The thermal disorder in the metallic lattice increases the electrical [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|resistivity]] of the material, producing a temperature dependence for electric current.<ref name="durrant">

When cooled below a point called the [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical temperature]], materials can undergo a phase transition in which they lose all resistivity to electric current, in a process known as [[superconductivity]]. In [[BCS theory]], this behavior is modeled by pairs of electrons entering a quantum state known as a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]. These [[Cooper pair]]s have their motion coupled to nearby matter via lattice vibrations called [[phonon]]s, thereby avoiding the collisions with atoms that normally create electrical resistance.<ref>

===Motion and energy===
According to [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] theory of [[special relativity]], as an electron's speed approaches the [[speed of light]], from an observer's point of view its [[Mass in special relativity|relativistic mass]] increases, thereby making it more and more difficult to accelerate it from within the observer's frame of reference. The speed of an electron can approach, but never reach, the speed of light in a vacuum, ''c''. However, when relativistic electrons—that is, electrons moving at a speed close to ''c''—are injected into a dielectric medium such as water, where the local speed of light is significantly less than ''c'', the electrons temporarily travel faster than light in the medium. As they interact with the medium, they generate a faint light called [[Cherenkov radiation]].<ref>

Roughly one million years after the big bang, the first generation of [[star]]s began to form.<ref name="science5789"/> Within a star, [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] results in the production of positrons from the fusion of atomic nuclei. These antimatter particles immediately annihilate with electrons, releasing gamma rays. The net result is a steady reduction in the number of electrons, and a matching increase in the number of neutrons. However, the process of [[stellar evolution]] can result in the synthesis of radioactive isotopes. Selected isotopes can subsequently undergo negative beta decay, emitting an electron and antineutrino from the nucleus.<ref>

Remote observation of electrons requires detection of their radiated energy. For example, in high-energy environments such as the [[corona]] of a star, free electrons form a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] that radiates energy due to [[Bremsstrahlung]] radiation. Electron gas can undergo [[plasma oscillation]], which is waves caused by synchronized variations in electron density, and these produce energy emissions that can be detected by using [[radio telescope]]s.<ref>

The [[frequency]] of a [[photon]] is proportional to its energy. As a bound electron transitions between different energy levels of an atom, it absorbs or emits photons at characteristic frequencies. For instance, when atoms are irradiated by a source with a broad spectrum, distinct [[spectral line|absorption lines]] appear in the spectrum of transmitted radiation. Each element or molecule displays a characteristic set of spectral lines, such as the [[hydrogen spectral series]]. [[Spectroscopy|Spectroscopic]] measurements of the strength and width of these lines allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.<ref>

In laboratory conditions, the interactions of individual electrons can be observed by means of [[particle detector]]s, which allow measurement of specific properties such as energy, spin and charge.<ref name="grupen"/> The development of the [[quadrupole ion trap|Paul trap]] and [[Penning trap]] allows charged particles to be contained within a small region for long durations.

[[Particle accelerator]]s use electric fields to propel electrons and their antiparticles to high energies.  These particles emit synchrotron radiation as they pass through magnetic fields. The dependency of the intensity of this radiation upon spin polarizes the electron beam—a process known as the [[Sokolov–Ternov effect]].{{refn|The polarization of an electron beam means that the spins of all electrons point into one direction. In other words, the projections of the spins of all electrons onto their momentum vector have the same sign.|group=note}} Polarized electron beams can be useful for various experiments. [[Synchrotron]] radiation can also [[Radiation damping|cool]] the electron beams to reduce the momentum spread of the particles.  Electron and positron beams are collided upon the particles' accelerating to the required energies; [[particle detector]]s observe the resulting energy emissions, which [[particle physics]] studies .<ref>{{cite book

The electrons emit synchrotron radiation that [[Coherence (physics)|coherently]] interacts with the same electrons to strongly amplify the radiation field at the [[resonance]] frequency.
