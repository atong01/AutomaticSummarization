An '''antibody''' (Ab), also known as an '''immunoglobulin''' (Ig), is a large, Y-shape [[protein]] produced by [[plasma cell]]s that is used by the [[immune system]] to identify and neutralize pathogens such as [[bacterium|bacteria]] and [[virus]]es. The antibody recognizes a unique molecule of the harmful agent, called an [[antigen]], via the variable region.<ref name=Janeway5>{{cite book | author =Charles Janeway | title = Immunobiology. | edition = 5th | publisher = Garland Publishing | year = 2001 | id = [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&rid=imm.TOC&depth=10 (electronic full text via NCBI Bookshelf)]| isbn = 0-8153-3642-X }}</ref><ref name="pmid8450761">{{cite journal |author=Litman GW, Rast JP, Shamblott MJ, Haire RN, Hulst M, Roess W, Litman RT, Hinds-Frey KR, Zilch A, Amemiya CT | title = Phylogenetic diversification of immunoglobulin genes and the antibody repertoire | journal = Mol.

Using this binding mechanism, an antibody can ''tag'' a [[microbe]] or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system, or can neutralize its target directly (for example, by blocking a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival). The ability of an antibody to communicate with the other components of the immune system is mediated via its Fc region (located at the base of the "Y"), which contains a conserved [[glycosylation]] site involved in these interactions.<ref name = "immune_glycan"/> The production of antibodies is the main function of the [[humoral immune system]].<ref name=Pier>{{cite book | author = Pier GB, Lyczak JB, Wetzler LM | title = Immunology, Infection, and Immunity | publisher = ASM Press| year = 2004 | isbn = 1-55581-246-5}}</ref>

Antibodies are secreted by cells of the adaptive immune system ([[B cells]]), and more specifically, differentiated B cells called [[plasma cells]]. Antibodies can occur in two physical forms, a soluble form that is secreted from the cell, and a [[cell membrane|membrane]]-bound form that is attached to the surface of a [[B cell]] and is referred to as the B cell receptor (BCR). The BCR is found only on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called [[plasma cell]]s or [[memory B cell]]s that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure.<ref name="pmid17337763">{{cite journal | author = Borghesi L, Milcarek C | title = From B cell to plasma cell: regulation of V(D)J recombination and antibody secretion | journal = Immunol.

So antibodies are one of two classes of immunoglobulins. Antibodies are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large [[heavy chain]]s and two small [[Immunoglobulin light chain|light chains]]. There are several different types of antibody heavy chains based on five different types of crystallisable fragments (Fc) that may be attached to the antigen-binding fragments. The five different types of Fc regions allow antibodies to be grouped into five ''[[isotype (immunology)|isotypes]]''. Each Fc region of a particular antibody isotype is able to bind to its specific Fc Receptor (except for IgD, which is essentially the BCR), thus allowing the antigen-antibody complex to mediate different roles depending on which FcR it binds. The ability of an antibody to bind to its corresponding FcR is further modulated by the structure of the glycan(s) present at conserved sites within its Fc region.<ref name = "immune_glycan"/> The ability of antibodies to bind to FcRs helps to direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter.<ref name="Market">{{cite journal | author = Market E, Papavasiliou FN | title = V(D)J recombination and the evolution of the adaptive immune system | journal = PLoS Biol. | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = E16 |date=October 2003 | pmid = 14551913 | pmc = 212695 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0000016 }}</ref> For example, [[IgE]] is responsible for an [[allergic]] response consisting of [[mast cell]] degranulation and [[histamine]] release.

The allergen-IgE-FcRε interaction mediates allergic signal transduction to induce conditions such as asthma. 

Though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar, a small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable, allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures, or antigen-binding sites, to exist. This region is known as the ''hypervariable region''.

Basically, the antibody paratope is polygenic, made up of three genes, V, D, and J. Each paratope locus is also polymorphic, such that during antibody production, one allele of V, one of D, and one of J is chosen. These gene segments are then joined together using random genetic recombination to produce the paratope. The regions where the genes are randomly recombined together is the hyper variable region used to recognise different antigens on a clonal basis. 

Antibody genes also re-organize in a process called [[Immunoglobulin class switching|class switching]] that changes the one type of heavy chain Fc fragment to another, creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen-specific variable region. This allows a single antibody to be used by different types of Fc receptors, expressed on different parts of the immune system.

==Forms==
The membrane-bound form of an antibody may be called a ''surface immunoglobulin'' (sIg) or a ''membrane immunoglobulin'' (mIg). It is part of the ''B cell receptor'' (BCR), which allows a B cell to detect when a specific antigen is present in the body and triggers B cell activation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Parker D|title=T cell-dependent B cell activation|journal=Annu.

==Antibody–antigen interactions==
The antibody's paratope interacts with the antigen's epitope. An antigen usually contains different epitopes along its surface arranged discontinuously, and dominant epitopes on a given antigen are called determinants. 

Antibody and antigen interact by spatial complementarity (lock and key). The molecular forces involved in the Fab-epitope interaction are weak and non-specific - for example [[Coulomb's law|electrostatic forces]], [[hydrogen bonds]], [[hydrophobic interactions]], and [[van der Waals force]]s. This means binding between antibody and antigen is reversible, and the antibody's [[Affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] towards an antigen is relative rather than absolute. Relatively weak binding also means it is possible for an antibody to cross-react with different antigens of different relative affinities.

==Isotypes==
Antibodies can come in different varieties known as [[Isotype (immunology)|isotypes]] or classes. In [[eutheria|placental]] mammals there are five antibody isotypes known as IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM. They are each named with an "Ig" prefix that stands for immunoglobulin, a name sometimes used interchangeably with antibody, and differ in their biological properties, functional locations and ability to deal with different antigens, as depicted in the table.<ref name = woof>{{cite journal |author=Woof J, Burton D |title=Human antibody-Fc receptor interactions illuminated by crystal structures. |journal=Nat Rev Immunol |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=89–99 |year=2004 |pmid=15040582 |doi=10.1038/nri1266}}</ref> The different suffixes of the antibody isotypes denote the different types of heavy chains the antibody contains, with each heavy chain class named alphabetically: α, γ, δ, ε, and μ. This gives rise to IgA, IgG, IgD, IgE, and IgM, respectively.

The antibody isotype of a [[B cell]] changes during cell [[Pre-pre B cell|development]] and activation. Immature B cells, which have never been exposed to an antigen, express only the IgM+ isotype in a cell surface bound form. The B lymphocyte, in this ready-to-respond form, is known as a "naive B lymphocyte." The naive B lymphocyte expresses both surface IgM+ and IgD+. The co-expression of both of these immunoglobulin isotypes renders the B cell ready to respond to antigen.<ref name=Goding>{{cite journal |author=Goding J |title=Allotypes of IgM and IgD receptors in the mouse: a probe for lymphocyte differentiation |journal=Contemp Top Immunobiol |volume=8 |pages=203–43 |year= 1978|pmid=357078 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4684-0922-2_7 |isbn=978-1-4684-0924-6}}</ref> B cell activation follows engagement of the cell-bound antibody molecule with an antigen, causing the cell to divide and [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into an antibody-producing cell called a [[plasma cell]].

Some [[daughter cell]]s of the activated B cells undergo [[isotype switching]], a mechanism that causes the production of antibodies to change from IgM or IgD to the other antibody isotypes, IgE, IgA, or IgG, that have defined roles in the immune system.

==Structure==
Antibodies are heavy (~150&nbsp;k[[Dalton (unit)|Da]]) [[globular protein|globular]] [[plasma protein]]s. They have sugar chains (glycans) added to conserved [[amino acid]] residues.<ref name = "immune_glycan"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Mattu T, Pleass R, Willis A, Kilian M, Wormald M, Lellouch A, Rudd P, Woof J, Dwek R |title=The glycosylation and structure of human serum IgA1, Fab, and Fc regions and the role of N-glycosylation on Fc alpha receptor interactions |journal=J Biol Chem |volume=273 |issue=4 |pages=2260–2272 |year=1998 |pmid=9442070 |doi=10.1074/jbc.273.4.2260}}</ref> In other words, antibodies are ''[[glycoprotein]]s''.<ref name = "immune_glycan"/> The attached glycans are critically important to the structure and function of the antibody.<ref name = "immune_glycan"/> Among other things the expressed glycans can modulate an antibody's affinity for its corresponding FcR(s).<ref name = "immune_glycan"/> 

The basic functional unit of each antibody is an immunoglobulin (Ig) [[monomer]] (containing only one Ig unit); secreted antibodies can also be [[protein dimer|dimeric]] with two Ig units as with IgA, [[tetramer protein|tetrameric]] with four Ig units like [[teleost fish]] IgM, or [[pentamer]]ic with five Ig units, like mammalian IgM.<ref name = roux>{{cite journal |author=Roux K |title=Immunoglobulin structure and function as revealed by electron microscopy |journal=Int Arch Allergy Immunol |volume=120 |issue=2 |pages=85–99 |year=1999 |pmid=10545762 |doi=10.1159/000024226}}</ref>
[[File:Antibody IgG2.png|thumb|right|Several immunoglobulin domains make up the two heavy chains (red and blue) and the two light chains (green and yellow) of an antibody. The immunoglobulin domains are composed of between 7 (for constant domains) and 9 (for variable domains) [[β-strand]]s. ]] The variable parts of an antibody are its V regions, and the constant part is its C region.

===Immunoglobulin domains===
The Ig monomer is a "Y"-shaped molecule that consists of four [[polypeptide]] chains; two identical ''heavy chains'' and two identical ''light chains'' connected by [[disulfide bond]]s.<ref name = woof/>
Each chain is composed of [[structural domain]]s called [[immunoglobulin domain]]s. These domains contain about 70–110 [[amino acid]]s and are classified into different categories (for example, variable or IgV, and constant or IgC) according to their size and function.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Barclay A |title=Membrane proteins with immunoglobulin-like domains – a master superfamily of interaction molecules |journal=Semin Immunol |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=215–223 |year=2003 |pmid=14690046 |doi=10.1016/S1044-5323(03)00047-2}}</ref> They have a characteristic [[immunoglobulin fold]] in which two [[beta sheet]]s create a "sandwich" shape, held together by interactions between conserved [[cysteine]]s and other charged amino acids.

===Heavy chain===
{{details|Immunoglobulin heavy chain}}
There are five types of mammalian Ig [[Immunoglobulin heavy chain|heavy chain]] denoted by the [[Greek letters]]: [[α]], [[δ]], [[ε]], [[γ]], and [[μ]].<ref name=Janeway5/> The type of heavy chain present defines the ''class'' of antibody; these chains are found in IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM antibodies, respectively.<ref name=Rhoades/> Distinct heavy chains differ in size and composition; α and γ contain approximately 450 amino acids, whereas μ and ε have approximately 550 [[amino acid]]s.<ref name=Janeway5/>

In [[bird]]s, the major serum antibody, also found in yolk, is called [[Immunoglobulin Y|IgY]]. It is quite different from mammalian IgG. However, in some older literature and even on some commercial life sciences product websites it is still called "IgG", which is incorrect and can be confusing.

Each heavy chain has two regions, the ''constant region'' and the ''variable region''. The constant region is identical in all antibodies of the same isotype, but differs in antibodies of different isotypes. Heavy chains γ, α and δ have a constant region composed of ''three'' tandem (in a line) Ig [[Structural domain|domains]], and a hinge region for added flexibility;<ref name = woof/> heavy chains μ and ε have a constant region composed of ''four'' immunoglobulin domains.<ref name=Janeway5/> The variable region of the heavy chain differs in antibodies produced by different B cells, but is the same for all antibodies produced by a single B cell or [[Clone (B-cell biology)|B cell clone]]. The variable region of each heavy chain is approximately 110 amino acids long and is composed of a single Ig domain.

===Light chain===
{{details|Immunoglobulin light chain}}
In mammals there are two types of [[immunoglobulin light chain]], which are called [[lambda]] (λ) and [[kappa]] (κ).<ref name=Janeway5/> A light chain has two successive domains: one constant domain and one variable domain. The approximate length of a light chain is 211 to 217 amino acids.<ref name=Janeway5/> Each antibody contains two light chains that are always identical; only one type of light chain, κ or λ, is present per antibody in mammals. Other types of light chains, such as the [[iota]] (ι) chain, are found in other [[vertebrate]]s like sharks ([[Chondrichthyes]]) and bony fishes ([[Teleostei]]).

Some parts of an antibody have the same functions. The arms of the Y, for example, contain the sites that can bind to antigens (in general, identical) and, therefore, recognize specific foreign objects. This region of the antibody is called the ''[[Fab region|Fab (fragment, antigen-binding) region]]''. It is composed of one constant and one variable domain from each heavy and light chain of the antibody.<ref name= putnam79>{{cite journal |author=Putnam FW, Liu YS, Low TL |title=Primary structure of a human IgA1 immunoglobulin.

The [[paratope]] is shaped at the [[N-terminal end|amino terminal end]] of the antibody [[monomer]] by the variable domains from the heavy and light chains. The variable domain is also referred to as the F<sub>V</sub> region and is the most important region for binding to antigens. To be specific, variable loops of β-strands, three each on the light (V<sub>L</sub>) and heavy (V<sub>H</sub>) chains are responsible for binding to the antigen. These loops are referred to as the [[complementarity determining region]]s (CDRs).
The structures of these CDRs have been clustered and classified by Chothia et al.<ref name= Chothia1997>

In the framework of the [[immune network theory]], CDRs are also called idiotypes. According to immune network theory, the adaptive immune system is regulated by interactions between idiotypes.

The base of the Y plays a role in modulating immune cell activity. This region is called the ''[[Fc region|Fc (Fragment, crystallizable) region]]'', and is composed of two heavy chains that contribute two or three constant domains depending on the class of the antibody.<ref name=Janeway5/> Thus, the Fc region ensures that each antibody generates an appropriate immune response for a given antigen, by binding to a specific class of [[Fc receptor]]s, and other immune molecules, such as [[Complement system|complement]] proteins. By doing this, it mediates different [[physiological]] effects including recognition of [[opsonization|opsonized]] particles (binding to FcγR), [[lysis]] of cells (binding to complement), and [[degranulation]] of [[mast cells]], [[basophils]], and [[eosinophils]] (binding to FcεR).<ref name = woof/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Heyman B |title=Complement and Fc-receptors in regulation of the antibody response |journal=Immunol Lett |volume=54 |issue=2–3 |pages=195–199 |year=1996 |pmid=9052877 |doi=10.1016/S0165-2478(96)02672-7}}</ref>

In summary, whilst the Fab region of the antibody determines its antigen specificity, the Fc region of the antibody determines the antibody's class effect. Since only the constant domains of the heavy chains make up the Fc region of an antibody, the classes of heavy chain in antibodies determine their class effects. Possible classes of heavy chains in antibodies include alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon, and mu, and they define the antibody's isotypes IgA, G, D, E, and M, respectively. This infers different isotypes of antibodies have different class effects due to their different Fc regions binding and activating different types of receptors. Possible class effects of antibodies include: Opsonisation, agglutination, haemolysis, complement activation, mast cell degranulation, and neutralisation (though this class effect may be mediated by the Fab region rather than the Fc region). It also implies that Fab-mediated effects are directed at microbes or toxins, whilst Fc mediated effects are directed at effector cells or effector molecules (see below).

At the [[prenatal]] and neonatal stages of life, the presence of antibodies is provided by [[passive immunization]] from the mother. Early endogenous antibody production varies for different kinds of antibodies, and usually appear within the first years of life. Since antibodies exist freely in the bloodstream, they are said to be part of the [[humoral immune system]]. Circulating antibodies are produced by clonal B cells that specifically respond to only one [[antigen]] (an example is a [[virus]] [[capsid|capsid protein]] fragment). Antibodies contribute to [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] in three ways: They prevent pathogens from entering or damaging cells by binding to them; they stimulate removal of pathogens by [[macrophages]] and other cells by coating the pathogen; and they trigger destruction of pathogens by stimulating other [[immune response]]s such as the [[complement system|complement pathway]].<ref name=Ravetch>{{cite journal |author=Ravetch J, Bolland S |title=IgG Fc receptors |journal=Annu Rev Immunol |volume=19 |issue= 1|pages=275–290 |year=2001 |pmid=11244038 |doi=10.1146/annurev.immunol.19.1.275}}</ref>Antibodies will also trigger vasoactive amine degranulation to contribute to immunity against certain types of antigens (helminths, allergens). 

[[File:IgM white background.png|thumb|left|The secreted mammalian [[IgM]] has five Ig units. Each Ig unit (labeled 1) has two epitope binding [[Fab region]]s, so IgM is capable of binding up to 10 epitopes.]]

===Activation of complement===
Antibodies that bind to surface antigens (for example, on bacteria) will attract the first component of the [[complement cascade]] with their [[Fv region|Fc region]] and initiate activation of the "classical" complement system.<ref name=Ravetch/> This results in the killing of bacteria in two ways.<ref name=Pier/> First, the binding of the antibody and complement molecules marks the microbe for ingestion by [[phagocyte]]s in a process called [[opsonization]]; these phagocytes are attracted by certain complement molecules generated in the complement cascade. Second, some complement system components form a [[Complement membrane attack complex|membrane attack complex]] to assist antibodies to kill the bacterium directly (bacteriolysis).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rus H, Cudrici C, Niculescu F |title=The role of the complement system in innate immunity |journal=Immunol Res |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=103–112 |year=2005 |pmid=16234578 |doi=10.1385/IR:33:2:103}}</ref> 

===Activation of effector cells===
To combat pathogens that replicate outside cells, antibodies bind to pathogens to link them together, causing them to [[Agglutination (biology)|agglutinate]]. Since an antibody has at least two paratopes, it can bind more than one antigen by binding identical epitopes carried on the surfaces of these antigens. By coating the pathogen, antibodies stimulate effector functions against the pathogen in cells that recognize their Fc region.<ref name=Pier/>

Those cells that recognize coated pathogens have Fc receptors, which, as the name suggests, interact with the [[Fc region]] of IgA, IgG, and IgE antibodies. The engagement of a particular antibody with the Fc receptor on a particular cell triggers an effector function of that cell; phagocytes will [[phagocytosis|phagocytose]], [[mast cell]]s and [[neutrophil]]s will [[degranulation|degranulate]], [[natural killer cell]]s will release [[cytokine]]s and [[cytotoxic]] molecules; that will ultimately result in destruction of the invading microbe. The activation of natural killer cells by antibodies initiates a cytotoxic mechanism known as [[antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity]] (ADCC) - this process may explain the efficacy of [[monoclonal antibodies]] used in [[biopharmaceutical|biological]] therapies against [[cancer]]. The Fc receptors are isotype-specific, which gives greater flexibility to the immune system, invoking only the appropriate immune mechanisms for distinct pathogens.<ref name=Janeway5/>

===Natural antibodies===
Humans and higher primates also produce "natural antibodies" that are present in serum before viral infection. Natural antibodies have been defined as antibodies that are produced without any previous infection, vaccination, other foreign antigen exposure or [[passive immunization]]. These antibodies can activate the classical complement pathway leading to lysis of enveloped virus particles long before the adaptive immune response is activated. Many natural antibodies are directed against the disaccharide [[galactose]] α(1,3)-galactose (α-Gal), which is found as a terminal sugar on [[glycosylated]] cell surface proteins, and generated in response to production of this sugar by bacteria contained in the human gut.<ref>{{cite web |author= Racaniello, Vincent| url=http://www.virology.ws/2009/10/06/natural-antibody-protects-against-viral-infection/ |date=6 October 2009 |title=Natural antibody protects against viral infection |work=Virology Blog |accessdate=22 January 2010|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uJzysytc |archivedate = 17 November 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref> Rejection of [[Organ xenotransplantation|xenotransplantated organs]] is thought to be, in part, the result of natural antibodies circulating in the serum of the recipient binding to α-Gal antigens expressed on the donor tissue.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Milland J, Sandrin MS |title=ABO blood group and related antigens, natural antibodies and transplantation |journal=Tissue Antigens |volume=68 |issue=6 |pages=459–466 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17176435 |doi=10.1111/j.1399-0039.2006.00721.x }}</ref>

==Immunoglobulin diversity==
Virtually all microbes can trigger an antibody response. Successful recognition and eradication of many different types of microbes requires diversity among antibodies; their amino acid composition varies allowing them to interact with many different antigens.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mian I, Bradwell A, Olson A |title=Structure, function and properties of antibody binding sites |journal=J Mol Biol |volume=217 |issue=1 |pages=133–151 |year=1991 |pmid=1988675 |doi=10.1016/0022-2836(91)90617-F}}</ref> It has been estimated that humans generate about 10&nbsp;billion different antibodies, each capable of binding a distinct epitope of an antigen.<ref name="pmid8612345">{{cite journal |author=Fanning LJ, Connor AM, Wu GE |title=Development of the immunoglobulin repertoire |journal=Clin.

===Domain variability===
[[File:Complementarity determining regions.PNG|thumb|250px|right|The complementarity determining regions of the heavy chain are shown in red ({{PDB|1IGT}})]]
The chromosomal region that encodes an antibody is large and contains several distinct gene loci for each domain of the antibody—the chromosome region containing heavy chain genes ([[IGH@]]) is found on [[chromosome 14]], and the loci containing lambda and kappa light chain genes ([[IGL@]] and [[IGK@]]) are found on chromosomes [[chromosome 22|22]] and [[chromosome 2|2]] in humans. One of these domains is called the variable domain, which is present in each heavy and light chain of every antibody, but can differ in different antibodies generated from distinct B cells. Differences, between the variable domains, are located on three loops known as hypervariable regions (HV-1, HV-2 and HV-3) or [[complementarity determining region]]s (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3). CDRs are supported within the variable domains by conserved framework regions. The heavy chain locus contains about 65 different variable domain genes that all differ in their CDRs. Combining these genes with an array of genes for other domains of the antibody generates a large cavalry of antibodies with a high degree of variability. This combination is called V(D)J recombination discussed below.<ref>Peter Parham. "The Immune System. 2nd ed. Garland Science: New York, 2005. pg.47–62</ref>

===V(D)J recombination===
{{details|V%28D%29J recombination}}
[[File:VDJ recombination.png|thumb|250px|right|Simplified overview of V(D)J recombination of immunoglobulin heavy chains]]
Somatic recombination of immunoglobulins, also known as ''V(D)J recombination'', involves the generation of a unique immunoglobulin variable region. The variable region of each immunoglobulin heavy or light chain is encoded in several pieces—known as gene segments (subgenes). These segments are called variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) segments.<ref name = namazee/> V, D and J segments are found in [[immunoglobulin heavy chain|Ig heavy chains]], but only V and J segments are found in [[Immunoglobulin light chain|Ig light chains]]. Multiple copies of the V, D and J gene segments exist, and are tandemly arranged in the [[genome]]s of [[mammal]]s. In the bone marrow, each developing B cell will assemble an immunoglobulin variable region by randomly selecting and combining one V, one D and one J gene segment (or one V and one J segment in the light chain). As there are multiple copies of each type of gene segment, and different combinations of gene segments can be used to generate each immunoglobulin variable region, this process generates a huge number of antibodies, each with different [[wikt:paratope|paratopes]], and thus different antigen specificities.<ref name=Market/> Interestingly, the rearrangement of several subgenes (i.e. V2 family) for lambda light chain immunoglobulin is coupled with the activation of microRNA miR-650, which further influences biology of B-cells.<ref>{{Cite journal

After a B cell produces a functional immunoglobulin gene during V(D)J recombination, it cannot express any other variable region (a process known as [[allelic exclusion]]) thus each B cell can produce antibodies containing only one kind of variable chain.<ref name=Janeway5/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bergman Y, Cedar H |title=A stepwise epigenetic process controls immunoglobulin allelic exclusion |journal=Nat Rev Immunol |volume=4 |issue=10 |pages=753–761 |year=2004 |pmid=15459667 |doi=10.1038/nri1458}}</ref>

===Somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation===
:''For more details on this topic, see [[Somatic hypermutation]] and [[Affinity maturation]]''

Following activation with antigen, B cells begin to [[Cell division|proliferate]] rapidly. In these rapidly dividing cells, the genes encoding the variable domains of the heavy and light chains undergo a high rate of [[point mutation]], by a process called ''somatic hypermutation'' (SHM). SHM results in approximately one [[nucleotide]] change per variable gene, per cell division.<ref name=diaz/> As a consequence, any daughter B cells will acquire slight [[amino acid]] differences in the variable domains of their antibody chains.

This serves to increase the diversity of the antibody pool and impacts the antibody's antigen-binding [[Chemical affinity|affinity]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Honjo T, Habu S |title=Origin of immune diversity: genetic variation and selection |journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=54 |issue= 1|pages=803–830 |year=1985 |pmid=3927822 |doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.54.070185.004103}}</ref> Some point mutations will result in the production of antibodies that have a weaker interaction (low affinity) with their antigen than the original antibody, and some mutations will generate antibodies with a stronger interaction (high affinity).<ref name=orguil>{{cite journal |author=Or-Guil M, Wittenbrink N, Weiser AA, Schuchhardt J |title=Recirculation of germinal center B cells: a multilevel selection strategy for antibody maturation |journal=Immunol.

The process of generating antibodies with increased binding affinities is called ''affinity maturation''. Affinity maturation occurs in mature B cells after V(D)J recombination, and is dependent on help from [[helper T cell]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Neuberger M, Ehrenstein M, Rada C, Sale J, Batista F, Williams G, Milstein C |title=Memory in the B-cell compartment: antibody affinity maturation |journal=Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci |volume=355 |issue=1395 |pages=357–360 |date=March 2000 |pmid=10794054 |pmc=1692737 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2000.0573}}</ref>
[[File:Class switch recombination.png|thumb|250px|right|Mechanism of class switch recombination that allows isotype switching in activated B cells]]

===Class switching===
[[Immunoglobulin class switching|Isotype or class switching]] is a [[biological process]] occurring after activation of the B cell, which allows the cell to produce different classes of antibody (IgA, IgE, or IgG).<ref name=Market/> The different classes of antibody, and thus effector functions, are defined by the constant (C) regions of the immunoglobulin heavy chain. Initially, naive B cells express only cell-surface IgM and IgD with identical antigen binding regions. Each isotype is adapted for a distinct function; therefore, after activation, an antibody with an IgG, IgA, or IgE effector function might be required to effectively eliminate an antigen. Class switching allows different daughter cells from the same activated B cell to produce antibodies of different isotypes. Only the constant region of the antibody heavy chain changes during class switching; the variable regions, and therefore antigen specificity, remain unchanged. Thus the progeny of a single B cell can produce antibodies, all specific for the same antigen, but with the ability to produce the effector function appropriate for each antigenic challenge. Class switching is triggered by cytokines; the isotype generated depends on which cytokines are present in the B cell environment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stavnezer J, Amemiya CT |title=Evolution of isotype switching |journal=Semin. Immunol. |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=257–275 |year=2004 |pmid=15522624 |doi=10.1016/j.smim.2004.08.005}}</ref>

Class switching occurs in the heavy chain gene [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] by a mechanism called class switch recombination (CSR). This mechanism relies on conserved [[nucleotide]] motifs, called ''switch (S) regions'', found in [[DNA]] upstream of each constant region gene (except in the δ-chain). The DNA strand is broken by the activity of a series of [[enzyme]]s at two selected S-regions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Durandy A |title=Activation-induced cytidine deaminase: a dual role in class-switch recombination and somatic hypermutation |journal=Eur.

In contrast, a group of antibodies can be called ''polyvalent'' (or ''unspecific'') if they have affinity for various antigens<ref name=farlex-polyvalent/> or microorganisms.<ref name=farlex-polyvalent>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/polyvalent Farlex dictionary > polyvalent] Citing: The American Heritage Medical Dictionary. 2004</ref> [[Intravenous immunoglobulin]], if not otherwise noted, consists of polyvalent IgG. In contrast, [[monoclonal antibodies]] are monovalent for the same epitope.

===Asymmetrical antibodies===
Heterodimeric antibodies, which are also asymmetrical and antibodies, allow for greater flexibility and new formats for attaching a variety of drugs to the antibody arms. One of the general formats for a heterodimeric antibody is the “knobs-into-holes” format. This format is specific to the heavy chain part of the constant region in antibodies. The “knobs” part is engineered by replacing a small amino acid with a larger one. It fits into the “hole”, which is engineered by replacing a large amino acid with a smaller one. What connects the “knobs” to the “holes” are the disulfide bonds between each chain. The “knobs-into-holes” shape facilitates antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. Single chain variable fragments (scFv) are connected to the variable domain of the heavy and light chain via a short linker peptide. The linker is rich in glycine, which gives it more flexibility, and serine/threonine, which gives it specificity. Two different scFv fragments can be connected together, via a hinge region, to the constant domain of the heavy chain or the constant domain of the light chain.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gunasekaran L |title=Enhancing antibody Fc heterodimer formation through electrostatic steering effects: applications to bispecific molecules and monovalent IgG |journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=285 |issue=25 |pages=19637–19646 |year=2010 |doi=10.1016/S0014-5793(98)00021-0}}</ref> This gives the antibody bispecificity, allowing for the binding specificities of two different antigens.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Muller K.M |title=The first constant domain (CH1 and CL) of an antibody used as heterodimerization domain for bispecific miniantibodies |journal=FEBS Letters |volume=422 |issue=2 |pages=259–264 |year=1998 |doi=10.1074/jbc.M110.117382}}</ref> The “knobs-into-holes” format enhances heterodimer formation but doesn’t suppress homodimer formation.

To further improve the function of heterodimeric antibodies, many scientists are looking towards artificial constructs. Artificial antibodies are largely diverse protein motifs that use the functional strategy of the antibody molecule, but aren’t limited by the loop and framework structural constraints of the natural antibody.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gao C |title=Making artificial antibodies: A format for phage display of combinatorial heterodimeric arrays |journal=PNAS |volume=96 |issue=11 |pages=6025–6030 |year=1999 |doi=10.1073/pnas.96.11.6025 |pmid=10339535 |pmc=26829}}</ref> Being able to control the combinational design of the sequence and three-dimensional space could transcend the natural design and allow for the attachment of different combinations of drugs to the arms.

Heterodimeric antibodies have a greater range in shapes they can take and the drugs that are attached to the arms don’t have to be the same on each arm, allowing for different combinations of drugs to be used in cancer treatment. Pharmaceuticals are able to produce highly functional bispecific, and even multispecific, antibodies. The degree to which they can function is impressive given that such a change shape from the natural form should lead to decreased functionality.

Detection of particular antibodies is a very common form of medical [[medical diagnosis|diagnostics]], and applications such as [[serology]] depend on these methods.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.immunospot.eu/elisa-animation.html |title=Animated depictions of how antibodies are used in ELISA assays |accessdate=8 May 2007 |work=Cellular Technology Ltd.—Europe|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uK00Qems |archivedate = 17 November 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref> For example, in biochemical assays for disease diagnosis,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.immunospot.eu/elispot-animation.html |title=Animated depictions of how antibodies are used in ELISPOT assays |accessdate=8 May 2007 |work=Cellular Technology Ltd.—Europe|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uK00pHh5 |archivedate = 17 November 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref> a [[titer]] of antibodies directed against [[Epstein-Barr virus]] or [[Lyme disease]] is estimated from the blood.

It is important to note that this occurs before the antigen can stimulate maternal B cells to "remember" Rh antigen by generating memory B cells. Therefore, her humoral immune system will not make anti-Rh antibodies, and will not attack the Rhesus antigens of the current or subsequent babies. Rho(D) Immune Globulin treatment prevents sensitization that can lead to [[Rh disease]], but does not prevent or treat the underlying disease itself.<ref name= Fung/>

Specific antibodies are produced by injecting an [[antigen]] into a [[mammal]], such as a [[mouse]], [[rat]], [[rabbit]], [[goat]], [[sheep]], or [[horse]] for large quantities of antibody. Blood isolated from these animals contains ''[[polyclonal antibodies]]''—multiple antibodies that bind to the same antigen—in the [[Blood plasma|serum]], which can now be called [[antiserum]].

In research, purified antibodies are used in many applications. Antibodies for research applications can be found directly from antibody suppliers, or through use of a specialist search engine. Research antibodies are most commonly used to identify and locate [[intracellular]] and [[extracellular]] proteins. Antibodies are used in [[flow cytometry]] to differentiate cell types by the proteins they express; different types of cell express different combinations of [[cluster of differentiation]] molecules on their surface, and produce different intracellular and secretable proteins.<ref name=Stecher>{{cite journal |author=Brehm-Stecher B, Johnson E |title=Single-cell microbiology: tools, technologies, and applications |url=http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/content/full/68/3/538?view=long&pmid=15353569 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.68.3.538-559.2004 |journal=Microbiol Mol Biol Rev |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=538–559 |year=2004 |pmid=15353569 |pmc=515252|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uK04DmZC |archivedate = 17 November 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref> They are also used in [[immunoprecipitation]] to separate proteins and anything bound to them (co-immunoprecipitation) from other molecules in a [[cell lysate]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Williams N |title=Immunoprecipitation procedures |journal=Methods Cell Biol |volume=62|pages=449–453 |year=2000 |pmid=10503210 |doi=10.1016/S0091-679X(08)61549-6 |series=Methods in Cell Biology |isbn=978-0-12-544164-3}}</ref> in [[Western blot]] analyses to identify proteins separated by [[electrophoresis]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kurien B, Scofield R |title=Western blotting |journal=Methods |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=283–293 |year=2006 |pmid=16483794 |doi=10.1016/j.ymeth.2005.11.007}}</ref> and in [[immunohistochemistry]] or [[immunofluorescence]] to examine protein expression in tissue sections or to locate proteins within cells with the assistance of a [[microscope]].<ref name=Stecher/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Scanziani E |title=Immunohistochemical staining of fixed tissues |journal=Methods Mol Biol |volume=104 |pages=133–140 |year= 1998|pmid=9711649 |doi=10.1385/0-89603-525-5:133 |isbn=978-0-89603-525-6}}</ref> Proteins can also be detected and quantified with antibodies, using [[ELISA]] and [[ELISPOT]] techniques.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Reen DJ.|title=Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)|journal=Methods Mol Biol.|volume=32 |pages=461–466 |year= 1994|pmid=7951745 |doi=10.1385/0-89603-268-X:461 |isbn=0-89603-268-X}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Kalyuzhny AE |title=Chemistry and biology of the ELISPOT assay|journal=Methods Mol Biol.|volume=302|pages=015–032 |year= 2005|pmid=15937343 |doi=10.1385/1-59259-903-6:015 |isbn=1-59259-903-6}}</ref>

==Regulatory validation of [[monoclonal antibody]] products for [[human]] use==
'''Production and testing :<br />'''

Traditionally, most antibodies are produced by hybridoma [[cell (biology)|cell]] lines through immortalization of antibody-producing cells by chemically-induced fusion with myeloma cells. In some cases, additional fusions with other lines have created "triomas" and "quadromas". The manufacturing process should be appropriately described and validated. Validation studies should
at least include :<br />

* The demonstration that the process is able to produce in good quality (the process should be validated)
* 
* The [[efficiency]] of the antibody purification (all [[impurities]] and [[virus]] must be eliminated)
* 
* The characterization of purified antibody ([[physical chemistry|physicochemical]] characterization, [[immunological]] properties, [[biological]] activities, contaminants, ...)
* Determination of the virus clearance studies

'''Before [[clinical trials]], studies of product safety and feasibility have to be performed :'''
 
* Product safety testing : Sterility (bacteria and fungi), In vitro and in vivo testing for adventitious viruses, Murine retrovirus testing... Product safety data needed before the initiation of feasibility trials in serious or immediately life-threatening conditions, it serves to evaluate dangerous potential of the product.
* Feasibility testing :  These are pilot studies whose objectives include, among others, early characterization of safety and initial proof of concept in a small specific patient population (in vito or in vivo testing).

'''Preclinical studies : <br />'''[[File:Example of tissue cross-reactivity on human tissue microarray.jpeg|thumbnail|Example of tissue cross-reactivity on human [[tissue microarray]]]]

* Testing [[cross-reactivity]] of antibody : to highlight unwanted interactions (toxicity) of antibodies with previously characterized tissues. This study can be performed in vitro (Reactivity of the antibody or immunoconjugate should be determined with a quick-frozen adult tissues) or in vivo (with appropriates animal models). [http://www.histalim.com/accueil/activities/our-expert-services/?lang=en More informations about in vitro cross-reactivity testing.]
* Preclinical [[pharmacology]] and [[toxicity]] testing : [[Preclinical]] safety testing of antibody is designed to identify possible toxicities in humans, to estimate the likelihood and severity of potential adverse events in humans, and to identify a safe starting dose and dose escalation, when possible. 
* Animal toxicity studies : Acute toxicity testing, Repeat-dose toxicity testing, Long-term toxicity testing http://www.animalresearch.info/en/drug-development/safety-testing/
* Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics testing : Use for determinate clinical dosages, antibody activities (AUC, pharmacodynamics, biodistribution, ...), evaluation of the potential clinical effects

==Structure prediction==
The importance of antibodies in health care and the [[biotechnology]] industry demands knowledge of their structures at [[Image resolution|high resolution]]. This information is used for [[protein engineering]], modifying the antigen binding affinity, and identifying an epitope, of a given antibody. [[X-ray crystallography]] is one commonly used method for determining antibody structures. However, crystallizing an antibody is often laborious and time-consuming. Computational approaches provide a cheaper and faster alternative to crystallography, but their results are more equivocal, since they do not produce empirical structures.

==History==
{{see also|History of immunology}}

The first use of the term "antibody" occurred in a text by [[Paul Ehrlich]]. The term ''Antikörper'' (the German word for ''antibody'') appears in the conclusion of his article "Experimental Studies on Immunity", published in October 1891, which states that, "if two substances give rise to two different antikörper, then they themselves must be different".<ref name=Lindenmann>{{cite journal |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119531625/PDFSTART |author=Lindenmann, Jean |title=Origin of the Terms 'Antibody' and 'Antigen' |journal=Scand.

==[[Antibody mimetic]]==
Antibody mimetics are organic compounds that, like antibodies, can specifically bind antigens. They are usually artificial peptides or proteins with a molar mass of about 3 to 20 kDa. Nucleic acids and small molecules are sometimes considered antibody mimetics, but not artificial antibodies, antibody fragments and fusion proteins are composed from these. Common advantages over antibodies are better solubility, tissue penetration, stability towards heat and enzymes, and comparatively low production costs. Antibody mimetics such as the [[Affimer|Affimer]] and the [[DARPin|DARPin]] have being developed and commercialised as research, diagnostic and therapeutic agents. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Gebauer M, Skerra A |title=Engineered protein scaffolds as next-generation antibody therapeutics |journal=Curr Opin Chem Biol |volume= 13|issue= 3|pages= 245–255|date=June 2009 |pmid=19501012 |doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2009.04.627 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1367-5931(09)00068-4}}</ref>
