'''Dolphins''' are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic [[marine mammal]]s. They are an informal grouping within the order [[Cetacea]], excluding [[whale]]s and [[porpoise]]s, so to zoologists the grouping is [[paraphyletic]]. The dolphins comprise the extant families [[Delphinidae]] (the oceanic dolphins), [[Platanistidae]] (the Indian [[river dolphin]]s), [[Iniidae]] (the new world river dolphins), and [[Pontoporiidae]] (the [[brackish]] dolphins). There are 40 extant species of dolphins. Dolphins, alongside other [[cetaceans]], belong to the clade [[Cetartiodactyla]] with [[even-toed ungulate]]s, and their closest living relatives are the [[Hippopotamidae|hippopotamuses]], having diverged about 40 million years ago.

Dolphins range in size from the {{convert|1.7|m|ft}} long and {{convert|50|kg|lbs}} [[Maui's dolphin]] to the {{convert|9.5|m|ft}} and {{convert|10|MT|ST}} [[killer whale]]. Several species exhibit [[sexual dimorphism]], in that the males are larger than females. They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers. Though not quite as flexible as [[Pinniped|seal]]s, some dolphins can travel at {{convert|55.5|kph|mph}}. Dolphins use their conical shaped teeth to capture fast moving prey. They have well-developed hearing − their hearing, which is adapted for both air and water, is so well developed that some can survive even if they are blind. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or [[blubber]], under the skin to keep warm in the cold water.

Although dolphins are widespread, most species prefer the warmer waters of the tropic zones, but some, like the [[right whale dolphin]], prefer colder climates. Dolphins feed largely on fish and squid, but a few, like the killer whale, feed on large mammals, like seals. Male dolphins typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for a relatively long period of time. Dolphins produce a variety of vocalizations, usually in the form of clicks and whistles.

Dolphins are sometimes hunted in places like Japan, in an activity known as [[dolphin drive hunting]]. Besides drive hunting, they also face threats from [[bycatch]], habitat loss, and marine pollution. Dolphins have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. Dolphins occasionally feature in literature and film, as in the Warner Bros film [[Free Willy (film series)|Free Willy]]. Dolphins are sometimes kept in captivity and trained to perform tricks, but breeding success has been poor and the animals often die within a few months of capture. The most common dolphins kept are the killer whales and bottlenose dolphins.

==Etymology==
The name is originally from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|δελφίς}} (''delphís''), "dolphin",<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddelfi%2Fs δελφίς],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref> which was related to the Greek {{lang|grc|δελφύς}} (''delphus''), "womb".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddelfu%2Fs δελφύς], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref> The animal's name can therefore be interpreted as meaning "a 'fish' with a womb".<ref>{{cite book

{{anchor|Definition}}
The term 'dolphin' can be used to refer to, under the suborder [[Odontoceti]], all the species in the family [[Delphinidae]] (marine dolphins including killer and pilot whales) and the river dolphin families [[Iniidae]] (South American river dolphins), Pontoporiidae ([[La Plata dolphin]]), [[Lipotidae]] (Yangtze river dolphin) and [[Platanistidae]] (Ganges river dolphin and Indus river dolphin).<ref>{{cite book|title=Aquatic Life of the World|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=p5IiaOb5XxgC|page=652}}|accessdate=23 July 2013|date=1 November 2000|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-7170-7|page=652}}</ref><ref name="Walker2007"/>
This term has often been misused in the US, mainly in the fishing industry, where all small [[cetacea]]ns (dolphins and [[porpoise]]s) are considered porpoises, while the fish ''[[Dolphin fish|dorado]]'' is called dolphin fish.<ref name="Read1999">{{cite book|author=Andrew J.

Though the terms 'dolphin' and 'porpoise' are sometimes used interchangeably, porpoises are not considered dolphins and have different physical features such as a shorter beak and spade-shaped teeth; they also differ in their behavior. Porpoises belong to the family Phocoenidae and share a common ancestry with the Delphinidae.<ref name="NowacekNowacek2006"/>

A group of dolphins is called a "school" or a "pod". Male dolphins are called "bulls", females "cows" and young dolphins are called "calves".<ref>{{cite web |title=Style guide, animal names |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/writing/styleguide/animal.html |publisher=[[Reference.com|Dictionary.com]] |accessdate=November 4, 2007}}</ref>

==Evolution==
{{Main|Evolution of cetaceans}}
[[File:Ichthyosaur vs dolphin.svg|thumb|Dolphins display [[convergent evolution]] with fish and [[Ichthyosaur|aquatic reptiles]]]]

Dolphins are descendants of land-dwelling mammals of the [[artiodactyl]] [[order (biology)|order]] (even-toed ungulates). They are related to the ''[[Indohyus]]'', an extinct [[chevrotain|chevrotain-like]] ungulate, from which they split approximately 48 million years ago.<ref name=science_news>{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/12/071220220241.htm |title=Whales Descended From Tiny Deer-like Ancestors |accessdate=21 December 2007 |author=Northeastern Ohio Universities Colleges of Medicine and Pharmacy |publisher=ScienceDaily }}</ref><ref name="Ancestors_Tale">{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=The Ancestor's Tale, A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Life |titlelink=The Ancestor's Tale |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=2004 | isbn=0-618-00583-8}}</ref>
The primitive cetaceans, or [[archaeocetes]], first took to the sea approximately 49 million years ago and became fully aquatic by 5–10 million years later.<ref name=radiations>{{cite journal| last=Thewissen| first=J.

[[Archaeoceti]] is a suborder comprising ancient whales. These ancient whales are the predecessors of modern whales, stretching back to their first ancestor that spent their lives near (rarely in) the water. Likewise, the archaeocetes can be anywhere from near fully terrestrial, to semi-aquatic to fully aquatic, but what defines an archaeocete is the presence of visible legs or asymmetrical teeth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/mammal/cetacea/cetacean.html |title=Introduction to Cetacea: Archaeocetes: The Oldest Whales |publisher=University of Berkeley |accessdate=25 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Thewissen |first1=J.

==Biology==

===Anatomy===
[[File:Dolphin anatomy.png|thumb|300px|The anatomy of a dolphin showing its skeleton, major organs, tail and body shape]]
Dolphins have torpedo shaped bodies with non-flexible necks, limbs modified into flippers, non-existent external ear flaps, a tail fin, and bulbous heads. Dolphin skulls have small eye orbits, long snouts, and eyes placed on the sides of its head. Dolphins range in size from the {{convert|1.7|m|ft}} long and {{convert|50|kg|lbs}} [[Maui's dolphin]] to the {{convert|9.5|m|ft}} and {{convert|10|MT|ST}} [[killer whale]]. Overall, however, they tend to be dwarfed by other [[Cetartiodactyl]]s. Several species have female-biased sexual dimorphism, with the females being larger than the males.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.cetus.ucsd.edu/SIO133/PDF/Sexual%20Dimorphism.pdf |title=Sexual Dimorphism |author1=Katherine Ralls |author2=Sarah Mesnick |pages=1005–1011 |accessdate=29 August 2015}}</ref><ref name="Cetacean anatomy">{{cite web |url=http://acsonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ACS-Cetacean-Curriculum.pdf |title=Cetacean Curriculum&nbsp;– A teacher's guide to introducing and using whales, dolphins, & porpoises in the classroom  |date=28 November 2004 |publisher=American Cetacean Society |accessdate=20 December 2013 |quote=Sound production in cetaceans is a complex phenomenon not fully understood by scientists.}}</ref>

Dolphins have conical shape teeth, as apposed to their counterparts, [[porpoise]]'s, spade-shaped teeth. These conical teeth are used to catch swift prey such as fish, squid or large mammals, such as seal.<ref name="Cetacean anatomy"/>

Breathing involves expelling stale air from their [[blowhole (anatomy)|blowhole]], forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs, however this only occurs in the polar regions of the oceans. Dolphins have rather small, unidentifiable spouts.<ref name="Cetacean anatomy"/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Scholander |first=Per Fredrik |title=Experimental investigations on the respiratory function in diving mammals and birds |year=1940 |accessdate=29 August 2015| journal=Hvalraadets Skrifter | volume=22 |publisher=Norske Videnskaps-Akademi | location=Oslo}}</ref>

All dolphins have a thick layer of [[blubber]], thickness varying on climate. This blubber can help with buoyancy, protection to some extent as predators would have a hard time getting through a thick layer of fat, and energy for leaner times; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate. Calves, generally, are born with a thin layer of blubber, which develops at different paces depending on the habitat.<ref name="Cetacean anatomy"/><ref name="Dolphins"/>

Dolphins have a two-chambered stomach that is similar in structure to terrestrial carnivores. They have [[Fundic stomach|fundic]] and [[Pyloric stomach|pyloric]] chambers.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Stevens, C. Edward |author2=Hume, Ian D. |title=Comparative Physiology of the Vertebrate Digestive System |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=317 |year=1995}}</ref>

===Locomotion===

Dolphins have two flippers on the underside toward the head, a [[dorsal fin]] and a tail fin. These flippers contain four digits. Although dolphins do not possess fully developed hind limbs, some possess discrete rudimentary appendages, which may contain feet and digits. Dolphins are fast swimmers in comparison to seals who typically cruise at {{convert|9|–|28|kph|mph}}; the killer whale, in comparison, can travel at speeds up to {{convert|55.5|kph|mph}}. The fusing of the neck vertebrae, while increasing stability when swimming at high speeds, decreases flexibility, which means they are unable to turn their heads.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://yellowmagpie.com/beluga-whale/ |title=Beluga Whale: The White Melon-headed Creature Of The Cold |publisher=Yellowmagpie.com |date=27 June 2012 |accessdate=12 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whalesalive.org.au/aboutwhales.html |title=About Whales |publisher=Whalesalive.org.au |date=26 June 2009 |accessdate=12 August 2013}}</ref> [[River dolphin]]s, however, have non-fused neck vertebrae and are able to turn their head up to 90°.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://acsonline.org/fact-sheets/boto-amazon-river-dolphin/|title=Boto (Amazon river dolphin) ''Inia geoffrensis''|journal=American Cetacean Society|year=2002|accessdate=12 September 2015}}</ref>  Dolphins swim by moving their tail fin and rear body vertically, while their flippers are mainly used for steering.

===Senses===
[[File:Delfinekko.gif|thumb|right|[[Biosonar]] by cetaceans]]

The dolphin ear has specific adaptations to the [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] environment. In humans, the [[middle ear]] works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low [[Acoustic impedance|impedance]] and the [[cochlea]]r fluid's high impedance. In dolphins, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, dolphins receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The dolphin ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nummela, Sirpa |title=Sound transmission in archaic and modern whales: Anatomical adaptations for underwater hearing |journal=The Anatomical Record |volume=290 |issue=6 |pages=716–733 |year=2007 |accessdate=29 August 2015 |doi=10.1002/ar.20528 |last2=Thewissen |first2=J.G.M |last3=Bajpai |first3=Sunil |last4=Hussain |first4=Taseer |last5=Kumar |first5=Kishor |pmid=17516434}}</ref> Dolphins send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a [[melon (cetacean)|melon]].

The dolphin eye is relatively small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, the eyes of a dolphin are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When dolphins surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; they contain both [[rod cell|rod]] and [[cone cell|cone]] cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light, but they have far more rod cells than they do cone cells. Dolphins do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for color vision than most mammals.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Mass, Alla M. |author2=Supin, Alexander, Y.

They also have glands on the eyelids and [[corneal epithelium|outer corneal layer]] that act as protection for the cornea.<ref name="Dolphin senses"/>

The [[olfactory lobes]] are absent in dolphins, suggesting that they have no sense of smell.<ref name="Dolphin senses"/>

Dolphins are not thought to have a good sense of taste, as their taste buds are atrophied or missing altogether.  However, some have preferences between different kinds of fish, indicating some sort of attachment to taste.<ref name="Dolphin senses"/>

==Behavior==
[[File:Dolphins gesture language.jpg|thumb|A pod of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins in the [[Red Sea]]]]
{{See also|Cetacean surfacing behaviour}}
Dolphins are often regarded as one of Earth's most intelligent animals, though it is hard to say just how intelligent. Comparing species' relative intelligence is complicated by differences in sensory apparatus, response modes, and nature of cognition. Furthermore, the difficulty and expense of experimental work with large aquatic animals has so far prevented some tests and limited sample size and rigor in others. Compared to many other species, however, dolphin behavior has been studied extensively, both in captivity and in the wild. See [[cetacean intelligence]] for more details.

===Social behavior===
[[File:Dolphinsurfresize.jpg|thumb|Dolphins surfing at [[Snapper Rocks]], [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]]]
Dolphins are highly social animals, often living in pods of up to a dozen individuals, though pod sizes and structures vary greatly between species and locations. In places with a high abundance of food, pods can merge temporarily, forming a ''superpod''; such groupings may exceed 1,000 dolphins. Membership in pods is not rigid; interchange is common. Dolphins can, however, establish strong social bonds; they will stay with injured or ill individuals, even helping them to breathe by bringing them to the surface if needed.<ref>{{cite web

Dolphins communicate using a variety of clicks, whistle-like sounds and other vocalizations. Dolphins also use [[nonverbal communication]] by means of touch and [[Posture (psychology)|posturing]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Dolphin Mysteries: Unlocking the Secrets of Communication|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3gXV0lUeOV4C&printsec=frontcover|accessdate=16 March 2014|date=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-12112-4|page=83}}</ref>

Dolphins also display [[culture]], something long believed to be unique to humans (and possibly other [[primate]] species). In May 2005, a discovery in Australia found [[Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin]]s (''Tursiops aduncus'') teaching their young to use tools. They cover their [[snout]]s with [[sea sponge|sponges]] to protect them while foraging. This knowledge is mostly transferred by mothers to daughters, unlike [[simian]] primates, where knowledge is generally passed on to both sexes. Using sponges as mouth protection is a learned behavior.<ref>{{cite web

Dolphins engage in acts of aggression towards each other. The older a male dolphin is, the more likely his body is to be covered with bite scars. Male dolphins engage in acts of aggression apparently for the same reasons as humans: disputes between companions and competition for females. Acts of aggression can become so intense that targeted dolphins sometimes go into exile after losing a fight.

Male bottlenose dolphins have been known to engage in [[infanticide (zoology)|infanticide]]. Dolphins have also been known to kill [[porpoises]] for reasons which are not fully understood, as porpoises generally do not share the same diet as dolphins and are therefore not competitors for food supplies.<ref>{{cite web

===Feeding===
Various methods of feeding exist among and within species, some apparently exclusive to a single population. Fish and squid are the main food, but the false killer whale and the orca also feed on other marine mammals. Orcas on occasion also hunt whale species larger than themselves.<ref name="FactsDiet">[http://www.whalefacts.org/dolphins-diet/ Dolphin's diet]</ref>

One common feeding method is herding, where a pod squeezes a school of fish into a small volume, known as a [[bait ball]]. Individual members then take turns plowing through the ball, feeding on the stunned fish.<ref name=FactsDiet /> Coralling is a method where dolphins chase fish into shallow water to catch them more easily.<ref name=FactsDiet /> Orcas and bottlenose dolphins have also been known to drive their prey onto a beach to feed on it, a behaviour known as beach or strand feeding.<ref>{{cite web

===Vocalizations===
[[File:Dolphin1.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Spectrogram]] of dolphin vocalizations. Whistles, whines, and clicks are visible as upside down V's, horizontal striations, and vertical lines, respectively.]]

Dolphins are capable of making a broad range of sounds using nasal airsacs located just below the blowhole. Roughly three categories of sounds can be identified: [[frequency modulated]] whistles, burst-pulsed sounds and clicks. Dolphins communicate with whistle-like sounds produced by vibrating connective tissue, similar to the way human vocal cords function,<ref>{{cite web |last= Viegas |first= Jennifer |title = Dolphins Talk Like Humans |work = Discovery News |year = 2011 |url = http://news.discovery.com/animals/dolphin-talk-communication-humans-110906.html |accessdate = September 19, 2011}}</ref> and through burst-pulsed sounds, though the nature and extent of that ability is not known. The clicks are directional and are for echolocation, often occurring in a short series called a click train. The click rate increases when approaching an object of interest. Dolphin echolocation clicks are amongst the [[Whale sound|loudest sounds made by marine animals]].<ref>{{Cite book

Bottlenose dolphins have been found to have signature whistles, a whistle that is unique to a specific individual. These whistles are used in order for dolphins to communicate with one another by identifying an individual. It can be seen as the dolphin equivalent of a [[name]] for humans.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23410137 |title=Dolphins 'call each other by name' |date=July 22, 2013 | work=BBC News}}</ref> These signature whistles are developed during a dolphin's first year; it continues to maintain the same sound throughout its lifetime.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Janik|first=Vincent|author2=Laela Sayigh|title=Communication in bottlenose dolphins: 50 years of signature whistle research|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology|date=7 May 2013|volume=199|issue=6|pages=479–489|doi=10.1007/s00359-013-0817-7|accessdate=30 January 2014}}</ref> In order to obtain each individual whistle sound, dolphins undergo vocal production learning. This consists of an experience with other dolphins that modifies the signal structure of an existing whistle sound. An auditory experience influences the whistle development of each dolphin. Dolphins are able to communicate to one another by addressing another dolphin through mimicking their whistle. The signature whistle of a male bottlenose dolphin tends to be similar to that of their mother, while the signature whistle of a female bottlenose dolphin tends to be more unique.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whoi.edu/science/B/people/kamaral/marinemammalacoustics.html |title=Marine Mammal vocalizations: language or behavior? |date=August 24, 2013}}</ref> Bottlenose dolphins have a strong memory when it comes to these signature whistles, as they are able to relate to a signature whistle of an individual they have not encountered for over twenty years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.uchicago.edu/article/2013/08/06/dolphins-keep-lifelong-social-memories-longest-non-human-species |title=Dolphins keep lifelong social memories, longest in a non-human species |date=August 24, 2013}}</ref> Research done on signature whistle usage by other dolphin species is relatively limited.

Because dolphins are generally associated in groups, communication is necessary. Signal masking is when other similar sounds (conspecific sounds) interfere with the original acoustic sound.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Quick|first=Nicola|author2=Vincent Janik|title=Whistle Rates of Wild Bottlenose Dolphins (Tursiops truncatus): Influences of Group Size and Behavior|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|date=2008|volume=122|issue=3|pages=305–311|doi=10.1037/0735-7036.122.3.305|accessdate=27 January 2014}}</ref> In larger groups, individual whistle sounds are less prominent. Dolphins tend to travel in pods, upon which there are groups of dolphins that range from a few to many. Although they are traveling in these pods, the dolphins do not necessarily swim right next to each other. Rather, they swim within the same general vicinity. In order to prevent losing one of their pod members, there are higher whistle rates. Because their group members were spread out, this was done in order to continue traveling together.

===Jumping and playing===

[[Brain size]] was previously considered a major indicator of the intelligence of an animal. Since most of the brain is used for maintaining bodily functions, greater ratios of brain to body mass may increase the amount of brain mass available for more complex cognitive tasks. [[Allometric]] analysis indicates that mammalian brain size scales at approximately the ⅔ or ¾ exponent of the body mass.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pages.ucsd.edu/~jmoore/courses/allometry/allometry.html |title=Allometry |first=Jim |last=Moore| publisher=University of California San Diego |accessdate=9 August 2015}}</ref> Comparison of a particular animal's brain size with the expected brain size based on such allometric analysis provides an [[encephalization quotient]] that can be used as another indication of animal intelligence. [[Killer whale]]s have the second largest brain mass of any animal on earth, next to the [[sperm whale]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2010-03-06/news/os-seaworld-killer-whale-brains-20100302_1_killer-whales-orcas-dolphin-or-porpoise|title=How smart are they?|journal=Orlando Sentinel|date=March 7, 2010}}</ref> The [[brain to body mass ratio]] in some is second only to humans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/news-blog/are-whales-smarter-than-we-are/ |author=Fields, R.

[[Self-awareness]] is seen, by some, to be a sign of highly developed, abstract thinking. Self-awareness, though not well-defined scientifically, is believed to be the precursor to more advanced processes like [[metacognition|meta-cognitive reasoning]] (thinking about thinking) that are typical of humans. Research in this field has suggested that cetaceans, among others, possess self-awareness.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.livescience.com/4272-elephant-awareness-mirrors-humans.html | title=Elephant Self-Awareness Mirrors Humans |publisher=Live Science |date=30 October 2006 |accessdate=29 August 2015}}</ref>
The most widely used test for self-awareness in animals is the [[mirror test]] in which a temporary dye is placed on an animal's body, and the animal is then presented with a mirror; they then see if the animal shows signs of self-recognition.<ref name="Mirror test">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/01/science/brainy-dolphins-pass-the-human-mirror-test.html |title=Mirror test |author=Derr, Mark |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=3 August 2015}}</ref>

Some disagree with these findings, arguing that the results of these tests are open to human interpretation and susceptible to the [[Clever Hans]] effect. This test is much less definitive than when used for primates, because primates can touch the mark or the mirror, while cetaceans cannot, making their alleged self-recognition behavior less certain. Skeptics argue that behaviors that are said to identify self-awareness resemble existing social behaviors, and so researchers could be misinterpreting self-awareness for social responses to another individual. The researchers counter-argue that the behaviors shown are evidence of self-awareness, as they are very different from normal responses to another individual. Whereas apes can merely touch the mark on themselves with their fingers, cetaceans show less definitive behavior of self-awareness; they can only twist and turn themselves to observe the mark.<ref name="Mirror test"/>

In 1995, Marten and Psarakos used television to test dolphin self-awareness.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marten|first1=Ken|last2=Psarakos|first2=Suchi|title=Using Self-View Television to Distinguish between Self-Examination and Social Behavior in the Bottlenose Dolphin (Tursiops truncatus)|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|volume=4|number=2|date=June 1995}}</ref> They showed dolphins real-time footage of themselves, recorded footage, and another dolphin. They concluded that their evidence suggested self-awareness rather than social behavior. While this particular study has not been repeated since then, dolphins have since passed the mirror test.<ref name="Mirror test"/>

===Sleeping===
[[File:דולפין ישן.svg|right|thumb|Sleeping dolphin in captivity: a tail kick reflex keeps the dolphin's blowhole above the water]]

Generally, dolphins sleep with only one brain [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]] in [[slow-wave sleep]] at a time, thus maintaining enough consciousness to breathe and to watch for possible predators and other threats. Earlier sleep stages can occur simultaneously in both hemispheres.<ref>

In captivity, dolphins seemingly enter a fully asleep state where both eyes are closed and there is no response to mild external stimuli.

[[Dolphin safe label]]s attempt to reassure consumers that fish and other marine products have been caught in a dolphin-friendly way. The earliest campaigns with "Dolphin safe" labels were initiated in the 1980s as a result of cooperation between marine activists and the major tuna companies, and involved decreasing incidental dolphin kills by up to 50% by changing the type of nets used to catch tuna. The dolphins are netted only while fishermen are in pursuit of smaller tuna. Albacore are not netted this way, making albacore the only truly dolphin-safe tuna.<ref>{{cite web|title=Time Of Truth For US Dolphin Safe Logos|url=http://www.atuna.com/NewsArchive/ViewArticle.asp?ID=12719|website=atuna|accessdate=29 August 2015}}</ref>

Dolphins and other smaller cetaceans are also hunted in an activity known as dolphin drive hunting. This is accomplished by driving a pod together with boats and usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the ocean with other boats or nets. Dolphins are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the [[Solomon Islands]], the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Peru]], and [[Japan]], the most well-known practitioner of this method. By numbers, dolphins are mostly hunted for their [[whale meat|meat]], though some end up in [[dolphinarium]]s. Despite the controversial nature of the hunt resulting in international criticism, and the possible health risk that the often polluted meat causes, thousands of dolphins are caught in drive hunts each year.

Dolphins have long played a role in human culture. Dolphins are sometimes used as symbols, for instance in heraldry. When heraldry developed in the [[Middle Ages]], not much was known about the biology of the dolphin and it was often depicted as a sort of fish. Traditionally, the stylised dolphins in heraldry still may take after this notion, sometimes showing the dolphin skin covered with [[fish scale]]s.

Dolphins are present in the [[coat of arms of Anguilla]] and the [[coat of arms of Romania]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Brief Romanian Military History|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=2007|page=91|last=Hentea|first=Călin|location=Maryland, USA|isbn=978-0-8108-5820-6}}</ref> and the [[coat of arms of Barbados]] has a dolphin [[supporter]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Barbados: Just Beyond Your Imagination|last=Ali|first=Arif|year=1996|page=16|isbn=978-1-870518-54-3|publisher=Hansib Publications|location=Hertford, UK}}</ref> A well-known historical example of a dolphin in heraldry, was the arms for the [[Dauphin of France]], the heir to the former throne of France.

In [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]], they were seen invariably as helpers of humankind. Dolphins also seem to have been important to the [[Minoans]], judging by artistic evidence from the ruined palace at [[Knossos]]. Dolphins are common in [[Greek mythology]], and many coins from [[ancient Greece]] have been found which feature a man, a boy or a deity riding on the back of a dolphin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dougsmith.ancients.info/feac50tar.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208015112/http://dougsmith.ancients.info/feac50tar.html |archivedate=2007-02-08 |title=Taras |accessdate=3 October 2010}}</ref> The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] welcomed dolphins; spotting dolphins riding in a ship's wake was considered a good omen.<ref>Eyers, Jonathan (2011). ''Don't Shoot the Albatross!: Nautical Myths and Superstitions''. A&C Black, London, UK. ISBN 978-1-4081-3131-2.</ref>  In both ancient and later art, [[Cupid]] is often shown [[Cupid#Cupid and dolphins|riding a dolphin]]. A dolphin rescued the poet [[Arion]] from drowning and carried him safe to land, at [[Cape Matapan]], a promontory forming the southernmost point of the [[Peloponnesus]]. There was a temple to [[Poseidon]] and a statue of Arion riding the dolphin.<ref>[[Herodotus]] I.23; [[Thucydides]] I.128, 133; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] iii.25, 4</ref>

The Greeks reimagined the [[Phoenicia]]n god [[Melqart]] as Melikertês ([[Melicertes]]) and made him the son of [[Athamas]] and [[Ino (Greek mythology)|Ino]]. He drowned but was transfigured as the marine deity Palaemon, while his mother became [[Leucothea]]. (''cf'' [[Ino (Greek mythology)|Ino]].) At Corinth, he was so closely connected with the cult of Poseidon that the [[Isthmian Games]], originally instituted in [[Poseidon]]'s honor, came to be looked upon as the funeral games of [[Melicertes]]. [[Phalanthus of Tarentum|Phalanthus]] was another legendary character brought safely to shore (in Italy) on the back of a dolphin, according to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].

[[Dionysus]] was once captured by [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[pirate]]s who mistook him for a wealthy prince they could ransom. After the ship set sail Dionysus invoked his divine powers, causing vines to overgrow the ship where the mast and sails had been.  He turned the oars into serpents, so terrifying the sailors that they jumped overboard, but Dionysus took pity on them and [[shapeshifting|transformed]] them into dolphins so that they would spend their lives providing help for those in need. Dolphins were also the messengers of [[Poseidon]] and sometimes did errands for him as well. Dolphins were sacred to both [[Aphrodite]] and [[Apollo]].

In [[Hindu mythology]] the [[Ganges River Dolphin]] is associated with [[Ganga in Hinduism|Ganga]], the deity of the [[Ganges]] river. The dolphin is said to be among the creatures which heralded the goddess' descent from the heavens and her mount, the [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|Makara]], is sometimes depicted as a dolphin.<ref>{{cite book|author=Vijay Singh|title=The River Goddess|location=London|year=1994|isbn=978-1-85103-195-5}}</ref>

The [[Boto]], a species of [[river dolphin]] that resides in the [[Amazon River]], are believed to be shapeshifters, or ''[[encantado]]s'', who are capable of having children with human women.

===In captivity===

====Species====
{{refimprove section|date=October 2015}}
[[File:Sea World1.jpg|thumb|SeaWorld show featuring [[bottlenose dolphin]]s and [[pilot whale]]s]]
The renewed popularity of dolphins in the 1960s resulted in the appearance of many [[dolphinarium|dolphinaria]] around the world, making dolphins accessible to the public. Criticism and [[animal welfare]] laws forced many to close, although hundreds still exist around the world. In the [[United States]], the best known are the [[SeaWorld]] [[marine mammal park]]s.
In the Middle East the best known are [[Dolphin Bay]] at [[Atlantis, The Palm]] and the [[Dubai Dolphinarium]]. 

[[File:Long-finned Pilot Whale (8793172995).jpg|thumb|[[SeaWorld San Diego|SeaWorld]] [[Pilot Whale]] with trainers]]
Various species of dolphins are kept in captivity. These small cetaceans are more often than not kept in theme parks, such as [[SeaWorld]], commonly known as a [[dolphinarium]]. [[Bottlenose Dolphin]]s are the most common species of dolphin kept in dolphinariums as they are relatively easy to train, have a long lifespan in captivity and have a friendly appearance. Hundreds if not thousands of Bottlenose Dolphins live in captivity across the world, though exact numbers are hard to determine. Other species kept in captivity are [[Atlantic Spotted Dolphin|Spotted Dolphins]], [[False Killer Whale]]s and [[Common Dolphin]]s, [[Commerson's Dolphin]]s, as well as [[Rough-toothed Dolphin]]s, but all in much lower numbers than the Bottlenose Dolphin. There are also fewer than ten [[Pilot Whale]]s, [[Amazon River Dolphin]]s, [[Risso's Dolphin]]s, [[Spinner Dolphin]]s, or [[Tucuxi]] in captivity. Two unusual and very rare [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] dolphins, known as [[Wolphins]], are kept at the Sea Life Park in [[Hawaii]], which is a cross between a Bottlenose Dolphin and a [[False Killer Whale]]. Also, two [[Common dolphin|Common]]/Bottlenose hybrids reside in captivity: one at [[Discovery Cove]] and the other at [[SeaWorld San Diego]]. 

[[Killer whale]]s are well known for their performances in shows, but the number of Orcas kept in captivity is very small, especially when compared to the number of bottlenose dolphins, with only 44 [[List of captive orcas|captive killer whales]] being held in aquaria as of 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orcahome.de/orcastat.htm| title=Orcas in Captivity - A look at killer whales in aquariums and parks]|date=23 November 2009|accessdate=6 September 2015}}</ref> The killer whale's [[animal intelligence|intelligence]], trainability, striking appearance, playfulness in captivity and sheer size have made it a popular exhibit at aquaria and aquatic theme parks. From 1976 to 1997, 55 whales were taken from the wild in Iceland, 19 from Japan, and three from Argentina. These figures exclude animals that died during capture. Live captures fell dramatically in the 1990s, and by 1999, about 40% of the 48 animals on display in the world were captive-born.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|pp=43–44}}

Organizations such as the [[Mote Marine Laboratory]] rescue and [[Wildlife rehabilitation|rehabilitate]] sick, wounded, stranded or orphaned dolphins while others, such as the [[Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society]] and [[Hong Kong Dolphin Conservation Society]], work on dolphin conservation and welfare. [[India]] has declared the dolphin as its national aquatic animal in an attempt to protect the [[endangered species|endangered]] [[Ganges River Dolphin]]. The [[Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary]] has been created in the [[Ganges]] river for the protection of the animals.

====Controversy====
{{Main|Captive killer whales|Killer whale attacks on humans}}
[[File:2009-Seaworld-Shamu.jpg|thumb|Shamu the killer whale, 2009, with a collapsed dorsal fin]]

Organizations such as [[World Animal Protection]] and the [[Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society]] campaign against the practice of keeping them in captivity. In captivity, they often develop pathologies, such as the [[dorsal fin]] collapse seen in 60–90% of male killer whales. Captives have vastly reduced life expectancies, on average only living into their 20s, although there are examples of killer whales living longer, including several over 30 years old, and two captive orcas, Corky II and Lolita, are in their mid-40s. In the wild, females who survive infancy live 46 years on average, and up to 70–80 years in rare cases. Wild males who survive infancy live 31 years on average, and up to 50–60 years.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rose, N.

Critics claim captive life is stressful due to these factors and the requirement to perform circus tricks that are not part of wild killer whale behavior.

Fatal attacks from other species are less common, but there is a registered occurrence off the coast of [[Brazil]] in 1994, when a man died after being attacked by a [[bottlenose dolphin]] named [[Tião]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Wong |first=David |url=http://www.cracked.com/article_15853_the-6-cutest-animals-that-can-still-destroy-you.html |title=The 6 Cutest Animals That Can Still Destroy You |publisher=Cracked.com |accessdate=2011-07-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.science-frontiers.com/sf101/sf101b07.htm |title=Male Dolphin Kills Man |publisher=Science-frontiers.com |date= Sep–Oct 1995|accessdate=2011-07-25}}</ref> [[Tião]] had suffered harassment by human visitors, including attempts to stick ice cream sticks down her [[blowhole (anatomy)|blowhole]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/south/series1/lone-dolphins.shtml |title=LONE DOLPHINS – FRIEND OR FOE? |publisher=BBC |date=2002-09-09 |accessdate=2012-02-05}}</ref> Non-fatal incidents occur more frequently, both in the wild and in captivity.

While dolphin attacks occur far less frequently than attacks by other sea animals, such as [[shark attack|sharks]], some scientists are worried about the careless programs of human-dolphin interaction. Dr. Andrew J. Read, a biologist at the Duke University Marine Laboratory who studies dolphin attacks, points out that dolphins are large and wild predators, so people should be more careful when they interact with them.<ref name="fishingnj.org"/>

Several scientists who have researched dolphin behaviour have proposed that dolphins' unusually high intelligence in comparison to other animals means that dolphins should be seen as ''non-human persons'' who should have their own specific rights and that it is [[morality|morally]] unacceptable to keep them captive for entertainment purposes or to kill them either intentionally for consumption or unintentionally as by-catch.<ref>{{Cite book

====Military====

A military dolphin is a dolphin trained for military uses. A number of militaries have employed dolphins for various purposes from finding mines to rescuing lost or trapped humans. The [[military dolphins|military use of dolphins]], however, drew scrutiny during the Vietnam War when rumors circulated that the [[United States Navy]] was training dolphins to kill Vietnamese divers.<ref>{{cite web

Dolphins are still being trained by the United States Navy for other tasks as part of the [[U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program]]. The Russian military is believed to have closed its marine mammal program in the early 1990s. In 2000 the press reported that dolphins trained to kill by the [[Soviet Navy]] had been sold to [[Iran]].<ref>{{Cite news

====Therapy====
Dolphins are an increasingly popular choice of [[animal-assisted therapy]] for psychological problems and developmental disabilities. For example, a 2005 study found dolphins an effective treatment for mild to moderate [[clinical depression|depression]].<ref>{{cite journal

====Cuisine====
[[File:Dolphin Sashimi.jpg|thumb|Plate of dolphin [[sashimi]]]]

Dolphin meat is dense and such a dark shade of red as to appear black. Fat is located in a layer of [[blubber]] between the meat and the skin. When dolphin meat is eaten in Japan, it is often cut into thin strips and eaten raw as ''[[sashimi]]'', garnished with onion and either [[horseradish]] or grated [[garlic]], much as with ''sashimi'' of [[whale meat|whale]] or [[horse meat]] (''basashi''). When cooked, dolphin meat is cut into bite-size cubes and then batter-fried or simmered in a ''[[miso]]'' sauce with vegetables. Cooked dolphin meat has a flavor very similar to [[beef liver]].<ref>{{cite web|script-title=ja:イルカの味噌根菜煮 |language=Japanese|trans_title= Dolphin in Miso Vegetable Stew |url= http://cookpad.com/recipe/1073593 |work= Cookpad |year=2010 |accessdate= 16 May 2011}}</ref> Dolphin meat is high in mercury, and may pose a health danger to humans when consumed.<ref>
