'''Carson City''', officially the '''Consolidated Municipality of Carson City''', is an [[Independent city (United States)|independent city]] and the capital of the state of [[Nevada]], named after the [[mountain man]] [[Kit Carson]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 55,274.<ref name="QF">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/32/32510.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=September 23, 2013}}</ref> The majority of the population of the town lives in [[Eagle Valley (Nevada)|Eagle Valley]], on the eastern edge of the [[Carson Range]], a branch of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]. Carson City is about {{convert|30|mi|-1}} south of [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] and originated as a stopover for California bound emigrants, but developed into a city with the [[Comstock Lode]], a silver strike in the mountains to the northeast. The city has served as the capital of Nevada since statehood in 1864 and for much of its history was a hub for the [[Virginia and Truckee Railroad]], although the tracks were removed in the 1950s. Prior to 1969, Carson City was also the [[county seat]] of [[Ormsby County, Nevada|Ormsby County]]. In 1969, the county was abolished, and its territory was merged with Carson City to form the Consolidated Municipality of Carson City.<ref name=consolidatedmunicipality>{{cite web

Like other independent cities<!-- Carson City is an "independent city", NOT the more common "consolidated city-county". While counties legally survive in the latter (Nashville-Davidson County, TN, or even New Orleans-Orleans Parish, LA although Orleans Parish has *never* been fully independent of NOLA), Ormsby County was completely abolished by its consolidation into Carson City. Thus, Carson City is like Baltimore, St. Louis and the 38 cities of Virginia, all legally independent of ANY county. --> in the United States, it is treated as a [[county-equivalent]] for census purposes.

==History==
[[Image:Abraham Curry.png|thumb|125px|left|Abraham Curry]]
[[Image:Carson City, 1877.jpg|thumb|Illustration of Carson City in 1877]]
The first European Americans to arrive in what is known as Eagle Valley were [[John C. Fremont]] and his exploration party in January 1843.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/nevada/carson.htm|title=National Park Service: Three Historic Cities|publisher=Travel Nevada.com|accessdate=June 2, 2010}}</ref>  Fremont named the river flowing through the valley [[Carson River]] in honor of [[Kit Carson|Christopher "Kit" Carson]], the [[mountain man]] and scout he had hired for his expedition. Prior to the Fremont expedition, the [[Washoe people]] inhabited the valley and surrounding areas. Settlers named the area Washoe in reference to the tribe.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bayer|first=C.W.|title=Profits, plots & lynching; the creation of Nevada Territory|year=1995|publisher=Purple Mountain Press|location=Carson, City NV|isbn=0-9628890-3-2|page=2}}</ref>

By 1851 the [[Eagle Station]] ranch located along the Carson River served as a trading post and stopover for travelers on the [[California Trail]]'s [[Carson Branch]] which ran through [[Eagle Valley (Nevada)|Eagle Valley]]. The valley and trading post received their name from a [[bald eagle]] that was hunted and killed by one of the early settlers and was featured on a wall inside the post.

As the area was part of the [[Utah Territory]], it was governed from Salt Lake City, where the territorial government was headquartered. Early settlers bristled at the control exerted by Mormon-influenced officials and desired the creation of the Nevada territory. A vigilante group of influential settlers, headed by Abraham Curry, sought a site for a capital city for the envisioned territory.<ref>{{cite book|last=Oldham|first=Willa|title=Carson City: Nevada’s Capital City|year=1991|publisher=Nevada State Museum|location=Carson City, NV|asin=B0006QSL8Q|page=5}}</ref>  In 1858, [[Abraham Curry]] bought Eagle Station and thereafter renamed the settlement Carson City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitcarsoncity.com/history/|title=Carson City Living History|author=Carson City website|accessdate=2013-01-17}}</ref>{{Failed verification|talk=Who named Carson City?|date=March 2015}}  As Curry and several other partners had Eagle Valley surveyed for development. Curry had decided for himself that Carson City would someday serve as the capital city and left a {{convert|10|acre|m2|adj=on}} plot open in the center of town for a future capitol building.

Following the discovery of gold and silver in 1859 on the nearby [[Comstock Lode]], Carson City's population began to rise. Curry built the Warm Springs Hotel a mile to the east of the center of town. When the territorial governor James W. Nye traveled to Nevada, he chose Carson City as the territorial capital, influenced by Carson City lawyer William Stewart, who escorted him from San Francisco to Nevada.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hauck|first=Eldon|title=American Capitols|year=1991|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc.|location=Jefferson, NC|page=138}}</ref> As such, Carson City bested [[Virginia City, Nevada|Virginia City]] and American Flat. Curry loaned the Warm Springs Hotel to the territorial Legislature as a meeting hall. The Legislature named Carson City to be the seat of [[Ormsby County, Nevada|Ormsby County]] and selected the hotel as the territorial prison with Curry serving as its first warden. Today the property still serves as part of the state prison.

When Nevada became a state in 1864 during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Carson City was confirmed as Nevada's permanent capital. Carson City's development was no longer dependent on the mining industry and instead became a thriving commercial center. The [[Virginia & Truckee Railroad]] was built between Virginia City and Carson City. A [[Log Flume|wooden flume]] was also built from the Sierra Nevadas into Carson City. The current capitol building was constructed from 1870 to 1871. The [[United States Mint]] operated a [[Carson City Mint|branch mint]] in Carson City between the years 1870 and 1893, which struck gold and silver coins. People came from China during that time, many of them to work on the railroad. Some of them owned businesses and taught school. By 1880, almost a thousand Chinese people, "one for every five Caucasians," lived in Carson City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nevadaappeal.com/article/20030925/OPINION/309250201/ |title=Dedicated to Carson's Chinese history |author=Kelli Du Fresne |publisher=Nevada Appeal |accessdate=September 7, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120407002436/http://www.nevadaappeal.com/article/20030925/OPINION/309250201/ |archivedate=7 April 2012 }}</ref>

Carson City's population and transportation traffic decreased when the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] built a line through [[Donner Pass]], too far to the north to benefit Carson City. The city was slightly revitalized with the mining booms in [[Tonopah, Nevada|Tonopah]] and [[Goldfield, Nevada|Goldfield]]. The US federal building (now renamed the [[Paul Laxalt]] Building) was completed in 1890 as was the [[Stewart Indian School]]. Carson City resigned itself to small city status, advertising itself as "America's smallest capital."  The city slowly grew; by 1960 it had reached its 1880, boom-time population.

===20th-century revitalization and growth===
As early as the late 1940s, discussions began about merging Ormsby County and Carson City.  By this time, the county was little more than Carson City and a few hamlets to the west.  However, the effort never got beyond the planning stages until 1966, when a statewide referendum formally approved the merger.  The required constitutional amendment was passed in 1968.  On April 1, 1969; Ormsby County and Carson City officially merged as the Consolidated Municipality of Carson City.<ref name=consolidatedmunicipality/> With this consolidation, Carson City absorbed former town sites such as [[Empire City, Nevada|Empire City]], which had grown up in the 1860s as a milling center along the Carson River and current [[US 50 (NV)|US 50]]. Carson City could now advertise itself as one of America's largest state capitals with its {{convert|146|sqmi|km2}} of city limits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carson.org/Index.aspx?page=140|title=Carson City: History|author=Carson City Government|accessdate=February 6, 2010}}</ref>

In 1991, the city adopted a downtown master plan, specifying that no building within {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=off}} of the capitol would surpass it in height. This plan effectively prohibited future high-rise development in the center of downtown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/?id=carsoncity-nv-usa |title=About Carson City |author=Staff Writer |publisher=Emporis |accessdate=February 6, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20121023125134/http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/?id=carsoncity-nv-usa |archivedate=23 October 2012 }}</ref>  The [[Ormsby House]] is currently the tallest building in downtown Carson City, at a height of 117 feet. The structure was completed in 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/city/carsoncity-nv-usa/all-buildings/highrise |title=Carson City High Rise Buildings |publisher=Emporis.com |accessdate=2013-01-17}}</ref>

In an attempt to either make proposed spent nuclear fuel storage facility at [[Yucca Mountain]] prohibitively expensive (by raising property tax rates to the maximum allowed) or to allow the state to collect the potential federal payments of property taxes on the facility, the state government in 1987 carved Yucca Mountain out of [[Nye County, Nevada|Nye County]] and created a new county with no residents out of the area surrounding Yucca called [[Bullfrog County, Nevada|Bullfrog County]]. Carson City became the county seat of Bullfrog County, even though it is not located in Bullfrog County and is more than {{convert|100|mi|km}} from Yucca Mountain.  A state judge found the process unconstitutional in 1989, and Bullfrog County's territory was retroceded to Nye County.

==Climate==
Carson City features a [[semi-arid climate]]<ref>http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-West/Carson-City-Geography-and-Climate.html</ref> with cool but not inordinately cold winters and hot summers. The city is situated in a high desert river valley approximately {{convert|4802|ft|m}} above sea level. There are four fairly distinct seasons, all of which are relatively mild compared to many parts of the country and to what one may expect given its elevation. Winters see typically light to moderate snowfall, with a median of {{convert|8.9|in|cm|0}}.<ref name = NCDC /> Most precipitation occurs in winter and spring, with summer and fall being fairly dry, drier than neighboring California. There are 37 days of {{convert|90|°F|0}}+ highs annually,<ref name = NCDC /> with {{convert|100|°F|0}}+ temperatures occurring in some years.

The Carson River flows from Douglas County through the southwestern edge of Carson City.

==Transportation==
[[Image:US395SouthofCarsonCity.jpg|thumb|left|Looking south on [[U.S. Route 395 in Nevada|US 395]], just south of [[U.S. Route 50 in Nevada|US 50]] in [[Douglas County, Nevada|Douglas County]] near Carson City]]
There are two highways in the city [[US Route 395]] and [[US Route 50 in Nevada|US Route 50]].<ref name=cvb>{{cite web|title=Getting here|url=http://www.visitcarsoncity.com/aboutus/gettinghere.php|work=Carson City Convention and Visitors Bureau|accessdate=August 23, 2011}}</ref>  Carson City is home to one under-construction freeway [[Interstate 580 (Nevada)|Interstate 580]]. Phase 1 of the Carson City Freeway Project from US 395, just north of the city, to US 50 was completed in February 2006 and Phase 2A, extending from Rt. 50 to Fairview Drive, was officially opened on September 24, 2009. Phase 2B, Fairview Drive to Rt. 50, awaits funding<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccfreeway.com|title=Carson City Freeway|author=Staff Writer|publisher=Carson City Freeway}}</ref> and, according to Director Martinovich at NDOT, completion is anticipated for the fall of 2017<ref>Meeting w/Dir. Martinovich, 1:30pm on 4/19/12 at her NDOT office with Steve Waclo, Carson City.</ref> Prior to 2012, Carson City was one of only five state capitals not directly served by an Interstate highway; the city lost this distinction when I-580 was extended into the city limits.

Carson City's first modern bus system, Jump Around Carson, or JAC, opened to the public. JAC uses a smaller urban bus that is ideal for Carson City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carson.org/Index.aspx?page=1436|title=Jump Around Carson|author=Staff Writer|publisher=Jump Around Carson|accessdate=2013-01-17}}</ref> However, there is virtually no ground public transportation to other destinations. Passenger trains haven't served Carson City since 1950, when the [[Virginia and Truckee Railroad]] was shut down. [[Greyhound Lines]] stopped their bus services to the town in 2006 and [[Amtrak]] discontinued their connecting thruway bus to [[Sacramento (California)|Sacramento]] in 2008. There is now only a limited Monday – Friday RTC bus service<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtcwashoe.com/Schedules/BusBook/INTERCITY.pdf |title= |publisher= |accessdate=2013-12-28}}</ref> to [[Reno]] which is still served by both Greyhound and Amtrak.

Carson City is also served by the [[Carson Airport]], which is a regional airport in the northern part of the city. [[Reno-Tahoe International Airport]], which is {{convert|28|mi|km}} away, handles domestic commercial flights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carsoncity-airport.com/Home.shtml |title=Carson City Airport |last=Staff Writer |publisher=Carson City Airport |accessdate=March 6, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100614072036/http://www.carsoncity-airport.com:80/Home.shtml |archivedate=14 June 2010 }}</ref>
