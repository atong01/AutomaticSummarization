Francis I generally opposed a general council due to partial support of the Protestant cause within France, and in 1533 he further complicated matters when suggesting a general council to include both Catholic and Protestant rulers of Europe that would devise a compromise between the two theological systems. This proposal met the opposition of the Pope for it gave recognition to Protestants and also elevated the secular Princes of Europe above the clergy on church matters. Faced with a Turkish attack, Charles held the support of the Protestant German rulers, all of whom delayed the opening of the Council of Trent.<extension extension_name='ref'>Jedin 7982</extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Occasion, sessions, and attendance</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Council of Trent by Pasquale Cati.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>The Council, depicted by<space/><link><target>Pasquale Cati</target></link><space/>(Cati da Iesi)</part></link>In reply to the<space/><link><target>Papal bull</target></link><space/><italics><link><target>Exsurge Domine</target></link></italics><space/>of<space/><link><target>Pope Leo X</target></link><space/>(1520),<space/><link><target>Martin Luther</target></link><space/>burned the document and appealed for a general council.

After<space/><link><target>Pope Pius II</target></link>, in his bull<space/><italics><link><target>Execrabilis</target></link></italics><space/>(1460) and his reply to the University of Cologne (1463), set aside the theory of the supremacy of general councils laid down by the<space/><link><target>Council of Constance</target></link>.<space/></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Pope Paul III</target></link><space/>(153449), seeing that the<space/><link><target>Protestant Reformation</target></link><space/>was no longer confined to a few preachers, but had won over various princes, particularly in Germany, to its ideas, desired a council. Yet when he proposed the idea to his<space/><link><target>Cardinal (Catholicism)</target><part>cardinals</part></link>, it was almost unanimously opposed. Nonetheless, he sent<space/><link><target>nuncio</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>throughout Europe to propose the idea. Paul III issued a decree for a general council to be held in Mantua, Italy, to begin on 23 May 1537. Martin Luther wrote the<space/><link><target>Smalcald Articles</target></link><space/>in preparation for the general council. The Smalcald Articles were designed to sharply define where the Lutherans could and could not compromise. The council was ordered by the Emperor and Pope Paul III to convene in<space/><link><target>Mantua</target></link><space/>on 23 May 1537. It failed to convene after another war broke out between France and Charles V, resulting in a non-attendance of French<space/><link><target>prelate</target><trail>s</trail></link>. Protestants, just defeated by Charles V, refused to attend as well. Financial difficulties in Mantua led the Pope in the autumn of 1537 to move the council to<space/><link><target>Vicenza</target></link>, where participation was poor. The Council was postponed indefinitely on 21 May 1539. Pope Paul III then initiated several internal Church reforms while Emperor Charles V convened with Protestants at an imperial diet in<space/><link><target>Regensburg</target></link>, to reconcile differences.

It closed with a series of ritual acclamations honouring the reigning Pope, the Popes who had convoked the Council, the emperor and the kings who had supported it, the papal legates, the cardinals, the ambassadors present, and the bishops, followed by acclamations of acceptance of the faith of the Council and its decrees, and of anathema for all heretics.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct25.html'>Acclamations of the Fathers at the Close of the Council</link></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The history of the council is thus divided into three distinct periods: 154549, 155152 and 156263.

It is true that the emperor intended it to be a strictly general or truly ecumenical council, at which the Protestants should have a fair hearing. He secured, during the council's second period, 155153, an invitation, twice given, to the Protestants to be present and the council issued a letter of safe conduct (thirteenth session) and offered them the right of discussion, but denied them a vote.<space/><link><target>Melanchthon</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Johannes Brenz</target></link>, with some other German Lutherans, actually started in 1552 on the journey to Trento.

But the refusal to give the Protestants the right to vote and the consternation produced by the success of Maurice in his campaign against Charles V in 1552 effectually put an end to Protestant cooperation.</listitem><listitem>To effect a reformation in discipline or administration. This object had been one of the causes calling forth the reformatory councils and had been lightly touched upon by the<space/><link><target>Fifth Council of the Lateran</target></link><space/>under<space/><link><target>Pope Julius II</target></link>. The obvious corruption in the administration of the Church was one of the numerous causes of the Reformation. Twenty-five public sessions were held, but nearly half of them were spent in solemn formalities. The chief work was done in committees or congregations. The entire management was in the hands of the papal legate. The liberal elements lost out in the debates and voting. The council abolished some of the most notorious abuses and introduced or recommended disciplinary reforms affecting the sale of<space/><link><target>indulgence</target><trail>s</trail></link>, the morals of convents, the education of the clergy, the non-residence of bishops (also bishops having plurality of<space/><link><target>benefice</target><trail>s</trail></link>, which was fairly common), and the careless fulmination of censures, and forbade duelling.

The practice of withholding the cup from the laity was confirmed (twenty-first session) as one which the<space/><link><target>Church Fathers</target></link><space/>had commanded for good and sufficient reasons; yet in certain cases the Pope was made the supreme arbiter as to whether the rule should be strictly maintained. On the language of the Mass, &quot;contrary to what is often said&quot;, the council condemned the belief that only vernacular languages should be used, but did not insist on the use of Latin.<extension extension_name='ref' name="O'Malley, 31">O'Malley, 31</extension></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Holy Orders</target><part>Ordination</part></link><space/>(twenty-third session) was defined to imprint an<space/><link><target>sacramental character</target><part>indelible character</part></link><space/>on the soul.
