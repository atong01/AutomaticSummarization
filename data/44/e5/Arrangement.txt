In [[music]], an '''arrangement''' is a musical reconceptualization of a previously composed work. It may differ from the original work by means of reharmonization, melodic paraphrasing, orchestration, or development of the formal structure. Arranging differs from [[Orchestration#Orchestration as adaptation|orchestration]] in that the latter process is limited to the assignment of notes to instruments for [[performance]] by an [[orchestra]], [[concert band]], or other [[musical ensemble]]. Arranging "involves adding compositional techniques, such as new thematic material for introductions, transitions, or [[modulation (music)|modulations]], and endings.... Arranging is the art of giving an existing melody musical variety".<ref name="corozine3">(Corozine 2002, p.&nbsp;3)</ref>

== Classical music ==
Arrangements and transcriptions of classical and [[Art music|serious music]] go back to the early history of this genre. In particular, music written for the piano has frequently undergone this treatment.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/36011/arrangement Arrangement], Encyclopedia Britannica online</ref> The suite of ten piano pieces ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition#Arrangements and interpretations|Pictures at an Exhibition]]'', by [[Modest Mussorgsky]], has been arranged over twenty times, notably by [[Maurice Ravel]].<ref>[[Pictures at an Exhibition#orchestral arrangements|Partial list of orchestral arrangements to Pictures at an Exhibition]]</ref>

Due to his lack of expertise in orchestration, the American composer [[George Gershwin]] had his ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'' orchestrated and arranged by [[Ferde Grofé]].<ref>Greenberg, Rodney: ''George Gershwin'', page 66. Phaidon Press, 1998. ISBN 0-7148-3504-8.</ref>

==Popular music==
Popular music recordings often include parts for brass, string, and other instruments which were added by arrangers and not composed by the original songwriters. Popular music arrangements may also be considered to include new releases of existing songs with a new musical treatment. These changes can include alterations to [[tempo]], [[meter (music)|meter]], [[key (music)|key]], [[instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]], and other musical elements.

Well-known examples include [[Joe Cocker]]'s version of [[the Beatles]]' "[[With a Little Help from My Friends]]" and [[Ike Turner|Ike And Tina Turner]]'s version of [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]]'s "[[Proud Mary]]". The American group [[Vanilla Fudge]] and British group [[Yes (band)|Yes]] based their early careers on radical re-arrangements of contemporary hits.<ref>[http://www.classicbands.com/vanilla.html Vanilla Fudge covers] (classic bands website)</ref><ref>Close To the Edge – The Story of Yes, Chris Welch, Omnibus Press, 1999/2003/2008 pages 33-34</ref> Bonnie Pointer performed disco and Motown-themed versions of "Heaven Must Have Sent You."<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0688460/bio Bonnie Pointer bio] ([[IMDB]] website)</ref> [[Remix]]es, such as in [[dance music]], can also be considered arrangements.<ref>[http://books.google.co.il/books?id=raLmAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT47&lpg=PT47#v=onepage&q&f=false The Remix Manual: The Art and Science of Dance Music Remixing with Logic], Simon Langford (Elsevier, 2011, ISBN 978-0-240-81458-2)  page 47</ref>

Though arrangers may contribute substantially to finished musical products, for copyright and royalty purposes, they usually hold no legal claim to their work.<ref>[http://www.saffordbaker.com/2008/10/the-law-of-music-arrangements/ The Law of Music Arrangement] Safford and Baker law firm website</ref>

==Jazz==
Arrangements for small jazz combos are usually informal, minimal, and uncredited. Larger ensembles generally have had greater requirements for notated arrangements, though the early [[Count Basie]] [[big band]] is known for its many ''head'' arrangements, so called because they were worked out by the players themselves, memorized (in the player's ''head''), and never written down.<ref name="randel294">Randel 2002, p.&nbsp;294</ref> Most arrangements for big bands, however, were written down and credited to a specific arranger, as with arrangements by [[Sammy Nestico]] and [[Neal Hefti]] for Count Basie's later big bands.<ref>[http://www.jazzinamerica.org/jazzresources/stylesheets/9 Swing music history] and the big bands (Jazz in America website)</ref>

[[Don Redman]] made innovations in jazz arranging as a part of [[Fletcher Henderson]]'s orchestra in the 1920s. Redman's arrangements introduced a more intricate melodic presentation and ''soli'' performances for various sections of the big band.<ref name="fletcher">{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/jazz/biography/artist_id_henderson_fletcher.htm |title=JAZZ A Film By Ken Burns: Selected Artist Biography - Fletcher Henderson |publisher=PBS |date=1934-09-25 |accessdate=2013-10-18}}</ref> [[Benny Carter]] became Henderson's primary arranger in the early 30's, becoming known for his arranging abilities in addition to his previous recognition as a performer.<ref name="fletcher" /> Beginning in 1938, [[Billy Strayhorn]] became an arranger of great renown for the [[Duke Ellington]] orchestra. [[Jelly Roll Morton]] is sometimes considered the earliest jazz arranger. While he toured around the years 1912 to 1915, he wrote down parts to enable "pick-up" bands to perform his compositions.

Big band arrangements are informally called ''charts''. In the swing era they were usually either arrangements of popular songs or they were entirely new compositions.<ref>Giddins, Gary & Scott DeVeaux (2009). ''Jazz''. New York: W.W. Norton & Co, ISBN 978-0-393-06861-0</ref> [[Duke Ellington]]'s and [[Billy Strayhorn]]'s arrangements for the Duke Ellington big band were usually new compositions, and some of [[Eddie Sauter]]'s arrangements for the [[Benny Goodman]] band and [[Artie Shaw]]'s arrangements for his own band were new compositions as well. It became more common to arrange sketchy jazz combo compositions for big band after the bop era.<ref name="Bailey">{{cite web|last=Bailey|first=C. Michael|date=11 April 2008|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=28959&pg=1|title=Miles Davis, Miles Smiles, and the Invention of Post Bop|work=[[All About Jazz]]|accessdate=23 February 2013}}</ref>

After 1950, the big bands declined in number. However, several bands continued and arrangers provided renowned arrangements. [[Gil Evans]] wrote a number of large-ensemble arrangements in the late fifties and early sixties intended for recording sessions only.  Other arrangers of note include [[Vic Schoen]], [[Pete Rugolo]], [[Oliver Nelson]], [[Johnny Richards]], [[Billy May]], [[Thad Jones]], [[Maria Schneider (musician)|Maria Schneider]], [[Bob Brookmeyer]], [[Lou Marini]], [[Nelson Riddle]], [[Ralph Burns]], [[Billy Byers]], [[Gordon Jenkins]], [[Ray Conniff]], [[Henry Mancini]], [[Ray Reach]], and [[Claus Ogerman]].

In the 21st century, the Big Band arrangement has made a modest comeback. [[Gordon Goodwin]], [[Roy Hargrove]], and [[Christian McBride]] have all rolled out [[New Big Band]]s with both original compositions and new arrangements of standard tunes.<ref>"[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2012/02/grammy-awards-2012-carrington-and-corea-among-jazz-winners.html Carrington and Correa Among Jazz Winners]" – LATimes Blog, Feb. 2012</ref>

==Arranging for instrumental groups==

===Strings===
The string section is a body of instruments composed of various stringed instruments. By the 19th century [[orchestral music]] in [[Europe]] had standardized the string section into the following homogeneous instrumental groups: first [[violin]]s, second violins, [[viola]]s, [[cello]]s, and [[double bass]]es. The string section in a multi-sectioned orchestra is referred sometimes to as the "string choir."<ref>{{cite book|last=Adler|first=Samuel|title=The Study Of Orchestration|year=2002|publisher=W.W. Norton|location=New York|pages=111}}</ref>

The [[harp]] is also a stringed instrument, but is not a member of or homogeneous with the violin family and is not considered part of the string choir. [[Samuel Adler (composer)|Samuel Adler]] classifies the harp as a plucked string instrument in the same category as the [[guitar]] ([[Acoustic guitar|acoustic]] or [[Electric guitar|electric]]), [[mandolin]], [[banjo]], or [[zither]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Adler|first=Samuel|title=The Study Of Orchestration|year=2002|publisher=W.W. Norton|location=New York|pages=89}}</ref>  Like the harp these instruments do not belong to the violin family and are not [[homogeneous]] with the string choir. In modern arranging these instruments are considered part of the rhythm section. The [[Electric bass|electric string bass]] and upright string bass—depending on the circumstance—can be treated by the arranger as either string section or [[rhythm section]] instruments.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sebesky|first=Don|title=The Contemporary Arranger|year=1975|publisher=Alfred Pub.|location=New York|pages=117}}</ref>

A group of instruments in which each member plays a unique part—rather than playing in unison with other like instruments—is referred to as a [[Chamber music|chamber ensemble]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Oxford Music Online|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/05379?q=chamber+music&hbutton_search.x=0&hbutton_search.y=0&hbutton_search=search&source=omo_epm&source=omo_t237&source=omo_gmo&source=omo_t114&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1#firsthit|accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref>  A chamber ensemble made up entirely of strings of the violin family is referred to by its size. A [[string trio]] consists of three players, a [[string quartet]] four, a [[string quintet]] five, and so on.

In most circumstances the string section is treated by the arranger as one [[homogeneous]] unit and its members are required to play preconceived material rather than [[Musical improvisation|improvise]].

A string section can be utilized on its own (this is referred to as a string orchestra)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/string-orchestra |title=string orchestra |work=CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary - Complete & Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved October 21, 2012}}</ref>  or in conjunction with any of the other instrumental sections. More than one string orchestra can be utilized.

A standard string section (vln., vln 2., vla., vcl, cb.) with each section playing unison allows the arranger to create a five-part texture. Often an arranger will divide each violin section in half or thirds to achieve a denser texture. It is possible to carry this division to its logical extreme in which each member of the string section plays his or her own unique part.

====Size of the string section====
Artistic, budgetary and logistical concerns will determine the size and instrumentation of a string section. The [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Musical theatre|musical]] [[West Side Story]], in 1957, was booked into the Winter Garden theater; composer [[Leonard Bernstein]] disliked the playing of "house" viola players he would have to use there, and so he chose to leave them out of the show's instrumentation; a benefit was the creation of more space in the pit for an expanded percussion section.<ref>{{cite web|last=Burton|first=Humphrey|title=Leonard Bernstein by Humphrey Burton, Chapter 26|url=http://www.westsidestory.com/site/level2/archives/bibliography/bibliography.html|accessdate=22 July 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110629180202/http://www.westsidestory.com/site/level2/archives/bibliography/bibliography.html| archivedate= 29 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

[[George Martin]], [[Producer (music)|producer]] and arranger for [[The Beatles]], warns arrangers about the [[Intonation (music)|intonation]] issues when only two like instruments play in unison. "After a string quartet," Martin explains, "I do not think there is a satisfactory sound for strings until one has at least three players on each line...as a rule two stringed instruments together create a slight "beat" which does not give a smooth sound."<ref>{{cite book|last=Martin|first=George|title=Making Music: the Guide to Writing, Performing & Recording|year=1983|publisher=W. Morrow|location=New York|pages=82}}</ref>

While any combination and number of string instruments is possible in a section, a traditional string section sound is achieved with a violin-heavy balance of instruments.
