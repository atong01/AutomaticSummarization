The residents of lower Manhattan and particularly of Battery Park City were displaced for an extended period of time. Parts of the community were an official crime-scene and therefore residents were unable to return to live or even collect property. Many of the displaced residents were not allowed to return to the area for months and none were given government guidance of where to live temporarily on the already crowded island of Manhattan. With most hotel rooms booked, residents, including young children and the elderly were forced to fend for themselves.</paragraph><paragraph>When they were finally allowed to return to Battery Park City, some found that their homes had been looted. Upon residents' return, the air in the area was still filled with toxic smoke from the World Trade Center fires that persisted until January 2002. More than half of the area's residents moved away permanently from the community after the adjacent World Trade Center towers collapsed and spread toxic dust, debris, and smoke. Gateway Plaza's 600 building, Hudson View East, and Parc Place (now Rector Square) were punctured by airplane parts. The Winter Garden and other portions of the World Financial Center were severely damaged. Environmental concerns regarding dust from the Trade Center are a continuing source of concern for many residents, scientists, and elected officials. Since the attacks, the damage has been repaired.

Before construction, the site was empty and flat; part of the neighborhood's development plan, the park was designed in anticipation of four high residential towers on its west and east. Although a New York City public park, maintenance is overseen by the Battery Park City Parks Conservancy and the park was designed for the Battery Park City Authority. The park opened on September 30, 2004.<extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.batteryparkcity.org/Live/Parks-Public-Spaces/Teardrop-Park.php</extension><space/>There is also a southern extension to this park.</listitem><listitem><link><target>Vietnam Veterans Plaza</target></link>, though technically just outside Battery Park City, lies on a trapezoidal parcel of land that was formerly a roadway named<space/><link><target>Coenties Slip</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Vietnam Veterans Plaza"></extension></listitem><listitem><link><target>Washington Street Plaza</target></link>, a<space/><link><target>Pedestrian zone</target><part>pedestrian plaza</part></link><space/>on<space/><link><target>Washington Street (Manhattan)</target><part>Washington Street</part></link><space/>between Carlisle and Albany Streets, opened on May 23, 2013.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite news</target><arg name="work">Downtown Express</arg><arg name="title">Washington Street to gain public plaza</arg><arg name="url">http://www.downtownexpress.com/2012/11/14/washington-street-to-gain-public-plaza/</arg><arg></arg><arg name="author">Aline Reynolds<space/></arg><arg name="date">November 14, 2012<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">June 17, 2014</arg></template></extension></listitem></list><paragraph>In addition, there are:<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.batteryparkcity.org/new/Live/Parks-Public-Spaces/'>Parks&amp;nbsp;/ Public Spaces</link>, Battery Park City Authority</extension></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>Community Ballfields, North End Avenue between Murray and Warren Streets</listitem><listitem>The Esplanade, along the<space/><link><target>Hudson River</target></link><space/>from Stuyvesant High School to Battery Park</listitem><listitem>Monsignor Kowsky Plaza, east of the Esplanade</listitem><listitem><link><target>Nelson A.
