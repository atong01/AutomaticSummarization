==Geography==
[[File:Nycmap-batteryparkcity.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Location of Battery Park City, marked in yellow on the map]]

Battery Park City is bounded on the east by [[West Street (Manhattan)|West Street]], which separates the area from the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] of [[lower Manhattan]]. To the west, north, and south, the area is surrounded by the [[Hudson River]].

The development consists of roughly five major sections. Traveling north to south, the first neighborhood has high-rise residential buildings, the [[Stuyvesant High School]], a [[Regal Entertainment Group]] movie theater, and the [[#Library|Battery Park City branch]] of the [[New York Public Library]]. It is also the site of the 463-suite Conrad New York luxury hotel, which contains restaurants and bars such as the Loopy Doopy Rooftop Bar, ATRIO Wine Bar Restaurant, Mexican-themed El Vez, and three [[Danny Meyer]]-branded restaurants (North End Grill, Blue Smoke, [[Shake Shack]]); the hotel has a ballroom and a conference center.<ref>[http://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-sachs-neighborhood-2010-8 There Goes The Neighborhood: Goldman Sachs Accused Of Gentrifying Block Around Its HQ]. Joe Weisenthal in Business Insider 08/02/2010.</ref> Other restaurants located in that hotel, as well as a [[DSW, Inc.|DSW]] store and a [[New York Sports Club]] branch, were closed in 2009 after the takeover of the property by [[Goldman Sachs]]. Former undeveloped lots in the area have been developed into high-rise buildings; for example, [[Goldman Sachs]] built a new headquarters at [[200 West Street]].

Nearby is [[#Brookfield Place|Brookfield Place]], a complex of several commercial buildings formerly known as the World Financial Center.

Current residential neighborhoods of Battery Park City are divided into northern and southern sections, separated by Brookfield Place. The northern section consists entirely of large, 20–45-story buildings, all various shades of orange brick. The southern section, extending down from the Winter Garden, contains residential apartment building such as Gateway Plaza, and Rector Place apartment buildings. In this section lies the majority of Battery Park City's residential areas, in three sections: Gateway Plaza, a high-rise building complex; the "Rector Place Residential Neighborhood"; and the" Battery Place Residential Neighborhood". These subsections contain most of the area's residential buildings, along with [[park]] space, [[supermarket]]s, [[restaurant]]s, and [[movie theater]]s. Construction of residential buildings began north of the World Financial Center in the late 1990s, and completion of the final lots was completed in early 2011. Additionally, a park restoration was completed in a 2013.<ref>http://www.cultivatingculture.com/2013/04/10/battery-park-city-authority-completes-field-restoration/</ref>

== History ==

[[File:CONSTRUCTION BEGINS ON THE BATTERY PARK DEVELOPMENT ACROSS FROM THE WORLD TRADE BUILDINGS ON THE HUDSON RIVER - NARA - 549309.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Construction in May 1973]]

=== Site and formation ===
Throughout the 19th century and early 20th century, the area adjoining today's Battery Park City was known as [[#Cultural heritage|Little Syria]] with Lebanese, Greeks, Armenians, and other ethnic groups.

By the late 1950s, the once-prosperous port area of downtown Manhattan was occupied by a number of dilapidated shipping piers, casualties of the rise of [[container shipping]] which drove sea traffic to [[Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal|Port Elizabeth, New Jersey]]. The initial proposal to reclaim this area through [[Land reclamation|landfill]] was offered in the early 1960s by private firms and supported by the mayor. That plan became complicated when Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]] announced his desire to redevelop a part of the area as a separate project. The various groups reached a compromise, and in 1966 the governor unveiled the proposal for what would become Battery Park City. The creation of architect [[Wallace K. Harrison]], the proposal called for a 'comprehensive community' consisting of housing, social infrastructure and light industry. The landscaping of the park space and later the Winter Garden was designed by [[M. Paul Friedberg]].

In 1968, the [[New York State Legislature]] created the [[Battery Park City Authority]] (BPCA) to oversee development. The [[Empire State Development Corporation|New York State Urban Development Corporation]] and ten other public agencies were also involved in the development project.<ref name="enr-1983">{{cite news |title=Megajob takes foothold in fill, New York City's $1-billion river development survives snags |publisher=Engineering News-Record |date=1983-04-14}}</ref>

For the next several years, the BPCA made slow progress. In 1969, it unveiled a master plan for the area, and in 1972 issued $200 million in bonds to fund construction efforts. Landfill material from [[Building of the World Trade Center|construction]] of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] was used to add fill for the southern portion. Cellular [[cofferdam]]s were constructed to retain the material.<ref name="iglauer">{{cite news |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/content/articles/010924fr_archive02 |title=The Biggest Foundation |author=Iglauer, Edith |date=1972-11-04 |publisher=The New Yorker}}</ref> After removal of the piers, wooden piles and overburden of silt, the northern portion (north of, and including the marina) was filled with sand dredged from areas adjacent to Ambrose Channel in the Atlantic Ocean. By 1976, the landfill was completed. Seating stands for viewing the American Bicentennial "Operation Sail" flotilla parade were set up on the completed landfill in July 1976. Construction efforts ground to a halt for nearly two years beginning in 1977, as a result of city-wide financial hardships. In 1979, the title to the landfill was transferred from the city to the Battery Park City Authority, which financially restructured itself and created a new, more viable master plan, designed by [[Alex Cooper]] and Stanton Eckstut.

The design of BPC to some degree reflects the values of vibrant city neighborhoods championed by [[Jane Jacobs]]. The [[Urban Land Institute]] (ULI) awarded the Battery Park City Master Plan its 2010 Heritage Award, for having "facilitated the private development of 9.3 million square feet of commercial space, 7.2 million square feet of residential space, and nearly 36 acres of open space in lower Manhattan, becoming a model for successful large-scale planning efforts and marking a positive shift away from the urban renewal mindset of the time."<ref>http://www.uli.org/News/MediaCenter/PressReleases/2010%20archives/Content/AwardsforExcellenceAmericas2010Winners.aspx</ref>

===Construction and early development===
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the site hosted Creative Time's landmark Art on the Beach sculpture exhibitions. On September 23, 1979, the landfill was the site of an [[List of anti-nuclear protests in the United States|anti-nuclear rally]] attended by 200,000 people.<ref name=nyt>{{cite news |first=Robin |last=Herman |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Nearly 200,000 Rally to Protest Nuclear Energy |url= |work=[[New York Times]] |page=B1 |date=September 24, 1979 |accessdate= }}</ref>

Construction began on the first residential building in 1980, followed in 1981 with the start of construction on the [[World Financial Center]]. [[Olympia and York]], of [[Toronto]], was named as the developer for the [[World Financial Center]] in 1981, who then hired [[Cesar Pelli]] as the lead architect. By 1985, construction was completed and the World Financial Center (later renamed Brookfield Place New York) saw its first tenants.

Throughout the 1980s, the Battery Park City Authority oversaw a great deal of construction, including the entire [[Rector Place]] neighborhood and the river esplanade. It was during that period that current City Planning Department Director [[Amanda Burden]] worked on Battery Park City. During the 1980s, a total of 13 buildings were constructed. The [[Vietnam Veterans Plaza]] was established by [[Edward I. Koch]] in 1985.<ref name="Vietnam Veterans Plaza">{{cite web|url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/vietnamveteransplaza/history|title=Vietnam Veterans Plaza|publisher=New York City Department of Parks & Recreation|accessdate=14 February 2014}}</ref> In the early 1990s, Battery Park City became the new home of the [[Stuyvesant High School]]. During the 1990s, an additional six buildings were added to the neighborhood. By the turn of the 21st century, Battery Park City was mostly completed, with the exception of some ongoing construction on West Street.

Initially, in the 1980s, 23 buildings were built in the area. By the 1990s, 9 more buildings were built, followed by the construction of 11 buildings in the 2000s and 3 buildings in the 2010s.<ref>[http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ne?id=100010 Emporis NYC Districts and Zones: Battery Park City<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Early 21st century===

The [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 had a major impact on Battery Park City. The residents of lower Manhattan and particularly of Battery Park City were displaced for an extended period of time. Parts of the community were an official crime-scene and therefore residents were unable to return to live or even collect property. Many of the displaced residents were not allowed to return to the area for months and none were given government guidance of where to live temporarily on the already crowded island of Manhattan. With most hotel rooms booked, residents, including young children and the elderly were forced to fend for themselves.

When they were finally allowed to return to Battery Park City, some found that their homes had been looted.  Upon residents' return, the air in the area was still filled with toxic smoke from the World Trade Center fires that persisted until January 2002. More than half of the area's residents moved away permanently from the community after the adjacent World Trade Center towers collapsed and spread toxic dust, debris, and smoke. Gateway Plaza's 600 building, Hudson View East, and Parc Place (now Rector Square) were punctured by airplane parts. The Winter Garden and other portions of the World Financial Center were severely damaged. Environmental concerns regarding dust from the Trade Center are a continuing source of concern for many residents, scientists, and elected officials. Since the attacks, the damage has been repaired. Temporarily reduced rents and government subsidies helped restore residential occupancy in the years following the attacks.

After September 11, 2001, residents of Battery Park City and [[Tribeca]] formed [[the TriBattery Pops Tom Goodkind Conductor]] in response to the events of the attacks. The “Pops” have been [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-nominated and are the first lower Manhattan all-volunteer community band in a century.

Since then, real estate development in the area has continued robustly. Commercial development includes the {{convert|2100000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} [[200 West Street]], the [[Goldman Sachs]] global headquarters, which began construction in 2005 and opened for occupancy in October 2009.<ref>http://www.newyork.construction.com/projects/TopPrj_05-06/TPstrt1-5.pdf</ref> 200 West Street is seeking gold-level certification under the [[United States Green Building Council]]’s [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) program by incorporating various water and energy conservation features. Several residential projects are underway, including LEED buildings which cater to the environmentally conscious.

=={{anchor|Battery Park City Authority|Ownership|Maintenance}} Ownership and maintenance==

Battery Park City is owned and managed by the '''Hugh L. Carey Battery Park City Authority''' (BPCA), a Class A [[public-benefit corporation]] created by New York State under the authority of the [[Empire State Development Corporation|Urban Development Corporation]].<ref>{{cite news |title=6 Builders Chosen for Housing at Battery Park City |first=Paul |last=Goldberger |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07EED7153BF93AA2575BC0A967948260 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 19, 1981 |accessdate=July 29, 2010}}</ref> Its mission is "to plan, create, co-ordinate and maintain a balanced community of [[commerce|commercial]], [[residential]], [[retail]], and [[park]] space within its designated 92-acre site on the [[Lower West Side, Manhattan|lower west side]] of [[Manhattan]]"<ref>[http://www.batteryparkcity.org/page/page11.html Battery Park City Authority Mission Statement]</ref> in [[New York City]].

[[File:Tribeca Pointe 41 River Terrace Battery Park City.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Tribeca Pointe.]]

Under the 1989 agreement between the BPCA and the City of New York, $600 million was transferred by the BPCA to the city. Charles J. Urstadt, the first Chairman and CEO of the BPCA, noted in an August 19, 2007 op-ed piece in the ''[[New York Post]]'' that the aggregate figure of funds transferred to the City of New York is above $1.4 billion, with the BPCA continuing to contribute $200 million a year.

Excess revenue from the area was to be contributed to other housing efforts, typically low-income projects in [[the Bronx]] and [[Harlem]]. Much of this funding has historically been diverted to general city expenses, under section 3.d of the 1989 agreement. However, in July 2006, Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]], Governor [[George Pataki]], and Comptroller [[William C. Thompson, Jr.]] announced the final approval for the New York City Housing Trust Fund derived from $130 million in Battery Park City revenues. The fund aimed to preserve or create 4,300 units of low- and moderate-income housing by 2009.<ref>Scott, Janny (August 1, 2006). "[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/01/nyregion/01mbrfs-004.html?fta=y Manhattan: Housing Plan Approved."]</ref> It also provided seed financing for the New York Acquisition Fund, a $230 million initiative that aims to serve as a catalyst for the construction and preservation of more than 30,000 units of affordable housing citywide by 2016.

When the building opened, rents ranged from roughly $2,500 to $9,001 depending on the size of the unit. The building has been rated [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Platinum. The energy conserving building design is 35% more energy-efficient than code requires, resulting in a 67% lower electricity demand during peak hours, resulting in, among other benefits,  lower electric bills for residents, photovoltaic panels converting sunlight to electricity, and a computerized building management system and environmentally responsible operating and maintenance practices.

Located in the middle of Battery Park City and overlooking the [[Hudson River]], Brookfield Place, designed by [[César Pelli]] and owned mostly by [[Toronto]]-based [[Brookfield Office Properties]], has been home to offices of various major companies, including [[Merrill Lynch]], [[RBC Capital Markets]], [[Nomura Group]], [[American Express]] and [[Brookfield Asset Management]], among others. Brookfield Place also serves as the United States headquarters for [[Brookfield Office Properties]], which has its headquarters located in [[200 Vesey Street]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.com/arts__attractions/world_financial_center_and_winter_garden.1466/editorial_review.aspx |title=World Financial Center and Winter Garden New York City.com : Arts & Attractions : Editorial Review |publisher=Nyc.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldfinancialcenter.com/retail-dining/about |title=about |publisher=Worldfinancialcenter.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-18}}</ref> Brookfield Place also has its own [[zip code]], 10281.

Brookfield Place's ground floor and portions of the second floor are occupied by a mall; its center point is a steel-and-glass atrium known as the [[Winter Garden Atrium|Winter Garden]]. Outside of the Winter Garden lies a sizeable [[yacht]] harbor on the Hudson known as North Cove.

The building's original developer was [[Olympia and York]] of [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. It used to be named the World Financial Center, but in 2014, the complex was given its current name following the completion of extensive renovations. The World Financial Center complex was built by [[Olympia and York]] between 1982 and 1988; it was damaged in the September 11 attacks but later repaired. It has six constituent buildings – [[200 Liberty Street]], [[225 Liberty Street]], [[200 Vesey Street]], [[250 Vesey Street]], the Winter Garden Atrium, and One North End Avenue (a.k.a. the [[New York Mercantile Exchange]] building).

== Parks and open spaces ==

More than one-third of the neighborhood is parkland.<ref name=amny/>

Some large open spaces and parks include:
* [[Teardrop Park]] sits midblock, near the corner of Warren Street and River Terrace. Before construction, the site was empty and flat; part of the neighborhood's development plan, the park was designed in anticipation of four high residential towers on its west and east. Although a New York City public park, maintenance is overseen by the Battery Park City Parks Conservancy and the park was designed for the Battery Park City Authority. The park opened on September 30, 2004.<ref>http://www.batteryparkcity.org/Live/Parks-Public-Spaces/Teardrop-Park.php</ref> There is also a southern extension to this park.
