He further supposes that he has a set of rules in English that &quot;enable me to correlate one set of formal symbols with another set of formal symbols&quot;, that is, the Chinese characters. These rules allow him to respond, in written Chinese, to questions, also written in Chinese, in such a way that the posers of the questions who do understand Chinese are convinced that Searle can actually understand the Chinese conversation too, even though he cannot. Similarly, he argues that if there is a computer program that allows a computer to carry on an intelligent conversation in a written language, the computer executing the program would not understand the conversation either.</paragraph><paragraph>The experiment is the centerpiece of Searle's<space/><bold>Chinese room argument</bold><space/>which holds that a program cannot give a computer a &quot;<link><target>mind</target></link>&quot;, &quot;<link><target>intentionality</target><part>understanding</part></link>&quot; or &quot;<link><target>consciousness</target></link>&quot;, regardless of how intelligently it may make it behave.

Searle could receive Chinese characters through a slot in the door, process them according to the program's instructions, and produce Chinese characters as output. If the computer had passed the Turing test this way, it follows, says Searle, that he would do so as well, simply by running the program manually.</paragraph><paragraph>Searle asserts that there is no essential difference between the roles of the computer and himself in the experiment. Each simply follows a program, step-by-step, producing a behavior which is then interpreted as demonstrating intelligent conversation. However, Searle would not be able to understand the conversation.

Russell</target><part>Stuart Russell</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Peter Norvig</target></link><space/>argue that, if we accept Searle's description of intentionality, consciousness and the mind, we are forced to accept that consciousness is<space/><link><target>epiphenomenal</target></link>: that it &quot;casts no shadow&quot;, that it is undetectable in the outside world. They argue that Searle must be mistaken about the &quot;knowability of the mental&quot;, and in his belief that there are &quot;causal properties&quot; in our neurons that give rise to the mind. They point out that, by Searle's own description, these causal properties can't be detected by anyone outside the mind, otherwise the Chinese Room couldn't pass the<space/><link><target>Turing test</target></link>the people outside would be able to tell there wasn't a Chinese speaker in the room by detecting their causal properties. Since they can't detect causal properties, they can't detect the existence of the mental. In short, Searle's &quot;causal properties&quot; and consciousness itself is undetectable, and anything that cannot be detected either does not exist or does not matter.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Russell</arg><arg>Norvig</arg><arg>2003</arg></template></listitem></list><paragraph><link><target>Daniel Dennett</target></link><space/>provides this extension to the &quot;epiphenomena&quot; argument.</paragraph><list type='def'><listitem><defkey>Dennett's reply from natural selection</defkey><defval>Suppose that, by some mutation, a human being is born that does not have Searle's &quot;causal properties&quot; but nevertheless acts exactly like a human being. (This sort of animal is called a &quot;<link><target>philosophical zombie</target><part>zombie</part></link>&quot; in thought experiments in the<space/><link><target>philosophy of mind</target></link>). This new animal would reproduce just as any other human and eventually there would be more of these zombies. Natural selection would favor the zombies, since their design is (we could suppose) a bit simpler. Eventually the humans would die out. So therefore, if Searle is right, it is most likely that human beings (as we see them today) are actually &quot;zombies&quot;, who nevertheless insist they are conscious. It is impossible to know whether we are all zombies or not. Even if we are all zombies, we would still believe that we are not.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Harvnb</target><arg>Cole</arg><arg>2004</arg><arg name="p">22</arg></template>;<space/><template><target>Harvnb</target><arg>Crevier</arg><arg>1993</arg><arg name="p">271</arg></template>;<space/><template><target>Harvnb</target><arg>Harnad</arg><arg>2005</arg><arg name="p">4</arg></template>.</extension></defval></listitem></list><paragraph>Searle disagrees with this analysis and argues that &quot;the study of the mind starts with such facts as that humans have beliefs, while thermostats, telephones, and adding machines don't ... what we wanted to know is what distinguishes the mind from thermostats and livers.&quot;<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Searle</arg><arg>1980</arg><arg name="p">7</arg></template><space/>He takes it as obvious that we can detect the presence of consciousness and dismisses these replies as being off the point.</paragraph><heading level='2'>In popular culture</heading><paragraph>The Chinese room argument is a central concept in<space/><link><target>Peter Watts (author)</target><part>Peter Watts</part></link>' novels<space/><italics><link><target>Blindsight (Watts novel)</target><part>Blindsight</part></link></italics><space/>and (to a lesser extent)<space/><italics>Echopraxia</italics>.
