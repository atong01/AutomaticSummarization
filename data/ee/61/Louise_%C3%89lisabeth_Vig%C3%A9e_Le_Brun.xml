Her mother, Jeanne (ne Maissin) was a hairdresser. She was sent to live with relatives in<space/><link><target>pernon</target></link><space/>until the age of 6 when she entered a convent where she remained for five years. Her father died when she was 12 years old. In 1768, her mother married a wealthy jeweler, Jacques-Franois Le Svre and shortly after, the family moved to the<space/><link><target>Rue Saint-Honor</target></link>, close to the<space/><link><target>Palais Royal</target></link>. She was later patronized by the wealthy heiress<space/><link><target>Louise Marie Adlade de Bourbon</target></link>, wife of<space/><link><target>Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orlans</target></link>. During this period Louise lisabeth benefited from the advice of<space/><link><target>Gabriel Franois Doyen</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Jean-Baptiste Greuze</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Joseph Vernet</target></link>, and other masters of the period.</paragraph><paragraph>By the time she was in her early teens, Louise lisabeth was painting portraits professionally.

In 1774, she was made a member of the Acadmie. On January 11, 1776 she married Jean-Baptiste-Pierre Le Brun, a painter and art dealer. Vige Le Brun began exhibiting her work at their home in Paris, the Htel de Lubert, and the Salons she held here supplied her with many new and important contacts.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="last1">Nicholson</arg><arg name="first1">Kathleen</arg><arg name="title">Vigée Le Brun, Elisabeth-Louise</arg><arg name="url">http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T089458</arg><arg name="website">Grove Art Online.

In 1787, she caused a minor public scandal with a self-portrait, exhibited the same year, in which she was shown smiling open-mouthed in contravention of painting conventions going back to antiquity.

So pleased was the queen that during a period of six years, Vige Le Brun would paint more than thirty portraits of the queen and her family, leading to her being commonly viewed as the official portraitist of Marie Antoinette. Vige Le Brun helped to improve Marie Antoinette's image by painting portraits that included her children and worked towards making her more relatable to the public, in hopes to counter the bad press and judgement the queen had recently received. She received commission for the portrait<space/><italics>Marie-Antoinette and her Children</italics><space/>(1787) in 1785, which portrayed Marie Antoinette as a devout and loving mother figure.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Image:Marie Antoinette and her Children by lisabeth Vige-Lebrun.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>upright</part><part>''<link><target>Marie Antoinette</target></link><space/>and her Children'', 1787.</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>Marie Antoinette later worked as a helping hand in Louise Elisabeth's acceptance into the Acadmie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture in 1783.<extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.biography.com/people/elisabeth-vig%C3%A9e-le-brun-37280#career-and-success-in-paris</extension><space/>Whilst of benefit during the reign of the Bourbon royals, this label was to prove problematic later.On 31 May 1783, Vige-Le Brun was accepted as a member of France's<space/><italics><link><target>Acadmie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture</target></link></italics>.

Although the French aesthetic was widely admired in Russia, there remained various cultural differences as to what was deemed acceptable. Catherine was not initially happy with Vige Le Brun's portrait of her granddaughters, Elena and Alexandra Pavlovna, due to the area of bare skin the short sleeved gowns revealed. In order to please the Empress, Vige Le Brun added sleeves, thereby giving the work its characteristic look. This tactic seemed effective in pleasing Catherine, as she agreed to sit herself for Vige Le Brun (although Catherine died of a stroke before this work was due to begin).<extension extension_name='ref'>Elisabeth Vige Le Brun: the odyssey of an artist in an age of revolution/Gita May</extension></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Image:Alexandra and Elena Pavlovna.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>upright</part><part>''<link><target>Paul I of Russia#Issue</target><part>Alexandra and Elena Pavlovna</part></link>'', painted during Vige Le Brun's time in<space/><link><target>St Petersburg</target></link>.</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>While in Saint Petersburg, Vige Le Brun was made a member of the<space/><italics>Academy of Fine Arts of Saint Petersburg</italics>.
