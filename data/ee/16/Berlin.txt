===Etymology===
The origin of the name ''Berlin'' is uncertain. It may have its roots in the language of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] inhabitants of the area of today's Berlin, and may be related to the Old [[Polabian language|Polabian]] stem ''berl-''/''birl-'' ("swamp").<ref>{{Cite book|last=Berger|first=Dieter|title=Geographische Namen in Deutschland|publisher=Bibliographisches Institut|year=1999|isbn=3-411-06252-5}}</ref> [[Folk etymology]] connects the name to the German word for bear, ''Bär''. A bear also appears in the [[Coat of arms of Berlin|coat of arms of the city]].<ref name="Somers2008">{{cite book|author=Steven Somers|title=Those Crazy Germans!: A Lighthearted Guide to Germany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1h8NE0iud1IC&pg=PA12|date=14 July 2008|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=978-1-4535-6595-7|page=12}}</ref>

In 1443, [[Frederick II, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick II Irontooth]] started the construction of a new [[Stadtschloss, Berlin|royal palace]] in the twin city Berlin-Cölln. The protests of the town citizens against the building culminated in 1448, in the "Berlin Indignation" ("Berliner Unwille").<ref>[http://www.diegeschichteberlins.de/geschichteberlins/berlinabc/stichworteag/555-berliner-unwillen.html Berliner Unwillen].

Since 1618, the Margraviate of Brandenburg had been in [[personal union]] with the [[Duchy of Prussia]]. In 1701, however, the dual state formed the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], as [[Frederick III, Elector of Brandenburg]] now crowned himself as king [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I in Prussia]]. Berlin became the capital of the new Kingdom. This was a successful attempt to centralise the capital in the very outspread state, and it was the first time the city began to grow. In 1709 Berlin merged with the four cities of Cölln, Friedrichswerder, Friedrichstadt and Dorotheenstadt under the name Berlin, "Haupt- und Residenzstadt Berlin".<ref name="Stöver2010"/>

The [[Industrial Revolution]] transformed Berlin during the 19th century; the city's economy and population expanded dramatically, and it became the main railway hub and economic centre of Germany.

At the end of [[World War I]] in 1918, a [[Weimar Republic|republic]] was proclaimed by [[Philipp Scheidemann]] at the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag building]]. In 1920, the [[Greater Berlin Act]] incorporated dozens of suburban cities, villages, and estates around Berlin into an expanded city. The act increased the area of Berlin from {{convert|66|to|883|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. The population almost doubled and Berlin had a population of around four million. During the [[Weimar culture|Weimar era]], Berlin underwent political unrest due to economic uncertainties, but also became a renowned center of the [[Roaring Twenties]].  The metropolis experienced its heyday as a major world capital and was known for its leadership roles in science, technology, arts, the humanities, city planning, film, higher education, government, and industries. [[Albert Einstein]] rose to public prominence during his years in Berlin, being awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] in 1921.

In 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] [[Machtergreifung|came to power]]. NSDAP rule effectively destroyed Berlin's Jewish community, which had numbered 160,000, representing one-third of all Jews in the country. Berlin's Jewish population fell to about 80,000 as a result of emigration between 1933 and 1939. After [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, thousands of the city's persecuted groups were imprisoned in the nearby [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] or, starting in early 1943, were shipped to [[death camp]]s, such as [[Auschwitz]].<ref>[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005450 Berlin<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> During World War II, large parts of Berlin were destroyed in [[Battle of Berlin (air)|the 1943–45 air raids]] and during the [[Battle of Berlin]].

The victorious powers divided the city into four sectors, analogous to the [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation zones]] into which Germany was divided. The sectors of the [[Western Allies]] (the United States, the United Kingdom and France) formed [[West Berlin]], while the [[Soviet Union|Soviet sector]] formed [[East Berlin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/t297c01.html|title=Agreement to divide Berlin|work=FDR-Library|accessdate=18 August 2008}}</ref>

All four [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] shared administrative responsibilities for Berlin. However, in 1948, when the Western Allies extended the currency reform in the Western zones of Germany to the three western sectors of Berlin, the [[Soviet Union]] imposed a [[Berlin Blockade|blockade]] on the access routes to and from West Berlin, which lay entirely inside Soviet-controlled territory. The [[Berlin airlift]], conducted by the three western Allies, overcame this blockade by supplying food and other supplies to the city from June 1948 to May 1949.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.western-allies-berlin.com/historic-events/detail/airlift-blockade|title=Berlin Airlift / Blockade|publisher=Western Allies Berlin|accessdate=18 August 2008}}</ref> In 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in [[West Germany]] and eventually included all of the American, British, and French zones, excluding those three countries' zones in Berlin, while the [[Marxist-Leninist]] [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] was proclaimed in East Germany. West Berlin officially remained an occupied city, but it politically was aligned with the Federal Republic of Germany despite West Berlin's geographic isolation. Airline service to West Berlin was granted only to American, British, and French airlines.

The founding of the two German states increased [[Cold War]] tensions. West Berlin was surrounded by East German territory, and East Germany proclaimed the Eastern part as its capital, a move that was not recognized by the western powers. East Berlin included most of the historic center of the city. The West German government established itself in [[Bonn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berlin.de/berlin-im-ueberblick/geschichte/1945.en.html|title=Berlin official website; History after 1945|publisher=City of Berlin|accessdate=8 April 2009}}</ref> In 1961, East Germany began the building of the [[Berlin Wall]] between East and West Berlin, and events escalated to a tank standoff at [[Checkpoint Charlie]]. West Berlin was now de facto a part of West Germany with a unique legal status, while East Berlin was de facto a part of East Germany. [[John F. Kennedy]] gave his "''[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]''" – speech in 1963 underlining the US support for the Western part of the city. Berlin was completely divided. Although it was possible for Westerners to pass from one to the other side through strictly controlled checkpoints, for most Easterners travel to West Berlin or West Germany was prohibited. In 1971, a [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin|Four-Power agreement]] guaranteed access to and from West Berlin by car or train through East Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usa.usembassy.de/etexts/ga5-710903.htm|title=Ostpolitik: The Quadripartite Agreement of September 3, 1971|publisher=US Berlin Embassy|accessdate=18 August 2008}}</ref>

In 1989, with the end of the Cold War and pressure from the East German population, the Berlin Wall fell on 9 November and was subsequently mostly demolished. Today, the [[East Side Gallery]] preserves a large portion of the Wall. On 3 October 1990, the two parts of Germany were [[German reunification|reunified]] as the Federal Republic of Germany, and Berlin again became the official German capital. In 1991, the German Parliament, the [[Bundestag]], [[Decision on the Capital of Germany|voted to move the seat]] of the German capital from Bonn to Berlin, which was completed in 1999. [[Berlin's 2001 administrative reform]] merged several districts. The number of boroughs was reduced from 23 to 12. In 2006, the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final|FIFA World Cup Final]] was held in Berlin.

===Topography===
[[File:Visit-suomi-2009-05-by-RalfR-014.jpg|thumb|Aerial view over Berlin Mitte.]]

Berlin is situated in northeastern [[Germany]], in an area of low-lying marshy woodlands with a mainly flat [[topography]], part of the vast [[Northern European Plain]] which stretches all the way from northern [[France]] to western [[Russia]]. The ''Berliner Urstromtal'' (an ice age [[glacial valley]]), between the low [[Barnim Plateau]] to the north and the [[Teltow plateau|Teltow Plateau]] to the south, was formed by meltwater flowing from ice sheets at the end of the last [[Weichselian glaciation]]. The [[Spree]] follows this valley now. In Spandau, Berlin's westernmost borough, the Spree empties into the river [[Havel]], which flows from north to south through western Berlin. The course of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler See and [[Großer Wannsee]]. A series of lakes also feeds into the upper Spree, which flows through the [[Müggelsee|Großer Müggelsee]] in eastern Berlin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=52.5333,13.38000&spn=0.060339,0.085316&t=k&hl=en|title=Satellite Image Berlin|publisher=[[Google Maps]]|accessdate=18 August 2008}}</ref>

Substantial parts of present-day Berlin extend onto the low plateaus on both sides of the Spree Valley. Large parts of the boroughs [[Reinickendorf]] and [[Pankow]] lie on the Barnim Plateau, while most of the boroughs of [[Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf]], [[Steglitz-Zehlendorf]], [[Tempelhof-Schöneberg]], and [[Neukölln]] lie on the Teltow Plateau.

The borough of Spandau lies partly within the Berlin Glacial Valley and partly on the Nauen Plain, which stretches to the west of Berlin. The highest elevations in Berlin are the [[Teufelsberg]] and the [[Müggelberge]] in the city's outskirts, and in the center [[Kreuzberg (Tempelhofer Berge)|Kreuzberg]]. While the latter measures {{convert|66|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, the former both have an elevation of about {{convert|115|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The Teufelsberg is in fact an artificial hill composed of a [[Schuttberg|pile of rubble]] from the ruins of World War II.

===Climate===

[[File:Luftbild bln-schmoeckwitz.jpg|thumb|The outskirts of Berlin are covered with woodlands and numerous lakes]]

Berlin has a [[Maritime temperate climate]] (''Cfb'') according to the [[Köppen climate classification]] system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=58301&cityname=Berlin%2C+Berlin%2C+Germany&units=|title=Berlin, Germany Climate Summary|publisher=Weatherbase|accessdate=15 March 2015}}</ref> There are significant influences of mild continental climate due to its inland position, with frosts being common in winter and there being larger temperature differences between seasons than typical for many oceanic climates.

Summers are warm and sometimes humid with average high temperatures of {{convert|22|–|25|C|F}} and lows of {{convert|12|–|14|C|F}}. Winters are cool with average high temperatures of {{convert|3|C|F}} and lows of {{convert|−2|to|0|C|F}}. Spring and autumn are generally chilly to mild.

===Cityscape===
[[File:Berlin potsdamer platz.jpg|thumb|Roofs of [[Mitte (locality)|Berlin Mitte]], looking towards [[Potsdamer Platz]] and [[Alexanderplatz]] with the [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]]]]
Berlin's history has left the city with a highly eclectic array of architecture and buildings. The city's appearance today is predominantly shaped by the key role it played in Germany's history in the 20th century. Each of the national governments based in Berlin — the Kingdom of Prussia, the 1871 German Empire, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, East Germany, and now the reunified Germany — initiated ambitious reconstruction programs, with each adding its own distinctive style to the city's architecture.

Berlin was devastated by [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|bombing raids]], fires and street battles during World War II, and many of the buildings that had remained after the war were demolished in the post-war period in both West and East Berlin. Much of this demolition was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new residential or business quarters and main roads. Many [[Ornament (art)|ornaments]] of pre-war buildings were destroyed following [[Ornament and Crime|modernist dogmas]]. While in both systems and in reunified Berlin, various important heritage monuments were also (partly) [[Reconstruction (architecture)|reconstructed]], including the ''Forum Fridericianum'' with e.g., the [[Berlin State Opera|State Opera]] (1955), [[Charlottenburg Palace]] (1957), the main monuments of the [[Gendarmenmarkt]] (1980s), [[Alte Kommandantur|Kommandantur]] (2003) and the project to reconstruct the baroque facades of the [[City Palace, Berlin|City Palace]]. A number of new buildings is inspired by historical predecessors or the general classical style of Berlin, such as [[Hotel Adlon]].

Clusters of [[List of tallest buildings in Berlin|high-rise buildings]] emerge at e.g., [[Potsdamer Platz]], [[City West]] and [[Alexanderplatz]]. Berlin has three of the top 40 [[List of tallest buildings in Germany|tallest buildings]] in Germany.

The [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]] (TV tower) at [[Alexanderplatz]] in [[Mitte]] is among the tallest structures in the European Union at {{convert|368|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed from its {{convert|204|m|ft|abbr=on}} high observation floor. Starting here the [[Karl-Marx-Allee]] heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the [[Socialist Classicism]] style. Adjacent to this area is the [[Rotes Rathaus]] (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. In front of it is the [[Neptunbrunnen]], a fountain featuring a mythological group of [[Triton (mythology)|Tritons]], [[Anthropomorphism|personifications]] of the four main Prussian rivers and [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] on top of it.

[[File:BrandenburgerTorGold.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Brandenburg Gate]].]]

The [[Brandenburg Gate]] is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany. The [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag building]] is the traditional seat of the German Parliament, was remodeled by British architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.

The [[East Side Gallery]] is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division.

The [[Gendarmenmarkt]], a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] square in Berlin the name of which derives from the headquarters of the famous Gens d'armes regiment located here in the 18th century, is bordered by two similarly designed cathedrals, the [[Französischer Dom]] with its observation platform and the [[Deutscher Dom]]. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.

[[File:Lascar Gendarmenmarkt (4472434082).jpg|thumb|[[Gendarmenmarkt]] at night.]]

The [[Museum Island]] in the [[River Spree]] houses [[Berlin#Museums|five museums]] built from 1830 to 1930 and is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Restoration and the construction of a main entrance to all museums, as well as the reconstruction of the [[Stadtschloss, Berlin|Stadtschloss]] is continuing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/newsticker/neumann--stadtschloss-wird-teurer,10917074,10924086.html |title=Neumann: Stadtschloss wird teurer|work= Berliner Zeitung |language=de |date=24 June 2011 |accessdate=7 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/archiv/die-nullerjahre--nation-building---der-wiedervereinigte-staat-baut-sich-eine-neue-hauptstadt-das-pathos-der-berliner-republik,10810590,10717494.html |title=Das Pathos der Berliner Republik|work= Berliner Zeitung |language=de |date=19 May 2010 |accessdate=7 April 2012}}</ref> Also located on the island and adjacent to the [[Lustgarten]] and palace is [[Berlin Cathedral]], emperor William II's ambitious attempt to create a Protestant counterpart to [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome. A large crypt houses the remains of some of the earlier Prussian royal family. [[St. Hedwig's Cathedral]] is Berlin's Roman Catholic cathedral.

[[File:Berlin Höfe (575671533).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Hackesche Höfe]]]]

[[Unter den Linden]] is a tree-lined east–west avenue from the Brandenburg Gate to the site of the former Berliner Stadtschloss, and was once Berlin's premier promenade. Many Classical buildings line the street and part of [[Humboldt University]] is located there. [[Friedrichstraße]] was Berlin's legendary street during the [[Golden Twenties]]. It combines 20th-century traditions with the modern architecture of today's Berlin.

[[Potsdamer Platz]] is an entire quarter built from scratch after 1995 after the [[Berlin Wall|Wall]] came down.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/bauen/baubilanz/en/potsdamer_platz.html|title=Construction and redevelopment since 1990|publisher=Senate Department of Urban Development|accessdate=18 August 2008}}</ref> To the west of Potsdamer Platz is the Kulturforum, which houses the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin|Gemäldegalerie]], and is flanked by the [[Neue Nationalgalerie]] and the [[Berliner Philharmonie]]. The [[Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe]], a [[Holocaust]] memorial, is situated to the north.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://travel2.nytimes.com/2005/05/09/arts/design/09holo.html?ex=1162962000&en=272335914d8b80d6&ei=5070|title=A Forest of Pillars, Recalling the Unimaginable|work=The New York Times|accessdate=18 August 2008|first=Nicolai|last=Ouroussoff|date=9 May 2005}}</ref>

The area around [[Hackescher Markt]] is home to the fashionable culture, with countless clothing outlets, clubs, bars, and galleries. This includes the [[Hackesche Höfe]], a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. The nearby [[New Synagogue, Berlin|New Synagogue]] is the center of Jewish culture.

[[File:Le château de Charlottenburg (Berlin) (6340508573).jpg|thumb|[[Schloss Charlottenburg]] is the largest existing palace in Berlin.]]

The [[Straße des 17. Juni]], connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Ernst-Reuter-Platz, serves as the central East-West-Axis. Its name commemorates the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953]]. Approximately half-way from the Brandenburg Gate is the Großer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the [[Siegessäule]] (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated 1938–39 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.

The [[Kurfürstendamm]] is home to some of Berlin's luxurious stores with the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]] at its eastern end on [[Breitscheidplatz]]. The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Nearby on Tauentzienstraße is [[KaDeWe]], claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store. The [[Rathaus Schöneberg]], where [[John F. Kennedy]] made his famous "[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]!" speech, is situated in [[Tempelhof-Schöneberg]].
 
West of the center, [[Schloss Bellevue]] is the residence of the German President. [[Schloss Charlottenburg]], which was burnt out in the Second World War is the largest historical palace in Berlin.

The [[Funkturm Berlin]] is a {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall lattice radio tower at the fair area, built between 1924 and 1926. It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators and has a restaurant {{convert|55|m|ft|abbr=on}} and an observation deck {{convert|126|m|ft|abbr=on}} above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator.

National and international migration into the city has a long history. In 1685, following the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] in France, the city responded with the [[Edict of Potsdam]], which guaranteed religious freedom and tax-free status to French Huguenot refugees for ten years. The [[Greater Berlin Act]] in 1920 incorporated many suburbs and surrounding cities of Berlin. It formed most of the territory that comprises modern Berlin and increased the population from 1.9&nbsp;million to 4&nbsp;million.

Active immigration and asylum politics in West Berlin triggered waves of immigration in the 1960s and 1970s. Currently, Berlin is home to about 200,000 [[Turks in Germany|Turks]],<ref name="250k Turks">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/europe/berlin-shish-and-sauerkraut-to-go-448678.html|title=Berlin: Shish And Sauerkraut To Go|first=Andrew|last=Spooner|work=The Independent |location=UK |date=13 May 2007|accessdate=24 May 2010}}</ref> making it the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey.

===City state===
[[File:Berlin Rotes Rathaus B.JPG|thumb|left|[[Rotes Rathaus]], seat of the Berlin Senate]]

Since [[German reunification|the reunification]] on 3 October 1990, Berlin has been one of the three [[States of Germany#Subdivisions|city states in Germany]] among the present 16 states of Germany. The city and state parliament is the [[Abgeordnetenhaus von Berlin|House of Representatives]] (''Abgeordnetenhaus''), which currently has 141 seats. Berlin's executive body is the [[Senate of Berlin]] (''Senat von Berlin''). The Senate of Berlin consists of the [[List of mayors of Berlin|Governing Mayor]] (''Regierender Bürgermeister'') and up to eight senators holding ministerial positions, one of them holding the official title "Mayor" (''Bürgermeister'') as deputy to the Governing Mayor.

The [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) and [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] (Die Linke) took control of the city government after the [[Berlin state election, 2001|2001 state election]] and won another term in the [[Berlin state election, 2006|2006 state election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistik-berlin.de/produkte/Faltblatt_Brochure/berlin_in_Zahlen_engl.pdf|title=Berlin state election, 2006|work=Der Landeswahlleiter für Berlin|accessdate=17 August 2008|language=German}}</ref> Since the [[Berlin state election, 2011|2011 state election]], there has been a coalition of the Social Democratic Party with the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]], and for the first time ever, the [[Piratenpartei Deutschland|Pirate Party]] won seats in a state parliament in Germany.

The Governing Mayor is simultaneously Lord Mayor of the city (''Oberbürgermeister der Stadt'') and Prime Minister of the Federal State (''Ministerpräsident des Bundeslandes''). The office of Berlin's Governing Mayor is in the [[Rotes Rathaus|Rotes Rathaus (Red City Hall)]]. Since 2014 this office has been held by Michael Müller of the SPD.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2051103,00.html|title=The Glamor Guy|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time Europe]]|date=8 May 2005|accessdate=17 August 2008}} See also: {{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/23/world/europe/23wowereit.html?ex=1161489600&en=2129daf9965bf613&ei=5070|title=Berlin Mayor, Symbol of Openness, Has National Appeal|work=The New York Times|accessdate=17 August 2008|first=Mark|last=Landler|date=23 September 2006}}</ref> On 26 August 2014, Wowereit announced his resignation as of 11 December 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Klaus Wowereits Rücktritt: "Ich stelle mein Amt zur Verfügung"|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/klaus-wowereit-ruecktritt-als-regierender-buergermeister-a-988154.html|website=Spiegel Online|accessdate=30 August 2014}}</ref>

===Boroughs===
{{Main|Boroughs and localities of Berlin}}
[[File:Berlin Subdivisions.svg|thumb|280px|[[Boroughs and localities of Berlin|Berlin's twelve boroughs and their 96 localities]].]]

Berlin is subdivided into twelve boroughs (''Bezirke''). Each borough contains a number of localities (''Ortsteile''), which often have historic roots in older municipalities that predate the formation of Greater Berlin on 1 October 1920 and became urbanized and incorporated into the city. Many residents strongly identify with their localities or boroughs. At present Berlin consists of 96 localities, which are commonly made up of several city neighborhoods—called ''[[Kiez]]'' in the [[Berlin dialect]]—representing small residential areas.

Each borough is governed by a borough council (''Bezirksamt'') consisting of five councilors (''Bezirksstadträte'') including the borough mayor (''Bezirksbürgermeister''). The borough council is elected by the borough assembly (''Bezirksverordnetenversammlung''). The boroughs of Berlin are not independent municipalities. <!-- ([[urban district]], ''Stadtkreis'') --> The power of borough administration is limited and subordinate to the Senate of Berlin. The borough mayors form the council of mayors (''Rat der Bürgermeister''), led by the city's governing mayor, which advises the senate. The localities have no local government bodies.

===Sister cities===
{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany}}

Berlin maintains official partnerships with 17 cities.<ref name=Berlinsistercities>{{cite web|url=http://www.berlin.de/rbmskzl/en/international-relations/city-partnerships/ |title=City Partnerships |type=official web site |publisher=Governing Mayor of Berlin, Senate Chancellery, Directorate for Protocol and International Relations |website=Berlin.de |accessdate=16 November 2014}}</ref> [[Twin towns and sister cities|Town twinning]] between Berlin and other cities began with sister city Los Angeles in 1967. East Berlin's partnerships were canceled at the time of German reunification and later partially reestablished. West Berlin's partnerships had previously been restricted to the borough level. During the Cold War era, the partnerships had reflected the different power blocs, with West Berlin partnering with capitals in the West, and East Berlin mostly partnering with cities from the [[Warsaw Pact]] and its allies.

There are several joint projects with many other cities, such as [[Beirut]], [[Belgrade]], [[São Paulo]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Helsinki]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Mumbai]], [[Oslo]], [[Shanghai]], [[Seoul]], [[Sofia]], [[Sydney]], [[New York City]] and [[Vienna]]. Berlin participates in international city associations such as the Union of the Capitals of the European Union, Eurocities, Network of European Cities of Culture, Metropolis, Summit Conference of the World's Major Cities, and Conference of the World's Capital Cities.

===Capital city===

Berlin is the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany. The [[President of Germany]], whose functions are mainly ceremonial under the [[Grundgesetz|German constitution]], has his official residence in [[Schloss Bellevue]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bundespraesident.de/DE/Home/home_node.html |title=Bundespräsident Horst Köhler |language=de |publisher=Bundespraesident.de |accessdate=7 April 2012}}</ref> Berlin is the seat of the [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|German executive]], housed in the [[German Chancellery|Chancellery]], the ''Bundeskanzleramt'' ("White House" of Germany).

Berlin has two commercial airports. [[Berlin Tegel Airport]] (TXL), which lies within the city limits, and [[Schönefeld Airport]] (SXF), which is situated just outside Berlin's south-eastern border in the state of Brandenburg. Both airports together handled 26.3 million passengers in 2013. In 2014, 67 airlines served 163 destinations in 50 countries from Berlin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berlin-airport.de/en/press/press-releases/2014/2014-03-28-summer-flight-schedule/index.php|title=2014 summer flight schedule|work=FBB|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref> Tegel Airport is an important transfer hub for [[Air Berlin]] as well as a focus city for [[Lufthansa]] and [[Germanwings]], whereas Schönefeld serves as an important destination for airlines like [[easyJet]].

[[Berlin Brandenburg Airport]] (BER) will replace Tegel as single commercial airport of Berlin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berlin-airport.de/EN/BBI/|title=Airport Berlin Brandenburg International|work=Airports Berlin|accessdate=7 July 2010}}</ref> The new airport will integrate old Schönefeld (SXF) facilities and is scheduled to open not before 2017. Because of the rapid passenger growth at Berlin airports the capacities at the BER are already considered too small for the projected demand.

;Cycling

===Energy===
[[File:Berlin-mitte heizkraftwerk-mitte 20060605 629.jpg|thumb|Heat and power plant Heizkraftwerk Mitte]]

Berlin's energy is mainly supplied by the Swedish firm [[Vattenfall]], which relies more heavily than other electricity producers on [[lignite]] as an energy source. Because burning lignite produces harmful emissions, Vattenfall has announced its commitment to transitioning to cleaner sources, such as [[renewable energy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taz.de/index.php?id=archivseite&dig=2006/05/30/a0166|title=Abgase tiefer gelegt|first=Nick|last=Reimer|work=[[Die Tageszeitung|taz]]|date=30 May 2006|accessdate=18 August 2008|language=German}}</ref> In the former West Berlin, electricity was supplied chiefly by thermal power stations. To facilitate buffering during load peaks, [[Accumulator (energy)|accumulators]] were installed during the 1980s at some of these power stations. These were connected by static inverters to the power grid and were loaded during times of low energy consumption and unloaded during periods of high consumption.

In 1993 the power grid connections to the surrounding areas were restored. In the western districts of Berlin, nearly all power lines are underground cables; only a 380&nbsp;kV and a 110&nbsp;kV line, which run from Reuter substation to the urban [[Autobahn]], use overhead lines. The [[Berlin 380-kV electric line]] was built when West Berlin's electrical grid was not connected to those of East or West Germany. This has now become the backbone of the city's energy grid.

===Nightlife and festivals===
[[File:Franzoesischer Dom - Festival of Lights 2011.jpg|thumb|upright|[[French Cathedral, Berlin|French Cathedral]] during the annual [[Festival of Lights (Berlin)|Festival of Lights]]]]

Berlin's nightlife is one of the most diverse and vibrant of its kind in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=6949|title=Losing your mind in Berlin|first=Walter|last=Wasacz|work=[[Metro Times]]|date=11 October 2004|accessdate=18 November 2006}}</ref> Throughout the 1990s, people in their 20s from many countries, particularly those in Western and Central Europe, made Berlin's club scene a premier nightlife venue. After the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] in 1989, many historic buildings in Mitte, the former city centre of East Berlin, were illegally occupied and re-built by young squatters and became a fertile ground for underground and [[counterculture]] gatherings. The central boroughs are home to many nightclubs, including the clubs Watergate, [[Tresor]], [[E-Werk]], and [[Berghain]]. The [[KitKatClub]] and several other locations are known for sexually uninhibited parties.

Clubs are not required to close at a fixed time on the weekends, and many parties last well into the morning, or all weekend. ''Berghain'' features the ''Panorama Bar'', a bar that opens its shades at daybreak, allowing party-goers a panorama view of Berlin after dancing through the night. The ''Weekend Club'' near [[Alexanderplatz]] features a roof terrace that allows partying at almost any time of the day.

The [[SO36]] in [[Kreuzberg]] originally focused largely on [[punk music]], but today has become a venue for many performances. ''SOUND'', located from 1971 to 1988 in Tiergarten gained notoriety in the late 1970s for its drug users.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://christiane.hurz.at/ |title=Christiane F.-Page |publisher=Christiane.hurz.at |accessdate=7 April 2012}}</ref>

Berlin is home to 44 theaters and stages.<ref name="factsheet"/> The [[Deutsches Theater]] in Mitte was built in 1849–50 and has operated continuously since then, except for a one-year break (1944–45) due to the Second World War. The [[Volksbühne]] at [[Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz]] was built in 1913–14, though the company had been founded in 1890. The [[Berliner Ensemble]], famous for performing the works of [[Bertolt Brecht]], was established in 1949, not far from the Deutsches Theater. The [[Schaubühne]] was founded in 1962 in a building in Kreuzberg, but in 1981 moved to the building of the former Universum Cinema on Kurfürstendamm. With a seating capacity of 1,891 and a stage floor of 2,854 square meters (30,720 sq ft) the Friedrichstadt-Palast is the largest show palace in Europe.
