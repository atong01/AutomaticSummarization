They attended segregated schools, which were typically underfunded in Mississippi.</paragraph><paragraph>During<space/><link><target>World War II</target></link>, Charles and Medgar Evers both served in the<space/><link><target>United States Army</target></link>. Charles fell in love with a<space/><link><target>Filipino people</target><part>Filipino</part></link><space/>woman while stationed overseas. He could not marry her and bring her home to his native Mississippi because the state had prohibited interracial marriages. Mississippi's 1890 constitution also had effectively<space/><link><target>Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era</target><part>disenfranchised</part></link><space/>blacks and many poor whites by requiring payment of a<space/><link><target>Poll tax (United States)</target><part>poll tax</part></link><space/>and passing a<space/><link><target>literacy test</target></link><space/>to register to vote. This exclusion from the political system was largely enforced against African Americans until after passage of the federal<space/><link><target>Voting Rights Act of 1965</target></link>, which authorized federal oversight and enforcement of constitutional rights. African Americans continue to vote at a high rate in Mississippi.</paragraph><paragraph>Before and after the war, Evers participated in bootlegging operations, prostitution, and numbers in Mississippi and<space/><link><target>Chicago</target></link>. He revealed this part of his past in 1971 prior to his campaign for governor. He said he was not proud of it, but was proud that he had changed his life and left such crime activities far behind.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Career</heading><paragraph>In Mississippi about 1951, brothers Charles and Medgar Evers grew interested in African freedom movements. They were interested in<space/><link><target>Jomo Kenyatta</target></link><space/>and the rise of the<space/><link><target>Kikuyu people</target><part>Kikuyu</part></link><space/>tribal resistance to colonialism in<space/><link><target>Kenya</target></link>, known as the &quot;<link><target>Mau-Mau</target></link>&quot; Rebellion as it moved to open violence. Along with his brother, Charles became active in the<space/><link><target>Regional Council of Negro Leadership</target></link><space/>(RCNL), a civil rights organization that also promoted self-help and business ownership. He drew inspiration from Dr.<space/><link><target>T. R. M. Howard</target></link>, the president of the RCNL, who was one of the wealthiest blacks in the state. Between 1952 and 1955, Evers often spoke at the RCNL's annual conferences in<space/><link><target>Mound Bayou, Mississippi</target><part>Mound Bayou</part></link><space/>on such issues as voting rights.</paragraph><paragraph>Around 1956, Evers' entrepreneurial gifts and his civil rights activism landed him in trouble in<space/><link><target>Philadelphia, Mississippi</target><part>Philadelphia</part></link>, Mississippi. He left town and moved to<space/><link><target>Chicago</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Illinois</target></link>.

Evers died in an ambulance on the way to the hospital. Charles was shocked and deeply upset by his brother's assassination. Over the opposition of more establishment figures in the<space/><link><target>National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</target></link><space/>(NAACP) such as<space/><link><target>Roy Wilkins</target></link>, Charles took over Medgar's post as head of the<space/><link><target>NAACP</target></link><space/>in Mississippi.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1969, following passage of the federal<space/><link><target>Voting Rights Act of 1965</target></link>, which restored the ability of African Americans to vote in the state, Charles Evers was elected<space/><link><target>mayor</target></link><space/>of<space/><link><target>Fayette, Mississippi</target></link>. He was the first<space/><link><target>African-American</target></link><space/>mayor elected in his state since<space/><link><target>Reconstruction era of the United States</target><part>Reconstruction</part></link>. Fayette had a majority of black residents. It had no industry, so had attracted few new residents from outside the area. Its minority white community was known to be hostile toward blacks.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">June 2015</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Evers' election as mayor had enormous symbolic significance statewide and national resonance. The NAACP named Evers the 1969 Man of the Year. Author<space/><link><target>John Updike</target></link><space/>mentioned Evers in his popular novel<space/><italics><link><target>Rabbit Redux</target></link></italics><space/>(1971). Evers popularized the slogan, &quot;Hands that picked cotton can now pick the mayor.&quot;<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">June 2015</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Evers served many terms as mayor of Fayette. Admired by some, he alienated others with his inflexible stands on various issues. Evers did not like to share or delegate power. Kenneth Middleton, a political rival who finally defeated Evers in a mayoral election, used the slogan: &quot;We've seen what Fayette can do for one man. Now let's see what one man can do for Fayette.&quot;<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">June 2015</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>In 1971 Evers ran in the gubernatorial<space/><link><target>general election</target></link><space/>but was defeated by Democrat<space/><link><target>Bill Waller</target><part>William &quot;Bill&quot; Waller</part></link>, 601,222 (77 percent) to 172,762 (22.1 percent). Waller had prosecuted the murder case of suspect Byron De La Beckwith. When Waller gave a victory speech on election night, Evers drove across town to a local TV station to congratulate him. A reporter later wrote that &quot;Waller's aides learned Evers was in the building and tried to hustle the governor-elect out of the studio as soon as the interview ended. They were not quite quick enough. Surrounded by photographers, reporters, and television crews, Evers approached Waller's car just as it was about to pull out. Waller and his wife were in the back seat. 'I just wanted to congratulate you,' said Evers. 'Whaddya say, Charlie?' boomed Waller. His wife leaned across with a stiff smile and shook the loser's hand.&quot; During the campaign Evers told reporters that his main purpose in running was to encourage registration of black voters.<extension extension_name='ref'>Thomas Powers, &quot;Letter from a Lost Campaign,&quot; Harper's Magazine, March 1972.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>In 1978, Evers ran as an Independent for the US Senate seat vacated by Democrat<space/><link><target>James O.

He received 24 percent of the votemore than likely siphoning off African-American votes that would have otherwise gone to Dantin. Cochran won the election with a plurality of 45 percent of the vote.
