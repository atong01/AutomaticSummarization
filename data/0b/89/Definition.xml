The name &quot;<link><target>hobbit</target></link>&quot;, for example, is perfectly meaningful. It has a<space/><italics>quid nominis</italics>. But one could not know the real nature of hobbits, even if there were such things, and so the real nature or<space/><italics>quid rei</italics><space/>of hobbits cannot be known. By contrast, the name &quot;man&quot; denotes real things (men) that have a certain<space/><italics>quid rei</italics>. The meaning of a name is distinct from the nature that thing must have in order that the name apply to it.</paragraph><paragraph>This leads to a corresponding distinction between<space/><italics>nominal</italics><space/>and<space/><italics>real</italics><space/>definitions. A nominal definition is the definition explaining what a word means, i.e. which says what the &quot;nominal essence&quot; is, and is definition in the classical sense as given above.
