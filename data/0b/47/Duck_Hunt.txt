{{nihongo|'''''Duck Hunt'''''|ダックハント|Dakku Hanto|lead=yes}} is a [[light gun shooter]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) [[video game console]]. First released in Japan on April 21, 1984, it was later released on October 18, 1985 in North America as a [[launch game]] for the NES, and on August 15, 1987 in Europe. The game was released as a [[Virtual Console]] title for the [[Wii U]] in 2014.<ref name="nintendo direct"/>

In ''Duck Hunt'', players use the [[NES Zapper]] to shoot [[duck]]s that appear on the television screen. The ducks appear one or two at a time, and the player is given three shots to shoot them down. The player receives points upon shooting each duck. If the player shoots the required number of ducks in a single [[level (video gaming)|round]], the player will advance to the next round; otherwise, the player will receive a [[game over]].

The game initially received few reviews, but was given mild critical praise and elicited a positive gamer reaction.<ref name="Allgame review"/><ref name="Gamespot people"/> Prior to the NES version, Nintendo also made a ''Duck Hunt'' game based on [[Laser Clay Shooting System]] released in 1976.<ref>[http://www.japan-games.com/Database/images/Nintendo/TV-Game/Duckhunt/index.htm Nintendo Duck Hunt (1976)]</ref> The game would later be a [[pack-in game]], being a dual game pack with this game and ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', and later a triple game with the same two games plus ''[[World Class Track Meet]]''.

==Gameplay==
{{Imageframe|align=left|width=180|content=[[File:Duck hunt pic.PNG|180px]]<br />[[File:Clay.PNG|180px]]|caption=''Duck Hunt'' offers different game modes, with two focused on shooting [[duck]]s (top) and the other focused on shooting [[Clay pigeon shooting|clay pigeons]] (bottom). In all modes, the player has three attempts to shoot the on-screen targets when they appear.}}

''Duck Hunt'' is a [[shooter game]] in which the objective is to shoot moving targets on the television screen in mid-flight. The game is played from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] perspective and requires the [[NES Zapper]] [[light gun]], which the player aims and fires at the screen. Each [[Level (video gaming)|round]] consists of a total of ten targets to shoot. Depending on the [[Game mechanics#Game modes|game mode]] the player selects prior to beginning play, one or two targets will appear on the screen at any given time and the player has three shots, or attempts, to hit them before they disappear.<ref name="Duck Hunt rules">{{cite web|title='Duck Hunt'|url=http://www.nindb.net/game/duck-hunt.html|accessdate=2006-11-21|date=|work=[http://www.nindb.net/ NinDB]}}</ref>

The player is required to successfully shoot a minimum number of targets in order to advance to the next round; failure will result in a [[game over]]. The [[Balance (game design)#Difficulty level|difficulty]] increases as the player advances to higher rounds; targets will move faster and the minimum number of targets to shoot will increase. The player receives [[Score (game)|points]] upon shooting a target and will also receive bonus points for shooting all ten targets in a single round. ''Duck Hunt'' keeps track of the players' [[Score (game)#High score|highest score]] for all games played in a single session; it is lost, however, upon shutting the game off.

''Duck Hunt'' has three different game modes to choose from. In "Game A" and "Game B", the targets are flying [[duck]]s in a woodland area, and in "Game C" the targets are [[Clay pigeon shooting|clay pigeon]]s that are fired away from the player's perspective into the distance. In "Game A", one duck will appear on the screen at a time while in "Game B" two ducks will appear at a time.<ref name="Duck Hunt rules"/> "Game A" allows a [[multiplayer|second player]] to control the movement of the flying ducks by using a normal [[Nintendo Entertainment System#Controllers|NES controller]].<ref name="cheats">{{cite web |url=http://cheats.ign.com/ob2/068/007/007158.html |title=Duck Hunt Cheats |accessdate=2006-11-21|publisher=IGN}}</ref> The gameplay starts at Round 1 and may continue up to Round 99. If the player completes Round 99, he or she will advance to Round 0, which is a [[kill screen]] (in "Game A") where the game behaves erratically, such as targets that move haphazardly or don't appear at all, and eventually ends.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://satoshimatrix.wordpress.com/2011/08/17/top-100-nesfamicom-games-list-100-90/ |title=Top 100 NES/Famicom Games List #100-90 |work=Retro and Contemporary Gaming Archives |date=2011-08-17}}</ref>

===Vs. Duck Hunt===
''Duck Hunt'' was also released as an [[arcade game]] in the [[Nintendo Vs. System|''Nintendo Vs.'' series]] in 1984<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20090202191217/http://www.arcadevault.com/duck_hunt_2.html ''Duck Hunt'' at Arcade Vault]. Retrieved November 21, 2006.</ref> as ''Vs. Duck Hunt'', and is included in the [[PlayChoice-10]] arcade console.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gamersgraveyard.com/repository/nes/history/nes_arcade.html |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061210021100/http://www.gamersgraveyard.com/repository/nes/history/nes_arcade.html |archivedate= 2006-12-10|publisher=Playchoice |title= PlayChoice History|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> The console supports two light guns, allowing two players at once.

Gameplay consists of alternating rounds of Games B and C, with 12 ducks/targets per round instead of 10 and sometimes requires the player to shoot three ducks/targets at a time instead of two. In addition, the player is given a limited number of lives; every duck/target that is not hit costs one life. When all lives are gone, the game ends.

After every second round, a bonus stage is played in which ducks can be shot for points as they fly out of the grass. However, the [[hunting dog]] occasionally jumps out, putting himself in the line of fire and creating a distraction. If the player shoots the dog, the bonus stage immediately ends.

==Development and release==
[[File:NES-zapper.jpg|thumb|right|The [[NES Zapper]] is required for playing ''Duck Hunt''.]]
''Duck Hunt'' is based on a 1976 electronic toy version titled ''Beam Gun: Duck Hunt'', part of the ''Beam Gun'' series.<ref name="wired">{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2007/02/video_1976_duck/|title=Video: 1976 Duck Hunt|last=Kohler|first=Chris|date=27 February 2007|work=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|accessdate=23 January 2014}}</ref> The toy version was designed by [[Gunpei Yokoi]] and [[Masayuki Uemura]] for Nintendo.<ref name="wired"/> [[Nintendo Research & Development 1]] developed both ''Duck Hunt'' for the NES and the [[NES Zapper]].

''Duck Hunt'' has been placed in several combination [[ROM cartridge]]s.

In ''[[Wii Play]]'' (2006) and its sequel ''[[Wii Play: Motion]]'' (2011) some elements from ''Duck Hunt'' and ''[[Hogan's Alley (video game)|Hogan's Alley]]'' are included in the mini-games "Shooting Range" and "Trigger Twist" in which some of the various targets are ducks and cans.

In the 2014 [[fighting game]]s [[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U|''Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS'' and ''Wii U'']], the dog and one of the ducks appear collectively as playable characters under the name "Duck Hunt (Duo)".
