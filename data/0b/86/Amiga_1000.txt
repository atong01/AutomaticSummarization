The '''Commodore Amiga 1000''', also known as the '''A1000''' and originally simply as the '''Amiga''', was the first [[personal computer]] release by [[Commodore International]] in the [[Amiga]] line. It combined the powerful 16/32-bit [[Motorola 68000]] [[central processing unit|CPU]] with one of the most advanced graphics and sound systems in its class, and ran a [[preemption (computing)|preemptive]] [[computer multitasking|multitasking]] [[operating system]] that fit into {{nowrap|512 KB}} of memory.<ref>{{cite magazine|publisher=PC Magazine |date=October 22, 1996 |title=Inside Track |author=John C. Dvorak |quote=The AmigaOS "remains one of the great operating systems of the past 20 years, incorporating a small kernel and tremendous [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] capabilities the likes of which have only recently been developed in [[OS/2]] and [[Windows NT]]. The biggest difference is that the AmigaOS could operate fully and multitask in as little as 256K of address space. Even today, the OS is only about 1MB in size. And to this day, there is very little a memory-hogging CD-ROM-loading OS can do the Amiga can't. Tight code — there's nothing like it.<br>
I've had an Amiga for maybe a decade. It's the single most reliable piece of equipment I've ever owned. It's amazing! You can easily understand why so many fanatics are out there wondering why they are alone in their love of the thing. The Amiga continues to inspire a vibrant — albeit cultlike — community, not unlike that which you have with Linux, the Unix clone.}}</ref><ref>256&nbsp;KB [[Read-only memory|ROM]] + 256&nbsp;KB [[Random access memory|RAM]]</ref>

== Design ==
The A1000 has a number of characteristics that distinguish it from later Amiga models: It is the only model to feature the short-lived Amiga "check mark" logo on its case, the case is elevated slightly to give a storage area for the keyboard when not in use (a "keyboard garage"), and the inside of the case is engraved with the signatures of the Amiga designers (similar to the [[Macintosh 128K|Macintosh]]); including [[Jay Miner]] and the paw print of his dog Mitchy. The A1000's case was designed by [[Howard Stolz]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/classes/ism101/Winter05/abstracts/week1.html | title=ISM 101 Seminar: 13 January 2005 | work=USCS Engineering | accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref>  As Senior Industrial Designer at Commodore, Stolz was the mechanical lead and primary interface with [[Sanyo]] in Japan, the contract manufacturer for the A1000 casing.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.linkedin.com/in/howardstolz | title=Howard Stolz profile | work=Howard Stolz LinkedIn profile | accessdate=2009-06-28}}</ref>

The Amiga 1000 was manufactured in two variations:  One used the [[NTSC]] television standard and the other used the [[PAL]] television standard. The NTSC variant was the initial model manufactured and sold in [[North America]]. The later PAL model was manufactured in Germany and sold in countries using the PAL television standard. The first NTSC systems lack the [[Amiga Halfbrite mode|EHB video mode]] which is present in all later Amiga models.

Because [[AmigaOS]] was rather [[Software bug|buggy]] at the time of the A1000's release, the OS was not placed in ROM. Instead, the A1000 included a [[daughterboard]] with 256&nbsp;[[kilobyte|KB]] of RAM, dubbed the "Writable Control Store" (WCS), into which the core of the operating system was loaded from floppy disk (this portion of the operating system was known as the "[[Kickstart (Amiga)|Kickstart]]"). The WCS was write-protected after loading, and system resets did not require a reload of the WCS. In Europe, the WCS was often referred to as WOM (Write Once Memory), a play on the more conventional term "ROM" (Read Only Memory).

== Technical information ==
The pre-production Amiga (which were codenamed "Velvet") released to developers in early 1985 contained 128KB of RAM with an option to expand it to 256KB. Commodore later increased the system memory to 256KB due to objections by the Amiga development team. The names of the custom chips were different, Denise and Paula was called Daphne and Portia respectively.  The casing of pre-production Amiga was almost identical to the production version, the main difference was a embossed Commodore logo in the top left corner. It did not have the developer signatures or the carry handle. <ref>{{Cite web|title = Amiga 1000 Developer "VELVET" - computer collection vienna ENG|url = http://scacom.bplaced.net/Collection/velvet/velveten.php|website = scacom.bplaced.net|accessdate = 2015-08-23|first = Stefan|last = Egger}}</ref>

The Amiga 1000 has a Motorola 68000 CPU running at 7.15909&nbsp;MHz (on [[NTSC]] systems) or 7.09379&nbsp;MHz ([[PAL]] systems), precisely double the video color carrier frequency for NTSC or 1.6 times the color carrier frequency for PAL. The system clock timings are derived from the video frequency, which simplifies [[glue logic]] and allows the Amiga 1000 to make do with a single [[crystal oscillator|crystal]]. In keeping with its video game heritage, the chipset was designed to synchronize CPU memory access and chipset [[Direct memory access|DMA]] so the hardware runs in real-time without wait-state delays.

Though most units were sold with an analog [[RGB color model|RGB]] monitor, the A1000 also had a built-in [[composite video]] output which allowed the computer to be connected directly to monitors other than their standard RGB monitor. The A1000 also had a "TV MOD" output, into which an RF Modulator could be plugged in, allowing connection to a standard [[Television|TV]] or [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]].

The original 68000 CPU can be directly replaced with a [[Motorola 68010]], which can execute instructions slightly faster than the 68000 but also introduces a small degree of software incompatibility. Third-party CPU upgrades, which mostly fit in the CPU socket, use faster 68020/68881 or 68030/68882 microprocessors and integrated memory. Such upgrades often have the option to revert to 68000 mode for full compatibility. Some boards have a socket to seat the original 68000, whereas the 68030 cards typically come with an on-board 68000.

The original Amiga 1000 is the only model to have 256&nbsp;[[kilobyte|KB]] of [[Amiga Chip RAM]], which can be expanded to 512&nbsp;KB with the addition of a [[daughterboard]] under a cover in the centre front of the machine.<ref name="a1000_intro">{{Cite journal | url=http://www.bombjack.org/commodore/amiga/amiga-commodore/Amiga_1000_Introduction.pdf | title=Introduction to the Amiga | publisher=Commodore-Amiga, Inc. | year=1986 }}</ref>{{inconsistent citations}} RAM may also be upgraded via official and third-party upgrades, with a practical upper limit of about 9 [[Megabyte|MB]] of "fast" RAM due to the 68000's 24-bit [[address bus]]. This memory is accessible only by the CPU permitting faster code execution as DMA cycles are not shared with the chipset.

The Amiga 1000 features an 86-pin expansion port (electrically identical to the later [[Amiga 500]] expansion port, though the A500's connector is inverted). This port was utilized by third-party expansions such as memory upgrades and [[SCSI]] adaptors. These resources are handled by the Amiga [[Autoconfig]] standard. Other expansion options were available including a bus expander which provided two [[Amiga Zorro II|Zorro-II]] slots.

== Retail ==
Introduced on July 23, 1985 during a star-studded gala featuring [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Debbie Harry]] held at the [[Vivian Beaumont Theater]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LxMCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15|title=New York Magazine Aug 5, 1985}}</ref> at [[Lincoln Center]] in [[New York City]], machines began shipping in September with a base configuration of 256&nbsp;KB of RAM at the retail price of {{US$|1,295}}. A {{convert|13|in|mm|adj=on}} analog [[Computer monitor|RGB monitor]] was available for around {{US$|300}}, bringing the price of a complete Amiga system to 1,595 USD. Before the release of the [[Amiga 500]] and [[Amiga 2000]] models in 1987, the A1000 was simply called ''Amiga''.

In the US, the A1000 was marketed as ''The Amiga from Commodore'', with the Commodore logo omitted from the case. The Commodore branding was retained for the international versions.  

Additionally, the Amiga 1000 was sold exclusively in computer stores in the US rather than the various non computer-dedicated department and toy stores through which the [[Commodore VIC-20|VIC-20]] and [[Commodore 64]] were retailed. These measures were an effort to avoid Commodore's "toy-store" computer image created during the [[Jack Tramiel|Tramiel]] era.<ref>{{cite news | url =http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=technology&res=9A01EFDC1038F93AA1575BC0A962948260&scp=5&sq=amiga&st=nyt | title = Amiga's High-Tech Gamble | accessdate = 2008-04-11 | first = Susan | last = Chira | work = New York Times, August 29, 1984 | date=August 29, 1984}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | last=Starfire | first=Brian | title=Commodore in tough market with new personal computer | newspaper=The Evening Independent (Dallas Morning News) | date=September 13, 1985| url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&dat=19850913&id=5-cLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZFkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5279,3001216 }}</ref> 

Along with the operating system, the machine came bundled with a version of [[AmigaBASIC]] developed by [[Microsoft]] and a speech synthesis library developed by [[Softvoice, Inc]].

== Aftermarket upgrades ==
Many A1000 owners remained attached to their machines long after newer models rendered the units technically obsolete, and it attracted numerous aftermarket upgrades. Many CPU upgrades that plugged into the [[Motorola 68000]] socket functioned in the A1000. Additionally, a line of products called the ''Rejuvenator'' series allowed the use of newer chipsets in the A1000, and an [[Australia]]n-designed replacement A1000 motherboard called ''The Phoenix'' utilized the same chipset as the A3000 and added an A2000-compatible video slot and on-board [[SCSI]] controller.

== Impact ==
In 1994, as Commodore filed for bankruptcy, ''[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]]'' magazine called the Amiga 1000 "the first [[multimedia computer]]... so far ahead of its time that almost nobody—including Commodore's marketing department—could fully articulate what it was all about".<ref>{{cite web|last=Halfhill |first=Tom |url=http://web.archive.org/web/19961019193808/http://byte.com/art/9408/sec14/art1.htm |title=R.I.P. Commodore 1954-1994|publisher=Byte |date=August 1994 |accessdate=2015-01-22}}</ref>

In 2006, [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] rated the Amiga 1000 as the 7th greatest PC of all time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Editors |first=The |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20060828031746/http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,126692-page,8-c,systems/article.html |title=The 25 Greatest PCs of All Time &#124; TechHive |publisher=Pcworld.com |date= |accessdate=2015-01-22}}</ref> In 2007, it was rated by the same magazine as the 37th best tech product of all time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Null |first=Christopher |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,130207-page,9-c,technology/article.html |title=The 50 Best Tech Products of All Time |publisher=PCWorld |date= |accessdate=2013-07-24}}</ref>
