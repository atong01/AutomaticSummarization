Crosby was initially a member of a vocal trio called The Three Harmony Aces with Al Rinker accompanying on piano from the pit, to entertain between the films. Bing and Al continued at the Clemmer Theatre for several months often with three other men - Wee Georgie Crittenden, Frank McBride and Lloyd Grinnell - and they were billed as The Clemmer Trio or The Clemmer Entertainers depending which men were used.<extension extension_name='ref' name="macfarlane2001"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="first">Malcolm</arg><arg name="last">Macfarlane</arg><arg name="title">Bing Crosby: Day by Day</arg><arg name="year">2001</arg></template><space/>|url=http://www.bingmagazine.co.uk/bingmagazine/1903-1935.htm</extension></paragraph><paragraph>In October 1925, Crosby and his partner<space/><link><target>Al Rinker</target></link>, brother of singer<space/><link><target>Mildred Bailey</target></link><space/>decided to seek fame in California and they traveled to Los Angeles where they met up with Mildred Bailey. She introduced them to her show business contacts and the Fanchon and Marco Time Agency hired them for thirteen weeks to take part in a revue called The Syncopation Idea, starting at the Boulevard Theater in Los Angeles and then on the Loews circuit. They each earned $75 a week. Bing and Al Rinker began as a minor part of The Syncopation Idea and it was there that they started to develop as entertainers. They had a lively and individual style and they were particularly popular with college students. After The Syncopation Idea closed, Bing and Al obtained work in the Will Morrissey Music Hall Revue which must have been fascinating if insecure. However, their skills were further honed during their time with Morrissey and when they subsequently had the chance to present their own independent act, they blossomed and were quickly spotted by the<space/><link><target>Paul Whiteman</target></link><space/>organization. At that time, it was felt that Whiteman needed something different and entertaining to break up the musical selections he was presenting and Crosby and Rinker filled this requirement admirably. After less than a year in full-time show business, they had become part of one of the biggest names in the entertainment world.<extension extension_name='ref' name="macfarlane2001"></extension><space/>Hired for $150 a week in 1926, they made their debut with Whiteman on December 6 at the<space/><link><target>Tivoli Theatre (Chicago)</target><part>Tivoli Theatre</part></link><space/>in Chicago. Their first recording, in October 1926, was &quot;I've Got the Girl&quot;, with Don Clark's Orchestra, but the Columbia-issued record did them no vocal favors, as it was inadvertently recorded at a speed slower than it should have been, which increased the singers' pitch when played at 78 rpm. Throughout his career, Crosby often credited Mildred Bailey for getting him his first important job in the entertainment business.<extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.redhotjazz.com/rhythmboys.html</extension></paragraph><heading level='4'>The Rhythm Boys</heading><paragraph>Initial successes with Whiteman were followed by disaster when they reached New York and for a while Whiteman must have thought of letting them go. Possibly Bing might have been retained as Whiteman was already using him as a solo performer on record, but the prospects for Rinker must have been bleak. However, the addition of pianist and aspiring songwriter<space/><link><target>Harry Barris</target></link><space/>made all the difference to the act and &quot;<link><target>The Rhythm Boys</target></link>&quot; were born. The additional voice meant that the boys could be heard more easily in the large New York theaters and they quickly became a real success. A year touring with Whiteman performing and recording with musicians<space/><link><target>Bix Beiderbecke</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Jack Teagarden</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Tommy Dorsey</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Jimmy Dorsey</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Eddie Lang</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Hoagy Carmichael</target></link>, provided valuable experience and then they were sent out on tour alone. Much has been written about the escapades of the three men during this period and clearly they were living life to the full. Despite all of this, Bing was continuing to develop and when the Rhythm Boys rejoined the Whiteman troupe in 1929, he had matured considerably as a performer. He was constantly in demand as a solo artist on record and radio.</paragraph><paragraph>Crosby soon became the star attraction of<space/><link><target>the Rhythm Boys</target></link>, and in 1928 he had his first number one hit with the Whiteman orchestra, a jazz-influenced rendition of &quot;<link><target>Ol' Man River</target></link>&quot;. In 1929,<space/><link><target>the Rhythm Boys</target></link><space/>appeared in the film<space/><link><target>The King of Jazz</target></link><space/>with Whiteman but Bing's growing dissatisfaction with Whiteman led to<space/><link><target>the Rhythm Boys</target></link><space/>leaving his organization. They joined the<space/><link><target>Gus Arnheim</target></link><space/>Orchestra performing nightly in The<space/><link><target>Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)</target><part>Cocoanut Grove</part></link><space/>of the Ambassador Hotel. Singing with the Arnheim Orchestra, Bings solos began to steal the show, while the Rhythm Boys act gradually became redundant. Harry Barris wrote several of Crosby's subsequent hits including &quot;At Your Command&quot;, &quot;<link><target>I Surrender Dear</target></link>&quot;, and &quot;<link><target>Wrap Your Troubles In Dreams (song)</target><part>Wrap Your Troubles In Dreams</part></link>&quot;. In the early months of 1931, a solo recording contract came Bings way,<space/><link><target>Mack Sennett</target></link><space/>signed him to make film shorts and a break with the Rhythm Boys became almost inevitable. Bing had married Dixie Lee in September 1930 and after a threatened divorce in March 1931, he started to apply himself seriously to his career. His gramophone records in 1931 broke new ground as his powerful and emotional singing started to change the face of popular music forever.</paragraph><paragraph>Their low salaries at the Cocoanut Grove of the Ambassador Hotel had led the Rhythm Boys to walk out, causing union problems for Bing. Bing's brother, Everett, interested<space/><link><target>Bill Paley</target></link><space/>of CBS in his brother and Paley beckoned Bing to come to New York. A settlement was reached with the Ambassador Hotel and Bing made his first solo national radio broadcast in September 1931 and then went on to star at the New York Paramount Theatre.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Success as a solo singer</heading><paragraph>On September 2, 1931, Crosby made his solo radio debut.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.radiohof.org/musicvariety/bingcrosby.html<space/></arg><arg name="title">Bing Crosby, Singer<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Radio Hall of Fame<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">September 2, 2010<space/></arg><arg name="deadurl">yes<space/></arg><arg name="archiveurl">https://web.archive.org/20080923002631/http://www.radiohof.org:80/musicvariety/bingcrosby.html<space/></arg><arg name="archivedate">23 September 2008<space/></arg></template></extension><space/>Before the end of the year, he signed with both<space/><link><target>Brunswick Records</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>CBS Radio</target></link>.

The success of his first full-length film brought him a contract with Paramount and he began a regular pattern of making three films a year. On radio, he fronted his own show for Woodbury Soap for two seasons and gradually his live appearances dwindled. His records produced hit after hit at a time when record sales generally were in decline because of the Depression.

The day after he sings a song over the air - any song - some 50,000 copies of it are sold throughout the U.S. Time and again Crosby has taken some new or unknown ballad, has given it what is known in trade circles as the &quot;big goose&quot; and made it a hit single-handed and overnight.&quot; and &quot;Precisely what the future holds for Crosby neither his family nor his friends can conjecture. He has achieved greater popularity, made more money, attracted vaster audiences than any other entertainer in history. And his star is still in the ascendant. His contract with Decca runs until 1955. His contract with Paramount runs until 1954. Records which he made ten years ago are selling better than ever before. The nation's appetite for Crosby's voice and personality appears insatiable. To soldiers overseas and to foreigners he has become a kind of symbol of America, of the amiable, humorous citizen of a free land. Crosby, however, seldom bothers to contemplate his future.

The scheduling could now be done at the star's convenience. He could do four shows a week, if he chose, and then take a month off. But the networks and sponsors were adamantly opposed. The public wouldn't stand for 'canned' radio, the networks argued. There was something magic for listeners in the fact that what they were hearing was being performed and heard everywhere, at that precise instant.

But NBC (and competitor CBS) were also insistent, refusing to air prerecorded radio programs. Crosby walked away from the network and stayed off the air for seven months, creating a legal battle with<space/><link><target>Kraft Foods</target><part>Kraft</part></link>, his sponsor, that was settled out of court. Crosby returned to the air for the last 13 weeks of the 19451946 season.</paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>Mutual Broadcasting System</target><part>Mutual</part></link><space/>network, on the other hand, had pre-recorded some of its programs as early as the 1938 run of<space/><italics><link><target>The Shadow</target></link></italics><space/>with<space/><link><target>Orson Welles</target></link>. And the new<space/><link><target>American Broadcasting Company</target><part>ABC</part></link><space/>network, which had been formed out of the sale of the old<space/><link><target>NBC Blue Network</target></link><space/>in 1943 following a federal<space/><link><target>anti-trust</target></link><space/>action, was willing to join Mutual in breaking the tradition. ABC offered Crosby $30,000 per week to produce a recorded show every Wednesday that would be sponsored by<space/><link><target>Philco</target></link>.

The legend that has been most often told is that it would give him more time for his golf game. And he did record his first Philco program in August 1947 so he could enter the<space/><link><target>Jasper National Park</target></link><space/>Invitational Golf Tournament in September, just when the new radio season was to start.

Because his own Bing Crosby Enterprises produced the show, he could purchase the latest and best sound equipment and arrange the<space/><link><target>microphones</target></link><space/>his way; the logistics of microphone placement had long been a hotly debated issue in every recording studio since the beginning of the electrical era. No longer would he have to wear the hated toupee on his head previously required by<space/><link><target>CBS</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>NBC</target></link><space/>for his live audience shows (he preferred a hat). He could also record short promotions for his latest investment, the world's first frozen orange juice, sold under the brand name<space/><link><target>Minute Maid</target></link>.

Farben magnetic tape that Mullin had found at a radio station at<space/><link><target>Bad Nauheim</target></link><space/>near<space/><link><target>Frankfurt</target></link><space/>while working for the U.S. Army Signal Corps. The crucial advantage was editing. As Crosby wrote in his autobiography:<extension extension_name='blockquote'>By using tape, I could do a thirty-five or forty-minute show, then edit it down to the twenty-six or twenty-seven minutes the program ran. In that way, we could take out jokes, gags, or situations that didn't play well and finish with only the prime meat of the show; the solid stuff that played big. We could also take out the songs that didn't sound good. It gave us a chance to first try a recording of the songs in the afternoon without an audience, then another one in front of a studio audience. We'd dub the one that came off best into the final transcription. It gave us a chance to ad lib as much as we wanted, knowing that excess ad libbing could be sliced from the final product. If I made a mistake in singing a song or in the script, I could have some fun with it, then retain any of the fun that sounded amusing.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Mullin's 1976 memoir of these early days of experimental recording agrees with Crosby's account:<extension extension_name='blockquote'>In the evening, Crosby did the whole show before an audience. If he muffed a song then, the audience loved itthought it was very funnybut we would have to take out the show version and put in one of the rehearsal takes. Sometimes, if Crosby was having fun with a song and not really working at it, we had to make it up out of two or three parts. This<space/><link><target>Ad libitum</target><part>ad lib</part></link><space/>way of working is commonplace in the recording studios today, but it was all new to us.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Crosby invested US$50,000 in<space/><link><target>Ampex</target></link><space/>with an eye towards producing more machines.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Sterling, C. H. 1990"></extension><space/>In 1948, the second season of Philco shows was taped with the new Ampex Model 200 tape recorder using the new Scotch 111 tape from the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing (<link><target>3M</target></link>) company. Mullin explained how one new broadcasting technique was invented on the Crosby show with these machines:<extension extension_name='blockquote'>One time Bob Burns, the hillbilly comic, was on the show, and he threw in a few of his folksy farm stories, which of course were not in Bill Morrow's script. Today they wouldn't seem very off-color, but things were different on radio then. They got enormous laughs, which just went on and on. We couldn't use the jokes, but Bill asked us to save the laughs. A couple of weeks later he had a show that wasn't very funny, and he insisted that we put in the salvaged laughs. Thus the laugh-track was born.</extension>Crosby had launched the tape recorder revolution in America. In his 1950 film<space/><italics><link><target>Mr. Music</target></link></italics>, Crosby is seen singing into one of the new Ampex tape recorders that reproduced his voice better than anything else. Also quick to adopt tape recording was his friend<space/><link><target>Bob Hope</target></link>.

Father O'Malley handled that gang of young hooligans in his parish with such kindness and wisdom that I thought he was wonderful too. Instead of coming down hard on the kids and withdrawing his affection, he forgave them their misdeeds, took them to the ball game and picture show, taught them how to sing. By the last reel, the sheer persistence of his goodness had transformed even the worst of them into solid citizens. Then the lights came on and the movie was over. All the way back to the house I thought about the difference between the person up there on the screen and the one I knew at home.<extension extension_name='ref' name="NoSpank"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="title">Going My Own Way</arg><arg name="url">http://www.nospank.net/crosbyg.htm</arg><arg name="author">Gary Crosby</arg><arg name="date">March 1983</arg><arg name="publisher">Doubleday</arg><arg name="isbn">978-0-385-17055-0</arg></template></extension></paragraph></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Younger son Phillip vociferously disputed his brother Gary's claims about their father.

He wanted to make money and knew that humiliating our father and blackening his name was the only way he could do it. He knew it would generate a lot of publicity.

Going My Own Way, published in 1983 and co-authored by Ross Firestone, was Garys controversial attempt to transfer his professional and personal shortcomings onto his father; and to achieve the long desired leading role playing Bing, no less should his book be adapted to the screen. This wasnt to be, as the book created considerable turmoil within the Crosby family. Subsequently, Gary recanted large portions of his unfortunate memoir. To further the rehabilitation Gary decided in 1995 to record an album overdubbing his fathers classic recordings. This came too late. With one side complete, a persistent cough interfered with the endeavor. A doctors visit confirmed that he had advanced lung cancer.

After Crosby's death in 1977, he left the residue of his estate to a marital trust for the benefit of his widow, Kathryn, and HLC Properties, Ltd., was formed for the purpose of managing his interests, including his right of publicity. In 1996, Dixie's trust sued HLC and Kathryn for declaratory relief as to the trust's entitlement to interest, dividends, royalties, and other income derived from the community property of Crosby and Dixie. In 1999, the parties settled for approximately $1.5 million. Relying on a retroactive amendment to the California Civil Code, Dixie's trust brought suit again, in 2010, alleging that Crosby's right of publicity was community property, and that Dixie's trust was entitled to a share of the revenue it produced. The trial court granted Dixie's trust's claim. The California Court of Appeal reversed, however, holding that the 1999 settlement barred the claim.
