Where he does not specify, it is still possible to identify books to which he must have had access by quotations that he uses. A full catalogue of the library available to Bede in the monastery cannot be reconstructed, but it is possible to tell, for example, that Bede was very familiar with the works of Virgil. There is little evidence that he had access to any other of the pagan Latin writershe quotes many of these writers but the quotes are almost all to be found in the Latin grammars that were common in his day, one or more of which would certainly have been at the monastery. Another difficulty is that manuscripts of early writers were often incomplete: it is apparent that Bede had access to Pliny's<space/><italics><link><target>Natural History (Pliny)</target><part>Encyclopedia</part></link></italics>, for example, but it seems that the version he had was missing book xviii, as he would almost certainly have quoted from it in his<space/><italics>De temporum ratione</italics>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="BLTW_Laistner">M.L.W.
