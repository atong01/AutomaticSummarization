It is also the set of practices through which those expressive genres are shared. The study of folklore is sometimes called folkloristics. In usage, there is a continuum between folklore and mythology.</paragraph><paragraph><bold>American folklore</bold><space/>encompasses the folk traditions that have evolved on the North American continent since Europeans arrived in the 16th century. While it contains much in the way of Native American tradition, it should not be confused with the tribal beliefs of any community of native people.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Native American folklore</heading><paragraph><link><target>Indigenous peoples of the Americas</target><part>Native American</part></link><space/>cultures are rich in myths and legends that explain natural phenomena and the relationship between humans and the spirit world. According to Barre Toelken, feathers, beadwork, dance steps and music, the events in a story, the shape of a dwelling, or items of traditional food can be viewed as icons of cultural meaning.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Barre"><link type='external' href='http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&amp;amp;context=usupress_pubs'>Toelken, Barre.

Though some neighboring cultures hold similar beliefs, others can be quite different from one another. The most common myths are the creation myths, that tell a story to explain how the earth was formed, and where humans and other beings came from. Others may include explanations about the sun, moon, constellations, specific animals, seasons, and weather. This is one of the ways that many tribes have kept, and continue to keep, their cultures alive; these stories are not told simply for entertainment, but as a way of preserving and transmitting the nation, tribe or band's particular beliefs, history, customs, spirituality and traditional way of life. &quot;[S]tories not only entertain but also embody Native behavioral and ethical values.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="Barre"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>There are many different kinds of stories. Some are called &quot;hero stories&quot;; these are stories of people who lived at one time, and who were immortalized and remembered through these tales. There are &quot;trickster stories&quot;, about the different trickster figures of the tribes, spirits who may be either helpful or dangerous, depending on the situation. There are also tales that are simply warnings; they warn against doing something that may harm in some way. Many of these tales have morals or some form of belief that is being taught. This is how the things were remembered.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Founding myths</heading><paragraph>The founding of the United States is often surrounded by legends and tall tales. Many stories have developed since the founding long ago to become a part of America's folklore and cultural awareness, and non-native American folklore especially includes any narrative which has contributed to the shaping of<space/><link><target>Culture of the United States</target><part>American culture</part></link><space/>and belief systems. These narratives may be true and may be false or may be a little true and a little false; the veracity of the stories is not a determining factor.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Christopher Columbus</heading><paragraph><link><target>Christopher Columbus</target></link>, as a hero and symbol, is an important figure in the pantheon of American myth. His status, not unlike most American icons, is representative not of his own accomplishments, but the self-perception of the society which chose him as a hero. Having effected a separation from England and its cultural icons, America was left without historyor heroes on which to base a shared sense of their social selves.<space/><link><target>Washington Irving</target></link><space/>was instrumental in popularizing Columbus. His version of Columbus' life, published in 1829, was more a romance than a biography. The book was very popular, and contributed to an image of the discoverer as a solitary individual who challenged the unknown sea, as triumphant Americans contemplated the dangers and promise of their own wilderness<space/><link><target>frontier</target></link>. As a consequence of his vision and audacity, there was now a land free from kings, a vast continent for new beginnings. In the years following the Revolution the poetic device &quot;Columbia&quot; was used as a symbol of both Columbus and America. King's College of New York changed its name in 1792 to Columbia, and the new capitol in Washington was subtitled District of Columbia.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://xroads.virginia.edu/~CAP/COLUMBUS/col3.html<space/></arg><arg name="title">'&#39;Columbus in History'&#39;<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Xroads.virginia.edu<space/></arg><arg name="date"><space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2012-12-29</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Jamestown</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Pocahontas</arg></template>In May 1607, the Susan Constant, the Discovery, and the Godspeed sailed through Chesapeake Bay and thirty miles up the James River settlers built<space/><link><target>Jamestown, Virginia</target></link>, England's first permanent colony.

Only thirty-eight made it through their first year in the New World. Captain John Smith, a pirate turned gentleman turned the settlers into foragers and successful traders with the Native Americans, who taught the English how to plant corn and other crops. Smith led expeditions to explore the regions surrounding Jamestown, and it was during one of these that the chief of the Powhatan Native Americans captured Smith. According to an account Smith published in 1624, he was going to be put to death until the chief's daughter,<space/><link><target>Pocahontas</target></link>, saved him.

Patrick Henry is best known for the speech he made in the House of Burgesses on March 23, 1775, in Saint John's Church in Richmond, Virginia. With the House undecided on whether to mobilize for military action against the encroaching British military force, Henry argued in favor of mobilization. Forty-two years later, Henry's first biographer, William Wirt, working from oral histories, tried to reconstruct what Henry said. According to Wirt, Henry ended his speech with words that have since become immortalized: &quot;I know not what course others may take; but as for me, Give me Liberty, or give me Death!&quot; The crowd, by Wirt's account, jumped up and shouted &quot;To Arms! To Arms!&quot;. For 160&amp;nbsp;years Wirt's account was taken at face value.

There is, however, no credible historical evidence that the story is true.

In the 2008 book<space/><italics>The Star-Spangled Banner: The Making of an American Icon</italics>, Smithsonian experts point out that accounts of the event appealed to Americans eager for stories about the revolution and its heroes and heroines.

A tall tale is a story with unbelievable elements, related as if it were true and factual. Some such stories are exaggerations of actual events; others are completely fictional tales set in a familiar setting, such as the American Old West, or the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. They are usually humorous or good-natured. The line between myth and tall tale is distinguished primarily by age; many myths exaggerate the exploits of their heroes, but in tall tales the exaggeration looms large, to the extent of becoming the whole of the story.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Based on historical figures</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Johnny Appleseed</target></link><space/>John Chapman (September 26, 1774 March 18, 1845), also known as Johnny Appleseed, was an American pioneer nurseryman who introduced apple trees to large parts of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois.

Beginning in the 17th century, immigrants from the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Germany and France began arriving in large numbers, bringing with them new styles and instruments. African slaves brought musical traditions, and each subsequent wave of immigrants contributes to a melting pot. Folk music includes both traditional music and the genre that evolved from it during the 20th century folk revival. The term originated in the 19th century but is often applied to music that is older than that.</paragraph><paragraph>Earliest American scholars were with The American Folklore Society (AFS), which emerged in the late 1800s. Their studies expanded to include Native American music, but still treated folk music as a historical item preserved in isolated societies. In North America, during the 1930s and 1940s, the Library of Congress worked through the offices of traditional music collectors Robert Winslow Gordon, Alan Lomax and others to capture as much North American field material as possible. Lomax was the first prominent scholar to study distinctly American folk music such as that of cowboys and southern blacks. His first major published work was in 1911, Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads, and was arguably the most prominent US folk music scholar of his time, notably during the beginnings of the folk music revival in the 1930s and early 1940s.</paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>American folk music revival</target></link><space/>was a phenomenon in the United States that began during the 1940s and peaked in popularity in the mid-1960s.

The ancestors of today's African-American population were brought to the United States as slaves, working primarily in the plantations of the South. They were from hundreds of tribes across West Africa, and brought with them certain traits of West African music including call and response vocals and complex rhythmic music, as well as syncopated beats and shifting accents. The African musical focus on rhythmic singing and dancing was brought to the New World, where it became part of a distinct folk culture that helped Africans &quot;retain continuity with their past through music&quot;.

The shanty was a distinct type of work song, developed especially in American-style merchant vessels that had come to prominence in decades prior to the American Civil War. These songs were typically performed while adjusting the rigging, raising anchor, and other tasks where men would need to pull in rhythm. These songs usually have a very punctuated rhythm precisely for this reason, along with a call-and-answer format. Well before the nineteenth century, sea songs were common on rowing vessels. Such songs were also very rhythmic in order to keep the rowers together.</paragraph><paragraph>They were notably influenced by songs of African Americans, such as those sung whilst manually loading vessels with cotton in ports of the southern United States. The work contexts in which African-Americans sang songs comparable to shanties included: boat-rowing on rivers of the south-eastern U.S. and Caribbean; the work of stokers or &quot;firemen&quot;, who cast wood into the furnaces of steamboats plying great American rivers;and stevedoring on the U.S. eastern seaboard, the Gulf Coast, and the Caribbeanincluding &quot;cotton-screwing&quot;: the loading of ships with cotton in ports of the American South. During the first half of the 19th century, some of the songs African Americans sang also began to appear in use for shipboard tasks, i.e. as shanties.</paragraph><paragraph>Shanty repertoire borrowed from the contemporary popular music enjoyed by sailors, including minstrel music, popular marches, and land-based folk songs, which were adapted to suit musical forms matching the various labor tasks required to operate a sailing ship. Such tasks, which usually required a coordinated group effort in either a pulling or pushing action, included weighing anchor and setting sail.</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>&quot;Poor Paddy Works on the Railway&quot; is a popular Irish and American folk song.

E. Clark's<space/><italics>Seven Years of a Sailor's Life</italics><space/>(1867). Clark recounted experiences fishing on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, in a vessel out of Provincetown, Mass. ca. 1865-6.

Its name is derived from the nickname for New York, the Empire State. It stood as the world's tallest building for 40&amp;nbsp;years, from its completion in 1931. The Empire State Building is generally thought of as an American cultural icon. The project involved 3,400 workers, mostly immigrants from Europe, along with hundreds of Mohawk iron workers, many from the Kahnawake reserve near Montreal. Perhaps the most famous popular culture representation of the building is in the 1933 film King Kong, in which the title character, a giant ape, climbs to the top to escape his captors but falls to his death after being attacked by airplanes. The 1957 romantic drama film An Affair to Remember involves a couple who plan to meet atop the Empire State Building, a rendezvous that is averted by an automobile accident. The 1993 film Sleepless in Seattle, a romantic comedy partially inspired by An Affair to Remember, climaxes with a scene at the Empire State observatory.</listitem></list><paragraph>Other locations and landmarks that have become part of American folklore include:<space/><link><target>Independence Hall</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Monument Valley</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Ellis Island</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Hoover Dam</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Pearl Harbor</target></link>, the<space/><link><target>Vietnam War Memorial</target></link>, and the<space/><link><target>Grand Canyon</target></link>.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Cultural icons</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem>The<space/><link><target>Liberty Bell</target></link><space/>is an iconic symbol of American independence, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
