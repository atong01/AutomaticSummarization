===Gyricon===
Electronic paper was first developed in the 1970s by Nick Sheridon at [[Xerox]]'s [[Xerox PARC|Palo Alto Research Center]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=GENUTH|first1=IDDO|title=The Future of Electronic Paper|url=http://thefutureofthings.com/3081-the-future-of-electronic-paper/|website=http://thefutureofthings.com|publisher=The Future Of Things|accessdate=2 March 2015|ref=tfot}}</ref> The first electronic paper, called [[Gyricon]], consisted of polyethylene spheres between 75 and 106 micrometers across. Each sphere is a [[janus particle]] composed of negatively charged black plastic on one side and positively charged white plastic on the other (each bead is thus a [[dipole]]).<ref name="gyroid_dipole">{{cite journal |last1=Crowley |first1=Joseph M. |last2=Sheridon |first2=Nicholas K. |last3=Romano |first3=Linda |title=Dipole moments of gyricon balls |journal=Journal of Electrostatics |volume=55 |issue=3-4 |pages=247–259 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030438860100208X |accessdate=20 November 2011 |doi=10.1016/S0304-3886(01)00208-X}}</ref> The spheres are embedded in a transparent silicone sheet, with each sphere suspended in a bubble of oil so that they can rotate freely.

===Electrophoretic===
[[Image:E-ink.svg|thumb|500px|Appearance of pixels]]
In the simplest implementation of an electrophoretic display, [[titanium dioxide]] (titania) particles approximately one micrometer in diameter are dispersed in a hydrocarbon oil.  A dark-colored dye is also added to the oil, along with [[surfactant]]s and [[charging agent]]s that cause the particles to take on an electric charge.  This mixture is placed between two parallel, conductive plates separated by a gap of 10 to 100 [[micrometre]]s.  When a voltage is applied across the two plates, the particles migrate [[electrophoresis|electrophoretically]] to the plate that bears the opposite charge from that on the particles.  When the particles are located at the front (viewing) side of the display, it appears white, because light is scattered back to the viewer by the high-index titania particles.  When the particles are located at the rear side of the display, it appears dark, because the incident light is absorbed by the colored dye.  If the rear electrode is divided into a number of small picture elements ([[pixel]]s), then an image can be formed by applying the appropriate voltage to each region of the display to create a pattern of reflecting and absorbing regions.

Electrophoretic displays are considered prime examples of the electronic paper category, because of their paper-like appearance and low power consumption.

Examples of commercial electrophoretic displays include the high-resolution [[active matrix]] displays used in the [[Amazon Kindle]], [[Barnes & Noble Nook]], [[Sony Librie]], [[Sony Reader]], [[Kobo eReader]] and [[iRex iLiad]] e-readers.  These displays are constructed from an electrophoretic imaging film manufactured by [[E Ink Corporation]]. A mobile phone that used the technology is the [[Motorola Fone]].

Electrophoretic Display technology has also been developed by [[Sipix]] and [[Bridgestone]]/Delta.
SiPix is now part of E Ink. The Sipix design uses a flexible 0.15mm Microcup architecture, instead of E Ink's 0.04mm diameter microcapsules.<ref>[http://www.e-ink-info.com/introduction]</ref><ref>[http://www.epapercentral.com/epaper-technologies-guide]</ref>
[[Bridgestone]] Corp.'s Advanced Materials Division cooperated with Delta Optoelectronics Inc. in developing the [[Quick Response Liquid Powder Display]] (QR-LPD) technology.<ref>[http://www2.bridgestone-dp.jp/global/adv-materials/QR-LPD/ Electronic Paper | Bridgestone Corporation<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://thecoolgadgets.com/bridgestone-flexible-epaper-quick-response-liquid-powder-technology/ BridgeStone Flexible ePaper – Quick Response Liquid Powder Technology | The Cool Gadgets - Quest for The Coolest Gadgets<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Electrophoretic displays can be manufactured using the [[EPLaR|Electronics on Plastic by Laser Release (EPLaR)]] process developed by [[Philips|Philips Research]] to enable existing [[AM-LCD]] manufacturing plants to create flexible plastic displays.

[[Image:Kindle 3 texture (crop).jpg|thumb|Macro photograph of Kindle 3 screen; microcapsules are evident at [[Media:Kindle 3 texture (crop).jpg|full size]]]]
In the 1990s another type of electronic paper was invented by [[Joseph Jacobson]], who later co-founded the [[E Ink Corporation]], which formed a partnership with [[Philips|Philips Components]] two years later to develop and market the technology. In 2005, Philips sold the electronic paper business as well as its related patents to [[Prime View International]].  This used tiny microcapsules filled with electrically charged white [[molecules|particle]]s suspended in a colored [[Mineral oil|oil]].<ref name="e_ink_nature">{{cite journal | last1 = Comiskey | first1 = B. | last2 = Albert | first2 = J. D. | last3 = Yoshizawa | first3 = H. | last4 = Jacobson | first4 = J. | year = 1998 | title = An electrophoretic ink for all-printed reflective electronic displays | doi = 10.1038/28349 | journal = Nature | volume = 394 | issue = 6690| pages = 253–255 }}</ref> In early versions, the underlying [[circuitry]] controlled whether the white particles were at the top of the capsule (so it looked white to the viewer) or at the bottom of the capsule (so the viewer saw the color of the oil). This was essentially a reintroduction of the well-known [[Electrophoresis|electrophoretic]] display technology, but microcapsules meant the display could be made on flexible plastic sheets instead of glass.
One early version of electronic paper consists of a sheet of very small transparent capsules, each about 40 [[micrometer]]s across. Each capsule contains an oily solution containing black dye (the electronic ink), with numerous white [[titanium dioxide]] particles suspended within. The particles are slightly negatively [[electric charge|charged]], and each one is naturally white.<ref name="newscientist_1"/>
The screen holds microcapsules in a layer of [[liquid]] [[polymer]], sandwiched between two arrays of electrodes, the upper of which is transparent. The two arrays are aligned to divide the sheet into pixels, and each pixel corresponds to a pair of electrodes situated on either side of the sheet. The sheet is laminated with transparent plastic for protection, resulting in an overall thickness of 80 micrometers, or twice that of ordinary paper.
The network of electrodes connects to display circuitry, which turns the electronic ink 'on' and 'off' at specific pixels by applying a voltage to specific electrode pairs. A negative charge to the surface electrode repels the particles to the bottom of local capsules, forcing the black dye to the surface and turning the pixel black. Reversing the voltage has the opposite effect. It forces the particles to the surface, turning the pixel white. A more recent implementation of this concept requires only one layer of electrodes beneath the microcapsules.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sample |first=Ian |newspaper=New Scientist |title=Roll The Presses |date=24 April 2001 |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn659-roll-the-presses.html |accessdate=20 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first1=John A |last1=Rogers |first2=Zhenan |last2=Bao |first3=Kirk |last3=Baldwin |first4=Ananth |last4=Dodabalapur |first5=Brian |last5=Crone |first6=V R |last6=Raju |first7=Valerie |last7=Kuck |first8=Howard |last8=Katz |first9=Karl |last9=Amundson |first10=Jay |last10=Ewing |first11=Paul |last11=Drzaic |title=Paper-like electronic displays: Large-area rubber-stamped plastic sheets of electronics and microencapsulated electrophoretic inks |date=24 April 2001 |journal=PNAS |volume=98 |issue=9 |pages=4835–4840 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/98/9/4835.full |doi=10.1073/pnas.091588098 |accessdate=20 November 2011}}</ref>

===Electrowetting===
{{Main|Electrowetting}}
Electro-wetting display (EWD) is based on controlling the shape of a confined water/oil interface by an applied voltage. With no voltage applied, the (colored) oil forms a flat film between the water and a hydrophobic (water-repellent) insulating coating of an electrode, resulting in a colored pixel.

When a voltage is applied between the electrode and the water, the interfacial tension between the water and the coating changes. As a result, the stacked state is no longer stable, causing the water to move the oil aside.

This makes a partly transparent pixel, or, if a reflective white surface is under the switchable element, a white pixel. Because of the small pixel size, the user only experiences the average reflection, which provides a high-brightness, high-contrast switchable element.

Displays based on [[Electrowetting|electro-wetting]] provide several attractive features. The switching between white and colored reflection is fast enough to display video content.<ref>{{citation |last=Zyga |first=Lisa |date=26 July 2010 |title=Oil-based color pixels could let you watch videos on e-paper |url=http://www.physorg.com/news199330889.html |newspaper=PhysOrg |accessdate=20 November 2011}}</ref>

It's a low-power and low-voltage technology, and displays based on the effect can be made flat and thin. The reflectivity and contrast are better than or equal to other reflective display types and approach the visual qualities of paper.

In addition, the technology offers a unique path toward high-brightness full-color displays, leading to displays that are four times brighter than reflective LCDs and twice as bright as other emerging technologies.<ref>LiquaVista electrowetting display technologies http://www.liquavista.com</ref>

Instead of using red, green and blue (RGB) filters or alternating segments of the three primary colors, which effectively result in only one third of the display reflecting light in the desired color, electro-wetting allows for a system in which one sub-pixel can switch two different colors independently.

This results in the availability of two thirds of the display area to reflect light in any desired color. This is achieved by building up a pixel with a stack of two independently controllable colored oil films plus a color filter.

The colors are cyan, magenta and yellow, which is a subtractive system, comparable to the principle used in inkjet printing for example. Compared to LCD another factor two in brightness is gained because no polarisers are required.<ref>[http://www.hinduonnet.com/seta/2003/10/02/stories/2003100200060200.htm The Hindu : Technology for reflective full-color display<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref>

Miortech’s 2nd generation electrowetting display technology solves a number of issues of 1st generation electrowetting display technology and large-area devices are easy to manufacture since the pixel walls act as spacers. Miortech has established Etulipa as a subsidiary to bring its electrowetting display technology (EWD) into the digital signage space. Etulipa has been working on color displays that reflect sunlight, just like paper, with environmental benefits such as low power consumption and reduced light pollution that would overcome the disadvantages of LED billboards.<ref>{{cite web|title=www.etulipa.com|url=http://www.etulipa.com}}</ref>

====Electrofluidic====
[[Electrofluidic display]]s are a variation of an electrowetting display. Electrofluidic displays place an aqueous pigment dispersion inside a tiny reservoir.  The reservoir comprises <5-10% of the viewable pixel area and therefore the pigment is substantially hidden from view.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gamma Dynamic Technology|url=http://gammadynamics.net/technology/|publisher=Gamma Dynamics|accessdate=1 April 2012}}</ref> Voltage is used to electromechanically pull the pigment out of the reservoir and spread it as a film directly behind the viewing substrate.  As a result, the display takes on color and brightness similar to that of conventional pigments printed on paper. When voltage is removed liquid surface tension causes the pigment dispersion to rapidly recoil into the reservoir.  As reported in the May 2009 Issue of Nature Photonics{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}, the technology can potentially provide >85% white state reflectance for electronic paper.

The core technology was invented at the Novel Devices Laboratory at the [[University of Cincinnati]].  The technology is currently being commercialized by Gamma Dynamics.

===Interferometric modulator (Mirasol)===
{{Main|Interferometric modulator display}}

Technology used in [[electronic visual display]]s that can create various colors via [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]] of reflected light. The color is selected with an electrically switched light [[modulator]] comprising a [[micromachinery|microscopic cavity]] that is switched on and off using [[driver circuit|driver]] [[integrated circuit]]s similar to those used to address [[liquid crystal display]]s (LCD).

==Disadvantages==
Electronic paper technologies have a very low refresh rate compared to other low-power display technologies, such as LCD. This prevents producers from implementing sophisticated interactive applications (using fast moving menus, mouse pointers or scrolling) like those common on standard [[mobile device]]s. An example of this limit is that a document cannot be smoothly zoomed without either extreme blurring during the transition or a very slow zoom.

[[Image:e-ink ghost.jpg|thumb|right|An e-ink screen showing the "ghost" of a prior image]]

Another limit is that a shadow of an image may be visible after refreshing parts of the screen. Such shadows are termed "ghost images", and the effect is termed "ghosting". This effect is reminiscent of [[screen burn-in]] but, unlike screen burn-in, is solved after the screen is refreshed several times. Turning every pixel white, then black, then white, helps normalize the contrast of the pixels. This is why several devices with this technology "flash" the entire screen white and black when loading a new image.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

No company has yet successfully brought a full color display to market.

==Applications==

[[File:EInk Refresh.gif|thumb|An e-paper display on a watch refreshes to remove ghosts.]]
Several companies are simultaneously developing electronic paper and ink.  While the technologies used by each company provide many of the same features, each has its own distinct technological advantages. All electronic paper technologies face the following general challenges:

* A method for encapsulation
* An ink or active material to fill the encapsulation
* Electronics to activate the ink

Electronic ink can be applied to flexible or rigid materials.  For flexible displays, the base requires a thin, flexible material tough enough to withstand considerable wear, such as extremely thin plastic.  The method of how the inks are encapsulated and then applied to the substrate is what distinguishes each company from others.  These processes are complex and are carefully guarded industry secrets.  Nevertheless, making electronic paper is less complex and costly than LCDs.

There are many approaches to electronic paper, with many companies developing technology in this area. Other technologies being applied to electronic paper include modifications of [[liquid crystal display]]s, [[electrochromic]] displays, and the electronic equivalent of an [[Etch A Sketch]] at Kyushu University.  Advantages of electronic paper includes low power usage (power is only drawn when the display is updated), flexibility and better readability than most displays.  Electronic ink can be printed on any surface, including walls, billboards, product labels and T-shirts.  The ink's flexibility would also make it possible to develop [[rollable display]]s for electronic devices.

In November 2009 Barnes and Noble launched the [[Barnes & Noble Nook]], running an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system. It differs from other big name readers in having a replaceable battery, and a separate touch-screen color LCD below the main electronic paper reading screen.

===Newspapers===
In February 2006, the [[Flanders|Flemish]] daily ''[[De Tijd]]'' distributed an electronic version of the paper to select subscribers in a limited marketing study, using a pre-release version of the [[iRex iLiad]].  This was the first recorded application of electronic ink to newspaper publishing.

The [[French language|French]] daily ''[[Les Échos (France)|Les Échos]]'' announced the official launch of an electronic version of the paper on a subscription basis, in September 2007. Two offers were available, combining a one-year subscription and a reading device. The offer included either a light (176g) reading device (adapted for Les Echos by Ganaxa) or the [[iRex iLiad]]. Two different processing platforms were used to deliver readable information of the daily, one based on the newly developed GPP electronic ink platform from ''[[Ganaxa]]'', and the other one developed internally by Les Echos.

===Displays embedded in smart cards===
Flexible display cards enable financial payment cardholders to generate a [[one-time password]] to reduce [[online banking]] and transaction fraud. Electronic paper offers a flat and thin alternative to existing [[key fob]] tokens for data security. The world’s first ISO compliant [[smart card]] with an embedded display was developed by Innovative Card Technologies and nCryptone in 2005. The cards were manufactured by Nagra ID.

===Status displays===

E-Paper based [[electronic shelf label]]s (ESL) are used to digitally display the prices of goods at retail stores. Electronic paper based labels are updated via two-way infrared or radio technology.

===Other===
Other proposed applications include clothes, digital photo frames, information boards and keyboards. Keyboards with dynamically changeable keys are useful for less represented languages, non-standard keyboard layouts such as [[Dvorak Simplified Keyboard|Dvorak]], or for special non-alphabetical applications such as video editing or games.
