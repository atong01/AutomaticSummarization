{{LGBT topics and Christianity}}
Within [[Christianity]] there are a variety of views on the issues of [[sexual orientation]] and [[homosexuality]]. The many [[List of Christian denominations|Christian denominations]] vary in their position, from condemning homosexual acts as [[Christian views on sin|sinful]], through being divided on the issue, to seeing it as morally acceptable. Even within a denomination, individuals and groups may hold different views. Further, not all members of a denomination necessarily support their church's views on homosexuality.

In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries the extent to which the Bible mentions the subject, whether or not it is condemned, and whether the various passages apply today, have become contentious topics. Debate has arisen over the proper interpretation of the Levitical code; the story of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]; and various Pauline passages, and whether these verses condemn same-sex sexual activities.

The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] "recognizes that every human being is valuable in the sight of God, and seeks to minister to all men and women [including homosexuals] in the spirit of Jesus," while maintaining that homosexual sex itself is "forbidden" in the Bible.  "Jesus affirmed the dignity of all human beings and reached out compassionately to persons and families suffering the consequences of sin. He offered caring ministry and words of solace to struggling people, while differentiating His love for sinners from His clear teaching about sinful practices."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adventist.org/information/official-statements/statements/article/go/0/homosexuality/|title=Official Statements - Homosexuality |accessdate=8 September 2014}}</ref>

Some denominations state opposing positions. Various churches within the [[Lutheran World Federation]] hold stances on the issue ranging from declaring homosexual acts as sin to acceptance of homosexual relationships. For example, the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]], the [[Lutheran Church of Australia]], and the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] recognize homosexual behavior as intrinsically sinful and seek to minister to those who are struggling with homosexual inclinations.<ref name="LCMS – Homosexuality">{{cite web|url = http://lcms.org/Documents.fdoc?src=lcm&id=1100| title = What about Homosexuality?|publisher = [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]]|accessdate = 26 May 2014}}</ref><ref name="WELS – Homosexuality">{{cite web|url = http://www.wels.net/what-we-believe/questions-answers/social-issues/acceptance-homosexuals| title = Are homosexuals accepted in WELS?|work= WELS Topical Q&A|title= Acceptance of homosexuals |publisher = [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]]|date=27 Oct 2009|accessdate = 27 May 2014}}</ref> However, the [[Church of Sweden]] conducts [[same-sex marriage]]s, while the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] opens the ministry of the church to gay pastors and other professional workers living in committed relationships.<ref name="ELCA – Sodomy">{{cite web|url = http://www.elca.org/Who-We-Are/Our-Three-Expressions/Churchwide-Organization/Communication-Services/News/Releases.aspx?a=4253| title = ELCA Assembly Opens Ministry to Partnered Gay and Lesbian Lutherans|publisher = [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]]|accessdate = 22 November 2009}}</ref> The Ethiopian [[Mekane Yesus]] Lutheran Church, however, has taken a stand that marriage is inherently between a man and a woman, and has formally broken fellowship with the ELCA,<ref>[http://www.eecmy.org/?home=po&page=!news&newscategory=/&article=62 EECMY breaks with ELCA]</ref> a doctrinal stand that has cost the Ethiopian church ELCA financial support.

The [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers) is also much like Lutheranism in regards to homosexuality.

}}</ref> and [[Lutheran]]<ref name="LCMS – Homosexuality" /> churches allow for the blessing of gay unions. The [[United Church of Canada]] also allows same-sex marriage, and views [[sexual orientation]] as a gift from God. Within the Anglican communion there are openly gay clergy, for example, [[Gene Robinson]] is an openly gay Bishop in the US Episcopal Church. Within the Lutheran communion there are openly gay clergy, for example, bishop [[Eva Brunne]] is an openly lesbian Bishop in the [[Church of Sweden]]. Such religious groups and denominations interpretation of scripture and doctrine leads them to accept that homosexuality is morally acceptable, and a natural occurrence. For example, in 1988 the [[United Church of Canada]], that country's largest Protestant denomination, affirmed that "a) All persons, regardless of their sexual orientation, who profess Jesus Christ and obedience to Him, are welcome to be or become full member of the Church''; and ''b) All members of the Church are eligible to be considered for the Ordered Ministry."<ref>[http://www.united-church.ca/humanrights/equal/chronology#1988 Chronology of Marriage and Equality Rights in the United Church] {{wayback|url=http://www.united-church.ca/humanrights/equal/chronology#1988 |date=20090425181001 }}</ref> In 2000, the Church's General Assembly further affirmed that "human sexual orientations, whether heterosexual or homosexual, are a gift from God and part of the marvelous diversity of creation."<ref>"Same-Sex Marriage Legislation Offers a Win-Win Solution, Says The United Church of Canada," 2005-FEB-01, United Church of Canada, at: http://www.united-church.ca/</ref>

In addition, some Christian denominations such as the [[Moravian Church]], believe that the [[Bible]] speaks negatively of homosexual acts but, as research on the matter continues, the Moravian Church seeks to establish a policy on homosexuality and the ordination of homosexuals.<ref name="The Moravian Interprovincial Faith & Order Commission">{{cite web|url=http://www.moravianseminary.edu/FaithOrder/STHomosexuality1st.html |title=On Homosexuality and Ordination |publisher=The Moravian Interprovincial Faith & Order Commission |accessdate=22 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20060722092332/http://www.moravianseminary.edu:80/FaithOrder/STHomosexuality1st.html |archivedate=22 July 2006 }}</ref> In 2014, Moravian Church in Europe allowed [[Blessing of same-sex unions in Christian churches|blessings of same-sex unions]].<ref>[http://www.idea.de/frei-kirchen/detail/brueder-unitaet-kuenftig-sind-homo-segnungen-moeglich-28126.html Idea: Brueder-Unitatät, Künftig sind Homo-Segnungen möglich (German)]</ref>

As an alternative to a school-sponsored [[Day of Silence]] opposing bullying of LGBT students, conservative Christians organized a Golden Rule Initiative, where they passed out cards saying "As a follower of Christ, I believe that all people are created in the image of God and therefore deserve love and respect."<ref>{{cite news

In the 20th century, theologians like [[Jürgen Moltmann]], [[Hans Küng]], [[John A. T. Robinson|John Robinson]], [[David Edward Jenkins|Bishop David Jenkins]], [[Don Cupitt]], and [[John Shelby Spong|Bishop Jack Spong]]  challenged traditional theological positions and understandings of the Bible; following these developments some have suggested that passages have been mistranslated or that they do not refer to what we understand as "homosexuality."<ref>See generally http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_bibl.htm and subpages therein.</ref>  Clay Witt, a minister in the [[Metropolitan Community Church]], explains how theologians and commentators like [[John Shelby Spong]], George Edwards and Michael England interpret injunctions against certain sexual acts as being originally intended as a means of distinguishing religious worship between Abrahamic and the surrounding [[Paganism|pagan]] faiths, within which homosexual acts featured as part of idolatrous religious practices: "England argues that these prohibitions should be seen as being directed against sexual practices of fertility cult worship. As with the earlier reference from Strong’s, he notes that the word 'abomination' used here is directly related to idolatry and idolatrous practices throughout the Hebrew Testament. Edwards makes a similar suggestion, observing that 'the context of the two prohibitions in  {{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:22|KJV|}} and {{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:13|KJV|}} suggest that what is opposed is not same-sex activity outside the cult, as in the modern secular sense, but within the cult identified as Canaanite'".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrmcc.org/Resources/StudyDocuments/bibleand.htm |title=Homosexuality and the Bible, Rev.

In 1986 the [[Evangelical and Ecumenical Women’s Caucus]] (EEWC), then known as the Evangelical Women's Caucus International, passed a resolution stating: "Whereas homosexual people are children of God, and because of the biblical mandate of Jesus Christ that we are all created equal in God's sight, and in recognition of the presence of the lesbian minority in EWCI, EWCI takes a firm stand in favor of civil rights protection for homosexual persons." <ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=EoJrHDirVQUC&pg=PA471&lpg=PA471&dq=%22whereas+homosexual+people+are+children+of+god%22&source=bl&ots=zW5ZeaAyiJ&sig=YvLXGt_t71EurjQE-XvZItlG0is&hl=en&sa=X&ei=aVlhUt27OIWt4AOW_oGACg&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22whereas%20homosexual%20people%20are%20children%20of%20god%22&f=false</ref>

Yale professor [[John Boswell]] has argued that a number of [[Early Christians]] entered into homosexual relationships,<ref name=BOS>{{Citation | last= Boswell | first= John | title= The Marriage of Likeness. Same-Sex Unions in Pre-Modern Europe | publisher= Fontana | year= 1996}}</ref> and that certain Biblical figures had homosexual relationships, such as [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]] and her mother-in-law [[Naomi (Bible)|Naomi]], [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] and the court official Ashpenaz, and [[David and Jonathan|David]] and King [[Saul]]'s son [[David and Jonathan|Jonathan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_bmar.htm |title=ReligiousTolerance.org |publisher=ReligiousTolerance.org |accessdate=12 November 2011}}</ref> Boswell has also argued that [[adelphopoiesis]], a rite bonding two men, was akin to a religiously sanctioned same-sex union. Having partaken in such a rite, a person was prohibited from entering into marriage or taking monastic vows, and the choreography of the service itself closely parallelled that of the marriage rite.<ref name=BOS/><ref>Robin Darling Young, "[http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9411/articles/darling.html Gay Marriage: Reimagining Church History]", [[First Things]] 47 (November 1994), pp. 43–48.</ref><ref name="Halsall">Paul Halsall, ''[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/bosrevdisc-kennedy1.html Reviewing Boswell]'' (1995).</ref> His views have not found wide acceptance, and opponents have argued that this rite sanctified a [[Platonic love|Platonic]] brotherly bond, not a homosexual union.<ref name="Halsall"/> He also argued that condemnation of homosexuality began only in the 12th century.<ref name="Boswell2">John Boswell, ''[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/1979boswell.html The Church and the Homosexual – An Historical Perspective]'' (1979).</ref> Boswell's critics<ref>Gagnon R.A.J., ''The Bible and Homosexual Practice: Texts and Hermeneutics''.

[[Desmond Tutu]], the former [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa|Anglican]] Archbishop of Cape Town and a Nobel Peace Prize winner, has described homophobia as a "crime against humanity" and "every bit as unjust" as apartheid:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afrol.com/articles/13584 |title=Desmond Tutu: "Homophobia equals apartheid" |publisher=Afrol.com |accessdate=12 November 2011}}</ref> "We struggled against apartheid in South Africa, supported by people the world over, because black people were being blamed and made to suffer for something we could do nothing about; our very skins. It is the same with sexual orientation. It is a given. ... We treat them [gays and lesbians] as pariahs and push them outside our communities. We make them doubt that they too are children of God – and this must be nearly the ultimate blasphemy. We blame them for what they are."<ref>Sex, Love & Homophobia, published by Amnesty International UK, 2005, foreword by Desmund Tutu.</ref>

Modern gay Christian leader [[Justin R. Cannon]] promotes what he calls "Inclusive Orthodoxy" (not to be confused with the Eastern Orthodox Church). He explains on his ministry website: "Inclusive Orthodoxy is the belief that the Church can and must be inclusive of LGBT individuals without sacrificing the Gospel and the Apostolic teachings of the Christian faith."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truthsetsfree.net/about.htm |title=INCLUSIVE ORTHODOXY: Gay Christian Ministry – Bible and Homosexuality? |publisher=Truthsetsfree.net |accessdate=12 November 2011}}</ref> Cannon's ministry takes a unique approach quite distinct from modern liberal Christians, yet which still supports homosexual relations. His ministry affirms the divine inspiration of the Bible, the authority of Tradition, and says "...that there is a place within the full life and ministry of the Christian Church for lesbian, gay, [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] Christians, both those who are called to lifelong celibacy and those who are partnered."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truthsetsfree.net/index.html |title=Inclusive Orthodoxy ~ The Rev.

[[File:TroyPerry2006-09-17.JPG|thumb|right|Rev. [[Troy Perry]] preaching in 2006 at a [[Metropolitan Community Church]].]]
[[George Barna]], a conservative Christian author and researcher, conducted a survey in the United States in 2009 that found gay and lesbian people having a Christian affiliation were more numerous than had been presumed. He characterized some of his leading conclusions from the data as follows:<ref>Quoted in Chellew-Hodge, Candace. "[http://www.religiondispatches.org/blog/sexandgender/1590/new_poll_shows_gays_and_lesbians_believe_in_god New Poll Shows Gays and Lesbians Believe in God]." ''ReligionDispatches''. 25 June [[2009 in literature|2009]]. . Retrieved 2009-06-27.</ref><blockquote>"People who portray gay adults as [[Godlessness|godless]], [[hedonistic]], Christian bashers are not working with the facts. A substantial majority of gays cite their [[faith]] as a central facet of their life, consider themselves to be Christian, and claim to have some type of meaningful personal commitment to [[Jesus Christ]] active in their life today. The data indicate that millions of gay people are interested in faith but not in the local church and do not appear to be focused on the traditional tools and traditions that represent the comfort zone of most churched Christians. Gay adults clearly have a different way of interpreting the Bible on a number of central theological matters, such as perspectives about God. Homosexuals appreciate their faith but they do not prioritize it, and they tend to consider faith to be individual and private rather than communal."</blockquote>  The study of 20 faith-oriented attributes revealed significant differences between the United States heterosexual and homosexual populations sampled, homosexual respondents being less likely to be ''born again Christians'' than heterosexual respondents (27% compared to 47%), and the degree of commitment to their faith and families also differed. Other significant contrasts were seen in regards to "liberal" versus "conservative" social positions, as well as in one’s understanding of God, with 43% of homosexual participants sharing the "orthodox, biblical" understanding of God which 71% of heterosexual participants indicate they do. Respondents were not asked to describe themselves as  "[[born again Christian|born again]]", but as is standard in Barna studies, this classification was defined according to basic standard criteria.<ref name = BARNAGAY/> Barna concluded, “The data indicates that millions of gay people are interested in faith but not in the local church and do not appear to be focused on the traditional tools and traditions that represent the comfort zone of most churched Christians." And that "Gay adults clearly have a different way of interpreting the Bible on a number of central theological matters, such as perspectives about God."<ref name = BARNAGAY>{{cite web|url=http://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/13-culture/282-spiritual-profile-of-homosexual-adults-provides-surprising-insights |title=Spiritual Profile of Homosexual Adults Provides Surprising Insights |publisher=Barna.org |date=22 June 2009 |accessdate=12 November 2011}}</ref>

Candace Chellew-Hodge, liberal Christian lesbian founder of online magazine ''Whoseoever'', responded to the findings:

<blockquote>All in all, I'm grateful for Barna even wandering into the subject of gay and lesbian [[religion|religious belief]]. I think his study is important and can go a long way to dispelling the old "gays vs. God" [[dichotomy]] that too often gets played out in the media. However, his overall message is still harmful: Gays and lesbians are Christians – they're just not as good as straight ones.<ref name="Chellew-Hodge 2009">{{cite web|url=http://www.religiondispatches.org/blog/sexandgender/1590/new_poll_shows_gays_and_lesbians_believe_in_god |title=New Poll Shows Gays and Lesbians Believe in God, Candace Chellew-Hodge, ReligionDispatches, 25 June 2009 (accessed 2009-06-27) |publisher=Religiondispatches.org |accessdate=12 November 2011}}</ref></blockquote>

She argued that Barna had formulated his report with undue irony and skepticism, and that he had failed to take into account the reasons for the data which enkindled his "arrière pensée."  The reason why far fewer homosexuals attend church, she argued, is that there are far fewer churches who will accept them. Equally, gays and lesbians do not see the Bible as unequivocally true because they are forced by its use against them to read it more closely and with less credulity, leading them to note its myriad [[internal consistency of the Bible|contradictions]].<ref name="Chellew-Hodge 2009"/>

Organizations for homosexual Christians exist across a wide range of beliefs and traditions. The interdenominational [[Gay Christian Network]] has some members who affirm same-sex relationships and others who commit themselves to celibacy, groups it refers to as "[[Gay Christian Network#Sex and Christianity|Side A]]" and "[[Gay Christian Network#Sex and Christianity|Side B]]", respectively.<ref>[http://www.gaychristian.net/index.php? GCN Homepage] (website). Gay Christian Network. Retrieved 2008-03-05.</ref><ref>{{cite news| title = The Believers| first = Tim| last = Murphy| newspaper = The Advocate| date = 17 June 2008| pages = 52–58}}</ref> According to founder [[Justin Lee (activist)|Justin Lee]], <blockquote>"We're just trying to get people together who experience attraction to the same sex, however they have handled that, and who love Jesus and say, OK, you are welcome here, and then let's pray together and figure out where God wants us to take it."<ref>[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0612/18/acd.02.html Transcript] of 18 December 2006 episode of ''Anderson Cooper 360''</ref></blockquote>

Some organizations cater exclusively to homosexual Christians who do not want to have gay sex, or attraction; the goals of these organizations vary. Some Christian groups focus on simply refraining from gay sex, such as [[Courage International]] and [[North Star (organization)|North Star]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://northstarlds.org |title=North Star web site |publisher=Northstarlds.org |accessdate=12 November 2011}}</ref>  Other groups additionally encourage gay members to reduce or eliminate [[same-sex attraction]]s.  [[Love Won Out]] and the now-defunct [[Exodus International]] are examples of such ministries. These groups are sometimes referred to as [[ex-gay]] organizations, though many no longer use the term.  [[Alan Chambers (Exodus International)|Alan Chambers]], the president of Exodus, says the term incorrectly implies a complete change in sexual orientation,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/18/nation/na-exgay18 |title=Approaching agreement in debate over homosexuality |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=18 June 2007 |accessdate=12 November 2011}}</ref> though the group [[Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays and Gays]] continues to use the term.  In addition, individual Christians identifying as gay who want to subscribe to the conservative ethic are becoming more vocal themselves.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spiritual Friendship in 300 Words|url=http://spiritualfriendship.org/2012/08/29/spiritual-friendship-in-300-words/|website=www.spiritualfriendship.org|accessdate=May 2015}}</ref>

Gay Christian writer and actor [[Peterson Toscano]] argues that organizations promoting orientation change are a "ruse."<ref>{{cite news |title=Turning off gays |first=Mark |last=Benjamin |newspaper=Salon.com |date=18 July 2005 |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2005/07/18/ungay/index.html}}</ref> An organization he co-founded, [[Beyond Ex-Gay]], supports people who feel they have been wounded by such organizations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beyondexgay.com/ |title=Beyond Ex-Gay Group for survivors of Ex-Gay ministries |publisher=Beyondexgay.com |accessdate=12 November 2011}}</ref>

[[LGBT-affirming Christian denominations|Other groups]] support or advocate for gay Christians and their relationships. For example, in the United States, [[IntegrityUSA]] represents the interests of lesbian and gay Christians in the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.integrityusa.org/ |title=Integrity (US Episcopal) |publisher=Integrityusa.org |accessdate=12 November 2011}}</ref> while [[United Methodist Church|United Methodists]] have the [[Reconciling Ministries Network]] and [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christians have ''Evangelicals Concerned''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecwr.org/index.php |title=Evangelicals Concerned: Gay Christians |publisher=Ecwr.org |accessdate=12 November 2011}}</ref> In 2014 the [[United Church of Christ]] filed a lawsuit challenging North Carolina’s ban on same-sex marriage, which is America’s first faith-based challenge to same-sex marriage bans; the [[Alliance of Baptists]] joined the lawsuit later that year.<ref>http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2014/06/03/4952335/rabbis-group-joins-nc-same-sex.html#.U5MxjShCySo</ref><ref>http://www.advocate.com/politics/religion/2014/06/06/rabbis-join-marriage-equality-fight</ref>

Sociologist Richard N. Pitt argues that these organizations are only available to LGBT members of liberal denominations, as opposed to those in conservative denominations. His review of the literature on gay Christians suggests that these organizations not only represent the interests of Christians who attend their churches, but (like gay-friendly and gay-affirming churches) also give these members useful responses to homophobic and heterosexist rhetoric. His research shows that those GLBT Christians who stay at homophobic churches "kill the messenger"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/123306098/HTMLSTART |title=Pitt, Richard N. (2010). "Killing The Messenger". ''Journal of Homosexuality'' 49:56–72 |publisher=.interscience.wiley.com |date=1 March 2010 |accessdate=12 November 2011}}</ref> by attacking the minister's knowledge about homosexuality, personal morality, focus on sin instead of forgiveness, and motivations for preaching against homosexuality.
