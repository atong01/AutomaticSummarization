To spare the provincial populations from excessive taxation and to save money, emperors began to employ units recruited from Germanic tribes. The largest of these contingents was that of the Goths, who in 382 (376 in some sources), had been allowed to settle within the imperial boundaries, keeping a large degree of autonomy.</paragraph><paragraph>In 394 Alaric served as a leader of<space/><italics>foederati</italics><space/>under<space/><link><target>Theodosius I</target></link><space/>in the campaign which crushed the usurper<space/><link><target>Eugenius</target></link>. As the<space/><link><target>Battle of the Frigidus</target></link>, which terminated this campaign, was fought at the passes of the<space/><link><target>Julian Alps</target></link>, Alaric probably learned the weakness of<space/><link><target>Italy</target><part>Italy's</part></link><space/>natural defences on its northeastern frontier at the head of the<space/><link><target>Adriatic Sea</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Theodosius died in 395, leaving the Empire to be divided between his two sons<space/><link><target>Arcadius</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Flavius Augustus Honorius</target><part>Honorius</part></link>, the former taking<space/><link><target>Byzantine Empire</target><part>the eastern</part></link><space/>and the latter<space/><link><target>Western Roman Empire</target><part>the western portion</part></link><space/>of the Empire.

He was denied the promotion, however. Among the Visigoths settled in Lower<space/><link><target>Moesia</target></link><space/>(now part of Bulgaria and Romania), the situation was ripe for rebellion. They had suffered disproportionately great losses at Frigidus. According to rumour, exposing the Visigoths in battle was a convenient way of weakening the Gothic tribes. This, combined with their post-battle rewards, prompted them to raise Alaric &quot;on a shield&quot; and proclaim him king; according to<space/><link><target>Jordanes</target></link>, a 6th-century Roman bureaucrat of Gothic origin who later turned his hand to history, both the new king and his people decided &quot;rather to seek new kingdoms by their own work, than to slumber in peaceful subjection to the rule of others.&quot;</paragraph><heading level='2'>In Greece</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Ludwig Thiersch - Alaric Athnes.jpg</target><part>300px</part><part>right</part><part>thumb</part><part>Alaric in Athens by<space/><link><target>Ludwig Thiersch</target></link>, 1894</part></link>Alaric struck first at the eastern empire.

Instead, Rufinus attempted to negotiate with Alaric in person, which only aroused suspicions in Constantinople that Rufinius was in league with the Goths. Stilicho now marched east against Alaric. According to<space/><link><target>Claudian</target></link>, Stilicho was in a position to destroy the Goths when he was ordered by Arcadius to leave<space/><link><target>Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum</target><part>Illyricum</part></link>.

In 396, he wiped out the last remnants of the<space/><link><target>Eleusinian Mysteries</target><part>Mysteries at Eleusis</part></link><space/>in Attica, ending a tradition of esoteric religious ceremonies that had lasted since the<space/><link><target>Bronze Age</target></link>.

Some lines of the Roman poet<space/><link><target>Claudian</target></link><space/>inform us that he heard a voice proceeding from a<space/><link><target>sacred grove</target></link>, &quot;Break off all delays, Alaric. This very year thou shalt force the Alpine barrier of Italy; thou shalt penetrate to the city.&quot; But the prophecy was not to be fulfilled at this time. After spreading desolation through North<space/><link><target>Italy</target></link><space/>and striking terror into the citizens of Rome, Alaric was met by<space/><link><target>Stilicho</target></link><space/>at<space/><link><target>Pollentia</target></link>, today in<space/><link><target>Piedmont (Italy)</target><part>Piedmont</part></link>. The battle which followed on April 6, 402 (coinciding with Easter), was a victory for Rome, though a costly one. But it effectively halted the Goths' progress.</paragraph><paragraph>Stilicho's enemies later reproached him for having gained his victory by taking impious advantage of the great Christian festival.

He had not &quot;penetrated to the city&quot; but his invasion of Italy had produced important results.

By 407, the estrangement between the eastern and western courts had become so bitter that it threatened civil war. Stilicho actually proposed using Alaric's troops to enforce Honorius' claim to the<space/><link><target>prefecture</target></link><space/>of Illyricum. The death of Arcadius in May 408 caused milder counsel to prevail in the western court, but Alaric, who had actually entered Epirus, demanded in a somewhat threatening manner that if he were thus suddenly requested to desist from war, he should be paid handsomely for what modern language would call the &quot;expenses of<space/><link><target>mobilization</target></link>&quot;. The sum which he named was a large one, 4,000&amp;nbsp;pounds of gold. Under strong pressure from Stilicho, the Roman Senate consented to promise its payment.</paragraph><paragraph>But three months later, Stilicho and the chief ministers of his party were treacherously slain on Honorius' orders. In the unrest that followed throughout Italy, the wives and children of the foederati were slain. Consequently, these 30,000 men flocked to Alaric's camp, clamouring to be led against their cowardly enemies. He accordingly led them across the Julian Alps and, in September 408, stood before the walls of<space/><link><target>Rome</target></link><space/>(now with no capable general like Stilicho as a defender) and began a strict blockade.</paragraph><paragraph>No blood was shed this time; Alaric relied on hunger as his most powerful weapon. When the ambassadors of the<space/><link><target>Roman Senate</target><part>Senate</part></link>, entreating for peace, tried to intimidate him with hints of what the despairing citizens might accomplish, he laughed and gave his celebrated answer: &quot;The thicker the hay, the easier mowed!&quot; After much bargaining, the famine-stricken citizens agreed to pay a ransom of 5,000 pounds of gold, 30,000 pounds of silver, 4,000 silken tunics, 3,000 hides dyed scarlet, and 3,000 pounds of pepper.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Nor">J.

His demands were certainly grand: the concession of a block of territory 200&amp;nbsp;miles long by 150 wide between the<space/><link><target>Danube</target></link><space/>and the Gulf of<space/><link><target>Venice</target></link><space/>(to be held probably on some terms of nominal dependence on the Empire) and the title of commander-in-chief of the Imperial Army. Immense as his terms were, the emperor would have been well advised to grant them. Honorius, however, refused to see beyond his own safety, guaranteed by the dikes and marshes of<space/><link><target>Ravenna</target></link>. As all attempts to conduct a satisfactory negotiation with this emperor failed, Alaric, after instituting a second siege and blockade of<space/><link><target>Rome</target></link><space/>in<space/><bold>409</bold>, came to terms with the Senate. With their consent, he set up a rival emperor, the prefect of the city, a Greek named<space/><link><target>Priscus Attalus</target></link>.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Third siege of Rome</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Sack of Rome (410)</arg></template>Alaric cashiered his ineffectual puppet emperor after eleven months and again tried to reopen negotiations with Honorius.

Alaric, again outwitted by an enemy's machinations, marched southward and in deadly earnest, began his third siege of Rome. Apparently, defence was impossible; there are hints, not well substantiated, of treachery; surprise is a more likely explanation. However, this may befor our information at this point of the story is meagreon August 24, 410, Alaric and his Visigoths burst in by the<space/><link><target>Porta Salaria</target></link><space/>on the northeast of the city.

But even these exceptional instances show that Rome was not entirely spared the horrors which usually accompany the storming of a besieged city. Nonetheless, the written sources do not mention damages wrought by fire, save the<space/><link><target>Gardens of Sallust</target></link>, which were situated close to the gate by which the Goths had made their entrance; nor is there any reason to attribute any extensive destruction of the buildings of the city to Alaric and his followers.
