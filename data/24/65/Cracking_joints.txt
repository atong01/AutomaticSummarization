'''Cracking''' or '''popping''' of joints is the action of [[joint manipulation]] to produce a sharp cracking or popping sound. This commonly occurs during deliberate [[knuckle]]-cracking.  It is possible to crack many joints, such as those in the back and neck [[vertebrae]], hips, wrists, elbows, shoulders, toes, ankles, knees, jaws, feet, sternum, and the [[Achilles tendon]] area. Although it is a common folk belief that popping of joints, especially knuckles, leads to [[arthritis]] or other joint problems, medical research has so far failed to conclusively demonstrate any connection between knuckle cracking and long-term joint problems.

The physical mechanism causing a cracking sound produced by bending, twisting, or compressing joints is uncertain. Suggested causes include:

* Cracking sounds occur when bubbles form in joints as they are pulled apart<ref name="kawchuk">{{cite journal |author=Gregory N. Kawchuk, Jerome Fryer, Jacob L. Jaremko, Hongbo Zeng, Lindsay Rowe, Richard Thompson |year=2015 |title=Real-Time Visualization of Joint Cavitation |journal=PLoS ONE |issue=6 |pages=384–390 |pmid=12183696 |DOI=10.1371/journal.pone.0119470 |volume=25}}</ref>
* [[Cavitation]] within the joint—small cavities of partial vacuum form in the [[synovial fluid]] and then rapidly collapse, producing a sharp sound.
* Rapid stretching of ligaments.<ref name="Protopapas" />
* Intra-articular (within-joint) [[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]] being broken.<ref name="Protopapas" />

There were several theories to explain the cracking of joints. Synovial fluid cavitation has some evidence to support it.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brodeur R. |title=The audible release associated with joint manipulation. |journal=J Manipulative Physiol Ther |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=155–64 |year=1995 |pmid=7790795}}</ref> When a [[spinal manipulation]] is performed, the applied force separates the [[articular]] surfaces of a fully encapsulated synovial joint, which in turn creates a reduction in pressure within the joint cavity. In this low-pressure environment, some of the [[gases]] that are dissolved in the synovial fluid (which are naturally found in all bodily fluids) leave the solution, making a [[liquid bubble|bubble]], or [[Cavitation|cavity]], which rapidly collapses upon itself, resulting in a "clicking" sound.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Maigne|first1=Jean-Yves|last2=Vautravers|first2=Philippe|title=Mechanism of action of spinal manipulative therapy|journal=Joint Bone Spine|date=September 2003|volume=70|issue=5|pages=336–341|doi=10.1016/S1297-319X(03)00074-5}}</ref> The contents of the resultant gas bubble are thought to be mainly [[carbon dioxide]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Unsworth A, Dowson D, Wright V. |title='Cracking joints'. A bioengineering study of cavitation in the metacarpophalangeal joint. |journal=Ann Rheum Dis |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=348–58 |year=1971 |pmid=5557778 |doi=10.1136/ard.30.4.348 |pmc=1005793}}[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1005793/pdf/annrheumd00004-0008.pdf]</ref>  The effects of this process will remain for a period of time known as the "[[Refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]]," during which the joint cannot be "re-cracked," which lasts about twenty minutes, while the gases are slowly reabsorbed back into the [[synovial fluid]]. There is some evidence that [[Ligamentous laxity|ligament laxity]] may be associated with an increased tendency to cavitate.<ref name="Fryer">{{cite journal |author=Fryer, Gary and Jacob, Mudge and McLaughlin, Patrick |year=2002 |title=The Effect of Talocrural Joint Manipulation on Range of Motion at the Ankle |journal=[[Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics]] |issue=6 |pages=384–390 |pmid=12183696 |doi=10.1067/mmt.2002.126129 |volume=25}}</ref>

However, recent evidence demonstrates that the cracking sound is produced when the bubble within the joint is formed, not when it collapses.<ref name="kawchuk" />

The snapping of tendons or scar tissue over a prominence (as in [[snapping hip syndrome]]) can also generate a loud snapping or popping sound.<ref name="Protopapas">{{cite journal |author=Protopapas M, Cymet T, Protapapas M |title=Joint cracking and popping: understanding noises that accompany articular release. |journal=J Am Osteopath Assoc |volume=102 |issue=5 |pages=283–7 |date=1 May 2002|pmid=12033758 |url=http://www.jaoa.org/cgi/reprint/102/5/283 }}</ref>

The common claim that cracking one's knuckles causes [[arthritis]] appears unsupported. A study published in 2011 examined the hand radiographs of 215 people (aged 50 to 89) and compared the joints of those who regularly cracked their knuckles to those who did not.<ref name="Deweber">{{cite journal | author = Deweber K, Olszewski M, Ortolano R. | title = Knuckle cracking and hand osteoarthritis | journal = J Am Board Fam Med | pages = 169–174 | year = 2011 | doi = 10.3122/jabfm.2011.02.100156| pmc = | volume = 24 | pmid=21383216 | issue = 2}}</ref> The study concluded that knuckle-cracking did not cause hand osteoarthritis, no matter how many years or how often a person cracked their knuckles.<ref name="Deweber"/> An earlier study also concluded that there was no increased preponderance of arthritis of the hand of chronic knuckle-crackers; however, habitual knuckle-crackers were more likely to have hand swelling and lowered grip strength.<ref name="Castellanos">{{cite journal | author = Castellanos J., Axelrod D. | title = Effect of habitual knuckle cracking on hand function | journal = Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases | pages = 49(5):308–9 | year = 1990 | doi = 10.1136/ard.49.5.308 | pmc = 1004074 | volume = 49 | pmid=2344210 | issue = 5}}</ref> Habitual knuckle-cracking was associated with manual labour, [[Nail biting|biting of the nails]], [[smoking]], and [[drinking alcohol]] and was suggested to result in functional hand impairment.<ref name="Castellanos"/> This early study has been criticized for not taking into consideration the possibility of confounding factors, such as whether the ability to crack one's knuckles is associated with impaired hand functioning rather than being a cause of it.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Simkin|first=Peter|title=Habitual knuckle cracking and hand function.|journal=Annals of Rheumatic Disease|date=November 1990|volume=49|issue=11|pages=957|doi=10.1136/ard.49.11.957-b}}</ref>

There are many ways people have learned to crack the joints of their fingers, one of the most common ways is to put pressure on the joint between the metacarpals and the proximal phalanges.

Medical doctor Donald Unger cracked the knuckles of his left hand every day for more than sixty years, but he did not crack the knuckles of his right hand. No arthritis or other ailments formed in either hand, earning him the 2009 [[Ig Nobel Prize]] in Medicine, a [[parody]] of the [[Nobel Prize]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://improbable.com/ig/winners/#ig2009 | title=2009 Winners of the Ig® Nobel Prize|accessdate=27 November 2011}}</ref>
