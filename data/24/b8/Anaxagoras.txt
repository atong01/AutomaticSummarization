'''Anaxagoras''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|n|æ|k|ˈ|s|æ|g|ə|r|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἀναξαγόρας}}, ''Anaxagoras'', "lord of the assembly"; c. 510&nbsp;– 428&nbsp;BC) was a [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Pre-Socratic]] [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]]. Born in [[Clazomenae]] in [[Asia Minor]], Anaxagoras was the first philosopher to bring philosophy to [[Athens]]. According to [[Diogenes Laertius]] and [[Plutarch]], in later life he was charged with [[impiety]] and went into exile in [[Lampsacus]]; the charges may have been political, owing to his association with [[Pericles]].

Responding to the claims of [[Parmenides]] on the impossibility of change, Anaxagoras described the world as a mixture of primary imperishable ingredients, where material variation was never caused by an absolute presence of a particular ingredient, but rather by its relative preponderance over the other ingredients; in his words, "each one is... most manifestly those things of which there are the most in it".<ref name=Curd>{{cite book|author=Anaxagoras|editor1-last=Curd|editor1-first=Patricia|title=A Presocratics Reader|publisher=Hackett|isbn=978-1-60384-305-8|chapter=Anaxagoras of Clazomenae|quote=B12}}</ref> He introduced the concept of ''[[Nous]]'' (Mind) as an ordering force, which moved and separated out the original mixture, which was [[homogeneous]], or nearly so.

He also gave a number of novel scientific accounts of natural phenomena. He produced a correct explanation for [[eclipse]]s and described the sun as a fiery mass larger than the [[Peloponnese]], as well as attempting to explain [[rainbows]] and [[meteors]].

==Biography==
Anaxagoras appears to have had some amount of property and prospects of political influence in his native town of [[Clazomenae]] in [[Asia Minor]]. However, he supposedly surrendered both of these out of a fear that they would hinder his search for knowledge. The Roman author [[Valerius Maximus]] preserves a different tradition: Anaxagoras, coming home from a long voyage, found his property in ruin, and said: "If this had not perished, I would have." A sentence, denoted by Maximus, as being "possessed of sought-after wisdom!"<ref>{{cite book |title=Anaxagoras of Clazomenae: Fragments and Testimonia : a text and translation with notes and essays |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2007 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PA6HMrSrjfkC&pg=PA90&dq=%22Valerius+Maximus%22+%22anaxagoras%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sjY_T-zuMsSniQLa7ZmHAQ&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Valerius%20Maximus%22%20%22anaxagoras%22&f=false}}</ref><ref>Val. Max., VIII, 7, ext., 5: ''Qui, cum e diutina peregrinatione patriam repetisset possessionesque desertas vidisset, "non essem - inquit "ego salvus, nisi istae perissent." Vocem petitae sapientiae compotem!''</ref> Although a Greek, he may have been a soldier of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] army when Clazomenae was suppressed during the [[Ionian Revolt]].

In early manhood (c. 464&ndash;461 BC) he went to [[Athens]], which was rapidly becoming the centre of [[Culture of Greece|Greek culture]]. There he is said to have remained for thirty years. [[Pericles]] learned to love and admire him, and the poet [[Euripides]] derived from him an enthusiasm for science and humanity.

Anaxagoras brought philosophy and the spirit of scientific inquiry from [[Ionia]] to Athens.  His observations of the celestial bodies and the fall of [[meteorites]] led him to form new theories of the universal order, and to a putative prediction of the impact of a meteorite in 467 BC.<ref>Couprie, Dirk L. "How Thales Was Able to" Predict" a Solar Eclipse Without the Help of Alleged Mesopotamian Wisdom." Early Science and Medicine 9.4 (2004): 321-337</ref> He attempted to give a scientific account of [[eclipse]]s, [[meteor]]s, [[rainbow]]s, and the [[sun]], which he described as a mass of blazing metal, larger than the [[Peloponnese]]. He was the first to explain that the moon shines due to reflected light from the sun. He also said that the moon had mountains and believed that it was inhabited. The heavenly bodies, he asserted, were masses of stone torn from the earth and ignited by rapid rotation. He explained that, though both sun and the stars were fiery stones, we do not feel the heat of the stars because of their enormous distance from earth. He thought that the earth is flat and floats supported by 'strong' air under it and disturbances in this air sometimes causes earthquakes.<ref>Burnet J. (1892) ''Early Greek Philosophy'' A. & C. Black, London, [http://worldcat.org/oclc/4365382 OCLC 4365382], and subsequent editions, 2003 edition published by Kessinger, Whitefish, Montana, ISBN 0-7661-2826-1</ref> These speculations made him vulnerable in Athens to a charge of impiety. [[Diogenes Laertius]] reports the story that he was prosecuted by Cleon for impiety, but Plutarch says that Pericles sent his former tutor, Anaxagoras, to Lampsacus for his own safety after the Athenians began to blame him for the [[Peloponnesian war]].<ref>[http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/pericles.1b.txt Plutarch, ''Pericles'']</ref>

About 450 BC, according to Laertius, Pericles spoke in defense of Anaxagoras at his trial.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = A.E. | year = 1917 | title = On the date of the trial of Anaxagoras | url = | journal = Classical Quarterly | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 81–87 | doi=10.1017/s0009838800013094}}</ref> Even so, Anaxagoras was forced to retire from Athens to [[Lampsacus]] in [[Troad]] (c. 434&ndash;433 BC). He died there in around the year 428 BC. Citizens of Lampsacus erected an altar to Mind and Truth in his memory, and observed the anniversary of his death for many years.

Anaxagoras wrote a book of philosophy, but only fragments of the first part of this have survived, through preservation in work of [[Simplicius of Cilicia]] in the 6th century AD.

According to Anaxagoras all things have existed in some way from the beginning, but originally they existed in infinitesimally small fragments of themselves, endless in number and inextricably combined throughout the universe.<ref name="eb1911">{{EB1911|wstitle=Anaxagoras}}</ref> All things existed in this mass, but in a confused and indistinguishable form.<ref name="eb1911"/> There was an infinite number of homogeneous parts ({{lang-el|ὁμοιομερῆ}}) as well as heterogeneous ones.<ref name="smith">
{{Cite DGRBM|author=Leonhard Schmitz|title=Anaxagoras|volume=1|page=|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DA%3Aentry+group%3D21%3Aentry%3Danaxagoras-bio-1}}</ref>

The work of arrangement, the segregation of like from unlike and the summation of the whole into totals of the same name, was the work of Mind or Reason ({{lang-el|νοῦς}}).<ref name="eb1911"/> Mind is no less unlimited than the chaotic mass, but it stood pure and independent, a thing of finer texture, alike in all its manifestations and everywhere the same.<ref name="eb1911"/> This subtle agent, possessed of all knowledge and power, is especially seen ruling in all the forms of life.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Diels|editor1-first=Hermann|title=Die fragmente der Vorsokratiker griechisch und deutsch|quote=B12}}</ref> Its first appearance, and the only manifestation of it which Anaxagoras describes, is Motion.<ref name="eb1911"/> It gave distinctness and reality to the aggregates of like parts.<ref name="eb1911"/>

Decease and growth only mean a new aggregation ({{lang-el|σὐγκρισις}}) and disruption ({{lang-el|διάκρισις}}).<ref name="eb1911"/> However, the original intermixture of things is never wholly overcome.<ref name="eb1911"/> Each thing contains in itself parts of other things or heterogeneous elements, and is what it is, only on account of the preponderance of certain homogeneous parts which constitute its character.<ref name="smith"/> Out of this process arises the things we see in this world.<ref name="smith"/>

==Literary references==
In a quote chosen to begin [[Nathanael West]]'s first book "[[The Dream Life of Balso Snell]]", [[Marcel Proust]]'s character Bergotte says, "After all, my dear fellow, life, Anaxagoras has said, is a journey."

Anaxagoras appears as a character in ''[[Faust, Part Two|Faust, Part II]]'' by [[Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe]].

Anaxagoras appears as a character in ''The Ionia Sanction'', by [[Gary Corby]].

Anaxagoras is referred to and admired by Cyrus Spitama, the hero and narrator of ''[[Creation (novel)|Creation]]'', by [[Gore Vidal]]. The book contains this passage, explaining how Anaxagoras became influential:

:[According to Anaxagoras] One of the largest things is a hot stone that we call the sun. When Anaxagoras was very young, he predicted that sooner or later a piece of the sun would break off and fall to earth. Twenty years ago, he was proved right. The whole world saw a fragment of the sun fall in a fiery arc through the sky, landing near Aegospotami in Thrace. When the fiery fragment cooled, it proved to be nothing more than a chunk of brown rock. Overnight Anaxagoras was famous. Today his book is read everywhere. You can buy a secondhand copy in the Agora for a drachma.<ref>Vidal, Gore, ''Creation: restored edition'', chapter 2, Vintage Books (2002)</ref>

[[William H. Gass]] begins his novel, ''The Tunnel'' (1995), with a quote from Anaxagoras: "The descent to hell is the same from every place."
