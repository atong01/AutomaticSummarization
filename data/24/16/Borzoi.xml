Most borzois are almost silent, barking only very rarely. They do not have strong territorial drives and cannot be relied on to raise the alarm upon sighting a human intruder. The borzoi is extremely smart and requires patient, experienced handling. They are gentle and highly sensitive dogs with a natural respect for humans, and as adults they are decorative couch potatoes with remarkably gracious house manners. Borzois do not generally display dominance or aggression towards people, but will turn aggressive if handled roughly. Typically however, they are rather reserved with strangers but affectionate with people they know well. Their sensitivity to invasion of their personal space can make them nervous around children unless they are brought up with them. Despite their size, borzois adapt very well to<space/><link><target>suburb</target><trail>an</trail></link><space/>life, provided they have a spacious yard and regular opportunities for free exercise.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">March 2014</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>A common misunderstanding about the intelligence of breeds in the<space/><link><target>Hound</target></link><space/>group stems from their independent nature, which conflicts with the frequent confusion between the concepts of &quot;intelligence&quot; and &quot;obedience&quot; in discussions of canine brainpower.<space/><link><target>Stanley Coren</target></link>'s survey of canine obedience trainers published in<space/><italics><link><target>The Intelligence of Dogs</target></link></italics><space/>reported that borzois obeyed the first command less than 25% of the time. Coren's test, however, was by his own admission heavily weighted towards the &quot;obedience&quot; interpretation of intelligence and based on a better understanding of &quot;working&quot; breeds than hounds. Unfortunately, the publicity given to this report has led to unfair denigration of breeds which are under-represented in obedience clubs and poorly understood by the average obedience trainer.<extension extension_name='ref'>At a Conformation Judges training session not long after Coren's book was released, I was greeted by the coordinator with the question, &quot;I read something that said Borzois aren't very smart, is that true?&quot; This to the owner of several borzois, one of which knows how to open the refrigerator, and all of which respond instantly to &quot;commands&quot; given in that special owner-dog private language that wouldn't even be noticed by an outsider.</extension><space/>&quot;Work&quot; for hound breeds is done out of hearing and often out of sight of the human companion; it is an activity for which the dogs are &quot;released&quot;, rather than an activity which is &quot;commanded&quot;.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">March 2014</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>In terms of obedience, borzois are selective learners who quickly become bored with repetitive, apparently pointless, activity, and they can be very stubborn when they are not properly motivated.

It is quite common for borzois at play to course (i.e., run down) another dog, seize it by the neck and hold it immobile. Young pups do this with their littermates, trading off as to who is the prey.

A controversy exists as to the presence of<space/><link><target>progressive retinal atrophy</target></link><space/>in the breed. A condition identified as borzoi retinopathy is seen in some individuals, usually active dogs, which differs from progressive retinal atrophy in several ways. First, it is unilateral, and rarely seen in animals less than three years of age; second, a clear-cut pattern of inheritance has not been demonstrated; and finally, most affected individuals do not go blind.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Borzoi-2ym-head.png</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>Borzoi is basically a very sound breed.</part></link>Correct nutrition during puppyhood is also debatable for borzois. These dogs naturally experience enormous growth surges in the first year or two of their lives. It is now widely accepted that forcing even faster growth by feeding a highly concentrated, high-energy diet is dangerous for skeletal development, causing unsoundness and increased tendency to joint problems and injury. Being built primarily for speed, borzois do not carry large amounts of body fat or muscle, and therefore have a rather different physiology to other dogs of similar size (such as the<space/><link><target>Newfoundland (dog)</target><part>Newfoundland</part></link>,<space/><link><target>St. Bernard (dog)</target><part>St. Bernard</part></link>, or<space/><link><target>Alaskan Malamute</target></link>). Laboratory-formulated diets designed for a generic &quot;large&quot; or &quot;giant&quot; breed are unlikely to take the needs of the big sighthounds into account.</paragraph><paragraph>The issues involved in<space/><link><target>raw feeding</target></link><space/>may be particularly relevant to tall, streamlined breeds such as the borzoi. It is interesting to note that the<space/><link><target>Hortaya Borzaya</target></link>, undoubtedly a very close relative, is traditionally raised on a meager diet of oats and table scraps. The Hortaya is also said to be intolerant of highly concentrated kibble feeds. Basically, a lean body weight in itself is nothing to be concerned about, and force-feeding of healthy young borzoi is definitely not recommended.</paragraph><heading level='2'>History</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:1879 Borzoi Flock.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Borzoi 1879</part></link><space/><link><target>File:Tikhmenev (1904) Wolf hunt with borzois.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>''Wolf hunting with borzois'' (1904), Efim A.

However, now that the archeological archives and research results of the former USSR are open to scientists, it has become quite clear that the primal sighthound type evolved between the Kyrgyzstan, the lower Kazakhstan part of Altai and the Afghan plains, and that the earliest actual sighthound breeds were the plains Afghan hounds and the Kyrgyz Taigan.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">March 2009</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>These ancient breeds then migrated South (founding the Tazi/Saluki branch) and West (founding the Stepnaya, Krimskaya and Hortaya branches) to develop into breeds adapted to those regions.

As well as providing exciting sport, the tests were used for selecting borzoi breeding stock; only the quickest and most intelligent hunting dogs went on to produce progeny. For the aristocracy these trials were a well-organized ceremony, sometimes going on for days, with the borzois accompanied by mounted hunters and<space/><link><target>Foxhound</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>on the Russian<space/><link><target>steppe</target></link>. Hares and other small game were by far the most numerous kills, but the hunters especially loved to test their dogs on wolf. If a wolf was sighted, the hunter would release a team of two or three borzois. The dogs would pursue the wolf, attack its neck from both sides, and hold it until the hunter arrived. The classic kill was by the human hunter with a knife. Wolf trials are still a regular part of the hunting diploma for all Russian sightdog breeds of the relevant type, either singly or in pairs or trios, in their native country.</paragraph><paragraph>After the<space/><link><target>1917 Revolution</target></link>, wolf hunting with sighthounds has soon gone out of fashion as an &quot;aristocratic&quot; and a means- and -time-taking way of hunting.A necessity in a wolf-catching sighthound didn't exist, in addition to the old proved technique of batue with the use of baits, flags and other appeared new, way more effectivefrom airplanes, from propeller sleighs, with electronic lure whistles. For decades the generations of few remaining sighthounds were regarded as hunting-suited, when showing enough attacking initiative for fox hunting.
