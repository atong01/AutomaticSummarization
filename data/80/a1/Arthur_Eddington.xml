He died in the<space/><link><target>typhoid</target></link><space/>epidemic which swept England in 1884. His mother was left to bring up her two children with relatively little income. The family moved to<space/><link><target>Weston-super-Mare</target></link><space/>where at first Stanley (as his mother and sister always called Eddington) was educated at home before spending three years at a preparatory school. The family lived at a house called Varzin, 42 Walliscote Road, Weston-super-Mare. There is a commemorative plaque on the building explaining Sir Arthur's contribution to science.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1893 Eddington entered Brynmelyn School. He proved to be a most capable scholar, particularly in mathematics and English literature. His performance earned him a scholarship to Owens College, Manchester (what was later to become the<space/><link><target>Victoria University of Manchester</target><part>University of Manchester</part></link>) in 1898, which he was able to attend, having turned 16 that year. He spent the first year in a general course, but turned to<space/><link><target>physics</target></link><space/>for the next three years. Eddington was greatly influenced by his physics and mathematics teachers,<space/><link><target>Arthur Schuster</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Horace Lamb</target></link>. At Manchester, Eddington lived at Dalton Hall, where he came under the lasting influence of the Quaker mathematician J. W. Graham. His progress was rapid, winning him several scholarships and he graduated with a B.Sc. in physics with First Class Honours in 1902.</paragraph><paragraph>Based on his performance at Owens College, he was awarded a scholarship to<space/><link><target>Trinity College, Cambridge</target><part>Trinity College</part></link><space/>at the<space/><link><target>University of Cambridge</target></link><space/>in 1902.

He left Cambridge for Greenwich the following month.

He developed a new statistical method based on the apparent drift of two background stars, winning him the<space/><link><target>Smith's Prize</target></link><space/>in 1907. The prize won him a Fellowship of Trinity College, Cambridge. In December 1912<space/><link><target>George Darwin</target></link>, son of<space/><link><target>Charles Darwin</target></link>, died suddenly and Eddington was promoted to his chair as the<space/><link><target>Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy</target></link><space/>in early 1913.

He began this in 1916 with investigations of possible physical explanations for<space/><link><target>Cepheid variables</target></link>. He began by extending<space/><link><target>Karl Schwarzschild</target></link>'s earlier work on radiation pressure in<space/><link><target>Lane-Emden equation</target><part>Emden polytropic models</part></link>. These models treated a star as a sphere of gas held up against gravity by internal thermal pressure, and one of Eddington's chief additions was to show that radiation pressure was necessary to prevent collapse of the sphere. He developed his model despite knowingly lacking firm foundations for understanding opacity and energy generation in the stellar interior. However, his results allowed for calculation of temperature,<space/><link><target>density</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>pressure</target></link><space/>at all points inside a star, and Eddington argued that his theory was so useful for further astrophysical investigation that it should be retained despite not being based on completely accepted physics.<space/><link><target>James Jeans</target></link><space/>contributed the important suggestion that stellar matter would certainly be<space/><link><target>Ionization</target><part>ionized</part></link>, but that was the end of any collaboration between the pair, who became famous for their lively debates.</paragraph><paragraph>Eddington defended his method by pointing to the utility of his results, particularly his important<space/><link><target>mass-luminosity relation</target></link>. This had the unexpected result of showing that virtually all stars, including giants and dwarfs, behaved as<space/><link><target>ideal gases</target></link>. In the process of developing his stellar models, he sought to overturn current thinking about the sources of stellar energy. Jeans and others defended the<space/><link><target>KelvinHelmholtz mechanism</target></link>, which was based on classical mechanics, while Eddington speculated broadly about the qualitative and quantitative consequences of possible proton-electron annihilation and nuclear fusion processes.</paragraph><paragraph>With these assumptions, he demonstrated that the interior temperature of stars must be millions of degrees. In 1924, he discovered the<space/><link><target>Main sequence</target><part>mass-luminosity relation</part></link><space/>for<space/><link><target>star</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>(see Lecchini in<space/><link><target>#External links and references</target></link><space/>). Despite some disagreement, Eddington's models were eventually accepted as a powerful tool for further investigation, particularly in issues of stellar evolution. The confirmation of his estimated stellar diameters by Michelson in 1920 proved crucial in convincing astronomers unused to Eddington's intuitive, exploratory style. Eddington's theory appeared in mature form in 1926 as<space/><italics>The Internal Constitution of the Stars</italics>, which became an important text for training an entire generation of astrophysicists.</paragraph><paragraph>Eddington's work in astrophysics in the late 1920s and the 1930s continued his work in stellar structure, and precipitated further clashes with Jeans and<space/><link><target>Edward Arthur Milne</target></link>. An important topic was the extension of his models to take advantage of developments in<space/><link><target>quantum physics</target></link>, including the use of degeneracy physics in describing dwarf stars.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Dispute with Chandrasekhar on existence of black holes</heading><paragraph>The topic of extension of his models precipitated his famous dispute with<space/><link><target>Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar</target></link>, who was then a student at Cambridge. Chandrasekhar's work presaged the discovery of<space/><link><target>black hole</target><trail>s</trail></link>, which at the time seemed so absurdly non-physical that Eddington refused to believe that Chandrasekhar's purely mathematical derivation had consequences for the real world. History clearly proved Eddington wrong, but his motivation remains a matter of some controversy. Chandrasekhar's narrative of this incident, in which his work is harshly rejected, portrays Eddington as rather cruel, dogmatic, and racist. This is at variance with Eddington's character as described by other contemporaries. Eddington's criticism seems to have been based on a suspicion that a purely mathematical derivation from relativity theory was not enough to explain away the seemingly daunting physical paradoxes that were inherent to degenerate stars.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Cite journal</target><arg name="last1"><space/>Padmanabhan<space/></arg><arg name="first1"><space/>T.

The mind-stuff is not spread in space and time; these are part of the cyclic scheme ultimately derived out of it.... It is necessary to keep reminding ourselves that all knowledge of our environment from which the world of physics is constructed, has entered in the form of messages transmitted along the nerves to the seat of consciousness.... Consciousness is not sharply defined, but fades into subconsciousness; and beyond that we must postulate something indefinite but yet continuous with our mental nature.... It is difficult for the matter-of-fact physicist to accept the view that the substratum of everything is of mental character. But no one can deny that mind is the first and most direct thing in our experience, and all else is remote inference."</arg><arg>Eddington, ''The Nature of the Physical World'', 276-81.</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>idealist</target></link><space/>conclusion was not integral to his epistemology but was based on two main arguments.</paragraph><paragraph>The first derives directly from current physical theory. Briefly, mechanical theories of the ether and of the behavior of fundamental particles have been discarded in both relativity and quantum physics. From this, Eddington inferred that a materialistic metaphysics was outmoded and that, in consequence, since the disjunction of materialism or idealism are assumed to be exhaustive, an idealistic metaphysics is required. The second, and more interesting argument, was based on Eddington's epistemology, and may be regarded as consisting of two parts. First, all we know of the objective world is its structure, and the structure of the objective world is precisely mirrored in our own consciousness. We therefore have no reason to doubt that the objective world too is &quot;mind-stuff.&quot; Dualistic metaphysics, then, cannot be evidentially supported.</paragraph><paragraph>But, second, not only can we not know that the objective world is nonmentalistic, we also cannot intelligibly suppose that it could be material. To conceive of a dualism entails attributing material properties to the objective world. However, this presupposes that we could observe that the objective world has material properties. But this is absurd, for whatever is observed must ultimately be the content of our own consciousness, and consequently, nonmaterial.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Ian Barbour</target></link>, in his book Issues in Science and Religion (1966), p.&amp;nbsp;133, cites Arthur Eddington's The Nature of the Physical World (1928) for a text that argues The<space/><link><target>Werner Heisenberg</target><part>Heisenberg</part></link><space/><link><target>Uncertainty principle</target><part>Uncertainty Principles</part></link><space/>provides a scientific basis for &quot;the defense of the idea of human freedom&quot; and his Science and the Unseen World (1929) for support of philosophical idealism &quot;the thesis that reality is basically mental&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Charles De Koninck</target></link><space/>points out that Eddington believed in objective reality existing apart from our minds, but was using the phrase &quot;mind-stuff&quot; to highlight the inherent intelligibility of the world: that our minds and the physical world are made of the same &quot;stuff&quot; and that our minds are the inescapable connection to the world.<extension extension_name='ref' name="de Koninck"><template><target>Cite book</target><arg name="publisher"><space/>University of Notre Dame Press,

I will not discuss the doctrine since I have not the least idea what is the meaning of the word existence when used in this connection. At any rate the science of astronomy has not been based on this spasmodic kind of moon. In the scientific world (which has to fulfill functions less vague than merely existing) there is a moon which appeared on the scene before the astronomer; it reflects sunlight when no one sees it; it has mass when no one is measuring the mass; it is distant 240,000 miles from the earth when no one is surveying the distance; and it will eclipse the sun in 1999 even if the human race has succeeded in killing itself off before that date.</arg><arg>Eddington, ''The Nature of the Physical World'', 226</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='3'>Indeterminism</heading><paragraph><template><target>see also</target><arg>Indeterminism</arg><arg>Indeterminism#Science</arg><arg name="label 2">Indeterminism in Science</arg></template>Against<space/><link><target>Albert Einstein</target></link><space/>and others who advocated<space/><link><target>determinism</target></link>, indeterminismchampioned by Eddington<extension extension_name='ref' name="de Koninck"></extension>says that a physical object has an<space/><link><target>ontology</target><part>ontologically</part></link><space/>undetermined component that is not due to the<space/><link><target>epistemology</target><part>epistemological</part></link><space/>limitations of physicists' understanding.

Many of these were gathered into books, including<space/><italics>The Nature of the Physical World</italics><space/>and<space/><italics>New Pathways in Science</italics>. His skillful use of literary allusions and humor helped make these famously difficult subjects quite accessible.</paragraph><paragraph>Eddington's books and lectures were immensely popular with the public, not only because of Eddingtons clear and entertaining exposition, but also for his willingness to discuss the philosophical and religious implications of the new physics. He argued for a deeply rooted philosophical harmony between scientific investigation and religious mysticism, and also that the positivist nature of modern physics (i.e., relativity and quantum physics) provided new room for personal religious experience and free will. Unlike many other spiritual scientists, he rejected the idea that science could provide proof of religious propositions.</paragraph><paragraph>He is sometimes misunderstood as having promoted the<space/><link><target>infinite monkey theorem</target></link><space/>in his 1928 book<space/><italics>The Nature of the Physical World</italics>, with the phrase &quot;If an army of monkeys were strumming on typewriters, they might write all the books in the<space/><link><target>British Museum</target></link>&quot;.
