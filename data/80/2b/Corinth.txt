'''Corinth''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɔr|ɪ|n|θ}}; [[Greek language|Greek]]: Κόρινθος, ''Kórinthos'', {{IPA-el|ˈkorinθos|pron|Ell-Korinthos.ogg}}) is a city and former [[municipality]] in [[Corinthia]], [[Peloponnese (region)|Peloponnese]], [[Greece]]. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality [[Corinth (municipality)|Corinth]], of which it is the seat and a municipal unit.<ref name=Kallikratis>[http://www.kedke.gr/uploads2010/FEKB129211082010_kallikratis.pdf Kallikratis law] Greece Ministry of Interior {{el icon}}</ref> It is the capital of Corinthia.

It was founded as '''Nea Korinthos''' or '''New Corinth''' (Νέα Κόρινθος) in 1858 after an earthquake destroyed the existing settlement of Corinth, which had developed in and around the site of [[ancient Corinth]].

==Geography==

Located about {{convert|78|km|mi|0}} west of [[Athens]], Corinth is surrounded by the coastal townlets of (clockwise) [[Lechaio]], [[Isthmia (village)|Isthmia]], [[Kechries]], and the inland townlets of [[Examilia]] and the archaeological site and village of ancient Corinth. Natural features around the city include the narrow coastal plain of [[Vocha (plain of)|Vocha]], the [[Gulf of Corinth|Corinthian Gulf]], the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] cut by its [[Corinth Canal|canal]], the Saronic Gulf, the [[Oneia Mountains]], and the monolithic rock of [[Acrocorinth]], where the medieval [[acropolis]] was built.

==History==
{{Further|Ancient Corinth}}
[[File:Corinthian incised shard.svg|thumb|left|Corinthian incised shard]]
Corinth derives its name from [[Ancient Corinth]], a [[city-state]] of antiquity. In 1858, the old city, now known as Archaia Korinthos (Αρχαία Κόρινθος), located {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} SW of the modern city, was totally destroyed by a magnitude 6.5 earthquake. '''Nea Korinthos''' or '''New Corinth''' was then built a few kilometers away on the coast of the Gulf of Corinth. A magnitude 6.3 earthquake in 1928 devastated the new city, which was then rebuilt on the same site.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tsapanos|first1=Theodoros M.|title=Deterministic seismic hazard analysis for the city of Corinth, central Greece|journal=Journal of the Balkan Geophysical Society|date=March 2011|volume=14|issue=1|pages=1-14|url=http://www.balkangeophysoc.gr/online-journal/2011_V14/No1_March2011/JBGS_Vol_14_No1_March_2011_p00-14_Tsapanos_et_al.pdf|accessdate=21 July 2015|display-authors=etal}}</ref> It was rebuilt again after a great fire in 1933.

The Municipality of Corinth (Δήμος Κορινθίων) had a population of 58,192 according to the 2011 census, the second most populous municipality in the [[Peloponnese Region]] after [[Kalamata]].<ref name=census11/> The municipal unit of Corinth had 38,132 inhabitants, of which Corinth itself had 30,176 inhabitants, placing it in third place behind Kalamata and [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]] among the cities of the Peloponnese Region.<ref name=census11/>

The municipal unit of Corinth (Δημοτική ενότητα Κορινθίων) includes apart from Corinth proper the town of [[Archaia Korinthos]] (2,198 inhabitants in 2011), the town of [[Examilia]] (2,905 inhabitants), and the smaller settlements of [[Xylokeriza]] (1,316 inhabitants) and [[Solomos, Corinthia|Solomos]] (817 inhabitants).<ref name=census11/>

==Economy==

===Industry===
Corinth is a major industrial hub at a national level. [[Corinth Refinery|Corinth Refineries]] is the largest [[oil refining]] Industrial complex in [[Europe]]. Copper cables, petroleum products, leather, medical equipment, marble, gypsum, ceramic tiles, salt, mineral water and beverages, meat products, and gums are produced nearby. As of 2005, a period of [[deindustrialization]] has commenced as a large pipework complex, a textile factory and a meat packing facility diminished their operations.

==Transport==
[[File:Corinth Isthmus rail road bridge.jpg|thumb|The rail road bridge over the Isthmus of Corinth.]]

=== Roads ===
Corinth is a major road hub. The [[Moreas Motorway|A7]] [[toll road|toll]] motorway for Tripoli and Kalamata, (and Sparta via [[Moreas Motorway|A71]] [[toll road|toll]]), branches off the [[Motorway 8 (Greece)|A8]]/[[European route E94]] [[toll road|toll]] motorway from Athens at Corinth.  Corinth is the main entry point to the Peloponnesian peninsula, the southernmost area of continental Greece.

=== Railways ===
The city has been connected to the [[Proastiakos]], the Athens suburban rail network, since 2005, when the new [[Corinth railway station]] was completed.

===Port===
[[File:Port of Corinth.jpg|thumb|left|500px|View of the port.]]

The port of Corinth, located north of the city centre and close to the northwest entrance of the [[Corinth Canal]], at 37 56.0’ N / 22 56.0’ E, serves the local needs of industry and agriculture. It is mainly a cargo exporting facility.

It is an artificial harbour (depth approximately {{convert|9|m|ft}}, protected by a concrete [[mole (architecture)|mole]] (length approximately 930 metres, width 100 metres, mole surface 93,000 m2). A new pier finished in the late 1980s doubled the capacity of the port. The reinforced mole protects anchored vessels from strong northern winds.

Within the port operates a [[customs]] office facility and a [[Hellenic Coast Guard]] post. Sea traffic is limited to trade in the export of local produce, mainly citrus fruits, grapes, marble, aggregates and some domestic imports. The port operates as a contingency facility for general cargo ships, [[bulk carrier]]s and [[RORO]]s, in case of [[strike action|strike]]s at [[Piraeus]] port. There is a [[ferry]] line (RORO) connecting Corinth to [[Italy]].

==== Ferries ====
There was a [[ferry]] link to [[Catania]], [[Sicily]] and [[Genoa]]  in [[Italy]].

===Canal===
{{Main|Corinth Canal}}
[[File:Corinth Canal in an old postcard.jpg|thumb|The Corinth Canal in an old postcard.]]
[[File:Corinth Canal by Frank van Mierlo.jpg|thumb|View of the Corinth Canal.]]
[[File:Istmo de Corinto ESC large ISS011 ISS011-E-13188.JPG|thumb|Aerial photograph of the [[Isthmus of Corinth]].]]

The [[Corinth Canal]], carrying ship traffic between the western [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Aegean Sea]], is about {{convert|4|km}} east of the city, cutting through the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] that connects the Peloponnesian peninsula to the Greek mainland, thus effectively making the former an island. The builders dug the canal through the Isthmus at sea level; no locks are employed. It is {{convert|6.4|km}} in length and only {{convert|21.3|m}} wide at its base, making it impassable for most modern ships. It now has little economic importance.

The canal was mooted in classical times and an abortive effort was made to build it in the 1st century AD. Construction finally got underway in 1881 but was hampered by geological and financial problems that bankrupted the original builders. It was completed in 1893, but due to the canal's narrowness, navigational problems and periodic closures to repair landslips from its steep walls, it failed to attract the level of traffic anticipated by its operators. It is now used mainly for tourist traffic.

==Sport==
The city's [[association football]] team is [[Korinthos F.C.]] (''Π.Α.E. Κόρινθος''), established in 1999 after the merger of Pankorinthian Football Club (''Παγκορινθιακός'') and Corinth Football Club (''Κόρινθος''). During the 2006-2007 season, the team played in the Greek Fourth Division's Regional Group 7. The team went undefeated that season and it earned the top spot.<ref>[http://www.paskorinthos.gr/2006-2007.html ]  {{wayback|url=http://www.paskorinthos.gr/2006-2007.html |date=20100723000059 }}</ref> This granted the team a promotion to the [[Gamma Ethniki|Gamma Ethnikí (Third Division)]] for the 2007-2008 season. For the 2008-2009 season, Korinthos F.C. competed in the Gamma Ethniki (Third Division) southern grouping.
