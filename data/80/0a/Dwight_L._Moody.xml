His father, Edwin J. Moody (18001841), a small farmer and stonemason, died at the age of 41, when Dwight was only four years old; his mother was Betsey Moody (ne Holton; 18051896). They had five sons and a daughter before Dwight's birth, with twins, a boy and a girl, born one month after Edwin's death. His mother struggled to support the family, but even with her best effort, some of her children had to be sent off to work for their room and board. Dwight too was sent off, where he received cornmeal, porridge, and milk three times a day.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Johnson"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last">Johnson</arg><arg name="first">George</arg><arg name="title">What Will A Man Give In Exchange For His Soul?</arg><arg name="year">2011</arg><arg name="publisher">Xlibris Corporation</arg><arg name="isbn">1465380981</arg><arg name="pages">113â€“115</arg></template></extension><space/>He complained to his mother, but when she found out that he got all that he wanted to eat, she sent him back.

In April 1855 Moody was then converted to evangelical Christianity when his Sunday school teacher, Edward Kimball, talked to him about how much God loved him. His conversion sparked the start of his career as an evangelist. However, his first application for church membership, in May 1855, was rejected. He was not received as a church member until May 4, 1856. As his teacher, Edward Kimball, stated:</paragraph><paragraph><template><target>quote</target><arg>"I can truly say, and in saying it I magnify the infinite grace of God as bestowed upon him, that I have seen few persons whose minds were spiritually darker than was his when he came into my [[Sunday School]] class; and I think that the committee of the Mount Vernon Church seldom met an applicant for membership more unlikely ever to become a Christian of clear and decided views of Gospel truth, still less to fill any extended sphere of public usefulness."<ref>Moody (1900), 21</ref></arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>The Civil War</heading><paragraph><template><target>quote</target><arg>"The first meeting I ever saw him at was in a little old shanty that had been abandoned by a saloon-keeper. Mr. Moody had got the place to hold the meetings in at night. I went there a little late; and the first thing I saw was a man standing up with a few tallow candles around him, holding a negro boy, and trying to read to him the story of the Prodigal Son and a great many words he could not read out, and had to skip. I thought, 'If the Lord can ever use such an instrument as that for His honor and glory, it will astonish me. As a result of his tireless labor, within a year the average attendance at his school was 650, while 60 volunteers from various churches served as teachers. It became so well known that the just-elected [[Abraham Lincoln|President Lincoln]] visited and spoke at a Sunday School meeting on November 25, 1860."</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>D. L.
