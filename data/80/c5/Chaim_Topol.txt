'''Chaim Topol''' ({{lang-he|'''חיים טופול'''}}; born September 9, 1935), often billed simply as '''Topol''', is an Israeli [[theater|theatrical]] and [[film]] performer, singer, actor, comedian, voice artist, writer and producer. Best known of his role as [[Tevye]] the dairyman in the production of  [[Fiddler on the Roof]] on both stage and film. He has been nominated for an [[Academy Award]] and a [[Tony Award]], and has won two [[Golden Globe Award]]s.

==Early life==
Topol was born in [[Tel Aviv]] in 1935 in what was then the [[British Mandate of Palestine]], to Rel (née Goldman) and Jacob Topol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/86/Topol.html|title=Topol Film Reference biography|publisher=Filmreference.com|date=|accessdate=September 29, 2010}}</ref> He first practiced acting in amateur theatrical plays staged by the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli Army]]. Subsequently he established his own theatre troupe in Tel Aviv, and in 1961 he significantly contributed to the foundation of the [[Haifa Theatre|Haifa Municipal Theatre]].

==Acting career==
Among Topol's earliest film appearances was the lead role in the 1964 film ''[[Sallah Shabati]]'' by [[Ephraim Kishon]]—a play, later adapted for film, depicting the hardships of a [[Mizrahi Jew]]ish immigrant family in Israel of the early 1960s. The film was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] and earned the actor the [[Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year - Actor]]. In 1966, Topol made his first [[English language|English-language]] screen appearance as Abou Ibn Kaqden in the big-budget [[Mickey Marcus]] biopic ''[[Cast a Giant Shadow]]''.

He came to greatest prominence in the role of Tevye the milkman in the long-running musical show Fiddler on the Roof, at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]].<ref>[http://www.nodanw.com/shows_f/fiddler_on_the_roof.htm ''Fiddler On The Roof'' (The Guide to Musical Theatre)]. Retrieved December 29, 2007.</ref> After a major success on the [[West End theatre|West End]] stage, he later starred in the 1971 [[Fiddler on the Roof (film)|film version]].

In 1972, Topol won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor Oscar]] for his performance in the film. He was on active service with the [[Israeli Army]] at the time, but was granted permission to attend the awards ceremonies.<ref>[http://www.omanoot.com/Artist-175,1257-Chaim-Topol.aspx Topol's Biography at Omanoot]</ref>

In 1976, Topol originated the leading role of the baker, Amiable, in the new musical ''[[The Baker's Wife]]'', but was fired after eight months by producer [[David Merrick]]. In her autobiography, ''[[Patti LuPone]]: A Memoir'', his co-star in the production relayed that Topol behaved unprofessionally in front of paying audiences, sometimes speaking gibberish instead of his lines, and other times responding to the director's instructions by grossly overacting on purpose. Her account was echoed by the show's composer, [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]], in the book ''Defying Gravity: The Creative Career of Stephen Schwartz, From Godspell to Wicked'', in which he claimed that Topol's behavior greatly disturbed the cast and directors and resulted in the production not reaching Broadway as planned.

Some of Topol's other notable film appearances were the title role in ''[[Galileo (1975 film)|Galileo]]'' ([[1975 in film|1975]]), directed by Joseph Losey, Dr. Hans Zarkov in ''[[Flash Gordon (film)|Flash Gordon]]'' ([[1980 in film|1980]]), and as [[Milos Columbo]] in the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] movie ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'' ([[1981 in film|1981]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/18146/For-Your-Eyes-Only/cast|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=For Your Eyes Only}}</ref>

In 1983, he reprised the role of Tevye in a London revival of ''Fiddler on the Roof''. In the late 1980s, he played the role in a touring United States production. He was by then the approximate age of the character. Also, the actress playing his wife, Golde, in that production—[[Rosalind Harris]]—had played his eldest daughter, Tzeitel, in the film. In 1990, he again played the part in a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] revival of ''Fiddler'', and was nominated in 1991 for a [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical]], losing to [[Jonathan Pryce]]. He played the part again in a 1994 London revival, which became a touring production. He has since played the part in various productions including stages in Europe, Australia and Japan. His most recent film roles were in ''[[Left Luggage (film)|Left Luggage]]'' (1998) in the role of Mr. Apfelschnitt, and ''Time Elevator'' (1998) as Shalem.

Topol went to [[Australia]] in 2005, playing [[Tevye]] in ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'' at the [[Capitol Theatre, Sydney|Capitol Theatre]] in Sydney in November 2005, then returned in April 2006 to the [[Lyric Theatre, Brisbane|Lyric Theatre]] in Brisbane and in June 2006 to [[Her Majesty's Theatre, Melbourne|Her Majesty's Theatre]] in Melbourne.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/contributor/400539|title=Chaim Topol Male Performer|publisher=AusStage|date=June 10, 2006|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref> In April 2007, he played the role in [[Wellington]], New Zealand.

In September 2008, Topol played the part of Honore in ''[[Gigi]]'' at the [[Open Air Theatre]] in [[Regent's Park]], London.

On January 20, 2009, Topol began a farewell tour of ''Fiddler on the Roof'' as Tevye, opening in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], USA. He was forced to withdraw from the tour owing to a shoulder injury, and made his last appearance as Tevye in Boston, Massachusetts on November 15, 2009. ([[Theodore Bikel]] and [[Harvey Fierstein]], both of whom have portrayed Tevye on Broadway, replaced him in scheduled appearances.) <ref>{{cite web|last=Propst|first=Andy|url=http://www.theatermania.com/touring-productions/news/11-2009/harvey-fierstein-replaces-topol-in-fiddler-on-the_22808.html|title=Harvey Fierstein Replaces Topol in Fiddler on the Roof Tour: Theater News on TheaterMania.com – 11/11/2009|publisher=Theatermania.com|date=November 11, 2009|accessdate=September 29, 2010}}</ref>
