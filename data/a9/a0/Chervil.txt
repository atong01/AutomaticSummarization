'''Chervil''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɜr|,|v|ɪ|l}}; '''''Anthriscus cerefolium'''''), sometimes called '''garden chervil''' to distinguish it from similar plants also called chervil, or '''French parsley''', is a delicate [[annual plant|annual]] [[herb]] related to [[parsley]]. It is commonly used to season mild-flavoured dishes and is a constituent of the French herb mixture [[fines herbes]].

==Biology==
A member of the [[Apiaceae]], chervil is native to the [[Caucasus]] but was spread by the Romans through most of Europe, where it is now naturalised.<ref name="OBFP">{{cite book | last =Vaughan | first =J.G.   | authorlink = |author2=Geissler, C.A. | title =The New Oxford Book of Food Plants | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1997}}</ref>

The plants grow to {{convert|40|-|70|cm|abbr=on}}, with tripinnate leaves that may be curly. The small white flowers form small umbels, {{convert|2.54|-|5|cm|abbr=on}} across. The fruit is about 1&nbsp;cm long, oblong-ovoid with a slender, ridged beak.<ref name="OBFP"/>

Chervil is used, particularly in France, to season [[poultry]], [[seafood]], young spring [[vegetable]]s (such as carrots), soups, and sauces. More delicate than parsley, it has a faint taste of [[liquorice]] or [[aniseed]].<ref name="S&S">{{cite book|title=Simon & Schuster's Guide to Herbs and Spices |editor=Stanley Schuler |isbn=0-671-73489-X |author=Gualtiero Simonetti |year=1990 |publisher=Simon & Schuster, Inc}}</ref>

Chervil is one of the four traditional French ''fines herbes'', along with tarragon, chives, and parsley, which are essential to French cooking.<ref>[[Julia Child]], ''Mastering the Art of French Cooking'' vol. I p 18.</ref> Unlike the more pungent, robust herbs, thyme, rosemary, etc., which can take prolonged cooking, the ''fines herbes'' are added at the last minute, to salads, omelettes, and soups. 

===Horticulture===
According to some, [[slug]]s are attracted to chervil and the plant is sometimes used to bait them.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?isbn=160529179X,Fern Marshall Bradley, Barbara W. Ellis, Deborah L. Martin, "Chervil is irresistible to slugs" in ''The Organic Gardener's Handbook of Natural Pest and Disease'', Page 363.]</ref>

===Health===
Chervil has had various uses in folk medicine. It was claimed to be useful as a [[digestion|digestive]] aid, for lowering [[high blood pressure]], and, infused with [[vinegar]], for curing [[hiccups]].<ref name="TBC">{{cite book | last =McGee | first =Rose Marie Nichols  | authorlink = |author2=Stuckey, Maggie | title =The Bountiful Container | publisher = Workman Publishing | year = 2002}}</ref> Besides its digestive properties, it is used as a mild stimulant.<ref name="S&S" />

Chervil has also been implicated in "strimmer [[dermatitis]]", or [[phytophotodermatitis]], due to spray from weed trimmers and other forms of contact.  Other plants in the family [[Apiaceae]] can have similar effects.<ref>{{cite web|last=Drugge|first=Rhett|last2=Dunn|first2=Heather|title=Botanical Dermatology  Phytophotodermatitis|work=Electronic Textbook of Dermatology|publisher=The Internet Dermatology Society, Inc|url=http://telemedicine.org/botanica/bot5.htm|accessdate=12 March 2012}}</ref>

==Cultivation==
Transplanting chervil can be difficult, due to the long [[taproot]].<ref name="TBC"/> It prefers a cool and moist location; otherwise, it rapidly goes to seed (also known as [[bolting (horticulture)|bolting]]).<ref name="TBC"/> It is usually grown as a cool-season crop, like lettuce, and should be planted in early spring and late fall or in a winter greenhouse. Regular harvesting of leaves also helps to prevent bolting.<ref name="TBC"/> If plants bolt despite precautions, the plant can be periodically re-sown throughout the growing season, thus producing fresh plants as older plants bolt and go out of production.

Chervil grows to a height of {{convert|12|to|24|in}}, and a width of {{convert|6|to|12|in}}.<ref name="TBC"/>
