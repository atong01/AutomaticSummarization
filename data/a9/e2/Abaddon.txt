The Hebrew term '''''Abaddon''''' ({{lang-he|אֲבַדּוֹן}}, ''{{lang|he-Latn|'Ǎḇaddōn}}''), and its Greek equivalent '''''Apollyon''''' ({{lang-gr|Ἀπολλύων}}, ''Apollyon''), appears in the [[Bible]] as both a place of destruction and as the name of an [[angel]]. In the [[Hebrew Bible]], ''abaddon'' is used with reference to a bottomless pit, often appearing alongside the place שאול (''[[sheol]]''), meaning the realm of the dead. In the New Testament [[Book of Revelation]], an angel called Abaddon is described as the king of an army of [[locust]]s; his name is first transcribed in Greek (Revelation 9:11&mdash;"whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon" (Ἀβαδδὼν)), and then translated ("which in Greek means the Destroyer" (Ἀπολλύων, ''Apollyon'')). The Latin [[Vulgate]] and the [[Douay Rheims Bible]] have additional notes (not present in the Greek text), "in Latin Exterminans", ''exterminans'' being the Latin word for "destroyer".

==Etymology==
According to the [[Brown Driver Briggs]] lexicon, the Hebrew ''abaddon'' (Hebrew: אבדון; avadon) is an intensive form of the [[Semitic root]] and verb stem ''abad'' (אָבַד) "perish" (transitive "destroy"), which occurs 184 times in the Hebrew Bible. The [[Septuagint]], an early Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, renders "abaddon" as "ἀπώλεια",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studylight.org/com/jab/view.cgi?bk=65&ch=9 |title=Revelation 9:1 - Johann Albrecht Bengel's Gnomon of the New Testament - Commentaries |publisher=StudyLight.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-05}}</ref> while the Greek ''Apollyon'' comes from ''apollumi'' ([[:wikt:ἀπόλλυμι|ἀπόλλυμι]]), "to destroy". The Greek term ''Apollyon'' ([[:wikt:Ἀπολλύων|Ἀπολλύων]], "the destroyer"), is the [[active participle]] of ''apollumi'' ([[:wikt:ἀπόλλυμι|ἀπόλλυμι]], "to destroy"),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=a%29po%2Flluwn&la=greek |title=Greek Word Study Tool |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-04-05}}</ref> and is not used as a name in classical Greek texts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=a)po%252Fllumi&la=greek#lexicon |title=Greek Word Study Tool |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-04-05}}</ref>

==Judaism==
===Hebrew Bible===
The term ''abaddon'' appears six times in the [[Masoretic text]] of the Hebrew Bible; ''abaddon'' means destruction or "place of destruction", or the realm of the dead, and is accompanied by [[Sheol]]. 
* [[Book of Job|Job]] 26:6: the grave (Sheol) is naked before Him, and destruction (Abaddon) has no covering.
* Job 28:22: destruction (Abaddon) and death say...
* Job 31:12: it is a fire that consumes to destruction (Abaddon)...
* [[Book of Psalms|Psalm]] 88:11: Shall thy loving kindness be declared in the grave (Sheol) or thy faithfulness in destruction (Abaddon)?
* [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 15:11: Hell (Sheol) and Destruction (Abaddon) are before the LORD, how much more than the hearts of the children of men?
* Proverbs 27:20: Hell (Sheol) and Destruction (Abaddon) are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied. ([[Authorised King James Version|KJV]], 1611)

===Second Temple era texts===
The text of the [[Thanksgiving Hymns]]&mdash;which was found in the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]&mdash;tells of "the Sheol of Abaddon" and of the "torrents of [[Belial]] [that] burst into Abaddon". The ''[[Pseudo-Philo|Biblical Antiquities]]'' (misattributed to [[Philo]]) mentions Abaddon as a place (destruction) rather than an individual. Abaddon is also one of the compartments of [[Gehenna]].<ref name="oxford">{{cite book|last1=Metzger|first1=Bruce M.|last2=Coogan|first2=Michael David|title=The Oxford Companion to the Bible|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199743916|page=3}}</ref> By extension, it can mean an underworld abode of lost souls, or [[Gehenna]].

===Rabbinical literature===
In some legends, Abaddon is identified as a realm where the [[Damnation|damned]] lie in fire and snow, one of the places in [[Gehenna]] that [[Moses]] visited.<ref name="Ginzberg">{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/loj/loj206.htm |title=Chapter IV: Moses in Egypt |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-03}}</ref>

==Christianity==

===New Testament===
The [[Scriptures#Christianity|Christian scriptures]] contain the first known depiction of ''Abaddon'' as an individual entity instead of a place.

In [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 9:11, Abaddon is described as "Destroyer",<ref name="biblegateway">{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%209:11&version=NIV |title=Revelation 9:11 NIV - They had as king over them the angel of |publisher=Bible Gateway |date= |accessdate=2014-04-05}}</ref> the angel of the [[Abyss (religion)|abyss]],<ref name="biblegateway"/> and as the king of a plague of locusts resembling horses with crowned human faces, women's hair, lions' teeth, wings, iron breast-plates, and a tail with a scorpion's stinger that torments for five months anyone who does not have the seal of God on their foreheads.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%209:7-10&version=NIV |title=Revelation 9:7-10 NIV - The locusts looked like horses prepared |publisher=Bible Gateway |date= |accessdate=2014-04-03}}</ref>

The symbolism of Revelation 9:11 leaves the identity of Abaddon open to interpretation. Protestant commentator [[Matthew Henry]] (1708) believed Abaddon to be the [[Antichrist]],<ref name="henry">[http://www.blueletterbible.org/commentaries/comm_view.cfm?AuthorID=4&contentID=1868&commInfo=5&topic=Revelation ] {{wayback|url=http://www.blueletterbible.org/commentaries/comm_view.cfm?AuthorID=4&contentID=1868&commInfo=5&topic=Revelation |date=20150607035557 }}</ref> whereas the [[Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Commentary]] (1871) and [[Henry H. Halley]] (1922) identified the angel as Satan.<ref name="jfb">[http://www.blueletterbible.org/Comm/jfb/Rev/Rev_009.cfm=Revelation ] {{wayback|url=http://www.blueletterbible.org/Comm/jfb/Rev/Rev_009.cfm=Revelation |date=20150102101859 }}</ref><ref name="halley">Halley (1922) ''Halley's Bible Handbook with the New International Version'', p936.</ref><ref name="bbc">[[William MacDonald (Christian author)]] (1995) ''Believer's Bible Commentary'', p2366.</ref> [[Latter Day Saint movement|Latter-Day Saints]] believe that the use of "Abaddon" in Revelation 9 refers to the devil.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bd/abaddon?lang=eng&letter=a |title=Abaddon |publisher=Lds.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}</ref>

In contrast, the [[Methodist]] publication ''The Interpreter's Bible'' states: "Abaddon, however, is an angel not of Satan but of God, performing his work of destruction at God's bidding."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Keck|first1=Leander E.|title=The New Interpreter's Bible: Hebrews - Revelation (Volume 12)|date=1998|publisher=Abingdon Press|location=Nashville, Tenn.|isbn=0687278252|edition=[Nachdr.]}}</ref> [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] hold that Abaddon is another name for Jesus Christ after his resurrection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1200000007 |title=Abaddon&mdash;Watchtower Online Library|publisher=Watch Tower Society|accessdate=2014-04-05}}</ref>

===Gnostic Texts===
In the 3rd century [[Acts of Thomas]], Abaddon is the name of a demon, or the [[devil]] himself.

Abaddon is given particularly important roles in two sources, a homily entitled "The Enthronement of Abbaton" by pseudo-[[Timothy of Alexandria]], and the [[Resurrection of Jesus Christ (by Bartholomew)|Apocalypse of Bartholomew]].<ref name=Aziz>{{cite book|last1=Atiya|first1=Aziz S.|title=The Coptic Encyclopedia|date=1991|publisher=Macmillan [u.a.]|location=New York|isbn=0-02-897025-X}}</ref> In the homily by Timothy, Abbaton was first named ''Muriel'', and had been given the task by [[God]] of collecting the earth which would be used in the creation of [[Adam]]. Upon completion of this task, the angel was appointed as a guardian. Everyone, including the angels, demons, and corporeal entities feared him. Abbaton was promised that any who venerated him in life could be saved. Abaddon is also said to have a prominent role in the [[Last Judgement]], as the one who will take the souls to the [[Valley of Josaphat]].<ref name=Aziz/> He is described in the Apocalypse of Bartholomew as being present in the [[Tomb of Jesus]] at the moment of his [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pseudepigrapha.com/LostBooks/bartholomew.htm |title=Gospel Of Bartholomew |publisher=Pseudepigrapha.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-03}}</ref>
