'''Calcium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&nbsp;'''Ca''' and [[atomic number]]&nbsp;20. Calcium is a soft gray [[alkaline earth metal]], [[Abundance of the chemical elements|fifth-most-abundant element by mass]] in the [[Earth]]'s [[Crust (geology)|crust]]. The ion Ca<sup>2+</sup> is also the fifth-most-abundant dissolved [[ion]] in [[seawater]] by both [[molarity]] and mass, after [[sodium]], [[chloride]], [[magnesium]], and [[sulfate]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Handbook of method for the analysis of the various parameters of the carbon dioxide system in sea water, version 2|author= Dickson, A. G.|author2= Goyet, C.|last-author-amp= yes |publisher =ORNL/CDIAC-74|date=1994|url=http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ftp/cdiac74/chapter5.pdf| chapter=Chapter 5}}</ref> Free calcium metal is too reactive to occur in nature.  Calcium is produced [[Supernova nucleosynthesis|in the explosions at the end of the life of massive stars]]

Calcium is essential for living [[organism]]s, in particular in [[Cell (biology)|cell]] [[physiology]], where movement of the calcium ion into and out of the [[cytoplasm]] functions as a signal for many cellular processes. As a major material used in mineralization of [[bone]], [[tooth|teeth]] and [[exoskeleton|shells]], calcium is the most abundant [[metal]] by mass in many [[animal]]s.

==Notable characteristics==
[[File:FlammenfärbungCa.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Flame test]]. Brick-red color originates from calcium.]]
In chemical terms, calcium is reactive and soft for a metal; though harder than [[lead]], it can be cut with a knife with difficulty. It is a silvery metallic element that must be extracted by [[electrolysis]] from a fused [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] like [[calcium chloride]].<ref name="pauling">{{Cite book|author=Pauling, Linus|title= General Chemistry|page= 627|date= 1970|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=0-7167-0149-9}}</ref> Once produced, it rapidly forms a gray-white coating of [[calcium oxide]] and [[calcium nitride]]  for reacting with the [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]] in the [[air]] when exposed to it. In bulk form (typically as chips or "turnings"), the metal is somewhat difficult to ignite, more so even than magnesium chips; but, when lit, the metal burns in air with a brilliant high-intensity orange-red light. Calcium metal reacts with [[water]], generating hydrogen gas at a rate rapid enough to be noticeable, but not fast enough at room temperature to generate much heat, making it useful for generating hydrogen.<ref>Theodore Gray. ''The Elements''. Page 55</ref> In powdered form, however, the reaction with water is extremely rapid, as the increased surface area of the powder accelerates the reaction with the water. Part of the reason for the slowness of the calcium–water reaction is a result of the metal being partly protected by insoluble white [[calcium hydroxide]]; in water solutions of acids, where this salt is soluble, calcium reacts vigorously.

With a density of 1.54 g/cm<sup>3</sup>,<ref>http://education.jlab.org/itselemental/ele020.html</ref> calcium is the lightest of the alkaline earth metals; magnesium ([[specific gravity]] 1.74) and beryllium (1.84) are denser though lighter in atomic mass. From strontium onward, the alkali earth metals become denser with increasing atomic mass.

Calcium has two [[Allotropy|allotropes]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF02873196|title=The Ca−Li (Calcium-Lithium) system|journal=Journal of Phase Equilibria|volume=8|issue=2|pages=125|date=1987|last1=Bale|first1=C. W.|last2=Pelton|first2=A. D.}}</ref>

Calcium has a higher electrical resistivity than [[copper]] or [[aluminium]], yet weight-for-weight, due to its much lower density, it is a better conductor than either. Its use as such in terrestrial applications is usually limited by its high reactivity with air; however, it has potential for use as wiring in off-world applications.<ref>{{cite web

Calcium salts are colorless from any contribution of the calcium, and ionic solutions of calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) are colorless as well. As with [[magnesium]] salts and other alkaline earth metal salts, calcium salts are often quite soluble in water. Notable exceptions include [[calcium hydroxide]], [[calcium sulfate]] (unusual for [[sulfate]] salts), [[calcium carbonate]] and [[tricalcium phosphate]]. With the exception of calcium sulfate, even the insoluble calcium salts listed are in general more soluble than the [[transition metal]] counterparts. When in solution, the calcium ion varies remarkably to the human taste, being reported as mildly salty, sour, "mineral-like" or even "soothing." It is apparent that many animals can taste, or develop a taste, for calcium, and use this sense to detect the mineral in [[salt lick]]s or other sources.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://physrev.physiology.org/content/81/4/1567.full.pdf |title=Calcium: Taste, Intake, and Appetite|author=Tordoff, M. G.|volume= 81|issue=4 |journal=Physiological Reviews|pmid=11581497|date=2001|pages=1567–97}}</ref> In human nutrition, soluble calcium salts may be added to tart juices without much effect to the average palate.

Calcium is the fifth-most-abundant element by mass in the human body, where it is an important cellular ionic messenger with many functions. Calcium also serves as a structural element in bone. It is the relatively high-atomic-number calcium in the skeleton that causes bone to be radio-opaque. Of the human body's solid components after drying and burning of organics (as for example, after [[cremation]]), about a third of the total "mineral" mass remaining is the approximately one kilogram of calcium that composes the average skeleton (the remainder being mostly phosphorus and oxygen).

===H and K lines===
Visible spectra of many stars, including the [[Sun]], exhibit strong [[Spectral line|absorption lines]] of singly ionized calcium. Prominent among these are the H-line at 3968.5&nbsp;[[Ångstrom|Å]] and the K line at 3933.7&nbsp;Å of singly ionized calcium, or Ca&nbsp;II. When observing the Sun, or stars with low temperatures, the prominence of the H and K lines in the visible spectra can be an indication of strong magnetic activity in the [[chromosphere]]. Measurement of periodic variations of these active regions can also be used to deduce the rotation periods of these stars.<ref>{{cite web

==Compounds==
{{Category see also|Calcium compounds}}
Calcium, combined with [[phosphate]], forming [[hydroxylapatite]], is the mineral portion of human and animal bones and teeth. The mineral portion of some [[coral]]s can also be transformed into hydroxylapatite.

Calcium forms a family of [[ionic compound]]s known as lime; they are all [[alkaline]] white powders (at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|STP]]). [[Calcium carbonate]] (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) is one of the common compounds of calcium and occurs naturally as [[limestone]] and [[chalk]]. When heated at high temperature (above 825&nbsp;°C), it forms [[calcium oxide]] (CaO), also known as quicklime. When added to water (H<sub>2</sub>O), quicklime vigorously reacts (hence its name) to form [[calcium hydroxide]] (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>). Also known as slaked lime, this substance is an inexpensive base material used throughout the chemical industry. When mixed with sand, it hardens into a [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and is turned into [[plaster]] by [[carbon dioxide]] uptake. Mixed with other compounds, lime forms an important part of [[Portland cement]].

When water percolates through limestone or other soluble [[carbonate]]-containing rocks, it partially dissolves the rock and causes cave formation with their characteristic [[stalactite]]s and [[stalagmite]]s, and also forms [[hard water]]. Other important calcium compounds are [[calcium nitrate]], [[calcium sulfide]], [[calcium chloride]], [[calcium carbide]], [[calcium cyanamide]] and [[calcium hypochlorite]].

A few calcium compounds where calcium is in the oxidation state +1 have also been investigated recently.<ref name="West"/> [[Charlotte Froese Fischer]] predicted that a Ca<sup>−</sup> ion would be stable; this ion was discovered experimentally in 1987.<ref>
{{cite journal | title=Evidence for a stable negative ion of calcium | journal=Phys. Rev. Lett. | volume=59 |page=2267 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.59.2267|bibcode = 1987PhRvL..59.2267P }}</ref>

==Isotopes==
{{Main|Isotopes of calcium}}
Calcium has five stable [[isotope]]s (<sup>40</sup>Ca, <sup>42</sup>Ca, <sup>43</sup>Ca, <sup>44</sup>Ca and <sup>46</sup>Ca), plus one more isotope ([[Calcium-48|<sup>48</sup>Ca]]) that has such a long half-life that for all practical purposes it can also be considered stable. The 20% range in relative mass among naturally occurring calcium isotopes is greater than for any other element except hydrogen and helium. Calcium also has a [[cosmogenic isotope]], [[radioactive]] <sup>41</sup>Ca, which has a [[half-life]] of 103,000 years. Unlike [[cosmogenic isotope]]s that are produced in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], <sup>41</sup>Ca is produced by [[neutron activation]] of <sup>40</sup>Ca. Most of its production is in the upper metre or so of the soil column, where the cosmogenic neutron flux is still sufficiently strong. <sup>41</sup>Ca has received much attention in stellar studies because it decays to <sup>41</sup>K, a critical indicator of solar-system anomalies.

Ninety-seven percent of naturally occurring calcium is in the form of <sup>40</sup>Ca. <sup>40</sup>Ca is one of the daughter products of <sup>40</sup>K decay, along with <sup>40</sup>Ar. While [[K–Ar dating]] has been used extensively in the [[geology|geological]] sciences, the prevalence of <sup>40</sup>Ca in nature has impeded its use in dating. Techniques using [[mass spectrometry]] and a double spike isotope dilution have been used for [[Potassium|K]]-Ca age dating.

The most abundant isotope, <sup>40</sup>Ca, has a nucleus of 20 [[proton]]s and 20 [[neutron]]s. This is the heaviest stable isotope of any element that has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. In supernova explosions, calcium is formed from the reaction of carbon with various numbers of alpha particles (helium nuclei), until the most common calcium isotope (containing 10 helium nuclei) has been synthesized.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

===Isotope fractionation===
As with the isotopes of other elements, a variety of processes fractionate, or alter the relative abundance of, calcium isotopes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Russell|first1=WA|last2=Papanastassiou|first2=DA|last3=Tombrello|first3=TA|title=Ca isotope fractionation on the earth and other solar system materials|journal=Geochim Cosmochim Acta|date=1978|volume=42|pages=1075–90|doi=10.1016/0016-7037(78)90105-9|issue=8|bibcode = 1978GeCoA..42.1075R }}</ref> The best studied of these processes is the mass-dependent [[Isotope fractionation|fractionation]] of calcium isotopes that accompanies the precipitation of calcium minerals, such as [[calcite]], [[aragonite]] and [[apatite]], from solution. Isotopically light calcium is preferentially incorporated into minerals, leaving the solution from which the mineral precipitated enriched in isotopically heavy calcium. At room temperature the magnitude of this fractionation is roughly 0.25‰ (0.025%) per atomic mass unit (AMU). Mass-dependent differences in calcium isotope composition conventionally are expressed the ratio of two isotopes (usually <sup>44</sup>Ca/<sup>40</sup>Ca) in a sample compared to the same ratio in a standard reference material. <sup>44</sup>Ca/<sup>40</sup>Ca varies by about 1% among common earth materials.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Skulan|first1=J|last2=Depaolo|first2=DJ|title=Calcium isotope fractionation between soft and mineralized tissues as a monitor of calcium use in vertebrates|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|date=1999|volume=96|pages=13709–13|doi=10.1073/pnas.96.24.13709|pmid=10570137|issue=24|pmc=24129 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/96/24/13709.full.pdf |bibcode = 1999PNAS...9613709S }}</ref>

Calcium isotope fractionation during mineral formation has led to several applications of calcium isotopes. In particular, the 1997 observation by Skulan and DePaolo<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Skulan|first1=J|title=Biological control of calcium isotopic abundances in the global calcium cycle|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta |date=June 1997 | volume=61|pages=2505–10|last2=Depaolo|first2=DJ | first3 = TL | last3= Owens |issue=12|doi=10.1016/S0016-7037(97)00047-1 | bibcode = 1997GeCoA..61.2505S }}</ref> that calcium minerals are isotopically lighter than the solutions from which the minerals precipitate is the basis of analogous applications in medicine and in paleooceanography. In animals with skeletons mineralized with calcium the calcium isotopic composition of soft tissues reflects the relative rate of formation and dissolution of skeletal mineral. In humans changes in the calcium isotopic composition of urine have been shown to be related to changes in bone mineral balance. When the rate of bone formation exceeds the rate of bone resorption, soft tissue <sup>44</sup>Ca/<sup>40</sup>Ca rises. Soft tissue <sup>44</sup>Ca/<sup>40</sup>Ca falls when bone resorption exceeds bone formation. Because of this relationship, calcium isotopic measurements of urine or blood may be useful in the early detection of metabolic bone diseases like [[osteoporosis]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Skulan|first1=J|title=Natural calcium isotopic composition of urine as a marker of bone mineral balance|pmid=17463176|journal=Clinical Chemistry|date=2007|volume=653|pages=1155–1158|last2=Bullen|first2=T|last3=Anbar|first3=AD|last4=Puzas|first4=JE|last5=Shackelford|first5=L|last6=Leblanc|first6=A|last7=Smith|first7=SM|issue=6|doi=10.1373/clinchem.2006.080143 | url = http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/reprint/53/6/1155.pdf }}</ref>

A similar system exists in the ocean, where seawater <sup>44</sup>Ca/<sup>40</sup>Ca tends to rise when the rate of removal of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from seawater by mineral precipitation exceeds the input of new calcium into the ocean, and fall when calcium input exceeds mineral precipitation. It follows that rising <sup>44</sup>Ca/<sup>40</sup>Ca corresponds to falling seawater Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, and falling <sup>44</sup>Ca/<sup>40</sup>Ca corresponds to rising seawater Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. In 1997 Skulan and DePaolo presented the first evidence of change in seawater <sup>44</sup>Ca/<sup>40</sup>Ca over geologic time, along with a theoretical explanation of these changes. More recent papers have confirmed this observation, demonstrating that seawater Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration is not constant, and that the ocean probably never is in “steady state” with respect to its calcium input and output.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Fantle|first1=M|last2=Depaolo|first2=D|title=Ca isotopes in carbonate sediment and pore fluid from ODP Site 807A: The Ca<sup>2+</sup>(aq)–calcite equilibrium fractionation factor and calcite recrystallization rates in Pleistocene sediments|journal=Geochim Cosmochim Acta|date=2007|volume=71|pages=2524–2546|doi=10.1016/j.gca.2007.03.006|issue=10|bibcode=2007GeCoA..71.2524F}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Griffith|first1=Elizabeth M.|title=A Dynamic marine calcium cycle during the past 28 million years|pmid=19074345|journal=Science|date=2008|volume=322|pages=1671–1674|last2= Paytan |first2= Adina |last3= Caldeira |first3= Ken|last4= Bullen |first4= Thomas |last5= Thomas |first5= Ellen |issue=12|doi=10.1126/science.1163614 |bibcode = 2008Sci...322.1671G }}</ref> This has important climatological implications, as the marine calcium cycle is closely tied to the [[carbon cycle]] (see below).

==Geochemical cycling==
Calcium provides an important link between [[tectonics]], [[climate]] and the [[carbon cycle]]. In the simplest terms, uplift of mountains exposes Ca-bearing rocks to chemical weathering and releases Ca<sup>2+</sup> into surface water. This Ca<sup>2+</sup> eventually is transported to the ocean where it reacts with dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> to form [[limestone]]. Some of this limestone settles to the sea floor where it is incorporated into new rocks. Dissolved CO<sub>2</sub>, along with [[carbonate]] and [[bicarbonate]] ions, are referred to as [[Total inorganic carbon|dissolved inorganic carbon]] (DIC).

[[Image:Pamukkale Hierapolis Travertine pools.JPG|thumb| right| [[Travertine]] terraces [[Pamukkale]], Turkey]]

The actual reaction is more complicated and involves the bicarbonate ion (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>) that forms when CO<sub>2</sub> reacts with water at seawater [[pH]]:

: {{chem|Ca|2+}} + 2{{chem|HCO|3|-}} → {{chem|CaCO|3}} (limestone) + {{chem|CO|2}} + {{chem|H|2|O}}

Note that at ocean pH most of the CO<sub>2</sub> produced in this reaction is immediately converted back into {{chem|HCO|3|-}}. The reaction results in a net transport of one molecule of CO<sub>2</sub> from the ocean/atmosphere into the [[lithosphere]].<ref>{{cite web

The result is that each Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion released by chemical weathering ultimately removes one CO<sub>2</sub> molecule from the surficial system (atmosphere, ocean, soils and living organisms), storing it in carbonate rocks where it is likely to stay for hundreds of millions of years. The weathering of calcium from rocks thus scrubs CO<sub>2</sub> from the ocean and atmosphere, exerting a strong long-term effect on climate.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Berner|first1=Robert|title= The long-term carbon cycle, fossil fuels and atmospheric composition |journal=Nature|date=2003|volume=426|pages= 323–326|doi=10.1038/nature02131|pmid=14628061|issue=6964|bibcode = 2003Natur.426..323B }}</ref>
Analogous cycles involving magnesium, and to a much smaller extent strontium and barium, have the same effect.

As the weathering of limestone (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) liberates equimolar amounts of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and CO<sub>2</sub>, it has no net effect on the CO<sub>2</sub> content of the atmosphere and ocean. The weathering of [[silicate]] rocks like [[granite]], on the other hand, is a net CO<sub>2</sub> sink because it produces abundant Ca<sup>2+</sup> but very little CO<sub>2</sub>.

Calcium is an important component of a [[healthy diet]] and a [[Dietary mineral|mineral]] necessary for life. The [[National Osteoporosis Foundation]] says, "Calcium plays an important role in building stronger, denser bones early in life and keeping bones strong and healthy later in life." Approximately 99 percent of the body's calcium is stored in the bones and teeth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/calcium/ |title=Dietary Supplement Fact Sheet: Calcium |publisher=Office of Dietary Supplements, NIH |accessdate=2011-03-31}}</ref> The rest of the calcium in the body has other important uses, such as some [[exocytosis]], especially [[chemical synapse#Neurotransmitter release|neurotransmitter release]], and [[muscle contraction]]. In the [[electrical conduction system of the heart]], calcium replaces sodium as the mineral that depolarizes the cell, proliferating the action potential. In cardiac muscle, sodium influx commences an action potential, but during potassium efflux, the cardiac myocyte experiences calcium influx, prolonging the action potential and creating a plateau phase of dynamic equilibrium. Long-term [[Hypocalcaemia|calcium deficiency]] can lead to [[rickets]] and poor [[Coagulation|blood clotting]] and in case of a menopausal woman, it can lead to [[osteoporosis]], in which the bone deteriorates and there is an increased risk of fractures. While a lifelong deficit can affect bone and tooth formation, over-retention can cause [[hypercalcemia]] (elevated levels of calcium in the blood), impaired kidney function and decreased absorption of other minerals.<ref name="committee">{{Cite book|author=Standing Committee on the Scientific Evaluation of Dietary Reference Intakes, Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium, Phosphorus, Magnesium, Vitamin D and fluoride|location= Washington DC|publisher= The National Academies Press|date= 1997|isbn=0-309-06403-1 | url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=5776 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title = Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium and Vitamin D | display-editors = 4 | editor = A.

[[Dairy product]]s, such as milk and cheese, are a well-known source of calcium. Some individuals are allergic to dairy products and even more people, in particular those of non Indo-European descent, are [[Lactose intolerance|lactose-intolerant]], leaving them unable to consume non-fermented dairy products in quantities larger than about half a liter per serving. Others, such as [[vegans]], avoid dairy products for ethical and health reasons.

Many good vegetable sources of calcium exist, including [[seaweeds]] such as [[kelp]], [[wakame]] and [[hijiki]]; nuts and seeds like [[almond]]s, [[hazelnut]]s, [[sesame]], and [[pistachio]]; blackstrap [[molasses]]; [[beans]] (especially [[soy beans]]); [[figs]]; [[quinoa]]; [[okra]]; [[rutabaga]]; [[broccoli]]; [[dandelion]] leaves; and [[kale]]. In addition, several foods and drinks, such as [[orange juice]], [[soy milk]], [[tofu]], breakfast cereals, and breads are often [[Food fortification|fortified]] with calcium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002412.htm|title=Calcium in Diet|accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref>

Numerous vegetables, notably [[spinach]], [[chard]] and [[rhubarb]] have a high calcium content, but they may also contain varying amounts of [[oxalic acid]] that binds calcium and reduces its absorption.
The same problem may to a degree affect the absorption of calcium from [[amaranth]], [[collard greens]], and [[chicory]] greens.
This process may also be related to the generation of [[calcium oxalate]].

An overlooked source of calcium is eggshell, which can be ground into a powder and mixed into food or a glass of water.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schaafsma, Anne |author2=Beelen, Gerard M |last-author-amp=yes|title=Eggshell powder, a comparable or better source of calcium than purified calcium carbonate: piglet studies|journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture |volume=79 |issue=12 |pages=1596–1600 |date=1999 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199909)79:12<1596::AID-JSFA406>3.0.CO;2-A }}</ref><ref name="pmid12064336">{{cite journal |author=Schaafsma A |author2=van Doormaal JJ |author3=Muskiet FA |author4=Hofstede GJ |author5=Pakan I |author6=van der Veer E |title=Positive effects of a chicken eggshell powder-enriched vitamin-mineral supplement on femoral neck bone mineral density in healthy late post-menopausal Dutch women |journal=Br.

===Dietary supplements===
[[Image:500 mg calcium supplements with vitamin D.jpg|thumb|500 milligram calcium supplements made from [[calcium carbonate]]]]
Calcium supplements are used to prevent and to treat calcium deficiencies. Office of Dietary Supplements (National Institutes of Health) recommends that no more than 600&nbsp;mg of supplement should be taken at a time because the percent of calcium absorbed decreases as the amount of calcium in the supplement increases.<ref name="DietaryFactSheet"/> It is therefore recommended to spread doses throughout the day.<ref name="ODS Quick Fact">[http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Calcium-QuickFacts/ "Dietary Supplement Fact Sheet: Calcium – Quick Facts] — Retrieved 2013-08-23</ref> Recommended daily calcium intake for adults ranges from 1000 to 1300&nbsp;mg.<ref name="ODS Quick Fact"/> Calcium supplements may have side effects such as bloating and constipation in some people. It is suggested that taking the supplements with food may aid in nullifying these side effects.<ref name="ODS Quick Fact"/>

[[Vitamin D]] is added to some calcium supplements. Proper vitamin D status is important because vitamin D is converted to a hormone in the body, which then induces the synthesis of intestinal proteins responsible for calcium absorption.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Combs, G |title=The Vitamins| page=161|publisher= Academic Press|date= 2008|isbn=0-12-183490-5}}</ref>

* [[Milk]] is an excellent source of dietary calcium for those whose bodies tolerate it because it has a high concentration of calcium and the calcium in milk is excellently absorbed.<ref name="Weaver"/>
* [[Soymilk]] and other vegetable milks are usually sold with calcium added so that their calcium concentration is as high as in milk.
* Also different kind of [[juice]]s boosted with calcium are widely available.
* [[Calcium carbonate]] is the most common and least expensive calcium supplement. It should be taken with food, and depends on low pH levels (acidic) for proper absorption in the intestine.<ref>{{cite book

Calcium lactate and calcium gluconate are less concentrated forms of calcium and are not practical oral supplements.<ref name = "osgknm"/>

===Bone health===
Calcium supplementation is generally not necessary for maintaining [[bone mineral density]], and carries risks and costs that outweigh any benefits.<ref>{{vcite2 journal |vauthors=Reid IR, Bristow SM, Bolland MJ |title=Calcium supplements: benefits and risks |journal=J. Intern. Med. |volume= |issue= |pages= |year=2015 |pmid=26174589 |doi=10.1111/joim.12394 |type=Review}}</ref>

===Cardiovascular impact===
A study investigating the effects of personal calcium supplement use on cardiovascular risk in the [[Women's Health Initiative#Calcium.2FVitamin D .28CaD.29 intervention|Women’s Health Initiative Calcium/Vitamin D Supplementation Study]] (WHI CaD Study) found a modestly increased risk of cardiovascular events, particularly [[myocardial infarction]] in postmenopausal women. A broad recommendation of calcium/vitamin D supplements is therefore not warranted.<ref>M. J. Bolland, A. Grey, A. Avenell, G. D. Gamble, I. R. Reid. (2011).

===Cancer===
Overall, there is no strong evidence calcium supplementation helps prevent cancer in people: some studies suggest it might decrease the risk, but others suggest it might increase the risk.  The [[National Cancer Institute]], part of the [[National Institutes of Health]], does not recommend the use of calcium supplements to prevent any type of cancer, due to the lack of evidence supporting its use for this purpose.<ref>{{cite web |title=Calcium and Cancer Prevention: Strengths and Limits of the Evidence |publisher=National Cancer Institute |url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/prevention/calcium |accessdate=November 2014 |date=4 May 2009}}</ref>

There is weak evidence calcium supplementation might have a preventative effect against developing [[colorectal]] adenomatous [[polyp]]s, but the evidence is insufficient to recommend such supplementation as a beneficial practice.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Weingarten MA |author2=Zalmanovici A |author3=Yaphe J |title=Dietary calcium supplementation for preventing colorectal cancer and adenomatous polyps |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=1 |pages=CD003548 |date=2008 |pmid=18254022 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003548.pub4 |type=Review}}</ref>

==Hazards and toxicity==
Compared with other metals, the calcium ion and most calcium compounds have low toxicity. This is not surprising given the very high natural abundance of calcium compounds in the environment and in organisms. 

Calcium poses few serious environmental problems.  

High calcium intakes or high calcium absorption were previously thought to contribute to the development of kidney stones. However, a high calcium intake has been associated with a lower risk for kidney stones in more recent research.<ref name="curhan">{{Cite journal|pmid=8441427|date=1993|author=Curhan, GC|author2=Willett, WC|author3=Rimm, EB|author4=Stampfer, MJ|title=A prospective study of dietary calcium and other nutrients and the risk of symptomatic kidney stones |issue=12|pages=833–8|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|doi=10.1056/NEJM199303253281203 | url = http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJM199303253281203 | format = PDF|volume=328 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bihl G |author2=Meyers A. |title=Recurrent renal stone disease-advances in pathogenesis and clinical management |journal=Lancet |volume=358 |issue=9282 |pages=651–656 |date=2001 |pmid=11530173 |doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(01)05782-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hall WD |author2=Pettinger M |author3=Oberman A |title=Risk factors for kidney stones in older women in the Southern United States |journal=Am J Med Sci |volume=322 |issue=1 |pages=12–18 |date=2001 |pmid=11465241 |doi= 10.1097/00000441-200107000-00003}}</ref> 

Acute calcium poisoning is rare, and difficult to achieve unless calcium compounds are administered intravenously. For example, the oral [[median lethal dose]] (LD<sup>50</sup>) for rats for [[calcium carbonate]] and [[calcium chloride]] are 6.45<ref>{{Cite book |last= Lewis |first= R.

Calcium metal is hazardous because of its sometimes-violent reactions with water and acids. Calcium metal is found in some drain cleaners, where it functions to generate heat and [[calcium hydroxide]] that [[Saponification|saponifies]] the fats and liquefies the proteins (e.g., hair) that block drains. When swallowed calcium metal has the same effect on the mouth, esophagus and stomach, and can be fatal.<ref>Rumack BH. POISINDEX.

Excessive consumption of calcium carbonate antacids/dietary supplements (such as Tums) over a period of weeks or months can cause [[milk-alkali syndrome]], with symptoms ranging from [[hypercalcemia]] to potentially fatal [[renal failure]]. What constitutes “excessive” consumption is not well known and, it is presumed, varies a great deal from person to person. Persons consuming more than 10&nbsp;grams/day of CaCO<sub>3</sub> (=4 g Ca) are at risk of developing milk-alkali syndrome,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Beall DP |author2=Henslee HB |author3=Webb HR |author4=Scofield RH |title=Milk-alkali syndrome: a historical review and description of the modern version of the syndrome |journal=Am.
