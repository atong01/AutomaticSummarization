It was not until the 19th century that the idea was embraced and refined by scientists, as the blossoming science of chemistry produced discoveries that could easily be explained using the concept of atoms.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Dalton</heading><paragraph>Near the end of the 18th century, two laws about chemical reactions emerged without referring to the notion of an atomic theory.

For instance, in 1803 he believed that oxygen atoms were 5.5 times heavier than hydrogen atoms, because in water he measured 5.5&amp;nbsp;grams of oxygen for every 1&amp;nbsp;gram of hydrogen and believed the formula for water was HO. Adopting better data, in 1806 he concluded that the atomic weight of oxygen must actually be 7 rather than 5.5, and he retained this weight for the rest of his life.

This, coupled with the<space/><link><target>atomic mass</target></link><space/>of many elements being<space/><link><target>Prout's law</target><part>roughly equivalent</part></link><space/>to an integer number of hydrogen atoms - then assumed to be the lightest particles - led him to conclude that hydrogen nuclei were singular particles and a basic constituent of all atomic nuclei. He named such particles<space/><link><target>proton</target><trail>s</trail></link>. Further experimentation by Rutherford found that the nuclear mass of most atoms exceeded that of the protons it possessed; he speculated that this surplus mass was composed of hitherto unknown neutrally charged particles, which were tentatively dubbed &quot;<link><target>neutron</target><trail>s</trail></link>&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1928,<space/><link><target>Walter Bothe</target></link><space/>observed that<space/><link><target>beryllium</target></link><space/>emitted a highly penetrating, electrically neutral radiation when bombarded with alpha particles. It was later discovered that this radiation could knock hydrogen atoms out of<space/><link><target>paraffin wax</target></link>. Initially it was thought to be high-energy<space/><link><target>gamma radiation</target></link>, since gamma radiation had a similar effect on electrons in metals, but<space/><link><target>James Chadwick</target></link><space/>found that the<space/><link><target>ionization</target></link><space/>effect was too strong for it to be due to electromagnetic radiation, so long as energy and momentum were conserved in the interaction. In 1932, Chadwick exposed various elements, such as hydrogen and nitrogen, to the mysterious &quot;beryllium radiation&quot;, and by measuring the energies of the recoiling charged particles, he deduced that the radiation was actually composed of electrically neutral particles which could not be massless like the gamma ray, but instead were required to have a mass similar to that of a proton. Chadwick now claimed these particles as Rutherford's neutrons.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite journal</target><arg name="author">Chadwick, James</arg><arg name="year">1932</arg><arg name="url">http://web.mit.edu/22.54/resources/Chadwick.pdf<space/></arg><arg name="title">Possible Existence of a Neutron</arg><arg name="doi">10.1038/129312a0</arg><arg name="journal">Nature</arg><arg name="page">312</arg><arg name="volume">129</arg><arg name="bibcode"><space/>1932Natur.129Q.312C</arg><arg name="issue">3252</arg></template></extension><space/>For his discovery of the neutron, Chadwick received the Nobel Prize in 1935.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Quantum physical models of the atom</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Atomic orbital</arg></template><link><target>File:AOs-1s-2pz.png</target><part>right</part><part>thumb</part><part>The five filled atomic orbitals of a neon atom separated and arranged in order of increasing energy from left to right, with the last three orbitals being<space/><link><target>Degenerate energy level</target><part>equal in energy</part></link>.
