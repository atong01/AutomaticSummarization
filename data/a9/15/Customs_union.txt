A '''customs union''' is a type of [[trade bloc]] which is composed of a [[free trade area]] with a [[common external tariff]]. The participant countries set up common [[external trade]] policy, but in some cases they use different [[import quota]]s. Common [[competition policy]] is also helpful to avoid [[competition]] deficiency.<ref name="International Economics, Volume IV">{{cite book | url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=aYBoUpj4xTMC&pg=PA177&dq=Trade+creation+and+diversion&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3iZgUaS_JszrrQfwk4EI&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Trade%20creation%20and%20diversion&f=false | title=International Economics, Volume IV | publisher=Routledge | author=Winters, Alan L | year=1991 | pages=528 pages}}</ref>

Purposes for establishing a customs union normally include increasing [[economic efficiency]] and establishing closer political and cultural ties between the member countries.

It is the third stage of [[economic integration]].

Customs unions are established through [[trade pact]]s.
