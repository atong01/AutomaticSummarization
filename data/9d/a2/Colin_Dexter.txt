'''Norman Colin Dexter''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], (born 29 September 1930) is an English crime writer known for his [[Inspector Morse]] novels, which were written between 1975 and 1999 and adapted as a television series from 1987 to 2000.

==Early life and career==
Dexter was born in [[Stamford, Lincolnshire]], and was educated at [[Stamford School]], a boys' [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]]. After completing his [[national service]] with the [[Royal Corps of Signals]], he read Classics at [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], graduating in 1953 and receiving an honorary master's degree in 1958.

In 1954, he started his teaching career in the [[East Midlands]], becoming assistant Classics master at [[Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth I College|Wyggeston School]], [[Leicester]]. A post at [[Loughborough Grammar School]] followed before he took up the position of senior Classics teacher at [[Tresham College of Further and Higher Education|Corby Grammar School]], [[Northamptonshire]], in 1959.

In 1956 he married Dorothy Cooper, and they had a son and a daughter.

In 1966, he was forced by the onset of deafness to retire from teaching and took up the post of senior assistant secretary at the [[University of Oxford]] Delegacy of Local Examinations (UODLE) in [[Oxford]], a job he held until his retirement in 1988.<ref name="strandmag.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.strandmag.com/htm/colin_dexter.htm|title=Interview with Colin Dexter|work=strandmag.com|accessdate=21 May 2015}}</ref>

Dexter featured prominently in the BBC programme ''How to Solve a Cryptic Crossword'' as part of the ''Time Shift'' series broadcast in November 2008, in which he recounted some of the crossword clues solved by Morse.

==Writing career==
The first books he wrote were General Studies text books.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sandrafraser.wordpress.com/2010/03/25/character-interview-colin-dexter/|title=Character interview – Colin Dexter’s Guilty Secret - Sandra Fraser|work=Sandra Fraser|accessdate=21 May 2015}}</ref>

He started writing mysteries in 1972 during a family holiday. "We were in a little guest house halfway between [[Caernarfon]] and [[Pwllheli]]. It was a Saturday and it was raining&mdash;it's not unknown for it to rain in [[North Wales]]. The children were moaning... I was sitting at the kitchen table with nothing else to do, and I wrote the first few paragraphs of a potential detective novel."<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2245822/Handwritten-papers-introduced-Inspector-Morse-world-hammer.html "The birth of Inspector Morse: Handwritten manuscript of detective's first case goes under the hammer"] Daily Mail, 10 December 2012</ref> ''[[Last Bus to Woodstock]]'' was published in 1975 and introduced the character of [[Inspector Morse]], the irascible detective whose penchants for [[cryptic crossword]]s, [[English literature]], [[cask ale]] and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] reflect Dexter's own enthusiasms. Dexter's plots are notable for his use of false leads and other [[red herring]]s.<ref>[http://www.oxfordwine.co.uk/features/summer_07/dexter.html The Oxford Wine Company - Stars in their bars: Colin Dexter]</ref>

The success of the 33 episodes of the TV series ''[[Inspector Morse (TV series)|Inspector Morse]]'', produced between 1987 and 2001, brought further acclaim for Dexter. In the manner of [[Alfred Hitchcock]], he also makes a [[cameo appearance]] in almost all episodes.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0223294/bio. Retrieved 5 January 2006.</ref>  More recently, his character from the Morse series, the Sergeant (now Inspector) Lewis features in 27 episodes of the new ITV series ''[[Lewis (TV series)|Lewis]]''.

Dexter is currently a consultant on the TV series ''[[Endeavour (TV series)|Endeavour]]'', starring Shaun Evans and Roger Allam. This series is a prequel to ''Inspector Morse''. As with ''Morse'', Dexter occasionally makes cameo appearances in ''Lewis'' and ''Endeavour''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0223294/|title=Colin Dexter|work=IMDb|accessdate=21 May 2015}}</ref>

Dexter selected the English poet [[Alfred Edward Housman|A.E. Housman]] for the [[BBC Radio 4]] programme ''[[Great Lives]]'' in May 2008. Dexter and Housman were both Classicists who found a popular audience in another genre of writing.

==Awards and honours==
Dexter has received several [[Crime Writers' Association]] awards: two [[Silver Dagger (award)|Silver Dagger]]s for ''[[Service of All the Dead]]'' in 1979 and ''[[The Dead of Jericho]]'' in 1981; two [[Gold Dagger]]s for ''[[The Wench is Dead]]'' in 1989 and ''[[The Way Through the Woods]]'' in 1992; and a [[Cartier Diamond Dagger]] for lifetime achievement in 1997.<ref name="strandmag.com"/> In 1996 Dexter received a [[Macavity Awards|Macavity Award]] for his short story ''Evans Tries an O-Level''. In 1980, he was elected a member of the by-invitation-only [[Detection Club]].

In 2000 Dexter was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] for services to literature.  In 2001 he was awarded the Freedom of the City of Oxford.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2719850/People-think-Im-cleverer-I-Morse-plots-Inspector-Morse-author-Colin-Dexter-gives-definitive-answers-probing-questions.html|title='People always think I'm cleverer than I am because of the Morse plots' Inspector Morse author Colin Dexter gives his definitive answers to our most probing questions|work=Mail Online|accessdate=21 May 2015}}</ref>  In September 2011, the [[University of Lincoln]] awarded Dexter an honorary [[Doctor of Letters]] degree.
