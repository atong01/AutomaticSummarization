'''Benjamin D. Santer''' (born June 3, 1955 in [[Washington, DC]], [[United States]]) is a [[climate]] researcher at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] and former researcher at the [[University of East Anglia]]'s [[Climatic Research Unit]].<ref>[[Fred Pearce|Pearce, Fred]], ''The Climate Files:  The Battle for the Truth about Global Warming'', (2010) [[Guardian Books]], ISBN 978-0-85265-229-9, p. XI.</ref> He specializes mainly in [[statistical analysis]] of climate data sets, and detection/attribution of [[Global warming#External forcings|climate change forcings]].

==Honors==
Santer received a B.SC. in Environmental Sciences and a 1987 Ph.D. in Climatology from the Climatic Research Unit of the [[University of East Anglia]].<ref name=Marketplace/>

In 1998 Santer was awarded a [[MacArthur Fellowship]] for research supporting the finding that [[Human impact on the environment|human activity]] contributes to global warming. He has also received the [[Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award]] and a Distinguished Scientist Fellowship from the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] and the Norbert Gerbier/MUMM award from the [[World Meteorological Organization]].<ref name=Marketplace>{{cite web| url=http://marketplace.publicradio.org/features/moving-by-degrees/bios/santer.html |title=Dr. Ben Santer |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100626081737/http://marketplace.publicradio.org/features/moving-by-degrees/bios/santer.html| work=Moving By Degrees |publisher=American Public Media |archivedate=June 26, 2010}}</ref> He ranked twelfth amongst climate scientists in a 2002 assessment of most cited scientists in the field of global warming.<ref>[http://esi-topics.com/gwarm/authors/b1a.html Global Warming Top 25 Overall Ranked by total cites, 1991-August 2001], [[Thomson]]</ref>

== 1995 AR2 Chapter 8 ==
{{main|IPCC Second Assessment Report#Chapter_8}}

Santer was the convening Lead Author of Chapter 8 of 1995 [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] Working Group I Report (AR2 WGI), which addressed the [[global warming]] issue.<ref name=Marketplace/>

[[Frederick Seitz]], in a June 12, 1996 editorial-page piece in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' complained that alterations made to Chapter 8 of the 1995 IPCC report were made to "deceive policy makers and the public into believing that the scientific evidence shows human activities are causing global warming." Similar charges were made by the [[Global Climate Coalition]] (GCC), a consortium of industry interests; specifically, they accused Santer of "scientific cleansing."<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Gupta | first1 = S. | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1218254109 | title = QnAs with Benjamin D. Santer | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 110 | pages = 3â€“01 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref>

Santer and 40 other scientists responded to the ''Wall Street Journal'' that all IPCC procedural rules were followed, and that IPCC procedures required changes to the draft in response to comments from governments, individual scientists, and non-governmental organizations. They stated that the pre- and post-Madrid versions of Chapter 8 were equally cautious in their statements; that roughly 20% of Chapter 8 is devoted to the discussion of uncertainties in estimates of natural climate variability and the expected signal due to human activities; and that both versions of the chapter reached the same conclusion: "Taken together, these results point towards a human influence on climate."<ref>[http://www.ucar.edu/communications/quarterly/summer96/insert.html Special insert--An open letter to Ben Santer].
