The '''demographics of Estonia''' in the twenty-first century result from historical trends over more than a thousand years, as with most European countries, but have been disproportionately influenced by events in the last half of the twentieth century. The rise and fall of the [[Soviet Union]], including the [[Occupation of the Baltic states|annexation]] and eventual independence of [[Estonia]], has had a major effect on Estonia's ethnic makeup and educational achievement.

Languages spoken in Estonia largely reflect the [[ethnic group]]s composing the country, and thus have changed with historical trends affecting the ethnic makeup of the country. Religion plays a small part in the lives of most Estonians, largely{{cn|date=September 2015}} as a result of the [[Occupation of Baltic States|Soviet occupation from 1944–1991]].

Overall, the quality-of-life indices for Estonia indicate a modern industrial state, with one major exception: the population of Estonia is shrinking.  While other European countries, like Estonia, have a [[birthrate]] at less than replacement levels, Estonia lacks the [[immigration]] found, for example, in [[Germany]]. As such, the population is on a slow downward trend, except for a brief pause in 2010.<ref name="Population by sex and age group, 1 January"/>

== Historical ties ==
{{See also|History of Estonia}}
[[Estonians]] have strong ties to the [[Nordic countries]] and [[Germany]] stemming from the strong cultural and religious influences gained over centuries during [[Denmark|Danish]], German and [[Sweden|Swedish]] rule and settlement. This highly literate society places strong emphasis upon education, which is free and compulsory until age 16.

In the twentieth century, [[Russianization|Estonia's ethnic makeup was altered radically]] by policies implemented by the [[USSR|Soviet]] government. Large numbers of ethnic Russians were incentivized to move into the non-Russian republics, including Estonia. The population was further altered by [[Joseph Stalin]]'s mass deportations and executions while many people simply left as a result of [[World War II]].

According to data from [[Statistics Estonia]], the population of Estonia is shrinking. While there are other European countries like Estonia with a birthrate that is below replacement levels, Estonia lacks immigration to compensate for the negative natural growth. In fact, the number of emigrants is larger than the number of immigrants. As such, the population is on a slow downward trend. The population increased from 1,351,640 in January 1970 to 1,570,599 in January 1990. Since 1990, Estonia lost about 15% of its population (230,000 people). The population decreased to 1,294,455 in December 2011, which is even lower than the number of people that lived in Estonia in 1970.
* 1,294,455 ([[2011 Estonia Census|2011 Population Count and Housing Census]]) <ref>{{cite web|title=1,294,455 permanent residents enumerated in the census|url=http://www.stat.ee/67162?parent_id=39113|work=12 December 2012|publisher=Statistics Estonia|accessdate=16 January 2013}}</ref> 
* 1,370,052 (2000 Population Count and Housing Census) <ref>{{cite web|title=General information|url=http://www.stat.ee/26262|work=Update 10 January 2008|publisher=Statistics Estonia|accessdate=16 January 2013}}</ref>

Although there is a downward population curve, explained by a larger death than birth rate and a larger number of emigrants than immigrants, the line graph of the natural population increase shows the rate of population decrease was slowly diminishing.

=== Age structure ===
[[File:Age structure of Estonia (1970-2010).png|thumb|320px|Age structure of Estonia from 1970–2010. Data is taken from [[Statistics Estonia]].<ref name="Population by sex and age group, 1 January"/>

Between 1970 and 1990 the age structure of Estonia was rather stable with around 22% of the population in the age group 0–14 years, 66% between 15 and 65, while 12% were 65 years or older.<ref name="Population by sex and age group, 1 January"/> Due to the low birth rates after 1990, the proportion of the population 0–14 years of age dropped to 15% in 2009, while the proportion of 65 years or older gradually increased to 17% in 2009. The proportion of the age group 15–64 also slightly increased to 68% in 2009.

=== Births and deaths ===
From 1947–1989 the number of births was higher than the number of deaths, but from 1990 onwards the number of deaths outnumbered the number of births. The crude birth rate of 2011 was 10.96 (14,679 births) and the crude death rate of 2011 was 11.38 (15,244 deaths), making the rate of natural increase −0.42 (−565).<ref name="Births, deaths and natural increase"/> For more detailed historic data, see the [[Demographics of Estonia#Table of birth and death rates|table of birth and death rates]] below.

=== Total fertility rate ===
Between 1970 and 1990, the total fertility rate (TFR) was little over 2 children born per woman.<ref name="Main demographic indicators">{{cite web|url=http://pub.stat.ee/px-web.2001/I_Databas/Population/01Population_indicators_and_composition/02Main_demographic_indicators/02Main_demographic_indicators.asp|title=Main demographic indicators|publisher=Statistics Estonia|accessdate=3 January 2013}}</ref> A fast decrease of the TFR occurred after independence. In 1998 the lowest rate was recorded: 1.28 children born per [[Women in Estonia|women]]. The TFR slightly recovered in the subsequent years. The TFR was 1.66 in 2008 and 1.52 in 2011.

=== Infant mortality rate ===
The infant mortality rate in Estonia has decreased considerably during the past decades. In 1970 the rate was 17.7 per 1,000 live births.<ref name="Main demographic indicators"/> The rate decreased to 17.1 in 1980, 12.3 in 1990 and 8.4 in 2000. The lowest infant mortality rate was recorded in 2011: 2.6.

=== Life expectancy at birth ===
Life expectancy in Estonia is lower than in most Western European countries. During the Soviet era life expectancy in males was between 64 and 66 years and in females between 73 and 75 years.<ref name="Main demographic indicators"/> After the independence, life expectancy decreased for a number of years. In 1994, the lowest life expectancy was recorded: 60.5 years in males and 72.8 in females. After 1994, life expectancy gradually increased to reach 68.3 years in males and 79.2 in females in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/estonia/life_expectancy_at_birth.html|accessdate=3 January 2013|title=Estonia Life expectancy at birth|publisher= Index Mundi}}</ref>

=== Migration ===
As the cumulative negative natural growth was about 82,000 during 1991-2010, the remainder of the population decline of Estonia since 1990 (230,000 people in total) was caused by emigration (150,000 people or about 10% of the population of Estonia in 1990). Mainly ethnic [[Russians]], [[Ukrainians]] and [[Belarusians]] emigrated. Consequently, the proportion of these ethnic groups decreased as can be seen in the results of the 2000 census (see below). Data from 2000–2009 also shows that the number of emigrants is larger than the number of immigrants, but on a much lower lever than in the 1990s.<ref name="Migration"/>

After gaining independence following World War I a population census was held in 1922 and 1934. At that time Estonians were still the predominant ethnic group, while all others constituted 12% of the population of Estonia.

Major Jewish communities were present in Estonia between 1918 and 1940 in [[Tallinn]], [[Pärnu]], [[Kilingi-Nõmme]], [[Narva]], [[Tartu]], [[Valga, Estonia|Valga]], and [[Võru]].<ref>

As a result of the aforementioned Soviet policies, the share of ethnic Estonians in the population resident within currently defined boundaries of [[Estonia]] dropped to 61.5% in 1989, compared to 88% in 1934.<ref name="Population of Estonia by population censuses">

In the same period the proportion of ethnic Russians decreased from 30.0% to 25.6%, the proportion of ethnic [[Ukrainians]] decreased from 3.1% to 2.1%, and the proportion of ethnic [[Belarusians]] decreased from 1.8% to 1.2%.<ref name="Population by sex, ethnic nationality and county, 1 January"/><ref name="Population of Estonia by population censuses"/>

== Languages ==
Many languages are spoken in Estonia, including [[Estonian language|Estonian]] (official), [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[English language|English]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[German language|German]] and others. According to the census of 2000, 109 languages were spoken natively in Estonia. By 2011, the number of languages spoken natively had increased to 157, mainly due to new immigrants. However, most of these languages were used only between relatives or compatriots, while only 30 languages were spoken on a daily basis in families.<ref>Mart Rannut. [http://www.sirp.ee/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=17017:keeleaasta-2012&catid=18:varamu&Itemid=15&issue=3426 "Keeleaasta 2012."] ''[[Sirp]]'', 1-25-2013. {{et icon}}</ref>

Estonian and Finnish are closely related, belonging to the same [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] branch of the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] language family. Nevertheless, the two languages are not [[mutually intelligible]], although educated native speakers can read the other language with a greater or lesser degree of understanding. Estonian and Finnish are only distantly related to the [[Hungarian language]].

Written with the [[Latin alphabet]], Estonian is the language of the Estonian people and the official language of the country. One-third of the standard vocabulary is derived from adding suffixes to root words. The oldest known examples of written Estonian originate in 13th century chronicles. During the [[Estonian SSR|Soviet era]], the [[Russian language]] was imposed in parallel to, and often instead of, Estonian in official use.

According to the most recent [[Eurobarometer]] Poll 2010,<ref name="Special Eurobarometer 393 ">''[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_341_en.pdf Biotechnology report 2010]'' p.383</ref> 18% of Estonian citizens responded that "they believe there is a God", whereas 50% answered that "they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force" and 29% that "they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, god, or life force". This, according to the survey, would have made [[Estonians]] the [[Irreligion|most non-religious people]] in the then 25-member [[European Union]]. A survey conducted in 2006–2008 by [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] showed that 14% of Estonians answered positively to the question: "Is religion an important part of your daily life?", which was the lowest among 143 countries polled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/114211/Alabamians-Iranians-Common.aspx|title=What Alabamians and Iranians Have in Common|date=February 9, 2009|publisher=[[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]]|first1=Steve|last1=Crabtree|first2=Brett|last2=Pelham|accessdate=21 February 2010}}</ref>

Less than a third of the population define themselves as believers; of those, the majority are Lutheran, whereas the Russian minority is Eastern Orthodox. Ancient [[equinox|equinoctial]] traditions (like [[St John's Day (Estonia)|St John's Day]]) are held in high regard. In 2000, according to the census, 29.2% of the population considered themselves to be related to any religion, thereof:<ref name="stat.ee-religion">{{cite web | url=http://pub.stat.ee/px-web.2001/I_Databas/Population_census/16Religious_affiliation/16Religious_affiliation.asp | title=Statistical database: Population Census 2000&nbsp;– Religious affiliation | accessdate=2011-02-18 | date=22 October 2002 | publisher=[[Statistics Estonia]]}}</ref>
