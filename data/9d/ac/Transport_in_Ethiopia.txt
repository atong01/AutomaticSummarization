'''Transport in Ethiopia''' is overseen by the [[Ministry of Transport and Communications (Ethiopia)|Ministry of Transport and Communications]]. Over the last seven years, the Ethiopian federal authorities have significantly increased funding for road construction. Road projects now represent around a quarter of the annual infrastructure budget. Additionally, through the Road Sector Development Program (RSDP), the government has earmarked $4 billion to construct, repair and upgrade roads over the next decade.<ref name="Goei">{{cite web|title=Infrastructure|url=http://www.ethiopia.gov.et/infrastructure|publisher=Government of Ethiopia|accessdate=13 March 2014}}</ref>

* At present the railway is under joint control of Djibouti and Ethiopia, but negotiations are underway to [[privatize]] this transport utility.

* 2 November 2006 - Ineco Spt of Spain was named the preferred choice for supervision and administration of rehabilitation work on the 781&nbsp;km Ethio-Djibouti Railway for €2.2 million. [[Consta]] - an Italian company - will undertake the actual reconstruction at a cost of €40 million (about R360m). [[Comazar]] of South Africa has been awarded the 25-year concession. Rails are to be upgraded from 20&nbsp;kg/m to 40&nbsp;kg/m, to carry substantially increased loads. A fleet of new locomotives and freight wagons will be brought in by the concessionaire.<ref>RailwaysAfrica</ref>

As the first part of a 10-year Road Sector Development Program, between 1997 and 2002 the Ethiopian government began a sustained effort to improve its infrastructure of roads. As a result, as of 2002 Ethiopia has a total (Federal and Regional) 33,297&nbsp;km of roads, both paved and gravel. The share of Federally managed roads in good quality improved from 14% in 1995 to 31% in 2002 as a result of this program, and to 89% in 2009<ref name="Ethiopia earmarks" /> the road density increased from 21&nbsp;km per 1000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (in 1995) to 889&nbsp;km; per 1000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (in 2009) however, this is much greater than the average of 50&nbsp;km per 1000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> for Africa.<ref>"[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/main?pagePK=64193027&piPK=64187937&theSitePK=523679&menuPK=64187510&searchMenuPK=64187283&theSitePK=523679&entityID=000112742_20030530104124&searchMenuPK=64187283&theSitePK=523679 Ethiopia - Second Road Sector Development Program Project]", p.3 ([[World Bank]] Project Appraisal Document, 19 May 2003)</ref>

The Ethiopian government has begun second part of the Road Sector Development Program, which was completed in 2007. This will involve the upgrading or construction of over 7,500&nbsp;km of roads, with the goal of improving the average road density for Ethiopia to 35&nbsp;km per 1000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, and reduce the proportion of the country area that is more than 5&nbsp;km from an all-weather road from 75% to 70%.<ref>World Bank, "Second Road Sector", p.11</ref>

The [[Ethiopian Roads Authority]] and [[China Communications Construction Consultancy]] are presently building a new six-lane expressway between Addis Ababa and Adama (Nazaret). The expressway will be 80&nbsp;km long, will shorten the Addis to Adama distance by 20&nbsp;km. To build this expressway will cost Ethiopia US$350 million. The expressway will begin at Ayat, Addis Ababa and end in north part of Adama. 150&nbsp;km/h is the limited speed at the expressway, the journey will take about 30–40 minutes. The expressway will be completed in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.addisfortune.com/Ministry%20to%20Sign%20for%20350m%20dollar%20Loan%20from%20Bank%20of%20China%20for%20New%20Road.htm |title=Ministry to Sign for 350m dollar Loan from Bank of China for New Road |publisher=Addis Fortune |date=27 June 2009 |first=Wudineh |last=Zenebe |accessdate=27 July 2011}}</ref><ref name="Rtaanee">{{cite web|title=Addis Adaba Adama (Nazareth) Expressway, Ethiopia|url=http://www.roadtraffic-technology.com/projects/addis-adaba-adama-nazareth-expressway/|publisher=Roadtraffic-technology|accessdate=13 March 2014}}</ref>

According to the [[Government of Ethiopia]], it has spent over 600 billion [[Ethiopian birr|birr]] (USD $50 billion, €30 billion) on infrastructure since 1990.

In 2003, about 1.147 million passengers were carried on domestic and international flights.
