The term was subsequently adopted by the<space/><link><target>Gnosticism</target><part>Gnostics</part></link>. Although a fashioner, the demiurge is not necessarily the same as the creator figure in the familiar<space/><link><target>monotheism</target><part>monotheistic</part></link><space/>sense, because both the demiurge itself plus the material from which the demiurge fashions the universe are considered either uncreated and eternal, or the product of some other being, depending on the system.</paragraph><paragraph>The word &quot;demiurge&quot; is an English word from a<space/><link><target>List of Latinised names</target><part>Latinized</part></link><space/>form of the<space/><link><target>Greek language</target><part>Greek</part></link><space/><template><target>lang</target><arg>grc</arg><arg>δημιουργός</arg></template>,<space/><italics>dmiourgos</italics>, literally &quot;public worker&quot;, and which was originally a common noun meaning &quot;craftsman&quot; or &quot;artisan&quot;, but gradually it came to mean &quot;producer&quot; and eventually &quot;creator&quot;.

This is accordingly the definition of the demiurge in the Platonic (c.&amp;nbsp;31090 BC) and Middle Platonic (c.&amp;nbsp;90 BC 300 AD) philosophical traditions. In the various branches of the Neoplatonic school (third century onwards), the demiurge is the fashioner of the real, perceptible world after the model of the<space/><link><target>Theory of Forms</target><part>Ideas</part></link>, but (in most Neoplatonic systems) is still not itself &quot;<link><target>Form of the Good</target><part>the One</part></link>&quot;.

This is a pity because this name would suit the demiurge risen from chaos to a nicety. And perhaps the author of the ''[[On the Origin of the World|Untitled Document]]'' did not know Aramaic and also supposed as we did once, that ''baoth'' had something to do with ''[[Tohu wa-bohu|tohuwabohu]]'', one of the few Hebrew words that everybody knows. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

The Mother, Sophia-Achamoth, produced as a result of the complicated sequence of events which followed the fall of the higher Sophia, and her offspring the Demiurge, the inferier and ignorant maker of the material universe, are Valentinian figures; cp. Irenaeus, ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus haereses]]'' 1.4 and 5. Valentinius had been in Rome, and there is nothing improbable in the presence of Valentinians there in the time of Plotinus. But the evidence in the ''Life'' ch. 16 suggests that the Gnostics in Plotinus's circle belonged rather to the older group called Sethians or [[Archontics]], related to the [[Ophites]] or [[Barbelo]]gnostics: they probably called themselves simply 'Gnostics.'

There were Gnostics among Plotinus's own friends, whom he had not succeeded in converting (Enneads ch. 10 of this treatise) and he and his pupils devoted considerable time and energy to anti-Gnostic controversy (Life of Plotinus ch. 16). He obviously considered Gnosticism an extremely dangerous influence, likely to pervert the minds even of members of his own circle. It is impossible to attempt to give an account of Gnosticism here. By far the best discussion of what the particular group of Gnostics Plotinus knew believed is M. Puech's admirable contribution to Entretiens Hardt V (Les Sources de Plotin).
