The older son,<space/><link><target>Gesalec</target></link>, was chosen king but his reign was disastrous. King Theoderic of the Ostrogoths sent an army, led by his sword-bearer<space/><link><target>Theudis</target></link>, against Gesalec, ostensibly on behalf of Amalaric; Gesalec fled to Africa. The Ostrogoths then drove back the Franks and their<space/><link><target>Burgundians</target><part>Burgundian</part></link><space/>allies, regaining possession of &quot;the south of<space/><link><target>Novempopulana</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Rodez</target></link>, probably even<space/><link><target>Albi</target></link>, and even Toulose&quot;. Following the 511 death of Clovis, Theoderic negotiated a peace with Clovis' successors, securing Visigothic control of the southernmost portion of Gaul for the rest of the existence of their kingdom.<extension extension_name='ref'>Wolfram,<space/><italics>History of the Goths</italics>, p. 245</extension></paragraph><paragraph>In 522 the young Amalaric was proclaimed king, and four years later, on Theoderic's death, he assumed full royal power.
