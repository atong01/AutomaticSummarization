==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:What Alcohol Does to Your Body.webm|thumb|Effects of alcohol on the body]]

===Early signs===
The risk of alcohol dependence begins at low levels of drinking and increases directly with both the volume of alcohol consumed and a pattern of drinking larger amounts on an occasion. Young adults are particularly at risk.

===Long-term misuse===
[[File:Possible long-term effects of ethanol.svg|thumb|400px|Some of the possible [[long-term effects of ethanol]] an individual may develop. Additionally, in pregnant women, alcohol can cause [[fetal alcohol syndrome]].]]
Alcoholism is characterised by an increased [[Alcohol tolerance|tolerance]] to and [[physical dependence]] on alcohol, affecting an individual's ability to control consumption. These characteristics play a role decreasing an alcoholic's ability to stop drinking.<ref name="Hoffman-1996">{{cite journal | author = Hoffman PL, Tabakoff B | title = Alcohol dependence: a commentary on mechanisms | journal = Alcohol Alcohol | volume = 31 | issue = 4 | pages = 333–40 | date = July 1996 | pmid = 8879279 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.alcalc.a008159 }}</ref> Alcoholism can have adverse effects on mental health, causing psychiatric disorders and increasing the risk of suicide.

====Physical====
Long-term alcohol abuse can cause a number of physical symptoms, including [[cirrhosis]] of the liver, [[pancreatitis]], [[epilepsy]], [[polyneuropathy]], [[Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome|alcoholic dementia]], heart disease, nutritional deficiencies, [[Duodenal ulcer|peptic ulcers]]<ref>{{cite book |last=American Medical Association |title=Complete Medical Encyclopedia |year=2003|publisher=Random House Reference |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-8129-9100-1|edition=First |authorlink=Duodenal Ulcer |editor=Leiken, Jerrold B. MD, Lipsky, Martin S. MD |page=485 |type=Encyclopedia}}</ref> and [[sexual dysfunction]], and can eventually be fatal. Other physical effects include an increased risk of developing [[cardiovascular disease]], [[malabsorption]], [[alcoholic liver disease]], and [[cancer]]. Damage to the [[central nervous system]] and [[peripheral nervous system]] can occur from sustained alcohol consumption.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Müller D, Koch RD, von Specht H, Völker W, Münch EM | title = [Neurophysiologic findings in chronic alcohol abuse] | language = German | journal = Psychiatr Neurol Med Psychol (Leipz) | volume = 37 | issue = 3 | pages = 129–32 | date = March 1985 | pmid = 2988001 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Testino G | title = Alcoholic diseases in hepato-gastroenterology: a point of view | journal = Hepatogastroenterology | volume = 55 | issue = 82–83 | pages = 371–7 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18613369 }}</ref> A wide range of immunologic defects can result and there may be a generalized skeletal fragility, in addition to a recognized tendency to accidental injury, resulting a propensity to bone fractures.<ref>[http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/10report/intro.pdf 10th Special Report to the U.S. Congress on Alcohol and Health], 2000, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.</ref>

Women develop long-term complications of alcohol dependence more rapidly than do men. Additionally, women have a higher mortality rate from alcoholism than men.<ref name="Blume Laura N., Nielson Nancy H., Riggs Joseph A., et all 1998 861–870"/> Examples of long-term complications include brain, heart, and liver damage<ref name="Walter H., Gutierrez K., Ramskogler K., Hertling I., Dvorak A., Lesch O.M., et al. 2003 253–268" /> and an [[alcohol and breast cancer|increased risk of breast cancer]]. Additionally, heavy drinking over time has been found to have a negative effect on reproductive functioning in women. This results in reproductive dysfunction such as [[anovulation]], decreased ovarian mass, problems or irregularity of the [[menstrual cycle]], and early [[menopause]].<ref name="Blume Laura N., Nielson Nancy H., Riggs Joseph A., et all 1998 861–870" /> Alcoholic [[ketoacidosis]] can occur in individuals who chronically abuse alcohol and have a recent history of [[binge drinking]].<ref name="Mihai-">{{cite journal | author = Mihai B, Lăcătuşu C, Graur M | title = [Alcoholic ketoacidosis] | journal = Rev Med Chir Soc Med Nat Iasi | volume = 112 | issue = 2 | pages = 321–6 | date = April–June 2008 | pmid = 19294998 }}</ref><ref name="Sibaï-2005">{{cite journal | author = Sibaï K, Eggimann P | title = [Alcoholic ketoacidosis: not rare cause of metabolic acidosis] | journal = Rev Med Suisse | volume = 1 | issue = 32 | pages = 2106, 2108–10, 2112–5 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16238232 }}</ref>

The amount of alcohol that can be biologically processed and its effects differ between sexes. Equal dosages of alcohol consumed by men and women generally result in women having higher [[blood alcohol concentration]]s (BACs), since women generally have a higher percentage of body fat and therefore a lower volume of distribution for alcohol than men, and because the stomachs of men tend to metabolize alcohol more quickly.<ref name="pmid23101976">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cederbaum AI | title = Alcohol metabolism | journal = Clin Liver Dis | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 667–85 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23101976 | pmc = 3484320 | doi = 10.1016/j.cld.2012.08.002 | url = }}</ref>

====Psychiatric====
Long-term misuse of alcohol can cause a wide range of mental health problems. Severe [[cognitive]] problems are common; approximately 10 percent of all dementia cases are related to alcohol consumption, making it the second leading cause of dementia.<ref name="aamaibnc">{{Cite web |url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-07/econ-ma070808.php |title=Alcoholism-associated molecular adaptations in brain neurocognitive circuits |author=Professor Georgy Bakalkin |date=8 July 2008|publisher=eurekalert.org|accessdate=11 January 2012}}</ref> Excessive alcohol use causes damage to brain function, and psychological health can be increasingly affected over time.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Oscar-Berman M, Marinkovic K | title = Alcoholism and the brain: an overview | journal = Alcohol Res Health | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 125–33 | year = 2003 | pmid = 15303622 }}</ref>

[[Social skills]] are significantly impaired in people suffering from alcoholism due to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain, especially the [[prefrontal cortex]] area of the brain. The social skills that are impaired by [[alcohol abuse]] include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] perception problems and [[theory of mind]] deficits; the ability to understand humour is also impaired in alcohol abusers.<ref name="pmid18412750">{{cite journal | author = Uekermann J, Daum I | title = Social cognition in alcoholism: a link to prefrontal cortex dysfunction? | journal = Addiction | volume = 103 | issue = 5 | pages = 726–35 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18412750 | doi = 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2008.02157.x | url =  }}</ref>

Psychiatric disorders are common in alcoholics, with as many as 25 percent suffering severe psychiatric disturbances. The most prevalent psychiatric symptoms are [[anxiety]] and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] disorders.

Psychiatric disorders differ depending on gender. Women who have alcohol-use disorders often have a co-occurring psychiatric diagnosis such as major depression, anxiety, panic disorder, [[bulimia]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), or [[borderline personality disorder]]. Men with alcohol-use disorders more often have a co-occurring diagnosis of [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]] or [[antisocial personality disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]], schizophrenia, impulse disorders or [[attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder]].<ref name="Karrol Brad R. 2002 337–356">{{Cite journal|author=Karrol Brad R. |title=Women and alcohol use disorders: a review of important knowledge and its implications for social work practitioners |journal=Journal of social work |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=337–356 |year=2002 |doi=10.1177/146801730200200305 }}</ref> Women with alcoholism are more likely to have a history of physical or sexual assault, abuse and domestic violence than those in the general population,<ref name="Karrol Brad R. 2002 337–356" /> which can lead to higher instances of psychiatric disorders and greater dependence on alcohol.

Also, a younger age of onset of drinking is associated with an increased risk of the development of alcoholism,<ref name="eattrfad"/> and about 40 percent of alcoholics will drink excessively by their late adolescence.

===Gender difference===
Based on combined data from SAMHSA's 2004–2005 National Surveys on Drug Use & Health, the rate of past year alcohol dependence or abuse among persons aged 12 or older varied by level of alcohol use: 44.7% of past month heavy drinkers, 18.5% binge drinkers, 3.8% past month non-binge drinkers, and 1.3% of those who did not drink alcohol in the past month met the criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year. Males had higher rates than females for all measures of drinking in the past month: any alcohol use (57.5% vs. 45%), binge drinking (30.8% vs. 15.1%), and heavy alcohol use (10.5% vs. 3.3%), and males were twice as likely as females to have met the criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year (10.5% vs. 5.1%).<ref>"Gender differences in alcohol use and alcohol dependence or abuse: 2004 or 2005."

===Genetic variation===

Genetic differences exist between different racial groups which affect the risk of developing alcohol dependence.

The [[National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism]] (NIAAA) defines [[binge drinking]] as the amount of alcohol leading to a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.08, which, for most adults, would be reached by consuming five drinks for men or four for women over a 2-hour period.  According to the NIAAA, men may be at risk for alcohol-related problems if their alcohol consumption exceeds 14 [[standard drink]]s per week or 4 drinks per day, and women may be at risk if they have more than 7 standard drinks per week or 3 drinks per day. It defines a standard drink as one 12-ounce bottle of beer, one 5-ounce glass of wine, or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits.<ref>http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa68/aa68.htm</ref>  Despite this risk, a 2014 report in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that only 10% of either "heavy drinkers" or "binge drinkers" defined according to the above critera also met the criteria for alcohol dependence, while only 1.3% of non-binge drinkers met this criteria.  An inference drawn from this study is that evidence-based policy strategies and clinical preventive services may effectively reduce binge drinking without requiring addiction treatment in most cases.<ref name="Esser2014">{{cite journal|last1=Esser|first1=Marissa B.|last2=Hedden|first2=Sarra L.|last3=Kanny|first3=Dafna|last4=Brewer|first4=Robert D.|last5=Gfroerer|first5=Joseph C.|last6=Naimi|first6=Timothy S.|title=Prevalence of Alcohol Dependence Among US Adult Drinkers, 2009–2011|journal=Preventing Chronic Disease|date=20 November 2014|volume=11|doi=10.5888/pcd11.140329}}</ref>

The term "alcoholism" is commonly used, but poorly defined. The WHO calls alcoholism "a term of long-standing use and variable meaning", and use of the term was disfavored by a 1979 WHO Expert Committee. ''[[The Big Book (Alcoholics Anonymous)|The Big Book]]'' (from [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]) states that once a person is an alcoholic, they are always an alcoholic, but does not define what is meant by the term "alcoholic" in this context. In 1960, [[Bill W.]], co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), said:

:We have never called alcoholism a [[disease]] because, technically speaking, it is not a disease entity. For example, there is no such thing as [[heart disease]]. Instead there are many separate heart ailments, or combinations of them. It is something like that with alcoholism. Therefore we did not wish to get in wrong with the medical profession by pronouncing alcoholism a disease entity. Therefore we always called it an [[illness]], or a [[malady]]—a far safer term for us to use.<ref name="McGovernWhite2003">{{Cite book|author1=Thomas F. McGovern|author2=William L. White|title=Alcohol Problems in the United States: Twenty Years of Treatment Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3gRwmYohuooC&pg=PA7|accessdate=17 April 2010|date=20 May 2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-7890-2049-9|pages=7–}}</ref>

In professional and research contexts, the term "alcoholism" sometimes encompasses both alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence,<ref>{{DorlandsDict|one/000002709|alcoholism}}</ref> and sometimes is considered equivalent to alcohol dependence. Talbot (1989) observes that alcoholism in the classical disease model follows a progressive course: if a person continues to drink, their condition will worsen. This will lead to harmful consequences in their life, physically, mentally, emotionally and socially.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thombs|first=Dennis L|title=Introductive To Addictive Behaviors 2ed|year=1999|publisher=The Guildford Press|location=London|pages=64}}</ref>

Johnson (1980) explores the emotional progression of the addict’s response to alcohol. He looks at this in four phases. The first two are considered “normal” drinking and the last two are viewed as "typical" alcoholic drinking.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thombs|first=Dennis L|title=Introduction to Addictive Behaviours 2ed|year=1999|publisher=The Guildford Press|location=London|pages=64}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Thombs|first=Dennis|title=Introduction to Addictive Behaviors|year=1999|publisher=The Guildford Press|location=London|pages=64}}</ref> Johnson's four phases consist of:

# Learning the mood swing. A person is introduced to alcohol (in some cultures this can happen at a relatively young age), and the person enjoys the happy feeling it produces.  At this stage there is no emotional cost.
# Seeking the mood swing. A person will drink to regain that feeling of euphoria experienced in phase 1; the drinking will increase as more intoxication is required to achieve the same effect. Again at this stage, there are no significant consequences.
# At the third stage there are physical and social consequences, i.e., hangovers, family problems, work problems, etc. A person will continue to drink excessively, disregarding the problems.
# The fourth stage can be detrimental, as Johnson cites it as a risk for premature death. As a person now drinks to feel normal, they block out the feelings of overwhelming guilt, remorse, anxiety, and shame they experience when sober.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thombs|first=Dennis L|title=Introduction to Addictive Behaviors 2ed|year=1999|publisher=The Guildford Press|location=London|pages=65}}</ref>

Other theorists such as Milam & Ketcham (1983) focus on the physical deterioration of alcohol. They describe the process in three stages:

# Adaptive stage – The person will not experience any negative symptoms, and believe they have capacity for alcohol. Physiological changes are happening with the increase in tolerance, but this will not be noticeable to the drinker or others.
# Dependent stage – At this stage, symptoms build gradually. Hangover symptoms may be confused with withdrawal symptoms. Many addicts will maintain their drinking to avoid withdrawal sickness, drinking small amounts frequently. They will try to hide their problem from others, and will avoid gross intoxication.
# Deterioration stage – Various organs are damaged due to long-term drinking. Medical treatment will be required; otherwise the pathological changes will cause death.

In psychology and psychiatry, the DSM is the most common global standard, while in medicine, the standard is ICD. The terms they recommend are similar but not identical.

The World Health Organisation uses the term "alcohol dependence syndrome" rather than alcoholism.<ref name="ladtpwho"/> The concept of "harmful use" (as opposed to "abuse") was introduced in 1992's ICD-10 to minimize underreporting of damage in the absence of dependence.<ref name="urlDiagnostic Criteria for Alcohol Abuse and Dependence - Alcohol Alert No. 30-1995"/> The term "alcoholism" was removed from ICD between ICD-8/ICDA-8 and [[ICD-9]].<ref name="urlA System to Convert ICD Diagnostic Codes for Alcohol Research">{{Cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000324.htm |title=A System to Convert ICD Diagnostic Codes for Alcohol Research |work=|accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref>

The [[DSM-IV]] diagnosis of alcohol dependence represents one approach to the definition of alcoholism. In part this is to assist in the development of research protocols in which findings can be compared to one another. According to the DSM-IV, an alcohol dependence diagnosis is: "maladaptive alcohol use with clinically significant impairment as manifested by at least three of the following within any one-year period: tolerance; withdrawal; taken in greater amounts or over longer time course than intended; desire or unsuccessful attempts to cut down or control use; great deal of time spent obtaining, using, or recovering from use; social, occupational, or recreational activities given up or reduced; continued use despite knowledge of physical or psychological [[sequela]]e."<ref name="DSMIV">{{Cite book| title = Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV | url = https://books.google.com/?id=W-BGAAAAMAAJ | date = 31 July 1994 | publisher = American Psychiatric Association | location = Washington, DC | isbn = 978-0-89042-025-6 | pages = }}</ref>

Despite the imprecision inherent in the term, there have been attempts to define how the word "alcoholism" should be interpreted when encountered. In 1992, it was defined by the [[National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence|NCADD]] and [[American Society of Addiction Medicine|ASAM]] as "a primary, chronic disease characterized by impaired control over drinking, preoccupation with the drug alcohol, use of alcohol despite adverse consequences, and distortions in thinking."<ref>{{cite journal | author = Morse RM, Flavin DK | title = The definition of alcoholism.

A 1960 study by [[E. Morton Jellinek]] is considered the foundation of the modern [[disease theory of alcoholism]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=OCTOBER 22 DEATHS|url=http://www.todayinsci.com/10/10_22.htm|publisher=todayinsci.com|accessdate=18 February 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080207170157/http://www.todayinsci.com/10/10_22.htm| archivedate= 7 February 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref> Jellinek's definition restricted the use of the word "alcoholism" to those showing a particular [[natural history of disease|natural history]].

===Social barriers===
Attitudes and social stereotypes can create barriers to the detection and treatment of alcohol abuse. This is more of a barrier for women than men. Fear of stigmatization may lead women to deny that they are suffering from a medical condition, to hide their drinking, and to drink alone. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be less likely to suspect that a woman they know is an alcoholic.<ref name="Blume Laura N., Nielson Nancy H., Riggs Joseph A., et all 1998 861–870" >{{Cite journal | last1 = Blum | first1 = Laura N. | last2 = Nielsen | first2 = Nancy H. | last3 = Riggs | first3 = Joseph A. | last4 = Council on Scientific Affairs, American Medical Association | author-link4 = American Medical Association | title = Alcoholism and alcohol abuse among women: report of the council on scientific affairs | journal = [[Journal of Women's Health]] | volume = 7 | issue = 7 | pages = 861–870 | publisher = [[Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.]] | doi = 10.1089/jwh.1998.7.861 | date = September 1998 | url = http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/jwh.1998.7.861 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref> In contrast, reduced fear of stigma may lead men to admit that they are suffering from a medical condition, to display their drinking publicly, and to drink in groups. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be more likely to suspect that a man they know is an alcoholic.<ref name="Karrol Brad R. 2002 337–356" />

===Screening===
Several tools may be used to detect a loss of control of alcohol use. These tools are mostly [[self report study|self-report]]s in questionnaire form. Another common theme is a score or tally that sums up the general severity of alcohol use.<ref name="Kahan-1996">{{cite journal | author = Kahan M | title = Identifying and managing problem drinkers | journal = Can Fam Physician | volume = 42 | issue =  | pages = 661–71 | date = April 1996 | pmid = 8653034 | pmc = 2146411 | doi =  }}</ref>

The [[CAGE questionnaire]], named for its four questions, is one such example that may be used to screen patients quickly in a doctor's office.

{{Quotation|Two "yes" responses indicate that the respondent should be investigated further.

The questionnaire asks the following questions:

# Have you ever felt you needed to '''C'''ut down on your drinking?
# Have people '''A'''nnoyed you by criticizing your drinking?
# Have you ever felt '''G'''uilty about drinking?
# Have you ever felt you needed a drink first thing in the morning ('''E'''ye-opener) to steady your nerves or to get rid of a hangover?<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Ewing JA |title=Detecting alcoholism.

Other tests are sometimes used for the detection of alcohol dependence, such as the [[Alcohol Dependence Data Questionnaire]], which is a more sensitive diagnostic test than the [[CAGE questionnaire]]. It helps distinguish a diagnosis of alcohol dependence from one of heavy alcohol use.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/html.cfm/index3556EN.html |title=Alcohol Dependence Data Questionnaire (SADD) |author=Raistrick, D. |author2=Dunbar, G. |author3=Davidson, R. |year=1983 |publisher=European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction }}</ref> The [[Michigan Alcohol Screening Test]] (MAST) is a screening tool for alcoholism widely used by courts to determine the appropriate sentencing for people convicted of alcohol-related offenses,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncadd-sfv.org/symptoms/mast_test.html |title=Michigan Alcohol Screening Test |publisher=The National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence }}</ref> [[driving under the influence]] being the most common. The [[Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test]] (AUDIT), a screening questionnaire developed by the [[World Health Organization]], is unique in that it has been validated in six countries and is used internationally. Like the CAGE questionnaire, it uses a simple set of questions – a high score earning a deeper investigation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2001/WHO_MSD_MSB_01.6a.pdf |title=The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, Guidelines for Use in Primary Care |author=Thomas F.

===Genetic predisposition testing===
Psychiatric geneticists John I. Nurnberger, Jr., and Laura Jean Bierut suggest that alcoholism does not have a single cause—including genetic—but that genes do play an important role "by affecting processes in the body and brain that [[Gene-environment interaction|interact with]] one another and with an individual's life experiences to produce protection or susceptibility". They also report that fewer than a dozen alcoholism-related genes have been identified, but that more likely await discovery.<ref name="Nurnberger">Nurnberger, Jr., John I., and Bierut, Laura Jean.

At least one genetic test exists for an [[allele]] that is correlated to alcoholism and opiate addiction.<ref>New York Daily News (William Sherman) [http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2006/02/12/2006-02-12_test_targets_addiction_gene.html Test targets addiction gene] 11 February 2006</ref> Human dopamine receptor genes have a detectable variation referred to as the DRD2 TaqI polymorphism. Those who possess the A1 allele (variation) of this polymorphism have a small but significant tendency towards addiction to opiates and endorphin-releasing drugs like alcohol.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Berggren U, Fahlke C, Aronsson E, Karanti A, Eriksson M, Blennow K, Thelle D, Zetterberg H, Balldin J | title = The taqI DRD2 A1 allele is associated with alcohol-dependence although its effect size is small | journal = Alcohol and alcoholism (Oxford, Oxfordshire) | volume = 41 | issue = 5 | pages = 479–85 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16751215 | doi = 10.1093/alcalc/agl043 | url = http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/41/5/479 | issn = 0735-0414 | format = Free full text }}</ref> Although this allele is slightly more common in alcoholics and opiate addicts, it is not by itself an adequate predictor of alcoholism, and some researchers argue that evidence for DRD2 is contradictory.<ref name="Nurnberger" />

===Urine and blood tests===
There are reliable tests for the actual use of alcohol, one common test being that of [[blood alcohol content]] (BAC).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Jones AW | title = Urine as a biological specimen for forensic analysis of alcohol and variability in the urine-to-blood relationship | journal = Toxicol Rev | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–35 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16856767 | doi = 10.2165/00139709-200625010-00002 }}</ref> These tests do not differentiate alcoholics from non-alcoholics; however, long-term heavy drinking does have a few recognizable effects on the body, including:<ref>{{cite journal | author = Das SK, Dhanya L, Vasudevan DM | title = Biomarkers of alcoholism: an updated review | journal = Scand J Clin Lab Invest | volume = 68 | issue = 2 | pages = 81–92 | year = 2008 | pmid = 17852805 | doi = 10.1080/00365510701532662 }}</ref>

* [[Macrocytosis]] (enlarged [[Mean corpuscular volume|MCV]])
* Elevated [[Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase|GGT]]
* Moderate elevation of [[Aspartate transaminase|AST]] and [[Alanine transaminase|ALT]] and an AST: ALT ratio of 2:1
* High [[carbohydrate deficient transferrin]] (CDT)

With regard to alcoholism, BAC is useful to judge [[alcohol tolerance]], which in turn is sign of alcoholism.<ref name=DSM5/>

However, none of these blood tests for biological markers is as sensitive as screening questionnaires.

==Prevention==
The [[World Health Organization]], the [[European Union]] and other regional bodies, national governments and parliaments have formed alcohol policies in order to reduce the harm of alcoholism.<ref name="alchwho2010">{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/alcohol_drinking/en/ |title=Alcohol |author=World Health Organisation |year=2010 }}</ref><ref name="apitwhoer">{{Cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/mediacentre/fs1005e.pdf |title=Alcohol policy in the WHO European Region: current status and the way forward |date=12 September 2005 |publisher=World Health Organisation |format=PDF }}</ref> Targeting adolescents and young adults is regarded as an important step to reduce the harm of alcohol abuse. Increasing the age at which licit drugs of abuse such as alcohol can be purchased, the banning or restricting advertising of alcohol has been recommended as additional ways of reducing the harm of alcohol dependence and abuse. Credible, [[evidence based]] educational campaigns in the mass media about the consequences of alcohol abuse have been recommended. Guidelines for parents to prevent alcohol abuse amongst adolescents, and for helping young people with mental health problems have also been suggested.<ref name="acdacpovfa">{{cite journal | author = Crews F, He J, Hodge C | title = Adolescent cortical development: a critical period of vulnerability for addiction | journal = Pharmacol Biochem Behav | volume = 86 | issue = 2 | pages = 189–99 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17222895 | doi = 10.1016/j.pbb.2006.12.001 }}</ref>

==Management==
Treatments are varied because there are multiple perspectives of alcoholism. Those who approach alcoholism as a medical condition or disease recommend differing treatments from, for instance, those who approach the condition as one of social choice. Most treatments focus on helping people discontinue their alcohol intake, followed up with life training and/or social support to help them resist a return to alcohol use. Since alcoholism involves multiple factors which encourage a person to continue drinking, they must all be addressed to successfully prevent a relapse. An example of this kind of treatment is detoxification followed by a combination of supportive therapy, attendance at self-help groups, and ongoing development of coping mechanisms. The treatment community for alcoholism typically supports an abstinence-based [[zero tolerance]] approach; however, some prefer a harm-reduction approach.<ref name="Gabbard"/>

===Detoxification===
{{Main|Alcohol detoxification}}
[[Alcohol detoxification]] or 'detox' for alcoholics is an abrupt stop of alcohol drinking coupled with the substitution of drugs, such as [[benzodiazepines]], that have similar effects to prevent [[Alcohol withdrawal syndrome|alcohol withdrawal]]. Individuals who are only at risk of mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms can be detoxified as outpatients. Individuals at risk of a severe withdrawal syndrome as well as those who have significant or acute comorbid conditions are generally treated as inpatients. Detoxification does not actually treat alcoholism, and it is necessary to follow-up detoxification with an appropriate treatment program for alcohol dependence or abuse to reduce the risk of relapse.<ref name="Blondell-2005"/> Some symptoms of alcohol withdrawal such as depressed mood and anxiety typically take weeks or months to abate while other symptoms persist longer due to persisting neuroadaptations.<ref name="pmid20148778" /> Alcoholism has serious adverse effects on brain function; on average it takes one year of abstinence to recover from the cognitive deficits incurred by chronic alcohol abuse.<ref name="Stavro-2012">{{cite journal | author = Stavro K, Pelletier J, Potvin S | title = Widespread and sustained cognitive deficits in alcoholism: a meta-analysis. | journal = Addict Biol | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 203–13 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22264351 | doi = 10.1111/j.1369-1600.2011.00418.x }}</ref>

===Psychological===
[[Image:Alcoholics Anonymous Regional Service Center by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|A regional service center for [[Alcoholics Anonymous]].]]

Various forms of [[group therapy]] or [[psychotherapy]] can be used to deal with underlying psychological issues that are related to alcohol addiction, as well as provide relapse prevention skills. The mutual-help group-counseling approach is one of the most common ways of helping alcoholics maintain sobriety.<ref name="Morgan-Lopez-2006"/> [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] was one of the first organizations formed to provide mutual, nonprofessional counseling, and it is still the largest. Others include [[LifeRing Secular Recovery]], [[SMART Recovery]], [[Women For Sobriety]], and [[Secular Organizations for Sobriety]].

Rationing and moderation programs such as [[Moderation Management]] and DrinkWise do not mandate complete abstinence. While most alcoholics are unable to limit their drinking in this way, some return to moderate drinking. A 2002 US study by the [[National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism]] (NIAAA) showed that 17.7 percent of individuals diagnosed as alcohol dependent more than one year prior returned to low-risk drinking. This group, however, showed fewer initial symptoms of dependency.<ref name="DAWSON2005">{{cite journal | author = Dawson DA, Grant BF, Stinson FS, Chou PS, Huang B, Ruan WJ | title = Recovery from DSM-IV alcohol dependence: United States, 2001–2002 | journal = Addiction | volume = 100 | issue = 3 | pages = 281–92 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15733237 | doi = 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2004.00964.x | url = http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh29-2/131-142.htm }}</ref> A follow-up study, using the same subjects that were judged to be in remission in 2001–2002, examined the rates of return to problem drinking in 2004–2005.

===Medications===
In the United States there are four currently approved medications for alcoholism: [[disulfiram]], two forms of [[naltrexone]], and [[acamprosate]].<ref>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.  http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/AA76/AA76.htm</ref>  Several other drugs are also used and many are under investigation.

*[[Acamprosate]] (Campral) may stabilise the brain chemistry that is altered due to alcohol dependence via antagonising the actions of [[glutamate]], a neurotransmitter which is hyperactive in the [[post-withdrawal]] phase.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Mason BJ, Heyser CJ | title = The neurobiology, clinical efficacy and safety of acamprosate in the treatment of alcohol dependence | journal = Expert Opin Drug Saf | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 177–88 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20021295 | doi = 10.1517/14740330903512943 }}</ref> By reducing excessive NMDA activity which occurs at the onset of alcohol withdrawal, acamprosate can reduce or prevent alcohol withdrawal related neurotoxicity.<ref name="pmid20201812">{{cite journal | author = Mason BJ, Heyser CJ | title = Acamprosate: A prototypic neuromodulator in the treatment of alcohol dependence | journal = CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–32 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20201812 | pmc = 2853976 | doi = 10.2174/187152710790966641 }}</ref> Acamprosate reduces the risk of relapse amongst alcohol dependent persons.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Rösner S, Hackl-Herrwerth A, Leucht S, Lehert P, Vecchi S, Soyka M | title = Acamprosate for alcohol dependence | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 9 | pages = CD004332 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20824837 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004332.pub2 | editor1-last = Rösner | editor1-first = Susanne }}</ref><ref name=JAMA2014>{{cite journal | author = Jonas DE, Amick HR, Feltner C, Bobashev G, Thomas K, Wines R, Kim MM, Shanahan E, Gass CE, Rowe CJ, Garbutt JC | title = Pharmacotherapy for Adults With Alcohol Use Disorders in Outpatient Settings | journal = JAMA | volume = 311 | issue = 18 | pages = 1889–900 | date = 14 May 2014 | pmid = 24825644 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2014.3628 }}</ref>
*[[Benzodiazepines]], while useful in the management of acute alcohol withdrawal, if used long-term can cause a worse outcome in alcoholism. Alcoholics on chronic benzodiazepines have a lower rate of achieving abstinence from alcohol than those not taking benzodiazepines. This class of drugs is commonly prescribed to alcoholics for insomnia or anxiety management.<ref>{{Cite book|editor1-first=S.J.E. |editor1-last=Lindsay |editor2-first=Graham E. |editor2-last=Powell |title=The Handbook of Clinical Adult Psychology |url=https://books.google.com/?id=a6A9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA380 |edition=2nd |date=28 July 1998 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-07215-1 |page=402 |chapter= |chapterurl= }}</ref> Initiating prescriptions of benzodiazepines or sedative-hypnotics in individuals in recovery has a high rate of relapse with one author reporting more than a quarter of people relapsed after being prescribed sedative-hypnotics.

*[[Calcium carbimide]] (Temposil) works in the same way as disulfiram; it has an advantage in that the occasional adverse effects of disulfiram, [[hepatotoxicity]] and drowsiness, do not occur with calcium carbimide.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ogborne AC | title = Identifying and treating patients with alcohol-related problems | journal = CMAJ | volume = 162 | issue = 12 | pages = 1705–8 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10870503 | pmc = 1232509 }}</ref>
*[[Disulfiram]] (Antabuse) prevents the elimination of [[acetaldehyde]], a chemical the body produces when breaking down ethanol. Acetaldehyde itself is the cause of many [[hangover]] symptoms from alcohol use. The overall effect is severe discomfort when alcohol is ingested: an extremely fast-acting and long-lasting uncomfortable hangover. This discourages an alcoholic from drinking in significant amounts while they take the medicine.
*[[Naltrexone]] is a [[competitive antagonist]] for opioid receptors, effectively blocking the effects of [[endorphin]]s and [[opiate]]s. Naltrexone is used to decrease cravings for alcohol and encourage abstinence. Alcohol causes the body to release endorphins, which in turn release dopamine and activate the reward pathways; hence when naltrexone is in the body there is a reduction in the pleasurable effects from consuming alcohol.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Soyka M, Rösner S | title = Opioid antagonists for pharmacological treatment of alcohol dependence – a critical review | journal = Curr Drug Abuse Rev | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 280–91 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 19630726 | doi = 10.2174/1874473710801030280 }}</ref> Evidence supports a reduced risk of relapse among alcohol dependent persons and a decrease in excessive drinking.<ref name=JAMA2014/> [[Nalmefene]] also appears effective and works by a similar manner.<ref name=JAMA2014/>

Evidence does not support the use of [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs), [[tricyclic antidepressants]] (TCAs), [[antipsychotic]]s, or [[gabapentin]].<ref name=JAMA2014/>

===Dual addictions and dependences===
Alcoholics may also require treatment for other psychotropic [[drug addiction]]s and [[drug dependence]]s. The most common dual dependence syndrome with alcohol dependence is [[benzodiazepine dependence]], with studies showing 10–20 percent of alcohol-dependent individuals had problems of dependence and/or misuse problems of benzodiazepines.

Within the medical and scientific communities, there is broad consensus regarding alcoholism as a disease state. For example, the American Medical Association considers alcohol a drug and states that "drug addiction is a chronic, relapsing brain disease characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use despite often devastating consequences. It results from a complex interplay of biological vulnerability, environmental exposure, and developmental factors (e.g., stage of brain maturity)."<ref name="autogenerated1" />

Alcohol has a long history of use and misuse throughout recorded history. Biblical, Egyptian and Babylonian sources record the history of abuse and dependence on alcohol. In some ancient cultures alcohol was worshiped and in others its abuse was condemned. Excessive alcohol misuse and drunkenness were recognised as causing social problems even thousands of years ago. However, the defining of habitual drunkenness as it was then known as and its adverse consequences were not well established medically until the 18th century. In 1647 a Greek monk named Agapios was the first to document that chronic alcohol misuse was associated with toxicity to the nervous system and body which resulted in a range of medical disorders such as seizures, paralysis and internal bleeding. In 1920 the effects of alcohol abuse and chronic drunkenness led to the failed [[prohibition]] of alcohol being considered and eventually enforced briefly in America. In 2005 the cost of alcohol dependence and abuse was estimated to cost the US economy approximately 220 billion dollars per year, more than cancer and obesity.<ref name="soa2008">{{Cite book|last1=Potter |first1= James V. |volume=2 |title=Substances of Abuse |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WU73eJAIDI4C&pg=PA1 |date=14 January 2008 |publisher=AFS Publishing Co |isbn=978-1-930327-46-7 |pages=1–13 }}</ref>

The various health problems associated with long-term alcohol consumption are generally perceived as detrimental to society, for example, money due to lost labor-hours, medical costs, and secondary treatment costs.

[[Stereotype]]s of alcoholics are often found in [[fiction]] and [[popular culture]]. The "[[town drunk]]" is a [[stock character]] in Western popular culture.

Alcohol consumption is relatively similar between many European cultures, the United States, and Australia. In Asian countries that have a high gross domestic product, there is heightened drinking compared to other Asian countries, but it is nowhere near as high as it is in other countries like the United States.

In a study done on Korean immigrants in Canada, they reported alcohol was even an integral part of their meal, and is the only time solo drinking should occur.  They also believe alcohol is necessary at any social event as it helps conversations start.<ref>Wooksoo, K. (2009). Drinking Culture of Elderly Korean Immigrants in Canada: A Focus Group Study.

Caucasians have a much lower abstinence rate (11.8%) and much higher tolerance to symptoms (3.4±2.45 drinks) of alcohol than Chinese (33.4% and 2.2±1.78 drinks respectively).  Also, the more acculturation there is between cultures, the more influenced the culture is to adopt Caucasians drinking practices.<ref>Li, H. Z., & Rosenblood, L. (1994).

==Research==
[[Topiramate]], a derivative of the naturally occurring sugar monosaccharide D-fructose, has been found effective in helping alcoholics quit or cut back on the amount they drink. Evidence suggests that topiramate antagonizes excitatory glutamate receptors, inhibits dopamine release, and enhances inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid function. A 2008 review of the effectiveness of topiramate concluded that the results of published trials are promising, however as of 2008, data was insufficient to support using topiramate in conjunction with brief weekly compliance counseling as a first-line agent for alcohol dependence.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Olmsted CL, Kockler DR | title = Topiramate for alcohol dependence | journal = Ann Pharmacother | volume = 42 | issue = 10 | pages = 1475–80 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18698008 | doi = 10.1345/aph.1L157 | issn = 1060-0280 }}</ref> A 2010 review found that topiramate may be superior to existing alcohol pharmacotherapeutic options.
