Signs and symptoms of candidiasis vary depending on the area affected.<ref name=ID10/> Most candidal infections result in minimal complications such as redness, itching, and discomfort, though complications may be severe or even fatal if left untreated in certain populations. In [[immunocompetence|immunocompetent]] persons, candidiasis is usually a very localized infection of the skin or mucosal membranes, including  the [[oral cavity]] ([[oral thrush|thrush]]), the [[pharynx]] or [[esophagus]], the [[gastrointestinal tract]], the [[rectum]], [[anus]], perianal/perirectal or ano-rectal area (in men as well as women),<ref name="PubMed PMID 2626187">{{cite web|author1=Corno F.|author2=Caldart M.|author3=Toppino M.|author4=Tapparo A.|author5=Capozzi MP.|author6=Goitre M.|author7=Forte M.|author8=Forcheri V.|author9=Cervetti O|title=[Ano-rectal candidiasis.] [La candidosi ano-rettale.]|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2626187|website=PubMed/MEDLINE|publisher=Minerva Chirurgica|accessdate=30 January 2015|archiveurl=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2626187|archivedate=Nov 15, 1989 |location=National Library of Medicine|pages=1|language=English [Original Article in Italian]|date=1989-11-15}}</ref> the [[perineum]], the [[urinary bladder]], the fingernails or toenails (onychomycosis), and the genitalia ([[vagina]], [[penis]], etc.).<ref name=Baron>{{cite book | author = Walsh TJ, Dixon DM | chapter=Deep Mycoses |title=Baron's Medical Microbiology |editor=Baron S eds.| edition = 4th | publisher = Univ of Texas Medical Branch | year = 1996 |isbn=0-9631172-1-1 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mmed.section.4006 |display-editors=etal}}</ref>

{{Main|Candida (fungus)}}
''Candida'' yeasts are generally present in healthy humans, frequently part of the human body's normal oral and intestinal flora, and particularly on the skin; however, their growth is normally limited by the human [[immune system]], by competition of other [[microorganism]]s, such as bacteria occupying the same locations in the human body.<ref name=Goroll>{{cite book |author=Mulley, A.

== Diagnosis ==

[[File:Vaginal wet mount of candidal vulvovaginitis.jpg|thumb|[[KOH test]] on a [[vaginal wet mount]], showing slings of pseudohyphae of ''[[Candida albicans]]'' surrounded by round vaginal epithelial cells, conferring a diagnosis of [[candidal vulvovaginitis]] ]]
[[Image:Esophageal candidiasis (2) PAS stain.jpg|thumb|Micrograph of esophageal candidiasis showing hyphae, [[biopsy]] specimen, [[PAS stain]]]]

Diagnosis of a yeast infection is done either via microscopic examination or culturing.  For identification by light microscopy, a scraping or swab of the affected area is placed on a [[microscope slide]]. A single drop of 10% [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) solution is then added to the specimen. The KOH dissolves the skin cells, but leaves the ''Candida'' cells intact, permitting visualization of [[hyphae|pseudohyphae]] and budding [[yeast cell]]s typical of many ''Candida'' species.

For the culturing method, a sterile swab is rubbed on the infected skin surface. The swab is then streaked on a culture medium. The culture is incubated at 37&nbsp;°C for several days, to allow development of yeast or bacterial colonies. The characteristics (such as morphology and colour) of the colonies may allow initial diagnosis of the organism causing disease symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Srikumar Chakravarthi, Nagaraja HS |title=A comprehensive review of the occurrence and management of systemic candidiasis as an opportunistic infection |journal=Microbiology Journal |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=1–5 |year=2010 |url=http://scialert.net/abstract/?doi=mj.2011.1.7|issn=2153-0696}}</ref>

== Treatment ==
Candidiasis is commonly treated with [[antimycotic]]s; these [[antifungal drug]]s include topical [[clotrimazole]], topical [[nystatin]], [[fluconazole]], and topical [[ketoconazole]].

===Localized infection===
Mouth and throat candidiasis are treated with antifungal medication. Oral candidiasis usually responds to topical treatments; otherwise, systemic antifungal medication may be needed for oral infections. Candida esophagitis may be treated orally or intravenously; for severe or azole-resistant esophageal candidiasis, treatment with amphotericin B may be necessary.<ref name=CDC2014Otx/>

A one-time dose of fluconazole is 90% effective in treating a vaginal yeast infection.<ref name=Moosa>{{cite journal | author = Moosa MY, Sobel JD, Elhalis H, Du W, Akins RA | title = Fungicidal Activity of Fluconazole against Candida albicans in a Synthetic Vagina-Simulative Medium | journal = Antimicrob.

For vaginal yeast infection in [[pregnancy]], topical [[imidazole]] or [[triazole]] antifungals are considered the therapy of choice owing to available safety data.<ref name="soong2009"/> Systemic absorption of these topical formulations is minimal, posing little risk of [[transplacental]] transfer.<ref name="soong2009"/> In vaginal yeast infection in pregnancy, treatment with topical azole antifungals is recommended for 7 days instead of a shorter duration.<ref name="soong2009">{{cite journal | author = Soong D, Einarson A | title = Vaginal yeast infections during pregnancy. | journal = Canadian family physician Medecin de famille canadien | volume = 55 | issue = 3 | pages = 255–6 | date = Mar 2009 | pmid = 19282531 | pmc=2654841}}</ref>

No benefit from probiotics has been found for active infections.<ref name=Ab2009/>

===Blood infection===
Systemic candidiasis occurs when Candida yeast enters the bloodstream and may spread (becoming disseminated candidiasis) to other organs, including the [[central nervous system]], kidneys, liver, bones, muscles, joints, spleen, or eyes. Treatment typically consists of oral or [[intravenous]] antifungal medications.<ref name=NIHSystemic>{{cite web|title=Systemic candidiasis|url=http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/1076/systemic-candidiasis/resources/1 |website=NIH.gov |publisher=U.S. DHHS, National Institute of Health |date= Oct 2014 |accessdate=April 19, 2015}}</ref> In candidal infections of the blood, intravenous fluconazole or an [[echinocandin]] such as [[caspofungin]] may be used.<ref name=IDSA2009>{{cite journal | author = Pappas PG, Kauffman CA, Andes D, Benjamin DK, Calandra TF, Edwards JE, Filler SG, Fisher JF, Kullberg BJ, Ostrosky-Zeichner L, Reboli AC, Rex JH, Walsh TJ, Sobel JD | title = Clinical practice guidelines for the management of candidiasis: 2009 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. | journal = Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America | volume = 48 | issue = 5 | pages = 503–35 | date = Mar 1, 2009 | pmid = 19191635 | doi=10.1086/596757}}</ref> [[Amphotericin B]] is another option.<ref name=IDSA2009/>

Vulvovaginal candidiasis was first described in 1849 by Wilkinson.<ref name="Lynch 1994" /> In 1875, Haussmann demonstrated the causative organism in both vulvovaginal and oral candidiasis is the same.<ref name="Lynch 1994" />

With the advent of antibiotics following World War II, the rates of candidiasis increased. The rates than decreased in the 1950s following the development of [[nystatin]].<ref name="Obladen 2012">{{cite journal | author = Obladen M | title = Thrush - nightmare of the foundling hospitals. | journal = Neonatology | volume = 101 | issue = 3 | pages = 159–65 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22024688 | doi = 10.1159/000329879 }}</ref>

The colloquial term "thrush" refers to the resemblance of the white flecks present in some forms of candidiasis (''e.g.'' pseudomembranous candidiasis) with the breast of the [[thrush (bird)|bird of the same name]].<ref name=emedicine/medscape>{{cite web|last=Scully|first=Crispian|title=Mucosal Candidiasis (Medscape)|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1075227-overview|publisher=WebMD LLC|accessdate=8 September 2013}}</ref> The term candidosis is largely used in British English, and candidiasis in American English.<ref name="Lynch 1994">{{cite journal | author = Lynch DP | title = Oral candidiasis.

The [[genus]] ''Candida'' and [[species]] ''C. albicans'' were described by botanist [[Christine Marie Berkhout]] in her doctoral thesis at the [[University of Utrecht]] in 1923. Over the years, the classification of the genera and species has evolved. Obsolete names for this genus include ''Mycotorula'' and ''Torulopsis''. The species has also been known in the past as ''Monilia albicans'' and ''Oidium albicans''. The current classification is ''[[nomen conservandum]]'', which means the name is authorized for use by the International Botanical Congress (IBC).<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.bgbm.org/iapt/nomenclature/code/SaintLouis/0000St.Luistitle.htm |title=International Code of Botanical Nomenclature |year=2000 |isbn=3-904144-22-7 |location =Königstein | accessdate=2008-11-23}}</ref>

The genus ''Candida'' includes about 150 different species; however, only a few are known to cause human infections. ''C. albicans'' is the most significant [[pathogen]]ic species. Other species pathogenic in humans include ''C. tropicalis'', ''C. glabrata'', ''C. krusei'', ''C. parapsilosis'', ''C. dubliniensis'', and ''C. lusitaniae''.

The name ''Candida'' was proposed by Berkhout. It is from the Latin word ''toga candida'', referring to the white [[toga]] (robe) worn by candidates for the Senate of the ancient Roman republic.<ref name="Lynch 1994" /> The specific epithet ''albicans'' also comes from Latin, ''albicare'' meaning "to whiten".<ref name="Lynch 1994" /> These names refer to the generally white appearance of ''Candida'' species when cultured.
