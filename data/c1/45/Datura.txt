'''''Datura''''' is a [[genus]] of nine species of poisonous [[Vespertine (biology)|vespertine]] [[flowering plant]]s belonging to the family [[Solanaceae]]. They are known as '''angel's trumpets''', sometimes sharing that name with the closely related genus ''[[Brugmansia]]'', and commonly known as daturas. They are also sometimes called '''moonflowers''', one of several plant species to be so. Its precise and natural distribution is uncertain, owing to its extensive [[Plant cultivation|cultivation]] and [[Naturalisation (biology)|naturalization]] throughout the temperate and tropical regions of the globe. Its distribution within the [[Americas]] and [[North Africa]], however, is most likely restricted to the [[United States]] and [[Mexico]] in North America, and [[Tunisia]] in Africa, where the highest species diversity occurs.

All species of ''Datura'' are poisonous, especially their seeds and flowers.

Some [[South America]]n plants formerly thought of as ''Datura'' are now treated as belonging to the distinct genus ''[[Brugmansia]]''<ref>{{cite book | editor = Hawkes, J. G. | author = Lester, R. N.; Nee, M.; Estrada, N. | title = Solanaceae III – Taxonomy, Chemistry, Evolution (Proceedings of Third International Conference on Solanaceae) | publisher = Royal Botanic Gardens | year = 1991 | location = Kew | pages = 197–210 | isbn = 0-947643-31-1 }}</ref> (''Brugmansia'' differs from ''Datura'' in that it is woody, making [[shrub]]s or small [[tree]]s, and it has pendulous flowers, rather than erect ones). Other related genera include ''[[Henbane|Hyoscyamus]]'' and ''[[Atropa]]''.

==Etymology==
The name ''Datura'' is taken from [[Hindi]] धतूरा ''dhatūra'' 'thorn-apple',<ref>American Heritage Dictionary: ''datura''</ref> ultimately from [[Sanskrit]] धत्तूर ''dhattūra'' 'white thorn-apple'.<ref>[[Monier Monier-Williams]], ''A Sanskrit-English Dictionary''.</ref> In Sanskrit it is referred as "Kanak" and "Unmatt" in the ancient scriptures of Indian [[Ayurveda]] by sages [[Sushruta]] and [[Charaka]] in the ayurvedic text [[Sushrut]]. Record of this name in English dates back to 1662.<ref>the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' or [[OED]]</ref> [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] refers to one type in ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' as ''apple-Peru''. In Mexico, its common name is ''toloache''.

==Description==

''Datura'' species are [[Herbaceous plant|herbaceous]], leafy [[annual plant|annuals]] and short-lived [[perennial plant|perennials]] which can reach up to 2 m in height. The [[leaf|leaves]] are alternate, 10–20&nbsp;cm long and 5–18&nbsp;cm broad, with a lobed or toothed margin. The [[flower]]s are erect or spreading (not pendulous like those of ''Brugmansia''), trumpet-shaped, 5–20&nbsp;cm long and 4–12&nbsp;cm broad at the mouth; colors vary from white to yellow, pink, and pale purple. The [[fruit]] is a spiny [[capsule (fruit)|capsule]] 4–10&nbsp;cm long and 2–6&nbsp;cm broad, splitting open when ripe to release the numerous [[seed]]s. The seeds disperse freely over pastures, fields and even wasteland locations.

''Datura'' belongs to the classic "witches' weeds", along with [[deadly nightshade]], [[henbane]], and [[Mandrake (plant)|mandrake]]. Most parts of the plants are toxic, and datura has a long history of use for causing delirious states and death. It was well known as an essential ingredient of  potions and witches' brews.<ref name="Preissel"/>

In India it has been referred to as "Poisonous" and as an [[aphrodisiac]]. In little measures it was used in [[Ayurveda]] as a medicine from the ancient times. It is used in rituals and prayers to [[Shiva]].

The [[Caterpillar|larvae]] of some [[Lepidoptera]] ([[butterfly]] and [[moth]]) species, including ''[[Hypercompe|Hypercompe indecisa]]'', eat some ''Datura'' species.

==Species and cultivars==
[[File:Datura metel - flower view 01.jpg|thumb|right|''Datura metel'']]
It is difficult to classify ''Datura'' as to its species, and it often happens that the descriptions of new species are accepted prematurely. Later, these "new species" are found to be simply varieties that have evolved due to conditions at a specific location. They usually disappear in a few years. Contributing to the confusion is the fact that various species, such as ''D. wrightii'' and ''D. inoxia'', are very similar in appearance, and the variation within a species can be extreme. For example, ''Datura'' species can change size of plant, leaf, and flowers, all depending on location. The same species, when growing in a half-shady, damp location can develop into a flowering bush half as tall as an adult human of average height, but when growing in a very dry location, will only grow into a thin plant not much more than ankle-high, with tiny flowers and a few miniature leaves.<ref name='Preissel'>{{cite book | author = Preissel, U.; Preissel, H.-G. | title = Brugmansia and Datura: Angel's Trumpets and Thorn Apples | publisher = Firefly Books | year = 2002 | location = Buffalo, NY | pages = 106–129 | url = http://www.amazon.com/Brugmansia-Datura-Angels-Trumpets-Apples/dp/1552095584 | isbn = 1-55209-598-3 }}</ref>

American Brugmansia and Datura Society, Inc. (ABADS) is designated in the 2004 edition of the [[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]] as the official [[International Cultivar Registration Authority]] for ''Datura''. This role was delegated to ABADS by the [[International Society for Horticultural Science]] in 2002.

==Cultivation==
[[File:Datura fruit.jpg|thumb|200px|Fruit]]
[[File:Datura innoxia fruit split open.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''D. inoxia'' with ripe, split-open fruit]]
''Datura'' species are usually planted annually from the seed produced in the spiny pods, but with care, plants can be overwintered. Most species are suited to being planted outside or in containers. As a rule, they need warm, sunny places and soil that will keep their roots dry. When grown outdoors in good locations, the plants tend to reseed themselves and may become invasive. In containers, they should have porous, aerated potting soil with adequate drainage. The plants are susceptible to fungi in the root area, so organic enrichment such as compost and manure should be avoided.<ref name="Preissel"/>

==Toxicity==

All ''Datura'' plants contain [[tropane alkaloids]] such as [[scopolamine]], [[hyoscyamine]], and [[atropine]], primarily in their seeds and flowers. Because of the presence of these substances, ''Datura'' has been used for centuries in some cultures as a [[poison]].<ref name="Preissel"/><ref>{{cite journal | author = Adams, J. D. Jr.; Garcia, C. | title = Spirit, Mind and Body in Chumash Healing | journal = Evidence-based Complementary and Alternative Medicine | year = 2005 | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 459–463 | doi = 10.1093/ecam/neh130 | pmid = 16322802 | pmc = 1297503 | url = http://ecam.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/2/4/459 }}</ref> There can be a 5:1 toxin variation between plants,{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} and a given plant's toxicity depends on its age, where it is growing, and the local weather conditions. These variations makes ''Datura'' exceptionally hazardous as a drug.

In traditional cultures, a great deal of experience with and detailed knowledge of ''Datura'' was critical to minimize harm.<ref name="Preissel"/> Many tragic incidents result from modern users ingesting ''Datura''. For example, in the 1990s and 2000s, the United States media contained stories of [[adolescent]]s and young adults dying or becoming seriously ill from intentionally ingesting ''Datura''.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5233a2.htm | author = Goetz, R.; Siegel, E.; Scaglione, J.;  Belson, M.; Patel, M. | title = Suspected Moonflower Intoxication -- Ohio, 2002 | journal = MMWR Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report | year = 2003 | volume = 52 | issue = 33 | pages = 788–791 | pmid = 12931077 | publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-11-01-jimson_x.htm | title = | accessdate = 2009-02-15 | publisher = [[USA TODAY]] | first = D. | last = Leinwand | date = 2006-11-01 }}</ref> There are also several reports in the medical literature of deaths from ''D. stramonium'' and ''[[Datura_ferox|D. ferox]]'' intoxication.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Michalodimitrakis | first1 = M. | last2 = Koutselinis | first2 = A. | title = Discussion of "Datura stramonium: A fatal poisoning" | journal = Journal of Forensic Sciences | year = 1984 | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 961–962 | pmid = 6502123

''Datura'' toxins may be ingested accidentally by consumption of [[honey]] produced by several wasp species, including ''[[Brachygastra lecheguana]]'', during the ''Datura'' blooming season. It appears that these semi-domesticated [[honey wasp]]s collect ''Datura'' nectar for honey production which can lead to poisoning.<ref name="Bequaert">Bequaert, J.Q. (1932). “The Nearctic social wasps of the subfamily polybiinae (Hymenoptera; Vespidae)". Entomologica Americana. 13(3):87-150.</ref>

In some parts of [[Europe]] and [[India]], ''Datura'' has been a popular [[poison]] for [[suicide]] and [[murder]]. From 1950 to 1965, the State Chemical Laboratories in [[Agra]], India, investigated 2,778 deaths caused by ingesting ''Datura.''<ref name="Preissel" /><ref name="SS1">{{cite web| last=Andrews|first=Dale |title=Daturas| url=http://www.sleuthsayers.org/2012/02/daturas.html |work=Crime Poisons| publisher=SleuthSayers |accessdate=4 March 2013| location=Washington |date=2013-02-28}}</ref>

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported accidental poisoning resulting in hospitalization for a family of six who inadvertently ingested ''Datura'' used as an ingredient in stew.<ref name='CDCStew'>{{cite journal | title = Jimsonweed Poisoning Associated with a Homemade Stew – Maryland, 2008 | journal = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report | date = 2010-02-05 | first = W. | last = Bontoyan | volume = 59 | issue = 4 | pages = 102–103 | url = http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm5904.pdf | format = pdf | accessdate = 2010-02-11 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>

In some places, it is prohibited to buy, sell, or cultivate ''Datura'' plants.<ref name="Preissel" /><ref name="SS1" />

===Effects of ingestion===

Due to the potent combination of [[anticholinergic]] substances it contains, ''Datura'' intoxication typically produces effects similar to that of an anticholinergic [[delirium]] (usually involving a complete inability to differentiate [[reality]] from [[fantasy]]); [[hyperthermia]]; [[tachycardia]]; bizarre, and possibly violent behavior; and severe [[mydriasis]] (dilated pupils) with resultant painful [[photophobia]] that can last several days. Pronounced [[amnesia]] is another commonly reported effect.<ref name='Freye'>{{cite book | last = Freye | first = E. | title = Pharmacology and Abuse of Cocaine, Amphetamines, Ecstasy and Related Designer Drugs | chapter = Toxicity of Datura Stramonium | publisher = Springer | year = 2010 | location = Netherlands | pages = 217–218 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/u42k03r4v3234615/ | isbn = 978-90-481-2447-3 | doi = 10.1007/978-90-481-2448-0_34 }}</ref>

In ''Pharmacology and Abuse of Cocaine, Amphetamines, Ecstasy and Related Designer Drugs'', Freye asserts:
Few substances have received as many severely negative recreational experience reports as has ''Datura''. The overwhelming majority of those who describe their use of ''Datura'' find their experiences extremely unpleasant both mentally and often physically dangerous.<ref name = "Freye"/>  However, anthropologists have found that indigenous groups, with a great deal of experience with and detailed knowledge of ''Datura'', have been known to use Datura recreationally (including the Navajo and especially the Havasupai).<ref>http://www.jcimjournal.com/jim/FullText2.aspx?articleID=jintegrmed2013016</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Stairways to Heaven: Drugs in American Religious History | first= Robert C | last=Fuller| year=2000| page=32| isbn=0813366127| url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YS-T8dfZ5hMC&pg=PA32&lpg=PA32&dq=Datura+rebirth&source=bl&ots=h7e0dARW7u&sig=GK9LNieKiK_5wO_EX1rRLnluiIg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Fw-LVNqWA4m2UfTWgJAK&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=Datura%20rebirth&f=false }}</ref> The knowledge of Datura's properties was critical to minimize harm.<ref name="Preissel"/>

===Treatment===

Due to their agitated behavior and confused mental state, victims of ''Datura'' poisoning are typically hospitalized. Stomach pumping and the administration of [[activated charcoal]] can be used to reduce the stomach's absorption of the ingested material. The drug [[physostigmine]] is used to reverse the effect of the poisons. [[Benzodiazepines]] can be given to curb the patient's agitation, and supportive care with oxygen, hydration, and symptomatic treatment is often provided. Observation of the patient is indicated until the symptoms resolve, usually from 24–36 hours after ingestion of the ''Datura''.<ref name="SS1" /><ref>{{cite journal | last = Bliss | first = M. | title = Datura Plant Poisoning | journal = Clinical Toxicology Review | year = 2001 | volume = 23 | issue = 6 | url = http://www.maripoisoncenter.com/assets/images/pdfs/ctrs/CTR%20Datura%20Plant%20Poisoning.pdf | format = pdf }}</ref>
