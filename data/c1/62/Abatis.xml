The 3,600 French troops defeated a massive army of 16,000 British and Colonial troops by fronting their defensive positions with an extremely dense abatis. The British found the defences almost impossible to breach and were forced to withdraw with some 2,600 casualties. Other uses of an abatis can be found at the<space/><link><target>Battle of the Chateauguay</target></link>, 26 October 1813, when approximately 1,300 Canadian<space/><link><target>voltigeurs</target></link>, under the command of Charles-Michel de Salaberry, defeated an American corps of approximately 4,000 men, or at the<space/><link><target>Battle of Plattsburgh</target></link>.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Construction</heading><paragraph><link><target>file:Giant abatis.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>upright</part><part>Giant abatis, made from entire trees, can make an effective anti-vehicle obstacle.

Also, if laced together with<space/><link><target>rope</target></link><space/>instead of<space/><link><target>wire</target></link>, the rope can be very quickly destroyed by such fires, after which the abatis can be quickly pulled apart by<space/><link><target>grappling hook</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>thrown from a safe distance.</paragraph><paragraph>An important advantage is that an improvised abatis can be quickly formed in forested areas. This can be done by simply cutting down a row of trees so that they fall with their tops toward the enemy. An alternative is to place explosives so as to blow the trees down.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Modern use</heading><paragraph><link><target>file:Abatis Map Symbol.svg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>United States military symbol for an abatis</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>Abatis are rarely seen nowadays, having been largely replaced by<space/><link><target>wire obstacle</target><trail>s</trail></link>.

Furthermore, it is recommended that the trees remain connected to the stumps and the length of roadway covered be at least<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>80</arg><arg>yard</arg></template>s.
