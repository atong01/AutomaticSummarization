'''AOL Inc.''' (previously known as '''America Online''', written as '''AOL''' and styled as '''Aol.''') is an American [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] [[mass media]] corporation based in [[New York City]] that develops, grows, and invests in brands and [[web site]]s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lunden|first=Ingrid|title=AOL Reorganizes Into Membership, Brand And Ad Units [Incl Armstrong's Memo]|url=http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/29/aol-reorganizes-into-membership-brand-and-ad-units-incl-armstrongs-memo/|publisher=TechCrunch|accessdate=June 29, 2012}}</ref> The company's business spans [[digital distribution]] of content, products, and services, which it offers to consumers, publishers, and advertisers.

AOL originally [[Internet service provider|provided dial up service]] to millions of Americans. At the height of its success it merged with media conglomerate [[Time Warner]]. As dial up rapidly lost ground to broadband in the mid-2000s, AOL's fortunes significantly retracted and it lost the vast majority of its value, laying off thousands of employees. Time Warner was eventually spun off, and is now worth approximately ten times that of AOL.

On May 12, 2015, [[Verizon Communications]] announced plans to buy AOL for $50 per share in a deal valued at $4.4 billion.<ref name="buyout-cnbc">{{cite news|last1=Imbert|first1=Fred|title=Verizon to buy AOL for $4.4B; AOL shares soar|url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/102670331|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=May 12, 2015|date=May 12, 2015}}</ref> The acquisition was completed on June 23, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sawers |first=Paul |url=http://venturebeat.com/2015/06/23/verizon-completes-4-4b-acquisition-of-aol/ |title=Verizon completes $4.4B acquisition of AOL |publisher=VentureBeat |date=June 23, 2015 |accessdate=June 23, 2015}}</ref>

== History ==
AOL began in 1983, as a short-lived venture called '''Control Video Corporation''' (or '''CVC'''), founded by [[Bill von Meister]]. Its sole product was an online service called [[GameLine]] for the [[Atari 2600]] [[video game console]], after von Meister's idea of buying music on demand was rejected by [[Warner Bros.]]<ref name="Klein2003">{{cite book |last=Klein |first=Alec |title=Stealing Time: Steve Case, Jerry Levin, and the Collapse of AOL Time Warner |year=2003 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0-7432-5984-X }}</ref> Subscribers bought a [[modem]] from the company for [[United States dollar|US$]]49.95 and paid a one-time US$15 setup fee. GameLine permitted subscribers to temporarily download games and keep track of high scores, at a cost of US$1 per game.<ref name=history>{{cite news|title=A Brief History of AOL|author=David Lumb|work=Fast Company|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3046194/fast-feed/a-brief-history-of-aol|date=May 12, 2015|accessdate=May 12, 2015}}</ref> The telephone disconnected and the downloaded game would remain in GameLine's Master Module and playable until the user turned off the console or downloaded another game.

In January 1983, [[Steve Case]] was hired as a marketing consultant for Control Video on the recommendation of his brother, investment banker Dan Case. In May 1983, [[Jim Kimsey]] became a manufacturing consultant for Control Video, which was near bankruptcy. Kimsey was brought in by his West Point friend [[Frank Caufield]], an investor in the company.<ref name="Klein2003" /> In early 1985, von Meister left the company.<ref name=Warner>{{cite book|title=Media Selling: Television, Print, Internet, Radio|author=Charles Warner|year=2011|isbn=1444359274|publisher=John Wiley & Sons}}</ref>

On May 24, 1985, '''Quantum Computer Services''', an online services company, was founded by Jim Kimsey from the remnants of Control Video, with Kimsey as [[Chief Executive Officer]], and [[Marc Seriff]] as [[Chief Technology Officer]]. Out of 100 employees from Control Video, only 10 were retained for the new company,<ref name="Klein2003" /> one of whom was Steve Case, who was promoted to vice-president of marketing. In 1987, Case was promoted again to executive vice-president. Kimsey soon began to groom Case to take over the role of CEO, which he did when Kimsey retired in 1991.<ref name=Warner />

Kimsey changed the company's strategy, and in 1985, launched a dedicated online service for [[Commodore 64]] and [[Commodore 128|128]] computers, originally called [[Quantum Link]] ("Q-Link" for short).<ref name=history /> The Quantum Link software was based on software licensed from [[PlayNET|PlayNet, Inc]], (founded in 1983 by Howard Goldberg and Dave Panzl). In May 1988, Quantum and [[Apple Computer|Apple]] launched [[AppleLink]] Personal Edition for [[Apple II family|Apple II]] <ref>{{Triangulation|201|Peter Friedman}}</ref> and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] computers. In August 1988, Quantum launched PC Link, a service for IBM-compatible [[personal computer|PCs]] developed in a joint venture with the [[Tandy Corporation]]. After the company parted ways with Apple in October 1989, Quantum changed the service's name to America Online.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thocp.net/timeline/1989.htm |title=History of Computing Industrial Era (1985–1990) |work=The History of Computing Project |accessdate=September 24, 2005 |date=March 20, 2006 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20051103111647/http://www.thocp.net/timeline/1989.htm| archivedate= 3 November 2005 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah22.html |title=Apple II history chapter 22 |date=December 31, 2002 |accessdate=September 24, 2005 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050828233812/http://apple2history.org/history/ah22.html| archivedate= 28 August 2005 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  Case was promoted to and sold AOL as the online service for people unfamiliar with computers, in contrast to [[CompuServe]], which was well established in the technical community.<ref name=Warner />

From the beginning, AOL included [[online games]] in its mix of products; many classic and casual games were included in the original PlayNet software system. In the early years of AOL the company introduced many innovative online interactive titles and games, including:

* Graphical chat environments [[Habitat (video game)|Habitat]] (1986–1988) and [[Club Caribe]] (1988) from [[LucasArts]].
* The first online interactive fiction series [[QuantumLink Serial]] by [[Tracy Reed (writer)|Tracy Reed]] (1988).
* [[Quantum Space]], the first fully automated [[Play-by-mail game|Play by email]] game (1989–1991).

=== 1990s: a new Internet age ===
In February 1991, AOL for [[DOS]] was launched using a [[GeoWorks]] interface followed a year later by AOL for Windows.<ref name=history /> This coincided with growth in pay-based online services, like [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]], [[CompuServe]], and [[GEnie]]. 1991 also saw the introduction of an original [[Dungeons & Dragons]] title called ''[[Neverwinter Nights (AOL game)|Neverwinter Nights]]'' from [[Stormfront Studios]]; which was one of the first Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games to depict the adventure with graphics instead of text.<ref>[http://www.bladekeep.com/nwn/index2.htm The History of NWM]</ref>

During the early 1990s, the average subscription lasted for about 25 months and accounted for $350 in total revenue.<ref name="quora20101224">{{cite web|url=http://www.quora.com/AOL-History/How-much-did-it-cost-AOL-to-distribute-all-those-CDs-back-in-the-1990s |title=AOL History: How much did it cost AOL to distribute all those CDs back in the 1990's? |publisher=Quora |date=2010-12-24 |accessdate=July 13, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20121027155641/http://www.quora.com/AOL-History/How-much-did-it-cost-AOL-to-distribute-all-those-CDs-back-in-the-1990s |archivedate=October 27, 2012 }}</ref> AOL discontinued Q-Link and PC Link in late 1994.

Over the next several years, AOL launched services with the [[National Education Association]], the [[American Federation of Teachers]], ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'', the [[Smithsonian Institution]], the [[Library of Congress]], Pearson, Scholastic, ASCD, NSBA, NCTE, Discovery Networks, Turner Education Services (CNN Newsroom), National Public Radio, The Princeton Review, Stanley Kaplan, Barron's, Highlights for Kids, the US Department of Education, and many other education providers. AOL offered the first real-time homework help service (the Teacher Pager—1990; prior to this, AOL provided homework help bulletin boards), the first service by children, for children (Kids Only Online, 1991), the first online service for parents (the Parents Information Network, 1991), the first online courses (1988), the first omnibus service for teachers (the Teachers' Information Network, 1990), the first online exhibit (Library of Congress, 1991), the first parental controls, and many other online education firsts.<ref>{{cite book|title=Netstudy|author=Michael Wolff|publisher=Dell Publishing|year=1997}}</ref>

AOL charged its users an hourly fee until [http://www.businessweek.com/1997/04/b351154.htm December 1996], when the company changed to a flat monthly rate of $19.95.<ref name=history /> During this time, AOL connections would be flooded with users trying to get on, and many canceled their accounts due to constant [[busy signal]]s. A commercial featuring Steve Case telling people AOL was working day and night to fix the problem was made. Within three years, AOL's userbase grew to 10 million people.

AOL was quickly running out of room in October 1996 for its network at the Fairfax County campus. In 1996, AOL moved to 22000 AOL Way in [[Dulles, Virginia|Dulles]], unincorporated [[Loudoun County, Virginia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corp.aol.com/about-aol/company-overview|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080208121604/http://corp.aol.com/about-aol/company-overview|archivedate=8 February 2008|title=Company Overview|work=corp.aol.com|publisher=''AOL''|date=February 8, 2008}}</ref> The move to Dulles took place in mid-1996 and provided room for future growth.

On March 31, 1997, the short-lived [[eWorld]] was purchased by AOL. In 1997, about half of all US homes with internet access had it through AOL.<ref>"The Fall of Facebook". (December 2014).  ''The Atlantic'', pp. 35.</ref> During this time, AOL's content channels, under [[Jason Seiken]], including News, Sports, and Entertainment, experienced their greatest growth as AOL become the dominant online service internationally with more than 34 million subscribers. In November 1998, AOL announced it would acquire [[Netscape]].<ref name=history /> The deal closed on March 17, 1999.

=== 2000s: Transition re-branding and decline ===
[[File:Aol subscribers Q201-Q407.png|thumb|right|Decline in U.S. subscribers 2Q 2001 – 2Q 2009.]]
In January 2000, AOL and [[Time Warner]] announced plans to merge, forming AOL Time Warner, Inc. The terms of the deal called for AOL shareholders to own 55% of the new, combined company. The deal closed on January 11, 2001. The new company was led by executives from AOL, SBI, and Time Warner. [[Gerald Levin]], who had served as CEO of Time Warner, was CEO of the new company.

In 2004, along with the launch of AOL 9.0 Optimized, AOL also made available the option of personalized greetings which would enable the user to hear his or her name while accessing basic functions and mail alerts, or while logging in or out. In 2005, AOL broadcast the [[Live 8]] concert live over the Internet, and thousands of users downloaded clips of the concert over the following months.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Live 8|work=Billboard|date=Jul 29, 2006|page=22}}</ref>  In late 2005, AOL released AOL Safety & Security Center, a bundle of McAfee anti-virus, [[Computer Associates|CA]] anti-spyware, and proprietary firewall and phishing protection software.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Protect your PC|work=Kiplinger's Personal Finance|date=July 2007|author=Jeff Bertolucci}}</ref>  News reports in late 2005 identified companies such as [[Yahoo!]], [[Microsoft]], and [[Google]] as candidates for turning AOL into a joint venture.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/nov2005/tc20051111_725373.htm|title = Has AOL Met Its Match?|first = Catherine|last = Yang|work=BusinessWeek|date= November 11, 2005|accessdate =August 1, 2006 }}</ref> Those plans were abandoned when it was revealed on December 20, 2005 that Google would purchase a 5% share of AOL for $1&nbsp;billion.

'''AOL Desktop''' is an internet suite produced by AOL that integrates a [[web browser]], a [[Media player (application software)|media player]] and an [[instant messenger]] client.<ref name="daol.aol.com"/> Based on [[AOL OpenRide]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beta.aol.com/projects/chat/chat_logs/20070808_Helix_FormalChat.html|title=August 8th Helix Beta Chat|work=aol.com}}</ref> it is an upgrade from such.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://betanews.com/2007/07/26/aol-heads-in-new-direction-with-helix/|title=AOL Heads in New Direction with 'Helix'|work=BetaNews}}</ref> The Mac OS X version is based on [[WebKit]].

AOL Desktop is different from previous AOL browsers, which are still available. Its features are focused on browsing instead of [[email]]. For instance, one does not have to sign into AOL in order to use it as a regular browser.  In addition, non-AOL email accounts can be accessed through it. There are three main buttons: "MAIL", "IM", and "WEB". The first two require users to sign in but "WEB" can be instantly used.

== Corporate social responsibility ==
Since spinning off from Time Warner in 2010, AOL has made corporate social responsibility an important part of its mission. In its company values, AOL states, "We are in the business of helping people, period."<ref>{{cite web|title=AOL Corporate Site – Our Values|url=http://corp.aol.com/our-values|accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref> For the company’s corporate social responsibility efforts, AOL's CEO Tim Armstrong was included in a July 9, 2012 Adweek article, "The Givers," highlighting individuals who have committed their and their companies' time, money and resources to a diverse range of causes.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Givers|url=http://www.adweek.com/news-gallery/advertising-branding/givers-141741|publisher=Adweek|accessdate=July 9, 2012}}</ref>

Each year on the company’s birthday, AOL employees around the world are invited to participate in Monster Help Day, a global community service day dedicated to strengthening the communities in which AOL employees live and work.<ref>{{cite web|title=AOL Impact – Monster Help Day|url=http://impact.aol.com/monster-help-day/|publisher=AOL|accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref> Other corporate social responsibility initiatives include producing cause-related content for AOL properties; donating PSA campaigns throughout the AOL network; empowering consumers through cause-related contests and initiatives; implementing a permanent cause module on AOL's homepage, dedicated to promoting a different nonprofit daily; and advocating for internet safety through its blog SafetyClicks.com.<ref>{{cite web|title=AOL Corporate Site – Corporate Citizenship|url=http://corp.aol.com/our-values/corporate-citizenship|publisher=AOL|accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref>

== Criticism ==
{{main|Criticism of AOL}}
In its earlier incarnation as a “[[Closed platform|walled garden]]” community and service provider, AOL received criticism for its community policies, terms of service, and customer service. Prior to 2006, AOL was known for its direct mailing of CD-ROMs and 3½" floppy disks containing its software. The disks were distributed in large numbers; at one point, half of the CDs manufactured worldwide had AOL logos on them.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/27/aol-discs-90s/ | title=Comment How Much Did It Cost AOL To Send Us Those CDs In The 90s?
