'''Damascus steel''' was a type of [[steel]] used for manufacturing blades in the [[Near East]] made with [[wootz steel]] imported from [[India]].<ref name=pace/> These swords are characterized by distinctive patterns of banding and mottling reminiscent of flowing water. Such blades were reputed to be tough, resistant to shattering and capable of being honed to a sharp, resilient edge.<ref name= Figiel>{{cite book| last=Figiel |first = Leo S. |title=On Damascus Steel |publisher = Atlantis Arts Press| year= 1991|pages=10–11 |isbn= 978-0-9628711-0-8 }}</ref>

The steel is named after [[Damascus]], a city in [[Syria]]. It may either refer to swords made or sold in [[Damascus]] directly, or it may just refer to the aspect of the typical patterns, by comparison with  [[Damask]] fabrics (which are in turn named after Damascus).<ref name="Goddard">{{cite book | last = Goddard| first = Wayne| authorlink = | title =The Wonder of Knifemaking| publisher = Krause| year = 2000| location = | pages =107–120 | isbn = 978-0-87341-798-3  }}</ref><ref name =Williams>{{cite book|last=Williams |first=Alan R.| title=The knight and the blast furnace: a history of the metallurgy of armour in the Middle Ages & the early modern period Volume 12 of History of warfare |publisher = BRILL|year= 2003 |pages = 10–14|isbn =978-90-04-12498-1}}</ref>

The original method of producing Damascus steel is not known. Because of differences in raw materials and manufacturing techniques, modern attempts to duplicate the metal have not been entirely successful. Despite this, several individuals in modern times have claimed that they have rediscovered the methods by which the original Damascus steel was produced.<ref name=Verhoeven>{{Cite journal | author=J.

===Loss of the technique===
Production of these patterned swords gradually declined, ceasing by around 1750, and the process was lost to metalsmiths. Several modern theories have ventured to explain this decline, including the breakdown of trade routes to supply the needed metals, the lack of trace impurities in the metals, the possible loss of knowledge on the crafting techniques through secrecy and lack of transmission, suppression of the industry in India by the British Raj,<ref>Burton, Sir Richard Francis (1884). The Book of the Sword. Internet archive: Chatto and Windus. p. 111. ISBN 1605204366.</ref> or a combination of all the above.<ref name=Verhoeven /><ref name=WS /><ref name="Lionel Milgrom 2009">{{cite web| author = Lionel Milgrom |title = Carbon nanotubes: Saladin's secret weapon|url = http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/News/2006/November/15110602.asp|year = 2009}}</ref>

The original Damascus steel or [[wootz steel|wootz]] was imported from India to Damascus, where bladesmiths learned how to forge them into swords.<ref name=Verhoeven/><ref name=WS /> Due to the distance of trade for this steel, a sufficiently lengthy disruption of the trade routes could have ended the production of Damascus steel and eventually led to the loss of the technique in India. As well, the need for key trace impurities of [[tungsten]] or [[vanadium]] within the materials needed for production of the steel may be absent if this material was acquired from different production regions or smelted from ores lacking these key trace elements.<ref name=Verhoeven/> The technique for controlled thermal cycling after the initial forging at a specific temperature could also have been lost, thereby preventing the final damask pattern in the steel from occurring.<ref name=Verhoeven/><ref name=WS />

The discovery of [[carbon nanotubes]] in the Damascus steel's composition supports this hypothesis, since the precipitation of carbon nanotubes probably resulted from a specific process that may be difficult to replicate should the production technique or raw materials used be significantly altered.<ref name="Lionel Milgrom 2009"/>

Recreating Damascus steel is a subfield of [[experimental archaeology]]. Many have attempted to discover or [[Reverse engineering|reverse-engineer]] the process by which it was made.

=== Moran: billet welding ===
[[File:DamaszenerKlinge.JPG|thumb|upright|Characteristic "organic" pattern of Damascus steel]]
Since the well-known technique of [[pattern welding]] produced surface patterns similar to those found on Damascus blades, some blacksmiths were erroneously led to believe that Damascus blades were made using this technique, but today, the difference between wootz steel and pattern welding is fully documented and well understood. Pattern-welded steel has been referred to as "Damascus steel" since 1973 when [[Bladesmith]] [[William F. Moran]] unveiled his "Damascus knives" at the [[Knifemakers' Guild]] Show.<ref name="GD">{{cite book | last = Lewis| first = Jack| authorlink = Jack Lewis (screenwriter)|author2=Roger Combs| title =Gun digest book of knives| publisher = DBI| year = 1992| location = | pages = 58–64 | isbn = 978-0-87349-129-7}}</ref><ref name=taotk>{{cite book | last = Kertzman | first =Joe  |title = Art of the Knife | publisher = Krause Publications | year =2007  | pages=224–226| isbn =978-0-89689-470-9  }}</ref>  This "Modern Damascus" is made from several types of steel and iron slices welded together to form a billet, and currently the term "damascus" (although technically incorrect) is widely accepted to describe modern pattern welded steel blades in the trade .<ref>{{cite book |last=Loveless|first=Robert|authorlink=Bob Loveless |author2=Richard Barney |title=How to Make Knives  |origyear=1977 |year=1995 |publisher=Knife World Publications |page = 169|isbn=0-695-80913-X }}</ref> The patterns vary depending on how the smith works the billet.<ref name=taotk/> The billet is drawn out and folded until the desired number of layers are formed.<ref name=taotk/>  In order to attain a Master Smith rating with the [[American Bladesmith Society]] that Moran founded, the smith must forge a damascus blade with a minimum of 300 layers.<ref>{{cite web|title=ABS Testing Rules and Guidelines for the Master Smith Rating|url=http://www.americanbladesmith.com/uploads/file/Testing/MS%20Test%20FINAL%204-24-2010.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2011-03-12}}</ref>

=== Verhoeven and Pendray: crucible ===
J. D. Verhoeven and A. H. Pendray published an article on their attempts to reproduce the elemental, structural, and visual characteristics of Damascus steel.<ref name=Verhoeven/> They started with a cake of steel that matched the properties of the original [[wootz]] steel from India, which also matched a number of original Damascus swords to which Verhoeven and Pendray had access. The wootz was in a soft, [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealed]] state, with a grain structure and beads of pure [[iron carbide]] which were the result of its [[Eutectoid|hypereutectoid]] state. Verhoeven and Pendray had already determined that the grains on the surface of the steel were grains of iron carbide—their goal was to reproduce the iron carbide patterns they saw in the Damascus blades from the grains in the wootz.

Although such material could be worked at low temperatures to produce the striated Damascene pattern of intermixed [[Ferrite (iron)|ferrite]] and [[cementite]] bands in a manner identical to pattern-welded Damascus steel, any heat treatment sufficient to dissolve the carbides would permanently destroy the pattern. However, Verhoeven and Pendray discovered that in samples of true Damascus steel, the Damascene pattern could be recovered by aging at a moderate temperature. They found that certain carbide forming elements, one of which was vanadium, did not disperse until the steel reached higher temperatures than those needed to dissolve the carbides. Therefore, a high heat treatment could remove the visual evidence of patterning associated with carbides but did not remove the underlying patterning of the carbide forming elements; a subsequent lower-temperature heat treatment, at a temperature at which the carbides were again stable, could recover the structure by the binding of carbon by those elements.

=== Anosov, Wadsworth and Sherby: bulat ===
In Russia, chronicles record the use of a material known as [[bulat steel]] to make highly valued weapons, including swords, knives and axes. Tsar [[Michael of Russia]] reportedly had a bulat helmet made for him in 1621. The exact origin or the manufacturing process of bulat is unknown, but it was likely imported to Russia via Persia and Turkestan, and it was similar and possibly the same as damascus steel. Pavel Petrovich Anosov made several attempts to reproduce the process in the mid-19th century.  Wadsworth and Sherby also researched <ref name=WS>{{cite journal|author=Jeffrey Wadsworth and Oleg D. Sherby|title= On the Bulat – Damascus Steel Revisited|journal =Prog. Mater.
