'''Dieting''' is the practice of [[eating]] food in a regulated and supervised fashion to decrease, maintain, or increase body weight. Dieting is often used in combination with [[physical exercise]] to [[weight loss|lose weight]], commonly in those who are [[overweight]] or [[obese]].  Some people, however, follow a diet to gain weight (usually in the form of [[skeletal muscle|muscle]]). Diets can also be used to maintain a stable body weight.

Diets to promote [[weight loss]] are generally divided into four categories: [[low-fat diet|low-fat]], [[low-carbohydrate diet|low-carbohydrate]], [[calorie restriction|low-calorie]], and [[very low calorie diet|very low calorie]].<ref name=Strychar>{{cite journal |author=Strychar I |title=Diet in the management of weight loss |journal=CMAJ |volume=174 |issue=1 |pages=56–63 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16389240 |pmc=1319349 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.045037 |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/174/1/56}}</ref> A [[meta-analysis]] of six randomized controlled trials found no difference between the main diet types (low calorie, low carbohydrate, and low fat), with a 2–4 kilogram weight loss in all studies.<ref name=Strychar/>  At two years, all calorie-reduced diet types cause equal weight loss irrespective of the macronutrients emphasized.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sacks FM, Bray GA, Carey VJ |title=Comparison of Weight-Loss Diets with Different Compositions of Fat, Protein, and Carbohydrates |journal=N.

==History==
[[File:William Banting.png|thumb|[[William Banting]], popularized one of the first weight loss diets in the 19th century.]]
One of the first [[dietitian]]s was the English doctor [[George Cheyne (physician)|George Cheyne]]. He himself was tremendously overweight and would constantly eat large quantities of rich food and drink. He began a meatless diet, taking only milk and vegetables, and soon regained his health. He began publicly recommending his diet for everyone suffering from obesity. In 1724, he wrote ''An Essay of Health and Long Life'', in which he advises exercise and fresh air and avoiding luxury foods.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ivu.org/history/williams/cheyne.html|title=The Ethics of Diet - A Catena|accessdate=17 December 2012}}</ref>

The Scottish military surgeon, [[John Rollo]], published ''Notes of a Diabetic Case'' in 1797. It described the benefits of a meat diet for those suffering from [[diabetes]], basing this recommendation on [[Matthew Dobson (physician)|Matthew Dobson]]'s discovery of [[glycosuria]] in [[diabetes mellitus]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Elliott Proctor Joslin|title=Joslin's Diabetes Mellitus: Edited by C.

The first popular diet was "Banting", named after the English [[undertaker]] [[William Banting]]. In 1863, he wrote a booklet called ''Letter on Corpulence, Addressed to the Public'', which contained the particular plan for the diet he had successfully followed. His own diet was four meals per day, consisting of meat, greens, fruits, and dry wine. The emphasis was on avoiding sugar, sweet foods, starch, beer, milk and butter. Banting’s pamphlet was popular for years to come, and would be used as a model for modern diets.<ref name=Britannica>{{cite encyclopedia

The first weight-loss book to promote calorie counting, and the first weight-loss book to become a bestseller, was the 1918 ''Diet and Health:  With Key to the Calories'' by American physician and columnist [[Lulu Hunt Peters]].<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Kawash|first1 = Samira|title = Candy: A Century of Panic and Pleasure|date = 2013|publisher = Faber & Faber, Incorporated|location = New York|isbn = 9780865477568|pages = 185–189}}</ref>

The [[Atkins Diet]] was suggested by the American [[nutrition]]ist [[Robert Atkins (nutritionist)|Robert Atkins]] in 1958, in a research paper titled "Weight Reduction". Atkins used the study to resolve his own [[overweight]] condition and went on to popularize the method in a series of books, starting with ''Dr. Atkins' Diet Revolution'' in 1972. In his second book, ''Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution'' (1992), he modified parts of the diet but did not alter the original concepts.

==Types of diets==

===Low-fat diets===
{{Main|Low-fat diet}}
Low-fat diets involve the reduction of the percentage of fat in one's diet. Calorie consumption is reduced because less fat is consumed. Diets of this type include NCEP Step I and II. A meta-analysis of 16 trials of 2–12&nbsp;months' duration found that low-fat diets (without intentional restriction of caloric intake) resulted in average weight loss of 3.2&nbsp;kg (7.1&nbsp;lb) over habitual eating.<ref name=Strychar/>

===Low-carbohydrate diets===
{{Main|Low-carbohydrate diet}}
Low-carbohydrate diets such as [[Atkins diet|Atkins]] and Protein Power are relatively high in protein and fats. Low-carbohydrate diets are sometimes ''[[ketogenic diet|ketogenic]]'' (i.e., they restrict carbohydrate intake sufficiently to cause [[ketosis]]).

===Low-calorie diets===
{{Main|Calorie restriction}}
Low-calorie diets usually produce an energy deficit of 500–1,000 calories per day, which can result in a 0.5&nbsp;kilogram (1.1&nbsp;lb) to 1&nbsp;kilogram (2.2&nbsp;lb) weight loss per week. Some of the most commonly used low-calorie diets include [[DASH diet]] and [[Weight Watchers]]. The National Institutes of Health reviewed 34 [[randomized controlled trial]]s to determine the effectiveness of low-calorie diets. They found that these diets lowered total body mass by 8% in the short term, over 3–12 months.<ref name=Strychar/>

===Very low-calorie diets===
{{Main|Very low calorie diet}}
Very low calorie diets provide 200–800 calories per day, maintaining protein intake but limiting calories from both fat and carbohydrates. They subject the body to [[starvation]] and produce an average loss of 1.5–2.5&nbsp;kilograms (3.3–5.5&nbsp;lb) per week. "2-4-6-8", a popular diet of this variety, follows a four-day cycle in which only 200 calories are consumed the first day, 400 the second day, 600 the third day, 800 the fourth day, and then totally [[fasting]], after which the cycle repeats.  These diets are not recommended for general use as they are associated with [[Adverse effect (medicine)|adverse side effect]]s such as loss of lean muscle mass, increased risks of [[gout]], and [[electrolyte imbalance]]s. People attempting these diets must be monitored closely by a physician to prevent complications.<ref name=Strychar/>

===Detox diets===
{{Main|Detox diet}}
Detox diets claim to eliminate undesirable "toxins" from the human body rather than claiming to cause weight loss. Many of these use [[herbs]] or [[celery]] and other juicy low-[[calorie]] [[vegetable]]s.

===Religious diets===
Religious scripture may be a factor in motivating people to adopt a specific diet.<ref name=White>{{cite book|last=White|first=Ellen G|title=Counsels on Diet and Foods|year=1938|publisher=ePub|url=http://files.meetup.com/3500282/Counsel%20on%20Diet%20and%20Foods.pdf}}</ref>  For example, the [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Book of Daniel]] (1:2-20, and 10:2-3) refers to a 10- or 21-day avoidance of foods ([[Daniel Fast]]) declared unclean by God in the laws of Moses.<ref name=White /><ref name=Bloomer>{{cite journal|last=Bloomer|first=Richard J|author2=Mohammad M Kabir |author3=Robert E Canale |author4=John F Trepanowski |author5=Kate E Marshall |author6=Tyler M Farney |author7=Kelley G Hammond |title=Effect of a 21 day Daniel Fast on metabolic and cardiovascular disease risk factors in men and women|journal=Lipids in Health and Disease|volume=9|pages=94|year=2010|doi=10.1186/1476-511X-9-94|pmid=20815907|pmc=2941756|url=http://www.lipidworld.com/content/pdf/1476-511X-9-94.pdf}}</ref>  In modern versions of the Daniel Fast, food choices may be limited to whole grains, fruits, vegetables, pulses, nuts, seeds and oil. The Daniel Fast resembles the vegan diet in that it excludes (fasts from) the consumption of foods of animal origin.<ref name=Bloomer />  The passages strongly suggest that the Daniel Fast will promote good health and mental performance.<ref name=White />

==Nutrition==
Weight loss diets that manipulate the proportion of macronutrients (low-fat, low-carbohydrate, etc.) have been shown to be more effective than diets that maintain a typical mix of foods with smaller portions and perhaps some substitutions (e.g. low-fat milk, or less salad dressing).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20030201/cochrane.html|title=Cochrane for Clinicians: Are Low-Fat Diets Better than Other Weight-Reducing Diets in Achieving Long-Term Weight Loss? - American Family Physician|publisher=}}</ref> Extreme diets may, in some cases, lead to malnutrition.

Nutritionists also agree on the importance of avoiding fats, especially saturated fats, to reduce weight and to be healthier. They also agree on the importance of reducing [[salt]] intake because foods including [[snacks]], [[biscuits]], and [[bread]] already contain ocean-salt, contributing to an excess of salt daily intake.<ref name="E">{{cite web|url=http://studentaffairs.case.edu/health/medical/nutrition.html |title=Why is Proper Nutrition Important?|accessdate=26 July 2010}}</ref>

MyPyramid Food Guidance System is the result of extensive research performed by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] to revise the original [[Food Guide Pyramid]]. It offers a wide array of personalized options to help individuals make healthy food choices. It also provides advice on physical activity.<ref name="F">{{cite web|url=http://www.mypyramid.gov/guidelines/index.html |title=Dietary Guidelines |accessdate=26 July 2010}}</ref>

One of the most important things to take into consideration when either trying to lose or put on weight is output versus input. It is important to know the amount of energy your body is using every day, so that your intake fits the needs of ones personal weight goal. Someone wanting to lose weight would want a smaller energy intake than what they put out.There is no specific diet everyone should be on, because everyones bodies vary, as do their intake requirements. A more active person will burn more energy and in return need a higher intake.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Slater Gary, Phillips Stuart M | year = 2011 | title = Nutrition guidelines for strength sports: Sprinting, weightlifting, throwing events, and bodybuilding | url = | journal = Journal Of Sports Sciences | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = S67–S77 | doi=10.1080/02640414.2011.574722}}</ref>

==How the body eliminates fat==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}When the body is expending more energy than it is consuming (e.g. when exercising), the body's cells rely on internally stored energy sources, such as complex carbohydrates and fats, for energy. The first source to which the body turns is [[glycogen]] (by [[glycogenolysis]]). Glycogen is a complex carbohydrate, 65% of which is stored in skeletal muscles and the remainder in the liver (totaling about 2,000 kcal in the whole body). It is created from the excess of ingested [[nutrients|macronutrients]], mainly carbohydrates. When glycogen is nearly depleted, the body begins [[lipolysis]], the mobilization and catabolism of fat stores for energy. In this process, fats, obtained from adipose tissue, or [[fat cells]], are broken down into [[glycerol]] and [[fatty acids]], which can be used to generate energy. The primary by-products of metabolism are carbon dioxide and water; carbon dioxide is expelled through the respiratory system.

==Weight loss groups==
Some weight loss groups aim to make money, others work as charities. The former include [[Weight Watchers]] and [[Peertrainer]]. The latter include [[Overeaters Anonymous]] and groups run by local organizations.

These organizations' customs and practices differ widely. Some groups are modelled on [[twelve-step program]]s, while others are quite informal. Some groups advocate certain prepared foods or special menus, while others train dieters to make healthy choices from restaurant menus and while grocery-shopping and cooking.

==Food diary==
A 2008 study published in the [[American Journal of Preventive Medicine]] showed that dieters who kept a daily food [[Personal journal|diary]] (or diet journal), lost twice as much weight as those who did not keep a food log, suggesting that if you record your eating, you wouldn't eat as many calories.<ref>{{cite news| title= Using food diaries doubles weight loss, study shows | url= http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/weightloss/2008-07-08-food-diaries%5FN.htm | date= 8 July 2008 | work=USA Today | first=Nanci | last=Hellmich | accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref>

==Medications==
The most recent prescription weight loss medication released is Acomplia (generic name Rimonabant), manufactured by Sanofi Aventis. Used to treat obesity in persons with a BMI ([[body mass index]]) of 30 or above, as well as for smoking cessation treatments, Acomplia is still pending FDA approval for use in the United States. Other weight loss medications, like [[amphetamine]], are addictive and consequently are now banned in the US for casual weight loss. Some supplements, including those containing [[vitamin]]s and [[dietary mineral|minerals]], may not be effective for weight loss.

===Diuretics===
[[Diuretic]]s induce weight loss through the excretion of water. Diuretics, which can be used in the forms of medications, supplements, or [[herb]]s, reduce overall body weight, but have no effect on an individual's total [[body fat]] content.  Diuretics can thicken the blood, cause cramping, kidney and liver damage. In a single report, the death of Jacqueline Henson was found to be related to swelling in her brain, which was associated with excessive water consumption over a short period of time, while she was on a special water diet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoniac.com/health-fitness/woman-dies-because-of-water-diet.html|title=Woman Dies Because Of Water Diet|publisher=}}</ref>

==Possible weight loss effects of drinking water prior to meals==
{{Main | Weight loss effects of water}}
A 2009 review found that existing limited evidence suggests that encouraging water consumption and substituting energy-free beverages for energy-containing beverages may facilitate weight management. A 2009 article found that drinking 500 ml of water prior to meals for a 12-week period resulted in increased long-term weight reduction. (References given in [[Weight loss effects of water|main article]].)

==Fasting==
{{Main|Fasting}}
Lengthy fasting can be dangerous due to the risk of [[malnutrition]] and should be carried out under medical supervision. During prolonged fasting or [[very low calorie diet]]s, the reduction of blood glucose, the preferred energy source of the [[Human brain|brain]], causes the body to deplete its glycogen stores. Once glycogen is depleted the body begins to fuel the brain using ketones, while also metabolizing body protein (including but not limited to skeletal muscle) to be used to synthesize sugars for use as energy by the rest of the body. Most experts believe that a prolonged fast can lead to muscle wasting although some dispute this. The use of short-term fasting, or various forms of [[intermittent fasting]] have been used as a form of dieting to circumvent this issue.

Fasting may refer to the avoidance of specific foods.  For example, the modern [[Daniel Fast]] resembles the [[vegan]] diet because it fasts from foods of animal origin.  Meat, dairy, eggs, and fish are replaced by whole grains, fruits, vegetables, pulses, nuts, seeds and oil.<ref name=Bloomer>{{cite journal|last=Bloomer|first=Richard J|author2=Mohammad M Kabir |author3=Robert E Canale |author4=John F Trepanowski |author5=Kate E Marshall |author6=Tyler M Farney |author7=Kelley G Hammond |title=Effect of a 21 day Daniel Fast on metabolic and cardiovascular disease risk factors in men and women|journal=Lipids in Health and Disease|volume=9|pages=94|year=2010|doi=10.1186/1476-511X-9-94|pmid=20815907|pmc=2941756|url=http://www.lipidworld.com/content/pdf/1476-511X-9-94.pdf}}</ref>

==Side effects==
While there are studies that show the health and medical benefits of weight loss, a study in 2005 of around 3000 Finns over an 18-year period showed that weight loss from dieting can result in increased mortality, while those who maintained their weight fared the best.<ref name="weight science" /><ref name="nature2007" /><ref>{{cite journal |author= Sørensen TI, Rissanen A, Korkeila M, Kaprio J |title= Intention to Lose Weight, Weight Changes, and 18-y Mortality in Overweight Individuals without Co-Morbidities |journal= PLoS Medicine |year=2005 |volume=2|issue=6; e171|pmc=1160579 |pmid=15971946 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020171 |pages=e171|last2= Rissanen |last3= Korkeila |last4= Kaprio }}</ref> Similar conclusion is drawn by other studies,<ref name="weight science">{{cite journal |title= Weight science: evaluating the evidence for a paradigm shift |author= Bacon L, Aphramor L. |journal=Nutr J |year=2011 |volume=10:9|pmc=3041737 |pmid=21261939 |doi=10.1186/1475-2891-10-9 |pages=9|last2= Aphramor }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Ingram DD, Mussolino ME. |title=Weight loss from maximum body weight and mortality: the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Linked Mortality File |journal=Int J Obes |year=2010|volume=34|pages=1044–1050.|pmid=  20212495 |doi=10.1038/ijo.2010.41 |issue=6|last2=Mussolino }}</ref> and although other studies suggest that intentional weight loss has a small benefit for individuals classified as unhealthy, it is associated with slightly increased mortality for healthy individuals and the slightly overweight but not obese.<ref name="harrington">{{cite journal |author= Harrington M, Gibson S, Cottrell RC |title= A review and meta-analysis of the effect of weight loss on all-cause mortality risk |journal=Nutr Res Rev. |year=2009 |volume=22|issue=1|pages=93–108 |pmid=19555520 |doi=10.1017/S0954422409990035|last2= Gibson |last3= Cottrell }}</ref> This may reflect the loss of subcutaneous fat and beneficial mass from organs and muscle in addition to [[visceral fat]] when there is a sudden and dramatic weight loss.<ref name="nature2007">{{cite journal |url=|title=The Two Faces of Fat|author=Kendall Powell|journal=Nature|volume=447|issue=7144|pages=525–7|date=31 May 2007|pmid=17538594|doi=10.1038/447525a}}</ref>
 
==Low carbohydrate versus low fat==
{{Main|Medical research related to low-carbohydrate diets}}
Many studies have focused on diets that reduce calories via a low-carbohydrate ([[Atkins diet]], [[Scarsdale diet]], [[Zone diet]]) diet versus a low-fat diet (LEARN diet, Ornish diet). The [[Nurses' Health Study]], an observational [[cohort study]], found that low carbohydrate diets based on vegetable sources of fat and protein are associated with less [[coronary heart disease]].<ref name="pmid17093250">{{cite journal |author=Halton TL, Willett WC, Liu S |title=Low-carbohydrate-diet score and the risk of coronary heart disease in women |journal=N.

==Low glycemic index==
"The [[glycemic index]] (GI) factor is a ranking of foods based on their overall effect on blood sugar levels. The diet based around this research is called the [[Low GI diet]]. Low glycemic index foods, such as lentils, provide a slower, more consistent source of glucose to the bloodstream, thereby stimulating less insulin release than high glycemic index foods, such as white bread."<ref name="pmid17636786">{{cite journal |last1=Thomas|first1=Diana|last2=Elliott|first2=Elizabeth J.|last3=Baur|first3=Louise|title=Low glycaemic index or low glycaemic load diets for overweight and obesity|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|volume=3|issue=3|pages=CD005105|publication-date=18 July 2007|date=31 July 2006|pmid=17636786|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005105.pub2|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.|publication-place=USA|place=University of Sydney, Children's Hospital at Westmead, CEBPGAN (Centre for Evidence Based Paediatrics Gastroenterology and Nutrition|url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD005105/pdf_fs.html|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |editor1-last=Thomas |editor1-first=Diana}}</ref><ref name="pmid6259925">{{cite journal|last1=Jenkins|first1=D.J.|last2=Wolever|first2=T.M.|last3=Taylor|first3=R.H.|last4=Barker|first4=H.|last5=Fielden|first5=H.

The glycemic load is "the mathematical product of the glycemic index and the carbohydrate amount".<ref name="pmid12949357">{{cite journal|last1=Brand-Miller|first1=Janette Cecile|last2=Thomas|first2=M.|last3=Swan|first3=V.|last4=Ahmad|first4=Z.I.|last5=Petocz|first5=P.|last6=Colagiuri|first6=S.|author1-link=Jennie Brand-Miller|title=Physiological Validation of the Concept of Glycemic Load in Lean Young Adults|journal=The Journal of Nutrition|volume=133|issue=9|pages=2728–32|publication-date=September 2003|pmid=12949357|publisher=The American Society for Nutritional Sciences|publication-place=USA|place=Human Nutrition Unit, School of Molecular and Microbial Biosciences, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia|url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/reprint/133/9/2728.pdf|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|year=2003}}</ref>

In a [[randomized controlled trial]] that compared four diets that varied in carbohydrate amount and glycemic index found complicated results:<ref name="pmid16864756">{{cite journal|last1=McMillan-Price|first1=J.|last2=Petocz|first2=P.|last3=Atkinson|first3=F.|last4=O'neill|first4=K.|last5=Samman|first5=S.|last6=Steinbeck|first6=K.|last7=Caterson|first7=I.|last8=Brand-Miller|first8=Janette Cecile|author8-link=Jennie Brand-Miller|title=Comparison of 4 Diets of Varying Glycemic Load on Weight Loss and Cardiovascular Risk Reduction in Overweight and Obese Young Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial|journal=Archives of Internal Medicine|publisher=American Medical Association|publication-place=USA|place=Human Nutrition Unit, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia|volume=166|issue=14|pages=1466–75|publication-date=24 July 2006|pmid=16864756|doi=10.1001/archinte.166.14.1466|url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/166/14/1466.pdf|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|year=2006}}</ref>
*Diet 1 and 2 were high carbohydrate (55% of total energy intake)
**Diet 1 was high-glycemic index
**Diet 2 was low-glycemic index
*Diet 3 and 4 were high protein (25% of total energy intake)
**Diet 3 was high-glycemic index
**Diet 4 was low-glycemic index

Diets 2 and 3 lost the most weight and fat mass; however, low density lipoprotein fell in Diet 2 and rose in Diet 3. Thus the authors concluded that the high-carbohydrate, low-glycemic index  diet was the most favorable.

A [[meta-analysis]] by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] concluded that low glycemic index or low glycemic load diets led to more weight loss and better lipid profiles. ''However'', the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] grouped low glycemic index and low glycemic load diets together and did not try to separate the effects of the load versus the index.<ref name="pmid17636786">{{cite journal |author=Thomas DE, Elliott E, Baur L |title=Low glycaemic index or low glycaemic load diets for overweight and obesity |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |volume= |issue=3 |pages=CD005105 |year=2007 |pmid=17636786 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005105.pub2 |editor1-last=Thomas |editor1-first=Diana}}</ref>
