The '''Commodore 1570''' is a 5Â¼" [[floppy disk]] drive for the [[Commodore 128]] [[home computer|home]]/[[personal computer]]. It is a single-sided, 170-KB version of the [[Commodore 1571]], released as a stopgap measure when [[Commodore International]] was unable to provide large enough quantities of 1571s due to a shortage of double-sided drive mechanisms (supplied from an outside manufacturer). Like the 1571, it can read and write both [[Group Code Recording|GCR]] and [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]] disk formats.
The 1570 utilizes a 1571 logic board in a cream-colored [[Commodore 1541|original-1541]]-like case with a drive mechanism similar to the 1541's except that it was equipped with track-zero detection. Like the 1571, its built-in DOS provides a data burst mode for transferring data to the C128 computer at a faster speed than a 1541 can. Its [[Read-only memory|ROM]] also contains some DOS bug fixes that didn't appear in the 1571 until much later. The 1570 can read and write all single-sided [[CP/M operating system|CP/M]]-format disks that the 1571 can access.

Although the 1570 is compatible with the [[Commodore 64]], the C64 isn't capable of taking advantage of the drive's higher-speed operation, and when used with the C64 it's little more than a pricier 1541. Also, many early buyers of the C128 chose to temporarily make do with a 1541 drive, perhaps owned as part of a previous C64 setup, until the 1571 became more widely available.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}
