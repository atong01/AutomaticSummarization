Like the 1571, its built-in DOS provides a data burst mode for transferring data to the C128 computer at a faster speed than a 1541 can. Its<space/><link><target>Read-only memory</target><part>ROM</part></link><space/>also contains some DOS bug fixes that didn't appear in the 1571 until much later.

Also, many early buyers of the C128 chose to temporarily make do with a 1541 drive, perhaps owned as part of a previous C64 setup, until the 1571 became more widely available.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">November 2014</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>Commodore disk drives</target></template></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Category:Commodore 64</target></link></paragraph></article>
