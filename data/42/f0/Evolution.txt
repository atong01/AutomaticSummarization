In the mid-19th century, [[Charles Darwin]] formulated the [[scientific theory]] of evolution by [[natural selection]], published in his book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859). Evolution by natural selection is a process demonstrated by the observation that more offspring are produced than can possibly survive, along with three [[fact]]s about populations: 1) traits vary among individuals with respect to morphology, physiology, and behaviour ([[phenotypic variation]]), 2) different traits confer different rates of survival and reproduction (differential [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]), and 3) traits can be passed from generation to generation ([[heritability]] of fitness).<ref name="Lewontin70">{{cite journal |last=Lewontin |first=R.

In the early 20th century the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]] integrated [[classical genetics]] with Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection through the discipline of [[population genetics]]. The importance of natural selection as a cause of evolution was accepted into other branches of [[biology]]. Moreover, previously held notions about evolution, such as [[orthogenesis]], [[evolutionism]], and other beliefs about innate "progress" within the [[largest-scale trends in evolution]], became [[Superseded scientific theories|obsolete scientific theories]].<ref>{{harvnb|Provine|1988|pp=49–79}}</ref> Scientists continue to study various aspects of [[evolutionary biology]] by forming and testing hypotheses, constructing [[Mathematical and theoretical biology|mathematical models of theoretical biology]] and biological theories, using [[observational study|observational data]], and performing [[experiment]]s in both the [[habitat|field]] and the laboratory. Evolution is a cornerstone of modern science, accepted as one of the most reliably established of all facts and theories of science, based on evidence not just from the biological sciences but also from anthropology, psychology, astrophysics, chemistry, geology, physics, mathematics, and other scientific disciplines, as well as behavioral and social sciences.

In the 17th century, the new [[scientific method|method]] of [[History of science#Modern science|modern science]] rejected Aristotle's approach. It sought explanations of natural phenomena in terms of [[physical law]]s that were the same for all visible things and that did not require the existence of any fixed natural categories or divine cosmic order. However, this new approach was slow to take root in the biological sciences, the last bastion of the concept of fixed natural types. [[John Ray]] applied one of the previously more general terms for fixed natural types, "species," to plant and animal types, but he strictly identified each type of living thing as a species and proposed that each species could be defined by the features that perpetuated themselves generation after generation.<ref>{{harvnb|Mayr|1982|pp=256–257}}

The crucial break from the concept of constant typological classes or types in biology came with the theory of evolution through natural selection, which was formulated by Charles Darwin in terms of variable populations. Partly influenced by ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' (1798) by [[Thomas Robert Malthus]], Darwin noted that population growth would lead to a "struggle for existence" in which favorable variations prevailed as others perished. In each generation, many offspring fail to survive to an age of reproduction because of limited resources. This could explain the diversity of plants and animals from a common ancestry through the working of natural laws in the same way for all types of organism.<ref name="Sober09">{{cite journal |last=Sober |first=Elliott |authorlink=Elliott Sober |date=June 16, 2009 |title=Did Darwin write the ''Origin'' backwards? |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|Proc.

Since then, the modern synthesis has been further extended to explain biological phenomena across the full and integrative scale of the [[Biological organisation|biological hierarchy]], from genes to species.

Evolution in organisms occurs through changes in heritable traits—the inherited characteristics of an organism. In humans, for example, [[Eye color|eye colour]] is an inherited characteristic and an individual might inherit the "brown-eye trait" from one of their parents.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sturm |first1=Richard A. |last2=Frudakis |first2=Tony N. |date=August 2004 |title=Eye colour: portals into pigmentation genes and ancestry |journal=[[Trends (journals)|Trends in Genetics]] |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=[[Cell Press]] |volume=20 |issue=8 |pages=327–332 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2004.06.010 |issn=0168-9525 |pmid=15262401}}</ref> Inherited traits are controlled by genes and the complete set of genes within an organism's [[genome]] (genetic material) is called its genotype.<ref name="Pearson_2006">{{cite journal |last=Pearson |first=Helen |date=May 25, 2006 |title=Genetics: What is a gene? |journal=Nature |location=London |publisher=Nature Publishing Group |volume=441 |issue=7092 |pages=398–401 |bibcode=2006Natur.441..398P |doi=10.1038/441398a |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=16724031}}</ref>

The complete set of observable traits that make up the structure and behaviour of an organism is called its phenotype. These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Visscher |first1=Peter M. |last2=Hill |first2=William G. |authorlink2=William G.

For example, [[sun tanning|suntanned]] skin comes from the interaction between a person's genotype and sunlight; thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children. However, some people tan more easily than others, due to differences in genotypic variation; a striking example are people with the inherited trait of [[albinism]], who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to [[sunburn]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Oetting |first1=William S. |last2=Brilliant |first2=Murray H. |last3=King |first3=Richard A. |date=August 1996 |title=The clinical spectrum of albinism in humans |journal=[[Trends (journals)|Molecular Medicine Today]] |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=Cell Press |volume=2 |issue=8 |pages=330–335 |doi=10.1016/1357-4310(96)81798-9 |issn=1357-4310 |pmid=8796918}}</ref>

Heritable traits are passed from one generation to the next via DNA, a [[molecule]] that encodes genetic information.<ref name="Pearson_2006" /> DNA is a long [[biopolymer]] composed of four types of bases. The sequence of bases along a particular DNA molecule specify the genetic information, in a manner similar to a sequence of letters spelling out a sentence. Before a cell divides, the DNA is copied, so that each of the resulting two cells will inherit the DNA sequence. Portions of a DNA molecule that specify a single functional unit are called genes; different genes have different sequences of bases. Within cells, the long strands of DNA form condensed structures called [[chromosome]]s. The specific location of a DNA sequence within a chromosome is known as a [[locus (genetics)|locus]]. If the DNA sequence at a locus varies between individuals, the different forms of this sequence are called [[allele]]s. DNA sequences can change through mutations, producing new alleles. If a mutation occurs within a gene, the new allele may affect the trait that the gene controls, altering the phenotype of the organism.<ref name="Futuyma_2005">{{harvnb|Futuyma|2005}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}</ref> However, while this simple correspondence between an allele and a trait works in some cases, most traits are more complex and are controlled by [[quantitative trait locus|quantitative trait loci]] (multiple interacting genes).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Phillips |first=Patrick C. |date=November 2008 |title=Epistasis—the essential role of gene interactions in the structure and evolution of genetic systems |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |location=London |publisher=Nature Publishing Group |volume=9 |issue=11 |pages=855–867 |doi=10.1038/nrg2452 |issn=1471-0056 |pmc=2689140 |pmid=18852697}}</ref><ref name="Lin">{{cite journal |author1=Rongling Wu |author2=Min Lin |date=March 2006 |title=Functional mapping — how to map and study the genetic architecture of dynamic complex traits |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |location=London |publisher=Nature Publishing Group |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=229–237 |doi=10.1038/nrg1804 |issn=1471-0056 |pmid=16485021}}</ref>

{{Further|Genetic diversity|Population genetics}}
An individual organism's phenotype results from both its genotype and the influence from the environment it has lived in. A substantial part of the phenotypic variation in a population is caused by genotypic variation.<ref name="Lin" /> The modern evolutionary synthesis defines evolution as the change over time in this genetic variation. The frequency of one particular allele will become more or less prevalent relative to other forms of that gene. Variation disappears when a new allele reaches the point of [[fixation (population genetics)|fixation]]—when it either disappears from the population or replaces the ancestral allele entirely.<ref name="Amos">{{cite journal |last1=Amos |first1=William |authorlink1=William Bradshaw Amos |last2=Harwood |first2=John |date=February 28, 1998 |title=Factors affecting levels of genetic diversity in natural populations |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B|Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences]] |location=London |publisher=[[Royal Society]] |volume=353 |issue=1366 |pages=177–186 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1998.0200 |issn=0962-8436 |pmc=1692205 |pmid=9533122}}</ref>

Natural selection will only cause evolution if there is enough [[genetic variation]] in a population. Before the discovery of Mendelian genetics, one common hypothesis was [[blending inheritance]]. But with blending inheritance, genetic variance would be rapidly lost, making evolution by natural selection implausible. The [[Hardy–Weinberg principle]] provides the solution to how variation is maintained in a population with Mendelian inheritance. The frequencies of alleles (variations in a gene) will remain constant in the absence of selection, mutation, migration and genetic drift.<ref name="Ewens W.J. 2004">{{harvnb|Ewens|2004}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}</ref>

Variation comes from mutations in the genome, reshuffling of genes through [[sexual reproduction]] and migration between populations ([[gene flow]]). Despite the constant introduction of new variation through mutation and gene flow, most of the genome of a species is identical in all individuals of that species.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Butlin |first1=Roger K. |last2=Tregenza |first2=Tom |date=February 28, 1998 |title=Levels of genetic polymorphism: marker loci versus quantitative traits |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |location=London |publisher=Royal Society |volume=353 |issue=1366 |pages=187–198 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1998.0201 |issn=0962-8436 |pmc=1692210 |pmid=9533123}}

=== Mutation ===
{{Main|Mutation}}
[[File:Gene-duplication.svg|thumb|100px|Duplication of part of a [[chromosome]]]]
Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence of a cell's genome. When mutations occur, they may alter the [[gene product|product of a gene]], or prevent the gene from functioning, or have no effect. Based on studies in the fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', it has been suggested that if a mutation changes a protein produced by a gene, this will probably be harmful, with about 70% of these mutations having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sawyer |first1=Stanley A. |last2=Parsch |first2=John |author3=Zhang Zhi |last4=Hartl |first4=Daniel L. |date=Apr 17, 2007 |title=Prevalence of positive selection among nearly neutral amino acid replacements in ''Drosophila'' |journal=Proc.

=== Sex and recombination ===
{{Further|Sexual reproduction|Genetic recombination|Evolution of sexual reproduction}}

In [[Asexual reproduction|asexual]] organisms, genes are inherited together, or ''linked'', as they cannot mix with genes of other organisms during reproduction. In contrast, the offspring of [[sex]]ual organisms contain random mixtures of their parents' chromosomes that are produced through independent assortment.

== Mechanisms ==
[[File:Mutation and selection diagram.svg|thumb|300px|[[Mutation]] followed by [[natural selection]], results in a population with darker colouration.]]
From a [[Neo-Darwinism|Neo-Darwinian]] perspective, evolution occurs when there are changes in the frequencies of alleles within a population of interbreeding organisms.<ref name="Ewens W.J. 2004" /> For example, the allele for black colour in a population of moths becoming more common. Mechanisms that can lead to changes in allele frequencies include natural selection, genetic drift, [[genetic hitchhiking]], mutation and gene flow.

=== Natural selection ===
{{Further|Natural selection|Fitness (biology)}}
Evolution by means of natural selection is the process by which traits that enhance survival and reproduction become more common in successive generations of a population. It has often been called a "self-evident" mechanism because it necessarily follows from three simple facts:<ref name="Lewontin70" />
* Variation exists within populations of organisms with respect to morphology, physiology, and behaviour (phenotypic variation).
* Different traits confer different rates of survival and reproduction (differential fitness).
* These traits can be passed from generation to generation (heritability of fitness).

More offspring are produced than can possibly survive, and these conditions produce competition between organisms for survival and reproduction. Consequently, organisms with traits that give them an advantage over their competitors are more likely to pass on their traits to the next generation than those with traits that do not confer an advantage.<ref name="Hurst">{{cite journal |last=Hurst |first=Laurence D. |authorlink=Laurence Hurst |title=Fundamental concepts in genetics: genetics and the understanding of selection |date=February 2009 |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |location=London |publisher=Nature Publishing Group |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=83–93 |doi=10.1038/nrg2506 |issn=1471-0056 |pmid=19119264}}</ref>

The central concept of natural selection is the [[fitness (biology)|evolutionary fitness]] of an organism.<ref name="Orr">{{cite journal |last=Orr |first=H. Allen |authorlink=H. Allen Orr |date=August 2009 |title=Fitness and its role in evolutionary genetics |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |location=London |publisher=Nature Publishing Group |volume=10 |issue=8 |pages=531–539 |doi=10.1038/nrg2603 |pmc=2753274 |pmid=19546856 |issn=1471-0056}}</ref> Fitness is measured by an organism's ability to survive and reproduce, which determines the size of its genetic contribution to the next generation.<ref name="Orr" /> However, fitness is not the same as the total number of offspring: instead fitness is indicated by the proportion of subsequent generations that carry an organism's genes.<ref name="Haldane">{{cite journal |last=Haldane |first=J. B. S. |authorlink=J. B. S. Haldane |date=March 14, 1959 |title=The Theory of Natural Selection To-Day |journal=Nature |location=London |publisher=Nature Publishing Group |volume=183 |issue=4663 |pages=710–713 |bibcode=1959Natur.183..710H |doi=10.1038/183710a0 |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=13644170}}</ref> For example, if an organism could survive well and reproduce rapidly, but its offspring were all too small and weak to survive, this organism would make little genetic contribution to future generations and would thus have low fitness.<ref name="Orr" />

If an allele increases fitness more than the other alleles of that gene, then with each generation this allele will become more common within the population. These traits are said to be "selected ''for''." Examples of traits that can increase fitness are enhanced survival and increased [[fecundity]]. Conversely, the lower fitness caused by having a less beneficial or deleterious allele results in this allele becoming rarer—they are "selected ''against''."<ref name="Lande">{{cite journal |last1=Lande |first1=Russell |authorlink1=Russell Lande |last2=Arnold |first2=Stevan J. |date=November 1983 |title=The Measurement of Selection on Correlated Characters |journal=Evolution |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=John Wiley & Sons on behalf of the Society for the Study of Evolution |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=1210–1226 |doi=10.2307/2408842 |issn=0014-3820 |jstor=2408842}}</ref> Importantly, the fitness of an allele is not a fixed characteristic; if the environment changes, previously neutral or harmful traits may become beneficial and previously beneficial traits become harmful.<ref name="Futuyma_2005" /> However, even if the direction of selection does reverse in this way, traits that were lost in the past may not re-evolve in an identical form (see [[Dollo's law of irreversibility|Dollo's law]]).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Goldberg |first1=Emma E. |last2=Igić |first2=Boris |date=November 2008 |title=On phylogenetic tests of irreversible evolution |journal=Evolution |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=John Wiley & Sons on behalf of the Society for the Study of Evolution |volume=62 |issue=11 |pages=2727–2741 |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00505.x |issn=0014-3820 |pmid=18764918}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Collin |first1=Rachel |last2=Miglietta |first2=Maria Pia |date=November 2008 |title=Reversing opinions on Dollo's Law |journal=[[Trends (journals)|Trends in Ecology & Evolution]] |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=Cell Press |volume=23 |issue=11 |pages=602–609 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2008.06.013 |issn=0169-5347 |pmid=18814933}}</ref>

[[File:Selection Types Chart.png|thumb|left|A chart showing three types of selection.
1. [[Disruptive selection]]
2. [[Stabilising selection]]
3. [[Directional selection]]]]

Natural selection within a population for a trait that can vary across a range of values, such as height, can be categorised into three different types. The first is [[directional selection]], which is a shift in the average value of a trait over time—for example, organisms slowly getting taller.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hoekstra |first1=Hopi E. |last2=Hoekstra |first2=Jonathan M. |last3=Berrigan |first3=David |last4=Vignieri |first4=Sacha N. |last5=Hoang |first5=Amy |last6=Hill |first6=Caryl E. |last7=Beerli |first7=Peter |last8=Kingsolver |first8=Joel G. |date=July 31, 2001 |title=Strength and tempo of directional selection in the wild |journal=Proc.

This would be when either short or tall organisms had an advantage, but not those of medium height. Finally, in [[stabilising selection]] there is selection against extreme trait values on both ends, which causes a decrease in [[variance]] around the average value and less diversity.<ref name="Hurst" /><ref>{{cite journal |last=Felsenstein |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Felsenstein |date=November 1979 |title=Excursions along the Interface between Disruptive and Stabilizing Selection |journal=[[Genetics (journal)|Genetics]] |location=Bethesda, MD |publisher=[[Genetics Society of America]] |volume=93 |issue=3 |pages=773–795 |issn=0016-6731 |pmc=1214112 |pmid=17248980}}</ref> This would, for example, cause organisms to slowly become all the same height.

Natural selection most generally makes nature the measure against which individuals and individual traits, are more or less likely to survive. "Nature" in this sense refers to an [[ecosystem]], that is, a system in which organisms interact with every other element, [[Abiotic component|physical]] as well as [[Biotic component|biological]], in their local environment. [[Eugene Odum]], a founder of ecology, defined an ecosystem as: "Any unit that includes all of the organisms...in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity and material cycles (ie: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system."<ref name="Odum1971">{{harvnb|Odum|1971|p=8}}</ref> Each population within an ecosystem occupies a distinct [[Ecological niche|niche]], or position, with distinct relationships to other parts of the system. These relationships involve the life history of the organism, its position in the [[food chain]] and its geographic range. This broad understanding of nature enables scientists to delineate specific forces which, together, comprise natural selection.

=== Genetic hitchhiking ===
{{Further|Genetic hitchhiking|Hill–Robertson effect|Selective sweep}}

Recombination allows alleles on the same strand of DNA to become separated. However, the rate of recombination is low (approximately two events per chromosome per generation). As a result, genes close together on a chromosome may not always be shuffled away from each other and genes that are close together tend to be inherited together, a phenomenon known as [[genetic linkage|linkage]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lien |first1=Sigbjørn |last2=Szyda |first2=Joanna |last3=Schechinger |first3=Birgit |last4=Rappold |first4=Gudrun |last5=Arnheim |first5=Norm |date=February 2000 |title=Evidence for Heterogeneity in Recombination in the Human Pseudoautosomal Region: High Resolution Analysis by Sperm Typing and Radiation-Hybrid Mapping |journal=[[American Journal of Human Genetics]] |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=Cell Press on behalf of the [[American Society of Human Genetics]] |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=557–566 |doi=10.1086/302754 |issn=0002-9297 |pmc=1288109 |pmid=10677316 |display-authors=3}}</ref> This tendency is measured by finding how often two alleles occur together on a single chromosome compared to [[independence (probability theory)|expectations]], which is called their [[linkage disequilibrium]]. A set of alleles that is usually inherited in a group is called a [[haplotype]]. This can be important when one allele in a particular haplotype is strongly beneficial: natural selection can drive a [[selective sweep]] that will also cause the other alleles in the haplotype to become more common in the population; this effect is called genetic hitchhiking or genetic draft.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Barton |first=Nicholas H. |authorlink=Nick Barton |date=November 29, 2000 |title=Genetic hitchhiking |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |location=London |publisher=Royal Society |volume=355 |issue=1403 |pages=1553–1562 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2000.0716 |issn=0962-8436 |pmc=1692896 |pmid=11127900}}</ref> Genetic draft caused by the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection can be partially captured by an appropriate effective population size.<ref name="gillespie 2001" />

=== Gene flow ===
{{Further|Gene flow|Hybrid (biology)|Horizontal gene transfer}}
Gene flow involves the exchange of genes between populations and between species.<ref name="Morjan C, Rieseberg L 2004 1341–56" /> The presence or absence of gene flow fundamentally changes the course of evolution. Due to the complexity of organisms, any two completely isolated populations will eventually evolve genetic incompatibilities through neutral processes, as in the [[Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller Model|Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller model]], even if both populations remain essentially identical in terms of their adaptation to the environment.

If genetic differentiation between populations develops, gene flow between populations can introduce traits or alleles which are disadvantageous in the local population and this may lead to organisms within these populations  evolving mechanisms that prevent mating with genetically distant populations, eventually resulting in the appearance of new species. Thus, exchange of genetic information between individuals is fundamentally important for the development of the [[Species problem#Biological species concept|biological species concept]].

During the development of the modern synthesis, Sewall Wright developed his [[shifting balance theory]], which regarded gene flow between partially isolated populations as an important aspect of adaptive evolution.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wright |first=Sewall |authorlink=Sewall Wright |year=1932 |title=The roles of mutation, inbreeding, crossbreeding and selection in evolution |url=http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/wright.asp |journal=Proceedings of the VI International Congress of Genetrics |volume=1 |pages=356–366 |accessdate=2014-12-18}}</ref> However, recently there has been substantial criticism of the importance of the shifting balance theory.<ref name="Coyne 1997">{{cite journal |last1=Coyne |first1=Jerry A. |authorlink1=Jerry Coyne |last2=Barton |first2=Nicholas H. |last3=Turelli |first3=Michael |date=June 1997 |title=Perspective: A Critique of Sewall Wright's Shifting Balance Theory of Evolution |journal=Evolution |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=John Wiley & Sons on behalf of the Society for the Study of Evolution |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=643–671 |doi=10.2307/2411143 |issn=0014-3820}}</ref>

== Outcomes ==
Evolution influences every aspect of the form and behaviour of organisms. Most prominent are the specific behavioural and physical [[adaptation]]s that are the outcome of natural selection. These adaptations increase fitness by aiding activities such as finding food, avoiding [[Predation|predator]]s or attracting mates. Organisms can also respond to selection by [[Co-operation (evolution)|cooperating]] with each other, usually by aiding their relatives or engaging in mutually beneficial [[symbiosis]]. In the longer term, evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral populations of organisms into new groups that cannot or will not interbreed.

These outcomes of evolution are distinguished based on time scale as [[macroevolution]] versus microevolution. Macroevolution refers to evolution that occurs at or above the level of species, in particular speciation and extinction; whereas microevolution refers to smaller evolutionary changes within a species or population, in particular shifts in [[Allele frequency|gene frequency]] and adaptation.<ref name="ScottEC">{{cite journal |last1=Scott |first1=Eugenie C. |authorlink1=Eugenie Scott |last2=Matzke |first2=Nicholas J. |authorlink2=Nick Matzke |date=May 15, 2007 |title=Biological design in science classrooms |journal=Proc.

For instance, a large amount of variation among individuals allows a species to rapidly adapt to new [[habitat]]s, lessening the chance of it going extinct, while a wide geographic range increases the chance of speciation, by making it more likely that part of the population will become isolated. In this sense, microevolution and macroevolution might involve selection at different levels—with microevolution acting on genes and organisms, versus macroevolutionary processes such as [[Unit of selection#Species selection and selection at higher taxonomic levels|species selection]] acting on entire species and affecting their rates of speciation and extinction.{{sfn|Gould|2002|pp=657–658}}<ref name="Gould_1994">{{cite journal |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |date=July 19, 1994 |title=Tempo and mode in the macroevolutionary reconstruction of Darwinism |journal=Proc.

Adaptation is the process that makes organisms better suited to their habitat.<ref>{{harvnb|Mayr|1982|p=483}}: "Adaptation... could no longer be considered a static condition, a product of a creative past and became instead a continuing dynamic process."</ref><ref>The sixth edition of the ''Oxford Dictionary of Science'' (2010) defines ''adaptation'' as "Any change in the structure or functioning of successive generations of a population that makes it better suited to its environment."</ref> Also, the term adaptation may refer to a trait that is important for an organism's survival. For example, the adaptation of [[horse]]s' teeth to the grinding of grass. By using the term ''adaptation'' for the evolutionary process and ''adaptive trait'' for the product (the bodily part or function), the two senses of the word may be distinguished. Adaptations are produced by natural selection.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Orr |first=H.

Adaptation may cause either the gain of a new feature, or the loss of an ancestral feature. An example that shows both types of change is bacterial adaptation to antibiotic selection, with genetic changes causing antibiotic resistance by both modifying the target of the drug, or increasing the activity of transporters that pump the drug out of the cell.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nakajima |first1=Akira |last2=Sugimoto |first2=Yohko |last3=Yoneyama |first3=Hiroshi |last4=Nakae |first4=Taiji |date=June 2002 |title=High-Level Fluoroquinolone Resistance in ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' Due to Interplay of the MexAB-OprM Efflux Pump and the DNA Gyrase Mutation |journal=Microbiology and Immunology |location=Tokyo |publisher=Center for Academic Publications Japan |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=391–395 |doi=10.1111/j.1348-0421.2002.tb02711.x |issn=1348-0421 |pmid=12153116}}</ref> Other striking examples are the bacteria ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' evolving the ability to use [[citric acid]] as a nutrient in a [[E. coli long-term evolution experiment|long-term laboratory experiment]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blount |first1=Zachary D. |last2=Borland |first2=Christina Z. |last3=Lenski |first3=Richard E. |date=June 10, 2008 |title=Inaugural Article: Historical contingency and the evolution of a key innovation in an experimental population of ''Escherichia coli'' |journal=Proc.

Adaptation occurs through the gradual modification of existing structures. Consequently, structures with similar internal organisation may have different functions in related organisms. This is the result of a single [[homology (biology)|ancestral structure]] being adapted to function in different ways.

{{Further|Coevolution}}
Interactions between organisms can produce both conflict and cooperation. When the interaction is between pairs of species, such as a [[pathogen]] and a [[host (biology)|host]], or a predator and its prey, these species can develop matched sets of adaptations. Here, the evolution of one species causes adaptations in a second species. These changes in the second species then, in turn, cause new adaptations in the first species. This cycle of selection and response is called coevolution.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wade |first=Michael J. |authorlink=Michael J.

Coalitions between organisms of the same species have also evolved. An extreme case is the [[eusociality]] found in social insects, such as [[bee]]s, [[termite]]s and [[ant]]s, where sterile insects feed and guard the small number of organisms in a [[Colony (biology)|colony]] that are able to reproduce. On an even smaller scale, the somatic cells that make up the body of an animal limit their reproduction so they can maintain a stable organism, which then supports a small number of the animal's germ cells to produce offspring. Here, somatic cells respond to specific signals that instruct them whether to grow, remain as they are, or die. If cells ignore these signals and multiply inappropriately, their uncontrolled growth [[carcinogenesis|causes cancer]].<ref name="Bertram">{{cite journal |last=Bertram |first=John S. |date=December 2000 |title=The molecular biology of cancer |journal=[[Molecular Aspects of Medicine]] |location=Amsterdam, the Netherlands |publisher=Elsevier on behalf of the [[International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology]] |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=167–223 |doi=10.1016/S0098-2997(00)00007-8 |issn=0098-2997 |pmid=11173079}}</ref>

[[reproductive isolation|Barriers to reproduction]] between two diverging sexual populations are required for the populations to [[speciation|become new species]]. Gene flow may slow this process by spreading the new genetic variants also to the other populations.

The second mechanism of speciation is [[peripatric speciation]], which occurs when small populations of organisms become isolated in a new environment. This differs from allopatric speciation in that the isolated populations are numerically much smaller than the parental population. Here, the [[founder effect]] causes rapid speciation after an increase in [[inbreeding]] increases selection on homozygotes, leading to rapid genetic change.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Templeton |first=Alan R. |authorlink=Alan Templeton |date=April 1980 |title=The Theory of Speciation ''VIA'' the Founder Principle |url=http://www.genetics.org/content/94/4/1011.full.pdf+html |journal=Genetics |location=Bethesda, MD |publisher=Genetics Society of America |volume=94 |issue=4 |pages=1011–1038 |pmid=6777243 |issn=0016-6731 |pmc=1214177 |accessdate=2014-12-29}}</ref>

The third mechanism of speciation is [[parapatric speciation]]. This is similar to peripatric speciation in that a small population enters a new habitat, but differs in that there is no physical separation between these two populations. Instead, speciation results from the evolution of mechanisms that reduce gene flow between the two populations.<ref name="Gavrilets" /> Generally this occurs when there has been a drastic change in the environment within the parental species' habitat. One example is the grass ''[[Anthoxanthum|Anthoxanthum odoratum]]'', which can undergo parapatric speciation in response to localised metal pollution from mines.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Antonovics |first=Janis |authorlink=Janis Antonovics |date=July 2006 |title=Evolution in closely adjacent plant populations X: long-term persistence of prereproductive isolation at a mine boundary |url=http://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/v97/n1/full/6800835a.html |journal=[[Heredity (journal)|Heredity]] |location=London |publisher=Nature Publishing Group for [[The Genetics Society]] |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=33–37 |doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800835 |issn=0018-067X |pmid=16639420 |accessdate=2014-12-29}}</ref> Here, plants evolve that have resistance to high levels of metals in the soil. Selection against interbreeding with the metal-sensitive parental population produced a gradual change in the flowering time of the metal-resistant plants, which eventually produced complete reproductive isolation. Selection against hybrids between the two populations may cause ''reinforcement'', which is the evolution of traits that promote mating within a species, as well as [[character displacement]], which is when two species become more distinct in appearance.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nosil |first1=Patrik |last2=Crespi |first2=Bernard J. |last3=Gries |first3=Regine |last4=Gries |first4=Gerhard |date=March 2007 |title=Natural selection and divergence in mate preference during speciation |journal=Genetica |location=Dordrecht, the Netherlands |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |volume=129 |issue=3 |pages=309–327 |doi=10.1007/s10709-006-0013-6 |pmid=16900317 |issn=0016-6707}}</ref>

One type of sympatric speciation involves [[crossbreed]]ing of two related species to produce a new hybrid species. This is not common in animals as animal hybrids are usually sterile. This is because during [[meiosis]] the [[homologous chromosome]]s from each parent are from different species and cannot successfully pair. However, it is more common in plants because plants often double their number of chromosomes, to form [[polyploidy|polyploids]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wood |first1=Troy E. |last2=Takebayashi |first2=Naoki |last3=Barker |first3=Michael S. |last4=Mayrose |first4=Itay |last5=Greenspoon |first5=Philip B. |last6=Rieseberg |first6=Loren H. |date=August 18, 2009 |title=The frequency of polyploid speciation in vascular plants |journal=Proc.

Speciation events are important in the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]], which accounts for the pattern in the fossil record of short "bursts" of evolution interspersed with relatively long periods of stasis, where species remain relatively unchanged.<ref>{{harvnb|Eldredge|Gould|1972|pp=82–115}}</ref> In this theory, speciation and rapid evolution are linked, with natural selection and genetic drift acting most strongly on organisms undergoing speciation in novel habitats or small populations.

Further, as prokaryotes such as bacteria and archaea share a limited set of common morphologies, their fossils do not provide information on their ancestry.

In the 19th century, particularly after the publication of ''On the Origin of Species'' in 1859, the idea that life had evolved was an active source of academic debate centred on the philosophical, social and religious implications of evolution. Today, the modern evolutionary synthesis is accepted by a vast majority of scientists.<ref name="Kutschera" /> However, evolution remains a contentious concept for some [[Theism|theists]].<ref>For an overview of the philosophical, religious and cosmological controversies, see:

The teaching of evolution in American secondary school biology classes was uncommon in most of the first half of the 20th century. The [[Scopes Trial]] decision of 1925 caused the subject to become very rare in American secondary biology textbooks for a generation, but it was gradually re-introduced later and became legally protected with the 1968 ''[[Epperson v. Arkansas]]'' decision. Since then, the competing religious belief of creationism was legally disallowed in secondary school curricula in various decisions in the 1970s and 1980s, but it returned in [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] form as [[intelligent design]] (ID), to be excluded once again in the 2005 ''[[Kitzmiller v.
