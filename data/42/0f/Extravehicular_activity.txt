'''Extravehicular activity''' ('''EVA''') is any activity done by an [[astronaut|astronaut or cosmonaut]] outside a [[spacecraft]] beyond the [[Kármán line|Earth's appreciable atmosphere]]. The term most commonly applies to a '''spacewalk''' made outside a craft orbiting Earth (such as the [[International Space Station]]), but also has applied to [[Moon|lunar]] surface exploration (commonly known as '''moonwalks''') performed by six pairs of American astronauts in the [[Apollo program]] from 1969 to 1972. On each of the last three of these missions, astronauts also performed deep-space EVAs on the return to Earth, to retrieve film canisters from the outside of the spacecraft. Astronauts also used EVA in 1973 to repair launch damage to [[Skylab]], the United States' first space station.

A "Stand-up" EVA (SEVA) is where the astronaut does not fully leave a spacecraft, but is completely reliant on the spacesuit for environmental support.<ref name="standup">{{Cite web|url=http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a15/a15.seva.html|title=Stand-Up EVA|accessdate=October 21, 2008|publisher=NASA|year=2007|author=NASA}}</ref> Its name derives from the astronaut "standing up" in the open hatch, usually to film or assist a spacewalking astronaut.

EVAs may be either tethered (the astronaut is connected to the spacecraft; oxygen and electrical power can be supplied through an [[umbilical cable]]; no propulsion is needed to return to the spacecraft), or untethered. Untethered spacewalks were only performed on three missions in 1984 using the [[Manned Maneuvering Unit]] (MMU), and on a flight test in 1994 of the [[Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue]] (SAFER). A SAFER is a safety device worn on tethered U.S. EVAs, since the capability of returning to the spacecraft is essential.

[[Russia]], the [[United States]] and [[China]] have demonstrated the capability to conduct an EVA.

==Development history==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:GPN-2002-Leonov spacewalk.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sequence of snapshots: Leonov's spacewalk]] -->
[[NASA]] planners invented the term ''extravehicular activity'' (abbreviated with the acronym EVA) in the early 1960s for the [[Apollo program]] to land men on the Moon, because the astronauts would leave the spacecraft to collect [[moon rock|lunar material samples]] and deploy scientific experiments. To support this, and other Apollo objectives, the [[Project Gemini|Gemini program]] was spun off to develop the capability for astronauts to work outside a two-man Earth orbiting spacecraft. However, the [[Soviet Union]] was fiercely competitive in holding the early lead it had gained in manned spaceflight, so the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party]], led by [[Nikita Khrushchev]], ordered the conversion of its single-pilot [[Vostok (spacecraft)|Vostok]] capsule into a two- or three-person craft named [[Voskhod spacecraft|Voskhod]], in order to compete with Gemini and [[Apollo (spacecraft)|Apollo]].<ref name="Siddiqi 384-6">{{cite book

}}</ref> The Soviets were able to launch two Voskhod capsules before U.S. was able to launch its first manned Gemini.

The Voskhod's [[avionics]] required cooling by cabin air to prevent overheating, therefore an [[airlock]] was required for the spacewalking [[cosmonaut]] to exit and re-enter the cabin while it remained pressurized. By contrast, the Gemini avionics did not require air cooling, allowing the spacewalking astronaut to exit and re-enter the depressurized cabin through an open hatch. Because of this, the [[United States|American]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] space programs developed different definitions for the duration of an EVA. The Soviet (now [[Russia]]n) definition begins when the outer airlock hatch is open and the cosmonaut is in [[vacuum]]. An American EVA began when the astronaut had at least his head outside the spacecraft.<ref>''Walking to Olympus'', page ix</ref> The USA has changed its EVA definition since.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

===First spacewalk===

As they had with the [[Sputnik 1|first satellite]] and [[Vostok 1|first man in space]], the Soviets again stunned the world on March 18, 1965 with the '''first spacewalk''' (and '''the first EVA''') performed by '''[[Alexey Leonov]]''' from the [[Voskhod 2]] spacecraft, for 12 minutes outside the spacecraft. Leonov had no means to control his motion other than pulling on his {{convert|50.7|ft|m|adj=on}} tether. After the flight, he claimed this was easy, but his [[space suit]] ballooned from its internal pressure against the vacuum of space, stiffening so much that he could not activate the shutter on his chest-mounted camera.<ref name="portree"/>

At the end of his space walk, the suit stiffening caused a more serious problem: Leonov had to re-enter the capsule through the inflatable cloth airlock, {{convert|3.96|ft|m}} in diameter and {{convert|8.25|ft|m}} long. After his spacewalk, he improperly entered the airlock head-first and got stuck sideways. He could not get back in without reducing the pressure in his suit, risking "[[decompression sickness|the bends]]". This added another 12 minutes to his time in vacuum, and he was overheated by {{convert|1.8|C-change|F-change}} from the exertion. It would be almost four years before the Soviets tried another EVA. They misrepresented to the press how difficult Leonov found it to work in [[weightlessness]] and concealed the problems encountered until after the end of the [[Cold War]].<ref name="portree">{{cite web |url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/walking/EVAChron.pdf |title=Walking to Olympus: An EVA Chronology |accessdate=2015-07-30 |last=Portree |first=David S.

[[File:EdWhiteFirstAmericanSpacewalker.1965.ws.jpg|thumb|Ed White performs the first American spacewalk during Gemini IV (June 1965)]]

===Other firsts===

The first American spacewalk was performed on June 3, 1965, by [[Edward Higgins White|Edward H. White, II]] from the second manned Gemini flight, [[Gemini 4]], for 21 minutes, on a {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=on}} tether. White was the first to control his motion in space with a [[Hand-Held Maneuvering Unit]], which worked well but only carried enough propellant for 20 seconds. White found his tether useful for limiting his distance from the spacecraft but difficult to use for moving around, contrary to Leonov's claim.<ref name="portree"/> However, a defect in the capsule's hatch latching mechanism caused difficulties opening and closing the hatch, which delayed the start of the EVA and put White and his crewmate at risk of not getting back to Earth alive.<ref name="mcdivittoh">Oral History Transcript / [http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/McDivittJA/mcdivittja.pdf James A. McDivitt] / Interviewed by Doug Ward / Elk Lake, Michigan - 29 June 1999</ref>

No EVAs were planned on the next three Gemini flights. The next EVA was planned to be made by [[David Scott]] on [[Gemini 8]], but that mission had to be aborted due to a critical spacecraft malfunction before the EVA could be conducted. Astronauts on the next three Gemini flights ([[Eugene Cernan]], [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]], and [[Richard F. Gordon, Jr.|Richard Gordon]]), performed several EVAs, but none was able to successfully work for long periods outside the spacecraft without tiring and overheating.

Finally, on November 13, 1966, [[Buzz Aldrin|Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin]] became the first to successfully work in space without tiring, on the [[Gemini 12]] last flight. Aldrin worked outside the spacecraft for 2 hours and 6 minutes, in addition to two stand-up EVAs in the spacecraft hatch for an additional 3 hours and 24 minutes. Aldrin's interest in [[scuba diving]] inspired the use of [[Neutral buoyancy simulation as a training aid|underwater EVA training]] to simulate weightlessness, which has been used ever since to allow astronauts to practice techniques of avoiding wasted muscle energy.

On January 16, 1969, the Soviet Union achieved the first EVA '''crew transfer''' from one spacecraft to another when [[Aleksei Yeliseyev]] and [[Yevgeny Khrunov]] transferred from [[Soyuz 5]] to [[Soyuz 4]], which were docked together. This was the second Soviet EVA, and it would be almost another nine years before the Soviets performed their third.<ref name="portree"/>

[[File:Aldrin Apollo 11 original.jpg|thumb|right|Buzz Aldrin during ''[[Apollo 11]]'''s first Moon landing mission in 1969]]
The first EVA '''on the lunar surface''' was performed by Americans [[Neil Armstrong]] and Buzz Aldrin on July 21, 1969 ([[UTC]]), after the [[Apollo 11]] Moon landing. This first Moon walk lasted 2 hours, 36 minutes. A total of fifteen Moon walks were performed by members of six Apollo crews, including [[Pete Conrad|Charles "Pete" Conrad]], [[Alan Bean]], [[Alan Shepard]], [[Edgar Mitchell]], [[David Scott]], [[James Irwin]], [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]], [[Charles Duke]], [[Eugene Cernan|Eugene "Gene" Cernan]], and [[Harrison Schmitt|Dr. Harrison "Jack" Schmitt]]. Cernan was the last Apollo astronaut to step off the surface of the Moon.<ref name="portree"/>

[[File:Astronaut Charles Duke with a hammer on the lunar surface - pone.0006614.s003.ogv|thumb|[[Charles Duke]] with a hammer on the lunar surface.]]
The first EVA '''in deep space''' was made on August 5, 1971, by American [[Al Worden]], to retrieve a film and data recording canister from the [[Apollo 15]] [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Service Module|Service Module]] on the return trip from the Moon. Worden was assisted by James Irwin, doing a standup EVA in the Command Module hatch. This was repeated by [[Ken Mattingly]] and Charles Duke on [[Apollo 16]] and by  [[Ronald Evans (astronaut)|Ronald Evans]] and Harrison Schmitt on [[Apollo 17]].<ref name="portree"/>

The first EVA '''repairs of a spacecraft''' were made by [[Pete Conrad|Charles "Pete" Conrad]], [[Joseph Kerwin]], and [[Paul J. Weitz]] on May 26, June 7, and June 19, 1973, on the [[Skylab 2]] mission. They rescued the functionality of the launch-damaged [[Skylab]] [[space station]] by freeing a stuck [[solar panels on spacecraft|solar panel]], deploying a solar heating shield, and freeing a stuck circuit breaker relay. The Skylab 2 crew made three EVAs, and a total of ten EVAs were made by the three Skylab crews.<ref name="portree"/> They found that activities in weightlessness required about 2 1/2 times the duration as on Earth because many astronauts suffered [[spacesickness]] early in their flights.<ref name="reusestudy">''[http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19790075817_1979075817.pdf Skylab Reuse Study]'', p. 3-53. Martin Marietta and Bendix for NASA, September 1978.</ref>

After Skylab, no more EVAs were made by the United States until the advent of the [[Space Shuttle]] program in the early 1980s. In this period, the Soviets resumed EVAs, making four from the [[Salyut 6]] and [[Salyut 7]] space stations between December 20, 1977, and July 30, 1982.<ref name="portree"/>

When the United States resumed EVAs on April 7, 1983, astronauts started using an [[Extravehicular Mobility Unit]] (EMU) for self-contained life support independent of the spacecraft on Shuttle mission. STS-6 was the first Space Shuttle mission during which a spacewalk was conducted. Also, for the first time, American astronauts used an airlock to enter and exit the spacecraft like the Soviets. Accordingly, the American definition of EVA start time was redefined to when the astronaut switches the EMU to battery power.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Capability milestones===
* The first '''untethered spacewalk''' was made by American [[Bruce McCandless II]] on February 7, 1984, during ''Challenger'' mission [[STS-41-B]], using the [[Manned Maneuvering Unit]]. He was subsequently joined by [[Robert L. Stewart]] during the 5 hour 55 minute spacewalk. A self-contained spacewalk was first attempted by [[Eugene Cernan]] in 1966 on [[Gemini 9A]], but Cernan could not reach the maneuvering unit without tiring.
* The first '''metalwork in open space''', consisting of welding, brazing and metal spraying, was conducted by Soviet cosmonauts [[Svetlana Savitskaya]] and [[Vladimir Dzhanibekov]] on July 25, 1984. A specially designed multipurpose tool was used to perform these activities during a 3 hour, 30 minute EVA outside the Salyut 7 space station.<ref name="Salyut7Welding1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/flights/salt7ep4.htm|title=Encyclopedia Astronautica Salyut 7 EP-4 |publisher=Astronautix.com|author=Mark Wade|accessdate=November 18, 2011}}</ref><ref name="Salyut7Welding2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.aws.org/about/time_by5.html|title= A pictorial history of welding as seen through the pages of the Welding Journal| publisher=American Welding Society|accessdate=November 18, 2011}}</ref><ref name="Salyut7Welding3">{{Cite web|url=http://ruspace.blogspot.com/2009/07/space-welding-anniversary.html|title=Space welding anniversary|date=July 16, 2009|accessdate=November 18, 2011|publisher=RuSpace.com}}</ref>

Robinson was sent to remove two protruding gap fillers from [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']]'s heat shield, after engineers determined there was a small chance they could affect the shuttle upon re-entry. Robinson successfully removed the loose material while ''Discovery'' was docked to the [[International Space Station]].

==Commemoration==
The first spacewalk, that of the Soviet cosmonaut Alexey Leonov was commemorated in several Eastern Bloc stamps (see the [[Alexey Leonov#Stamps|stamps section]] in the [[Alexey Leonov]] article). Since the Soviet Union did not distribute diagrams or images of the Voskhod spacecraft at the time, the spaceship depiction in the stamps was purely fictional.

The US Post Office issued the Accomplishments in Space stamp in 1967. Along with astronaut Ed White, the issue depicts the Gemini IV spacecraft in orbit.

==Designations==
NASA "spacewalkers" during the space shuttle program were designated as EV-1, EV-2, EV-3 and EV-4 (assigned to mission specialists for each mission, if applicable).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/background/facts/evarm.html_prt.htm |title=Extravehicular Activity Radiation Monitoring (EVARM) |date=10/01 |publisher=[[NASA]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/background/facts/evarm.html |title=Extravehicular Activity Radiation Monitoring (EVARM)|date= 10/1 |publisher=Marschall Space Flight Center}}</ref>

==Camp-out procedure==
For EVAs from the International Space Station, NASA now routinely employs a [[Quest Joint Airlock#Camp out procedure|''camp out'' procedure]] to reduce the risk of decompression sickness.<ref name="tanner">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts115/interview_tanner.html|title=Preflight Interview: Joe Tanner|accessdate=February 8, 2008|publisher=NASA|year=2006|author=NASA}}</ref> This was first tested by the Expedition 12 crew. During a camp out, astronauts sleep overnight in the [[Quest Joint Airlock|airlock]] prior to an EVA, lowering the air pressure to {{convert|10.2|psi|kPa|abbr=on}}, compared to the normal station pressure of {{convert|14.7|psi|kPa|abbr=on}}.<ref name="tanner"/> Spending a night at the lower air pressure helps flush nitrogen from the body, thereby preventing "[[Decompression sickness|the bends]]".<ref>{{cite web | title = International Space Station Status Report #06-7 | url = http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/spacenews/reports/issreports/2006/iss06-7.html | publisher = NASA|author=NASA|accessdate=2006-02-17}}</ref><ref>
