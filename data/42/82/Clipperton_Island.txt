'''Clipperton Island''' ({{lang-fr|Île de Clipperton}} or ''{{lang|fr|Île de la Passion}}'', {{lang-es|'''Isla de la Pasión'''}}) is an uninhabited {{convert|6|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} coral [[atoll]] in the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]], {{convert|1080|km|0|abbr=on}} south-west of [[Mexico]], {{convert|2424|km|0|abbr=on}} west of [[Nicaragua]], {{convert|2545|km|0|abbr=on}} west of [[Costa Rica]] and {{convert|2260|km|0|abbr=on}} north-west of the [[Galápagos Islands]], [[Ecuador]], at {{Coord|10|18|N|109|13|W|name=Clipperton Island|type:isle_region:FR-CP|display=inline}}. It is an overseas [[Overseas departments and territories of France#Minor territories|minor territory]] of [[France]] under direct authority of the [[Minister of Overseas France]].<ref>[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=2E14855B772D504D6D56073B3A3BFDAD.tpdjo13v_1?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000879815&categorieLien=cid&dateTexte= Art. 9, Loi n° 55-1052 du 6 août 1955 modifiée portant statut des Terres australes et antarctiques françaises et de l'île de Clipperton].<br /> [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000018048991&fastPos=1&fastReqId=2007253908&categorieLien=id&oldAction=rechTexte Décret du 31 janvier 2008 relatif à l'administration de l'île de Clipperton].</ref>

It is low-lying and largely barren, save for scattered grasses and a few clumps of [[Coconut|coconut palms]]. A small volcanic outcrop rising to {{convert|29|m|ft|abbr=on}} on its south-east side is referred to as "Clipperton Rock".<ref>[http://www.qsl.net/clipperton2000/history.html Clipperton Island History].</ref> The atoll has been occupied at various times by [[guano]] miners, would-be settlers or military personnel, mostly from Mexico, which claimed it until [[international arbitration]] awarded it to France in 1931.

Clipperton has had no permanent inhabitants since 1945. It is visited on occasion by fishermen, [[French Navy]] patrols, scientific researchers, film crews, and shipwreck survivors. It has been a popular site for transmissions by [[Amateur radio|ham radio]] operators.<ref>[http://www.qsl.net/clipperton2000/ Clipperton Island DXpedition], includes details on several previous ham radio expeditions to Clipperton, and photos of the island.</ref>

==Environment==

===Location, lagoon and climate===

Clipperton is about {{convert|945|km|mi nmi|abbr=on}} south-east of [[Socorro Island]] in the [[Revillagigedo Islands|Revillagigedo Archipelago]], the nearest land. Its ring-shaped atoll completely encloses a [[water stagnation|stagnant]] freshwater [[lagoon]], and is {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} in circumference. The rim averages {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} in width, reaching {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the west and narrows to {{convert|45|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the north-east, where sea waves occasionally spill over into the lagoon. Land elevations average {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}}, though Clipperton Rock, a barren {{convert|29|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[volcano|volcanic]] outcrop in the south-east, is considerably higher and is the highest point. The surrounding reef is exposed at low tide.<ref name="ClippertonIsland">{{WWF ecoregion|id=nt0705|name=Clipperton Island Shrubs and Grasslands|accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref>

The lagoon is devoid of fish, and contains some deep basins with depths of {{convert|43|and|22|m|ft|abbr=on}}, including a spot known as ''Trou-Sans-Fond'', or "the bottomless hole", with [[sulfuric acid|acidic water]] at its base. The water is described as being almost [[Fresh water|fresh]] at the surface, and highly [[eutrophic]]. Seaweed beds cover approximately 45 percent of the lagoon's surface.<ref name="ClippertonIsland" />

[[File:Localisation de l'ile de Clipperton.png|thumb|350px|Location of Clipperton Island]]

While some sources have rated the lagoon water as [[potable|non-potable]],<ref>[http://www.traveltips24.com/Clipperton_Island.htm Clipperton Island Travel Tips], [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/08/0828_030829_milbrandjournal1.html Lance Hildebrand's Journal]</ref> testimony from the crew of the [[tuna]] clipper M/V ''Monarch,'' stranded for 23 days in 1962 after their boat sank, indicates otherwise. Their report reveals that the lagoon water, while not tasting very good, was drinkable, though "muddy and dirty". Several of the castaways drank it, with no apparent ill effects.<ref>[http://www.sil.si.edu/digitalcollections/atollresearchbulletin/issues/00094.pdf Atoll Research Bulletin No. 94]. National Academy of Sciences, Washington, D.C., December 15, 1962, pp.8–9.</ref>

Survivors of an ill-fated Mexican military [[colony]] in 1917 (see below) indicated that they were dependent upon [[rain]] for their water supply, catching it in old [[boat]]s they used for this purpose.<ref>[http://www.sil.si.edu/digitalcollections/atollresearchbulletin/issues/00094.pdf Atoll Research Bulletin No. 94]. National Academy of Sciences, Washington, D.C., December 15, 1962, pg.10.</ref> Aside from the lagoon and water caught from rain, no other freshwater sources are known to exist.

It has a tropical oceanic climate, with average temperatures of {{convert|20|–|32|C|F}}. The rainy season occurs from May to October, when it is subject to tropical storms and hurricanes. Surrounding ocean waters are warm, pushed by equatorial and counter-equatorial currents. It has no known natural resources, its [[guano]] having been depleted early in the 20th century. Although 115 species of fish have been identified in nearby waters the only economic activity in the area is [[tuna]] fishing.

===Flora and fauna===
[[File:Clippertonisland.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Coconut]] palms on Clipperton. The lagoon is visible beyond the trees.]]
When Snodgrass and Heller visited in 1898, they reported that "no land plant is native to the island".<ref>Snodgrass and Heller, 1902.</ref> Historical accounts from 1711, 1825 and 1839 show a low grassy or suffrutescent (partially woody) flora (Sachet, 1962). [[Coconut|Coconut palm]]s were introduced in the 1890s and a few still survive. Introduction of [[pig]]s by [[guano]] miners at the beginning of the 20th century reduced the crab population, which in turn allowed [[grassland]] to gradually cover about 80 percent of the land surface (Sachet, 1962). The elimination of these pigs in 1958 — as the result of a personal project by [[Kenneth E. Stager]],<ref>[http://mundo.cabrillo.edu/~ncrane/Clipperton/ratsandpigs.pdf CLIPPERTON ISLAND: PIG STY, RAT HOLE AND BOOBY PRIZE]; by Robert L. Pitman, Lisa T. Ballance, and Charly Bost; published in ''Marine Ornithology'', volume 33, page 193-194</ref> — has caused most of this vegetation to disappear as millions of [[crab]]s (''Gecarcinus planatus'')<ref>Accepted name: ''Johngarthia planata'', Stimpson; see: http://www.catalogueoflife.org/col/search/all/key/johngarthia+planata/match/1 ; http://crustac3a.tumblr.com/post/38610682919/this-crab-johngarthia-planata-is-one-of-the-few</ref> have returned. The result is virtually a sandy desert, with only 674 palms counted by [[Christian Jost (geographer)|Christian Jost]] during the "Passion 2001" French mission, and five islets in the lagoon with grass that the terrestrial crabs cannot reach.

During Sachet's visit in 1958, the vegetation was found to consist of a sparse cover of spiny grass and low thickets, a creeping plant (''[[Ipomoea]]'' sp.), and stands of coconut palm. This low-lying herbaceous flora seems to be pioneer in nature, and most of it is believed to be composed of recently introduced [[species]]. Sachet suspected that ''[[Heliotropium curassavicum]]'' and possibly ''[[Portulaca oleracea]]'' were native (Sachet 1962).

On the north-west side the most abundant species are ''[[Cenchrus echinatus]]'', ''[[Sida rhombifolia]]'', and ''Corchorus aestuans''. These plants compose a shrub cover up to 30&nbsp;cm in height and are intermixed with ''[[Eclipta]]'', ''[[Phyllanthus]]'', and ''[[Solanum]]'', as well as a taller plant, ''[[Brassica juncea]]''. A unique feature is the vegetation is arranged in parallel rows of species. Dense rows of taller species alternate with lower, more open vegetation. This was assumed to be a result of the [[phosphate]] mining method of trench-digging.<ref name="ClippertonIsland" />

The only land animals known to exist are bright-orange crabs, birds, lizards and rats, the last of which seem to have arrived from recently wrecked ships.<ref name="ClippertonIsland_a">{{cite web|url=http://www.clipperton.fr/downloads/ArtPitman2006.pdf |title=Clipperton Island: Pig Sty, Rat Hole, and Booby Prize |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref> Bird species include [[white tern]]s, [[masked booby|masked boobies]], [[sooty tern]]s, [[brown booby|brown boobies]], [[brown noddy|brown noddies]], [[black noddy|black noddies]], [[greater frigatebird|greater frigates]], [[coot]]s, martins, [[cuckoo]]s and [[yellow warbler]]s. [[Duck]]s have been reported in the lagoon.<ref name="ClippertonIsland" /> The island has been identified as an [[Important Bird Area]] by [[BirdLife International]] because of the large breeding colony of masked boobies, with 110,000 individual birds recorded.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.birdlife.org |title= Clipperton|accessdate=2012-11-21 |work= BirdLife data zone: Important Bird Areas |first= |last= |publisher= BirdLife International |year= 2012}}</ref> The lagoon harbours millions of [[isopod]]s, which swimmers claim can deliver a painful sting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qsl.net/clipperton2000/previous/n9ns-1992.html |title=1992 Clipperton Island Expedition |publisher=Qsl.net |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref>

A recent report (2006) by the [[NOAA]]'s Southwest Fisheries Science Center in [[La Jolla]], [[California]], USA indicates that the increased rat presence has led to a decline in both crab and bird populations, causing a corresponding increase in both vegetation and coconut palms. This report urgently recommended eradication of rats so that vegetation might be reduced and the island might return to its "pre-human" state.<ref name="ClippertonIsland_a" />

==History==

===Discovery and early claims===

The name ''Île de la Passion'' ({{lang-en|Passion Island}}) was officially given to Clipperton in 1711 by French discoverers Martin de Chassiron and Michel Du Bocage, commanding the French ships ''La Princesse'' and ''La Découverte''. They drew up the first map and annexed the island to France. The first scientific expedition took place in 1725 under Frenchman M. Bocage, who lived on the island for several months. In 1858 France formally laid claim.

The name comes from [[John Clipperton]], an English [[pirate]] and [[privateer]] who fought the Spanish during the early 18th century, and who is said to have passed by the island. Some sources say he used it as a base for his raids on shipping, but there is no documentary evidence.<ref>Büch, Boudewijn. ''Eilanden'' ('Islands'). Holland, 1991, IScBN 9041330860</ref>

Other claimants included the United States, whose American Guano Mining Company claimed it under the [[Guano Islands Act]] of 1856; Mexico also claimed it due to activities undertaken there as early as 1848–1849. On 17 November 1858 Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon&nbsp;III]] annexed it as part of the French colony of [[Tahiti]]. This did not settle the ownership question. On 24 November 1897, French naval authorities found three Americans working for the American Guano Company, who had raised the American flag. U.S. authorities denounced their act, assuring the French that they did not intend to assert American sovereignty.<ref>''[http://www.ilsa.org/jessup/jessup10/basicmats/clipperton.pdf Clipperton Islands Case (Mexico v. France)]'', Judicial Decisions Involving Questions of International Law (28 January 1931).</ref>

[[Mexico]] reasserted its claim late in the 19th century, and on 13 December 1897 sent the gunboat ''La Democrata'' to occupy and annex it. A colony was established, and a series of military governors was posted, the last one being [[Ramón Arnaud]] (1906–1916). France insisted on ''its'' ownership, and a lengthy diplomatic correspondence between the two nations led to the conclusion of a treaty on March 2, 1909, to seek the arbitration of King [[Victor Emmanuel&nbsp;III of Italy]], with each nation promising to abide by his determination.<ref>Original treaty between Mexico and France, French Foreign Ministry Archives, PDF file: [https://pastel.diplomatie.gouv.fr/choiseul/ressource/pdf/D19090019.pdf Gouv-fr-PDF-19].</ref> His decision would not be rendered until 1931.

===Guano mining and the tragedy of 1917===
[[File:SobrevivientesClipperton.jpg|thumb|300px|Mexican survivors from Clipperton Island, 1917]]

The British Pacific Island Company acquired the rights to guano deposits in 1906 and built a mining settlement in conjunction with the Mexican government. That same year, a lighthouse was erected under the orders of [[List of Presidents of Mexico|President]] [[Porfirio Díaz]]. By 1914 around 100 people&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;were living there, resupplied every two months by a ship from [[Acapulco]]. With the escalation of fighting in the [[Mexican Revolution]], the regular resupply visits ceased and the inhabitants were left to their own devices.<ref name="clippertonproject">{{cite web|url=http://www.clippertonproject.com/expeditions/clipperton-island-2012/about-clipperton-island/ |title=About Clipperton Island |publisher=Clippertonproject.com |date= |accessdate=}}</ref>

By 1917 all but one of the male inhabitants had died. Many had perished from [[scurvy]], while others (including Captain Arnaud) died during an attempt to sail after a passing ship to fetch help. Lighthouse keeper Victoriano Álvarez was the last man on the island, together with 15 women and children.<ref name="Travel Blog">{{cite web|url=http://elainejobin.com/Elsewhere/Pacific/Clipperton_2010/000.html |title=Trip Report and Photos - Clipperton Island, 2010, Elain Jobin |publisher=Elainejobin.com |date=1917-07-18 |accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref> Álvarez proclaimed himself "king" and began an orgy of rape and murder, before being killed by Tirza Rendon, who was the recipient of his unwanted attention.<ref name="clippertonproject" /> Almost immediately after Álvarez's death four women and seven children, the last survivors, were picked up by the US Navy gunship {{USS|Yorktown|PG-1|2}} on 18 July 1917.<ref name="clippertonproject" /> No more attempts were made to colonize it, though it was briefly occupied during the 1930s and 1940s.

The tragic tale of the Mexican colony has been the subject of several novels, including Ivo Mansmann's ''Clipperton, Schicksale auf einer vergessenen Insel'' ("Clipperton, Destinies on a Forgotten Island") in German,<ref>{{cite book |last=Mansmann |first=Ivo |title=Clipperton, Schicksale auf einer vergessenen Insel |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/clipperton-schicksale-auf-einer-vergessenen-insel-roman/oclc/31495383 |accessdate=July 7, 2015 |year=1990 |publisher=Mitteldeutscher Verlag |location=Halle |isbn=3-354-00709-5}}</ref> Colombian writer [[Laura Restrepo]]'s ''La Isla de la Pasión'' ("Passion Island") in Spanish,<ref>Restrepo, Laura.

===Final arbitration of ownership===
Mexico and France signed a [[compromis]] in 1909, agreeing to submit the dispute over sovereignty over Clipperton Island to binding [[International arbitration|arbitration]] by King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emanuel]] of [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]. In 1931 Victor Emanuel issued his arbitral decision in the ''Clipperton Island Case'', declaring Clipperton to be a French possession.<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/2189369 Arbitral award] in English from JSTOR; [http://legal.un.org/riaa/cases/vol_II/1105-1111.pdf ''Clipperton Island Case'' (''France v.

===Recent developments===
[[File:Brown booby.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[brown booby]]]]

The island was abandoned by the end of World War II after being briefly occupied by the US from 1944–45. Since then it has been visited by sport fishermen, patrols of the French Navy, and by Mexican [[tuna]] and [[shark]] fishermen. There have been infrequent scientific and [[amateur radio]] expeditions, and in 1978 [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau]] visited with his team of divers and a survivor from the 1917 evacuation to film a [[television]] special called ''Clipperton: The Island that Time Forgot.''<ref>Simon Rogerson, [http://www.divemagazine.co.uk/news/article.asp?UAN=2934&v=5&sp=332382698484330872538 "Cousteau and the Pit"], ''Dive magazine'', July 19, 2006.</ref>

It was visited by ornithologist Ken Stager of the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County|Los Angeles County Museum]] in 1958. Appalled at the depredations visited by feral pigs upon the island's [[brown booby]] and [[masked booby]] colonies (reduced to 500 and 150 birds, respectively), Stager procured a [[shotgun]] and killed all 58 pigs. By 2003, the booby colonies had 25,000 brown boobies and 112,000 masked boobies, the world's second-largest brown booby colony and its largest masked booby colony.<ref name="ClippertonIsland_a" />

When the independence of [[Algeria]] in 1962 threatened French nuclear testing sites in the African nation, the French Ministry of Defence considered Clipperton Island as a possible replacement. This was eventually ruled out due to the hostile climate and remote location. The French explored reopening the lagoon and developing a harbor for trade and tourism during the 1970s but this idea was abandoned. An automatic weather installation was completed on 7 April 1980, with data collected by this station being transmitted by satellite to [[Brittany]].

In 1981, the Academy of Sciences for Overseas Territories recommended that the island have its own economic infrastructure, with an airstrip and a fishing port in the [[lagoon]]. This would mean opening up the lagoon by creating a passage in the atoll rim. For this purpose, an agreement was signed with the French government, represented by the High Commissioner for French Polynesia, whereby the island became French state property.

In 1986 a meeting took place regarding the establishment of a permanent base for fishing, between the high commissioner of [[French Polynesia]], representing the state, and the survey firm for the development and exploitation of the island (SEDEIC). Taking into account the economic constraints, the distance from markets, and the small size of the atoll, nothing apart from preliminary studies was undertaken. All plans for development were abandoned.

===Castaways===
In early 1962 the island provided a home to nine crewmen of the sunken tuna clipper MV ''Monarch'', stranded for 23 days from 6 February to 1 March. They reported that the lagoon water was drinkable, though they preferred to drink water from the coconuts they found. Unable to use any of the dilapidated buildings, they constructed a crude shelter from cement bags and tin salvaged from [[Quonset hut]]s built by the American military 20 years earlier.<ref name="Atoll Research Bulletin No. 94">[http://www.sil.si.edu/digitalcollections/atollresearchbulletin/issues/00094.pdf Atoll Research Bulletin No. 94]. National Academy of Sciences, Washington, D.C., December 15, 1962, pp.8–10.</ref>

Wood from the huts was used for firewood, and fish caught off the fringing reef combined with some potatoes and onions they had saved from their sinking vessel to augment the meagre supply of coconuts. The crewmen reported that they tried eating bird's eggs, but found them to be rancid, and they decided after trying to cook a "little black bird" that it did not have enough meat to make the effort worthwhile. Pigs had been eradicated, though the crewmen reported seeing their [[skeleton]]s around the atoll.  The crewmen were eventually discovered by another fishing boat and rescued by the United States Navy destroyer [[USS Robison (DDG-12)|USS ''Robison'']].<ref name="Atoll Research Bulletin No. 94"/>

In 1988, five Mexican fishermen became lost at sea after a storm during their trip along the coast of [[Costa Rica]]. They drifted within sight of the island but were unable to reach it.<ref>Arias, Ron. ''Five against the sea: A true story of courage and survival'', 1989</ref> Steven Longbaugh and David Heritage, two [[United States|American]] deckhands from a [[fishing boat]] based in [[California]], were stranded for three weeks in 1998. They were rescued after rebuilding a survival radio and using distress flares to signal for help.<ref>LaJoie, John. ''American Maritime Accident Report'', 1998</ref>

In 2001, French geographer [[Christian Jost (geographer)|Christian Jost]] extended the 1997 studies through his French "Passion 2001" expedition, explaining the evolution of the ecosystem, and releasing several papers, a video film, and a website.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bruno Quintero |url=http://clipperton.fr |title=Clipperton ou Ile de La Passion |publisher=Clipperton.fr |date=1999-02-22}}</ref> In 2003 Lance Milbrand<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milbrandcinema.com/ |title=Lance Milbrand |publisher=Milbrandcinema.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref> stayed for 41 days on a [[National Geographic Society]] expedition, recording his adventure in video, photos, and a written diary (see links below).

In 2005, the [[ecosystem]] was extensively studied for four months by a scientific mission organized by Jean-Louis Étienne, which made a complete inventory of mineral, plant, and animal species, studied algae as deep as 100&nbsp;m (330&nbsp;ft) below sea level, and examined the effects of pollution. A 2008 expedition from the [[University of Washington]]'s School of Oceanography collected sediment cores from the lagoon to study climate change over the last millennium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/jsachs/lab/www/Research/Clipperton_2008/Clipperton_2008.html |title=Clipperton Atoll Expedition 2008 |publisher=Faculty.washington.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref>

On 21 February 2007, administration was transferred from the [[High Commissioner]] of the Republic in [[French Polynesia]] to the Minister of Overseas France.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ben Cahoon |url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Fr_minor.html |title=French Minor Dependencies |publisher=Worldstatesmen.org |date=}}</ref>

A recreational scuba diving expedition by the luxury liveaboard safari boat M/V ''Nautilus Explorer'' dived on the reefs from 15 to 20 April 2007 to observe the marine life and compare these observations with those reported by the Connie Limbaugh (Scripps) expeditions in 1956 and 1958. Commencing in 2010, the ''Nautilus Explorer'' will be running diving expeditions from [[Cabo San Lucas]] via [[Socorro Island]] every spring.

During the night of 10 February  2010, the ''Sichem Osprey'', a [[Maltese people|Maltese]] [[chemical tanker]], ran aground on its way from the [[Panama Canal]] to [[South Korea]]. The {{convert|170|m|adj=on}} ship contained [[xylene]], a clear, flammable volatile liquid. All 19 crew members were reported safe, and the vessel reported no leaks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://diver.net/bbs/posts002/81342.shtml |title='&#39;Diver.Net'&#39;, Retrieved, November 13, 2010 |publisher=Diver.net |date=2010-03-01 |accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://reeftools.com/news/xylene-tanker-runs-aground-on-clipperton-island/ |title=ReefTools, Retrieved November 13, 2010 |publisher=Reeftools.com |date=2010-02-22 |accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref>  The vessel was refloated on March 6<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lloydslist.com/ll/search-results.htm;jsessionid=4ABF68DBDE9D889B43BBE23A30C751CD |title='&#39;Lloyd's of London;'&#39; Retrieved, November 13, 2010 |publisher=Lloydslist.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref> and returned to service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/shipdetails.aspx?MMSI=249534000 |title='&#39;MarineTraffic.com'&#39; Retrieved, November 13, 2010 |publisher=Marinetraffic.com |date=2012-06-13 |accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref>

In mid-March 2012, the crew from The Clipperton Project <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clippertonproject.com/plastic-surveying-and-collection/ |title=The Clipperton Project, 1 March 2012 |publisher=Clippertonproject.com |date=2011-05-26 |accessdate=2012-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120502053953/http://www.clippertonproject.com:80/plastic-surveying-and-collection/ |archivedate=2 May 2012 }}</ref> noted the widespread presence of refuse, particularly on the northeast shore and around the Rock. Debris including plastic bottles and containers create a potentially harmful environment to its flora and fauna. This trash is common to only two beaches (North East and South West) and the rest of the island is fairly clean. Other refuse has been left over after the occupation by the Americans in 1944–45, the French in 1966–69 and the 2008 scientific expedition.

===Amateur radio DX-peditions===
The island has long been an attractive destination for amateur radio groups, due to its remoteness, difficulty of landing, permit requirements, romantic history, and interesting environment. While some radio operation was done ancillary to other expeditions, major DX-peditions include FO0XB (1978), FO0XX (1985), FO0CI (1992), FO0AAA (2000), and TX5C (2008).

One [[DX-pedition]] was the Cordell Expedition in March 2013 using the callsign TX5K,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tx5k.org |title=The 2013 Cordell Expedition to Clipperton Island}}</ref> organized and led by [[Robert Schmieder]]. The project combined radio operations with selected scientific investigations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cordell.org |title=Cordell Expeditions}}</ref> The team of 24 radio operators made more than 114,000 contacts, breaking the previous record of 75,000. The activity included extensive operation on 6 metres, including EME (Earth-Moon-Earth, or moonbounce) contacts. A notable accomplishment was the use of DXA, a real-time satellite-based online graphic radio log web page that allowed anyone anywhere with a browser to see the radio activity. Scientific work carried out during the expedition included the first collection and identification of [[foraminifera]], and extensive aerial imaging of the island using kite-borne cameras. The team included two scientists from the French-Polynesian [[University of Tahiti]] and a TV crew from the French TV channel [[Thalassa (TV series)|Thalassa]].

An April 2015 DXpedition using callsign TX5P was conducted by Alain Duchauchoy, F6BFH, concurrent with the Passion 2015 scientific expedition to Clipperton Island, and engaging in research of Mexican use of the island during the early 1900s.
