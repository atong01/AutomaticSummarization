'''Edna St. Vincent Millay''' (February 22, 1892 &ndash; October 19, 1950) was an American [[lyric poetry|lyrical poet]] and playwright.<ref name="WVobit">Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', October 25, 1950.</ref> She received the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] in 1923, the third woman to win the award for poetry,<ref>[http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Poetry Pulitzer site]</ref> and was also known for her feminist activism. She used the pseudonym '''Nancy Boyd''' for her prose work. The poet [[Richard Wilbur]] asserted, "She wrote some of the best sonnets of the century."<ref>Millay, Edna St. Vincent. ''Selected Poems''. Harper Collins, 1991</ref>

==Early life==
Millay was born in [[Rockland, Maine]], to Cora Lounella Buzelle, a nurse, and Henry Tolman Millay, a schoolteacher who would later become a superintendent of schools.  Her middle name derives from [[St. Vincent's Hospital (Manhattan)|St. Vincent's Hospital]] in [[New York]], where her uncle's life had been saved just before her birth. The family's house was "between the mountains and the sea where baskets of apples and drying herbs on the porch mingled their scents with those of the neighboring pine woods."<ref Name = "NYT"/> In 1904, Cora officially divorced Millay's father for financial irresponsibility, but they had already been separated for some years. Cora and her three daughters, Edna (who called herself "Vincent"), Norma Lounella (born 1893), and Kathleen Kalloch (born 1896), moved from town to town, living in poverty. Cora travelled with a trunk full of classic literature, including [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[John Milton|Milton]], which she read to her children. The family settled in a small house on the property of Cora's aunt in [[Camden, Maine]], where Millay would write the first of the poems that would bring her literary fame.

The three sisters were independent and spoke their minds, which did not always sit well with the authority figures in their lives. Millay's grade school principal, offended by her frank attitudes, refused to call her Vincent. Instead, he called her by any woman's name that started with a V.<ref Name="epstein">{{cite book | last = Epstein | first = Daniel Mark | year = 2001 | title = What Lips My Lips Have Kissed: The Loves and Love Poems of Edna St. Vincent Millay | location = New York | publisher = Henry Holt | isbn = 0-8050-6727-2 }}</ref> At Camden High School, Millay began developing her literary talents, starting at the school's literary magazine, ''The Megunticook''.  At 14 she won the St. Nicholas Gold Badge for poetry, and by 15, she had published her poetry in the popular children's magazine ''St. Nicholas'', the ''Camden Herald'', and the high-profile anthology ''Current Literature''. While at school, she had several relationships with women, including [[Edith Wynne Matthison]], who would go on to become an actress in silent films.<ref Name="AAP">[http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/160 Millay biography from the Academy of American Poets]</ref>

Millay entered [[Vassar College]] in 1913 when she was 21 years old, later than usual. She had relationships with several fellow students during her time there and kept scrapbooks including drafts of plays written during the period.<ref name="epstein" /><ref>Brinkman, B.

After her graduation from Vassar in 1917, Millay moved to [[New York City]]. She lived in a number of places in [[Greenwich Village]], including a house owned by the [[Cherry Lane Theatre]]<ref name="Nevius">{{cite book | first = Michelle and James | last = Nevius| title = Inside the Apple: A Streetwise History of New York City| place = New York| publisher = Free Press| year = 2009}}</ref> and [[75½ Bedford St]], renowned for being the narrowest<ref>[[75½ Bedford St]]</ref>{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=October 2015}} in New York City.<ref>Wetzsteon, Ross. 2002. Republic of dreams: Greenwich Village, the American Bohemia, 1910-1960. New York: Simon & Schuster. p.283</ref>  The critic [[Floyd Dell]] wrote that the red-haired and beautiful Millay was "a frivolous young woman, with a brand-new pair of dancing slippers and a mouth like a valentine."<ref Name= "NYT"/>  Millay described her life in New York as "very, very poor and very, very merry." While establishing her career as a poet, Millay initially worked with the Provincetown Players on Macdougal Street and the Theatre Guild. In 1924 Millay and others founded the Cherry Lane Theater "to continue the staging of experimental drama."<ref>Delaney, Edmund T. 1968. New York's Greenwich Village. Barre, Mass: Barre Publishers. p.112</ref> Magazine articles under a pseudonym also helped support her early days in the village.<ref Name = "NYT"/>

Millay was openly bisexual.  Counted among her close friends were the writers [[Witter Bynner]], [[Arthur Davison Ficke]], and [[Susan Glaspell]], as well as [[Floyd Dell]] and the critic [[Edmund Wilson]], both of whom proposed marriage to her and were refused.<ref Name="AAP"/><ref>{{cite book | last = Milford | first = Nancy | year = 2001 | title = Savage Beauty: The Life of Edna St. Vincent Millay | location = New York | publisher = Random House | isbn = 0-375-76081-4 | pages = 191–192 }}</ref>

==Career==
Millay’s fame began in 1912 when she entered her poem "[[Renascence (poem)|Renascence]]" in a poetry contest in ''The Lyric Year''.  The poem was widely considered the best submission and when it was ultimately awarded fourth place, it created a scandal which brought Millay publicity. The first-place winner [[Orrick Johns]] was among those who felt that “Renascence” was the best poem, and stated that “the award was as much an embarrassment to me as a triumph".  A second-prize winner offered Millay his $250 prize money.<ref name="Dash">{{cite book| first = Joan | last = Dash| author-link = Joan Dash | title = A Life of One’s Own: Three Gifted Women and the Men They Married| place = New York| publisher = Harper ¶ Row | year = 1973}}</ref>  In the immediate aftermath of the ''Lyric Year'' controversy, wealthy arts patron Caroline B. Dow heard Millay reciting her poetry and playing the piano at the Whitehall Inn in [[Camden, Maine]], and was so impressed that she offered to pay for Millay’s education at [[Vassar College]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.csustan.edu/english/reuben/pal/chap7/millay.html |title = Chapter 7: Edna St. Vincent Millay | last = Reuben | first = Paul P |work = PAL: Perspectives in American Literature – A Research and Reference Guide | publisher = CSUSTAN | accessdate= July 2, 2012}}</ref>

Her 1920 collection ''A Few Figs From Thistles'' drew controversy for its novel exploration of female sexuality and feminism.<ref>Millay, Edna St. Vincent. [http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/esv-millay/figs-thistles.pdf ''A few Figs from Thistles'']</ref>  In 1919 she wrote the anti-war play ''Aria da Capo'' which starred her sister Norma Millay at the [[Provincetown Playhouse]] in New York City. Millay won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for Poetry in 1923 for "The Ballad of the Harp-Weaver";<ref>Millay, Edna St. Vincent,  [http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/millay/ballad/ballad.html "The Ballad of the Harp-Weaver"]</ref> she was the third woman to win the poetry prize, after [[Sara Teasdale]] (1918) and [[Margaret Widdemer]] (1919).<ref name = "Pulitzer site">{{Citation | url = http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Poetry | title = Pulitzer | contribution = Poetry | accessdate = December 9, 2010}}.</ref>

In January 1921, she went to [[Paris]], where she met and befriended the sculptor [[Thelma Wood]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Herring | first = Phillip | year = 1995 | title = Djuna: The Life and Work of Djuna Barnes | location = New York | publisher = Penguin Books | isbn = 0-14-017842-2 | page = 158}}</ref>

[[File:Steepletop main house, Austerlitz, NY.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Main house at Steepletop, where Millay spent the last years of her life]]
In 1923 she married 43-year-old Eugen Jan [[Boissevain family|Boissevain]] (1880–1949), the widower of the labor lawyer and war correspondent [[Inez Milholland]], a political icon Millay had met during her time at Vassar. A self-proclaimed feminist, Boissevain supported her career and took primary care of domestic responsibilities. Both Millay and Boissevain had other lovers throughout their twenty-six-year marriage. For Millay, a significant such relationship was with the poet [[George Dillon (poet)|George Dillon]]. She met Dillon at one of her readings at the University of Chicago in 1928 where he was a student. He was fourteen years her junior, and the relationship inspired the [[sonnet]]s in the collection ''Fatal Interview'' (published 1931).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/edna-st-vincent-millay | title=Edna St. Vincent Millay | publisher=Poetry Foundation | accessdate=2013-06-27}}</ref>

In 1925, Boissevain and Millay bought [[Steepletop]] near [[Austerlitz, New York]], which had been a {{convert|635|acre|ha|adj=on}} blueberry farm.<ref name="Millay Colony history">{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.millaycolony.org/history | publisher = [[Millay Colony for the Arts]] | accessdate= January 23, 2010}}</ref> The couple built a barn (from a [[Sears|Sears Roebuck]] kit), and then a writing cabin and a tennis court.

During the first war Millay had been a dedicated and active pacifist; however, from 1940 she supported the Allied Forces, writing in celebration of the war effort and later working with [[Writers' War Board]] to create propaganda, including poetry.<ref>[http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/alumni/edna-st-vincent-millay.html "Edna St. Vincent Millay"] ''Vassar Encyclopaedia'', Vassar College</ref> Her reputation in poetry circles was damaged by her war work. Merle Rubin noted: "She seems to have caught more flak from the literary critics for supporting democracy than [[Ezra Pound]] did for championing [[fascism]]."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rubin|first1=Merle|title=Lyrical, Rebellious And Almost Forgotten |url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB999736509740821352|accessdate=24 February 2015 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=6 September 2001}}</ref>  In ''The New York Times'', Millay mourned the Czechoslovak city of [[Lidice]], the site of a Nazi massacre:

<blockquote><poem>The whole world holds in its arms today
The murdered village of Lidice, 
Like the murdered body of a little child.<ref Name= "NYT"/></poem></blockquote>

In 1943 Millay was the sixth person and the second woman to be awarded the [[Frost Medal]] for her lifetime contribution to American poetry.

Boissevain died in 1949 of [[lung cancer]], and Millay lived alone for the last year of her life.

==Death and legacy==
Millay died at her home on October 19, 1950. She had fallen down stairs and was found approximately eight hours after her death. Her physician reported that she had suffered a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] following a [[coronary occlusion]].<ref Name = "NYT">{{Citation | url = http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0222.html?scp=5&sq=st%20vincent%20millay&st=cse | newspaper = The New York Times | type = obituary | date = October 20, 1950 | title = Edna St. V.

Millay's sister Norma and her husband, the painter and actor Charles Frederick Ellis, moved to Steepletop after Millay's death. In 1973, they established [[Millay Colony for the Arts]] on the seven acres around the house and barn.  After the death of her husband in 1976, Norma continued to run the program until her death in 1986.<ref name="Millay Colony history"/> At 17, the poet [[Mary Oliver]] visited Steepletop and became a close friend of Norma. Oliver eventually lived there for seven years and helped to organize Millay's papers.<ref Name="Land">{{Citation | url = http://travel.nytimes.com/2009/07/05/travel/05oliver.html?pagewanted=3 | title = The Land and Words of Mary Oliver, the Bard of Provincetown | date = July 5, 2009 | newspaper = The New York Times | accessdate = 2010-09-07}}.</ref> Mary Oliver herself went on to become a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet, greatly inspired by Millay's work.<ref Name="PoetryFound">[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poet.html?id=5130 Poetry Foundation Oliver biography]. Accessed 2010-09-07</ref> In 2006, the state of [[New York (state)|New York]] paid $1.69 million to acquire {{convert|230|acre|km2}} of Steepletop, with the intention to add the land to a nearby state forest preserve. The proceeds of the sale were to be used by the Edna St. Vincent Millay Society to restore the farmhouse and grounds and turn it into a museum. The museum has been open to the public since summer 2010, and guided tours of Steepletop and Millay's gardens are available from the end of May through the middle of October. Parts of the grounds of Steepletop, including the Millay Poetry Trail that leads to her grave, are now open to the public year-round.

In 2015, she was named as one of the 31 Icons of 2015's [[LGBT History Month]] by Equality Forum.<ref>{{cite web|author=BY&nbsp; Malcolm Lazin |url=http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2015/08/20/op-ed-here-are-31-icons-2015s-gay-history-month |title=Op-ed: Here Are the 31 Icons of 2015's Gay History Month |publisher=Advocate.com |date=August 20, 2015 |accessdate=2015-08-21}}</ref>

Millay wrote five [[verse drama]]s early in her career, including ''Two Slatterns and a King'' and ''The Lamp and the Bell'', a poem written for [[Vassar College]] about love between women.<ref Name="AAP"/> She was commissioned by the [[Metropolitan Opera|Metropolitan Opera House]] to write a [[libretto]] for an opera composed by [[Deems Taylor]]. The result, ''[[The King's Henchman]]'', drew on the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'s'' account of Eadgar, King of Wessex, and was described as the most effectively and artistically wrought American opera ever to reach the stage. Within three weeks, her publishers had run through four editions of the book.<ref Name= "NYT"/>

Her pacifist verse drama ''Aria da Capo'', a one-act play written for the [[Provincetown Players]], is often anthologized.  It aired live as an episode of ''[[Academy Theatre]]'' in 1949 on NBC.
