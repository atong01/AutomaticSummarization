As a [[literary device]], an ''allegory'' in its most general sense is an extended [[metaphor]]. '''Allegory''' has been used widely throughout history in all forms of [[art]], largely because it can readily illustrate complex ideas and concepts in ways that are comprehensible or striking to its viewers, readers, or listeners.

Writers or speakers typically use allegories as [[literary device]]s or as [[rhetoric]]al devices that convey hidden meanings through [[symbol]]ic figures, actions, imagery, and/or events, which together create the moral, spiritual, or political meaning the author wishes to convey.<ref>[http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms_A.html]</ref>

One of the best-known examples of allegory, [[Plato]]'s [[Allegory of the Cave]], forms a part of his larger work ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]].'' In this allegory, Plato describes a group of people who have lived chained in a cave all of their lives, facing a blank wall (514a-b). The people watch shadows projected on the wall by things passing in front of a fire behind them and begin to ascribe forms to these shadows, using language to identify their world (514c-515a). According to the allegory, the shadows are as close as the prisoners get to viewing reality, until one of them finds his way into the outside world where he sees the actual objects that produced the shadows. He tries to tell the people in the cave of his discovery, but they do not believe him and vehemently resist his efforts to free them so they can see for themselves (516e-518a). This allegory is, on a basic level, about a philosopher who upon finding greater knowledge outside the cave of human understanding, seeks to share it as is his duty, and the foolishness of those who would ignore him because they think themselves educated enough.<ref>

[[File:Salvator Rosa (Italian - Allegory of Fortune - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail||[[Salvator Rosa]]:  ''[[Allegory of Fortune]]'', representing [[Fortuna]], the Goddess of luck, with the [[Cornucopia|horn of plenty]]  ]]
First attested in English in 1382, the word ''allegory'' comes from [[Latin]] ''allegoria'', the [[latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀλληγορία (''allegoria''), "veiled language, figurative,"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29llhgori%2Fa ἀλληγορία],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref> which in turn comes from both ἄλλος (''allos''), "another, different"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29%2Fllos1 ἄλλος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref> and ἀγορεύω (''agoreuo''), "to harangue, to speak in the assembly"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29goreu%2Fw ἀγορεύω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref> which originate from ἀγορά (''agora''), "assembly".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29gora%2F ἀγορά], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref>

==Types==
[[Northrop Frye]] discussed what he termed a "continuum of allegory", a spectrum that ranges from what he termed the "naive allegory" of ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', to the more private allegories of modern [[paradox (literature)|paradox literature]].<ref>[Frye, Northrop. Anatomy of Criticism. Princeton, NJ: Princeton UP, 1957. Print.]</ref> In this perspective, the characters in a "naive" allegory are not fully three-dimensional, for each aspect of their individual personalities and the events that befall them embodies some moral quality or other abstraction; the allegory has been selected first, and the details merely flesh it out.

Many ancient religions are based on [[astrological allegory|astrological allegories]], that is, allegories of the movement of the sun and the moon as seen from the Earth. Examples include the cult of [[Horus]]/[[Isis]].

==Classical allegory==

In classical literature two of the best-known allegories are [[Allegory of the Cave|the Cave]] in Plato's ''[[Republic]]'' (Book VII) and the story of the stomach and its members in the speech of Menenius Agrippa ([[Livy]] ii. 32). In Late Antiquity [[Martianus Capella]] organized all the information a fifth-century upper-class male needed to know into an allegory of the wedding of Mercury and ''Philologia,'' with the seven [[liberal arts]] the young man needed to know as guests.<ref>[Capella, Martianus, William Harris. Stahl, Richard Johnson, and E. L. Burge. The Marriage of Philology and Mercury. New York: Columbia UP, 1977. Print.]</ref>

Other early allegories are found in the [[Hebrew Bible]], such as the extended metaphor in [[Psalm 80]] of the [[Grapevine|Vine]] and its impressive spread and growth, representing Israel's conquest and peopling of the Promised Land.<ref>{{cite book | last = Kennedy | first = George A. | year = 1999 | title = Classical Rhetoric and Its Christian and Secular Tradition from Ancient to Modern Times | edition = Second | publisher = UNC Press | page = 142 | isbn = 0-8078-4769-0 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=LHHYx4idyPEC&pg=PA142 | accessdate = 2009-08-07}}</ref> Also allegorical is [[Ezekiel]] 16 and 17, wherein the capture of that same vine by the mighty Eagle represents Israel's exile to Rome.<ref>{{cite book | editor = Jones, Alexander | year = 1968 | title = The Jerusalem Bible | edition = Reader's | publisher = Doubleday & Company | pages =1186, 1189 | isbn = 0-385-01156-3}}</ref>

{{Main|Allegory in the Middle Ages}}
Allegory has an ability to freeze the temporality of a story, while infusing it with a spiritual context. Medieval thinking accepted allegory as having a ''reality'' underlying any rhetorical or fictional uses. The allegory was as true as the facts of surface appearances. Thus, the Papal Bull ''[[Unam Sanctam]]'' (1302) presents themes of the unity of [[Christendom]] with the pope as its head in which the allegorical details of the metaphors are adduced as facts on which is based a demonstration with the vocabulary of logic: "''Therefore'' of this one and only Church there is one body and one head—not two heads as if it were a monster... If, then, the Greeks or others say that they were not committed to the care of Peter and his successors, they ''necessarily'' confess that they are not of the sheep of Christ." This text also demonstrates the frequent use of allegory in religious texts during the Medieval Period, following the tradition and example of the Bible.

In the late 15th century, the enigmatic ''[[Hypnerotomachia]]'', with its elaborate woodcut illustrations, shows the influence of themed pageants and [[masque]]s on contemporary allegorical representation, as [[Renaissance humanism|humanist dialectic]] conveyed them.

The denial of medieval allegory as found in the 11th-century works of [[Hugh of St Victor]] and [[Edward Topsell]]'s ''Historie of Foure-footed Beastes'' (London, 1607, 1653) and its replacement in the study of nature with methods of categorization and mathematics by such figures as naturalist [[John Ray]] and the astronomer [[Galileo]] is thought to mark the beginnings of early modern science.<ref>[[Peter Harrison (historian)|Peter Harrison]], ''The Bible, Protestantism, and the rise of natural science'', [[Cambridge University Press]], ISBN 0-521-59196-1, pages 1 to 10 ("Introduction")</ref>

==Modern allegory==

Since meaningful stories are nearly always applicable to larger issues, allegories may be read into many stories which the author may not have recognized. This is allegoresis, or the act of reading a story as an allegory. For instance, many people have suggested that ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' is an allegory for the [[world war|World Wars]], although Tolkien has dismissed this. Other examples of allegory in popular culture that may or may not have been intended include the works of [[Bertolt Brecht]], and even some works of science fiction and fantasy, such as ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' by [[C.S. Lewis]] and ''[[Mark Helprin#Works|A Kingdom Far and Clear: The Complete Swan Lake Trilogy]]'' by [[Mark Helprin]].

==Poetry and fiction==

[[File:Allegory of Arithmetic - detail.JPG|thumb|''Allegory of [[Arithmetic]]'', by [[Laurent de La Hyre]], c. 1650]]
It is important to note that while allegoresis may make discovery of allegory in any work, not every resonant work of modern fiction is allegorical, and some are clearly not intended to be viewed this way. According to Henry Littlefield's 1964 article, [[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'',  may be readily understood as a plot-driven fantasy narrative in an extended fable with talking animals and broadly sketched characters, intended to discuss the politics of the time.<ref>[Littlefield, Henry (1964). "The Wizard of Oz: Parable on Populism". American Quarterly 16 (1): 47–58. doi:10.2307/2710826.]</ref> Yet, [[George MacDonald]] emphasized in 1893 that, "A fairy tale is not an allegory," in direct reference to ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''.<ref name="Baum2000">{{cite book|author=Lyman Frank Baum|title=The Annotated Wizard of Oz: The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bpkVEAaUuMkC&pg=PA101|year=2000|publisher=Norton|isbn=978-0-393-04992-3|page=101}}</ref> [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings]] is another example of a well-known work sometimes perceived as allegorical, yet as the author himself once stated, "...I cordially dislike allegory in all of its manifestations and I have always done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence."<ref name="BogstadKaveny2011">{{cite book|author1=Janice M. Bogstad| author2=Philip E. Kaveny| title=Picturing Tolkien: Essays on Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings Film Trilogy| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jNjKrXRP0G8C&pg=PA189 | date=9 August 2011| publisher=McFarland| isbn=978-0-7864-8473-7| page=189}}</ref>  While this does not mean his works may not be treated as having allegorical themes, especially when reinterpreted through postmodern sensibilities, it at least suggests that none were conscious in his writings. This further reinforces the idea of forced allegoresis, as allegory is often a matter of interpretation and only sometimes of original artistic intention.

Like allegorical stories, allegorical poetry has two meanings – a literal meaning and a symbolic meaning. Some unique specimens of allegory in poetry can be found in the following works:
*[[Edmund Spenser]] &ndash; ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'': The several knights in the poem actually stand for several virtues.
*[[John Bunyan]] &ndash; ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'': The journey of the protagonists Christian and Evangelist symbolises the ascension of the soul from earth to Heaven.
*[[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] &ndash; ''[[Young Goodman Brown]]'': The Devil's Staff symbolises defiance of God. The characters' names, such as ''Goodman'' and ''Faith'', ironically serve as paradox in the conclusion of the story.
*[[George Orwell]] &ndash; ''[[Animal Farm]]'': The pigs stand for political figures of the [[Russian Revolution]].
*[[László Krasznahorkai]] - ''[[The Melancholy of Resistance]]'' and the film ''[[Werckmeister Harmonies]]'': It uses a circus to describe an occupying dysfunctional government.
*[[Edgar Allan Poe]] &ndash; ''[[The Masque of the Red Death]]'': The story can be read as an allegory how no one can evade death.<ref>[Roppolo, Joseph Patrick. "Meaning and 'The Masque of the Red Death'", collected in Poe: A Collection of Critical Essays, edited by Robert Regan. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1967. p. 137]</ref>
