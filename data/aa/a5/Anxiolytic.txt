An '''anxiolytic''' (also '''antipanic''' or '''antianxiety agent''')<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/100020674|antianxiety agent}}</ref> is a medication or other intervention that inhibits [[anxiety]]. This effect is in contrast to [[anxiogenic]] agents, which increase anxiety.  Together these categories of [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] compounds or interventions may be referred to as [[anxiotropic]] compounds/agents. Some [[Recreational drug use|recreational drugs]] such as [[ethanol]] ([[ethanol|alcohol]]) induce anxiolysis initially, however studies show that many of these drugs are anxiogenic. Anxiolytic [[medication]]s have been used for the treatment of [[anxiety]] and its related psychological and physical symptoms. Anxiolytics have been shown to be useful in the treatment of [[anxiety disorder]]s. [[Light therapy]] and other interventions have also been found to have an anxiolytic effect.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1471-244X-7-62 |title=Does bright  light have an anxiolytic effect? - an open trial |year=2007 |last1=Youngstedt |first1=Shawn D |last2=Kripke |first2=Daniel F |journal=BMC Psychiatry |volume=7 |pages=62 |pmid=17971237 |pmc=2194679}}</ref>

[[Beta-receptor blocker]]s such as [[propranolol]] and [[oxprenolol]], although not anxiolytics, can be used to combat the [[Somatopsychic|somatic]] symptoms of anxiety, as [[tachycardia]] and [[palpitation]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Beta-blockers in anxiety disorders |author=Peggy E.

Anxiolytics are also known as '''minor [[tranquilizer]]s'''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.memidex.com/anxiolytic+tranquilizer|title=anxiolytic (tranquilizer)|work=Memidex (WordNet) Dictionary/Thesaurus |accessdate=2010-12-02}}</ref> The term is less common in modern texts, and was originally derived from a dichotomy with [[major tranquilizer]]s, also known as [[neuroleptics]] or [[antipsychotics]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

However, even with CBT being a viable treatment option, it can still be ineffective for many individuals. Both the Canadian and American medical associations then suggest the use of a strong but long lasting benzodiazepine such as [[clonazepam]] and [[alprazolam]] and an antidepressant, usually [[Prozac]] for its effectiveness.<ref>CMA & AMA Home medical guides 2012 & 2014, along with personal experiences and WebMD reviews</ref>{{Unreliable source?|certain=y|reason=Self-explanatory|date=September 2015}}{{OR|date=September 2015}}

Note that adolescent anxiety once the patient becomes pubescent can often turn into depression, at which time other treatments may be required.{{citation needed|reason=Source?|date=September 2015}}

==Medications==

===Barbiturates===
{{Main|Barbiturate}}

[[Barbiturate]]s exert an anxiolytic effect linked to the sedation they cause. The risk of abuse and addiction is high. Many experts consider these drugs obsolete for treating anxiety but valuable for the short-term treatment of severe insomnia, though only after benzodiazepines or non-benzodiazepines have failed.

===Benzodiazepines===
{{Main|Benzodiazepine}}

Benzodiazepines are prescribed for short-term relief of severe and disabling anxiety. Benzodiazepines may also be indicated to cover the latent periods associated with the medications prescribed to treat an underlying anxiety disorder. They are used to treat a wide variety of conditions and symptoms and are usually a first choice when short-term [[Central nervous system|CNS]] [[sedation]] is needed. Longer-term uses include treatment for severe anxiety. 
If benzodiazepines are discontinued rapidly after being taken daily for two or more weeks there is a risk of [[benzodiazepine withdrawal]] and [[rebound syndrome]], and tolerance and dependence may also occur, but may be clinically acceptable.<ref>Gelder, M, Mayou, R. and Geddes, J. 2005. Psychiatry. 3rd ed. New York: Oxford. pp236.</ref> There is also the added problem of the accumulation of drug [[metabolite]]s and adverse effects.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lader M, Tylee A, Donoghue J |title=Withdrawing benzodiazepines in primary care |journal=CNS Drugs |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=19–34 |year=2009 |pmid=19062773 |doi=10.2165/0023210-200923010-00002 |url=}}</ref> Benzodiazepines include:

* [[Alprazolam]] (Xanax)
* [[Bromazepam]] (Lectopam, Lexotan)
* [[Chlordiazepoxide]] (Librium)
* [[Clonazepam]] (Klonopin, Rivotril)
* [[Clorazepate]] (Tranxene)
* [[Diazepam]] (Valium)
* [[Flurazepam]] (Dalmane)
* [[Lorazepam]] (Ativan)
* [[Oxazepam]] (Serax, Serapax)
* [[Temazepam]] (Restoril)
* [[Triazolam]] (Halcion)

Benzodiazepines exert their anxiolytic properties at moderate dosage. At higher dosage [[hypnotic]] properties occur.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1590/S0004-282X2005000300009 |title=Neuromodulatory effects of caffeine and bromazepam on visual event-related potential (P300): A comparative study |year=2005 |last1=Montenegro |first1=Mariana |last2=Veiga |first2=Heloisa |last3=Deslandes |first3=Andréa |last4=Cagy |first4=Maurício |last5=McDowell |first5=Kaleb |last6=Pompeu |first6=Fernando |last7=Piedade |first7=Roberto |last8=Ribeiro |first8=Pedro |journal=Arquivos de Neuro-Psiquiatria |volume=63 |issue=2b |pages=410–5 |pmid=16059590}}</ref>

* [[Tofisopam]] (Emandaxin and Grandaxin) is a drug that is a benzodiazepine derivative. Like other benzodiazepines, it possesses anxiolytic properties, but, unlike other benzodiazepines, it does not have anticonvulsant, sedative, skeletal muscle relaxant, motor skill-impairing, or amnestic properties.

=== Antidepressants ===

==== Serotonergic antidepressants ====
[[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] or '''serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitor'''<ref name="BARLOW">{{cite book |author=Barlow, David H. Durand, V. Mark |title=Abnormal Psychology: An Integrative Approach |edition=Fifth |page=239 |chapter=Chapter 7: Mood Disorders and Suicide |isbn=0-495-09556-7 |oclc=192055408 |location=Belmont, CA |publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning |year=2009}}</ref> ('''SSRIs''') are a class of compounds typically used as [[antidepressant]]s in the treatment of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[anxiety disorder]]s, and some [[personality disorder]]s. SSRIs are primarily classified as antidepressants and typically higher dosages are required to be effective against [[anxiety disorders]] than to be effective against depression; nevertheless, most SSRIs have anxiolytic properties. They can, however, be [[anxiogenic]] early on in the course of treatment due to negative feedback through the serotonergic [[autoreceptors]]. For this reason in some individuals a low dose concurrent benzodiazepine therapy might be beneficial during the early stages of serotonergic therapy to counteract the initial anxiogenic effects current serotonergics antidepressants have.

==== Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ====
[[Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]] include [[venlafaxine]] and [[duloxetine]] drugs. Venlafaxine, in [[extended release]] form, and duloxetine, are indicated for the treatment of [[Generalized anxiety disorder|GAD]]. SSNRIs are as effective as SSRIs in the treatment of anxiety disorders.<ref name=Vanin>{{cite book |title=Anxiety Disorders: A Pocket Guide For Primary Care |author=John Vanin, James Helsley |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |date=19 June 2008 |page=189}}</ref>

==== Tricyclic antidepressant ====
Older [[tricyclic antidepressants]] (TCAs) are anxiolytic too; however, their side effects are often more severe in nature. Examples include [[imipramine]], [[doxepin]], [[amitriptyline]], and the unrelated [[trazodone]].{{mcn|date=October 2015}}

==== Tetracyclic antidepressant ====

[[Mirtazapine]] has demonstrated anxiolytic effects with a better side effect profile to all other classes of antidepressants, for example it rarely causes or exacerbates anxiety. However, it in many countries (such as USA and Australia) it is not specifically approved for anxiety disorders and is only used off label.

==== Monoamine oxidase inhibitors ====
[[Monoamine oxidase inhibitors]] (MAOIs) are very effective for anxiety, but due to drug dangers, are rarely prescribed. Examples include: [[phenelzine]] and [[tranylcypromine]]. A reversible MAOI, which has none of the dietary restrictions associated with classic MAOI's, [[moclobemide]] is used in Canada and the UK as ′Manerix′ and in Australia as ′Aurorix′ which have none of the more severe [[SSRI]]'s and [[SNRI]]'s caused [[SSRI discontinuation syndrome]], an often overlooked and damaging syndrome which is objectively and subjectively as bad or, for some, even worse than [[Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]].{{mcn|date=October 2015}}

===Beta blockers===
Although not officially approved for this purpose, [[Beta blocker]]s also can have an antianxiety effect.<ref>Jefferson, J. W. (1974). Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking drugs in psychiatry.

=== Miscellaneous ===

==== Alpha-adrenergic agonist ====
Alpha 2A receptor agonists [[Clonidine]] and [[Guanfacine]] has demonstrated both anxiolytic and anxiogenic effects.

==== Mebicar ====
[[Mebicar]] (mebicarum) is an anxiolytic produced in [[Latvia]] and used in Eastern Europe. Mebicar has an effect on the structure of limbic-reticular activity, particularly on [[hypothalamus]] emotional zone, as well as on all 4 basic neuromediator systems –  [[gamma-aminobutyric acid|γ aminobutyric acid]] (GABA), [[choline]], [[serotonin]] and adrenergic activity.<ref>{{cite web |title=Adaptol.

====Selank====
[[Selank]] is an anxiolytic peptide based drug developed by the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Russian academy of sciences. Selank is a heptapeptide with the sequence Thr-Lys-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gly-Pro. It is a synthetic [[structural analog|analog]] of a human tetrapeptide [[tuftsin]]. As such, it mimics many of its effects. It has been shown to modulate the expression of [[interleukin-6]] (IL-6) and affect the balance of T helper cell cytokines. There is evidence that it may also modulate the expression of [[brain-derived neurotropic factor]] in rats.{{mcn|date=October 2015}}

====Bromantane====
[[Bromantane]] is a stimulant drug with anxiolytic properties developed in Russia during the late 1980s, which acts mainly by inhibiting the reuptake of both dopamine and serotonin in the brain, although it also has anticholinergic effects at very high doses. Study results suggest that the combination of psychostimulant and anxiolytic actions in the spectrum of psychotropic activity of bromantane is effective in treating asthenic disorders compared to placebo.

====Emoxypine====
[[Emoxypine]] is an [[antioxidant]] that is also an anxiolytic. Its chemical structure resembles that of [[pyridoxine]], a type of vitamin B<sub>6</sub>.

====Azapirones====
Azapirones are a class of [[5-HT1A receptor|5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor]] [[agonist]]s.  Currently approved azapirones include [[buspirone]] (Buspar) and [[tandospirone]] (Sediel).

====Hydroxyzine====
[[Hydroxyzine]] (Atarax) is an old [[antihistamine]] originally approved for clinical use by the FDA in 1956. It possesses anxiolytic properties in addition to its antihistamine properties and is also licensed for the treatment of anxiety and tension. It is also used for its sedative properties as a premed before anesthesia or to induce sedation after anesthesia.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.medicinenet.com/hydroxyzine/article.htm|title= hydroxyzine (Vistaril, Atarax)|accessdate= 17 May 2008|author= medicine net|publisher= medicinenet.com| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080513104646/http://www.medicinenet.com/hydroxyzine/article.htm| archivedate= 13 May 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> It has been shown to be as effective as [[benzodiazepines]] in the treatment of [[generalized anxiety disorder]], while producing fewer side-effects.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Llorca PM, Spadone C, Sol O |title=Efficacy and safety of hydroxyzine in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder: a 3-month double-blind study |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=63 |issue=11 |pages=1020–7 |date=November 2002 |pmid=12444816 |doi=10.4088/JCP.v63n1112}}</ref>

====Pregabalin====
[[Pregabalin]]'s therapeutic effect appears after 1 week of use and is similar in effectiveness to [[lorazepam]], [[alprazolam]], and [[venlafaxine]], but pregabalin has demonstrated superiority by producing more consistent therapeutic effects for psychic and somatic anxiety symptoms. Long-term trials have shown continued effectiveness without the development of [[drug tolerance|tolerance]], and, in addition, unlike benzodiazepines, it does not disrupt [[sleep architecture]] and produces less severe cognitive and psychomotor impairment; it also has a low potential for abuse and dependence and may be preferred over the benzodiazepines for these reasons.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Bandelow | first1 = B. | last2 = Wedekind | first2 = D. | last3 = Leon | first3 = T. | title = Pregabalin for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder: a novel pharmacologic intervention | journal = Expert Rev Neurother | volume = 7 | issue = 7 | pages = 769–81 |date=Jul 2007 | doi = 10.1586/14737175.7.7.769 | pmid = 17610384 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Owen | first1 = RT. | title = Pregabalin: its efficacy, safety and tolerability profile in generalized anxiety | journal = Drugs Today (Barc) | volume = 43 | issue = 9 | pages = 601–10 |date=Sep 2007 | doi = 10.1358/dot.2007.43.9.1133188 | pmid = 17940637 }}</ref>

==== Menthyl isovalerate ====
[[Menthyl isovalerate]] is a flavoring food additive which is marketed as a sedative and anxiolytic drug in Russia under the name ''Validol''. Sublingual administration of ''Validol'' produces a sedative effect, and has moderate reflex and vascular dilative action caused by stimulation of sensory nerve receptors of the oral mucosa followed by the release of endorphins. ''Validol'' is typically administered ''as needed'' for symptom relief.<ref>The Great Soviet Encyclopedia http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Validol{{full|date=November 2014}}</ref><ref>Farmak Product Information - Validol http://farmak.ua/assets_images/drugs/instruction/en/25/Validol_Product_Information.pdf{{full|date=November 2014}}</ref><ref>Itop Doctor http://doctor.itop.net/DirectoryItem.aspx?DirId=1&ItemId=268{{full|date=November 2014}}</ref>

====Cannabidiol====
Cannabidiol (CBD) is a cannabinoid produced by ''[[Cannabis sativa]]'' and ''[[Cannabis indica]]'', and in marginal quantities by ''[[Cannabis ruderalis]]''. It is available in the [[United States]] in states where cannabis has been legalized for medical and general use. No [[lethal dose]] (or LD50) has been established from cannabidiol. In feral strains of cannabis, cannabidiol is produced in large quantities alongside the psychoactive cannabinoid [[THC|tetrahydrocannabinol]]. Special strains of cannabis have been bred to yield high amounts of cannabidiol with significantly lowered synthesis of THC. Specific formulations for anxiety with a CBD to THC ratio of 18:1 are available in the US markets.

====Tetrahydrocannabinol====

[[THC|Tetrahydrocannabinol]] appears to be capable of both, having anxiolytic effect(s) and having anxiogenic effect(s).

====Racetams====
Some  [[racetam]] based drugs such as  [[aniracetam]] can have an antianxiety effect.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Malykh AG |author2=Sadaie MR |title=Piracetam and piracetam-like drugs: from basic science to novel clinical applications to CNS disorders. |journal=Drugs. |volume=70 |issue=3 |pages=287–312 |date=Feb 2010 |pmid=20166767 |doi=10.2165/11319230-000000000-00000}}</ref>

===Future drugs===
Due to deficits with existing anxiolytics (either in terms of efficacy or side-effect profile), research into novel anxiolytics is active. Possible candidates for future drugs include:

* [[BNC210]]
* [[CL-218,872]]
* [[L-838,417]]
* [[SL-651,498]]
* [[S32212]]
* [[PH94B]]

===Common drugs===
Prescription-free drugs are often poor anxiolytics and often worsen the symptoms over time{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}. However, they are often used for self-medication because of their wide availability (e.g. [[alcoholic beverages]]).

====Alcohol====
{{See also|Short-term effects of alcohol}}

Ethanol is used as an anxiolytic, sometimes by [[self-medication]]. [[fMRI]] can measure the anxiolytic effects of alcohol in the human brain.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0086-08.2008 |title=Why We Like to Drink: A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study of the Rewarding and Anxiolytic Effects of Alcohol |year=2008 |last1=Gilman |first1=J. M. |last2=Ramchandani |first2=V. A. |last3=Davis |first3=M. B. |last4=Bjork |first4=J. M. |last5=Hommer |first5=D. W. |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |volume=28 |issue=18 |pages=4583–91 |pmid=18448634 |pmc=2730732}}</ref>  The [[British National Formulary]] states, "Alcohol is a poor hypnotic because its [[diuretic]] action interferes with [[sleep]] during the latter part of the night." Alcohol is also known to induce alcohol-related [[sleep disorder]]s.<ref>http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa41.htm{{full|date=November 2014}}</ref>

====Inhalants====
{{see also|Inhalant abuse#Patterns of non-medical usage|Street children in Latin America#Drugs}}

The anxiolytic effects of solvents act as positive modulators of GABAA receptors (Bowen and colleagues 2006).<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Matthew O. |last1=Howard |first2=Scott E. |last2=Bowen |first3=Eric L. |last3=Garland |first4=Brian E. |last4=Perron |first5=Michael G. |last5=Vaughn |pmid=22003419 |year=2011 |title=Inhalant use and inhalant use disorders in the United States |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=18–31 |pmc=3188822 |journal=Addiction science & clinical practice}}</ref>
