Imprisoned after Robespierre's fall from power, he aligned himself with yet another political regime upon his release: that of<space/><link><target>Napoleon I of France</target><part>Napoleon</part></link>, The First Consul of France.

After Napoleon's fall from Imperial power and the Bourbon revival, David exiled himself to<space/><link><target>Brussels</target></link>, then in the<space/><link><target>United Kingdom of the Netherlands</target></link>, where he remained until his death. David had<space/><link><target>:Category:Pupils of Jacques-Louis David</target><part>a large number of pupils</part></link>, making him the strongest influence in French art of the early 19th century, especially academic<space/><link><target>Paris Salon</target><part>Salon</part></link><space/>painting.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Early life</heading><paragraph>Jacques-Louis David was born into a prosperous family in Paris on 30 August 1748. When he was about nine his father was killed in a duel and his mother left him with his prosperous architect uncles. They saw to it that he received an excellent education at the<space/><link><target>Collge des Quatre-Nations</target></link>,<space/><link><target>University of Paris</target></link>, but he was never a good student: he had a facial tumor that impeded his speech, and he was always preoccupied with drawing. He covered his notebooks with drawings, and he once said, &quot;I was always hiding behind the instructor's chair, drawing for the duration of the class&quot;. Soon, he desired to be a painter, but his uncles and mother wanted him to be an architect. He overcame the opposition, and went to learn from<space/><link><target>Franois Boucher</target></link><space/>(17031770), the leading painter of the time, who was also a distant relative. Boucher was a<space/><link><target>Rococo</target></link><space/>painter, but tastes were changing, and the fashion for Rococo was giving way to a more classical style. Boucher decided that instead of taking over David's tutelage, he would send David to his friend<space/><link><target>Joseph-Marie Vien</target></link><space/>(17161809), a painter who embraced the classical reaction to Rococo. There David attended the<space/><link><target>Acadmie de peinture et de sculpture</target><part>Royal Academy</part></link>, based in what is now the<space/><link><target>Louvre</target></link>.<link><target>File:Mademoiselle Guimard as Terpsichore, by Jacques-Louis David.jpg</target><part>thumbnail</part><part>upright</part><part>''Mademoiselle Guimard as Terpsichore'', 17745, an early work</part></link>Each year the Academy awarded an outstanding student the prestigious<space/><link><target>Prix de Rome</target></link>, which funded a three- to five-year stay in the Eternal City. The culmination of the Academy's educational program, the Rome trip provided its winners the opportunity to study the remains of classical antiquity and the works of the Italian Renaissance masters at first hand. Each<space/><italics>pensionnaire</italics><space/>was lodged in the French Academy's Roman outpost, which from the years 1737 to 1793 was the Palazzo Mancini in the Via del Corso. David competed for, and failed to win, the prize for three consecutive years (with<space/><italics><link><target>Minerva Fighting Mars</target></link></italics>,<space/><italics><link><target>Diana and Apollo Killing Niobe's Children</target></link></italics><space/>and<space/><italics><link><target>The Death of Seneca (David)</target><part>The Death of Seneca</part></link></italics>), each failure contributing to his lifelong grudge against the institution. After his second loss in 1772, David went on a hunger strike, which lasted two and a half days before the faculty encouraged him to continue painting. Confident he now had the support and backing needed to win the prize, he resumed his studies with great zealonly to fail to win the Prix de Rome again the following year. Finally, in 1774, David was awarded the Prix de Rome on the strength of his painting of<space/><italics><link><target>Erasistratus Discovering the Cause of Antiochus' Disease</target></link></italics>, a subject set by the judges. In October 1775 he made the journey to Italy with his mentor, Joseph-Marie Vien, who had just been appointed director of the<space/><link><target>French Academy in Rome</target><part>French Academy at Rome</part></link>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Oxford"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>While in Italy, David especially studied the works of 17th-century masters such as<space/><link><target>Nicolas Poussin</target><part>Poussin</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Caravaggio</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>the Carracci</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Oxford"></extension><space/>Although he declared, &quot;the Antique will not seduce me, it lacks animation, it does not move&quot;,<extension extension_name='ref' name="Oxford"></extension><space/>David filled twelve sketchbooks with drawings that he and his studio used as model books for the rest of his life. He was introduced to the painter<space/><link><target>Raphael Mengs</target></link><space/>(17281779), who opposed the tendency in Rococo painting to sweeten and trivialize ancient subjects, advocating instead the rigorous study of classical sources and close adherence to ancient models. Mengs' principled, historicizing approach to the representation of classical subjects profoundly influenced David's pre-revolutionary painting, such as<space/><italics><link><target>The Vestal Virgin (David)</target><part>The Vestal Virgin</part></link></italics>, probably from the 1780s. Mengs also introduced David to the theoretical writings on ancient sculpture by<space/><link><target>Johann Joachim Winckelmann</target></link><space/>(17171768), the German scholar held to be the founder of modern art history.<extension extension_name='ref'>Alex Potts,<space/><italics>Flesh and the Ideal: Winckelmann and the Origins of Art History</italics><space/>(New Haven: Yale University Press, 2000).</extension><space/>In 1779, David toured the newly excavated ruins of<space/><link><target>Pompeii</target></link>, which deepened his belief that the persistence of classical culture was an index of its eternal conceptual and formal power.

David's stay at the French Academy in Rome was extended by a year, but in July 1780 he returned to Paris.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Oxford"></extension><space/>There, he found people ready to use their influence for him, and he was made a member of the Royal Academy. He sent the Academy two paintings, and both were included in the<space/><link><target>Paris Salon</target><part>Salon</part></link><space/>of 1781, a high honor. He was praised by his famous contemporary painters, but the administration of the Royal Academy was very hostile to this young upstart. After the Salon, the King granted David lodging in the Louvre, an ancient and much desired privilege of great artists. When the contractor of the King's buildings, M. Pcoul, was arranging with David, he asked the artist to marry his daughter, Marguerite Charlotte. This marriage brought him money and eventually four children. David had his own pupils, about 40 to 50, and was commissioned by the government to paint &quot;Horace defended by his Father&quot;, but he soon decided, &quot;Only in Rome can I paint Romans.&quot; His father-in-law provided the money he needed for the trip, and David headed for Rome with his wife and three of his students, one of whom,<space/><link><target>Jean-Germain Drouais</target></link><space/>(17631788), was the Prix de Rome winner of that year.<link><target>File:Jacques-Louis David - Oath of the Horatii - Google Art Project.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>''<link><target>Oath of the Horatii</target></link>'' (from 1786)</part></link>In Rome, David painted his famous<space/><italics><link><target>Oath of the Horatii</target></link></italics>, 1784.

The Count in charge of the appointments said David was too young, but said he would support him in 6 to 12 years. This situation would be one of many that would cause him to lash out at the Academy in years to come.</paragraph><paragraph>For the Salon of 1787, David exhibited his famous<space/><italics><link><target>The Death of Socrates</target><part>Death of Socrates</part></link></italics>. &quot;Condemned to death, Socrates, strong, calm and at peace, discusses the immortality of the soul. Surrounded by Crito, his grieving friends and students, he is teaching, philosophizing, and in fact, thanking the God of Health, Asclepius, for the<space/><link><target>Conium</target><part>hemlock</part></link><space/>brew which will ensure a peaceful death... The wife of Socrates can be seen grieving alone outside the chamber, dismissed for her weakness. Plato is depicted as an old man seated at the end of the bed.&quot; Critics compared the Socrates with<space/><link><target>Michelangelo</target></link>'s<space/><link><target>Sistine Chapel</target><part>Sistine Ceiling</part></link><space/>and Raphael's Stanze, and one, after ten visits to the Salon, described it as &quot;in every sense perfect&quot;.<space/><link><target>Denis Diderot</target></link><space/>said it looked like he copied it from some ancient<space/><link><target>bas-relief</target></link>. The painting was very much in tune with the political climate at the time. For this painting, David was not honored by a royal &quot;works of encouragement&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:David Brutus.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>''<link><target>The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons</target></link>'' (1789)</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>For his next painting, David created<space/><italics><link><target>The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons</target></link></italics>. The work had tremendous appeal for the time. Before the opening of the Salon, the<space/><link><target>French Revolution</target></link><space/>had begun. The<space/><link><target>National Assembly (French Revolution)</target><part>National Assembly</part></link><space/>had been established, and the<space/><link><target>Bastille</target></link><space/>had fallen. The royal court did not want propaganda agitating the people, so all paintings had to be checked before being hung. David's<space/><link><target>Portrait of Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier and his wife</target><part>portrait of Lavoisier</part></link>, who was a chemist and physicist as well as an active member of the Jacobin party, was banned by the authorities for such reasons.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Harvnb</target><arg>Honour</arg><arg>1977</arg><arg name="p">72</arg></template>.</extension><space/>When the newspapers reported that the government had not allowed the showing of<space/><italics>The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons</italics>, the people were outraged, and the royals were forced to give in. The painting was hung in the exhibition, protected by art students. The painting depicts<space/><link><target>Lucius Junius Brutus</target></link>, the Roman leader, grieving for his sons. Brutus's sons had attempted to overthrow the government and restore the monarchy, so the father ordered their death to maintain the republic. Thus, Brutus was the heroic defender of the republic, at the cost of his own family. On the right, the Mother holds her two daughters, and the nurse is seen on the far right, in anguish. Brutus sits on the left, alone, brooding, seemingly dismissing the dead bodies of his sons. Knowing what he did was best for his country, but the tense posture of his feet and toes reveals his inner turmoil. The whole painting was a Republican symbol, and obviously had immense meaning during these times in France.</paragraph><heading level='2'>The French Revolution</heading><paragraph>In the beginning, David was a supporter of the Revolution, a friend of<space/><link><target>Robespierre</target></link><space/>and a member of the<space/><link><target>Jacobin Club</target></link>. While others were leaving the country for new and greater opportunities, David stayed to help destroy the old order; he was a regicide who voted in the National Convention for the Execution of<space/><link><target>Louis XVI of France</target><part>Louis XVI</part></link>. It is uncertain why he did this,<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">July 2015</arg></template><space/>as there were many more opportunities for him under the King than the new order; some people suggest David's love for the classical made him embrace everything about that period, including a republican government.</paragraph><preblock><preline></preline></preblock><paragraph>Others believed that they found the key to the artist's revolutionary career in his personality. Undoubtedly, David's artistic sensibility, mercurial temperament, volatile emotions, ardent enthusiasm, and fierce independence might have been expected to help turn him against the established order but they did not fully explain his devotion to the republican regime. Nor did the vague statements of those who insisted upon his &quot;powerful ambition... and unusual energy of will&quot; actually account for his revolutionary connections. Those who knew him maintained that &quot;generous ardor&quot;, high-minded idealism and well-meaning, though sometimes fanatical, enthusiasm rather than selfishness and jealousy, motivated his activities during this period.</paragraph><paragraph>Soon, David turned his critical sights on the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. This attack was probably caused primarily by the hypocrisy of the organization and their personal opposition against his work, as seen in previous episodes in David's life. The Royal Academy was chock full of royalists, and David's attempt to reform it did not go over well with the members. However, the deck was stacked against this symbol of the old regime, and the National Assembly ordered it to make changes to conform to the new constitution.</paragraph><paragraph>David then began work on something that would later hound him: propaganda for the new republic. David's painting of Brutus was shown during the play<space/><italics>Brutus</italics>, by the famous Frenchman,<space/><link><target>Voltaire</target></link>. The people responded in an uproar of approval.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1789, Jacques-Louis David attempted to leave his artistic mark on the historical beginnings of the French Revolution with his painting of<space/><italics><link><target>Tennis Court Oath</target><part>The Oath of the Tennis Court</part></link></italics>. David undertook this task not out of personal political conviction but rather because he was commissioned to do so. The painting was meant to commemorate the event of the same name but was never completed. A meeting of the Estates General was convened in May to address reforms of the monarchy. Dissent arose over whether the three estates would meet separately, as had been tradition, or as one body. The King's acquiescence with the demands of the upper orders led to the deputies of the Third Estate renaming themselves as the<space/><link><target>National Assembly (French Revolution)</target><part>National Assembly</part></link><space/>on 17 June. They were locked out of the meeting hall three days later when they attempted to meet, and forced to reconvene to the royal indoor tennis court. Presided over by Jean-Sylvain Bailly, they made a 'solemn oath never to separate' until a national constitution had been created. In 1789 this event was seen as a symbol of the national unity against the<space/><italics><link><target>Ancien Rgime</target><part>ancien regime</part></link></italics>. David was enlisted by the Society of Friends of the Constitution, the body that would eventually form the Jacobins, to enshrine this symbolic event.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Crow 2007"><template><target>Harvnb</target><arg>Crow</arg><arg>2007</arg></template>.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>This instance is notable in more ways than one because it eventually led David to finally become involved in politics as he joined the Jacobins. The picture was meant to be massive in scale; the figures in the foreground were to be life-sized portraits of the counterparts, including<space/><link><target>Jean-Sylvain Bailly</target></link>, the President of the Constituent Assembly. Seeking additional funding, David turned to the Society of Friends of the Constitution. The funding for the project was to come from over three thousand subscribers hoping to receive a print of the image. However, when the funding was insufficient, the state ended up financing the project.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Oxford">Lee, Simon. &quot;David, Jacques-Louis.&quot; Grove Art Online.

As in the<space/><italics>Oath of the Horatii</italics>, David represents the unity of men in the service of a patriotic ideal. The outstretched arms which are prominent in both works betray David's deeply held belief that acts of republican virtue akin to those of the Romans were being played out in France. In what was essentially an act of intellect and reason, David creates an air of drama in this work. The very power of the people appears to be &quot;blowing&quot; through the scene with the stormy weather, in a sense alluding to the storm that would be the revolution.</paragraph><paragraph>Symbolism in this work of art closely represents the revolutionary events taking place at the time.

However,<space/><link><target>Thomas E. Crow</target><part>Thomas Crow</part></link><space/>argues that this path &quot;proved to be less a way forward than a cul-de-sac for history painting.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="Crow 2007"></extension><space/>Essentially, the history of the demise of David's &quot;The Tennis Court Oath&quot; illustrates the difficulty of creating works of art that portray current and controversial political occurrences. Political circumstances in France proved too volatile to allow the completion of the painting. The unity that was to be symbolized in &quot;The Tennis Court Oath&quot; no longer existed in radicalized 1792. The National Assembly had split between conservatives and radical Jacobins, both vying for political power. By 1792 there was no longer consensus that all the revolutionaries at the tennis court were &quot;heroes.&quot; A sizeable number of the heroes of 1789 had become the villains of 1792. In this unstable political climate David's work remained unfinished. With only a few nude figures sketched onto the massive canvas, David abandoned &quot;The Oath of the Tennis Court.&quot; To have completed it would have been politically unsound. After this incident, when David attempted to make a political statement in his paintings, he returned to the less politically charged use of metaphor to convey his message.</paragraph><paragraph>When Voltaire died in 1778, the church denied him a church burial, and his body was interred near a monastery. A year later, Voltaire's old friends began a campaign to have his body buried in the<space/><link><target>Panthon, Paris</target><part>Panthon</part></link>, as church property had been confiscated by the French Government. In 1791 David was appointed to head the organizing committee for the ceremony, a parade through the streets of Paris to the Panthon. Despite rain, and opposition from conservatives based on the amount of money that was being spent, the procession went ahead. Up to 100,000 people watched the &quot;Father of the Revolution&quot; be carried to his resting place. This was the first of many large festivals organized by David for the republic. He went on to organize festivals for martyrs that died fighting royalists. These funerals echoed the religious festivals of the pagan Greeks and Romans and are seen by many as Saturnalian.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Le reprsentant du peuple Franois en fonction2.jpg</target><part>right</part><part>thumb</part><part>Republican costume designed by David.

The most popular symbol for which David was responsible as propaganda minister was drawn from classical Greek images; changing and transforming them with contemporary politics. In an elaborate festival held on the anniversary of the revolt that brought the monarchy to its knees, David's Hercules figure was revealed in a procession following the lady Liberty (Marianne). Liberty, the symbol of Enlightenment ideals was here being overturned by the Hercules symbol; that of strength and passion for the protection of the Republic against disunity and factionalism.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Harvnb</target><arg>Hunt</arg><arg>2004</arg><arg name="p">97</arg></template>.</extension><space/>In his speech during the procession, David &quot;explicitly emphasized the opposition between people and monarchy; Hercules was chosen, after all, to make this opposition more evident&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Harvnb</target><arg>Hunt</arg><arg>2004</arg><arg name="p">99</arg></template>.</extension><space/>The ideals that David linked to his Hercules single-handedly transformed the figure from a sign of the old regime into a powerful new symbol of revolution. &quot;David turned him into the representation of a collective, popular power. He took one of the favorite signs of monarchy and reproduced, elevated, and monumentalized it into the sign of its opposite.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Harvnb</target><arg>Hunt</arg><arg>2004</arg><arg name="p">103</arg></template>.</extension><space/>Hercules, the image, became to the revolutionaries, something to rally around.</paragraph><paragraph>In June 1791, the King made an ill-fated attempt to flee the country (<link><target>flight to Varennes</target></link>), but was apprehended short of his goal on the Austrian Belgian border and was forced to return under guard to Paris. Louis XVI had made secret requests to Emperor Joseph II of Austria, Marie-Antoinette's brother, to restore him to his throne. This was granted and Austria threatened France if the royal couple were hurt. In reaction, the people arrested the King. This led to an Invasion after the trials and execution of Louis and Marie-Antoinette. The Bourbon monarchy was destroyed by the French people in 1792it would be restored after Napoleon, then destroyed again with the Restoration of the House of Bonaparte. When the new National Convention held its first meeting, David was sitting with his friends<space/><link><target>Jean-Paul Marat</target></link><space/>and Robespierre. In the Convention, David soon earned a nickname &quot;ferocious terrorist&quot;. Soon, Robespierre's agents discovered a secret vault of the king's proving he was trying to overthrow the government, and demanded his execution. The National Convention held the trial of Louis XVI and David voted for the death of the King, causing his wife, a royalist, to divorce him.</paragraph><paragraph>When Louis XVI was executed on 21 January 1793, another man had already died as well<link><target>Louis Michel le Peletier de Saint-Fargeau</target></link>. Le Peletier was killed on the preceding day by a royal bodyguard in revenge for having voted for the death of the King. David was called upon to organize a funeral, and he painted<space/><italics>Le Peletier Assassinated</italics>. In it, the assassin's sword was seen hanging by a single strand of horsehair above Le Peletier's body, a concept inspired by the proverbial ancient tale of the sword of Damocles, which illustrated the insecurity of power and position. This underscored the courage displayed by Le Peletier and his companions in routing an oppressive king.

Marat, a member of the National Convention and a journalist, had a skin disease that caused him to itch horribly. The only relief he could get was in his bath over which he improvised a desk to write his list of suspect counter-revolutionaries who were to be quickly tried and, if convicted, guillotined. David once again organized a spectacular funeral, and Marat was buried in the Panthon. Marat's body was to be placed upon a Roman bed, his wound displayed and his right arm extended holding the pen which he had used to defend the Republic and its people. This concept was to be complicated by the fact that the corpse had begun to putrefy. Marat's body had to be periodically sprinkled with water and vinegar as the public crowded to see his corpse prior to the funeral on 15 and 16 July. The stench became so bad however that the funeral had to be brought forward to the evening of 16 July.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Harvnb</target><arg>Schama</arg><arg>1989</arg><arg name="p">83</arg></template>.</extension><space/><italics>The Death of Marat</italics>, perhaps David's most famous painting, has been called the<space/><link><target>Piet</target></link><space/>of the revolution.
