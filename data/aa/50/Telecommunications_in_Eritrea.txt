'''Telecommunications in Eritrea''' are under the authority of the [[Government of Eritrea]].
 
==Infrastructure==
The [[Eritrean Telecommunications Corporation|Eritrea Telecommunication Services Corporation]], more commonly known as ''EriTel'', is the sole operator of both landline and mobile telephone communication infrastructure in [[Eritrea]]. However, it is one of several [[internet service provider]]s in the country.<ref>[http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/membership/portal/index.asp?Name=1226 "Eritrea Telecommunication Services Corporation (EriTel)"], International Telecommunications Union (ITU), 2011. Retrieved 1 November 2013.</ref>

The domestic telecommunications infrastructure is very inadequate. Most fixed line telephones are located in [[Asmara]], the capital and largest city. Cell phones are in increasing use throughout the country. The government is seeking international tenders to improve the system.<ref name=WFB-Eritrea-2013/>

On 13 April 2006, Eritrea received a soft loan from the government of [[China]] to upgrade their communication infrastructure. The total sum loaned to [[EriTel]] was $23 million. All major cities are connected to the mobile telephone system in Eritrea except for Nakfa, Afabet, and Asseb. Afabet and Nakfa are expected to be online by July 2006.{{update after|2013|11|1}}

===Internet censorship and surveillance===
* Listed as Under Surveillance by [[Reporters Without Borders]] (RWB) in 2008, 2009, not in 2010, and again from 2011 to the present.<ref name=RWBEnemies2012>[http://march12.rsf.org/i/Report_EnemiesoftheInternet_2012.pdf ''Internet Enemies''], Reporters Without Borders (Paris), 12&nbsp;March 2012</ref>

Eritrea has not set up a widespread automatic Internet filtering system, but it does not hesitate to order blocking of several diaspora websites critical of the regime. Access to these sites is blocked by two of the Internet service providers, Erson and Ewan, as are [[pornographic]] websites and [[YouTube]]. [[Self-censorship]] is said to be widespread.<ref>[http://en.rsf.org/surveillance-eritrea,39762.html "Countries under surveillance: Eritrea"], Reporters Without Borders, March 2011</ref>
