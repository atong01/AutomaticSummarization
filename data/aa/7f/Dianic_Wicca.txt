}} and, to some also as "Dianism," "Dianic Feminist Witchcraft," or simply "Feminist Witchcraft"'</ref> is a [[neopagan]] religion of female-centered [[goddess]] worship and religious [[witchcraft]]. While some adherents identify as [[Wicca]]n, it differs from most traditions of Wicca in that only goddesses are worshiped (whereas most Wiccan traditions honor both female and male deities).<ref name=Budapest1>Budapest, Zsuzsanna.

While there is more than one tradition that calls itself Dianic,<ref name=Adler1 /> the most well known is the female-only variety,<ref name="River May 2004"/> founded by [[Zsuzsanna Budapest]] in the [[United States]] in the 1970s.<ref name=Budapest1 /><ref name=Adler1 /> It is notable for its worship of a single [[Goddess movement|Goddess]] and focus on egalitarian, matriarchal [[feminism]].<ref name=Adler1 /> It is named after the [[Roman goddess]] [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], but Dianics worship goddesses from many cultures, seeing them as "aspects" of a [[monotheistic]] goddess.<ref name=Budapest1 />  Dianic Wicca is an [[Wicca#Eclectic Wicca|eclectic]] combination of elements from [[British Traditional Wicca]], Italian folk-magic as recorded by [[Charles Leland]] in ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches|Aradia]]'', [[Second-wave feminism|feminist]] values, folk magic and healing practices from a variety of different cultures.<ref name=Budapest1 /><ref name=Adler1 />

==Beliefs and practices==
[[File:Diana with a Stag and a Dog LACMA M.78.77.jpg|thumb|300px|Diana (and her predecessor, the Greek goddess Artemis) as a protector of women and wild nature<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.templeofdiana.org/dwt.htm|title=Temple of Diana - The Tradition of Dianic Wicca|work=templeofdiana.org}}</ref>]]
Dianic Wiccans of the Budapest lineage worship the [[Goddess]], who they see as containing all goddesses, from all cultures; she is seen as the source of all living things and containing all that is within her.<ref name=Budapest1 /> Dianic covens practice [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] in the form of [[mediation]] and visualization in addition to spell work. They focus especially on healing themselves from the wounds of the [[patriarchy]] while affirming their own womanhood. 

Rituals can include reenacting religious and spiritual lore from a feminist standpoint, celebrating the female body, and mourning society's abuses of women.<ref name=Foltz>Foltz, Tanic G. “Women's Spirituality Research: Doing Feminism,” Sociology of Religion 64.4 (2000): 409-418.</ref> The practice of magic is rooted in the belief that energy or 'life force' can be directed to enact change.<ref name=SmithHorne> Smith, Brandy and Sharon Horne. "Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgendered (GLBT) Experiences with Earth-Spirited Faith." The Journal of Homosexuality, 52.3/4 (2007): 235-248. </ref> However it is important to note that rituals are often improvised to suit individual or group needs and vary from coven to coven.<ref name=Warwick> Warwick, Lynda L. "Feminist Wicca: Paths to Empowerment." Women & Therapy 16.2-3 (1995): 121. </ref> Some Dianic Wiccans eschew manipulative [[Spell (paranormal)|spellwork]] and [[Curse|hexing]] because it goes against the [[Wiccan Rede]]. However, many other Dianic witches (notably Budapest) do not consider hexing or binding of those who attack women to be wrong, and actively encourage the binding of [[rape|rapists]].<ref name=Budapest1 />

===Differences from mainstream Wicca===
Like other Wiccans, Dianics may form [[coven]]s, attend [[festival]]s, celebrate the eight major [[Sabbat|Wiccan holidays]], and gather on [[Esbat]]s.<ref name=Budapest1 /> They use many of the same [[Magical tools in Wicca|altar tools]], rituals, and vocabulary as other Wiccans. Dianics may also gather in less formal Circles.<ref name="Velkoborska 2010"/> The most noticeable difference between the two are that Dianic covens of Budapest lineage are composed entirely of women.<ref name=Budapest1 /><ref name=Adler1 />

When asked why "men and gods" are excluded from her rituals, Budapest stated:
{{Quote|It’s the natural law, as women fare so fares the world, their children, and that’s everybody. If you lift up the women you have lifted up humanity. Men have to learn to develop their own mysteries. Where is the order of Attis? Pan? Zagreus? Not only research it, but then popularize it as well as I have done. Where are the Dionysian rites? I think men are lazy in this aspect by not working this up for themselves. It’s their own task, not ours.|during a 2007 interview<ref name="Velkoborska 2010">{{citation

There is therapeutic value inherent in Dianic ritual—many women use it to overcome personal trauma and raise awareness about violence towards women, earning comparisons to feminist [[consciousness-raising]] groups in the 1960s and 70s.<ref name=FoltzGriffin1> Foltz, Tanic G. and Wendy Griffin. “Ethnographic Journeys of Self Discovery,” Composing Ethnography: Alternative Forms of Qualitative Writing.

(1990): 211-234. </ref> In fact, some groups develop rituals specifically to confront gendered personal trauma, such as battery, rape, incest, and partner abuse. In one ethnographic study of such a ritual, women shifted their understanding of power from the hands of their abusers to themselves. It was found that this ritual had improved self-perception in participants in the short-term, and that the results could be sustained with ongoing practice.<ref name=Jacobs1> Jacobs, Janet L. “The Effects of Ritual Healing on Female Victims of Abuse: A Study of Empowerment and Transformation.” Sociological Analysis, 50.3 (1989): 265-279. </ref><ref name=Jacobs2> Jacobs, Janet L. "Women, Ritual, and Power." Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies, 11.2-3 (1990): 39-44. </ref> 

Dianics also pride themselves on the inclusion of [[lesbian]] and [[bisexual]] members. It is a goal within many covens to explore female sexuality and sensuality outside of male control, and many rituals function to affirm lesbian sexuality.<ref name=Barrett> Barrett, Ruth Rhiannon. “Lesbian Rituals and Dianic Tradition.” Journal of Lesbian Studies, 7.2 (2003): 15-28. Web. 12 Feb. 2015. </ref> Other LGBT people find Wicca after coming out to maintain their spirituality in a sexuality-affirming religious practice.<ref name=SmithHorne> Smith, Brandy and Sharon Horne. "Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgendered (GLBT) Experiences with Earth-Spirited Faith." The Journal of Homosexuality, 52.3/4 (2007): 235-248. </ref> However, many covens are [[radical feminism|trans-exclusionary]], citing the close link between ritual and body, and reject those who were not [[sex assignment|assigned female at birth]].<ref name=Barrett> Barrett, Ruth Rhiannon. “Lesbian Rituals and Dianic Tradition.” Journal of Lesbian Studies, 7.2 (2003): 15-28. Web. 12 Feb. 2015. </ref> It is possible that this varies from coven to coven, as some groups also directly challenge [[gender identity]].<ref name=FoltzLozano> Lozano, Wendy G. and Tanic G. Foltz. “An Ethnographic Study of Witchcraft and Death,” Qualitative Sociology, Vol.13, No. 13. (1990): 211-234. </ref>

==History==
[[File:Triple-Goddess Wiccan Symbol (modified).png|thumb]]
Dianic Wicca began on the [[Winter Solstice]] of 1971, when Budapest led a ceremony in Hollywood, California.<ref name=Budapest1 /><ref name=Adler1 /> Self-identifying as a "hereditary witch,"<ref name=Budapest1 /><ref name=Adler1 /> and claiming to have learned folk magic from her mother,<ref name=Budapest1 /><ref name=Adler1 /> Budapest is frequently considered the mother of modern Dianic Wiccan tradition.<ref name=Adler1 /> Dianic Wicca itself is named after the Roman goddess of the same name.<ref name="Oswald 2003">{{cite book

==Denominations and Related Traditions==
* Traditions derived from Zsuzsanna Budapest - Female-only covens run by priestesses trained and initiated by Budapest.
* Independent Dianic witches - who may have been inspired by Budapest, her published work (such as ''The Holy Book of Women's Mysteries'') or other woman's spirituality movements, and who emphasize independent study and self-initiation.

===McFarland Dianic===
McFarland Dianic is a Neopagan tradition of goddess worship founded by Morgan McFarland and Mark Roberts which, despite the shared name, has a different theology and in some cases accepts male participants.<ref name=Adler1 /><ref name=McFarlandSite1>[http://www.mcfarlanddianic.org/a-chronology.php The McFarland Dianic Tradition] personal website</ref> McFarland largely bases their tradition on the work of [[Robert Graves]] and his book ''[[The White Goddess]]''.<ref name=McFarlandSite1 /> While some McFarland covens will initiate men, the leadership is limited to female priestesses.<ref name=McFarlandSite1 /> Like other Dianic traditions, "McFarland Dianic covens espouse feminism as an all-important concept."<ref name=McFarlandSite1 /> They consider the decision whether to include or exclude males as "solely the choice of [a member coven's] individual High Priestess."<ref name=McFarlandSite1 />
