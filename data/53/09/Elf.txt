An '''elf''' (plural: ''elves'') is a type of [[supernatural]] being in [[Germanic mythology]] and [[folklore]].<ref>Lass 1994, p. 205; Lindow 2002, p. 110; Hall 2007.</ref> Reconstructing the early concept of an elf depends almost entirely on texts in [[Old English]] or relating to [[Norse mythology]].<ref>Hall 2007.</ref> Later evidence for elves appears in diverse sources such as medical texts, prayers, ballads, and folktales.

Recent scholars have emphasised, in the words of Ármann Jakobsson, that
: the time has come to resist reviewing information about ''álfar'' ''en masse'' and trying to impose generalizations on a tradition of a thousand years. Legends of ''álfar'' may have been constantly changing and were perhaps always heterogeneous so it might be argued that any particular source will only reflect the state of affairs at one given time.<ref>2006, 230-31; cf. Shippey 2005; Hall 2007, 16-17; Gunnell 2007.</ref>
However, some generalisations are possible. In medieval Germanic-speaking cultures, elves seem generally to have been thought of as a group of beings with magical powers and supernatural beauty, ambivalent towards everyday people and capable of either helping or hindering them. However, the precise character of beliefs in elves across the Germanic-speaking world has varied considerably across time, space, and different cultures. In Old Norse mythological texts, elves seem at least at times to be counted among the pagan gods; in medieval German texts they seem more consistently monstrous and harmful.

Elves are prominently associated with sexual threats, seducing people and causing them harm. For example, a number of early modern ballads in the [[British Isles]] and Scandinavia, originating in the medieval period, describe human encounters with elves.
 
In English literature of the [[Elizabethan era]], elves became conflated with the [[Fairy|fairies]] of [[Romance-speaking Europe|Romance]] culture, so that the two terms began to be used interchangeably. German [[Romanticism|Romanticist]] writers were influenced by this notion of the 'elf', and reimported the English word ''elf'' in that context into the German language. In Scandinavia, probably through a process of [[euphemism]], elves often came to be known as (or were conflated with) the beings called the [[huldra]] or [[huldufólk]]. Meanwhile, German folklore has tended to see the conflation of elves with [[Dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarfs]].<ref name="Hall 2007, 32-33">Hall 2007, 32-33.</ref>

The "[[Christmas elf|Christmas elves]]" of contemporary popular culture are of relatively recent tradition, popularized during the late nineteenth-century in the United States. Elves entered the twentieth-century [[high fantasy]] genre in the wake of works published by authors such as [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], for which, see [[Elf (Middle-earth)]].

== Etymology ==
[[File:Phonological development of the word elf in English.png|thumb|right|700px|A chart showing how the sounds of the word 'elf' have changed in the history of English. The chart cites Richard M. Hogg, ''A Grammar of Old English'', Volume 1: Phonology (Oxford: Blackwell, 1992). It has also been published in Alaric Hall, ''Elves in Anglo-Saxon England: Matters of Belief, Health, Gender and Identity'', Anglo-Saxon Studies, 8 (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2007), p. 178 (fig. 7).]]

The English word ''[[:wikt:elf|elf]]'' is from the [[Old English]] word most often attested as ''ælf'' (whose plural would have been *''ælfe''). Although this word took a variety of forms in different Old English dialects, these converged on the form ''elf'' during the [[Middle English]] period.<ref>Hall 2007, 176-81.</ref> During the Old English period, separate forms were used for female elves (such as ''ælfen'', putatively from common Germanic *''ɑlβ(i)innjō''), but during the Middle English period the word ''elf'' came routinely to include female beings.<ref>Hall 2007, 75-88, 157-66.</ref>

The main medieval Germanic cognates of ''elf'' are Old Norse ''alfr'', plural ''alfar'', and Old High German ''alp'', plural ''alpî'', ''elpî'' (alongside the feminine ''elbe'').<ref>Hall 2007, 5.</ref> These words must come from [[Proto-Germanic language|Common Germanic]], the ancestor-language of English, German, and the Scandinavian languages: the Common Germanic forms must have been *''ɑlβi-z'' and ''ɑlβɑ-z''.<ref>Hall 2007, 5, 176-77.</ref>

Germanic ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/albiz|*ɑlβi-z~*ɑlβɑ-z]]'' is generally agreed to be cognate with the Latin ''albus'' ('(matt) white'), Old Irish ''ailbhín'' (‘flock’); Albanian ''elb'' (‘barley’); and Germanic words for ‘swan’ such as Modern Icelandic ''álpt''. These all come from an Indo-European base ''*alb<sup>h</sup>-'', and seem to be connected by whiteness. The Germanic word presumably originally meant 'white person', perhaps as a euphemism. [[Jakob Grimm]] thought that whiteness implied positive moral connotations, and, noting Snorri Sturluson's ''[[Dökkálfar and Ljósálfar|ljósálfar]]'', suggested that elves were divinities of light. This is not necessarily the case, however. For example, Alaric Hall, noting that the cognates suggest matt white, has instead tentatively suggested that later evidence associating both elves and whiteness with feminine beauty may indicate that it was this beauty that gave elves their name.<ref>Hall 2007, 54-55.</ref> A completely different etymology, making ''elf'' cognate with the ''[[Rbhus]]'', semi-divine craftsmen in Indian mythology, was also suggested by [[Adalbert Kuhn|Kuhn]], in 1855.<ref name="Kuhn1855-p110">{{cite book|last=Kuhn|first=Adalbert|authorlink=Adalbert Kuhn|title=Die sprachvergleichung und die urgeschichte der indogermanischen völker|journal=Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprachforschung|volume=4|year=1855|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wvRTAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA110}}, "Zu diesen ṛbhu, alba.. stellt sich nun aber entschieden das ahd. alp, ags. älf, altn . âlfr"</ref><ref>in ''[[Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprachforschung|K.

===Elves in names===

Throughout the medieval Germanic languages, ''elf'' was one of the nouns that was used in [[Germanic name|personal names]], almost invariably as a first element. These names may have been influenced by Celtic names beginning in ''Albio-'' such as ''Albiorix''.

[[File:Alden Valley - geograph.org.uk - 417197.jpg|thumb|Alden Valley, Lancashire, possibly a place once associated with elves]]

Personal names provide the only evidence for ''elf'' in [[Gothic language|Gothic]], which must have had the word ''*albs'' (plural ''*albeis''). The most famous such name is ''[[Alboin]]''. Old English names in ''elf''- include the cognate of ''Alboin'' [[Ælfwine]] ('elf-friend', m.), [[Ælfric]] ('elf-powerful', m.), [[Ælfweard]] (m.) and [[Ælfwaru]] (f.) ('elf-guardian'). The only widespread survivor of these in modern English is [[Alfred (name)|Alfred]] (Old English ''Ælfrēd'', 'elf-advice'). German examples are ''[[Alberich]]'', ''[[Alphart]]'' and ''Alphere'' (father of [[Walter of Aquitaine]])<ref>{{cite book|last=Paul|first=Hermann|authorlink=Adalbert Kuhn|title=Grundriss der germanischen philologie unter mitwirkung|publisher=K. J. Trübner|year=1900|page=268|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wXcVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA268}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Althof|editor-first=Hermann|title=Das Waltharilied|publisher=Dieterich|year=1902|page=114|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3AcnAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA114}}</ref> and Icelandic examples include ''Álfhildur''. It is generally agreed that these names indicate that elves were positively regarded in early Germanic culture. Other words for supernatural beings in personal names almost all denote pagan gods, suggesting that elves were in a similar category of beings.<ref name="Hall 2007, 55-62">Hall 2007, 55-62.</ref>

In later Old Icelandic, ''alfr'' ('elf') and the personal name which in Common Germanic had been *''Aþa(l)wulfaz'' both coincidentally became ''álfr~Álfr''.<ref>De Vreis 1962, s.v. ''Álfr''.</ref> This seems to have led people to associate legendary heroes called Álfr with the elves.

Elves appear in some place-names, though it is hard to be sure how many as a variety of other words, including personal names, can appear similar to ''elf''. The clearest English example is ''[[Elveden]]'' ('elves' hill', Suffolk); other examples may be ''[[Eldon Hill]]'' ('Elves' hill', Derbyshire); and ''[[Alden Valley]]'' ('elves' valley', Lancashire). These seem to associate elves fairly consistently with woods and valleys.<ref>Hall 2007, 64-66</ref>

== Relationship to Christian cosmologies ==

Almost all surviving textual sources about elves were produced by Christians—whether Anglo-Saxon monks, medieval Icelandic poets, early modern ballad-singers, nineteenth-century folklore collectors, or even early twentieth-century fantasy authors. As with the Irish ''[[Aos Sí]]'', beliefs in elves have, therefore, been a part of Christian cultures throughout their recorded history and there is a complex relationship between ideas about elves and mainstream Christian thought.<ref>The seminal statements of this theme are Jolly 1996 and Shippey 2005.</ref>

Historically, people have taken three main approaches to integrating elves into Christian cosmology (though of course there are no rigid distinctions between these):

# '''Identifying elves with the [[demon]]s of Judaeo-Christian-Mediterranean tradition.'''<ref>e.g. {{Harvnb|Jolly|1992|p=172}}</ref> For example:
#* In English-language material, in the [[Royal Prayer Book]] from c. 900, ''elf'' appears as a ''gloss'' for 'Satan';<ref>Hall 2007, 71-72.</ref> in the late fourteenth-century ''[[The Wife of Bath's Tale|Wife of Bath’s Tale]]'', [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] equates male elves with [[incubus|incubi]];<ref>Hall 2007, 162.</ref> and in the [[Witch trials in early modern Scotland|early modern Scottish witchcraft trials]], confessions by people accused of witchcraft to encounters with elves were often interpreted by prosecutors as evidence of encounters with the [[Devil]].<ref>Hall 2005, 30-32.</ref>
#* In medieval Scandinavia, [[Snorri Sturluson]] wrote in his ''[[Prose Edda]]'' of [[Dökkálfar and Ljósálfar|''ljósálfar'' and ''døkkálfar'']] ('light-elves and dark-elves'), the ''ljósálfar'' living in the heavens and the ''døkkálfar'' under the earth. The consensus of modern scholarship is that Snorri’s elves are based on angels and demons of Christian cosmology.<ref name="ReferenceA">Shippey 2005, 180-81; Hall 2007, 23-26; Gunnell 2007, 127-28; Tolley 2009, I 220.</ref>
#* Elves appear as demonic forces widely in medieval and early modern English, German, and Scandinavian prayers.<ref>Hall 2007, 69-74, 106 n. 48 and 122 on English evidence; Hall 2007, 98 fn 10 and Schulz 2000, 62–85 on German evidence; Haukur Þorgeirsson 2011, 54-58 on Icelandic evidence.</ref>
# '''Viewing elves as being more or less like people, and more or less outside Christian cosmology.'''<ref>e.g. Hall 2007, 172-75.</ref> The people who copied the [[Poetic Edda]] do not seem to have attempted to integrate elves into Christian thought. Likewise, the early modern Scottish people who, when prosecuted as witches, confessed to encountering elves seem not to have thought of themselves as having dealings with the [[Devil]]. Nineteenth-century Icelandic folklore about [[Huldufólk|elves]] mostly presents them as a human agricultural community parallel to the visible human community, that may or may not be Christian.<ref>Shippey 2005, 161-68; Alver and Selberg 1987.</ref> It is even possible that stories were sometimes told from this perspective to subvert the dominance of the Church.<ref>Ingwersen 1995, 83-89.</ref>
# '''Integrating elves into Christian cosmology without demonising them.'''<ref>e.g. Shippey 2005.</ref> The most striking examples are serious (if unusual) theological treatises: the Icelandic ''Tíðfordrif'' (1644) by [[Jón Guðmundsson lærði]] or, in Scotland, [[Robert Kirk (folklorist)|Robert Kirk]]’s ''Secret Commonwealth of Elves, Fauns and Fairies'' (1691). This approach also appears in the Old English poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', which lists elves among the monstrous races springing from Cain’s murder of Abel.<ref>Hall 2007, 69-74.</ref> The late thirteenth-century ''[[South English Legendary]]'' and some Icelandic folktales explain elves as angels that sided neither with [[Lucifer]] nor with God, and were banished by God to earth rather than hell. One famous Icelandic folktale explains elves as the lost children of Eve.<ref>Hall 2007, 75; Shippey 2005, 174, 185-86.</ref>

==Elves in medieval texts and post-medieval folk-belief==
Our earliest substantial evidence for elf-beliefs comes in medieval texts from Anglo-Saxon England and high medieval Iceland, with a scatter of texts from the German-speaking world. Some general themes are apparent: elves were human(-like); were once pagan divinities of some kind; and were dangerous: they could cause harm to people or livestock, or might seduce people into sexual relationships with them.

After the Middle Ages, the word ''elf'' tended to be replaced by other terms, becoming archaic, dialectal, or surviving only in fossilised terms.

===Medieval English-language sources===

====Old English====

The earliest surviving manuscripts mentioning elves are from [[Anglo-Saxon England]]. Here elves are most often attested in [[Old English language|Old English]] [[Gloss (annotation)|glosses]] which translate Latin words for [[nymph]]s, and in medical texts which attest to elves afflicting humans and [[livestock]] with illnesses: apparently mostly sharp, internal pains and mental disorders. The most famous of the medical texts is the [[Anglo-Saxon Metrical Charms|metrical charm]] ''[[Wið færstice]]'' ('against a stabbing pain'), from the tenth-century compilation ''[[Lacnunga]]'', but most of the attestations are in the tenth-century [[Bald's Leechbook|''Bald's Leechbook'' and ''Leechbook III'']].

[[File:Eadwine Psalter f 66r detail of Christ and demons attacking psalmist.png|thumb|left|250px|The Eadwine Psalter, f. 66r, detail: Christ and demons attacking the psalmist.]]

Because of elves' association with illness, in the second half of the twentieth century, most scholars imagined that elves in the Anglo-Saxon tradition were small, invisible, demonic beings, causing illness with arrows. Scholars, but not the primary texts, labelled the illnesses elves caused as '[[elf-shot]]'.<ref>Hall 2007, 96-118.</ref> This was encouraged by the idea that 'elf-shot' is depicted in the [[Eadwine Psalter]], in an image which became well known in this connection.<ref>J. H. G. Grattan and Charles Singer, ''Anglo-Saxon Magic and Medicine Illustrated Specially from the Semi-Pagan Text ‘Lacnunga’'', Publications of the Wellcome Historical Medical Museum, New Series, 3 (London: Oxford University Press, 1952), frontispiece.</ref> However, this is now thought to be a misunderstanding: the image proves to be a conventional illustration of God's arrows and of Christian demons.<ref>Jolly, Karen Louise, 'Elves in the Psalms? The Experience of Evil from a Cosmic Perspective', in The Devil, Heresy and Witchcraft in the Middle Ages: Essays in Honor of Jeffrey B. Russell, ed. by Alberto Ferreiro, Cultures, Beliefs and Traditions, 6 (Lieden, 1998), pp. 19–44; ISBN 9004106103, 9789004106109, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UyNi3V1NKy0C&pg=PA19&lpg=PA19 Google Books]</ref>

But there is good evidence that elves were associated with the [[succuba]]-like [[Mare (folklore)|''mære'']]<ref>Hall 2007, 124-26, 128-29, 136--37, 156.</ref> and could cause illness, recent scholarship suggests Anglo-Saxon elves, like elves in later evidence from Britain and Scandinavia or the Irish [[Aos Sí]], were like people.<ref>Shippey 2005, 168-76; Hall 2007, esp. 172-75.</ref> Like words for gods and men, the word ''elf'' is used in personal names where words for monsters and demons are not.<ref name="Hall 2007, 55-62"/> Just as ''álfar'' are associated with ''[[Æsir]]'' in Old Norse, ''[[Wið færstice]]'' associates elves with ''ēse''; whatever this word meant by the tenth century, etymologically it denoted pagan gods.<ref>Hall 2007, 35-63.</ref> In Old English, the plural ''ylfe'' (attested in ''Beowulf'') is grammatically an ethnonym (a word for an ethnic group).<ref>Huld 1998; Hall 2007, 62-63; Tolley 2009, I 209.</ref>

While they may still have been thought to cause disease with weapons,<ref>Tolley 2009, I 220.</ref> elves are more clearly associated in Old English with a kind of magic denoted by Old English ''sīden'' and ''sīdsa'', cognate with Old Norse ''[[seiðr]]'', and also paralleled in the Old Irish ''[[Serglige Con Culainn]]''.<ref>Hall 2007, 119-56; Tolley 2009, I 221.</ref> This fits well with the use of Old English ''ælf'' and its feminine derivative ''ælbinne'' to gloss words for nymphs and with the word ''ælfscȳne'', which meant 'elf-beautiful' and is attested describing seductively beautiful women.<ref>Hall 2007, 75-95.</ref>

====Middle English====

Later in medieval English evidence, while still appearing as causes of harm and danger, elves appear more clearly as human-like beings, and increasingly as females rather than males, which may reflect developments in elf-beliefs during the medieval period.<ref>Hall 2007, 157-66; Shippey 2005, 172-76.</ref> They became associated with medieval romance traditions of [[fairy|fairies]] and particularly with the idea of a [[Fairy Queen]]. Sexual allure becomes increasingly prominent in the source material.<ref>Shippey 2005, 175-76; Hall 2007, 130-48.</ref> Elves are also associated with the arcane wisdom of [[alchemy]].<ref>Hall 2007, 88-89, 141; Green 2003; Hall 2006.</ref>

By the end of the medieval period, ''elf'' was increasingly being supplanted by the French loan-word ''fairy'',<ref>Hall 2005, 20.</ref> as in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s satirical ''[[Sir Thopas]]'' where the title character sets out in quest of the 'elf-queen', who dwells in the 'countree of the Faerie'.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keightley|1850|p=53}}</ref>

====Post-medieval folk belief in Britain====

Despite the decline in references to elves in England, beliefs in elves remained prominent in early modern Scotland, where elves appear in English-language sources in the [[Witch trials in early modern Scotland|early modern Scottish witchcraft trials]]. These produced many depositions by people who believed themselves to have been given healing powers or to know of people or animals made sick by elves.<ref>Purkiss 2000, 85-115; Henderson and Cowan 2001; Hall 2005.</ref> The similarities with Old English material, and particularly ''[[Wið færstice]]'', are close.<ref>Hall 2007, 112-15.</ref> Elves were viewed as being supernaturally powerful people who lived invisibly alongside everyday rural people.<ref>Henderson and Cowan 2001; Hall 2005.</ref>

The noun ''elf-shot'' is first attested in a Scots poem, 'Rowlis Cursing' from around 1500, where 'elf schot' is listed among a range of curses to be inflicted on some chicken-thieves.<ref>Hall 2005b, 23.</ref> It may not always have denoted an actual projectile as there is evidence that 'shot' could mean 'a sharp pain', but it and terms like ''elf-arrow(head)'' are sometimes used of [[Elf-arrow|neolithic arrow-heads]], apparently thought to have been made by elves, and in a few witchcraft trials people attest that these were used in healing rituals, and occasionally alleged to be used by witches (and perhaps elves) to injure people and cattle.<ref>Hall 2005.</ref> Compare with the following excerpt from a 1749–50 ode by [[William Collins (poet)|William Collins]]:

:''There every herd, by sad experience, knows''
:''How, winged with fate, their elf-shot arrows fly,''
:''When the sick ewe her summer food forgoes,''
:''Or, stretched on earth, the heart-smit heifers lie.''<ref>{{cite journal|ref=harv|editor-last=Carlyle|editor-first=Alexander|title=An Ode on the Popular Superstitions of the Highlands. Written by the late William Collins|journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|volume=i|year=1788|url=http://books.google.co.jp/books?id=uytFAAAAcAAJ&pg=RA2-PA68|page=68}}, stanza II. 1749 date of composition is given on p. 63.</ref>

===Old Norse texts===
Evidence for elf-beliefs in medieval Scandinavia outside Iceland is very sparse, but the Icelandic evidence is uniquely rich.

====Mythological texts====
For a long time, views about elves in Old Norse mythology were defined by [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s [[Prose Edda]], which talks about ''[[svartálfar]]'', [[Dökkálfar and Ljósálfar|''dökkálfar'' and ''ljósálfar'']]. However, these words are only attested in the Prose Edda and texts based on it, and it is now agreed that they reflect traditions of [[Dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarves]], [[demon]]s, and [[angel]]s, partly showing Snorri's 'paganisation' of a Christian cosmology learned from the ''[[Elucidarius]]''.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

[[File:Semantic field diagram of words for sentient beings in Old Norse.gif|thumb|400px|One possible semantic field diagram of words for sentient beings in Old Norse, schematising their relationships (Hall 2009, 208 fig. 1).]]

Scholars of Old Norse mythology now focus on references to elves in Old Norse poetry, particularly the [[Elder Edda]]. The only character explicitly identified as an elf in classical Eddaic poetry, if any, is [[Wayland the Smith|Völundr]], the protagonist of ''[[Völundarkviða]]''.<ref>Dumézil 1973, 3.</ref> However, elves are frequently mentioned in the alliterating formulaic collocation ''Æsir ok Álfar'' ('Æsir and elves') and its variants. This shows a strong tradition of associating elves with the [[Æsir]], or sometimes even of not distinguishing between the two groups.<ref>Hall 2007, 34-39; Haukur Þorgeirsson 2011, 49-50.</ref> The collocation is paralleled in the Old English poem ''[[Wið færstice]]'';<ref>Hall 2007, 35-63</ref> in the Germanic personal name system;<ref name="Hall 2007, 55-62"/> and in [[Skaldic verse]] the word ''elf'' is used in the same way as words for gods.<ref>Hall 2007, 28-32.</ref> [[Sigvatr Þórðarson]]’s skaldic travelogue ''[[Austrfaravísur]]'', composed around 1020, mentions an ''[[álfablót]]'' (‘elves' sacrifice’) in Edskogen in what is now southern Sweden.<ref>Hall 2007, 30-31.</ref> There does not seem to have been any clear-cut distinction between humans and gods; like the Æsir, then, elves were presumably thought of as being human(-like) and existing in opposition to the [[Jötunn|giants]].<ref>Hall 2007, 31-34, 42, 47-53.</ref> Many commentators have also (or instead) argued for conceptual overlap between elves and [[Dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarves]] in Old Norse mythology, which may fit with trends in the medieval German evidence.<ref name="Hall 2007, 32-33"/>

There are hints that [[Freyr]] was associated with elves, particularly that ''[[Álfheimr]]'' (literally 'elf-world') is mentioned as being given to [[Freyr]] in ''[[Grímnismál]]''. Because Snorri Sturluson identified Freyr as one of the [[Vanir]] when that word is rare in Eddaic verse, very rare in Skaldic verse, and is not generally thought to appear in other Germanic languages, it has long been suggested that ''álfar'' and ''Vanir'' are, more or less, different words for the same group of beings, and even that Snorri invented the ''Vanir''.<ref>Simek 2010; Hall 27, 35-37; Frog and Roper 2011.</ref> However, this is not uniformly accepted.<ref>Tolley 2009, I 210-17.</ref>

A kenning for the sun, ''álfrǫðull'', is of uncertain meaning but is to some suggestive of a close link between the elves' and the sun.<ref>{{Harvnb|Motz|1973|p=99}}; {{Harvnb|Hall|2004|p=40}}.</ref>

Although the relevant words are of slightly uncertain meaning, it seems fairly clear that [[Wayland the Smith|Völundr]] is described as one of the elves in ''[[Völundarkviða]]''.<ref>Ármann Jakobsson 2006; Hall 2007, 39-47.</ref> As his most prominent deed in the poem is to rape Böðvildr, the poem associates elves with being a sexual threat to maidens. The same idea is present in two post-classical Eddaic poems, which are also influenced by [[Chivalric romance|romance]] or [[Breton lai|Breton ''lais'']], ''Kötludraumur'' and ''Gullkársljóð'' and in later traditions in Scandinavia and beyond, so may be an early attestation of a prominent tradition.<ref>Haukur Þorgeirsson 2011, 50-52.</ref> Elves also appear in a couple of verse spells, including the [[Bergen rune-charm]] from among the [[Bryggen inscriptions]].<ref>Hall 2007, 133-34.</ref>

====Other sources====
The appearance of elves in sagas is closely defined by genre. 'In the more realistic [[Sagas of Icelanders]], [[Bishops' Sagas]], and ''[[Sturlunga saga]]'', ''álfar'' are rare. When seen, they are distant.'<ref>Ármann Jakobsson 2006, 231.</ref> These texts include a fleeting mention of elves seen out riding in 1168 (in ''Sturlunga saga''); mention of an ''[[álfablót]]'' in ''[[Kormáks saga]]''; and the existence of the euphemism ''ganga álfrek'' ('go to drive away the elves') for 'going for a poo' in ''[[Eyrbyggja saga]]''.<ref>Ármann Jakobsson 2006, 231; Tolley 2009, I 217-18.</ref>

The [[Kings' sagas]] include a rather elliptical account of an early Swedish king being worshipped after his death and being called [[Olaf Geirstad-Elf|Ólafr Geirstaðaálfr]] ('Ólafr the elf of Geirstaðir') and the elf as a demon at the beginning of ''[[Norna-Gests þáttr]]'', which is a portion of the ''[[Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar en mesta|Greatest Saga of Olaf Tryggvason]]''.<ref>Ármann Jakobsson 2006, 231-32; Hall 2007, 26-27; Tolley 2009, I 218-19.</ref>

The [[Legendary sagas]] tend to focus on elves as legendary ancestors or on heroes' sexual relations with elf-women. Mention of the land of [[Álfheimr (region)|Álfheimr]] is found in ''[[Heimskringla]]'' while ''[[Þorsteins saga Víkingssonar|The Saga of Thorstein, Viking's Son]]'' recounts a line of local kings who ruled over [[Álfheim]], who since they had elven blood were said to be more beautiful than most men.<ref>''[http://www.northvegr.org/lore/viking/001_02.php The Saga of Thorstein, Viking's Son]'' (Old Norse original: ''[http://www.snerpa.is/net/forn/thorstei.htm Þorsteins saga Víkingssonar]''). Chapter 1. {{wayback|url=http://www.northvegr.org/lore/viking/001_02.php |date=20091125164734 }}</ref>  According to ''[[Hrólfs saga kraka]]'', [[Hrolf Kraki|Hrolfr Kraki]]'s half-sister [[Skuld (princess)|Skuld]] was the [[half-elf|half-elven]] child of King Helgi and an elf-woman (''álfkona''). Skuld was skilled in witchcraft (''[[seiðr]]''). Accounts of Skuld in earlier sources, however, do not include this material. The ''[[Thidrekssaga|Þiðreks saga]]'' version of the [[Nibelung]]en (Niflungar) describes [[Hagen (legend)|Högni]] as the son of a human queen and an elf, but no such lineage is reported in the Eddas, ''[[Volsunga saga|Völsunga saga]]'', or the ''[[Nibelungenlied]]''.<ref>Ármann Jakobsson 2006, 232.</ref> The relatively few mentions of elves in the [[Chivalric sagas]] tend even to be whimsical.<ref>Haukur Þorgeirsson 2011, 52-54.</ref>

Both Continental Scandinavia and Iceland have a scattering of mentions of elves in medical texts, most of them with Low German connections.<ref>Hall 2007, 132-33; Haukur Þorgeirsson 2011, 54-58.</ref>

==== Post-medieval developments ====

Although the term ''elf'' was sustained in some Scandinavian traditions, during and after the medieval period it largely disappears in favour either of euphemisms for the same beings or different beliefs entirely, such as ''[[huldufólk]]'' ('hidden people', Icelandic), ''[[huldra]]'' ('hidden people', Norwegian and Swedish, along with terms like ''skogsfru'' and ''skogsrå''), ''[[Vættir|vetter]]'', ''[[Tomte|nisse]]'' (Denmark, along with ''bjærgfolk'') and ''[[tomte]]'' (Sweden).

===Medieval and early modern German texts===
{{Main|Alp (folklore)}}

Old High German ''alp'' is attested only in a small number of glosses and is defined by the ''Althochdeutsches Wörterbuch'' as a 'nature-god or -demon, equated with the [[Faun]]s of Classical mytholology ... regarded as eerie, ferocious beings ... As the [[Mara (folklore)|nightmare]] he messes around with women'.<ref>'Naturgott oder -dämon, den Faunen der antiken Mythologie gleichgesetzt ... er gilt als gespenstisches, heimtückisches Wesen ... als Nachtmahr spielt er den Frauen mit'; Karg-Gasterstädt and Frings 1968–, s.v. ''alb''.</ref> There is also evidence associating elves with illness, specifically epilepsy, and in the word ''Alpdruck'' ('elf-oppression') with the [[Mara (folklore)|nightmare]].

Accordingly, elves appear in Middle German most often associated with deception or bewildering people 'in a phrase that occurs so often it would appear to be proverbial: "die elben/der alp trieget mich" (the elves/elf is/are deceiving me)' and are often associated with the [[Mare (folklore)|mare]].<ref>Edwards 1994, 16-17, at 17.</ref> Elves appear as a threatening, even demonic, force widely in later medieval prayers. The most famous is the fourteenth-century ''Münchener Nachtsegen'', a prayer to be said at night, which includes the lines:<ref>Hall 2007, 125--26.</ref>

In early modern sources, the German ''alp'' is also described as "cheating" or "deceiving" ({{lang-gmh|trieben}}, {{lang-de|trüben}}) its victims.<ref>(Stallybrass tr.) {{Harvnb|Grimm|1883|p=463}}</ref><ref>In Lexer's Middle High German dictionary under [http://woerterbuchnetz.de/Lexer/?sigle=Lexer&mode=Vernetzung&lemid=LA00984 alp, alb] is an example: Pf.  arzb. 2 14b= {{Harvnb|Pfeiffer|1863|p=44}} ({{cite book|ref=harv|last=Pfeiffer|first=F.|contribution=Arzenîbuch 2= Bartholomäus" (Mitte 13.

Elves in German tradition also show the seductive side apparent in English and Scandinavian material, however.<ref>Edwards 1994.</ref> Most famously, the early thirteenth-century [[Heinrich von Morungen]]'s fifth ''[[Minnesang]]'' begins 'Von den elben virt entsehen vil manic man | Sô bin ich von grôzer lieber entsên' ('full many a man is bewitched by elves | thus I too am bewitched by great love').<ref>Edwards 1994, 13.</ref> As in earlier English, ''elbe'' is attested translating words for nymphs.<ref>Edwards 1994, 17.</ref>

As in Old Norse, however, there are few characters identified as elves. It seems likely that elves were to a significant extent conflated with [[Dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarves]] ({{lang-gmh|{{linktext|getwerc}}}}).<ref>Motz 1983, esp. 23–66.</ref> Some dwarfs that appear in German heroic poetry have been seen as relating to elves, especially when the dwarf's name is ''[[Alberich]]'', which etymologically means 'elf-powerful';<ref>{{cite journal|last=Weston|first=Jessie Laidlay|title=The legends of the Wagner drama: studies in mythology and romance|publisher=C.

As the apparent convergence with ''Gezwerc'' suggests, the word ''alp'' declined in use in German after the medieval period, though it still occurs in some fossilised uses, most prominently the word for 'nightmare', ''Alptraum'' ('elf dream').<ref>Karg-Gasterstädt and Frings 1968–, s.v.

==Early modern ballads==
[[File:Scott-Minstrelsy-Works-v1-p195-True Thomas tune.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Thomas the Rhymer]]'' in [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border]]'']]
Elves have a prominent place in a number of closely related [[ballad]]s which must have originated in the Middle Ages but are first attested in the early modern period, many in [[Karen Brahes Folio]], a Danish manuscript from the 1570s.<ref>Lynda Taylor, 'The Cultural Significance of Elves in Northern European Balladry' (Unpublished PhD thesis, University of Leeds, 2014), http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/8759/.</ref> They circulated widely in Scandinavia and northern Britain. Because they were learned by heart, they sometimes mention elves when that term had become archaic in everyday usage, and have played a major role in transmitting traditional ideas about elves in post-medieval cultures. Some of the early modern ballads, indeed, are still quite widely known, whether through school syllabuses or modern folk music. They therefore give people an unusual degree of access to ideas of elves in older traditional culture.

The ballads are characterised by sexual encounters between everyday people and human(-like) beings referred to in at least some variants as elves (the same characters also appear as mermen, dwarves, and other kinds of supernatural beings). The elves pose a threat to the everyday community by trying to lure people to into the elves' world. Much the most popular example is ''[[Elveskud]]'' and its many variants (paralleled in English as ''[[Clerk Colvill]]''), where a woman from the elf-world tries to tempt a young knight to join her in dancing, or simply to live among the elves; sometimes he refuses and sometimes he accepts, but in either case he dies, tragically. As in ''Elveskud'', sometimes the everyday person is a man and the elf a woman, as also in ''[[Elvehøj]]'' (much the same story as ''Elveskud'' but with a happy ending), ''[[Herr Magnus og Bjærgtrolden]]'', ''[[Herr Tønne af Alsø]]'', ''[[Ungersven och havsfrun|Herr Bøsmer i elvehjem]]'', or the Northern British ''[[Thomas the Rhymer]]''. Sometimes the everyday person is a woman and the elf is a man, as in the northern British ''[[Tam Lin]]'', ''[[The Elfin Knight]]'', and ''[[Lady Isabel and the Elf-Knight]]'', in which the Elf-Knight bears away Isabel to murder her, or the Scandinavian ''[[Harpans kraft]]''. In ''[[The Queen of Elfland's Nourice]]'', a woman is abducted to be a [[wet-nurse]] to the elf-queen's baby, but promised that she may return home once the child is weaned.

== Post-medieval conceptions of elves ==

Early modern Europe saw the emergence for the first time of a distinctive [[High culture|elite culture]], while the [[Reformation]] encouraged new scepticism and opposition to traditional beliefs, while subsequently [[Romanticism]] encouraged their fetishisation by intellectual elites. The effects of this on writing about elves are most apparent in England and Germany, with developments in each country influencing the other. In Scandinavia, the Romantic movement was also prominent, and literary writing was the main context for continued use of the word ''elf ''except in fossilised words for illnesses. However, oral traditions about beings like elves remained prominent in Scandinavia into the early twentieth century.

===England and Germany===
[[File:Rackham elves.jpg|thumb|Illustrations to Shakespeare's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' By [[Arthur Rackham]].]]

From around the [[Late Middle Ages]], the word ''elf'' began to be used in English as a term loosely synonymous with the French loan-word ''[[fairy]]''; in elite culture, at least, it also became associated with diminutive supernatural beings like [[Puck (mythology)|Puck]], [[Hobgoblin (fairy)|hobgoblins]], [[Robin Goodfellow]], the English and Scots [[brownie (folklore)|brownie]], and the Northumbrian English [[Hob (folklore)|hob]]. In [[Elizabethan England]], [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[Faerie Queene]]'' (1590-) used 'fairy' and 'elf' interchangeably of human-sized beings, but they are complex imaginary and allegorical figures; his aetiology of the 'Elfe' and 'Elfin kynd' as being made and quickened by [[Prometheus]] is entirely his invention.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keightley|1850|p=57}}</ref>

[[William Shakespeare]] also imagined elves as little people. He apparently considered elves and fairies to be the same race. In a speech in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' (1592) an 'elf-lock' (tangled hair) is not caused by an elf as such, but [[Queen Mab]], who is referred to as 'the [[fairy|fairies']] [[midwife]]'.<ref name="oed-elf-lock">{{Citation |work=Oxford English Dictionary |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50073178 |title=elf-lock |edition=2 |year=1989 |series=OED Online |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=26 November 2009 }}; "Rom. & Jul. I, iv, 90 Elf-locks" is the oldest example of the use of the phrase given by the OED.</ref> In ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', the elves are almost as small as [[insect]]s.{{dubious|date=December 2011}} The influence of Shakespeare and [[Michael Drayton]] made the use of ''elf'' and ''fairy'' for very small beings the norm, and had a lasting effect seen in [[#Modern fairy tales|fairy tales about elves collected in the modern period]].

[[File:Erl king sterner.jpg|thumb|Illustration of ''Der Erlkönig'' by Albert Sterner]]
Early modern English notions of elves became influential in eighteenth-century Germany. The [[Modern German]] ''Elf'' (m) and ''Elfe'' (f) was introduced as a loan from English in the 1740s<ref name="thun378">{{cite journal|last=Thun|first=Nils|title=The malignant Elves:Notes on Anglo‐Saxon Magic and Germanic Myth|journal=Studia Neophilologica|volume=41|issue=2|year=1969|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00393276908587447?journalCode=snec20#.UZ_C6lTSbIU|pages=378–396|doi=10.1080/00393276908587447}} (p.378).</ref><ref name="Grimm-eng443">(Stallybrass tr.) {{Harvnb|Grimm|1883|loc=vol. 2, p. 443}}</ref> and was prominent in [[Christoph Martin Wieland]]'s 1764 translation of ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.<ref name="kluge-elf-de">"Die aufnahme des Wortes knüpft an Wielands Übersetzung von Shakespeares Sommernachtstraum 1764 und and Herders Voklslieder 1774 (Werke 25, 42) an;{{cite book|last=Kluge|first=Friedrich|authorlink=Friedrich Kluge|title=Etymologisches Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache|place=Strassbourg|publisher=K. J. Trübner|year=1899|edition=6th improved and expanded|page=93|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uL8GAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA93}}</ref>

As [[German Romanticism]] got underway and writers started to seek authentic folklore, [[Jacob Grimm]] rejected ''Elf'' as a recent Anglicism, and promoted the reuse of the old form ''Elb'' (plural ''Elbe'' or ''Elben'').<ref name="Grimm-eng443"/><ref>Grimm and Grimm 1854–1954, s.v. ''Elb''.</ref> In the same vein, [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] translated the Danish ballad ''[[Elveskud]]'' in his 1778 collection of folk songs, ''{{Lang|de|Stimmen der Völker in Liedern}}'', as '{{Lang|de|Erlkönigs Tochter}}' ('The Erl-king's Daughter'; it appears that Herder introduced the term ''Erlkönig'' into German through a mis-Germanisation of the Danish word for ''elf''). This in turn inspired Goethe's poem ''[[Der Erlkönig]]''. Goethe's poem then took on a life of its own, inspiring the Romantic concept of the [[Erlking]], which was influential on literary images of elves from the nineteenth century on.

[[File:Poor little birdie teased by Richard Doyle.jpg|thumb|''Poor little birdie teased'', by [[Victorian era]] illustrator [[Richard Doyle (illustrator)|Richard Doyle]] depicts the traditional view of an elf from later [[English folklore]] as a diminutive woodland humanoid.]]
English and German literary traditions both influenced the British [[Victorian era|Victorian]] image of elves, which appeared in illustrations as tiny men and women with [[Pointy ears|pointed ears]] and stocking caps. An example is [[Andrew Lang]]'s fairy tale ''Princess Nobody'' (1884), illustrated by [[Richard Doyle (illustrator)|Richard Doyle]], where fairies are tiny people with [[butterfly]] wings, whereas elves are tiny people with red stocking caps. These conceptions remained prominent in twentieth-century children's literature, for example [[Enid Blyton]]'s [[The Faraway Tree]] series, and were influenced by [[German Romanticism|German Romantic literature]]. Accordingly, in the [[Brothers Grimm]] fairy tale ''[[The Elves and the Shoemaker|Die Wichtelmänner]]'' (literally 'the little men'), the title protagonists are two tiny naked men who help a shoemaker in his work. Even though ''Wichtelmänner'' are akin to beings such as [[kobolds]], [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]] and [[brownie (folklore)|brownies]], the tale was translated into English by Margaret Hunt in 1884 as ''[[The Elves and the Shoemaker]]''. This shows how the meanings of ''elf'' had changed, and was in itself influential: the usage is echoed, for example, in the [[house-elf]] of [[J. K. Rowling]]'s [[Harry Potter]] stories. In his turn, J. R. R. Tolkien recommended using the older German form ''Elb'' in his ''[[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings]]'' (1967) and ''Elb, Elben'' was consequently introduced in the 1972 [[German translation of The Lord of the Rings|German translation of ''The Lord of the Rings'']], having a role in repopularising the form in German.

=== Scandinavia ===
[[File:Tomtebobarnen.jpg|thumb|left|Little ''älvor'', playing with ''Tomtebobarnen''. From ''Children of the Forest'' (1910) by Swedish author and illustrator [[Elsa Beskow]].]]
In [[Scandinavian folklore]], an ''elf'' is called ''elver'' in [[Danish language|Danish]], ''alv'' in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], ''alv'' (as a learned borrowing from Old Norse) or ''älva'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], and ''álfur'' in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]. After the medieval period, these terms were generally less prominent than alternatives like ''[[huldufólk]]'' ('hidden people', Icelandic), ''[[huldra]]'' ('hidden people', Norwegian and Swedish, along with terms like ''skogsfru'' and ''skogsrå''), ''[[Vættir|vetter]]'', ''[[nisse]]'' (Denmark) and ''[[tomte]]'' (Sweden): the Norwegian expressions seldom appear in genuine folklore, for example.

In Denmark and Sweden, the elves appear as beings distinct from the [[Vættir|''vetter'']], even though the border between them is diffuse. The insect-winged [[fairies]] in [[Celtic mythology]] are often called ''älvor'' in modern Swedish or ''alfer'' in Danish, although the more formal translation is ''feer''. In a similar vein, the ''alf'' found in the fairy tale ''The Elf of the Rose'' by Danish author [[Hans Christian Andersen]] is so tiny that he can have a rose blossom for home, and has 'wings that reached from his shoulders to his feet'. Yet Andersen also wrote about ''elvere'' in ''The Elfin Hill''. The elves in this story are more alike those of traditional Danish folklore, who were beautiful females, living in hills and boulders, capable of dancing a man to [[death]]. Like the ''[[huldra]]'' in Norway and Sweden, they are hollow when seen from the back.

[[File:Alfkors.svg|thumb|The "Elf cross" which protected against malevolent elves.<ref name="alvkors"/>]]

The elves of Norse mythology have survived into folklore mainly as females, living in hills and mounds of stones.<ref name="He-1">{{cite book|author=Hellström|year=1990|title=En Krönika om Åsbro|isbn=91-7194-726-4 |page=36}}</ref> The Swedish ''älvor'', (sing. ''älva'') were stunningly beautiful girls who lived in the forest with an elven king.<ref>For the Swedish belief in ''älvor'' see mainly {{cite book|last=Schön|first=Ebbe|year=1986|title=Älvor, vättar och andra väsen|isbn=91-29-57688-1|chapter=De fagra flickorna på ängen}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Keightley|1850|pp=78–}}. Chapter: "Scandinavia: Elves"</ref> In Romantic art and literature, elves are typically pictured as fair-haired, white-clad, and (like most creatures in the Scandinavian folklore) nasty when offended. In folk-stories, they often play the role of disease-spirits. The most common, though also most harmless case was various irritating [[skin rash]]es, which were called ''älvablåst'' (elven blow) and could be cured by a forceful counter-blow (a handy pair of [[bellows]] was most useful for this purpose). ''Skålgropar'', a particular kind of [[petroglyph]] found in Scandinavia, were known in older times as ''älvkvarnar'' (elven mills), pointing to their believed usage. One could appease the elves by offering them a treat (preferably [[butter]]) placed into an elven mill.

In order to protect themselves and their livestock against malevolent elves, Scandinavians could use a so-called Elf cross (''Alfkors'', ''Älvkors'' or ''Ellakors''), which was carved into buildings or other objects.<ref name="alvkors">The article ''[http://runeberg.org/nfba/0313.html Alfkors]'' in ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'' (1904).</ref> It existed in two shapes, one was a [[pentagram]] and it was still frequently used in early 20th-century [[Sweden]] as painted or carved onto doors, walls and household utensils in order to protect against elves.<ref name="alvkors"/> The second form was an ordinary cross carved onto a round or oblong silver plate.<ref name="alvkors"/> This second kind of elf cross was worn as a pendant in a necklace and in order to have sufficient magic it had to be forged during three evenings with silver from nine different sources of inherited silver.<ref name="alvkors"/> In some locations it also had to be on the altar of a church for three consecutive Sundays.<ref name="alvkors"/>

[[File:Älvalek.jpg|thumb|''Älvalek'', "Elf Play" by [[August Malmström]] (1866).]]

The elves could be seen dancing over meadows, particularly at night and on misty mornings. They left a circle where they had danced, which were called ''älvdanser'' (elf dances) or ''älvringar'' (elf circles), and to urinate in one was thought to cause [[venereal diseases]]. Typically, elf circles were [[fairy rings]] consisting of a ring of small [[mushroom]]s, but there was also another kind of elf circle:

:''On lake shores, where the forest met the lake, you could find elf circles. They were round places where the grass had been flattened like a floor. Elves had danced there. By [[Lake Tisaren]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=59.007568,15.129204&spn=0.074904,0.231245&t=k&hl=en |title=Google Maps |publisher=Maps.google.com |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref> I have seen one of those. It could be dangerous and one could become ill if one had trodden over such a place or if one destroyed anything there.''<ref name="He-1"/>

If a human watched the dance of the elves, he would discover that even though only a few hours seemed to have passed, many years had passed in the real world. Humans being invited or lured to the elf dance is a common motif transferred from older Scandinavian ballads.

Elves were not exclusively young and beautiful. In the Swedish folktale ''Little Rosa and Long Leda'', an elvish woman (''älvakvinna'') arrives in the end and saves the heroine, Little Rose, on condition that the king's cattle no longer graze on her hill. She is described as a beautiful old woman and by her aspect people saw that she belonged to the ''subterraneans''.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Lilla Rosa och Långa Leda|title=Svenska folksagor|year=1984|publisher=Almquist & Wiksell Förlag AB|location=Stockholm|page=158}}</ref>

In Iceland, expression of belief in the cognate [[huldufólk]] or 'hidden people', the elves that dwell in rock formations, is still relatively common. Even when Icelanders do not explicitly express their belief, they are often reluctant to express disbelief.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novatoadvance.com/articles/2007/10/24/novato_living/doc471fb91b8f622734769663.txt |title=Novatoadvance.com, Chasing waterfalls ... and elves |publisher=Novatoadvance.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref> A 2006 and 2007 study on [[Superstition Mountain|superstition]] by the University of Iceland’s Faculty of Social Sciences revealed that many would not rule out the existence of elves and [[ghosts]], a result similar to a 1974 survey by [[Erlendur Haraldsson]]. The lead researcher, [[Terry Gunnell]] stated: 'Icelanders seem much more open to phenomena like dreaming the future, forebodings, ghosts and elves than other nations'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/?cat_id=40764&ew_0_a_id=290137 |title=Icelandreview.com, Iceland Still Believes in Elves and Ghosts |publisher=Icelandreview.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref>

==Modern popular culture==

With industrialisation and mass education, traditional folklore about elves waned, but as the phenomenon of popular culture emerged, elves were reimagined, in large part on the basis of Romantic literary depictions and associated medievalism.

===Christmas elf===
{{Main|Christmas elf}}
As American Christmas traditions crystallized in the nineteenth century, the 1823 poem '[[A Visit from St. Nicholas]]' (widely known as '’Twas the Night before Christmas') characterized St Nicholas himself as 'a right jolly old elf' (line 45), but it was the little helpers that were later attributed to him to whom the name stuck. Thus in the USA, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Ireland the modern children's [[folklore]] of [[Santa Claus]] typically includes green-clad elves with pointy ears, long noses, and pointy hats as Santa's helpers or hired workers. They make the toys in a workshop located in the [[North Pole]]. In this portrayal, elves slightly resemble nimble and delicate versions of the elves in English folktakes in the Victorian period from which they derived. The role of elves as Santa's helpers has continued to be popular, as evidenced by the success of the popular Christmas movie ''[[Elf (film)|Elf]]''.

===Fantasy fiction===
{{Main|Elves in fantasy fiction and games}}
[[File:Elf markwoman by Kitty.png|thumb|Typical illustration of a female elf in the high fantasy style.]]
The [[fantasy]] genre in the twentieth century grew out of nineteenth-century [[Romanticism]], in which nineteenth-century scholars such as [[Andrew Lang]] and the [[Grimm brothers]] collected '[[fairy-stories]]' from folklore and in some cases retold them freely.

A pioneering work of the fantasy genre was ''[[The King of Elfland's Daughter]]'', a 1924 novel by [[Lord Dunsany]]. [[Elves (Middle-earth)|Elves]] played a central role in [[Tolkien's legendarium]], notably ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''; this legendarium was enormously influential on subsequent fantasy writing. Tolkien's writing has such popularity that in the 1960s and afterwards, elves speaking an elvish language similar to those in Tolkien's novels (like [[Quenya]], and [[Sindarin]]) became staple non-human characters in [[high fantasy]] works and in fantasy [[role-playing game]]s. Post-Tolkien fantasy elves (popularized by the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' [[role-playing game]]) tend to be more beautiful and wiser than humans, with sharper senses and perceptions. They are said to be gifted in [[magic (fantasy)|magic]], mentally sharp and lovers of nature, art, and song. They are often skilled archers. A hallmark of many fantasy elves is their pointed [[ear]]s.

In works where elves are the main characters, such as ''The Silmarillion'' or Wendy and Richard Pini’s comic book series ''[[Elfquest]]'', elves exhibit a similar range of behaviour to a human cast, distinguished largely by their superhuman physical powers. However, where narratives are more human-centered, as in ''The Lord of the Rings'', elves tend to sustain their role as powerful, sometimes threatening, outsiders.<ref>Bergman 2011.</ref>
