Abu Bakr had thus the honour of being the First Amir-ul-Hajj in the history of<space/><link><target>Islam</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Some time after Abu Bakr and his party had left for Hajj, Muhammad received a revelation about the regulation of the Hajj, and the ordering of relationships with the infidels. It is related that when this revelation came, some one suggested to Muhammad that he should send news of it to Abu Bakr. Muhammad said that only a man of his house could proclaim the revelation.</paragraph><paragraph>Muhammad summoned Ali, and asked him to proclaim the revealed verses to the people on the day of sacrifice when they assembled at<space/><link><target>Mina, Saudi Arabia</target><part>Mina</part></link>. Ali went forth on Muhammad's slit-eared camel, and overtook Abu Bakr. When Ali joined the party, Abu Bakr wanted to know whether he had come to give orders or to convey them. Ali said that he had not come to replace Abu Bakr as Amir-ul-Hajj, and that his only mission was to convey a special message to the people on behalf of Muhammad.</paragraph><paragraph>At Mecca, Abu Bakr presided at the Hajj ceremony, and Ali read the proclamation on behalf of Muhammad. The main points of the proclamation were:</paragraph><list type='numbered'><listitem>Henceforward the non-Muslims were not to be allowed to visit the<space/><link><target>Kaaba</target></link><space/>or perform the pilgrimage.</listitem><listitem>No one should circumambulate the Kaaba naked.</listitem><listitem><link><target>Polytheism</target></link><space/>was not to be tolerated. Where the Muslims had any agreement with the polytheists such agreements would be honoured for the stipulated periods. Where there were no agreements a grace period of four months was provided and thereafter no quarter was to be given to the polytheists.</listitem></list><paragraph>From the day this proclamation was made a new era dawned in<space/><link><target>Arabia</target></link>. Henceforward Islam alone was to be supreme in Arabia.</paragraph><paragraph>In some quarters an argument is advanced that as on this occasion the proclamation was read by<space/><link><target>Ali</target></link><space/>on behalf of<space/><link><target>Muhammad</target></link>, this establishes the precedence of Ali over Abu Bakr, and that therefore when after the death of Muhammad, Abu Bakr became the<space/><link><target>Caliph</target></link><space/>in disregard of the claims of Ali, he was a usurper.</paragraph><paragraph>On this occasion Ali did not replace Abu Bakr as Amir-ul-Hajj. Ali was merely assigned a special mission to read the proclamation as according to Muhammad only a man from his own house could communate the revelation. We can thus say that on this occasion Abu Bakr represented the temporal side, while Ali represented the spiritual side. After the death of Muhammad there was no longer the question of any spiritual representation; the issue was only temporal representation, and for this Abu Bakr was the best choice as he had thus represented Muhammad even in his lifetime.<extension extension_name='ref'>SIDIQ-I-AKBAR HAZRAT ABU BAKR by PROF.

In his fatal illness, Muhammad came out with a piece of cloth tied around his head and sat on the pulpit.

He dismounted and entered the Prophet's Mosque, but did not speak to anyone until he entered upon 'Aa'isha. He went straight to Muhammad who was covered with Hibra cloth (a kind of Yemenite cloth). He then uncovered Muhammad's face and bowed over him and kissed him and wept, saying, &quot;Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you. By Allah, Allah will never cause you to die twice.

Examples of these include Muhammad specifically designating Abu Bakr to lead the Muslims in prayer in his last days when he was too ill to lead the prayer.

Several Arabic tribes revolted against Abu Bakr. In four of the six centres of the insurrection, the rebels rallied around people who claimed to be prophets, the most prominent among them being<space/><link><target>Musaylimah</target></link>. The tribes claimed that they had submitted to Muhammad only, and that with Muhammad's death, their allegiance had ended. This was common practice in pre-Islamic Arabia. After the death of a tribal leader the alliance with the tribe of that leader was regarded as having ended.<extension extension_name='ref' name="blewis"></extension><space/>Thus several tribes acted in accordance to this pre-Islamic practice and refused to pay<space/><italics><link><target>Zakat</target></link></italics>. Abu Bakr, however, insisted that they had not just submitted to a simple human leader but joined the Muslim religious community, of which he was the new head. So, in contrast to pre-Islamic times, their allegiance was not seen as having ended at all.</paragraph><paragraph>This was the start of the<space/><italics>Ridda Wars</italics><space/>(<link><target>Arabic language</target><part>Arabic</part></link><space/>for the Wars of Apostasy).

It is said that after the hard-won victory over Musaylimah in the Battle of Yamama fought in 632, Umar (the later Caliph Umar), saw that many of the Muslims who had memorized the<space/><italics>Qur'an</italics><space/>( about 300 to 700) had died in battle. Fearing that the Qur'an may be lost or corrupted, Umar requested the Caliph Abu Bakr to authorize the compilation and preservation of the scriptures in written format. After initial hesitation, Abu Bakr made a committee headed by<space/><link><target>Zayd ibn Thabit</target></link><space/>which included the memorizers of the<space/><italics>Qur'an</italics><space/>and Umar and to collect all verses of the book.

After they were satisfied that they had not missed out any verse or made any mistakes in reading or writing it down, the text was written down as one single manuscript and presented in codex form to the Caliph Abu Bakr.

Prior to his death, Umar gave this book to his daughter<space/><link><target>Hafsa bint Umar</target></link>, who was one of the wives of Muhammad. Umar did not nominate his successor on his deathbed, and thus preferred to leave this copy with Hafsa so as not to indicate his personal preference of who would be the next caliph.

There were three purposes for this conquest: 1. Along the borders between Arabia and these two great empires were numerous Arab tribes leading a nomadic life and forming a buffer-like state between the Persians and Romans. Abu Bakr hoped that these tribes might accept Islam and help their brethren in spreading it. 2. The Persian and Roman taxation laws were arbitrary and oppressive; Abu Bakr believed that they might be persuaded to help the Muslims, who sought to release them from injustice. 3. Two gigantic empires surrounded Arabia, and it was unsafe to remain passive with these two powers on its borders. Abu Bakr hoped that by attacking Iraq and Syria he might remove the danger from the borders of the Islamic State.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Najeebabadi">Akbar Shah Najeebabadi, The history of Islam.

Muthanna ibn Harithah went to Medina to inform Caliph Abu Bakr about his success and was appointed commander of his people, after which he began to raid deeper into Iraq.

The problems faced by Abu Bakr were that the<space/><link><target>Arab</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>feared the Persians with a deep, unreasoning fear which ran in the tribal consciousness as a racial complex and was the result of centuries of Persian power and glory. In return the Persian regarded the Arab with contempt. It was important not to suffer a defeat, for that would confirm and strengthen this instinctive fear. To make certain of victory, Abu Bakr decided on two measures; that the invading army would consist entirely of volunteers; and he put in command of the army his best general Khalid ibn al-Walid. After defeating the self-proclaimed prophet Musaylimah in the Battle of Yamama, Khalid was still at<space/><link><target>Al-Yamama</target></link><space/>when Abu Bakr sent him orders to invade the Sassanid Empire. Making<space/><link><target>Al-Hirah</target></link><space/>the objective of Khalid, Abu Bakr sent reinforcements and ordered the tribal chiefs of north eastern Arabia, Muthanna ibn Harithah, Mazhur bin Adi, Harmala and Sulma to operate under the command of Khalid along with their men. In the third week of March 633 (first week of<space/><link><target>Muharram</target></link><space/>12th Hijrah) Khalid set out from Al-Yamama with an army of 10,000.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Tabari"></extension><space/>The tribal chiefs, with 2,000 warriors each, joined Khalid; Thus Khalid entered the Persian Empire with 18,000 troops.</paragraph><paragraph>After entering<space/><link><target>Iraq</target></link><space/>with his army of 18,000, Khalid won decisive victories in four consecutive battles:<space/><link><target>Battle of Chains</target></link>, fought in April 633;<space/><link><target>Battle of River</target></link>, fought in the 3rd week of April 633;<space/><link><target>Battle of Walaja</target></link>, fought in May 633 (where he successfully used a<space/><link><target>Pincer movement</target><part>double envelopment</part></link><space/>manoeuvre), and<space/><link><target>Battle of Ullais</target></link>, fought in the mid of May 633.

By now, almost the whole of Iraq (Euphrates region) was under Islamic control. Khalid got a call of help from northern Arabia at Daumat-ul-Jandal, where another Muslim Arab general, Ayaz bin Ghanam, was trapped among the rebel tribes. Khalid went to Daumat-ul-jandal and defeated the rebels in the<space/><link><target>Battle of Daumat-ul-jandal</target></link><space/>in the last week of August 633. Returning from Arabia, he got news of the assembling of a large Persian army. He decided to defeat them all separately to avoid the risk of defeat to a large unified Persian army. Four divisions of Persian and<space/><link><target>Christian</target></link><space/>Arab auxiliaries were present at Hanafiz, Zumiel, Sanni and Muzieh. Khalid devised a brilliant plan to destroy the Persian forces. He divided his army in three units, and attacked the Persian forces in brilliantly coordinated attacks from three different sides at night, starting from the<space/><link><target>Battle of Muzieh</target></link>, then the<space/><link><target>Battle of Sanni</target></link>, and finally the<space/><link><target>Battle of Zumail</target></link><space/>during November 633. These devastating defeats ended Persian control over Iraq, and left the Persian capital<space/><link><target>Ctesiphon</target></link><space/>unguarded and vulnerable to Muslim attacks. Before attacking the Persian Capital, Khalid decided to eliminate the Persian forces to the south and west. He accordingly marched against the border city of Firaz, where he defeated the combined forces of the<space/><link><target>Sassanid army</target><part>Sassanid Persians</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Byzantine army</target><part>Byzantine</part></link><space/><link><target>Roman army</target><part>Romans</part></link><space/>and Christian Arabs in the<space/><link><target>Battle of Firaz</target></link><space/>in December 633. This was the last battle in his conquest of Iraq. While Khalid was on his way to attack Qadissiyah, a key fort in the way to Persian Capital Ctesiphon, he received the letter of Caliph Abu Bakr and was sent to Roman front in Syria to assume the command of Muslim armies to conquer Roman Syria.<extension extension_name='ref'>Akram, chapters 1926.</extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Invasion of Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire</heading><paragraph><template><target>Further</target><arg>Muslim conquest of Syria</arg></template><link><target>File:Mohammad adil-Muslims Invasion of Syria.PNG</target><part>thumb</part><part>300px</part><part>Map detailing Rashidun Caliphates invasion of Levant.</part></link>With a successful invasion of Sassanid Persian province of Iraq, Abu Bakrs confidence grew. He concentrated four large corps at Zhu Qissah and sent them to Roman Syria. Each corps was assigned its own commander and its own target. The leaders of the different corps received intelligence of a concentration of large Byzantine armies at Ajnadayn while on the march. The army stopped its advance and the leaders wrote to Abu Bakr for help. Since the Muslim position in Iraq was stable by now, the Caliph accordingly wrote to Khalid to take half of his forces of Iraq to Syria and to assume command of all Muslim armies in Byzantine Syria. The Byzantine province of Syria in those days consisted of modern-day Syria,<space/><link><target>Jordan</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Israel</target></link>, the<space/><link><target>Palestinian territories</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Lebanon</target></link><space/>and southern<space/><link><target>Turkey</target></link>. There were two routes towards Syria from Iraq, one was via Daumat-ul-Jandal and the other was through Mesopotamia passing though<space/><link><target>Ar Raqqah</target></link>. Since it was believed that the Muslim armies in Syria were in need of urgent reinforcement, Khalid avoided the conventional route to Syria via Daumat ul Jandal because it was a long route and would take weeks to reach Syria. He also did not take the Mesopotamian route because Roman garrisons held northern Syria and northern Mesopotamia. A conflict with these Roman forces would have forced Khalid to spend too much time while Muslim armies were being outflanked in Syria. Khalid selected, instead, a short and unconventional route to Syria, passing though the<space/><link><target>Syrian Desert</target></link>. Although probably hyperbole, some sources state that his soldiers marched for two days without a single drop of water before reaching an oasis that Khalid had selected in advance. Khalid thus entered Northern Syria at a point where he was least expected, catching the Byzantine forces on their right flank. More recent historians have suggested that this surprises attack unhinged the Byzantine defenses in Syria.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Mohammad adil-Muslim invasion of Syria-2.PNG</target><part>thumb</part><part>300px</part><part>Map detailing the route of Khalid ibn Walid's invasion of Syria.</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>Khalid entered Syria in June 634 and quickly captured the border forts of<space/><link><target>Sawa, Syria</target><part>Sawa</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Arak, Syria</target><part>Arak</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Tadmur</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Sukhnah</target></link>.<space/><link><target>al-Qaryatayn</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Hawarin</target></link><space/>after the battles of<space/><link><target>Battle of Qarteen</target><part>Qaryatayn</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Battle of Hawareen</target><part>Hawarin</part></link>. After dealing with all these cities, Khalid moved towards<space/><link><target>Damascus</target></link>, passing though a mountain pass which is now known as Sanita-al-Uqab (Uqab pass) after the name of Khalid's army standard. From here he moved away from Damascus, towards<space/><link><target>Bosra</target></link>, the capital of Ghassanid Arab kingdom, a vassal of Eastern Roman empire. He had ordered other Muslim commanders to concentrate their armies at Bosra, which were still near the Syrian-Arabia border. At Maraj-al-Rahab, Khalid defeated a<space/><link><target>Ghassanids</target><part>Ghassanid</part></link><space/>army of Christian Arabs in a quick<space/><link><target>Battle of Marj Rahit (634)</target><part>Battle of Marj-al-Rahit</part></link>. Meanwhile, Abu Ubaida ibn al-Jarrah, the supreme commander of Muslim armies in Syria had ordered Shurhabil ibn Hasana to attack<space/><link><target>Bosra</target></link>. The latter laid siege of<space/><link><target>Bosra</target></link><space/>with his small army of 4000 men. Roman and Ghassanid Arab garrison, noticing that this might be the advance guard of the larger Muslim army to come, decided to attack and destroy Shurhabils army. They came out of the fortified city and attacked Shurhabil, surrounding him from all sides; Khalid reached the arena with his advance guard cavalry and saved the day for Shurhabil. The combined forces of Khalid, Shurhabil and Abu Ubaidah then laid the<space/><link><target>Battle of Bosra</target><part>siege of Bosra</part></link>, which surrendered some time in mid July 634. thus effectively ending the Ghassanid Dynasty.</paragraph><paragraph>Here Khalid took over the command of Muslim armies in Syria from Abu Ubaidah, as per the instructions of Caliph. The massive Byzantine armies were concentrating at Ajnadayn to push the invading armies back to desert. Early Muslim sources have mentioned its size to be 90,000, while most of the modern historians doubt the figures, but consider this battle to be the key to breaking the Byzantine power in Syria. According to the instructions of Khalid all Muslim corps concentrated at Ajnadayn, where they fought a decisive battle against Byzantine on 30 July 634.Defeat at the<space/><link><target>Battle of Ajnadayn</target></link>, left Syria vulnerable to the Muslim invaders. Khalid decided to capture Damascus, the Byzantine stronghold. At Damascus Thomas, son in law of Emperor<space/><link><target>Heraclius</target></link>, was in charge. Receiving the intelligence of Khalid's march towards Damascus he prepared for the defences of Damascus. He wrote to Emperor Heraclius for reinforcement, who was at Emesa that time. Moreover, Thomas, in order to get more time for preparation of a siege, sent the armies to delay or if possible halt Khalid's march to Damascus, one such army was defeated at<space/><link><target>Battle of Yaqusa</target></link><space/>in mid-August 634 near<space/><link><target>Lake Tiberias</target></link><space/>90 miles from Damascus, another army that halted the Muslim advance to Damascus was defeated in<space/><link><target>battle of Maraj-al-Safar</target><part>Battle of Maraj as Saffer</part></link><space/>on 19 August 634. These engagements delayed Khalids advance and gave Thomas enough time to prepare for siege. Meanwhile, Heraclius's reinforcement had reached the city, which he had dispatched after the bad news of Ajnadyn. Before Heraclius's another regiment could reach Damascus, Khalid had finally reached Damascus. Khalid reached Damascus on 20 August and besieged the city. To isolate the city from rest of the region, Khalid placed the detachments south on the road to Palestine and in north at Damascus-Emesa route, and several other smaller detachments on routes towards Damascus. Heraclius's reinforcement was intercepted and routed at the<space/><link><target>Battle of Sanita-al-Uqab</target></link>, 20 miles from Damascus. Khalid's forces withstood three Roman sallies that tried to break the siege. Khalid finally attacked and<space/><link><target>Conquest of Damascus</target><part>conquered Damascus</part></link><space/>on 18 September 634 after a 30-day siege. According to some sources the siege lasted for four or six months. Heraclius, having received the news of the fall of Damascus, left for<space/><link><target>Antioch</target></link><space/>from<space/><link><target>Emesa</target></link>. The citizens were given peace on the terms of annual tribute; the<space/><link><target>Byzantine army</target></link><space/>was given a three-day peace to go as far as they could. After the three-day deadline was over, the Muslim cavalry under Khalid's command attacked the Roman army, catching up to them using an unknown shortcut, at the<space/><link><target>Battle of Maraj-al-Debaj</target></link>, 190 miles north of Damascus. Abu Bakr died during the<space/><link><target>Conquest of Damascus</target><part>siege of Damascus</part></link><space/>and Umar became the new Caliph. He dismissed his cousin Khalid ibn al-Walid from the command and appointed<space/><link><target>Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah</target></link><space/>the new commander in chief of Islamic army in Syria.

There are also Al-Atiqi or Atiqi Families in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Syria, Yemen, Iraq and other places in the Arabia Peninsula. All the descendants of Abu Bakr, their Ancestors are: Abdurahman Ibn Abu Bakr and Muhammad Ibn Abu Bakr. The Al-Bakri Family in Egypt are the descendants of Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr while the sheekhaal or Fiqi Umar Family found in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya and the Aala Atiq Families found in the Arabia Peninsula are the descendants of Abdurahman Ibn Abu Bakr.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Legacy</heading><paragraph>Abu Bakr became the Caliph on 8 June 632<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">June 2013</arg></template><space/>and he died on 23 August 634.

He is regarded as Khalifa Rasulullah<space/><italics>The successor of Messenger of Allah</italics>, and first of the Rightly Guided Caliphs i.e.<space/><link><target>Rashidun</target></link><space/>and being the rightful successor to Muhammad. Abu Bakr had always been the closest friend and confidant of Muhammad throughout his life. He was always there beside Muhammad at every major event. It was Abu Bakr's wisdom that Muhammad always honored. Abu Bakr is regarded to be among best persons from the followers of Muhammad, as Umar ibn Khattab stated that If the faith of Abu Bakr was weighed against the faith of the people of the earth, the faith of Abu Bakr would outweigh the others.<extension extension_name='ref'>Narrated by al-Bayhaqi in al-Jamia lashuab al-Eemaan (1:18) and its narrators are trustworthy.</extension><space/>During the last few weeks of his life, Muhammad preferred Abu Bakr to lead the Muslims in prayer while he was ill. Upon Muhammad's death, it was Abu Bakr who demonstrated sagacity to keep the ranks of the Muslims together. Muhammad had not left behind a clear will on who would succeed him. There was dissension between the two original tribes of Medina, namely<space/><link><target>Banu Aus</target><part>Aws</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Khazraj</target></link><space/>regarding who would become the ruler over the Muslims after Muhammad. This even led to drawing of swords between them.

In turn, Umar declared his allegiance to Abu Bakr saying that there is no better man amongst the Muslims after Muhammad. The majority of the sahaba (companions of Muhammad) assembled there followed suit and pledged their allegiance to Abu Bakr. Sunnis point out this fact of avoiding bloodshed between Muslims and preserving the unity of the state as of paramount importance, or it would have led to self-destruction of the new state. The famous scholar Imam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal also stated that he is among the foremost companions (sahaba) of Muhammad.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Shia view</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Shi'a view of Abu Bakr</arg></template><space/><template><target>See also</target><arg>Umar at Fatimah's house</arg><arg>Succession to Muhammad</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>Twelver</target></link><space/><link><target>Shia Islam</target><part>Shia</part></link><space/>have a different view of Abu Bakr.

She asked for the Sadaqa (i.e. wealth assigned for charitable purposes) of the Prophet at Medina, and Fadak, and what remained of the Khumus (i.e., one-fifth) of the Khaibar booty. Abu Bakr said, &quot;Allah's Apostle said, 'We (Prophets), our property is not inherited, and whatever we leave is Sadaqa, but Muhammad's Family can eat from this property, i.e. Allah's property, but they have no right to take more than the food they need.'

I will not bring any change in dealing with the Sadaqa of the Prophet (and will keep them) as they used to be observed in his (i.e. the Prophet's) life-time, and I will dispose with it as Allah's Apostle used to do,&quot; Then 'Ali said, &quot;I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and that Muhammad is His Apostle,&quot; and added, &quot;O Abu Bakr! We acknowledge your superiority.&quot; Then he (i.e. 'Ali) mentioned their own relationship to Allah's Apostle and their right. Abu Bakr then spoke saying, &quot;By Allah in Whose Hands my life is.
