{{About|an incantational word}}
'''''Abracadabra''''' is an [[incantation]] used as a [[magic word]] in [[stage magic]] tricks, and historically was believed to have healing powers when inscribed on an [[amulet]].<!-- {{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} - citation provided below -->

== Etymology ==
The word may have its origin in the [[Aramaic language]], but numerous conflicting folk etymologies are associated with it.

The word ''Abracadabra'' may derive from an Aramaic phrase meaning "I create as I speak." <ref>{{cite book|last=Kushner|first=Lawrence|title=The Book of Words: Talking Spiritual Life, Living Spiritual Talk|date=1998|publisher=Jewish Lights Publishing|isbn=1580230202|page=11|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hhtaTSSZmDYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22The+Book+of+Words%22+kushner+abracadabra&hl=en&sa=X&ei=RMHrUvvoJJLksAT7qoHYDg&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22The%20Book%20of%20Words%22%20kushner%20abracadabra&f=false}}</ref> or from the Greek "Αύρα κατ' αύρα" meaning "from Αura to Aura". This etymology is dubious, however, as אברא כדברא in Aramaic is more reasonably translated "I create like the word." In the [[Hebrew language]], אברא translates as "I will create" and כדברא "as spoken". The second lexeme in this supposedly Aramaic phrase might be a noun given the presence of the definite article{{Citation needed|date=August 2014|reason=How do we know the definite article is present, especially as Abracadabra is a ''derivation'' and ''transliteration'' of this alleged Aramaic phrase}} on the end of the word (it cannot be an infinitive construct, as the infinitive cannot take the definite article). Regardless, this phrase would actually be pronounced ''ebra kidbara'', which is clearly different from ''abracadabra''{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}. 

"[A]bracadabra may comprise the abbreviated forms of the Hebrew words ''Ab'' (Father), ''Ben'' (Son) and ''Ruach A Cadsch'' (Holy Spirit), though an alternative derivation relates the word to [[Abraxas]], a god with snakes for feet who was worshipped in Alexandria in pre-Christian times."<ref>''Dictionary of Superstitions'', David Pickering, Cassell Wellington House, 1995, 1</ref> David Pickering's description of the word as an abbreviation from Hebrew is also a false etymology—as he apparently here means Aramaic (בר is Aramaic for "son", it is בן in Hebrew, although בר is an honorific form), nor does he account for the final five letters (i.e., -dabra) in the lexeme.

==History==
The first known mention of the word was in the third century AD in a book called ''Liber Medicinalis'' (sometimes known as ''De Medicina Praecepta Saluberrima'') by [[Serenus Sammonicus|Quintus Serenus Sammonicus]],<ref name="Vollmer">Vollmer, Friedrich. ''Quinti Sereni Liber Medicinalis''. Leipzig: Teubner, 1916, chap. [http://books.google.it/books?id=y5FOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=abracadabra&f=false LII, v. 4].</ref> [[physician]] to the [[Roman emperor]] [[Caracalla]], who in chapter 51 prescribed that [[malaria]]<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/NA_WSJ_PUB:SB10001424052748704111704575354911834340450.html "The Tenacious Buzz of Malaria"]. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. July 10, 2010.</ref> sufferers wear an amulet containing the word written in the form of a triangle:<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/61/21/A0022100.html Bartleby]</ref>

The power of the amulet, he explained, makes lethal diseases go away. Other Roman emperors, including [[Publius Septimius Geta|Geta]] and [[Alexander Severus]], were followers of the medical teachings of Serenus Sammonicus and may have used the incantation as well.<ref name="Vollmer" />

It was used as a [[magical formula]] by the [[Gnostic]]s of the sect of [[Basilides]] in invoking the aid of beneficent spirits against disease and misfortune.<ref name="EB1911">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Abracadabra}}</ref> It is found on [[Abraxas stones]], which were worn as amulets. Subsequently, its use spread beyond the Gnostics.

The Puritan minister [[Increase Mather]] dismissed the word as bereft of power. [[Daniel Defoe]] also wrote dismissively about Londoners who posted the word on their doorways to ward off sickness during the [[Great Plague of London]].<ref>Daniel Defoe. [http://www.archive.org/stream/journalofplagu00defo#page/38/mode/2up ''A Journal of the Plague Year'']. London, Dent, 1911 (1722)</ref> But [[Aleister Crowley]] regarded it as possessing great power; he said its true form is [[abrahadabra]].<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia

The word is now commonly used as an [[incantation]] by stage magicians. It is also applied [[contempt]]uously to a conception or hypothesis purporting to be a simple solution of apparently insoluble phenomena.

During an audience interview at the [[Edinburgh Book Festival]] on 15 April 2004, series author [[J. K. Rowling]] had this to say about the fictional Killing Curse's etymology: "Does anyone know where ''avada kedavra'' came from? It is an ancient spell in Aramaic, and it is the original of abracadabra, which means 'let the thing be destroyed.' Originally, it was used to cure illness and the 'thing' was the illness, but I decided to make it the 'thing' as in the person standing in front of me. I take a lot of liberties with things like that. I twist them round and make them mine." <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/news_view.cfm?id=80 |title=J K Rowling at the Edinburgh Book Festival |work=J. K.
