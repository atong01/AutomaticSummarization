Any person who feels his or her rights have been violated under the Convention by a state party can take a case to the Court.

The<space/><link><target>Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe</target></link><space/>monitors the execution of judgements, particularly to ensure payment of the amounts awarded by the Court to the applicants in compensation for the damage they have sustained. The establishment of a Court to protect individuals from human rights violations is an innovative feature for an international convention on human rights, as it gives the individual an active role on the international arena (traditionally, only states are considered actors in<space/><link><target>international law</target></link>). The European Convention is still the only international human rights agreement providing such a high degree of individual protection.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">April 2015</arg></template><space/>State parties can also take cases against other state parties to the Court, although this power is rarely used.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">April 2015</arg></template><space/></paragraph><paragraph>The Convention has several<space/><link><target>protocol (treaty)</target><part>protocol</part><trail>s</trail></link>, which amend the convention framework.</paragraph><heading level='2'>History</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Stamp 2010 HR Convention-60 (1).jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Ukrainian stamp, commemorating 60 years of European Convention on Human Rights</part></link><space/><template><target>see also</target><arg>European Court of Human Rights</arg></template>The European Convention on Human Rights has played an important role in the development and awareness of Human Rights in Europe.The development of a regional system of human rights protection operating across Europe can be seen as a direct response to twin concerns.

Second, the Convention was a response to the growth of Communism in Central and Eastern Europe and designed to protect the member states of the<space/><link><target>Council of Europe</target></link><space/>from communist subversion. This, in part, explains the constant references to values and principles that are &quot;necessary in a democratic society&quot; throughout the Convention, despite the fact that such principles are not in any way defined within the convention itself.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last">Ovey</arg><arg name="first">Clare</arg><arg name="title">The European Convention on Human Rights</arg><arg name="publisher">Oxford University Press</arg><arg name="isbn">978-01-992881-0-6</arg><arg name="pages">1â€“3</arg><arg name="author2">Robin C.A.

Over 100 parliamentarians from the twelve member states of the Council of Europe gathered in Strasbourg in the summer of 1949 for the first ever meeting of the Council's Consultative Assembly to draft a &quot;charter of human rights&quot; and to establish a court to enforce it. British MP and lawyer Sir<space/><link><target>David Maxwell-Fyfe</target></link>, the Chair of the Assembly's Committee on Legal and Administrative Questions, was one of its leading members and guided the drafting of the Convention. As a prosecutor at the<space/><link><target>Nuremberg Trials</target></link>, he had seen first-hand how international justice could be effectively applied. With his help, the French former minister and Resistance fighter<space/><link><target>Pierre-Henri Teitgen</target></link><space/>submitted a report<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://assembly.coe.int/Conferences/2009Anniversaire49/DocRef/Teitgen6.pdf'>Report by Pierre-Henri Teitgen of France, submitted to the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe</link></extension><space/>to the Assembly proposing a list of rights to be protected, selecting a number from the<space/><link><target>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</target></link><space/>just agreed to in New York, and defining how the enforcing judicial mechanism might operate.

The Convention was opened for signature on 4 November 1950 in Rome. It was ratified and entered into force on 3 September 1953. It is overseen and enforced by the<space/><link><target>European Court of Human Rights</target></link><space/>in Strasbourg, and the<space/><link><target>Council of Europe</target></link>.

The Court has defended this on the grounds that the article was intended to apply only to different-sex marriage, and that a wide margin of appreciation must be granted to parties in this area.</paragraph><paragraph>In<space/><italics><link><target>Goodwin v United Kingdom</target></link></italics><space/>the Court ruled that a law which still classified post-operative<space/><link><target>transsexual</target></link><space/>persons under their pre-operative sex, violated article 12 as it meant that transsexual persons were unable to marry individuals of their post-operative opposite sex. This reversed an earlier ruling in<space/><italics><link><target>Rees v United Kingdom</target></link></italics>. This did not, however, alter the Court's understanding that Article 12 protects only different-sex couples.</paragraph><paragraph>The European Court of Justice ruled in<space/><link><target>Schalk and Kopf v Austria</target></link><space/>that countries are not required to provide marriage licenses for same-sex couples, however if a country allows same-sex couple marriage it must be done so under the same conditions that opposite-sex couples marriage face: in order to prevent a breach of article 14 - the prohibition of discrimination. Additionally, the court ruled in the 2015 case of Oliari and others v Italy, that states have a positive obligation to ensure there is specific legal framework for the recognition and protection of same-sex couples.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Article 13 - effective remedy</heading><paragraph>Article 13 provides for the right for an effective<space/><link><target>legal remedy</target><part>remedy</part></link><space/>before national authorities for violations of rights under the Convention.

This prohibition is broad in some ways, and narrow in others. It is broad in that it prohibits discrimination under a potentially unlimited number of grounds. While the article specifically prohibits discrimination based on &quot;sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status&quot;, the last of these allows the court to extend to Article 14 protection to other grounds not specifically mentioned such as has been done regarding discrimination based on a person's sexual orientation.<space/></paragraph><paragraph>At the same time the article's protection is limited in that it only prohibits discrimination with respect to rights under the Convention. Thus, an applicant must prove discrimination in the enjoyment of a specific right that is guaranteed elsewhere in the Convention (e.g. discrimination based on sex - Article 14 - in the enjoyment of the right to freedom of expression - Article 10).</paragraph><paragraph>Protocol 12 extends this prohibition to cover discrimination in any legal right, even when that legal right is not protected under the Convention, so long as it is provided for in national law.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Article 15 - derogations</heading><paragraph>Article 15 allows contracting states to<space/><link><target>Derogation</target><part>derogate</part></link><space/>from certain rights guaranteed by the Convention in time of &quot;war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation&quot;.
