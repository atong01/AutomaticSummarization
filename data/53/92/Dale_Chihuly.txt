'''Dale Chihuly''' (born September 20, 1941), is an [[United States|American]] [[Glass art|glass sculptor]] and entrepreneur.  His works are considered unique to the field of [[Glassblowing|blown glass]], "moving it into the realm of large-scale sculpture".<ref>Chihuly:  Through the looking glass.  Museum of Fine Arts Boston.  Accessed April 20213.<http://www.mfa.org/exhibitions/chihuly></ref>  The technical difficulties of working with glass forms are considerable,  yet Chihuly uses it as the primary medium for installations and environmental artwork.

== Early life ==

Chihuly was born in [[Tacoma, Washington]], to George and Viola Magnuson Chihuly.<ref name = Williams>{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=David O.|title=Dale Chihuly|url=http://www.dianefarrisgallery.com/dale-chihuly/|website=Diane Farris Gallery|publisher=Diane Farris Gallery|accessdate=29 October 2014}}</ref> In 1956, his older brother and only sibling, George, died in a [[United States Navy|Navy]] Air Force training accident in [[Pensacola, Florida]].<ref name=kuspit>{{cite book|last1=Kuspit|first1=Donald B.|title=Chihuly|date=1998|publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc.|location=Seattle|edition=2nd}}</ref> Nine months later, in 1957, Chihuly's father died of a heart attack at the age of 52.<ref name= Williams/>

Initially, Chihuly had no interest in continuing his formal education after graduating from [[Woodrow Wilson High School (Tacoma, Washington)|Woodrow Wilson High School]] in 1959. However, at his mother's urging, he enrolled at the [[University of Puget Sound|College of Puget Sound]].<ref name = Williams/> A year later, he transferred to the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]] to study [[interior design]]. In 1961, he joined the [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity (Kappa Epsilon chapter). That same year he learned how to melt and fuse glass.<ref name=kuspit /> Chihuly became disillusioned with his studies, and in 1962 he dropped out of school to study art in Florence. He later traveled to the Middle East and met architect Robert Landsman. Their meeting and his time abroad spurred Chihuly to return to his studies. In 1963, he took a weaving class where he incorporated glass shards into tapestries. He received an award for his work from the Seattle Weavers Guild in 1964.<ref name=kuspit /> Chihuly graduated from the University of Washington in 1965 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in interior design.<ref name="Seattle Post Intellgencer"/>

Chihuly began experimenting with [[glassblowing]] in 1965, and in 1966 he received a full scholarship to attend the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]].<ref name=kuspit /> He studied under [[Harvey Littleton]], who had established the first glass program in the United States at the university. In 1967, Chihuly received a [[Master of Science]] degree in [[sculpture]]. After graduating, he enrolled at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]], where he met and became close friends with [[Italo Scanga]]. Chihuly earned a [[Master of Fine Arts]] degree in sculpture from the RISD in 1968. That same year, he was awarded a [[The Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation|Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation]] grant for his work in glass, as well as a [[U.S.-Italy Fulbright Commission|Fulbright Fellowship]].<ref name=kuspit /> He traveled to Venice to work at the [[Paolo Venini|Venini]] factory on the island of [[Murano]], where he first saw the team approach to blowing glass.<ref>{{cite web|title=Learn More|url=http://www.chihuly.com/learn|website=Chihuly|publisher=Chihuly Studio|accessdate=23 October 2014}} From his personal website.</ref> After returning to the United States, Chihuly spent the first of four consecutive summers teaching at the [[Haystack Mountain School of Crafts]] in [[Deer Isle, Maine]]. In 1969, he traveled to Europe, in part to meet [[Erwin Eisch]] in [[Germany]] and [[Stanislav Libenský and Jaroslava Brychtová]] in [[Czechoslovakia]].<ref name=kuspit />

==Career==
[[File:Chihuly at Kew Gardens 043.jpg|thumb|Chihuly at Kew Gardens]]
In 1971, with the support of John Hauberg and Anne Gould Hauberg, Chihuly cofounded the [[Pilchuck Glass School]] near [[Stanwood, Washington]]. Chihuly also founded the HillTop Artists program in Tacoma, Washington at [[Jason Lee Middle School (Tacoma)|Jason Lee Middle School]] and [[Woodrow Wilson High School (Tacoma, Washington)|Wilson High School]].

In 1976, while Chihuly was in England, he was involved in a head-on car accident during which he flew through the windshield.<ref name="The Stranger">[http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=30734 Glass Houses: Dale Chihuly Files a Lawsuit That Raises Big Questions... About Dale Chihuly], ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]'', February 2006</ref> His face was severely cut by glass and he was blinded in his left eye. After recovering, he continued to blow glass until he dislocated his right shoulder in a 1979 [[bodysurfing]] accident. No longer able to hold the glass blowing pipe, he hired others to do the work. Chihuly explained the change in a 2006 interview, saying "Once I stepped back, I liked the view" and pointed out that it allowed him to see the work from more perspectives and enabled him to anticipate problems faster. Chihuly describes his role as "more choreographer than dancer, more supervisor than participant, more director than actor." ''[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' reporter Erin Glass wrote that she "wonders at the vision of not just the artist Chihuly, but the wildly successful entrepreneur Chihuly, whose estimated sales by 2004 was reported by ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' as $29 million."<ref name="San Diego Union-Tribune">[http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/apr/22/chihuly-a-site-specific-explosion-of-art-at-salk ‘Chihuly’ a site-specific explosion of art at Salk], by Erin Glass, San Diego Union-Tribune, 22 April 2010</ref> Chihuly and his team of artists were the subjects of the [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''Chihuly Over Venice.'' They were also featured in the documentary ''Chihuly in the Hotshop,'' syndicated to public television stations by [[American Public Television]] starting on November 1, 2008.<ref name="Portland Press">[http://www.portlandpress.net/hotshop.html ''Chihuly Over Venice''], from Chihuly's Portland Press website</ref>

== About his work ==
Regina Hackett, as the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' art critic, provided a chronology of his work during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s:

* 1975: Navajo Blanket Series, in which patterns of [[Navajo rug|Navajo blankets]] were painted onto glass
* 1977: Northwest Coast Basket Series, baskets inspired by Northwest coast Indian baskets he'd seen as a child
* 1980: Seaform Series, transparent sculptures of thin glass, strengthened by ribbed strands of color
* 1981: Macchia Series, featuring every color available in the studio
* 1986: Persian Series, inspired by Middle East glass from the 12th- to 14th-century, featuring more restrained color and room-sized installations
* 1988: Venetian Series, improvisations based on Italian [[Art Deco]]
* 1989: Ikebana Series, glass flower arrangements inspired by [[ikebana]]
* 1990: Venetian Series returns, this time in a more eccentric form
* 1991: Niijima Floats, six-foot spheres of intricate color inspired by Japanese [[glass fishing float]]s from the island of [[Niijima]]<ref>[http://www.chihuly.com/installations/niijima ] {{wayback|url=http://www.chihuly.com/installations/niijima |date=20110826231328 }}</ref> from Chihuly's website
* 1992: [[Chandelier]]s, starting modestly but by the middle of the decade involving a ton of glass orbs and shapes that in some works look like flowers, others like breasts, and still others like snakes Chihuly has also produced a sizable volume of "Irish cylinders",<ref>[http://www.lakeview-museum.org/photos/Cylinder.jpg ] {{wayback|url=http://www.lakeview-museum.org/photos/Cylinder.jpg |date=20080627044517 }}</ref> which are more modest in conception than his blown glass works.

For his exhibition in Jerusalem in 2000, in addition to the glass pieces, he had enormous blocks of transparent ice brought in from an Alaskan [[Artesian aquifer|artesian well]] and formed a wall, echoing the stones of the nearby [[Tower of David|Citadel]]. Lights with [[color gel]]s were set up behind them for illumination. Chihuly said the melting wall represented the "dissolution of barriers" between people.<ref>{{cite web| title=Cooling a hotbed of unrest in Mideast? | url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/721087/Cooling-a-hotbed-of-unrest-in-Mideast.html| work=[[Deseret News]]| author=Cohen, Jay | date=October 4, 1999| accessdate=2010-03-01}}</ref>

== Galleries ==
[[Image:Chihuly P8040009.JPG|thumb|Yellow Chandelier at the [[Tower of David|Tower of David Museum]] 1999–2000]]

Chihuly's largest permanent exhibit can be found at the [[Oklahoma City Museum of Art]]. Chihuly maintains two retail stores in partnership with [[MGM Resorts International]]. One is located at the [[Bellagio (resort and casino)|Bellagio]] on the [[Las Vegas Strip]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bellagio.com/shopping/via-fiore.aspx |title=List of stores |publisher=Bellagio.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-20}}</ref> the other at the [[MGM Grand Macau|MGM Grand Casino]] in [[Macau]].<ref>[http://www.trimaran.com.hk/files/MGM_Grand%20Opening_Press%20Release%20(Eng-final).pdf Press release by MGM Macau mentioning Chihuly shop (search for "Chihuly retail")] {{wayback|url=http://www.trimaran.com.hk/files/MGM_Grand%20Opening_Press%20Release%20(Eng-final).pdf |date=20120319203808 }}</ref> A number of other galleries also carry his pieces. He also has a gallery in Las Vegas in the Crystals in the Las Vegas City Center in Gallery Row. In 1983 Chihuly returned to his native Pacific Northwest where he continued to develop his own work at the Pilchuck Glass School, which he had helped to found in 1971. Throughout the 1970s, influenced by the great glassblowing tradition of Murano, Chihuly experimented with the team approach to glassblowing. Working with a team of master glassblowers and assistants has enabled him to produce architectural glass art of a scale and quantity unimaginable working alone or with only one assistant. In 2010 the [[Space Needle]] Corporation submitted a proposal for an exhibition of Chihuly's work at a site in the [[Seattle Center]], in competition with proposals for other uses from several other groups.<ref>{{citation |url= http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2011299316_glasshouse09m.html |title= Chihuly glass museum proposed at Seattle Center where Fun Forest stood |first= Emily |last= Heffter |date = 10 June 2010 | newspaper= [[Seattle Times]] }}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2012083798_chihuly11m.html |title=In a second attempt to sell the city and the public on a Dale Chihuly glass exhibit at Seattle Center |first= Emily |last= Heffter |date = 10 June 2010 | newspaper= [[Seattle Times]] }}</ref> The project, which sees the new Chihuly exhibition hall occupy the site of the former Fun Forest amusement park in the Seattle Center park and entertainment complex, received the final green light from the Seattle City Council on April 25, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Ben|title=Divisive Dale Chihuly Glass-Art 'Museum' Approved for Former Seattle Amusement Park|url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/37553/divisive-dale-chihuly-glass-art-museum-approved-for-former-seattle-amusement-park|publisher=ArtInfo|accessdate=30 November 2012|date=28 April 2011}}</ref> Called [[Chihuly Garden and Glass]], it opened May 21, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chihuly Garden and Glass Opens with Dedication Ceremony on Monday, May 21|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chihuly-garden-and-glass-opens-with-dedication-ceremony-on-monday-may-21-152260115.html|publisher=PRNewswire|accessdate=30 November 2012|date=21 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Riefe|first=Jordan|title=Dale Chihuly's 'Glass House' Shines in Seattle|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/21/uk-dalechihuly-pix-idUSLNE84K00C20120521|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=30 November 2012|date=21 May 2012}}</ref>

== 2006 lawsuit ==
In 2006, Chihuly filed a lawsuit against his former longtime employee, glassblower Bryan Rubino, and businessman Robert Kaindl, under accusations of copyright and trademark infringement. Kaindl's pieces used titles Chihuly used for his own works, such as Seaforms and Ikebana, and resembled the construction of Chihuly's pieces. Arguments made by legal experts stated influence on art style is not copyright infringement.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/06/11/Floridian/Glass_warfare.shtml |title=Glass warfare |work=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |date=2006-06-11 |accessdate=2012-12-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=O'Hagan |first=Maureen |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2002686721_chihuly16m.html |title=Glass artist Chihuly's lawsuit tests limits of copyrighting art |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=2005-12-20|accessdate=2012-12-20}}</ref> Chihuly settled the lawsuit independently with Rubino initially,<ref>{{cite news |title=Artists Chihuly, Rubino settle claims; suit against entrepreneur unresolved | url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2003199340_chihuly15m.html |work=The Seattle Times| author=Sheila Farr and Susan Kelleher |date=2006-08-15 |accessdate=2010-02-25}}</ref> and later Kaindl as well.<ref>{{cite work |last=Kelleher |first=Susan |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003484492_chihuly19m.html |title=Chihuly, rival glass artist settle dispute |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=2006-12-19 |accessdate=2012-12-20}}</ref>
