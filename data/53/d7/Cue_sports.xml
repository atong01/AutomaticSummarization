</arg></template></extension><space/>The modern term &quot;cue sports&quot; can be used to encompass the ancestral mace games, and even the modern cueless variants, such as finger billiards, for historical reasons. &quot;Cue&quot; itself came from<space/><italics>queue</italics>, the French word for a<space/><link><target>tail</target></link>.

The newly developed striking cue provided a new challenge. Cushions began to be stuffed with substances to allow the balls to rebound, in order to enhance the appeal of the game.

This is when the English began to experiment with side spin or applying curl to the ball.

Some brands of hand chalk actually are made of compressed talc. (Tip chalk is not used for this purpose because it is abrasive, hand-staining and difficult to apply.) Many players prefer a slick pool glove over hand chalk or talc because of the messiness of these powders; buildup of particles on the cloth will affect ball behavior and necessitate more-frequent cloth cleaning.</paragraph><paragraph>Cue tip chalk (invented in its modern form by straight rail billiard pro<space/><link><target>William A.
