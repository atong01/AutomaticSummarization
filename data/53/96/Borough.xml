The use of the word<space/><italics>borough</italics><space/>probably derives from the burghal system of<space/><link><target>Alfred the Great</target></link>. Alfred set up a system of defensive strong points (<link><target>Burh</target><trail>s</trail></link>); in order to maintain these settlements, he granted them a degree of autonomy. After the<space/><link><target>Norman Conquest</target></link>, when certain towns were granted self-governance, the concept of the burh/borough seems to have been reused to mean a self-governing settlement.</paragraph><paragraph>The concept of the borough has been used repeatedly (and often differently) throughout the world. Often, a borough is a single town with its own local government. However, in some cities it is a subdivision of the city (for example,<space/><link><target>New York City</target></link>,<space/><link><target>London</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Montreal</target></link>). In such cases, the borough will normally have either limited powers delegated to it by the city's local government, or no powers at all.

In<space/><link><target>Australia</target></link>, a<space/><italics>borough</italics><space/>was once a self-governing small town, but this designation has all but vanished, except for the only remaining borough in the country, which is the<space/><link><target>Borough of Queenscliffe</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Boroughs as administrative units are to be found in<space/><link><target>Republic of Ireland</target><part>Ireland</part></link><space/>and the United Kingdom, more specifically in England and<space/><link><target>Northern Ireland</target></link>.

The formal status of borough came to be conferred by<space/><link><target>Royal Charter</target></link>. These boroughs were generally governed by a self-selecting corporation (i.e., when a member died or resigned his replacement would be by<space/><link><target>co-option</target></link>). Sometimes boroughs were governed by<space/><link><target>bailiffs</target></link><space/>or headboroughs.</paragraph><paragraph>Debates on the Reform Bill (eventually the<space/><link><target>Reform Act 1832</target></link>) had highlighted the variations in systems of governance of towns, and a<space/><link><target>Royal Commission</target></link><space/>was set up to investigate the issue. This resulted in a regularisation of municipal government (<link><target>Municipal Corporations Act 1835</target></link>). 178 of the ancient boroughs were reformed as<space/><italics>municipal boroughs</italics>, with all municipal corporations to be elected according to a standard franchise based on property ownership. The unreformed boroughs either lapsed in borough status, or were reformed (or abolished) at a later time. Several new municipal boroughs were formed in the new industrial cities after the bill enacted, according to the provisions of the bill.</paragraph><paragraph>As part of a large-scale reform of local government in England and Wales<space/><link><target>Local Government Act 1972</target><part>in 1974</part></link>, municipal boroughs were finally abolished (having become increasingly irrelevant). However, the civic traditions of many boroughs were continued by the grant of a<space/><link><target>Royal Charter</target><part>charter</part></link><space/>to their successor district councils. In smaller boroughs, a<space/><link><target>Parish councils in England</target><part>town council</part></link><space/>was formed for the area of the abolished borough, while<space/><link><target>charter trustees</target></link><space/>were formed in other former boroughs. In each case, the new body was allowed to use the regalia of the old corporation, and appoint ceremonial office holders such as sword and mace bearers as provided in their original charters. The council or trustees may apply for an<space/><link><target>Order in Council</target></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>Royal Licence</target></link><space/>to use the former borough<space/><link><target>coat of arms</target></link>.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Parliamentary boroughs</heading><paragraph><template><target>Further</target><arg>Reform Act 1832</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>From 1265, two burgesses from each borough were summoned to the<space/><link><target>Parliament of England</target></link>, alongside two<space/><link><target>knights</target></link><space/>from each<space/><link><target>county</target></link>. Thus parliamentary constituencies were derived from the ancient boroughs. Representation in the<space/><link><target>United Kingdom House of Commons</target><part>House of Commons</part></link><space/>was decided by the House itself, which resulted in boroughs being established in some small settlements for the purposes of parliamentary representation, despite their possessing no actual corporation.</paragraph><paragraph>After the Reform Act, which disenfranchised many of the<space/><link><target>rotten borough</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>(boroughs that had declined in importance, had only a small population, and had only a handful of eligible voters), parliamentary constituencies began to diverge from the ancient boroughs.

These were designed to be 'counties-to-themselves'; administrative divisions to sit alongside the new administrative counties. They allowed urban areas to be administered separately from the more rural areas. They, therefore, often contained pre-existing municipal boroughs, which thereafter became part of the second tier of local government, below the administrative counties and county boroughs.</paragraph><paragraph>The county boroughs were, like the municipal boroughs, abolished in 1974, being reabsorbed into their parent counties for administrative purposes.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Metropolitan boroughs</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Metropolitan borough</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>In 1899, as part of a reform of local government in the<space/><link><target>County of London</target></link>, the various parishes in London were reorganised as new entities, the 'metropolitan boroughs'.

The metropolitan boroughs possessed slightly more autonomy from the metropolitan county councils than the shire county districts did from their county councils.</paragraph><paragraph>With the abolition of the metropolitan county councils in 1986, these metropolitan boroughs became independent, and continue to be so at present.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Other current uses</heading><paragraph>Elsewhere in England a number of<space/><link><target>districts of England</target><part>districts</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>unitary authority</target></link><space/>areas are called &quot;borough&quot;.

Since 1974, it has been a purely ceremonial style granted by royal charter to districts which may consist of a single town or may include a number of towns or rural areas.
