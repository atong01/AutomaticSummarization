The new president favored quick restoration of the<space/><link><target>Secession in the United States</target><part>seceded states</part></link><space/>to the Union. His plans did not give protection to the<space/><link><target>Freedmen#United States</target><part>former slaves</part></link>, and he came into conflict with the<space/><link><target>History of the United States Republican Party</target><part>Republican</part></link>-dominated Congress, culminating in<space/><link><target>Impeachment of Andrew Johnson</target><part>his impeachment</part></link><space/>by the House of Representatives. The first American president to be impeached, he was acquitted in the Senate by one vote.</paragraph><paragraph>Johnson was born in poverty in<space/><link><target>Raleigh, North Carolina</target></link>. Apprenticed as a tailor, he worked in several frontier towns before settling in<space/><link><target>Greeneville, Tennessee</target></link>. He served as alderman and mayor there before being elected to the<space/><link><target>Tennessee House of Representatives</target></link><space/>in 1835. After brief service in the<space/><link><target>Tennessee Senate</target></link>, Johnson was elected to the federal House of Representatives in 1843, where he served five two-year terms. He became<space/><link><target>Governor of Tennessee</target></link><space/>for four years, and was elected by the legislature to the Senate in 1857. In his congressional service, he sought passage of the<space/><link><target>Homestead Bill</target></link>, which was enacted soon after he left his Senate seat in 1862.</paragraph><paragraph>As<space/><link><target>Southern United States</target><part>Southern</part></link><space/><link><target>slave state</target><trail>s</trail></link>, including Tennessee, seceded to form the<space/><link><target>Confederate States of America</target></link>, Johnson remained firmly with the Union. In 1862, Lincoln appointed him as military governor of Tennessee after it had been retaken. In 1864, Johnson, as a<space/><link><target>War Democrat</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Southern Unionist</target></link>, was a logical choice as<space/><link><target>running mate</target></link><space/>for Lincoln, who wished to send a message of national unity in his re-election campaign; their ticket easily won. When Johnson was sworn in as vice president in March 1865, he gave a rambling speech. He later secluded himself to avoid public ridicule. Six weeks later, the assassination of Lincoln made him president.</paragraph><paragraph>Johnson implemented his own form of<space/><link><target>Presidential Reconstruction</target></link>&amp;nbsp; a series of proclamations directing the seceded states to hold conventions and elections to re-form their civil governments. When Southern states returned many of their old leaders, and passed<space/><link><target>Black Codes (United States)</target><part>Black Codes</part></link><space/>to deprive the freedmen of many civil liberties, Congress refused to seat legislators from those states and advanced legislation to overrule the Southern actions. Johnson vetoed their bills, and Congress overrode him, setting a pattern for the remainder of his presidency.<extension extension_name='ref'>Johnson saw 15 of his vetoes overridden by Congress,<space/><link><target>List of United States presidential vetoes</target><part>more than any other President, before or since</part></link>.</extension><space/>Johnson opposed the<space/><link><target>Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution</target><part>Fourteenth Amendment</part></link>, which gave citizenship to former slaves. As the conflict between the branches of government grew, Congress passed the<space/><link><target>Tenure of Office Act (1867)</target><part>Tenure of Office Act</part></link>, restricting Johnson's ability to fire Cabinet officials. When he persisted in trying to dismiss Secretary of War<space/><link><target>Edwin Stanton</target></link>, he was impeached by the House of Representatives, and narrowly avoided conviction in the Senate and removal from office. Returning to Tennessee after his presidency, Johnson sought political vindication, and gained it in his eyes when he was elected to the Senate again in 1875 (the only former president to serve there), just months before his death. Although Johnson's ranking has fluctuated over time, he is generally considered<space/><link><target>Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States</target><part>among the worst</part></link><space/>American presidents for his opposition to federally guaranteed rights for<space/><link><target>African Americans</target></link>.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Early life and career</heading><heading level='3'>Childhood</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Andrew Johnsons First Home 2006.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Johnson's boyhood home, located at the<space/><link><target>Mordecai House</target><part>Mordecai Historic Park</part></link><space/>in Raleigh, North Carolina</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>Andrew Johnson was born in<space/><link><target>Raleigh, North Carolina</target></link>, on December 29, 1808, to<space/><link><target>Jacob Johnson (father of Andrew Johnson)</target><part>Jacob Johnson</part></link><space/>(17781812) and Mary (&quot;Polly&quot;) McDonough (17831856), a laundress.

Her occupation was then looked down on, as it often took her into other homes unaccompanied. There were even rumors that Andrew, who did not resemble his brother or sister, had been fathered by another man. Polly Johnson eventually remarried, to Turner Doughtry, who was as poor as she was.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Gordon-Reed</arg><arg name="pp">18–22</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Johnson's mother apprenticed her son William to a tailor, James Selby.

Even before he became an apprentice, Johnson came to listen. The readings caused a lifelong love of learning, and one of his biographers,<space/><link><target>Annette Gordon-Reed</target></link>, suggests that Johnson, later a gifted public speaker, learned the art as he threaded needles and cut cloth.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Gordon-Reed</arg><arg name="p">26</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Andrew Johnson was not happy at James Selby's, and after about five years, both he and his brother ran away.

He found work quickly, met his first love, Mary Wood, and made her a quilt as a gift. However, she rejected his marriage proposal. He returned to Raleigh, hoping to buy out his apprenticeship, but could not come to terms with Selby. Unable to stay in Raleigh, where he risked being apprehended for abandoning Selby, he decided to move west.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Trefousse</arg><arg name="pp">23–26</arg></template><template><target>sfn</target><arg>Gordon-Reed</arg><arg name="pp">27–29</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='3'>Move to Tennessee</heading><paragraph>Johnson left North Carolina for Tennessee, traveling mostly on foot.

The convention also wanted to reform real estate tax rates, and provide ways of funding improvements to Tennessee's infrastructure. The constitution was submitted for a public vote, and Johnson spoke widely for its adoption; the successful campaign provided him with statewide exposure.

After<space/><link><target>Brookins Campbell</target></link><space/>and the Whigs defeated Johnson for re-election in 1837, Johnson would not lose another race for thirty years.

He sought a speedy restoration of the states, on the grounds that they had never truly left the Union, and thus should again be recognized once loyal citizens formed a government. To Johnson, African-American suffrage was a delay and a distraction; it had always been a state responsibility to decide who should vote. Second, political power in the Southern states should pass from the planter class to his beloved &quot;plebians&quot;. Johnson feared that the freedmen, many of whom were still economically bound to their former masters, might vote at their direction. Johnson's third priority was election in his own right in 1868, a feat no one who had succeeded a deceased president had managed to accomplish.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Castel</arg><arg name="pp">28–29</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>The Republicans had formed a number of factions.

They believed that the freedmen could be induced to vote Republican in gratitude for emancipation, and that black votes could keep the Republicans in power and Southern Democrats, including former rebels, out of influence. They believed that top Confederates should be punished. The Moderate Republicans sought to keep the Democrats out of power at a national level, and prevent former rebels from resuming power. They were not as enthusiastic about the idea of African-American suffrage as their Radical colleagues, either because of their own local political concerns, or because they believed that the freedman would be likely to cast his vote badly. Northern Democrats favored the unconditional restoration of the Southern states.

The Cabinet was divided on the issue.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Trefousse</arg><arg name="pp">215–216, 234–235</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Johnson's first Reconstruction actions were two proclamations, with the unanimous backing of his Cabinet, on May 29.

The President ordered constitutional conventions in other former rebel states.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Trefousse</arg><arg name="pp">216–217</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>As Southern states began the process of forming governments, Johnson's policies received considerable public support in the North, which he took as unconditional backing for quick reinstatement of the South. While he received such support from the white South, he underestimated the determination of Northerners to ensure that the war had not been fought for nothing. It was important, in Northern public opinion, that the South acknowledge its defeat, that slavery be ended, and that the lot of African-Americans be improved. Voting rights were less importantafter all, only a handful of Northern states (mostly in New England) gave African-American men the right to vote on the same basis as whites, and in late 1865, Connecticut, Wisconsin, and Minnesota voted down African-American suffrage proposals by large margins. Northern public opinion tolerated Johnson's inaction on black suffrage as an experiment, to be allowed if it quickened Southern acceptance of defeat. Instead, white Southerners felt emboldened. A number of Southern states passed<space/><link><target>Black Codes (United States)</target><part>Black Codes</part></link>, binding African-American laborers to farms on annual contracts they could not quit, and allowing law enforcement at whim to arrest them for vagrancy and rent out their labor. Most Southerners elected to Congress were former Confederates, with the most prominent being Georgia Senator-designate and former Confederate vice president<space/><link><target>Alexander Stephens</target></link>. Congress assembled in early December 1865; Johnson's conciliatory<space/><link><target>State of the Union</target><part>annual message</part></link><space/>to them was well received. Nevertheless, Congress refused to seat the Southern legislators and established a committee to recommend appropriate Reconstruction legislation.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Castel</arg><arg name="pp">50–59</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Northerners were outraged at the idea of unrepentant Confederate leaders, such as Stephens, rejoining the federal government at a time when emotional wounds from the war remained raw.

By late January 1866, he was convinced that winning a showdown with the Radical Republicans was necessary to his political plans both for the success of Reconstruction and for re-election in 1868. He would have preferred that the conflict arise over the legislative efforts to enfranchise African-Americans in the District of Columbia, a proposal that had been defeated overwhelmingly in an all-white referendum. A bill to accomplish this passed the House of Representatives, but to Johnson's disappointment, stalled in the Senate before he could veto it.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Castel</arg><arg name="pp">62–68</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Nast on Andrew Johnson.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part><link><target>Thomas Nast</target></link><space/>cartoon of Johnson disposing of the<space/><link><target>Freedmen's Bureau</target></link><space/>as African-Americans go flying</part></link>Illinois Senator<space/><link><target>Lyman Trumbull</target></link>, leader of the Moderate Republicans and Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was anxious to reach an understanding with the President. He ushered through Congress a bill extending the<space/><link><target>Freedmen's Bureau</target></link><space/>beyond its scheduled abolition in 1867, and the first Civil Rights Bill, to grant citizenship to the freedmen. Trumbull met several times with Johnson, and was convinced the President would sign the measures (Johnson rarely contradicted visitors, often fooling those who met with him into thinking he was in accord). In fact, the President opposed both bills as infringements on state sovereignty. Additionally, both of Trumbull's bills were unpopular among white Southerners, whom Johnson hoped to include in his new party. Johnson vetoed the Freedman's Bureau bill on February 18, 1866, to the delight of white Southerners and the puzzled anger of Republican legislators.

Written by Trumbull and others, it was sent for ratification by state legislatures in a process in which the president plays no part, though Johnson opposed it. The amendment was designed to put the key provisions of the Civil Rights Act into the Constitution, but also went further. The amendment extended citizenship to every person born in the United States (except Indians on reservations), penalized states that did not give the vote to freedmen, and most importantly, created new federal civil rights that could be protected by federal courts. It also guaranteed that the federal debt would be paid and forbade repayment of Confederate war debts.

Johnson campaigned vigorously, undertaking a public speaking tour, known as the &quot;<link><target>Swing Around the Circle</target></link>&quot;. The trip, including speeches in Chicago, St. Louis, Indianapolis and Columbus, proved politically disastrous, with the President making controversial comparisons between himself and Christ, and engaging in arguments with hecklers. These exchanges were attacked as beneath the dignity of the presidency.

The Fourteenth Amendment had been ratified by none of the Southern or<space/><link><target>Border states (American Civil War)</target><part>border states</part></link><space/>except Tennessee, and had been rejected in Kentucky, Delaware, and Maryland. As the amendment required ratification by three-quarters of the states to become part of the Constitution, he believed the deadlock would be broken in his favor, leading to his election in 1868. Once it reconvened in December 1866, an energized Congress began passing legislation, often over a presidential veto; this included the District of Columbia voting bill. Congress admitted Nebraska to the Union over a veto, and the Republicans gained two senators, and a state that promptly ratified the amendment. Johnson's veto of a bill for statehood for<space/><link><target>Colorado Territory</target></link><space/>was sustained; enough senators agreed that a district with a population of 30,000 was not yet worthy of statehood to win the day.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Castel</arg><arg name="pp">107–109</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>In January 1867, Congressman Stevens introduced legislation to dissolve the Southern state governments and reconstitute them into five military districts, under<space/><link><target>martial law</target></link>. The states would begin again by holding constitutional conventions. African-Americans could vote for or become delegates; former Confederates could not. In the legislative process, Congress added to the bill that restoration to the Union would follow the state's ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, and completion of the process of adding it to the Constitution. Johnson and the Southerners attempted a compromise, whereby the South would agree to a modified version of the amendment without the disqualification of former Confederates, and for limited black suffrage. The Republicans insisted on the full language of the amendment, and the deal fell through. Although Johnson could have pocket vetoed the<space/><link><target>Reconstruction Acts</target><part>First Reconstruction Act</part></link><space/>as it was presented to him less than ten days before the end of the Thirty-Ninth Congress, he chose to veto it directly on March 2, 1867; Congress overruled him the same day.

This committee duly met, examining the President's bank accounts, and summoning members of the Cabinet to testify. When a federal court released former Confederate president Davis on bail on May 13 (he had been captured shortly after the war), the committee investigated whether the President had impeded the prosecution. It learned that Johnson was eager to have Davis tried. A bipartisan majority of the committee voted down impeachment charges; the committee adjourned on June 3.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Castel</arg><arg name="pp">126–127</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Later in June, Johnson and Stanton battled over the question of whether the military officers placed in command of the South could override the civil authorities. The President had Attorney General<space/><link><target>Henry Stanbery</target></link><space/>issue an opinion backing his position that they could not. Johnson sought to pin down Stanton either as for, and thus endorsing Johnson's position, or against, showing himself to be opposed to his president and the rest of the Cabinet. Stanton evaded the point in meetings and written communications. When Congress reconvened in July, it passed a Reconstruction Act against Johnson's position, waited for his veto, overruled it, and went home. In addition to clarifying the powers of the generals, the legislation also deprived the President of control over the Army in the South. With Congress in recess until November, Johnson decided to fire Stanton and relieve one of the military commanders, General<space/><link><target>Philip Sheridan</target></link>, who had dismissed the governor of Texas and installed a replacement with little popular support.

Although Republicans expressed anger with his actions, the 1867 elections generally went Democratic.

Although the President preferred a more aggressive approach, Seward persuaded him to follow his lead.

By 1867, the Russian government saw its<space/><link><target>Russian America</target><part>North American colony</part></link><space/>(today Alaska) as a financial liability, and feared losing control as American settlement reached there. It instructed its minister in Washington, Baron<space/><link><target>Eduard de Stoeckl</target></link>, to negotiate a sale. De Stoeckl did so deftly, getting Seward to raise his offer from $5 million (coincidentally, the minimum that Russia had instructed de Stoeckl to accept) to $7 million, and then getting $200,000 added by raising various objections.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Castel</arg><arg name="p">120</arg></template><space/>This sum of $7.2 million is equivalent to $<template><target>formatprice</target><arg>{{inflation|US|7200000|1867}}</arg></template><space/>in present-day terms.<template><target>inflation-fn</target><arg>US</arg></template><space/>On March 30, 1867, de Stoeckl and Seward signed the treaty, working quickly as the Senate was about to adjourn.

He remained very popular among Southern whites, and boosted that popularity by issuing, just before the convention, a pardon ending the possibility of criminal proceedings against any Confederate not already indicted, meaning that only Davis and a few others still might face trial. On the first ballot, Johnson was second to former Ohio representative<space/><link><target>George H. Pendleton</target></link>, who had been his Democratic opponent for vice president in 1864. Johnson's support was mostly from the South, and fell away as the ballots passed.

Johnson sent Congress proposals for amendments to limit the president to a single six-year term and make the president and the Senate directly elected, and for term limits for judges. Congress took no action on them. When the President was slow to officially report ratifications of the Fourteenth Amendment by the new Southern legislatures, Congress passed a bill, again over his veto, requiring him to do so within ten days of receipt. He still delayed as much as he could, but was required, in July 1868, to report the ratifications making the amendment part of the Constitution.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Trefousse</arg><arg name="pp">340–343</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Andrew Johnson, Farewell to all my greatness cph.3a03724.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>&quot;Farewell to all my greatness&quot;: ''<link><target>Harper's Weekly</target></link>'' cartoon mocking Johnson on leaving office</part></link>Seymour's operatives sought Johnson's support, but he long remained silent on the presidential campaign. It was not until October, with the vote already having taken place in some states, that he mentioned Seymour at all, and he never endorsed him. Nevertheless, Johnson regretted Grant's victory, in part because of their animus from the Stanton affair. In his annual message to Congress in December, Johnson urged the repeal of the Tenure of Office Act and told legislators that had they admitted their Southern colleagues in 1865, all would have been well. He celebrated his 60th birthday in late December with a party for several hundred children, though not including those of<space/><link><target>President-elect of the United States</target><part>President-elect</part></link><space/>Grant, who did not allow his to go.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Trefousse</arg><arg name="pp">345–347</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>On Christmas Day 1868, Johnson issued a final amnesty, this one covering everyone, including Davis.

Few African-Americans outside the large towns were now able to vote as Reconstruction faded in Tennessee, setting a pattern that would be repeated in the other Southern states; the white domination would last almost a century. In the Tennessee legislative elections in August, the Democrats elected 92 legislators to the Republicans' eight, and Johnson went to Nashville for the legislative session. When the balloting for the Senate seat began on January 20, 1875, he led with 30 votes, but did not have the required majority as three former Confederate generals, one former colonel, and a former Democratic congressman split the vote with him. Johnson's opponents tried to agree on a single candidate who might gain majority support and defeat him, but failed, and he was elected on January 26 on the 54th ballot, with a margin of a single vote.

Many Republicans ignored Senator Johnson, though some, such as Ohio's<space/><link><target>John Sherman</target></link><space/>(who had voted for conviction), shook his hand. Johnson remains the only former president to serve in the Senate. He spoke only once in the short session, on March 22 lambasting President Grant for his use of federal troops in support of Louisiana's Reconstruction government. The former president asked, &quot;How far off is military despotism?&quot; and concluded his speech, &quot;may God bless this people and God save the Constitution.&quot;<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Castel</arg><arg name="pp">216–217</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Johnson returned home after the special session concluded.

President Grant had the &quot;painful duty&quot; of announcing the death of the only surviving past president. Northern newspapers, in their obituaries, tended to focus on Johnson's loyalty during the war, while Southern ones paid tribute to his actions as president.

These works had an effect; although historians continued to view Johnson as having deep flaws which sabotaged his presidency, they saw his Reconstruction policies as fundamentally correct.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Castel</arg><arg name="p">220</arg></template><space/>A series of highly favorable biographies in the late 1920s and early 1930s that &quot;glorified Johnson and condemned his enemies&quot; accelerated this trend.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Beale</arg><arg name="pp">807–808</arg></template><template><target>sfn</target><arg>Castel</arg><arg name="pp">220–221</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Beale wondered in 1940, &quot;is it not time that we studied the history of Reconstruction without first assuming, at least subconsciously, that carpetbaggers and Southern white Republicans were wicked, that Negroes were illiterate incompetents, and that the whole white South owes a debt of gratitude to the restorers of 'white supremacy'?&quot;<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Beale</arg><arg name="p">808</arg></template><space/>Despite these doubts, the favorable view of Johnson survived for a time.

They also accepted, for the most part, that reconciliation between North and South should have been the top priority of Reconstruction. In the 1950s, historians began to focus on the African-American as central to Reconstruction. They rejected completely any claim of black inferiority, which had marked many earlier historical works, and saw the developing<space/><link><target>Civil Rights Movement in the United States</target><part>Civil Rights Era</part></link><space/>as a second Reconstruction;<space/><link><target>Neoabolitionism</target><part>some writers stated</part></link><space/>they hoped their work on the postbellum era would advance the cause of civil rights. These authors sympathized with the Radical Republicans for their desire to help the African-American, and saw Johnson as callous towards the freedman. In a number of works from 1956 onwards by such historians as<space/><link><target>Fawn Brodie</target></link>, the former president was depicted as a successful saboteur of efforts to better the freedman's lot.
