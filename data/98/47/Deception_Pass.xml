In May 1792, Vancouver was anchored near the southern end of Whidbey Island. He sent Joseph Whidbey to explore the waters east of Whidbey Island, now known as<space/><link><target>Saratoga Passage</target></link>, using small boats. Whidbey reached the northern end of Saratoga Passage and explored eastward into Skagit Bay, which is shallow and difficult to navigate. He returned south to rejoin Vancouver without having found Deception Pass. It appeared that Skagit Bay was a dead-end and that Whidbey Island and Fidalgo Island were a long peninsula attached to the mainland. In June the expedition sailed north along the west coast of Whidbey Island. Vancouver sent Joseph Whidbey to explore inlets leading to the east. The first inlet turned out to be a &quot;very narrow and intricate channel, which...abounded with rocks above and beneath the surface of the water&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref' name="historylink"></extension><space/>This channel led to Skagit Bay, thus separating Whidbey Island from the mainland. Vancouver apparently felt he and Joseph Whidbey had been deceived by the tricky strait. Vancouver wrote of Whidbey's efforts: &quot;This determined [the shore they had been exploring] to be an island, which, in consequence of Mr. Whidbeys circumnavigation, I distinguished by the name of Whidbeys Island: and this northern pass, leading into [Skagit Bay], Deception Passage&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref' name="historylink"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage</arg><arg name="title"><space/>Joseph Whidbey circumnavigates Whidbey Island in June 1792<space/></arg><arg name="publisher"><space/>[[HistoryLink]]<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">11 July 2011</arg></template></extension><link><target>File:DeceptionPassPlaque2010809.jpg</target><part>right</part><part>thumb</part><part>200px</part><part>Plaque explaining the history of Deception Pass &quot;Deception Pass - Named By Captain George Vancouver 10 June 1792.

The island became infamous for its activity of smuggling illegal Chinese immigrants for local labor. Ure and his partner Lawrence &quot;Pirate&quot; Kelly were quite profitable at their smuggling business and played hide-and-seek with the United States Customs Department for years. Ure's own operation at Deception Pass in the late 1880s consisted of Ure and his Native-American wife. Local tradition has it that his wife would camp on the nearby<space/><link><target>Strawberry Island (Deception Pass, Washington)</target><part>Strawberry Island</part></link><space/>(which was visible from the open sea) and signal him with a fire on the island's summit to alert him to whether or not it was safe to bring his illegal cargo ashore. For transport, Ure would tie the illegal immigrants up in burlap bags so that if customs agents were to approach then he could easily toss the bags overboard. The tidal currents would carry the discarded immigrants' bodies to<space/><link><target>San Juan Island</target></link><space/>to the north and west of the pass and many ended up in what became known as Dead Man's Bay.<link><target>File:Deception Pass pano 02.jpg</target><part>left</part><part>thumb</part><part>600px</part><part>View looking south from Pass Island.

Nearby barracks housed some 40 prisoners, members of an honors program out of Walla Walla State Penitentiary and the prison population was made up of several types of prisoners, including those convicted of murder. Guards stood watch at the quarry as the prisoners cut the rock into gravel and loaded it onto barges located at the base of the cliff atop the pass's waters. The quarried rock was then taken by barge to the Seattle waterfront. The camp was dismantled in 1924 and although abandoned as a quarry, the remains of the camp can still be found. The location, however, is hazardous and over the years there have been several fatal accidents when visitors have ventured onto the steep cliffs.</paragraph><paragraph>Upon completion on July 31, 1935, the<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>976</arg><arg>ft</arg><arg>m</arg><arg name="adj">on</arg></template><space/>span<space/><link><target>Deception Pass Bridge</target></link><space/>connected Whidbey Island to the tiny Pass Island, and Pass Island to<space/><link><target>Fidalgo Island</target></link>.

This swift current phenomenon can be viewed from the twin bridges' pedestrian walkways or from the trail leading below the larger south bridge from the parking lot on the Whidbey Island side. Boats can be seen waiting on either side of the pass for the current to stop or change direction before going through. Thrill-seeking kayakers go there during large tide changes to surf the standing waves and brave the class 2 and 3 rapid conditions.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Scuba Diving</heading><paragraph>Diving Deception Pass is dangerous and only for the most competent and prepared divers. There are a few times each year that the tides are right for a drift dive from the cove, under the bridge, and back to the cove as the tide changes. These must be planned well in advance by divers who know how to read currents and are aware of the dangerous conditions. However, because of the large tidal exchange, Deception Pass hosts some of the most spectacular colors and life in the Pacific Northwest. The walls and bottom are covered in colorful invertebrates,<space/><link><target>lingcod</target></link>,<space/><link><target>greenling</target><trail>s</trail></link>, and barnacles everywhere.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Recreation</heading><paragraph><link><target>Image:Deception Pass 1.jpg</target><part>left</part><part>thumb</part><part>Tourist sign at Deception Pass State Park</part></link>Deception Pass is today surrounded by<space/><bold>Deception Pass State Park</bold>, the most-visited park in Washington with over 2 million visitors each year. The park was officially established in 1923, when the original<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>1600</arg><arg>acre</arg><arg>km2</arg></template><space/>of a military reserve was transferred to Washington State Parks. The park's facilities were greatly enhanced in the 1930s when the<space/><link><target>Civilian Conservation Corps</target></link><space/>(CCC) built roads, trails, and buildings in order to develop the park.</paragraph><paragraph>The road to West Beach was created in 1950, opening up a stretch of beach to hordes of vehicles. The former fish hatchery at Bowman Bay became a part of the park in the early 1970s. The old entrance to the park was closed in 1997 when a new entrance was created at the intersection of Highway 20 and Cornet Bay road, improving access into and out of the park.</paragraph><paragraph>Deception Pass State Park has a number of recreational opportunities, including three campgrounds, several hiking trails, beaches, and tidepools. Several miles of the<space/><link><target>Pacific Northwest Trail</target></link><space/>are within the park, most notably including the section that crosses Deception Pass on the Highway 20 bridge. In addition, the Cornet Bay Retreat Center provides cabins and dining and recreation facilities. Cornet Bay offers boat launches and fishing opportunities, while Bowman Bay has an interpretive center that explains the story of the<space/><link><target>Civilian Conservation Corps</target></link><space/>throughout Washington state. Near the center is a CCC honor statue, which can be found in 30 different states in the country. Fishing is popular in Pass Lake, on the north side of the bridge. Boat rentals and guided tours of the park are also offered.</paragraph><paragraph>Included in the park are ten islands: Northwest Island, Deception Island, Pass Island, Strawberry, Ben Ure, Kiket, Skagit, Hope, and Big and Little Deadman Islands. Ben Ure Island is partially privately owned. The island is not open to the public except for a small rentable cabin available via the state park, which is only accessible by rowboat.<template><target>clear</target></template><template><target>wide image</target><arg>Deception Pass pano 03.jpg</arg><arg>1200px</arg><arg>Looking roughly west from near the south span of the Deception Pass Bridge.
