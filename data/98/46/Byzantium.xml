On May 29, 1453, the city fell to the<space/><link><target>Ottoman Turks</target></link>, and again became the capital of a powerful state, the<space/><link><target>Ottoman Empire</target></link>. The Turks called the city &quot;Istanbul&quot; (although it was not officially renamed until 1930); the name derives from &quot;eis-tin-polin&quot; (Greek: &quot;to-the-city&quot;).

On a particularly dark and wet night Philip attempted a surprise attack but was thwarted by the appearance of a bright light in the sky.

In the course of this beleaguerment, it is related, on a certain wet and moonless night the enemy attempted a surprise, but were foiled by reason of a bright light which, appearing suddenly in the heavens, startled all the dogs in the town and thus roused the garrison to a sense of their danger.

Like Byzas in one legend, she had her origins in Thrace. Since Hecate was the guardian of &quot;liminal places,&quot; in Byzantium small temples in her honor were placed close to the gates of the city.<space/><link><target>Hecate</target></link>'s importance to Byzantium was above all as deity of protection. When Philip of Macedon was about to attack the city, according to the legend she alerted the townspeople with her ever-present torches, and with her pack of dogs, which served as her constant companions. Her mythic qualities thenceforth forever entered the fabric of Byzantine history.
