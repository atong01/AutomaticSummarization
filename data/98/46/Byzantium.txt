'''Byzantium''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ɪ|ˈ|z|æ|n|t|i|əm}} <!-- =needing not the original Latin/Greek pronunciation, but the **Anglicized** pronunciation that Classics/Philosophy/History/etc. scholars use in English -->; {{lang-el|Βυζάντιον}} ''Byzántion'') was an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] colony on the site that later became [[Constantinople]], and later still [[Istanbul]].  Byzantium was colonised by [[Greeks|Greek]] colonists from [[Megara]] in 657 BC.
==Name==
The etymology of ''Byzantion'' is unknown.  It has been suggested that the name is of [[Thracians|Thraco]]-[[Illyrians|Illyrian]] origin,<ref name="janin">{{cite book|title=Constantinople byzantine|last=Janin|first=Raymond |authorlink= Raymond Janin|place=Paris|publisher=Institut Français d'Études Byzantines|year=1964|page=10f.}}</ref> It may be derived from a Thracian or Illyrian personal name, ''[[Byzas]]''.<ref name=Georgacas1947>{{Cite journal |author=Georgacas, Demetrius John |year=1947 |title=The Names of Constantinople |journal=Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association |volume=78 |pages=347–67 |doi=10.2307/283503 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |jstor=283503 }}</ref>  Ancient Greek legend refers to a legendary king [[Byzas]], the leader of the Megarean colonists and founder of the city.<ref>{{cite book|last=Room|first=Adrian|title=Placenames of the World: Origins and Meanings of the Names for 6,600 Countries, Cities, Territories, Natural Features, and Historic Sites|year=2006|publisher=McFarland & Company|location=Jefferson, N.C.|edition=2nd|isbn=978-0-7864-2248-7|ref=harv}}</ref>  
The form ''Byzantium'' is a [[Latinisation (literature)|Latinization]] of the original name.  Much later, the name ''Byzantium'' became common in the West to refer to the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]], the ''"Byzantine" Empire'', whose capital Constantinople stood on the site of ancient Byzantium. This usage was introduced only in 1555 by the [[Germany|German]] historian [[Hieronymus Wolf]], a century after the empire had ceased to exist. During the time of the empire, the term Byzantium was restricted to just the city, rather than the empire that it ruled.

The European side (at [[Seraglio Point]]) featured only two fishing settlements: [[Lygos]] and [[Semistra]]. The origins of Byzantium are shrouded in legend. The traditional legend has it that [[Byzas]] from [[Megara]] (a city-state near [[Athens]]) founded Byzantium in 667 BC when he sailed northeast across the [[Aegean Sea]]. The tradition tells that Byzas, son of King [[Nisos]] (Νίσος), planned to found a colony of the [[Dorians|Dorian]] Greek city of [[Megara]]. Byzas consulted the [[Delphic oracle|oracle]] of [[Apollo]] at [[Delphi]], which instructed Byzas to settle opposite the "Land of the Blind".  Leading a group of Megarian colonists, Byzas found a location where the [[Golden Horn]], a great natural harbour, meets the [[Bosporus|Bosphorus]] and flows into the [[Sea of Marmara]], opposite [[Chalcedon]] (modern day [[Kadıköy]]). He adjudged the Chalcedonians blind not to have recognized the advantages the land on the [[Europe]]an side of the Bosphorus had over the Asiatic side. In 667 BC he founded Byzantium at their location, thus fulfilling the oracle's requirement. [[Cape Moda]] in [[Chalcedon]] was the first location which the [[Greeks|Greek]] settlers from [[Megara]] chose to colonize in 685 BC, prior to colonizing [[Byzantion]] on the European side of the Bosphorus under the command of King [[Byzas]] in 667 BC.

It was mainly a trading city due to its location at the [[Black Sea]]'s only entrance. Byzantium later conquered Chalcedon, across the Bosporus on the Asiatic side.

Byzantium was besieged by Greek forces during the Peloponnesian war. As part of Sparta's strategy for cutting off grain supplies to Athens, Sparta took the city in 411 BCE. The Athenian military later took the city in 408 BCE.<ref>"Egypt, Greece, and Rome: Civilizations of the Ancient Mediterranean," Oxford University Press, 2nd Edition, 2004, p. 302</ref> 

After siding with [[Pescennius Niger]] against the victorious [[Septimius Severus]], the city was besieged by Roman forces and suffered extensive damage in 196 AD.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=k1thG1smoSMC&pg=PA8 ''Daily Life in Ancient and Modern Istanbul'' Robert Bator, Chris Rothero p.8]</ref> Byzantium was rebuilt by Septimius Severus, now emperor, and quickly regained its previous prosperity. It was bound to [[Marmara Ereğlisi|Perinthos]] during the period of Septimius Severus. The location of Byzantium attracted [[Constantine I (emperor)|Roman Emperor Constantine I]] who, in 330 AD, refounded it as an imperial residence inspired by Rome itself. (See [[New Rome|Nova Roma]].) After his death the city was called [[Constantinople]] (Greek Κωνσταντινούπολις or Konstantinoupolis) ("city of Constantine").

This combination of imperialism and location would affect Constantinople's role as the nexus between the continents of [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]. It was a commercial, cultural, and diplomatic centre. With its strategic position, Constantinople controlled the route between Asia and Europe, as well as the passage from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the [[Black Sea]]. On May 29, 1453, the city fell to the [[Ottoman Turks]], and again became the capital of a powerful state, the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Turks called the city "Istanbul" (although it was not officially renamed until 1930); the name derives from "eis-tin-polin" (Greek: "to-the-city"). To this day it remains the largest and most populous city in Turkey (the successor to the Ottoman Empire), although [[Ankara]] is now the national capital.

===Emblem===
{{main|Star and crescent}}
Though associated with the Sassanid Persians and with [[Mithradates VI Eupator]] (who for a time incorporated the city into his empire),<ref>Andrew G. Traver, ''From Polis to Empire, The Ancient World, [[circa|ca.]] 800 B.C.-A.D. 500'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, p257</ref> by the late [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] or early Roman period, the star and crescent motif had been associated to some degree with Byzantium. For example, some Byzantine coins of the 1st century BC and later show the head of [[Artemis]] with bow and quiver, and feature a crescent with what appears to be a six-rayed star on the reverse. According to accounts which vary in some of the details, in 340 BC the Byzantines and their allies the [[Classical Athens|Athenians]] were under siege by the troops of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip of Macedon]]. On a particularly dark and wet night Philip attempted a surprise attack but was thwarted by the appearance of a bright light in the sky. This light is occasionally described by subsequent interpreters as a meteor, sometimes as the moon, and some accounts also mention the barking of dogs. However, the original accounts mention only a light in the sky, without specifying the moon.<ref>"In 340 BC, however, the Byzantines, with the aid of the Athenians, withstood a siege successfully, an occurrence the more remarkable as they were attacked by the greatest general of the age, Philip of Macedon. In the course of this beleaguerment, it is related, on a certain wet and moonless night the enemy attempted a surprise, but were foiled by reason of a bright light which, appearing suddenly in the heavens, startled all the dogs in the town and thus roused the garrison to a sense of their danger. To commemorate this timely phenomenon, which was attributed to [[Hecate]], they erected a public statue to that goddess [...]" William Gordon Holmes, ''The Age of Justinian and Theodora'', 2003 p5-6; "If any goddess had a connection with the walls in Constantinople, it was [[Hecate]]. [[Hecate]] had a cult in Byzantium from the time of its founding. Like Byzas in one legend, she had her origins in Thrace. Since Hecate was the guardian of "liminal places," in Byzantium small temples in her honor were placed close to the gates of the city. [[Hecate]]'s importance to Byzantium was above all as deity of protection. When Philip of Macedon was about to attack the city, according to the legend she alerted the townspeople with her ever-present torches, and with her pack of dogs, which served as her constant companions. Her mythic qualities thenceforth forever entered the fabric of Byzantine history. A statue known as the 'Lampadephoros' was erected on the hill above the Bosphorous to commemorate [[Hecate]]'s defensive aid." Vasiliki Limberis, ''Divine Heiress'', Routledge, 1994, p126-127</ref> To commemorate the event the Byzantines erected a statue of [[Hecate]] ''lampadephoros'' (light-bearer or bringer). This story survived in the works of [[Hesychius of Miletus]], who in all probability lived in the time of [[Justinian I]]. His works survive only in fragments preserved in [[Photius]] and the tenth century lexicographer [[Suda|Suidas]]. The tale is also related by [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], and [[Eustathius of Thessalonica|Eustathius]].

Devotion to [[Hecate]] was especially favored by the Byzantines for her aid in having protected them from the incursions of Philip of Macedon. Her symbols were the crescent and star, and the walls of her city were her provenance.<ref>Vasiliki Limberis, ''Divine Heiress'', Routledge, 1994, p15</ref>

It is unclear precisely how the symbol Hecate/Artemis, one of many goddesses<ref>"In 324 Byzantium had a number of operative cults to traditional gods and goddesses tied to its very foundation eight hundred years before. Rhea, called "the mother of the gods" by Zosimus, had a well-ensconced cult in Byzantium from its very foundation. [...] Devotion to [[Hecate]] was especially favored by the Byzantines [...] Constantine would also have found Artemis-Selene and Aphrodite along with the banished Apollo Zeuxippus on the Acropolis in the old Greek section of the city. Other gods mentioned in the sources are Athena, Hera, Zeus, Hermes, and Demeter and Kore. Even evidence of Isis and Serapis appears from the Roman era on coins during the reign of Caracalla and from inscriptions." Vasiliki Limberis, ''Divine Heiress'', Routledge, 1994, p16</ref> would have been transferred to the city itself, but it seems likely to have been an effect of being credited with the intervention against Philip and the subsequent honors.  This was a common process in ancient Greece, as in ''Athens'' where the city was named after ''Athena'' in honor of such an intervention in time of war.

Later, under the Romans, cities in the empire often continued to issue their own coinage. "Of the many themes that were used on local coinage, celestial and astral symbols often appeared, mostly stars or crescent moons."<ref>Michael R. Molnar, ''The Star of Bethlehem'', Rutgers University Press, 1999, p48</ref> The wide variety of these issues, and the varying explanations for the significance of the star and crescent on Roman coinage precludes their discussion here. It is, however, apparent that by the time of the Romans, coins featuring a star or crescent in some combination were not at all rare.
