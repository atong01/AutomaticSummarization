Karmal was born in<space/><link><target>Kamari</target></link><space/>and educated at<space/><link><target>Kabul University</target></link>. When the<space/><link><target>People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan</target></link><space/>(PDPA) was formed, Karmal became one of its leading members, having been introduced to<space/><link><target>Marxism</target></link><space/>by<space/><link><target>Mir Akbar Khyber</target></link><space/>during his imprisonment for activities deemed too radical by the government. He eventually became the leader of the<space/><link><target>Parcham</target></link><space/>faction. When the PDPA split in 1967, the Parcham-faction established a Parcham PDPA, while their ideological nemeses, the<space/><link><target>Khalq</target><trail>s</trail></link>, established a Khalqist PDPA. Under Karmal's leadership, the Parchamite PDPA participated in<space/><link><target>Mohammad Daoud Khan</target></link>'s rise to power, and his subsequent regime. While relations were good at the beginning, Daoud began a major purge of leftist influence in the mid-1970s. This in turn led to the reformation of the PDPA in 1977. The PDPA took power in the 1978<space/><link><target>Saur Revolution</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Karmal was appointed Deputy Chairman of the<space/><link><target>Revolutionary Council (Afghanistan)</target><part>Revolutionary Council</part></link>, synonymous with vice head of state, in the communist government. The Parchamite faction found itself under significant pressure by the Khalqists soon after taking power. In June 1978, a<space/><link><target>Central Committee of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan</target><part>PDPA Central Committee</part></link><space/>meeting voted in favor of giving the Khalqist faction exclusive control over PDPA policy. This decision was followed by a failed Parchamite coup, after which<space/><link><target>Hafizullah Amin</target></link>, a Khalqist, initiated a purge against the Parchamites. Karmal survived this purge but was exiled to<space/><link><target>Prague</target></link>. Karmal remained in exile until December 1979, when the<space/><link><target>Soviet war in Afghanistan</target><part>Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan</part></link><space/>(with the consent of the Afghan government) to stabilize the country.</paragraph><paragraph>Karmal was promoted to Chairman of the Revolutionary Council and<space/><link><target>Prime Minister of Afghanistan</target><part>Chairman</part></link><space/>of the<space/><link><target>Council of Ministers (Afghanistan)</target><part>Council of Ministers</part></link><space/>on 27 December 1979. He remained in office until 1981, when he was succeeded by<space/><link><target>Sultan Ali Keshtmand</target></link>. Throughout his term, Karmal worked to establish a support base for the PDPA by introducing several reforms. Among these were the<space/><link><target>Fundamental Principles of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan</target></link>, introducing a general amnesty for those people imprisoned during<space/><link><target>Nur Mohammad Taraki</target></link>'s and Amin's rule. He also replaced the Khalqist flag with a more traditional one. These policies failed to increase the PDPA's legitimacy in the eyes of the Afghan people.</paragraph><paragraph>These policy failures, and the stalemate that ensued after the Soviet intervention, led the Soviet leadership to become highly critical of Karmal's leadership. Under<space/><link><target>Mikhail Gorbachev</target></link>, the Soviet Union deposed Karmal and replaced him with<space/><link><target>Mohammad Najibullah</target></link>. Following his loss of power, he was again exiled, this time to<space/><link><target>Moscow</target></link>. He was allowed to return to Afghanistan in 1991 by the Najibullah government. Back in Afghanistan he became an associate of<space/><link><target>Abdul Rashid Dostum</target></link>, and helped remove the Najibullah government from power. Not long after, in 1996, Karmal died from<space/><link><target>liver cancer</target></link>.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Early life and career</heading><paragraph>Karmal was born Sultan Hussein#tag:ref on 6 January 1929,<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Arnold</arg><arg>1983</arg><arg name="p"><space/>[http://books.google.no/books?id</arg></template><space/>was the son of Muhammad Hussein Hashem, a<space/><link><target>Major General</target></link><template><target>sfn</target><arg>Clements</arg><arg>2003</arg><arg name="p">[http://books.google.no/books?id</arg></template><space/>in the<space/><link><target>Afghan National Army</target><part>Afghan Army</part></link><space/>and former governor of the province of Paktia, and was the second of five siblings.

The accusation that he was of Indian Muslim ancestry comes from the fact that his birthname, Sultan Hussein, is a common Indian Muslim name.

His government granted concessions to religious leaders and the restoration of confiscated property. Some property, which was confiscated during earlier land reforms, was also partially restored. All these measures, with the exception of the general amnesty of prisoners, were introduced gradually. Of 2,700 prisoners, 2,600 were released from prison; 600 of these were Parchamites. The general amnesty was greatly publicized by the government. While the event was hailed with enthusiasm by some, many others greeted the event with disdain, since their loved ones or associates had died during earlier purges. Amin had planned to introduce a general amnesty on 1 January 1980, to coincide with the PDPA's sixteenth anniversary.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>H. Kakar</arg><arg>M.

The Fundamental Principles envisaged a democratic state led by the PDPA, the only party then permitted by law. The Revolutionary Council, the organ of supreme power, would convene twice every year. The Revolutionary Council in turn elected a Presidium which would take decisions on behalf of the Revolutionary Council when it was not in session. The Presidium consisted mostly of<space/><link><target>Politburo of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan</target><part>PDPA Politburo</part></link><space/>members. The state would safeguard three kinds of property: state, cooperative and private property. The Fundamental Principles said that the state had the right to change the Afghan economy from an economy where man was exploited to an economy were man was free.

While it was Gorbachev who would dismiss Karmal, there may have been a consensus within the Soviet leadership in 1983 that Karmal should resign. Gorbachev's own plan was to replace Karmal with<space/><link><target>Mohammad Najibullah</target></link>, who had joined the PDPA at its creation.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Kalinovsky</arg><arg>2011</arg><arg name="p">[http://books.google.no/books?id</arg></template><space/>Najibullah was thought highly of by<space/><link><target>Yuri Andropov</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Boris Ponomarev</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Dmitriy Ustinov</target></link>, and negotiations for his succession may have started in 1983. Najibullah was not the Soviet leadership's only choice for Karmal's succession; a<space/><link><target>Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye</target><part>GRU</part></link><space/>report noted that the majority of the PDPA leadership would support<space/><link><target>Assadullah Sarwari</target></link>'s ascension to leadership. According to the GRU, Sarwari was a better candidate as he could balance between the Pashtuns, Tajiks and Uzbeks; Najibullah was a Pashtun nationalist.

Karmal asked to return home to Kabul, and said that he understood and would listen to the Soviet recommendations. Before leaving, Karmal promised he would step down as PDPA General Secretary. The Soviets did not trust him and sent<space/><link><target>Vladimir Kryuchkov</target></link>, the head of intelligence in the<space/><link><target>KGB</target></link>, into Afghanistan. At a meeting in Kabul, Karmal confessed his undying love for the Soviet Union, comparing his ardor to his Muslim faith. Kryuchkov, concluding that he could not persuade Karmal to resign, left the meeting. After Kryuchkov left the room, the Afghan defence minister and the state security minister visited Karmal's office, telling him that he had to resign from one of his posts. Understanding that his Soviet support had been eliminated, Karmal resigned from the office of the General Secretary at the 18th PDPA Central Committee plenum.
