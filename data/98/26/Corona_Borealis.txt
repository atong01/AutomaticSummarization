'''Corona Borealis''' {{IPAc-en|k|ɵ|ˈ|r|oʊ|n|ə|_|b|ɒr|i|ˈ|æ|l|ɨ|s}} is a small [[constellation]] in the [[Northern Celestial Hemisphere]]. It is one of the 48&nbsp;constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and remains one of the [[88 modern constellations]]. Its brightest [[star]]s form a semicircular arc. Its Latin name, inspired by its shape, means "northern crown".  In [[classical mythology]] Corona Borealis generally represented the crown given by the god [[Dionysus]] to the Cretan princess [[Ariadne]] and set by him in the heavens. Other cultures likened the pattern to a circle of elders, an eagle's nest, a bear's den, or even a smokehole. Ptolemy also listed a southern counterpart, [[Corona Australis]], with a similar pattern.

The brightest star is the [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]]&nbsp;2.2 [[Alpha Coronae Borealis]]. The yellow supergiant [[R Coronae Borealis]] is the prototype of a rare class of giant stars—the [[R Coronae Borealis variable]]s—that are extremely hydrogen deficient, and thought to result from the merger of two white dwarfs. [[T Coronae Borealis]], also known as the Blaze Star, is another unusual type of variable star known as a [[recurrent nova]]. Normally of magnitude&nbsp;10, it last flared up to magnitude&nbsp;2 in 1946. [[ADS 9731]] and [[Sigma Coronae Borealis]] are multiple star systems with six and five components respectively. Five star systems have been found to have [[Jupiter]]-sized [[exoplanet]]s. [[Abell 2065]] is a highly concentrated [[galaxy cluster]] one billion light-years from our Solar System containing more than 400 members, and is itself part of the larger [[Corona Borealis Supercluster]].

The seven stars that make up the constellation's distinctive crown-shaped pattern are all 4th-magnitude stars except for the brightest of them, [[Alpha Coronae Borealis]]. The other six stars are [[Theta Coronae Borealis|Theta]], [[Beta Coronae Borealis|Beta]], [[Gamma Coronae Borealis|Gamma]], [[Delta Coronae Borealis|Delta]], [[Epsilon Coronae Borealis|Epsilon]] and [[Iota Coronae Borealis]]. The German cartographer [[Johann Bayer]] gave twenty stars in Corona Borealis [[Bayer designation]]s from Alpha to Upsilon in his 1603 [[star atlas]] ''[[Uranometria]]''. Zeta Coronae Borealis was noted to be a double star by later astronomers and its components designated [[Zeta1 Coronae Borealis|Zeta<sup>1</sup>]] and [[Zeta2 Coronae Borealis|Zeta<sup>2</sup>]]. [[John Flamsteed]] did likewise with Nu Coronae Borealis; classed by Bayer as a single star, it was noted to be two close stars by Flamsteed. He named them 20 and 21 Coronae Borealis in [[Flamsteed designation|his catalogue]], alongside the designations [[Nu1 Coronae Borealis|Nu<sup>1</sup>]] and [[Nu2 Coronae Borealis|Nu<sup>2</sup>]] respectively.<ref name=wagman>{{cite book  | last = Wagman  | first = Morton  | year = 2003  | title = Lost Stars: Lost, Missing and Troublesome Stars from the Catalogues of Johannes Bayer, Nicholas Louis de Lacaille, John Flamsteed, and Sundry Others | publisher = The McDonald & Woodward Publishing Company | location = Blacksburg, Virginia | isbn = 978-0-939923-78-6 |pages=117–18}}</ref> Chinese astronomers deemed nine stars to make up the asterism, adding [[Pi Coronae Borealis|Pi]] and [[Rho Coronae Borealis]].<ref name=ridpathCB>{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/coronaborealis.htm#chinese | title=Corona Borealis |last1=Ridpath|first1=Ian|publisher=self-published  |work=Star Tales | accessdate= 24 November 2014}}</ref> Within the constellation's borders, there are 37 stars brighter than or equal to [[apparent magnitude]]&nbsp;6.5.{{efn|1=Objects of magnitude 6.5 are among the faintest visible to the unaided eye in suburban-rural transition night skies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/resources/darksky/3304011.html?page=1&c=y|title=The Bortle Dark-Sky Scale|last=Bortle|first=John E.|date=February 2001|work=[[Sky & Telescope]]|accessdate=29 November 2014}}</ref>}}<ref name=tirionconst/>

In [[Greek mythology]], Corona Borealis was linked to the legend of [[Theseus#The myth of Theseus and the Minotaur|Theseus and the minotaur]]. It was generally considered to represent a crown given by [[Dionysus]] to [[Ariadne]], the daughter of [[Minos]] of Crete, after she had been abandoned by the Athenian prince [[Theseus]]. When she wore the crown at her marriage to Dionysus, he placed it in the heavens to commemorate their wedding.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=126–128}} An alternate version has the besotted Dionysus give the crown to Ariadne, who in turn gives it to Theseus after he arrives in Crete to kill the [[minotaur]] that the Cretans have demanded tribute from Athens to feed. The hero uses the crown's light to escape the labyrinth after disposing of the creature, and Dionysus later sets it in the heavens.<ref name=wagman/> The Latin author [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]] linked it to a crown or wreath worn by Bacchus (Dionysus) to disguise his appearance when first approaching [[Mount Olympus]] and revealing himself to the gods, having been previously hidden as yet another child of Jupiter's trysts with a mortal, in this case [[Semele]].<ref name=wagman/>  In [[Welsh mythology]], it was called [[Caer Arianrhod]], "the Castle of the Silver Circle", and was the heavenly abode of the Lady [[Arianrhod]].<ref>{{cite book| last1 = Squire | first1 = Charles L. |pages=154–55  | year = 2000 | title = The Mythology of the British Islands | publisher = Wordsworth Editions Ltd  |location = Ware, United Kingdom | isbn = 978-1-84022-500-6}}</ref> Corona Borealis was one of the 48 constellations mentioned in the ''[[Almagest]]'' of classical astronomer [[Ptolemy]].<ref name=wagman/>
