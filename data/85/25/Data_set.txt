{{about||IBM mainframe term for a file|Data set (IBM mainframe)|the telecommunications interface device|Modem}}

A '''data set''' (or '''dataset''') is a collection of [[data]].

Most commonly a data set  corresponds to the contents of a single [[table (database)|database table]], or a single statistical [[data matrix (multivariate statistics)|data matrix]], where every [[column (database)|column]] of the table represents a particular variable, and each [[row (database)|row]] corresponds to a given member of the data set in question. The data set lists values for each of the variables, such as height and weight of an object, for each member of the data set.  Each value is known as a [[datum]]. The data set may comprise data for one or more members, corresponding to the number of rows. 

The term data set may also be used more loosely, to refer to the data in a collection of closely related tables, corresponding to a particular experiment or event. An example of this type is the data sets collected by space agencies performing experiments with instruments aboard [[space probe]]s.

==History==
Historically, the term originated in the [[mainframe computer|mainframe field]], where it had a [[Data set (IBM mainframe)|well-defined meaning]], very close to contemporary ''[[computer file]]''{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}.

==Properties==
Several characteristics define a data set's structure and properties.  These include the number and types of the attributes or variables, and various [[statistical measure]]s applicable to them, such as [[standard deviation]] and [[kurtosis]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uTzeRZFmaBgC&pg=PA100 |title=Principles of data mining and knowledge discovery |author=Jan M. Å»ytkow, Jan Rauch |postscript=<!--None--> |isbn=978-3-540-66490-1 |year=1999}}</ref>

The values may be numbers, such as [[real number]]s or [[integer]]s, for example representing a person's height in centimeters, but may also be [[nominal data]] (i.e., not consisting of [[Number|numerical]] values), for example representing a person's ethnicity. More generally, values may be of any of the kinds described as a [[level of measurement]]. For each variable, the values are normally all of the same kind. However, there may also be ''[[missing values]]'', which must be indicated in some way.

In [[statistics]], datasets usually come from actual observations obtained by [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] a [[statistical population]], and each row corresponds to the observations on one element of that population. Datasets may further be generated by [[algorithms]] for the purpose of testing certain kinds of [[software]].  Some modern statistical analysis software such as [[SPSS]] still present their data in the classical dataset fashion.  If data is missing or suspicious an [[imputation (statistics)|imputation]] method may be used to complete a data set.<ref name="sde">{{cite book |title=Statistical Data Editing: Impact on Data Quality: Volume 3 of Statistical Data Editing, Conference of European Statisticians Statistical standards and studies |author=United Nations Statistical Commission |author2=United Nations Economic Commission for Europe |year=2007 |publisher=United Nations Publications |isbn=9211169526 |page=20 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=X0wtLo2XY9gC |accessdate=19 July 2015}}</ref>

== Classic datasets ==
Several classic datasets have been used extensively in the [[statistical]] literature:
