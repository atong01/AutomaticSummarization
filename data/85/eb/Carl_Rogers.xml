It is the &quot;you&quot; that, if all goes well, you will become. On the other hand, to the extent that our society is out of sync with the actualizing tendency, and we are forced to live with conditions of worth that are out of step with organismic valuing, and receive only conditional positive regard and self-regard, we develop instead an &quot;ideal self&quot;. By ideal, Rogers is suggesting something not real, something that is always out of our reach, the standard we cannot meet. This gap between the real self and the ideal self, the &quot;I am&quot; and the &quot;I should&quot; is called<space/><italics>incongruity</italics>.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Psychopathology</heading><paragraph>Rogers described the concepts of<space/><italics>congruence</italics><space/>and<space/><italics>incongruence</italics><space/>as important ideas in his theory. In proposition #6, he refers to the actualizing tendency. At the same time, he recognized the need for<space/><italics>positive regard</italics>. In a fully congruent person realizing their potential is not at the expense of experiencing positive regard. They are able to lead lives that are authentic and genuine. Incongruent individuals, in their pursuit of positive regard, lead lives that include falseness and do not realize their potential. Conditions put on them by those around them make it necessary for them to forgo their genuine, authentic lives to meet with the approval of others. They live lives that are not true to themselves, to who they are on the inside out.</paragraph><paragraph>Rogers suggested that the incongruent individual, who is always on the defensive and cannot be open to all experiences, is not functioning ideally and may even be malfunctioning. They work hard at maintaining/protecting their self-concept. Because their lives are not authentic this is a difficult task and they are under constant threat. They deploy<space/><italics>defense mechanisms</italics><space/>to achieve this. He describes two mechanisms:<space/><italics>distortion</italics><space/>and<space/><italics>denial</italics>. Distortion occurs when the individual perceives a threat to their self-concept. They distort the perception until it fits their self-concept.</paragraph><paragraph>This defensive behavior reduces the consciousness of the threat but not the threat itself. And so, as the threats mount, the work of protecting the self-concept becomes more difficult and the individual becomes more defensive and rigid in their self structure. If the incongruence is immoderate this process may lead the individual to a state that would typically be described as neurotic. Their functioning becomes precarious and psychologically vulnerable. If the situation worsens it is possible that the defenses cease to function altogether and the individual becomes aware of the incongruence of their situation. Their personality becomes disorganised and bizarre; irrational behavior, associated with earlier denied aspects of self, may erupt uncontrollably.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Applications</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Person-centered therapy</arg><arg>Student-centered learning</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='3'>Person-centered therapy</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Person-centered therapy</arg></template>Rogers originally developed his theory to be the foundation for a system of therapy. He initially called this &quot;non-directive therapy&quot; but later replaced the term &quot;non-directive&quot; with the term &quot;client-centered&quot; and then later used the term &quot;person-centered&quot;. Even before the publication of<space/><italics>Client-Centered Therapy</italics><space/>in 1951, Rogers believed that the principles he was describing could be applied in a variety of contexts and not just in the therapy situation.

Each student will process what he or she learns differently depending on what he or she brings to the classroom.</listitem><listitem>A person learns significantly only those things that are perceived as being involved in the maintenance of or enhancement of the structure of self (Rogers, 1951). Therefore, relevancy to the student is essential for learning. The students' experiences become the core of the course.</listitem><listitem>Experience which, if assimilated, would involve a change in the organization of self, tends to be resisted through denial or distortion of symbolism (Rogers, 1951). If the content or presentation of a course is inconsistent with preconceived information, the student will learn if he or she is open to varying concepts. Being open to consider concepts that vary from one's own is vital to learning. Therefore, gently encouraging open-mindedness is helpful in engaging the student in learning. Also, it is important, for this reason, that new information be relevant and related to existing experience.</listitem><listitem>The structure and organization of self appears to become more rigid under threats and to relax its boundaries when completely free from threat (Rogers, 1951). If students believe that concepts are being forced upon them, they might become uncomfortable and fearful. A barrier is created by a tone of threat in the classroom. Therefore, an open, friendly environment in which trust is developed is essential in the classroom. Fear of retribution for not agreeing with a concept should be eliminated. A classroom tone of support helps to alleviate fears and encourages students to have the courage to explore concepts and beliefs that vary from those they bring to the classroom. Also, new information might threaten the students concept of him- or herself; therefore, the less vulnerable the student feels, the more likely he or she will be able to open up to the learning process.</listitem><listitem>The educational situation which most effectively promotes significant learning is one in which (a) threat to the self of the learner is reduced to a minimum and (b) differentiated perception of the field is facilitated (Rogers, 1951). The instructor should be open to learning from the students and also working to connect the students to the subject matter. Frequent interaction with the students will help achieve this goal. The instructor's acceptance of being a mentor who guides rather than the expert who tells is instrumental to student-centered, nonthreatening, and unforced learning.</listitem></list><heading level='3'>Rogerian rhetorical approach</heading><paragraph>In 1970, Richard Young,<space/><link><target>Alton L.
