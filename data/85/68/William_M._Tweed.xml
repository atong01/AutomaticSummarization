Green loosened the purse strings again, allowing city departments not under Tammany control to borrow money to operate. Green and Tilden had the city's records closely examined, and discovered money that went directly from city contractors into Tweed's pocket.

He shared control of the city with numerous less famous people, such as the villains depicted in the Nast's famous circle of guilt cartoon shown above. Seymour J. Mandelbaum has argued that, apart from the corruption he engaged in, Tweed was a modernizer who prefigured certain elements of the<space/><link><target>Progressive Era</target></link><space/>in terms of more efficient city management. Much of the money he siphoned off from the city treasury went to needy constituents who appreciated the free food at Christmas time and remembered it at the next election, and to precinct workers who provided the muscle of his machine. As a legislator he worked to expand and strengthen welfare programs, especially those by private charities, schools, and hospitals. With a base in the Irish Catholic community, he opposed efforts of Protestants to require the reading of the<space/><link><target>King James Bible</target></link><space/>in public schools, which was done deliberately to keep out Catholics. He facilitated the founding of the<space/><link><target>New York Public Library</target></link>, even though one of its founders, Samuel Tilden, was Tweed's sworn enemy in the Democratic Party.<extension extension_name='ref'>Mandelbaum, Seymour J.<space/><italics>Boss Tweed's New York</italics><space/>(1965)</extension><extension extension_name='ref'>Muccigrosso, Robert ed.,<space/><italics>Research Guide to American Historical Biography</italics><space/>(1988) 1538-42</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Tweed recognized that the support of his constituency was necessary for him to remain in power, and as a consequence he used the machinery of the city's government to provide numerous social services, including building more orphanages, almshouses and public baths.<extension extension_name='ref' name="encnyc"></extension><space/>Tweed also fought for the<space/><link><target>New York State Legislature</target></link><space/>to donate to private charities of all religious denominations, and subsidize<space/><link><target>Catholic schools</target></link><space/>and hospitals.
