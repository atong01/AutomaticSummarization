Fiscal adjustment measures included downsizing the civil service, implementing a pension reform that placed the system on a much stronger financial footing, and strengthening public expenditure institutions. From 2003 to 2005, annual real GDP growth averaged 3.1 percent driven by good performance in the services sector and strong consumption.<space/><link><target>Inflation</target></link><space/>has been kept low (only 1 percent in 2004, compared with 2.2 percent in 2003), due to the fixed peg of the<space/><link><target>Djiboutian franc</target><part>Djibouti franc</part></link><space/>to the<space/><link><target>US dollar</target></link>. However, as mentioned above, unemployment has remained high at over 40 percent in recent years.<template><target>cn</target><arg name="date">January 2015</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>The government fiscal balance is in deficit because the government has not been able to raise sufficient<space/><link><target>tax revenue</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>to cover expenses. In 2004, a substantial increase in expenditure resulted in a deterioration of the fiscal position. As a result, the government deficit increased to US$17 million in 2004 from US$7 million in 2003. But improvement in expenditure management brought down the fiscal deficit to US$11 million in 2005.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Country Watch"></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Balance of payments</heading><paragraph>Djiboutis merchandise trade balance has shown a large deficit. This is due to the country's enormous need for imports and narrow base of exports. Although Djibouti runs a substantial surplus in its services balance, the surplus has been smaller than the deficit in the merchandise trade balance. As a result, Djibouti's current account balance has been in deficit. There is very limited information for Djiboutis current account; the countrys merchandise trade deficit was estimated at US$737 million in 2004.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Country Watch"></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Regional situation</heading><paragraph>With its position on the Red Sea, Djibouti holds a major strategic importance. The facilities of the<space/><link><target>Port of Djibouti</target></link><space/>are important to sea transportation companies for fuel bunkering and refuelling. Its transport facilities are used by several landlocked African countries for the re-export of their goods. Djibouti earns transit taxes and harbour fees from this trade, these form the bulk of government revenue. This strategic location also has ensured a steady inflow of foreign assistance. The port of Djibouti functions as a small<space/><link><target>France</target><part>French</part></link><space/>naval facility, and the<space/><link><target>United States</target></link><space/>also has stationed hundreds of troops in Djibouti, its only African base, in an effort to counter terrorism in the region.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Country Watch"></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Macro-economic trend</heading><paragraph>This is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Djibouti at market prices estimated by the<space/><link><target>International Monetary Fund</target></link><space/>with figures in millions of Djiboutian francs.</paragraph><table class="wikitable"><tablerow><tablehead>Year</tablehead><tablecell>Gross Domestic Product</tablecell><tablecell>US Dollar Exchange</tablecell><tablecell>Inflation Index (2000=100)</tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell>1980</tablecell><tablecell>54,969</tablecell><tablecell>177.89 Djiboutian Francs</tablecell><tablecell>44</tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell>1985</tablecell><tablecell>64,988</tablecell><tablecell>177.56 Djiboutian Francs</tablecell><tablecell>49</tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell>1990</tablecell><tablecell>80,388</tablecell><tablecell>177.84 Djiboutian Francs</tablecell><tablecell>70</tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell>1995</tablecell><tablecell>88,456</tablecell><tablecell>177.62 Djiboutian Francs</tablecell><tablecell>90</tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell>2000</tablecell><tablecell>97,965</tablecell><tablecell>177.79 Djiboutian Francs</tablecell><tablecell>100</tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell>2005</tablecell><tablecell>124,770</tablecell><tablecell>177.73 Djiboutian Francs</tablecell><tablecell>111</tablecell></tablerow></table><paragraph>For purchasing power parity comparisons, the US dollar is exchanged at 76.03<space/><link><target>Djiboutian franc</target><trail>s</trail></link>.

Two-thirds of inhabitants live in the capital and the remainder of the populace is mostly nomadic herders. Low amounts of rainfall limit crop production to fruits and vegetables, and requiring most food to be imported. The government provides services as both a transit port for the region and an international transshipment and refuelling centre. Djibouti has few natural resources and little industry. All of these factors contribute to its heavy dependence on foreign assistance to help support its balance of payments and to finance development projects.<template><target>cn</target><arg name="date">January 2015</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>An unemployment rate of 50 percent continues to be a major problem. Inflation is not a concern, however, because of the fixed tie of the franc to the US dollar. Per capita consumption dropped an estimated 35 percent over the last seven years because of recession, civil war, and a high population growth rate. Faced with a multitude of economic difficulties, the government has fallen in arrears on long-term<space/><link><target>external debt</target></link><space/>and has been struggling to meet the stipulations of foreign aid donors.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Country Watch"><link type='external' href='http://www.countrywatch.com/cw_topic.aspx?type=text&amp;amp;vcountry=49&amp;amp;topic=INFIC'>Country Watch</link></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Openness to foreign investment</heading><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>Politics of Djibouti</target><part>government of Djibouti</part></link><space/>welcomes all foreign direct investment.

In principle there is no screening of investment or other discriminatory mechanisms. That said, certain sectors, most notably public utilities, are state owned and some parts are not currently open to investors. Conditions of the structural adjustment agreement recently signed by Djibouti and the<space/><link><target>International Monetary Fund</target></link><space/>stipulate increased privatization of<space/><link><target>parastatal</target></link><space/>and government-owned monopolies.

In Djibouti, the administrative process has been characterized as a form of 'circular dependency.' For example, the finance ministry will issue a license only if an investor possesses an approved investor visa, while the interior ministry will only issue an investor visa to a licensed business. The Djiboutian government is increasingly realizing the importance of establishing a one-stop shop to facilitate the investment process.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Country Watch"></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Trade</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Sabaibdjib.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>200px</part><part>A<space/><link><target>Islamic Bank</target><part>Saba Islamic Bank</part></link><space/>branch in Djibouti City.</part></link>Principal exports from the region transiting Djibouti are<space/><link><target>coffee</target></link>,<space/><link><target>salt</target></link>,<space/><link><target>hides</target></link>, dried<space/><link><target>beans</target></link>,<space/><link><target>cereals</target></link>, other agricultural products, chalk, and wax.
