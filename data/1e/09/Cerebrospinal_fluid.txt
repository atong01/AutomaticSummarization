'''Cerebrospinal fluid''' ('''CSF''') is a clear, colorless [[body fluid]] found in the [[human brain|brain]] and [[human vertebral column|spine]]. It is produced in the [[choroid plexus]]es of the [[ventricular system|ventricles]] of the brain. It acts as a cushion or buffer for the brain's [[cerebral cortex|cortex]], providing basic mechanical and [[immunological]] protection to the brain inside the [[Human skull|skull]]. The CSF also serves a vital function in [[cerebral autoregulation]] of [[cerebral blood flow]].

The CSF occupies the [[subarachnoid space]] (between the [[arachnoid mater]] and the [[pia mater]]) and the [[ventricular system]] around and inside the brain and [[spinal cord]]. It constitutes the content of the [[Ventricular system|ventricles]], [[Cistern (neuroanatomy)|cisterns]], and [[Sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulci]] of the brain, as well as the [[central canal]] of the [[spinal cord]].

==Structure==

===Production===
The brain produces roughly 500 mL of cerebrospinal fluid per day. This fluid is constantly reabsorbed, so that only 100-160 mL is present at any one time.

[[Ependymal cells]] of the [[choroid plexus]] produce more than two thirds of CSF. The [[choroid plexus]] is a [[venous plexus]] contained within the [[Ventricular system|four ventricles]] of the brain, hollow structures inside the brain filled with CSF. The remainder of the CSF is produced by the surfaces of the ventricles and by the lining surrounding the [[subarachnoid space]].<ref name=GUYTONHALL2005p764>{{cite book |first1=Arthur C. |last1=Guyton |first2=John Edward |last2=Hall |title=Textbook of medical physiology |year=2005 |publisher=W.B. Saunders |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0-7216-0240-0 |edition=11th |page=764}}</ref>

Ependymal cells actively secrete sodium into the lateral ventricles. This creates [[osmotic pressure]] and draws water into the CSF space. Chloride, with a negative charge, moves with the positively charged sodium and a neutral charge is maintained. As a result, CSF contains a higher concentration of sodium and chloride than blood plasma, but less potassium, calcium and glucose and protein.<ref name=GUYTONHALL2005p764/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Saladin |first1=Kenneth |title=Anatomy and Physiology |edition=6th |publisher=McGraw Hill |year=2012 |pages=519–20}}</ref>

===Circulation===
[[File:NPH MRI 272 GILD.gif|thumb|left|MRI showing pulsation of CSF]]

CSF circulates within the [[ventricular system]] of the brain. The ventricles are a series of cavities filled with CSF, inside the brain. The majority of CSF is produced from within the two [[lateral ventricles]]. From here, the CSF passes through the [[Interventricular foramina (neuroanatomy)|interventricular foramina]] to the [[third ventricle]], then the [[cerebral aqueduct]] to the [[fourth ventricle]]. The fourth ventricle is an outpouching on the posterior part of the [[brainstem]]. From the fourth ventricle, the fluid passes through three openings to enter the [[subarachnoid space]] – these are the [[median aperture]], and the [[lateral aperture]]s. The subarachnoid space covers the brain and spinal cord.<ref name=GUYTONHALL2005p764/>

The CSF moves in a pulsatile manner throughout the CSF system with a nearly zero net flow, as shown on an [[MRI]].

===Reabsorption===
It had been thought that CSF returns to the vascular system by entering the [[dural venous sinuses]] via the [[arachnoid granulation]]s (or villi). However, some<ref name="pmid14636163">{{cite journal |author=Zakharov A, Papaiconomou C, Djenic J, Midha R, Johnston M |title=Lymphatic CSF absorption pathways in neonatal sheep revealed by [[sub arachnoid]] injection of Microfil |journal=Neuropathol.

The flow of CSF to the nasal [[submucous plexus|submucosal]] [[Lymph|lymphatic channels]] through the [[cribriform plate]] seems to be especially important.<ref name="pmid15624320">{{cite journal |author=Johnston M |title=The importance of lymphatics in cerebrospinal fluid transport |journal=Lymphat.

Since the subarachnoid space around the brain and spinal cord can contain only 135 to 150 ml, large amounts are drained primarily into the blood through [[arachnoid granulations]] in the [[superior sagittal sinus]].

===Development===
Around the third week of [[human embryogenesis|development]], the [[embryo]] is a three-layered disc, covered on the [[dorsum (anatomy)#Human anatomy|dorsal]] surface by a layer of [[endoderm]]. In the middle of this surface is a linear structure called the [[notochord]]. As the endoderm proliferates, the notochord is dragged into the middle of the developing embryo and becomes the [[neural canal]].<ref name=LARSEN2009/>

As the [[Brain#Development|brain develops]], by the fourth week of embryological development three swellings have formed within the embryo around the canal, near where the head will develop. These swellings represent different components of the [[central nervous system]]: the [[prosencephalon]], [[mesencephalon]] and [[rhombencephalon]].<ref name=LARSEN2009/>

The developing forebrain surrounds the neural cord. As the forebrain develops, the neural cord within it becomes a ventricle, ultimately forming the [[lateral ventricles]]. Along the inner surface of both ventricles, the ventricular wall remains thin, and a [[choroid plexus]] develops, releasing CSF. The CSF quickly fills the neural canal.<ref name=LARSEN2009>{{cite book |first1=Gary C. |last1=Schoenwolf |first2=William James |last2=Larsen |title=Larsen's human embryology |year=2009 |publisher=Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0-443-06811-9 |chapter=Development of the Brain and Cranial Nerves |edition=4th}}{{page needed|date=July 2014}}</ref>

==Function==
[[Image:CSFposter1p.png|thumb|right|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at glance.]]
CSF serves several purposes:

#'''Buoyancy:''' The actual [[mass]] of the [[human brain]] is about 1400&nbsp;grams; however, the net [[weight]] of the brain suspended in the CSF is equivalent to a mass of 25&nbsp;grams.<ref>

|page= 93}}</ref> The brain therefore exists in [[neutral buoyancy]], which allows the brain to maintain its [[density]] without being impaired by its own weight, which would cut off blood supply and kill [[neuron]]s in the lower sections without CSF.<ref name="Saladin 2007 520" />
#'''Protection:''' CSF protects the brain tissue from injury when jolted or hit. In certain situations such as [[auto accidents]] or [[sports]] injuries, the CSF cannot protect the brain from forced contact with the [[Human skull|skull]] case, causing [[hemorrhaging]], [[brain damage]], and sometimes death.<ref name="Saladin 2007 520">{{cite book

|isbn= 978-0-07-287506-5
|page= 520}}</ref>
#'''Chemical stability:''' CSF flows throughout the inner [[ventricular system]] in the brain and is absorbed back into the bloodstream, rinsing the [[metabolic waste]] from the [[central nervous system]] through the [[blood–brain barrier]]. This allows for homeostatic regulation of the distribution of [[neuroendocrine]] factors, to which slight changes can cause problems or damage to the nervous system. For example, high [[glycine]] [[concentration]] disrupts [[temperature]] and [[blood pressure]] control, and high CSF [[pH]] causes [[dizziness]] and [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]].<ref name="Saladin 2007 520"/> To use Davson's term, the CSF has a "sink action" by which the various substances formed in the nervous tissue during its metabolic activity diffuse rapidly into the CSF and are thus removed into the bloodstream as CSF is absorbed.<ref>Allan H. Ropper, Robert H. Brown ''Adams and Victor's Principles of Neurology'' McGraw-Hill Professional; 8 edition  (March 29, 2005) Ch. 30 p. 530.</ref>
#'''Prevention of brain [[ischemia]]:''' The prevention of brain ischemia is made by decreasing the amount of CSF in the limited space inside the skull. This decreases total [[intracranial pressure]] and facilitates blood [[perfusion]].
#'''Clearing waste:''' CSF has been shown by the research group of [[Maiken Nedergaard]] to be critical in the brain's [[glymphatic system]], which plays an important role in flushing metabolic toxins or waste from the brain's tissues' cellular interstitial fluid (ISF).<ref name=Iliff>{{cite journal |author=Iliff JJ, Wang M, Liao Y |title=A paravascular pathway facilitates CSF flow through the brain parenchyma and the clearance of interstitial solutes, including amyloid β |journal=Science Translational Medicine |volume=4 |issue=147 |pages=147ra111 |date=August 2012  |pmid=22896675 |pmc=3551275 |doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3003748|display-authors=etal}}</ref> CSF flushing of wastes from brain tissue is further increased during sleep, which results from the opening of extracellular channels controlled through the contraction of [[glial cell]]s, which allows for the rapid influx of CSF into the brain.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Xie L, Kang H, Xu Q |title=Sleep drives metabolite clearance from the adult brain |journal=Science |volume=342 |issue=6156 |pages=373–7 |date=October 2013  |pmid=24136970 |doi=10.1126/science.1241224|display-authors=etal}}</ref> These findings indicate that CSF may play a large role during sleep in clearing metabolic waste, like [[beta amyloid]], that are produced by the activity in the awake brain.

==Clinical significance==
When CSF pressure is elevated, [[cerebral blood flow]] may be constricted. When disorders of CSF flow occur, they may therefore affect not only CSF movement but also craniospinal compliance and the intracranial blood flow, with subsequent neuronal and glial vulnerabilities.<ref name="ninds2005hydro">{{cite web | title=Hydrocephalus: Myths, New Facts, Clear Directions | date=2011-03-10 | publisher=[[NIH]] | work=National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke | url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/news_and_events/proceedings/Hydrocephalus_2005.htm | accessdate=2015-01-05}}</ref> The venous system is also important in this equation. Infants and patients shunted as small children may have particularly unexpected relationships between pressure and ventricular size, possibly due in part to venous pressure dynamics. This may have significant treatment implications, but the underlying pathophysiology needs to be further explored.

CSF connections with the [[lymphatic system]] have been demonstrated in several [[mammal]]ian systems. Preliminary data suggest that these CSF-lymph connections form around the time that the CSF secretory capacity of the [[choroid plexus]] is developing (in [[uterus|utero]]). There may be some relationship between CSF disorders, including [[hydrocephalus]] and impaired CSF lymphatic transport.<ref name="ninds2005hydro" />

[[Cerebrospinal fluid leak|CSF can leak]] from the [[dura mater|dura]] as a result of different causes such as physical trauma or a [[lumbar puncture]], or from no known cause when it is termed [[spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak]].  The leakage can cause a lack of CSF pressure and volume which can allow the brain to descend through the [[foramen magnum]] in the [[occipital bone]] where  the lower portion of the brain may impact on [[cranial nerve]] complexes causing a variety of sensory symptoms.

===Hydrocephalus===
[[Hydrocephalus]] can be caused by impaired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow, reabsorption, or excessive production of CSF. Hydrocephalus is colloquially termed as "water on the brain" and is of medical importance.  Hydrocephalus is an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricles, or cavities, of the brain, which may cause increased intracranial pressure (ICP) inside the skull. It may lead to enlargement of the cranium if hydrocephalus occurs during [[human embryogenesis|development]].  It is usually accompanied by mental disability, sometimes by convulsive episodes and also tunnel vision. Hydrocephalus may become fatal if it is not corrected quickly. It is more common in infants, and in older adults.<ref>"Hydrocephalus Fact Sheet", National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. (August 2005).</ref>

===Lumbar puncture===
[[Image:4 vials of human cerebrospinal fluid.jpg|thumb|Vials containing human cerebrospinal fluid.]]
{{Main|Lumbar puncture}}
CSF can be tested for the diagnosis of a variety of [[neurological disease]]s, usually obtained by a procedure called [[lumbar puncture]].<ref name="pmid14524396">{{cite journal |author=Seehusen DA, Reeves MM, Fomin DA |title=CSF analysis |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=68 |issue=6 |pages=1103–8 |date=September 2003 |pmid=14524396 |doi= |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20030915/1103.html}}</ref>

Lumbar puncture is carried out under sterile conditions by inserting a needle into the subarachnoid space, usually between the third and fourth [[lumbar vertebrae]]. CSF is extracted through the needle, and tested. Cells in the fluid are counted, as are the levels of protein and glucose. These parameters alone may be extremely beneficial in the diagnosis of [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]] and [[central nervous system]] infections (such as [[meningitis]]). Moreover, a CSF [[Microbiological culture|culture]] examination may yield the [[microorganism]] that has caused the infection. By using more sophisticated methods, such as the detection of the [[oligoclonal bands]], an ongoing inflammatory condition (for example, [[multiple sclerosis]]) can be recognized. A [[beta-2 transferrin]] assay is highly specific and sensitive for the detection of [[cerebrospinal fluid leak|CSF leakage]].<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010>{{cite book |editor1-first=Nicki R. |editor1-last=Colledge |editor2-first=Brian R. |editor2-last=Walker |editor3-first=Stuart H. |editor3-last=Ralston |title=Davidson's principles and practice of medicine |year=2010 |publisher=Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier |location=Edinburgh |isbn=978-0-7020-3084-0 |edition=21st |pages=1147–8}}</ref>

Lumbar puncture can also be performed to measure the [[intracranial pressure]], which might be increased in certain types of [[hydrocephalus]]. However a lumbar puncture should never be performed if increased intracranial pressure is suspected due to certain situations such as a tumour, because it can lead to [[brain herniation]] and ultimately death.<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 />

About one third of people experience a headache after lumbar puncture.<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 />

===Baricity===
This fluid has an importance in [[anesthesiology]].  [[Baricity]] refers to the density of a substance compared to the density of human cerebrospinal fluid. Baricity is used in [[anesthesia]] to determine the manner in which a particular drug will spread in the [[intrathecal]] space.

===Alzheimer's disease===
A 2010 study showed analysis of CSF for three protein [[biomarker (medicine)|biomarkers]] that can indicate the presence of [[Alzheimer's disease]]. The three biomarkers are CSF [[amyloid beta]] 1-42, total CSF [[tau protein]] and P-Tau<sub>181P</sub>. In the study, the biomarker test showed good [[specificity and sensitivity|sensitivity]], identifying 90% of persons with Alzheimer's disease, but poor [[specificity and sensitivity|specificity]], as 36% of control subjects were positive for the biomarkers. The researchers suggested the low specificity may be explained by developing but not yet symptomatic disease in controls.<ref>{{cite journal |author=De Meyer G, Shapiro F, Vanderstichele H |title=Diagnosis-independent Alzheimer disease biomarker signature in cognitively normal elderly people |journal=Archives of Neurology |volume=67 |issue=8 |pages=949–56 |date=August 2010  |pmid=20697045 |pmc=2963067 |doi=10.1001/archneurol.2010.179|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Herskovits AZ, Growdon JH |title=Sharpen that needle |journal=Archives of Neurology |volume=67 |issue=8 |pages=918–20 |date=August 2010  |pmid=20697041 |doi=10.1001/archneurol.2010.151}}</ref>

===CNS Tumors===
Wang et al in their article show the utility of tapping CSF to identify somatic mutations causing Central Nervous System (CNS) tumors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/112/31/9704.abstract|title=Detection of tumor-derived DNA in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with primary tumors of the brain and spinal cord|author=Yuxuan Wang|work=pnas.org}}</ref>

==History==
Various comments by ancient physicians have been read as referring to CSF. [[Hippocrates]] discussed "water" surrounding the brain when describing congenital [[hydrocephalus]], and [[Galen]] referred to "excremental liquid" in the ventricles of the brain, which he believed was purged into the nose.  But for some 16 intervening centuries of ongoing anatomical study, CSF remains unmentioned in the literature. This is perhaps because of the prevailing autopsy technique, which involved cutting off the head, thereby removing evidence of the CSF before the brain was examined.  The modern rediscovery of CSF is now credited to [[Emanuel Swedenborg]]. In a manuscript written between 1741 and 1744, unpublished in his lifetime, Swedenborg referred to CSF as "spirituous lymph" secreted from the roof of the fourth ventricle down to the medulla oblongata and spinal cord. This manuscript was eventually published in translation in 1887.<ref name=CSFhistory>{{cite journal |author=Hajdu SI |title=A note from history: discovery of the cerebrospinal fluid |journal=Annals of Clinical and Laboratory Science |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=334–6 |year=2003 |pmid=12956452 |url=http://www.annclinlabsci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12956452}}</ref>

[[Albrecht von Haller]], a Swiss physician and physiologist, made note in his 1747 book on physiology that the "water" in the brain was secreted into the ventricles and absorbed in the veins, and when secreted in excess, could lead to hydrocephalus.<ref name=CSFhistory/>

[[Francois Magendie]] studied the properties of CSF by vivisection. He discovered the foramen Magendie, the opening in the roof of the fourth ventricle, but mistakenly believed that CSF was secreted by the [[pia mater]].<ref name=CSFhistory/>

[[Thomas Willis]] (noted as the discoverer of the [[circle of Willis]]) made note of the fact that the consistency of the CSF is altered in meningitis.<ref name=CSFhistory/>

In 1891, [[W. Essex Wynter]] began treating tubercular meningitis by tapping the subarachnoid space, and [[Heinrich Quincke]] began to popularize lumbar puncture, which he advocated for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.<ref name=CSFhistory/> In 19th and early 20th century literature, particularly German medical literature, ''liquor cerebrospinalis'' was a term used to refer to CSF.

In 1912, [[William Mestrezat]] gave the first accurate description of the chemical composition of the CSF. In 1914, [[Harvey W. Cushing]] published conclusive evidence that the CSF is secreted by the [[choroid plexus]].<ref name=CSFhistory/>
