</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph><bold>CITES</bold><space/>(the<space/><bold>Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora</bold>, also known as the<space/><bold>Washington Convention</bold>) is a<space/><link><target>multilateral treaty</target></link><space/>to protect endangered plants and animals. It was drafted as a result of a resolution adopted in 1963 at a meeting of members of the<space/><link><target>International Union for Conservation of Nature</target></link><space/>(IUCN). The convention was opened for signature in 1973. and CITES entered into force on 1 July 1975. Its aim is to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten the survival of the species in the wild, and it accords varying degrees of protection to more than 35,000<space/><link><target>species</target></link><space/>of animals and plants. In order to ensure that the<space/><link><target>General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade</target></link><space/>(GATT) was not violated, the Secretariat of GATT was consulted during the drafting process.<extension extension_name='ref' name="what_is_cites"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url"><space/>http://www.cites.org/eng/disc/what.php<space/></arg><arg name="title">What is CITES?</arg><arg name="work">cites.org</arg><arg name="publisher">CITES</arg><arg name="accessdate">13 February 2012</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The current Secretary-General of the CITES Secretariat is<space/><link><target>John E.

The Secretariat, when informed of an infraction by a Party, will notify all other parties.

The REIO can vote at CITES meetings with the number of votes representing the number of members in the REIO, but it does not have an additional vote.</paragraph><paragraph>In accordance with Article XVII, paragraph 3, of the CITES Convention, the Gaborone Amendment entered into force on 29 November 2013, 60 days after 54 (two-thirds) of the 80 States that were party to CITES on 30 April 1983 deposited their instrument of acceptance of the amendment. At that time it entered into force only for those States that had accepted the amendment. The amended text of the Convention will apply automatically to any State that becomes a Party after 29 November 2013. For States that became party to the Convention before that date and have not accepted the amendment, it will enter into force 60 days after they accept it.<extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.cites.org/eng/disc/gaborone.php</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Although the Gaborone Amendment entered into force in November 2013, no regional economic integration organization (REIO) has yet applied to be a Party to CITES, although it is expected that the<space/><link><target>European Union</target></link><space/>will probably do so before the next Conference of the Parties, which will be held in 2016.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Regulation of trade</heading><paragraph>CITES works by subjecting international trade in specimens of selected species to certain controls. All import, export, re-export and introduction from the sea of species covered by the Convention has to be authorized through a licensing system. Each Party to the Convention must designate one or more Management Authorities in charge of administering that licensing system and one or more Scientific Authorities to advise them on the effects of trade on the status of the species.</paragraph><paragraph>In accordance with Article IX of the Convention, Management and Scientific Authorities, each Party to the Convention must designate one or more Management Authorities competent to grant permits or certificates on behalf of that Party, and one or more Scientific Authorities to provide advice that international trade in any CITES-listed species will not be detrimental to the survival of that species.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Appendices</heading><paragraph>Roughly 5,000 species of animals and 29,000 species of plants are protected by CITES against<space/><link><target>over-exploitation</target></link><space/>through international trade.

The Appendix that lists a species or population reflects the extent of the threat to it and the controls that apply to the trade.</paragraph><paragraph>Species may be split-listed meaning that some populations of a species are on one Appendix, while some are on another. Some people argue that this is risky as specimens from a more protected population could be laundered through the borders of a Party whose population is not as strictly protected. The<space/><link><target>African bush elephant</target></link><space/>(<italics>Loxodonta africana</italics>) is currently split-listed, with all populations except those of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe listed in Appendix I. Those of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe are listed in Appendix II. Listing the species over the whole of its range would prevent such laundering but also restricts trade in wildlife products by<space/><link><target>range states</target></link><space/>with good management practices. There are also species that have only some populations listed in an Appendix. One example is the<space/><link><target>pronghorn</target></link><space/>(<italics>Antilocapra americana</italics>), a ruminant native to North America. Its Mexican population is listed in Appendix I, but its U.S. and Canadian populations are not listed (though certain U.S. populations in Arizona are nonetheless protected under the<space/><link><target>Endangered Species Act</target></link>).</paragraph><paragraph>Species are proposed for inclusion in or deletion from the Appendices at meetings of the Conference of the Parties (CoP), which are held approximately once every three years, the most recent of which was CoP (CoP 16) in<space/><link><target>Bangkok, Thailand</target></link><space/>from 315 March 2013.<extension extension_name='ref' name="CITES-Calendar"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.cites.org/eng/news/calendar.php<space/></arg><arg name="title">CITES Calendar<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">CITES</arg><arg name="work">cites.org<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">13 February 2012</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Species in the Appendices may be proposed for addition, change of Appendix, or de-listing (i.e., deletion) by any Party, whether or not it is a range State and changes may be made despite objections by range States if there is sufficient (2/3 majority) support for the listing. These discussions are usually among the most contentious at CoP meetings.</paragraph><paragraph>There has been increasing willingness within the Parties to allow for trade in products from well-managed populations. For instance, sales of the South African white rhino have generated revenues that helped pay for protection. Listing the species on Appendix I increased the price of rhino horn (which fueled more poaching), but the species survived wherever there was adequate on-the-ground protection. Thus field protection may be the primary mechanism that saved the population, but it is likely that field protection would not have been increased without CITES protection.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Hutton">Hutton and Dickinson, Endangered Species Threatened Convention: The Past, Present and Future of CITES. London: Africa Resources Trust, 2000.</extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Appendix I</heading><paragraph>Appendix I, about 1200 species, are species that are threatened with extinction and are or may be affected by trade. Commercial trade in wild-caught specimens of these species is illegal (permitted only in exceptional licensed circumstances). Captive-bred animals or cultivated plants of Appendix I species are considered Appendix II specimens, with concomitant requirements (see below and Article VII). The Scientific Authority of the exporting country must make a non-detriment finding, assuring that export of the individuals will not adversely affect the wild population. Any trade in these species requires export and import permits. The Management Authority of the exporting state is expected to check that an import permit has been secured and that the importing state is able to care for the specimen adequately.

Then and only then, trade is regulated or constrained. Because the remit of the Convention covers millions of species of plants and animals, and tens of thousands of these taxa are potentially of economic value, in practice this negative list approach effectively forces CITES signatories to expend limited resources on just a select few, leaving many species to be traded with neither constraint nor review. For example, recently several bird classified as<space/><link><target>IUCN Red List</target><part>threatened with extinction</part></link><space/>appeared in the legal wild bird trade because the CITES process never considered their status. If a &quot;positive list&quot; approach were taken, only species evaluated and approved for the positive list would be permitted in trade, thus lightening the review burden for member states and the Secretariat, and also preventing inadvertent legal trade threats to poorly known species.</paragraph><paragraph>Specific weaknesses in the text include: it does not stipulate guidelines for the 'non-detriment' finding required of national Scientific Authorities; non-detriment findings require copious amounts of information; the 'household effects' clause is often not rigid enough/specific enough to prevent CITES violations by means of this Article (VII); non-reporting from Parties means Secretariat monitoring is incomplete; and it has no capacity to address domestic trade in listed species.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Reform suggestions</heading><paragraph>Suggestions for improvement in the operation of CITES include: more regular missions by the Secretariat (not reserved just for high-profile species); improvement of national legislation and enforcement; better reporting by Parties (and the consolidation of information from all sources-NGOs,<space/><link><target>TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network</target></link><space/>and Parties); more emphasis on enforcement-including a technical committee enforcement officer; the development of CITES Action Plans (akin to Biodiversity Action Plans related to the<space/><link><target>Convention on Biological Diversity</target></link>) including: designation of Scientific/Management Authorities and national enforcement strategies; incentives for reporting and timelines for both Action Plans and reporting. CITES would benefit from access to<space/><link><target>Global Environment Facility</target></link><space/>(GEF) funds-although this is difficult given the GEFs more ecosystem approach-or other more regular funds.
