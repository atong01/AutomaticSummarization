'''Genetically modified maize''' ([[maize|corn]]) is a [[genetically modified crop]]. Specific maize strains have been [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] to express agriculturally-desirable [[Phenotypic trait|traits]], including resistance to pests and to herbicides. Maize strains with both traits are now in use in multiple countries. GM maize has also caused controversy with respect to possible health effects, impact on other insects and impact on other plants via [[gene flow]]. One strain, called Starlink, was approved only for animal feed in the US, but was found in food, leading to a [[Starlink corn recalls|series of recalls starting in 2000]].

The Bt protein is expressed throughout the plant. When a vulnerable insect eats the Bt-containing plant, the protein is activated in its [[gut (anatomy)|gut]], which is [[alkaline]]. In the alkaline environment the protein partially unfolds and is cut by other proteins, forming a [[toxin]] that paralyzes the insect's digestive system and forms holes in the gut wall. The insect stops eating within a few hours and eventually starves.<ref name=ColoSt>W.S. Cranshaw, Colorado State University Extension Office. Last updated March 26, 2013.

== Refuges ==
US [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) regulations require farmers who plant Bt corn to plant non-Bt corn nearby (called a "refuge") to provide a location to harbor vulnerable [[Maize#Pests|pests]].<ref name=Witowski>{{cite report |author=J.F. Witkowski|coauthors=J.L. Wedberg, K.L. Steffey, P.E.|date=2002|title=Bt Corn & European Corn Borer: Long-Term Success Through Resistance Management|url=http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/cropsystems/dc7055.html#ch11|publisher=University of Minnesota|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Typically, 20% of corn in a grower's fields must be refuge; refuge must be at least 0.5 miles from Bt corn for [[lepidopteran]] pests, and refuge for [[corn rootworm]] must at least be adjacent to a Bt field.<ref name=Cullen>{{cite report |author=E. Cullen|coauthors=R. Proost, D. Volenberg|date=2008|title=Insect resistance management and refuge requirements for Bt corn|url=http://corn.agronomy.wisc.edu/Management/pdfs/A3857.pdf}}</ref>

The theory behind these refuges is to slow the evolution of resistance to the pesticide. EPA regulations also require seed companies to train farmers how to maintain refuges, to collect data on the refuges and to report that data to the EPA.<ref name=Witowski/> A study of these reports found that from 2003 to 2005 farmer compliance with keeping refuges was above 90%, but that by 2008 approximately 25% of Bt corn farmers did not keep refuges properly, raising concerns that resistance would develop.<ref name=Witowski/>

Unmodified crops received most of the economic benefits of Bt corn in the US in 1996-2007, because of the overall reduction of pest populations. This reduction came because females laid eggs on modified and unmodified strains alike.<ref name=sci1009/>

Seed bags containing both Bt and refuge seed have been approved by the EPA in the United States. These seed mixtures were marketed as "Refuge in A Bag" (RIB) to increase farmer compliance with refuge requirements and reduce additional work needed at planting from having separate Bt and refuge seed bags on hand. The EPA approved a lower percentage of refuge seed in these seed mixtures ranging from 5 to 10%. This strategy is likely to reduce the likelihood of Bt-resistance occurring for [[corn rootworm]], but may increase the risk of resistance for [[lepidopteran]] pests, such as [[European corn borer]]. Increased concerns for resistance with seed mixtures include partially resistant larvae on a Bt plant being able to move to a susceptible plant to survive or cross pollination of refuge pollen on to Bt plants that can lower the amount of Bt expressed in kernels for ear feeding insects.<ref name="Siegfried">{{cite journal |last=Siegfried|first=B.D.|title= Understanding successful resistance management |journal= GM Crops & Food |volume= 3 |issue= 3 |pages= 184–193 |year= 2012 |url= http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1060&context=ent_pubs |doi=10.4161/gmcr.20715|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref name="Devos">{{cite journal |last= Devos|first=Y.|title= Resistance evolution to the first generation of genetically modified Diabrotica-active Bt-maize events by western corn rootworm: management and monitoring considerations |journal= Transgenic Research |volume= 22  |pages= 269–299 |year= 2013 |url= http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2247&context=usdaarsfacpub |doi=10.1007/s11248-012-9657-4|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

=== Effects on nontarget insects ===
Critics claim that Bt proteins could target predatory and other beneficial or harmless insects as well as the targeted pest. These proteins have been used as organic sprays for insect control in France since 1938 and the USA since 1958 with no ill effects on the environment reported.<ref name=UC-history>{{cite web |url= http://www.bt.ucsd.edu/bt_history.html |title=History of Bt |work= |publisher= University of California|accessdate=8 February 2010}}</ref> While ''cyt'' proteins are toxic towards the insect orders [[Coleoptera]] (beetles) and [[Diptera]] (flies), ''cry'' proteins selectively target [[Lepidopterans]] (moths and butterflies). As a toxic mechanism, ''cry'' proteins bind to specific receptors on the membranes of mid-gut ([[epithelial]]) cells, resulting in rupture of those cells. Any organism that lacks the appropriate gut receptors cannot be affected by the ''cry'' protein, and therefore Bt.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bt corn: is it worth the risk?|url=http://www.scq.ubc.ca/bt-corn-is-it-worth-the-risk/|last1=Hall|first1=H.|publisher=The Science Creative Quarterly}}</ref><ref>Dorsch, J.A. et al.

=== Gene flow ===
[[Gene flow]] is the transfer of genes and/or alleles from one species to another. Concerns focus on the interaction between GM and other maize varieties in Mexico, and of gene flow into refuges.

In 2009 the government of Mexico created a regulatory pathway for genetically modified maize,<ref>GMO Compass. 5 June 2009 [http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/news/447.mexico_controlled_cultivation_genetically_modified_maize.html Mexico: controlled cultivation of genetically modified maize]</ref> but because Mexico is the [[center of diversity]] for maize, gene flow could affect a large fraction of the world's maize strains.<ref>Mike Shanahan for Science and Development Network, 10 November 2004.

StarLink contains Cry9C, which had not previously been used in a GM crop.<ref name=ColStateExt-Starlink>Department of Soil and Crop Sciences at Colorado State University, Page last updated March 11, 2004 [http://cls.casa.colostate.edu/transgeniccrops/hotstarlink.html StarLink Corn]</ref> Starlink's creator, [[Plant Genetic Systems]] had applied to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to market Starlink for use in animal feed and in human food.<ref name=Pew>Michael R.

A subsequent review of these tests by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act Scientific Advisory Panel points out that while "the negative results decrease the probability that the Cry9C protein is the cause of allergic symptoms in the individuals examined ... in the absence of a positive control and questions regarding the sensitivity and specificity of the assay, it is not possible to assign a negative predictive value to this."<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/scipoly/SAP/meetings/2001/july/julyfinal.pdf FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel Report No. 2001-09, July 2001]</ref>
