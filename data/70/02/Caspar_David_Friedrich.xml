According to Rosenblum, &quot;Rothko, like Friedrich and Turner, places us on the threshold of those shapeless infinities discussed by the aestheticians of the Sublime. The tiny monk in the Friedrich and the fisher in the Turner establish a poignant contrast between the infinite vastness of a pantheistic God and the infinite smallness of His creatures. In the abstract language of Rothko, such literal detaila bridge of empathy between the real spectator and the presentation of a transcendental landscapeis no longer necessary; we ourselves are the monk before the sea, standing silently and contemplatively before these huge and soundless pictures as if we were looking at a sunset or a moonlit night.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="Rosenblum">Rosenblum, Robert. &quot;The Abstract Sublime&quot;.
