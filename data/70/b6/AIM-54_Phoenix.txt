The '''AIM-54 Phoenix''' is a radar-guided, long-range [[air-to-air missile]] (AAM), carried in clusters of up to six missiles on the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat]], its only launch platform. The Phoenix was the United States' only long-range air-to-air missile. The combination of Phoenix missile and the [[AN/AWG-9]] guidance radar was the first aerial weapons system that could simultaneously engage multiple targets. Both the missile and the aircraft were used by the [[United States Navy]] and are now retired, the AIM-54 Phoenix in 2004 and the F-14 in 2006. They were replaced by the shorter-range [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]], employed on the [[F/A-18 Hornet]] and [[F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]]. Following the retirement of the F-14 by the U.S. Navy, the weapon's only current operator is the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force]]. [[Multiservice tactical brevity code#F|Brevity code]] "Fox Three" was used when firing the AIM-54.

==Development==
===Background===
Since 1951, the Navy faced the initial threat from the [[Tupolev Tu-4|Tupolev Tu-4K 'Bull']] carrying<ref name="google">{{cite book|title=V-1 Flying Bomb, 1942-52: Hitler's Infamous "Doodlebug"|author1=Zaloga, S.J.|author2=Laurier, J.|date=2005|publisher=Osprey Publishing, Limited |isbn=9781841767918 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kGyc0NZEe_QC|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref> [[anti-ship missile]]s. Eventually, during the height of the Cold War, the threat would have actually expanded into regimental-size raids of [[Tu-16 Badger]] and [[Tu-22M Backfire]] bombers equipped with low-flying, long-range, high-speed, nuclear-armed cruise missiles and considerable [[Electronic Counter Measures]] (ECM) of various types.

The Navy would require a long-range, long-endurance [[interceptor aircraft]] to defend [[carrier battle group]]s against this threat. The proposed [[F6D Missileer]] was intended to fulfill this mission and oppose the attack far from the fleet it was defending. The weapon needed for interceptor aircraft, the Bendix [[AAM-N-10 Eagle]], was to be an air-to-air missile of unprecedented range when compared to contemporary [[AIM-7 Sparrow]] missiles. It would work together with [[Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems|Westinghouse]] [[AN/APQ-81]] radar.  However, the Missileer project was cancelled in December 1960.

===AIM-54===
[[File:AIM-54A first test A-3A NAN11-66.jpg|thumb|left|An AIM-54A launched from the [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|NA-3A]]-testbed in 1966]]

In the early 1960s the U.S. Navy made the next interceptor attempt with the [[General Dynamics/Grumman F-111B|F-111B]], and they needed a new missile design.  At the same time, the [[USAF]] canceled the projects for their land-based high-speed interceptor aircraft, the [[North American XF-108 Rapier]] and the [[Lockheed YF-12]], and left the capable [[AIM-47 Falcon]] missile at a quite advanced stage of development, but with no effective launch platform.

The AIM-54 Phoenix, developed for the F-111B fleet air defense fighter, had an airframe with four cruciform fins that was a scaled-up version of the AIM-47.  One characteristic of the Missileer ancestry was that the radar sent it [[mid-course correction]]s, which allowed the fire control system to "loft" the missile up over the target into thinner air where it had better range.

The F-111B was canceled in 1968. Its weapons system, the AIM-54 working with the [[AWG-9 radar]], migrated to the new U.S. Navy fighter project, the VFX, which would later become the [[F-14|F-14 Tomcat]].

In 1977, development of a significantly improved Phoenix version, the AIM-54C, was developed to better counter projected threats from tactical anti-naval aircraft and cruise missiles, and its final upgrade included a re-programmable memory capability to keep pace with emerging ECM.<ref name="designation-systems">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-54.html|title=Raytheon AIM-54 Phoenix|publisher=designation-systems.net|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>

==Usage in comparison to other weapon systems==
The AIM-54/AWG-9 combination had multiple track capability (up to 24 targets) and launch (up to 6 Phoenixes can be launched nearly simultaneously); the large {{convert|1000|lb|kg|-2|abbr=on}} missile is equipped with a conventional warhead.

On the F-14, four missiles can be carried under the fuselage tunnel attached to special aerodynamic pallets, plus two under glove stations. A full load of 6 Phoenix missiles and the unique launch rails weigh in at over {{convert|8000|lb|kg|-2|abbr=on}}, about twice the weight of Sparrows, so it was more common to carry a mixed load of 4 Phoenix, 2 Sparrow, and 2 Sidewinder missiles.

Most other US aircraft relied on the smaller, [[Semi-active radar homing|semi-active]] medium range [[AIM-7 Sparrow]]. Semi-active guidance meant the aircraft no longer had a search capability while supporting the launched Sparrow, reducing situational awareness.

The Tomcat's radar could track up to 24 targets in [[track-while-scan]] mode, with the AWG-9 selecting up to 6 potential targets for the missiles. The pilot or [[radar intercept officer]] (RIO) could then launch the Phoenix missiles once launch parameters were met. The large tactical information display (TID) in the RIO's cockpit gave information to the aircrew (the pilot had the ability to monitor the RIO's display) and the radar could continually search and track multiple targets after Phoenix missiles were launched, thereby maintaining [[situational awareness]] of the battlespace.

The Link-4 datalink allowed US Navy Tomcats to share information with the [[E-2 Hawkeye|E-2C Hawkeye]] [[airborne early warning|AEW]] aircraft, and during [[Operation Desert Shield (Gulf War)|Desert Shield]] in 1990, the Link-4A was introduced and allowed the Tomcats to have a fighter-to-fighter datalink capability, further enhancing overall situational awareness. The F-14D entered service with the JTIDS that brought the even better Link-16 datalink "picture" to the cockpit.

===Active guidance===
[[File:F-14A VF-1 launching AIM-54 Phoenix.JPEG|thumb|AIM-54 Phoenix seconds after launch (1991)]]
The Phoenix has several guidance modes and achieves its longest range by using mid-course updates from the F-14A/B AWG-9 radar (APG-71 radar in the F-14D) as it climbs to cruise between {{convert|80000|ft|m|-3|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100000|ft|m|-4|abbr=on}} at close to Mach 5. Phoenix uses this high altitude to gain gravitational potential energy, which is later converted into kinetic energy as the missile dives at high velocity towards its target. At around {{convert|11|mi|km}} from the target, the missile activates its own radar to provide terminal guidance.<ref name="Directory">[http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-54.html "AIM-54"]. (2004) Directory of US Military Rockets and Missiles. Retrieved 28 November 2010.</ref> Minimum engagement range for the Phoenix is around {{convert|2|nmi|km|abbr=on}} and active homing would initiate upon launch.<ref name="Directory"/>

The AIM-54 Phoenix was retired from USN service on September 30, 2004. F-14 Tomcats were retired on September 22, 2006. They were replaced by shorter-range [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]]s, employed on the [[F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]]. Both the F-14 Tomcat and AIM-54 Phoenix missile continue in the service of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force]], although the operational abilities of these aircraft and the missiles are questionable, since the US refused to supply spare parts and maintenance after the 1979 revolution, except for a brief period during the [[Iran-Contra Affair]].

Despite the much-vaunted capabilities, the Phoenix was rarely used in combat, with only two confirmed launches and no confirmed targets destroyed in US Navy service, though a large number of [[Iranian aerial victories during the Iran-Iraq war|kills]] were claimed by Iranian F-14s during the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. The USAF [[F-15 Eagle]] had responsibility for overland [[combat air patrol]] duties in Operation [[Desert Storm]] in 1991, primarily because of the onboard F-15 [[identification friend or foe|IFF]] capabilities. The Tomcat did not have the requisite IFF capability mandated by the [[JFACC]] to satisfy the rules of engagement to utilize the Phoenix capability at [[beyond visual range]]. The AIM-54 was not adopted by any foreign nation besides [[Iran]], or any other US armed service, and was not used on any aircraft other than the F-14.

===Iranian combat experience===


There is very little information available regarding Iran's use of its 79 F-14A Tomcats (delivered prior to 1979) in most [[Western world|western]] outlets; the exception being a book released by [[Osprey Publishing]] titled ''"Iranian F-14 Tomcats in Combat"'' by Tom Cooper and Farzad Bishop.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_452.shtml | title =Book: Iranian F-14 Tomcat Units in Combat| publisher = Acig |accessdate= 3 February 2010| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20100130102218/http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_452.shtml| archivedate = 30 January 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref> Most of the research contained in the book was based on pilot interviews.  Reports vary on the use of the 285 missiles supplied to Iran,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/planes/q0077.shtml |title=Iranian Air Force F-14 | publisher=Aerospace Web|accessdate= 3 February 2010}}</ref> during the [[Iran–Iraq War]], 1980–88. 

According to Cooper, the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force was able to keep its F-14 fighters and AIM-54 missiles in regular use during the entire Iran–Iraq War, though periodic lack of spares grounded large parts of the fleet at times. At worst, during late 1987, the stock of AIM-54 missiles was at its lowest, with less than 50 operational missiles available. The missiles needed fresh [[thermal batteries]] that could only be purchased from the US. Iran found a clandestine buyer that supplied it with batteries—though those did cost up to US$10,000 each. Iran did receive spares and parts for both the F-14s and AIM-54s from various sources during the Iran–Iraq War, and has received more spares after the conflict. Iran started a heavy industrial program to build spares for the planes and missiles, and although there are claims that it no longer relies on outside sources to keep its F-14s and AIM-54s operational, there is evidence that Iran continues to procure parts clandestinely.<ref>{{cite web | last = Theimer| first = Sharon | title = Iran Gets Army Gear in Pentagon Sale | url = http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/01/16/ap3334088.html | publisher = Forbes | accessdate = 17 January 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070119084031/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/01/16/ap3334088.html | archivedate = 19 January 2007}}</ref>

==Variants==
[[File:Phoenix missile at Grumman Memorial Park.jpg|thumb|An AIM-54A "Phoenix" missile on display at [[Grumman Memorial Park]] in New York State.]]

;AIM-54A: Original model that became operational with the [[U.S. Navy]] in about 1974, and it was also exported to [[Iran]] in modest numbers before the [[Iran hostage crisis]] beginning in 1979.
;AIM-54B: Also known as the 'Dry' missile. A version with simplified construction and no coolant conditioning. Did not enter series production. Developmental work started in January 1972. 7 X-AIM-54B missiles were created for testing, 6 of them by modifying pilot production IVE/PIP rounds. After two successful test firings, the 'Dry' missile effort was cancelled for being "not cost effective".<ref name= DeptNav_FY83>{{Citation | publisher = Department of the Navy | title = Supporting data for fiscal year 1983 | contribution = Budget estimates descriptive summaries}}.</ref>
;AIM-54C: The only improved model that was ever produced. It used [[digital electronics]] in the place of the analog electronics of the AIM-54A. This model had better abilities to shoot down low and high-altitude [[antiship missile]]s. This model took over from the AIM-54A beginning in 1986.
;AIM-54 ECCM/[[Sealed round]]:  more capabilities in [[electronic counter-countermeasures]]. It did not require coolant conditioning during flights on board F-14s and not fired (the usual situation). Deployed beginning in 1988. Because the AIM-54 ECCM/Sealed received no coolant, F-14s carrying this version of the missile could not exceed a specified airspeed.

There were also test, evaluation, ground training, and captive air training versions of the missile; designated ATM-54, AEM-54, DATM-54A, and CATM-54. The flight versions had A and C versions. The DATM-54 was not made in a C version as there was no change in the ground handling characteristics.

;Sea Phoenix: A 1970s proposal for a ship launched version of the Phoenix as an alternative/replacement for the [[RIM-7 Sea Sparrow|Sea Sparrow]] point defense system. It would also have provided a medium range SAM capability for smaller and/or non-Aegis equipped vessels (such as the [[Aircraft Carrier (Medium)|CVV]]). The Sea Phoenix system would have included a modified shipborne version of the [[AN/AWG-9]] radar. Hughes Aircraft touted the fact that 27 out of 29 major elements of the standard (airborne) AN/AWG-9 could be used in the shipborne version with little modification. Each system would have consisted of one AWG-9 radar, with associated controls and displays, and a fixed 12-cell launcher for the Phoenix missiles. In the case of an aircraft carrier, for example, at least three systems would have been fitted in order to give overlapping coverage throughout the full 360°.<ref name=JanesWS76>{{Citation | publisher = Jane's | title = Weapon Systems | year = 1977}}.</ref>{{Page needed | date = January 2014}}  Both land and ship based tests of modified Phoenix (''AIM-54A'') missiles and a containerised AWG-9 (originally the 14th example off the AN/AWG-9 production line) were successfully carried out from 1974 onwards.<ref name =Tarpgaard>{{Citation | first = PT | last = Tarpgaard | title = The Sea Phoenix—A Warship Design Study | journal = ASNE | volume = 88 | number = 2 | pages = 31–44 | year = 1976}}.</ref> 
;AIM-54B:  A land based version for the [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] was also proposed. It has been suggested that the ''AIM-54B'' would have been used in operational Sea Phoenix systems, although that version had been cancelled by the second half of the 1970s. Ultimately, a mix of budgetary and political issues meant that, despite being technically and operationally attractive, further development of the Sea Phoenix did not proceed.
