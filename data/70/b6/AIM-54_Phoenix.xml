At worst, during late 1987, the stock of AIM-54 missiles was at its lowest, with less than 50 operational missiles available. The missiles needed fresh<space/><link><target>thermal batteries</target></link><space/>that could only be purchased from the US. Iran found a clandestine buyer that supplied it with batteriesthough those did cost up to US$10,000 each. Iran did receive spares and parts for both the F-14s and AIM-54s from various sources during the IranIraq War, and has received more spares after the conflict. Iran started a heavy industrial program to build spares for the planes and missiles, and although there are claims that it no longer relies on outside sources to keep its F-14s and AIM-54s operational, there is evidence that Iran continues to procure parts clandestinely.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="last"><space/>Theimer</arg><arg name="first"><space/>Sharon<space/></arg><arg name="title"><space/>Iran Gets Army Gear in Pentagon Sale<space/></arg><arg name="url"><space/>http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/01/16/ap3334088.html<space/></arg><arg name="publisher"><space/>Forbes<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate"><space/>17 January 2007<space/></arg><arg name="archiveurl"><space/>http://web.archive.org/web/20070119084031/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/01/16/ap3334088.html<space/></arg><arg name="archivedate"><space/>19 January 2007</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Iran claims to be working on building an equivalent missile.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>citation</target><arg name="publisher"><space/>Press TV<space/></arg><arg name="place"><space/>IR<space/></arg><arg name="url"><space/>http://www.presstv.ir/detail/142412.html<space/></arg><arg name="title"><space/>Iran eyes missile stronger than Phoenix</arg></template>.</extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Variants</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Phoenix missile at Grumman Memorial Park.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>An AIM-54A &quot;Phoenix&quot; missile on display at<space/><link><target>Grumman Memorial Park</target></link><space/>in New York State.</part></link></paragraph><list type='def'><listitem><defkey>AIM-54A</defkey><defval><space/>Original model that became operational with the<space/><link><target>U.S. Navy</target></link><space/>in about 1974, and it was also exported to<space/><link><target>Iran</target></link><space/>in modest numbers before the<space/><link><target>Iran hostage crisis</target></link><space/>beginning in 1979.</defval></listitem><listitem><defkey>AIM-54B</defkey><defval><space/>Also known as the 'Dry' missile.
