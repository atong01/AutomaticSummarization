'''Alexander Grothendieck''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɡroːtn̩diːk|lang}}; {{IPA-fr|ɡʁɔtɛndik|lang}}; 28 March 1928&nbsp;– 13 November 2014) was a German-born French [[mathematician]] who became the leading figure in the creation of modern [[algebraic geometry]].<ref name="jackson2">{{citation |last=Jackson |first=Allyn |author-link= |author2-link= |title=Comme Appelé du Néant — As If Summoned from the Void: The Life of Alexandre Grothendieck II |journal=Notices of the American Mathematical Society |volume=51 |issue=10 |year=2004 |url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200410/fea-grothendieck-part2.pdf |format=PDF |doi=}}</ref><ref name="nytob">{{cite news |title=Alexander Grothendieck, Math Enigma, Dies at 86 |date=November 14, 2014 |author1=Bruce Weber |author2=Julie Rehmeyer |publisher=The New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/16/world/europe/alexander-grothendieck-math-enigma-dies-at-86.html}}</ref> His research extended the scope of the field and added elements of [[commutative algebra]], [[homological algebra]], [[sheaf theory]] and [[category theory]] to its foundations, while his so-called [[Grothendieck's relative point of view|"relative" perspective]] led to revolutionary advances in many areas of [[pure mathematics]].<ref name="jackson2"/><ref name="MumfordTate2015">{{cite journal|last1=Mumford|first1=David|last2=Tate|first2=John|authorlink2=John Tate|title=Alexander Grothendieck (1928–2014) Mathematician who rebuilt algebraic geometry|journal=Nature|volume=517|issue=7534|year=2015|pages=272–272|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/517272a|authorlink1=David Mumford}}</ref>

Born in [[Germany]], Grothendieck was raised and lived primarily in [[France]]. For much of his working life, however, he was, in effect, [[Statelessness|stateless]].{{sfn|Cartier|2004|loc=p. 10, footnote 12}} As he consistently spelled his first name "Alexander" rather than "Alexandre"{{sfn|Cartier|2004|loc=p. 9}} and his surname, taken from his mother, was the [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-like [[Low German]] "Grothendieck," he was sometimes mistakenly believed to be of Dutch origin.{{sfn|Cartier|2001|loc=p. 391, footnote 3}}

Grothendieck began his very productive and public career as a mathematician in 1949. In 1958, he was appointed a research professor at the [[Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques|Institut des hautes études scientifiques]] (IHÉS) and remained there until 1970, when, driven by personal and political convictions, he left following a dispute over military funding. Although he later became a professor at the [[University of Montpellier]]<!--(see "Politics and retreat from scientific community" section below, ¶1)-->{{sfn|Scharlau|2008}} and produced some private mathematical work, he otherwise withdrew from the mathematical community and devoted himself to political causes. Soon after his formal retirement in 1988, he moved to the [[Pyrenees]], where he lived in isolation until his death in 2014.{{sfn|Ruelle|2007|p=40}}

== Life ==

===Family and childhood===
Grothendieck was born in [[Berlin]] to [[Anarchism|anarchist]] parents. His father, [[Sascha Schapiro|Alexander "Sascha" Schapiro]] (also known as Alexander Tanaroff), had [[Hassidic]] roots and had been imprisoned in Russia before moving to Germany in 1922, while his mother, Johanna "Hanka" Grothendieck, came from a [[Protestant]] family in [[Hamburg]] and worked as a journalist. Both had broken away from their early backgrounds in their teens.<ref name="siam.org">[http://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=1405 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]</ref> At the time of his birth, Grothendieck's mother was married to the journalist Johannes Raddatz and his birthname was initially recorded as "Alexander Raddatz." The marriage was dissolved in 1929 and Schapiro/Tanaroff acknowledged his paternity, but never married Hanka.<ref name="siam.org"/>

Grothendieck lived with his parents in Berlin until the end of 1933, when his father moved to [[Paris]] to evade [[Nazism]], followed soon thereafter by his mother. They left Grothendieck in the care of Wilhelm Heydorn, a [[Lutheran]] [[pastor]] and teacher<ref name="jackson1">{{citation |last=Jackson |first=Allyn |author-link= |author2-link= |title=Comme Appelé du Néant — As If Summoned from the Void: The Life of Alexandre Grothendieck I |journal=Notices of the American Mathematical Society |volume=51 |issue=4 |year=2004 |url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200409/fea-grothendieck-part1.pdf |format=PDF |doi=}}</ref> in [[Hamburg]]. During this time, his parents took part in the [[Spanish Civil War]] as <!--auxiliaries-->non-combatants.<ref>Scharlau (2008), p. 931</ref>

===World War II===
In 1939, Grothendieck went to France and lived with his mother in various camps for displaced persons. The first was the [[Camp de Rieucros]]; later, for the remainder of [[World War II]], they lived in the village of [[Le Chambon-sur-Lignon]], sheltered and hidden in local boarding houses or [[Pension (lodging)|pension]]s. His father was arrested and sent via [[Drancy internment camp|Drancy]] to the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]], where he died in 1942.<ref name="nytob"/> In Chambon, Grothendieck attended the Collège Cévenol (now known as the [[Le Collège-Lycée Cévenol International]]), a unique secondary school founded in 1938 by local Protestant pacifists and anti-war activists. Many of the refugee children hidden in Chambon attended Cévenol, and it was at this school that Grothendieck apparently first became fascinated with mathematics.<ref name="Liberation-Douroux-Obit-2014-11-13"/>

===Studies and contact with research mathematics===
After the war, the young Grothendieck studied mathematics in France, initially at the [[University of Montpellier]] where he did not initially perform well, failing such classes as astronomy.<ref>http://images.math.cnrs.fr/Alexandre-Grothendieck.html#nh14</ref> Working on his own, he rediscovered the [[Lebesgue measure]]. After three years of increasingly independent studies there he went to continue his studies in Paris in 1948.<ref>See Jackson (2004:1).</ref>

Initially, Grothendieck attended [[Henri Cartan]]'s Seminar at [[École Normale Supérieure]], but he lacked the necessary background to follow the high-powered seminar. On the advice of Cartan and [[André Weil]], he moved to the [[University of Nancy]] where he wrote his dissertation under [[Laurent Schwartz]] and [[Jean Dieudonné]] on [[functional analysis]], from 1950 to 1953.<ref name="Festschrift">{{cite book |title=The Grothendieck Festschrift, Volume I: A Collection of Articles Written in Honor of the 60th Birthday of Alexander Grothendieck |author=Pierre Cartier, Luc Illusie, Nicholas M. Katz, Gérard Laumon, Yuri I. Manin |date=2007 |chapter=Foreword}}</ref> At this time he was a leading expert in the theory of [[topological vector space]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Book Reviews : Topological vector spaces, by A. Grothendieck |journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society |url=http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1976-82-04/S0002-9904-1976-14076-1/S0002-9904-1976-14076-1.pdf |issue= 4|doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1976-14076-1 |date=July 1976}}</ref> By 1957, he set this subject aside in order to work in algebraic geometry and [[homological algebra]].<ref name="Festschrift"/>

Comparing Grothendieck during his Nancy years to the [[École Normale Supérieure]] trained students at that time: [[Pierre Samuel]], [[Roger Godement]], [[Rene Thom]], [[Jacques Dixmier]], [[Jean Cerf]], [[Yvonne Bruhat]], [[Jean-Pierre Serre]], [[Bernard Malgrange]], [[Leila Schneps]] says:

{{quote|He was so completely unknown to this group and to their professors, came from such a deprived and chaotic background, and was, compared to them, so ignorant at the start of his research career, that his fulgurating ascent to sudden stardom is all the more incredible; quite unique in the history of mathematics.<ref>''Who Is Alexandre Grothendieck: Anarchy, Mathematics, Spirituality'' A three-volume biography of Alexandre Grothendieck, Volume 2, Chapter 3: [http://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~leila.schneps/grothendieckcircle/Mathematics/chap3.pdf From student to celebrity (1949-1952)]</ref>}}

===IHÉS years===
In 1958 Grothendieck was installed at the [[Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques|Institut des hautes études scientifiques]] (IHÉS), a new privately funded research institute  that, in effect, had been created for [[Jean Dieudonné]] and Grothendieck.{{sfn|Cartier|2004}} Grothendieck attracted attention by an intense and highly productive activity of seminars there (''de facto'' working groups drafting into foundational work some of the ablest French and other mathematicians of the younger generation).<ref name="jackson1"/> Grothendieck himself practically ceased publication of papers through the conventional, [[learned journal]] route. He was, however, able to play a dominant role in mathematics for around a decade, gathering a strong school.<ref name="artist">{{cite book |title=The Artist and the Mathematician |author=Amir D. Aczel |date=2009 |publisher=Basic Books}}</ref>

During this time, he had officially as students [[Michel Demazure]] (who worked on SGA3, on [[group scheme]]s), [[Luc Illusie]] (cotangent complex), [[Michel Raynaud]], [[Jean-Louis Verdier]] (cofounder of the [[derived category]] theory) and [[Pierre Deligne]]. Collaborators on the SGA projects also included [[Michael Artin]] ([[étale cohomology]]) and [[Nick Katz]] ([[monodromy theory]] and [[Lefschetz pencil]]s). [[Jean Giraud (mathematician)|Jean Giraud]] worked out [[torsor]] theory extensions of [[nonabelian cohomology]]. Many others were involved.

==="Golden Age"===
Alexander Grothendieck's work during the "Golden Age" period at the IHÉS established several unifying themes in [[algebraic geometry]], [[number theory]], [[topology]], [[category theory]] and [[complex analysis]].<ref name="Festschrift"/> His first (pre-IHÉS) discovery in algebraic geometry was the [[Grothendieck–Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem]], a generalisation of the [[Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem]] proved algebraically; in this context he also introduced [[K-theory]]. Then, following the programme he outlined in his talk at the 1958 [[International Congress of Mathematicians]], he introduced the theory of [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]], developing it in detail in his ''[[Éléments de géométrie algébrique]]'' (''EGA'') and providing the new more flexible and general foundations for algebraic geometry that has been adopted in the field since that time.<ref name="jackson1"/> He went on to introduce the [[étale cohomology]] theory of schemes, providing the key tools for proving the [[Weil conjectures]], as well as [[crystalline cohomology]] and algebraic [[de Rham cohomology]] to complement it. Closely linked to these cohomology theories, he originated [[topos]] theory as a generalisation of topology (relevant also in [[categorical logic]]). He also provided an algebraic definition of [[fundamental group]]s of schemes and more generally the main structures of a categorical [[Galois theory]]. As a framework for his [[coherent duality]] theory he also introduced [[derived category|derived categories]], which were further developed by Verdier.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Notes on derived categories and Grothendieck duality |author=Joseph Lipman |title=Foundations of Grothendieck Duality for Diagrams of Schemes |series=Lecture Notes in Math., no. 1960 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=New York |date=2009 |url=http://www.math.purdue.edu/~lipman/Duality.pdf}}</ref>

The results of work on these and other topics were published in the ''EGA'' and in less polished form in the notes of the ''[[Séminaire de géométrie algébrique]]'' (''SGA'') that he directed at the IHÉS.<ref name="jackson1"/>

===Politics and retreat from scientific community===
Grothendieck's political views were [[Political radicalism|radical]] and [[pacifist]], and he strongly opposed both [[United States]] [[Vietnam War|intervention in Vietnam]] and [[Soviet Empire|Soviet military expansionism]]. He gave lectures on [[category theory]] in the forests surrounding [[Hanoi]] while the city was being bombed, to protest against the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>''The Life and Work of Alexander Grothendieck'', ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'', vol. 113, no. 9, footnote 6.</ref> He retired from scientific life around 1970, after having discovered that the IHÉS was partly funded by the military.<ref>SGA1, Springer Lecture Notes 224, {{pp.|xii, xiii}}</ref> He returned to academia a few years later as a professor at the [[University of Montpellier]].

While the issue of military funding was perhaps the most obvious explanation for Grothendieck's departure from the IHÉS, those who knew him say that the causes of the rupture ran deeper. [[Pierre Cartier (mathematician)|Pierre Cartier]], a ''visiteur de longue durée'' ("long-term guest") at the IHÉS, wrote a piece about Grothendieck for a special volume published on the occasion of the [http://www.ams.org/notices/199903/ihes-changes.pdf IHÉS's fortieth anniversary]. The ''Grothendieck Festschrift'', published in 1990, was a three-volume collection of research papers to mark his sixtieth birthday in 1988.<ref>The editors were [[Pierre Cartier (mathematician)|Pierre Cartier]], [[Luc Illusie]], [[Nick Katz]], [[Gérard Laumon]], [[Yuri Manin]], and [[Ken Ribet]]. A second edition has been printed (2007) by Birkhauser.</ref>

In it, Cartier notes that as the son of an antimilitary anarchist and one who grew up among the disenfranchised, Grothendieck always had a deep compassion for the poor and the downtrodden. As Cartier puts it, Grothendieck came to find [[Bures-sur-Yvette]] "''une cage dorée''" ("a golden cage"). While Grothendieck was at the IHÉS, opposition to the Vietnam War was heating up, and Cartier suggests that this also reinforced Grothendieck's distaste at having become a mandarin of the scientific world.{{sfn|Cartier|2004}} In addition, after several years at the IHÉS, Grothendieck seemed to cast about for new intellectual interests. By the late 1960s, he had started to become interested in scientific areas outside mathematics. [[David Ruelle]], a physicist who joined the IHÉS faculty in 1964, said that Grothendieck came to talk to him a few times about [[physics]].<ref group="n">Ruelle<!--not Lorenz?--> invented the concept of a [[strange attractor]] in a [[dynamical system]] and, with the Dutch mathematician [[Floris Takens]], produced a new model for [[turbulence]] during the 1970s.</ref> [[Biology]] interested Grothendieck much more than physics, and he organized some seminars on biological topics.<ref>Allyn Jackson, [http://www.ams.org/notices/199903/ihes-changes.pdf The IHÉS at Forty], Notices of the AMS, March 1999, pp. 329-337.</ref>

In 1970, Grothendieck, with two other mathematicians, [[Claude Chevalley]] and [[Pierre Samuel]], created a political group called ''Survivre''—the name later changed to ''Survivre et vivre''. The group published a bulletin and was dedicated to antimilitary and ecological issues, and also developed strong criticism of the indiscriminate use of science and technology.{{sfn|Pragacz|2005}} Grothendieck devoted the next three years to this group and served as the main editor of its bulletin.{{sfn|Scharlau|2008}}

After leaving the IHÉS, Grothendieck became a [[temporary professor]] at [[Collège de France]] for two years.{{sfn|Pragacz|2005}} He then became a professor at the University of Montpellier, where he became increasingly estranged from the mathematical community. His mathematical career, for the most part, ended when he left the IHÉS.<ref name="nytob"/> He formally retired in 1988, a few years after having accepted a research position at the [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique|CNRS]].{{sfn|Scharlau|2008}}

===Manuscripts written in the 1980s===
While not publishing mathematical research in conventional ways during the 1980s, he produced several influential manuscripts with limited distribution, with both mathematical and biographical content.

Produced during 1980 and 1981, ''La Longue Marche à travers la théorie de Galois'' (''[[The Long March Through Galois Theory]]'') is a {{c.|link=on|1600-page}} handwritten manuscript containing many of the ideas that led to the ''[[Esquisse d'un programme]]''.<ref name="esquissefr">Alexandre Grothendieck, [http://matematicas.unex.es/~navarro/res/esquissefr.pdf Esquisse d'un Programme], [http://matematicas.unex.es/~navarro/res/esquisseeng.pdf English translation]</ref> It also includes a study of [[Teichmüller space|Teichmüller theory]].

In 1983, stimulated by correspondence with [[Ronald Brown (mathematician)|Ronald Brown]]<!--(see also [http://www.bangor.ac.uk/r.brown R. Brown])--> and Tim Porter at the [[Bangor University]], Grothendieck wrote a {{c.|600-page}} manuscript titled ''[[Pursuing Stacks]]'', starting with a letter addressed to [[Daniel Quillen]]. This letter and successive parts were distributed from Bangor (see [[#External links|External links]] below). Within these, in an informal, diary-like manner, Grothendieck explained and developed his ideas on the relationship between [[algebraic homotopy theory]] and [[algebraic geometry]] and prospects for a noncommutative theory of [[Stack (mathematics)|stack]]s. The manuscript, which is being edited for publication by G. Maltsiniotis, later led to another of his monumental works, ''Les Dérivateurs''. Written in 1991, this latter opus of about 2000 pages further developed the homotopical ideas begun in ''Pursuing Stacks''.<ref name="jackson2"/> Much of this work anticipated the subsequent development of the motivic homotopy theory of [[Fabien Morel]] and [[V. Voevodsky]] in the mid-1990s.

In 1984, Grothendieck wrote the proposal ''[[Esquisse d'un Programme]]''<ref name="esquissefr"/> ("Sketch of a Programme") for a position at the [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]] (CNRS). It describes new ideas for studying the [[moduli space]] of complex curves. Although Grothendieck himself never published his work in this area, the proposal inspired other mathematicians' work by becoming the source of [[dessin d'enfant]] theory and [[Anabelian geometry]]. It was later published in the two-volume [https://books.google.com/books?id=Hlf1j2XmXkcC&dq=Geometric+Galois+Actions&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=q9iN4QMkYj&sig=fAsvVlPOhN9K9LfjGFJC5zm_IA4&hl=en&ei=KW-3ScSkHYHIMuDukOEK&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result ''Geometric Galois Actions''] (Cambridge University Press, 1997).

During this period, Grothendieck also gave his consent to publishing some of his drafts for EGA on [[Theorem of Bertini|Bertini-type theorem]]s (''EGA''&nbsp;V, published in Ulam Quarterly in 1992-1993 and later made available on the [http://www.math.jussieu.fr/~leila/grothendieckcircle/index.php Grothendieck Circle] web site in 2004).

In the 1000-page autobiographical manuscript ''Récoltes et semailles'' (1986) Grothendieck describes his approach to mathematics and his experiences in the mathematical community, a community that initially accepted him in an open and welcoming manner but which he progressively perceived to be governed by competition and status. He complains about what he saw as the "burial" of his work and betrayal by his former students and colleagues after he had left the community.<ref name="jackson1"/> ''Récoltes et semailles'' work is now available on the internet in the French original,<ref name="grothen">{{fr icon}} Alexander Grothendieck, [http://www.math.jussieu.fr/~leila/grothendieckcircle/RetS.pdf "''Récoltes et sémailles'', ''Réflexions et témoignage sur un passé de mathématicien.''"]</ref> and an English translation is underway. Parts of ''Récoltes et semailles'' have been translated into Spanish<ref>{{cite web |url=http://matematicas.unex.es/~navarro/res/ |title=Récoltes et Semailles; La Clef des Songes|language=es}}</ref> and into Russian and published in Moscow.<ref>{{ru icon}} http://www.mccme.ru/free-books/grothendieck/RS.html</ref>

In 1988 Grothendieck declined the [[Crafoord Prize]] with an open letter to the media. He wrote that established mathematicians like himself had no need for additional financial support and criticized what he saw as the declining ethics of the scientific community, characterized by outright scientific theft that, according to him, had become commonplace and tolerated. The letter also expressed his belief that totally unforeseen events before the end of the century would lead to an unprecedented collapse of civilization. Grothendieck added however that his views are "in no way meant as a criticism of the Royal Academy's aims in the administration of its funds" and added "I regret the inconvenience that my refusal to accept the Crafoord prize may have caused you and the Royal Academy" and that he "apologized" for the inconvenience.<ref name=columbia>{{Wayback |date=20060106062005 |url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~lipyan/CrafoordPrize.pdf |title=Crafoord Prize letter, English translation}}</ref>

''La Clef des Songes'', a 315-page manuscript written in 1987, is Grothendieck's account of how his consideration of the source of dreams led him to conclude that [[Existence of God|God exists]].<ref>Scharlau 2008, p. 940.</ref> As part of the notes to this manuscript, Grothendieck described the life and word of 18 "mutants," people whom he admired as visionaries far ahead of their time and heralding a new age. The only mathematician on his list was [[Bernhard Riemann]].<ref>{{Citation

}}</ref> Influenced by the Catholic mystic [[Marthe Robin]] who was claimed to survive on the Holy Eucharist alone, Grothendieck almost starved himself to death in 1988.{{sfn|Scharlau|2008}} His growing preoccupation with spiritual matters was also evident in a letter entitled ''Lettre de la Bonne Nouvelle'' sent to 250 friends in January 1990. In it, he described his encounters with a deity and announced that a "New Age" would commence on 14 October 1996.<ref name="jackson2"/>

Over 20,000 pages of Grothendieck's mathematical and other writings, held at the University of Montpellier, remain unpublished.<ref>{{fr icon}} [http://www.liberation.fr/sciences/2012/07/01/le-tresor-oublie-du-genie-des-maths_830399 Le trésor oublié du génie des maths]</ref> They are now being digitized for preservation and will probably be made available to the mathematical community.<ref>{{fr icon}} [http://www.liberation.fr/sciences/2015/06/17/les-gribouillis-d-alexandre-grothendieck-enfin-sauvegardes_1331465 Les «gribouillis» d'Alexandre Grothendieck enfin sauvegardés]</ref>

===Retirement into reclusion and death===
In 1991, Grothendieck moved to a new address which he did not provide to his previous contacts in the mathematical community.{{sfn|Scharlau|2008}} Very few people visited him afterward. After his death, it was revealed that he lived alone in a house in [[Lasserre, Ariège]], a small village at the foot of the [[Pyrenees]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Alexandre Grothendieck, le plus grand mathématicien du XXe siècle, est mort |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/disparitions/article/2014/11/14/le-mathematicien-alexandre-grothendieck-est-mort_4523482_3382.html |publisher=Le Monde |date=November 14, 2014 |author1=Stéphane Foucart |author2=Philippe Pajot}}</ref>

In January 2010, Grothendieck wrote the letter "Déclaration d'intention de non-publication" to [[Luc Illusie]], claiming that all materials published in his absence have been published without his permission. He asks that none of his work be reproduced in whole or in part and that copies of this work be removed from libraries.<ref>http://sbseminar.wordpress.com/2010/02/09/grothendiecks-letter</ref> A website devoted to his work was called "an abomination."<ref>http://www.math.jussieu.fr/~leila/grothendieckcircle/</ref> This order may have been reversed later in 2010.<ref>http://www.math.u-psud.fr/~laszlo/sga4.html</ref>

On 13 November 2014, aged 86, Grothendieck died in the hospital of [[Saint-Girons, Ariège]].<ref name="Liberation-Douroux-Obit-2014-11-13">{{cite web |url=http://www.liberation.fr/sciences/2014/11/13/alexandre-grothendieck-ou-la-mort-d-un-genie-qui-voulait-se-faire-oublier_1142614 |title=Alexandre Grothendieck, ou la mort d'un génie qui voulait se faire oublier |date=13 November 2014 |work=Libération Sciences |accessdate=14 November 2014 |language=French}}</ref><ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11231703/Alexander-Grothendieck-obituary.html Alexander Grothendieck - obituary]</ref>

===Citizenship===
Grothendieck was born in [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]]. In 1938, aged ten, he moved to France as a refugee. Records of his nationality were destroyed in the fall of Germany in 1945 and he did not apply for French citizenship after the war. He thus became a stateless person for at least the majority of his working life, traveling on a [[Nansen passport]].{{sfn|Cartier|2004|loc=p. 10, footnote 12}}{{sfn|Cartier|2004|loc=p. 10, footnote 12}}{{sfn|Kleinert|2007}}{{sfn|Douroux|2012}}<!--Note: Douroux 2012's 1971 date is incorrect; given Cartier's other statements, 1981 (i.e. during the 1980s) is more credible (see Cartier 2001, p. 393: "...an absurd trial in 1977 due to a 1945 regulation that made it a misdemeanor to meet with a foreigner," indicating that Grothendieck did not have French nationality in 1977.--> Part of this reluctance to hold French nationality is attributed to not wishing to serve in the French military, particularly due to the [[Algerian War]] (1954–62).{{sfn|Cartier|2001}}{{sfn|Cartier|2004}}{{sfn|Kleinert|2007}} He eventually applied for French citizenship in the early 1980s, well past the age that exempted him from military service.{{sfn|Cartier|2004}}

===Family===
Grothendieck was very close to his mother to whom he dedicated his dissertation.

Grothendieck's early mathematical work was in [[functional analysis]]. Between 1949 and 1953 he worked on his doctoral thesis in this subject at [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], supervised by [[Jean Dieudonné]] and [[Laurent Schwartz]]. His key contributions include [[topological tensor product]]s of [[topological vector space]]s, the theory of [[nuclear space]]s as foundational for [[Schwartz distribution]]s, and the application of [[Lp space|L<sup>p</sup> spaces]] in studying linear maps between topological vector spaces. In a few years, he had turned himself into a leading authority on this area of functional analysis—to the extent that Dieudonné compares his impact in this field to that of [[Stefan Banach|Banach]].<ref>{{harv|Dieudonné|1990}}</ref>

It is, however, in [[algebraic geometry]] and related fields where Grothendieck did his most important and influential work. From about 1955 he started to work on [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] theory and [[homological algebra]], producing the influential "[[Tôhoku paper]]" (''Sur quelques points d'algèbre homologique'', published in the [[Tohoku Mathematical Journal]] in 1957) where he introduced [[Abelian category|abelian categories]] and applied their theory to show that [[sheaf cohomology]] can be defined as certain [[derived functor]]s in this context.<ref name="jackson1"/>

Homological methods and sheaf theory had already been introduced in algebraic geometry by [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] and others, after sheaves had been defined by [[Jean Leray]]. Grothendieck took them to a higher level of abstraction and turned them into a key organising principle of his theory. He shifted attention from the study of individual varieties to the ''[[Grothendieck's relative point of view|relative point of view]]'' (pairs of varieties related by a [[morphism]]), allowing a broad generalization of many classical theorems.{{sfn|Pragacz|2005}} The first major application was the relative version of Serre's theorem showing that the cohomology of a [[coherent sheaf]] on a complete variety is finite-dimensional; Grothendieck's theorem shows that the [[higher direct image]]s of coherent sheaves under a proper map are coherent; this reduces to Serre's theorem over a one-point space.

In 1956, he applied the same thinking to the [[Riemann–Roch theorem]], which had already recently been generalized to any dimension by [[Friedrich Hirzebruch|Hirzebruch]]. The [[Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem]] was announced by Grothendieck at the initial [[Mathematische Arbeitstagung]] in [[Bonn]], in 1957.{{sfn|Pragacz|2005}} It appeared in print in a paper written by [[Armand Borel]] with Serre. This result was his first work in algebraic geometry. He went on to plan and execute a programme for rebuilding the foundations of algebraic geometry, which were then in a state of flux and under discussion in [[Claude Chevalley]]'s seminar; he outlined his programme in his talk at the 1958 [[International Congress of Mathematicians]].

His foundational work on algebraic geometry is at a higher level of abstraction than all prior versions. He adapted the use of non-closed [[generic point]]s, which led to the theory of [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]]. He also pioneered the systematic use of [[nilpotent]]s. As 'functions' these can take only the value 0, but they carry [[infinitesimal]] information, in purely algebraic settings. His ''theory of schemes'' has become established as the best universal foundation for this field, because of its expressiveness as well as technical depth. In that setting one can use [[birational geometry]], techniques from [[number theory]], [[Galois theory]] and [[commutative algebra]], and close analogues of the methods of [[algebraic topology]], all in an integrated way.<ref name="jackson1"/><ref>See, for example, {{harv|Deligne|1998}}.</ref><ref name="Mclarty">{{cite web |last=Mclarty |first=Colin |title=The Rising Sea: Grothendieck on simplicity and generality I |url=http://people.math.jussieu.fr/~leila/grothendieckcircle/mclarty1.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=13 January 2008}}</ref>

He is also noted for his mastery of abstract approaches to mathematics and his perfectionism in matters of formulation and presentation.<ref name="artist"/> Relatively little of his work after 1960 was published by the conventional route of the [[learned journal]], circulating initially in duplicated volumes of seminar notes; his influence was to a considerable extent personal. His influence spilled over into many other branches of mathematics, for example the contemporary theory of [[D-module]]s. (It also provoked adverse reactions, with many mathematicians seeking out more concrete areas and problems.)<ref name="scienceline">{{citation |url=http://scienceline.org/2007/01/math_controversy_peck/ |last=Peck |first=Morgen |title=Equality of Mathematicians |quote=Alexandre Grothendieck is arguably the most important mathematician of the 20th century...}}</ref><ref name="spectator">{{citation |last=Leith |first=Sam |title=The Einstein of maths |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/12036/the-einstein-of-maths/ |journal=The Spectator |date=20 March 2004 |quote=[A] mathematician of staggering accomplishment ... a legendary figure in the mathematical world.}}</ref>

===''EGA'', ''SGA'', ''FGA''===
The bulk of Grothendieck's published work is collected in the monumental, yet incomplete, ''[[Éléments de géométrie algébrique]]'' (''EGA'') and ''[[Séminaire de géométrie algébrique]]'' (''SGA''). The collection ''[[Fondements de la Géometrie Algébrique]]'' (''FGA''), which gathers together talks given in the [[Séminaire Bourbaki]], also contains important material.<ref name="jackson1"/>

Grothendieck's work includes the invention of the [[Étale cohomology|étale]] and [[l-adic cohomology]] theories, which explain an observation of [[André Weil]]'s that there is a connection between the topological characteristics of a variety and its diophantine (number theoretic) properties.{{sfn|Pragacz|2005}} For example, the number of solutions of an equation over a [[finite field]] reflects the topological nature of its solutions over the [[complex number]]s. Weil realized that to prove such a connection one needed a new cohomology theory, but neither he nor any other expert saw how to do this until such a theory was found by Grothendieck.

This program culminated in the proofs of the [[Weil conjectures]], the last of which was settled by Grothendieck's student [[Pierre Deligne]] in the early 1970s after Grothendieck had largely withdrawn from mathematics.<ref name="jackson1"/>

===Major mathematical topics (from ''Récoltes et Semailles'')===
Grothendieck wrote a retrospective assessment of his mathematical work (see the external link ''La Vision'' below).{{sfn|Pragacz|2005}} As his main mathematical achievements ("maître-thèmes"), he chose this collection of 12 topics (his chronological order):{{sfn|Pragacz|2005}}

# [[Topological tensor product]]s and [[nuclear space]]s
# "Continuous" and "discrete" [[Duality (mathematics)|duality]] ([[derived category|derived categories]] and "[[six operations (mathematics)|six operations]]")
# ''Yoga'' of the [[Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem]] ([[K-theory]], relation with [[intersection theory]])
# [[Scheme (mathematics)|Scheme]]s
# [[topos|Topoi]]
# [[Étale cohomology]] including [[l-adic cohomology]]
# [[Motive (mathematics)|Motive]]s and the [[motivic Galois group]] (and [[Grothendieck category|Grothendieck categories]])
# Crystals and [[crystalline cohomology]], ''yoga'' of De Rham and Hodge coefficients
# Topological algebra, infinity-stacks, [[Derivator|'dérivateurs']], cohomological formalism of toposes as an inspiration for a new [[homotopic algebra]]
# [[Tame topology]]
# ''Yoga'' of [[anabelian geometry]] and [[Galois–Teichmüller theory]]
# Schematic point of view, or "arithmetics" for [[regular polyhedron|regular polyhedra]] and [[regular configurations]] of all sorts.

He wrote that the central theme of the topics above is that of topos theory, while the first and last were of the least importance to him.

Here the term ''yoga'' denotes a kind of "meta-theory" that can be used heuristically; [[Michel Raynaud]] writes the other terms "Ariadne's thread" and "philosophy" as effective equivalents.<ref>[http://www.ams.org/notices/200309/rev-raynaud.pdf, at p. 2.]</ref>

== Influence ==
Grothendieck is considered by many to be the greatest mathematician of the 20th century.<ref name=obit/>  In an obituary [[David Mumford]] and [[John Tate]] wrote:
<blockquote>Although mathematics became more and more abstract and general throughout the 20th century, it was Alexander Grothendieck who was the greatest master of this trend. His unique skill was to eliminate all unnecessary hypotheses and burrow into an area so deeply that its inner patterns on the most abstract level revealed themselves–and then, like a magician, show how the solution of old problems fell out in straightforward ways now that their real nature had been revealed.<ref name=obit>[http://www.dam.brown.edu/people/mumford/blog/2014/Grothendieck.html Alexander Grothendieck obituary by David Mumford and John Tate] David Mumford at Brown and Harvard Universities: Archive for Reprints: ''Can one explain schemes to biologists'', December 14, 2014</ref></blockquote>

By the 1970s, Grothendieck's work was seen as influential not only in algebraic geometry, and the allied fields of sheaf theory and homological algebra,<ref>[[Saunders MacLane]] and [[Ieke Moerdijk]] ''Sheaves in Geometry and Logic: A First Introduction to Topos Theory'', p599, New York : Springer-Verlag 1992.   ISBN 0387977104</ref> but had an impact on logic, in the field of categorical logic.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Dov M. Gabbay|author2=Akihiro Kanamori|author3=John Woods, Jr.|title=Sets and Extensions in the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZF_QckMFy-oC&pg=PA733|year=2012|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-51621-3|page=733}}</ref>

===Geometry===
Grothendieck approached algebraic geometry by clarifying the foundations of the field, and by developing mathematical tools intended to prove a number of notable conjectures. Algebraic geometry has traditionally meant the understanding of geometric objects, such as [[algebraic curve]]s and surfaces, through the study of the algebraic equations for those objects. Properties of algebraic equations are in turn studied using the techniques of [[ring theory]]. In this approach, the properties of a geometric object are related to the properties of an associated ring. The space (e.g., real, complex, or projective) in which the object is defined is extrinsic to the object, while the ring is intrinsic.

Grothendieck laid a new foundation for algebraic geometry by making intrinsic spaces ("spectra") and associated rings the primary objects of study. To that end he developed the theory of [[Scheme (mathematics)|schemes]], which can be informally thought of as [[topological space]]s on which a [[commutative ring]] is associated to every open subset of the space. Schemes have become the basic objects of study for practitioners of modern algebraic geometry. Their use as a foundation allowed geometry to absorb technical advances from other fields.<ref>{{cite book|author=Miles Reid|title=Undergraduate Algebraic Geometry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KvKdSkPwwmMC&pg=PA115|date=15 December 1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-35662-6|page=115}}</ref>

His [[Grothendieck–Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem|generalization]] of the classical [[Riemann-Roch theorem]] related topological properties of complex [[algebraic curve]]s to their algebraic structure. The tools he developed to prove this theorem started the study of [[Algebraic K-theory|algebraic]] and [[topological K-theory]], which study the topological properties of objects by associating them with rings.<ref name="Hartshorne AG">{{Hartshorne AG}}</ref> Topological K-theory was founded by [[Michael Atiyah]], after direct contact with Grothendieck's ideas at the [[Bonn Arbeitstagung]].<ref name="Atiyah2014">{{cite book|author=Michael Atiyah|title=Michael Atiyah Collected Works: Volume 7: 2002-2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rm6VAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA383|date=3 April 2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-968926-2|pages=383–}}</ref>

===Cohomology theories===
Grothendieck's construction of new [[cohomology]] theories, which use algebraic techniques to study topological objects, has influenced the development of [[algebraic number theory]], [[algebraic topology]], and [[representation theory]]. As part of this project, his creation of [[topos theory]], a category-theoretic generalization of [[point-set topology]], has influenced the fields of [[set theory]] and [[mathematical logic]].<ref>[[Saunders Mac Lane]] and [[Ieke Moerdijk]] (1992) ''Sheaves in Geometry and Logic: a First Introduction to Topos Theory''. Springer Verlag.</ref>

The [[Weil conjectures]] were formulated in the later 1940s as a set of mathematical problems in [[arithmetic geometry]]. They describe properties of analytic invariants, called [[local zeta function]]s, of the number of points on an algebraic curve or variety of higher dimension.  Grothendieck's discovery of the [[étale cohomology|ℓ-adic étale cohomology]], the first example of a [[Weil cohomology]] theory, opened the way for a proof of the Weil conjectures, ultimately completed in the 1970s by his student [[Pierre Deligne]].<ref name="Hartshorne AG"/> Grothendieck's large-scale approach has been called a "visionary program."<ref>{{cite book|author1=M. Ram Murty|author2=V. Kumar Murty|title=The Mathematical Legacy of Srinivasa Ramanujan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r4tGFgO_nc8C&pg=PA156|date=6 October 2012|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-81-322-0769-6|pages=156–}}</ref> The ℓ-adic cohomology then became a fundamental tool for number theorists, with applications to the [[Langlands program]].<ref>R. P. Langlands, Modular forms and l-adic representations, Lecture Notes in Math. 349. (1973), 361—500</ref>

Grothendieck's conjectural theory of [[Motive (algebraic geometry)|motive]]s was intended to be the "ℓ-adic" theory but without the choice of "ℓ", a prime number. It did not provide the intended route to the Weil conjectures, but has been behind modern developments in [[algebraic K-theory]], [[Motivic cohomology|motivic homotopy theory]], and [[motivic integration]].<ref>{{cite book |author=J.S. Milne |title=Étale cohomology |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1980}}</ref> This theory, [[Daniel Quillen]]'s work, and Grothendieck's theory of [[Chern class]]es, are considered the background to the theory of [[algebraic cobordism]], another algebraic analogue of topological ideas.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Marc Levine|author2=Fabien Morel|title=Algebraic Cobordism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=obVAAAAAQBAJ&pg=PR8|date=23 February 2007|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-36824-3|page=viii}}</ref>

===Category theory===
Grothendieck's emphasis on the role of [[Universal property|universal properties]] across varied mathematical structures brought [[category theory]] into the mainstream as an organizing principle for mathematics in general. Among its uses, category theory creates a common language for describing similar structures and techniques seen in many different mathematical systems.<ref>http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/category-theory/</ref> His notion of [[abelian category]] is now the basic object of study in [[homological algebra]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=S. Gelfand |author2=Yuri Manin |title=Methods of homological algebra |year=1988 |publisher=Springer}}</ref> The emergence of a separate mathematical discipline of category theory has been attributed to Grothendieck's influence, though unintentional.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ralph Krömer|title=Tool and Object: A History and Philosophy of Category Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=41bHxtHxjUAC&pg=PA158|date=25 June 2007|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-7643-7524-9|pages=158–}}</ref>

===In popular culture===
The novel ''Sketches of a Private Man'' (''Coronel lágrimas'', Anagrama, 2015) by Puerto Rican writer Carlos Fonseca is a semibiographic novel about Grothendieck.
