'''Cola''' is a [[Sweetness|sweetened]], [[Carbonation|carbonated]] [[soft drink]], derived from drinks that originally contained [[caffeine]] from the [[kola nut]] and [[cocaine]] from [[coca]] leaves, flavored with [[vanilla]] and other ingredients. Most colas now use other flavoring (and caffeinating) ingredients with a similar taste and no longer contain cocaine.{{clarification needed|reason=Do any modern colas include cocaine?|date=August 2015}} Colas became popular worldwide after [[pharmacist]] [[John Pemberton]] invented [[Coca-Cola]] in 1886.<ref name="cocaine">{{cite web|url=http://www.cocaine.org/cocawine.htm |title=Coca Wine |publisher=Cocaine.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}</ref> His non-alcoholic recipe was inspired by the [[coca wine]] of [[pharmacist]] [[Angelo Mariani (chemist)|Angelo Mariani]], created in 1863.<ref name="cocaine" />

Modern colas usually contain [[caramel color]], [[caffeine]] and sweeteners such as [[sugar]] or [[high fructose corn syrup]].

==Flavorings==
Despite the name, the primary modern flavoring ingredients in a cola drink are [[sugar]], [[citrus]] [[essential oil|oils]] (from oranges, limes, or lemon fruit peel), [[cinnamon]], [[vanilla]], and an acidic flavorant.<ref>{{cite web|author=DeNeefe, Janet |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/03/13/the-exotic-romance-tamarind.html |title=The Exotic Romance of Tamarind |publisher=The Jakarta Post |date=2008-03-13 |accessdate=2013-09-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sparror.cubecinema.com/cube/cola/chemistry/cola2.htm |title=Cola 2 |publisher=Sparror.cubecinema.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}</ref> Manufacturers of cola drinks add trace ingredients to create distinctively different tastes for each brand. Trace flavorings may include [[nutmeg]] and a wide variety of ingredients, but the base flavorings that most people identify with a cola taste remain vanilla and cinnamon. Acidity is often provided by [[phosphoric acid]], sometimes accompanied by [[citric acid|citric]] or other isolated acids. [[Coca-Cola formula|Coca-Cola's recipe]] and several others{{which|date=August 2013}} are maintained as corporate trade secrets.

A variety of different sweeteners may be added to cola, often partly dependent on local agricultural policy. [[High-fructose corn syrup]] (HFCS) is predominantly used in the [[United States of America|United States]] and [[Canada]] due to the lower cost of government-subsidized corn. In [[Europe]], however, HFCS is subject to production quotas designed to encourage the production of sugar; sugar is thus typically used to sweeten sodas.<ref>{{cite book |editor=M. Ataman Aksoy, John C. Beghin |title=Global Agricultural Trade and Developing Countries |year=2005 |publisher=World Bank Publications |isbn=0-8213-5863-4 |page=329 |chapter=Sugar Policies: An Opportunity for Change}}</ref> In addition, [[stevia]] or an [[artificial sweetener]] may be used; "sugar-free" or "diet" colas typically contain artificial sweeteners only.

Consumers may prefer the taste of soda manufactured with sugar; as in the United States, with imported [[Mexican Coke|Mexican Coca-Cola]].<ref>

==Health==
{{details|Coca-Cola#Health effects}}
A 2007 study found that consumption of colas, both those with natural sweetening and those with artificial sweetening, was associated with increased risk of chronic kidney disease. The [[phosphoric acid]] used in colas was thought to be a possible cause.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tina M. Saldana, Olga Basso, Rebecca Darden, and Dale P. Sandler |title=Carbonated beverages and chronic kidney disease |year=2007 |journal=[[Epidemiology (journal)|Epidemiology]] |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=501–6 |doi=10.1097/EDE.0b013e3180646338 |pmid=17525693 |pmc=3433753}}</ref>

Studies indicate "soda and sweetened drinks are the main source of calories in [the] American diet",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/05/050527111920.htm |title=Preliminary Data Suggest That Soda And Sweet Drinks Are The Main Source Of Calories In American Diet |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=May 27, 2005 |accessdate=July 2, 2011}}</ref> so most nutritionists advise that Coca-Cola and other soft drinks can be harmful if consumed excessively, particularly to young children whose soft drink consumption competes with, rather than complements, a balanced diet. Studies have shown that regular soft drink users have a lower intake of [[calcium]], [[magnesium]], [[ascorbic acid]], [[riboflavin]], and [[vitamin A]].<ref>Jacobson, Michael F. (2005).

Retrieved October 13, 2010.</ref>

The drink has also aroused criticism for its use of [[caffeine]], which can cause [[physical dependence]] ([[caffeine addiction]]).<ref>Center for Science in the Public Interest (1997). "[http://www.cspinet.org/new/caffeine.htm Label Caffeine Content of Foods, Scientists Tell FDA]."

Many soft drinks are sweetened mostly or entirely with high-fructose corn syrup, rather than sugar. Some nutritionists caution against consumption of corn syrup because it may aggravate obesity and type-2 diabetes more than cane sugar.<ref>[http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/news/ng.asp?id=51623-single-food-ingredient "Single food ingredient the cause of obesity ?
