Comics are published with a sequential number. The very first issue of the Marvel magazine 'The Amazing Spider-Man' was number 1 and that was followed by number 2 until the end of the run which ran to the hundreds. Number 1 is commonly the rarest and most desirable to collectors.</paragraph><paragraph>However, the first appearance of a character might be in an existing title. For example, Spider-Man's first appearance was in Amazing Fantasy number 15. New characters were often introduced this way, and did not receive their own titles until there was a proven audience for the hero. As a result, comics that feature the first appearance of an important character will sometimes be even harder to find than the number 1 issue of a character's own title.</paragraph><paragraph>Some rare comic books include copies of the unreleased<space/><italics><link><target>Motion Picture Funnies Weekly</target></link></italics><space/>#1 from 1939.

As of 2014, there are two companies that provide third party grading of comic book condition. Because condition is so important to the value of rare comics, the idea of grading by a company that does not buy or sell comics seems like a good one. However, there is some controversy about whether this grading service is worth the high cost, and whether it is a positive development for collectors, or if it primarily services speculators who wish to make a quick profit trading in comics as one might trade in stocks or fine art. Comic grading has created valuation standards that online price guides such as<space/><link type='external' href='http://comics.gocollect.com'>GoCollect</link><space/>and GPAnalysis have used to report on real-time market values.</paragraph><paragraph>The original artwork pages from comic books are also collected, and these are perhaps the rarest of all comic book collector's items, as there is only one unique page of artwork for each page that was printed and published. These were created by a writer who created the story, a pencil artist, who laid out the sequential panels on the page, an ink artist, who went over the pencil with pen and black ink, a letterer, who provided the dialogue and narration of the story by hand lettering each word and finally a colorist, who added color as the last step before the finished pages went to the printer.</paragraph><paragraph>When the original pages of artwork are returned by the printer, they are typically given back to the artists, who sometimes sell them at comic book conventions, or in galleries and art shows related to comic book art. The original pages of the first appearances of such legendary characters as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and Spider-man are considered priceless.</paragraph><heading level='2'>European comics</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>European comics</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='3'>Franco-Belgian comics</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Franco-Belgian comics</arg></template><link><target>File:Ren Goscinny.jpg</target><part></part><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>200px</part><part><link><target>Ren Goscinny</target></link><space/>(1926 1977), writer of the ''<link><target>Astrix</target></link>'' comic book series.</part></link><space/>France and<space/><link><target>Belgium</target></link><space/>have a long tradition in comics and comic books, called<space/><italics><link><target>Franco-Belgian comics</target><part>BDs</part></link></italics><space/>(an abbreviation of<space/><italics>bande dessines</italics>) in French and<space/><italics>strips</italics><space/>in<space/><link><target>Dutch language</target><part>Dutch</part></link>. Belgian comic books originally written in Dutch show the influence of the Francophone &quot;Franco-Belgian&quot; comics, but have their own distinct style.</paragraph><paragraph>The name<space/><italics>la bande dessine</italics><space/>derives from the original description of the art form as drawn strips (the phrase literally translates as &quot;the drawn strip&quot;), analogous to the sequence of images in a film strip. As in its English equivalent, the word &quot;bande&quot; can be applied to both film and comics. Significantly, the French-language term contains no indication of subject-matter, unlike the American terms &quot;comics&quot; and &quot;funnies&quot;, which imply an art form not to be taken seriously. The distinction of comics as<space/><italics>le neuvime art</italics><space/>(literally, &quot;the ninth art&quot;) is prevalent in French scholarship on the form, as is the concept of comics criticism and scholarship itself. Relative to the respective size of their populations, the innumerable authors in France and Belgium publish a high volume of comic books. In North America, the more serious Franco-Belgian comics are often seen as equivalent to graphic novels, but whether they are long or short, bound or in magazine format, in Europe there is no need for a more sophisticated term, as the art's name does not itself imply something frivolous.</paragraph><paragraph>In France, authors control the publication of most comics. The author works within a self-appointed time-frame, and it is common for readers to wait six months or as long as two years between installments. Most books first appear in print as a hardcover book, typically with 48, 56, or 64 pages.</paragraph><heading level='3'>British comics</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>British comics</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:2000AD168.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part><link><target>Judge Dredd</target></link><space/>is a British-American-made comic about &quot;Dredd&quot; who is an American law enforcement officer in a violent city of the future where uniformed Judges combine the powers of police, judge, jury and executioner.</part></link>Originally the same size as a usual comic book in the U.S. (although lacking the glossy cover), the British comic has adopted a magazine size, with<space/><italics><link><target>The Beano</target></link></italics><space/>and<space/><italics><link><target>The Dandy</target></link></italics><space/>the last to adopt this size (in the 1980s).

They took their current form shortly after World War II. They are usually published in black-and-white, except for the covers, which are usually printed in four colors, although occasionally, the first few pages may also be printed in full color. The term<space/><italics>manga</italics><space/>means &quot;random (or whimsical) pictures&quot;, and first came into common usage in the late 18th century with the publication of such works as<space/><link><target>Sant Kyden</target></link>'s picturebook<space/><template><target>Nihongo</target><arg>''Shiji no yukikai''</arg><arg>四時交加</arg><arg></arg></template><space/>(1798) and Aikawa Minwa's<space/><italics>Comic Sketches of a Hundred Women</italics><space/>(1798).

He introduced episodic storytelling and character development in comic format, in which each story is part of larger story arc. The only text in Tezuka's comics was the characters' dialogue and this further lent his comics a cinematic quality. Inspired by the work of Walt Disney, Tezuka also adopted a style of drawing facial features in which a character's<space/><link><target>human eye</target><part>eye</part><trail>s</trail></link>,<space/><link><target>human nose</target><part>nose</part></link>, and mouth are drawn in an extremely exaggerated manner. This style created immediately recognizable expressions using very few lines, and the simplicity of this style allowed Tezuka to be prolific. Tezuka's work generated new interest in the<space/><italics>ukiyo-e</italics><space/>tradition, in which the image is a representation of an idea, rather than a depiction of reality.</paragraph><paragraph>Though a close equivalent to the American comic book, manga has historically held a more important place in Japanese culture than comics have in American culture. Japanese society shows a wide respect for manga, both as an art form and as a form of popular literature. Many manga become television shows or short films. As with its American counterpart, some manga has been criticized for its sexuality and violence, although in the absence of official or even industry restrictions on content, artists have freely created manga for every age group and for every topic.</paragraph><paragraph>Manga magazinesalso known as &quot;anthologies&quot;often run several series concurrently, with approximately 20 to 40 pages allocated to each series per issue. These magazines range from 200 to more than 850 pages each. Manga magazines also contain<space/><link><target>One-shot (comics)</target><part>one-shot</part></link><space/>comics and a variety of four-panel yonkoma (equivalent to comic strips).
