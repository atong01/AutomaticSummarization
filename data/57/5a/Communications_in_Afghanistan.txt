'''Communications in Afghanistan''' is under the control of the [[Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Communications and Information Technology]] (MCIT). It has rapidly expanded after the [[Presidency of Hamid Karzai|Karzai administration]] took over in late 2001, and has embarked on wireless companies, internet, radio stations and television channels. The Afghan government signed a $64.5 agreement in 2006 with China's [[ZTE]] on the establishment of a countrywide [[optical fiber]] [[cable network]]. The project began to improve telephone, internet, television and radio broadcast services throughout [[Afghanistan]]. As of 2014, about 90% of the [[demography of Afghanistan|country's population]] has access to communication services.<ref name="Khitab">{{cite news |url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2014/01/01/90pc-afghans-get-access-telecom-services |title=90pc of Afghans get access to telecom services |publisher=[[Pajhwok Afghan News]] |first=Muhammad Hassan |last=Khetab |date=January 1, 2014 |accessdate=2014-07-10}}</ref>
