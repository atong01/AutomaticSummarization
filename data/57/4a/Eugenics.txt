While eugenic principles have been practiced as far back in world history as Ancient Greece, the modern [[history of eugenics]] began in the early 20th century when a popular eugenics movement emerged in Britain<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.jstor.org/stable/25054146?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=eugenics&searchText=immigration&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Deugenics%2Bimmigration%26amp%3Bprq%3Deugenics%26amp%3Bgroup%3Dnone%26amp%3Bacc%3Don%26amp%3Bhp%3D25%26amp%3Bso%3Drel%26amp%3Bfc%3Doff%26amp%3Bwc%3Don&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|title = Eugenic Ideas, Political Interests and Policy Variance Immigration and Sterilization Policy in Britain and U.S.|last = |first = |date = 1 Jan 2001|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-03-20}}</ref> and spread to many countries, including the [[Eugenics in the United States|United States]] and most European countries. In this period, eugenic ideas were espoused across the political spectrum. Consequently, many countries adopted eugenic policies meant to improve the genetic stock of their countries. Such programs often included both "positive" measures, such as encouraging individuals deemed particularly "fit" to reproduce, and "negative" measures such as marriage prohibitions and forced sterilization of people deemed unfit for reproduction. People deemed unfit to reproduce often included people with mental or physical disabilities, people who scored in the low ranges of different IQ tests, criminals and deviants, and members of disfavored minority groups. The eugenics movement became negatively associated with [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Holocaust]]—the murder by the German state of approximately 11 million people—when many of the [[defendants]] at the [[Nuremberg trials]] attempted to justify their human rights abuses by claiming there was little difference between the [[Nazi eugenics]] programs and the [[Eugenics in the United States|US eugenics]] programs.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Eugenics | author= Alison Bashford, Philippa Levine | publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=g15rfXUA2i8C&pg=PA327&lpg=PA327&dq=eugenics+defense+nuremberg+trials&source=bl&ots=hst4p7-key&sig=wNbijEF4UXm4hcOlUPBQ4pbYSE4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=TJhjVaOMO4eNsAWUl4CoAw&ved=0CFIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=eugenics%20defense%20nuremberg%20trials&f=false | page=327 }}</ref>
In the decades following [[World War II]], with the institution of [[human rights]], many countries gradually abandoned eugenics policies, although some Western countries, among them Sweden and the US, continued to carry out forced sterilizations for several decades.

A major critique of eugenics policies is that regardless of whether "negative" or "positive" policies are used, they are vulnerable to abuse because the criteria of selection are determined by whichever group is in political power. Furthermore, negative eugenics in particular is considered by many to be a violation of basic human rights, which include the right to reproduction.

However, the term "eugenics" to describe the modern concept of improving the quality of human beings born into the world was originally developed by [[Francis Galton]]. Galton had read his half-cousin [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]], which sought to explain the development of plant and animal species, and desired to apply it to humans. Galton believed that desirable traits were hereditary based on biographical studies.<ref name="credoreference.com">{{cite web|title=Eugenics: Immigration and Asylum from 1990 to Present|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/abcmigrate/eugenics|accessdate=2013-09-23}}</ref> In 1883, one year after Darwin's death, Galton gave his research a name: ''eugenics''.<ref>{{cite book|title=DNA: The Secret of Life|author1=Watson, James D.|author2=Berry, Andrew|year=2009|publisher=Knopf|url=http://www.amazon.com/DNA-The-Secret-Life-ebook/dp/B001PSEQAG}}</ref> Throughout its recent history, eugenics has remained a controversial concept.{{sfn|Blom|2008|p = 336}}

The scientific reputation of eugenics started to decline in the 1930s, a time when [[Ernst Rüdin]] used eugenics as a justification for the [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial policies of Nazi Germany]]. Nevertheless, in Sweden the eugenics program continued until 1975.<ref name="wsws"/> In addition to being practised in a number of countries, eugenics was internationally organized through the [[International Federation of Eugenics Organizations]].{{sfn|Black|2003|p=240}} Its scientific aspects were carried on through research bodies such as the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics]],{{sfn|Black|2003|p=286}} the Cold Spring Harbour Carnegie Institution for [[Experimental Evolution]],{{sfn|Black|2003|p=40}} and the [[Eugenics Record Office]].{{sfn|Black|2003|p=45}} Its political aspects involved advocating laws allowing the pursuit of eugenic objectives, such as sterilization laws.{{sfn|Black|2003|loc=Chapter 6: The United States of Sterilization}} Its moral aspects included rejection of the doctrine that all human beings are born equal, and redefining morality purely in terms of genetic fitness.{{sfn|Black|2003|p=237}} Its racist elements included pursuit of a pure "[[Nordic race]]" or "[[Aryan]]" genetic pool and the eventual elimination of "less fit" races.{{sfn|Black|2003|loc=Chapter 5: Legitimizing Raceology}}{{sfn|Black|2003|loc=Chapter 9: Mongrelization}}

As a social movement, eugenics reached its greatest popularity in the early decades of the 20th century. At this point in time, eugenics was practiced around the world and was promoted by governments and influential individuals and institutions. Many countries enacted<ref>{{cite book|last=Ridley|first=Matt|authorlink=Matt Ridley|title=Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters|year=1999|publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-089408-5|pages=290–1 |ref=harv}}</ref> various eugenics policies and programmes, including: genetic screening, [[birth control]], promoting differential birth rates, [[Marriage law#Marriage restrictions|marriage restrictions]], segregation (both [[racial segregation]] and segregation of the mentally ill from the rest of the population), [[compulsory sterilization]], [[forced abortion]]s or [[forced pregnancies]], and [[genocide]]. Most of these policies were later regarded as coercive or restrictive, and now few jurisdictions implement policies that are explicitly labelled as eugenic or unequivocally eugenic in substance. The methods of implementing eugenics varied by country; however, some early 20th century methods involved identifying and classifying individuals and their families, including the poor, mentally ill, blind, deaf, developmentally disabled, [[promiscuous women]], homosexuals, and [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial groups]] (such as the [[Romani people|Roma]] and [[Jews in Nazi Germany]]) as "degenerate" or "unfit", the segregation or institutionalization of such individuals and groups, their sterilization, [[euthanasia]], and their [[mass murder]].{{sfn|Black|2003}} The practice of euthanasia was carried out on hospital patients in the [[Aktion T4]] centers such as [[Hartheim Castle]].

By the end of [[World War II]], many of the discriminatory eugenics laws were largely abandoned, having become associated with Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Black|2003}}<ref>Lynn 2001. p. 18 "By the middle decades of the twentieth century, eugenics had become widely accepted throughout the whole of the economically developed world, with the exception of the Soviet Union."</ref> After World War II, the practice of "imposing measures intended to prevent births within [a population] group" fell within the definition of the new international crime of genocide, set out in the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]].<ref>Article 2 of the Convention defines genocide as any of the following acts committed with [[Genocide#Genocide as a crime|intent to destroy, in whole or in part]], a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as such as:

Developments in [[Genetic engineering|genetic]], [[Genetic testing|genomic]], and [[Human cloning|reproductive technologies]] at the end of the 20th century are raising numerous questions regarding the ethical status of eugenics, effectively creating a [[History of eugenics#Modern eugenics, genetic engineering, and ethical re-evaluation|resurgence of interest]] in the subject.
Some, such as [[UC Berkeley]] sociologist [[Troy Duster]], claim that modern genetics is a back door to eugenics.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Charles J|title=Is modern genetics the new eugenics?|journal=Genetics in Medicine|date=1 November 2003|volume=5|issue=6|pages=469–475|doi=10.1097/01.GIM.0000093978.77435.17|url=http://www.nature.com/gim/journal/v5/n6/full/gim2003376a.html}}</ref> This view is shared by White House Assistant Director for Forensic Sciences, [[Tania Simoncelli]], who stated in a 2003 publication by the Population and Development Program at [[Hampshire College]] that advances in [[pre-implantation genetic diagnosis]] (PGD) are moving society to a "new era of eugenics", and that, unlike the Nazi eugenics, modern eugenics is consumer driven and market based, "where children are increasingly regarded as made-to-order consumer products".<ref>Tania Simoncelli, "Pre-Implantation Genetic Diagnosis and Selection: from disease prevention to customised conception", ''Different Takes'', No. 24 (Spring 2003). http://genetics.live.radicaldesigns.org/downloads/200303_difftakes_simoncelli.pdf  Retrieved on Sept. 18, 2013.</ref> In a 2006 newspaper article, [[Richard Dawkins]] said that discussion regarding eugenics was inhibited by the shadow of Nazi misuse, to the extent that some scientists would not admit that breeding humans for certain abilities is at all possible.

Dawkins felt that enough time had elapsed to at least ask just what the ethical differences were between breeding for ability versus training athletes or forcing children to take music lessons, though he could think of persuasive reasons to draw the distinction.<ref>From the Afterward, by Richard Dawkins, ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'', (2006). http://www.heraldscotland.com/from-the-afterword-1.836155 Retrieved on Oct 17, 2013</ref>

Some, such as [[Nathaniel C.

In October 2015, the United Nations' [[International Bioethics Committee]] wrote that the ethical problems of [[human genetic engineering]] should not be confused with the ethical problems of the [[History of eugenics|20th century eugenics movements]]; however, it is still problematic because it challenges the idea of human equality and opens up new forms of discrimination and stigmatization for those who do not want or cannot afford the [[human enhancement|enhancements]].<ref>{{cite web | publisher=International Bioethics Committee | title=Report of the IBC on Updating Its Reflection on the Human Genome and Human Rights | url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002332/233258E.pdf | date=October 2, 2015 | access-date=October 22, 2015 | page=27 | quote=The goal of enhancing individuals and the human species by engineering the genes related to some characteristics and traits is not to be confused with the barbarous projects of eugenics that planned the simple elimination of human beings considered as ‘imperfect’ on an ideological basis.

It weakens the idea that the differences among human beings, regardless of the measure of their endowment, are exactly what the recognition of their equality presupposes and therefore protects. It introduces the risk of new forms of discrimination and stigmatization for those who cannot afford such enhancement or simply do not want to resort to it. The arguments that have been produced in favour of the so-called liberal eugenics do not trump the indication to apply the limit of medical reasons also in this case.}}</ref>

Haldane]] wrote that "the motor bus, by breaking up inbred village communities, was a powerful eugenic agent."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Haldane, J. |title=Lysenko and Genetics |journal=Science and Society |volume=4 |issue=4 |year=1940 |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/haldane/works/1940s/lysenko.htm}}</ref> Debate as to what exactly counts as eugenics has continued to the present day.<ref>A discussion of the shifting meanings of the term can be found in {{cite book |author=Paul, Diane |title=Controlling human heredity: 1865 to the present |publisher=Humanities Press |location=New Jersey |year=1995 |isbn=1-57392-343-5 }}</ref>

[[Edwin Black]], journalist and author of ''War Against the Weak'', claims eugenics is often deemed a [[pseudoscience]] because what is defined as a genetic improvement of a desired trait is often deemed a cultural choice rather than a matter that can be determined through objective scientific inquiry.<ref>{{cite book| publisher = Thunder's Mouth Press| isbn = 978-1-56858-321-1| page = 370| last = Black| first = Edwin| title = War Against the Weak| year = 2004}}</ref> The most disputed aspect of eugenics has been the definition of "improvement" of the human gene pool, such as what is a beneficial characteristic and what is a defect. This aspect of eugenics has historically been tainted with scientific racism.

Early eugenists were mostly concerned with perceived [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] factors that often correlated strongly with social class. Some of these early eugenists include [[Karl Pearson]] and [[Walter Weldon]], who worked on this at the [[University College London]].<ref name="credoreference.com"/>

Eugenics also had a place in medicine. In his lecture "Darwinism, Medical Progress and Eugenics", Karl Pearson said that everything concerning eugenics fell into the field of medicine. He basically placed the two words as equivalents. He was supported in part by the fact that Francis Galton, the father of eugenics, also had medical training.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Salgirli SG |title=Eugenics for the doctors: medicine and social control in 1930s Turkey |journal=Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences |volume=66 |issue=3 |pages=281–312 |date=July 2011  |pmid=20562206 |doi=10.1093/jhmas/jrq040}}</ref>

Eugenic policies have been conceptually divided into two categories. Positive eugenics is aimed at encouraging reproduction among the genetically advantaged; for example, the reproduction of the intelligent, the healthy, and the successful.<ref name="journals1.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca">http://journals1.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/tmp/15510468026065759357.pdf|date=September 2013{{dead link|date=June 2014}}</ref> Possible approaches include financial and political stimuli, targeted demographic analyses, ''in vitro'' fertilization, egg transplants, and cloning.<ref name = "glad2008">{{cite book |first=John |last=Glad |authorlink=John Glad |title=Future Human Evolution: Eugenics in the Twenty-First Century |publisher=Hermitage Publishers |location= |year=2008 |isbn=1-55779-154-6|url=http://www.whatwemaybe.org/txt/txt0000/Glad.John.2008.FHE.Meisenberg-abridgement.en.pdf}}</ref> The movie [[Gattaca]] provides a fictional example of positive eugenics done voluntarily. Negative eugenics aimed to eliminate, through sterilization or segregation, those deemed physically, mentally, or morally "undesirable".<ref name="journals1.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca"/> This includes abortions, sterilization, and other methods of family planning.<ref name = "glad2008"/> Both positive and negative eugenics can be coercive; abortion for [[Fitness (biology)|fit]] women, for example, was illegal in Nazi Germany.<ref>{{cite book|author=Pine, Lisa|title=Nazi Family Policy, 1933–1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nW2aE5-rAMsC&pg=PA19|accessdate=11 April 2012|year=1997|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-85973-907-5|pages=19–}}</ref>

[[Jon Entine]] claims that eugenics simply means "good genes" and using it as synonym for genocide is an "all-too-common distortion of the social history of genetics policy in the United States." According to Entine, eugenics developed out of the [[Progressive Era]] and not "Hitler's twisted [[Final Solution]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jon-entine/lets-cautiously-celebrate_b_6070462.html|title=Let's (Cautiously) Celebrate the "New Eugenics"|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=2 May 2015}}</ref>

===Implementation methods===
According to [[Richard Lynn]], eugenics may be divided into two main categories based on the ways in which the methods of eugenics can be applied.<ref>Lynn 2001. ''Part III. The Implementation of Classical Eugenics'' pp. 137–244 ''Part IV. The New Eugenics'' pp. 245–320</ref>

==Arguments==

===Doubts on traits triggered by inheritance===
The first major challenge to conventional eugenics based upon genetic inheritance was made in 1915 by [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], who demonstrated the event of [[Mutation|genetic mutation]] occurring outside of inheritance involving the discovery of the hatching of a [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly (''Drosophila melanogaster'')]] with white eyes from a family of red-eyes.{{sfn|Blom|2008|pp=336–7}} Morgan claimed that this demonstrated that major genetic changes occurred outside of inheritance and that the concept of eugenics based upon genetic inheritance was not completely scientifically accurate.{{sfn|Blom|2008|pp=336–7}} Additionally, Morgan criticized the view that subjective traits, such as intelligence and criminality, were caused by heredity because he believed that the definitions of these traits varied and that accurate work in genetics could only be done when the traits being studied were accurately defined.<ref>Flaws in Eugenics Research, by Garland E. Allen, Washington University. http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/html/eugenics/essay5text.html retrieved on Oct. 03, 2013.</ref>  In spite of Morgan's public rejection of eugenics, much of his genetic research was absorbed by eugenics.<ref>Scientific Origins of Eugenics, Elof Carlson, State University of New York at Stony Brook. http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/html/eugenics/essay2text.html Retrieved on Oct. 03, 2013.</ref><ref>Retrospectives, Eugenics and Economics in the Progressive Era, Journal of Economic Perspectives (2005). http://www.princeton.edu/~tleonard/papers/retrospectives.pdf Retrieved on Oct. 03, 2013</ref>

===Ethics===
{{expand section|date=February 2015}}
A common criticism of eugenics is that "it inevitably leads to measures that are unethical".<ref>Lynn 2001. ''The Ethical Principles of Classical Eugenics – Conclusions'' P. 241 "A number of the opponents of eugenics have resorted to the slippery slope argument, which states that although a number of eugenic measures are unobjectionable in themselves, they could lead to further measures that would be unethical."</ref> Historically, this statement is evidenced by the obvious control of one group imposing its agenda on minority groups.  This includes programs in England, Germany, and America targeting various groups, including Jews, homosexuals, Muslims, [[Romani people|Romani]], the homeless, and those with intellectual disabilities.<ref>Kessler, K. (2007). Physicians and the Nazi euthanasia program. International Journal of Mental Health, 36(1), 4-16. doi: 10.2753/IMH0020-7411360101</ref>

Many of the ethical concerns from eugenics arise from the controversial past, prompting a discussion on what place, if any, it should have in the future.  Advances in science have changed eugenics.  In the past, eugenics has had more to do with sterilization and enforced reproduction laws (i.e. no inter-racial marriage and marriage restrictions based on land ownership).<ref>Fischer, B. A. (2012). Maltreatment of people with serious mental illness in the early 20th century: A focus on Nazi Germany and eugenics in America. Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, 200, 1096-1100. doi: 10.1097/NMD.0b013e318275d391</ref> Now, in the age of a progressively mapped genome, embryos can be tested for susceptibility to disease, gender, and genetic defects, and alternative methods of reproduction such as in vitro fertilization are becoming more common.<ref>Hoge, S. K., & Appelbaum, P. S. (2012). Ethics and neuropsychiatric genetics: A review of major issues. International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology, 15, 1547-1557. doi: 10.1017/S1461145711001982</ref> In short, eugenics is no longer ex post facto regulation of the living but instead preemptive action on the unborn.

With this change, however, there are ethical concerns which lack adequate attention, and which must be addressed before eugenic policies can be properly implemented in the future.  Sterilized individuals, for example, could volunteer for the procedure, albeit under incentive or duress, or at least voice their opinion. The unborn fetus on which these new eugenic procedures are performed cannot speak out, as the fetus lacks the voice to consent or to express his or her opinion.<ref>Baird, S. L. (2007). Designer babies: Eugenics repackaged or consumer options? Technology Teacher, 66 (7), 12-16.</ref> The ability to manipulate a fetus and determine who the child will be is something questioned by many of the opponents of, and even proponents for, eugenic policies.

Societal and political consequences of eugenics call for a place in the discussion on the ethics behind the eugenics movement.<ref>Bentwich, M. (2013). On the inseparability of gender eugenics, ethics, and public policy: An Israeli perspective. American Journal of Bioethics, 13 (10), 43-45. doi:10.1080/15265161.2013.828128</ref> Public policy often focuses on issues related to race and gender, both of which could be controlled by manipulation of embryonic genes; eugenics and political issues are interconnected and the political aspect of eugenics must be addressed.  Laws controlling the subjects, the methods, and the extent of eugenics will need to be considered in order to prevent the repetition of the unethical events of the past.

Most of the ethical concerns about eugenics involve issues of morality and power.  Decisions about the morality and the control of this new science (and the subsequent results of the science) will need to be made as eugenics continue to influence the development of the science and medical fields.

===Losing genetic diversity by classifying traits as diseases===
{{See also|List of congenital disorders}}

Eugenic policies could also lead to loss of [[genetic diversity]], in which case a culturally accepted "improvement" of the gene pool could very likely—as evidenced in numerous instances in isolated island populations (e.g., the [[dodo]], ''Raphus cucullatus'', of Mauritius)—result in extinction due to increased vulnerability to disease, reduced ability to adapt to environmental change, and other factors both known and unknown. A long-term species-wide eugenics plan might lead to a scenario similar to this because the elimination of traits deemed undesirable would reduce genetic diversity by definition.<ref>(Galton 2001, 48){{full|date=September 2013}}</ref>

[[Edward M. Miller]] claims that, in any one generation, any realistic program should make only minor changes in a fraction of the gene pool, giving plenty of time to reverse direction if [[unintended consequences]] emerge, reducing the likelihood of the elimination of desirable genes.<ref name = "miller">{{cite journal |author=Miller, Edward M. |title=Eugenics: Economics for the Long Run |journal=Research in Biopolitics |volume=5 |pages=391–416 |year=1997 }}</ref> Miller also argues that any appreciable reduction in diversity is so far in the future that little concern is needed for now.<ref name = "miller"/>

While the science of genetics has increasingly provided means by which certain characteristics and conditions can be identified and understood, given the complexity of human genetics, culture, and psychology there is at this point no agreed objective means of determining which traits might be ultimately desirable or undesirable. Some diseases such as [[sickle-cell disease]] and [[cystic fibrosis]] respectively confer immunity to malaria and resistance to [[cholera]] when a single copy of the recessive allele is contained within the genotype of the individual. Reducing the instance of sickle-cell disease genes in Africa where malaria is a common and deadly disease could indeed have extremely negative net consequences.

However, some [[Genetic disorder|genetic diseases]] such as [[haemochromatosis]] can increase susceptibility to illness, cause physical deformities, and other dysfunctions, which provides some incentive for people to re-consider some elements of eugenics.

[[Autism|Autistic]] people have advocated a shift in perception of autism spectrum disorders as complex [[syndrome]]s rather than diseases that must be cured. Proponents of this view reject the notion that there is an "ideal" brain configuration and that any deviation from the norm is [[Anatomical pathology|pathological]]; they promote tolerance for what they call [[neurodiversity]].<ref>{{cite book |author= Williams CC |chapter= In search of an Asperger |editor= Stoddart KP |title= Children, Youth and Adults with Asperger Syndrome: Integrating Multiple Perspectives |year=2005 |publisher= Jessica Kingsley |isbn=1-84310-319-2 |pages=242–52 |quote= The life prospects of people with AS would change if we shifted from viewing AS as a set of dysfunctions, to viewing it as a set of differences that have merit.}}</ref> Baron-Cohen argues that the genes for [[Asperger syndrome|Asperger's]] combination of abilities have operated throughout recent [[human evolution]] and have made remarkable contributions to human history.<ref>{{cite book |title= Foundations of Evolutionary Psychology |chapter= The evolution of brain mechanisms for social behavior |author= Baron-Cohen S |pages=415–32 |editor= Crawford C, Krebs D (eds.) |publisher= Lawrence Erlbaum |year=2008 |isbn=0-8058-5957-8}}</ref> The possible reduction of autism rates through selection against the [[Heritability of autism|genetic predisposition to autism]] is a significant political issue in the [[autism rights movement]], which claims that autism is a part of [[neurodiversity]].

Many [[Deaf culture|culturally Deaf]] people oppose attempts to cure deafness, believing instead deafness should be considered a defining cultural characteristic not a disease.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Sound and Fury - Cochlear Implants - Essay|url = http://www.pbs.org/wnet/soundandfury/cochlear/essay.html|website = www.pbs.org|accessdate = 2015-08-01|publisher = [[PBS]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Understanding Deafness: Not Everyone Wants to Be 'Fixed'|url = http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/08/understanding-deafness-not-everyone-wants-to-be-fixed/278527/|accessdate = 2015-08-01|website = www.theatlantic.com|publisher = ''[[The Atlantic]]''}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Why not all deaf people want to be cured|url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/9526045/Why-not-all-deaf-people-want-to-be-cured.html|accessdate = 2015-08-02|website = www.telegraph.co.uk|publisher = ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''}}</ref> Some people have started advocating the idea that deafness brings about certain advantages, often termed "Deaf Gain."<ref>{{Cite web|title = Deaf Gain|url = http://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/deaf-gain|website = University of Minnesota Press|accessdate = 2015-09-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://dsdj.gallaudet.edu/assets/section/section2/entry19/DSDJ_entry19.pdf|title = Reframing: From Hearing Loss to Deaf Gain|last = Bauman|first = H-Dirksen L.|date = Fall 2009|journal = Deaf Studies Digital Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Murray|first2 = Joseph M.}}</ref>

===Heterozygous recessive traits===
The [[Zygosity|heterozygote]] [[Carrier testing|test]] is used for the early detection of [[recessive trait|recessive]] hereditary diseases, allowing for couples to determine if they are at risk of passing genetic defects to a future child.<ref name = "drze">http://www.drze.de/in-focus/predictive-genetic-testing/modules/heterozygote-test-screening-programmes |Heterozygote test / Screening programmes, German Reference Centre for Ethics in the Life Sciences, (Last retrieved Nov. 28, 2014).</ref> The goal of the test is to estimate the likelihood of passing the hereditary disease to future descendants.<ref name = "drze"/>

Recessive traits can be severely reduced, but never eliminated unless the complete genetic makeup of all members of the pool was known, as aforementioned. As only very few undesirable traits, such as Huntington's disease, are dominant, it could be argued{{by whom|date=November 2014}} from certain perspectives that the practicality of "eliminating" traits is quite low.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

There are examples of eugenic acts that managed to lower the prevalence of recessive diseases, although not influencing the prevalence of heterozygote carriers of those diseases. The elevated prevalence of certain genetically transmitted diseases among the [[Ashkenazi Jew]]ish population ([[Tay–Sachs disease|Tay–Sachs]], [[cystic fibrosis]], [[Canavan's disease]], and [[Gaucher's disease]]), has been decreased in current populations by the application of genetic screening.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/page.do/18624/The_Book_Shelf.html|title=Fatal Gift: Jewish Intelligence and Western Civilization|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813162344/http://www.jewishpress.com/page.do/18624/The_Book_Shelf.html|archivedate=13 August 2009}}</ref>

====Pleiotropic genes====
[[Pleiotropy]] occurs when  one [[gene]] influences multiple, seemingly unrelated [[phenotypic trait]]s, an example being [[phenylketonuria]], which is a human disease that affects multiple systems but is caused by one gene defect.<ref name="Stearns">{{cite journal | last1 = Stearns | first1 = F.

Pekalski uses the example of a coercive government eugenics program that prohibits people with [[myopia]] from breeding but has the unintended consequence of also selecting against high intelligence since the two go together.<ref name ="pekalski">{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = A | year = 2000 | title = Effect of eugenics on the evolution of populations | url = http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs100510070148 | journal = European Physical Journal B | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 329–332 | doi=10.1007/s100510070148|bibcode = 2000EPJB...17..329P }}</ref>

In 1909 the Anglican clergymen [[William Inge (priest)|William Inge]] and [[James Peile]] both wrote for the British [[Galton Institute|Eugenics Education Society]]. Inge was an invited speaker at the 1921 [[International Eugenics Conference]], which was also endorsed by the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York [[Patrick Joseph Hayes]].<ref name="Baker 2014 pp. 281–302" />

Early critics of the philosophy of eugenics included the American sociologist [[Lester Frank Ward]],<ref>{{cite book|first=Joan|last=Ferrante|title=Sociology: A Global Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AwnIIXI6y38C&pg=PA259|date=1 January 2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn= 978-0-8400-3204-1|pages=259–}}</ref> the English writer [[G. K. Chesterton]], the German-American anthropologist [[Franz Boas]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Turda, Marius|chapter=Race, Science and Eugenics in the Twentieth Century|editor=Bashford, Alison|editor2=Levine, Philippa|title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Eugenics|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=0-19-988829-9|pages= 72–73}}</ref> and Scottish tuberculosis pioneer and author [[Halliday Sutherland]]. Ward's 1913 article "Eugenics, [[Euthenics]], and [[Eudemics]]", Chesterton's 1917 book ''[[s:Eugenics and other Evils|Eugenics and Other Evils]]'', and Boas' 1916 article "Eugenics" (published in ''[[The Scientific Monthly]]'') were all harshly critical of the rapidly growing movement. Sutherland identified eugenists as a major obstacle to the eradication and cure of tuberculosis in his 1917 address "Consumption: Its Cause and Cure",<ref>"Consumption: Its Cause and Cure" An Address by Dr Halliday Sutherland on 4 September 1917, published by the Red Triangle Press.</ref> and criticism of eugenists and Neo-[[Malthusianism|Malthusian]]s in his 1921 book ''Birth Control'' led to a writ for libel from the eugenist [[Marie Stopes]]. Several biologists were also antagonistic to the eugenics movement, including [[Lancelot Hogben]].<ref>"Lancelot Hogben, who developed his critique of eugenics and distaste for racism in the period...he spent as Professor of Zoology at the University of Cape Town".  Alison Bashford and Philippa Levine, ''The Oxford Handbook of the History of Eugenics''. Oxford; Oxford University Press, 2010 ISBN 0199706530 (p.200)</ref> Other biologists such as [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and [[Ronald Fisher|R. A. Fisher]] expressed skepticism that sterilization of "defectives" would lead to the disappearance of undesirable genetic traits.<ref>"Whatever their disagreement on the numbers, Haldane, Fisher, and most geneticists could support Jennings's warning: To encourage the expectation that the sterilization of defectives will "solve the problem of hereditary defects, close up the asylums for feebleminded and insane, do away with prisons, is only to subject society to deception". Daniel J. Kevles, ''In the Name of Eugenics''. University of California Press, 1985. ISBN 0520057635 (p. 166).</ref>

Some supporters of eugenics later reversed their positions on it. For example, H. G. Wells, who had called for "the sterilization of failures" in 1904,<ref name="jt" /> stated in his 1940 book ''The Rights of Man: Or What are we fighting for?'' that among the [[human rights]] he believed should be available to all people was "a prohibition on mutilation, sterilization, torture, and any bodily punishment".<ref>Andrew Clapham, ''Human Rights:A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford : [[Oxford University Press]], 2007. ISBN 9780199205523 (pp. 29-31).</ref>

Among institutions, the [[Catholic Church]] was an opponent of state-enforced sterilizations.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Congar|first1=Yves M.-J.|date=1953 |title=The Catholic Church and the race question |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0000/000028/002893eo.pdf |format=pdf |location=Paris, France |publisher=UNESCO|access-date=2015-07-03 |quote=4. The State is not entitled to deprive an individual of his procreative power simply for material (eugenic) purposes. But it is entitled to isolate individuals who are sick and whose progeny would inevitably be seriously tainted.}}</ref> Attempts by the Eugenics Education Society to persuade the British government to legalise voluntary sterilisation were opposed by Catholics and by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].{{page needed|date=June 2015}} The [[Society for Biodemography and Social Biology|American Eugenics Society]] initially gained some Catholic supporters, but Catholic support declined following the 1930 papal encyclical ''[[Casti connubii]]''.<ref name="Baker 2014 pp. 281–302" /> In this, [[Pope Pius XI]] explicitly condemned sterilization laws: "Public magistrates have no direct power over the bodies of their subjects; therefore, where no crime has taken place and there is no cause present for grave punishment, they can never directly harm, or tamper with the integrity of the body, either for the reasons of eugenics or for any other reason."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_31121930_casti-connubii_en.html|title=''Casti connubii''|author=Pope Pius XI}}</ref>
