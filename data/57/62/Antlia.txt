'''Antlia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|n|t|l|i|ə}}; from [[Ancient Greek]] ''ἀντλία'') is a [[constellation]] in the southern sky. Its name means "[[pump]]" and it specifically represents an air pump. The constellation was created in the 18th century from an undesignated region of sky, so the stars comprising Antlia are faint. The brightest star is [[Alpha Antliae]] is an orange [[giant star|giant]] that is a suspected [[variable star]], ranging between [[apparent magnitude]]s 4.22 and 4.29. [[NGC 2997]], a [[spiral galaxy]], and the [[Antlia Dwarf|Antlia Dwarf Galaxy]] lie within Antlia's borders.

==History==
[[File:Antlia bode.JPG|thumb|border|300px|left|Johann Bode's depiction of Antlia.]]
The French astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]]  first described the constellation in French as ''la Machine Pneumatique'' (the Pneumatic Pump) in 1751–52,<ref name=ridpathlac>{{cite web |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/lacaille.htm |title=Lacaille’s Southern Planisphere of 1756 |work=Star Tales |author=[[Ian Ridpath|Ridpath, Ian]] |publisher=Self-published |accessdate=25 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Lacaille, Nicolas Louis |year=1756 |title=Relation abrégée du Voyage fait par ordre du Roi au cap de Bonne-espérance |journal=Mémoires de l'Académie Royale des Sciences |pages=519–592 [589] |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k35505/f787 |language=French}}</ref> commemorating the [[air pump]] invented by the French physicist [[Denis Papin]].<ref name="startales">{{cite web |last = Ridpath |first = Ian |work= Star Tales |title= Antlia |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/antlia.htm |accessdate=3 December 2007| <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> He had observed and catalogued almost 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the [[Cape of Good Hope]], devising fourteen new constellations in uncharted regions of the [[Southern Celestial Hemisphere]] not visible from Europe. All but one honoured instruments that symbolised the [[Age of Enlightenment]].{{efn|1=The exception is [[Mensa (constellation)|Mensa]], named for the [[Table Mountain]]. The other thirteen (alongside Antlia) are [[Caelum]], [[Circinus]], [[Fornax]], [[Horologium (constellation)|Horologium]], [[Microscopium]], [[Norma (constellation)|Norma]], [[Octans]], [[Pictor]], [[Pyxis]], [[Reticulum]], [[Sculptor (constellation)|Sculptor]] and  [[Telescopium]].{{sfn|Wagman|2003|pp=5-6}} }}{{sfn|Wagman|2003|pp=5-6}} Lacaille Latinised the name to ''Antlia pneumatica'' on his 1763 chart. John Herschel proposed shrinking the name to one word, which was universally taken up.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=25}}

Though Antlia was technically visible to ancient Greek astronomers, its stars were too faint to have been included in any constellations.<ref name="startales"/> Because of this, its main stars have no particular pattern and it is devoid of bright deep-sky objects.<ref name="moore"/>
Lacaille and [[Johann Bode]] each depicted Antlia differently, as either the single-cylinder vacuum pump used in Papin's initial experiments, or the more advanced double-cylinder version.<ref name="startales"/> The [[International Astronomical Union]] subsequently adopted it as one of the 88 modern constellations. There is no mythology attached to Antlia as Lacaille discontinued the tradition of giving names from mythology to constellations and instead chose names mostly from scientific instruments.<ref name="startales"/>

According to some, the most prominent stars that now comprise Antlia were once included within the ancient constellation [[Argo Navis]], the Ship of the Argonauts, which due to its immense size was split into several smaller constellations by Lacaille in 1763.<ref>Peter Birren (2002) Objects in the Heavens, pp. 9, 45 (ISBN 155369662X).</ref><ref>Thomas William Webb (Dover Publications 1962) Celestial objects for common telescopes, Volume 2, p. 36.</ref> However, given the faintness and obscurity of its stars, most authorities do not believe that the ancient Greeks included Antlia as part of their classical depiction of Argo Navis.<ref>Ian Ridpath (2002) Stars and Planets, pp, 65, 122. (ISBN 0-7894-8988-0)</ref>

=== In non-Western astronomy ===
Chinese astronomers were able to view what is modern Antlia from their latitudes, and incorporated its stars into two different constellations. Several stars in the southern part of Antlia were a portion of "''Dong'ou''", which represented an area in southern China.<ref name="startales"/> Furthermore, [[Epsilon Antliae|Epsilon]], [[Eta Antliae|Eta]], and [[Theta Antliae]] were incorporated into the celestial temple, which also contained stars from modern [[Pyxis]].<ref name="startales"/>

Lacaille gave nine stars [[Bayer designation]]s, labelling them Alpha through to Theta, including two stars next to each other as Zeta. Gould later added a tenth, [[Iota Antliae]]. Beta and Gamma Antliae (now [[HR 4339]] and [[HD 90156]]) ended up in the neighbouring constellation Hydra once the constellation boundaries were delineated in 1930.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=29}} Within the constellation's borders, there are 42 stars brighter than or equal to [[apparent magnitude]]&nbsp;6.5.{{efn|1=Objects of magnitude 6.5 are among the faintest visible to the unaided eye in suburban-rural transition night skies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/resources/darksky/3304011.html?page=1&c=y|title=The Bortle Dark-Sky Scale|last=Bortle|first=John E.|date=February 2001|work=[[Sky & Telescope]]|accessdate=26 August 2015}}</ref>}}<ref name=tirionconst/>

[[DEN 1048-3956]] is a [[brown dwarf]] located around 13 light-years distant from Earth. At magnitude 17 it is much too faint to be seen with the unaided eye.

===Deep-sky objects===
[[File:NGC 2997 ESO.jpg|thumb|border|left|300px|A composite image of NGC 2997.]]
Because it occupies a part of the [[celestial sphere]] that faces away from the [[Milky Way]], Antlia contains very few deep-sky objects. It contains no [[globular cluster]]s, no [[planetary nebula]]e, and no [[open cluster]]s. However, it does contain several galaxies.

[[NGC 2997]] is a loose face-on [[spiral galaxy]] of type [[Galaxy morphological classification|Sc]].<ref name="princeton"/> It is the brightest galaxy in Antlia at an integrated magnitude of 10.6.<ref name="moore"/> Though nondescript in most amateur telescopes, it presents bright clusters of young stars and many dark dust lanes in photographs.<ref name="princeton"/>
