'''Economy of [[Croatia]]''' is a service-based economy with the [[tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary sector]] accounting for 70% of total [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). After the collapse of [[socialism]], Croatia went through a process of transition to a [[Market economy|market-based economy]] in the 1990s, but its economy suffered badly during the [[Croatian War of Independence|1991-95 war]]. After the war the economy began to improve, before the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]] the Croatian economy grew at a healthy 4-5% annually, incomes doubled, and economic and social opportunities dramatically improved.

Croatia joined the [[World Trade Organization]] in 2000, [[NATO]] in 2009 and became a member of the [[European Union]] on 1 July 2013. Croatian economy was badly affected by the financial crisis which, together with slow progress of economic reforms, resulted in six years of recession and a cumulative decline in GDP of 12,5%. Croatia formally emerged from the recession with 3 continuous quarters of GDP growth in Q4 2014 (0,3%), Q1 2015 (0,5%) and Q2 2015 (1,2%). Predictions are that real GDP growth will gradually rise to 1.2% in 2016.

The industrial sector with exports of over €1 billion annually is dominated by shipbuilding which accounts for over 10% of exported goods. Food processing and chemical industry also account for significant portions of industrial output and exports. Industrial sector represents 27% of Croatia’s total economic output while agriculture represents 6%. Industrial sector is responsible for 25% of Croatia's GDP, with agriculture, forestry and fishing accounting for the remaining 5% of Croatian GDP.

[[Tourism]] is traditionally a notable source of income, particularly during the summer months, but also more recently during the winter months as well, due to an increase in popularity of snow sports such as [[skiing]]. With over 10 million foreign tourists annually, tourism generates revenue in excess of €7 billion. Croatia is ranked among the top 20 most popular tourist destinations in the world, and was voted world's top tourism destination in 2005 by [[Lonely Planet]].<ref name=Lonely_Planet>[http://www.lonelyplanet.com/columns/index.htm Top Destinations for 2005]</ref>

Trade plays a major role in Croatian economic output. In 2007 Croatia's exports were valued at USD 12.84 billion (24.7 billion including service exports). According to Healy Consultants, trade in Croatia is bolstered by its low trade-weighted average tariff of just 1.2%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Advantages of Croatia Company Registration |url=http://www.healyconsultants.com/croatia-company-registration/|publisher=Healy Consultants|accessdate=5 February 2015}}</ref> Croatia's currency is the [[Croatian Kuna|Kuna]], which was implemented in 1994 and has remained stable since.

==History==

===Pre-1990===
[[File:Viktor Kovačić- Palača Burze, Trg Burze, Zagreb, 1922- 1927.jpg|thumb|left|[[Zagreb]] [[Zagreb Stock Exchange|Stock Exchange Palace]] in 1927]]
[[File:Rijeka oil refinery around 1930.jpg|thumb|left|[[Oil refinery]] in [[Rijeka]] in the 1930s]]
During the 19th century the [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]] had a high ratio of population working in agriculture. Many industrial branches developed in that time, like forestry and wood industry ([[stave (wood)|stave]] fabrication, the production of potash, lumber mills, shipbuilding). The most profitable one was stave fabrication, the boom of which started in the 1820s with the clearing of the oak forests around [[Karlovac]] and [[Sisak]] and again in the 1850s with the marshy oak masses along the Sava and Drava rivers. Shipbuilding in Croatia played a huge role in the 1850s [[Austrian Empire]], especially the longe-range sailing boats. Sisak and [[Vukovar]] were the centres of river-shipbuilding.<ref>[http://hrcak.srce.hr/81678 Mariann Nagy - Croatia in the Economic Structure of the Habsburg Empire in the Light of the 1857 Census], p. 81-82</ref> [[Kingdom of Slavonia|Slavonia]] was also mostly an agricultural land and it was known for its silk production. [[Agriculture]] and the breeding of cattle were the most profitable occupations of the inhabitants. It produced [[corn]] of all kinds, [[hemp]], [[flax]], [[tobacco]], and great quantities of [[liquorice]].<ref name=Nagy>[http://hrcak.srce.hr/81678 Mariann Nagy - Croatia in the Economic Structure of the Habsburg Empire in the Light of the 1857 Census], p. 88</ref><ref name=Penny>[[Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge]]: The Penny Cyclopaedia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, vol 22, p. 100-101</ref>

The first steps towards [[industrialization]] began in the 1830s and in the following decades the construction of big industrial enterprises took place.<ref>Mikulas Teich, Roy Porter: [https://books.google.com/books?id=z7GVCC0hlBsC The Industrial Revolution in National Context: Europe and the USA], Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 310</ref> During the 2nd half of the 19th and early 20th century there was an upsurge of industry in Croatia, strengthened by the construction of [[Croatian Railways|railways]] and the [[Energy in Croatia|electric-power production]]. However, the industrial production was still lower than agricultural production.<ref>Mikulas Teich, Roy Porter: [https://books.google.com/books?id=z7GVCC0hlBsC The Industrial Revolution in National Context: Europe and the USA], Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 311</ref> 
Regional differences were high. Industrialization was faster in inner Croatia than in other regions, while [[Kingdom of Dalmatia|Dalmatia]] remained one of the poorest provinces of Austria-Hungary.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tanner|first=Marcus|title=Croatia: a nation forged in war|year=2001|edition=2nd|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|location=New Haven; London|page=110|isbn=0-300-09125-7|ref=harv}}</ref>
The slow rate of modernization and rural overpopulation caused extensive emigration, particularly from Dalmatia. According to estimates, roughly 400,000 Croats emigrated from Austria-Hungary between 1880 and 1914. In 1910 8,5% of the population of [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Croatia-Slavonia]] lived in urban settlements.<ref name=Frucht>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lVBB1a0rC70C Richard C. Frucht: Eastern Europe: An Introduction to the People, Land, and Culture], p. 462-463</ref>

In 1918 Croatia became part of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], which was in the interwar period one of the least developed countries in Europe. Most of its industry was based in Slovenia and Croatia, but further industrial development was modest and centered on textile mills, sawmills, brick yards and food-processing plants. Economy was stil traditionally based on agriculture and raising of livestock, with peasants accounting for more than half of Croatia's population.<ref name=Frucht/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-84_kkgMf2QC The First Yugoslavia: Search for a Viable Political System], Hoover Press, 1983, p. 72</ref>

In 1941 the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH), a [[World War II]] [[puppet state]] of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Italy]], was established in parts of [[World War II in Yugoslavia|Axis-occupied Yugoslavia]]. The economic system of NDH was based on the concept of "Croatian [[socialism]]".<ref name=Yeomans1>Rory Yeomans:[http://books.google.com/books?id=Yxv4-iqVe2wC Visions of Annihilation: The Ustasha Regime and the Cultural Politics of Fascism, 1941-1945], University of Pittsburgh Pre, 2013, p. 197</ref> The main characteristic of the new system was the concept of a [[planned economy]] with high levels of state involvement in economic life. The fulfillment of basic economic interests was primarily ensured with measures of repression.<ref name=Matkovic>[[Hrvoje Matković]]: Povijest nezavisne države Hrvatske, Drugo, dopunjeno izdanje Zagreb, 2002., p. 118</ref> All large companies were placed under state control and the property of the regime's national enemies was nationalized. Its currency was the [[Independent State of Croatia kuna|NDH kuna]]. The Croatian State Bank was the central bank, responsible for issuing currency. As the war progressed the government kept printing more money and its amount in circulation was rapidly increasing, resulting in high inflation rates.<ref>Jozo Tomašević: Rat i revolucija u Jugoslaviji 1941-1945, 2010, p. 785</ref>

After the World War II, the new [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] resorted to a command economy on the Soviet model of rapid industrial development. By 1948 almost all domestic and foreign-owned capital had been nationalized. The industrialization plan relied on high taxation, fixed prices, [[World War II reparations towards Yugoslavia|war reparations]], Soviet credits, and export of food and raw materials. Forced collectivization of agriculture was initiated in 1949. At that time 94% of agricultural land was privately owned, and by 1950 96% was under the control of the social sector. A rapid improvement of food production and the standard of living was expected, but due to bad results the program was abandoned three years later.<ref name=Frucht/>

Throughout the 1950s Croatia experienced rapid urbanization. [[Decentralization]] came in 1965 and spurred growth of several sectors including the prosperous [[Tourism in Croatia|tourist industry]]. [[SR Croatia]] was, after [[SR Slovenia]], the second most developed republic in Yugoslavia with a 25% higher GDP per capita than the Yugoslav average. Croatia and Slovenia accounted for nearly half of the total Yugoslav GDP, and this was reflected in the overall [[standard of living]]. In the mid-1960s, Yugoslavia lifted emigration restrictions and the number of emigrants increased rapidly. In 1971 224,722 workers from Croatia were employed abroad, mostly in [[West Germany]].<ref>[http://www.photius.com/countries/croatia/society/yugoslavia_former_society_guest_workers.html The Library of Congress Country Studies; CIA World Factbook]</ref><ref>Ivo Nejašmić: [http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=187703 Hrvatski građani na radu u inozemstvu: razmatranje popisnih podataka 1971, 1981. i 1991.]</ref> Foreign remittances contributed $2 billion annually to the economy by 1990.<ref>Europa Publications Limited. ''Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States 1999: 1999''. Routledge, 1999. (pg. 279)</ref>
Profits gained through Croatia's industry were used to develop poor regions in other parts of former Yugoslavia, leading to Croatia contributing much more to the federal Yugoslav economy than it gained in return. This, coupled with [[austerity|austerity program]]s and [[hyperinflation]] in the 1980s, led to discontent in both Croatia and Slovenia which eventually fuelled political movements calling for independence.<ref name=IBP>International Business Publications: [https://books.google.com/books?id=qND3Dii7qjIC Croatia Investment and Trade Laws and Regulations Handbook], p. 22</ref>

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, with the collapse of socialism and the beginning of [[Transition economy|economic transition]], Croatia faced considerable economic problems stemming from:<ref>[http://www.iiasa.ac.at/~marek/fbook/00/geos/hr.html CIA - The World Factbook 2000 - Croatia]</ref>
* the legacy of longtime communist mismanagement of the economy;
* damage during the internecine fighting to bridges, factories, power lines, buildings, and houses;
* the large refugee and displaced population, both Croatian and Bosnian;
* the disruption of economic ties; and
* mishandled privatization

At the time Croatia gained independence, its economy (and the whole [[Economy of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavian economy]]) was in the middle of recession. Privatization under the new government had barely begun when war broke out in 1991. As a result of the [[Croatian War of Independence]], infrastructure sustained massive damage in the period 1991-92, especially the revenue-rich tourism industry. [[Privatization in Croatia]] and transformation from a planned economy to a [[market economy]] was thus slow and unsteady, largely as a result of public mistrust when many state-owned companies were sold to politically well-connected at below-market prices. With the end of the war, Croatia's economy recovered moderately, but corruption, cronyism, and a general lack of transparency stymied economic reforms and foreign investment.<ref name=IBP/><ref name=Benczes>Istvan Benczes: [https://books.google.com/books?id=f4R2BgAAQBAJ Deficit and Debt in Transition: The Political Economy of Public Finances in Central and Eastern Europe], Central European University Press, 2014, p. 203</ref> The privatization of large government-owned companies was practically halted during the war and in the years immediately following the conclusion of peace. As of 2000, roughly 70% of Croatia's major companies were still state-owned, including water, electricity, oil, transportation, telecommunications, and tourism.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lVBB1a0rC70C Eastern Europe: An Introduction to the People, Land, and Culture], p. 473</ref>

Early 1990s were characterized with high inflation rates. In 1991 the [[Croatian dinar]] was introduced as a transitional currency, but inflation continued to accelerate. The anti-inflationary stabilization steps in 1993 decreased retail price inflation from a monthly rate of 38,7% to 1,4%, and by the end of the year Croatia experienced deflation. In 1994 Croatia introduced the [[Croatian kuna|kuna]] as its currency.<ref name=Benczes/>

As a result of the macro-stabilization programs, the negative growth of GDP during the early 1990s stopped and turned into a positive trend. Post-war reconstruction activity provided another impetus to growth. Consumer spending and private sector investments, both of which were postponed during the war, contributed to the growth in 1995-1997.<ref name=Benczes/> Croatia began its independence with a relatively low external debt because the debt of Yugoslavia was not shared among its former republics at the beginning. In March 1995 Croatia agreed with the Paris Club of creditor governments and took 28,5% of Yugoslavia's previously non-allocated debt over 14 years. In July 1996 an agreement was reached with the London Club of commercial creditors, when Croatia took 29,5% of Yugoslavia's debt to commercial banks. In 1997 around 60 percent of Croatia's external debt was inherited from former Yugoslavia.<ref name=Benczes2>Istvan Benczes: [https://books.google.com/books?id=f4R2BgAAQBAJ Deficit and Debt in Transition: The Political Economy of Public Finances in Central and Eastern Europe], Central European University Press, 2014, p. 205-206</ref>

At the beginning of 1998 value-added tax was introduced. The central government budget was in surplus in that year, most of which was used to repay foreign debt.<ref>OECD: [https://books.google.hr/books?id=WxvKqey-mmoC Agricultural Policies in Emerging and Transition Economies 1999], p. 43</ref> Government debt to GDP had fallen from 27,30% to 26,20% at the end of 1998. However, the consumer boom was distrupted in mid 1998, as a result of the bank crisis when 14 banks went bankrupt.<ref name=Benczes/> Unemployment increased and GDP growth slowed down to 1,9%. The [[recession]] that began at the end of 1998 continued through most of 1999, and after a period of expansion GDP in 1999 had a negative growth of -0,9%.<ref name=unstats>[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/introduction.asp National Accounts Main Aggregates Database]</ref> In 1999 the government tightened its fiscal policy and revised the budget with a 7% cut in spending.<ref name=Gale>Gale Research: [https://books.google.hr/books?id=uX8pX4H3u0kC Countries of the World and Their Leaders: Yearbook 2001], p. 456</ref>

In 1999 the private sector share in GDP reached 60%, which was significantly lower than in other former socialist countries. After several years of successful macroeconomic stabilization policies, low inflation and a stable currency, economists warned that the lack of fiscal changes and the expanding role of the state in economy caused the decline in the late 1990s and were preventing a sustainable economic growth.<ref name=Benczes2/><ref name=Gale/>

The new government led by the president of [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia|SDP]], [[Ivica Račan]], carried out a number of structural reforms after it won the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2000|parliamentary elections on 3 January 2000]]. The country emerged from the recession in the 4th quarter of 1999 and growth picked up in 2000.<ref>Istvan Benczes:[https://books.google.com/books?id=f4R2BgAAQBAJ Deficit and Debt in Transition: The Political Economy of Public Finances in Central and Eastern Europe], Central European University Press, 2014, p. 207</ref> Due to overall increase in stability, the economic rating of the country improved and [[interest rate]]s dropped. Economic growth in the 2000s was stimulated by a credit boom led by newly privatized banks, capital investment, especially in road construction, a rebound in tourism and credit-driven consumer spending. Inflation remained tame and the currency, the kuna, stable.<ref name=IBP/><ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/hr.html CIA Factbook - Croatia]</ref>

In 2000 Croatia generated 5,899 billion kunas in total income from the shipbuilding sector, which employed 13,592 people. Total exports in 2001 amounted to $4,659,286,000, of which 54,7% went to the countries of the EU. Croatia's total imports were $9,043,699,000, 56% of which originated from the EU.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lVBB1a0rC70C Richard C. Frucht: Eastern Europe: An Introduction to the People, Land, and Culture], p. 468</ref>

Unemployment reached its peak in late 2002, but has since been steadily declining. In 2003, the nation's economy would officially recover to the amount of GDP it had in 1990.<ref name=croa44>http://euce.org/eusa/2011/papers/2f_adams.pdf</ref> In late 2003 the new government led by [[HDZ]] took over the office. Unemployment continued falling, powered by growing industrial production and rising GDP, rather than only seasonal changes from tourism. Unemployment reached an all-time low in 2008 when the annual average rate was 8,6%,<ref name=eurostat>[http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=une_rt_a&lang=en Eurostat: Unemployment rate by sex and age groups - annual average]</ref> GDP per capita peaked at $16,158,<ref name=unstats/> while public debt as percentage of GDP decreased to 29%. Most economic indicators remained positive in this period except for the [[external debt]] as Croatian firms focused more on empowering the economy by taking loans from foreign resources.<ref name=croa44 /> Between 2003 and 2007, Croatia’s private-sector share of GDP increased from 60% to 70%.<ref>http://www.qfinance.com/country-profiles/croatia</ref>

The [[Croatian National Bank]] had to take steps to curb further growth of indebtedness of local banks with foreign banks.  The dollar debt figure is quite adversely affected by the [[euro|EUR]]/[[USD]] ratio &mdash; over a third of the increase in debt since 2002 is due to currency value changes.

===2009 – present===

Economic growth has been hurt by the global financial crisis.<ref name=heritage>[http://www.heritage.org/index/country/croatia 2015 Index of Economic Freedom - Croatia]</ref> Immediately after the crisis it seemed that Croatia did not suffer serious consequences like some other countries. However, in 2009, the crisis gained momentum and the decline in GDP growth, at a slower pace, continued during 2010. In 2011 the GDP stagnated as the growth rate was zero.<ref name=Dalic>Martina Dalić (2013): “Croatia: A Prolonged Crisis  without  Recovery”  in  Novotny Vitt (ed.)  “[https://books.google.com/books?id=UYZcCO9UEfkC From Reform to Growth: Managing the Economic Crisis in Europe]”, Centre for European Studies, Brussels,  May/2013, p. 67-88</ref> Since the global crisis hit the country, the unemployment rate has been steadily increasing, resulting in the loss of more than 100,000 jobs.<ref>http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/croatia-loses-battle-with-crisis</ref> While unemployment was 9.6% in late 2007,<ref name = "bwhuxz">[http://www.hnb.hr/statistika/e-ekonomski_indikatori.htm?tsfsg=15127d5832d6ac210a43438afd2fc966 Ekonomski Indikatori<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> in January 2014 it peaked at 22.4%.<ref name="dzs.hr"/> In 2010 [[Gini coefficient]] was 0,32.<ref>http://www.dzs.hr/Hrv_Eng/publication/2011/14-01-02_01_2011.htm</ref> In September 2012, Fitch ratings agency unexpectedly improved Croatia's economic outlook from negative to stable, reafirming Croatia's current BBB rating.<ref>http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/fitch-unexpectedly-improves-croatian-economic-outlook</ref> The slow pace of privatization of state-owned businesses and an overreliance on tourism have also been a drag on the economy.<ref name=heritage/>

Croatia joined the [[European Union]] on 1 July 2013 as the 28th member state. The Croatian economy is heavily interdependent on other principal economies of Europe, and any negative trends in these larger EU economies also have a negative impact on Croatia. Italy, Germany and Slovenia are Croatia's most important trade partners.<ref name=Dalic/> In spite of the rather slow post-recession recovery, in terms of income per capita it is still ahead of some European Union member states such as [[Bulgaria]], and [[Romania]].<ref name=EurostatGDP>[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/GDP_per_capita,_consumption_per_capita_and_comparative_price_levels Per capita GDP]</ref> In terms of average monthly wage, Croatia is ahead of 9 EU members ([[Czech Republic]], [[Estonia]], [[Slovakia]], Latvia, [[Poland]], [[Hungary]], [[Lithuania]], Romania, and Bulgaria).<ref>[[List of countries in Europe by monthly average wage]]</ref>

Annual average unemployment rate in 2014 was 17.3% and Croatia has the third highest unemployment rate in the European Union, after [[Greece]] (26.5%), and [[Spain]] (24.%).<ref name=eurostat/> Of particular concern is the heavily backlogged [[judiciary]] system, combined with inefficient [[public administration]], especially regarding the issues of land ownership and corruption in the public sector. Unemployment is regionally uneven: it is very high in eastern and southern parts of the country, nearing 20% in some areas, while relatively low in the north-west and in larger cities, where it is between 3 and 7%. In 2015 external debt rose by 2.7 billion euros since the end of 2014 and is now around €49.3 billion.

[[Tourism in Croatia|Tourism]] is a notable source of income during the summer and a major industry in Croatia. It dominates the Croatian service sector and accounts for up to 20% of Croatian GDP. Annual tourist industry income for 2011 was estimated at €6.61&nbsp;billion. Its positive effects are felt throughout the economy of Croatia in terms of increased business volume observed in retail business, processing industry orders and summer seasonal employment. The industry is considered an export business, because it significantly reduces the country's external trade imbalance.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Vjesnik|url=http://www.vjesnik.hr/Article.aspx?ID=D37B6CB1-C728-44FE-94C7-8C80B4EA582F|archivedate=14 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68PYhbBry|language=Croatian|title=Iako čini gotovo petinu BDP-a, i dalje niskoprofitabilna grana domaće privrede|trans_title=Even though it comprises nearly a fifth of the GDP, it is still a low-profit branch of the national economy|author1=Tomislav Pili|author2=Davor Verković|date=1 October 2011|accessdate=20 October 2011}}</ref> Since the conclusion of the Croatian War of Independence, the tourist industry has grown rapidly, recording a fourfold rise in tourist numbers, with more than 10&nbsp;million tourists each year. The most numerous are tourists from [[Germany]], Slovenia, Austria and the [[Czech Republic]] as well as Croatia itself. Length of a tourist stay in Croatia averages 4.9 days.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[T-Hrvatski Telekom]]|work=t-portal.hr|language=Croatian|url=http://www.tportal.hr/biznis/gospodarstvo/148403/Turisticki-prihod-porast-ce-prvi-put-nakon-2008.html|date=14 September 2011|title=Turistički prihod porast će prvi put nakon 2008.|trans_title=Tourist income to rise for the first time since 2008|accessdate=21 October 2011}}</ref>

The bulk of the tourist industry is concentrated along the Adriatic Sea coast. [[Opatija]] was the first holiday resort since the middle of the 19th century. By the 1890s, it became one of the most significant European health resorts.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Opatija Tourist Board|url=http://www.opatija-tourism.hr/en/Home.aspx?PageID=5|title=History of Opatija|accessdate=21 October 2011}}</ref> Later a large number of resorts sprang up along the coast and numerous islands, offering services ranging from [[mass tourism]] to catering and various niche markets, the most significant being [[nautical tourism]], as there are numerous marinas with more than 16&nbsp;thousand berths, [[cultural tourism]] relying on appeal of medieval coastal cities and numerous cultural events taking place during the summer. Inland areas offer mountain resorts, [[agrotourism]] and [[spa]]s. Zagreb is also a significant tourist destination, rivalling major coastal cities and resorts.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Croatian National Tourist Board]]|url=http://croatia.hr/en-GB/Activities-and-attractions|title=Activities and attractions|accessdate=21 October 2011}}</ref>

===Agriculture===

Croatian [[agricultural]] sector subsists from exports of [[Maritime geography#Blue water|blue water fish]], which in recent years experienced a tremendous surge in demand, mainly from [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]]. Croatia is a notable producer of [[organic food]]s and much of it is exported to the European Union. [[Croatian wine]]s, [[olive oil]] and [[lavender]] are particularly sought after.
