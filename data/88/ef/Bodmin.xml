Hurling survives as a traditional part of beating the bounds at Bodmin, commencing at the close of the 'Beat'. The game is organised by the<space/><link><target>Rotary club</target></link><space/>of Bodmin and was last played in 2015. The game is started by the Mayor of Bodmin by throwing a silver ball into a body of water known as the &quot;Salting Pool&quot;. There are no teams and the hurl follows a set route. The aim is to carry the ball from the &quot;Salting Pool&quot; via the old<space/><link><target>A30 road</target><part>A30</part></link>, along Callywith Road, then through Castle Street, Church Square and Honey Street to finish at the Turret Clock in Fore Street. The participant carrying the ball when it reaches the turret clock will receive a 10 reward from the mayor.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.rotary-ribi.org/clubs/page.asp?PgID</arg><arg name="title">2010 Bodmin Hurl Rules</arg><arg name="website">Rotary Club of Bodmin</arg><arg name="accessdate">2 April 2010</arg><arg name="archiveurl">http://web.archive.org/web/20111005032340/http://www.rotary-ribi.org/clubs/page.asp?PgID</arg><arg name="archivedate">5 October 2011</arg></template></extension><space/>In 2015, beating of the bounds and Cornish hurling took place at Bodmin 8 April organised by the<space/><link><target>Rotary club</target></link><space/>of Bodmin.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.rotary-ribi.org/clubs/page.php?PgID</arg><arg name="accessdate">15 April 2015</arg><arg name="title">Beating the Town Bounds {{ndash}} Photos</arg><arg name="website">Rotary & Lions Clubs of Bodmin</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>List of topics related to Cornwall</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Bodmin (UK Parliament constituency)</target><part>List of Bodmin MPs</part></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Bodmin NHS Treatment Centre (Bodmin Hospital)</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Bodmin manumissions</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Beast of Bodmin</target></link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>Reflist</target><arg>30em</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>Further reading</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem>Henderson, Charles (1935) &quot;Some Notes on Bodmin Priory&quot;, in:<space/><italics>Essays in Cornish History</italics>.
