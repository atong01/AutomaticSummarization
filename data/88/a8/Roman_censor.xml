It naturally grew out of the right which they possessed of excluding persons from the lists of citizens; for, as has been well remarked, &quot;they would, in the first place, be the sole judges of many questions of fact, such as whether a citizen had the qualifications required by law or custom for the rank which he claimed, or whether he had ever incurred any judicial sentence, which rendered him infamous: but from thence the transition was easy, according to Roman notions, to the decisions of questions of right; such as whether a citizen was really worthy of retaining his rank, whether he had not committed some act as justly degrading as those which incurred the sentence of the law.&quot;<space/></paragraph><paragraph>In this manner, the censors gradually assumed at least nominal complete superintendence over the whole public and private life of every citizen.
