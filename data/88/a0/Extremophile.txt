An '''extremophile''' (from Latin ''{{lang|la|extremus}}'' meaning "extreme" and Greek ''{{lang|grc-Latn|philiā}}'' ({{lang|grc|φιλία}}) meaning "love") is an [[organism]] that thrives in physically or geochemically [[extreme environment|extreme conditions]] that are detrimental to most [[life on Earth]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rampelotto | first1 = P.

==Characteristics==
In the 1980s and 1990s, biologists found that microbial life has an amazing flexibility for surviving in extreme environments — niches that are extraordinarily hot, or acidic, for example — that would be completely inhospitable to complex organisms. Some scientists even concluded that life may have begun on Earth in [[hydrothermal vent]]s far under the ocean's surface.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/merlaunch.pdf |title=Mars Exploration - Press kit |accessdate=14 July 2009 |date=June 2003 |format=PDF |publisher=NASA }}</ref> According to astrophysicist Dr. Steinn Sigurdsson, "There are viable bacterial spores that have been found that are 40 million years old on Earth — and we know they're very hardened to radiation."<ref>{{cite web |author=BBC Staff |title=Impacts 'more likely' to have spread life from Earth |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14637109 |date=23 August 2011 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=24 August 2011}}</ref> On 6 February 2013, scientists reported that [[bacteria]] were found living in the cold and dark in a lake buried a half-mile deep under the ice in [[Antarctica]].<ref name="NYT-20130206">{{cite web |last=Gorman |first=James |title=Bacteria Found Deep Under Antarctic Ice, Scientists Say |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/science/living-bacteria-found-deep-under-antarctic-ice-scientists-say.html |date=6 February 2013 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=6 February 2013 }}</ref> On 17 March 2013, researchers reported data that suggested [[microbes|microbial life forms]] thrive in the [[Mariana Trench]], the deepest spot on the Earth.<ref name="LS-20130317">{{cite web |last=Choi |first=Charles Q. |title=Microbes Thrive in Deepest Spot on Earth |url=http://www.livescience.com/27954-microbes-mariana-trench.html |date=17 March 2013 |publisher=[[LiveScience]] |accessdate=17 March 2013 }}</ref><ref name="NG-20130317">{{cite journal |last1=Glud |first1=Ronnie |last2=Wenzhöfer |first2=Frank |last3=Middleboe |first3=Mathias |last4=Oguri |first4=Kazumasa |last5=Turnewitsch |first5=Robert |last6=Canfield |first6=Donald E. |last7=Kitazato |first7=Hiroshi |title=High rates of microbial carbon turnover in sediments in the deepest oceanic trench on Earth |url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo1773.html |doi=10.1038/ngeo1773 |date=17 March 2013 |journal=[[Nature Geoscience]] |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=284–288 |accessdate=17 March 2013 |bibcode = 2013NatGe...6..284G }}</ref> Other researchers reported related studies that microbes thrive inside rocks up to 1900 feet below the sea floor under 8500 feet of ocean off the coast of the northwestern United States.<ref name="LS-20130317" /><ref name="LS-20130314">{{cite web |last=Oskin |first=Becky |title=Intraterrestrials: Life Thrives in Ocean Floor |url=http://www.livescience.com/27899-ocean-subsurface-ecosystem-found.html |date=14 March 2013 |publisher=[[LiveScience]] |accessdate=17 March 2013 }}</ref> According to one of the researchers,"You can find microbes everywhere — they're extremely adaptable to conditions, and survive wherever they are."<ref name="LS-20130317" />

==Morphology==
Most known extremophiles are microbes. The domain [[Archaea]] contains renowned examples, but extremophiles are present in numerous and diverse [[gene]]tic lineages of [[bacteria]] and archaeans. Furthermore, it is erroneous to use the term extremophile to encompass all archaeans, as some are [[Mesophile|mesophilic]]. Neither are all extremophiles unicellular; [[protostome]] animals found in similar environments include the [[Alvinella pompejana|Pompeii worm]], the [[Psychrophile|psychrophilic]] [[Grylloblattidae]] ([[insect]]s) and [[Antarctic krill]] (a [[crustacean]]). Many would also classify [[tardigrade]]s (water bears) as extremophiles but while tardigrades can survive in extreme environments, they are not considered extremophiles because they are not adapted to live in these conditions. Their chances of dying increase the longer they are exposed to the extreme environment.

==Classifications==
There are many classes of extremophiles that range all around the globe, each corresponding to the way its environmental niche differs from mesophilic conditions. These classifications are not exclusive. Many extremophiles fall under multiple categories and termed as [[polyextremophile]]s. For example, organisms living inside hot rocks deep under Earth's surface are thermophilic and barophilic such as ''Thermococcus barophilus''.<ref>[http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/00207713-49-2-351 Thermococcus barophilus sp. nov., a new barophilic and hyperthermophilic archaeon isolated under high hydrostatic pressure from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent. ''IJSEM'', p. 351-359, 49, 1999].</ref> A polyextremophile living at the summit of a mountain in the [[Atacama Desert]] might be a [[radioresistant]] [[xerophile]], a [[psychrophile]], and an [[oligotroph]]. Polyextremophiles are well known for their ability to tolerate both high and low [[pH]] levels.

== In astrobiology ==
[[Astrobiology]] is the field concerned with forming theories, such as [[panspermia]], about the distribution, nature, and future of life in the universe. In it, microbial ecologists, astronomers, planetary scientists, geochemists, philosophers, and explorers cooperate constructively to guide the search for life on other planets. Astrobiologists are particularly interested in studying extremophiles, as many organisms of this type are capable of surviving in environments similar to those known to exist on other planets. For example, Mars may have regions in its deep subsurface permafrost that could harbor [[endolith]] communities.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} The subsurface water ocean of [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] may harbor life, especially at hypothesized hydrothermal vents at the ocean floor.

Recent research carried out on extremophiles in [[Japan]] involved a variety of [[bacteria]] including ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Paracoccus denitrificans]]'' being subject to conditions of extreme gravity. The bacteria were cultivated while being rotated in an [[ultracentrifuge]] at high speeds corresponding to 403,627 [[Gravity of Earth|g]] (i.e. 403,627 times the gravity experienced on Earth). ''Paracoccus denitrificans'' was one of the bacteria which displayed not only survival but also robust cellular growth under these conditions of hyperacceleration which are usually found only in cosmic environments, such as on very massive stars or in the shock waves of [[supernova]]s. Analysis showed that the small size of prokaryotic cells is essential for successful  growth under [[hypergravity]]. The research has implications on the feasibility of [[panspermia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/04/110425-gravity-extreme-bacteria-e-coli-alien-life-space-science/|title=Bacteria Grow Under 400,000 Times Earth's Gravity |author=Than, Ker |date=25 April 2011 |work=National Geographic- Daily News|publisher=National Geographic Society |accessdate=28 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Deguchi|first1=Shigeru |author2=Hirokazu Shimoshige, Mikiko Tsudome, Sada-atsu Mukai, Robert W.

New sub-types of -philes are identified frequently and the sub-category list for extremophiles is always growing. For example, microbial life lives in the liquid [[asphalt]] lake, [[Pitch Lake]]. Research indicates that extremophiles inhabit the asphalt lake in populations ranging between 10<sup>6</sup> to 10<sup>7</sup> cells/gram.<ref>[http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/25051/ Microbial Life Found in Hydrocarbon Lake.] ''the physics arXiv blog'' 15 April 2010.</ref><ref>Schulze-Makuch, Haque, Antonio, Ali, Hosein, Song, Yang, Zaikova, Beckles, Guinan, Lehto, Hallam.

== Industrial uses ==
The thermoalkaliphilic [[catalase]], which initiates the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water, was isolated from an organism, ''[[Thermus brockianus]]'', found in [[Yellowstone National Park]] by [[Idaho National Laboratory]] researchers. The catalase operates over a temperature range from 30&nbsp;°C to over 94&nbsp;°C and a pH range from 6-10. This catalase is extremely stable compared to other  catalases at high temperatures and pH. In a comparative study, the ''T. brockianus'' catalase exhibited a half life of 15 days at 80&nbsp;°C and pH 10 while a catalase derived from ''[[Aspergillus niger]]'' had a half life of 15 seconds under the same conditions. The catalase will have applications for removal of hydrogen peroxide in industrial processes such as pulp and paper bleaching, textile bleaching, food pasteurization, and surface decontamination of food packaging.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt/community/idaho_national_laboratory_biological_systems/352/bioenergy_and_industrial_microbiology/2660 |title=Bioenergy and Industrial Microbiology |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |website=Idaho National Laboratory |accessdate=3 February 2014}}</ref>

Extracellular membrane vesicles (MVs) might be involved in DNA transfer between different hyperthermophilic archaeal species.<ref name=Gaudin_viral>{{cite journal|title=Extracellular membrane vesicles harbouring viral genomes|journal=Environ Microbiol|volume=16|issue=4|pages=1167–75|year=2014|doi=10.1111/1462-2920.12235|pmid=24034793|author=Gaudin M, Krupovic M, Marguet E, Gauliard E, Cvirkaite-Krupovic V, Le Cam E, Oberto J, Forterre P|last2=Krupovic|last3=Marguet|last4=Gauliard|last5=Cvirkaite-Krupovic|last6=Le Cam|last7=Oberto|last8=Forterre}}</ref> It has been shown that both plasmids<ref>{{cite journal|title=Hyperthermophilic archaea produce membrane vesicles that can transfer DNA|journal=Environ Microbiol Rep|year=2013|volume=5|issue=1|pages=109–16|pmid=23757139|author=Gaudin M, Gauliard E, Schouten S, Houel-Renault L, Lenormand P, Marguet E, Forterre P.|doi=10.1111/j.1758-2229.2012.00348.x|last2=Gauliard|last3=Schouten|last4=Houel-Renault|last5=Lenormand|last6=Marguet|last7=Forterre}}</ref> and viral genomes<ref name="Gaudin_viral" /> can be transferred via MVs. Notably, a horizontal plasmid transfer has been documented between hyperthermophilic ''[[Thermococcus]]'' and ''[[Methanocaldococcus]]'' species, respectively belonging to the orders ''Thermococcales'' and ''Methanococcales''.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Insights into dynamics of mobile genetic elements in hyperthermophilic environments from five new Thermococcus plasmids|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2013|volume=8|issue=1|pages=e49044|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0049044|pmid=23326305|author=Krupovic M, Gonnet M, Hania WB, Forterre P, Erauso G|pmc=3543421|last2=Gonnet|last3=Hania|last4=Forterre|last5=Erauso|bibcode = 2013PLoSO...849044K }}</ref>
