Another French inventor named Douglas Grasso had a failed prototype of Pierre Lallement's bicycle several years earlier. Several inventions followed using rear-wheel drive, the best known being the rod-driven velocipede by Scotsman<space/><link><target>Thomas McCall</target></link><space/>in 1869.

This design, referred to as a<space/><italics><link><target>step-through frame</target></link></italics><space/>or as an<space/><italics>open frame</italics>, allows the rider to mount and dismount in a dignified way while wearing a skirt or dress. While some women's bicycles continue to use this frame style, there is also a variation, the<space/><italics><link><target>mixte</target></link></italics>, which splits the top tube laterally into two thinner top tubes that bypass the seat tube on each side and connect to the rear fork ends. The ease of stepping through is also appreciated by those with limited flexibility or other joint problems. Because of its persistent image as a &quot;women's&quot; bicycle, step-through frames are not common for larger frames.</paragraph><paragraph>Step-throughs were popular partly for practical reasons and partly for social mores of the day. For most of the history of bicycles' popularity women have worn long skirts, and the lower frame accommodated these better than the top-tube. Furthermore, it was considered &quot;unladylike&quot; for women to open their legs to mount and dismount - in more conservative times women who rode bicycles at all were vilified as immoral or immodest. These practices were akin to the older practice of riding horse<space/><link><target>sidesaddle</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Another style is the recumbent bicycle. These are inherently more aerodynamic than upright versions, as the rider may lean back onto a support and operate pedals that are on about the same level as the seat.

Since the late 1930s alloy steels have been used for frame and fork tubes in higher quality machines. By the 1980s aluminum welding techniques had improved to the point that aluminum tube could safely be used in place of steel.

Most bicycles use a chain to transmit power to the rear wheel. A very small number of bicycles use a shaft drive to transmit power, or special belts. Hydraulic bicycle transmissions have been built, but they are currently inefficient and complex.</paragraph><paragraph>Since cyclists' legs are most efficient over a narrow range of pedaling speeds, or<space/><link><target>Cadence (cycling)</target><part>cadence</part></link>, a variable<space/><link><target>gear ratio</target></link><space/>helps a cyclist to maintain an optimum pedalling speed while covering varied terrain. Some, mainly utility, bicycles use hub gears with between 3 and 14 ratios, but most use the generally more efficient drailleur system, by which the chain is moved between different cogs called chainrings and sprockets in order to select a ratio. A drailleur system normally has two drailleurs, or mechs, one at the front to select the<space/><link><target>chainring</target></link><space/>and another at the back to select the sprocket. Most bikes have two or three chainrings, and from 5 to 11 sprockets on the back, with the number of theoretical gears calculated by multiplying front by back. In reality, many gears overlap or require the chain to run diagonally, so the number of usable gears is fewer.</paragraph><paragraph>An alternative to chaindrive is to use a synchronous belt. These are toothed and work much the same as a chain - popular with commuters and long distance cyclists they require little maintenance. They can't be shifted across a cassette of sprockets, and are used either as single speed or with a hub gear.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Bicycle gearing</target><part>Different gears and ranges of gears</part></link><space/>are appropriate for different people and styles of cycling. Multi-speed bicycles allow gear selection to suit the circumstances: a cyclist could use a high gear when cycling downhill, a medium gear when cycling on a flat road, and a low gear when cycling uphill. In a lower gear every turn of the pedals leads to fewer rotations of the rear wheel. This allows the energy required to move the same distance to be distributed over more pedal turns, reducing fatigue when riding uphill, with a heavy load, or against strong winds. A higher gear allows a cyclist to make fewer pedal turns to maintain a given speed, but with more effort per turn of the pedals.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Dsb-1.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>A<space/><link><target>Shaft-driven bicycle</target><part>bicycle with shaft drive</part></link><space/>instead of a chain</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>With a<space/><italics>chain drive</italics><space/>transmission, a<space/><italics>chainring</italics><space/>attached to a crank drives the chain, which in turn rotates the rear wheel via the rear sprocket(s) (<link><target>cassette (bicycle part)</target><part>cassette</part></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>Cogset#Freewheels</target><part>freewheel</part></link>). There are four gearing options: two-speed hub gear integrated with chain ring, up to 3 chain rings, up to 11 sprockets, hub gear built into rear wheel (3-speed to 14-speed).

Mountain bikes generally feature a 'straight handlebar' or 'riser bar' with varying degrees of sweep backwards and centimeters rise upwards, as well as wider widths which can provide better handling due to increased leverage against the wheel.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:San marco selle1.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>A Selle San Marco saddle designed for women</part></link><link><target>Bicycle saddle</target><part>Saddles</part></link><space/>also vary with rider preference, from the cushioned ones favored by short-distance riders to narrower saddles which allow more room for leg swings. Comfort depends on riding position. With comfort bikes and hybrids, cyclists sit high over the seat, their weight directed down onto the saddle, such that a wider and more cushioned saddle is preferable. For racing bikes where the rider is bent over, weight is more evenly distributed between the handlebars and saddle, the hips are flexed, and a narrower and harder saddle is more efficient. Differing saddle designs exist for male and female cyclists, accommodating the genders' differing anatomies, although bikes typically are sold with saddles most appropriate for men.</paragraph><paragraph>A recumbent bicycle has a reclined<space/><link><target>Bicycle seat</target><part>chair-like seat</part></link><space/>that some riders find more comfortable than a saddle, especially riders who suffer from certain types of seat, back, neck, shoulder, or wrist pain.

Track riders are still able to slow down because all track bicycles are fixed-gear, meaning that there is no freewheel. Without a freewheel, coasting is impossible, so when the rear wheel is moving, the cranks are moving. To slow down, the rider applies resistance to the pedals, acting as a braking system which can be as effective as a conventional rear wheel brake, but not as effective as a front wheel brake.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url"><space/>http://www.sheldonbrown.com/fixed.html
