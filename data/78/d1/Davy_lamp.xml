The screen acts as a<space/><link><target>flame arrestor</target></link>; air (and any firedamp present) can pass through the mesh freely enough to support combustion, but the holes are too fine to allow a flame to propagate through them and ignite any firedamp outside the mesh. It originally burned a heavy vegetable oil.</paragraph><paragraph>The lamp also provided a test for the presence of gases. If flammable gas mixtures were present, the flame of the Davy lamp burned higher with a blue tinge. Lamps were equipped with a metal gauge to measure the height of the flame. Miners could place the safety lamp close to the ground to detect gases, such as<space/><link><target>carbon dioxide</target></link>, that are denser than air and so could collect in depressions in the mine; if the mine air was oxygen-poor (<link><target>asphyxiant gas</target></link>), the lamp flame would be extinguished (<italics><link><target>black damp</target></link></italics><space/>or<space/><italics>chokedamp</italics>). A methane-air flame is extinguished at about 17% oxygen content (which will still support life), so the lamp gave an early indication of an unhealthy atmosphere, allowing the miners to get out before they died of asphyxiation.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Impact</heading><paragraph>The introduction of the Davy lamp led to an increase in mine accidents, as the lamp encouraged the working of mines and parts of mines that had previously been closed for safety reasons.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Lawrence"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Men continued to work in conditions which were unsafe due to the presence of methane gas. Although extractor ventilation fans should have been installed to reduce the concentration of methane in the air, this would have been expensive for mine owners, and thus such fans were not installed. A legal requirement<template><target>when</target><arg name="date">January 2012</arg></template><space/>for minimum air-quality standards eventually led to the introduction of more ventilation. The lamps also had to be provided by the miners themselves, not the owners, as traditionally the miners bought their own candles from the company store.</paragraph><paragraph>Another reason for the increase in accidents was the unreliability of the lamps themselves. The bare gauze was easily damaged, and once just a single wire broke or rusted away, the lamp became unsafe. Even when new and clean, illumination from the safety lamps was very poor, and the problem was not fully resolved until electric lamps became widely available in the late 19th century.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Successors</heading><paragraph>A modern-day equivalent of the Davy lamp is the Protector Garforth GR6S flame safety lamp which is used for firedamp testing in all<space/><link><target>UK</target></link><space/>coal mines.
