The essential principle of the French pot-au-feu was beef ; the essential principle of the Spanish was [[bacon]], [[ham]], the red Estremadura [[sausage]] — all well smoked ... The [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|Duc de St. Simon]] sent home marvellous accounts of the hams of [[Montánchez|Montanches]]; there grew up a rage for [[Jamón ibérico|Spanish hams]]; and the French were not to blame, for they have no hams of their own which have any reputation. Great as they are in pig's flesh, they are poor hands at bacon and ham; and the treasures of Montanches were a revelation to them. They ran wild after ham ... And so, by introducing the flavour of the [[Extremadura|Estremadura]] bacon and ham into the old brown sauce of the French, there came into being the Spanish sauce ... The hams of Montanches are not too plentiful in this world of sorrow, and the cooks came to be satisfied with any ham — even with French ham, which is little better than salted pork. So the meaning of the prescription was lost; the peculiarity of the Spanish sauce passed away, and its name became a puzzle.<ref>E.S.Dallas (1877), ''Kettner's Book of the Table'', Dullau and Co., London, digitized by Google, retrieved 2008</ref></arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>(The name<space/><italics>Kettner</italics><space/>in the title refers to<space/><link><target>Auguste Kettner</target></link>, former chef to<space/><link><target>Napoleon III</target></link>, who emigrated to England and in 1867 opened a restaurant in<space/><link><target>Soho</target></link>&amp;ndash;<link type='external' href='http://www.kettners.com/'>''Kettner's''</link>&amp;ndash; one of the oldest restaurants in London.)</paragraph><heading level='2'>Preparation</heading><paragraph>The basic method of making espagnole is to prepare a very dark brown<space/><link><target>roux</target></link>, to which<space/><link><target>veal</target></link><space/><link><target>stock (food)</target><part>stock</part></link><space/>or water is added, along with browned bones, pieces of<space/><link><target>beef</target></link>,<space/><link><target>vegetable</target><trail>s</trail></link>, and various<space/><link><target>seasoning</target><trail>s</trail></link>.
