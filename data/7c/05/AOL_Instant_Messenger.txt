'''AOL Instant Messenger''' ('''AIM''') is an [[instant messaging]] and [[presence information|presence]] [[computer program]] which uses the [[proprietary software|proprietary]] [[OSCAR protocol|OSCAR instant messaging protocol]] and the [[TOC protocol]] to allow registered users to communicate in real time.

==History==
AOL Instant Messenger was released by [[America Online]] (AOL) in May 1997.<ref name="mashable">Abbruzzese, Jason. [http://mashable.com/2014/04/15/aim-history/ "The Rise and Fall of AIM, the Breakthrough AOL Never Wanted"]. [[Mashable]].com. 2014-04-05.</ref> Stand-alone official AIM client software includes advertisements and is available for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Windows Mobile]], [[Mac OS]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]], [[BlackBerry OS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://products.aim.com/products |title=Products AIM |publisher=Products AIM |date= |accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref> The software, maintained by AOL, Inc., at one time had the largest share of the instant messaging market in North America, especially in the [[United States]] (with 52% of the total reported {{as of|2006|lc=y}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigblueball.com/forums/general-other-im-news/34413-im-market-share.html |title=IM Market Share - BigBlueBall Forums |publisher=Bigblueball.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101030030304/http://www.bigblueball.com/forums/general-other-im-news/34413-im-market-share.html| archivedate= 30 October 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> This does not include other instant messaging software related to or developed by AOL, such as [[ICQ]] and [[iChat]].

===Usage decline===
{{As of|June 2011}}, one source reported AOL Instant Messenger market share had collapsed to 0.73%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opswat.com/sites/default/files/OPSWAT-Market-Share-Report-June-2011.pdf|title=OPSWAT Market Share Report June 2011 |publisher=opswat.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-11}}</ref> However, this number only reflects installed IM applications, and not active users. The engineers responsible for AIM claimed that they were unable to convince AOL management that free was the future.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Rise and Fall of AIM, the Breakthrough AOL Never Wanted|url=http://mashable.com/2014/04/15/aim-history/|website=Mashable}}</ref>

==Protocol==
The standard protocol that AIM clients use to communicate is called [[OSCAR protocol|Open System for CommunicAtion in Realtime]] (OSCAR). Most AOL-produced versions of AIM and popular third party AIM clients use this protocol. However, AOL also created a simpler protocol called [[TOC2 protocol|TOC]] that lacks many of OSCAR's features but is sometimes used for clients that only require basic chat functionality. The TOC/TOC2 protocol specifications were made available by AOL, while OSCAR is a closed protocol that third parties have had to reverse-engineer.

In January 2008, AOL introduced experimental [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol]] (XMPP) support for AIM,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://florianjensen.com/2008/01/17/aol-adopting-xmpp-aka-jabber/|title=AOL adopting XMPP aka Jabber|date=2008-01-17|accessdate=2008-01-17|author=Florian Jensen| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080120143857/http://florianjensen.com/2008/01/17/aol-adopting-xmpp-aka-jabber/| archivedate= 20 January 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> allowing AIM users to communicate using the standardized, open-source XMPP. However, in March 2008, this service was discontinued.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} As of May 2011, AOL offers limited XMPP support.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aim.com/xmpp|title=AOL XMPP Gateway|date=2011-05-14|accessdate=2011-05-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110522092331/http://www.aim.com/xmpp| archivedate= 22 May 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}} {{Dead link|date=July 2013}}</ref>

==Privacy==
For privacy regulations, AIM has strict age restrictions. AIM accounts are available only for people over the age of 13;  children younger than that are not permitted access to AIM.<ref name="6 Facts About AIM's Privacy Policy">{{cite web|url=http://im.about.com/od/promotingimsafety/a/aim-privacy.htm|title=AIM Privacy -- Terms of Service Policy -- AIM Privacy|author=Brandon De Hoyos|work=About.com Tech|accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref>

Under the AIM Privacy Policy, AOL has no rights to read or monitor any private communications between users. The profile of the user has no privacy.<ref name="6 Facts About AIM's Privacy Policy"/>

If public content is accessed. it can be used for online, print or even broadcast advertising. etc. This is outlined in the policy and terms of service: "... you grant AOL, its parent, affiliates, subsidiaries, assigns, agents and licensees the irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide right to reproduce, display, perform, distribute, adapt and promote this Content in any medium". This allows anything one posts to be used without a separate request for permission.<ref name="6 Facts About AIM's Privacy Policy"/>

The issue of AIM's security has been called into question. AOL states that it has taken great steps to insure that personal information will not be accessed by unauthorized members, but that it cannot guarantee that that will not happen.<ref name="6 Facts About AIM's Privacy Policy"/>

AIM is different from other clients, such as [[Yahoo! Messenger]], in that it does not require approval from one buddy to be added to another's buddy list. As a result, it is possible for users to keep other unsuspecting users on their buddy list to see when they are online, read their status and away messages, and read their profiles. In fact, there is a Web API to display one's status and away message as a widget on one's Web page.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dev.aol.com/data_sheets/WebAIM_Quick_Start_Guide.pdf |title=Integrate Your Site with AIM in 3 Easy Steps |work=AOL Developer Network |publisher=AOL Inc |page=2 |format=PDF |accessdate=9 August 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110726062640/http://dev.aol.com/data_sheets/WebAIM_Quick_Start_Guide.pdf| archivedate= 26 July 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> However, one can block another user from communicating and seeing one's status, but this does not prevent the user from creating a new account that is not blocked and therefore can still track the first user's status. A more complete privacy option is to select a menu option allowing communication only with those on one's buddy list; this causes blocking (thus appearing offline to) all users who are not on one's buddy list.

==Chat robots==
AOL and various other companies supply robots on AIM that can receive messages and send a response based on the bot's purpose. For example, bots can help with studying, like StudyBuddy. Some are made to relate to children and teenagers, like [[Spleak]], others give advice, and others are for more general purposes, such as [[SmarterChild]]. The more useful chat bots have features like the ability to play games, get sport scores, weather forecasts or financial stock information. Users were able to talk to automated chat bots that could respond to natural human language. They were primarily put into place as a marketing strategy and for unique advertising options.  It was used by advertisers to market products or build better consumer relations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/aol-tries-out-new-im-chat-bot/ tries out new IM chat bot |publisher=CNET |date=2003-01-27 |accessdate=2015-10-27}}</ref>

Before the inclusions of such bots, the other bots DoorManBot and AIMOffline provided features that are provided today by AOL for those who needed it. [[ZolaOnAOL]] and [[ZoeOnAOL]] were short lived bots that ultimately retired their features in favor of [[SmarterChild]]. As of November 18, 2008, the [[SmarterChild]] bot for AIM was retired and is no longer offering any services.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==URI scheme==
AOL Instant Messenger's installation process automatically installs an extra [[URI scheme]] ("protocol") handler into some Web browsers, so URIs beginning "<tt>aim:</tt>" can open a new AIM window with specified parameters. This is similar in function to the <tt>mailto:</tt> URI scheme, which creates a new e-mail message using the system's default mail program. For instance, a Web page might include a link like the following in its HTML source to open a window for sending a message to the AIM user ''notarealuser'':
 <code>&lt;a href="aim:goim?screenname=notarealuser"&gt;Send Message&lt;/a&gt;</code>

To specify a message body, the <code>message</code> parameter is used, so the link location might look like this:
 <code>aim:goim?screenname=notarealuser&message=This+is+my+message</code>

To specify an away message, the message parameter is used, so the link location might look like this:
 <code>aim:goaway?message=Hello,+my+name+is+Bill</code>
When placing this inside a URL link, an AIM user could click on the URL link and the away message "Hello, my name is Bill" would instantly become their away message.

To add a buddy, the addbuddy message is used, with the screenname parameter
 <code>aim:addbuddy?screenname=notarealuser</code>
This type of link is commonly found on forum profiles, to easily add contacts

==Vulnerabilities==
AIM has security weaknesses that have enabled [[exploit (computer security)|exploits]] to be created that use third-party software to perform malicious acts on users' computers.<ref name="fileforum.betanews.com">{{cite web|url=http://fileforum.betanews.com/detail/AOL-Instant-Messenger-for-Windows/929853714/1|title=Reviews of AOL Instant Messenger for Windows|date=2011-01-08|accessdate=2012-03-28}}</ref> Although most are relatively harmless, such as being kicked off the AIM service, others perform potentially dangerous actions such as sending [[computer virus|viruses]]. Some of these exploits rely on [[social engineering (computer security)|social engineering]] to spread by automatically sending instant messages that contain a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] accompanied by text suggesting the receiving user click on it, an action which leads to infection. These messages can easily be mistaken as coming from a friend and contain a link to a Web address that installs software on the user's computer to restart the cycle.

Users have also reported sudden additions of toolbars and advertisements from third parties in the newer version of AIM. Multiple complaints about the lack of control of third party involvement have caused many users to stop using the service.<ref name="fileforum.betanews.com"/>

==Extra features==

===IPhone application===
On March 6, 2008, during [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[iPhone SDK]] event, AOL announced that they would be releasing an AIM application for [[iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch]] users. The application is available for free from the App Store, but the company also provides a paid version, which displays no advertisements. Both are available from the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]. The AIM client for [[iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch]] supports standard AIM accounts as well as [[MobileMe]] accounts.  There is also an express version of AIM accessible through the [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] browser on the iPhone and iPod Touch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macrumors.com/2008/03/06/apple-releases-iphone-sdk-demos-spore-instant-messaging/ |title=Apple Releases iPhone SDK, Demos Spore, Instant Messaging |publisher=Mac Rumors |date=2008-03-06 |accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref>

In 2011 AOL launched a massive overhaul of their Instant Messaging service. Included in the update was a brand new [[iOS]] application for [[iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch]] which incorporated all the latest features.  A brand new icon was used for the application, featuring the new cursive logo for AIM.  The user-interface was entirely redone for the features including: a new buddy list, group messaging, in-line photos and videos, as well as improved file-sharing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2396491,00.asp/ |title=AOL Overhauls AIM, Adds New iPhone App |publisher=PC Magazine |date=2011-11-16 |accessdate=2012-03-25}}</ref>

Currently the application is in version 5.0.5, which was updated as of March 2012.  In the latest iteration, it supports more social stream features, much like Facebook and Twitter, as well as the ability to send voice messages up to 60 seconds long.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://handheld.softpedia.com/get/Chat/AIM-for-iPhone-97755.shtml/ |title=AIM for iPhone 5.0.5 |publisher=Softpedia |date=2012-03-20 |accessdate=2012-03-25}}</ref>

===iPad application===
On April 3, 2010 Apple released the first generation iPad. Along with this newly released device AOL released the AIM application for iPad. It was built entirely from scratch for the new version iOS with a specialized user-interface for the device. It supports geo location, Facebook status updates and chat, MySpace, Twitter, YouTube, Foursquare and many social networking platforms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macstories.net/ipad/aim-for-ipad-approved-screenshot/ |title=AIM for iPad Approved, Screenshot |publisher=MacStories |date=2010-04-01 |accessdate=2012-03-25}}</ref>

===AIM Express===
AIM Express runs in a pop-up browser window. It is intended for use by people who are unwilling or unable to install a standalone application or those at computers that lack the AIM application. AIM Express supports many of the standard features included in the stand-alone client, but does not provide advanced features like file transfer, audio chat, video conferencing, or buddy info. It is implemented in [[Adobe Flash]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aim.com/products/express |title=www.aim.com/products/express |publisher=Aim.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101205062532/http://www.aim.com/products/express| archivedate= 5 December 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> It is an upgrade to the prior AOL Quick Buddy, which was later available for older systems that cannot handle Express before being discontinued. Express and Quick Buddy are similar to [[MSN Messenger#MSN Web Messenger|MSN Web Messenger]] and [[Yahoo! Messenger#Web Messenger|Yahoo! Web Messenger]].

===AIM Pages===
{{Main|AIM Pages}}
AIM Pages was released in May 2006, allowing the 63 million AIM users to create an online, dynamic profile. The buddy list serves as the basis for the AIM Page [[social networking service]]. An AIM Page is built using modules following the ModuleT [[microformat]]. AIM Pages was discontinued in late 2007.

===AIM for Mac===
AOL released an all-new AIM for the [[Macintosh]] on September 29, 2008 and the final build on December 15, 2008. The redesigned AIM for Mac is a full [[universal binary]] [[Cocoa API]] application that supports both Tiger and Leopard – [[Mac OS X]] 10.4.8 (and above) or Mac OS X 10.5.3 (and above). On October 1, 2009, AOL released AIM 2.0 for Mac.

===AIM real-time IM===
This feature is available for AIM 7 and allows for a user to see what the other is typing as it is being done. It was developed and built with assistance from Trace Research and Development Centre at [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] and [[Gallaudet University]]. The application provides visually impaired users the ability to convert messages from text (words) to speech.<ref name="What is Real-Time IM">[http://help.aol.com/help/microsites/microsite.do?cmd=displayKC&externalId=223568 What is Real-Time IM?]</ref> For the application to work users must have AIM 6.8 or higher, as it is not compatible with older versions of AIM software, AIM for Mac or iChat.<ref name="What is Real-Time IM"/>

===AIM to mobile (messaging to phone numbers)===
This feature allows [[text messaging]] to a phone number ([[messaging#Increasing competition|text messaging is less functional]] than instant messaging).<ref>{{cite web|title=How-To use AOL Instant Messenger to send a Text Message to a phone|url=http://www.engadget.com/2004/07/13/how-to-use-aol-instant-messenger-to-send-a-text-message-to-a|website=engadget.com|date=13 July 2004}}</ref>

==Discontinued features==

===AIM for Phoneline===
AIM Phoneline was a [[Voice over IP]] PC-PC, PC-Phone and Phone-to-PC service<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,1194787,00.html|title=Press Releases|publisher=|accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref> provided via the AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) application. It was also known to work with Apple's iChat Client.

Launched on May 16, 2006, AIM Phoneline provided users the ability to have several local numbers, allowing AIM users to receive free incoming calls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://labnol.blogspot.ca/2006/05/aim-phoneline-free-phone-number-for.html|title=AIM Phoneline: Free Phone number for AOL Messenger users|publisher=|accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref> The service allowed users to make calls to landlines and moblie devices through the use of a computer. The service, however, was only free for receiving and AOL charged users $14.95 a month for unlimited calling plan.<ref name="pcworld.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/126005/first_look_aim_phoneline_and_skype_25.html|title=First Look: AIM Phoneline and Skype 2.5|date=19 June 2006|work=PCWorld|accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref>

In order to use AIM Phoneline users had to install the latest free version of AIM Triton software and needed a good set of headphones with a boom microphone. It could take several days after a user signed up before it started working.<ref name="pcworld.com"/>

The service provided users with many interfaces such as Auto Action APIs, Ringback Tone APIs and Screen Name Services API that made the AIM Phoneline a great service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.programmableweb.com/api/aim-phoneline|title=AIM Phoneline|work=ProgrammableWeb|accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref>

On January 13, 2009, the service was officially closed. The closing of the free service  caused the number associated with the service to be disabled and not transferrable for a different service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r21456143-Free-AIM-Phoneline-Service-Closing-on-January-13-2009|title=Free AIM Phoneline Service Closing on January 13, 2009 - VOIP Tech Chat - DSLReports Forums|publisher=|accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref>

===AIM Call Out===
AIM Call Out is a discontinued [[Voice over IP]] PC-PC, PC-Phone and Phone-to-PC service provided by AOL via its AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) application that replaced the defunct AIM Phoneline service in November 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aimphoneline.com/?promo=784114&flv=1&ncid=oyjqUzrKfk0000000465&icid=one_click.M|title=Looking for AIM Phoneline?|publisher=Aimphoneline.com|accessdate=2008-10-02}}</ref> It did not depend on the AIM client and could be used with only an AIM screenname via the WebConnect feature or a dedicated SIP device. The AIM Call Out service was shut down on March 25, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voice.aol.com/|title=AOL Voice Services no longer offers new registrations |website=AOL.com|accessdate=2014-12-18}}</ref>

==Security==

On November 4, 2014, AIM scored 1 out of 7 points on the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]'s secure messaging scorecard. AIM received a point for encryption during transit but lost points because communications are not encrypted with a key the provider doesn't have access to (i.e. the communications are not [[End-to-end encryption|end-to-end encrypted]]), users can't verify contacts' identities, past messages are not secure if the encryption keys are stolen (i.e. the service does not provide [[forward secrecy]]), the code is not open to independent review (i.e. the code is not [[Open-source software|open-source]]), the security design is not properly documented, and there has not been a recent independent security audit.<ref name="secure-messaging-scorecard">{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/secure-messaging-scorecard |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |title=Secure Messaging Scorecard.
