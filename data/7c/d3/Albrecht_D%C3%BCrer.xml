After a few years of school, Drer started to learn the basics of goldsmithing and drawing from his father. Though his father wanted him to continue his training as a goldsmith, he showed such a precocious talent in drawing that he started as an apprentice to<space/><link><target>Michael Wolgemut</target></link><space/>at the age of fifteen in 1486. A self-portrait, a drawing in<space/><link><target>silverpoint</target></link>, is dated 1484 (<link><target>Albertina, Vienna</target></link>) &quot;when I was a child,&quot; as his later inscription says. Wolgemut was the leading artist in Nuremberg at the time, with a large workshop producing a variety of works of art, in particular woodcuts for books. Nuremberg was then an important and prosperous city, a centre for publishing and many luxury trades. It had strong links with Italy, especially<space/><link><target>Venice</target></link>, a relatively short distance across the<space/><link><target>Alps</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Bartrum"></extension><link><target>File:Albrecht-self.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part></part><part>upright0.1</part><part>The earliest painted ''<link><target>Portrait of the Artist Holding a Thistle (Albrecht Drer)</target><part>Self-Portrait</part></link>'' (1493) by Albrecht Drer, oil, originally on<space/><link><target>vellum</target></link><space/>(<link><target>Louvre</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Paris</target></link>)</part></link></paragraph><heading level='2'><italics>Wanderjahre</italics><space/>and marriage (149094)</heading><paragraph>After completing his term of apprenticeship, Drer followed the common German custom of taking<space/><italics><link><target>Wanderjahre</target></link></italics>in effect<space/><link><target>gap year</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>in which the apprentice learned skills from artists in other areas; Drer was to spend about four years away.

It is unclear where Drer travelled in the intervening period, though it is likely that he went to<space/><link><target>Frankfurt</target></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>Netherlands</target></link>. In Colmar, Drer was welcomed by Schongauer's brothers, the goldsmiths Caspar and Paul and the painter Ludwig. In 1493 Drer went to<space/><link><target>Strasbourg</target></link>, where he would have experienced the sculpture of<space/><link><target>Nikolaus Gerhaert</target></link>. Drer's first painted self-portrait (now in the<space/><link><target>Louvre</target></link>) was painted at this time, probably to be sent back to his fiance in Nuremberg.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Bartrum"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>In early 1492 Drer travelled to<space/><link><target>Basel</target></link><space/>to stay with another brother of Martin Schongauer, the goldsmith Georg.<extension extension_name='ref'>Here he produced a woodcut of<space/><link><target>St Jerome</target></link><space/>as a frontispiece for Nicholaus Kessler's 'Epistolare beati Hieronymi'.

Panofsky:21</extension><space/>Very soon after his return to Nuremberg, on 7 July 1494, at the age of 23, Drer was married to Agnes Frey following an arrangement made during his absence. Agnes was the daughter of a prominent brass worker (and amateur harpist) in the city.

(1903)<space/><italics>Albrecht Drer</italics>, Methuen &amp; co.</extension><space/>His best works in the first years of the workshop were his<space/><link><target>woodcut</target></link><space/>prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as<space/><italics>The Men's Bath House</italics><space/>(ca. 1496). These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition.</paragraph><paragraph>It is now thought unlikely that Drer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman. However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters. Drer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself, or glued a paper drawing to the block. Either way, his drawings were destroyed during the cutting of the block.<link><target>File:Albrecht Drer - Portrait of Oswolt Krel - WGA6934.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>Portrait of Oswolt Krel, a merchant from<space/><link><target>Lindau</target></link><space/>(<link><target>Lake Constance</target></link>), participating in the South German medieval trade corporation Groe<space/><link><target>Ravensburg</target><trail>er</trail></link><space/>Handelsgesellschaft, 1499.</part></link>His famous series of sixteen great designs for the<space/><italics>Apocalypse<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.payer.de/christentum/apokalypse.htm'>Johannesapokalypse in klassischen Comics</link></extension></italics><space/>is dated 1498, as is his engraving of<italics><space/><link><target>St. Michael Fighting the Dragon-Albrecht Durer</target><part>St. Michael Fighting the Dragon</part></link></italics>.

Around 15031505 he produced the first seventeen of a set illustrating the<space/><italics><link><target>Life of the Virgin</target></link></italics>, which he did not finish for some years. Neither these, nor the<space/><italics>Great Passion,</italics><space/>were published as sets until several years later, but prints were sold individually in considerable numbers.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Bartrum"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>During the same period Drer trained himself in the difficult art of using the<space/><link><target>Burin (tool)</target><part>burin</part></link><space/>to make engravings. It is possible he had begun learning this skill during his early training with his father, as it was also an essential skill of the goldsmith. In 1496 he executed the<space/><italics>Prodigal Son</italics>, which the Italian Renaissance art historian<space/><link><target>Giorgio Vasari</target></link><space/>singled out for praise some decades later, noting its Germanic quality. He was soon producing some spectacular and original images, notably<space/><italics>Nemesis</italics><space/>(1502),<space/><italics>The Sea Monster</italics><space/>(1498), and<space/><italics>Saint Eustace</italics><space/>(c. 1501), with a highly detailed landscape background and animals. His landscapes of this period, such as<space/><italics>Pond in the Woods</italics><space/>and<space/><italics>Willow Mill</italics>, are quite different from his earlier watercolours. There is a much greater emphasis on capturing atmosphere, rather than depicting topography. He made a number of<space/><link><target>Madonna (art)</target><part>Madonna</part><trail>s</trail></link>, single religious figures, and small scenes with comic peasant figures. Prints are highly portable and these works made Drer famous throughout the main artistic centres of Europe within a very few years.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Bartrum"></extension><link><target>File:Albrecht Drer Betende Hnde.jpg</target><part>upright</part><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>''<link><target>Praying Hands (Drer)</target><part>Praying Hands</part></link>'', a pen-and-ink drawing made circa 1508</part></link>The Venetian artist<space/><link><target>Jacopo de' Barbari</target></link>, whom Drer had met in Venice, visited Nuremberg in 1500, and Drer said that he learned much about the new developments in<space/><link><target>perspective (graphical)</target><part>perspective</part></link>,<space/><link><target>anatomy</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Body proportions</target><part>proportion</part></link><space/>from him.

He was also familiar with the 'abbreviated construction' as described by Alberti and the geometrical construction of shadows, a technique of<space/><link><target>Leonardo da Vinci</target></link>. Although Drer made no innovations in these areas, he is notable as the first Northern European to treat matters of visual representation in a scientific way, and with understanding of Euclidean principles.

The first book was mainly composed by 1512/13 and completed by 1523, showing five differently constructed types of both male and female figures, all parts of the body expressed in fractions of the total height. Drer based these constructions on both<space/><link><target>Vitruvius</target></link><space/>and empirical observations of, &quot;two to three hundred living persons,&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="Panofsky"></extension><space/>in his own words. The second book includes eight further types, broken down not into fractions but an<space/><link><target>Leone Battista Alberti</target><part>Albertian</part></link><space/>system, which Drer probably learned from<space/><link><target>Francesco di Giorgio</target></link>'s 'De harmonica mundi totius' of 1525. In the third book, Drer gives principles by which the proportions of the figures can be modified, including the mathematical simulation of<space/><link><target>convex mirror</target><part>convex</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>concave mirror</target><trail>s</trail></link>; here Drer also deals with human<space/><link><target>physiognomy</target></link>. The fourth book is devoted to the theory of movement.</paragraph><paragraph>Appended to the last book, however, is a self-contained essay on aesthetics, which Drer worked on between 1512 and 1528, and it is here that we learn of his theories concerning 'ideal beauty'. Drer rejected Alberti's concept of an objective beauty, proposing a relativist notion of beauty based on variety. Nonetheless, Drer still believed that truth was hidden within nature, and that there were rules which ordered beauty, even though he found it difficult to define the criteria for such a code. In 1512/13 his three criteria were function ('Nutz'), nave approval ('Wohlgefallen') and the happy medium ('Mittelmass'). However, unlike Alberti and Leonardo, Drer was most troubled by understanding not just the abstract notions of beauty but also as to how an artist can create beautiful images. Between 1512 and the final draft in 1528, Drer's belief developed from an understanding of human creativity as spontaneous or<space/><link><target>artistic inspiration</target><part>inspired</part></link><space/>to a concept of 'selective inward synthesis'.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Panofsky"></extension><space/>In other words, that an artist builds on a wealth of visual experiences in order to imagine beautiful things. Drer's belief in the abilities of a single artist over inspiration prompted him to assert that &quot;one man may sketch something with his pen on half a sheet of paper in one day, or may cut it into a tiny piece of wood with his little iron, and it turns out to be better and more artistic than another's work at which its author labours with the utmost diligence for a whole year.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>Panofsky:283</extension><table style='border-collapse: collapse;
