Since the 1980s, many practitioners and organizations have adopted the motto (originally from the statement of purpose of GMSMAa gay SM activist organization) &quot;safe, sane and consensual&quot;, commonly abbreviated as &quot;SSC&quot;, which means that everything is based on safe activities, that all participants be of sufficiently sound/sane mind to consent, and that all participants do consent.<extension extension_name='ref'>Bill Henkin, Sybil Holiday: Consensual Sadomasochism : How to Talk About It and How to Do It Safely, Page 64, Publisher: Daedalus Publishing Company 2006, ISBN 978-1-881943-12-9</extension><space/>It is mutual consent that makes a clear legal and ethical distinction between BDSM and such crimes as sexual assault or<space/><link><target>domestic violence</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url"><space/>http://sexsupport.org/abusevsere.html</arg><arg name="title"><space/>VICSS / Difference between Abuse and Power Exchange by the NLA, Dutch SM Media Information Center and Powerrotics</arg><arg name="accessdate"><space/>10 December 2007</arg><arg name="archiveurl"><space/>https://web.archive.org/web/20071216091307/http://sexsupport.org/abusevsere.html</arg><arg name="archivedate"><space/>16 December 2007<space/></arg><arg name="deadurl"><space/>no</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Some BDSM practitioners prefer a code of behavior that differs from &quot;SSC&quot; and is described as &quot;risk aware consensual kink&quot; (RACK), indicating a preference for a style in which the<space/><italics>individual</italics><space/>responsibility of the involved parties is emphasized more strongly, with each participant being responsible for his or her own well-being. Advocates of RACK argue that SSC can hamper discussion of risk because no activity is truly &quot;safe&quot;, and that discussion of even low-risk possibilities is necessary for truly informed consent. They further argue that setting a discrete line between &quot;safe&quot; and &quot;not-safe&quot; activities ideologically denies consenting adults the right to evaluate risks vs rewards for themselves; that some adults will be drawn to certain activities regardless of the risk; and that BDSM playparticularly higher-risk play or<space/><link><target>edgeplay</target></link>should be treated with the same regard as extreme sports, with both respect and the demand that practitioners educate themselves and practice the higher-risk activities to decrease risk.

The consent and compliance for a sadomasochistic situation can be granted only by people who can judge the potential results. For their consent, they must have relevant information (extent to which the scene will go, potential risks, if a safeword will be used, what that is, and so on) at hand and the necessary mental capacity to judge. The resulting consent and understanding is occasionally summarized in a written &quot;<link><target>Contract (BDSM)</target><part>contract</part></link>&quot;, which is an agreement of what can and cannot take place.<extension extension_name='ref'>Dossie Easton, Janet W.

Failure to honor a safeword is considered serious misconduct and could even change the sexual consent situation into a crime, depending on the relevant law,<extension extension_name='ref' name="sm101"></extension><space/>since the bottom has explicitly revoked his or her consent to any actions that follow the use of the safeword (see<space/><link><target>BDSM#Legal status</target><part>Legal status</part></link>). For other scenes, particularly in established relationships, a safeword may be agreed to signify a warning (&quot;this is getting too intense&quot;) rather than explicit withdrawal of consent; and a few choose not to use a safeword at all. This is sometimes the case for &quot;punishment scenes&quot; between master/slave couples or for some extreme or edgeplay scenes which may include abductions, rape play, or interrogation. This scene dynamic may be referred to as &quot;consensual nonconsent&quot;. In some scenes or relationships it may be impossible for consent to be withdrawn in the middle of a scene, or the bottom may have the ability to revoke consent for a relationship as a whole, but not for a particular scene.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Terminology and subtypes</heading><paragraph>The initialism<space/><italics>BDSM</italics><space/>includes psychological and physiological facets:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>Bondage and Discipline (<italics>B&amp;D</italics>)</listitem><listitem>Dominant and submissive (<italics>D/s</italics>)</listitem><listitem>Sadism and Masochism (or sadomasochism) (<italics>S&amp;M</italics>)</listitem><listitem>Master and slave (<italics>M/s</italics>)</listitem></list><paragraph>This model for differentiating among these aspects of BDSM is increasingly used in literature today.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Terms"></extension><space/>Nevertheless, it is only an attempt at phenomenological differentiation.

For some, taking on a role of compliance or helplessness offers a form of therapeutic escape; from the stresses of life, from responsibility, or from guilt. For others, being under the power of a strong, controlling presence may evoke the feelings of safety and protection associated with childhood. They likewise may derive satisfaction from earning the approval of that figure<space/><italics>(see:<space/><link><target>Servitude (BDSM)</target></link>)</italics>. A sadist, on the other hand, may enjoy the feeling of power and authority that comes from playing the dominant role, or receive pleasure vicariously through the suffering of the masochist.

During the phase of the &quot;coming-out&quot;, self questioning related to one's own &quot;normality&quot; is quite common. According to Moser, the discovery of BDSM preferences<space/><italics>can</italics><space/>result in fear of the current non-BDSM relationship's destruction. This, combined with the fear of discrimination in everyday life, leads in some cases to a double life which can be highly burdensome. At the same time, the denial of BDSM preferences can induce stress and dissatisfaction with one's own &quot;vanilla&quot;-lifestyle, feeding the apprehension of finding no partner. Moser states that BDSM practitioners having problems finding BDSM partners would probably have problems in finding a non-BDSM partner as well. The wish to remove BDSM preferences is another possible reason for psychological problems since it is not possible in most cases. Finally, the scientist states that BDSM practitioners seldom commit violent crimes. From his point of view, crimes of BDSM practitioners usually have no connection with the BDSM components existing in their life. Moser's study comes to the conclusion that there is no scientific evidence, which could give reason to refuse members of this group work- or safety certificates, adoption possibilities, custody or other social rights or privileges. The Swiss psychoanalyst Fritz Morgenthaler shares a similar perspective in his book,<space/><italics>Homosexuality, Heterosexuality, Perversion</italics><space/>(1988). He states that possible problems result not necessarily from the non-normative behavior, but in most cases primarily from the real or feared reactions of the social environment towards their own preferences.<extension extension_name='ref'>Fritz Morgenthaler:<space/><italics>Homosexuality, Heterosexuality, Perversion</italics>, Analytic, April 1988, ISBN 978-0-88163-060-2</extension><space/>In 1940 psychoanalyst<space/><link><target>Theodor Reik</target></link><space/>reached implicitly the same conclusion in his standard work<space/><italics>Aus Leiden Freuden.

Roy Baumeister (2010) actually had more male masochists in his study than female, and fewer male dominants than female. The fact that neither of these gender differences were significant, suggests no assumptions should be made regarding gender and masochistic roles in BDSM. One explanation why we might think otherwise lies in our social and cultural ideals about<space/><link><target>femininity</target></link>; masochism may emphasize certain stereotypically feminine elements through activities like<space/><link><target>Feminization (activity)</target><part>feminization</part></link><space/>of men and ultra-feminine clothing for women.

Trends also suggested that male masochism included more bondage and oral sex than female (though the data was not significant). Female masochists, on the other hand, experienced greater: frequency in pain, pain as punishment for 'misdeeds' in the relationship context, display humiliation, genital intercourse, and presence of non-participating audiences. The exclusiveness of dominant males in a heterosexual relationship should be noted because, historically, men in power preferred multiple partners. Finally, Baumeister (2010) observes a contrast between the 'intense sensation' focus of male masochism to a more 'meaning and emotion' centred female masochistic script.<extension extension_name='ref' name="a4"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Prior argues that although some of these women may appear to be engaging in traditional subordinate or submissive roles, BDSM allows women in both dominant and submissive roles to express and experience personal power through their sexual identities. In a study that she conducted in 2013, she found that the majority of the women she interviewed identified as bottom, submissive, captive, or slave. In turn, Prior was able to answer whether or not these women found an incongruity between their sexual identities and feminist identity. Her research found that these women saw little to no incongruity, and in fact felt that their feminist identity supported identities of submissive and slave. For them these are sexually and emotionally fulfilling roles and identities that, in some cases, feed other aspects of their lives. Prior contends that third wave feminism provides a space for women in BDSM communities to express their sexual identities fully, even when those identities seem counter-intuitive to the ideals of feminism. Furthermore, women, who do identify as submissive, sexually or otherwise, find a space within BDSM where they can fully express themselves, as integrated, well-balanced, and powerful, women.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite journal</target><arg name="last1">Prior</arg><arg name="first1">Emily</arg><arg name="title">Women's Perspectives of BDSM Power Exchange</arg><arg name="journal">Electronic Journal of Human Sexuality</arg><arg name="date">2013</arg><arg name="volume">16</arg><arg name="url">http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id</arg><arg name="accessdate">4 March 2015</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='4'>Women in S/M culture</heading><paragraph>Levitt, Moser, &amp; Jamison's 1994 study provides a general, if outdated, description of characteristics of women in the sadomasochistic (S/M) subculture.

The reasoning behind this is that 'coming-out' had become primarily the territory of the gay and lesbian, with bisexuals feeling the push to be one or the other (and being right only half the time either way). What he found in 2001, was that people in BDSM were open to discussion about the topic of bisexuality and pansexuality and all controversies they bring to the table, but personal biases and issues stood in the way of actively using such labels. A decade later, Lenius (2011) looks back on his study and considers if anything has changed. He concluded that the standing of bisexuals in the BDSM and kink community was unchanged, and believed that positive shifts in attitude were moderated by society's changing views towards different sexualities and orientations. But Lenius (2011) does emphasize that the pansexual promoting BDSM community helped advance greater acceptance of alternative sexualities.<extension extension_name='ref'>Lenius, S. (2001).

However it has also been argued (Deleuze,<space/><italics>Coldness and Cruelty</italics>) that the concurrence of sadism and masochism in Freud's model should not be taken for granted.</paragraph><paragraph>Freud introduced the terms &quot;primary&quot; and &quot;secondary&quot; masochism. Though this idea has come under a number of interpretations, in a primary masochism the masochist undergoes a complete, not just a partial, rejection by the model or courted object (or sadist), possibly involving the model taking a rival as a preferred mate. This complete rejection is related to the death drive (<italics>todestrieb</italics>) in Freud's psychoanalysis. In a secondary masochism, by contrast, the masochist experiences a less serious, more feigned rejection and punishment by the model. Secondary masochism, in other words, is the relatively casual version, more akin to a charade, and most commentators are quick to point out its contrivedness.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">November 2014</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Rejection is not desired by a primary masochist in quite the same sense as the feigned rejection occurring within a mutually consensual relationshipor even where the masochist happens to be the one having actual initiative power (this is the confusion of the distinctions of casual appearance and discrete motives which underlies the analyses of Deleuze and Sartre, for example).<template><target>OR</target><arg name="date">November 2014</arg></template><space/>In<space/><italics><link><target>Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World</target></link></italics>,<space/><link><target>Ren Girard</target></link><space/>attempts to resuscitate and reinterpret Freud's distinction of primary and secondary masochism, in connection with his own philosophy.</paragraph><paragraph>Both Krafft-Ebing and Freud assumed that sadism in men resulted from the distortion of the aggressive component of the male sexual instinct. Masochism in men, however, was seen as a more significant aberration, contrary to the nature of male sexuality. Freud doubted that masochism in men was ever a primary tendency, and speculated that it may exist only as a transformation of sadism. Sadomasochism in women received comparatively little discussion, as it was believed that it occurred primarily in men. Both also assumed that masochism was so inherent to female sexuality that it would be difficult to distinguish as a separate inclination.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">November 2014</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Havelock Ellis</target></link>, in<space/><italics>Studies in the Psychology of Sex</italics>, argued that there is no clear distinction between the aspects of sadism and masochism, and that they may be regarded as complementary emotional states. He also made the important point that sadomasochism is concerned only with pain in regard to sexual pleasure, and not in regard to cruelty, as Freud had suggested. In other words, the sadomasochist generally desires that the pain be inflicted or received in love, not in abuse, for the pleasure of either one or both participants. This mutual pleasure may even be essential for the satisfaction of those involved.</paragraph><paragraph>Here, Ellis touches upon the often paradoxical nature of widely reported consensual S&amp;M practices. It is described as not simply pain to initiate pleasure, but violence&quot;or the simulation of involuntary violent acts&quot;said to express love. This irony is highly evident in the observation by many, that not only are popularly practiced sadomasochistic activities usually performed at the express request of the masochist, but that it is often the designated masochist who may direct such activities, through subtle emotional cues perceived or mutually understood and consensually recognized by the designated sadist.</paragraph><paragraph>In his essay<space/><italics>Coldness and Cruelty</italics>, (originally<space/><italics>Prsentation de Sacher-Masoch</italics>, 1967)<space/><link><target>Gilles Deleuze</target></link><space/>rejects the term &quot;sadomasochism&quot; as artificial, especially in the context of the quintessentially modern masochistic work, Sacher-Masoch's<space/><italics>Venus In Furs</italics>. Deleuze's counterargument is that the tendency toward masochism is based on intensified desire brought on or enhanced by the acting out of frustration at the delay of gratification. Taken to its extreme, an intolerably indefinite delay is 'rewarded' by punitive perpetual delay, manifested as unwavering coldness. The masochist derives pleasure from, as Deleuze puts it, the &quot;Contract&quot;: the process by which he can control another individual and turn the individual into someone cold and callous. The sadist, in contrast, derives pleasure from the &quot;Law&quot;: the unavoidable power that places one person below another. The sadist attempts to destroy the<space/><link><target>Id, ego, and super-ego#Ego</target><part>ego</part></link><space/>in an effort to unify the<space/><link><target>Id, ego, and super-ego#Id</target><part>id</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Id, ego, and super-ego#Super-ego</target><part>super-ego</part></link>, in effect gratifying the most base desires the sadist can express while ignoring or completely suppressing the will of the ego, or of the conscience. Thus, Deleuze attempts to argue that masochism and sadism arise from such different impulses that the combination of the two terms is meaningless and misleading. A masochist's perception of their own self-subjugating sadistic desires and capacities are treated by Deleuze as reactions to prior experience of sadistic objectification. {E.g. in terms of psychology, compulsively defensive appeasement of pathological guilt feelings as opposed to the volition of a strong free will.} The epilogue of<space/><italics>Venus In Furs</italics><space/>shows the character of Severin has become embittered by his experiment in the alleged control of masochism, and advocates instead the domination of women.<template><target>OR</target><arg name="date">November 2014</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Before Deleuze, however,<space/><link><target>Sartre</target></link><space/>had presented his own theory of sadism and masochism, at which Deleuze's deconstructive argument, which took away the symmetry of the two roles, was probably directed. Because the pleasure or power in looking at the victim figures prominently in sadism and masochism, Sartre was able to link these phenomena to his famous philosophy of the &quot;Look of the Other&quot;. Sartre argued that masochism is an attempt by the &quot;For-itself&quot; (consciousness) to reduce itself to nothing, becoming an object that is drowned out by the &quot;abyss of the Other's subjectivity&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref'>Jean-Paul Sartre,<space/><italics><link><target>Being and Nothingness</target></link></italics></extension><space/>By this Sartre means that, given that for the &quot;for-itself&quot; desire to attain a point of view in which it is both subject and object, one possible strategy is to gather and intensify every feeling and posture in which the self appears as an object to be rejected, tested, and humiliated; and in this way the for-itself strives toward a point of view in which there is only one subjectivity in the relationship, which would be both that of the abuser and the abused. Conversely, Sartre held sadism to be the effort to annihilate the subjectivity of the victim. That means that the sadist is exhilarated by the emotional distress of the victim because they seek a subjectivity that views the victim as both subject and object.</paragraph><paragraph>This argument may appear stronger if it is understood that this &quot;look of the other&quot; theory is either only an aspect of the faculties of desire, or somehow its primary faculty. This does not account for the turn that Deleuze took for his own theory of these matters, but the premise of &quot;desire as 'look'&quot; is associated with theoretical distinctions always detracted by Deleuze, in what he regarded as its essential error to recognize &quot;desire as lack&quot;which he identified in the philosophical temperament of Plato, Socrates, and<space/><link><target>Jacques Lacan</target><part>Lacan</part></link>. For Deleuze, insofar as desire is a lack it is reducible to the &quot;look&quot;.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">November 2014</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Finally, after Deleuze,<space/><link><target>Ren Girard</target></link><space/>included his account of sado-masochism in<space/><italics>Things Hidden Since the Foundation of The World</italics>, originally<space/><italics>Des choses caches depuis la fondation du monde</italics>, 1978, making the chapter on masochism a coherent part of his theory of<space/><link><target>mimetic desire</target></link>. In this view of sado-masochism, the violence of the practices are an expression of a peripheral rivalry that has developed around the actual love-object. There is clearly a similarity to Deleuze, since both in the violence surrounding the memory of mimetic crisis and its avoidance, and in the resistance to affection that is focused on by Deleuze, there is an understanding of the value of the love object in terms of the processes of its valuation, acquisition and the test it imposes on the suitor.<template><target>OR</target><arg name="date">November 2014</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='3'>Clinical issues</heading><paragraph>Nichols (2006) compiled some common clinical issues: countertransference, non-disclosure, coming-out, partner/families, and bleed-through.<extension extension_name='ref' name="a1">Nichols, M.

Despite having no evidence, therapists may find themselves believing that their clients pathology is &quot;self-evident&quot;. Therapists may feel intense disgust and aversive reactions. Feelings of countertransference can interfere with therapy. Another common problem is when clients conceal their sexual preferences from their therapists. This can compromise any therapy. To avoid non-disclosure, therapists are encouraged to communicate their openness in indirect ways with literatures and artworks in the waiting room. Therapists can also deliberately bring up BDSM topics during the course of therapy. With less informed therapists, sometimes they over-focus on clients sexuality which detracts from original issues such as family relationships, depression, etc. A special subgroup that needs counselling is the &quot;newbie&quot;. Individuals just coming out might have internalized shame, fear, and self-hatred about their sexual preferences. Therapists need to provide acceptance, care, and model positive attitude; providing reassurance,<space/><link><target>psychoeducation</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>bibliotherapy</target></link><space/>for these clients is crucial.

However, they may have married or had children by this point. Therefore, therapists need to facilitate couple's counselling and disclosure. It is important for therapists to consider fairness to partner and family of clients. In situations when boundaries between roles in the bedroom and roles in the rest of the relationship blurs, a &quot;bleed-through&quot; problem has occurred.

In this context though &quot;injury&quot; is legally defined as &quot;anything causing a condition of illness&quot;, and &quot;illness&quot; is ill-defined itself in two different legal ways. The first is &quot;any anatomical or functional alteration of the organism&quot; (thus technically including little scratches and bruises too); The second is &quot;a significant worsening of a previous condition relevant to organic and relational processes, requiring any kind of therapy&quot;. This could make it somewhat risky to play with someone as later the &quot;victim&quot; may call foul play citing even an insignificant mark as evidence against the partner.
