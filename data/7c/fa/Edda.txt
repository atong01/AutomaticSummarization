The term "'''Edda'''" ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|d|ə}}; [[Old Norse]] ''Edda'',  plural ''Eddur'') applies to the [[Old Norse]] ''[[Prose Edda]]'' and has been adapted to fit the collection of poems known as the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' which lacks an original title. Both works were written down in [[medieval Iceland|Iceland]] during the 13th century in Icelandic, although they contain material from earlier traditional sources, reaching into the [[Viking Age]]. The books are the main sources of medieval [[skald]]ic tradition in Iceland and [[Norse mythology]].

==Etymology==
There are several theories concerning the origins of the word ''edda''. One theory holds that it is identical to a word that means "great-grandmother" appearing in the Eddic poem ''Rígsþula.''<ref>Snorri Sturluson.  ''The Prose Edda: Tales from Norse Mythology'', translated by Jean I. Young (University of California Press, 1964), p. 8.</ref> Another theory holds that ''edda'' derives from Old Norse ''óðr'', "poetry".  A third, proposed in 1895 by Eiríkr Magnússon, is that it derives from the Icelandic place name ''[[Oddi]]'', site of the church and school where students, including [[Snorri Sturluson]], were educated.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Liberman | first1 = Anatoly | year = 1996 | title = Ten Scandinavian and North English Etymologies | url = | journal = Alvíssmál | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 63–98 }}</ref> A fourth hypothesis—the derivation of the word ''Edda'' as the name of Snorri Sturluson’s treatise on poetry from the Latin ''edo'', "I compose (poetry)", by analogy with ''kredda'', "superstition", from Latin ''credo'', "creed"—is now widely accepted, though this acceptance may stem from its agreement with modern usage rather than historical accuracy.<ref>''Oxford Dictionary of the Middle Ages'' (2010) under "Snorri Sturluson"</ref> There is also suggestion from local Icelandic scholars that the Edda is the same Norse root as Sanskrit 'Vedas' meaning 'knowledge'.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

==The ''Poetic Edda''==
{{main|Poetic Edda}}
The ''Poetic Edda'', also known as ''Sæmundar Edda'' or the ''Elder Edda'', is a collection of [[Old Norse]] poems from the [[Iceland]]ic medieval [[manuscript]] [[Codex Regius]] ("Royal Book"). Along with the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', the ''Poetic Edda'' is the most expansive source on Norse mythology. The first part of the Codex Regius preserves poems that narrate the creation and foretold destruction and rebirth of the Old Norse mythological world as well as individual myths about gods concerning [[List of Germanic deities and heroes|Norse deities]]. The poems in the second part narrate legends about [[List of Germanic deities and heroes|Norse heroes and heroines]], such as [[Sigurd]], [[Brynhildr]] and [[Gunnar]].

The Codex Regius was written down in the 13th century but nothing was known of its whereabouts until 1643 when it came into the possession of [[Brynjólfur Sveinsson]], then the [[Church of Iceland]]'s Bishop of [[Skálholt]]. At that time, versions of the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' were well known in Iceland, but scholars speculated that there once was another ''Edda''—an ''Elder Edda''—which contained the [[Norse paganism|pagan]] poems Snorri quotes in his book. When the Codex Regius was discovered, it seemed that this speculation had proven correct. Brynjólfur attributed the manuscript to [[Saemund|Sæmundr the Learned]], a larger-than-life 12th century Icelandic priest. While this attribution is rejected by modern scholars, the name ''Sæmundar Edda'' is still sometimes encountered.

Bishop Brynjólfur sent the Codex Regius as a present to King [[Christian IV of Denmark]], hence the name ''Codex Regius''. For centuries it was stored in the [[Royal Library, Copenhagen|Royal Library]] in [[Copenhagen]] but in 1971 it was returned to Iceland.

==The ''Prose Edda''==
{{main|Prose Edda}}
The ''Prose Edda'', sometimes referred to as the ''Younger Edda'' or ''Snorri's Edda'' is an [[Iceland]]ic manual of poetics which also contains many mythological stories. Its purpose was to enable [[Iceland]]ic poets and readers to understand the subtleties of [[alliterative verse]], and to grasp the mythological allusions behind the many ''[[kenning]]s'' that were used in [[skaldic poetry]].

It was written by the Icelandic scholar and historian [[Snorri Sturluson]] around 1220. It survives in seven main manuscripts, written down from about 1300 to about 1600.

The ''Prose Edda'' consists of a [[Prologue (Prose Edda)|Prologue]] and three separate books: ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', concerning the creation and foretold destruction and rebirth of the Norse mythical world; ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'', a dialogue between [[Ægir]], a Norse god connected with the sea, and Bragi, the [[skald]]ic god of poetry; and ''[[Háttatal]]'', a demonstration of verse forms used in Norse mythology.
