When Orthodox theologians use the term &quot;deuterocanonical,&quot; it is important to note that the meaning is not identical to the Roman Catholic usage. In Orthodox Christianity, deuterocanonical means that a book is part of the corpus of the Old Testament (i.e. is read during the services) but has secondary authority. In other words, deutero (second) applies to authority or witnessing power, whereas in Roman Catholicism, deutero applies to chronology (the fact that these books were confirmed later), not to authority.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.orthodoxanswers.org/answer/39/'>Orthodox Answer To a Question About Apocrypha, Canon, Deuterocanonical Answer #39</link></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The Eastern Orthodox books of the Old Testament include the deuterocanonical books listed above, plus<space/><link><target>3 Maccabees</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>1 Esdras</target></link><space/>(also included in the<space/><link><target>Clementine Vulgate</target></link>), while Baruch is divided from the Epistle of Jeremiah, making a total of 49 Old Testament books in contrast with the<space/><link><target>Protestantism</target><part>Protestant</part></link><space/>39-book canon.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Kimbrough"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="author"><space/>S.
