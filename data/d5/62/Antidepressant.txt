'''Antidepressants''' are drugs used for the treatment of [[major depressive disorder]] and other conditions, including [[dysthymia]], [[anxiety disorder]]s, [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], [[eating disorder]]s, [[chronic pain]], [[neuropathic pain]] and, in some cases, [[dysmenorrhoea]], snoring, [[migraine]], [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[addiction]], [[substance dependence|dependence]], and [[sleep disorder]]s. They can be used alone or in combination with other medications but only when prescribed.

The most important classes of antidepressants are the [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs), [[serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors]] (SNRIs), [[tricyclic antidepressants]] (TCAs), [[monoamine oxidase inhibitors]] (MAOIs), [[RMAO-A inhibitor|reversible monoamine oxidase A inhibitors]] (rMAO-A inhibitors), [[tetracyclic antidepressant]]s (TeCAs), and [[noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant]] (NaSSAs).<ref name="SJW and rMAO-A inhibitors – 2015" /> [[Hypericum perforatum#Major depressive disorder|St John's wort]] is also used in the treatment of depression.<ref name="SJW and rMAO-A inhibitors – 2015" /><ref name="SJW Cochrane review">{{cite journal | author = Linde K, Berner MM, Kriston L | title = St John's wort for major depression | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = | issue = 4 | pages = CD000448 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18843608 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD000448.pub3 }}</ref>

==== Clinical guidelines ====

The UK [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) 2009 guidelines indicate that antidepressants should not be routinely used for the initial treatment of mild depression, because the risk-benefit ratio is poor. The guidelines recommend that antidepressant treatment should be considered for:
* People with a history of moderate or severe depression,
* Those with mild depression that has been present for a long period,
* As a second-line treatment for mild depression that persists after other interventions,
* As a first-line treatment for moderate or severe depression.

The guidelines further note that antidepressant treatment should be used in combination with psychosocial interventions in most cases, should be continued for at least 6 months to reduce the risk of relapse, and that SSRIs are typically better tolerated than other antidepressants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg90/chapter/key-priorities-for-implementation |title=Depression in adults: The treatment and management of depression in adults |work=NICE guidelines [CG90] |date=October 2009 |publisher=National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (UK) |accessdate=23 September 2015}}</ref>

[[American Psychiatric Association]] treatment guidelines recommend that initial treatment should be individually tailored based on factors that include severity of symptoms, co-existing disorders, prior treatment experience, and patient preference.  Options may include pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or light therapy.  Antidepressant medication is recommended as an initial treatment choice in people with mild, moderate, or severe major depression, and should be given to all patients with severe depression unless ECT is planned.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://psychiatryonline.org/content.aspx?bookID=28&sectionID=1667485#654260 |title=PsychiatryOnline &#124; APA Practice Guidelines &#124; Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Major Depressive Disorder, Third Edition |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==== Systematic Reviews ====

Conflicting results have arisen from studies analyzing the efficacy of antidepressants by comparisons to placebo in people with acute mild to moderate depression. Stronger evidence supports the usefulness of antidepressants in the treatment of depression that is chronic ([[dysthymia]]) or severe.

Researchers [[Irving Kirsch]] and Thomas Moore have contested the pharmacological activity of antidepressants in the relief of depression, and state that the evidence is most consistent a role as active [[placebo]]s.<ref name="administration2002">{{cite journal |title=The emperor's new drugs: An analysis of antidepressant medication data submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  |author = Kirsch I, Moore TJ, Scoboria A, Nicholls SS | journal = Prevention & Treatment | year = 2002 | volume = 5 | doi = 10.1037/1522-3736.5.1.523a }}</ref> Their study consisted of a meta analysis incorporating data from both published studies and unpublished data obtained from the FDA via a [[Freedom of Information Act]] request.

Another study focusing on paroxetine (Paxil) and imipramine found that antidepressant drugs were only slightly better than placebo in cases of mild or moderate depression they surveyed but offered "substantial" benefit in those with severe depression.<ref name="Fournier JC, DeRubeis RJ, Hollon SD, et al. 47–53">{{cite journal |author=Fournier JC, DeRubeis RJ, Hollon SD |title=Antidepressant drug effects and depression severity: a patient-level meta-analysis |journal=JAMA |volume=303 |issue=1 |pages=47–53 |date=January 2010  |pmid=20051569 |pmc=3712503 |doi=10.1001/jama.2009.1943 |url=|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

In 2014 the U.S. FDA published a systematic review of all antidepressant maintenance trials submitted to the agency between 1985 and 2012.  The authors concluded that maintenance treatment reduced the risk of relapse by 52% compared to placebo, and that this effect was primarily due to recurrent depression in the placebo group rather than a drug withdrawal effect.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Borges S, Chen YF, Laughren TP, Temple R, Patel HD, David PA, Mathis M, Unger E, Yang P, Khin NA |title=Review of maintenance trials for major depressive disorder: a 25-year perspective from the US Food and Drug Administration |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=75 |issue=3 |pages=205–14 |year=2014 |pmid=24717376 |doi=10.4088/JCP.13r08722 |url=}}</ref>

A review commissioned by the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] concluded that there is strong evidence that SSRIs have greater efficacy than placebo on achieving a 50% reduction in depression scores in moderate and severe major depression, and that there is some evidence for a similar effect in mild depression. The treatment guidelines developed in conjunction with this review suggest that antidepressants should be considered in patients with moderate to severe depression and those with mild depression that is persistent or resistant to other treatment modalities.<ref name="Depression in Adults update">{{cite web |title=Depression in Adults (update) |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/Depression_Update_FULL_GUIDELINE.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=www.nice.org.uk |work=National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health Commissioned by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence |accessdate=20 November 2013 |pages=282–292|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130612122946/http://www.nice.org.uk:80/nicemedia/pdf/Depression_Update_FULL_GUIDELINE.pdf |archivedate=12 June 2013 }}</ref>

The [[Cochrane Collaboration]] recently performed a systematic review of clinical trials of the [[tricyclic antidepressant]] [[amitriptyline]]. The study concluded that in spite of moderate evidence for publication bias, there is strong evidence that the efficacy of amitriptyline is superior to placebo.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Leucht C, Huhn M, Leucht S | title = Amitriptyline versus placebo for major depressive disorder | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 12 | pages = CD009138 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23235671 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD009138.pub2 | editor1-last = Leucht | editor1-first = C }}</ref>

A 2015 systematic review of add-on therapies for treatment-resistant depression concluded that [[quetiapine]] and [[aripiprazole]] have the strongest evidence-base supporting their efficacy, but they are associated with additional treatment-related side effects when used as an add-on therapy.<ref name="Adjunct therapy 2015">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhou X, Ravindran AV, Qin B, Del Giovane C, Li Q, Bauer M, Liu Y, Fang Y, da Silva T, Zhang Y, Fang L, Wang X, Xie P | title = Comparative efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability of augmentation agents in treatment-resistant depression: systematic review and network meta-analysis | journal = J Clin Psychiatry | volume = 76 | issue = 4 | pages = e487–98 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25919841 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.14r09204 | quote = Quetiapine and aripiprazole appear to be the most robust evidence-based options for augmentation therapy in patients with treatment-resistant depression }}</ref>

A 2008 Cochrane Collaboration review on [[St John's wort]] (specifically, any extracts which contain ''[[hypericum perforatum]]''), and a 2015 meta-analytic systematic review by some of the same authors, both concluded that it: has superior efficacy to placebo in treating depression; is as effective as standard antidepressant pharmaceuticals for treating depression; and has fewer adverse effects than other antidepressants. The 2015 meta analysis concluded that it is difficult to assign a place for St. John's wort in the treatment of depression owing to limitations in the available evidence base, including large variations in efficacy seen in trials performed in German-speaking relative to other countries.<ref name="SJW and rMAO-A inhibitors – 2015">{{cite journal | vauthors = Linde K, Kriston L, Rücker G, Jamila S, Schumann I, Meissner K, Sigterman K, Schneider A | title = Efficacy and acceptability of pharmacological treatments for depressive disorders in primary care: systematic review and network meta-analysis | journal = Ann Fam Med | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–79 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25583895 | pmc = 4291268 | doi = 10.1370/afm.1687 | quote = In network meta-analysis, tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), a serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI; venlafaxine), a low-dose serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor (SARI; trazodone) and hypericum extracts were found to be significantly superior to placebo, with estimated odds ratios between 1.69 and 2.03. There were no statistically significant differences between these drug classes. Reversible inhibitors of monoaminoxidase A (rMAO-As) and hypericum extracts were associated with significantly fewer dropouts because of adverse effects compared with TCAs, SSRIs, the SNRI, a noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (NRI), and noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant agents (NaSSAs).&nbsp;...  TCAs and SSRIs have the most solid evidence base. Further agents (hypericum, rMAO-As, SNRI, NRI, NaSSAs, SARI) showed some positive results, but limitations of the currently available evidence makes a clear recommendation on their place in clinical practice difficult.}}</ref><ref name="SJW Cochrane review" /> [[Reversible monoamine oxidase A inhibitor]]s (rMAO-A inhibitors) have also been shown to be an effective drug therapy with greater tolerability than other antidepressants;<ref name="SJW and rMAO-A inhibitors – 2015" /> however, the efficacy of SSRIs, tricyclic, and tetracyclic antidepressants in treating depression is supported by a much larger evidence base compared to other antidepressant drug therapies (i.e., St John's wort, rMAO-A inhibitors, [[serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]], [[serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor]]s, [[noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor]]s, and [[noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant]]s).<ref name="SJW and rMAO-A inhibitors – 2015" />

The 2013 Cochrane Collaboration review on [[physical exercise]] for depression noted that, based upon limited evidence, it is more effective than a control intervention and comparable to psychological or antidepressant drug therapies.<ref name="Cochrane exercise depression">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cooney GM, Dwan K, Greig CA, Lawlor DA, Rimer J, Waugh FR, McMurdo M, Mead GE | title = Exercise for depression | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = CD004366 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24026850 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub6 | quote = Exercise is moderately more effective than a control intervention for reducing symptoms of depression, but analysis of methodologically robust trials only shows a smaller effect in favour of exercise. When compared to psychological or pharmacological therapies, exercise appears to be no more effective, though this conclusion is based on a few small trials.}}</ref> Three subsequent 2014 systematic reviews that included the Cochrane review in their analysis concluded with similar findings: one indicated that that physical exercise is effective as an [[wikt:adjunct treatment|adjunct treatment]] with antidepressant medication;<ref name="Exercise MDD antidepressant">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mura G, Moro MF, Patten SB, Carta MG | title = Exercise as an add-on strategy for the treatment of major depressive disorder: a systematic review | journal = CNS Spectr | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 496–508 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24589012 | doi = 10.1017/S1092852913000953 | quote = Considered overall, the studies included in the present review showed a strong effectiveness of exercise combined with antidepressants.&nbsp;... Conclusions<br /> This is the first review to have focused on exercise as an add-on strategy in the treatment of MDD. Our findings corroborate some previous observations that were based on few studies and which were difficult to generalize.<sup>41,51,73,92,93</sup> Given the results of the present article, it seems that exercise might be an effective strategy to enhance the antidepressant effect of medication treatments. Moreover, we hypothesize that the main role of exercise on treatment-resistant depression is in inducing neurogenesis by increasing BDNF expression, as was demonstrated by several recent studies.}}</ref> the other two indicated that physical exercise has marked antidepressant effects and recommended the inclusion of physical activity as an adjunct treatment for mild–moderate depression<ref name="Exercise depression intervention">{{cite journal | vauthors = Josefsson T, Lindwall M, Archer T | title = Physical exercise intervention in depressive disorders: meta-analysis and systematic review | journal = Scand J Med Sci Sports | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 259–272 | year = 2014 | pmid = 23362828 | doi = 10.1111/sms.12050 | quote = Physical activity has also become increasingly and firmly associated with improvements in mental health and psychological well-being (Mutrie, 2000; Landers & Arent, 2007). In particular, exercise is believed to be effective in preventing depression and also to significantly reduce depressive symptoms in clinical as well as in nonclinical populations (O’Neal et al., 2000; Landers & Arent, 2007). Several correlational studies show that exercise is negatively related to depressive symptoms (e.g., Galper et al., 2006; Hassmén et al., 2000). Moreover, a considerably large number of intervention studies have by now investigated the effect of various exercise programs on depression and the vast majority of them indicate that exercise significantly reduces depression (e.g., Blumenthal et al., 2007; Martinsen et al., 1985; Singh et al., 1997).&nbsp;... To date, it is not possible to determine exactly how effective exercise is in reducing depression symptoms in clinical and nonclinical depressed populations, respectively. However, the results from the present meta-analysis as well as from seven earlier meta-analyses (North et al., 1990; Craft & Landers, 1998; Lawlor & Hopker, 2001; Stathopoulou et al., 2006; Mead et al., 2009; Rethorst et al., 2009; Krogh et al., 2011) indicate that exercise has a moderate to large antidepressant effect. Some meta-analytic results (e.g., Rethorst et al., 2009) suggest that exercise may be even more efficacious for clinically depressed people.&nbsp;... In short, our final conclusion is that exercise may well be recommended for people with mild and moderate depression who are willing, motivated, and physically healthy enough to engage in such a program.}}</ref> and mental illness in general.<ref name="Physical activity intervention">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosenbaum S, Tiedemann A, Sherrington C, Curtis J, Ward PB | title = Physical activity interventions for people with mental illness: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = J Clin Psychiatry | volume = 75 | issue = 9 | pages = 964–974 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24813261 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.13r08765 | quote = This systematic review and meta-analysis found that physical activity reduced depressive symptoms among people with a psychiatric illness.

Conclusion<br /> Few interventions exist whereby patients can hope to achieve improvements in both psychiatric symptoms and physical health simultaneously without significant risks of adverse effects.

Regular engagement in physical exercise enhances cognitive functioning, increases brain neurotrophic proteins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and prevents cognitive diseases [76–78]. Recent findings highlight a role for aerobic exercise in modulating chromatin remodelers [21, 79–82].&nbsp;... These results were the first to demonstrate that acute and relatively short aerobic exercise modulates epigenetic modifications. The transient epigenetic modifications observed due to chronic running training have also been associated with improved learning and stress-coping strategies, epigenetic changes and increased c-Fos-positive neurons&nbsp;... Nonetheless, these studies demonstrate the existence of epigenetic changes after acute and chronic exercise and show they are associated with improved cognitive function and elevated markers of neurotrophic factors and neuronal activity (BDNF and c-Fos).&nbsp;...

Studies have demonstrated the intensity of exercise training is positively correlated with BDNF plasma levels in young, healthy individuals (Ferris et al., 2007). Resistance exercise has also been shown to elevate serum BDNF levels in young individuals (Yarrow et al., 2010). Moreover, it has been shown that moderate levels of physical activity in people with AD significantly increased plasma levels of BDNF (Coelho et al., 2014).&nbsp;... In humans, it has been shown that 4 h of rowing activity leads to increased levels of plasma BDNF from the internal jugular (an indicator of central release from the brain) and radial artery (an indicator of peripheral release; Rasmussen et al., 2009). Seifert et al. (2010) reported that basal release of BDNF increases following 3 months endurance training in young and healthy individuals, as measured from the jugular vein. These trends are augmented by rodent studies showing that endurance training leads to increased synthesis of BDNF in the hippocampal formation (Neeper et al., 1995, 1996).&nbsp;... Both BDNF and IGF-1 play a significant role in cognition and motor function in humans.&nbsp;... Multiple large-scale studies in humans have shown that serum levels of IGF-1 are correlated with fitness and as well as body mass indices (Poehlman and Copeland, 1990). Furthermore, animal studies have shown that exercise in rats is associated with increased amounts of IGF-1 in the CSF. }}</ref><ref name="Organ response">{{cite journal | author = Heinonen I, Kalliokoski KK, Hannukainen JC, Duncker DJ, Nuutila P, Knuuti J | title = Organ-Specific Physiological Responses to Acute Physical Exercise and Long-Term Training in Humans | journal = Physiology  | volume = 29 | issue = 6 | pages = 421–436 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25362636 | doi = 10.1152/physiol.00067.2013 | quote = The Effects of Long-Term Exercise Training<br /> [A] physically active lifestyle has been shown to lead to higher cognitive performance and delayed or prevented neurological conditions in humans (71, 101, 143, 191).&nbsp;...

In the aftermath of the trial, the investigators have presented the results mainly using the secondary endpoint of remission according to the QIDS-SR16 Score, which tend to be somewhat higher.
* After the first course of treatment, 27.5% of the 2,876 participants reached remission with a HAM-D score of 7 or less and 33% achieved remission according to the QIDS-SR scale. The response rate according to the QIDS-SR16 score was 47%.

==== Limitations and strategies ====

Between 30% and 50% of individuals treated with a given antidepressant do not show a response.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Baghai TC, Möller HJ, Rupprecht R | title = Recent Progress in Pharmacological and Non-Pharmacological Treatment Options of Major Depression | journal = Current Pharmaceutical Design | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 503–15 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16472142 | doi = 10.2174/138161206775474422 }}</ref><ref name="SSRIswitch">{{cite journal | author = Ruhé HG, Huyser J, Swinkels JA, Schene AH | title = Switching Antidepressants After a First Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor in Major Depressive Disorder | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 67 | issue = 12 | pages = 1836–55 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17194261 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.v67n1203 }}</ref> In clinical studies, approximately one-third of patients achieve a full [[remission (medicine)|remission]], one-third experience a response and one-third are nonresponders. Partial remission is characterized by the presence of poorly defined residual symptoms. These symptoms typically include depressed mood, psychic anxiety, sleep disturbance, fatigue and diminished interest or pleasure. It is currently unclear which factors predict partial remission. However, it is clear that residual symptoms are powerful predictors of relapse, with relapse rates 3–6&nbsp;times higher in patients with residual symptoms than in those who experience full remission.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Tranter R, O'Donovan C, Chandarana P, Kennedy S | title = Prevalence and outcome of partial remission in depression | journal = Journal of Psychiatry & Neuroscience | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 241–7 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12174733 | pmc = 161658 }}</ref> In addition, antidepressant drugs tend to lose efficacy over the course of treatment.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Byrne SE, Rothschild AJ | title = Loss of Antidepressant Efficacy During Maintenance Therapy | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 59 | issue = 6 | pages = 279–88 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9671339 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.v59n0602 }}</ref> A number of strategies are used in clinical practice to try to overcome these limits and variations.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Mischoulon D, Nierenberg AA, Kizilbash L, Rosenbaum JF, Fava M | title = Strategies for managing depression refractory to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment: A survey of clinicians | journal = Canadian Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 45 | issue = 5 | pages = 476–81 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10900529 }}</ref> They include switching medication, augmentation, and combination.

==== "Trial and error" switching ====

The [[American Psychiatric Association]] 2000 Practice Guideline advises that where no response is achieved following six to eight weeks of treatment with an antidepressant, to switch to an antidepressant in the same class, then to a different class of antidepressant.
A 2006 meta-analysis review found wide variation in the findings of prior studies; for patients who had failed to respond to an SSRI antidepressant, between 12% and 86% showed a response to a new drug. However, the more antidepressants an individual had already tried, the less likely they were to benefit from a new antidepressant trial.<ref name="SSRIswitch" /> However, a later meta-analysis found no difference between switching to a new drug and staying on the old medication; although 34% of treatment resistant patients responded when switched to the new drug, 40% responded without being switched.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bschor T, Baethge C | title = No evidence for switching the antidepressant: Systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs of a common therapeutic strategy | journal = Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica | volume = 121 | issue = 3 | pages = 174–9 | year = 2010 | pmid = 19703121 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2009.01458.x }}</ref>

==== Augmentation and combination ====

For a partial response, the American Psychiatric Association guidelines suggest augmentation, or adding a drug from a different class. These include: [[Lithium (medication)|lithium]] and [[thyroid]] augmentation, [[dopamine agonists]], [[sex steroids]], [[Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor|NRIs]], [[glucocorticoid]]-specific agents, or the newer [[anticonvulsant]]s.<ref name="augment">{{cite journal | author = DeBattista C, Lembke A | title = Update on augmentation of antidepressant response in resistant depression | journal = Current Psychiatry Reports | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | pages = 435–40 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16318821 | doi = 10.1007/s11920-005-0064-x }}</ref>

A combination strategy involves adding another antidepressant, usually from a different class so as to have effect on other mechanisms. Although this may be used in clinical practice, there is little evidence for the relative efficacy or adverse effects of this strategy.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lam RW, Wan DD, Cohen NL, Kennedy SH | title = Combining Antidepressants for Treatment-Resistant Depression | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 63 | issue = 8 | pages = 685–93 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12197448 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.v63n0805 }}</ref> Other tests recently conducted include the use of [[psychostimulant]]s as an augmentation therapy. Several studies have shown the efficacy of combining [[modafinil]] to treatment-resistant patients. It has been used to help combat SSRI associated fatigue.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Goss AJ, Kaser M, Costafreda SG, Sahakian BJ, Fu CH | title=Modafinil augmentation therapy in unipolar and bipolar depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 74 | issue = 11 | pages = 1101–7| year = 2013 | pmid = 24330897 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.13r08560 }}</ref>

==== Long-term use ====

The therapeutic effects of antidepressants typically do not continue once the course of medication ends, resulting in a high rate of [[relapse]]. A recent [[meta-analysis]] of 31 placebo-controlled antidepressant trials, mostly limited to studies covering a period of one year, found that 18% of patients who had responded to an antidepressant relapsed while still taking it, compared to 41% whose antidepressant was switched for a [[placebo]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Geddes JR, Carney SM, Davies C, Furukawa TA, Kupfer DJ, Frank E, Goodwin GM | title = Relapse prevention with antidepressant drug treatment in depressive disorders: A systematic review | journal = The Lancet | volume = 361 | issue = 9358 | pages = 653–61 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12606176 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12599-8 }}</ref>

'''Where:'''

''For adverse effects/overdose toxicity''

4 means very strong effect/extreme toxicity.

3 strong effect; efficacious/high toxicity.

2 moderate effect/moderately toxic.

1 weak effect/weakly toxic.

v very weak/negligible effect

''For tolerability''

4 extremely tolerable. These drugs have proven to be better tolerated than the SSRIs.

3 very tolerable ? few, mild and transient side effects. These are drugs such as the [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors|SSRIs]].

2 moderately tolerable. Some of the more tolerable of TCAs.

1 poor tolerability. TCAs and MAOIs mostly.

''For efficacy''

3 Superior efficacy drug, according to at least one review article.

Metabolized into amphetamine analogues ''in vivo''. Can cause liver damage.<ref name="AMH" />

'''[[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs)'''

[[Citalopram]]:
Most likely of the SSRIs to prolong the [[QT interval]]. Also the most toxic SSRI in overdose.  Less hepatotoxic than most other antidepressants.<ref name = Hep /><br />
[[QT interval|QTc i. p.]]: 2 (dose dependent; doses >40&nbsp;mg/day are particularly dangerous)

[[Escitalopram]]:
The more active S-enantiomer of citalopram. May be the most efficacious of the SSRIs (although no statistically significant difference between the efficacy of sertraline and escitalopram have been teased out to date). Based on the available evidence it is less toxic than its racemic counterpart, (R,S)-citalopram, in overdose. Less hepatotoxic than most other antidepressants.<ref name = Hep />

[[Fluoxetine]]:
First SSRI to receive FDA approval in 1987. Some studies have shown slight (often statistically insignificant) weight reductions in those on fluoxetine. Has the longest net half-life (taking into account the effects of its active metabolite, [[norfluoxetine]]) of any antidepressant clinically used, and consequently, when abruptly stopped, withdrawal effects are usually mild and rare. Dermatologic reactions are more common than with sertraline.<ref name =Martindale />

[[Fluvoxamine]]:

[[Paroxetine]]:
Only SSRI that's not Australian pregnancy category C but is rather category D due to an increased risk of [[Persistent fetal circulation|Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn]]. The [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] of the US has placed it in category D. It is associated with a higher risk of sexual dysfunction, weight gain, anticholinergic side effects and drowsiness than the other SSRIs. Has a short half life compared to other SSRIs and hence is the most prone to causing withdrawal effects whenever a dose is missed.

=== Anxiety disorders ===

==== Generalized anxiety disorder ====
Antidepressants are recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for the treatment of [[generalized anxiety disorder]] (GAD) that has failed to respond to conservative measures such as education and self-help activities. GAD is a common disorder of which the central feature is excessive worry about a number of different events. Key symptoms include excessive anxiety about multiple events and issues, and difficulty controlling worrisome thoughts that persists for at least 6 months.

Antidepressants provide a modest-to-moderate reduction in anxiety in GAD,<ref name="urlwww.nice.org.uk">{{cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/13314/52599/52599.pdf |title=www.nice.org.uk |format= |work= |accessdate=20 February 2013}}</ref> and are superior to placebo in treating GAD.<ref name = Kapczinski>{{cite journal | author = Kapczinski F, Lima MS, Souza JS, Schmitt R | title = Antidepressants for generalized anxiety disorder | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume =  | issue = 2 | pages = CD003592 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12804478 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003592 | url =  | editor1-last = Kapczinski | editor1-first = Flavio FK }}</ref> The efficacy of different antidepressants is similar.<ref name="urlwww.nice.org.uk" /><ref name = Kapczinski />

==== Obsessive compulsive disorder ====
SSRIs are a second line treatment of adult [[obsessive compulsive disorder]] (OCD) with mild functional impairment and as first line treatment for those with moderate or severe impairment.  In children, SSRIs can be considered as a second line therapy in those with moderate-to-severe impairment, with close monitoring for psychiatric adverse effects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/cg031niceguideline.pdf |title=www.nice.org.uk |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> SSRIs are efficacious in the treatment of OCD; patients treated with SSRIs are about twice as likely to respond to treatment as those treated with placebo.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Arroll B, Elley CR, Fishman T, Goodyear-Smith FA, Kenealy T, Blashki G, Kerse N, Macgillivray S | title = Antidepressants versus placebo for depression in primary care | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume =  | issue = 3 | pages = CD007954 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19588448 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007954 | url =  | editor1-last = Arroll | editor1-first = Bruce }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/570825+ |title=Medscape Log In |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> Efficacy has been demonstrated both in short-term treatment trials of 6 to 24 weeks and in discontinuation trials of 28 to 52 weeks duration.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 22226028| year = 2012| author1 = Fineberg| first1 = N.

=== Eating disorders ===

Anti-depressants are recommended as an alternative or additional first step to self-help programs in the treatment of [[bulimia nervosa]].<ref name="urlwww.nice.org.uk2">{{cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG9FullGuideline.pdf |title=www.nice.org.uk |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>  SSRIs (fluoxetine in particular) are preferred over other anti-depressants due to their acceptability, tolerability, and superior reduction of symptoms in short term trials. Long term efficacy remains poorly characterized.  [[Bupropion]] is not recommended for the treatment of eating disorders due to an increased risk of seizure.<ref>http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a695033.html</ref>

Similar recommendations apply to [[binge eating disorder]].<ref name="urlwww.nice.org.uk2" /> SSRIs provide short term reductions in binge eating behavior, but have not been associated with significant weight loss.<ref name="urlNational Guideline Clearinghouse | Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with eating disorders.">{{cite web |url=http://www.guidelines.gov/content.aspx?id=9318+ |title=National Guideline Clearinghouse &#124; Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with eating disorders |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

=== Pain ===

==== Fibromyalgia ====

A 2012 meta analysis concluded that antidepressants treatment favorably affects pain, health-related quality of life, depression, and sleep in [[fibromyalgia]] syndrome.  Tricyclics appear to be the most effective class, with moderate effects on pain and sleep and small effects on fatigue and health-related quality of life. The fraction of people experiencing a 30% pain reduction on tricyclics was 48% vs 28% for placebo.  For SSRIs and SNRIs the fraction of people experiencing a 30% pain reduction was 36% (20% in the placebo comparator arms) and 42% (32% in the corresponding placebo comparator arms).

[[MAOIs]] tend to have pronounced (sometimes fatal) interactions with a wide variety of medications and [[over-the-counter drug]]s.

Although these reactions may be lethal, the total number of deaths due to interactions and dietary concerns is comparable to over-the-counter medications.-->

In response to these adverse effects, a different type of MAOI has been developed: the [[reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A]] (RIMA) class of drugs. Their primary advantage is that they do not require the person to follow a special diet, while being purportedly effective as SSRIs and tricyclics in treating depressive disorders.<ref name="pmid7717091">{{cite journal | author = Paykel ES | title = Clinical efficacy of reversible and selective inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A in major depression | journal = Acta Psychiatr Scand Suppl | volume = 386 | issue =  | pages = 22–7 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7717091 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1995.tb05920.x }}</ref>

=== Pregnancy ===

SSRI use in pregnancy has been associated with a variety of risks with varying degrees of proof of causation.  As depression is independently associated with negative pregnancy outcomes, determining the extent to which observed associations between antidepressant use and specific adverse outcomes reflects a causative relationship has been difficult in some cases.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Malm H | title = Prenatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and infant outcome | journal = Ther Drug Monit | volume = 34 | issue = 6 | pages = 607–14 |date=December 2012 | pmid = 23042258 | doi = 10.1097/FTD.0b013e31826d07ea | url =   }}</ref>  In other cases, the attribution of adverse outcomes to antidepressant exposure seems fairly clear.

Moreover, SSRIs inhibit nitric oxide synthesis, which plays an important role in setting vascular tone. Several studies have pointed to an increased risk of prematurity associated with SSRI use, and this association may be due to an increase risk of [[pre-eclampsia]] of pregnancy.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sivagnanam |first=G |title=Antidepressants |journal=Journal of Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapeutics |year=2012 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=287–8 |url=http://www.jpharmacol.com/text.asp?2012/3/3/287/99452}}</ref>

=== Antidepressant-induced mania ===
Another possible problem with antidepressants is the chance of antidepressant-induced mania in patients with [[bipolar disorder]]. Many cases of bipolar depression are very similar to those of unipolar depression. Therefore, the patient can be misdiagnosed with unipolar depression and be given antidepressants. Studies have shown that antidepressant-induced mania can occur in 20–40% of bipolar patients.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Goldberg JF, Truman CJ | title = Antidepressant-induced mania: An overview of current controversies | journal = Bipolar Disorders | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 407–20 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14636364 | doi = 10.1046/j.1399-5618.2003.00067.x }}</ref> For bipolar depression, antidepressants (most frequently SSRIs) can exacerbate or trigger symptoms of [[hypomania]] and [[mania]].<ref name="pmid9387089">{{cite journal | author = Benazzi F | title = Antidepressant-associated hypomania in outpatient depression: a 203-case study in private practice | journal = J Affect Disord | volume = 46 | issue = 1 | pages = 73–7 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9387089 | doi = 10.1016/S0165-0327(97)00082-7 }}</ref>

Antidepressant discontinuation symptoms were first reported with [[imipramine]], the first tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), in the late 1950s, and each new class of antidepressants has brought reports of similar conditions, including [[monoamine oxidase inhibitors]] (MAOIs), SSRIs, and SNRIs.

== Pharmacology ==
{{Main|Pharmacology of antidepressants}}
The earliest and probably most widely accepted scientific theory of antidepressant action is the [[monoamine hypothesis]] (which can be traced back to the 1950s), which states that depression is due to an imbalance (most often a deficiency) of the [[monoamine neurotransmitter]]s (namely [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]]).<ref name = GG /> It was originally proposed based on the observation that certain hydrazine anti-tuberculosis agents produce antidepressant effects, which was later linked to their inhibitory effects on [[monoamine oxidase]], the enzyme that catalyses the breakdown of the monoamine neurotransmitters.<ref name = GG /> All currently marketed antidepressants have the monoamine hypothesis as their theoretical basis, with the possible exception of [[agomelatine]] which acts on a dual [[Melatonin|melatonergic]]-[[Serotonin|serotonergic]] pathway.<ref name = GG /> Despite the success of the monoamine hypothesis it has a number of limitations: for one, all monoaminergic antidepressants have a delayed onset of action of at least a week; and secondly, there are a sizeable portion (>40%) of depressed patients that do not adequately respond to monoaminergic antidepressants.<ref name="Infl">{{cite journal | author = Maes M, Yirmyia R, Noraberg J, Brene S, Hibbeln J, Perini G, Kubera M, Bob P, Lerer B, Maj M | title = The inflammatory & neurodegenerative (I&ND) hypothesis of depression: leads for future research and new drug developments in depression | journal = Metabolic Brain Disease | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–53 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19085093 | doi = 10.1007/s11011-008-9118-1 }}</ref><ref name="glut">{{cite journal | author = Sanacora G, Treccani G, Popoli M | title = Towards a glutamate hypothesis of depression: an emerging frontier of neuropsychopharmacology for mood disorders | journal = Neuropharmacology | volume = 62 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–77 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 21827775 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2011.07.036 | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3205453/pdf/nihms318867.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = | pmc=3205453}}</ref>  A number of alternative hypotheses have been proposed, including the glutamate, neurogenic, [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]], cortisol hypersecretion and inflammatory hypotheses.<ref name = Infl /><ref name = glut /><ref name="Epig">{{cite journal | author = Menke A, Klengel T, Binder EB | title = Epigenetics, depression and antidepressant treatment | journal = Current Pharmaceutical Design | volume = 18 | issue = 36 | pages = 5879–5889 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22681167 | doi = 10.2174/138161212803523590 }}</ref><ref name="Epig2">{{cite journal | author = Vialou V, Feng J, Robison AJ, Nestler EJ | title = Epigenetic mechanisms of depression and antidepressant action | journal = Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology | volume = 53 | issue = 1 | pages = 59–87 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23020296 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-pharmtox-010611-134540 }}</ref>

== Adjuncts ==

Adjunct medications are an umbrella term used to describe substances that increase the potency or "enhance" antidepressants.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/psychiatric_disorders/mood_disorders/depressive_disorders.html?qt=depression&alt=sh#v1028590 |work=Merck Manual |title=Depressive Disorders |accessdate=30 November 2012|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131205163219/http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/psychiatric_disorders/mood_disorders/depressive_disorders.html?qt=depression&alt=sh |archivedate=5 December 2013 }}</ref> They work by affecting variables very close to the antidepressant, sometimes affecting a completely different [[mechanism of action]]. This may be attempted when depression treatments have not been successful in the past.

Common types of adjunct medication techniques generally fall into the following categories:
* Two or more antidepressants taken together
** From the same class (affecting the same area of the brain, often at a much higher level)
** From different classes (affecting multiple parts of the brain not covered simultaneously by either drug alone)
* An [[antipsychotic]] combined with an antidepressant, particularly [[atypical antipsychotic]]s such as [[aripiprazole]] (Abilify), [[quetiapine]] (Seroquel), [[olanzapine]] (Zyprexa), and [[risperidone]] (Risperdal).<ref name="Maudsley">{{cite book | name-list-format = vanc |last1=Taylor |first1=D |last2=Carol |first2=P |last3=Shitij |first3=K |title=The Maudsley prescribing guidelines in psychiatry |year=2012 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=West Sussex |isbn=978-0-470-97969-3}}</ref><!--first added https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antidepressant&diff=prev&oldid=576824896-->

However, the authors claim psychostimulants are likely to have a higher level of clinical effectiveness under circumstances in which the patient will probably die soon, so rapid relief is of great importance. In this situation, the patient is likely to die before dependence on, or tolerance of, the medication interferes with their care.

=== Isoniazid, iproniazid, and imipramine ===
In 1951, [[Irving Selikoff]] and Edward Robitzek, working out of Sea View Hospital on [[Staten Island]], began clinical trials on two new [[tuberculosis|anti-tuberculosis]] agents developed by Hoffman-LaRoche, [[isoniazid]] and [[iproniazid]]. Only patients with a poor [[prognosis]] were initially treated; nevertheless, their condition improved dramatically. Selikoff and Robitzek noted "a subtle general stimulation … the patients exhibited renewed vigor and indeed this occasionally served to introduce disciplinary problems."<ref name="pmid14906149">{{cite journal | author = Selikoff IJ, Robitzek EH | title = Tuberculosis Chemotherapy with Hydrazine Derivatives of Isonicotinic Acid | journal = CHEST Journal | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 385–438 | year = 1952 | pmid = 14906149 | doi = 10.1378/chest.21.4.385 }}</ref> The promise of a cure for tuberculosis in the Sea View Hospital trials was excitedly discussed in the mainstream press.

In 1952, learning of the stimulating side effects of isoniazid, the Cincinnati psychiatrist Max Lurie tried it on his patients. In the following year, he and Harry Salzer reported that isoniazid improved depression in two thirds of their patients and coined the term ''antidepressant'' to describe its action.<ref name="isbn0-88048-397-0">{{cite book | name-list-format = vanc |last=Healy |first=D |editor1-last=Weissman |editor1-first=M.M. |title=The treatment of depression: bridging the 21st century |url=http://books.google.com/?id=LAmBVolIG5kC |accessdate=28 May 2009 |year=2001 |publisher=American Psychiatric Pub |isbn=978-0-88048-397-1 |pages=10–11 |chapter=The Antidepressant Drama |chapterurl=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LAmBVolIG5kC&printsec=frontcover#PPA7,M1}}</ref> A similar incident took place in Paris, where Jean Delay, head of psychiatry at Sainte-Anne Hospital, heard of this effect from his [[pulmonology]] colleagues at Cochin Hospital.

The antidepressant effect of a [[tricyclic]], a three ringed compound, was first discovered in 1957 by [[Roland Kuhn]] in a Swiss [[psychiatric hospital]]. [[Antihistamine]] derivatives were used to treat surgical shock and later as [[neuroleptics]]. Although in 1955 [[reserpine]] was shown to be more effective than placebo in alleviating anxious depression, neuroleptics were being developed as [[sedatives]] and [[antipsychotics]].{{medical citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Attempting to improve the effectiveness of [[chlorpromazine]], Kuhn{{spaced ndash}} in conjunction with the [[Geigy]] [[Pharmaceutical Company]]{{spaced ndash}} discovered the compound "G 22355", later renamed [[imipramine]]. Imipramine had a beneficial effect in patients with depression who showed mental and [[motor retardation]]. Kuhn described his new compound as a "thymoleptic" "taking hold of the emotions," in contrast with neuroleptics, "taking hold of the nerves" in 1955–56. These gradually became established, resulting in the patent and manufacture in the US in 1951 by Häfliger and SchinderA.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kuhn R | title = The treatment of depressive states with G 22355 (imipramine hydrochloride) | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 115 | issue = 5 | pages = 459–64 | year = 1958 | pmid = 13583250 }}</ref>

=== Second generation antidepressants ===
{{Main|Second-generation antidepressants}}

Antidepressants became [[prescription drug]]s in the 1950s. It was estimated that no more than 50 to 100 individuals per million suffered from the kind of depression that these new drugs would treat, and pharmaceutical companies were not enthusiastic in marketing for this small market. Sales through the 1960s remained poor compared to the sales of tranquilizers,<ref>{{cite web |title=Tranquilizers |url=http://www.cmcsb.com/tranquil.htm |work=Cumberland Moutain Community Services |publisher=www.cmcsb.com |accessdate=20 November 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916074410/http://www.cmcsb.com/tranquil.htm |archivedate=16 September 2012}}{{Unreliable medical source|date=March 2013}}</ref> which were being marketed for different uses.<ref name="3faces">{{cite journal | author = Healy D | title = The Three Faces of the Antidepressants: A Critical Commentary on the Clinical-Economic Context of Diagnosis | journal = The Journal of Nervous & Mental Disease | volume = 187 | issue = 3 | pages = 174–80 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10086474 | doi = 10.1097/00005053-199903000-00007 }}</ref> Imipramine remained in common use and numerous successors were introduced.

By the 1960s, it was thought that the mode of action of tricyclics was to inhibit norepinephrine reuptake. However, norepinephrine reuptake became associated with stimulating effects. Later tricyclics were thought to affect [[serotonin]] as proposed in 1969 by Carlsson and Lindqvist as well as Lapin and Oxenkrug.{{medical citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Researchers began a process of [[rational drug design]] to isolate antihistamine-derived compounds that would selectively target these systems. The first such compound to be patented was [[zimelidine]] in 1971, while the first released clinically was [[indalpine]]. [[Fluoxetine]] was approved for commercial use by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1988, becoming the first [[Blockbuster drug|blockbuster]] SSRI.

[[Hypericum perforatum|St John's wort]] fell out of favor in most countries through the 19th and 20th centuries, except in [[Germany]], where [[Hypericum]] extracts were eventually licensed, packaged and prescribed.

== Society and culture ==

=== Prescription trends ===

In the United States, antidepressants were the most commonly prescribed medication in 2013.<ref name=AJantidepressantstatsUS /> Of the estimated 16 million "long term" (over 24 months) users, roughly 70 percent are female.<ref name=AJantidepressantstatsUS>{{cite web |last1=White|first1=Rebecca|title=Waking up from sadness: Many find trouble getting off antidepressants|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/1/22/patients-mostly-womenfindtroublegettingoffofantidepressants.html|website=Al Jazeera|accessdate=8 June 2014}}</ref>

In the UK, figures reported in 2010 indicated that the number of antidepressant prescribed by the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) almost doubled over a decade.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/jun/11/antidepressant-prescriptions-rise-nhs-recession |title=Antidepressant Use Rises as Recession Feeds Wave of Worry |date=11 June 2010 |accessdate=1 July 2010 |location=London |newspaper=The Guardian |first=Rowenna |last=Davis |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615165456/http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/jun/11/antidepressant-prescriptions-rise-nhs-recession? |archivedate=15 June 2010  |deadurl=no}}</ref> Further analysis published in 2014 showed that number of antidepressants dispensed annually in the community went up by 25 million in the 14 years between 1998 and 2012, rising from 15 million to 40 million. Nearly 50% of this rise occurred in the four years after the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2008 banking crash]], during which time the annual increase in prescriptions rose from 6.7% to 8.5%.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Spence|first1=Ruth|title=Focus on: Antidepressant prescribing|url=http://www.qualitywatch.org.uk/focus-on/antidepressant-prescribing|website=QualityWatch|publisher=QualityWatch (Nuffield Trust/Health Foundation)|accessdate=12 January 2015}}</ref> These sources also suggest that aside from the recession, other factors that may influence changes in prescribing rates may include: improvements in diagnosis, a reduction of the [[Social stigma|stigma]] surrounding mental health, broader prescribing trends, GP characteristics, geographical location and housing status. Another factor that contribute to increasing consumption of antidepressants is the fact that these medications now are used for other conditions including [[social anxiety]] and [[post traumatic stress]].

'''Netherlands:''' In the Netherlands, [[paroxetine]], marketed as Seroxat among generic preparations, is the most prescribed antidepressant, followed by [[amitriptyline]], [[citalopram]] and [[venlafaxine]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gipdatabank.nl/index.asp?scherm=tabellenFrameSet&infoType=g&tabel=01-basis&item=N06AB |title=GIPdatabank |publisher=Gipdatabank.nl |accessdate=6 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206123718/http://www.gipdatabank.nl/index.asp?scherm=tabellenFrameSet&infoType=g&tabel=01-basis&item=N06AB |archivedate=6 December 2008  |deadurl=no}}</ref>

=== Social science perspective ===
In looking at the issue of antidepressant use, some academics have highlighted the need to examine the use of antidepressants and other medical treatments in cross-cultural terms, due to the fact that various cultures prescribe and observe different manifestations, symptoms, meanings and associations of depression and other medical conditions within their populations.<ref name="Ecks_2005">{{cite journal | author = Ecks S | title = Pharmaceutical Citizenship: Antidepressant Marketing and the Promise of Demarginalization in India | journal = Anthropology & Medicine | year = 2005 | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 239–254 | doi=10.1080/13648470500291360}}</ref><ref name="Lock_2010">{{cite book | name-list-format = vanc  | last1 = Lock M, Nguyen VK | title = An anthropology of biomedicine | date = 2010 | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | location  = Chichester, West Sussex | isbn = 1-4051-1071-6 | edition = 1st| chapter="Local Biologies and Human Difference | pages = 83–109 }}</ref> These cross-cultural discrepancies, it has been argued, then have implications on the perceived efficacy and use of antidepressants and other strategies in the treatment of depression in these different cultures.<ref name="Ecks_2005" /><ref name="Lock_2010" /> In India antidepressants are largely seen as tools to combat marginality, promising the individual the ability to re-integrate into society through their use—a view and association not observed in the West.<ref name="Ecks_2005" />

=== Environmental impacts ===
Somewhat less than 10% of orally administered fluoxetine is excreted from humans unchanged or as [[glucuronide]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Biochem/Chm_357/Articles/SSRIs.pdf |title=Pharmacokinetics of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors |format= |work= |accessdate= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523225824/http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Biochem/Chm_357/Articles/SSRIs.pdf |archivedate=23 May 2014}}</ref><ref name="pmid17160491">{{cite journal | author = Nentwig G | title = Effects of pharmaceuticals on aquatic invertebrates.
