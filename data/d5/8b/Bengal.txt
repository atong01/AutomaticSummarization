'''Bengal''' {{IPAc-en|b|E|N|'|g|aw|l}} ({{lang-bn|বাংলা}} {{audio|bangla.ogg|''Bangla''}} /baŋla/ or {{lang|bn|বঙ্গ}} ''Bônggo'' /bɔŋɡo/) is a geographical and ethno-linguistic region in the eastern part of the [[Indian subcontinent]], at the [[Apex (geometry)|apex]] of the [[Bay of Bengal]] and dominated by the [[Fertility (soil)|fertile]] [[Ganges delta]]. The Bengal region was politically divided in the 1947 [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|Partition of India]] based on [[religion]]: predominantly [[Hindu]] [[West Bengal]] became a [[province]] (now a [[States and union territories of India|state]]) of [[India]], while predominantly [[Muslim]] [[East Bengal]] became a province of [[Pakistan]] and later gained independence as [[Bangladesh]]. Some regions of the [[History of Bengal|historical kingdoms of Bengal]] are now part of the neighbouring Indian states of [[Assam]], [[Tripura]], [[Bihar]], [[Jharkhand]], and [[Odisha]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} The [[Bengali people]] ({{lang|bn|বাঙালি}} ''Bangali''), who speak the [[Bengali language]] ({{lang|bn|বাংলা}} ''Bangla''), which is [[Indo-Aryan]], natively inhabit the region, alongside dozens of indigenous ethnic groups who speak [[Languages of Bangladesh|minority languages]] of the [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]], [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]], and [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] families.

Bengal is one of the most densely populated regions on Earth,{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} with an estimated population of  250 million people <ref>http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/23/amitav-ghosh-vibrant-literary-world-india-naipaul-interview</ref> and a population density exceeding 900 people per [[square kilometre]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} Most of the Bengal region lies in the low-lying Ganges Delta, the world's largest [[river delta]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} In the southern part of the delta lies the [[Sundarbans]], the world's largest [[mangrove]] forest{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} and home of the [[Bengal tiger]]. In the coastal southeast lies [[Cox's Bazar]], the world's longest beach with a length of {{convert|120|km|mi|abbr=on}}.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} While most of region is [[rural area|rural]] and [[agriculture|agrarian]], it includes two [[megacity|megacities]]: [[Kolkata]] (formerly Calcutta) and [[Dhaka]] (formerly Dacca).

The Bengal region has a rich [[Bengali literature|literary]] and [[Culture of Bengal|cultural heritage]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} and immensely influenced [[Outline of South Asian history|South Asian history]] through the [[Bengal Renaissance]] during the 19th and early 20th centuries and the [[Bengali Language Movement]] in the mid-20th century. The Bengal was the seat of western science education and a major industrial hub in pre and post independent India and reshaped the modern Indian culture and the [[Bengali people]] made important contributions to the [[revolutionary movement for Indian independence]] and the overall [[Indian independence movement]], and successfully prosecuted the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].

The exact origin of the word {{lang|bn|বাংলা}} ''Bangla'' (Bengali) and {{lang|bn|বঙ্গ}} ''Bongo'' (Bengal) is unknown, though the word is believed to be derived from the Dravidian-speaking tribe called ''Bang'' that settled in the area around the year 1000 BC.<ref name="congress">{{cite book

{{Main|Languages of Bangladesh}}
[[Bengali language|Bengali]] is the main language spoken in Bengal. Because of their many phonological, lexical, and structural differences from the standard variety, some geographically peripheral varieties of Bengali are also considered separate languages by some linguists; these include [[Sylheti language|Sylheti]], [[Chittagonian language|Chittagonian]], [[Chakma language|Chakma]], [[Rangpuri language|Rangpuri/Rajbangshi]], [[Hajong language|Hajong]], [[Rohingya language|Rohingya]], and [[Tangchangya language|Tangchangya]].<ref name="ethnologue.com">http://www.ethnologue.com/country/BD/languages</ref>

[[English language|English]] is often used for official work alongside [[Bengali language|Bengali]], and many Bengalis are also familiar with other major [[Indo-Aryan languages]] such as [[Hindi]], [[Urdu]], [[Assamese language|Assamese]], and [[Nepali language|Nepali]].

In addition, there are several minority ethnolinguistic groups native to the region. These include speakers of other [[Indo-Aryan languages]] (e.g. [[Bishnupriya Manipuri language|Bishnupriya Manipuri]], [[Sadri language|Oraon Sadri]], various [[Bihari language|Bihari]] languages), [[Tibeto-Burman languages]] (e.g. [[A'Tong language|A'Tong]], [[Chak language|Chak]], [[Koch language|Koch]], [[Garo language|Garo]], [[Megam language|Megam]], [[Meitei language|Meitei Manipuri]], [[Mizo language|Mizo]], [[Mru language|Mru]], [[Pangkhua language|Pangkhua]], [[Rakhine language|Rakhine]]/[[Marma Language|Marma]], [[Kok Borok language|Kok Borok]], [[Reang language|Riang]], [[Tippera language|Tippera]], [[Usoi language|Usoi]], various [[Chin languages]]), [[Austroasiatic languages]] (e.g. [[Khasi language|Khasi]], [[Koda language|Koda]], [[Mundari language|Mundari]], [[Pnar language|Pnar]], [[Santali language|Santali]], [[War language|War]]), and [[Dravidian languages]] (e.g. [[Kurukh language|Kurukh]], [[Sauria Paharia language|Sauria Paharia]]).<ref name="ethnologue.com"/>

About 20,000 people live on [[char]]s. Chars are temporary islands formed by the deposition of sediments eroded off the banks of the Ganges in West Bengal which often disappear in the monsoon season. They are made of very fertile soil. The inhabitants of chars are not recognised by the Government of West Bengal on the grounds that it is not known whether they are Bengalis or Bangladeshi refugees. Consequently, no identification documents are issued to char-dwellers who cannot benefit from health care, barely survive because of very poor sanitation and are prevented from emigrating to the mainland to find jobs when they have turned 14. On a particular char it was reported that 13% of women died at childbirth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wanderinggaia.com|title=Wandering Gaia|publisher="The Give and Take of the Ganges" WordPress.com |date= |accessdate=13 April 2009}}</ref>

==Economy==
Agriculture is the leading occupation in the region. Rice is the staple food crop. Other food crops are [[pulses]], potato, maize, and [[oil seeds]]. [[Jute]] is the principal [[cash crop]]. Tea is also produced commercially; the region is well known for [[Darjeeling tea|Darjeeling]] and other high-quality teas.

The common [[Bengali language]] and culture anchors the shared tradition of two parts of politically divided Bengal. Bengal has a long tradition in folk literature, evidenced by the ''[[Charyapada|Chôrjapôdô]]'', ''[[Mangalkavya]]'', ''[[Shreekrishna Kirtana]]'', ''[[Maimansingha Gitika]]'' or ''[[Thakurmar Jhuli]]''. Bengali literature in the medieval age was often either religious (e.g. [[Chandidas]]), or adaptations from other languages (e.g. [[Alaol]]). During the [[Bengal Renaissance]] of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, [[Bengali literature]] was modernised through the works of authors such as [[Michael Madhusudan Dutta]], [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]] and [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]].

}}</ref> Other folk music forms include [[Gombhira]], [[Bhatiali]] and [[Bhawaiya]]. Folk music in Bengal is often accompanied by the [[ektara]], a one-stringed instrument. Other instruments include the [[dotara]], [[dhol]], [[flute]], and [[tabla]]. The region also has an active heritage in [[Hindustani classical music|North Indian classical music]].

Bengal had also been the harbinger of [[modernism]] in [[Indian art]]s. Abanindranath Tagore, one of the important 18th century artist from Bengal is often referred to as the father of Indian modern art. He had established the first non-British art academy in India known as the Kalabhavan within the premises of [[Santiniketan]]. Santiniketan in course of time had produced many important Indian artists like [[Gaganendranath Tagore]], [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Jamini Roy]], [[Benode Bihari Mukherjee]] and [[Ramkinkar Baij]]. In the post-independence era, Bengal had produced important artists like [[Somenath Hore]], [[Meera Mukherjee]] and [[Ganesh Pyne]].

Rice and fish are traditional favourite foods, leading to a saying that in Bengali, ''mach ar bhaath bangali baanaay'', that translates as "fish and rice make a Bengali".<ref name=machhe>{{cite web

Bengali women commonly wear the ''[[sari|shaŗi]]'' and the [[salwar kameez]], often distinctly designed according to local cultural customs. In urban areas, many women and men wear Western-style attire. Among men, European dressing has greater acceptance. Men also wear traditional costumes such as the ''[[kurta]]'' with ''[[dhoti]]'' or ''[[pyjama]]'', often on religious occasions. The [[lungi]], a kind of long skirt, is widely worn by Bangladeshi men.

The greatest religious festivals are the two [[religious festival|Eids]] ([[Eid ul-Fitr]] and [[Eid ul-Adha]]) for the Muslims, and the autumnal [[Durga|Durga Puja]] for Hindus.<ref name=durgapuja>{{cite web

==Intra-Bengal relations today==
Geographic, cultural, historic, and commercial ties are growing, and both countries recognise the importance of good relations.
