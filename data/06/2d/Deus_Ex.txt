'''''Deus Ex''''' is a [[Cyberpunk|cyberpunk-themed]] [[action role-playing game|action-role playing]] [[video game]]—combining [[first-person shooter]], [[stealth game|stealth]] and [[role-playing video game|role-playing]] elements—developed by [[Ion Storm]] and published by [[Eidos Interactive]] in 2000. First published for [[personal computer]]s running [[Microsoft Windows]], ''Deus Ex'' was later [[ported]] to [[Mac OS]] systems and [[PlayStation 2]]. Set in a [[dystopia]]n world during the year 2052, the central plot follows [[rookie]] United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition agent [[JC Denton]], as he sets out to combat [[terrorism|terrorist]] forces, which have become increasingly prevalent in a world slipping ever further into chaos. As the plot unfolds, Denton becomes entangled in a deep and ancient [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]], encountering organizations such as [[Majestic 12]], the [[Illuminati]] and [[Hong Kong]] [[Triad (organized crime)|Triads]] during his journey.

The game received universal critical acclaim, including repeatedly being named "Best PC Game of All Time" in ''[[PC Gamer]]''{{'}}s "Top 100 PC Games" in 2011<ref name='PCGTop100'>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/02/16/the-100-best-pc-games-of-all-time/10/ |title=PCGamer Top 100 |accessdate=2009-12-16 |date=2009-12-16 |work=PC Gamer |publisher=Future Publishing }}</ref> and in a poll carried out by UK gaming magazine ''[[PC Zone]]''.<ref name="gamesindustry">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/deus-ex-named-top-pc-game-of-all-time |title=Deus Ex named "top PC game of all time (pc: 2007):Reviews |work=gamesindustry |accessdate=September 7, 2007}}</ref> It was a frequent candidate for and winner of [[Game of the Year]] awards, drawing praise for its pioneering designs in player choice and multiple narrative paths.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2008/06/06/remembering-deus-ex/ |title=Remembering 'Deus Ex' — One Of Modern Gaming's First Titles Offering Real Player Choice |work=[[MTV]] |accessdate=March 15, 2009}}</ref> It has sold more than 1 million copies, as of April 23, 2009.<ref name="ve3d">{{cite web |url=http://ve3d.ign.com/articles/news/46400/Eidos-Square-Enix-Sales-Figures-Revealed|first=Andrew|last=Burnes|title=Eidos & Square Enix Sales Figures Revealed |work=Voodoo Extreme|publisher=IGN |date=April 23, 2009|accessdate=September 7, 2011}}</ref> The game has spawned both a sequel, ''[[Deus Ex: Invisible War]]'', released in 2003, and a prequel, ''[[Deus Ex: Human Revolution]]'', released in 2011.<ref name="GamaDX3">{{cite web|first=Leigh |last= Alexander |title=Eidos Announces ''Deus Ex 3'', Talks New Montreal Studio |date=2007-11-26 |publisher=Gamasutra |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=16365 |accessdate=2007-11-26}}</ref>

== Gameplay ==
''Deus Ex'' incorporates elements from four [[video game genre]]s: [[role-playing video game|role-playing]], [[first-person shooter]], [[adventure game|adventure]], and "immersive [[Simulation video game|simulation]]", the last of which being a game where "nothing reminds you that you're just playing a game".<ref name="gamasutra">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3114/postmortem_ion_storms_deus_ex.php |last=Spector |first=Warren |title=Postmortem: Ion Storm's ''Deus Ex'' |date=2000-12-06 |work=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=July 24, 2007 }}</ref> For example, the game uses a [[Point of view (literature)#Other types and uses|first-person]] camera during gameplay and includes exploration and character interaction as primary features.<ref name="gamasutra" />

The player assumes the role of [[JC Denton]], a [[Nanotechnology in fiction|nanotech]]-augmented operative of the [[United Nations]] Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO).<ref name="dxmanual">''Deus Ex'' game manual</ref> This nanotechnology is a central gameplay mechanism, and allows players to perform [[superhuman]] feats.

=== Role-playing elements ===
As the player accomplishes objectives, the [[player character]] is rewarded with "skill points". Skill points are used to enhance a character's abilities in eleven different areas, and were designed to provide players with a way to customize their characters;<ref name="gamasutra" /> a player might create a combat-focused character by increasing proficiency with pistols or rifles, while a more furtive character can be created by focusing on lock picking and computer hacking abilities. There are four different levels of proficiency in each skill, with the skill point cost increasing for each successive level.<ref name="kierongillen">{{cite web |first=Kieron |last=Gillen  |authorlink=Kieron Gillen |year=2005 |title=Kieron Gillen's Workblog |url=http://gillen.cream.org/wordpress_html/assorted-essays/deus-ex/ |accessdate=October 13, 2006}}</ref><ref name="eurogamer">{{cite web |date=2000-08-04 |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/warrens2 |title=Warren Spector of Ion Storm (Part Two) |work=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=March 27, 2007 }}</ref>

Weapons may be customized through "weapon modifications", which can be found or purchased throughout the game. The player might add [[Telescopic sight|scopes]], [[Suppressor|silencers]], or [[laser sight]]s; increase the weapon's [[range of a projectile|range]], [[accuracy]], or [[magazine (firearm)|magazine]] size; or decrease its [[recoil]] and reload time. Not all modifications are available to all weapons; for example, a [[Shoulder-launched missile weapon|rocket launcher]] cannot be silenced, and recoil cannot be reduced on a [[flamethrower]].

Players are further encouraged to customize their characters through nano-augmentations—[[cybernetic]] devices that grant characters superhuman powers. While the game contains eighteen different nano-augmentations, the player can install a maximum of nine, as each must be used on a certain part of the body: one in the arms, legs, eyes, and head; two underneath the skin; and three in the torso.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Deus Ex @ GameBanshee |date= |publisher= |url=http://www.gamebanshee.com/deusex/augmentations.php |work= |pages= |accessdate=2007-11-09 |language= }}</ref> This forces the player to choose carefully between the benefits offered by each augmentation. For example, the arm augmentation requires the player to decide between boosting their character's skill in hand-to-hand combat or his ability to lift heavy objects.

Interaction with [[non-player characters]] (NPCs) was a large design focus.<ref name="gamasutra" /> When the player interacts with a non-player character, the game will enter a [[cutscene]]-like conversation mode where the player advances the conversation by selecting from a list of dialogue options. The player's choices often have a substantial effect on both gameplay and plot, as non-player characters will react in different ways depending on the selected answer (e.g. rudeness makes them less likely to provide assistance).

=== Combat elements ===
''Deus Ex'' features combat similar to first-person shooters, with [[real time (media)|real-time]] action, a first-person perspective, and reflex-based gameplay.<ref name="gamasutra" /> As the player will often encounter enemies in groups, combat often tends toward a tactical approach, including the use of cover, strafing, and "[[Hit-and-run tactics|hit-and-run]]". A [[USA Today]] reviewer found "At the easiest difficulty setting, your character is puréed again and again by an onslaught of human and robotic terrorists until you learn the value of stealth."<ref>{{cite news |last=Berman |first=A.S. |title=''Deus Ex'': Breathing new life into a tired genre |publisher=USA Today |date=2000-08-10 |url=http://www.cincinnati.com/freetime/games/reviews/deusex.html |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20070621233333/http://www.cincinnati.com/freetime/games/reviews/deusex.html |archivedate=2007-06-21 |accessdate=2007-07-21 }}</ref> However, through the game's role-playing systems (see above), it is possible to develop a character's skills and augmentations to create a [[tank (computer gaming)|tank]]-like combat specialist with the ability to deal and absorb large amounts of damage.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Deus Ex Augmentation Guide v1.3 |date= |publisher= |url=http://faqs.neoseeker.com/Games/PC/deus_ex_augmentation_masterofthevg.txt?k=1992 |work= |pages= |accessdate=2007-11-09 |language= }}</ref> Non-player characters will praise or criticize the main character depending on his use of force, incorporating a moral element into the gameplay.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Thompson |first=Adam J. |title=Morality Play – Creating Ethics in Video Games |date=2003-12-18 |url=http://www.adamjthompson.com/thought/CreatingEthics.html |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20070927011354/http://www.adamjthompson.com/thought/CreatingEthics.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |accessdate=2007-08-15 }}</ref>

''Deus Ex'' features a [[HUD (computer gaming)|head-up display]] crosshair, whose size dynamically shows where shots will fall based on movement, aim, and the weapon in use; the reticle expands while the player is moving or shifting his or her aim, and slowly shrinks to its original size while no actions are taken.<ref name="dxmanual" /> How quickly the reticle shrinks depends on the character's proficiency with the equipped weapon, the number of accuracy modifications added to the weapon, and the level of the "targeting" nano-augmentation.

''Deus Ex'' features twenty-four weapons, ranging from [[crowbar (tool)|crowbars]], [[electroshock weapon]]s, and riot [[Club (weapon)|baton]], to [[laser guidance|laser guided]] [[anti-tank]] [[rocket]]s and [[assault rifle]]s;<ref name="dxmanual" /> both lethal and [[non-lethal weapon]]s are available. The player can also make use of several weapons of opportunity, such as [[fire extinguisher]]s.

=== Player choice ===
[[File:How to pass obstacles in Deus Ex.jpg|thumb|left|Players are given multiple ways to traverse obstacles, from lockpicking to armed combat.|300px]]

Gameplay in ''Deus Ex'' emphasizes player choice. Objectives can be completed in numerous ways, including [[Stealth game|stealth]], sniping, heavy frontal assault, dialogue, or engineering and computer hacking. This level of freedom requires that levels, characters, and puzzles be designed with significant redundancy, as a single play-through of the game will miss large sections of dialogue, areas, and other content. In some missions the player is encouraged to avoid using deadly force, and certain aspects of the story may change depending on how violent or non-violent the player chooses to be. The game is also unusual in that two of its [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] villains can be killed off early in the game, or left alive to be defeated later, and this too affects how other characters interact with the player.

Because of its design focus on player choice, ''Deus Ex'' has been compared with ''[[System Shock]]'', a game that inspired its design.<ref name="kierongillen"/><ref name="eurogamer"/> Together, these factors give the game a great degree of replayability, as the player will have vastly different experiences, depending on which methods he or she uses to accomplish objectives.

=== Multiplayer ===
''Deus Ex'' was designed as a [[single player]] game, and the initial releases of the Windows and Macintosh versions of the game did not include [[multiplayer]] functionality.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gaming-age.com/cgi-bin/specials/special.pl?spec=deusex&pagenum=1 |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20110605223321/http://www.gaming-age.com/cgi-bin/specials/special.pl?spec=deusex&pagenum=1 |archivedate=2011-06-05 |title=Interview with Warren Spector |work=www.gaming-age.com |last=Klepek |first=Patrick |accessdate=2006-12-13}}</ref> Support for multiplayer modes was later incorporated through [[patch (computing)|patches]].<ref name="gamespy2">{{cite web |url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/december00/dxmp/index2.shtm |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/64z2lz0cZ |archivedate=2012-01-26 |title=''Deus Ex'' goes Multiplayer |work=Gamespy |author=John "Warrior" Keefer |accessdate=March 10, 2007}}</ref> The component includes three game modes: deathmatch, basic team deathmatch, and advanced team [[deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]].

== Synopsis ==
{{Deus Ex Timeline}}

=== Setting and characters ===
''Deus Ex'' takes place in the year 2052 in a world that draws heavily upon popular real world [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] for many of its plot elements. These include speculations regarding [[black helicopter]]s, [[vaccine controversy|vaccinations]], and [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]], as well as [[Area 51]], the [[ECHELON]] network, [[Men in Black]], [[chupacabras]] (in the form of "greasels"), and [[grey alien]]s. Mysterious groups such as Majestic 12, the [[Illuminati]], the [[Knights Templar]], the [[Bilderberg Group]], and the [[Trilateral Commission]] also either play a central part in the plot, or are alluded to during the course of the game. This dark setting is enhanced by the fact that the entire game takes place at night, a backdrop that adds to the atmosphere of conspiracies and stealth.

The game contradicts itself in several instances regarding the exact year in which the events of the story take place, but information in the sequel ''[[Deus Ex: Invisible War]]'' reconciles this inconsistency via [[retroactive continuity]], placing the events of ''Deus Ex'' in the year 2052.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/april02/dxbible/dx1/index.shtm |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5w1Owsizs |archivedate=2011-01-26 |title=DX1 Continuity Bible: Part I |work=Gamespy |author=The Deus Ex Team |accessdate=August 25, 2012}}</ref> Most of the game takes place in fictionalized versions of real-world locations, including [[New York City]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Paris]], [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]], and [[Area 51]].

The plot of ''Deus Ex'' depicts a society on a slow spiral into chaos. There is a massive division between the rich and the poor, not only socially, but in some cities physically. A lethal [[pandemic]] known as the "Gray Death" ravages the world's population, especially within the United States, and has no cure. A synthetic [[vaccine]], "Ambrosia", manufactured by the company VersaLife, nullifies the effects of the virus, but is in critically short supply. Because of its scarcity, Ambrosia is available only to those deemed "vital to the social order", and finds its way primarily to government officials, military personnel, the rich and influential, scientists, and the intellectual elite. With no hope for the common people of the world, riots occur worldwide, and a number of terrorist organizations have formed with the professed intent of assisting the downtrodden, among them the National Secessionist Forces of the U.S. and a French group known as Silhouette.

In order to combat these threats to the world order, the [[United Nations]] has greatly expanded its governmental influence around the globe. The United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO) is formed, with the intent of maintaining peace internationally and combating the world's ever-growing number of terrorist groups.<ref name="wendiwhite">'''Wendi White (in''' '''''Righteous Angels: Perspectives on UNATCO''''' '''):''' As the giddiness that greeted the new millennium faded to grim apathy in the face of the plague, famine, and the inevitable waves of national convulsions that followed in their wake, the United Nations found itself increasingly outmoded and unable to cope with the worldwide rise in terrorism. {{cite video game |title=Deus Ex |developer=Ion Storm Inc. |publisher=Eidos Interactive |date=2002-03-25 |platform=PlayStation 2 }}</ref> It is headquartered near New York City in a bunker beneath [[Liberty Island]], placed there after a terrorist strike on the [[Statue of Liberty]].<ref name="unatcohandbook">'''''UNATCO Handbook: UNATCO and the World''''' ''':'''Not only did the United States become a charter member of UNATCO, but UNATCO headquarters are now located on Liberty Island in the shadow of that shattered monument to FREEDOM." {{cite video game |title=Deus Ex |developer=Ion Storm Inc. |publisher=Eidos Interactive |date=2002-03-25 |platform=PlayStation 2 }}</ref> Alex Jacobson's character model and name are based on [[Warren Spector]]'s own nephew, Alec Jacobson.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/?p=1115#more-1115 |title=RPS Exclusive: Warren Spector Interview |author=Kieron Gillen |date=February 14, 2008 |accessdate=February 16, 2008}}</ref>

=== Plot ===
The player assumes the identity of JC Denton, a [[nanotechnology|nanotechnologically]]-augmented ("nano-aug") UNATCO agent. After completing his training, JC takes several missions given by Director Joseph Manderley to track down members of the National Secessionist Forces (NSF) and their stolen shipments of the "Ambrosia" vaccine, the treatment for the "Gray Death" virus. Through these missions, JC is reunited with his brother, Paul, who is also nano-augmented. JC tracks the Ambrosia shipment to a private terminal at [[LaGuardia Airport]]. Paul meets JC outside the plane, and explains that he has defected from UNATCO and is now working with the NSF after learning that the Gray Death is a man-made virus, with UNATCO using its power to make sure only the elite receive the vaccine.<ref name="pauldefection">'''Paul:''' The Gray Death is a man-made virus. Everyone up to the President is at UNATCO's mercy as long as UNATCO controls the supply of Ambrosia. / '''JC:''' You believe that? / '''Paul:''' We have proof. We need to get the Ambrosia to Hong Kong. Heard of Tracer Tong? He can help us synthesize it ourselves. {{cite video game |title=Deus Ex |developer=Ion Storm Inc. |publisher=Eidos Interactive |date=2002-03-25 |platform=PlayStation 2 }}</ref>

JC returns to UNATCO headquarters and is told by Manderley that both he and Paul have been outfitted with a 24-hour [[kill switch]], and that Paul's has been activated due to his betrayal. Manderley orders JC to fly to [[Hong Kong]] to eliminate Tracer Tong, a hacker whom Paul has contact with, and who can disable the kill switches. Instead, JC returns to Paul's apartment to find Paul hiding inside. Paul further explains his defection and encourages JC to also defect by sending out a distress call to alert the NSF's allies. Upon doing so, JC becomes a wanted man by UNATCO, and his own kill switch is activated by [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) Director Walton Simons. JC is unable to escape UNATCO forces, and both he and Paul (provided he survived the raid on the apartment) are taken to a secret prison below UNATCO headquarters. An entity named "Daedalus" contacts JC and informs him that the prison is part of Majestic 12, and arranges for him and Paul to escape. The two flee to Hong Kong to meet with Tong, who deactivates their kill switches. Tong requests JC infiltrate the VersaLife building. Doing so, JC discovers that the corporation is the source for the Gray Death, and he is able to steal the plans for the virus and destroy the "universal constructor" (UC) that produces it.<ref name="daedalusplague">'''Daedalus:''' Majestic 12 seeks to use force and intimidation to seize absolute control. Of everything. They will not hesitate to use all means necessary to achieve this goal, and have engineered the disease you refer to as the "Gray Death" in an effort to accomplish this. The Gray Death is a nanotechnologically engineered virus. You must locate the Universal Constructor used to create the Gray Death and destroy it. My information indicates that it is in Hong Kong, housed in a Majestic 12 facility beneath the corporation known as VersaLife. {{cite video game |title=Deus Ex |developer=Ion Storm Inc. |publisher=Eidos Interactive |date=2002-03-25 |platform=PlayStation 2 }}</ref>

Analysis of the virus shows it was manufactured by the Illuminati, prompting Tong to send JC to [[Paris]] to try to make contact with the organization and obtain their help fighting Majestic 12. JC eventually meets with Illuminati leader Morgan Everett, and learns that the Gray Death virus was intended to be used for augmentation technology, but Majestic 12, led by trillionaire businessman and former Illuminatus Bob Page, was able to steal and repurpose<!--?--> it into its current viral form. Everett recognizes that without VersaLife's universal constructor, Majestic 12 can no longer create the virus, and will likely target Vandenberg Air Force Base, where X-51, a group of former [[Area 51]] scientists, has built another one. After aiding the base personnel in repelling a Majestic 12 attack, JC meets X-51 leader Gary Savage, who reveals that Daedalus is an [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) borne out of the [[ECHELON]] program. Everett attempts to gain control over Majestic 12's communications network by releasing Daedalus onto the U.S. military networks, but Page counters by releasing his own AI, Icarus, which merges with Daedalus to form a new AI, Helios, with the ability to control all global communications. After this, Savage enlists JC's help in procuring schematics for reconstructing components for the UC that were damaged during Majestic 12's raid of Vandenberg. JC finds the schematics and electronically transmits them to Savage. Page intercepts the transmission and launches a [[nuclear missile]] at Vandenberg to ensure that Area 51 (now Majestic 12's headquarters), will be the only location in the world with an operational UC. However, JC is able to reprogram the missile to strike Area 51. JC then travels there himself to confront Page.

When JC locates him, Page reveals that he seeks to merge with Helios and gain full control over all nanotechnology, essentially becoming a god. JC is contacted by Tong, Everett, and the Helios AI simultaneously. All three factions ask for his help in defeating Page, while furthering their own objectives, and JC is forced to choose between them. Tong seeks to plunge the world into a second [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Age]] by destroying the global communications hub and preventing anyone from taking control of the world.<ref name="tongending">'''JC Denton:''' If we destroy the Aquinas Hub, we'll take down the global network. / '''Tracer Tong:''' Exactly.

After [[Looking Glass Studios|Looking Glass Technologies]] and [[Origin Systems]] released ''[[Ultima Underworld II: Labyrinth of Worlds]]'' in January 1993, producer [[Warren Spector]] began to plan ''Troubleshooter'', the game that would become ''Deus Ex''.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=52}} Spector found himself [[Burnout (psychology)|burnt out]] on fantasy and science fiction settings, and hoped to make a game set in the real world.<ref name="Gamasutra: postmortem p2"/> In his 1994 proposal, he described the concept as "''Underworld''-style first-person action" in a real world setting with "big-budget, nonstop action".<ref name="Gamasutra: postmortem p2"/> Spector later commented that Origin did not have the interest, nor Looking Glass the funding, to produce the game.<ref name="GameSlice p1"/> He eventually left Origin for Looking Glass and continued to develop the game's concept,{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=52}} but his project ''Junction Point'', which was inspired by ideas from ''Troubleshooter'', was cancelled.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} After Spector and his team were laid off from Looking Glass, [[John Romero]] of [[Ion Storm]] offered him the chance to make his "dream game" without any restrictions. Spector quickly joined the company.<ref name="PC Zone: best ever"/>

Preproduction for ''Deus Ex'' began around August 1997{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=50}} and lasted roughly six months. The six-person team{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=52}} came from Looking Glass's [[Austin]] studio.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=56}} Spector, the team's director and producer, saw their work as improving upon the [[game design]] ideas of Origin, Looking Glass, and [[Valve (company)|Valve]] by doing what those companies did not.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=50}} The game's "ironic"<ref name="Gamasutra: postmortem p2"/><ref name=ionstormquestions>{{cite web | last=Spector | first=Warren | title=Questions of the Day | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980118004328/http://www.ionstorm.com/eos/Di/1124_1130.html | url=http://www.ionstorm.com/eos/Di/1124_1130.html | work=[[Ion Storm]] | date=November 24, 1997 | archivedate=January 18, 1998 }}</ref> working title was ''Shooter: Majestic Revelations'', and it was scheduled for release on Christmas 1998.<ref name="USgamer: deleted scenes"/> The team developed the setting before the [[game mechanics]].{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=52}} Noticing his wife's fascination with ''[[The X-Files]]'', Spector connected the "real world, millennial weirdness, [and] conspiracy" topics on his mind and decided to make a game about them that would appeal to a wide audience.<ref name="GameSlice p1"/> ''Shooter''{{'}}s fiction was based in part on [[conspiracy theories]] related to [[Area 51]], [[Allegations of CIA drug trafficking|CIA drug trafficking]], the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy assassination]], the [[Majestic 12]], and a [[Masonic conspiracy theories|Masonic bunker]] beneath [[Denver International Airport#Controversy|Denver International Airport]]. The team designed over 200 characters without associated in-game roles,{{clarify|date=July 2014}} which was both helpful when designing missions and unhelpful as they attempted to reduce their scope.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=52}} Later in 1997, Spector wrote a "manifesto" on his ideal game and the structure of [[role-playing video game]]s.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=52}} His principles included "problems, not puzzles", "no forced failure", "players do; NPCs watch", and "areas with multiple entrance and exit points".<ref name="Gamasutra: postmortem p2"/> In retrospect, Spector believed that ''Deus Ex'' accomplished the intent of his manifesto.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=52}}

The ''Shooter'' design document cast the player as an [[Human enhancement|augmented]] agent working against an elite cabal in the "dangerous and chaotic" 2050s.<ref name="Gamasutra: postmortem p2"/> It cited ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'', ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]'', ''[[Thief: The Dark Project]]'', and ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]'' as game design influences, and used the stories and settings of ''[[Colossus: The Forbin Project]]'', ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]'', ''[[Robocop]]'', ''The X-Files'' and ''[[Men in Black (film)|Men in Black]]'' as reference points. According to the document, the game would engage with "the millennial madness that's gripping the world ... and a general fascination with conspiracy theories and the desire to play with high-tech espionage toys".<ref name="Gamasutra: postmortem p2"/> The team designed a [[Statistic (role-playing games)|skill system]] that featured "special powers" derived from nanotechnological augmentation, and avoided the inclusion of [[Dice#Application in role-playing games|die rolling]] and skills that required micromanagement.{{sfn|Spector|2000|pp=52–3}} Augmentations were unique to the player character. By March 1998, preproduction had generated 300 pages of documentation. The document grew to 500 pages, with "radically different" content, by the game's April 1999 Alpha 1 deadline.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=53}} Of Spector's original design document, the marketing section was the only part left unedited.<ref name="USgamer: deleted scenes"/>

In early 1998, the ''Deus Ex'' team grew to 20 people and the game entered a 28-month production phase.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=50}} Spector hired new staff for his Austin studio, and was assigned an art team from Ion Storm's Dallas branch.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=53}} The development team consisted of three programmers, six designers, seven artists, a writer, an associate producer, a "tech", and Warren Spector, the producer and director. Two writers and four testers were hired as contractors.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=50}} Chris Norden was the lead programmer and assistant director, [[Harvey Smith (game designer)|Harvey Smith]] the lead designer, Jay Lee the lead artist, and Sheldon Pacotti the lead writer.<ref name="PC Zone: best ever"/> However, Spector's initial management structure, which involved two competing design teams and the [[matrix management]] of the Dallas art team, was a failure.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=56}} According to Spector, the team was interested in multiple video game genres, and it contained both design maximalists who wanted to "do everything" and design minimalists who wanted to do a few things well.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=53}} Close friends of the team who understood the intentions behind the game were invited to [[playtest]] and give feedback. The wide range of input led to debates in the office and changes to the game.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=53}} Spector later concluded that the team was "blinded by promises of complete creative freedom", and by their belief that the game would have no budget, marketing or time restraints.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=57}} By mid-1998, the game's title had become ''Deus Ex'', derived from the [[Latin]] [[literary device]] ''[[deus ex machina]]'' ("god from the machine") in which a plot is resolved by an unpredictable intervention.<ref name="RPGFan: machina"/> Spector acknowledged its grammatical faults as a title, but he liked it because of its relevance to the in-game struggle for power, to the medium's storytelling difficulties, to the game being played on a computer, and to the "self-referential" acceptance of trying one's best to resolve affairs.<ref name="RPGFan: machina"/>

Spector felt that the best aspects of ''Deus Ex''{{'}}s development were the "high-level vision" and length of preproduction, flexibility within the project, testable "proto-missions", and [[Unreal Engine]] license.{{sfn|Spector|2000|pp=52–55}} The team's pitfalls included the management structure, unrealistic goals, underestimating risks with [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]], their handling of proto-missions, and weakened morale from bad press.{{sfn|Spector|2000|pp=56–58}} He referred to that period of Ion Storm as "Sturm und Drang", because of the degree of hype and the vitriol following ''[[Daikatana]]''{{'s}} [[trash talk]] marketing, alongside negative press in 1998 and 1999.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=58}} He said that his Austin team had "frequent" slumps in morale from taking the company's coverage personally and seeing their private emails posted online.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=58}} Eventually, the ''Deus Ex'' Austin team developed a {{" '}}we'll show them' mentality" to distinguish their work and reputation from those of the Dallas branch.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=58}} ''Deus Ex'' was published by [[Eidos Interactive]] and released on June 23, 2000 for [[Microsoft Windows]]. The team planned third-party [[Porting#Porting in gaming|ports]] for [[Mac OS 9]] and [[Linux]].{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=50}}

=== Design ===

The original 1997 design document for ''Deus Ex'' privileges character development over all other features, including experimental sequences and technology demos.<ref name="USgamer: deleted scenes"/>{{clarify|date=July 2014}} The game was designed to be "genre-busting": in parts [[simulation game|simulation]], [[role-playing game]], [[first-person shooter]], and [[adventure game|adventure]].{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=50}} The team wanted players to consider "who they wanted to be" in the game, and for that to alter how they behaved in the game.<ref name="Gamasutra: postmortem p2"/> In this way, the game world was "deeply simulated", or realistic and believable enough that the player would solve problems in creative, [[Emergent gameplay|emergent]] ways without noticing distinct puzzles.<ref name="Gamasutra: postmortem p2"/> The developers also wanted to include "choice" and "consequence", which Spector called the team's "two most frequently uttered words".<ref name="Gamasutra: postmortem p2"/> However, the team's simulation ultimately failed to maintain the desired level of openness, and they had to [[:wikt:brute force|brute force]] "skill", "action", and "character interaction" paths through each level.<ref name="Gamasutra: postmortem p3"/> Playtesting also revealed that their idea of a role-playing game based in the real world was more interesting in theory than in reality.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=54}} The team chose two real-world bases for levels: "highly interconnected, multi-level" spaces, and places that most cannot visit (e.g., the [[White House]]).<ref name="Gamasutra: postmortem p2"/> In practice, the team found that certain aspects of the real world, such as hotels and office buildings, were not compelling in a game.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=54}} Ion Storm saw ''Deus Ex'' as being about "player expression" rather than making the developers appear "clever".{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=50}} They treated the player as a "collaborator", who they sought to empower to "make choices and ... deal with the consequences".{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=50}} Spector credited the 1995 [[role-playing video game]] ''[[Suikoden (video game)|Suikoden]]'' as an inspiration, stating that the limited [[Dialog tree|choices]] in ''Suikoden'' inspired him to expand on the idea with more meaningful choices in ''Deux Ex''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2012/11/10/how-suikoden-influenced-deus-ex-and-epic-mickey/|website=Siliconera|title=How Suikoden Influenced Deus Ex And Epic Mickey|date=November 10, 2012|author=Ishaan|accessdate=July 4, 2015}}</ref>

[[File:JFK limousine.png|thumb|The premise of ''Deus Ex'' was inspired by conspiracy theories such as those behind the JFK assassination]] The game's story changed greatly during production, but the idea of an augmented counterterrorist protagonist named JC Denton remained throughout.<ref name="USgamer: deleted scenes"/> Though Spector originally pictured ''Deus Ex'' as akin to ''The X-Files'', lead writer Sheldon Pacotti felt that it ended up more like [[James Bond]].<ref name="USgamer: deleted scenes"/> Spector wrote that the team overextended itself by planning highly elaborate scenes, including a replica of downtown Austin,{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=57}} a reconstruction of Area 51 from satellite data,<ref name="Gamasutra: postmortem p3"/> a sunken post-earthquake [[Los Angeles]], a raid to free thousands of [[prisoners of war]] from a [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]-controlled [[United Nations]] [[concentration camp]], and over 25 missions throughout Siberia, western Europe, and the United States.<ref name="Gamasutra: postmortem p3"/> Designer Harvey Smith pushed for the removal of a subplot in which Mexico invaded Texas, in order to make development easier and the narrative more personal. He also removed a largely complete White House level due to its complexity and production needs.{{efn|Spector referred to the White House as his "dream" level,<ref name="Gamasutra: postmortem p3"/> and their "toughest map challenge".{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=54}} }} Finished [[digital asset]]s were repurposed or, in the cases of Texas and the Denver airport, abandoned by the team. Pete Davison of USgamer referred to the White House and presidential bunker as "the truly deleted scenes of ''Deus Ex''{{'s}} lost levels".<ref name="USgamer: deleted scenes"/>

One of the things that Spector wanted to achieve in Deus Ex was to make JC Denton a cypher for the player, in order to create a better immersion and gameplay experience. He did not want the character to force any emotion so that whatever feelings the player may be experiencing comes from themselves rather than from JC Denton. To do this, Spector instructed voice actor [[Jay Anthony Franke]] to record his dialogue without any emotion but in a monotone voice, which is unusual for a voice acting role.<ref>{{cite web|last1=GameInformer|title=Replay - Deus Ex|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOPHmbulMp4|website=YouTube|accessdate=27 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Deus Ex|title=Let's Play Deus Ex with Warren Spector, Sheldon Pacotti and Chris Norden|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTVBSxnwiCo|website=YouTube|accessdate=27 July 2015}}</ref>

Once coded, the team's game systems did not work as intended. Prototypes of the systems and of certain missions were built near the beginning of development, which revealed some of the team's planning mistakes.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=53}} For example, the early tests of the conversation system and user interface were flawed, but the team had time to revise them before the game's release.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=57}} The team also found augmentations and skills to be less interesting than they had seemed in the design document.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=53}} Colleagues from other companies—such as [[Doug Church]], [[Rob Fermier]], [[Marc LeBlanc]], and [[Gabe Newell]]—noticed and pointed out these deficiencies in game "tension" when they played the prototype.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=54}} In response, Harvey Smith substantially revised the augmentations and skills.<ref name="Gamasutra: postmortem p3"/> [[Milestone (project management)|Production milestones]] served as wake-up calls for the game's direction. A May 1998 milestone that called for a functional demo revealed that the size of the game's maps caused [[Frame rate#Video games|frame rate]] issues, which was one of the first signs that maps needed to be cut.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=54}} A year later, the team reached a milestone for finished game systems that Spector nicknamed the "Wow, these missions suck" milestone, which led to better estimates for their future mission work and to the reduction of the 500-page design document to 270 pages.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=54}} Spector recalled Smith's mantra on this point: "less is more". {{sfn|Spector|2000|pp=54–55}}

One of the team's biggest blind spots was the AI programming for NPCs. Spector wrote that they considered it in preproduction, but that they did not figure out how to handle it until "relatively late in development".{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=57}} This led to wasted time when the team had to discard their early AI code. The team built atop their [[game engine]]'s shooter-based AI instead of writing new code that would allow characters to exhibit convincing emotions. As a result, NPC behavior was variable until the very end of development. Spector felt that the team's "sin" was their inconsistent display of a trustable "human AI".{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=57}}

=== Technology ===

[[File:Unreal Engine logo and wordmark.png|thumb|100px|left|''Deus Ex'' used the [[Unreal Engine|Unreal game engine]], which was designed for first-person shooters]] The game was developed on systems including dual-processor [[Pentium Pro]] 200s and [[Athlon]] 800s with eight and nine gigabyte hard drives, some using [[SCSI]]. The team used "more than 100 video cards" throughout development.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=50}} ''Deus Ex'' was built using [[Visual Studio]], [[Lightwave]], and [[Lotus Notes]]. They also built a custom dialogue editor, ConEdit.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=50}} The team used [[UnrealEd]] atop the Unreal game engine for map design, which Spector wrote was "superior to anything else available".{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=55}} Their trust in [[UnrealScript]] led them to code "special-cases" for their immediate mission needs instead of more generalized multi-case code.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=57}} Even as concerned team members expressed misgivings, the team only addressed this later in the project. To Spector, this was a lesson to always prefer "general solutions" over "special casing", such that the tool set works predictably.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=57}}

They waited to license a game engine until after preproduction,{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=52}} expecting the benefits of licensing to be more time for the content and gameplay, which Spector reported to be the case. They chose the Unreal engine as it did 80% of what they needed from an engine and was more economical than building from scratch. Their small programming team allowed for a larger design group. The programmers also found the engine accommodating,{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=55}} though it took about nine months to acclimate to the software.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=53}} Spector felt that they would have understood the code better had they built it themselves, instead of "treating the engine as a [[black box]]" and coding conservatively.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=55}} He acknowledged that this precipitated into the [[Direct3D]] issues in their final release, which slipped through their quality assurance testing.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=55}} Spector also noted that the artificial intelligence, pathfinding, and sound propagation were designed for shooters and should have been rewritten from scratch instead of relying on the engine. He thought the licensed engine worked well enough that he expected to use the same for [[Deus Ex: Invisible War|the game's sequel]] and ''[[Thief 3]]''.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=56}} He added that developers should not attempt to force their technology to perform in ways it was not intended, and should find a balance between perfection and pragmatism.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=57}}

A compact disc of the ''Deus Ex'' soundtrack was included in the ''Game of the Year'' edition and is not available for separate purchase. Notably, the soundtrack is not a direct audio [[Game rip (audio)|rip]] from the game itself, however; it is a "[[remaster]]ing" of the soundtrack with added instruments and audio production.

== Release ==
''Deus Ex'' has been re-released in several iterations since its original publication, and has also been the basis of a number of [[mod (computer gaming)|mods]] developed by its fan community.

The ''Deus Ex: Game of the Year Edition'', which was released on May 8, 2001,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/deus-ex-game-of-the-year-edition-ships/1100-2716914/|title=Deus Ex: Game of the Year Edition ships|first=Trey|last=Walker|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=8 May 2001|accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref> contains the latest game [[patch (computing)|updates]] and a [[software development kit]], a separate [[soundtrack]] [[Compact Disc|CD]], and a page from a fictional newspaper featured prominently in ''Deus Ex'' titled ''The Midnight Sun'', which recounts recent events in the game's world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bluesnews.com/a/125 |title=Eidos Announces Deus Ex "Game of the Year" Edition}}</ref> However, later releases of said version do not include the soundtrack CD, and contain a [[PDF]] version of the newspaper on the game's disc.

The [[Macintosh]] version of the game, released shortly after the PC version, was shipped with the same capabilities and can also be patched to enable multiplayer support.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/5553/deus-ex-multiplayer-patch |title=Deus Ex Multiplayer Patch 1.0.3 |work=Mac Update |accessdate=March 10, 2007}}</ref> However, [[Video game publisher|publisher]] [[Aspyr Media]] did not release any subsequent editions of the game or any additional patches. As such, the game is only supported in [[Mac OS 9]] and the "Classic" environment in [[Mac OS X]], neither of which are compatible with [[Intel]]-based Macs. The PC version will run on Intel-based Macs using Crossover, [[Boot Camp (software)|Boot Camp]], or other software to enable a compatible version of Microsoft Windows to run on a Mac.

A [[PlayStation 2]] port of the game, renamed ''Deus Ex: The Conspiracy'' (although kept as ''Deus Ex'' in Europe) was released on March 26, 2002.<ref name="GameSpot PS2 news" /><ref name="IGN PS2 news" /> Along with pre-rendered introductory and ending cinematics that replaced the original versions, it features a simplified interface with optional [[auto aim]] and [[motion capture]]d [[3d modeling|character models]]. There are many minor changes in level design, some for the purpose of balancing gameplay, but most to accommodate loading transition areas,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.neoseeker.com/Games/Products/PS2/DeusEx/ |title=Deus Ex: The Conspiracy: Features |work=Neoseeker |accessdate=December 15, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.gamespy.com/reviews/april02/deusexps2/index.shtm |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/64z2t5Xdf |archivedate=2012-01-26 |title=Deus Ex: The Conspiracy (PS2) Review (Page 1) |work=Gamespy |last=Buecheler |first=Christopher |accessdate=December 15, 2006}}</ref> due to the memory limitations of the PlayStation 2.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.gamespy.com/reviews/april02/deusexps2/index2.shtm |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080216164014/http://archive.gamespy.com/reviews/april02/deusexps2/index2.shtm |archivedate=2008-02-16 |title=Deus Ex: The Conspiracy (PS2) Review (Page 2) |work=Gamespy |last=Buecheler |first=Christopher |accessdate=December 15, 2006}}</ref> The PlayStation 2 version was rereleased in Europe on the [[PlayStation 3]] as a [[List of PlayStation 2 Classics|PlayStation 2 Classic]] on May 16, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Michael|title=Deus Ex Original Coming To PS3|url=http://www.sticktwiddlers.com/2012/05/10/deus-ex-original-coming-to-ps3/|website=StickTwiddlers|accessdate=2015-07-16|date=2012-05-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828062456/http://sticktwiddlers.com/2012/05/10/deus-ex-original-coming-to-ps3/|archivedate=2012-08-28}}</ref>

[[Loki Software|Loki Games]] worked on a [[Linux]] version of the game, but the company went out of business before releasing it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lokigames.com/ |title=Loki Games official website |work=Loki Games |accessdate=March 20, 2007}}</ref> The [[OpenGL]] layer they wrote for the port however was sent out to Windows gamers through an online patch, which also makes the game far more compatible with [[Wine (software)|Wine]] on Linux than it would have been with only [[Direct3D]].

Though their quality assurance did not see major Direct3D issues, players noted "dramatic slowdowns" immediately following launch, and the team did not understand the "black box" of the Unreal engine well enough to make it do exactly what they needed.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=55}} Spector characterized ''Deus Ex'' reviews into two categories based on how they begin with either how "Warren Spector makes games all by himself" or that "''Deus Ex'' couldn't possibly have been made by Ion Storm".{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=58}} He has said that the game won over 30 "best of" awards in 2001,<ref name="PC Zone: best ever"/> and concluded that their final game was not perfect, but that they were much closer for having tried to "do things right or not at all".{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=58}}

''Deus Ex'' is built on [[Unreal Engine]], previous games of which saw active community involvement in modding.<ref name="GameSpy">{{cite web |url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/november00/deusexmods/index.shtm |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20041222191225/http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/november00/deusexmods/index.shtm |archivedate=2004-12-22 |title=Deus Ex Mods |first=Bruce |last=Ladewig |work=[[GameSpy]] |date=December 2004 |accessdate=July 16, 2011}}</ref> On September 20, 2000, Eidos Interactive and Ion Storm announced in a press release that they would be releasing the [[software development kit]] (SDK).<!--PressRelease--> According to the announcement, the SDK includes all the tools used to create the original game.<!--PressRelease--> Several team members as well as project director Warren Spector said that they were "really looking forward to seeing what [the community] does with our tools".<ref name="PressRelease">{{cite press release |url=http://www.bluesnews.com/a/72 |title=Eidos Announces Deus Ex SDK |date=September 20, 2000 |publisher=[[Eidos Interactive]] |accessdate=July 16, 2011}}</ref> The kit was released on September 22, 2000,<ref name="IgnRelease">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/09/22/deus-ex-sdk-on-schedule-for-september-22nd-release |title=Deus Ex SDK On Schedule for September 22nd Release |work=[[IGN]] |date=September 21, 2000 |accessdate=July 16, 2011}}</ref> and soon gathered community interest, followed by release of tutorials, small mods, up to announcements of large mods and conversions.<!--GameSpy--> While ION Storm did not hugely alter the engine's rendering and core functionality, they introduced [[role-playing video game|role-playing]] elements.<ref name="GameSpy"/>

In 2009, a fan-made mod called ''[[The Nameless Mod]]'' (''TNM'') was released by Off Topic Productions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thenamelessmod.com/real/ |title=The Nameless Mod|publisher=TNM - OTP|accessdate=August 30, 2009 }}</ref> The game's protagonist is a user of an Internet forum, with digital places represented as physical locations. The mod offers roughly the same amount of gameplay as Deus Ex and adds several new features to the game, with a more open world structure than ''Deus Ex'' and new weapons such as the player character's fists. The mod was developed over 7 years and has thousands of lines of recorded dialogue and two different parallel story arcs. Upon its release, ''TNM'' earned a 9/10 overall from ''PCPowerPlay'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcpowerplay.com.au/content/ |title=PC Power Play |accessdate=August 30, 2009 |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20090609094742/http://www.pcpowerplay.com.au/content/ <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archivedate=June 9, 2009 }}</ref> In [[ModDB]]'s 2009 Mod of the Year awards, ''The Nameless Mod'' won the Editor's Choice award for Best Singleplayer Mod.<ref name="moddb">{{cite web |url=http://www.moddb.com/mods/the-nameless-mod/features/best-singleplayer-mod-2009 |title=Editors Choice - Best Singleplayer Mod |accessdate=2010-02-18 |work=ModDB }}</ref>

In 2015, during the 15th anniversary of the game's release, [[Square Enix]] (who had acquired Eidos earlier) endorsed a free fan-created mod, ''Deus Ex: Revision'' which was released through Steam. The mod, created by Caustic Creative, is a graphical overhaul of the original game, adding in support for newer versions of [[DirectX]], improving the textures and the soundtrack from the original game, and adding in more world-building aesthetics but without altering gameplay.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2015/10/13/9521787/deus-ex-revision-free-mod-steam | title = Original Deus Ex gets a facelift with free mod | first = Allega | last = Frank | date = October 13, 2015 | accessdate = October 13, 2015 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref>

''Deus Ex'' received critical acclaim, attaining a score of 90 out of 100 from 28 critics on [[Metacritic]].<ref name="metacritic" /> Thierry Nguyen from [[Computer Gaming World]] said that the game "delivers moments of brilliance, idiocy, ingenuity, and frustration."<ref name="CGW">{{cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.com/cgw/stories/main/0,11529,2617806,00.html |title=ZDNet: Computer Gaming World: Reviews: They're Out to Get Me |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010210105348/www.zdnet.com/cgw/stories/main/0,11529,2617806,00.html |archivedate=2001-02-10 |last=Nguyen |first=Thierry |date=2000-09-05 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |work=[[Computer Gaming World]] |accessdate=2014-07-13}}</ref> [[Computer Games Magazine]] praised the title for its deep gameplay and its use of multiple solutions to situations in the game.<ref name="CGM">{{cite web |url=http://www.cgonline.com/reviews/deusex-01-r1.html |title=CG Online -- Deus Ex Review |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040813083455/www.cgonline.com/reviews/deusex-01-r1.html |archivedate=2004-08-13 |last=Cross |first=Jason |work=[[Computer Games Magazine]] |accessdate=2014-07-13}}</ref>

Former [[GameSpot]] reviewer [[Greg Kasavin]], though awarding the game a score of 8.2 of 10, was disappointed by the security and lockpicking mechanics. "Such instances are essentially noninteractive", he wrote. "You simply stand there and spend a particular quantity of electronic picks or modules until the door opens or the security goes down."<ref name="gamespot" /> Kasavin made similar complaints about the hacking interface, noting that, "Even with basic hacking skills, you'll still be able to bypass the encryption and password protection ... by pressing the 'hack' button and waiting a few seconds."<ref name="gamespot" />

The game's graphics and sounds were also met with muted enthusiasm. Kasavin complained of ''Deus Ex''{{'}}s relatively sub-par graphics, blaming them on the game's "incessantly dark industrial environments."<ref name="gamespot" /> [[GamePro]] reviewer Chris Patterson took time to note that despite being "solid acoustically," ''Deus Ex'' had moments of weakness.<ref name="GameProRev">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamepro.com/computer/pc/games/reviews/6030.shtml |title=Deus Ex for PC on GamePro.com |accessdate=2007-11-07 |last=Patterson |first=Chris |work=[[GamePro]] |publisher=[[GamePro]] |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110607145334/http://www.gamepro.com/computer/pc/games/reviews/6030.shtml|archivedate=2011-06-07}}</ref> He poked fun at JC's "[[Joe Friday]], 'just the facts, deadpan," and the "truly cheesy accents" of minor characters in Hong Kong and New York City. [[IGN]] called the graphics "blocky", adding that "the animation is stiff, and the [[dithering]] is just plain awful in some spots," referring to the limited capabilities of the Unreal Engine used to design the game. the website later on stated that "overall Deus Ex certainly looks better than your average game."<ref name="IGNRev">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/06/28/deus-ex-3 |title=Deus Ex Review  |date=2000-06-27 |accessdate=2007-11-06 |last=Blevins |first=Tal |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=IGN }}</ref>

Reviewers and players also complained about the size of ''Deus Ex''{{'}}s save files. An Adrenaline Vault reviewer noted that, "Playing through the entire adventure, [he] accumulated over 250MB of save game data, with the average file coming in at over 15MB."<ref name="adrenalinevault">{{cite web |url=http://www.avault.com/reviews/pc/deus-ex-pc-review/ |title=Deus Ex review |work=Adrenaline Vault |author=Harding, Chris |accessdate=2006-12-18}}</ref>

The game developed a strong cult following, leading to a core modding and playing community that is still active over 15 years after its release. In an interview with IGN in July 2015, game director Warren Spector said he never expected ''Deus Ex'' to sell many copies, but he did expect it to become a cult classic among a smaller strong community, and he continues to receive fan mail from players to date regarding their experiences and thoughts about ''Deus Ex''.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

A film adaptation based on the game was originally announced in May 2002 by [[Columbia Pictures]]. The film was being produced by [[Laura Ziskin]], along with Greg Pruss attached with writing the screenplay. Peter Schlessel, president of production for Columbia Pictures, and Paul Baldwin, president of marketing for Eidos Interactive, stated that they were confident in that the adaptation would be a successful development for both the studios and the franchise.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://megagames.com/movies/columbia-make-deus-ex-movie |title=Megagames Article on Movie |work=Megagames}}</ref> In March 2003, during an interview with Greg Pruss, he informed IGN that the character of JC Denton will be "a little bit filthier than he was in the game."

A sequel to the game, entitled ''[[Deus Ex: Invisible War]]'', was released in the United States on December 2, 2003, and then in Europe in early 2004 for both the PC and the Xbox game console.

After the commercial performance and public reception of ''Deus Ex: Invisible War'' failed to meet expectations, the decision was made to set the game in its own universe, and ''Deus Ex: Clan Wars'' was eventually published under the title ''[[Project Snowblind|Project: Snowblind]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/snowblind-was-deus-ex-clan-wars-6100820 |title=Snowblind was Deus Ex: Clan Wars |work=Gamespot |last=Thorsen |first=Tor |accessdate=March 20, 2007}}</ref>
