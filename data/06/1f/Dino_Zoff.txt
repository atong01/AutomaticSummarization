'''Dino Zoff''' ({{IPA-it|ˈdiːno dˈdzɔff}}; born 28 February 1942) is an [[Italians|Italian]] former [[Goalkeeper (association football)|football goalkeeper]] and is the oldest winner ever of the [[Football World Cup|World Cup]], which he earned as captain of the [[Italy national football team|Italian national team]] in the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 tournament]] in Spain, at the age of 40 years, 4 months and 13 days, also winning the award for best [[FIFA World Cup awards|goalkeeper of the tournament]], and being elected to the team of the tournament, for his performances, keeping two clean-sheets, an honour he also received after winning the [[1968 UEFA European Championship|1968 European Championship]] on home soil. Zoff also achieved great club success with Juventus, winning 6 [[Serie A]] titles, 2 [[Coppa Italia]]s, and an [[1976-77 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], also reaching two [[UEFA Champions League|European Champions' Cup]] finals in the [[1972-73 European Cup|1972–73]] and [[1982-83 European Cup|1982–83]] seasons, as well as finishing second in the [[1973 Intercontinental Cup|1973 Intercontinental Cup final]].

Zoff was a goalkeeper of outstanding ability, and he has a place in the history of the sport among the very best in this role,<ref>{{cite web|title=Dino Zoff|url=http://www.planetworldcup.com/LEGENDS/zoff.html|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref> being named the 3rd greatest [[IFFHS World's Best Goalkeeper#Goalkeeper of the Century|goalkeeper of the 20th century]] by the [[IFFHS]] behind [[Lev Yashin]] and [[Gordon Banks]].<ref name=rsssf.com>[http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/iffhs-century.html IFFHS' Century Elections] – rsssf.com – by Karel Stokkermans, RSSSF.</ref> As a keeper, Zoff was particularly known for his outstanding positioning, handling, reactions, leadership, and organisational skills, as well as concentration, consistency, and calm mindset.<ref>{{cite web|title=DINO ZOFF.|url=http://www.mariocapece.it/toptenportieri.html|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref> He holds the record for the longest playing time without allowing goals in international tournaments (1142 minutes) set between 1972 and 1974. With 112 caps, he is the fifth most capped player for the ''[[Italy national football team|Azzurri]]''. In 2004 [[Pelé]] named him as one of the [[FIFA 100|125 greatest living footballers]]. In the same year, Zoff placed fifth in the [[UEFA Golden Jubilee Poll]], and was elected as [[UEFA Jubilee Awards|Italy's golden player of the past 50 years]]. He also placed second in the [[Ballon d'Or 1973|1973 Ballon d'or]], as he narrowly missed out on a [[Treble (association football)|treble]] with Juventus. In 1999, Zoff was placed 47th in [[World Soccer magazine|World Soccer Magazine's]] ''100 Greatest Players of the Twentieth Century''.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Soccer Players of the Century|url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamHons/HonsWldSocPlyrsCent.html|accessdate=5 January 2015}}</ref>

After retiring as a footballer, Zoff went on to become coach for the [[Italy national football team|Italian national team]], with which he reached the [[UEFA Euro 2000 Final|Euro 2000 Final]], and several other Italian clubs, including his former club [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], with which he won an [[UEFA Cup 1989-90|UEFA Cup]] and a [[Coppa Italia 1989-90|Coppa Italia]] double during the [[1989-90 Serie A|1989–90 season]], trophies he had also won as a player. In September 2014, Zoff published his Italian autobiography ''Dura Solo un Attimo la Gloria'' ("Glory only Lasts a Moment").<ref>{{cite web|title=Calcio, Zoff si inventa scrittore: "Dura solo un attimo la gloria"|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/22-09-2014/zoff-si-inventa-scrittore-dura-solo-attimo-gloria-90524322651.shtml|accessdate=5 January 2015}}</ref>

==Playing career==

===Club===
Dino Zoff was born in [[Mariano del Friuli]], [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]], [[Italy]], and was elected in a poll by the [[International Federation of Football History & Statistics|IFFHS]] as the third best [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] of the 20th Century – after [[Lev Yashin]] (1st) and [[Gordon Banks]] (2nd).<ref name=rsssf.com/>

Zoff's career got off to an inauspicious start, when at the age of fourteen he had trials with [[Inter Milan]] and [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], but was rejected due to a lack of height. Five years later, having grown by 33 centimetres, he made his [[Serie A]] debut with [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]] on 24 September 1961, in a 5–2 defeat to [[AC Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], although Zoff was not criticised for any of the goals he conceded. Zoff made only four appearances in his [[Serie A 1961-62|first season]] for Udinese, as they were relegated to [[Serie B]]. He played the [[Serie B 1962-63|next season]] as the club's starting goalkeeper, helping the club to [[Serie A 1963-64|Serie A promotion]], before moving to [[Mantova F.C.|Mantova]] in 1963, where he spent four seasons, making 131 appearances.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dino Zoff|url=http://www.uniparmaclub.it/ita/campioni/Dino%20Zoff.pdf|accessdate=5 January 2015}}</ref> In 1967, Zoff was transferred to [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]], where he spent five seasons, making 143 Serie A appearances with the club. During this time, he began to achieve notable recognition in Italy, also making his International debut with the [[Italy national football team|Italian national side]] in 1968, and earning a place in Italy's squads at [[UEFA Euro 1968|Euro 68]] and the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]].

Following his achievements with the national side, and due to his performances during his time with Napoli, Zoff signed for [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in 1972, where he resumed his success. In eleven years with Juventus, Zoff won the [[Serie A]] championship six times, the [[Coppa Italia]] twice and the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] once, also reaching two [[European cup finals|European Cup finals]], and the semi-finals of the [[European Cup Winners' Cup 1979–80|European Cup Winners' Cup]] during the 1979–80 season. In 1973, he placed second in the [[Ballon d'Or 1973|Ballon d'Or]], following his [[Serie A 1972-73|Serie A title]] victory, also narrowly missing out on an historical [[Treble (association football)|treble]] with Juventus, after reaching both the [[European Cup 1972-73|European Cup]] and the [[Coppa Italia]] finals that season, in which his club were defeated, however; Juventus also finished as runners-up in the [[1973 Intercontinental Cup]] that year. Overall, Zoff made 479 appearances for [[Juventus F.C. statistics and records|Juventus]] in all competitions, making 330 [[Serie A]] appearances with the club, 74 in the [[Coppa Italia]], 71 in [[UEFA club competitions|European Competitions]], and 4 in other Club Competitions. He is currently [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus's]] 6th record appearance holder in all competitions their 7th all-time appearance holder in Serie A, their 3rd all-time appearance holder in the Coppa Italia, their 7th all-time appearance holder in [[Juventus F.C. in European football|UEFA Club competitions]], and their 9th all-time appearance holder in international club competitions.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/players/player=44786/quotes.html|title=Classic Football: Dino Zoff – I was there| publisher= FIFA Official Site}}</ref>

Zoff won his final Serie A championship with Juventus during the [[1981-82 Serie A]] season, also winning the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] with [[Italy national football team|Italy]] that year, as his team's captain. During the following [[1982-83 Serie A|1982–83]] season, the final season of his career, Dino Zoff won the [[Coppa Italia]] with [[Serie A 1981-82|defending Serie A champions]] Juventus, and he reached his second [[1983 European Cup Final|European Cup final]] with the club, only to be defeated 1–0 by [[Hamburger SV|Hamburg]]. Upon retirement, he held the records for the oldest [[Football records in Italy|Serie A]] player, at the age of 41, and the most [[Serie A]] appearances (570 matches) for more than 20 years, until the [[2005–06 Serie A|2005–06 season]], when the records were broken by [[S.S. Lazio]] goalkeeper [[Marco Ballotta]], and [[A.C. Milan]] defender [[Paolo Maldini]] respectively. Behind only former A.C. Milan goalkeeper [[Sebastiano Rossi]], Zoff has [[Football records in Italy|conceded the fewest goals in a single Serie A season]], and he has also gone the [[Football records in Italy|most time unbeaten in Serie A]] without conceding a goal, going unbeated for 903 minutes, once again, behind Sebastiano Rossi. With 570 Serie A appearances, Zoff is also the [[Football records in Italy|fourth highest appearance holder in Serie A]] of all time, and he is the fourth oldest player in Serie A to have ever played a match.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

===International===
Zoff had won a gold medal with the Italy under-23 side at the [[1963 Mediterranean Games]]. On 20 April 1968, Zoff made his senior debut for [[Italy national football team|Italy]], playing in a 2–0 win against [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] in the quarter finals of the [[UEFA Euro 1968|1968 European Championships]], in Naples.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nazionale in cifre: Zoff, Dino|url=http://www.figc.it/nazionali/DettaglioConvocato?codiceConvocato=1096&squadra=1|website=http://www.figc.it/|publisher=FIGC|accessdate=27 April 2015|language=Italian}}</ref> Zoff ended up being promoted to starting goalkeeper over [[Enrico Albertosi]] during the tournament, and Italy proceeded to win the European Championship on home soil, with Zoff taking home a winners' medal after only his fourth international appearance, keeping two clean sheets, and winning the award for the best goalkeeper of the tournament. Zoff was left out of the Italian starting eleven in the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]], however, and was [[Enrico Albertosi|Albertosi's]] deputy throughout the tournament, as Italy went on to reach the [[1970 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] of the World Cup, only to be defeated 4–1 by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. He returned to the starting line-up, however, ahead of Albertosi, in Italy's disappointing [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]] campaign, during which they would be eliminated in the first round.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

From 1972 onwards, Zoff became Italy's undisputed number 1, and he participated in the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]] with Italy, during which he managed a fourth-place finish, keeping 3 clean-sheets. Italy were eliminated in the semi-final, in a 2–1 loss to the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]. After the match, Zoff was criticised for making a fairly uncommon error, as he was beaten by a strike from distance by [[Arie Haan]].<ref name="autogenerated1"/> Zoff was also Italy's starting goalkeeper once again at the [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980 European Championships]] on home soil, however, helping his side to reach the semi-finals, finishing the tournament in fourth place once again. During the 1980 European Championship, Zoff kept three clean sheets, only conceding one goal in the bronze medal match, which Italy would lose on penalties; Zoff was elected as the goalkeeper of the tournament once again, an honour he had previously managed after winning the tournament in 1968. Throughout these two tournaments, Zoff established a record for most consecutive minutes unbeaten in a [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]], which was later beaten by [[Iker Casillas]] in [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012]]. Zoff had also established the record for most minutes unbeaten European Championship qualifying, which was also beaten, by compatriot [[Gianluigi Buffon|Buffon]] in [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying|2011]].

Zoff's greatest feat, however, came in the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]], where he captained Italy to victory in the tournament at the age of 40, making him the oldest ever winner of the World Cup, keeping 2 clean sheets.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/world/2002/world_cup/hof/zoff/ World Cup Hall of Fame: Dino Zoff] – www.sportillustrated.cnn.com</ref> He followed in the footsteps of compatriot [[Gianpiero Combi]] ([[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]]) as only the second goalkeeper to captain a World Cup-winning side (later [[Iker Casillas]] repeated this [[History of the FIFA World Cup#Winning teams, captains, and managers|feat]] for Spain in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]]). He was also voted as the [[World Cup Golden Glove|Best Goalkeeper of the Tournament]]. His manager [[Enzo Bearzot]] said:<ref name="autogenerated1"/>
{{Quote|"He was a level-headed goalkeeper, capable of staying calm during the toughest and the most exhilarating moments. He always held back both out of modesty and respect for his opponents. At the end of the Brazil match, he came over to give me a kiss on the cheek, without saying a single word. For me, that fleeting moment was the most intense of the entire World Cup."}}

Zoff also holds the record for the longest stretch (1142 minutes) without allowing any goals in international football, set between 1972 and 1974. That clean sheet stretch was ended by Haitian player [[Emmanuel Sanon|Manno Sanon]]'s beautiful goal during the 1974 World Cup. Zoff made his final appearance for Italy on 29 May 1983, in a 2–0 away loss to [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], in an [[UEFA Euro 1984 qualifying|Euro 1984 qualifying match]]. At the time of his retirement, Zoff's 112 caps were the most ever by a member of the Italian national team. He currently sits in fifth place in this category, as well as second among goalkeepers, [[Gianluigi Buffon]] having surpassed the latter record.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

==Coaching career==
After his retirement as a player, Zoff went into coaching, joining the technical staff at Juventus, where he was head coach from 1988 to 1990. In 1990 he was sacked, despite winning the [[UEFA Cup 1989-90|UEFA Cup]] and the [[Coppa Italia 1989-90|Coppa Italia]] during the 1989–90 season. He then joined [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]], where he became the coach in 1994, and later the club's sporting director, winning the [[Coppa Italia]] in [[1997–98 Coppa Italia|1998]], and helping the club to an [[UEFA Cup 1997-98|UEFA Cup]] final the same season, only to be defeated by compatriots [[Internazionale Milano F.C.|Inter]].

In 1998, Zoff was appointed as the head coach of the Italian national team. Although Italy were still cautious and organised defensively, Zoff used a more open, fluid, and attacking style of play than that used by his more defensive Italian coaching predecessors [[Cesare Maldini]] and [[Arrigo Sacchi]]. Zoff helped the team to [[UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying|qualify for Euro 2000]], and he introduced several younger players to the team, such as [[Francesco Totti]], [[Gianluca Zambrotta]], [[Stefano Fiore]], [[Massimo Ambrosini]], [[Christian Abbiati]], [[Marco Delvecchio]], and [[Vincenzo Montella]]. Although Italy were not favourites, he coached a young Italy squad to a second-place finish in [[2000 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2000]], suffering a 2–1 extra-time defeat at the hands of reigning [[FIFA World Cup 1998|World Cup Champions]] [[France national football team|France]] in the [[UEFA Euro 2000 Final|final]], due to a golden goal by [[David Trezeguet]]. En route to the final, a ten-man Italy had eliminated co-hosts the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in the semi-finals in a penalty shoot-out, after a hard-fought 0–0 draw, following extra-time. In the final of the tournament, Italy had been 1–0 up for most of the second half, and were less than sixty seconds away from winning the tournament, before France forward [[Sylvain Wiltord]] scored in the fourth and final minute of stoppage time to equalise, and send the match into extra time. Despite reaching the final, Zoff resigned a few days later, following strong criticism from [[A.C. Milan]] president and [[Forza Italia|politician]] [[Silvio Berlusconi]]. Zoff was voted the [[World Soccer (magazine)|World Soccer]] Manager of the Year in 2000.

Zoff returned to defending [[1999–2000 Serie A|Serie A]], [[Coppa Italia 1999-2000|Coppa Italia]], and [[2000 Supercoppa Italiana|Supercoppa Italiana]] champions Lazio as a manager for the next season, replacing [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] in 2001, and finishing third in [[Serie A 2000-01|Serie A]]. He resigned on 20 September, following a poor start to the [[2001–02 Serie A|2001–02 season]]. In [[Serie A 2004-05|2005]], he was named the coach of [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] as a replacement for [[Sergio Buso]]. Despite saving the team from [[relegation]] on the last day of the season, Zoff was let go at the end of the season.
