At a boat party in Germany he made his advance by offering her a bunch of grapes.

He left it in disgust after seeing one of the masters lampooned, and went to live with his mother. But by that time she had already opened her famous salon, and Arthur was not compatible with what he considered to be the vain, ceremonious ways of the salon. He was also disgusted by the ease with which Johanna Schopenhauer had forgotten his father's memory. Consequently, he attempted university life. There, he wrote his first book,<space/><italics><link><target>On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason</target></link></italics>. His mother informed him that the book was incomprehensible and it was unlikely that anyone would ever buy a copy.

A temporary way to escape this pain is through aesthetic contemplation (a method comparable to<space/><link><target>Zapffe</target></link>'s &quot;<italics>Sublimation</italics>&quot;). Aesthetic contemplation allows one to escape this painalbeit temporarilybecause it stops one perceiving the world as mere presentation. Instead, one no longer perceives the world as an object of perception (therefore as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds; time, space and causality) from which one is separated; rather one becomes one with that perception: &quot;<italics>one can thus no longer separate the perceiver from the perception</italics>&quot; (<italics>The World as Will and Representation</italics>, section 34). From this immersion with the world one no longer views oneself as an individual who suffers in the world due to one's individual will but, rather, becomes a &quot;<italics>subject of cognition</italics>&quot; to a perception that is &quot;<italics>Pure, will-less, timeless</italics>&quot; (section 34) where the essence, &quot;ideas,&quot; of the world are shown. Art is the practical consequence of this brief aesthetic contemplation as it attempts to depict one's immersion with the world, thus tries to depict the essence/pure ideas of the world. Music, for Schopenhauer, was the purest form of art because it was the one that depicted the will itself without it appearing as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds, therefore as an individual object. According to Daniel Albright, &quot;Schopenhauer thought that<space/><link><target>philosophy of music</target><part>music</part></link><space/>was the only art that did not merely copy ideas, but actually embodied the will itself.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>Daniel Albright, Modernism and Music, 2004, page 39, footnote 34</extension></paragraph><paragraph>He deemed music to be a timeless, universal language which is comprehended everywhere, and can imbue global enthusiasm, if in possession of a significant melody.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Music"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last">Schopenhauer</arg><arg name="first">Arthur</arg><arg name="title">Essays and Aphorisms</arg><arg name="year">1970</arg><arg name="publisher">Penguin Classics</arg><arg name="location">'10'</arg><arg name="isbn">0-14-044227-8</arg><arg name="pages">162</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Mathematics</heading><paragraph>Schopenhauer's<space/><link><target>Philosophy of mathematics#Mathematical realism</target><part>realist</part></link><space/>views on mathematics are evident in his criticism of the contemporary attempts to prove the<space/><link><target>parallel postulate</target></link><space/>in<space/><link><target>Euclidean geometry</target></link>.

The noumenon was what Kant called the<space/><italics>Ding an sich</italics><space/>(the Thing in Itself), the reality that is the foundation of our<space/><link><target>sense</target><part>sensory</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>mind</target><part>mental</part></link><space/>representations of an external world. In Kantian terms, those sensory and mental representations are mere phenomena. Schopenhauer departed from Kant in his description of the relationship between the phenomenon and the noumenon. According to Kant, things-in-themselves ground the phenomenal representations in our minds; Schopenhauer, on the other hand, believed phenomena and noumena to be two different sides of the same coin. Noumena do not<space/><italics>cause</italics><space/>phenomena, but rather phenomena are simply the way by which our minds perceive the noumena, according to the<space/><link><target>principle of sufficient reason</target></link>. This is explained more fully in Schopenhauer's doctoral thesis,<space/><italics><link><target>On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason</target></link></italics>.</paragraph><paragraph>Schopenhauer's second major departure from Kant's epistemology concerns the body. Kant's philosophy was formulated as a response to the radical<space/><link><target>philosophical skepticism</target></link><space/>of David Hume, who claimed that causality could not be observed empirically. Schopenhauer begins by arguing that Kant's demarcation between external objects, knowable only as phenomena, and the Thing in Itself of noumenon, contains a significant omission. There is, in fact, one physical object we know more intimately than we know any object of sense perception: our own body.</paragraph><paragraph>We know our<space/><link><target>human anatomy</target><part>human bodies</part></link><space/>have boundaries and occupy space, the same way other objects known only through our named senses do. Though we seldom think of our body as a physical object, we know even before reflection that it shares some of an object's properties. We understand that a watermelon cannot successfully occupy the same space as an oncoming truck; we know that if we tried to repeat the experiment with our own body, we would obtain similar results we know this even if we do not understand the<space/><link><target>physics</target></link><space/>involved.</paragraph><paragraph>We know that our consciousness inhabits a physical body, similar to other physical objects only known as phenomena. Yet our consciousness is not commensurate with our body. Most of us possess the power of voluntary motion. We usually are not aware of the breathing of our<space/><link><target>human lung</target><part>lungs</part></link><space/>or the beating of our<space/><link><target>human heart</target><part>heart</part></link><space/>unless somehow our attention is called to them. Our ability to control either is limited. Our<space/><link><target>kidney</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>command our attention on their schedule rather than one we choose. Few of us have any idea what our<space/><link><target>liver</target></link><space/>is doing right now, though this organ is as needful as lungs, heart, or kidneys. The conscious mind is the servant, not the master, of these and other organs; these organs have an agenda which the conscious mind did not choose, and over which it has limited power.</paragraph><paragraph>When Schopenhauer identifies the<space/><italics>noumenon</italics><space/>with the desires, needs, and impulses in us that we name &quot;will,&quot; what he is saying is that we participate in the reality of an otherwise unachievable world outside the mind through will. We cannot<space/><italics>prove</italics><space/>that our mental picture of an outside world corresponds with a reality by reasoning; through will, we know without thinking that the world can stimulate us. We suffer fear, or desire: these states arise involuntarily; they arise prior to reflection; they arise even when the conscious mind would prefer to hold them at bay. The rational mind is, for Schopenhauer, a leaf borne along in a stream of pre-reflective and largely unconscious emotion. That stream is will, and through will, if not through logic, we can participate in the underlying reality beyond mere phenomena. It is for this reason that Schopenhauer identifies the<space/><italics>noumenon</italics><space/>with what we call our will.</paragraph><paragraph>In his criticism of Kant, Schopenhauer claimed that sensation and understanding are separate and distinct abilities. Yet, for Kant, an object is known through each of them. Kant wrote: &quot;...

He asserted that mere sense impressions, not objects, are given by sensibility. According to Schopenhauer, objects are intuitively perceived by understanding and are discursively thought by reason (Kant had claimed that (1) the understanding thinks objects through concepts and that (2) reason seeks the unconditioned or ultimate answer to &quot;why?&quot;). Schopenhauer said that Kant's mistake regarding perception resulted in all of the obscurity and difficult confusion that is exhibited in the Transcendental Analytic section of his critique.</paragraph><paragraph>Lastly, Schopenhauer departed from Kant in how he interpreted the<space/><link><target>Platonic forms</target><part>Platonic ideas</part></link>.
