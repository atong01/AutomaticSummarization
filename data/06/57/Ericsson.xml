He worked for a firm which made<space/><link><target>telegraph</target></link><space/>equipment for the Swedish government agency<space/><link><target>Televerket (Sweden)</target><part>Telegrafverket</part></link>. In 1876, at the age of 30, he started a telegraph repair shop with help from his friend Carl Johan Andersson. The shop was in central<space/><link><target>Stockholm</target></link><space/>(No.&amp;nbsp;15 on<space/><link><target>Drottninggatan, Stockholm</target><part>Drottninggatan</part></link>, the principal shopping street) and repaired foreign-made telephones. In 1878 Ericsson began making and selling his own telephone equipment. His phones were not technically innovative, as most of the inventions had already been made in the United States. In 1878 he made an agreement to supply telephones and switchboards to Sweden's first telecom operating company, Stockholms Allmnna Telefonaktiebolag.<extension extension_name='ref' name="BizHistory"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Also in 1878, local telephone importer Numa Peterson hired Ericsson to adjust some telephones from the<space/><link><target>Bell Telephone Company</target></link>. This inspired him to buy a number of<space/><link><target>Siemens AG</target><part>Siemens</part></link><space/>telephones and analyze the technology further. (Ericsson had a scholarship at Siemens a few years earlier.) Through his firm's repair work for Telegrafverket and<space/><link><target>Swedish Railways</target></link>, he was familiar with Bell and Siemens Halske telephones. He improved these designs to produce a higher-quality instrument. These were used by new telephone companies, such as<space/><link><target>Rikstelefon</target></link>, to provide cheaper service than the Bell Group. He had no patent or<space/><link><target>Royalties</target><part>royalty</part></link><space/>problems, as Bell had not patented their inventions in Scandinavia. His training as an instrument maker was reflected in the standard of finish and the ornate design of Ericsson phones of this period. At the end of the year he started to manufacture telephones of his own, much in the image of the Siemens telephones, and the first product was finished in 1879.</paragraph><paragraph>Ericsson became a major supplier of telephone equipment to<space/><link><target>Scandinavia</target></link>. Because its factory could not keep up with demand, work such as joinery and metal-plating was contracted out. Much of its raw materials were imported, so in the following decades Ericsson bought into a number of firms to ensure supplies of essentials like<space/><link><target>brass</target></link>,<space/><link><target>wire</target></link>,<space/><link><target>ebonite</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>magnet</target></link><space/>steel. Much of the<space/><link><target>walnut</target></link><space/>used for cabinets was imported from the United States.</paragraph><paragraph>As Stockholm's telephone network expanded that year, the company reformed into a telephone manufacturing company. But when Bell bought the biggest telephone network in<space/><link><target>Stockholm</target></link>, it only allowed its own telephones to be used with it. So Ericsson's equipment sold mainly to free telephone associations in the Swedish countryside and in the other<space/><link><target>Nordic countries</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>The prices of Bell equipment and services led Henrik Tore Cedergren to form an independent telephone company in 1883 called<space/><italics>Stockholms Allmnna Telefonaktiebolag</italics>. As Bell would not deliver equipment to competitors, he formed a pact with Ericsson, which was to supply the equipment for his new telephone network. In 1918 the companies were merged into<space/><italics>Allmnna Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson</italics>.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1884, a multiple-<link><target>Telephone switchboard</target><part>switchboard</part></link><space/>manual<space/><link><target>telephone exchange</target></link><space/>was more or less copied from a design by C.&amp;nbsp;E. Scribner at<space/><link><target>Western Electric</target></link>. This was legal, as the device was not patented in Sweden, although in the United States it had held<space/><link><target>patent</target></link><space/>529421 since 1879. A single switchboard could handle up to 10,000 lines. The following year, LM Ericsson and Cedergren toured the United States, visiting several telephone exchange stations to gather &quot;inspiration&quot;. They found that U.S. engineers were well ahead in switchboard design but Ericsson telephones were as good as any available.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1884, a technician named Anton Avn at<space/><italics>Stockholms Allmnna Telefonaktiebolag</italics><space/>had combined the earpiece and the mouthpiece of a (by then) standard telephone into a handset. It was used by operators in the exchanges that needed to have one hand free when talking to their customers. Ericsson picked up this invention and incorporated it into Ericsson products, beginning with a telephone named<space/><italics>The<space/><link><target>Telephone magneto</target><part>Dachshund</part></link></italics></paragraph><heading level='3'>International expansion</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Thinktank Birmingham - object 1961S01536.00001(1).jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>An early, wooden, Ericsson telephone, made by the Ericsson Telephone Co.

Britain and Russia were early markets. This eventually led to the establishment of factories in these countries. This was partly to improve chances of gaining local contracts, and partly because the Swedish factory could not keep up supply. In Britain, the<space/><link><target>National Telephone Company</target></link><space/>had been supplied with Ericsson equipment for some time and was a major customer. By 1897, Britain was accounting for 28% of Ericsson's sales. Other Nordic countries had become Ericsson customers as well, spurred by the growth of telephone services in Sweden.<extension extension_name='ref' name="BizHistory"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Other countries and colonies were exposed to Ericsson products through the influence of their parent countries. These included Australia and New Zealand, which by the late 1890s were Ericsson's largest non-European market. With<space/><link><target>mass production</target></link><space/>techniques now firmly established, the phones were losing some of their ornate finish and decoration.</paragraph><paragraph>Despite their successes elsewhere, Ericsson did not make significant sales into the United States. The Bell Group and local companies like<space/><link><target>KBR (company)</target><part>Kellogg</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Automatic Electric</target></link><space/>had this market tied up. Ericsson eventually sold its U.S. assets. Sales in Mexico led to further development into South American countries. South Africa and China were also generating significant sales. With his company now<space/><link><target>Multinational corporation</target><part>multinational</part></link>, Lars Ericsson stepped down from the company in 1901.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Automatic equipment</heading><paragraph><link><target>Image:Ericsson telefonplan 20050902 001.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>250px</part><part>LM Ericsson's former headquarters at<space/><link><target>Telefonplan</target></link><space/>in<space/><link><target>Stockholm</target></link>, see LM Ericsson building.</part></link><space/>Ericsson ignored the growth of<space/><link><target>automatic telephony</target></link><space/>in the United States. Instead it concentrated on squeezing the most sales out of manual exchange designs. Their first dial phone was produced in 1921, although sales of the early automatic switching systems were slow until the equipment had proved itself on the world's markets. Phones of this period were characterized by a simpler design and finish, and many of the early automatic desk phones in Ericsson's catalogues were simply the proven magneto styles with a dial stuck on the front and appropriate changes to the electronics. A concession to style was in the elaborate decals (transfers) that decorated the cases.<extension extension_name='ref' name="BizHistory"></extension></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>World War I</target></link>, the subsequent<space/><link><target>Great Depression</target></link>, and the loss of its Russian assets after the<space/><link><target>Russian Revolution (1917)</target><part>Revolution</part></link><space/>slowed the company's development and restricted its sales to countries such as Australia.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Shareholding changes</heading><paragraph>The purchase of other related companies put pressure on Ericsson's finances, and in 1925, Karl Fredric Wincrantz took control of the company by acquiring the majority of the shares. Wincrantz was partly funded by<space/><link><target>Ivar Kreuger</target></link>, an international financier. The company was renamed<space/><italics>Telefon AB LM Ericsson</italics>. At this time, Kreuger started showing interest in the company, being a major owner of Wincrantz holding companies.<extension extension_name='ref' name="BizHistory"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>In 1928, Ericsson began issuing &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; shares, where an &quot;A&quot; share has 1000 votes against a &quot;B&quot; share. Wincrantz controlled the company by having only a few &quot;A&quot; shares, not a majority of the shares. By issuing a lot of &quot;B&quot; shares, much more money was fed to the company, while maintaining the<space/><italics>status quo</italics><space/>of power distribution.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1930, a second issue of &quot;B&quot;-shares took place, and Kreuger gained majority control of the company with a mixture of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; shares. He bought these shares with money lent by LM Ericsson, with<space/><link><target>collateral (finance)</target><part>security</part></link><space/>given in German state<space/><link><target>Bond (finance)</target><part>bond</part><trail>s</trail></link>. He then took a loan for his own company<space/><link><target>Kreuger &amp; Toll</target></link><space/>from<space/><link><target>ITT Corporation</target></link><space/>(administered by<space/><link><target>Sosthenes Behn</target></link>), giving parts of LM Ericsson as security, and used its assets and name in a series of international financial dealings that had little to do with<space/><link><target>telephony</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Ericsson was now being seen as a take over target by ITT, its main international competitor. In 1931 ITT acquired from Kreuger enough shares to have a majority interest in Ericsson. This news was not made public for some time. There was a government imposed limit on foreign<space/><link><target>Shareholder</target><part>shareholdings</part></link><space/>in Swedish companies, so for the time being the shares were still listed in Kreuger's name. Kreuger in return was to gain shares in ITT. He stood to make a profit of $11 million on the deal. When ITT's Behn wanted to cancel this deal in 1932, he discovered that there was no money left in the company, just a large claim on the same Kreuger &amp; Toll that Kreuger had himself lent money to. Kreuger had effectively bought LM Ericsson with its own money.</paragraph><paragraph>Kreuger had been using the company as security for loans, and despite his profits, was unable to repay these loans. Ericsson found that they had invested in some very doubtful share deals, whose losses were deemed significant. ITT examined the deal and found that it had been seriously misled about Ericsson's value. ITT asked Kreuger to come to New York City for a conference, but Kreuger did not attend. As word of Kreuger's financial position spread, pressure was put on him by the banking institutions to provide security for his loans. ITT canceled the deal to buy Ericsson shares. Kreuger could not repay the $11 million, and committed suicide in Paris in 1932. ITT owned one third of Ericsson, but was forbidden to exercise this ownership because of a paragraph in the company's articles of association stating that no foreign investor was allowed to control more than 20% of the votes.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Wallenberg era begins</heading><paragraph>Ericsson was saved from bankruptcy and closure with the help of banks and some government backing. Marcus Wallenberg Jr negotiated a deal with several Swedish banks to rebuild Ericsson financially. Some of those were<space/><link><target>Stockholms Enskilda Bank</target></link><space/>(which later became the current<space/><link><target>Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken</target></link>) and other Swedish investment banks controlled by the<space/><link><target>Wallenberg family</target></link>. The banks gradually increased their possession of LM Ericsson &quot;A&quot; shares, with ITT still being the single largest shareholder. In 1960, the Wallenberg family struck a deal with ITT to buy its shares in Ericsson, and has since controlled the company.<extension extension_name='ref' name="BizHistory"></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Market development</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Ericsson bakelittelefon 1931 sv.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>The Ericsson DBH1001 (1931) was the first combined telephone set with a housing and handset made from Bakelite.

The fragmented town-by-town systems which had grown up over the years, serviced by many small private companies, were integrated and offered for lease to a single company. Ericsson managed to obtain some leases, which represented further sales of equipment to the growing networks.

Ericsson reduced its involvement in telephone operating companies and went back to manufacturing telephones and<space/><link><target>switchgear</target></link>. The<space/><link><target>Beeston, Nottinghamshire</target><part>Beeston</part></link><space/>factory in Britain had been a joint venture between Ericsson and the National Telephone Company. The factory built automatic switching equipment for the GPO under license from Strowger, and exported products to former colonies like South Africa and Australia. The British government divided its equipment contracts between competing manufacturers, but Ericsson's presence and manufacturing facilities in Britain allowed it to get most of the contracts.</paragraph><paragraph>Sales drives resumed after the<space/><link><target>Great Depression</target></link>, but the company never achieved the market penetration that it had at the turn of the century. Although it still produced a range of phones, switching equipment was becoming a more important part of its range.

Early versions such as WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) used packet data over the existing GSM network, in a form known as GPRS (General Packet Radio Service), but these services, known as 2.5G, were fairly rudimentary and did not achieve much mass-market success.</paragraph><paragraph>The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) had prepared the specifications for a 3G mobile service that included several different technologies. Ericsson pushed hard for the WCDMA (wideband CDMA) form, based on the GSM standard, and began testing the technology in 1996. Japanese operator NTT DOCOMO signed deals to partner with Ericsson and Nokia, who joined forces in 1997 to support WCDMA over rival standards. DOCOMO would eventually become the first operator with a live 3G network, using its own version of WCDMA, called FOMA. But while Ericsson championed the development of the WCDMA version of GSM, rival American chip developer Qualcomm pursued and promoted alternatives known as cdma2000, building on the popularity of CDMA in the US market.

And the cutbacks that followed 10 consecutive quarters of losses meant that a slimmed-down Ericsson could return to profit in Q3 2003, and begin to grow again. After announcing in 2003 that it had turned the corner, new CEO Carl-Henric Svanberg said the company was to concentrate on operational excellence, a wide-ranging push for efficiency and better return on investment that was to dominate Ericssons corporate culture for several years.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">July 2014</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Among the cutbacks, Ericsson had pared down its CDMA organization. This standard, used largely in North America, Japan and mainland Asia, was a rival to GSM, and Ericsson had a global market share of 25%, but the overall volumes were too low, so Ericsson wound down its CDMA commitment, ending it completely by 2006.</paragraph><paragraph>With a healthier balance sheet, Ericsson was able to start a series of acquisitions to strengthen its position in key technologies and market segments. The first of these was Marconi, a company which dated back to the dawn of radio, which brought assets including a strong portfolio in transmission, fiber optic and fixed network services. Further acquisitions included Redback Networks (carrier edge-routers), Entrisphere (fiber) and LHS (customer care services) in 2007, and Tandberg Television in 2008. It sold its enterprise PBX division to Aastra Technologies that same year. Ericsson reentered the CDMA market after acquiring North American vendor Nortels CDMA operations and assets in 2009.</paragraph><paragraph>The acquisitions followed Ericssons general strategy of expanding into next-generation network technologies and multimedia, a combined offering that would become even more important as video became the dominant form of data traffic on mobile broadband networks. Ericsson created a division to develop its multimedia business in early 2007.</paragraph><paragraph>Even as operators were buying and rolling out WCDMA, the first generation of 3G access, Ericsson was working on ways to improve it. New advances included IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) and the next evolution of WCDMA, called High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA). Initially deployed in the download version called HSDPA, the technology spread dramatically from the first test calls in the US in late 2005<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="title">http://www.phonescoop.com/articles/article.php?a</arg><arg name="url">http://www.phonescoop.com/articles/article.php?a</arg><arg name="website">http://www.phonescoop.com/articles/article.php?a</arg></template></extension><space/>to 59 commercial networks in September 2006.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="title">http://www.ericsson.com/ericsson/corpinfo/publications/review/2006_03/06.shtml</arg><arg name="url">http://www.ericsson.com/ericsson/corpinfo/publications/review/2006_03/06.shtml</arg><arg name="website">http://www.ericsson.com/ericsson/corpinfo/publications/review/2006_03/06.shtml</arg></template></extension><space/>HSPA would provide the worlds first real taste of mobile broadband.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Acquisitions, expansion, consolidation and cooperation</heading><paragraph>Around the start of the 21st century, companies and governments began to push for standards for the emerging mobile Internet.
