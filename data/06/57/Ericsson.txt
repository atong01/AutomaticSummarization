'''Ericsson''' (''Telefonaktiebolaget L. M. Ericsson'') is a Swedish [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] provider of communication technology and services.  The company's offerings comprise services, software and infrastructure in information and communications technology for telecom operators and other industries, including traditional telecommunications as well as [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) networking equipment, mobile and fixed broadband, operations and business support services, cable TV, IPTV, video systems, and an extensive services operation. Ericsson had a market share of 35% (in 2012) in the 2G/3G/4G mobile network infrastructure market.<ref>[http://www.gartner.com/technology/reprints.do?id=1-1IG35N2&ct=130813&st=sg Gartner, 6 August 2013: Magic Quadrant for LTE Network Infrastructure]</ref>

Founded in 1876 by Lars Magnus Ericsson,<ref name=BizHistory>{{cite web|title=Ericsson History|URL=http://www.ericssonhistory.com|author=Center for Business History, Stockholm}}</ref> the company is today headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden. The company employs more than 110,000 people and works with customers in more than 180 countries, including Canada, United States, China, India, Brazil, Pakistan, Japan, South Africa, Australia, Germany, Italy, the UK, and Sweden. Ericsson holds over 37,000 granted patents as of May 2015, including many in the wireless communications field.

==History==

===Foundation===

[[File:Swedish inventor Lars Magnus Ericsson.jpg|thumb|Lars Magnus Ericsson]]
[[Lars Magnus Ericsson]] began his association with telephones in his youth as an instrument maker. He worked for a firm which made [[telegraph]] equipment for the Swedish government agency [[Televerket (Sweden)|Telegrafverket]]. In 1876, at the age of 30, he started a telegraph repair shop with help from his friend Carl Johan Andersson.  The shop was in central [[Stockholm]] (No.&nbsp;15 on [[Drottninggatan, Stockholm|Drottninggatan]], the principal shopping street) and repaired foreign-made telephones. In 1878 Ericsson began making and selling his own telephone equipment. His phones were not technically innovative, as most of the inventions had already been made in the United States. In 1878 he made an agreement to supply telephones and switchboards to Sweden's first telecom operating company, Stockholms Allmänna Telefonaktiebolag.<ref name="BizHistory"/>

Also in 1878, local telephone importer Numa Peterson hired Ericsson to adjust some telephones from the [[Bell Telephone Company]]. This inspired him to buy a number of [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] telephones and analyze the technology further. (Ericsson had a scholarship at Siemens a few years earlier.) Through his firm's repair work for Telegrafverket and [[Swedish Railways]], he was familiar with Bell and Siemens Halske telephones. He improved these designs to produce a higher-quality instrument. These were used by new telephone companies, such as [[Rikstelefon]], to provide cheaper service than the Bell Group. He had no patent or [[Royalties|royalty]] problems, as Bell had not patented their inventions in Scandinavia. His training as an instrument maker was reflected in the standard of finish and the ornate design of Ericsson phones of this period. At the end of the year he started to manufacture telephones of his own, much in the image of the Siemens telephones, and the first product was finished in 1879.

Ericsson became a major supplier of telephone equipment to [[Scandinavia]]. Because its factory could not keep up with demand, work such as joinery and metal-plating was contracted out. Much of its raw materials were imported, so in the following decades Ericsson bought into a number of firms to ensure supplies of essentials like [[brass]], [[wire]], [[ebonite]], and [[magnet]] steel. Much of the [[walnut]] used for cabinets was imported from the United States.

As Stockholm's telephone network expanded that year, the company reformed into a telephone manufacturing company. But when Bell bought the biggest telephone network in [[Stockholm]], it only allowed its own telephones to be used with it. So Ericsson's equipment sold mainly to free telephone associations in the Swedish countryside and in the other [[Nordic countries]].

The prices of Bell equipment and services led Henrik Tore Cedergren to form an independent telephone company in 1883 called ''Stockholms Allmänna Telefonaktiebolag''. As Bell would not deliver equipment to competitors, he formed a pact with Ericsson, which was to supply the equipment for his new telephone network. In 1918 the companies were merged into ''Allmänna Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson''.

In 1884, a multiple-[[Telephone switchboard|switchboard]] manual [[telephone exchange]] was more or less copied from a design by C.&nbsp;E. Scribner at [[Western Electric]]. This was legal, as the device was not patented in Sweden, although in the United States it had held [[patent]] 529421 since 1879. A single switchboard could handle up to 10,000 lines. The following year, LM Ericsson and Cedergren toured the United States, visiting several telephone exchange stations to gather "inspiration". They found that U.S. engineers were well ahead in switchboard design but Ericsson telephones were as good as any available.

In 1884, a technician named Anton Avén at ''Stockholms Allmänna Telefonaktiebolag'' had combined the earpiece and the mouthpiece of a (by then) standard telephone into a handset. It was used by operators in the exchanges that needed to have one hand free when talking to their customers. Ericsson picked up this invention and incorporated it into Ericsson products, beginning with a telephone named ''The [[Telephone magneto|Dachshund]]''

===International expansion===

[[File:Thinktank Birmingham - object 1961S01536.00001(1).jpg|thumb|An early, wooden, Ericsson telephone, made by the Ericsson Telephone Co. Ltd., of [[Nottingham]], England, it is now in the collection of [[Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum]]. ]]

As production grew in the late 1890s, and the Swedish market seemed to be reaching saturation, Ericsson was able to expand into foreign markets through a number of agents. Britain and Russia were early markets. This eventually led to the establishment of factories in these countries. This was partly to improve chances of gaining local contracts, and partly because the Swedish factory could not keep up supply. In Britain, the [[National Telephone Company]] had been supplied with Ericsson equipment for some time and was a major customer. By 1897, Britain was accounting for 28% of Ericsson's sales. Other Nordic countries had become Ericsson customers as well, spurred by the growth of telephone services in Sweden.<ref name="BizHistory"/>

Other countries and colonies were exposed to Ericsson products through the influence of their parent countries. These included Australia and New Zealand, which by the late 1890s were Ericsson's largest non-European market. With [[mass production]] techniques now firmly established, the phones were losing some of their ornate finish and decoration.

Despite their successes elsewhere, Ericsson did not make significant sales into the United States. The Bell Group and local companies like [[KBR (company)|Kellogg]] and [[Automatic Electric]] had this market tied up. Ericsson eventually sold its U.S. assets. Sales in Mexico led to further development into South American countries. South Africa and China were also generating significant sales. With his company now [[Multinational corporation|multinational]], Lars Ericsson stepped down from the company in 1901.

===Automatic equipment===

[[Image:Ericsson telefonplan 20050902 001.jpg|thumb|right|250px|LM Ericsson's former headquarters at [[Telefonplan]] in [[Stockholm]], see LM Ericsson building.]] Ericsson ignored the growth of [[automatic telephony]] in the United States. Instead it concentrated on squeezing the most sales out of manual exchange designs. Their first dial phone was produced in 1921, although sales of the early automatic switching systems were slow until the equipment had proved itself on the world's markets. Phones of this period were characterized by a simpler design and finish, and many of the early automatic desk phones in Ericsson's catalogues were simply the proven magneto styles with a dial stuck on the front and appropriate changes to the electronics. A concession to style was in the elaborate decals (transfers) that decorated the cases.<ref name="BizHistory"/>

[[World War I]], the subsequent [[Great Depression]], and the loss of its Russian assets after the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Revolution]] slowed the company's development and restricted its sales to countries such as Australia.

===Shareholding changes===

The purchase of other related companies put pressure on Ericsson's finances, and in 1925, Karl Fredric Wincrantz took control of the company by acquiring the majority of the shares. Wincrantz was partly funded by [[Ivar Kreuger]], an international financier. The company was renamed ''Telefon AB LM Ericsson''. At this time, Kreuger started showing interest in the company, being a major owner of Wincrantz holding companies.<ref name="BizHistory"/>

In 1928, Ericsson began issuing "A" and "B" shares, where an "A" share has 1000 votes against a "B" share.  Wincrantz controlled the company by having only a few "A" shares, not a majority of the shares. By issuing a lot of "B" shares, much more money was fed to the company, while maintaining the ''status quo'' of power distribution.

In 1930, a second issue of "B"-shares took place, and Kreuger gained majority control of the company with a mixture of "A" and "B" shares. He bought these shares with money lent by LM Ericsson, with [[collateral (finance)|security]] given in German state [[Bond (finance)|bond]]s.  He then took a loan for his own company [[Kreuger & Toll]] from [[ITT Corporation]] (administered by [[Sosthenes Behn]]), giving parts of LM Ericsson as security, and used its assets and name in a series of international financial dealings that had little to do with [[telephony]].

Ericsson was now being seen as a take over target by ITT, its main international competitor. In 1931 ITT acquired from Kreuger enough shares to have a majority interest in Ericsson. This news was not made public for some time. There was a government imposed limit on foreign [[Shareholder|shareholdings]] in Swedish companies, so for the time being the shares were still listed in Kreuger's name. Kreuger in return was to gain shares in ITT. He stood to make a profit of $11 million on the deal.  When ITT's Behn wanted to cancel this deal in 1932, he discovered that there was no money left in the company, just a large claim on the same Kreuger & Toll that Kreuger had himself lent money to. Kreuger had effectively bought LM Ericsson with its own money.

Kreuger had been using the company as security for loans, and despite his profits, was unable to repay these loans. Ericsson found that they had invested in some very doubtful share deals, whose losses were deemed significant. ITT examined the deal and found that it had been seriously misled about Ericsson's value. ITT asked Kreuger to come to New York City for a conference, but Kreuger did not attend. As word of Kreuger's financial position spread, pressure was put on him by the banking institutions to provide security for his loans. ITT canceled the deal to buy Ericsson shares. Kreuger could not repay the $11 million, and committed suicide in Paris in 1932. ITT owned one third of Ericsson, but was forbidden to exercise this ownership because of a paragraph in the company's articles of association stating that no foreign investor was allowed to control more than 20% of the votes.

===Wallenberg era begins===

Ericsson was saved from bankruptcy and closure with the help of banks and some government backing. Marcus Wallenberg Jr negotiated a deal with several Swedish banks to rebuild Ericsson financially. Some of those were [[Stockholms Enskilda Bank]] (which later became the current [[Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken]]) and other Swedish investment banks controlled by the [[Wallenberg family]]. The banks gradually increased their possession of LM Ericsson "A" shares, with ITT still being the single largest shareholder. In 1960, the Wallenberg family struck a deal with ITT to buy its shares in Ericsson, and has since controlled the company.<ref name="BizHistory"/>

===Market development===
[[File:Ericsson bakelittelefon 1931 sv.jpg|thumb|The Ericsson DBH1001 (1931) was the first combined telephone set with a housing and handset made from Bakelite. The design is attributed to Jean Heiberg.]]
[[File:Ericsson 1950s bakelite telephone.jpg|thumb|The Ericsson DBH15 telephone, a successor of the DBH 1001 and redesigned in 1947 by Gerard Kiljan.]]
In the 1920s and 1930s, the world telephone markets were being organized and stabilized by many governments. The fragmented town-by-town systems which had grown up over the years, serviced by many small private companies, were integrated and offered for lease to a single company. Ericsson managed to obtain some leases, which represented further sales of equipment to the growing networks. The other large telephone companies had the same goal
Ericsson managed to get almost one third of its sales under the control of its [[telephone company|telephone operating companies]].<ref name="BizHistory"/>

Negotiations between the major telephone companies aimed at dividing up the world between them, but the size of ITT made it hard to compete with. Ericsson reduced its involvement in telephone operating companies and went back to manufacturing telephones and [[switchgear]]. The [[Beeston, Nottinghamshire|Beeston]] factory in Britain had been a joint venture between Ericsson and the National Telephone Company. The factory built automatic switching equipment for the GPO under license from Strowger, and exported products to former colonies like South Africa and Australia. The British government divided its equipment contracts between competing manufacturers, but Ericsson's presence and manufacturing facilities in Britain allowed it to get most of the contracts.

Sales drives resumed after the [[Great Depression]], but the company never achieved the market penetration that it had at the turn of the century. Although it still produced a range of phones, switching equipment was becoming a more important part of its range. The distinctive Ericsson styles soon became subdued by the increasing use of [[Ericsson DBH 1001 telephone|Bakelite telephones]] starting in the 1930.

Following the advent of football shirt sponsorship during the 1980s, Ericsson sponsored two English football clubs during the 1990s – [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] and [[Queen's Park Rangers F.C.|Queen's Park Rangers]].

===Further development===
Ericsson introduced the world's first fully automatic mobile telephone system, [[MTD (mobile network)#MTA|MTA]] in 1956.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cellular-news.com/story/19883.php |title=Ericsson Celebrates 50 Years of Mobile Telephony |website=Cellular-news.com |date=2006-10-17 |accessdate=2011-10-09}}</ref> It released one of the world's first handsfree speaker phones in the 1960s. In 1954, it released the [[Ericofon]]. Ericsson [[crossbar switching]] equipment was used in telephone administrations in many countries, and its influence is still felt in such areas as mobile phones.

=== 1995-2003 emergence of the Internet ===
The emergence of the Internet in the 1990s heralded a new world for telecommunications. Ericsson was seen by some as being slow to realize the potential of the Internet and falling behind in the area of IP technology.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Internet and the New World|url=http://www.ericssonhistory.com/changing-the-world/Big-bang/The-internet-and-the-new-world-/|website=History of Ericsson}}</ref>  But the company had established a project starting in 1995 to chart its path into the internet age, and formed its Infocom Systems business unit to pursue opportunities at the junction of fixed-line telecom and IT. CEO Lars Ramqvist wrote in the 1996 annual report that in all three of its business areas – Mobile Telephones and Terminals, Mobile Systems, and Infocom Systems – “we will expand our operations as they relate to customer service and Internet Protocol (IP) access (Internet and intranet access).”<ref name="ericsson.com">{{cite web|title=Annual Report 1996|website=Ericsson|url=http://www.ericsson.com/res/investors/docs/annual-reports-1970-2002/AnnualReport1996.pdf|}}</ref>

The continuing growth of GSM, which was becoming a de facto world standard, combined with Ericsson’s strength in other mobile standards, such as [[D-AMPS]] and [[Personal Digital Cellular|PDC]], meant that by the start of 1997, Ericsson had an estimated 40 percent share of the world’s mobile market, with around 54 million subscribers. On top of that, there were around 188 million AXE lines in place or on order in 117 countries.<ref name="ericsson.com"/>

Telecom and chip companies worked frantically in the 1990s to provide Internet access over mobile telephones. Early versions such as WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) used packet data over the existing GSM network, in a form known as GPRS (General Packet Radio Service), but these services, known as 2.5G, were fairly rudimentary and did not achieve much mass-market success.

The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) had prepared the specifications for a 3G mobile service that included several different technologies. Ericsson pushed hard for the WCDMA (wideband CDMA) form, based on the GSM standard, and began testing the technology in 1996. Japanese operator NTT DOCOMO signed deals to partner with Ericsson and Nokia, who joined forces in 1997 to support WCDMA over rival standards. DOCOMO would eventually become the first operator with a live 3G network, using its own version of WCDMA, called FOMA. But while Ericsson championed the development of the WCDMA version of GSM, rival American chip developer Qualcomm pursued and promoted alternatives known as cdma2000, building on the popularity of CDMA in the US market. A vicious patent battle was eventually resolved in March 1999<ref>{{cite web|title=Ericsson/Qualcomm bitter feud ends|date=March 29, 1999|first=Nancy|last=Gohring|url=http://connectedplanetonline.com/mag/telecom_ericssonqualcomm_bitter_feud/|website=Connected Planet|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109040128/http://connectedplanetonline.com/mag/telecom_ericssonqualcomm_bitter_feud|archivedate=9 January 2014}}</ref>  when the two bitter rivals agreed to pay each other royalties for use of their respective technologies, and Ericsson purchased Qualcomm’s wireless infrastructure business and some R&D resources.<ref>{{cite news|title=Short Take: Qualcomm, Ericsson finalize CDMA agreement |url=http://news.cnet.com/Short-Take-Qualcomm,-Ericsson-finalize-CDMA-agreement/2110-1033_3-226260.html |work=[[CNET]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20140714180638/http://news.cnet.com/Short-Take-Qualcomm,-Ericsson-finalize-CDMA-agreement/2110-1033_3-226260.html |archivedate=14 July 2014 }}</ref>

Once the Qualcomm conflict was settled, Ericsson continued to ride the wave of interest in mobile Internet. It announced a partnership with Microsoft to combine the software giant’s web browser and server software with Ericsson’s mobile Internet technologies,<ref>{{cite web|title=Microsoft, Ericsson announce strategic partnership to drive mobile Internet market|url=http://www.mobic.com/oldnews/9912/microsoft.htm|website=Mobic.com}}</ref> but the subsequent joint venture was dissolved in 2001 in the fallout from the Internet and telecom crashes.

Ericsson, like all other companies in the field, got caught up in the frenzy of the IT/telecoms bubble in the late 1990s. The company’s market value increased by an order of magnitude, with the share price peaking at SEK 825 in March 2000, up from a low of SEK 20 at the start of the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shareholder Information {{ndash}} Share Graphs and Figures|url=http://www.ericsson.com/thecompany/investors/shareholder-information/share-graphs|website=Ericsson}}</ref>

Lars Ramqvist stepped down as CEO in January 1998, going on to become chairperson of the board. Sven-Christer Nilsson took over as CEO in early 1998, and led the company in a much clearer IP direction, with acquisitions including a significant share in US router company Juniper.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ericsson Stake in Juniper|date=March 18, 1999|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/18/business/ericsson-stake-in-juniper.html|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

As well as networks, Ericsson had become a leading player in the production of mobile phones, sharing top place with Nokia and Motorola during 1997.<ref>{{cite web|title=Problems with Mobile Phones|url=http://www.ericssonhistory.com/changing-the-world/Big-bang/Problems-with-mobile-phones-/|website=History of Ericsson}}</ref>

Services were also becoming increasingly important. Ericsson had offered network rollout services for many years, and had even operated networks, but at the end of the 1990s, the services operations were amalgamated for the first time into a services unit.

In June 1999, Kurt Hellström, the head of Ericsson’s mobile division, replaced Nilsson as CEO.  Worldwide hype around the potential of the internet – and for Ericsson in particular, the mobile internet – had inflated industry expectations.  Operators in many major countries, such as the US, the UK and Germany, used much of their capital bidding for 3G licenses, and could not afford the new networks required to use the spectrum they had spent so much money acquiring. The order intake that Ericsson and other telecom vendors had expected, and invested in preparing for, was devastatingly disappointing, causing wave after wave of job losses and consolidations across the industry.

Ericsson issued a profit warning in March 2001. Over the coming year, sales to operators would fall by around half.<ref>{{cite web|title=Crisis|url=http://www.ericssonhistory.com/changing-the-world/Big-bang/Crisis/|website=History of Ericsson}}</ref>

Mobile phones, once seen as a promising business area, became a burden, with the phones unit making a loss of SEK 24 million in 2000. A fire in a Philips chip factory in New Mexico in March 2000 caused severe disruption to Ericsson’s phone production,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Fire That Changed an Industry: A Case Study on Thriving in a Networked World|date=October 1, 2008|first=Amit S.|last=Mukherjee|url=http://www.ftpress.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1244469|website=FT Press}}</ref> dealing a ''coup de grâce'' to Ericsson’s mobile phone hopes. Mobile phones would be spun off into a joint venture with Sony, Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications, in October 2001.<ref>{{cite web|title=http://news.cision.com/ericsson/r/sony-ericsson-mobile-communications-established-today,c48602|url=http://news.cision.com/ericsson/r/sony-ericsson-mobile-communications-established-today,c48602|website=http://news.cision.com/ericsson/r/sony-ericsson-mobile-communications-established-today,c48602}}</ref>

Ericsson launched several rounds of restructuring and refinancing. Job losses were enormous: during 2001, staff numbers fell from 107,000 to 85,000.<ref>{{cite web|title=http://www.ericssonhistory.com/changing-the-world/Big-bang/The-first-cutbacks/|url=http://www.ericssonhistory.com/changing-the-world/Big-bang/The-first-cutbacks/|website=http://www.ericssonhistory.com/changing-the-world/Big-bang/The-first-cutbacks/}}</ref> A further 20,000 went the next year,<ref>{{cite web|title=http://www.ericssonhistory.com/changing-the-world/Big-bang/Second-round-of-cuts-/|url=http://www.ericssonhistory.com/changing-the-world/Big-bang/Second-round-of-cuts-/|website=http://www.ericssonhistory.com/changing-the-world/Big-bang/Second-round-of-cuts-/}}</ref> and 11,000 more in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|title=http://www.ericssonhistory.com/changing-the-world/Big-bang/A-new-chairman-of-the-board/|url=http://www.ericssonhistory.com/changing-the-world/Big-bang/A-new-chairman-of-the-board/|website=http://www.ericssonhistory.com/changing-the-world/Big-bang/A-new-chairman-of-the-board/}}</ref> A new rights issue raised SEK 30 billion to keep the company afloat.

The company had come back from the brink, just as mobile Internet really started picking up speed. And with record profits, it was in better shape than many of its competitors.<ref>{{cite web|title=http://www.ericssonhistory.com/changing-the-world/Everyone-on-board/Record-profits/|url=http://www.ericssonhistory.com/changing-the-world/Everyone-on-board/Record-profits/|website=http://www.ericssonhistory.com/changing-the-world/Everyone-on-board/Record-profits/}}</ref>

===2003-2010 rebuilding and growing===
The emergence of the truly mobile Internet in the wake of the IT and telecoms crashes kicked off an extraordinary period of growth for the global telecom industry and Ericsson in particular. 
After the launch of 3G services during 2003,<ref>{{cite news|title=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/2856127.stm|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/2856127.stm|website=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/2856127.stm | first=Rebecca|last=Pike|date=March 17, 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/2808761.stm|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/2808761.stm|website=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/2808761.stm | date=March 3, 2003}}</ref> people were starting to access the Internet using their phones, and liking it.

Ericsson’s position as a supplier of GSM equipment to many major operators, and its role as a pioneer in the emerging 3G standards and associated technology, placed it at the forefront of many of the changes to come. And the cutbacks that followed 10 consecutive quarters of losses meant that a slimmed-down Ericsson could return to profit in Q3 2003, and begin to grow again. 
After announcing in 2003 that it had turned the corner, new CEO Carl-Henric Svanberg said the company was to concentrate on operational excellence, a wide-ranging push for efficiency and better return on investment that was to dominate Ericsson’s corporate culture for several years.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Among the cutbacks, Ericsson had pared down its CDMA organization. This standard, used largely in North America, Japan and mainland Asia, was a rival to GSM, and Ericsson had a global market share of 25%, but the overall volumes were too low, so Ericsson wound down its CDMA commitment, ending it completely by 2006.

With a healthier balance sheet, Ericsson was able to start a series of acquisitions to strengthen its position in key technologies and market segments. The first of these was Marconi, a company which dated back to the dawn of radio, which brought assets including a strong portfolio in transmission, fiber optic and fixed network services.  Further acquisitions included Redback Networks (carrier edge-routers),  Entrisphere (fiber) and LHS (customer care services) in 2007, and Tandberg Television in 2008. It sold its enterprise PBX division to Aastra Technologies that same year.  Ericsson reentered the CDMA market after acquiring North American vendor Nortel’s CDMA operations and assets in 2009.

The acquisitions followed Ericsson’s general strategy of expanding into next-generation network technologies and multimedia, a combined offering that would become even more important as video became the dominant form of data traffic on mobile broadband networks. Ericsson created a division to develop its multimedia business in early 2007.

Even as operators were buying and rolling out WCDMA, the first generation of 3G access, Ericsson was working on ways to improve it.  New advances included IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) and the next evolution of WCDMA, called High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA).

===Acquisitions, expansion, consolidation and cooperation===
Around the start of the 21st century, companies and governments began to push for standards for the emerging mobile Internet. In May 2000, the [[European Commission]] created the [[Wireless Strategic Initiative]],<ref>{{cite web|url= ftp://ftp.cordis.europa.eu/pub/ist/docs/ka4/mob_wsi.pdf |title= WSI (Wireless Strategic Initiative)|publisher=Ericsson.se|date=2000-05-01}}</ref> a consortium of four telecommunications suppliers in Europe – Ericsson, [[Nokia]], [[Alcatel]] (France), and [[Siemens AG]] (Germany) – to develop and test new prototypes for advanced wireless communications systems. Later that year, the consortium partners invited other companies to join them in a [[Wireless World Research Forum]] in 2001.

In December 1999 [[Microsoft]] and Ericsson announced<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/features/1999/12-08ericsson.aspx|title= Microsoft, Ericsson Team Up to Bring Information Anytime, Anywhere, to Carriers and Consumers|publisher=Microsoft.com|date= 1999-12-08 |accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref> a [[strategic partnership]] to combine the former's web browser and server software with the latter's mobile-internet technologies.

In 2000, the [[Dot-com bubble|information technology bubble]] burst with marked [[Economy of Sweden|economic implications for Sweden]]. Ericsson, the world's largest producer of mobile telecommunications equipment, shed thousands of jobs, as did the country's Internet consulting firms and [[dot-com start-up]]s. In the same year, [[Intel]], the world's largest semiconductor chip manufacturer, signed a $1.5 billion deal to supply [[flash memory]] to Ericsson over the next three years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Intel-scores-flash-memory-deal-with-Ericsson/2100-1001_3-236518.html|title=Intel scores flash memory deal with Ericsson |publisher=cnet.com|date=2000-02-04 |accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref>

The short-lived joint venture called '''Ericsson Microsoft Mobile Venture AB''', owned 70/30 percent by Ericsson and Microsoft, respectively, ended in October 2001 when Ericsson announced<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.itworld.com/IDG011005MicrosoftMobileJV|title= Microsoft pulls out of mobile JV with Ericsson|publisher=Itworld.com|date= October 5, 2001|accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref> that it would absorb the former joint venture and adopt a licensing agreement with Microsoft instead.

Lower stock prices and job losses affected many telecommunications companies in 2001. The major equipment manufacturers – [[Motorola]] (U.S.), [[Lucent Technologies]] (U.S.), [[Cisco Systems]] (U.S.), [[telent plc|Marconi]] (UK), [[Siemens AG]] (Germany), [[Nokia]] (Finland), as well as Ericsson – all announced job cuts both in their home countries and in subsidiaries around the world.

Co-operation with Hewlett-Packard did not end with [[EHPT]]  and in 2003 Ericsson outsourced its IT to HP, which included Managed Services, Help Desk Support, Data Center Operations, and HP Utility Data Center. The contract was extended in 2008.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://ssl.www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-news/press-release.html?id=172163| title=HP Outsources Ericsson's IT| accessdate=2003| publisher=[[HP]]}}</ref> There have also been a number of joint Ericsson/HP Telecoms outsourcing deals with telecoms operators including H3G and Vodafone.
