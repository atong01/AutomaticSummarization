The '''breast''' is one of two prominences found on the upper [[ventral]] region of the [[torso]] of male and female [[primate]]s. In females it serves as the [[mammary gland]], which produces and secretes [[milk]] and feeds [[infant]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/breast|title=Breast – Definition of breast by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com|accessdate=2015-10-21}}</ref> Both [[male]]s and [[female]]s develop breasts from the same [[embryology|embryological]] tissues. At [[puberty]], [[estrogen]]s, in conjunction with [[growth hormone]], cause [[breast development]]. Males do not develop pronounced or well-matured breasts because their bodies produce lower levels of estrogens and higher levels of [[androgen]]s, namely [[testosterone]], which suppress the effects of estrogens in developing breast tissue. The breasts of females are typically far more prominent than those of males.

[[Subcutaneous fat]] covers and envelops a network of [[lactiferous duct|duct]]s that converge to the [[nipple]], and these [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s give the breast its size and shape. At the ends of the ducts are [[mammary lobule|lobule]]s, or clusters of [[mammary alveolus|alveoli]], where milk is produced and stored in response to [[hormone|hormonal signal]]s.<ref name=SEER>{{cite web|title=SEER Training: Breast Anatomy|url=http://training.seer.cancer.gov/breast/anatomy/|publisher=National Cancer Institute|accessdate=9 May 2012}}</ref> During [[pregnancy]], the breast responds to a complex interaction of [[hormone]]s, including estrogens, [[progesterone]], and [[prolactin]], that mediate the completion of its development, namely lobuloalveolar maturation, in preparation of [[lactation]] and [[breastfeeding]]. Upon [[childbirth]], the alveoli are stimulated to produce and secrete milk for infants.

Along with their function in feeding infants, female breasts have social and sexual characteristics. Breasts have been featured in notable ancient and modern sculpture, art, and photography. Female breasts can figure prominently in a woman's perception of her body image and sexual attractiveness. A number of [[Western culture]]s associate breasts with sexuality and tend to regard bare breasts as immodest or indecent. Breasts and especially the nipples are an erogenous zone on women. Given the emphasis of some cultures on breast size and attractiveness, some women seek [[breast augmentation]] or other kinds of [[breast surgery|surgery]] to enlarge or reduce their breast size or to reverse [[ptosis (breasts)|sagging breasts]].

==Etymology==
The English word ''breast'' derives from the [[Old English]] word ''brēost'' (breast, bosom) from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''breustam'' (breast), from the Proto-Indo-European base '''bhreus–''' (to swell, to sprout).<ref>[http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/ielex/PokornyMaster-X.html Indo-European Lexicon: Pokorny Master PIE Etyma]</ref> The ''breast'' spelling conforms to the Scottish and North English dialectal pronunciations.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=breast Online Etymology Dictionary]</ref>

==Anatomy==
[[File:Breast anatomy normal scheme.png|thumb|300px|The Breast: cross-section scheme of the [[mammary gland]]. <br />1. [[Chest wall]] <br />2. [[Pectoralis muscle]]s <br />3. [[Lobules]] <br />4. [[Nipple]] <br />5. [[Areola]] <br />6. [[Lactiferous duct|Milk duct]] <br />7. [[Adipose tissue|Fatty tissue]] <br />8. [[Human skin|Skin]]]]
In women, the breasts overlay the [[pectoralis major muscle]]s and usually extend from the level of the second rib to the level of the sixth rib in the front of the [[human rib cage]]; thus, the breasts cover much of the chest area and the chest walls. At the front of the chest, the breast tissue can extend from the [[clavicle]] (collarbone) to the middle of the [[sternum]] (breastbone). At the sides of the chest, the breast tissue can extend into the [[axilla]] (armpit), and can reach as far to the back as the [[latissimus dorsi muscle]], extending from the lower back to the [[humerus]] bone (the longest bone of the upper arm). As a [[mammary gland]], the breast is composed of layers of different types of [[Histology|tissue]], among which predominate two types, [[adipose tissue]] and [[Lactiferous duct|glandular tissue]], which effects the [[lactation]] functions of the breasts.

[[Morphology (biology)|Morphologically]], the breast is a cone with the base at the chest wall, and the apex is at the nipple, the center of the nipple-areola complex. The superﬁcial tissue layer ([[superficial fascia]]) is separated from the skin by 0.5–2.5&nbsp;cm of subcutaneous fat (adipose tissue). The [[Cooper's ligaments|suspensory Cooper's ligaments]] are fibrous-tissue prolongations that radiate from the superficial fascia to the skin envelope. The female adult breast contains 14–18 irregular lactiferous lobes that converge at the nipple. Milk exits the breast through the nipple, which is surrounded by a pigmented area of skin called the areola. The size of the areola can vary widely among women. The areola contains modified [[sebaceous gland|sweat glands]] known as [[Areolar glands|Montgomery's glands]]. These glands secrete oily fluid that lubricate and protect the nipple during breastfeeding.<ref name=stoppler>{{cite web|last1=Stöppler|first1=Melissa Conrad|title=Breast Anatomy|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/breast_anatomy/article.htm|accessdate=28 June 2015}}</ref> Volatile compounds in these secretions may also serve as an olfactory stimulus for newborn appetite.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0007579 |ref=harv |title=The Secretion of Areolar (Montgomery's) Glands from Lactating Women Elicits Selective, Unconditional Responses in Neonates |year=2009 |editor1-last=Hausberger |editor1-first=Martine |last1=Doucet |first1=Sébastien |last2=Soussignan |first2=Robert |last3=Sagot |first3=Paul |last4=Schaal |first4=Benoist |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=4 |issue=10 |pages=e7579 |pmid=19851461 |pmc=2761488}}</ref>

The 2.0–4.5&nbsp;mm [[lactiferous duct|milk ducts]] are immediately surrounded with dense connective tissue that support the glands. The glandular tissue of the breast is biochemically supported with [[estrogen]]. When a woman ceases [[menopause|menstruation]] and her body estrogen levels decrease, [[breast atrophy]] occurs – milk gland tissue atrophies, withers, and disappears, resulting in a breast composed of adipose tissue, superﬁcial fascia, suspensory ligaments, and the skin envelope.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The dimensions and weight of the breast vary widely among women, ranging from approximately 500 to 1,000 grams (1.1 to 2.2 pounds) each. A small-to-medium-sized breast weighs 500&nbsp;grams (1.1 pounds) or less and a large breast can weighs approximately 750 to 1,000 grams (1.7 to 2.2 pounds) or more.  The tissue composition ratios of the breast also vary among women. Some women's breasts have varying proportions of glandular tissue than of [[adipose tissue|adipose]] or [[connective tissue|connective]] tissues. The fat-to-connective-tissue ratio determines the density or firmness of the breast. During a woman's life, her breasts change size, shape, and weight due to hormonal bodily changes during [[thelarche|puberty]], [[menstruation|fertility]], [[pregnancy]], [[lactation|breastfeeding]], and [[menopause]].<ref>Pamplona DC, de Abreu Alvim C.

===Glandular structure===
The breast is an [[Apocrine|apocrine gland]] that produces [[Human breast milk|milk]] to feed an infant child; for which the [[nipple]] of the breast is surrounded by the [[areola]] (nipple-areola complex), the skin color of which varies from pink to dark brown, and has many [[sebaceous gland]]s. The basic units of the breast are the terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs), which produce the fatty breast milk. They give the breast its offspring-feeding functions as a [[mammary gland]]. They are distributed throughout the body of the breast; approximately two-thirds of the lactiferous tissue is within 30&nbsp;mm of the base of the nipple. The [[lactiferous duct|terminal lactiferous ducts]] drain the milk from TDLUs into 4–18 lactiferous ducts, which drain to the nipple; the milk-glands-to-fat ratio is 2:1 in a [[Lactation|lactating]] woman, and 1:1 in a non-lactating woman. In addition to the milk glands, the breast also is composed of [[connective tissue]]s ([[collagen]], [[elastin]]), [[adipose tissue|white fat]], and the suspensory [[Cooper's ligaments]]. Sensation in the breast is provided by the [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral nervous system innervation]], by means of the front (anterior) and side (lateral) cutaneous branches of the fourth-, the fifth-, and the sixth [[intercostal nerves]], while the T-4 nerve ([[Thoracic spinal nerve 4]]), which innervates the [[dermatomic area]], supplies sensation to the nipple-areola complex.<ref name=grabowski>{{cite book|first1=Gerard J. |last1=Tortora |first2= Sandra Reynolds|last2=Grabowski|title=Introduction to the Human Body: the Essentials of Anatomy and Physiology|date=2001|publisher=J. Wiley|location=New York; Toronto|isbn=9780471367772|edition=Fifth.|accessdate=28 June 2015}}</ref>

===Lymphatic drainage===
Approximately 75% of the [[lymph]] from the breast travels to the axillary [[lymph node]]s on the same side of the body, whilst 25% of the lymph travels to the parasternal nodes (beside the sternum bone).<ref name=GRAYS2005 />{{rp|116}} A small amount of remaining lymph travels to the other breast, and to the abdominal lymph nodes. The [[axillary lymph node]]s include the pectoral (chest), subscapular (under the scapula), and humeral (humerus-bone area) lymph-node groups, which drain to the central [[axillary lymph nodes]] and to the apical axillary lymph nodes. The lymphatic drainage of the breasts is especially relevant to [[oncology]], because [[breast cancer]] is a cancer common to the mammary gland, and [[cancer]] cells can [[Metastasis|metastasize]] (break away) from a [[tumour]] and be dispersed to other parts of the body by means of the lymphatic system.

===Shape and support===
[[File:Closeup of female breast.jpg|thumb|A [[pregnancy|pregnant]] woman's breasts]]
The [[Morphology (biology)|morphologic]] variations in the size, shape, volume, [[Histology|tissue]] density, pectoral locale, and spacing of the breasts determine their natural shape, appearance, and position on a woman's chest. Breast size and other characteristics do not predict the fat-to-milk-gland ratio or the potential for the woman to [[lactation|nurse]] an infant child.<ref name=goddard>{{cite news|last=Goddard|first=Kay|title=I May Have Been the Ultimo Bra Girl, but One of my Breasts was a B-cup and the other was a D |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1384595/Katie-Green-I-Ultimo-bra-girl-I-suffered-breast-asymmetry.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Mail]]|date=10 May 2011|accessdate=18 May 2011|location=London}}</ref> The size and the shape of the breasts are influenced by normal-life [[hormone|hormonal]] changes ([[thelarche]], [[menstruation]], [[pregnancy]], [[menopause]]) and medical conditions (e.g. [[virginal breast hypertrophy]]).<ref name=wood>{{cite journal |author=Wood K, Cameron M, Fitzgerald K |title=Breast Size, Bra Fit and Thoracic Pain in Young Women: A Correlational Study |journal=Chiropractic & Osteopathy |volume=16 |issue= |page=1 |year=2008 |pmid=18339205 |pmc=2275741|doi=10.1186/1746-1340-16-1}}</ref> The shape of the breasts is naturally determined by the support of the suspensory [[Cooper's ligaments]], the underlying muscle and bone structures of the chest, and the skin envelope.

The base of each breast is attached to the chest by the deep fascia over the [[pectoralis major muscle]]s. The space between the breast and the pectoralis major muscle is called [[retromammary space]] and gives mobility to the breast. Some breasts are mounted high upon the chest wall, are of rounded shape, and project almost horizontally from the chest, which features are common to girls and women in the early stages of [[Thelarche|thelarchic]] development, the sprouting of the breasts. In the high-breast configuration, the dome-shaped and the cone-shaped breast is affixed to the chest at the base, and the weight is evenly distributed over the base area. In the low-breast configuration, a proportion of the breast weight is supported by the chest, against which rests the lower surface of the breast, thus is formed the [[inframammary fold]] (IMF). Because the base is deeply affixed to the chest, the weight of the breast is distributed over a greater area, and so reduces the weight-bearing strain upon the chest, shoulder, and back muscles that bear the weight of the bust.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The chest ([[thoracic cavity]]) progressively slopes outwards from the thoracic inlet (atop the [[Human breastbone|breastbone]]) and above to the lowest ribs that support the breasts. The inframammary fold, where the lower portion of the breast meets the chest, is an anatomic feature created by the adherence of the breast skin and the underlying connective tissues of the chest; the IMF is the lower-most extent of the anatomic breast. In the course of thelarche, some girls develop breasts the lower skin-envelope of which touches the chest below the IMF, and some girls do not; both breast anatomies are statistically normal morphologic variations of the size and shape of women's breasts.<ref name="Boutros_S">{{cite journal |author=Boutros S, Kattash M, Wienfeld A, Yuksel E, Baer S, Shenaq S |title=The Intradermal Anatomy of the Inframammary Fold |journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery |volume=102 |issue=4 |pages=1030–1033 |date=September 1998 |pmid=9734420 |doi= 10.1097/00006534-199809040-00017|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0032-1052&volume=102&issue=4&spage=1030}}</ref>

The most common cause for asymmetric breast density is the common normal variant of asymmetrically distributed breast tissue. Minor asymmetry may be resolved by wearing a padded bra, but in severe cases of developmental breast deformity—commonly called "Amazon's Syndrome" by physicians—may require corrective surgery due to morphological alterations caused by variations in shape, volume, position of the breasts relative to the [[inframammary fold]],  the nipple-areola complex on the chest, or both.<ref name=araco>{{cite journal|last1=Araco|first1=A.|last2=Gravante|first2=G.|last3=Araco|first3=F.|last4=Gentile|first4=P.|last5=Castrì|first5=F.|last6=Delogu|first6=D.|last7=Filingeri|first7=V.|last8=Cervelli|first8=V.|title=Breast Asymmetries: A Brief Review and Our Experience|journal=Aesthetic Plastic Surgery|date=22 May 2006|volume=30|issue=3|pages=309–319|doi=10.1007/s00266-005-0178-x|url=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00266-005-0178-x#page-1|accessdate=27 June 2015}}</ref><ref name=wieslander>{{cite journal|last1=Wieslander|first1=JB|title=Congenital breast deformity is a serious handicap.

If a woman is uncomfortable with her breasts' asymmetry and the difference is relatively minor, she can minimize the difference with a corrective or padded bra or use gel bra inserts. If the difference is significant, this can indicate that the woman should consult a doctor to establish the cause.

Most surgeons will only perform an augmentation procedure to treat asymmetry if the woman's breasts differ by at least one cup size. Options include a minimally invasive procedure known as platelet injection fat transfer, which transfers fat cells from the woman's thighs to her smaller breast. More invasive procedures include reduction or augmentation [[mammoplasty]], such as [[mastopexy]], [[breast reduction plasty]], or [[breast augmentation]]. Depending on the nature of the asymmetry, it may be necessary to operate on one or both breasts.<ref name=losken /><ref name=araco/>

The [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] structure of the human breast is identical in males and females until [[puberty]]. For a girl in [[puberty]], during [[thelarche]] (the breast-development stage), the female [[sex hormone]]s (principally [[estrogen]]s), in conjunction with [[growth hormone]], promote the sprouting, growth, and development of the breasts, in the course of which, as [[mammary gland]]s, they grow in size and volume, and rest on her chest; these development stages of [[secondary sex characteristic]]s (breasts, pubic hair, etc.) are illustrated in the five-stage [[Tanner stage|Tanner Scale]].<ref name="A.R.Greenbaum">{{cite journal |author=Greenbaum AR, Heslop T, Morris J, Dunn KW |title=An Investigation of the Suitability of Bra fit in Women Referred for Reduction Mammaplasty |journal=British Journal of Plastic Surgery |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=230–6 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12859918 |doi=10.1016/S0007-1226(03)00122-X |url=}}</ref>

Approximately two years after the onset of [[puberty]] (a girl's first [[menstrual cycle]]), the hormone [[estrogen]], in conjunction with [[growth hormone]], stimulates the development and growth of the [[mammary gland|glandular]], [[Adipose tissue|fat]], and [[Cooper's ligaments|suspensory]] tissues that compose the breast.

At [[menopause]], [[breast atrophy]] occurs – the breasts can decrease in size when the levels of circulating estrogen decline, followed by the withering of the adipose tissue and the milk glands. Additional to such natural biochemical stimuli, the breasts can become enlarged consequent to an [[Adverse effect|adverse side effect]] of [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]s; and the size of the breasts can also increase and decrease in response to the [[body weight]] fluctuations of the woman. Moreover, the physical changes occurred to the breasts often are recorded in the [[stretch marks]] of the skin envelope; they can serve as historical indicators of the increments and the decrements of the size and the volume of a woman's breasts throughout the course of her life.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The primary function of the breasts, as  [[mammary gland]]s, is the feeding and the nourishing of an infant child with [[breast milk]] during the maternal [[lactation]] period. The round shape of the breast helps to limit the loss of maternal body heat, because milk production depends upon a higher-temperature environment for the proper, milk-production function of the mammary gland tissues, the [[lactiferous ducts]]. Regarding the shape of the breast, the study ''The Evolution of the Human Beast'' (2001) proposed that the rounded shape of a woman's breast evolved to prevent the sucking infant offspring from suffocating while feeding at the teat; that is, because of the human infant's small jaw, which did not project from the face to reach the [[nipple]], he or she might block the [[Nose|nostrils]] against the mother's breast if it were of a flatter form (cf. [[chimpanzee]]); theoretically, as the human jaw receded into the face, the woman's body compensated with round breasts.<ref name="Bentley">{{cite journal|last=Bentley|first=Gillian R.|year=2001|title=The Evolution of the Human Breast|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=32|issue=38|doi=10.1002/ajpa.1033|pages=30–50}}</ref>

In a woman, the condition of lactation unrelated to pregnancy can occur as [[galactorrhea]] (spontaneous milk flow), and because of the [[adverse effect]]s of drugs (e.g. [[Antipsychotic|antipsychotic medications]]), of extreme physical stress, and of [[endocrine]] disorders. In a newborn infant, the capability of lactation is consequence of the mother's circulating hormones ([[prolactin]], [[oxytocin]], etc.) in his or her blood stream, which were introduced by the shared circulatory system of the [[placenta]]. In men, the mammary glands are also present in the body, but normally remain undeveloped because of the hormone [[testosterone]], however, when [[male lactation]] occurs, it is considered a pathological symptom of a disorder of the [[pituitary gland]].

==Aging==
{{Main|Ptosis (breasts)}}
[[File:Stades de affaissement.png|thumb|The seven stages of breast ptosis.]]
Breast ptosis, or sagging of the breasts, is a normal consequence of aging<ref name=rodriguez /> where the breast tissue droops lower on the chest and the nipple points downward.<ref>{{cite web|last=Younai|first=S. Sean|title=Breast Sagging – Ptosis|url=http://www.beautifulself.com/breastlift_ptosis.htm|accessdate=26 January 2012}}</ref> Researchers have found that ptosis is influenced by several key factors: greater [[ageing|age]], higher [[body mass index]], larger [[bra size|bra cup size]], history of significant [[weight loss]] (>50 lbs), [[gravidity|number of pregnancies]], and history of [[cigarette]] [[smoking]].<ref name="thompson"/><ref name="pmid20354434">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rinker B, Veneracion M, Walsh CP | title = Breast ptosis: causes and cure | journal = Ann Plast Surg | volume = 64 | issue = 5 | pages = 579–84 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20354434 | doi = 10.1097/SAP.0b013e3181c39377 | url = }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Campolongo|first=Marianne|title=What Causes Sagging Breasts?|url=http://www.newimage.com/resource-center/sagging-breasts.html|accessdate=26 January 2012|date=5 December 2007}}</ref> It is not caused, as commonly believed by many women and medical practitioners, by [[breastfeeding]].<ref name="lauersen"/>

[[Plastic surgeon]]s categorize ptosis by evaluating the position of the [[nipple]] relative to the [[inframammary crease]] (where the underside of the breast meets the chest wall). This is determined by measuring from the center of the nipple to the [[suprasternal notch|sternal notch]] (at the top of the breast bone) to gauge how far the nipple has fallen. The standard [[Anthropometry|anthropometric]] measurement for young women is {{convert|21|cm}}.  This measurement is used to assess both breast ptosis and breast symmetry. The surgeon will assess the breast's angle of projection. The apex of the breast, which includes the nipple, can have a flat angle of projection (180 degrees) or acute angle of projection (greater than 180 degrees). The apex rarely has an angle greater than 60 degrees. The angle of the breast apex is partly determined by the tautness of the suspensory [[Cooper's ligaments]]. For example, when a woman lies on her back, the angle of the breast apex becomes a flat, obtuse angle (less than 180 degrees) while the base-to-length ratio of the breast ranges from 0.5 to 1.0.<ref name=rodriguez>{{cite web|title=Breast Lift Procedure|url=http://www.cosmeticsurg.net/procedures/breast-lift/|publisher=Ricardo L.

==Clinical significance==
{{Main|Breast disease}}

The breast is susceptible to numerous benign and malignant conditions. The most frequent benign conditions are [[puerperal mastitis]], [[fibrocystic breast changes]] and [[mastalgia]]. [[Breast cancer]] is one of the leading causes of death among women.

==Society and culture==

===Art history===
[[File:Θεά των Όφεων 6393.JPG|thumb|upright|A Cretan [[Snake Goddess]] from the  [[Minoan Civilization]], c. 1600&nbsp;BC.]]
In European pre-historic societies, sculptures of female figures with pronounced or highly exaggerated breasts were common. A typical example is the so-called [[Venus of Willendorf]], one of many [[Paleolithic]] [[Venus figurines]] with ample hips and bosom. Artifacts such as bowls, rock carvings and sacred statues with breasts have been recorded from 15,000&nbsp;BC up to late antiquity all across Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. Many female deities representing love and fertility were associated with breasts and breast milk. Figures of the Phoenician goddess [[Astarte]] were represented as pillars studded with breasts. [[Isis]], an Egyptian goddess who represented, among many other things, ideal motherhood, was often portrayed as suckling [[pharaohs]], thereby confirming their divine status as rulers. Even certain male deities representing regeneration and fertility were occasionally depicted with breast-like appendices, such as the river god [[Hapy]] who was considered to be responsible for the annual overflowing of the [[Nile]]. Female breasts were also prominent in the [[Minoan civilization]] in the form of the famous [[Snake Goddess]] statuettes. In [[Ancient Greece]] there were several cults worshipping the "Kourotrophos", the suckling mother, represented by goddesses such as [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], [[Hera]] and [[Artemis]]. The worship of deities symbolized by the female breast in Greece became less common during the first millennium. The popular adoration of female goddesses decreased significantly during the rise of the Greek city states, a legacy which was passed on to the later [[Roman Empire]].<ref>Yalom (1998) pp. 9–16; see Eva Keuls (1993), ''Reign of the Phallus: Sexual Politics in Ancient Athens'' for a detailed study of male-dominant rule in ancient Greece.</ref>

During the middle of the first millennium BC, Greek culture experienced a gradual change in the perception of female breasts. Women in art were covered in clothing from the neck down, including female goddesses like [[Athena]], the patron of Athens who represented heroic endeavor. There were exceptions: [[Aphrodite]], the goddess of love, was more frequently portrayed fully nude, though in postures that were intended to portray shyness or modesty, a portrayal that has been compared to modern [[Pin-up|pin ups]] by historian [[Marilyn Yalom]].<ref>Yalom (1998), p. 18.</ref> Although nude men were depicted standing upright, most depictions of female nudity in Greek art occurred "usually with drapery near at hand and with a forward-bending, self-protecting posture".<ref>Hollander (1993), p. 6.</ref> A popular legend at the time was of the [[Amazons]], a tribe of fierce female warriors who socialized with men only for procreation and even removed one breast to become better warriors (the idea being that the right breast would interfere with the operation of a bow and arrow). The legend was a popular motif in art during Greek and Roman antiquity and served as an antithetical cautionary tale.

Many women regard their breasts as important to their [[sexual attractiveness]], as a sign of [[femininity]] that is important to their [[Self-concept|sense of self]]. Due to this, when a woman considers her breasts deficient in some respect, she might choose to undergo a plastic surgery procedure to enhance them, either to have them [[Breast augmentation|augmented]] or to have them [[Breast reduction plasty|reduced]], or to have them [[reconstructive surgery|reconstructed]] if she suffered a deformative disease, such as [[breast cancer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sexarchive.info/ATLAS_EN/html/secondary_characteristics.html |title=Secondary sex characteristics |publisher=.hu-berlin.de |accessdate=2011-10-31}}</ref> After [[mastectomy]], the reconstruction of the breast or breasts is done with [[breast implants]] or autologous tissue transfer, using fat and tissues from the abdomen, which is performed with a [[TRAM flap]] or with a back (latissiumus muscle flap). [[Breast reduction plasty|Breast reduction]] surgery is a procedure that involves removing excess breast tissue, fat, and skin, and the repositioning of the nipple-areola complex.

Cosmetic improvement procedures include breast lift ([[mastopexy]]), [[breast augmentation]] with implants, and combination procedures; the two types of available [[breast implant]]s are models filled with [[silicone]] gel, and models filled with [[Saline (medicine)|saline solution]]. These types of breast surgery can also repair [[inverted nipple]]s by releasing [[Lactiferous duct|milk duct]] tissues that have become tethered. Furthermore, in the case of the [[Obesity|obese]] woman, a breast lift (mastopexy) procedure, with or without a breast volume reduction, can be part of an upper-body lift and contouring for the woman who has undergone massive body weight loss.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Surgery of the breast presents the health risk of interfering with the ability to breast-feed an infant child, and might include consequences such as altered sensation in the nipple-areola complex, interference with [[mammography]] (breast x-rays images) when there are breast implants present in the breasts. Regarding breastfeeding capability after breast reduction surgery, studies reported that women who underwent breast reduction can retain the ability to nurse an infant child, when compared to women in a control group who underwent breast surgery using a modern pedicle surgical technique.<ref name="Neifert">{{cite journal | last=Neifert | first=M |author2=DeMarzo S |author3=Seacat J |author4=Young D |author5=Leff M |author6=Orleans M  | title=The influence of breast surgery, breast appearance and pregnancy-induced changes on lactation sufficiency as measured by infant weight gain | journal=Birth | volume=17 | issue=1 | pages=31–38 | year=1990 | pmid=2288566 | doi=10.1111/j.1523-536X.1990.tb00007.x }}</ref><ref name="LLLsurgery">{{cite web | title=FAQ on Previous Breast Surgery and Breastfeeding | publisher=La Leche League International | date=29 August 2006 | url=http://www.lalecheleague.org/faq/surgery.html | accessdate=2007-02-11 }}</ref><ref name="DianaWest">{{cite web | last=West | first=Diana | title=Breastfeeding After Breast Surgery | publisher=Australian Breastfeeding Association | url =https://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/bfinfo/breastfeeding-after-breast-surgery | accessdate=2007-02-11 }}</ref><ref name="Korchin">{{cite journal |author=Cruz-Korchin N, Korchin L |title=Breast-feeding after vertical mammaplasty with medial pedicle |journal=Plast.

Because breasts are mostly fatty tissue, their shape can within limits be molded by clothing, such as [[foundation garment]]s. [[brassiere|Bras]] are commonly worn by about 90% of Western women,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1stbras.com/bra-cup-sizes.php|title=Bra Cup Sizes—getting fitted with the right size|publisher=1stbras.com|accessdate=11 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liv.com/right_bra.php|title=The Right Bra|publisher=Liv.com|accessdate=11 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/breast-supporting-act-a-century-of-the-bra-5334510.html|title=Breast supporting act: a century of the bra|date=15 August 2007|publisher=The Independent UK|accessdate=11 May 2010 | location=London}}</ref> and are often worn for support.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2275741/?tool=pmcentrez Breast size, bra fit and thoracic pain in young women: a correlational study] Retrieved 5 January 2012</ref> The [[social norm]] in most [[Western culture]]s is to cover breasts in public, though the extent of coverage varies depending on the social context.

Many cultures associate breasts with sexuality and tend to regard bare breasts as [[modesty|immodest]] or [[decency|indecent]]. In some cultures, like the [[Himba people|Himba]] in northern [[Namibia]],  bare-breasted women are normal, while a thigh is highly sexualised and not exposed in public.

In the United States, women who [[History of breastfeeding#Breastfeeding in public|breast-feed]] in public can receive negative attention. There have been instances where women have been asked to leave public venues. In New York, the [[topfreedom]] equality movement helped to bring a case, ''People v. Santorelli'' (1992), to the New York State Court of Appeals. They  ruled that New York's indecent exposure laws did not apply to a bare-breasted woman. Other (gender equality) efforts succeeded in most of Canada in the 1990s. Bare-breasted women are legal and culturally acceptable at public beaches in Australia and much of Europe.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Sexual characteristic===
{{See also|Mammary intercourse|Breast fetishism|Stimulation of nipples}}
In some cultures, breasts play a role in [[human sexual activity]]. Breasts and especially the nipples are among the various human [[erogenous zone]]s. They are sensitive to the touch as they have many nerve endings; and it is common to press or [[massage]] them with hands or [[stimulation of nipples|orally]] before or during sexual activity. Some women can achieve an [[orgasm]] from such activities. Research has suggested that the sensations are genital orgasms caused by nipple stimulation, and may also be directly linked to "the genital area of the brain".<ref>{{cite book|last=Levay|first=Simon|author2=Sharon McBride Valente|title=Human Sexuality, Second Edition|publisher = Sinauer Associates, Inc.|date=15 November 2005|isbn =978-0-87893-465-2}}</ref><ref name="Komisaruk">{{cite journal|author=Komisaruk, B.

===Anthropomorphic geography===
{{Main|Breast-shaped hill}}
There are many mountains named after the breast because they resemble it in appearance and so are objects of religious and ancestral veneration as a [[fertility symbol]] and of well-being. In Asia, there was "Breast Mountain", which had a cave where the [[Buddhist monk]] [[Bodhidharma]] (Da Mo) spent much time in [[meditation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usashaolintemple.org/chanbuddhism-history/ |title=The Story of Bodhidharma |publisher=Usashaolintemple.org |accessdate=2011-10-31}}</ref> Other such breast mountains are [[Mount Elgon]] on the [[Uganda]]-[[Kenya]] border, [[Lochnagar|Beinn Chìochan]] and the [[Maiden Paps, Caithness|Maiden Paps]] in [[Scotland]], the "Bundok ng Susong Dalaga" (Maiden's breast mountains) in [[Talim Island]], Philippines, the twin hills known as the [[Paps of Anu]] (''Dá Chích Anann'' or "the breasts of [[Anu (goddess)|Anu]]"), near [[Killarney]] in [[Ireland]], the 2,086&nbsp;m high ''Tetica de Bacares'' or "La Tetica" in the [[Sierra de Los Filabres]], [[Spain]], and [[Khao Nom Sao]] in [[Thailand]], [[Cerro Las Tetas]] in [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Aphrodite|Breasts of Aphrodite]] in Mykonos, among many others.
