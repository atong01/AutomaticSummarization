{{Life in Egypt}}

'''[[Transport]] in [[Egypt]]''' is centered in [[Cairo]] and largely follows the pattern of settlement along the [[Nile]]. The main line of the nation's rail system follows along the great river and is operated by [[Egyptian National Railways]]. The badly maintained road network has expanded rapidly to over 21,000 miles, covering the [[Nile Valley]] and [[Nile Delta]], [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Red Sea]] coasts, the [[sinai peninsula|Sinai]] and the Western oasis.

In addition to overseas routes, [[Egypt Air]] provides reliable domestic air service to major tourist destinations from its Cairo hub. The Nile River system (about 1,600&nbsp;km or 1,000&nbsp;mi) and the principal canals (1,600&nbsp;km.) are important locally for transportation.

The [[Suez Canal]] is a major waterway of international commerce and navigation, linking the [[Mediterranean]] and [[Red Sea]]. The ministry of transportation, along with other governmental bodies are responsible for transportation in Egypt. Major ports are [[Alexandria]], [[Port Said]], [[Damietta]] on the Mediterranean and [[Suez]] and [[Safaga]] on the Red Sea.

Egypt has one of the highest incidence of road fatalities per miles driven in the world.<ref name=travel>[http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1108.html "Egypt"].

Intercity roads are generally in good condition, but unmarked surfaces, stray animals, and disabled vehicles without lights or reflectors are among the many hazards that can be encountered on highways, especially after dark.<ref name=travel/>

Some roads, especially in the Sinai and southeastern part of the country, are off-limits to foreigners.<ref name=travel/>

A popular form of transportation is by boat. Even though Egypt has expanded and developed its road system, people still travel on the Nile to get from place to place.

==Road system==

Two routes in the [[Trans-African Highway network]] originate in [[Cairo]]. Egypt also has multiple highway links with [[Asia]] through the [[Arab Mashreq International Road Network]].
Egypt has a developing [[motorway]] network, connecting Cairo with Alexandria and other cities. Though most of the transport in the country is still done on the national highways, motorways are becoming increasingly an option in road transport within the country. The existing motorways in the country are:

*Cairo - Alexandria Deser Road: It runs between [[Cairo]] and [[Alexandria]], with an extension of 215&nbsp;km, it is the main motorway in Egypt.
*International Coastal Road: It runs from [[Alexandria]] to [[Port Said]], along the Northern Nile Delta. It has a length of 280&nbsp;km. Also, amongst other cities, it connects [[Damietta]] and [[Baltim]].
*Geish Road: It runs between [[Helwan]] and [[Asyut]], along the Nile River, also connecting [[Beni Suef]] and [[Minya, Egypt|Minya]]. Its length is 306&nbsp;km.
*Ring Road: It serves as an inner ring-road for [[Cairo]]. It has a length of 103&nbsp;km.
*Regional Ring Road: It serves as an outer ring road for [[Cairo]], also connecting its suburbs like [[Helwan]] and [[10th of Ramadan City]]. Its length is 130&nbsp;km.

Plus, Egypt has developed an extensive system of 4-lane highways that can be classified as [[freeways]], because they serve as normal roads and do not discriminate the traffic on it, thus rendering them slower than motorways.

== Railways ==

The Egyptian railway system is the oldest railway network in [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]]. The first line between Alexandria and Kafer Eassa was opened in 1854. Today, the system is about 7,063&nbsp;km long and is operated by the [[Egyptian National Railways]]. ENR carries about 800 million passengers and 12 million tonnes of freight annually. A major investment programme is planned to begin in 2007 with the aim of modernising the rail network and improving safety standards.<ref>[http://www.railwaygazette.com/features_view/article/2007/08/7643/egyptian_investment_will_raise_safety_standards.html Egyptian investment will raise safety standards]. ''[[Railway Gazette International]]'' August 2007.</ref> Trains are usually a safe means of transportation in Egypt.<ref name=travel/>

The city of Cairo is served by the [[Cairo Metro]], which is run by the National Authority for Tunnels.
In addition to the city of [[Alexandria]] that is served by the [[Alexandria Tram]]
