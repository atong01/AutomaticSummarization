The river's name comes from the [[French language|French]] ''Rivière du Détroit'', meaning ''River of the Strait''. The Detroit River has served an important role in the [[history of Detroit]] and is one of the busiest waterways in the world.<ref name=detnews>{{Cite news|author=Nolan, Jenny | title=How the Detroit River shaped lives and history |url=http://apps.detnews.com/apps/history/index.php?id=186 |work=The Detroit News |location=Detroit, Michigan |date=11 February 1997 | accessdate=June 15, 2009}}</ref> The river travels west and south from [[Lake St. Clair]] to [[Lake Erie]], and the whole river is coterminous with the [[Canada–United States border|international border]] between [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].

The river serves as an important transportation route connecting [[Lake Michigan]], [[Lake Huron|Huron]], and [[Lake Superior|Superior]] to the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway|St. Lawrence Seaway]] and [[Erie Canal]]. When Detroit underwent rapid industrialization at the turn of the 20th century, the Detroit River became notoriously [[water pollution|polluted]] and toxic. In recent years, however, the ecological importance of the river has warranted a vast restoration effort, and the river today has a wide variety of economical and recreational uses. There are numerous [[List of islands in the Detroit River|islands in the Detroit River]], and much of the lower portion of the river is incorporated into the [[Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge]]. The portion of the river in the city of Detroit has been organized into the [[Detroit International Riverfront]] and the [[William G. Milliken State Park and Harbor]]. The Detroit River is designated an [[American Heritage Rivers|American Heritage River]] and a [[Canadian Heritage Rivers System|Canadian Heritage River]] — the only river to have this dual designation.<ref name=AHRS/><ref name=CHRS/>

==Geography==
The Detroit River flows for {{convert|24|nmi|km mi|lk=in}} from [[Lake St. Clair]] to [[Lake Erie]].<ref name=NHD/> By definition, this classifies it as both a [[river]] and a [[strait]] — a strait being a narrow passageway connecting two large bodies of water,<ref>{{Cite web|last=[[Merriam–Webster]] |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/strait%5B3%5D |year=2009 |title=Definition of strait (noun) |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}</ref> which is how the river earned its name from early French settlers.<ref>{{Cite web| last=[[Windsor Public Library]] |url=http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Folklore/english/intro/francophonese.htm |year=2004 |title=Who are the Detroit River French? |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}</ref> However, today, the Detroit River is rarely referred to as a strait, because bodies of water referred to as straits are typically much wider. The Detroit River is only {{convert|0.5|to|2.5|mi}} wide. The Detroit River starts on an east to west flow but then bends and runs north to south. The deepest portion of the Detroit River is {{convert|53|ft}} deep in the northern portion of the river. At its source, the river is at an elevation of {{convert|574|ft}} above sea level. The river drops only three feet before entering into Lake Erie at {{convert|571|ft}}. As the river contains no [[dam]]s and no [[lock (water transport)|locks]], it is easily [[Navigability|navigable]] by even the smallest of vessels. The [[Drainage basin|watershed basin]] for the Detroit River is approximately {{convert|700|sqmi|km2}}.<ref name=EPA/> Since the river is fairly short, it has few tributaries. Its largest tributary is the [[River Rouge (Michigan)|River Rouge]] in Michigan, which is actually four times longer than the Detroit River and contains most of the basin. The only other major American tributary to the Detroit River is the much smaller [[Ecorse River]]. Tributaries on the Canadian side include Little Creek and the [[River Canard, Ontario|River Canard]]. The [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] for the Detroit River is relatively high for a river of its size. The river's average discharge is approximately 188,000 [[Cubic foot per second|cubic feet per second]] (5,324 [[Cubic metre per second|m³/s]]), and the river's flow is constant.<ref>{{Cite web|last=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] |url=http://www.epa.gov/ecopage/aquatic/lkstrugeon/index.html |date=9 March 2006|title=Spawning by Lake Sturgeon in the Detroit River |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}</ref>
[[File:Detroit-River.png|250px|thumb|left|Location of the Detroit River in the [[Great Lakes]] system]]
The Detroit River forms a major element of the [[Canada–United States border|international border]] between the United States and Canada. The river on the American side is all under the jurisdiction of [[Wayne County, Michigan]], and the Canadian side is under the administration of [[Essex County, Ontario]]. The largest city along the Detroit River is [[Detroit]], and most of the population along the river lives in [[Michigan]]. The Detroit River has only two automobile traffic crossings connecting the United States and Canada: the [[Ambassador Bridge]] and the [[Detroit–Windsor Tunnel]]. Both of these are heavily protected by the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] and the [[Canada Border Services Agency]].

The upper portion of the river is one of the few places where a Canadian city lies directly south of an American city. In this case, the city of [[Detroit]] is directly north of the city of [[Windsor, Ontario]]. The only other location where this occurs is [[Fort Erie, Ontario]], lying south of several cities in [[Niagara County, New York]]. The cities and communities southwest of Detroit along the American side of the river are popularly referred to as the [[Downriver]] area, because those areas are said to be "down the river" from Detroit. Several of these communities do not actually border the Detroit River; the term "Downriver" is used to refer to a cluster of 18 suburban communities that lie to the southwest of the city of Detroit and to the west of the Detroit River.

===Islands===
{{Main|List of islands in the Detroit River}}
The Detroit River contains numerous islands, whose ownership and control varies depending on their location along the river. The majority are on the American side of the river; there are none that are divided by the international border. Many are very small and uninhabited. However, [[Grosse Ile (Michigan)|Grosse Ile]] on the U.S. side and [[Bois Blanc Island (Ontario)|Bois Blanc (Boblo) Island]] on the Canadian side have permanent populations. Most are in the southern portion of the waterway, close to where the river empties into Lake Erie. [[Belle Isle Park|Belle Isle]], in the northern section of the river, is a [[Michigan State Park]], and is open to the public via a bridge connection with the city.

==History==
{{See also|History of Detroit}}
The Detroit River was first navigated by non-natives in the 17th century. The [[Iroquois]] traded [[Fur clothing|furs]] with the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch colonists]] at [[New Amsterdam]] by traveling through the Detroit River.<ref name=detnews/> The [[French colonial empire|French]] later claimed the area for [[New France]]. The famed sailing ship ''[[Le Griffon]]'' reached the mouth of the Detroit River in mid-August 1679 on its maiden voyage through the Great Lakes.<ref>{{Cite web|first=Ken |last=VanEseltine |url=http://my.net-link.net/~vaneselk/ussgryphon/name.htm |date=26 August 2008 |title=''Le Griffon'' is a Meaningful Name |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}</ref> Later, when the French began settling in the area, they navigated the river using [[canoe]]s made of [[birch]] or [[elm]] bark. Handcrafted vessels were a common mode of travel across the river, and the [[pirogue]] and [[bateaux]] were also used. As the [[North American fur trade]] intensified, European settlers began expanding their trade westward into the uncharted territories. French explorer [[Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac]] sailed up the Detroit River on July 23, 1701. The next day, he established [[Fort Detroit|Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit]], which became Detroit.<ref>{{Cite web|first=T. |last=Granzo |url=http://www.historydetroit.com/people/antoine_cadillac.asp |year=2008 |title=History of Detroit: Antoine de la Mothe, Sieur de Cadillac |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}</ref> The river itself became known as the Rivière du Détroit, in which ''détroit'' is [[French language|French]] for "[[strait]]". The river was known literally as the "River of the Strait".

The Detroit River — and the larger area surrounding it — was taken from the French by [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] during the [[French and Indian War]]. It was claimed by the newly formed [[United States]] during the [[American Revolution]] but was not turned over by the British until 1796. During the [[War of 1812]], the Detroit River served as a major barrier between the American [[Michigan Territory]] and British [[Upper Canada]], especially during the [[Siege of Detroit|Battle of Fort Detroit]] in August 1812, when Detroit briefly fell to the British.<ref>{{Cite web| first=J. |last=Rickard|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_detroit.html |date=21 November 2007 |title=Battle of Detroit, 16 August 1812 |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}</ref> Following the completion of the [[Erie Canal]] in 1817, which opened up easier travel to Lake Erie from the [[East Coast of the United States]], the Detroit River became a heavily traversed route for settlers traveling to northern Michigan, and Detroit, as well, experienced a sudden increase in population. Following the [[Patriot War]] which nearly saw a battle between British regulars and Michigan militia on the ice-covered Detroit River, [[Fort Wayne (Detroit)|Fort Wayne]] was constructed at Detroit to counter Britain's riverside [[Fort Malden]] at Amherstburg. During the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865), the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] feared that the seceded [[Confederate States of America]] (CSA) would plan a northerly attack from Canada, which was still owned by the British Empire and remained neutral in the war. The Union feared that the CSA would cross the Detroit River to launch this attack. For that reason, the Detroit River was heavily patrolled and the fortification at Fort Wayne improved, even though it was far removed from any real combat. While no major attack came from Canada, a plot to capture the U.S. Navy warship, [[USS Michigan (1843)|USS ''Michigan'']] and liberate Confederate prisoners from [[USS Michigan (1843)#American Civil War|Johnson Island]], in western Lake Erie, was narrowly averted only after the Confederates had captured two passenger steamships.<ref name=detnews/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/w/wolverine-i.html |title=''Wolverine'' |author=Naval History And Heritage Command |date= |work=Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships |publisher=Naval History And Heritage Command |accessdate=25 January 2015 |ref={{sfnref|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships: ''Wolverine''}}}}</ref> At the beginning of the 20th century, Detroit's industrialization took off on an unprecedented scale. The Detroit River became the busiest commercial river in the world and was dubbed "the Greatest Commercial Artery on Earth" by ''[[The Detroit News]]'' in 1908. In 1907, the Detroit River carried 67,292,504 tons (61 billion kg) of shipping commerce through Detroit to locations all over the world. For comparison, [[London]] shipped 18,727,230 tons (16 billion kg), and [[New York City|New York]] shipped 20,390,953 tons (18 billion kg).<ref name=detnews/>

===Prohibition===
On January 16, 1919, the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] was ratified, ushering in [[Prohibition in the United States]], which lasted from 1920 to 1933. To go into effect one year after its ratification, the sale, manufacture, and transportation of [[alcoholic beverages|alcohol]] for consumption were nationally banned. Detroit was (and still is) the largest city bordering Canada, where alcohol remained legal during Prohibition. Detroit became the center of a new industry known as [[rum-running]], which was the illegal [[smuggling]] or transporting of alcoholic beverages or any other illegal drinks during Prohibition. There were no bridges in the area connecting Canada and the United States until the [[Ambassador Bridge]] was finished in 1929 and the [[Detroit–Windsor Tunnel]] in 1930. Since [[ferry]] services were inoperable during the winter months, "rum-runners" traveled across the frozen Detroit River by car to Canada and back with trunk loads of alcohol. [[Rum-running in Windsor]] became a very common practice. This led to the rise of mobsters such as [[the Purple Gang]], who regularly traveled across the frozen river and used violence as a means to control the route known as the "Detroit-Windsor Funnel" — parodying the newly built tunnel.<ref>{{Cite web| first=Mark |last=Gribben |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/gang/purple/1.html |year=2008 |title=The Purple Gang: Bootlegger's Paradise |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}</ref> The river typically freezes over during much of the winter. Detroit became the leader in the illegal importation of alcohol, which found its way all over the country. The Detroit River, [[Lake St. Clair]], and the [[St. Clair River]] carried 75% of all liquor smuggled into the United States during Prohibition. During warmer months, specialized boats were used to haul alcohol across the river. There was no limit on the methods used by rum-runners to import alcohol across the river. Government officials were unable or unwilling to deter the flow of alcohol coming across the Detroit River. In some cases, overloaded cars fell through the ice, and today, car parts from this illegal era can still be seen on the bottom of the river. When Prohibition was repealed in 1933 by the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment]], the rum-running industry ended.<ref name=detnews/><ref>{{Cite web|last=LaFaive, Fleenor, and Nesbit |url=http://www.mackinac.org/article.aspx?ID=10016 |date=3 December 2008 |title=The Appendix B: Prohibition in Michigan and the Avenue de Booze |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|first=Philip |last=Mason |url=http://www.michiganhistorymagazine.com/extra/2008/marapr/couldnt_get_drink.html |date=Sep–Oct 1994 |title=Anyone Who Couldn’t Get a Drink Wasn’t Tryin’ |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}</ref>

===Pollution and conservation efforts===
Much of the land surrounding the Detroit River is urbanized and, in some places, heavily industrialized. This has resulted in excessive [[water pollution]] from the unregulated dumping of chemicals and industrial waste for many decades. Much of the garbage and sewage from Detroit's rapid industrialization found its way into the river. Much of the Detroit River and its shoreline were heavily polluted and unsafe for recreational use. Large quantities of this pollution collected around the mouth of the Detroit River at [[Lake Erie]]. The pollutants were so high after the spring thaw that thousands of migrating birds were killed by oil slicks and contaminated water every year. Oxygen levels in the river were depleted to the point where fish were unable to inhabit its waters. Because much of this pollution drained into and affected Lake Erie, the lake itself was considered "dead" and unable to support aquatic life.<ref name=hartig>{{Cite web| first=John |last=Hartig |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/hunting/columns/story?columnist=swan_james&page=g_col_swan_det_river |date=17 July 2007|title=The Detroit River's amazing comeback |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}</ref><ref name=swan>{{Cite web| first=James |last=Swan |url=http://www.glu.org/news/2009/03/return-of-the-detroit-river%E2%80%99s-charismatic-megafauna/ |date=19 March 2009|title=Return of the Detroit River’s Charismatic Megafauna |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}</ref>
[[File:Mud Island in DRIWR.jpg|thumb|250px|Much of the lower portion of the river ''([[List of islands in the Detroit River#Mud Island|Mud Island]] pictured)'' is now part of the [[Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge]].]]
In 1961, the Wyandotte National Wildlife Refuge was founded by congressional order. That paved the way for tighter restrictions on industries and allocated substantial amounts of government funding to clean up the river. However, there was little support toward cleaning up the river, because it would negatively affect Detroit's industrialism and economy. In 1970, the entire [[fishing industry]] in the [[St. Clair River]], [[Lake St. Clair]], the Detroit River, and Lake Erie had to be closed due to toxic levels of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] found in the water. This, in turn, spurred a massive conservation effort aimed at cleaning up the Detroit River.<ref name=hartig/> For years before, conservation efforts were halted by the enormous multi-million dollar cost of removing pollutants from the river. In addition to that, industries, which had significant political influence, detested the regulations necessary to lessen the amount of pollutants in the river.<ref name=swan/> In 2001, the Wyandotte National Wildlife Refuge was absorbed into the much larger [[Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge]], which is a cooperative effort between the United States and Canada to preserve the area as an ecological refuge. Millions of dollars so far have been used to dredge pollutants out of the river, and the recent cleaning up and restoration of the Detroit River is remarkable, although other problems are still at hand.<ref name=hartig/> Today, many species of native animals are returning to the area after being driven out by human development. The Detroit River is home to a growing number of bird species, such as [[eagle]]s (including reintroduced [[bald eagle]]s), [[osprey]]s, and [[peregrine falcon]]s. Fish species in abundance in the area include [[lake whitefish]], [[sturgeon]], [[silver bass]], [[black bass]], [[salmon]], [[perch]], and [[walleye]].<ref name=swan/> The Detroit River was designated as an [[American Heritage Rivers|American Heritage River]] in 1998<ref name=AHRS>{{Cite web|last=[[American Heritage Rivers]] |url=http://www.epa.gov/rivers/98rivers/detroit.html |date=19 October 2006 |title=Detroit River (MI): An American Heritage Designated River |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}</ref> and a [[Canadian Heritage Rivers System|Canadian Heritage River]] in 2001<ref name=CHRS>{{Cite web|last=[[Canadian Heritage Rivers System]] |url=http://www.chrs.ca/Rivers/Detroit/Detroit_e.htm |title=Detroit River, Ontario: A Unique International Heritage |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}</ref> — the only river to have dual designations.

==Economy==
{{See also|Economy of metropolitan Detroit}}

The Detroit River is used for shipping and trading. The earliest use of the river for such economic activities was the shipping of furs for trade as early as the 17th century.<ref name=detnews/> When the [[North American fur trade|fur trade]] decreased, Michigan had already begun to exploit the [[lumber]]-rich areas of Northern Michigan and the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]]. Detroit turned into a major industrial region, largely because of the Detroit River. The only way a ship could travel out of the upper Great Lakes system was to travel down the Detroit River. From there, ships could travel anywhere in the world out of the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway|St. Lawrence Seaway]] or the [[Erie Canal]] to [[New York City]]. At the beginning of the 20th century, the automotive industry boomed, and the many manufacturers shipped in abundant supplies of [[iron ore]], sand, limestone and wood.

[[File:Detroit GM headquarters.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Renaissance Center]], located in [[downtown Detroit]], is one of the most recognizable features along the shores of the Detroit River.]]
First hand, the Detroit River provides a substantial amount of revenue for the local economies. A study in 1991 showed that $20.1 million came from sales related to waterfowl hunting along the Detroit River. During the same year, bird watching, photography, and other non-consumptive uses of waterfowl contributed an additional $192.8 million to Michigan’s economy. Local economies benefit through boating registrations and fishing licenses. It is estimated that walleye fishing alone brings in $1 million to the economy of communities along the lower Detroit River each spring.<ref>{{Cite web|last=International Association for Great Lakes Research |url=http://www.iaglr.org/scipolicy/issues/detroithabitat.php |title=Conserving Detroit River Habitats|year= 2009|accessdate=June 16, 2009}}</ref> Other fish caught by recreational fisherman include [[white bass]], [[bluegill]], [[crappie]], [[freshwater drum]], [[smallmouth bass]], [[northern pike]] and [[muskie]]. There are over 800,000 recreation boats in the state of Michigan, and more than half of those are regularly used on or near the Detroit River. A percentage of the tourist revenue depends on the Detroit River, which is the most noticeable environmental feature in Detroit. Popular river destinations in the city of Detroit include the [[Detroit International Riverfront]] and [[Belle Isle Park]] — both of which host a number of events throughout the year. Several restaurants on the river have dock facilities for boaters. Tour boats and dinner cruises travel through the sights of Detroit and the undeveloped islands downriver.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Detroit Princess Riverboat |url=http://www.detroitprincess.com/ |title=Detroit Princess Riverboat| year=2009| accessdate=June 16, 2009}}</ref> Cruise ships support tourism on the Great Lakes and dock at the Port Detroit passenger terminal downtown. The iconic [[Renaissance Center]] is located on the banks of the Detroit River.

According to a 2004 study, 150,000 jobs and $13 billion in annual production depend on the river crossings connecting Detroit to Windsor. In 2004, the total American trade with Ontario alone was $407 billion, in which 28% ($113.3 billion) crossed the Detroit River. 

The only two automobile traffic routes that completely cross the river are the privately owned [[Ambassador Bridge]] and the [[Detroit-Windsor Tunnel]], both of which connect Detroit, Michigan to Windsor, Ontario. A railway tunnel and a commercial truck ferry service also travel between Detroit and Windsor. In Michigan, there are two bridges connecting the mainland to [[Grosse Ile Township, Michigan|Grosse Ile]] and the [[MacArthur Bridge (Detroit)|MacArthur Bridge]], popularly known as the "Belle Isle Bridge," that connects the City of Detroit to [[Belle Isle Park]]. All crossings (ports of entry) on the American side are secured by the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]]'s Office of Field Operations and on the Canadian side by the [[Canada Border Services Agency]]; all areas between the American ports of entry and on the American side of the river are secured by the [[United States Border Patrol]].

Proposals have been made to create a [[Detroit River International Crossing|third crossing]] to connect Detroit and Windsor. The exact location for this crossing is the most debated element, as it could negatively affect a large number of environmental features and communities along the river.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Detroiter Contributor |url=http://www.detroiteronline.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1159%3f |title=Detroit/Windsor Border Update: Part I-Detroit River International Crossing Study | date=1 November 2005| accessdate=June 16, 2009}}</ref> The [[Gordie Howe International Bridge]] is a new bridge project expected to begin construction in 2015; it will directly connect [[Ontario Highway 401|Highway 401]] in Canada to [[Interstate 75]] in the U.S.
