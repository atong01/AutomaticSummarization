'''Buffalo''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ʌ|f|ə|l|oʊ}}) is a city in [[Western New York]] and the [[County seat|seat]] of [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]], located on the eastern shores of [[Lake Erie]] at the head of the [[Niagara River]]. As of 2014, Buffalo is the second most populous city in the state after [[New York City]] with 258,703 residents, and the [[Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] is the [[List of United States metropolitan areas|45th largest]] in the United States.

Buffalo experienced significant growth in the 19th and 20th centuries as a direct result of the [[Erie Canal]], railroads and Lake Erie, providing an abundance of fresh water and an ample trade route to the [[Midwestern United States]], while grooming its economy for the grain, steel and automobile industries during the 20th century. Since experiencing an economic downturn in the latter half of the 20th century, Buffalo's economy has transitioned to sectors that include financial services, technology, [[Biomedical engineering|biomedical]] and education.

Residents of Buffalo are called "[[List of people from Buffalo, New York|Buffalonians]]".

=== Modern history ===
Like other [[rust belt]] cities such as [[Pittsburgh, PA|Pittsburgh]] and [[Cleveland]], Buffalo has attempted to revitalize its beleaguered economy and crumbling infrastructure. In the first decade of the 21st century, a massive increase in economic development spending has attempted to reverse its dwindling prosperity. In the early 2010s, growth from local colleges and universities continued to spur economic development.

==Geography and climate==
Buffalo is located on the eastern end of [[Lake Erie]], opposite Fort Erie, Ontario, and at the beginning of the Niagara River, which flows northward over [[Niagara Falls]] and into [[Lake Ontario]]. The city is {{convert|50|mi|km}} south-southeast from [[Toronto]]. Buffalo's position on Lake Erie, facing westward, makes it one of the only major cities on the East Coast to have sunsets over a body of water.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|52.5|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|40.6|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|11.9|sqmi|km2}} is water. The total area is 22.66% water.

Buffalo has the sunniest and driest summers of any major city in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], but still has enough rain to keep vegetation green and lush.<ref name=nws/> Summers are marked by plentiful sunshine and moderate [[humidity]] and temperature.<ref name=nws/> It receives, on average, over 65% of possible sunshine in June, July and August.

Obscured by the notoriety of Buffalo's winter snow is the fact that Buffalo benefits from other lake effects such as the cooling southwest breezes off Lake Erie in summer that gently temper the warmest days.<ref name="nws" /> As a result, temperatures only rise above {{convert|90|F|1|abbr=on}} three times per year,<ref name="nws" /> and the Buffalo station of the National Weather Service has never recorded an official temperature of {{convert|100|F|1|abbr=on}} or more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USNY0181?from=tenDay_bottomnav_undeclared |title=Record high of {{convert|99|F|0|abbr=on}} was recorded in August 1948 |publisher=Weather.com |date=July 27, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207164221/http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USNY0181?from=tenDay_bottomnav_undeclared |archivedate=December 7, 2013 }}</ref> Rainfall is moderate but typically occurs at night.

|}[[File:Buffalo NY historical population.png|left|thumb|Population of Buffalo, 1830–2006]]Like most formerly industrial cities of the [[Great Lakes]] region in the United States, Buffalo is recovering from an economic depression brought about by suburbanization and the loss of its industrial base. The city's population peaked in 1950, when it was the 15th largest city in the United States, and its population has been spreading out to the suburbs every census since then. The demographic change and the impact of such change on the industrial cities of the region, including Buffalo, was significant; based on the 2006 US Census estimate, Buffalo's current population was equivalent to its population in the year 1890, reversing 120 years of demographic change. On the other hand, the populations of surrounding suburbs such as Amherst, Clarence, Orchard Park, Cheektowaga, etc. have increased proportionally as automobile-centric lifestyles developed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

At the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]], the city's population was 50.4% White (45.8% non-Hispanic White alone), 38.6% Black or African-American, 0.8% American Indian and Alaska Native, 3.2% Asian, 3.9% from some other race and 3.1% from two or more races. 10.5% of the total population was Hispanic or Latino of any race.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/36/3611000.html |title=Buffalo Demographics: 2010 |publisher=quickfacts.census.go |accessdate=November 8, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504172555/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/36/3611000.html |archivedate=May 4, 2014 }}</ref>

The [[median household income|median income]] for a household in the city is $24,536, and the median income for a family is $30,614. Males have a median income of $30,938 versus $23,982 for females. The per capita income for the city is $14,991. 26.6% of the population and 23.0% of families are below the poverty line. Out of the total population, 38.4% of those under the age of 18 and 14.0% of those 65 and older are living below the poverty line.

[[File:RWS2015.jpg|thumbnail|left|A cameraman shoots a game at [[Ralph Wilson Stadium]].]]
Buffalo and the surrounding region is home to two major league [[professional sports]] teams. The [[Buffalo Sabres]] of the [[NHL]] play in the City of Buffalo, and the [[Buffalo Bills]], charter members of the [[American Football League]], (now in the [[NFL]]) play in the suburb of [[Orchard Park, New York]]. Buffalo is also home to several minor sports teams including the [[Buffalo Bisons]] ([[baseball]]), [[Buffalo Bandits]] ([[Box lacrosse|indoor lacrosse]]) and [[FC Buffalo]] ([[Association football|soccer]]) as well as a professional women's team the [[Buffalo Beauts]] ([[Hockey]]). The [[Buffalo Bulls]] are a [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] college team representing the [[State University of New York at Buffalo]], and several other Buffalo-area colleges and universities are also active in college athletics.

The Buffalo Bills, established in 1959, played in [[War Memorial Stadium (Buffalo)|War Memorial Stadium]] until 1973, when Ralph Wilson Stadium was constructed. The team competes in the [[AFC East]] division. Since the [[AFL–NFL merger]] in 1970, the Bills have won the division title seven times (1980, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1995), and the [[American Football Conference|AFC]] conference championship four consecutive times (1990, 1991, 1992, 1993), resulting in four lost [[Super Bowl]]s.

The Buffalo Sabres, established in 1970, played in [[Buffalo Memorial Auditorium]] until 1996, when [[Marine Midland Arena]], now First Niagara Center, opened. The team is within the [[Atlantic Division (NHL)|Atlantic Division of the NHL]]. The team has won six division titles, one [[Presidents' Trophy]] (2006–07) and three conference championships (1974–75, 1979–80, 1998–99). However, like the Buffalo Bills, the team does not have a league championship.

The Buffalo Bandits, established in 1992, played home games in Buffalo Memorial Auditorium until their move to Marine Midland Arena. They have won eight division championships and four league championships (1992, 1993, 1996, 2008).

==Parks and recreation==
{{Main|Buffalo, New York parks system}}
[[File:Canalside Naval.jpg|thumb|right|View of Canalside and Buffalo Naval Park]]
[[File:Delaware Park lake.jpg|thumb|left|Lake within Delaware Park]]
The Buffalo parks system contains over 20 parks with multiple parks accessible from any part of the city. The Olmsted Park and Parkway System is the hallmark of Buffalo's many green spaces. Three-fourths of city park land is part of the system, which comprises six major parks, eight connecting parkways, nine circles and seven smaller spaces. Constructed in 1868 by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and his partner [[Calvert Vaux]], the system was integrated into the city and marks the first attempt in America to lay out a coordinated system of public parks and parkways. The Olmsted designed portions of the Buffalo park system are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and are maintained by the Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy.

Situated at the confluence of Lake Erie and the Buffalo River and Niagara Rivers, Buffalo is a waterfront city. The city's rise to economic power came through its waterways in the form of [[transshipment]], manufacturing, and an endless source of energy. Buffalo's waterfront remains, though to a lesser degree, a hub of commerce, trade, and industry.

As of 2009, a significant portion of Buffalo's waterfront is being transformed into a focal point for social and recreational activity. To this end, [[Buffalo Harbor State Park]] was opened on Buffalo's outer harbor in 2014.<ref name=BuffNews_BHSP>{{cite web |url=http://www.buffalonews.com/city-region/downtown-waterfront/buffalo8217s-first-state-park-to-start-taking-shape-on-outer-harbor-20140827 |title=Buffalo's first state park to start taking shape on outer harbor |newspaper=The Buffalo News |date=August 27, 2014 |author=Mark Sommer |accessdate=April 12, 2015}}</ref> Buffalo's intent is to stress its architectural and historical heritage, creating a tourism destination.

An ongoing project within downtown Buffalo is the development of "Canalside," intended to revitalize the original [[Erie Canal Harbor]] with shops, eateries, and tourist attractions. An early phase of the project was the excavation and filling of Erie Canal [[Commercial Slip]], which is the original western terminus of the Erie Canal System. Currently, work is underway to restore the canal system which was displaced by the construction of the [[Buffalo Memorial Auditorium]].

==Government==

{{Main|Politics and Government of Buffalo, New York}}
{{See also|List of mayors of Buffalo, New York}}[[File:Buffalo federal court.jpg|thumb|right|[[Robert H. Jackson United States Courthouse]]]]
At the [[City (New York)|municipal]] level, the City of Buffalo has a mayor and a council consisting of nine [[city council|councilmembers]]. Buffalo also serves as the seat of [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] with some of the 11 members of county legislature representing at least a portion of Buffalo. At the state level, there are three state [[New York State Assembly|assemblymembers]] and two state [[New York State Senate|senators]] representing parts of the city proper. At the federal level, Buffalo is represented by three members of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].[[File:McKinley Monument, Buffalo, NY - IMG 3702.JPG|thumb|left|[[Buffalo City Hall]], with [[McKinley Monument]] in the foreground.]]In a trend common to Northern "[[Rust Belt]]" regions, political life in Buffalo has been dominated by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] for the last half-century, and has been roiled by racial division and social issues. The last time anyone other than a Democrat held the position of Mayor in Buffalo was [[Chester A. Kowal]] in 1965. In 1977, Democratic Mayor [[James D. Griffin]] was first elected as the nominee of two minor parties, the [[Conservative Party (New York)|Conservative Party]] and the [[Right to Life Party]], after he lost the Democratic primary for Mayor to then Deputy State Assembly Speaker [[Arthur Eve]]. Griffin switched political allegiance several times during his 16 years as Mayor, generally hewing to socially conservative platforms. His successor, Democrat [[Anthony M. Masiello]] (elected in 1993) continued to campaign on [[social conservatism]], often crossing party lines in his endorsements and alliances. In 2005, however, Democrat [[Byron Brown]] was elected the city's first African-American mayor in a landslide (64%–27%) over [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Kevin Helfer, who ran on a conservative platform. In 2013, Brown would be endorsed by the Conservative Party because of his pledge to cut taxes.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

This change in local politics was preceded by a fiscal crisis in 2003 when years of economic decline, a diminishing tax-base, and civic mismanagement left the city deep in debt and teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. At the urging of [[New York State Comptroller]] [[Alan Hevesi]], the state took over the management of Buffalo's finances, appointing the Buffalo Fiscal Stability Authority. Conversations about merging the city with the larger Erie County government were initiated the following year by Mayor Tony Masiello, but came to naught.

The offices of the Buffalo District, [[US Army Corps of Engineers]] are located adjacent to the Black Rock Lock in the Black Rock channel of the Erie Canal. In addition to maintaining and operating the lock, the District is responsible for planning, design, construction and maintenance of water resources projects in an area extending from [[Toledo, Ohio]] to [[Massena (town), New York|Massena, New York]]. These include the [[Mount Morris Dam|flood-control dam]] at [[Mount Morris (town), New York|Mount Morris, New York]], oversight of the lower Great Lakes (Lake Erie and Lake Ontario), review and permitting of wetlands construction, and remedial action for hazardous waste sites.

Buffalo is also the home of a major office of the [[National Weather Service]] (NOAA), which serves all of western and much of central New York State.

Buffalo is home to one of the 56 national [[List of FBI field offices|FBI field offices]]. The field office covers all of Western New York and parts of the Southern Tier and Central New York. The field office operates several task forces in conjunction with local agencies to help combat issues such as gang violence, terrorism threats and health care fraud.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buffalo.fbi.gov/ |title=FBI Buffalo Division |publisher=Buffalo.fbi.gov |date=March 29, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310043306/http://buffalo.fbi.gov/ |archivedate=March 10, 2011 }}</ref>
