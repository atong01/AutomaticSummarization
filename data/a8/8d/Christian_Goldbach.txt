'''Christian Goldbach''' (March 18, 1690 &ndash; November 20, 1764) was a [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]] who also studied [[law]]. He is remembered today for [[Goldbach's conjecture]].

==Biography==
Born in the [[Duchy of Prussia]]'s capital [[Königsberg]], part of [[Brandenburg-Prussia]], Goldbach was the son of a pastor. He studied at the [[University of Königsberg|Royal Albertus University]].
After finishing his studies he went on long educational voyages from 1710 to 1724 through Europe, visiting other German states, England, Holland, Italy, and France, meeting with many famous mathematicians, such as [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[Leonhard Euler]], and [[Nicholas I Bernoulli]]. Back in Königsberg he got acquainted with [[Georg Bernhard Bilfinger]] and [[Jakob Hermann]].

He went on to work at the newly opened [[St Petersburg Academy of Sciences]] in 1725, as a professor of mathematics and historian of the academy.<ref name=eb>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Christian Goldbach |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=16 August 2013 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/237446/Christian-Goldbach |accessdate=26 October 2014}}</ref> In 1728, when [[Peter II of Russia|Peter II]] became [[Tsar]] of Russia, Goldbach became his tutor.<ref name=eb />  In 1742 he entered the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.<ref name="element">{{cite book |last=Rosen|first=Kenneth H.|title=Elementary Number Theory, Fifth Edition|year=2004|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=0-321-23707-2}}</ref>

Christian Goldbach was multilingual – he wrote a diary which was written in German and Latin, his letters were written in German, Latin, French, and Italian and for official documents he used Russian, German and Latin.<ref>Adolf Juskevic, Judith Kopelevic: Christian Goldbach 1690-1764 (Vita Mathematica), Birkhäuser Publishing House, 1994, ISBN 3764326786, pg. XII.</ref>

He died on November 20, 1764 at age of 74, in [[Moscow]].

==Contributions==
Goldbach is most noted for his correspondence with [[Leibniz]], [[Euler]], and [[Daniel Bernoulli|Bernoulli]], especially in his 1742 letter to Euler stating his [[Goldbach's conjecture]]. He also studied and proved some theorems on [[perfect power]]s, such as the [[Goldbach–Euler theorem]], and made several notable contributions to analysis.<ref name="element"/> He also proved a [[Fermat number#Basic properties|result]] concerning [[Fermat number]]s that is called Goldbach's theorem.
