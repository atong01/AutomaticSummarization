Schweizer suggests that Col was jointly written by Paul and Timothy. The position taken here is that Col is Deutero-Pauline; it was composed after Pauls lifetime, between AD 70 (Gnilka) and AD 80 (Lohse) by someone who knew the Pauline tradition. Lohse regards Col as the product of a Pauline school tradition, probably located in Ephesus.&quot; [TNJBC 1990 p. 877]</extension><space/>One ground is that the epistle's language doesn't seem to match Paul's, with 48 words appearing in Colossians that are found nowhere else in his writings and 33 of which occur nowhere else in the<space/><link><target>New Testament</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Koester, Intro">Koester, Helmut.

The congregation has already been raised from the dead with Christ ... whereas in the undisputed letters resurrection is a future expectation... The difference in eschatological orientation between Col and the undisputed letters results in a different theology of baptism... Whereas in Rom 6:14 baptism looks forward to the future, in Col baptism looks back to a completed salvation. In baptism believers have not only died with Christ but also been raised with him.

All things were created through him and for him, and the universe is sustained by him. God had chosen for his complete being to dwell in Christ. The &quot;cosmic powers&quot; revered by the false teachers had been &quot;discarded&quot; and &quot;led captive&quot; at Christ's death. Christ is the master of all angelic forces and the head of the church. Christ is the only mediator between God and humanity, the unique agent of cosmic reconciliation. Interestingly, it is the Father in Colossians who is said to have delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son (<template><target>bibleverse</target><arg></arg><arg>Colossians</arg><arg>1:12â€“13</arg><arg>31</arg></template>), not the typical way of articulating salvation today. The Son is the agent of reconciliation and salvation not merely of the church, but in some sense redeems the rest of creation as well (&quot;all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven&quot; (<template><target>bibleverse</target><arg></arg><arg>Colossians</arg><arg>1:20</arg><arg>31</arg></template>).</paragraph><paragraph>The doctrinal part comprises the first two chapters.

While in the case of 1 Corinthians, the love &quot;does not&quot; statements like boasting remind one of the criticisms of the Corinthians earlier in the book, Colossians is different. Paul looks at the faith, hope and love of the Colossian believers as evidence and validation of their faith experience. In introductory verses, 1:6,7, Paul states that the fruit seen in them started the day they understood the grace of God in truth. Conduct is a fruit of faith.</paragraph><paragraph>Colossians denounces<space/><link><target>ascetic</target></link><space/>practices or avoiding certain foods because Christ's death put an end to such distinctions. Believers are one in Christ, not divided between circumcised and uncircumcised, slave and free, and so on. He then calls on his audience to fulfill all domestic and social obligations. A striking image of religion by such rules used by Paul is his use of the word &quot;shadows&quot;. Some practices in the past may be shadows of what is to come, but Christ is the one who cast the shadow.</paragraph><paragraph>Colossians does not state with precision what heresies were being faced by the church. There are approximately 44 different theories what the heresies encountered by the church at Colossae were, including a view there was no particular heresy at all but issues typical of those faced by believers. Some argue that it is not merely fasting or feasting or particular area of emotions, conduct or intellect that are denounced but doing them with an independent spirit, not connected to Christ, the head of the body or lack of appreciation of the gospel of grace.</paragraph><paragraph>The practical part of the Epistle,<space/><template><target>Bibleref2-nb</target><arg>Colossians</arg><arg>3â€“4</arg></template>, enforces various duties naturally flowing from the doctrines expounded. They are exhorted to mind things that are above<space/><template><target>Bibleref2c-nb</target><arg>Colossians</arg><arg>3:1â€“4</arg></template>, to mortify every evil principle of their nature, and to put on the new man.<template><target>Bibleref2c-nb</target><arg>Colossians</arg><arg>3:5â€“14</arg></template><space/>Many special duties of the Christian life are also insisted upon as the fitting evidence of the Christian character.

For this I [Paul] toil, struggling with all his energy that he powerfully works within me.&quot; Then in Col 3:16, Paul's goal is that the Colossians themselves to in some manner continue in this ministry and admonish and test each other, &quot;one another&quot; as Paul did for them. Col 3:16: &quot;Let the word of Christ dwell in you [Colossian believers] richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God.&quot; In some sense, Paul would have the teaching and admonishing ministry continue by members of the church in Colossae, one method of members admonishing each other is through the rich hymnody and musical heritage of the Christian church.</paragraph><paragraph>Colossians has some interesting interpersonal dynamics. Epaphras, who first shared the good news to Colossi, near the opening of the book is presented as a beloved fellow servant&quot;one of us&quot; from Paul's ministry point of view. In contrast, towards the closing of the book he is called &quot;one of you&quot;. Onesimus is also referred to as &quot;one of you&quot; and an important helper of Paul who was the run away slave in the book of Philemon who became a believer. His past is not brought up. Mark and Barnabus parted company with Paul over Mark leaving the mission after violent opposition in the book of Acts, but here is reconciled to Paul and spoken of as a comfort. Epharoditus, Paul refers to as a fellow prisoner, we recognize as the person in the book of Acts who was literally dragged through the streets into court on charges. Paul acknowledges that most never saw his face in Colossae or Laodicea, yet was concerned throughout the book they were aware of the events going on with himself, and appointed Tychicus to inform them so that they should understand how great Paul's suffering for them has been. Paul always mentions his own name in his letters and here mentioned Luke, but in the book of Acts Luke himself never mentions his own name, referring to himself more obliquely only by the personal pronoun &quot;we&quot; (as does Matthew in his book).</paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Textual variants in the New Testament#Epistle to the Colossians</target><part>Textual variants in the Epistle to the Colossians</part></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Epistle to the Laodiceans</target></link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><extension extension_name='references'></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Bibliography</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem>R.
