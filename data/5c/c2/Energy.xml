For example,<space/><link><target>classical mechanics</target></link><space/>distinguishes between<space/><link><target>kinetic energy</target></link>, which is determined by an object's<space/><link><target>motion (physics)</target><part>movement</part></link><space/>through space, and<space/><link><target>potential energy</target></link>, which is a function of the position of an object within a<space/><link><target>Field (physics)</target><part>field</part></link>. It may also be convenient to distinguish gravitational energy, thermal energy, several types of nuclear energy (which utilize potentials from the<space/><link><target>nuclear force</target></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>weak force</target></link>), electric energy (from the<space/><link><target>electric field</target></link>), and magnetic energy (from the<space/><link><target>magnetic field</target></link>), among others. Many of these classifications overlap; for instance, thermal energy usually consists partly of kinetic and partly of potential energy.</paragraph><paragraph>Some types of energy are a varying mix of both potential and kinetic energy. An example is<space/><link><target>mechanical energy</target></link><space/>which is the sum of (usually macroscopic) kinetic and potential energy in a system. Elastic energy in materials is also dependent upon electrical potential energy (among atoms and molecules), as is chemical energy, which is stored and released from a reservoir of electrical potential energy between electrons, and the molecules or atomic nuclei that attract them.<space/><template><target>Quote request</target><arg name="date">January 2013</arg></template>.The list is also not necessarily complete. Whenever physical scientists discover that a certain phenomenon appears to violate the law of energy conservation, new forms are typically added that account for the discrepancy.</paragraph><paragraph>Heat and work are special cases in that they are not properties of systems, but are instead properties of<space/><italics>processes</italics><space/>that transfer energy. In general we cannot measure how much heat or work are present in an object, but rather only how much energy is transferred among objects in certain ways during the occurrence of a given process. Heat and work are measured as positive or negative depending on which side of the transfer we view them from.</paragraph><paragraph>Potential energies are often measured as positive or negative depending on whether they are greater or less than the energy of a specified base state or configuration such as two interacting bodies being infinitely far apart. Wave energies (such as radiant or sound energy), kinetic energy, and rest energy are each greater than or equal to zero because they are measured in comparison to a base state of zero energy: &quot;no wave&quot;, &quot;no motion&quot;, and &quot;no inertia&quot;, respectively.</paragraph><paragraph>The distinctions between different kinds of energy is not always clear-cut. As<space/><link><target>Richard Feynman</target></link><space/>points out:</paragraph><paragraph><template><target>quotation</target><arg>These notions of potential and kinetic energy depend on a notion of length scale. For example, one can speak of ''macroscopic'' potential and kinetic energy, which do not include thermal potential and kinetic energy. Also what is called chemical potential energy is a macroscopic notion, and closer examination shows that it is really the sum of the potential ''and kinetic'' energy on the atomic and subatomic scale. Similar remarks apply to nuclear "potential" energy and most other forms of energy. This dependence on length scale is non-problematic if the various length scales are decoupled, as is often the case ... but confusion can arise when different length scales are coupled, for instance when friction converts macroscopic work into microscopic thermal energy.</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Some examples of different kinds of energy:<template><target>Forms of energy</target></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>History</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>History of energy</arg><arg>timeline of thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and random processes</arg><arg></arg></template><link><target>File:Thomas Young (scientist).jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part><link><target>Thomas Young (scientist)</target><part>Thomas Young</part></link><space/>the first to use the term &quot;energy&quot; in the modern sense.</part></link>The word<space/><italics>energy</italics><space/>derives from the<space/><template><target>lang-grc</target><arg>ἐνέργεια</arg><arg>[[energeia]]</arg><arg>activity, operation</arg></template>,<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term</arg><arg name="title">Energy<space/></arg><arg name="work">Online Etymology Dictionary<space/></arg><arg name="last">Harper<space/></arg><arg name="first">Douglas<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">May 1, 2007</arg></template></extension><space/>which possibly appears for the first time in the work of<space/><link><target>Aristotle</target></link><space/>in the 4th century BC.

Conversely, the mass equivalent of a unit of energy is minuscule, which is why a loss of energy (loss of mass) from most systems is difficult to measure by weight, unless the energy loss is very large.

An irreversible process is one in which energy is dissipated (spread) into empty energy states available in a volume, from which it cannot be recovered into more concentrated forms (fewer quantum states), without degradation of even more energy. A reversible process is one in which this sort of dissipation does not happen. For example, conversion of energy from one type of potential field to another, is reversible, as in the pendulum system described above. In processes where heat is generated, quantum states of lower energy, present as possible excitations in fields between atoms, act as a reservoir for part of the energy, from which it cannot be recovered, in order to be converted with 100% efficiency into other forms of energy. In this case, the energy must partly stay as heat, and cannot be completely recovered as usable energy, except at the price of an increase in some other kind of heat-like increase in disorder in quantum states, in the universe (such as an expansion of matter, or a randomisation in a crystal).</paragraph><paragraph>As the universe evolves in time, more and more of its energy becomes trapped in irreversible states (i.e., as heat or other kinds of increases in disorder).
