In 1538 he was elected vicar-general of his order. In 1539, urged by Bembo, he visited<space/><link><target>Venice</target></link><space/>and delivered a course of<space/><link><target>sermon</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>showing a sympathy with<space/><link><target>justification by faith</target></link>, which appeared more clearly in his<space/><italics>Dialogues</italics><space/>published the same year. He was suspected and denounced, but nothing ensued until the establishment of the<space/><link><target>Inquisition</target></link><space/>in<space/><link><target>Rome</target></link><space/>in June 1542, at the instigation of Cardinal<space/><link><target>Pope Paul IV</target><part>Giovanni Pietro Carafa</part></link>. Ochino received a citation to<space/><link><target>Rome</target></link>, and set out to obey it about the middle of August. According to his own statement, he was deterred from presenting himself at Rome by the warnings of<space/><link><target>Gasparo Contarini</target><part>Cardinal Contarini</part></link>, whom he found at<space/><link><target>Bologna</target></link>, dying of<space/><link><target>poison</target></link><space/>administered by the reactionary party.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Escape to Geneva</heading><paragraph>Ochino turned aside to<space/><link><target>Florence, Italy</target><part>Florence</part></link>, and after some hesitation went across the<space/><link><target>Alps</target></link><space/>to<space/><link><target>Geneva</target></link>. He was cordially received by<space/><link><target>John Calvin</target></link>, and published within two years several volumes of<space/><italics>Prediche</italics>, controversial tracts rationalizing his change of<space/><link><target>religion</target></link>. He also addressed replies to marchioness<space/><link><target>Vittoria Colonna</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Claudio Tolomei</target></link>, and other Italian sympathizers who were reluctant to go to the same length as himself.

This text, originally written in<space/><link><target>Latin</target></link>, is extant only in the 1549 translation of Bishop<space/><link><target>John Ponet</target></link>. The form is a series of dialogues.<space/><link><target>Lucifer</target></link>, enraged at the spread of<space/><link><target>Jesus</target></link>'s kingdom, convokes the fiends in council, and resolves to set up the<space/><link><target>pope</target></link><space/>as<space/><link><target>antichrist</target></link>.

The Italian congregation there was composed mainly of refugees from<space/><link><target>Locarno</target></link>. There for 10 years Ochino wrote books which gave increasing evidence of his alienation from the<space/><link><target>orthodoxy</target></link><space/>around him.
