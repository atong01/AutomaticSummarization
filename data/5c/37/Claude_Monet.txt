'''Oscar-Claude Monet''' ({{IPAc-en|m|oʊ|ˈ|n|eɪ}}; {{IPA-fr|klod mɔnɛ|lang}}; 14&nbsp;November 1840&nbsp;– 5&nbsp;December 1926) was a founder of French [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] painting, and the most consistent and prolific practitioner of the movement's philosophy of expressing one's perceptions before nature, especially as applied to [[En plein air|plein-air]] [[Landscape art|landscape painting]].<ref>House, John, et al.: ''Monet in the 20th century'', page 2, Yale University Press, 1998.</ref><ref Name=giverny>{{cite web|url=http://giverny.org/monet/biograph/ |title=Claude MONET biography |publisher=Giverny.org |date=2 December 2009 |accessdate=5 June 2012}}</ref> The term "Impressionism" is derived from the title of his painting ''Impression, soleil levant'' (''[[Impression, Sunrise]]''), which was exhibited in 1874 in the first of the independent exhibitions mounted by Monet and his associates as an alternative to the [[Salon de Paris]].

Monet's ambition of documenting the French countryside led him to adopt a method of painting the same scene many times in order to capture the changing of light and the passing of the seasons. From 1883 Monet lived in [[Giverny]], where he purchased a house and property, and began a vast landscaping project which included lily ponds that would become the subjects of his best-known works. In 1899 he began painting the water lilies, first in vertical views with a Japanese bridge as a central feature, and later in the series of large-scale paintings that was to occupy him continuously for the next 20 years of his life.

==Monet and Impressionism==

===First "Impressionist" exhibition===
From the late 1860s, Monet and other like-minded artists met with rejection from the conservative [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]], which held its annual exhibition at the [[Salon de Paris]]. During the latter part of 1873, Monet, [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Camille Pissarro]], and [[Alfred Sisley]] organized the [[:fr:Société anonyme des artistes peintres, sculpteurs et graveurs|Société anonyme des artistes peintres, sculpteurs et graveurs]] (Anonymous Society of Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers) to exhibit their artworks independently. At their first exhibition, held in April 1874, Monet exhibited the work that was to give the group its lasting name.

''[[Impression, Sunrise]]'' was painted in 1872, depicting a [[Le Havre]] port landscape. From the painting's title the art critic [[Louis Leroy]], in his review, "L'Exposition des Impressionnistes," which appeared in Le Charivari, coined the term "[[Impressionism]]".<ref>[http://www.artchive.com/galleries/1874/74leroy.htm From John Rewald, ''The History of Impressionism'']</ref> It was intended as disparagement but the Impressionists appropriated the term for themselves.<ref>[http://books.google.es/books?id=dhc-U0t14vMC&pg=PA150&dq=ouis+Leroy,+Impression,+soleil+levant&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Od-2UprxEKyr0gXHpoCYDQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=ouis%20Leroy%2C%20Impression%2C%20soleil%20levant&f=false ''Impressionism: A Centenary Exhibition'', the Metropolitan Museum of Art, December 12, 1974-February 10, 1975, Anne Distel, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.)]</ref><ref>[http://www.artinthepicture.com/styles/Impressionism/ Impressionism – Overview] ARTinthePICTURE.com.

==Biography==

===Birth and childhood===
Claude Monet was born on 14&nbsp;November 1840 on the fifth floor of 45 [[rue Laffitte]], in the [[9th arrondissement of Paris]].<ref name="Tucker5">P. Tucker ''Claude Monet: Life and Art'', p. 5</ref> He was the second son of Claude Adolphe Monet and Louise Justine Aubrée Monet, both of them second-generation Parisians. On 20&nbsp;May 1841, he was baptized in the local parish church, [[Notre-Dame-de-Lorette, Paris|Notre-Dame-de-Lorette]], as Oscar-Claude, but his parents called him simply Oscar.<ref name="Tucker5" /><ref>S. Patin, ''Monet "un œil&nbsp;... mais bon Dieu, quel œil !", Collection Découverte Gallimard. p. 14.</ref> (He signed his [[juvenilia]] "O.&nbsp;Monet".) Despite being baptized Catholic, Monet later became an atheist.<ref>{{cite book|title=Monet, Narcissus, and Self-Reflection: The Modernist Myth of the Self|year=1994|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226475431|page=66|author=Steven Z. Levine|edition=2|chapter=6|quote=Much closer to Monet's own atheism and pessimism is Schopenhauer, already introduced to the impressionist circle in the criticism of Theodore Duret in the 1870s and whose influence in France was at its peak in 1886, the year of ''The World as Will and Idea''.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Hidden in the Shadow of the Master: the Model-wives of Cézanne, Monet, and Rodin|year=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300149531|page=202|author=Ruth Butler|quote=Then Monet took the end of his brush and drew some long straight strokes in the wet pigment across her chest. It's not clear, and probably not consciously intended by the atheist Claude Monet, but somehow the suggestion of a Cross lies there on her body.}}</ref>

In 1845, his family moved to [[Le Havre]] in Normandy. His father wanted him to go into the family grocery business, but Monet wanted to become an artist. His mother was a singer.

On 1&nbsp;April 1851, Monet entered Le Havre secondary school of the arts. Locals knew him well for his charcoal caricatures, which he would sell for ten to twenty [[franc]]s. Monet also undertook his first drawing lessons from [[Jacques-François Ochard]], a former student of [[Jacques-Louis David]]. On the beaches of Normandy around 1856 he met fellow artist [[Eugène Boudin]], who became his mentor and taught him to use oil paints. Boudin taught Monet "[[en plein air]]" (outdoor) techniques for painting.<ref Name=guggenheim>[http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_bio_165.html Biography for Claude Monet] Guggenheim Collection. Retrieved 6 January 2007.</ref> Both received the influence of [[Johan Barthold Jongkind]].

On 28&nbsp;January 1857, his mother died. At the age of sixteen, he left school and went to live with his widowed, childless aunt, Marie-Jeanne Lecadre.

===Paris===
When Monet traveled to Paris to visit the [[Louvre]], he witnessed painters copying from the old masters. Having brought his paints and other tools with him, he would instead go and sit by a window and paint what he saw.<ref>[http://books.google.es/books?id=kLEpf5a49V0C&pg=PA431&dq=monet+louvre+instead+window+and+paint&hl=en&sa=X&ei=SQ23UpX0NcKL0AX18ICQDg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=monet%20louvre%20instead%20window%20and%20paint&f=false Gary Tinterow, ''Origins of Impressionism'', Metropolitan Museum of Art, Jan 1, 1994, ISBN 0870997173, 9780870997174]</ref> Monet was in Paris for several years and met other young painters, including [[Édouard Manet]] and others who would become friends and fellow Impressionists.

In June 1861, Monet joined the First Regiment of African Light Cavalry in [[Algeria]] for a seven-year commitment, but, two years later, after he had contracted typhoid fever, his aunt intervened to get him out of the army if he agreed to complete an art course at an art school. It is possible that the Dutch painter [[Johan Barthold Jongkind]], whom Monet knew, may have prompted his aunt on this matter. Disillusioned with the traditional art taught at art schools, in 1862 Monet became a student of [[Charles Gleyre]] in Paris, where he met [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Frédéric Bazille]] and [[Alfred Sisley]]. Together they shared new approaches to art, painting the effects of light ''[[en plein air]]'' with broken color and rapid brushstrokes, in what later came to be known as [[Impressionism]].

[[Image:Monet dejeunersurlherbe.jpg|thumb|220px|''Le déjeuner sur l'herbe, (right section)'', 1865–1866, with [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Frédéric Bazille]] and Camille Doncieux, first wife of the artist, [[Musée d'Orsay]], [[Paris, France|Paris]]<ref>[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/index-of-works/notice.html?no_cache=1&nnumid=025651&cHash=22986e3842 Musée d'Orsay, ''Le déjeuner sur l'herbe'', Notice de l'œuvre, Iconographie]</ref>]]

In January 1865 Monet was working on a version of ''Le déjeuner sur l'herbe'', aiming to present it for hanging at the Salon, which had rejected Manet's ''[[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe]]'' two years earlier.<ref name=Stuckey11>Charles F. Stuckey, p. 11–16</ref> Monet's painting was very large and could not be completed in time. (It was later cut up, with parts now in different galleries.) Monet submitted instead a painting of ''Camille'' or ''The Woman in the Green Dress'' (''La femme à la robe verte''), one of many works using his future wife, [[Camille Doncieux]], as his model. Both this painting and a small landscape were hung.<ref name=Stuckey11/> The following year Monet used Camille for his model in ''[[Women in the Garden]]'', and ''On the Bank of the Seine, Bennecourt'' in 1868. Camille became pregnant and gave birth to their first child, [[Jean Monet (son of Claude Monet)|Jean]], in 1867.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/110003101 |title=Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=20 December 2012}}</ref> Monet and Camille married on 28 June 1870, just before the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War,<ref name = "Stuckey"/> and, after their excursion to London and Zaandam, they moved to Argenteuil, in December 1871. During this time Monet painted various works of modern life. He and Camille lived in poverty for most of this period. Following the successful exhibition of some maritime paintings, and the winning of a silver medal at Le Havre, Monet's paintings were seized by creditors, from whom they were bought back by a shipping merchant, Gaudibert, who was also a patron of Boudin.<ref name= Stuckey11/>

===Franco-Prussian War and Argenteuil===
After the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (19&nbsp;July 1870), Monet and his family took refuge in England in September 1870,<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/monet/ Monet, Claude] Nicolas Pioch, www.ibiblio.org, 19 September 2002. Retrieved 6 January 2007.</ref> where he studied the works of [[John Constable]] and [[Joseph Mallord William Turner]], both of whose landscapes would serve to inspire Monet's innovations in the study of color. In the spring of 1871, Monet's works were refused authorisation for inclusion in the Royal Academy exhibition.<ref name = "Stuckey">Charles Stuckey "Monet, a Retrospective", Hugh Lauter Levin Associates, 195</ref>

In May 1871, he left London to live in [[Zaandam]], in the [[Netherlands]],<ref name = "Stuckey"/> where he made twenty-five paintings (and the police suspected him of revolutionary activities).<ref>The texts of seven police reports, written on 2 June – 9 October 1871 are included in ''Monet in Holland'', the catalog of an exhibition in the Amsterdam [[Van Gogh Museum]] (1986).</ref> He also paid a first visit to nearby [[Amsterdam]]. In October or November 1871, he returned to France. From December 1871 to 1878 he lived at [[Argenteuil]], a village on the right bank of the [[Seine]] river near Paris, and a popular Sunday-outing destination for Parisians, where he painted some of his best-known works. In 1873, Monet purchased a small boat equipped to be used as a floating studio.<ref name="Wattenmaker_98">Wattenmaker, Richard J.; Distel, Anne, et al. (1993).

===Impressionism===
[[File:Claude Monet-Madame Monet en costume japonais.jpg|thumb|150px|Madame Monet in a Japanese kimono, 1875, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]

The first Impressionist exhibition was held in 1874 at 35 boulevard des Capucines, Paris, from 15 April to 15 May. The primary purpose of the participants was not so much to promote a new style, but to free themselves from the constraints of the [[Salon de Paris]]. The exhibition, open to anyone prepared to pay 60 francs, gave artists the opportunity to show their work without the interference of a jury.<ref name="Denvir">Bernard Denvir, ''The Chronicle of Impressionism: A Timeline History of Impressionist Art'', Bulfinch Press Book, 1993</ref><ref name="Denvir b">[http://books.google.es/books?id=vehtQgAACAAJ&dq=The+Chronicle+of+Impressionism&hl=en&sa=X&ei=oSfQUqWvAYmK7AaWz4C4Bg&redir_esc=y Bernard Denvir, ''The chronicle of impressionism: an intimate diary of the lives and world of the great artists''], Thames & Hudson, Limited, 1993</ref><ref name="archives">[http://www.artchive.com/galleries/1874/74notes.htm#background archives, Notes for "The First Impressionist Exhibition, 1874"]</ref>

Renoir chaired the hanging committee and did most of the work himself, as others members failed to present themselves.<ref name="Denvir" /><ref name="Denvir b" />

In addition to ''[[Impression: Sunrise]]'' (pictured above) Monet presented four oil paintings and seven pastels. Among the paintings he displayed was ''The Luncheon'' (1868), which features Camille Doncieux and [[Jean Monet (son of Claude Monet)|Jean Monet]], and which had been rejected by the Paris Salon of 1870.<ref>[http://www.staedelmuseum.de/sm/index.php?StoryID=1047&ObjectID=249#sthash.20kjFV1h.dpuf Städelsches Kunstinstitut und Städtische Galerie, Frankfurt am Main]</ref> Also in this exhibition was a painting titled ''[[Boulevard des Capucines (Monet)|Boulevard des Capucines]]'', a painting of the boulevard done from the photographer [[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar's]] apartment at no. 35. Monet painted the subject twice, and it is uncertain which of the two pictures, that now in the [[Pushkin Museum]] in Moscow, or that in the [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], was the painting that appeared in the groundbreaking 1874 exhibition, though more recently the Moscow picture has been favoured.<ref>Kennedy, Ian.

Several works were on loan, including Cézanne's ''Modern Olympia'', Morisot's ''Hide and Seek'' (owned by Manet) and 2 landscapes by Sisley that had been purchased by Durand-Ruel.<ref name="Denvir" /><ref name="Denvir b" /><ref name="archives" />

The total attendance is estimated at 3500, and some works did sell, though some exhibitors had placed their prices too high. Pissarro was asking 1000 francs for ''The Orchard'' and Monet the same for ''Impression: Sunrise'', neither of which sold. Renoir failed to obtain the 500 francs he was asking for ''[[La loge (painting)|La Loge]]'', but later sold it for 450 francs to Père Martin, dealer and supporter of the group.<ref name="Denvir" /><ref name="Denvir b" /><ref name="archives" />

In 1876, Camille Monet became ill with [[tuberculosis]]. Their second son, [[Michel Monet|Michel]], was born on 17&nbsp;March 1878. This second child weakened her already fading health. In the summer of that year, the family moved to the village of [[Vétheuil]] where they shared a house with the family of [[Ernest Hoschedé]], a wealthy department store owner and patron of the arts. In 1878, Camille Monet was diagnosed with uterine cancer,<ref>Jiminez, Jill Berk (2013). ''Dictionary of Artists' Models''. Routledge. p. 165. ISBN 1135959145.</ref> and she died on 5 September 1879 at the age of thirty-two.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artelino.com/articles/la_japonaise.asp |title=La Japonaise |publisher=artelino |date= |accessdate=5 June 2012}}</ref><ref>http://members.aol.com/wwjohnston/camille.htm</ref>

Monet made a study in oils of his dead wife. Many years later, Monet confessed to his friend [[Georges Clemenceau]] that his need to analyse colours was both the joy and torment of his life. He explained,

<blockquote>I one day found myself looking at my beloved wife's dead face and just systematically noting the colours according to an automatic reflex!</blockquote>

John Berger describes the work as "a blizzard of white, grey, purplish paint&nbsp;... a terrible blizzard of loss which will forever efface her features. In fact there can be very few death-bed paintings which have been so intensely felt or subjectively expressive."<ref>{{cite book|last=Berger|first=John|title=The Eyes of Claude Monet from Sense of Sight|year=1985|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|isbn=0-679-73722-7|pages=194–195}}</ref>

===Vétheuil===
After several difficult months following the death of Camille, Monet began to create some of his best paintings of the 19th century. During the early 1880s, Monet painted several groups of landscapes and seascapes in what he considered to be campaigns to document the French countryside. These began to evolve into series of pictures in which he documented the same scene many times in order to capture the changing of light and the passing of the seasons.

Monet's friend [[Ernest Hoschedé]] became bankrupt, and left in 1878 for Belgium. After the death of Camille Monet in September 1879, and while Monet continued to live in the house in Vétheuil, [[Alice Hoschedé]] helped Monet to raise his two sons, Jean and Michel. She took them to Paris to live alongside her own six children,<ref name="monetalia1">{{cite web|url=http://www.monetalia.com/biography.aspx |title=Biography of Oscar-Claude Monet, The Life and Work of Claude Monet |publisher=Monetalia.com |date= |accessdate=5 June 2012}}</ref> [[Blanche Hoschedé Monet|Blanche]] (who married Jean Monet), Germaine, [[Suzanne Hoschedé|Suzanne]], Marthe, Jean-Pierre, and Jacques.

===Monet's house and garden===
At the beginning of May 1883, Monet and his large family rented a house and {{convert|2|acre|m2}} from a local landowner. The house was situated near the main road between the towns of [[Vernon, Eure|Vernon]] and Gasny at [[Giverny]]. There was a barn that doubled as a painting studio, orchards and a small garden. The house was close enough to the local schools for the children to attend and the surrounding landscape offered many suitable motifs for Monet's work. The family worked and built up the gardens and Monet's fortunes began to change for the better as his dealer [[Paul Durand-Ruel]] had increasing success in selling his paintings.<ref>[http://books.google.es/books?id=ZXtbMrsjsOEC&pg=PA115&dq=Monet,+Paul+Durand-Ruel&hl=en&sa=X&ei=6Q63UsbdEKHL0QX_noDwAQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Monet%2C%20Paul%20Durand-Ruel&f=false Mary Mathews Gedo, ''Monet and His Muse: Camille Monet in the Artist's Life'', University of Chicago Press, Sep 30, 2010, ISBN 0226284808, 9780226284804]</ref> By November 1890, Monet was prosperous enough to buy the house, the surrounding buildings and the land for his gardens. During the 1890s, Monet built a greenhouse and a second studio, a spacious building well lit with skylights.

Monet wrote daily instructions to his gardener, precise designs and layouts for plantings, and invoices for his floral purchases and his collection of botany books. As Monet's wealth grew, his garden evolved. He remained its architect, even after he hired seven gardeners.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/travel/getaways/europe/articles/2007/05/20/monets_gardens_a_draw_to_giverny_and_to_his_art/|title=Monet's gardens a draw to Giverny and to his art|publisher=Globe Correspondents|date=20 May 2007|accessdate=13 October 2008 | first=Robert | last=Garrett}}</ref>

Monet purchased additional land with a water meadow. In 1893 he began a vast landscaping project which included lily ponds that would become the subjects of his best-known works. White water lilies local to France were planted along with imported cultivars from South America and Egypt, resulting in a range of colours including yellow, blue and white lilies that turned pink with age.<ref name= AGV>Art Gallery of Victoria, [http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/whats-on/exhibitions/exhibitions/monets-garden/explore/themes/waterlilies-symbol-of-the-orient-and-modern-science Monet's Garden], (retrieved 16 December 2013)</ref> In 1899 he began painting the water lilies, first in vertical views with a Japanese bridge as a central feature, and later in the series of large-scale paintings that was to occupy him continuously for the next 20 years of his life. This scenery, with its alternating light and mirror-like reflections, became an integral part of his work. By the mid-1910s Monet had achieved:

==Last years==
[[File:Monet in Garden, New York Times, 1922.JPG|thumb|Monet, right, in his garden at [[Giverny]], 1922]]

===Failing sight===
Monet's second wife, Alice, died in 1911, and his oldest son Jean, who had married Alice's daughter Blanche, Monet's particular favourite, died in 1914.<ref name="guggenheim"/> After Alice died, Blanche looked after and cared for Monet. It was during this time that Monet began to develop the first signs of [[cataract]]s.<ref>Forge, Andrew, and Gordon, Robert, ''Monet'', page 224. Harry N. Abrams, 1989.</ref>

During [[World War I]], in which his younger son Michel served and his friend and admirer [[Georges Clemenceau|Clemenceau]] led the French nation, Monet painted a series of [[Salix babylonica|weeping willow]] trees as homage to the French fallen soldiers. In 1923, he underwent two operations to remove his cataracts. The paintings done while the cataracts affected his vision have a general reddish tone, which is characteristic of the vision of cataract victims. It may also be that after surgery he was able to see certain [[ultraviolet]] wavelengths of light that are normally excluded by the lens of the eye; this may have had an effect on the colors he perceived. After his operations he even repainted some of these paintings, with bluer water lilies than before.<ref>[http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/medicalscience/story/0,9837,724257,00.html Let the light shine in] Guardian News, 30 May 2002. Retrieved 6 January 2007.</ref>

===Death===
Monet died of lung cancer on 5 December 1926 at the age of 86 and is buried in the [[Giverny]] church cemetery.<ref name="giverny1"/> Monet had insisted that the occasion be simple; thus only about fifty people attended the ceremony.<ref>P. Tucker ''Claude Monet: Life and Art'', p.224</ref>

His home, garden, and waterlily pond were bequeathed by his son Michel, his only heir, to the French Academy of Fine Arts (part of the [[Institut de France]]) in 1966. Through the ''Fondation Claude Monet'', the house and gardens were opened for visits in 1980, following restoration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fondation-monet.fr/uk/?q=content/historical-record |title=Historical record |publisher=Fondation-monet.fr |accessdate=19 January 2010}}</ref> In addition to souvenirs of Monet and other objects of his life, the house contains his collection of [[Ukiyo-e|Japanese woodcut prints]]. The house and garden, along with the ''Museum of Impressionism Giverny'', are major attractions in [[Giverny]], which hosts tourists from all over the world.

==Monet's methods==
[[File:Claude Monet - Rouen Cathedral, Facade (Sunset).JPG|thumb|''Rouen Cathedral at sunset'', 1893, Musée Marmottan Monet. An example of the [[Rouen Cathedral (Monet)|Rouen Cathedral Series.]]]]

Monet has been described as "the driving force behind Impressionism".<ref name="GJ">{{Cite book|title = Impressionist Painters|last = Jennings|first = Guy|publisher = Octopus Books|year = 1986|isbn = 9780706426601|location = |pages = }}</ref> Crucial to the art of the Impressionist painters was the understanding of the effects of light on the local colour of objects, and the effects of the juxtaposition of colours with each other.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title = Art through the Ages|last = Gardner|first = Helen|publisher = Harcourt College Pub|year = 1995|isbn = 978-0155011410|location = |pages = 669|edition = 10th Reiss}}</ref> Monet's long career as a painter was spent in the pursuit of this aim.

In 1856, his chance meeting with [[Eugene Boudin]], a painter of small beach scenes, opened his eyes to the possibility of plein-air painting. From that time, with a short interruption for military service, he dedicated himself to searching for new and improved methods of painterly expression. To this end, as a young man, he visited the Paris Salon and familiarised himself with the works of older painters, and made friends with other young artists.<ref name=GJ/> The five years that he spent at [[Argenteuil]], spending much time on the River Seine in a little floating studio, were formative in his study of the effects of light and reflections. He began to think in terms of colours and shapes rather than scenes and objects. He used bright colours in dabs and dashes and squiggles of paint. Having rejected the academic teachings of Gleyre's studio, he freed himself from theory, saying "I like to paint as a bird sings."<ref>Jennings, p. 130</ref>

In 1877 a series of paintings at St-Lazare Station had Monet looking at smoke and steam and the way that they affected colour and visibility, being sometimes opaque and sometimes translucent. He was to further use this study in the painting of the effects of mist and rain on the landscape.<ref>Jennings, p. 132</ref> The study of the effects of atmosphere were to evolve into a number of series of paintings in which Monet repeatedly painted the same subject in different lights, at different hours of the day, and through the changes of weather and season. This process began in the 1880s and continued until the end of his life in 1926.

His first series exhibited as such was of [[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks]], painted from different points of view and at different times of the day. Fifteen of the paintings were exhibited at the [[Paul Durand-Ruel|Galerie Durand-Ruel]] in 1891. In 1892 he produced what is probably his best-known series, twenty-six views of ''[[Rouen Cathedral (Monet)|Rouen Cathedral]]''.<ref name=":0" /> In these paintings Monet broke with painterly traditions by cropping the subject so that only a portion of the facade is seen on the canvas. The paintings do not focus on the grand Medieval building, but on the play of light and shade across its surface, transforming the solid masonry.<ref>Jennings p. 137</ref>

Other series include ''[[Poplar Series (Monet)|Poplars]]'', ''Mornings on the Seine'', and the ''[[Water Lilies]]'' that were painted on his property at Giverny. Between 1883 and 1908, Monet traveled to the [[Mediterranean]], where he painted landmarks, landscapes, and seascapes, including a series of paintings in [[Venice, Italy|Venice]]. In London he painted four series: ''the [[London Parliament (Monet)|Houses of Parliament, London]]'', ''[[Charing Cross Bridge series (Monet)|Charing Cross Bridge]]'', ''Waterloo Bridge'', and ''Views of Westminster Bridge''.
