Historically, it was mostly used as a practice instrument and as an aid to composition, not being loud enough for larger performances (a problem that was solved when the<space/><link><target>Clavinet</target></link><space/>was invented in the mid-20th century). The clavichord produces sound by striking brass or iron strings with small metal blades called tangents. Vibrations are transmitted through the bridge(s) to the soundboard. The name is derived from the<space/><link><target>Latin</target></link><space/>word<space/><italics>clavis</italics>, meaning &quot;key&quot; (associated with more common<space/><italics>clavus</italics>, meaning &quot;nail, rod, etc.&quot;) and<space/><italics>chorda</italics><space/>(from Greek ) meaning &quot;string, especially of a musical instrument&quot;.</paragraph><heading level='2'>History and use</heading><paragraph>The clavichord was invented in the early fourteenth century.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>harvnb</target><arg>Brauchli</arg><arg>1998</arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Harvnb</target><arg>Jeans</arg><arg>1951</arg></template></extension><space/>In 1504, the German poem &quot;<template><target>Lang</target><arg>de</arg><arg>Der Minne Regeln</arg></template>&quot; mentions the terms clavicimbalum (a term used mainly for the<space/><link><target>harpsichord</target></link>) and clavichordium, designating them as the best instruments to accompany melodies.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Clavicorde Lpante.JPG</target><part>thumb</part><part>The &quot;Lpante&quot; fretted clavichord,<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://mediatheque.cite-musique.fr/masc/?INSTANCE=CITEMUSIQUE&amp;amp;URL=/ClientBookLineCIMU/recherche/NoticeDetailleByID.asp'>Catalogue entry</link><space/>for the Lpante clavichord,<space/><link><target>Cit de la Musique</target></link>, Paris (in French)</extension><space/>Muse de la Musique, Paris</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>One of the earliest references to the clavichord in England occurs in the privy-purse expenses of Elizabeth of York, queen of Henry VII, in an entry dated August 1502:<extension extension_name='blockquote'>Item.

Towards the right end they pass over a curved wooden bridge. The action is simple, with the keys being levers with a small brass tangent, a small piece of metal similar in shape and size to the head of a flat-bladed screwdriver, at the far end. The strings, which are usually of brass, or else a combination of brass and iron, are usually arranged in pairs, like a lute or mandolin. When the key is pressed, the tangent strikes the strings above, causing them to sound in a similar fashion to the<space/><italics>hammering</italics><space/>technique on a guitar. Unlike in a piano action, the tangent does not rebound from the string; rather, it stays in contact with the string as long as the key is held, acting as both the<space/><link><target>Nut (string instrument)</target><part>nut</part></link><space/>and as the initiator of sound. The volume of the note can be changed by striking harder or softer, and the pitch can also be affected by varying the force of the tangent against the string (known as<space/><italics><link><target>Bebung</target></link></italics>). When the key is released, the tangent loses contact with the string and the vibration of the string is silenced by strips of damping cloth.</paragraph><paragraph>The action of the clavichord is unique among all keyboard instruments in that one part of the action simultaneously initiates the sound vibration while at the same time defining the endpoint of the vibrating string, and thus its pitch. Because of this intimate contact between the player's hand and the production of sound, the clavichord has been referred to as the most intimate of keyboard instruments. Despite its many (serious) limitations, including extremely low volume, it has considerable expressive power, the player being able to control attack, duration, volume, and even provide certain subtle effects of swelling of tone and a type of vibrato unique to the clavichord.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Fretting</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Clavichord-JA Haas 007 reworked.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Large five-octave unfretted clavichord by Paul Maurici, after<space/><link><target>Johann Adolph Hass</target><part>J.A. Hass</part></link></part></link>Since the string vibrates from the bridge only as far as the tangent, multiple keys with multiple tangents can be assigned to the same string. This is called<space/><italics>fretting</italics>. Early clavichords frequently had many notes played on each string, even going so far as the keyed<space/><link><target>monochord</target></link><space/>&amp;mdash; an instrument with only one stringthough most clavichords were triple- or double-fretted. Since only one note can be played at a time on each string, the fretting pattern is generally chosen so that notes rarely heard together (such as C and C<template><target>music</target><arg>#</arg></template>) share a string pair. The advantages of this system compared with unfretted instruments (see below) include relative ease of<space/><link><target>Musical tuning</target><part>tuning</part></link><space/>(with around half as many strings to keep in tune), greater volume (though still not really enough for use in<space/><link><target>chamber music</target></link>), and a clearer, more direct sound. Among the disadvantages:<space/><link><target>Musical temperament</target><part>temperament</part></link><space/>could not be re-set without bending the tangents; and playing required a further refinement of touch, since notes sharing a single string played in quick succession had to be slightly separated to avoid a disagreeable deadening of the sound, potentially disturbing a<space/><link><target>legato</target></link><space/>line.<link><target>File:Clavicord.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>Fretted clavichord, copy of an unsigned instrument conserved in<space/><link><target>Namur, Belgium</target></link>. The way the same string pair is used for several notes is clearly visible in the full size image.</part></link>Some clavichords have been built with a single pair of strings for each note. The first known reference to one was by<space/><link><target>Johann Speth</target></link><space/>in 1693 and the earliest such extant signed and dated clavichord was built in 1716 by Johann Michael Heinitz. Such instruments are referred to as<space/><italics>unfretted</italics><space/>whereas instruments using the same strings for several notes are called<space/><italics>fretted</italics>. Among the advantages to unfretted instruments are flexibility in tuning (the temperament can be easily altered) and the ability to play any music exactly as written without concern for &quot;bad&quot; notes. Disadvantages include a smaller volume, even though many or most unfretted instruments tend to be significantly larger than fretted instruments; and<space/><italics>many</italics><space/>more strings to keep in tune. Unfretted instruments tend to have a sweeter, less incisive tone due to the greater load on the bridge resulting from the greater number of strings, though the large, late (early 19th century) Swedish clavichords tend to be the loudest of any of the historic clavichords.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Pedal clavichord</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Pedal-clavichord.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>J.

With the addition of a<space/><link><target>pedal clavichord</target></link>, which included a<space/><link><target>pedal keyboard</target></link><space/>for the lower notes, a clavichord could be used to practice improvising and, only when printed music became easily available, to learn organ repertoire. Most often, the addition of a pedal keyboard only involved connecting the keys of the pedalboard to the lower notes on the manual clavichord using string so the lower notes on the manual instrument could be operated by the feet.
