Because of the switch to Portland cement, by the end of the 1920s of the 15 Rosendale cement companies, only one had survived. But in the early 1930s it was discovered that, while Portland cement had a faster setting time it was not as durable, especially for highways, to the point that some states stopped building highways and roads with cement. Bertrain H. Wait, an engineer whose company had worked on the construction of the New York City's<space/><link><target>Catskill Aqueduct</target></link>, was impressed with the durability of Rosendale cement, and came up with a blend of both Rosendale and synthetic cements which had the good attributes of both: it was highly durable and had a much faster setting time.

Most cement kilns today use coal and petroleum coke as primary fuels, and to a lesser extent natural gas and fuel oil. Selected waste and by-products with recoverable calorific value can be used as fuels in a cement kiln (referred to as<space/><link><target>co-processing</target></link>), replacing a portion of conventional fossil fuels, like coal, if they meet strict specifications. Selected waste and by-products containing useful minerals such as calcium, silica, alumina, and iron can be used as raw materials in the kiln, replacing raw materials such as clay,<space/><link><target>shale</target></link>, and limestone. Because some materials have both useful mineral content and recoverable calorific value, the distinction between alternative fuels and raw materials is not always clear. For example, sewage sludge has a low but significant calorific value, and burns to give ash containing minerals useful in the clinker matrix.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.wbcsd.org/DocRoot/Vjft3qGjo1v6HREH7jM6/tf2-guidelines.pdf'>Guidelines for the Selection and Use of Fuels and Raw Materials in the Cement Manufacturing Process</link>,<space/><italics><link><target>World Business Council for Sustainable Development</target></link></italics><space/>(1 June 2005).</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Normal operation of cement kilns provides combustion conditions which are more than adequate for the destruction of even the most difficult to destroy organic substances. This is primarily due to the very high temperatures of the kiln gases (2000&amp;nbsp;C in the combustion gas from the main burners and 1100&amp;nbsp;C in the gas from the burners in the precalciner). The gas residence time at high temperature in the rotary kiln is of the order of 510 seconds and in the precalciner more than 3 seconds.<extension extension_name='ref' name="groundwork.org.za"><link type='external' href='http://www.groundwork.org.za/Cement/Alternative_Fuels_in_Cement_Manufacture_CEMBUREAU_Brochure_EN.pdf'>Alternative Fuels in Cement Manufacture CEMBUREAU Brochure, 1997</link></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Due to<space/><link><target>bovine spongiform encephalopathy</target></link><space/>(BSE) in the European beef industry, the use of animal-derived products to feed cattle is now severely restricted.
