'''BIND''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|aɪ|n|d}}, or '''named''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|eɪ|m|d|iː}}, is the most widely used [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) software on the Internet.<ref>{{cite web

On [[Unix-like]] operating systems it is the [[De facto standard|''de facto'' standard]].

The software was originally designed at the University of California Berkeley (UCB) in the early 1980s. The name originates as an acronym of ''Berkeley Internet Name Domain'',<ref name="Terry">{{cite web

| accessdate=2015-09-17}}</ref> reflecting the application's use within UCB. The software consists, most prominently, of the DNS server component, called ''named'', a contracted form of ''name [[Daemon (computing)|daemon]]''. In addition the suite contains various administration tools, and a DNS resolver interface library. The latest version of BIND is BIND 9, first released in 2000. 

Starting in 2009, the  [[Internet Software Consortium]] (ISC) developed a new software suite, initially called BIND10. With release version 1.2.0 the project was renamed ''Bundy'' to terminate ISC involvement in the project.

==Database support==
While earlier versions of BIND offered no mechanism to store and retrieve [[Zone file|zone data in anything other than flat text files]], in 2007 BIND 9.4<ref>{{cite web

BIND 10 planned to make the data store modular, so that a variety of databases may be connected.<ref name="bind10-design">{{cite web

==Security==
The BIND 4 and BIND 8 releases both had serious security vulnerabilities. Their use is strongly discouraged.<ref>P. Hudson, A. Hudson, B. Ball, H. Duff: Red Hat Fedora 4 Unleashed, page 723. Sams Publishing, 2005 ISBN 0-672-32792-9</ref> BIND 9 was a [[Rewrite (programming)|complete rewrite]], in part to mitigate these ongoing security issues.

BIND9.x has an error in the handling of TKEY queries that can be exploited by an attacker for use as a denial-of-service vector, as a constructed packet can use the defect to trigger a REQUIRE assertion failure, causing BIND to exit.<ref>{{cite web

==History==
Originally written by four [[graduate student]]s at the [[Computer Systems Research Group]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (UCB), BIND was first released with [[Berkeley Software Distribution]] 4.3BSD. [[Paul Vixie]] started maintaining it in 1988 while working for [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]. {{As of | 2012}}, the [[Internet Systems Consortium]] maintains, updates, and writes new versions of BIND. 

BIND was written by Douglas Terry, Mark Painter, David Riggle and Songnian Zhou in the early 1980s at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] as a result of a [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|DARPA]] grant. The acronym ''BIND'' is for ''Berkeley Internet Name Domain'', from a technical paper published in 1984.<ref name="Terry"/>

Versions of BIND through 4.8.3 were maintained by the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) at UC Berkeley.<ref name="history">{{cite web

| title=History of BIND
| author=ISC
| date=2015-01-20
| accessdate=2015-09-17}}</ref>

In the mid-1980s, Paul Vixie of [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] took over BIND development, releasing versions 4.9 and 4.9.1.  [[Paul Vixie]] continued to work on BIND after leaving DEC.  BIND Version 4.9.2 was sponsored by Vixie Enterprises.  Vixie eventually founded the [[Internet Software Consortium|ISC]], which became the entity responsible for BIND versions starting with 4.9.3.<ref name="history" />

BIND 8 was released by ISC in May 1997.<ref name="history" />

Version 9 was developed by [[Nominum]], Inc. under an ISC outsourcing contract, and the first version was released October 9, 2000.<ref>{{cite web
| url=https://www.usenix.org/legacy/about/newsroom/press/archive/bind9.html
| title=BIND 9 Authored by Nominum Development Team Now Available on Internet Software Consortium Site
| date=2000-10-06
| accessdate=2015-09-17}}</ref> It was written from scratch in part to address the architectural difficulties with [[Code audit|auditing]] the earlier BIND code bases, and also to support [[DNSSEC]] (DNS Security Extensions). Other important features of BIND 9 include: [[TSIG]], [[nsupdate]], [[IPv6]], rndc (remote name daemon control), views, multiprocessor support, and an improved portability architecture.  rndc uses a [[shared secret]] to provide encryption for local and remote terminals during each session. The development of BIND 9 took place under a combination of commercial and military contracts. Most of the features of BIND 9 were funded by UNIX vendors who wanted to ensure that BIND stayed competitive with Microsoft's DNS offerings;{{cn|date=May 2014}} the [[DNSSEC]] features were funded by the US military, which regarded DNS security as important.  BIND 9 was released in September 2000.<ref name="history" />

In 2009, ISC started an effort to develop a new version of the software suite, called BIND10. In addition to DNS service, the BIND10 suite also included [[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]] DHCP server components.  In April 2014, with the BIND10 release 1.2.0 the ISC concluded its development work of the project and renamed the project ''Bundy'', moving the source code repository to [[GitHub]] for further development by outside public efforts.<ref>{{cite web
