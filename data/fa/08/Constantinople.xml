Yet it had been the capital of the state for over a thousand years, and it might have seemed unthinkable to suggest that the capital be moved to a different location.

It also lacked the panoply of other administrative offices regulating the food supply, police, statues, temples, sewers, aqueducts, or other public works. The new programme of building was carried out in great haste: columns, marbles, doors, and tiles were taken wholesale from the temples of the empire and moved to the new city. In similar fashion, many of the greatest works of Greek and Roman art were soon to be seen in its squares and streets.

The population was rising (estimates for Constantinople in the 12th century vary from some 100,000 to 500,000), and towns and cities across the realm flourished. Meanwhile, the volume of money in circulation dramatically increased. This was reflected in Constantinople by the construction of the Blachernae palace, the creation of brilliant new works of art, and general prosperity at this time: an increase in trade, made possible by the growth of the Italian city-states, may have helped the growth of the economy. It is certain that the<space/><link><target>Venice</target><part>Venetians</part></link><space/>and others were active traders in Constantinople, making a living out of shipping goods between the Crusader Kingdoms of<space/><link><target>Outremer</target></link><space/>and the West, while also trading extensively with Byzantium and<space/><link><target>Egypt</target></link>. The Venetians had factories on the north side of the Golden Horn, and large numbers of westerners were present in the city throughout the 12th century.

There was an increased demand for art, with more people having access to the necessary wealth to commission and pay for such work. According to N.H.

In January 1204, the<space/><italics><link><target>protovestiarius</target></link></italics><space/>Alexius Murzuphlus provoked a riot, it is presumed, to intimidate Alexius IV, but whose only result was the destruction of the great statue of Athena, the work of<space/><link><target>Phidias</target></link>, which stood in the principal forum facing west.</paragraph><paragraph>In February, the people rose again: Alexius IV was imprisoned and executed, and Murzuphlus took the purple as<space/><link><target>Alexius V</target></link>. He made some attempt to repair the walls and organise the citizenry, but there had been no opportunity to bring in troops from the provinces and the guards were demoralised by the revolution. An attack by the Crusaders on 6 April failed, but a second from the Golden Horn on 12 April succeeded, and the invaders poured in. Alexius V fled. The Senate met in Hagia Sophia and offered the crown to Theodore Lascaris, who had married into the Angelid family, but it was too late. He came out with the Patriarch to the<space/><link><target>Milion</target><part>Golden Milestone</part></link><space/>before the Great Palace and addressed the Varangian Guard.

It was filled with works of art that had survived from ancient Greece and with the masterpieces of its own exquisite craftsmen. The Venetians ... seized treasures and carried them off to adorn ... their town. But the Frenchmen and Flemings were filled with a lust for destruction. They rushed in a howling mob down the streets and through the houses, snatching up everything that glittered and destroying whatever they could not carry, pausing only to murder or to rape, or to break open the wine-cellars ... . Neither monasteries nor churches nor libraries were spared. In Hagia Sophia itself, drunken soldiers could be seen tearing down the silken hangings and pulling the great silver [[iconostasis]] to pieces, while sacred books and icons were trampled under foot. While they drank merrily from the altar-vessels a prostitute set herself on the Patriarch’s throne and began to sing a ribald French song. Nuns were ravished in their convents. Palaces and hovels alike were entered and wrecked. Wounded women and children lay dying in the streets. For three days the ghastly scenes ... continued, till the huge and beautiful city was a shambles. ... When ... order was restored, ... citizens were tortured to make them reveal the goods that they had contrived to hide.<ref>Steven Runciman, ''A History of the Crusades'', Cambridge 1966 [1954], vol 3, p.123.</ref></arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>For the next half-century, Constantinople was the seat of the<space/><link><target>Latin Empire</target></link>. Under the rulers of the Latin Empire, the city declined, both in population and the condition of its buildings. Alice-Mary Talbot cites an estimated population for Constantinople of 400,000 inhabitants; after the destruction wrought by the Crusaders on the city, about one third were homeless, and numerous courtiers, nobility, and higher clergy, followed various leading personages into exile. &quot;As a result Constantinople became seriously depopulated,&quot; Talbot concludes.<extension extension_name='ref'>Talbot,<space/><link type='external' href='http://www.jstor.org/stable/1291680'>&quot;The Restoration of Constantinople under Michael VIII&quot;</link>,<space/><italics>Dumbarton Oaks Papers</italics>,<space/><bold>47</bold><space/>(1993), p. 246</extension></paragraph><paragraph>The Latins took over at least 20 churches and 13 monasteries, most prominently the Hagia Sophia, which became the cathedral of the Latin Patriarch of Constantinople.

The Ottomans were commanded by 22-year-old Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II. The conquest of Constantinople followed a seven-week siege that had begun on Friday, 6 April 1453. After the initial assault, the Ottoman Army fanned out along the main thoroughfare of the city, the Mese, past the great forums, and past the Church of the Holy Apostles, which Mehmed II wanted to provide a seat for his newly appointed patriarch which would help him better control his Christian subjects. Mehmed II had sent an advance guard to protect key buildings such as the Church of the Holy Apostles.</paragraph><paragraph>When the Venetians retreated over to their ships, the Ottomans had already taken the walls of the Golden Horn. Luckily for them, the Ottomans were not interested in killing them but more in the loot they could get from raiding the city's houses, so they decided to attack the city and not them. The Venetian captain ordered his men to break open the gate of the Golden Horn; after they did, they left with ships filled with Venetian soldiers and refugees. Shortly after they left a few Genoese ships and even the Emperor's ships followed them out of the Golden Horn. This was done in perfect timing because shortly after they had left, the Ottoman navy had control over the Golden Horn by midday.<extension extension_name='ref' name="coursesa.matrix.msu.edu">http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~fisher/hst373/readings/nicol.html</extension>The Army converged upon the<space/><link><target>Augusteum</target></link>, the vast square that fronted the great church of<space/><link><target>Hagia Sophia</target></link><space/>whose bronze gates were barred by a huge throng of civilians inside the building, hoping for divine protection.

It would remain the capital of the eastern, Greek-speaking empire for over a thousand years. At its peak, roughly corresponding to the Middle Ages, it was the richest and largest European city, exerting a powerful cultural pull and dominating economic life in the Mediterranean. Visitors and merchants were especially struck by the beautiful monasteries and churches of the city, in particular,<space/><link><target>Hagia Sophia</target></link>, or the Church of Holy Wisdom: A Russian 14th-century traveler, Stephen of Novgorod, wrote, &quot;As for Hagia Sophia, the human mind can neither tell it nor make description of it.&quot;</paragraph><paragraph>It was especially important for preserving in its libraries manuscripts of Greek and Latin authors throughout a period when instability and disorder caused their mass-destruction in western Europe and north Africa: On the city's fall, thousands of these were brought by refugees to Italy, and played a key part in stimulating the Renaissance, and the transition to the modern world.
