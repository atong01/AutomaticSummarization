Although his designs were rational, they were not based on particularly good science.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Wragg</arg><arg>1974</arg><arg name="p">11</arg></template><space/>Many of his designs, such as a four-person screw-type helicopter, have severe flaws.

Around 1650<space/><link><target>Cyrano de Bergerac</target></link><space/>wrote some fantasy novels in which he described the principle of ascent using a substance (dew) he supposed to be lighter than air, and descending by releasing a controlled amount of the substance.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Ege</arg><arg>1973</arg><arg name="p">6</arg></template><space/><link><target>Francesco Lana de Terzi</target></link><space/>measured the pressure of air at sea level and in 1670 proposed the first scientifically credible lifting medium in the form of hollow metal spheres from which all the air had been pumped out. These would be lighter than the displaced air and able to lift an<space/><link><target>airship</target></link>. His proposed methods of controlling height are still in use today; by carrying ballast which may be dropped overboard to gain height, and by venting the lifting containers to lose height.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Ege</arg><arg>1973</arg><arg name="p">7</arg></template><space/>In practice de Terzi's spheres would have collapsed under air pressure, and further developments had to wait for more practicable lifting gases.</paragraph><paragraph>From the mid-18th century the<space/><link><target>Montgolfier brothers</target></link><space/>in France began experimenting with balloons. Their balloons were made of paper, and early experiments using steam as the lifting gas were short-lived due to its effect on the paper as it condensed. Mistaking smoke for a kind of steam, they began filling their balloons with hot smoky air which they called &quot;electric smoke&quot; and, despite not fully understanding the principles at work, made some successful launches and in 1783 were invited to give a demonstration to the French Academie des Sciences.</paragraph><paragraph>Meanwhile, the discovery of<space/><link><target>hydrogen</target></link><space/>led<space/><link><target>Joseph Black</target></link><space/>in c. 1780 to propose its use as a lifting gas, though practical demonstration awaited a gastight balloon material. On hearing of the Montgolfier Brothers' invitation, the French Academy member<space/><link><target>Jacques Charles</target></link><space/>offered a similar demonstration of a hydrogen balloon. Charles and two craftsmen, the Robert brothers, developed a gastight material of rubberised silk for the envelope. The hydrogen gas was to be generated by chemical reaction during the filling process.</paragraph><paragraph>The Montgolfier designs had several shortcomings, not least the need for dry weather and a tendency for sparks from the fire to set light to the paper balloon. The manned design had a gallery around the base of the balloon rather than the hanging basket of the first, unmanned design, which brought the paper closer to the fire. On their free flight, De Rozier and d'Arlandes took buckets of water and sponges to douse these fires as they arose. On the other hand, the manned design of Charles was essentially modern.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Ege</arg><arg>1973</arg><arg name="pp">97â€“100</arg></template><space/>As a result of these exploits, the hot-air ballon became known as the<space/><italics>Montgolfire</italics><space/>type and the hydrogen balloon the<space/><italics>Charlire</italics>.</paragraph><paragraph>Charles and the Robert brothers' next balloon,<space/><italics><link><target>Robert brothers#Further ballooning activities La Caroline</target><part>La Caroline</part></link></italics>, was a Charlire that followed<space/><link><target>Jean Baptiste Meusnier</target></link>'s proposals for an elongated dirigible balloon, and was notable for having an outer envelope with the gas contained in a second, inner ballonet. On 19 September 1784, it completed the first flight of over 100&amp;nbsp;km, between Paris and<space/><link><target>Beuvry</target></link>, despite the man-powered propulsive devices proving useless.</paragraph><paragraph>In an attempt the next year to provide both endurance and controllability, de Rozier developed a balloon having both hot air and hydrogen gas bags, a design which was soon named after him as the<space/><italics>Rozire.</italics><space/>The principle was to use the hydrogen section for constant lift and to navigate vertically by heating and allowing to cool the hot air section, in order to catch the most favourable wind at whatever altitude it was blowing.
