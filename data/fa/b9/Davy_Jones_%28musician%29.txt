His acting credits include a [[Tony Award|Tony]]-nominated role as the Artful Dodger in the [[Oliver!#Productions|original London and Broadway productions of ''Oliver!'']] as well as a starring cameo role in a [[List of The Brady Bunch episodes#Season 3 (1971/72)|hallmark episode]] of ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'' television show and later [[The Brady Bunch Movie|reprised parody film]]; ''[[Love, American Style]]''; and ''[[My Two Dads]]''. Three years before his death, Jones briefly appeared in an episode of the children's program ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' as himself, it was titled ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants vs. The Big One]]''. Jones is considered one of the great [[teen idol]]s.<ref name="oconnor">{{cite web|last=O'Connor |first=Rob |url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/listoftheday/104315/the-top-25-teen-idols-of-all-time/ |title=Yahoo Music: The Top 25 Teen Idols Of All-Time |publisher=New.music.yahoo.com |date=1 December 2008 |accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref><ref name="kaufman">{{cite web|last=Kaufman |first=Gil |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1680227/monkees-davy-jones-teen-heartthrob-justin-bieber.jhtml |title=Monkee Davy Jones Paved Way For Heartthrobs Like Justin Bieber |work=Mtv |accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref>

==Early life==
David Thomas Jones was born at 20 Leamington Street, [[Openshaw]], [[Manchester]], [[Lancashire]], England, on 30 December 1945. His television acting debut was on the British television soap opera ''[[Coronation Street]]''. He portrayed Colin Lomax, [[Ena Sharples]]' grandson, for one episode on 6 March 1961.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.itv.com/coronationstreet/news/davyjonesoncorrie/ | title=Davy Jones in Corrie | date=1 March 2012 | publisher=ITV | accessdate=16 February 2013 }}</ref><ref name="biography1">{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/articles/Davy-Jones-377858 |title=Davy Jones Biography&nbsp;– Facts, Birthday, Life Story |publisher=Biography.com |date=30 December 1945 |accessdate=31 December 2011}}</ref> He also appeared in the BBC police series ''[[Z-Cars]]''. After the death of his mother from [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|emphysema]] when he was 14 years old, Jones rejected acting in favour of a career as a jockey, apprenticing with [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]] trainer Basil Foster.<ref name="biography1"/> He dropped out of secondary school to begin his career in that field.<ref>

Even though Foster believed Jones would be successful as a jockey, he encouraged his young protégé to take a role as the [[Artful Dodger]] a production of ''[[Oliver!]]'' in [[West End of London|London's West End]], a move which changed Jones' life forever. In turn, Jones cared for Foster in his later years, bringing him to the United States and providing him financial support.<ref>{{cite web|last=Milham |first=Simon |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/racing/article-2102648/The-Monkees-frontman-Davy-Jones-repaying-Newmarket-trainer-setting-road-stardom.html |title=The Monkees frontman Davy Jones repaying Newmarket trainer for setting him on road to stardom &#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2012-02-17 |accessdate=2014-05-24}}</ref>

==Early acting and recording career==
[[File:David Jones 1965.JPG|thumb|left|170px|Jones in a 1965 ad for his Colpix single "What Are We Going to Do?"]]
Foster was approached by a friend who worked in a theatre in the [[West End of London]] during casting for the musical ''[[Oliver!]]''. Foster replied, "I've got the kid." Jones was cast and appeared to great acclaim as the [[Artful Dodger]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/music-obituaries/9114540/Davy-Jones.html |title=Davy Jones |publisher=Telegraph |date=29 February 2012 |accessdate=4 March 2012 |location=London}}</ref> He played the role in London and then on Broadway and was nominated for a [[Tony Award]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://davyjones.net/djbio.html |title=Davy Jones Bio |publisher=davyjones.net}}</ref> On 9 February 1964, he appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' with [[Georgia Brown (English singer)|Georgia Brown]] who was playing Nancy in the Broadway production of ''[[Oliver!]]''. This was the same episode of the show in which [[the Beatles]] made their first appearance. Jones said of that night, "I watched the Beatles from the side of the stage, I saw the girls going crazy, and I said to myself, this is it, I want a piece of that."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/arts/music/davy-jones-a-singer-in-the-monkees-dies-at-66.html?_r=1&hp|title=Davy Jones, Monkees Singer, Dies at 66|last=Fox |first= Margalit|date=29 February 2012|work=New York Times|accessdate=1 March 2012}}</ref>

Following his ''Ed Sullivan'' appearance, Jones signed a contract with [[Ward Sylvester]] of [[Screen Gems]] (then the television division of [[Columbia Pictures]]). A pair of American television appearances followed, as Jones received screen time in episodes of ''[[Ben Casey]]'' and ''[[The Farmer's Daughter (TV series)|The Farmer's Daughter]]''.<ref>{{citation|title=Davy Jones|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0427888/}}</ref>

Jones debuted on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] in the week of 14 August 1965, with the single "What Are We Going To Do?" The 19-year-old singer was signed to [[Colpix Records]], a label owned by Columbia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/genre/rock-and-pop/davy-jones-and-the-monkees-billboard-chart-1006322552.story |title=Davy Jones and the Monkees' Billboard Chart Legacy &#124; Billboard |publisher=Billboard.biz |date= |accessdate=2014-05-24}}</ref> His debut album ''David Jones'', on the same label, followed soon after (CP493).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Davy-Jones-David-Jones/release/2912492 |title=David Jones* - David Jones (Vinyl, Album, Album) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-24}}</ref> In 1967 the album was issued in the UK, in mono only, on the [[Pye Records]] label (NPL 18178).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/David-Jones-David-Jones/release/3032165 |title=Davy Jones - Davy Jones (Vinyl, LP, Album) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-24}}</ref>

==The Monkees==
{{Main|The Monkees}}
From 1966 to 1971, Jones was a member of the Monkees, a pop-rock group formed expressly for a television show of the same name. With [[Screen Gems]] producing the series, Jones was shortlisted for auditions, as he was the only Monkee who was signed to a deal with the studio, but still had to meet producers [[Bob Rafelson]]'s and [[Bert Schneider]]'s standards.<ref name=lefco/> Jones sang lead vocals on many of the Monkees' recordings, including "[[I Wanna Be Free (The Monkees song)|I Wanna Be Free]]" and "[[Daydream Believer]]".<ref name=lefco>{{Cite book |last=Lefcowitz |first=Eric | authorlink =  |title=Monkee Business: The Revolutionary Made-For-TV Band |publisher=Retrofuture Products, LLC |year=2011 | location = [[Port Washington, New York]] | id = |isbn = 0-943249-00-7}}</ref>

[[File:The Monkees May 1967.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Early photo of the Monkees]]

The NBC television series the Monkees was popular, and remained in syndication. After the group disbanded in 1971, Jones reunited with [[Micky Dolenz]] as well as Monkees songwriters [[Boyce and Hart|Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart]] in 1974 as a short-lived group called [[Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart]].<ref name=lefco/>

A Monkees television show marathon ("[[Pleasant Valley Sunday]]") broadcast on 23 February 1986 by MTV resulted in a wave of Monkeemania not seen since the group's heyday. Jones reunited with Dolenz and [[Peter Tork]] from 1986 to 1989 to celebrate the band's renewed success and promote the 20th anniversary of the group. A new top 20 hit, "That Was Then, This Is Now" was released (though Jones did not perform on the song) as well as an album, ''[[Pool It!]]''.<ref name=lefco/>

Monkees activity ceased until 1996 when Jones reunited with Dolenz, Tork and [[Michael Nesmith]] to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the band. The group released a new album entitled ''[[Justus (album)|Justus]]'', the first album since 1967's ''[[Headquarters (album)|Headquarters]]'' that featured the band members performing all instrumental duties. It was the last time all four Monkees performed together.<ref name=lefco/>

In February 2011, Jones confirmed rumours of another Monkees reunion. "There's even talk of putting the Monkees back together again in the next year or so for a U.S. and UK tour," he told Disney's Backstage Pass newsletter. "You're always hearing all those great songs on the radio, in commercials, movies, almost everywhere."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/wdw/myVacation/newsletter/download?id=BackstagePassS1NFPage&module=S1NF201102Article&CMP=NLC-WDWFY11Q2Feb2011WDWDomEnews0030 |title=Disney's Backstage Pass Feb. 2001 |publisher=Disneyworld.disney.go.com |accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref> The tour (Jones's last) came to fruition entitled, ''[[An Evening with The Monkees: The 45th Anniversary Tour]].''<ref>{{cite news |title=Monkees announce 10-date concert tour |url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Music/2011/02/21/Monkees-announce-10-date-concert-tour/UPI-30601298316685/ |agency=[[United Press International]] |date=21 February 2011 |accessdate=26 May 2011}}</ref>

==Post-Monkees career==
[[File:Davy Jones and Ilene 1972.JPG|thumb|140px|Jones and Ilene of "Sunday's Child" in the 1972 ABC special ''Pop Goes Davy Jones'']]
In 1967, Jones opened his first store, called Zilch, at 217 [[Thompson Street (Manhattan)|Thompson Street]] in the [[Greenwich Village]] section of [[New York City]]. The store sold "hip" clothing and accessories and also allowed customers to design their own clothes.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

After the Monkees officially disbanded in 1971, Jones kept himself busy by establishing a New York City-style street market in Los Angeles, called "The Street" which cost approximately $40,000.<ref name=baker/> He also collaborated with musical director Doug Trevor on a one-hour ABC television special entitled ''Pop Goes Davy Jones'', which featured new artists [[The Jackson 5]] and [[the Osmonds]].<ref name=baker/>

[[Bell Records]], then having a string of hits with ''[[The Partridge Family]]'', signed Jones to a somewhat inflexible solo record contract in 1971.<ref name=baker/> Jones was not allowed to choose his songs or producer, resulting in several lackluster and aimless records.<ref name=baker/> His second solo album, ''[[Davy Jones (album)|Davy Jones]]'' (1971) was notable for the song "Rainy Jane", which reached No.52 in the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]]. To promote the album, Jones performed "[[Girl (Davy Jones song)|Girl]]" on an episode of ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'' entitled "[[List of The Brady Bunch episodes|Getting Davy Jones]]".<ref name=baker/> Although the single sold poorly, the popularity of Jones's appearance on the show resulted in "Girl" becoming his best-remembered solo hit, even though it was not included in the album. The final single, "I'll Believe In You"/"Road to Love," was poorly received.<ref name=baker/>

[[File:Davy Jones Maureen McCormick Brady Bunch 1971.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Jones with [[Maureen McCormick]] in the 1971 ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'' episode "Getting Davy Jones", in which he was a guest star.]]

Jones also continued acting after the Monkees, either as himself or another character. He appeared in two episodes each of ''[[Love, American Style]]'' and ''[[My Two Dads]]''.<ref name=baker/> Jones also appeared in animated form as himself in 1972 in an hour-long episode of ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]''.<ref name=baker/> Other television appearances include ''[[Sledge Hammer!]]'', ''[[Boy Meets World]]'', ''[[Hey Arnold!]]'', ''[[The Single Guy]]'' (where he is mistaken for [[Dudley Moore]]) and ''[[Sabrina, the Teenage Witch (TV series)|Sabrina, the Teenage Witch]]'' in which he sang "[[Daydream Believer]]" to Sabrina ([[Melissa Joan Hart]]).<ref name=lefco/> In 2009, Jones made a cameo appearance as himself in the ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' episode "[[SpongeBob SquarePants vs. The Big One]]" (his appearance was meant to be a pun on [[Davy Jones' Locker]]).<ref name=lefco/>

Jones also returned to theatre several times after the Monkees. He appeared in several productions of ''[[Oliver!]]'' as the Artful Dodger, and in 1989 toured the US portraying Fagin. Jones also co-starred with Micky Dolenz in [[Harry Nilsson]]'s play ''The Point'' at the [[Mermaid Theatre]], London in 1978.<ref name=baker/>

Despite his initial high profile after the end of the Monkees, Jones struggled to establish himself as a solo artist. [[Glenn A. Baker]], author of ''Monkeemania: The True Story of the Monkees'', commented in 1986 that "for an artist as versatile and confident as (Davy) Jones, the relative failure of his post-Monkees activities is puzzling. For all his cocky predictions to the press about his future plans, Davy fell into a directionless heap when left to his own devices."<ref name=baker/>

The continued popularity of his 1971 ''Brady Bunch'' appearance led to his being cast as himself in ''[[The Brady Bunch Movie]]''. Jones sang his signature solo hit "Girl", with a [[grunge]] band providing backing,<ref name=lefco/> this time with middle-aged women swooning over him.<ref name=lefco/> Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork also appeared alongside Jones as judges.<ref name=lefco/>

On June 21, 1997, during a concert at the [[Los Angeles Coliseum]], Jones joined [[U2]]'s [[The Edge]] onstage for a karaoke performance of "[[Daydream Believer]]," which had become a fixture of the band's set during that year's [[PopMart Tour]].<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU-VF9dtWeE</ref>

[[File:Davy Jones (Geneva, IL, 2006).jpg|thumb|right|150px|Jones at a 2006 concert in Geneva, Illinois]]
In 2001, Jones released ''[[Just Me (Davy Jones album)|Just Me]]'', an album of his own songs, some written for the album and others originally on Monkees releases.<ref>{{cite web|author=Aaron Badgley |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/just-me-mw0001230763 |title=Just Me - Davy Jones &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-05-24}}</ref> In the early 2000s he was performing in the Flower Power Concert Series during [[Epcot]]'s Flower and Garden Festival, a yearly gig he would continue until his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monkeesrule43.com/myexperiences_davy_epcot02.html |title=Davy Jones Solo – April 19, 2002 – EPCOT's Flower Power Festival |publisher=Monkeesrule43.com |date=19 April 2002 |accessdate=4 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdwinfo.com/wdwinfo/guides/epcot/events/ep-flower-garden.htm |title=2014 Epcot Flower and Garden Festival, Flower Garden Epcot |publisher=Wdwinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-24}}</ref>

In April 2006, Jones recorded the single "Your Personal Penguin",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.workman.com/boynton/songs/boynton/YourPersonalPenguin.mp3 |title=MP3 of the song Personal Penguin |accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref> written by children's author [[Sandra Boynton]], as a companion piece to her new board book of the same title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.workman.com/boynton/ |title=Workman Publishing author site for Sandra Boynton |publisher=Workman.com |accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref> On 1 November 2007, the Boynton book and CD titled ''Blue Moo'' was released and Jones is featured in both the book and CD, singing "Your Personal Penguin". In 2009, Jones released a collection of classics and standards from the 1940s through the 1970s entitled ''She''.

In December 2008, ''[[Yahoo! Music]]'' named Jones the "Number 1 [[teen idol]] of all time".<ref name="oconnor" /> In 2009, Jones was rated second in a list of 10&nbsp;best teen idols compiled by [[Fox News Channel]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,474846,00.html |title=Then & Now: 10 Best Teen Idols of All Time |publisher=Fox News |accessdate=2 March 2012 |date=30 November 2011}}</ref>

==Personal life==

===Family life===
Jones was married three times. In December 1968, he married Dixie Linda Haines, with whom he had been living. Their relationship had been kept out of the public eye until after the birth of their first child in October 1968. It caused a considerable backlash for Jones from his fans when it was finally made public. Jones later stated in ''[[Tiger Beat]]'' magazine, "I kept my marriage a secret because I believe stars should be allowed a private life."<ref name=baker>{{Cite book |last=Baker |first=Glenn A.| authorlink = Glenn A.

Jones married his second wife Anita Pollinger on 24 January 1981, and also had two daughters with her&nbsp;– Jessica Lillian (born 4 September 1981) and Annabel Charlotte (born 26 June 1988). They divorced in 1996 during the Monkees' 30th Anniversary reunion tour.<ref name=spouse/> Jones married for a third time on 30 August 2009 to Jessica Pacheco, 32 years his junior.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} This was Pacheco's third marriage as well.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} On 28 July 2011, Pacheco filed to divorce Jones in Miami-Dade County, Florida, but dropped the suit in October.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} They were still married when he died in February 2012. Pacheco was omitted from Jones' will, which he made before their marriage. His oldest daughter Talia, whom he named his executor, was granted by the court the unusual request that her father's will be sealed, on the basis that "planning documents and financial affairs as public opinion could have a material effect on his copyrights, royalties and ongoing goodwill."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/trialandheirs/2012/08/20/monkey-business-surrounding-davy-jones-estate/ |title=Monkey Business Surrounding Davy Jones Estate |publisher=Forbes |date= |accessdate=2014-05-24}}</ref>

===Horse racing===
In addition to his career as an entertainer, Jones' other first love was horses. Training as a jockey in his teens, Jones later said, "I made one huge mistake. When the Monkees finished in 1969–70, I should have got away from Hollywood and got back into the racing game. Instead I waited another 10 years. Everyone makes mistakes in life and for me that was the biggest."<ref name=horse/> He held an amateur rider's licence and rode in his first race at [[Newbury Racecourse|Newbury]] in Berkshire, England for trainer [[Toby Balding]].

On 1 February 1996, he won his first race, on Digpast, in the one-mile Ontario Amateur Riders Handicap at [[Lingfield Park Racecourse|Lingfield]] in Surrey.<ref name=horse>{{cite news|last=Milham|first=Simon|title=How a racing-mad Monkee is repaying a debt of gratitude to a retired Newmarket trainer|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/racing/article-2102648/The-Monkees-frontman-Davy-Jones-repaying-Newmarket-trainer-setting-road-stardom.html|accessdate=1 March 2012|newspaper=Dail Mail |date=17 February 2012|location=London}}</ref> Jones also had horse ownership interests in both the U.S. and the U.K., and served as a commercial spokesman for [[Colonial Downs]] racetrack in [[Virginia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hbpa.org/NewsDisplay.asp?section=2&type=l&Affid=30 |title=Welcome to the National HBPA |publisher=Hbpa.org |accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref> In tribute to Jones, Lingfield Park announced that the first two races on the [[Racecard|card]] for 3 March 2012 would be renamed the "Hey Hey We're The Monkees Handicap" and the "In Memory of Davy Jones Selling Stakes" with successful horses in those races accompanied into the Winners' Enclosure by some of the Monkees' biggest hits. Plans were also announced to erect a [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] to commemorate Jones next to a [[Araucaria araucana|Monkey Puzzle]] tree on the course.<ref>{{cite web|title=Saturday 3rd March Afternoon Racing|url=http://www.lingfield-racecourse.co.uk/racing-calendar.html?mode=view&fix=2304|publisher=lingfield-racecourse.co.uk|accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref>

On the morning of 29 February 2012, Jones went to tend his fourteen horses at a farm in [[Indiantown, Florida]].
