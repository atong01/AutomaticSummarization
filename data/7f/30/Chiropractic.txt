'''Chiropractic''' is a form of [[alternative medicine]]<ref name=Chapman-Smith /> that focuses on diagnosis and treatment of mechanical disorders of the [[musculoskeletal system]], especially the [[vertebral column|spine]], under the belief that these disorders affect general health via the [[nervous system]].<ref name=Nelson /> It is the largest alternative medical profession,<ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg /> and although [[chiropractor]]s have many similarities to [[primary care]] providers, they are more similar to a medical specialty like [[dentistry]] or [[podiatry]].<ref name=Meeker-Haldeman /> The main [[chiropractic treatment technique]] involves [[manual therapy]], especially [[Spinal manipulation|manipulation of the spine]], other joints, and [[soft tissue]]s, but may also include exercises and health and lifestyle counseling.<ref name=content-of-practice /> The "specific focus of chiropractic practice" is [[vertebral subluxation|chiropractic subluxation]].<ref name=NBCE_about_chiro /> Traditional chiropractic assumes that a vertebral subluxation or spinal joint dysfunction interferes with the body's function and its [[innate intelligence]].<ref name=History-PPC /> A large number of chiropractors want to separate themselves from the traditional [[vitalistic]] concept of innate intelligence.<ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg />

<!-- Medical use -->
Many studies of treatments used by chiropractors have been conducted, with conflicting results.<ref name=DeVocht /> [[Systematic review]]s of this research have not found evidence that [[chiropractic manipulation]] is [[Efficacy#Healthcare|effective]], with the possible exception of treatment for [[back pain]].<ref name=Ernst-eval /> A critical evaluation found that collectively, spinal manipulation was ineffective at treating any condition.<ref name=Posadzki-Ernst /> A [[Cochrane review]] found very low to moderate evidence that spinal manipulation therapy was any more effective than inert interventions, sham SMT or as an adjunct therapy for acute low back pain.<ref name=Cochrane-2013 /> Spinal manipulation may be [[cost-effective]] for sub-acute or chronic low back pain but the results for acute low back pain were insufficient.<ref name=Lin2011 /> The efficacy and cost-effectiveness of maintenance chiropractic care are unknown.<ref name=Leboeuf-Yde-C /> The evidence suggests that spinal manipulation therapy is safe,<ref name=Johnson-2012 /> but the rate of adverse events is unknown<ref name=Ernst-adverse /> as there is under-reporting.<ref name=Ernst-2012 /> It is frequently associated with mild to moderate [[adverse effects]], with serious or fatal complications in rare cases.<ref name=Ernst-adverse /> There is controversy surrounding the level of risk of stroke from [[cervical manipulation]].<ref name=Haynes /> It has been suggested that the relationship is [[causative]],<ref name=Ernst-2010 /><ref name=Ernst-death /> but this is disputed by many chiropractors who believe it is unproven.<ref name=Ernst-death />

<!-- Epidemiology -->
Chiropractic is well established in the United States, Canada, and Australia.<ref name=global-strategy /> It overlaps with other manual-therapy professions, including [[massage therapy]], [[osteopathy]], and [[physical therapy]].<ref name=Norris /> Back and neck pain are the specialties of chiropractic but many chiropractors treat ailments other than musculoskeletal issues.<ref name=Ernst-eval /> Most who seek chiropractic care do so for [[low back pain]].<ref name=Hurwitz />

<!-- History -->
[[Daniel David Palmer|D.D. Palmer]] founded chiropractic in the 1890s, and his son [[Bartlett Joshua Palmer|B.J. Palmer]] helped to expand it in the early 20th century.<ref name=Martin /> It has two main groups: "straights", now the minority, emphasize vitalism, innate intelligence and [[spinal adjustment]]s, and consider vertebral subluxations to be the cause of all disease; "mixers", the majority, are more open to mainstream views and conventional medical techniques, such as [[exercise]], [[massage]], and [[ice pack|ice therapy]].<ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg /> Throughout its history, chiropractic has been [[Chiropractic controversy and criticism|controversial]].<ref name=DeVocht /><ref name=Homola /> Chiropractic's foundation is at odds with [[mainstream medicine]], and has been sustained by [[pseudoscientific]] ideas such as subluxation and innate intelligence<ref name=History-Primer2 /> that are not based on solid science.<ref name=Ernst-eval /> Despite the overwhelming evidence that [[vaccination]] is an effective [[public health]] intervention, among chiropractors there are significant disagreements over the subject,<ref name=Busse /> which has led to negative impacts on both public vaccination and mainstream acceptance of chiropractic.<ref name=Campbell /> The [[American Medical Association]] called chiropractic an "unscientific cult" in 1966<ref name=Chiro-PH /> and boycotted it until losing an [[Wilk v. American Medical Association|antitrust case in 1987]].<ref name=Cooper /> Chiropractic has had a strong political base and sustained demand for services; in recent decades, it has gained more legitimacy and greater acceptance among medical [[physician]]s and [[health plan]]s in the U.S.,<ref name=Cooper /> and [[evidence-based medicine]] has been used to review research studies and generate [[Medical guideline|practice guidelines]].<ref name=Villanueva-Russell />

Chiropractic's origins lie in the [[folk medicine]] of [[bonesetter|bonesetting]],<ref name=Ernst-eval /> and as it evolved it incorporated [[vitalism]], [[spirituality|spiritual inspiration]] and [[rationalism]].<ref name=Keating05 /> Its early philosophy was based on [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] from [[dogma|irrefutable doctrine]] helped distinguish chiropractic from [[medicine]], provided it with legal and political defenses against claims of practicing medicine without a license, and allowed chiropractors to establish themselves as an autonomous profession.<ref name=Keating05 /> This "straight" philosophy, taught to generations of chiropractors, rejects the [[Inference|inferential reasoning]] of the [[scientific method]],<ref name=Keating05 /> and relies on deductions from vitalistic first principles rather than on the [[materialism]] of science.<ref name=Chiro-Beliefs /> However, most practitioners tend to incorporate scientific research into chiropractic,<ref name="Keating05" /> and most practitioners are "mixers" who attempt to combine the materialistic [[reductionism]] of science with the [[metaphysics]] of their predecessors and with the [[Holistic medicine|holistic paradigm of wellness]].<ref name=Chiro-Beliefs /> A 2008 commentary proposed that chiropractic actively divorce itself from the straight philosophy as part of a campaign to eliminate [[Testability|untestable]] dogma and engage in [[critical thinking]] and evidence-based research.<ref name=Murphy-pod>{{cite journal | author = Murphy DR, Schneider MJ, Seaman DR, Perle SM, Nelson CF | title = How can chiropractic become a respected mainstream profession?

Although a wide diversity of ideas exist among chiropractors,<ref name=Keating05 /> they share the belief that the spine and health are related in a fundamental way, and that this relationship is mediated through the [[nervous system]].<ref>{{cite book|author= Gay RE, Nelson CF|chapter= Chiropractic philosophy|chapterurl=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=altrehab.section.336|editor= Wainapel SF, Fast A (eds.)|title= Alternative Medicine and Rehabilitation: a Guide for Practitioners|year=2003|isbn=1-888799-66-8|location= New York|publisher= [[Demos Medical Publishing]]}}</ref> Chiropractors examine the [[biomechanics]], structure and function of the spine, along with its effects on the [[musculoskeletal]] and nervous systems and what they believe to be its role in health and disease.<ref name=PGM-history>{{cite web|title= History of chiropractic care|author= Physicians Group Management|accessdate=2014-03-22|url=http://www.pgmbilling.com/blog/199-history-of-chiropractic-care}}</ref> Some chiropactors say spinal manipulation can have an effect of a variety of ailments such as [[irritable bowel syndrome]] and [[asthma]].<ref name=nhs-choices>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chiropractic/Pages/Introduction.aspx |title=Chiropractic |publisher=[[NHS Choices]] |date=1 May 2012 |accessdate=January 2014}}</ref>

[[Holism]] assumes that health is affected by everything in an individual's environment; some sources also include a spiritual or [[Existentialism|existential]] dimension.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Freeman J | title = Towards a definition of holism | journal = Br J Gen Pract | volume = 55 | issue = 511 | pages = 154–5 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15720949 | pmc = 1463203 }}</ref> In contrast, reductionism in chiropractic reduces causes and cures of health problems to a single factor, [[#Vertebral subluxation|vertebral subluxation]].<ref name=Murphy-pod /> Conservatism considers the risks of clinical interventions when balancing them against their benefits.

''Straight'' chiropractors adhere to the philosophical principles set forth by D.D. and B.J. Palmer, and retain [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] definitions and vitalistic qualities.<ref name=History-Primer /> Straight chiropractors believe that vertebral subluxation leads to interference with an "innate intelligence" exerted via the human nervous system and is a primary underlying risk factor for many diseases.<ref name=History-Primer /> Straights view the medical diagnosis of patient complaints (which they consider to be the "secondary effects" of subluxations) to be unnecessary for chiropractic treatment.<ref name=History-Primer /> Thus, straight chiropractors are concerned primarily with the detection and correction of vertebral subluxation via adjustment and do not "mix" other types of therapies into their practice style.<ref name=History-Primer /> Their philosophy and explanations are metaphysical in nature and they prefer to use traditional chiropractic lexicon terminology (e.g., perform spinal analysis, detect subluxation, correct with adjustment).<ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg /> They prefer to remain separate and distinct from mainstream health care.<ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg /> Although considered the minority group, "they have been able to transform their status as purists and heirs of the lineage into influence dramatically out of proportion to their numbers."<ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg />

''Mixer'' chiropractors "mix" diagnostic and treatment approaches from chiropractic, medical and/or osteopathic viewpoints and make up the majority of chiropractors.<ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg /> Unlike straight chiropractors, mixers believe subluxation is one of many causes of disease, and hence they tend to be open to mainstream medicine.<ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg>{{cite journal |author=Kaptchuk TJ, Eisenberg DM |title=Chiropractic: origins, controversies, and contributions |journal=Arch. Intern. Med. |volume=158 |issue=20 |pages=2215–24 |date=November 1998 |pmid=9818801 |doi=10.1001/archinte.158.20.2215 |url=http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?volume=158&page=2215}}</ref> Many of them incorporate mainstream medical diagnostics and employ conventional treatments including techniques of [[physical therapy]] such as exercise, [[stretching]], [[massage]], [[ice pack]]s, [[electrical muscle stimulation]], [[therapeutic ultrasound]], and [[moist heat]].<ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg /> Some mixers also use techniques from alternative medicine, including [[Dietary supplement|nutritional supplements]], [[acupuncture]], [[homeopathy]], [[Herbalism|herbal remedies]], and [[biofeedback]].<ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg />

Although mixers are the majority group, many of them retain belief in vertebral subluxation as shown in a 2003 survey of 1100 North American chiropractors, which found that 88% wanted to retain the term "vertebral subluxation complex", and that when asked to estimate the percent of disorders of internal organs (such as the heart, the lungs, or the stomach) that subluxation significantly contributes to, the mean response was 62%.<ref name=McDonald /> A 2008 survey of 6,000 American chiropractors demonstrated that most chiropractors seem to believe that a subluxation-based clinical approach may be of limited utility for addressing [[visceral disorder]]s, and greatly favored non-subluxation-based clinical approaches for such conditions.<ref name=Smith-Carber /> The same survey showed that most chiropractors generally believed that the majority of their clinical approach for addressing musculoskeletal/biomechanical disorders such as back pain was based on subluxation.<ref name=Smith-Carber>{{cite journal|journal=[[National University of Health Sciences#Publications|Journal of Chiropractic Humanities]]|year=2008|volume=15|pages=19–26|title=Survey of US Chiropractor Attitudes and Behaviors about Subluxation|author=Smith M, Carber LA|url=http://archive.journalchirohumanities.com/Vol%2015/JChiroprHumanit2008v15-19-26.pdf|doi=10.1016/s1556-3499(13)60166-7}}</ref>

=== Vertebral subluxation ===
{{Main|Vertebral subluxation}}

Palmer hypothesized that vertebral joint misalignments, which he termed ''vertebral subluxations'', interfered with the body's function and its inborn ability to heal itself.<ref name=History-PPC>{{cite book|author= [[Joseph C. Keating, Jr.|Keating JC Jr]]|chapter= A brief history of the chiropractic profession|pages=23–64|title= Principles and Practice of Chiropractic|edition=3rd|editor= Haldeman S, Dagenais S, Budgell B (eds.)|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2005|isbn=0-07-137534-1|display-editors=etal}}</ref> D.D. Palmer repudiated his earlier theory that vertebral subluxations caused pinched nerves in the intervertebral spaces in favor of subluxations causing altered nerve vibration, either too tense or too slack, affecting the tone (health) of the end organ.<ref name=Keating1995 /> D.D. Palmer, using a vitalistic approach, imbued the term ''subluxation'' with a metaphysical and [[philosophical]] meaning.<ref name=Keating1995 /> He qualified this by noting that knowledge of innate intelligence was not essential to the competent practice of chiropractic.<ref name=Keating1995>{{cite web|url=http://chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/PalmerDD/PalmerDD's_Forgotten_Theories1995.pdf|format=PDF|title= D.D. Palmer's forgotten theories of chiropractic|author= Keating JC Jr|publisher= [[Association for the History of Chiropractic]]|year=1995|accessdate=2008-05-14}}</ref> This concept was later expanded upon by his son, B.J. Palmer, and was instrumental in providing the legal basis of differentiating chiropractic from conventional medicine. In 1910, D.D. Palmer theorized that the nervous system controlled health:

:"[[Physiologist]]s divide nerve-fibers, which form the nerves, into two classes, [[Afferent nerve fiber|afferent]] and [[efferent]]. Impressions are made on the peripheral afferent fiber-endings; these create sensations that are transmitted to the center of the nervous system. Efferent nerve-fibers carry impulses out from the center to their endings. Most of these go to muscles and are therefore called motor impulses; some are secretory and enter glands; a portion are inhibitory, their function being to restrain secretion. Thus, nerves carry impulses outward and sensations inward. The activity of these nerves, or rather their fibers, may become excited or allayed by impingement, the result being a modification of functionality—too much or not enough action—which is disease."<ref name=ChiropractorsAdjuster1910 />
[[File:Xray Machine Champion Chiropractic.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|Chiropractors use [[x-ray radiography]] to examine the bone structure of a patient.]]
Vertebral subluxation, a core concept of traditional chiropractic, remains unsubstantiated and largely untested, and a debate about whether to keep it in the chiropractic paradigm has been ongoing for decades.<ref name=Keating-subluxation /> In general, critics of traditional subluxation-based chiropractic (including chiropractors) are skeptical of its clinical value, [[dogmatic]] beliefs and metaphysical approach. While straight chiropractic still retains the traditional vitalistic construct espoused by the founders, evidence-based chiropractic suggests that a mechanistic view will allow chiropractic care to become integrated into the wider health care community.<ref name=Keating-subluxation>{{cite journal | author = Keating JC, Charlton KH, Grod JP, Perle SM, Sikorski D, Winterstein JF | title = Subluxation: dogma or science? | journal = Chiropr Osteopat | volume = 13 | issue =  | pages = 17 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16092955 | pmc = 1208927 | doi = 10.1186/1746-1340-13-17 }}</ref> This is still a continuing source of debate within the chiropractic profession as well, with some schools of chiropractic still teaching the traditional/straight subluxation-based chiropractic, while others have moved towards an [[evidence-based]] chiropractic that rejects metaphysical foundings and limits itself to primarily neuromusculoskeletal conditions.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[J Chiropr Educ]]|year=2000|volume=14|issue=2|pages=71–7|title=A survey of the use of evidence-based health care in chiropractic college clinics|author=Rose KA, Adams A|url=http://www.journalchiroed.com/2000/JCEFall2000Rose.PDF|format=PDF }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[J Man Manip Ther]]|year=2006|volume=14|issue=2|pages=E14–8|title=Can chiropractors and evidence-based manual therapists work together? an opinion from a veteran chiropractor|author=Homola S|url=http://jmmtonline.com/documents/HomolaV14N2E.pdf|format=PDF }}</ref>

In 2005, the chiropractic subluxation was defined by the [[World Health Organization]] as "a lesion or dysfunction in a joint or motion segment in which alignment, movement integrity and/or physiological function are altered, although contact between joint surfaces remains intact.<ref name=WHO-guidelines /> It is essentially a functional entity, which may influence biomechanical and neural integrity."<ref name=WHO-guidelines /> This differs from the medical definition of subluxation as a significant structural displacement, which can be seen with static imaging techniques such as [[Radio diagnostics|X-rays]].<ref name=WHO-guidelines>{{cite journal |author= World Health Organization|year=2005|title= WHO guidelines on basic training and safety in chiropractic|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/traditional/Chiro-Guidelines.pdf|format=PDF|isbn= 92-4-159371-7|accessdate=2008-02-29}}</ref> The 2008 book ''[[Trick or Treatment]]'' states "X-rays can reveal neither the subluxations nor the innate intelligence associated with chiropractic philosophy, because they do not exist."<ref name=Trick-or-Treatment /> [[Attorneys in the United States|Attorney]] David Chapman-Smith, Secretary-General of the [[World Federation of Chiropractic]], has stated that "Medical critics have asked how there can be a subluxation if it cannot be seen on x-ray. The answer is that the chiropractic subluxation is essentially a functional entity, not structural, and is therefore no more visible on static x-ray than a [[limp]] or headache or any other functional problem."<ref>{{cite book|page=160|chapter=Principles and Goals of Chiropractic Care|title=The Chiropractic Profession: Its Education, Practice, Research and Future Directions|author=David Chapman-Smith|year=2000|publisher=NCMIC Group|isbn=1-892734-02-8}}</ref> The [[General Chiropractic Council]], the statutory regulatory body for chiropractors in the United Kingdom, states that the chiropractic vertebral subluxation complex "is not supported by any clinical research evidence that would allow claims to be made that it is the cause of disease."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.gcc-uk.org/files/link_file/Guidance_on_claims_made_for_the_chiropractic_VSC_18August10.pdf| format=PDF|title=Guidance on claims made for the chiropractic vertebral subluxation complex| publisher=General Chiropractic Council|accessdate=2010-09-30}}</ref>

As of 2014, the [[National Board of Chiropractic Examiners]] states "The specific focus of chiropractic practice is known as the chiropractic subluxation or joint dysfunction. A subluxation is a health concern that manifests in the skeletal joints, and, through complex anatomical and physiological relationships, affects the nervous system and may lead to reduced function, disability or illness."<ref name=NBCE_about_chiro>{{Citation |last=NBCE |first= |date=2014 |title=About Chiropractic |publisher=[[National Board of Chiropractic Examiners]] |url=http://www.nbce.org/about/about_chiropractic/ |accessdate=February 1, 2015 }}</ref>

Spinal manipulation, which chiropractors call "spinal adjustment" or "chiropractic adjustment", is the most common treatment used in chiropractic care.<ref name=NBCE_techniques /> Spinal manipulation is a passive manual maneuver during which a three-joint complex is taken past the normal range of movement, but not so far as to dislocate or damage the joint.<ref name=ACA-SMP /> Its defining factor is a dynamic thrust, which is a sudden force that causes an audible release and attempts to increase a joint's range of motion.<ref name=ACA-SMP /> High-velocity, low-amplitude spinal manipulation (HVLA-SM) thrusts have physiological effects that signal neural discharge from paraspinal muscle tissues, depending on duration and amplitude of the thrust are factors of the degree in paraspinal muscle spindles activation.<ref name=Pickar2007 /> Clinical skill in employing HVLA-SM thrusts depends on the ability of the practitioner to handle the duration and magnitude of the load.<ref name=Pickar2007>{{cite journal | author = Pickar JG, Sung PS, Kang YM, Ge W | title = Response of lumbar paraspinal muscles spindles is greater to spinal manipulative loading compared with slower loading under length control | journal = Spine J | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 583–95 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17905321 | pmc = 2075482 | doi = 10.1016/j.spinee.2006.10.006 }}</ref> More generally, [[spinal manipulative therapy]] (SMT) describes techniques where the hands are used to manipulate, massage, mobilize, adjust, stimulate, apply traction to, or otherwise influence the spine and related tissues.<ref name=ACA-SMP>{{cite web|url=http://acatoday.org/pdf/spinal_manipulation_policy.pdf|format=PDF|title= Spinal manipulation policy statement|author= Winkler K, Hegetschweiler-Goertz C, Jackson PS|accessdate=2008-05-24|year=2003|publisher= American Chiropractic Association|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

There are several schools of chiropractic adjustive techniques, although most chiropractors mix techniques from several schools.

Chiropractic was founded in 1895 by [[Daniel David Palmer|Daniel David (D.D.) Palmer]] in [[Davenport, Iowa]]. Palmer, a [[Magnetic healing|magnetic healer]], hypothesized that manual manipulation of the spine could cure disease.<ref name=Baer /> The first chiropractic patient of D.D. Palmer was [[Harvey Lillard]], a worker in the building where Palmer's office was located.<ref name=History-Primer /> He claimed that he had severely reduced hearing for 17 years, which started soon following a "pop" in his spine.<ref name=History-Primer /> A few days following his adjustment, Lillard claimed his hearing was almost completely restored.<ref name=History-Primer /> Chiropractic competed with its predecessor osteopathy, another medical system based on magnetic healing and [[bonesetting]]; both systems were founded by charismatic midwesterners in opposition to the conventional medicine of the day, and both postulated that manipulation improved health.<ref name=Baer>{{cite journal |journal=Med Anthropol Q |year=1987 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=176–93 |title=Divergence and convergence in two systems of manual medicine: osteopathy and chiropractic in the United States |author=Baer HA |doi=10.1525/maq.1987.1.2.02a00030 }}</ref> Although initially keeping chiropractic a family secret, in 1898 Palmer began teaching it to a few students at his new [[Palmer School of Chiropractic]].<ref name=Martin /> One student, his son [[Bartlett Joshua Palmer|Bartlett Joshua (B.J.)

Early chiropractors believed that all disease was caused by interruptions in the flow of innate intelligence, a [[vitalistic]] nervous energy or life force that represented God's presence in man; chiropractic leaders often invoked religious imagery and moral traditions.<ref name=Martin /> D.D. and B.J. both seriously considered declaring chiropractic a religion, which might have provided [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|legal protection under the U.S. constitution]], but decided against it partly to avoid confusion with [[Christian Science]].<ref name=Martin /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/PalmerDD/PalmerDD's_Religion-of-Chiro.pdf|format=PDF|author= Palmer DD|title= D.D.

Chiropractors faced heavy opposition from organized medicine.<ref name=History-Primer /> Thousands of chiropractors were prosecuted for [[Health care provider#Practicing without a license|practicing medicine without a license]], and D.D. and many other chiropractors were jailed.<ref name=History-Primer /> To defend against medical statutes B.J. argued that chiropractic was separate and distinct from medicine, asserting that chiropractors "analyzed" rather than "diagnosed", and "adjusted" subluxations rather than "treated" disease.<ref name=History-Primer /> B.J. cofounded the Universal Chiropractors' Association (UCA) to provide legal services to arrested chiropractors.<ref name=History-Primer /> Although the UCA won their first test case in Wisconsin in 1907, prosecutions instigated by state medical boards became increasingly common and in many cases were successful. In response, chiropractors conducted political campaigns to secure separate licensing statutes, eventually succeeding in all fifty states, from Kansas in 1913 through Louisiana in 1974.<ref name=History-Primer /> The longstanding feud between chiropractors and [[medical doctor]]s continued for decades. The AMA labeled chiropractic an "unscientific [[cult]]" in 1966,<ref name=Chiro-PH>{{cite journal | author = Johnson C, Baird R, Dougherty PE, Globe G, Green BN, Haneline M, Hawk C, Injeyan HS, Killinger L, Kopansky-Giles D, Lisi AJ, Mior SA, Smith M | title = Chiropractic and public health: current state and future vision | journal = J Manipulative Physiol Ther | volume = 31 | issue = 6 | pages = 397–410 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18722194 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmpt.2008.07.001 }}</ref> and until 1980 advised its members that it was unethical for medical doctors to associate with "unscientific practitioners".<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cherkin D | title = AMA policy on chiropractic | journal = Am J Public Health | volume = 79 | issue = 11 | pages = 1569–70 | date = November 1989 | pmid = 2817179 | pmc = 1349822 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.79.11.1569-a }}</ref> This culminated in a landmark 1987 decision, ''[[Wilk v. American Medical Association|Wilk v. AMA]]'', in which the court found that the AMA had engaged in unreasonable restraint of trade and conspiracy, and which ended the AMA's de facto boycott of chiropractic.<ref name=Cooper />

Serious research to test chiropractic theories did not begin until the 1970s, and is continuing to be hampered by antiscientific and [[pseudoscientific]] ideas that sustained the profession in its long battle with organized medicine.<ref name=History-Primer /> By the mid 1990s there was a growing scholarly interest in chiropractic, which helped efforts to improve service quality and establish clinical guidelines that recommended manual therapies for acute low back pain.<ref name=History-Primer>{{cite web |title= Chiropractic history: a primer |author= Keating JC Jr, Cleveland CS III, Menke M |url=http://ahc.memberclicks.net/assets/documents/ChiroHistoryPrimer.pdf |format=PDF |year=2005 |accessdate=2008-06-16 |publisher= Association for the History of Chiropractic}}</ref> In recent decades chiropractic gained legitimacy and greater acceptance by medical physicians and [[health plan]]s, and enjoyed a strong political base and sustained demand for services.<ref name=Cooper /> However, its future seemed uncertain: as the number of practitioners grew, evidence-based medicine insisted on treatments with demonstrated value, managed care restricted payment, and competition grew from [[massage therapist]]s and other health professions.<ref name=Cooper /> The profession responded by marketing natural products and devices more aggressively, and by reaching deeper into alternative medicine and primary care.<ref name=Cooper>{{cite journal | author = Cooper RA, McKee HJ | title = Chiropractic in the United States: trends and issues | journal = Milbank Q | volume = 81 | issue = 1 | pages = 107–38, table of contents | year = 2003 | pmid = 12669653 | pmc = 2690192 | doi = 10.1111/1468-0009.00040 }}</ref>

The word ''chiropractic'' comes from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] χειρο- ''[[wikt:chiro#English|chiro-]]'' (itself from [[wikt:χείρ#Ancient Greek|χείρ]] ''cheir'' "hand"), "hand" and [[wikt:πρακτικός#Ancient Greek|πρακτικός]] ''praktikos'', "practical."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/chiropractic |title=Definition of ''chiropractic'' in English |year=2014 |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/chiro- |title=Definition of ''chiro-'' in English |year=2014 |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}</ref>

== Public health ==
{{further2|[[Vaccine controversy#Alternative medicine|Vaccine controversy and alternative medicine]]|[[Water fluoridation controversy]]}}
Some chiropractors oppose [[vaccination]] and [[water fluoridation]], which are common [[public health]] practices.<ref name=Murphy-pod /> Within the chiropractic community there are significant disagreements about vaccination,<ref name=Busse /><ref name=Campbell /> one of the most cost-effective public health interventions available.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ehreth J | title = The global value of vaccination | journal = Vaccine | volume = 21 | issue = 7–8 | pages = 596–600 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12531324 | doi = 10.1016/S0264-410X(02)00623-0 }}</ref> Most chiropractic writings on vaccination focus on its negative aspects,<ref name=Busse /> claiming that it is hazardous, ineffective, and unnecessary.<ref name=Campbell /> Some chiropractors have embraced vaccination, but a significant portion of the profession rejects it, as original chiropractic philosophy traces diseases to causes in the spine and states that vaccines interfere with healing.<ref name=Campbell /> The extent to which anti-vaccination views perpetuate the current chiropractic profession is uncertain.<ref name=Busse /> The American Chiropractic Association and the International Chiropractors Association support individual exemptions to compulsory vaccination laws, and a 1995 survey of U.S. chiropractors found that about a third believed there was no scientific proof that immunization prevents disease.<ref name=Campbell>{{cite journal | author = Campbell JB, Busse JW, Injeyan HS | title = Chiropractors and vaccination: a historical perspective | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 105 | issue = 4 | pages = e43 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10742364 | doi = 10.1542/peds.105.4.e43 | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/105/4/e43 }}</ref> The [[Canadian Chiropractic Association]] supports vaccination;<ref name=Busse>{{cite journal | author = Busse JW, Morgan L, Campbell JB | title = Chiropractic antivaccination arguments | journal = J Manipulative Physiol Ther | volume = 28 | issue = 5 | pages = 367–73 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15965414 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmpt.2005.04.011 | url = http://jmptonline.org/article/S0161-4754(05)00111-9/fulltext }}</ref> a survey in Alberta in 2002 found that 25% of chiropractors advised patients for, and 27% against, vaccinating themselves or their children.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Russell ML, Injeyan HS, Verhoef MJ, Eliasziw M | title = Beliefs and behaviours: understanding chiropractors and immunization | journal = Vaccine | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 372–9 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15530683 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2004.05.027 }}</ref>

Early opposition to water fluoridation included chiropractors, some of whom continue to oppose it as being incompatible with chiropractic philosophy and an infringement of personal freedom. Other chiropractors have actively promoted fluoridation, and several chiropractic organizations have endorsed scientific principles of public health.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Jones RB, Mormann DN, Durtsche TB | title = Fluoridation referendum in La Crosse, Wisconsin: contributing factors to success | journal = Am J Public Health | volume = 79 | issue = 10 | pages = 1405–8 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2782512 | pmc = 1350185 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.79.10.1405 | url = http://www.ajph.org/cgi/reprint/79/10/1405.pdf | format = PDF }}</ref> In addition to traditional chiropractic opposition to water fluoridation and vaccination, chiropractors' attempts to establish a positive reputation for their public health role are also compromised by their reputation for recommending repetitive lifelong chiropractic treatment.<ref name=Murphy-pod />
