To distinguish him from Ajax, son of Oileus (<link><target>Ajax the Lesser</target></link>), he is called &quot;<bold>Telamonian Ajax</bold>,&quot; &quot;<bold>Greater Ajax</bold>,&quot; or &quot;<bold>Ajax the Great</bold>&quot;. In<space/><link><target>Etruscan mythology</target></link>, he is known as<space/><bold>Aivas Tlamunus</bold>.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Family</heading><paragraph>Ajax is the son of Telamon, who was the son of<space/><link><target>Aeacus</target></link><space/>and grandson of<space/><link><target>Zeus</target></link>, and his first wife Periboea.

The Italian scholar Maggiani recently showed that on an Etruscan tomb dedicated to Racvi Satlnei in Bologna (5th century BC) there is a writing that says: &quot;aivastelmunsl&quot; = &quot;family of Ajax Tlamon&quot;.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Description</heading><paragraph>In Homer's<space/><italics>Iliad</italics><space/>he is described as of great stature, colossal frame and strongest of all the<space/><link><target>Achaeans (Homer)</target><part>Achaeans</part></link>. Known as the &quot;bulwark of the Achaeans&quot;,<extension extension_name='ref'>Homer,<space/><italics>Iliad</italics><space/><link type='external' href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Il.+6.5'>6.5</link>.</extension><space/>he was trained by the<space/><link><target>centaur</target></link><space/><link><target>Chiron</target></link><space/>(who had trained Ajax' father Telamon and Achilles' father<space/><link><target>Peleus</target></link><space/>and would later die of an accidental wound inflicted by<space/><link><target>Heracles</target></link>, whom he was at the time training), at the same time as Achilles. He was described as fearless, strong and powerful but also with a very high level of combat intelligence. Ajax commands his army wielding a huge shield made of seven cow-hides with a layer of bronze. Most notably, Ajax is not wounded in any of the battles described in the<space/><italics>Iliad</italics>, and he is the only principal character on either side who does not receive substantial assistance from any of the gods who take part in the battles, although, in book 13, Poseidon strikes Ajax with his staff, renewing his strength.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Trojan War</heading><paragraph>In the<space/><italics>Iliad</italics>, Ajax is notable for his abundant strength and courage, seen particularly in two fights with<space/><link><target>Hector</target></link>. In Book 7, Ajax is chosen by lot to meet Hector in a duel which lasts most of a whole day. Ajax at first gets the better of the encounter, wounding Hector with his spear and knocking him down with a large stone, but Hector fights on until the<space/><link><target>herald</target><trail>s</trail></link>, acting at the direction of Zeus, call a draw: the action ends without a winner and with the two combatants exchanging gifts, Ajax giving Hector a purple sash and Hector giving Ajax his sharp sword.</paragraph><paragraph>The second fight between Ajax and Hector occurs when the latter breaks into the Mycenaean camp, and fights with the Greeks among the ships. In Book 14, Ajax throws a giant rock at Hector which almost kills him. In Book 15, Hector is restored to his strength by<space/><link><target>Apollo</target></link><space/>and returns to attack the ships. Ajax, wielding an enormous spear as a weapon and leaping from ship to ship, holds off the<space/><link><target>Troy</target><part>Trojan</part></link><space/>armies virtually single-handedly. In Book 16, Hector and Ajax duel once again. Hector is set on burning the ships, the only way he feels the Greeks will truly be defeated. Hector is able to disarm Ajax (although Ajax is not hurt) and Ajax is forced to retreat, seeing that Zeus is clearly favoring Hector. Hector and the Trojans succeed in burning one Greek ship, the culmination of an assault that almost finishes the war. Ajax is responsible for the death of many Trojans lords, including<space/><link><target>Phorcys (Trojan War)</target><part>Phorcys</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Ajax often fought in tandem with his brother Teucer, known for his skill with the bow. Ajax would wield his magnificent shield, as Teucer stood behind picking off enemy Trojans.</paragraph><paragraph>Achilles was absent during these encounters because of his feud with Agamemnon. In Book 9, Agamemnon and the other Mycenaean chiefs send Ajax,<space/><link><target>Odysseus</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Phoenix (son of Amyntor)</target><part>Phoenix</part></link><space/>to the tent of Achilles in an attempt to reconcile with the great warrior and induce him to return to the fight. Although Ajax speaks earnestly and is well received, he does not succeed in convincing Achilles.</paragraph><paragraph>When<space/><link><target>Patroclus</target></link><space/>is killed, Hector tries to steal his body. Ajax, assisted by<space/><link><target>Menelaus</target></link>, succeeds in fighting off the Trojans and taking the body back with his chariot; however, the Trojans had already stripped Patroclus of Achilles' armor. Ajax's prayer to Zeus to remove the fog that has descended on the battle to allow them to fight or die in the light of day has become proverbial. According to<space/><link><target>Hyginus</target></link>, in total, Ajax killed 28 people at Troy.<extension extension_name='ref'>Hyginus,<space/><italics><link><target>Fabulae</target></link></italics><space/><link type='external' href='http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae3.html'>114</link>.</extension></paragraph><heading level='4'>Death</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Ajax (Carstens).jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>''Sorrowful Ajax'' (Asmus Jacob Carstens, ca. 1791)</part></link><link><target>File:Antimenes Painter - Black-figure Amphora with Ajax Carrying the Dead Achilles - Walters 4817 - Side A.jpg</target><part></part><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>A Black-figure Amphora with Ajax Carrying the Dead<space/><link><target>Achilles</target></link>.<space/><link><target>Walters Art Museum</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Baltimore</target></link>.</part></link>Like most of the other Greek leaders, Ajax is alive and well as the<space/><italics>Iliad</italics><space/>comes to a close.

After the burial, each claims Achilles' magical armor for himself as recognition for his heroic efforts. After several days of competition, Odysseus and Ajax are tied for the ownership of the divine armor, which had been forged on<space/><link><target>Mount Olympus</target></link><space/>by the smith-god<space/><link><target>Hephaestus</target></link>. It is then that a competition is held to determine who deserves the armor. Ajax argues that because of his strength and the fighting he has done for the Greeks, including saving the ships from Hector, and driving him off with a massive rock, he deserves the armor.<extension extension_name='ref'>Ovid,<space/><italics>Metamorphoses</italics>, translated by Rolfe Humphries (Indianapolis: Indiana University, 1955), Book XIII, pp. 305-309)</extension><space/>However, Odysseus proves to be more eloquent, and the council gives him the armor.
