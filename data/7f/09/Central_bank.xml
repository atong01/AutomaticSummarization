In other countries, the term national bank may be used to indicate that the central bank's goals are broader than monetary stability, such as full employment, industrial development, or other goals.

When a country has its own national currency, this involves the issue of some form of standardized currency, which is essentially a form of<space/><link><target>promissory note</target></link>: a promise to exchange the note for &quot;money&quot; under certain circumstances. Historically, this was often a promise to exchange the money for precious metals in some fixed amount. Now, when many currencies are<space/><link><target>fiat money</target></link>, the &quot;promise to pay&quot; consists of the promise to accept that currency to pay for taxes.</paragraph><paragraph>A central bank may use another country's currency either directly in a currency union, or indirectly on a currency board. In the latter case, exemplified by the<space/><link><target>Bulgarian National Bank</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Hong Kong</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Latvia</target></link>, the local currency is backed at a fixed rate by the central bank's holdings of a foreign currency.Similar to commercial banks, central banks hold assets (government bonds, foreign exchange, gold, and other financial assets) and incur liabilities (currency outstanding). Central banks create money by issuing interest-free currency notes and selling them to the public (government) in exchange for interest-bearing assets such as government bonds. When a central bank wishes to purchase more bonds than their respective national governments make available, they may purchase private bonds or assets denominated in foreign currencies.</paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>European Central Bank</target></link><space/>remits its interest income to the central banks of the member countries of the European Union. The US<space/><link><target>Federal Reserve</target></link><space/>remits all its profits to the U.S. Treasury. This income, derived from the power to issue currency, is referred to as<space/><link><target>seigniorage</target></link>, and usually belongs to the national government. The state-sanctioned power to create currency is called the<space/><link><target>Right of Issuance</target></link>. Throughout history there have been disagreements over this power, since whoever controls the creation of currency controls the seigniorage income.The expression &quot;monetary policy&quot; may also refer more narrowly to the interest-rate targets and other active measures undertaken by the monetary authority.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Goals</heading><heading level='4'>High employment</heading><paragraph><link><target>Frictional unemployment</target></link><space/>is the time period between jobs when a worker is searching for, or transitioning from one job to another.

Although the mechanism differs from country to country, most use a similar mechanism based on a central bank's ability to create as much<space/><link><target>fiat money</target></link><space/>as required.</paragraph><paragraph>The mechanism to move the market towards a 'target rate' (whichever specific rate is used) is generally to lend money or borrow money in theoretically unlimited quantities, until the targeted market rate is sufficiently close to the target. Central banks may do so by lending money to and borrowing money from (taking deposits from) a limited number of qualified banks, or by purchasing and selling bonds. As an example of how this functions, the<space/><link><target>Bank of Canada</target></link><space/>sets a target<space/><link><target>overnight rate</target></link>, and a band of plus or minus 0.25%. Qualified banks borrow from each other within this band, but never above or below, because the central bank will always lend to them at the top of the band, and take deposits at the bottom of the band; in principle, the capacity to borrow and lend at the extremes of the band are unlimited.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/backgrounders/bg-p9.html'>Bank of Canada backgrounder: Target for the Overnight Rate</link></extension><space/>Other central banks use similar mechanisms.</paragraph><paragraph>The target rates are generally short-term rates. The actual rate that borrowers and lenders receive on the market will depend on (perceived) credit risk, maturity and other factors. For example, a central bank might set a target rate for overnight lending of 4.5%, but rates for (equivalent risk) five-year bonds might be 5%, 4.75%, or, in cases of<space/><link><target>inverted yield curve</target><trail>s</trail></link>, even below the short-term rate. Many central banks have one primary &quot;headline&quot; rate that is quoted as the &quot;central bank rate&quot;. In practice, they will have other tools and rates that are used, but only one that is rigorously targeted and enforced.</paragraph><paragraph>&quot;The rate at which the central bank lends money can indeed be chosen at will by the central bank; this is the rate that makes the financial headlines.&quot; Henry C.K.

The rate that is used to purchase local currency may be market-based or arbitrarily set by the bank. This tool is generally used in countries with non-convertible currencies or partially convertible currencies. The recipient of the local currency may be allowed to freely dispose of the funds, required to hold the funds with the central bank for some period of time, or allowed to use the funds subject to certain restrictions. In other cases, the ability to hold or use the foreign exchange may be otherwise limited.</paragraph><paragraph>In this method, money supply is increased by the central bank when it purchases the foreign currency by issuing (selling) the local currency. The central bank may subsequently reduce the money supply by various means, including selling bonds or foreign exchange interventions.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Margin requirements and other tools</heading><paragraph>In some countries, central banks may have other tools that work indirectly to limit lending practices and otherwise restrict or regulate capital markets. For example, a central bank may regulate<space/><link><target>margin lending</target></link>, whereby individuals or companies may borrow against pledged securities. The margin requirement establishes a minimum ratio of the value of the securities to the amount borrowed.</paragraph><paragraph>Central banks often have requirements for the quality of assets that may be held by financial institutions; these requirements may act as a limit on the amount of risk and leverage created by the financial system. These requirements may be direct, such as requiring certain assets to bear certain minimum<space/><link><target>credit rating</target><trail>s</trail></link>, or indirect, by the central bank lending to counterparties only when security of a certain quality is pledged as<space/><link><target>collateral (finance)</target><part>collateral</part></link>.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Limits on policy effects</heading><paragraph>Although the perception by the public may be that the &quot;central bank&quot; controls some or all interest rates and currency rates, economic theory (and substantial empirical evidence) shows that it is impossible to do both at once in an open economy.<space/><link><target>Robert Mundell</target></link>'s &quot;<link><target>impossible trinity</target></link>&quot; is the most famous formulation of these limited powers, and postulates that it is impossible to target monetary policy (broadly, interest rates), the exchange rate (through a fixed rate) and maintain free capital movement. Since most Western economies are now considered &quot;open&quot; with free capital movement, this essentially means that central banks may target interest rates or exchange rates with credibility, but not both at once.</paragraph><paragraph>In the most famous case of policy failure,<space/><link><target>Black Wednesday</target></link>,<space/><link><target>George Soros</target></link><space/>arbitraged the<space/><link><target>pound sterling</target></link>'s relationship to the<space/><link><target>European Currency Unit</target><part>ECU</part></link><space/>and (after making $2 billion himself and forcing the UK to spend over $8bn defending the pound) forced it to abandon its policy.
