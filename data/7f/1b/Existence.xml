Arnauld thought that a<space/><link><target>proposition</target></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>Decision making</target><part>judgment</part></link><space/>consists of taking two different ideas and either putting them together or rejecting them:</paragraph><paragraph><template><target>quote</target><arg name="text">After conceiving things by our ideas, we compare these ideas and, finding that some belong together and others do not, we unite or separate them. This is called affirming or denying, and in general judging.

This judgment is also called a proposition, and it is easy to see that it must have two terms. One term, of which one affirms or denies something, is called the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]]; the other term, which is affirmed or denied, is called the attribute or [[predicate (logic)|Praedicatum]].</arg><arg name="sign">Antoine Arnauld</arg><arg name="source">''The Art of Thinking'' (''[[Port-Royal Logic]]''),(1662) (translated J. Buroker 1996), Logic, II.3, page 82</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>The two terms are joined by the verb &quot;is&quot; (or &quot;is not&quot;, if the predicate is denied of the subject). Thus every proposition has three components: the two terms, and the &quot;<link><target>Copula (linguistics)</target><part>copula</part></link>&quot; that connects or separates them. Even when the proposition has only two words, the three terms are still there. For example, &quot;God loves humanity&quot;, really means &quot;God is a lover of humanity&quot;, &quot;God exists&quot; means &quot;God is a thing&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>This theory of judgment dominated logic for centuries, but it has some obvious difficulties: it only considers proposition of the form &quot;All A are B.&quot;, a form logicians call<space/><link><target>universal quantifier</target><part>universal</part></link>. It does not allow propositions of the form &quot;Some A are B&quot;, a form logicians call<space/><link><target>existential quantifier</target><part>existential</part></link>. If neither A nor B includes the idea of existence, then &quot;some A are B&quot; simply adjoins A to B. Conversely, if A or B do include the idea of existence in the way that &quot;triangle&quot; contains the idea &quot;three angles equal to two right angles&quot;, then &quot;A exists&quot; is automatically true, and we have an<space/><link><target>ontological proof</target></link><space/>of A's existence. (Indeed, Arnauld's contemporary<space/><link><target>Descartes</target></link><space/>famously argued so, regarding the concept &quot;God&quot; (discourse 4, Meditation 5)). Arnauld's theory was current until the middle of the nineteenth century.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>David Hume</target></link><space/>argued that the claim that a thing exists, when added to our notion of a thing, does not add anything to the concept. For example, if we form a complete notion of Moses, and superadd to that notion the claim that Moses existed, we are not adding anything to the notion of Moses.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Immanuel Kant</target><part>Kant</part></link><space/>also argued that existence is not a &quot;real&quot; predicate, but gave no explanation of how this is possible. Indeed, his famous discussion of the subject is merely a restatement of Arnauld's doctrine that in the proposition &quot;God is omnipotent&quot;, the verb &quot;is&quot; signifies the joining or separating of two concepts such as &quot;God&quot; and &quot;omnipotence&quot;.<template><target>Or</target><arg name="date">January 2010</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Arthur Schopenhauer</target><part>Schopenhauer</part></link><space/>claimed that everything that exists for knowledge, and hence the whole of this world, is only object in relation to the subject, perception of the perceiver, in a word, representation.<extension extension_name='ref'><italics>The World as Will and Representation</italics>, vol.

Brentano argued that we can join the concept represented by a noun phrase &quot;an A&quot; to the concept represented by an adjective &quot;B&quot; to give the concept represented by the noun phrase &quot;a B-A&quot;. For example, we can join &quot;a man&quot; to &quot;wise&quot; to give &quot;a wise man&quot;. But the noun phrase &quot;a wise man&quot; is not a sentence, whereas &quot;some man is wise&quot; is a sentence. Hence the copula must do more than merely join or separate concepts. Furthermore, adding &quot;exists&quot; to &quot;a wise man&quot;, to give the complete sentence &quot;a wise man exists&quot; has the same effect as joining &quot;some man&quot; to &quot;wise&quot; using the copula. So the copula has the same effect as &quot;exists&quot;. Brentano argued that every categorical proposition can be translated into an existential one without change in meaning and that the &quot;exists&quot; and &quot;does not exist&quot; of the existential proposition take the place of the copula. He showed this by the following examples:</paragraph><list type='ident'><listitem>The categorical proposition &quot;Some man is sick&quot; has the same meaning as the existential proposition &quot;A sick man exists&quot; or &quot;There is a sick man&quot;.</listitem></list><list type='ident'><listitem>The categorical proposition &quot;No stone is living&quot; has the same meaning as the existential proposition &quot;A living stone does not exist&quot; or &quot;there is no living stone&quot;.</listitem></list><list type='ident'><listitem>The categorical proposition &quot;All men are mortal&quot; has the same meaning as the existential proposition &quot;An immortal man does not exist&quot; or &quot;there is no immortal man&quot;.</listitem></list><list type='ident'><listitem>The categorical proposition &quot;Some man is not learned&quot; has the same meaning as the existential proposition &quot;A non-learned man exists&quot; or &quot;there is a non-learned man&quot;.</listitem></list><paragraph>Frege developed a similar view (though later) in his great work<space/><italics><link><target>The Foundations of Arithmetic</target></link></italics>, as did<space/><link><target>Charles Sanders Peirce</target></link><space/>(but Peirce held that<space/><link><target>Charles Sanders Peirce#Philosophy: metaphysics</target><part>the possible and the real are not limited to the actually, individually existent</part></link>). The Frege-Brentano view is the basis of the dominant position in<space/><link><target>Analytic philosophy</target><part>modern Anglo-American philosophy</part></link>: that existence is asserted by the existential quantifier (as expressed by<space/><link><target>Willard Van Orman Quine</target><part>Quine</part></link>'s slogan &quot;To be is to be the value of a variable.&quot;<space/><italics>On What There Is</italics>, 1948).<extension extension_name='ref'><italics>On What There Is</italics><space/>in Review of Metaphysics (1948).

The first of these quantifiers, &quot;some&quot;, is also expressed as &quot;there exists&quot;. Thus, in the sentence &quot;There exists a man&quot;, the term &quot;man&quot; is asserted to be part of existence. But we can also assert, &quot;There exists a triangle.&quot; Is a &quot;triangle&quot; an abstract idea part of existence in the same way that a &quot;man&quot; a physical body is part of existence? Do abstractions such as goodness, blindness, and virtue exist in the same sense that chairs, tables, and houses exist?

The statement &quot;A bridge crosses the Thames at Hammersmith&quot; cannot just be about a bridge, the Thames, and Hammersmith. It must be about &quot;existence&quot; as well. On the other hand, the statement &quot;A bridge crosses the Styx at Limbo&quot; has the same form, but while in the first case we understand a real bridge in the real world made of stone or brick, what &quot;existence&quot; would mean in the second case is less clear.</paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>nominalist</target></link><space/>approach is to argue that certain noun phrases can be &quot;eliminated&quot; by rewriting a sentence in a form that has the same meaning, but does not contain the noun phrase. Thus<space/><link><target>William of Ockham</target><part>Ockham</part></link><space/>argued that &quot;Socrates has wisdom&quot;, which apparently asserts the existence of a reference for &quot;wisdom&quot;, can be rewritten as &quot;Socrates is wise&quot;, which contains only the referring phrase &quot;Socrates&quot;. This method became widely accepted in the twentieth century by the<space/><link><target>Analytic philosophy</target><part>analytic school</part></link><space/>of philosophy.</paragraph><paragraph>However, this argument may be inverted by<space/><link><target>Philosophical realism</target><part>realists</part></link><space/>in arguing that since the sentence &quot;Socrates is wise&quot; can be rewritten as &quot;Socrates has wisdom&quot;, this proves the existence of a hidden referent for &quot;wise&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>A further problem is that human beings seem to process information about<space/><link><target>Character (arts)</target><part>fictional characters</part></link><space/>in much the same way that they process information about real people.

But in the layperson's<space/><link><target>worldview</target></link>, existence includes real, fictional, and even contradictory objects. Thus if we reason from the statement &quot;<link><target>Pegasus</target></link><space/>flies&quot; to the statement &quot;Pegasus exists&quot;, we are not asserting that Pegasus is made up of atoms, but rather that Pegasus exists in a particular worldview, the worldview of classical myth. When a mathematician reasons from the statement &quot;ABC is a triangle&quot; to the statement &quot;triangles exist&quot;, she is not asserting that triangles are made up of atoms but rather that triangles exist within a particular<space/><link><target>mathematical model</target></link>.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Modern approaches</heading><paragraph>According to<space/><link><target>Bertrand Russell</target></link>'s<space/><link><target>Theory of Descriptions</target></link>, the negation operator in a singular sentence can take either wide or narrow scope: we distinguish between &quot;some S is not P&quot; (where negation takes &quot;narrow scope&quot;) and &quot;it is not the case that 'some S is P'&quot; (where negation takes &quot;wide scope&quot;). The problem with this view is that there appears to be no such scope distinction in the case of proper names. The sentences &quot;Socrates is not bald&quot; and &quot;it is not the case that Socrates is bald&quot; both appear to have the same meaning, and they both appear to assert or presuppose the existence of someone (Socrates) who is not bald, so that negation takes narrow scope. However, Russell's theory analyses proper names into a logical structure which makes sense of this problem. According to Russell, Socrates can be analysed into the form 'The Philosopher of Greece.' In the wide scope this would then read: It is not the case that there existed a philosopher of Greece who was bald. In the narrow scope it would read the Philosopher of Greece was not bald.</paragraph><paragraph>According to the<space/><link><target>Direct reference</target><part>direct-reference</part></link><space/>view, an early version of which was originally proposed by<space/><link><target>Bertrand Russell</target></link>, and perhaps earlier by<space/><link><target>Gottlob Frege</target></link>, a proper name strictly has no meaning when there is no object to which it refers. This view relies on the argument that the semantic function of a proper name is to tell us<space/><italics>which</italics><space/>object bears the name, and thus to identify some object. But no object can be identified if none exists. Thus, a proper name must have a bearer if it is to be meaningful.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Existence in the wide and narrow senses</heading><paragraph>According to the &quot;two sense&quot; view of existence, which derives from<space/><link><target>Alexius Meinong</target></link>, existential statements fall into two classes.</paragraph><list type='numbered'><listitem>Those asserting existence in a<space/><italics>wide</italics><space/>sense.
