==Career==

===Early career===
[[File:President Reagan with Drew Barrymore at a ceremony launching the Young Astronauts program on the south lawn. October 17, 1984.jpg|thumb|upright|Barrymore with President [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]], October 17, 1984]]
Barrymore's career began when she was auditioned for a dog food commercial when she was 11 months old.<ref name="ActorsStudio" /> When she was bitten by her canine co-star, the producers were afraid she would cry, but she merely laughed, and was hired for the job.<ref name="ActorsStudio" /> She made her feature film debut in ''[[Altered States]]'' (1980), in which she had a small part.<ref name="Hello-Profile" /> A year later, she played Gertie, the younger sister of Elliott, in ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', which made her one of the most famous child stars of the time and earned her the [[Young Artist Award]] as [[4th Youth in Film Awards#Best Young Performer in a Feature Film|Best Young Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture]] in 1982.<ref name="ActorsStudio" /><ref name="Young Artist Awards 4">{{cite web|url=http://www.youngartistawards.org/pastnoms4.htm|title=4th Annual Youth in Film Awards|accessdate=March 31, 2011|work=YoungArtistAwards.org}}</ref> She received a [[Golden Globe]] nomination as [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress&nbsp;– Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture]] in 1984 for her role in ''[[Irreconcilable Differences]]'', in which she starred as a young girl divorcing her parents.<ref name="ActorsStudio" /><ref name="gg">{{cite web |title=HFPA&nbsp;– Awards Search |url=http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/member/28761 |accessdate=July 3, 2008 |publisher=Golden Globes}}</ref> In a review in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] stated: "Barrymore is the right actress for this role precisely because she approaches it with such grave calm."<ref>{{cite web |first=Roger |last=Ebert |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19840101/REVIEWS/401010349/1023 |title=Irreconciable Differences film review |accessdate=July 15, 2008 |date=January 1, 1984 |publisher=Roger Ebert.com |work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref>

===Rebellious era===
In the wake of this sudden stardom, Barrymore endured a notoriously troubled childhood. She was already a regular at the famed [[Studio 54]] when she was a little girl, smoking cigarettes at the age of nine, drinking alcohol by the time she was eleven, smoking [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] at the age of twelve and snorting [[cocaine]] at the age of thirteen.<ref name="Hello-Profile" /><ref name="ActorsStudio" /> Her nightlife and constant partying became a popular subject with the media.<ref name="Hello-Profile" /> She was in rehab at the age of fourteen,<ref name="Hello-Profile" /><ref name="ActorsStudio" /> where she spent eighteen months in an institution for the mentally ill.<ref name=GuardianBoohoo>{{cite web |url= http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/oct/25/drew-barrymore-mother-locked-up-in-institution-interview |title=Drew Barrymore: ‘My mother locked me up in an institution at 13.

The following year, following a successful juvenile court petition for [[Emancipation of minors|emancipation]], she moved into her own apartment.<ref name="People-Bio" />
