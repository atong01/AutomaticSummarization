The '''''Tao Te Ching''''',<ref>{{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aʊ|_|d|ɛ|_|ˈ|dʒ|ɪ|ŋ}} — [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tao+te+ching "Tao Te Ching"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.</ref> '''''Daodejing''''',  '''''Dao De Jing''''', or Daode jing ({{zh|s={{linktext|道|德|经}}|t={{linktext|道|德|經}}|hp=Dàodéjīng|l=}}), also simply referred to as the '''''Laozi''''' ({{zh|c=老子|hp=Lǎozǐ}}),<ref name="stanford" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/23974 |title=The Tao Teh King, or the Tao and its Characteristics by Laozi – Project Gutenberg |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=2007-12-01 |accessdate=2010-08-13}}</ref> is a [[Chinese classic text]]. According to tradition, it was written around 6th century BC by the sage [[Laozi]] (or Lao Tzu, {{zh|c=老子|hp=Lǎozǐ}}, literally meaning "Old Master"), a record-keeper at the [[Zhou dynasty]] court, by whose name the text is known in China. The text's true authorship and date of composition or compilation are still debated,<ref>Eliade (1984), p.26</ref> although the oldest excavated text dates back to the late 4th century BC.<ref name="stanford" />

The ''Tao Te Ching'', along with the ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'', is a fundamental text for both philosophical and religious [[Taoism]], and strongly influenced other schools, such as [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], [[Confucianism]], and [[Chinese Buddhism]], which when first introduced into China was largely interpreted through the use of Daoist words and concepts. Many Chinese artists, including [[Chinese poetry|poets]], [[Chinese painting|painters]], [[calligraphy|calligraphers]], and even [[Chinese garden|gardeners]], have used the ''Daodejing'' as a source of inspiration. Its influence has also spread widely outside East Asia, and is among the most translated works in world literature.<ref name=stanford>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/laozi/|title=Laozi|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] by [[Stanford University]]}}</ref>

The [[Wade–Giles]] [[romanization]] "''Tao Te Ching''" dates back to early English transliterations in the late 19th century; its influence can be seen in words and phrases that have become well established in English. "''Daodejing''" is the [[pinyin]] romanization.

==Text==
The ''Tao Te Ching'' has a long and complex textual history. On one hand, there are transmitted versions and commentaries that date back two millennia; on the other, there are ancient bamboo, silk, and paper manuscripts that archeologists discovered in the last century.

===Title===
There are many possible translations of the book's title:

''[[Tao|Dào/tao]]'' literally means "way", or one of its synonyms, but was extended to mean "the Way." This term, which was variously used by other Chinese philosophers (including [[Confucius]], [[Mencius]], [[Mozi]], and [[Hanfeizi]]), has special meaning within the context of Taoism, where it implies the essential, unnamable process of the universe.

''[[De (Chinese)|Dé/te]]'' means "virtue", "personal character," "inner strength" (virtuosity), or "integrity." The semantics of this Chinese word resemble English ''virtue,'' which developed from ''[[virtù]]'', a now-archaic sense of "inner potency" or "divine power" (as in "healing virtue of a drug") to the modern meaning of "moral excellence" or "goodness." Compare the [[compound word]] ''taote'' ({{zh|c=道德|hp=Dàodé|links=no}}; literally: "ethics", "ethical principles," "morals," or "morality").

''Jīng/ching'' as it is used here means "canon," "great book," or "classic."

Thus, ''Tao Te Ching'' can be translated as "The Classic of the Virtuous Way."

The title '''''Daodejing''''' is an honorific given by posterity, other titles include the amalgam ''Lǎozǐ Dàodéjīng'' ({{lang|zh-hans|老子道德經}}), the honorific ''Daode Zhen Jing'' ({{lang|zh-hans|道德真經}} "True Classic of the Way and the Power"), and the ''Wuqian wen'' ({{lang|zh-hans|五千文}} "Five thousand character [classic]").

===Internal structure===
The received ''Tao Te Ching'' is a short text of around 5,000 [[Chinese characters]] in 81 brief chapters or sections ({{lang|zh|章}}). There is some evidence that the chapter divisions were later additions–for commentary, or as aids to rote memorization–and that the original text was more fluidly organized. It has two parts, the ''Tao Ching'' (道經; chaps. 1–37) and the ''Te Ching'' (德經; chaps. 38–81), which may have been edited together into the received text, possibly reversed from an original "Te Tao Ching." The written style is laconic, has few [[grammatical particle]]s, and encourages varied, even contradictory interpretations.  The ideas are singular; the style poetic. The rhetorical style combines two major strategies: short, declarative statements and intentional contradictions. The first of these strategies creates memorable phrases, while the second forces us to create our own reconciliations of the supposed contradictions.<ref>Austin, Michael (2010). "Reading the World: Ideas that Matter", p. 158. W. W. Norton & Company, New York. ISBN 978-0-393-93349-9.</ref>

The Chinese characters in the original versions were probably written in ''zhuànshū'' ({{linktext|篆|書}} [[seal script]]), while later versions were written in ''lìshū'' ({{linktext|隸|書}} [[clerical script]]) and ''kǎishū'' ({{linktext|楷|書}} [[regular script]]) styles.  [http://www.edepot.com/taocalig.html Daoist Chinese Characters] contains a good summary of these different calligraphies.

===Historical authenticity of the author===
The ''Tao Te Ching'' is ascribed to [[Laozi]], whose historical existence has been a matter of scholastic debate. His name, which means "Old Master", has only fueled controversy on this issue. (Kaltenmark 1969:10).
[[File:Laozi.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Laozi]]]]
The first reliable reference to Laozi is his "biography" in ''[[Shiji]]'' (63, tr. Chan 1963:35–37), by Chinese historian [[Sima Qian]] (ca. 145–86 BC), which combines three stories. First, Laozi was a contemporary of [[Confucius]] (551–479 BC). His surname was Li ({{lang|zh|李}} "plum"), and his personal name was Er ({{lang|zh|耳}} "ear") or Dan ({{lang|zh|聃}} "long ear"). He was an official in the imperial archives, and wrote a book in two parts before departing to the West. Second, Laozi was Lao Laizi ({{lang|zh|老來子}} "Old Come Master"), also a contemporary of Confucius, who wrote a book in 15 parts. Third, Laozi was the Grand Historian and astrologer Lao Dan ({{lang|zh|老聃}} "Old Long-ears"), who lived during the reign (384–362 BC) of Duke Xian (獻公) of [[Qin (state)|Qin)]].

Generations of scholars have debated the historicity of Laozi and the dating of the ''Tao Te Ching.'' Linguistic studies of the text's vocabulary and [[rhyme]] scheme point to a date of composition after the ''[[Shi Jing]]'' yet before the ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]''. Legends claim variously that Laozi was "born old"; that he lived for 996 years, with twelve previous incarnations starting around the time of the Three Sovereigns before the thirteenth as Laozi. Some Western scholars have expressed doubts over Laozi's historical existence, claiming that the ''Tao Te Ching'' is actually a collection of the work of various authors.

Many Taoists venerate Laozi as ''Daotsu'' the founder of the school of Dao, the ''Daode Tianjun'' in the [[Three Pure Ones]], one of the eight elders transformed from [[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]] in the [[Chinese creation myth]].

===Principal versions===
Among the many transmitted editions of the ''Tao Te Ching'' text, the three primary ones are named after early commentaries. The "Yan Zun Version," which is only extant for the ''Te Ching'', derives from a commentary attributed to [[Han Dynasty]] scholar Yan Zun (巖尊, fl. 80 BC-10 AD). The "Heshang Gong Version" is named after the legendary Heshang Gong ({{lang|zh|河上公}} "Riverside Sage") who supposedly lived during the reign (202–157 BC) of [[Emperor Wen of Han]]. This commentary (tr. Erkes 1950) has a preface written by [[Ge Xuan]] ({{lang|zh|葛玄}}, 164–244 AD), granduncle of [[Ge Hong]], and scholarship dates this version to around the 3rd century AD. The "Wang Bi Version" has more verifiable origins than either of the above. [[Wang Bi]] ({{lang|zh|王弼}}, 226–249 AD) was a famous [[Three Kingdoms]] period philosopher and commentator on the ''Tao Te Ching'' (tr. Lin 1977, Rump and Chan 1979) and the ''[[I Ching]]''.

''Tao Te Ching'' scholarship has lately advanced from archeological discoveries of manuscripts, some of which are older than any of the received texts. Beginning in the 1920s and 1930s, [[Marc Aurel Stein]] and others found thousands of scrolls in the [[Mogao Caves]] near [[Dunhuang]]. They included more than 50 partial and complete "Tao Te Ching" manuscripts. One written by the scribe So/Su Dan (素統) is dated 270 AD and corresponds closely with the Heshang Gong version. Another partial manuscript has the Xiang'er (想爾) commentary, which had previously been lost.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

===Mawangdui and Guodian texts===
In 1973, archeologists discovered copies of early Chinese books, known as the [[Mawangdui Silk Texts]], in a tomb dating from 168 BC.<ref name=stanford/>  They included two nearly complete copies of the text, referred to as Text A ({{lang|zh|甲}}) and Text B ({{lang|zh|乙}}), both of which reverse the traditional ordering and put the ''Te Ching'' section before the ''Tao Ching,'' which is why the Henricks translation of them is named "Te-Tao Ching". Based on calligraphic styles and imperial [[naming taboo]] avoidances, scholars believe that Text A can be dated to about the first decade and Text B to about the third decade of the 2nd century BC.<ref>Boltz (1993): 284</ref>

In 1993, the oldest known version of the text, written on bamboo tablets, was found in a tomb near the town of Guodian ({{lang|zh|郭店}}) in [[Jingmen]], [[Hubei]], and dated prior to 300 BC.<ref name=stanford/> The [[Guodian Chu Slips]] comprise about 800 slips of bamboo with a total of over 13,000 characters, about 2,000 of which correspond with the ''Tao Te Ching'', including 14 previously unknown verses.

Both the Mawangdui and Guodian versions are generally consistent with the received texts, excepting differences in chapter sequence and graphic variants. Several recent ''Tao Te Ching'' translations (e.g., Lau 1989, Henricks 1989, Mair 1990, Henricks 2000, Allan and Williams 2000, and Roberts 2004) utilize these two versions, sometimes with the verses reordered to synthesize the new finds.

===Written style===
The ''Tao Te Ching'' was originally written in [[Seal script|zhuànshū]] calligraphy style.  It is difficult to obtain modern replicas of these styles except through specialty stores. Most modern versions use the newspaper print style [[Regular script|kǎishū]].

==Interpretation and themes==
The passages are ambiguous, and topics range from political advice for rulers to practical wisdom for people.  Because the variety of interpretation is virtually limitless, not only for different people but for the same person over time, readers do well to avoid making claims of objectivity or superiority. Also, since the book is 81 short poems, there is little need for an abridgement.

===Ineffability of genesis===
:The Way that can be told of is not an unvarying way;
:The names that can be named are not unvarying names.
:It was from the Nameless that Heaven and Earth sprang;
:The named is but the mother that rears the ten thousand creatures, each after its kind. (chap. 1, tr. Waley)

These famous first lines of the ''Tao Te Ching'' state that the Tao is [[ineffability|ineffable]], i.e., the Tao is nameless, goes beyond distinctions, and transcends language. However this first verse does not occur in the earliest known version from the [[Guodian Chu Slips]] and there is speculation that it may have been added by later commentators.<ref>Henricks (2000) Lao Tzu's Tao Teh Ching–A translation of the startling new documents found at Guodian, page 3</ref>  In Laozi's [[Qingjing Jing]] (verse 1-8) he clarified the term Tao was nominated as he was trying to describe a state of existence before it happened and before time or space. ''Way'' or ''path'' happened to be the side meaning of Tao, ineffability would be just poetic.  This is the [[Chinese creation myth]] from the primordial Tao.

===Mysterious female===
: The Valley Spirit never dies
: It is named the Mysterious Female.
: And the doorway of the Mysterious Female
: Is the base from which Heaven and Earth sprang.
: It is there within us all the while;
: Draw upon it as you will; it never runs dry. (chap. 6, tr. Waley)

Like the above description of the ineffable Tao as "the mother that rears the ten thousand creatures", the ''Tao Te Ching'' advocates "female" (or ''[[Yin-Yang|Yin]]'') values, emphasizing the passive, solid, and quiescent qualities of nature (which is opposed to the active and energetic), and "having without possessing". Waley's translation can also be understood as the ''Esoteric Feminine'' in that it can be known intuitively, that must be complemented by the masculine, "male" (or ''Yang''), again amplified in [[Qingjing Jing]] (verse 9-13). Yin and Yang should be balanced, "Know masculinity, Maintain femininity, and be a ravine for all under heaven." (chap. 28, tr. Mair)

===Returning (union with the Primordial)===
: In Tao the only motion is returning.
: The only useful quality, weakness.
: For though all creatures under heaven are the products of Being,
: Being itself is the product of Not-being. " (chap. 40, tr. Waley)
Another theme is the [[eternal return]], or what Mair (1990:139) calls "the continual return of the myriad creatures to the cosmic principle from which they arose."

There is a contrast between the rigidity of death and the weakness of life: "When he is born, man is soft and weak; in death he becomes stiff and hard. The ten thousand creatures and all plants and trees while they are alive are supple and soft, but when dead they become brittle and dry." (chap. 76, tr. Waley).
This is returning to the beginning of things, or to one's own childhood.

The ''Tao Te Ching'' focuses upon the beginnings of society, and describes a golden age in the past, comparable with the ideas of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. Human problems arose from the "invention" of culture and civilization. In this idealized past, "the people should have no use for any form of writing save knotted ropes, should be contented with their food, pleased with their clothing, satisfied with their homes, should take pleasure in their rustic tasks." (chap. 80, tr. Waley)

===Emptiness===
: We put thirty spokes together and call it a wheel;
: But it is on the space where there is nothing that the usefulness of the wheel depends.
: We turn clay to make a vessel;
: But it is on the space where there is nothing that the usefulness of the vessel depends.
: We pierce doors and windows to make a house;
: And it is on these spaces where there is nothing that the usefulness of the house depends.
: Therefore just as we take advantage of what is, we should recognize the usefulness of what is not. (chap. 11, tr. Waley)

Philosophical vacuity is a common theme among Asian philosophical traditions including Taoism (especially ''[[Wu wei]]'' "effortless action"), [[Buddhism]], and some aspects of [[Confucianism]]. One could interpret the ''Tao Te Ching'' as a suite of variations on the "Powers of Nothingness". This predates the Buddhist [[Shunyata]] philosophy of "form is emptiness, emptiness is form" by half a millennium.

Looking at a traditional Chinese [[landscape art|Landscape]], one can understand how emptiness (the unpainted) has the power of animating the trees, mountains, and rivers it surrounds. Emptiness can mean having no fixed preconceptions, preferences, intentions, or agenda. Since "The Sage has no heart of his own;
He uses the heart of the people as his heart." (chap. 49, tr. Waley). From a ruler's point of view, it is a ''[[laissez-faire]]'' approach:
: So a wise leader may say:
: "I practice inaction, and the people look after themselves."
: But from the Sage it is so hard at any price to get a single word
: That when his task is accomplished, his work done,
: Throughout the country every one says: "It happened of its own accord". (chap. 17, tr. Waley)

===Knowledge and humility===
: Knowing others is wisdom;
: Knowing the self is enlightenment.
: Mastering others requires force;
: Mastering the self requires strength;
: He who knows he has enough is rich.
: Perseverance is a sign of will power.
: He who stays where he is endures.
: To die but not to perish is to be eternally present. (chap. 33, tr. Feng and English)

The ''Tao Te Ching'' praises self-gained knowledge with emphasis on that knowledge being gained with humility. When what one person has experienced is put into words and transmitted to others, so doing risks giving unwarranted status to what inevitably must have had a subjective tinge. Moreover, it will be subjected to another layer of interpretation and subjectivity when read and learned by others. This kind of knowledge (or "book learning"), like desire, should be diminished. "It was when intelligence and knowledge appeared that the Great Artifice began." (chap. 18, tr. Waley) And so, "The pursuit of learning is to increase day after day. The pursuit of Tao is to decrease the doing of the self day after day." (chap. 48, tr. W. T. Chan)

===Interpretations in relation to religious traditions===
The relation between Taoism and [[Buddhism]] and [[Chan Buddhism]] is complex and fertile. Similarly, the relationship between Taoism and [[Confucianism]] is richly interwoven, historically.

==Translations==
The ''Tao Te Ching'' has been translated into Western languages over 250 times, mostly to English, German, and French.<ref>LaFargue, Michael and Pas, Julian. ''On Translating the Tao-te-ching'' in Kohn and LaFargue (1998), p. 277</ref> According to Holmes Welch, "It is a famous puzzle which everyone would like to feel he had solved."<ref>Welch (1965), p. 7</ref>

Many translations are written by people with a foundation in Chinese language and philosophy who are trying to render the original meaning of the text as faithfully as possible into English. Some of the more popular translations are written from a less scholarly perspective, giving an individual author's interpretation. Critics of these versions, such as Taoism scholar Eugene Eoyang, claim that translators like [[Stephen Mitchell (translator)|Stephen Mitchell]] (who states explicitly that his version is not a translation) produce readings of the ''Tao Te Ching'' that deviate from the text and are incompatible with the history of Chinese thought.<ref>[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0022-4189(199007)70%3A3%3C492%3ATTCANE%3E2.0.CO%3B2-7 ''The Journal of Religion'']</ref> Russell Kirkland goes further to argue that these versions are based on Western [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] fantasies, and represent the colonial appropriation of Chinese culture.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kirkland.myweb.uga.edu/rk/pdf/pubs/pres/TENN97.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102000401/http://kirkland.myweb.uga.edu/rk/pdf/pubs/pres/TENN97.pdf |archivedate=2007-01-02 |title=THE TAOISM OF THE WESTERN IMAGINATION AND THE TAOISM OF CHINA: DE-COLONIALIZING THE EXOTIC TEACHINGS OF THE EAST}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415263220&id=Gg0XCJcGDhYC&pg=PP1&lpg=PP1&ots=uBvR0I0__a&dq=Norman+J.+Girardot,+Russell+Kirkland,+%22Taoism,+the+Enduring+Tradition%22&sig=LdcJi2o--1_6e0TpafQjIaWa9_o#PPA218,M1 |title=Taoism: the enduring tradition – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-13}}</ref> In contrast, [[Huston Smith]], scholar of world religions, said of the Mitchell version, "This translation comes as close to being definitive for our time as any I can imagine. It embodies the virtues its translator credits to the Chinese original: a gemlike lucidity that is radiant with humor, grace, largeheartedness, and deep wisdom." Other Taoism scholars, such as Michael LaFargue<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0791436004&id=9Td7s_urErUC&pg=PP1&lpg=PP1&ots=ENwZI7oEjr&dq=&sig=e6D1T_Ls3owaWMd8sSdqmgN4t8s#PPP1,M1 ]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref> and Jonathan Herman,<ref>[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-7189(199823)66%3A3%3C686%3ATTCABA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-4 ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'']</ref> argue that while they don't pretend to scholarship, they meet a real spiritual need in the West. These Westernized versions aim to make the wisdom of the Tao Te Ching more accessible to modern English-speaking readers by, typically, employing more familiar cultural and temporal references.

===Translational difficulties===
The ''Tao Te Ching'' is written in [[Classical Chinese]], which can be difficult to understand completely.  Classical Chinese relies heavily on [[allusion]] to a [[Text corpus|corpus]] of standard literary works to convey [[semantic]] meaning, nuance, and [[subtext]]. This corpus was memorized by highly educated people in Laozi's time, and the allusions were reinforced through common use in writing, but few people today have this type of deep acquaintance with ancient Chinese literature. Thus, many levels of subtext are potentially lost on modern translators. Furthermore, many of the words that the ''Tao Te Ching'' uses are deliberately vague and ambiguous.

Since there are no [[punctuation marks]] in Classical Chinese, it can be difficult to conclusively determine where one sentence ends and the next begins. Moving a full-stop a few words forward or back or inserting a comma can profoundly alter the meaning of many passages, and such divisions and meanings must be determined by the translator. Some editors and translators argue that the received text is so corrupted (from originally being written on one-line bamboo strips linked with silk threads) that it is impossible to understand some chapters without moving sequences of characters from one place to another.
