'''Charles Proteus Steinmetz''' (April 9, 1865&nbsp;– October 26, 1923) was a German-born American [[mathematician]] and [[Electrical engineering|electrical engineer]]. He fostered the development of [[alternating current]] that made possible the expansion of the [[electric power industry]] in the United States, formulating mathematical theories for engineers. He made ground-breaking discoveries in the understanding of [[hysteresis]] that enabled engineers to design better [[electrical machine|electromagnetic apparatus equipment]] including especially [[induction motor|electric motor]]s for use in industry.<ref>{{cite conference|url=http://invent.org/inductee-detail/?IID=139|website=Invent Now, Inc.

==Early life==
[[File:Steinmetz Cabin.jpg|thumb|Steinmetz maintained a small cabin overlooking the [[Mohawk River]] near [[Schenectady, New York]].]]
Steinmetz was born '''Karl August Rudolph Steinmetz''' on April 9, 1865 in [[Wrocław|Breslau]], [[Province of Silesia]], the son of Caroline (Neubert) and Karl Heinrich Steinmetz.<ref name="Clemens (2011)">{{cite book|last=Clemens|first=Nora|title=Discovering the Nature of Energy|publisher=Rosen Publishing Group.|url=http://www.amazon.com/Discovering-Nature-Energy-Scientists-Physics/dp/1448847028|location=New York|isbn=978-1448847020|page=78|edition=1st|author2=Greenberger, Robert}}</ref> He was baptized a Lutheran, the religion his family "nominally" belonged to.<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=HvtCAAAAIAAJ&q=%22Steinmetz+was+christened+Karl+August+Rudolph+and+confirmed+in+the+Lutheran+Church.%22&dq=%22Steinmetz+was+christened+Karl+August+Rudolph+and+confirmed+in+the+Lutheran+Church.%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=eUNlVYXTMLDhsAS6-YG4AQ&ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA Charles P.

Steinmetz attended Johannes [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] and astonished his teachers with his proficiency in [[mathematics]] and [[physics]].

Following the Gymnasium, Steinmetz went on to the [[University of Wrocław|University of Breslau]] to begin work on his undergraduate degree in 1883. He was on the verge of finishing his doctorate in 1888 when he came under investigation by the German police for activities on behalf of a [[Socialism|socialist]] university group and articles he had written for a local socialist newspaper.

==Socialism and technocracy==
As socialist meetings and press had been banned in Germany, Steinmetz fled to [[Zürich]] in 1888 to escape possible arrest.  Faced with an expiring visa, he emigrated to the United States in 1889. He changed his first name to "Charles" in order to sound more American, and chose the middle name "[[Proteus]]" after a childhood epithet given to him by classmates. Proteus was a wise hunchbacked character from the ''[[Odyssey]]'' who knew many secrets, and Steinmetz felt the name suited him.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

[[Cornell University]] Professor Ronald R. Kline, the author of ''Steinmetz: Engineer and Socialist'', contended that other factors were more directly involved in Steinmetz's decision to leave his homeland, such as the fact that he was in arrears with his tuition at the University of Breslau and that life at home with his father, stepmother, and their daughters was full of tension.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Despite his earlier efforts and interest in socialism, by 1922 Steinmetz concluded that socialism would never work in the United States, because the country lacked a "powerful, centralized government of competent men, remaining continuously in office", and because "only a small percentage of Americans accept this viewpoint today".<ref name="UC Mag (1998)">{{cite journal|title=Charles Steinmetz: Union's Electrical Wizard|journal=Union College Magazine|date=November 1, 1998|url=http://www.union.edu/N/DS/s.php?s=1512|accessdate=May 31, 2009}}{{dead link|date=June 2015}}</ref>

A member of the original [[Technical Alliance]], which also included [[Thorstein Veblen]] and [[Leland Olds]], Steinmetz had great faith in the ability of machines to eliminate human toil and create abundance for all. He put it this way: "Some day we make the good things of life for everybody".

==Engineering wizard==
[[File:Charles Proteus Steinmetz.jpg|thumb|upright|Steinmetz circa 1915]]
Steinmetz is known for his contribution in three major fields of [[alternating current|alternating current (AC)]] systems theory: [[magnetic hysteresis|hysteresis]], [[steady state (electronics)|steady-state]] analysis, and [[transient (oscillation)|transients]].

===AC hysteresis theory===
Shortly after arriving in the United States, Steinmetz went to work for Rudolf Eickemeyer in [[Yonkers, New York]], and published in the field of magnetic hysteresis, which gave him world-wide professional recognition.<ref name="IEEEPER (1996)">{{cite journal|title=The Magnetic Force of Charles Proteus Steinmetz |journal=IEEE Power Engineering Review |date=Feb 1996 |volume=16 |issue=9 |page=7 |doi=10.1109/MPER.1996.535476 |accessdate=7 February 2013 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=535476&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines&queryText%3DCharles+Proteus+Steinmetz+history |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20140525213406/http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=535476&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines&queryText%3DCharles+Proteus+Steinmetz+history |archivedate=25 May 2014 }}</ref>  Eickemeyer's firm developed [[transformer]]s for use in the [[electric power transmission|transmission of electrical power]] among many other mechanical and electrical devices. In 1893 Eickemeyer's company, along with all of its patents and designs, was bought by the newly formed [[General Electric]] Company, where he quickly became known as the engineering wizard in GE's engineering community.<ref name="IEEEPER (1996)"/>
 
===AC steady state circuit theory===
Steinmetz's work revolutionized [[Alternating current|AC]] [[Network analysis (electrical circuits)|circuit theory and analysis]], which had been carried out using complex, time-consuming [[calculus]]-based methods. In the groundbreaking paper, "Complex Quantities and Their Use in Electrical Engineering", presented at a July 1893 meeting published in the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers|American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE)]], Steinmetz simplified these complicated methods to "a simple problem of algebra". He systematized the use of [[complex number]] [[phasor]] representation in electrical engineering education texts, whereby the [[lower-case letter]] "j" is used to designate the 90-degree [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]] operator in AC system analysis.<ref name="Alger (1976)"/><ref name="Bedell (1942)">{{cite journal|last1=Bedell|first1=Frederick|title=History of A-C Wave Form, Its Determination and Standardization|journal=Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers|volume=61|issue=12|page=p. 865|doi=10.1109/T-AIEE.1942.5058456}}</ref> His seminal books and many other AIEE papers "taught a whole generation of engineers how to deal with AC phenomena".<ref name="Alger (1976)"/><ref name="ZSE (nodate)">{{cite web|title=Steinmetz, Putting it in Perspective - R, L, and C Elements and the Impedance Concept|url=http://zrno.fsb.hr/katedra/download/materijali/966.pdf|publisher=Zabreb School of Engineering|accessdate=21 December 2012}}</ref>

===AC transient theory===
Steinmetz also made greater strides to the understanding of [[lightning]] phenomena.  He undertook a systematic study of it, resulting in experiments with "man-made lightning" in the laboratory; this work was published.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} Steinmetz was called the "forger of [[thunderbolt]]s", being the first to create artificial lightning in his football field-sized laboratory and high towers built at General Electric, using 120,000 [[voltage|volt]] generators. He erected a lightning tower to attract natural lightning, and studied the patterns and effects of lightning resulting in several theories and ideas.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Professional and personal aspects==
Steinmetz served as president of the [[Board of education|Board of Education]] of [[Schenectady, New York]], and as president of the Schenectady [[City council|City Council]]. He was president of the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers]] (AIEE) from 1901 to 1902,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Charles_Proteus_Steinmetz |title=Charles Proteus Steinmetz |author= |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=8 August 2011}}</ref> as well as the first vice-president of the International Association of Municipal Electricians (IAME)&nbsp;— which later became the [[International Municipal Signal Association]] (IMSA)&nbsp;— from 1913 until his death. Steinmetz wrote 13 books and 60 articles, not all about engineering.{{elucidate|date=July 2015}} He was an honorary member and adviser to the fraternity [[Phi Gamma Delta]] at [[Union College]], whose chapter house there was one of the first electrified houses ever.{{cn|date=July 2015}}

Steinmetz was a lifelong [[agnosticism|agnostic]].<ref name="Hammond (1924)">{{cite book|title=Charles Proteus Steinmetz: A biography|year=1924|publisher=The Century & Co.|first=John Winthrop |last=Hammond|accessdate=21 August 2012|page=447}}</ref>{{efn|Quoting from Hammond, "This has placed him before the public as an atheist.* The title he did not deny. The writer, however, would put him down as a confirmed agnostic, for an atheist is a person who knows there is no God, and Steinmetz was not of that..."<ref name="Hammond (1924)"/>}}

==Legacy==
Steinmetz died on October 26, 1923 and was buried in [[Vale Cemetery and Vale Park|Vale Cemetery]], [[Schenectady, New York]].

[[File:Albert Einstein with other engineers and scientists at Marconi RCA radio station 1921.jpg|thumb|Marconi Wireless Station in Somerset, New Jersey in 1921, on the day [[Albert Einstein]] was given a tour. Steinmetz is at center; he died two years later.]]

One of the highest technical awards given by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]], for major contributions to [[standardization]] within the field of electrical and electronics engineering, is named in his honor as the [[IEEE Charles Proteus Steinmetz Award]].

His connection to [[Union College]] is celebrated with the annual Steinmetz Symposium,<ref name="UC SteinmetzSym">{{cite web |title=Steinmetz Symposium: Celebrating 25 years of student research  |url=http://www.union.edu/news/stories/2015/05/steinmetz-symposium-celebrating-25-years-of-student-research.php |publisher=Union College |date=9 May 2015}}</ref> a day-long event in which Union undergraduates give presentations on research they have done. Steinmetz Hall, which houses the Union College computer center, is named after him.

Steinmetz was portrayed in 1959 by the actor [[Rod Steiger]] in the [[CBS television]] [[anthology series]], ''[[The Joseph Cotten Show]]''. The episode focused on his socialist activities in Germany.

A Chicago public high school, [[Steinmetz College Prep]], is named for him.

A public park in north Schenectady, New York was named for him in 1931.<ref name="Steinmetz Park Association (2006)">{{cite web|last=Steinmetz Park Association (2006) |title=Steinmetz Park Master Plan |url=http://www.cityofschenectady.com/pdf/development/Steinmetz_Park_Masterplan_2006_Final_Web.pdf |accessdate=January 22, 2013 |location=Schenectady, N.Y. |page=3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20111120181618/http://cityofschenectady.com/pdf/development/Steinmetz_Park_Masterplan_2006_Final_Web.pdf |archivedate=20 November 2011 }}</ref>

Novelist [[John Ball (author)|John Ball]] grew up in Steinmetz's house. His parents were graduate students paid by General Electric to live with and take care of the man Ball called "Uncle Steinie." Ball used to tell his Steinmetz stories to the Southern California Mystery Writers Association meetings.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Steinmetz is a major character in the novel ''Electric City'' by [[Elizabeth Rosner]]. In this epic story of technology, Rosner connects Steinmetz's early ethos as a socialist with his humanitarian vision of a better society based on technological progress: "The political arena that had summoned him in his youth, Socialist views that sent him into exile all those years earlier, further contributed to a seemingly endless hunger for change".<ref>''Electric City'', Berkeley: Counterpoint, 2014, p. 53.</ref>
