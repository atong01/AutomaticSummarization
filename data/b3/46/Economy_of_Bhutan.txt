The economy of [[Bhutan]], one of the world's smallest and least developed countries, is based on [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]], which provide the main livelihood for more than 60% of the population. Agriculture consists largely of [[subsistence farming]] and [[animal husbandry]]. Rugged mountains dominate the terrain and make the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive. 

The economy is closely aligned with [[India]]'s through strong trade and monetary links and dependence on India's financial assistance. Most production in the industrial sector is of the cottage industry type. Most development projects, such as road construction, rely on Indian [[migrant labor]]. Model education, social, and environment programs are underway with support from multilateral development organizations. 

Each economic program takes into account the government's desire to protect the country's environment and cultural traditions. For example, the government, in its cautious expansion of the tourist sector, encourages visits by upscale, environmentally conscientious tourists. Detailed controls and uncertain policies in areas such as industrial licensing, trade, labor, and finance continue to hamper foreign investment. [[Hydropower]] exports to India have boosted Bhutan's overall growth, even though [[GDP]] fell in 2008 as a result of a slowdown in India, its predominant export market.

Bhutan's [[hydropower]] potential and its attraction for [[tourism|tourists]] are key resources. The Bhutanese Government has made some progress in expanding the nation's productive base and improving social welfare. Model education, social, and environment programs in Bhutan are underway with support from multilateral development organizations. Each economic program takes into account the government's desire to protect the country's environment and cultural traditions. For example, the government, in its cautious expansion of the tourist sector, encourages visits by upscale, environmentally conscientious tourists. Detailed controls and uncertain policies in such areas as industrial licensing, trade, labor, and finance continue to hamper foreign investment.

In 2004, Bhutan became the first country in the world to ban smoking and the selling of tobacco.
