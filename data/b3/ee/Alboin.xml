The increasing power of his new neighbours caused Alboin some unease however, and he therefore decided to leave Pannonia for Italy, hoping to take advantage of the<space/><link><target>Byzantine Empire</target></link>'s reduced ability to defend its territory in the wake of the<space/><link><target>Gothic War (535554)</target><part>Gothic War</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>After gathering a large coalition of peoples, Alboin crossed the<space/><link><target>Julian Alps</target></link><space/>in 568, entering an almost undefended Italy.

The Lombards played on the pre-existing hostility between the Avars and the Byzantines, claiming that the latter were allied with the Gepids. Cunimund, on the other hand, encountered hostility when he once again asked the Emperor for military assistance, as the Byzantines had been angered by the Gepids' failure to cede Sirmium to them, as had been agreed. Moreover, Justin II was moving away from the foreign policy of Justinian, and believed in dealing more strictly with bordering states and peoples. Attempts to mollify Justin II with tributes failed, and as a result the Byzantines kept themselves neutral if not outright supportive of the Avars.<extension extension_name='ref' name="DBI"></extension><extension extension_name='ref'>Pohl 1997, pp. 9697</extension></paragraph><paragraph>In 567 the allies made their final move against Cunimund, with Alboin invading the Gepids' lands from the northwest while Bayan attacked from the northeast.

By the conditions accepted in the treaty, the Avars were to take possession of Pannonia and the Lombards were promised military support in Italy should the need arise; also, for a period of 200&amp;nbsp;years the Lombards were to maintain the right to reclaim their former territories if the plan to conquer Italy failed, thus leaving Alboin with an alternative open. The accord also had the advantage of protecting Alboin's rear, as an Avar-occupied Pannonia would make it difficult for the Byzantines to bring forces to Italy by land. The agreement proved immensely successful, and relations with the Avars were almost uninterruptedly friendly during the lifetime of the Lombard Kingdom.<extension extension_name='ref'>Pohl 1997, p. 98</extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="HW286">Wolfram 1997, p. 286</extension><extension extension_name='ref'>Jarnut 1995, pp. 2930</extension></paragraph><paragraph>A further cause of the Lombard migration into Italy may have been an invitation from Narses.

The reason behind the spring departure could be the anxiety induced by the neighboring Avars, despite the friendship treaty. Nomadic peoples like the Avars also waited for autumn to begin their military campaigns, as they needed enough forage for their horses. A sign of this anxiety can also be seen in the decision taken by Alboin to ravage Pannonia, which created a safety zone between the Lombards and the Avars.<extension extension_name='ref' name="HW286"></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="RC186"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The road followed by Alboin to reach Italy has been the subject of controversy, as is the length of the trek.

It seems certain that many sees maintained an uninterrupted episcopal succession through the turmoil of the invasion and the following years.

Gregory's account diverges in several respects from most other sources. In his tale it is told how Alboin married the daughter of a man he had slain, and how she waited for a suitable occasion for revenge, eventually poisoning him. She had previously fallen in love with one of her husband's servants, and after the assassination tried to escape with him, but they were captured and killed. However, historians including Walter Goffart place little trust in this narrative. Goffart notes other similar doubtful stories in the<space/><italics>Historia</italics><space/>and calls its account of Alboin's demise &quot;a suitably ironic tale of the doings of depraved humanity&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref' name="WG392">Goffart 1988, p. 392</extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Skull cup</heading><paragraph>Elements present in Marius' account are echoed in Paul's<space/><italics><link><target>Historia Langobardorum</target></link></italics>, which also contains distinctive features. One of the best known aspects unavailable in any other source is that of the<space/><link><target>skull cup</target></link>. In Paul, the events that lead to Alboin's downfall unfold in Verona. During a great feast, Alboin gets drunk and orders his wife Rosamund to drink from his cup, made from the skull of his father-in-law Cunimund after he had slain him in 567 and married Rosamund. Alboin &quot;invited her to drink merrily with her father&quot;. This reignited the queen's determination to avenge her father.<extension extension_name='ref' name="HS84"></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="SG1921">Gasparri 1990, pp. 1921</extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="HW291">Wolfram 1997, p. 291</extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="WG391392">Goffart 1988, pp. 391392</extension><link><target>File:School of Rubens - Alboin and Rosamunde.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>alt=Painting of a banquet with many participants in which a bearded man points to a woman with a cup while a seated woman looks the scene</part><part>The fatal banquet as painted by<space/><link><target>Peter Paul Rubens</target></link><space/>in 1615</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>The tale has been often dismissed as a fable and Paul was conscious of the risk of disbelief.

The use of skull cups has been noticed among nomadic peoples and, in particular, among the Lombards' neighbours, the Avars. Skull cups are believed to be part of a<space/><link><target>shamanism</target><part>shamanistic</part></link><space/>ritual, where drinking from the cup was considered a way to assume the dead man's powers. In this context, Stefano Gasparri and Wilfried Menghen see in Cunimund's skull cup the sign of nomadic cultural influences on the Lombards: by drinking from his enemy's skull Alboin was taking his vital strength. As for the offering of the skull to Rosamund, that may have been a ritual request of complete submission of the queen and her people to the Lombards, and thus a cause of shame or humiliation. Alternatively, it may have been a rite to appease the dead through the offering of a libation. In the latter interpretation, the queen's answer reveals her determination not to let the wound opened by the killing of her father be healed through a ritual act, thus openly displaying her thirst for revenge.<extension extension_name='ref' name="HS84"></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="SG1921"></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="WG391392"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The episode is read in a radically different way by Walter Goffart. According to him, the whole story assumes an allegorical meaning, with Paul intent on telling an edifying story of the downfall of the hero and his expulsion from the promised land, because of his human weakness. In this story, the skull cup plays a key role as it unites<space/><link><target>original sin</target></link><space/>and barbarism. Goffart does not exclude the possibility that Paul had really seen the skull, but believes that by the 740s the connection between sin and barbarism as exemplified by the skull cup had already been established.<extension extension_name='ref' name="HS84"></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="WG391392"></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Death</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Assassination of Alboin.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>alt=A painting with two men and a woman, in which one man pointing a spear against the other one who is holding a stooge, with the women is holding a sword</part><part>Alboin is killed by Peredeo while Rosamund steals his sword, in a 19th-century painting by<space/><link><target>Charles Landseer</target></link></part></link></paragraph><paragraph>In her plan to kill her husband she found an ally in Helmichis, the king's foster brother and<space/><italics><link><target>spatharios</target><part>spatharius</part></link></italics><space/>(arms bearer).

The latter could also count on the support of the Lombard garrison of Verona, where many may have opposed Alboin's aggressive policy and could have cultivated the hope of reaching an entente with the Empire. The Byzantines were almost certainly deeply involved in the plot.
