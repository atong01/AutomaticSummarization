The '''Cushitic languages''' are a branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] [[language family]] spoken primarily in the [[Horn of Africa]] ([[Somalia]], [[Eritrea]], [[Djibouti]], and [[Ethiopia]]), as well as the [[Nile Valley]] ([[Sudan]] and [[Egypt]]), and parts of the [[African Great Lakes]] region ([[Tanzania]] and [[Kenya]]). The branch is named after the Biblical character [[Cush (Bible)|Cush]], who is identified as an ancestor of the speakers of these specific languages as early as 947 CE (in [[Al-Masudi]]'s Arabic history ''[[Meadows of Gold]]'').

The most populous Cushitic language is [[Oromo language|Oromo]] (including all its variations) with about 35 million speakers, followed by [[Somali language|Somali]] with about 18 million speakers, and [[Sidamo language|Sidamo]] with about 3 million speakers. Other Cushitic languages with more than one million speakers are [[Afar language|Afar]] (1.5 million) and [[Beja language|Beja]] (1.2 million). Somali, one of the [[official language]]s of Somalia, is the only Cushitic language accorded official status in any country. Along with Afar, it is also one of the recognized [[national language]]s of Djibouti.

Additionally, the languages spoken in the ancient [[Kerma Culture]] in present-day southern [[Egypt]] and northern [[Sudan]] and in the [[Savanna Pastoral Neolithic]] culture in the Great Lakes area are believed to have belonged to the Cushitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic family.

==Composition==
The Cushitic languages are usually considered to include the following branches:
* [[Beja language|Beja]] (North Cushitic)
* [[Central Cushitic languages|Central Cushitic]] (Agaw)
* [[Highland East Cushitic languages|Highland East Cushitic]] (Sidamic)
* [[Lowland East Cushitic languages|Lowland East Cushitic]]
* [[Dullay languages|Dullay]]
* [[South Cushitic languages|South Cushitic]]

Lowland and Highland East Cushitic are commonly combined with Dullay into a single branch called ''East Cushitic''.

==Divergent languages==
The Beja language, or ''North Cushitic,'' is sometimes listed as a separate branch of Afroasiatic. However, it is more often included within the Afro-Asiatic family's Cushitic branch.

There are also a few poorly classified languages, including [[Yaaku language|Yaaku]], [[Dahalo language|Dahalo]], [[Asa language|Aasax]], [[Kw'adza language|Kw'adza]], [[Boon language|Boon]], the Cushitic element of [[Mbugu language|Mbugu]] (Ma’a) and [[Ongota language|Ongota]]. There is a wide range of opinions as to how these languages are interrelated.<ref name=Hayward>Richard Hayward, "Afroasiatic", in Heine & Nurse, 2000, ''African Languages''</ref>

The positions of the Dullay languages and Yaaku are uncertain. These have traditionally been assigned to an ''East Cushitic'' branch along with Highland (Sidamic) and Lowland East Cushitic. However, Hayward believes East Cushitic may not be a valid node and that its constituents should be considered separately when attempting to work out the internal relationships of Cushitic.<ref name=Hayward/>

The Afroasiatic identity of [[Ongota language|Ongota]] is also broadly questioned, as is its position within Afroasiatic among those who accept it, due to the "mixed" appearance of the language and a paucity of research and data. [[Harold C. Fleming|Harold Fleming]] (2006) proposes that Ongota constitutes a separate branch of Afroasiatic.<ref>[http://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/pcgi/a.cgi?ausgabe=index&T=1235007315045{haupt_harrassowitz=http://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/title_3277.ahtml?T=1235007315045} Harrassowitz Verlag - The Harrassowitz Publishing House<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Bonny Sands (2009) believes the most convincing proposal is by Savà and Tosco (2003), namely that Ongota is an East Cushitic language with a [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] [[substratum]]. In other words, it would appear that the Ongota people once spoke a Nilo-Saharan language but then shifted to speaking a Cushitic language while retaining some characteristics of their earlier Nilo-Saharan language.<ref name=Sava2003>{{cite book|author1-last=Savà|author1-first=Graziano|author2-last=Tosco|author2-first=Mauro|title=Selected comparative-historical Afrasian linguistic studies|year=2003|publisher=LINCOM Europa|editor-last=Bender|editor-first=M.

[[Robert Hetzron|Hetzron]] (1980:70ff)<ref>Robert Hetzron, "The Limits of Cushitic", ''Sprache und Geschichte in Afrika'' 2. 1980, 7–126.</ref> and [[Christopher Ehret|Ehret]] (1995) have suggested that the [[Rift languages]] (South Cushitic) are a part of Lowland East Cushitic, the only one of the six groups with much internal diversity.

Cushitic was traditionally seen as also including the [[Omotic languages]], then called ''West Cushitic.'' However, this view has largely been abandoned, with Omotic generally agreed to be an independent branch of Afroasiatic, primarily due to the work of [[Harold C. Fleming]] (1974) and [[Lionel Bender (linguist)|M. Lionel Bender]] (1975).

==Extinct languages==
A number of extinct populations are believed to have spoken Afro-Asiatic languages of the Cushitic branch. According to Peter Behrens (1981) and Marianne Bechaus-Gerst (2000), linguistic evidence indicates that the peoples of the [[Kerma Culture]] in present-day southern [[Egypt]] and northern [[Sudan]] spoke Cushitic languages.<ref name="Bechaus-Gerst">{{cite book|last1=Marianne Bechaus-Gerst|first1=Roger Blench, Kevin MacDonald (ed.)|title=The Origins and Development of African Livestock: Archaeology, Genetics, Linguistics and Ethnography - "Linguistic evidence for the prehistory of livestock in Sudan" (2000)|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1135434166|pages=453-457|url=http://www.google.com/books?id=-t5QAwAAQBAJ|accessdate=16 April 2015}}</ref><ref name="Lbant">{{cite book|last1=Behrens|first1=Peter|title=Libya Antiqua: Report and Papers of the Symposium Organized by Unesco in Paris, 16 to 18 January 1984 - "Language and migrations of the early Saharan cattle herders: the formation of the Berber branch"|date=1986|publisher=Unesco|isbn=9231023764|page=30|url=http://www.google.com/books?id=p_hwAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=16 April 2015}}</ref> The Nilo-Saharan [[Nobiin language]] today contains a number of key pastoralism related [[loanword]]s that are of proto-Highland East Cushitic origin, including the terms for sheep/goatskin, hen/cock, livestock enclosure, butter and milk. This in turn suggests that the Kerma population — which, along with the [[C-Group Culture]], inhabited the Nile Valley immediately before the arrival of the first Nubian speakers — spoke Afro-Asiatic languages.<ref name="Bechaus-Gerst"/>

Additionally, historiolinguistics indicate that the makers of the [[Savanna Pastoral Neolithic]] (Stone Bowl Culture) in the Great Lakes area likely spoke South Cushitic languages.<ref name="Ambrose220">{{cite book|last1=Ambrose|first1=Stanley H.|title=From Hunters to Farmers: The Causes and Consequences of Food Production in Africa - "The Introduction of Pastoral Adaptations to the Highlands of East Africa"|date=1984|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520045742|pages=234 & 223|url=http://www.google.com/books?id=dftPHu1o2s8C|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref> [[Christopher Ehret]] (1998) proposes that among these idioms were the now extinct Tale and Bisha languages, which were identified on the basis of loanwords.<ref name="Mous">{{cite web|last1=Roland Kießling, Maarten Mous & Derek Nurse|title=The Tanzanian Rift Valley area|url=http://www.academia.edu/825370/The_Tanzanian_Rift_Valley_area|publisher=Maarten Mous|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref>
