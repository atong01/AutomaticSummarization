These plans evolved over the next few years, and the project became official in 1972. The tower would have been part of Metro Centre (see<space/><link><target>CityPlace, Toronto</target><part>CityPlace</part></link>), a large development south of<space/><link><target>Front Street (Toronto)</target><part>Front Street</part></link><space/>on the<space/><link><target>Railway Lands</target></link>, a large railway switching yard that was being made redundant by newer yards outside the city.

The reflective nature of the new buildings compromised the quality of broadcast signals necessitating new, higher antennas that were at least<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>300</arg><arg>m</arg><arg>ft</arg><arg name="abbr">on</arg></template><space/>tall.At the time, most data communications took place over<space/><link><target>Microwave#Communication</target><part>point-to-point microwave</part></link><space/>links, whose dish antennae covered the roofs of large buildings. As each new skyscraper was added to the downtown, former line-of-sight links were no longer possible. CN intended to rent &quot;hub&quot; space for microwave links, visible from almost any building in the Toronto area.

Had it been built, this design would have been considerably shorter, with the metal antenna located roughly where the concrete section between the main level and the SkyPod lies today. As the design effort continued, it evolved into the current design with a single continuous hexagonal core to the SkyPod, with three support legs blended into the hexagon below the main level, forming a large Y-shape structure at the ground level.<extension extension_name='ref' name="CNTower"></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="ieee"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="last">Hahn</arg><arg name="first">Trizec</arg><arg name="title">A Brief Overview of the CN Tower</arg><arg name="url">http://www.ieee.ca/millennium/cntower/cntower_overview.html</arg><arg name="publisher">Ieee.ca</arg><arg name="accessdate">January 2, 2013</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The idea for the main level in its current form evolved around this time, but the Space Deck (now named SkyPod) was not part of the plans until some time later. One engineer in particular felt that visitors would feel the higher observation deck would be worth paying extra for, and the costs in terms of construction were not prohibitive. It was also some time around this point that it was realized that the tower could become the world's tallest structure, and plans were changed to incorporate subtle modifications throughout the structure to this end.<extension extension_name='ref' name="CNTower"></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="ieee"></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Construction</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:CNTowerLong.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>The CN Tower as seen from its base</part></link>Construction on the CN Tower began on February 6, 1973, with massive excavations at the tower base for the foundation.

This portion of the construction was fairly rapid, with only four months needed between the start and the foundation being ready for construction on top.<extension extension_name='ref' name="ieee"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>To build the main support pillar, a hydraulically raised<space/><link><target>Slip forming</target><part>slipform</part></link><space/>was built at the base. This was a fairly impressive engineering feat on its own, consisting of a large metal platform that raised itself on jacks at about<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>6</arg><arg>m</arg><arg>ft</arg><arg>1</arg><arg name="abbr">on</arg></template><space/>per day as the concrete below set. Concrete was poured continuously by a team of 1,532 people until February 22, 1974, during which it had already become the tallest structure in Canada, surpassing the recently built<space/><link><target>Inco Superstack</target></link>, which was built using similar methods. In total, the tower contains<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>40500</arg><arg>m3</arg><arg>cuyd</arg><arg>0</arg><arg name="abbr">on</arg></template><space/>of concrete, all of which was mixed on-site in order to ensure batch consistency. Through the pour, the vertical accuracy of the tower was maintained by comparing the slip form's location to massive<space/><link><target>plumb bob</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>hanging from it, observed by small telescopes from the ground. Over the height of the tower, it varies from true vertical accuracy by only<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>29</arg><arg>mm</arg><arg>in</arg><arg>1</arg><arg name="abbr">on</arg></template>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="CNTower"></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="ieee"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>In August 1974, construction of the main level commenced. Using 45 hydraulic jacks attached to cables strung from a temporary steel crown anchored to the top of the tower, twelve giant steel and wooden bracket forms were slowly raised, ultimately taking about a week to crawl up to their final position. These forms were used to create the brackets that support the main level, as well as a base for the construction of the main level itself. The Space Deck (currently named SkyPod) was built of concrete poured into a wooden frame attached to rebar at the lower level deck, and then reinforced with a large steel compression band around the outside.<extension extension_name='ref' name="ieee"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The antenna was originally to be raised by crane as well, but during construction the<space/><link><target>Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane</target></link><space/>helicopter became available when the<space/><link><target>United States Army</target></link><space/>sold off theirs to civilian operators. The helicopter, named &quot;Olga&quot;, was first used to remove the crane, and then flew the antenna up in 36 sections. The flights of the antenna pieces were a minor tourist attraction of their own, and the schedule was printed in the local newspapers. Use of the helicopter saved months of construction time, with this phase taking only three and a half weeks instead of the planned six months. The tower was topped off on April 2, 1975, after 26 months of construction, officially capturing the height record from<space/><link><target>Moscow</target></link>'s<space/><link><target>Ostankino Tower</target></link>, and bringing the total mass to<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>118000</arg><arg>t</arg><arg>ST LT</arg><arg>0</arg><arg name="abbr">on</arg><arg name="lk">on</arg></template>.</paragraph><paragraph>Two years into the construction, plans for Metro Centre were scrapped, leaving the tower isolated on the Railway Lands in what was then a largely abandoned light-industrial space. This caused serious problems for tourists to access the tower.
