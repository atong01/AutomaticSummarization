As long as this concept did not develop into the ideology of chauvinism and remained in the rather vague realm of national or even nationalistic pride, it frequently resulted in a high sense of responsibility for the welfare of backward people.<ref>{{cite journal |last">Arendt |first</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Technical Chauvinism has been used for those examples where inventors of a particular nationality have been idolised, one case being that of the<space/><link><target>Propeller (marine)</target><part>ship's propeller</part></link>.

After the war ended and men returned home to find jobs in the workplace, male chauvinism was on the rise according to Cynthia B. Lloyd. Previously, men had been the main source of labour, and they expected to come back to their previous employment, but women had stepped into many of their positions to fill the void says Lloyd.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Lloyd, Cynthia B. 1975">Lloyd, Cynthia B., ed.<space/><italics>Sex, Discrimination, and the Division of Labor</italics>.

It refers to the maintenance of fixed beliefs and attitudes of male superiority, associated with overt or covert depreciation of women. Challenging chauvinist attitudes often results in anxiety or other symptoms. It is frequently not investigated in psychotherapy because it is ego-syntonic, parallels cultural attitudes, and because therapists often share similar bias or neurotic conflict. Male chauvinism was found to represent an attempt to ward off anxiety and shame arising from one or more of four prime sources: unresolved infantile strivings and regressive wishes, hostile envy of women, [[oedipal]] anxiety, and power and dependency conflicts related to masculine [[self-esteem]]. [[Mother]]s were more important than fathers in the development of male chauvinism, and resolution was sometimes associated with [[decompensation#Psychology|decompensation]] in wives.<ref>{{cite journal|last">Woods|first</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>Female chauvinism</heading><paragraph><template><target>see also</target><arg>misandry</arg><arg>gender feminism</arg></template>The term<space/><italics>female chauvinism</italics><space/>has been adopted by critics of some types or aspects of<space/><link><target>feminism</target></link>; second-wave feminist<space/><link><target>Betty Friedan</target></link><space/>is a notable example.<extension extension_name='ref'>&quot;If I were a man, I would strenuously object to the assumption that women have any moral or spiritual superiority as a class.
