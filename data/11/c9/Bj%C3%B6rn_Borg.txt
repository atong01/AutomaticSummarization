'''Björn Borg''' ({{IPA-sv|bjœːɳ bɔrj|-|sv-Björn Borg.ogg}}; born 6 June 1956) is a former [[List of ATP number 1 ranked players|world No. 1]] [[tennis player]] from [[Sweden]] widely considered to be one of the greatest in tennis history.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,9910-1165988,00.html "Navratilova joins Laver and Borg on the shortlist"], Campbell, Alastair ''[[The Times]]'' (London), 3 July 2004</ref><ref name=pears>{{cite news |author=Pears, Tim |title=When he was king |url=http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/jun/05/tennis.features1 |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=5 June 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Top 10 Men's Tennis Players of All Time|work=Sports Illustrated |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/1009/top.ten.tennis/content.1.html|accessdate=23 September 2010}}</ref> Between 1974 and 1981 he became the first male professional to win 11 [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles titles: six at the [[French Open]] and five consecutive at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]]. He also won three [[Tennis records of the Open Era – men's singles#Year-end championships|year-end championships]] and 15 [[Grand Prix Super Series]] titles.

Borg set numerous [[history of tennis|Open Era]] records that still stand, including winning 41% of the Grand Slam singles tournaments he entered and 90% of those matches,<ref>{{cite web|title=ATP Performance Grand Slam Career Lst|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Performance-Zone/Performance-Gland-Slams-Career-List.aspx|website=ATP World Tour|publisher=ATP|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref> winning both the French Open and Wimbledon for three consecutive years, and winning three Grand Slams [[Tennis records of the Open Era – men's singles#Career achievements|without losing a set]]. Also, his total career match win rate of 82.7% remains [[Tennis records of the Open Era – men's singles#Matches played, won, win rate|the second best]] of the era.

A teenage sensation at the start of his career, Borg's unprecedented stardom and consistent success helped propel the rising popularity of tennis during the 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/2006-05-24-borg-cover_x.htm |title=Borg still making the shots |author=Douglas Robson |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date= 25 May 2006}}</ref> As a result, the professional tour became more lucrative, and in 1979 he was the first player to earn more than one million dollars in prize money in a single season. He also made millions in endorsements throughout his career. The downside, however, was the constant attention and pressure eventually caused [[Burnout (psychology)|burnout]] and his retirement at the age of 26.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeoPLzGt7Ig ''Champions: Bjorn Borg''], a 1983 documentary covering the end of Borg's career</ref>

==Early life==
Björn Borg was born in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, on 6 June 1956, as the only child of Rune and Margaretha Borg.<ref name=pears/> He grew up in nearby [[Södertälje]]. As a child, Borg became fascinated with a golden tennis racket that his father won at a [[table-tennis]] tournament. His father gave him the racket, beginning his tennis career.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/sports/2011/07/14/oc.bjorn.borg.greatest.cnn?&hpt=hp_c2 | work=CNN | title=CNN.com Video}}</ref>

A player of great athleticism and endurance, he had a distinctive style and appearance—bowlegged and very fast. His muscularity allowed him to put heavy topspin on both his forehand and two-handed backhand. He followed [[Jimmy Connors]] in using the two-handed backhand. By the time he was 13 he was beating the best of Sweden's under-18 players, and Davis Cup captain [[Lennart Bergelin]] (who served as Borg's primary coach throughout his professional career) cautioned against anyone trying to change Borg's rough-looking, jerky strokes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/sport/bjorn-borg-ar-bast-av-dem-alla/|title=Björn Borg är bäst av dem alla|work=DN.SE|accessdate=2 July 2015}}</ref>

==Career==
At the age of 15 Borg represented Sweden in the 1972 [[Davis Cup]] and won his debut singles [[rubber]] in five sets against veteran [[Onny Parun]] of [[New Zealand]]. Later that year, he won the Wimbledon junior singles title, recovering from a 5–2 deficit in the final set to overcome Britain's [[Buster Mottram]]. Then in December he won the [[Dunlop Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl Junior Championship]] for boys, 18 and under after a straight sets victory in the final over [[Vitas Gerulaitis]].<ref>{{cite news|author1=Sam Pollak|title=Californian tires at end, loses to Sweden's Borg|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WdVWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gkINAAAAIBAJ&pg=3638%2C2824328|work=The Miami News|date=28 December 1972}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author1=Jim Martz|title=Orange Bowl Celebrates 60th Anniversary|url=http://www.usta.com/Archive/News/Juniors/Junior/383333_Orange_Bowl_Celebrates_60th_Anniversary/|website=www.usta.com|publisher=USTA|date=25 May 2008}}</ref>

Borg joined the professional circuit in 1973, reaching the fourth round of his first French Open and the quarterfinals of Wimbledon. Just before his 18th birthday in 1974, Borg won his first top-level singles title at the [[Rome Masters|Italian Open]], becoming its youngest winner. Two weeks later he won the [[French Open]], defeating [[Manuel Orantes]] in the final in five sets. Barely 18, Borg was the youngest-ever male French Open champion up to that point.

In early 1975, Borg defeated [[Rod Laver]], then 36 years old, in a semifinal of the [[World Championship Tennis]] (WCT) finals in [[Dallas]], Texas, in five sets. Borg subsequently lost to [[Arthur Ashe]] in the final. 
Borg retained his French Open title in 1975, beating [[Guillermo Vilas]] in the final in straight sets. Borg then reached the Wimbledon quarterfinals, where he lost to eventual champion Ashe. Borg did not lose another match at Wimbledon until 1981. Borg won two singles and one doubles rubber in the 1975 Davis Cup final, as Sweden beat [[Czechoslovakia]] 3–2. With these singles wins, Borg had won 19 consecutive Davis Cup singles rubbers since 1973. That was already a record at the time. However, Borg never lost another Davis Cup singles rubber, and, by the end of his career, he had stretched that winning streak to 33—a Davis Cup record that still stands.<ref name=Daviscup/>

In early 1976, Borg won the [[World Championship Tennis]] year-end [[WCT Finals]] in [[Dallas]], Texas, with a four-set victory over [[Guillermo Vilas]] in the final. At the 1976 French Open, Borg lost to the Italian [[Adriano Panatta]], who remains the only player to defeat Borg at this tournament. Panatta did it twice: in the fourth round in 1973, and in the 1976 quarterfinals. Borg won Wimbledon in 1976 without losing a set, defeating the favored [[Ilie Năstase]] in the final. Borg became the youngest male Wimbledon champion of the modern era at 20 years and 1 month (a record subsequently broken by [[Boris Becker]], who won Wimbledon aged 17 in 1985). It would be the last time Borg played Wimbledon as an underdog. Năstase later exclaimed, "We're playing tennis, he's [Borg] playing something else." Borg also reached the final of the 1976 [[U.S. Open (tennis)|US Open]], which was then being played on clay courts. Borg lost in four sets to world no. 1 [[Jimmy Connors]].

Borg skipped the French Open in 1977 because he was under contract with [[World Team Tennis|WTT]], but he repeated his Wimbledon triumph, although this time he was pushed much harder. He defeated his good friend [[Vitas Gerulaitis]] in a semifinal in five sets.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/wimbledon_history/3742097.stm "Classic Matches: Borg v Gerulaitis"], [[BBC Sport]], 31 May 2004</ref> In the final, Borg was pushed to five sets for the third time in the tournament, this time by Connors. The win propelled Borg to the no. 1 ranking on the computer, albeit for just one week in August. Prior to the 1977 US Open, Borg aggravated a shoulder injury while waterskiing with Vitas Gerulaitis. This injury ultimately forced him to retire during a fourth round match vs Dick Stockton.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} Through 1977, he had never lost to a player younger than himself.

Borg was at the height of his career from 1978 through 1980, completing the difficult French Open-Wimbledon double all three years. In 1978, Borg won the French Open with a win over Vilas in the final. Borg did not drop a set during the tournament, a feat only he, Năstase (in 1973), and [[Rafael Nadal]] (in 2008 and 2010) have accomplished at the French Open during the open era. Borg defeated Connors in straight sets at the 1978 Wimbledon. At the US Open, now held on hard courts in Flushing Meadow, New York, he lost the final in straight sets to Connors. That autumn, Borg faced [[John McEnroe]] for the first time in a semifinal of the Stockholm Open, and lost to McEnroe.
[[File:Bjorn Borg (1979).jpg|left|thumb|350px|Björn Borg playing a double-handed backhand shot at the [[1979 ABN World Tennis Tournament]]]]

Borg lost to McEnroe again in four sets in the final of the 1979 WCT Finals but was now overtaking Connors for the top ranking. Borg established himself firmly in the top spot with his fourth French Open singles title and fourth straight Wimbledon singles title, defeating Connors in a straight-set semifinal at the latter tournament. At the French Open, Borg defeated big-serving [[Victor Pecci]] in a four-set final, and at Wimbledon, Borg took five sets to overcome an even bigger server, [[Roscoe Tanner]]. Borg was upset by Tanner at the US Open, in a four-set quarterfinal played under the lights.

At the season-ending [[Tennis Masters Cup|Masters]] tournament in January 1980, Borg survived a close semifinal against McEnroe. He then beat Gerulaitis in straight sets, winning his first Masters and first title in New York. In June, he overcame Gerulaitis, again in straight sets, for his fifth French Open title. Again, he did not drop a set.

Borg won his fifth consecutive Wimbledon singles title, the [[1980 Wimbledon Men's Singles final]], by defeating McEnroe in a five-set match, often cited as the best Wimbledon final ever played - the only comparable match being the Federer - Nadal final in 2008.<ref name="aftonbladet.se1">{{cite web|url=http://wwwc.aftonbladet.se/arhundradets/dagar/990705.html|title=Aftonbladet sport: Århundradets Sport|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2015}}</ref><ref name="sverigesradio">{{cite web|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/gruppsida.aspx?programid=3913&grupp=20314&artikel=3946915|title=Klassiska referat: Tennis|author=Sveriges Radio|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2015}}</ref> Having lost the opening set to an all-out McEnroe assault, Borg took the next two  and had two championship points at 5–4 in the fourth. However, McEnroe averted disaster and went on to level the match in Wimbledon's most memorable 34-point tiebreaker, which he won 18–16. In the fourth-set tiebreak, McEnroe saved five match points, and Borg six set points, before McEnroe won the set.<ref name="sverigesradio"/> Björn served first to begin the 5th set and fell behind 15–40. Borg then won 19 straight points on serve in the deciding set and prevailed after 3 hours, 53 minutes.<ref name="aftonbladet.se1"/> Borg himself commented years later that this was the first time that he was afraid that he would lose, as well as feeling that it was the beginning of the end of his dominance.<ref name="sverigesradio"/><ref name="Observer 2007-01-07">{{cite news | first=Tim | last=Adams | title='I can't explain except to say I wanted to play again.

He defeated McEnroe in the final of the 1980 Stockholm Open, and faced him one more time that year, in the round-robin portion of the year-end Masters, played in January 1981. With 19,103 fans in attendance, Borg won a deciding third-set tie-break for the second year in a row. Borg then defeated [[Ivan Lendl]] for his second Masters title.<ref name="sverigesradio"/>

Borg won his last Grand Slam title at the French Open in 1981, defeating Lendl in a five-set final. Borg has a six French Open Grand Slam titles record bettered only by [[Rafael Nadal]] in 2012. In reaching the Wimbledon final in 1981, Borg stretched his winning streak at the [[All England Club]] to a record 41 matches. In a semifinal, Borg was down to Connors by two sets to love, before coming back to win the match. However, Borg's streak was brought to an end by McEnroe, who defeated him in four sets.

Borg went on to lose to McEnroe at the 1981 US Open. After that defeat, Borg walked off the court and out of the stadium before the ceremonies and press conference had begun. There are reports that Borg received threats after his semifinal win over Connors. In later years, Borg apologized to McEnroe. The 1981 US Open would be the Swede's last Grand Slam final. Major tournaments and tour organizers were enforcing a new rule; by 1982, that players had to play at least 10 official tournaments per year. However, Borg wanted to curtail his schedule after many years of winning so often. Although he felt in good condition physically, he recognized that the relentless drive to win and defy tour organizers had begun to fade.<ref name = "Observer 2007-01-07"/>

Borg failed to win the US Open in 10 tries, losing four finals, 1976 and 1978 to [[Jimmy Connors]], and 1980 and 1981 to McEnroe. He played on hard courts at the US Open from 1978 to 1981 and reached the final there on three occasions, in 1978, 1980 and 1981. He led 3–2 in the fifth set of the 1980 final, before losing. That match followed Borg's classic encounter with McEnroe at the 1980 Wimbledon. In 1978, 1979 and 1980, Borg was halfway to a Grand Slam after victories at the French and Wimbledon (the Australian Open being the last Grand Slam tournament of each year at the time) only to falter at Flushing Meadow, lefty Tanner his conqueror in 1979.

He appeared only once at the Australian Open, at the age of 17, at which he lost in an early round.

In 1982, Borg played only one tournament, losing to [[Yannick Noah]] in the quarterfinals of [[Monte Carlo Masters|Monte Carlo]] in April. Nevertheless, Borg's announcement in January 1983 that he was retiring from the game at the age of 26 was a shock to the tennis world. McEnroe tried unsuccessfully to persuade Borg to continue. He did, however, play Monte Carlo again in March 1983, reaching the second round, and Stuttgart in July 1984.

===Retirement===
Upon retirement, Borg had three residences, a penthouse in Monte Carlo, not far from his [[pro shop]], a mansion on Long Island, New York and a small island off the Swedish coast.

Borg later bounced back as the owner of the Björn Borg fashion label. In Sweden his label has become very successful, second only to [[Calvin Klein]].<ref name="Observer 2007-01-07" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bjornborg.com/en/ |title=Index of /en |publisher=Bjornborg.com |date=27 October 2010 |accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref>

===Failed comeback===
In the early-1990s, Borg attempted a comeback on the men's professional tennis tour. In doing so, he grew his hair out as it had been when he retired and returned to using a wooden racket; he had kept his hair cut and used modern graphite rackets in exhibitions he played during the later 1980s. Borg, however, failed to win a single match. He faced [[Jordi Arrese]] in his first match back, again at Monte Carlo but without practising or playing any exhibition matches, and fell in two sets. In his first nine matches, played in 1991 and 1992, Borg failed to win a single set. He fared slightly better in 1993, taking a set off his opponent in each of the three matches he played. He came closest to getting a win in what turned out to be his final tour match, falling to [[Alexander Volkov (tennis)|Alexander Volkov]].

In 1992 Borg, aged 35, using a Donnay Graphite Midsize racket strung at 85&nbsp;[[pound (force)|lbf]] tension{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}, defeated [[John Lloyd (tennis)|John Lloyd]], 37, at the Inglewood Forum Tennis Challenge. Borg later joined the champions tour, returning to shorter hair and using modern rackets.

==Personal life==
Borg married Romanian tennis pro [[Mariana Simionescu]] in [[Bucharest]] on 24 July 1980.
The marriage ended in divorce in 1984. He fathered a child by the Swedish model Jannike Björling, and he was married to the Italian singer [[Loredana Bertè]] from 1989 to 1993.<ref name = "Observer 2007-01-07"/> In 2002, Borg married for a third time, wedding Patricia Östfeld on June 8th.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hello!|url=http://us.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/2002/06/10/borg/|website=us.hellomagazine.com|publisher=Hello! Magazine|date=10 June 2002}}</ref>
He narrowly avoided personal bankruptcy when business ventures failed.<ref>{{cite news | first=Duncan | last=Campbell | title=Borg trophies sale highlights aces and double faults of tennis stars | date=4 March 2006 | url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2006/mar/04/sport.tennis | work=The Guardian | accessdate =7 July 2008 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last= | title= Borg Bankruptcy Sought | date=24 October 1996 | url =http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01EEDF1030F937A15753C1A960958260 | work=The New York Times | accessdate =7 July 2008 }}</ref>

==Memorabilia preserved==
In March 2006, [[Bonhams|Bonhams Auction House]] in London announced that it would auction Borg's Wimbledon trophies and two of his winning rackets on 21 June 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/2006-03-03-borg-trophies-auction_x.htm |title=Borg to auction off Wimbledon trophies |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=3 March 2006 |accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref> Several players then called Borg in an attempt to make him reconsider. Jimmy Connors and Andre Agassi volunteered to buy them to keep them together, and according to [[Dagens Nyheter]] – who had talked to Borg – McEnroe called from New York and asked, "What's up? Have you gone mad?"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=672&a=532512&previousRenderType=3 | title=McEnroe fick Borg på andra tankar | language=Swedish |work=DN Sport | date=28 March 2006 }}</ref> The conversation, paired with Connors and Agassi's plea, eventually persuaded Borg to buy out the trophies from Bonhams at an undisclosed amount.

==Distinctions and honors==
*Borg was ranked by the ATP rankings world no. 1 in six different stretches between 1977 and 1981, totaling 109 weeks.
*During his career, he won a total of 77 (64 listed on the [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] website) top-level singles and four doubles titles.
*Borg won the [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year Overseas Personality]] Award in 1979.
*Borg was inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in 1987.
*On 10 December 2006, the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] gave Borg a Lifetime Achievement Award, which was presented by [[Boris Becker]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/front_page/6220542.stm |title=Sports Personality: The winners |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 December 2006 |accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref>
*In December 2014 he was elected Sweden's top sportsperson of all time by the newspaper [[Dagens Nyheter]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Björn Borg är bäst av dem alla|url=http://www.dn.se/sport/bjorn-borg-ar-bast-av-dem-alla/|website=www.dn.se|publisher=[[Dagens Nyheter]]|language=Swedish|date=23 December 2014}}</ref>

==Recognition==
With 11 Grand Slam titles, Borg ranks fifth in the list of male tennis players who have won the most Grand Slam singles titles behind [[Roger Federer]] (17), [[Pete Sampras]] (14), [[Rafael Nadal]] (14) and [[Roy Emerson]] (12). The French Open—Wimbledon double he achieved three times consecutively was called by Wimbledon officials "the most difficult double in tennis"<ref name=Wimbledonrecords/> and "a feat considered impossible among today's players."<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/09/13/SPGGPL4KST1.DTL "Strokes for Agassi: He belongs among the 10 greatest ever"], Bruce Jenkins, ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', 13 September 2006</ref> Only [[Chris Evert]] (in 1974), [[Martina Navratilova]] (in 1982 and 1984), [[Steffi Graf]] (in 1988, 1993, 1995 and 1996), [[Serena Williams]] (2002 and 2015), Rafael Nadal (in 2008 and 2010) and Roger Federer (in 2009) have managed to achieve this double since, and [[Rafael Nadal]], [[Andre Agassi]] and [[Roger Federer]] are the only male players since Borg to have won the French Open and Wimbledon men's singles titles over their career. [[Ilie Năstase]] once said about Borg, "We're playing tennis, and he's playing something else".

In his 1979 autobiography, [[Jack Kramer (tennis player)|Jack Kramer]], the long-time tennis promoter and great player himself, had already included Borg in his list of the 21 greatest players of all time. And in 2003, [[Bud Collins]] chose Borg as one of his top-five male players of all time.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14489546/ "Top Stars of Tennis"], [[Bud Collins]], [[MSNBC]]</ref>

In 2008, [[ESPN.com]] asked tennis analysts, writers, and former players to build the perfect open era player. Borg was the only player mentioned in four categories: defense, footwork, intangibles, and mental toughness—with his mental game and footwork singled out as the best in open era history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/flash/perfect |title=ESPN.com – Tennis – The Perfect Player |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref>

Borg never won the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] or the [[Australian Open]], losing in the final at the US Open four times. The only players to defeat Borg in a Grand Slam final were fellow World No. 1 tennis players [[John McEnroe]] and [[Jimmy Connors]]. Even though it was then played on grass, a surface where he enjoyed much success, Borg chose to play the Australian Open only once, in 1974, where he lost in the third round. [[Phil Dent]], a contemporary of Borg, has pointed out that skipping Grand Slam tournaments—especially the Australian Open—was not unusual then, before counting Grand Slam titles became the norm.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bonnie DeSimoneArchive |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/french07/columns/story?columnist=desimone_bonnie&id=2882705 |title=Chris Evert owned Roland Garros like no other |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=26 May 2007 |accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref> Additionally, another contemporary [[Arthur Ashe]] told ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', "I think Bjorn could have won the U.S. Open. I think he could have won the Grand Slam. But by the time he left, the historical challenge didn't mean anything. He was bigger than the game. He was like [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] or [[Liz Taylor]] or somebody."<ref>{{cite web|author=Curry Kirkpatrick |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1140719/index.htm |title=Unbjorn |publisher=Vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=6 May 1991 |accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref>

==Playing style==
Borg had one of the most distinctive playing styles in the Open Era.<ref name="jonasarnesen">{{cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/borg-ser-tillbaka-pa-sin-tennisrevolution|title=Borg ser tillbaka på sin tennisrevolution|author=Jonas Arnesen|work=SvD.se|accessdate=2 July 2015}}</ref> He played from the baseline, with powerful ground-strokes. His highly unorthodox backhand involved taking his racket back with both hands but actually generating his power with his dominant right hand, letting go of the grip with his left hand around point of contact, and following through with his swing as a one-hander.<ref>[http://www.slagproffset.se/Tennisboken/Analys%20av%20bra%20spelares%20teknik%20-%20del%20II/Servetekniken%20hos%20en%20rekordh%C3%A5llare.html Aanalys av bra spelares teknik - Slagproffset] Retrieved 2 July 2015</ref> He hit the ball hard and high from the back of the court and brought it down with considerable [[topspin]], which made his ground strokes very consistent.<ref name=bbc_legends>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/wimbledon_history/3742099.stm |title=Wimbledon legends: Bjorn Borg |accessdate=20 January 2009 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 May 2004}}</ref> There had been other players, particularly [[Rod Laver]] and [[Arthur Ashe]], who played with topspin on both the forehand and backhand. Yet Laver and Ashe used topspin only as a way to mix up their shots and pass their opponents at the net easily. Borg was one of the first top players to use heavy topspin on his shots consistently.<ref name="jonasarnesen"/>

Complementing his consistent ground-strokes was his fitness. Both of these factors allowed Borg to be dominant at the French Open.<ref name="dn.se">{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/sport/johan-esk-han-ar-solklar-etta-pa-150-listan/|title=Johan Esk: Han är solklar etta på 150-listan|work=DN.SE|accessdate=2 July 2015}}</ref>

One of the factors that made Borg unique was his dominance on the grass courts of Wimbledon, where baseliners since World War II did not usually succeed. Some experts attributed his dominance on this surface to his consistency, an underrated serve, equally underrated volleys, and his adaptation to grass courts. Against the best players, he almost always served-and-volleyed on his first serves (but he naturally played from the baseline after his second serves).<ref name="dn.se"/><ref name="aftonbladet.se">{{cite web|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/tennis/article19119729.ab|title=Största ögonblicket i idrottshistorien...|work=Aftonbladet|accessdate=2 July 2015}}</ref>

Another trait usually associated with Borg is his grace under pressure. His calm court demeanor earned him the nickname of the "Ice Man" or "Ice-Borg."<ref name=UKTelegraph>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2007/10/25/stborg125.xml |title= Bjorn Borg: My life is perfect |accessdate=13 May 2008 |first=Mark |last=Hodgkinson |date=25 October 2007 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London}}</ref>

Borg's physical conditioning was legendary and unrivalled. He could outlast most of his opponents under the most grueling conditions. Contrary to popular belief, however, this wasn't due to his exceptionally low resting heart rate, often reported to be near 35 beats per minute. In his introduction to Borg's autobiography ''My Life and Game'', Eugene Scott relates that this rumor arose from a medical exam the 18-year-old Borg once took for military service, where his pulse was recorded as 38. Scott goes on to reveal Borg's true pulse rate as "about 50 when he wakes up and around 60 in the afternoon."<ref>Borg, Björn, and Eugene L. Scott. ''My Life and Game'' (1980), page 11</ref> Borg is credited with helping to develop the style of play that has come to dominate the game today.<ref name="aftonbladet.se"/>

*John Barrett, editor, ''World of Tennis Yearbooks'', London, from 1976 through 1983.
*Michel Sutter, ''Vainqueurs Winners 1946–2003'', Paris, 2003. Sutter has attempted to list all tournaments meeting his criteria for selection beginning with 1946 and ending in the fall of 1991. For each tournament, he has indicated the city, the date of the final, the winner, the runner-up, and the score of the final. A tournament is included in his list if: (1) the draw for the tournament included at least eight players (with a few exceptions, such as the Pepsi Grand Slam tournaments in the second half of the 1970s which included only players that had won a Grand Slam tournament); and (2) the level of the tournaments was at least equal to the present day challenger tournaments. Sutter's book is probably the most exhaustive source of tennis tournament information since World War II, even though some professional tournaments held before the start of the open era are missing. Later, Sutter issued a second edition of his book, with only the players, their wins, and years for the 1946 through 27 April 2003, period.
