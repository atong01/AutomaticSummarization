'''Caelum''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|iː|l|əm}} is a faint [[constellation]] in the [[southern sky]], introduced in the 1750s by [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]]. Its name means "[[chisel]]" in [[Latin]], and it was formerly known as '''Caelum Scalptorium''' ("the engravers' chisel"); a rare word, unconnected with the far more common Latin ''caelum'', meaning "sky, heaven, atmosphere".<ref>Charlton T. Lewis, Ph.D. and. Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'' Oxford University Press, 1879. Entries for ''caelum'' and ''caelum''.</ref> It is the eighth-smallest constellation, and subtends a [[solid angle]] of around 0.038 [[steradian]]s, just less than that of [[Corona Australis]].

Due to its small size and location away from the plane of the [[Milky Way]], Caelum is a rather barren constellation, with few objects of interest. The constellation's brightest star, [[Alpha Caeli]], is only of [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] 4.45, and only one other star ([[Gamma1 Caeli|Gamma<sup>1</sup> Caeli]]) is brighter than magnitude 5. Other notable objects in Caelum are [[RR Caeli]],a [[binary star]] with one known planet approximately {{convert|20.13|pc|ly}} away; [[X Caeli]], a [[Delta Scuti variable]] that forms an [[Double star|optical double]] with Gamma<sup>1</sup> Caeli; and [[HE0450-2958]], a [[Seyfert galaxy]] that at first appeared as just a [[astrophysical jet|jet]] with no host galaxy visible.

Caelum was first introduced in the eighteenth century by [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]], a French astronomer who introduced thirteen other southern constellations at the same time.<ref name="LacailleStarTales">{{cite web|url = http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/lacaille.htm |work = Star Tales |title = Lacaille |last = Ridpath |first = Ian |accessdate=3 May 2014 |publisher=self-published}}</ref> The French name Lacaille gave the constellation, ''Burin'',  was originally Latinized to ''Caelum Scalptorium'' ("The Engravers' Chisel"), and [[Francis Baily]] shortened this name to ''Caelum'' after a suggestion by [[John Herschel]].<ref name="CaelumStarTales">{{cite web |url = http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/caelum.htm |work = Star Tales |title = Caelum |last = Ridpath |first = Ian |accessdate=3 May 2014 |publisher=self-published}}</ref> In Lacaille's original chart, the constellation was shown both as a [[burin]] and an [[échoppe]], although it has come to be recognized simply as a chisel.<ref name="CaelumStarTales"/> [[Johann Elert Bode]] stated the name as plural with a singular possessor, ''Caela Scalptoris'' ("the Engraver's Chisels") but this did not stick.<ref name="wagman"/>

== Characteristics ==
Caelum is bordered by [[Dorado]] and [[Pictor]] to the south, [[Horologium (constellation)|Horologium]] and [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]] to the east, [[Lepus (constellation)|Lepus]] to the north, and [[Columba (constellation)|Columba]] to the west. Covering 125 [[square degree]]s, it ranks 81st of the [[88 modern constellations]] in size. It appears prominently in the southern sky during the Southern Hemisphere's summer, and the whole constellation is visible for at least part of the year to observers south of latitude 41°N.<ref name=tirionconst>{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/constellations1.htm | title=Constellations: Andromeda–Indus | work= Star Tales |last=Ridpath |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Ridpath |publisher=self-published | accessdate= 1 April 2014}}</ref>{{efn|1=While parts of the constellation technically rise above the horizon to observers between 41°N and 62°N, stars within a few degrees of the horizon are to all intents and purposes unobservable.<ref name=tirionconst/>}} Its main [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] consists of four stars, and twenty stars in total are brighter than magnitude 6.5.<ref name=tirionconst/> The constellation's boundaries, as set by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a 12-sided polygon.

Caelum is a faint constellation, having no star brighter than fourth [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] and only two brighter than fifth magnitude. Lacaille gave six stars [[Bayer designations]], labeling them Alpha to Zeta in 1756, but omitted Epsilon and designated two nearby stars as Gamma.

=== Deep-sky objects ===
