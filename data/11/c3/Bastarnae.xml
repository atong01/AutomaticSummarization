Relating the Bastarnic invasion of the Balkans of 179 BC (see<space/><link><target>Bastarnae#Conflict with Rome</target><part>Conflict with Rome</part></link><space/>below), he describes them then as &quot;similar in language and customs&quot; to the<space/><link><target>Scordisci</target></link>, a tribe of<space/><link><target>Pannonia</target></link>, whose onomastics and material culture have been identified as Celtic by several scholars.

These emperors followed a policy of large-scale resettlement within the empire of defeated barbarian tribes, granting them land in return for an obligation of military service much heavier than the usual conscription quota. The policy had the triple benefit, from the Roman point of view, of weakening the hostile tribe, repopulating the plague-ravaged frontier provinces (bringing their abandoned fields back into cultivation) and providing a pool of first-rate recruits for the army. But it could also be popular with the barbarian prisoners, who were often delighted by the prospect of a land grant within the empire.
