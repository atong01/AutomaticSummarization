In [[computer science]], the '''Boolean Satisfiability Problem''' (sometimes called '''Propositional Satisfiability Problem''' and abbreviated as '''SATISFIABILITY''' or '''SAT''') is the problem of determining if there exists an [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] that [[Satisfiability|satisfies]] a given [[Boolean logic|Boolean]] [[Formula (mathematical logic)|formula]]. In other words, it asks whether the variables of a given Boolean formula can be consistently replaced by the values TRUE or FALSE in such a way that the formula [[Validity|evaluates to TRUE]]. If this is the case, the formula is called ''satisfiable''. On the other hand, if no such assignment exists, the function expressed by the formula is [[Contradiction#Contradiction in formal logic|identically FALSE]] for all possible variable assignments and the formula is ''unsatisfiable''. For example, the formula "''a'' AND NOT ''b''" is satisfiable because one can find the values ''a''&nbsp;=&nbsp;TRUE and ''b''&nbsp;=&nbsp;FALSE, which make (''a'' AND NOT ''b'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;TRUE. In contrast, "''a'' AND NOT ''a''" is unsatisfiable.

SAT is one of the first problems that was proven to be [[NP-complete]]. This means that all problems in the complexity class [[NP (complexity)|NP]], which includes a wide range of natural decision and optimization problems, are at most as difficult to solve as SAT. There is no known algorithm that efficiently solves SAT, and it is generally believed that no such algorithm exists; yet this belief has not been proven mathematically, and resolving the question whether SAT has an efficient algorithm is equivalent to the [[P versus NP problem]], which is the most famous open problem in the theory of computing.

Despite the fact that no algorithms are known that solve SAT efficiently, correctly, and for all possible input instances, many instances of SAT that occur in practice, such as in [[artificial intelligence]], [[circuit design]] and [[automatic theorem proving]], can actually be solved rather efficiently using heuristical SAT-solvers. Such algorithms are not believed to be efficient on all SAT instances, but experimentally these algorithms tend to work well for many practical applications.

==Basic definitions and terminology==
A '''[[propositional logic]] formula''', also called '''Boolean expression''', is built from [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]], operators AND ([[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], also denoted by ∧), OR ([[logical disjunction|disjunction]], ∨), NOT ([[negation]], ¬), and parentheses.
A formula is said to be '''satisfiable''' if it can be made TRUE by assigning appropriate [[logical value]]s (i.e. TRUE, FALSE) to its variables.
The '''Boolean satisfiability problem''' ('''SAT''') is, given a formula, to check whether it is satisfiable.
This [[decision problem]] is of central importance in various areas of [[computer science]], including [[theoretical computer science]], [[computational complexity theory|complexity theory]], [[algorithmics]], [[cryptography]] and [[artificial intelligence]].

There are several special cases of the Boolean satisfiability problem in which the formulas are required to have a particular structure.
A '''literal''' is either a variable, then called '''positive literal''', or the negation of a variable, then called '''negative literal'''.
A '''clause''' is a disjunction of literals (or a single literal).
A clause is called '''[[Horn clause]]''' if it contains at most one positive literal.
A formula is in '''[[conjunctive normal form]]''' ('''CNF''') if it is a conjunction of clauses (or a single clause).
For example, "''x''<sub>1</sub>" is a positive literal, "¬''x''<sub>2</sub>" is a negative literal, "''x''<sub>1</sub> ∨ ¬''x''<sub>2</sub>" is a clause, and "(''x''<sub>1</sub> ∨ ¬''x''<sub>2</sub>) ∧ (¬''x''<sub>1</sub> ∨ ''x''<sub>2</sub> ∨ ''x''<sub>3</sub>) ∧ ¬''x''<sub>1</sub>" is a formula in conjunctive normal form, its 1st and 3rd clause are Horn clauses, but its 2nd clause is not. The formula is satisfiable, choosing ''x''<sub>1</sub>=FALSE, ''x''<sub>2</sub>=FALSE, and ''x''<sub>3</sub> arbitrarily, since (FALSE ∨ ¬FALSE) ∧ (¬FALSE ∨ FALSE ∨ ''x''<sub>3</sub>) ∧ ¬FALSE evaluates to (FALSE ∨ TRUE) ∧ (TRUE ∨ FALSE ∨ ''x''<sub>3</sub>) ∧ TRUE, and in turn to TRUE ∧ TRUE ∧ TRUE (i.e. to TRUE). In contrast, the CNF formula ''a'' ∧ ¬''a'', consisting of two clauses of one literal, is unsatisfiable, since for ''a''=TRUE and ''a''=FALSE it evaluates to TRUE ∧ ¬TRUE (i.e. to FALSE) and FALSE ∧ ¬FALSE (i.e. again to FALSE), respectively.

For some versions of the SAT problem,
<!---need not list them in detail here---(viz. [[#Exactly-1 3-satisfiability|Exactly-1 3-satisfiability]], [[#XOR-satisfiability|XOR-satisfiability]], and, more general, [[#Schaefer's dichotomy theorem|Schaefer's dichotomy theorem]], discussed below),--->
it is useful to define the notion of a '''generalized conjunctive normal form''' formula, viz. as a conjunction of arbitrarily many '''generalized clauses''', the latter being of the form ''R''(''l''<sub>1</sub>,...,''l''<sub>''n''</sub>) for some boolean operator ''R'' and (ordinary) literals ''l''<sub>''i''</sub>. Different sets of allowed boolean operators lead to different problem versions.
<!---, see [[#Complexity and restricted versions|below]].--->
As an example, ''R''(¬''x'',''a'',''b'') is a generalized clause, and ''R''(¬''x'',''a'',''b'') ∧ ''R''(''b'',''y'',''c'') ∧ ''R''(''c'',''d'',¬''z'') is a generalized conjunctive normal form. This formula is used [[#Exactly-1 3-satisfiability|below]], with ''R'' being the ternary operator that is TRUE just if exactly one of its arguments is.
<!---need not explain that alread yhere---If ''R'' is the ternary operator that is TRUE just if exactly one of its arguments is, then a satisfying assignment for the latter formula can be found starting from every possible combination of truth values for ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', except ''x''=''y''=''z''=FALSE, and choosing the values of ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' appropriately; cf. the left table under [[#Exactly-1 3-satisfiability|Exactly-1 3-satisfiability]] below.--->

Using the laws of [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], every propositional logic formula can be transformed into an equivalent conjunctive normal form, which may, however, be exponentially longer. For example, transforming the formula
(''x''<sub>1</sub>∧''y''<sub>1</sub>) ∨ (''x''<sub>2</sub>∧''y''<sub>2</sub>) ∨ ... ∨ (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>∧''y''<sub>''n''</sub>)
into conjunctive normal form yields
(''x''<sub>1</sub>∨''x''<sub>2</sub>∨…∨''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) ∧
(''y''<sub>1</sub>∨''x''<sub>2</sub>∨…∨''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) ∧
(''x''<sub>1</sub>∨''y''<sub>2</sub>∨…∨''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) ∧
(''y''<sub>1</sub>∨''y''<sub>2</sub>∨…∨''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) ∧ ... ∧
(''x''<sub>1</sub>∨''x''<sub>2</sub>∨…∨''y''<sub>''n''</sub>) ∧
(''y''<sub>1</sub>∨''x''<sub>2</sub>∨…∨''y''<sub>''n''</sub>) ∧ 
(''x''<sub>1</sub>∨''y''<sub>2</sub>∨…∨''y''<sub>''n''</sub>) ∧ 
(''y''<sub>1</sub>∨''y''<sub>2</sub>∨…∨''y''<sub>''n''</sub>); 
while the former is a disjunction of ''n'' conjunctions of 2 variables, the latter consists of 2<sup>''n''</sup> clauses of ''n'' variables.

===Unrestricted satisfiability (SAT)===
{{Main|Cook–Levin theorem}}

SAT was the first known [[NP-complete]] problem, as proved by [[Stephen Cook]] at the [[University of Toronto]] in 1971<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Cook | first1 = Stephen A. | authorlink1=Stephen Cook| title = The Complexity of Theorem-Proving Procedures | pages = 151–158 | year = 1971 | url=http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sacook/homepage/1971.pdf| doi = 10.1145/800157.805047| journal = Proceedings of the 3rd Annual ACM [[Symposium on Theory of Computing]]}}</ref> and independently by [[Leonid Levin]] at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences#The Academy of Sciences of the USSR|National Academy of Sciences]] in 1973.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Levin|first=Leonid|authorlink=Leonid Levin|title = Universal search problems ({{lang-ru|Универсальные задачи перебора}}, Universal'nye perebornye zadachi)|journal = Problems of Information Transmission ({{lang-ru|Проблемы передачи информа́ции}}, Problemy Peredachi Informatsii)|volume = 9|issue = 3|pages = 115–116|year = 1973}} [http://www.mathnet.ru/php/getFT.phtml?jrnid=ppi&paperid=914&volume=9&year=1973&issue=3&fpage=115&what=fullt&option_lang=eng (pdf)] {{ru icon}}, translated into English by {{cite journal|last=Trakhtenbrot|first=B.

The proof shows how every decision problem in the [[complexity class]] [[NP (complexity)|NP]] can be [[reduction (complexity)|reduced]] to the SAT problem for CNF<ref group=note>The SAT problem for ''arbitrary'' formulas is NP-complete, too, since it is easily shown to be in NP, and it cannot be easier than SAT for CNF formulas.</ref> formulas, sometimes called '''CNFSAT'''. 
A useful property of Cook's reduction is that it preserves the number of accepting answers. For example, deciding whether a given [[graph (mathematics)|graph]] has a [[Graph coloring#Vertex coloring|3-coloring]] is another problem in NP; if a graph has 17 valid 3-colorings, the SAT formula produced by the Cook–Levin reduction will have 17 satisfying assignments.

NP-completeness only refers to the run-time of the worst case instances.  Many of the instances that occur in practical applications can be solved much more quickly.  See [[#Algorithms for solving SAT|Algorithms for solving SAT]] below.

SAT is trivial if the formulas are restricted to those in '''[[disjunctive normal form]]''', that is, they are disjunction of conjunctions of literals. Such a formula is indeed satisfiable if and only if at least one of its conjunctions is satisfiable, and a conjunction is satisfiable if and only if it does not contain both ''x'' and NOT ''x'' for some variable ''x''. This can be checked in linear time. Furthermore, if they are restricted to being in '''full disjunctive normal form''', in which every variable appears exactly once in every conjunction, they can be checked in constant time (each conjunction represents one satisfying assignment).  But it can take exponential time and space to convert a general SAT problem to disjunctive normal form; for an example exchange "∧" and "∨" in the [[#Basic definitions and terminology|above]] exponential blow-up example for conjunctive normal forms.

===3-satisfiability===
[[File:Sat reduced to Clique from Sipser.svg|thumb|The 3-SAT instance (''x''∨''x''∨''y'') ∧ (¬''x''∨¬''y''∨¬''y'') ∧ (¬''x''∨''y''∨''y'') reduced to a [[clique problem]]. The green vertices form a 3-clique and correspond to the satisfying assignment ''x''=FALSE, ''y''=TRUE.]]
Like the satisfiability problem for arbitrary formulas, determining the satisfiability of a formula in conjunctive normal form where each clause is limited to at most three literals is NP-complete also; this problem is called '''3-SAT''', '''3CNFSAT''', or '''3-satisfiability'''.
To reduce the unrestricted SAT problem to 3-SAT, transform each clause "''l''<sub>1</sub> ∨ ... ∨ ''l''<sub>''n''</sub>" to a conjunction of ''n'' − 2 clauses 
"(''l''<sub>1</sub> ∨ ''l''<sub>2</sub> ∨ ''x''<sub>2</sub>) ∧
(¬''x''<sub>2</sub> ∨ ''l''<sub>3</sub> ∨ ''x''<sub>3</sub>) ∧ 
(¬''x''<sub>3</sub> ∨ ''l''<sub>4</sub> ∨ ''x''<sub>4</sub>) ∧ ... ∧ 
(¬''x''<sub>''n'' − 3</sub> ∨ ''l''<sub>''n'' − 2</sub> ∨ ''x''<sub>''n'' − 2</sub>) ∧ 
(¬''x''<sub>''n'' − 2</sub> ∨ ''l''<sub>''n'' − 1</sub> ∨ ''l''<sub>n</sub>)", where ''x''<sub>2</sub>,...,''x''<sub>''n'' − 2</sub> are fresh variables not occurring elsewhere.
Although the two formulas are not [[logically equivalent]], they are [[equisatisfiable]]. The formula resulting from transforming all clauses is at most 3 times as long as its original, i.e. the length growth is polynomial.<ref name="Aho.Hopcroft.Ullman.1974">{{cite book| author=Alfred V. Aho, John E. Hopcroft, Jeffrey D. Ullman| title=The Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms| year=1974| publisher=Addison-Wesley}}; here: Thm.10.4</ref>

3-SAT is one of [[Karp's 21 NP-complete problems]], and it is used as a starting point for proving that other problems are also [[NP-hard]].<ref group=note>i.e. at least as hard as every other problem in NP. A decision problem is NP-complete if and only if it is in NP and is NP-hard.</ref> This is done by [[polynomial-time reduction]] from 3-SAT to the other problem. An example of a problem where this method has been used is the [[clique problem]]: given a CNF formula consisting of ''c'' clauses, the corresponding [[Graph (mathematics)|graph]] consists of a vertex for each literal, and an edge between each two non-contradicting<ref group=note>i.e. such that one literal isn't the negation of the other</ref> literals from different clauses, cf. picture. The graph has a ''c''-clique if and only if the formula is satisfiable.{{refn|Aho, Hopcroft, Ullman<ref name="Aho.Hopcroft.Ullman.1974"/> (1974); Thm.10.5}}

There is a simple randomized algorithm due to Schöning (1999) that runs in time (4/3)<sup>''n''</sup> where ''n'' is the number of variables in the 3-SAT proposition, and succeeds with high probability to correctly decide 3-SAT.<ref name="Schoning.1999">{{cite book | last1 = Schöning | first1 = Uwe| chapter = A Probabilistic Algorithm for ''k''-SAT and Constraint Satisfaction Problems | title = Proc. 40th Ann. Symp. Foundations of Computer Science| pages = 410–414 | date=Oct 1999 | url=http://homepages.cwi.nl/~rdewolf/schoning99.pdf| doi = 10.1109/SFFCS.1999.814612}}</ref>

The [[exponential time hypothesis]] asserts that no algorithm can solve 3-SAT (or indeed ''k''-SAT for any ''k > 2'') in time that is fundamentally faster than exp([[Small o notation#Little-o notation|''o'']](''n'')).

Selman, Mitchell, and Levesque (1996) give empirical data on the difficulty of randomly generated 3-SAT formulas, depending on their size parameters.
Difficulty is measured in number recursive calls made by a [[#Algorithms for solving SAT|DPLL algorithm]].<ref>{{cite journal| author=Bart Selman, David Mitchell, Hector Levesque| title=Generating Hard Satisfiability Problems| journal=Artificial Intelligence| year=1996| volume=81| pages=17–29| url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=3CBEAB7E11BF4B2283E9F383810060C1?doi=10.1.1.37.7362&rep=rep1&type=pdf| doi=10.1016/0004-3702(95)00045-3}}</ref>

3-satisfiability can be generalized to '''k-satisfiability''' ('''k-SAT''', also '''k-CNF-SAT'''), when formulas in CNF are considered with each clause containing up to ''k'' literals.
However, since for any ''k''≥3, this problem can neither be easier than 3-SAT nor harder than SAT, and the latter two are NP-complete, so must be k-SAT.

Some authors restrict k-SAT to CNF formulas with '''exactly k literals'''. This doesn't lead to a different complexity class either, as each clause "''l''<sub>1</sub> ∨ ... ∨ ''l''<sub>''j''</sub>" with ''j''<''k'' literals can be padded with fixed dummy variables to
"''l''<sub>1</sub> ∨ ... ∨ ''l''<sub>''j''</sub> ∨ ''d''<sub>''j''+1</sub> ∨ ... ∨ ''d''<sub>''k''</sub>".
After padding all clauses, 2<sup>''k''</sup>-1 extra clauses<ref group=note>viz. all [[Canonical form (Boolean algebra)#Maxterms|maxterms]] that can be built with ''d''<sub>1</sub>,...,''d''<sub>''k''</sub>, except "''d''<sub>1</sub>∨...∨''d''<sub>''k''</sub>"</ref> have to be appended to ensure that only ''d''<sub>1</sub>=...=''d''<sub>k</sub>=FALSE can lead to a satisfying assignment. Since ''k'' doesn't depend on the formula length, the extra clauses lead to a constant increase in length. For the same reason, it does not matter whether '''duplicate literals''' are allowed in clauses (like e.g. "¬''x'' ∨ ¬''y'' ∨ ¬''y''"), or not.

===Exactly-1 3-satisfiability===
[[File:Schaefer's 3-SAT to 1-in-3-SAT reduction.gif|thumb|x100px|'''Left:''' Schaefer's reduction of a 3-SAT clause ''x''∨''y''∨''z''. The result of ''R'' is {{fontcolor|#00a000|TRUE (1)}} if exactly one of its arguments is TRUE, and {{fontcolor|#a00000|FALSE (0)}} otherwise. All 8 combinations of values for ''x'',''y'',''z'' are examined, one per line. The fresh variables ''a'',...,''f'' can be chosen to satisfy all clauses (exactly one {{fontcolor|#00a000|green}} argument for each ''R'') in all lines except the first, where ''x''∨''y''∨''z'' is FALSE. '''Right:''' A simpler reduction with the same properties.]]
A variant of the 3-satisfiability problem is the '''one-in-three 3-SAT''' (also known variously as '''1-in-3-SAT''' and '''exactly-1 3-SAT''').
Given a conjunctive normal form, the problem is to determine whether there exists a truth assignment to the variables so that each clause has ''exactly'' one TRUE literal (and thus exactly two FALSE literals). In contrast, ordinary 3-SAT requires that every clause has ''at least'' one TRUE literal. 
Formally, a one-in-three 3-SAT problem is given as a generalized conjunctive normal form with all generalized clauses using a ternary operator ''R'' that is TRUE just if exactly one of its arguments is. When all literals of a one-in-three 3-SAT formula are positive, the satisfiability problem is called '''one-in-three positive 3-SAT'''.

One-in-three 3-SAT, together with its positive case, is listed as NP-complete problem "LO4" in the standard reference, ''Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness''
by [[Michael R. Garey]] and [[David S. Johnson]].  One-in-three 3-SAT was proved to be NP-complete by [[Thomas J. Schaefer]] as a special case of [[Schaefer's dichotomy theorem]], which asserts that any problem generalizing Boolean satisfiability in a certain way is either in the class P or is NP-complete.<ref name="schaefer">{{Cite conference | last1 = Schaefer | first1 = Thomas J. | last2 = | first2 =  | year = 1978 | title = The complexity of satisfiability problems | booktitle = Proceedings of the 10th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing | place = San Diego, California | journal =  | volume =  | issue =  | pages = 216–226 | publisher =  | jstor =  | url = http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lieber/courses/csg260/f06/materials/papers/max-sat/p216-schaefer.pdf | format =  | accessdate = }}</ref>

Schaefer gives a construction allowing an easy polynomial-time reduction from 3-SAT to one-in-three 3-SAT.  Let "(''x'' or ''y'' or ''z'')" be a clause in a 3CNF formula.  Add six fresh boolean variables ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'', ''e'', and ''f'', to be used to simulate this clause and no other.  
<!---now introduced already above---Let ''R''(''u'',''v'',''w'') be a predicate that is TRUE if and only if exactly one of the booleans ''u'', ''v'', and ''w''
is TRUE.--->
Then the formula ''R''(''x'',''a'',''d'') ∧ ''R''(''y'',''b'',''d'') ∧ ''R''(''a'',''b'',''e'') ∧ ''R''(''c'',''d'',''f'') ∧ ''R''(''z'',''c'',FALSE) is satisfiable by some setting of the fresh variables if and only if at least one of ''x'', ''y'', or ''z'' is TRUE, see picture (left).  Thus any 3-SAT instance with ''m'' clauses and ''n'' variables may be converted into an [[equisatisfiable]] one-in-three 3-SAT instance with 5''m'' clauses and ''n''+6''m'' variables.<ref>(Schaefer, 1978), p.222, Lemma 3.5</ref>
Another reduction involves only four fresh variables and three clauses: ''R''(¬''x'',''a'',''b'') ∧ ''R''(''b'',''y'',''c'') ∧ R(''c'',''d'',¬''z''), see picture (right).

===2-satisfiability===
{{Main|2-satisfiability}}

SAT is easier if the number of literals in a clause is limited to at most 2, in which case the problem is called '''[[2-SAT]]'''. This problem can be solved in polynomial time, and in fact is [[NL-complete|complete]] for the complexity class [[NL (complexity)|NL]]. If additionally all OR operations in literals are changed to [[Exclusive or|XOR]] operations, the result is called '''exclusive-or 2-satisfiability''', which is a problem complete for the complexity class [[SL (complexity)|SL]] = [[L (complexity)|L]].

===Horn-satisfiability===
{{Main|Horn-satisfiability}}

The problem of deciding the satisfiability of a given conjunction of Horn clauses is called '''Horn-satisfiability''', or '''HORN-SAT'''.
It can be solved in polynomial time by a single step of the [[Unit propagation]] algorithm, which produces the single minimal model of the set of Horn clauses (w.r.t. the set of literals assigned to TRUE).
Horn-satisfiability is [[P-complete]]. It can be seen as [[P (complexity)|P's]] version of the Boolean satisfiability problem.

Horn clauses are of interest because they are able to express [[Entailment|implication]] of one variable from a set of other variables. Indeed, one such clause ¬''x''<sub>1</sub> ∨ ... ∨ ¬''x''<sub>''n''</sub> ∨ ''y'' can be rewritten as ''x''<sub>1</sub> ∧ ... ∧ ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> → ''y'', that is, if ''x''<sub>1</sub>,...,''x''<sub>''n''</sub> are all TRUE, then ''y'' needs to be TRUE as well.

A generalization of the class of Horn formulae is that of renamable-Horn formulae, which is the set of formulae that can be placed in Horn form by replacing some variables with their respective negation. 
For example, (''x''<sub>1</sub> ∨ ¬''x''<sub>2</sub>) ∧ (¬''x''<sub>1</sub> ∨ ''x''<sub>2</sub> ∨ ''x''<sub>3</sub>) ∧ ¬''x''<sub>1</sub> is not a Horn formula, but can be renamed to the Horn formula (''x''<sub>1</sub> ∨ ¬''x''<sub>2</sub>) ∧ (¬''x''<sub>1</sub> ∨ ''x''<sub>2</sub> ∨ ¬''y''<sub>3</sub>) ∧ ¬''x''<sub>1</sub> by introducing ''y''<sub>3</sub> as negation of ''x''<sub>3</sub>.
In contrast, no renaming of (''x''<sub>1</sub> ∨ ¬''x''<sub>2</sub> ∨ ¬''x''<sub>3</sub>) ∧ (¬''x''<sub>1</sub> ∨ ''x''<sub>2</sub> ∨ ''x''<sub>3</sub>) ∧ ¬''x''<sub>1</sub> leads to a Horn formula.
Checking the existence of such a replacement can be done in linear time; therefore, the satisfiability of such formulae is in P as it can be solved by first performing this replacement and then checking the satisfiability of the resulting Horn formula.

Another special case is the class of problems where each clause contains XOR (i.e. [[exclusive or]]) rather than (plain) OR operators.<ref group=note>Formally, generalized conjunctive normal forms with a ternary boolean operator ''R'' are employed, which is TRUE just if 1 or 3 of its arguments is. An input clause with more than 3 literals can be transformed into an equisatisfiable conjunction of clauses á 3 literals similar to [[#3-satisfiability|above]]; i.e. XOR-SAT can be reduced to XOR-3-SAT.</ref>
This is in [[P (complexity class)|P]], since an XOR-SAT formula can also be viewed as a system of linear equations mod 2, and can be solved in cubic time by [[Gaussian elimination]];<ref>{{citation|title=The Nature of Computation|first1=Cristopher|last1=Moore|author1-link=Cristopher Moore|first2=Stephan|last2=Mertens|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780199233212|page=366|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=z4zMiZyAE1kC&pg=PA366}}.</ref> see the box for an example. This recast is based on the [[Boolean algebra (structure)#Boolean rings|kinship between Boolean algebras and Boolean rings]], and the fact that arithmetic modulo two forms a [[finite field]]. Since ''a'' XOR ''b'' XOR ''c'' evaluates to TRUE if and only if exactly 1 or 3 members of {''a'',''b'',''c''} are TRUE, each solution of the 1-in-3-SAT problem for a given CNF formula is also a solution of the XOR-3-SAT problem, and in turn each solution of XOR-3-SAT is a solution of 3-SAT, cf. picture. As a consequence, for each CNF formula, it is possible to solve the XOR-3-SAT problem defined by the formula, and based on the result infer either that the 3-SAT problem is solvable or that the 1-in-3-SAT problem is unsolvable.

Provided that the [[P = NP problem|complexity classes P and NP are not equal]], neither 2-, nor Horn-, nor XOR-satisfiability is NP-complete, unlike SAT. The assumption that P and NP are not equal is [[Unsolved problems of mathematics#Millennium Prize Problems|currently not proven]].

===Schaefer's dichotomy theorem===
{{Main|Schaefer's dichotomy theorem}}
The restrictions above (CNF, 2CNF, 3CNF, Horn, XOR-SAT) bound the considered formulae to be conjunctions of subformulae; each restriction states a specific form for all subformulae: for example, only binary clauses can be subformulae in 2CNF.

Schaefer's dichotomy theorem states that, for any restriction to Boolean operators that can be used to form these subformulae, the corresponding satisfiability problem is in P or NP-complete.  The membership in P of the satisfiability of 2CNF, Horn, and XOR-SAT formulae are special cases of this theorem.

==Extensions of SAT==
An extension that has gained significant popularity since 2003 is '''[[Satisfiability modulo theories]]''' ('''SMT''') that can enrich CNF formulas with linear constraints, arrays, all-different constraints, [[uninterpreted function]]s,<ref name="Bryant.German.Velev.1999">R. E. Bryant, S. M. German, and M. N. Velev, [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=709275 Microprocessor Verification Using Efficient Decision Procedures for a Logic of Equality with Uninterpreted Functions], in Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods, pp.&nbsp;1–13, 1999.</ref> ''etc.'' Such extensions typically remain NP-complete, but very efficient solvers are now available that can handle many such kinds of constraints.

The satisfiability problem becomes more difficult if both "for all" (∀) and "there exists" (∃) [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s are allowed to bind the Boolean variables. 
An example of such an expression would be "∀''x'' ∀''y'' ∃''z'' (''x'' ∨ ''y'' ∨ ''z'') ∧ (¬''x'' ∨ ¬''y'' ∨ ¬''z'')"; it is valid, since for all values of ''x'' and ''y'', an appropriate value of ''z'' can be found, viz. ''z''=TRUE if both ''x'' and ''y'' are FALSE, and ''z''=FALSE else.
SAT itself (tacitly) uses only ∃ quantifiers. 
If only ∀ quantifiers are allowed instead, the so-called '''[[Tautology (logic)|tautology]] problem''' is obtained, which is [[co-NP-complete]]. 
If both quantifiers are allowed, the problem is called the '''[[quantified Boolean formula problem]]''' ('''QBF'''), which can be shown to be [[PSPACE-complete]]. It is widely believed that PSPACE-complete problems are strictly harder than any problem in NP, although this has not yet been proved.

A number of variants deal with the number of variable assignments making the formula TRUE. Ordinary SAT asks if there is at least one such assignment. '''MAJ-SAT''', which asks if the majority of all assignments make the formula TRUE, is complete for [[PP (complexity)|PP]], a probabilistic class. The problem of '''how many variable assignments''' satisfy a formula, not a decision problem, is in [[Sharp-P|#P]]. '''UNIQUE-SAT''' is the problem of determining whether a formula has exactly one assignment; it is complete for [[US (complexity)|US]], the [[complexity class]] describing problems solvable by a non-deterministic polynomial time [[Turing machine]] that accepts when there is exactly one nondeterministic accepting path and rejects otherwise.  When the input is [[Promise problem|restricted]] to formulas having at most one satisfying assignment (or none), the problem is called '''UNAMBIGUOUS-SAT'''. A solving algorithm for UNAMBIGUOUS-SAT is allowed to exhibit any behavior, including endless looping, on a formula having several satisfying assignments. Although this problem seems easier, Valiant and Vazirani have [[Valiant-Vazirani theorem|shown]]<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Valiant | first1 = L. | last2 = Vazirani | first2 = V.| doi = 10.1016/0304-3975(86)90135-0 | title = NP is as easy as detecting unique solutions | url = http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall05/cos528/handouts/NP_is_as.pdf| journal = Theoretical Computer Science | volume = 47 | pages = 85–93 | year = 1986 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref> that if there is a practical (i.e. [[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|randomized polynomial-time]]) algorithm to solve it, then all problems in [[NP (complexity class)|NP]] can be solved just as easily.

The '''[[maximum satisfiability problem]]''', an [[FNP (complexity)|FNP]] generalization of SAT, asks for the maximum number of clauses which can be satisfied by any assignment. It has efficient [[approximation algorithm]]s, but is NP-hard to solve exactly. Worse still, it is [[APX]]-complete, meaning there is no [[polynomial-time approximation scheme]] (PTAS) for this problem unless P=NP.

Other generalisations include satisfiability for [[first-order predicate calculus|first]]- and [[second-order logic]], [[constraint satisfaction problem]]s, [[0-1 integer programming]].

==Self-reducibility==
The SAT problem is '''self-reducible''', that is, each algorithm which correctly answers if an instance of SAT is solvable can be used to find a satisfying assignment. First, the question is asked on the given formula Φ. If the answer is "no", the formula is unsatisfiable. Otherwise, the question is asked on the partly instantiated formula Φ[[substitution (logic)|{''x''<sub>1</sub>=TRUE}]], i.e. Φ with the first variable ''x''<sub>1</sub> replaced by TRUE, and simplified accordingly. If the answer is "yes", then ''x''<sub>1</sub>=TRUE, otherwise ''x''<sub>1</sub>=FALSE. Values of other variables can be found subsequently in the same way. In total, ''n''+1 runs of the algorithm are required, where ''n'' is the number of distinct variables in Φ.

This property of self-reducibility is used in several theorems in complexity theory:

: [[NP (complexity)|NP]] ⊆ [[P/poly]] ⇒ [[PH (complexity)|PH]] = [[Polynomial hierarchy#Definitions|Σ<sub>2</sub>]] &nbsp; ([[Karp–Lipton theorem]])
: [[NP (complexity)|NP]] ⊆ [[BPP (complexity)|BPP]] ⇒ [[NP (complexity)|NP]] = [[RP (complexity)|RP]]
: [[P (complexity)|P]] = [[NP (complexity)|NP]] ⇒ [[FP (complexity)|FP]] = [[FNP (complexity)|FNP]]

==Algorithms for solving SAT==

Since the SAT problem is NP-complete, only algorithms with exponential worst-case complexity are known for it. In spite of this state of the art in complexity theory, efficient and scalable algorithms for SAT were developed over the last decade and have contributed to dramatic advances in our ability to automatically solve problem instances involving tens of thousands of variables and millions of constraints (i.e. clauses).<ref>{{citation|title=Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming – CP 2007|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|volume=4741|year=2007|pages=544–558|contribution=Propagation = Lazy Clause Generation|first1=Olga|last1=Ohrimenko|first2=Peter J.|last2=Stuckey|first3=Michael|last3=Codish|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-74970-7_39|quote=modern SAT solvers can often handle problems with millions of constraints and hundreds of thousands of variables}}.</ref> Examples of such problems in [[electronic design automation]] (EDA) include [[formal equivalence checking]], [[model checking]], [[formal verification]] of [[microprocessor|pipelined microprocessors]],<ref name="Bryant.German.Velev.1999"/> [[automatic test pattern generation]], [[routing (electronic design automation)|routing]] of [[FPGA]]s,<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Gi-Joon Nam | last2 = Sakallah | first2 = K.

A. | title = A new FPGA detailed routing approach via search-based Boolean satisfiability | journal = IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 674 | year = 2002 | url = http://cs-rutenbar.web.engr.illinois.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/rutenbar-sattranscad02.pdf| doi = 10.1109/TCAD.2002.1004311}}</ref> [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning]], and [[Scheduling algorithm|scheduling problems]], and so on. A SAT-solving engine is now considered to be an essential component in the [[electronic design automation|EDA]] toolbox.

There are two classes of high-performance [[algorithms]] for solving instances of SAT in practice: the [[Conflict-Driven Clause Learning]] algorithm, which can be viewed as a modern variant of the [[DPLL algorithm]] (well known implementations include [[Chaff algorithm|Chaff]]<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Moskewicz | first1 = M. W. | last2 = Madigan | first2 = C. F. | last3 = Zhao | first3 = Y. | last4 = Zhang | first4 = L. | last5 = Malik | first5 = S. | chapter = Chaff: Engineering an Efficient SAT Solver| title = Proceedings of the 38th conference on Design automation (DAC)| pages = 530 | year = 2001 | isbn = 1581132972 | chapter-url = http://www.princeton.edu/~chaff/publication/DAC2001v56.pdf| doi = 10.1145/378239.379017}}</ref> and [[GRASP (SAT solver)|GRASP]]<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Marques-Silva | first1 = J.

A DPLL SAT solver employs a systematic backtracking search procedure to explore the (exponentially sized) space of variable assignments looking for satisfying assignments. The basic search procedure was proposed in two seminal papers in the early 1960s (see references below) and is now commonly referred to as the [[Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland algorithm]] ("DPLL" or "DLL").<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = M. | last2 = Putnam | first2 = H. | title = A Computing Procedure for Quantification Theory | journal = Journal of the ACM | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 201 | year = 1960 | doi = 10.1145/321033.321034}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = M. |authorlink1=Martin Davis| last2 = Logemann | first2 = G. | last3 = Loveland | first3 = D. | title = A machine program for theorem-proving | journal = [[Communications of the ACM]]| volume = 5 | issue = 7 | pages = 394–397 | year = 1962 | url = http://www.ensiie.fr/~blazy/ipr/article2.pdf| doi = 10.1145/368273.368557}}</ref> Theoretically, exponential lower bounds have been proved for the DPLL family of algorithms.

In contrast, randomized algorithms like the PPSZ algorithm by Paturi, Pudlak, Saks, and Zane set variables in a random order according to some heuristics, for example bounded-width [[Resolution (logic)|resolution]]. If the heuristic can't find the correct setting, the variable is assigned randomly. The PPSZ algorithm has a runtime of <math>O(2^{0.386n})</math> for 3-SAT with a single satisfying assignment. Currently this is the best known runtime for this problem. In the setting with many satisfying assignments the randomized algorithm by Schöning has a better bound.<ref name="Schoning.1999"/><ref name="ppsz_algorithm">[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1066101 "An improved exponential-time algorithm for k-SAT"], Paturi, Pudlak, Saks, Zani</ref>

Modern SAT solvers (developed in the last ten years) come in two flavors: "conflict-driven" and "look-ahead".{{clarify|reason=3 paragraphs before here, 'two classes', viz. 'conflict-driven clause learning DPLL' and 'stochastic local search' were named. Please indicate if the latter essentially means the same as 'look-ahead' here.|date=September 2013}} Conflict-driven solvers augment the basic DPLL search algorithm with efficient conflict analysis, clause learning, non-[[chronological backtracking]] (a.k.a. [[backjumping]]), as well as [["two-watched-literals" unit propagation]], adaptive branching, and random restarts. These "extras" to the basic systematic search have been empirically shown to be essential for handling the large SAT instances that arise in [[electronic design automation]] (EDA).<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Vizel | first1 = Y. | last2 = Weissenbacher | first2 = G. | last3 = Malik | first3 = S. | journal = Proceedings of the IEEE | volume = 103 | issue = 11 | year = 2015 | doi = 10.1109/JPROC.2015.2455034|title=Boolean Satisfiability Solvers and Their Applications in Model Checking}}</ref> Look-ahead solvers have especially strengthened reductions (going beyond unit-clause propagation) and the heuristics, and they are generally stronger than conflict-driven solvers on hard instances (while conflict-driven solvers can be much better on large instances which actually have an easy instance inside).

Modern SAT solvers are also having significant impact on the fields of software verification, constraint solving in artificial intelligence, and operations research, among others. Powerful solvers are readily available as [[free and open source software]]. In particular, the conflict-driven [http://minisat.se/ MiniSAT], which was relatively successful at the [http://www.satcompetition.org/ 2005 SAT competition], only has about 600 lines of code. A modern Parallel SAT solver is [http://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/~jabbour/manysat.htm ManySAT]. It can achieve super linear speed-ups on important classes of problems. An example for look-ahead solvers is [http://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/sat/march_dl.php march_dl], which won a prize at the [http://www.satcompetition.org/ 2007 SAT competition].

Certain types of large random satisfiable instances of SAT can be solved by [[survey propagation]] (SP). Particularly in [[hardware design]] and [[hardware verification|verification]] applications, satisfiability and other logical properties of a given propositional formula are sometimes decided based on a representation of the formula as a [[binary decision diagram]] (BDD).

Almost all SAT solvers include time-outs, so they will terminate in reasonable time even if they cannot find a solution.  
Different SAT solvers will find different instances easy or hard, and some excel at proving unsatisfiability, and others at finding solutions.  
All of these behaviors can be seen in the SAT solving contests.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.satcompetition.org/ |title=The international SAT Competitions web page|accessdate=2007-11-15}}</ref>

=== SAT problem format ===
A SAT problem is often described in the [http://www.domagoj-babic.com/uploads/ResearchProjects/Spear/dimacs-cnf.pdf DIMACS-CNF] format: an input file in which each line represents a single disjunction. For example, a file with the two lines 
 1 -5 4 0
 -1 5 3 4 0
represents the formula "(''x''<sub>1</sub> ∨ ¬''x''<sub>5</sub> ∨ ''x''<sub>4</sub>) ∧ (¬''x''<sub>1</sub> ∨ ''x''<sub>5</sub> ∨ ''x''<sub>3</sub> ∨ ''x''<sub>4</sub>)".

Another common format for this formula is the 7-bit [[ASCII]] representation "(x1 | ~x5 | x4) & (~x1 | x5 | x3 | x4)".
