Srawley wrote:<extension extension_name='blockquote'>This is the earliest occurrence in Christian literature of the phrase 'the Catholic Church' ( ). The original sense of the word is 'universal'. Thus Justin Martyr (<italics>Dial</italics>. 82) speaks of the 'universal or<space/><link><target>general resurrection</target></link>', using the words . Similarly here the Church universal is contrasted with the particular Church of Smyrna. Ignatius means by the Catholic Church 'the aggregate of all the Christian congregations' (Swete,<space/><italics>Apostles Creed</italics>, p. 76). So too the letter of the Church of Smyrna is addressed to all the congregations of the Holy Catholic Church in every place. And this primitive sense of 'universal' the word has never lost, although in the latter part of the<space/><link><target>Christianity in the 2nd century</target><part>second century</part></link><space/>it began to receive the secondary sense of '<link><target>orthodoxy</target><part>orthodox</part></link>' as opposed to '<link><target>heresy</target><part>heretical</part></link>'. Thus it is used in an early<space/><link><target>Biblical Canon</target><part>Canon of Scripture</part></link>, the<space/><link><target>Muratorian fragment</target></link><space/>(<italics>circa</italics><space/>170 A.D.), which refers to certain heretical writings as 'not received in the Catholic Church'. So too<space/><link><target>Cyril of Jerusalem</target></link>, in the<space/><link><target>Christianity in the 4th century</target><part>fourth century</part></link>, says that the Church is called Catholic not only 'because it is spread throughout the world', but also 'because it teaches completely and without defect all the doctrines which ought to come to the knowledge of men'. This secondary sense arose out of the original meaning because Catholics claimed to teach the whole truth, and to represent the whole Church, while heresy arose out of the exaggeration of some one truth and was essentially partial and local.<extension extension_name='ref'>[J.H.

Ignatius said these heretics did not believe in the reality of Christ's flesh, which did suffer and was raised up again: &quot;They confess not the Eucharist to be the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which suffered for our sins, and which the Father, of His goodness, raised up again&quot; (Smyrnaeans, 7) and called them &quot;beasts in the shape of men, whom you must not only not receive, but, if it be possible, not even meet with&quot; (Smyrnaeans, 4).</extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Other second-century uses</heading><paragraph>The term is also used in the<space/><italics><link><target>Martyrdom of Polycarp</target></link></italics><space/>(155) and in the<space/><link><target>Muratorian fragment</target></link><space/>(about 177).</paragraph><heading level='3'>Cyril of Jerusalem</heading><paragraph>As mentioned in the above quotation from J.H.
