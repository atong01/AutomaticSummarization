It is important to assess the underlying problems and to minimize the risk of financial distress to re-occur. It has been stressed that debt advice, a supervised rehabilitation period, financial education and social help to find sources of income and to improve the management of household expenditures need to be equally provided during this period of rehabilitation (Refiner<space/><italics>et al.</italics>, 2003; Gerhardt, 2009; Frade, 2010). In most EU Member States, debt discharge is conditioned by a partial payment obligation and by a number of requirements concerning the debtor's behavior. In the United States (US), discharge is conditioned to a lesser extent. The spectrum is broad in the EU, with the UK coming closest to the US system (Reifner et al., 2003; Gerhardt, 2009; Frade, 2010). The Other Member States do not provide the option of a debt discharge. Spain, for example, passed a bankruptcy law (<italics>ley concurs</italics>) in 2003 which provides for debt settlement plans that can result in a reduction of the debt (maximally half of the amount) or an extension of the payment period of maximally five years (Gerhardt, 2009), but it does not foresee debt discharge.<extension extension_name='ref'>Dubois &amp; Anderson (2010) Managing household debts: Social service provision in the EU.

If the person were to file bankruptcy, he or she is normally encouraged to do so under Chapter 13.</paragraph><paragraph>In order to avoid bankruptcy, one could negotiate with the lender to lower monthly payments, or one could seek student debt consolidation. Student loan bankruptcy is considered a last resort. However, some borrowers find themselves being forced to file bankruptcy, as the lender refused to lower payments, or to lower/freeze interest rates (which grows the debt).</paragraph><paragraph>Chapter 7 bankruptcy is known as &quot;straight&quot; bankruptcy because debtors would legally give up assets/properties to a trustee so that the profits would be given to the unsecured creditors. Chapter 7 is taken as seriously as student loan bankruptcy, and the Court tests the debtor's income to see if he/she is eligible. Otherwise, the Court will dismiss the debtor's filing of bankruptcy, or change it into Chapter 13 or whatever chapter that seems appropriate (with the debtors' consent).<extension extension_name='ref'>See 11 U.S.C. 707(b).</extension><extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-7-bankruptcy-basics</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Chapter 13 bankruptcy is known as the &quot;wage earner's plan.&quot; Individuals with regular income will file under this chapter to repay all or part of debts owed to creditors. The plan usually has a duration of no more than three years unless the judge extends the time, at the judge's discretion. The debtor pays the funds to the trustee, who sends the payments to the creditors. The debtor is allowed to keep his property/assets, and creditors are forbidden to contact/collect money from the debtor while this plan is pending.<extension extension_name='ref'>For more, see 11 U.S.C. 1322(d).</extension><extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-13-bankruptcy-basics</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Chapter 11 bankruptcy is similar to Chapter 13 bankruptcy, as it keeps businesses alive because the owner could repay creditors over the course of time. Owners who file this type of bankruptcy are usually charged $1,167 plus $550 to file in court.

While difficult to generalize across jurisdictions, common criminal acts under bankruptcy statutes typically involve concealment of assets, concealment or destruction of documents, conflicts of interest, fraudulent claims, false statements or declarations, and<space/><link><target>Fee fixing scandal</target><part>fee fixing</part></link><space/>or redistribution arrangements. Falsifications on bankruptcy forms often constitute<space/><link><target>perjury</target></link>.

This is because once a bankruptcy petition is filed, it is for the creditors, not the debtor, to decide whether a particular asset has value. The future ramifications of omitting assets from schedules can be quite serious for the offending debtor. In the United States, a closed bankruptcy may be reopened by motion of a creditor or the U.S. trustee if a debtor attempts to later assert ownership of such an &quot;unscheduled asset&quot; after being discharged of all debt in the bankruptcy. The trustee may then seize the asset and liquidate it for the benefit of the (formerly discharged) creditors. Whether or not a concealment of such an asset should also be considered for prosecution as fraud and/or<space/><link><target>perjury</target></link><space/>would then be at the discretion of the judge and/or U.S. Trustee.</paragraph><heading level='2'>By country</heading><heading level='3'>Argentina</heading><paragraph>In Argentina the national Act &quot;24.522 de Concursos y Quiebras&quot; regulates the Bankruptcy and the Reorganization of the individuals and companies, public entities are not included.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Australia</heading><paragraph>The Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Commonwealth) is the legislation that governs bankruptcy in<space/><link><target>Australia</target></link>.

There are three &quot;parts&quot; of the act under which the vast majority of &quot;acts of bankruptcy&quot; fall. Part IV (Full Bankruptcy), Part IX Debt Agreements and Part X Personal Insolvency Agreements. Agreements refer specifically to arrangements between creditors and debtors, whereas Part IV relates to full bankruptcy and is generally synonymous with &quot;bankruptcy&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>A person or debtor can declare himself or herself bankrupt by lodging a debtor's petition with the Official Receiver, which is the Australian Financial Security Authority (AFSA). A person can also be made bankrupt after a creditor's petition results in the making of a<space/><link><target>Sequestration (law)</target><part>sequestration order</part></link><space/>in the<space/><link><target>Federal Magistrates Court</target></link>. To declare bankruptcy or for a creditors petition to be lodged, a minimum debt of $5,000 is required.</paragraph><paragraph>All bankrupts are required to lodge a Statement of Affairs document with AFSA, which includes important information about their assets and liabilities. A bankruptcy cannot be annulled until this document has been lodged.</paragraph><paragraph>Ordinarily, a Part IV bankruptcy lasts three years from the filing of the Statement of Affairs with AFSA. In the case of a debtor's petition, the Statement of Affairs is filed with the petition and the three-year period commences immediately. However, in the case of a creditor's petition, the Statement of Affairs will rarely be filed on the same day the court order is made. If the bankrupt fails to lodge the document within a certain period of time, he or she can be prosecuted and fined.</paragraph><paragraph>A Bankruptcy Trustee (in most cases this is the Official Receiver) is appointed to deal with all matters regarding the administration of the bankrupt estate. The Trustee's job includes notifying creditors of the estate and dealing with creditor inquiries; ensuring that the bankrupt complies with his or her obligations under the Bankruptcy Act; investigating the bankrupt's financial affairs; realising funds to which the estate is entitled under the Bankruptcy Act and distributing dividends to creditors if sufficient funds become available.</paragraph><paragraph>For the duration of their bankruptcy, all bankrupts have certain restrictions placed upon them under the Act. For example, a bankrupt must obtain the permission of his or her trustee to travel overseas. Failure to do so may result in the bankrupt being stopped at the airport by the Australian Federal Police. Additionally, a bankrupt is required to provide his or her trustee with details of income and assets. If the bankrupt does not comply with the Trustee's request to provide details of income, the trustee may have grounds to lodge an Objection to Discharge, which has the effect of extending the bankruptcy for a further five years.</paragraph><paragraph>The realisation of funds usually comes from two main sources: the bankrupt's assets and the bankrupt's wages. There are certain assets that are protected, referred to as &quot;protected assets&quot;. These include household furniture and appliances, tools of the trade and vehicles up to a certain value. All other assets of value will be sold. If a house or car is above a certain value, the bankrupt can buy the interest back from the estate in order to keep the asset. If the bankrupt does not do this, the interest vests in the estate and the trustee is able to take possession of the asset and sell it.</paragraph><paragraph>The bankrupt will have to pay income contributions if his or her income is above a certain threshold. The threshold is indexed biannually in March and September, and varies according to the number of dependants the bankrupt has. The income contributions liability is calculated by halving the amount of income that exceeds the threshold. If the bankrupt fails to pay the contributions due, the trustee can issue a notice to garnishee the bankrupt's wages. If that is not possible, the Trustee may lodge an Objection to Discharge, effectively extending the bankruptcy for a further five years.</paragraph><paragraph>Bankruptcies can be annulled prior to the expiration of the normal three-year period if all debts are paid out in full. Sometimes a bankrupt may be able to raise enough funds to make an Offer of Composition to creditors, which would have the effect of paying the creditors some of the money they are owed. If the creditors accept the offer, the bankruptcy can be annulled after the funds are received.</paragraph><paragraph>After the bankruptcy is annulled or the bankrupt has been automatically discharged, the bankrupt's credit report status will be shown as &quot;discharged bankrupt&quot; for some years. The number of years varies depending on the company issuing the report, but the report will eventually cease to record that information.</paragraph><paragraph>Certain limited information on Bankruptcy Law in Australia can be found at the AFSA web site.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.afsa.gov.au/<space/></arg><arg name="title">AFSA<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">AFSA<space/></arg><arg name="date">2011-12-31<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2012-04-17</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Brazil</heading><paragraph>In Brazil, the Bankruptcy Law (11.101/05) governs court-ordered or out-of-court receivership and bankruptcy and only applies to public companies (publicly traded companies) with the exception of financial institutions, credit cooperatives, consortia, supplementary scheme entities, companies administering health care plans, equity companies and a few other legal entities.

A consumer proposal is a negotiated settlement between a debtor and their creditors.</paragraph><paragraph>A typical proposal would involve a debtor making monthly payments for a maximum of five years, with the funds distributed to their creditors. Even though most proposals call for payments of less than the full amount of the debt owing, in most cases, the creditors will accept the deal, because if they do not, the next alternative may be personal bankruptcy, where the creditors will get even less money. The creditors have 45 days to accept or reject the consumer proposal. Once the proposal is accepted by both the creditors and the Court, the debtor makes the payments to the Proposal Administrator each month (or as otherwise stipulated in their proposal), and the general creditors are prevented from taking any further legal or collection action. If the proposal is rejected, the debtor is returned to his prior insolvent state and may have no alternative but to declare personal bankruptcy.</paragraph><paragraph>A consumer proposal can only be made by a debtor with debts to a maximum of $250,000 (not including the mortgage on their principal residence).

Corporations and other business forms file under Chapters 7 or 11. Often called &quot;straight bankruptcy&quot; or &quot;simple bankruptcy,&quot; it allows consumers to eliminate just about all of their debts over a period of three or four months. Typically, the only bills that survive a Chapter 7 are student loans, child support obligations, some tax bills and criminal fines. Credit cards, pay day loans, personal loans, medical bills, and just about all other bills are discharged.</paragraph><paragraph>91% of U.S. individuals filing bankruptcy hire an attorney to file their Chapter 7 petition.<extension extension_name='ref' name="uscourts.gov">http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/Statistics/BankruptcyStatistics/BAPCPA/2013/Tables2A-2X.pdf</extension><space/>The typical cost of an attorney is $1,170.00.<extension extension_name='ref' name="uscourts.gov"></extension><space/>Alternatives to filing with an attorney are: filing pro se, meaning without an attorney, which requires an individual to fill out at least sixteen separate forms,<extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.uscourts.gov/FormsAndFees/Forms/BankruptcyForms.aspx</extension><space/>hiring a petition preparer (which have a track record of shoddy work and unsuccessful cases),<extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/13/us/preparing-petitions-it-irks-the-lawyers-but-is-it-lawyering.html</extension><space/>or using online software to generate the petition.</paragraph><paragraph>In Chapter 7, a debtor surrenders his or her non-exempt property to a bankruptcy trustee who then liquidates the property and distributes the proceeds to the debtor's unsecured creditors. In exchange, the debtor is entitled to a discharge of some debt; however, the debtor will not be granted a discharge if he or she is guilty of certain types of inappropriate behavior (e.g., concealing records relating to financial condition) and certain debts (e.g., spousal and child support, most student loans). Some taxes will not be discharged even though the debtor is generally discharged from his or her debt. Many individuals in financial distress own only exempt property (e.g., clothes, household goods, an older car, or the tools of their trade or profession) and will not have to surrender any property to the trustee.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">November 2014</arg></template><space/>The amount of property that a debtor may exempt varies from state to state (as noted above, Virginia and Maryland have a $1,000 difference.) Chapter 7 relief is available only once in any eight-year period. Generally, the rights of secured creditors to their collateral continues even though their debt is discharged. For example, absent some arrangement by a debtor to surrender a car or &quot;reaffirm&quot; a debt, the creditor with a<space/><link><target>security interest</target></link><space/>in the debtor's car may repossess the car even if the debt to the creditor is discharged.</paragraph><paragraph>The 2005 amendments to the Bankruptcy Code introduced the &quot;means test&quot; for eligibility for chapter 7. An individual who fails the means test will have his or her chapter 7 case dismissed or may have to convert his or her case to a case under chapter 13.</paragraph><paragraph>Generally, a trustee will sell most of the debtor's assets to pay off creditors. However, certain assets of the debtor are protected to some extent. For example, Social Security payments, unemployment compensation, and limited values of equity in a home, car, or truck, household goods and appliances, trade tools, and books are protected. However, these exemptions vary from state to state.</paragraph><paragraph>In Chapter 13, the debtor retains ownership and possession of all of his or her assets, but must devote some portion of his or her future income to repaying creditors, generally over a period of three to five years. The amount of payment and the period of the repayment plan depend upon a variety of factors, including the value of the debtor's property and the amount of a debtor's income and expenses. Secured creditors may be entitled to greater payment than unsecured creditors.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="title">Chapter 13 Bankruptcy.</arg><arg name="url">http://www.taieblaw.com/chapter-13-bankruptcy.php</arg><arg name="accessdate">April 22, 2014</arg><arg name="date">27 January 2014</arg><arg name="publisher">Taieb Law</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Relief under Chapter 13 is available only to individuals with regular income whose debts do not exceed prescribed limits. If you are an individual or a sole proprietor, you are allowed to file for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy to repay all or part of your debts. Under this chapter, you can propose a repayment plan in which to pay your creditors over three to five years. If your monthly income is less than the state's median income, your plan will be for three years unless the court finds &quot;just cause&quot; to extend the plan for a longer period. If your monthly income is greater than your state's median income, the plan must generally be for five years. A plan cannot exceed the five-year limitation.</paragraph><paragraph>In contrast to Chapter 7, the debtor in Chapter 13 may keep all of his or her property, whether or not exempt. If the plan appears feasible and if the debtor complies with all the other requirements, the bankruptcy court will typically confirm the plan and the debtor and creditors will be bound by its terms. Creditors have no say in the formulation of the plan other than to object to the plan, if appropriate, on the grounds that it does not comply with one of the Code's statutory requirements. Generally, the payments are made to a trustee who in turn disburses the funds in accordance with the terms of the confirmed plan.</paragraph><paragraph>When the debtor completes payments pursuant to the terms of the plan, the court will formally grant the debtor a discharge of the debts provided for in the plan. However, if the debtor fails to make the agreed upon payments or fails to seek or gain court approval of a modified plan, a bankruptcy court will often dismiss the case on the motion of the trustee. Pursuant to the dismissal, creditors will typically resume pursuit of state law remedies to the extent a debt remains unpaid.</paragraph><paragraph>In Chapter 11, the debtor retains ownership and control of assets and is re-termed a<space/><italics>debtor in possession</italics><space/>(DIP). The debtor in possession runs the day-to-day operations of the business while creditors and the debtor work with the Bankruptcy Court in order to negotiate and complete a plan. Upon meeting certain requirements (e.g., fairness among creditors, priority of certain creditors) creditors are permitted to vote on the proposed plan. If a plan is confirmed the debtor will continue to operate and pay its debts under the terms of the confirmed plan. If a specified majority of creditors do not vote to confirm a plan, additional requirements may be imposed by the court in order to confirm the plan.

The law will also allow us to clamp down on bankruptcy mills that make their money by advising abusers on how to [[game the system]].</arg><arg><ref>Press Release, White House, [http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/04/20050420-5.html "President Signs Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention, Consumer Protection Act"] (April 20, 2005).

These claims turned out to be false. After BAPCPA passed, although credit card company losses decreased, prices charged to customers increased, and credit card company profits soared.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Credit Card">Michael Simkovic,<space/><link type='external' href='http://ssrn.com/abstract=1157158'>&quot;The Effect of BAPCPA on Credit Card Industry Profits and Prices&quot;</link><space/>Berkeley Business Law Journal, Vol. 6, No. 1, Spring 2009</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Among its many changes to consumer bankruptcy law, BAPCPA enacted a &quot;means test&quot;, which was intended to make it more difficult for a significant number of financially distressed individual debtors whose debts are primarily consumer debts to qualify for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. The &quot;means test&quot; is employed in cases where an individual with primarily consumer debts has more than the average annual income for a household of equivalent size, computed over a 180-day period prior to filing. If the individual must &quot;take&quot; the &quot;means test&quot;, their average monthly income over this 180 day period is reduced by a series of allowances for living expenses and secured debt payments in a very complex calculation that may or may not accurately reflect that individual's actual monthly budget. If the results of the means test show no disposable income (or in some cases a very small amount) then the individual qualifies for Chapter 7 relief. If a debtor does not qualify for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, either because of the Means Test or because Chapter 7 does not provide a permanent solution to delinquent payments for secured debts, such as mortgages or vehicle loans, the debtor may still seek relief under Chapter 13 of the Code. A Chapter 13 plan often does not require repayment to general unsecured debts, such as credit cards or medical bills.</paragraph><paragraph>BAPCPA also requires individuals seeking bankruptcy relief to undertake<space/><link><target>credit counselling</target></link><space/>with approved counseling agencies prior to filing a bankruptcy petition and to undertake education in personal financial management from approved agencies prior to being granted a discharge of debts under either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13. Some studies of the operation of the credit counseling requirement suggest that it provides little benefit to debtors who receive the counseling because the only realistic option for many is to seek relief under the Bankruptcy Code.<extension extension_name='ref'>Jones, Yvonne D.

In<space/><link><target>France</target></link>, company insolvencies rose by more than 4%, in<space/><link><target>Austria</target></link><space/>by more than 10%, and in<space/><link><target>Greece</target></link><space/>by more than 20%. The increase in the number of insolvencies, however, does not indicate the total financial impact of insolvencies in each country because there is no indication of the size of each case. An increase in the number of bankruptcy cases does not necessarily entail an increase in bad debt write-off rates for the economy as a whole.</paragraph><paragraph>Bankruptcy statistics are also a trailing indicator. There is a time delay between financial difficulties and bankruptcy. In most cases, several months or even years pass between the financial problems and the start of bankruptcy proceedings. Legal, tax, and cultural issues may further distort bankruptcy figures, especially when comparing on an international basis. Two examples:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>In<space/><link><target>Austria</target></link>, more than half of all potential bankruptcy proceedings in 2004 were not opened, due to insufficient funding.</listitem><listitem>In<space/><link><target>Spain</target></link>, it is not economically profitable to open insolvency/bankruptcy proceedings against certain types of businesses, and therefore the number of insolvencies is quite low. For comparison: In<space/><link><target>France</target></link>, more than 40,000 insolvency proceedings were opened in 2004, but under 600 were opened in Spain. At the same time the average bad debt write-off rate in France was 1.3% compared to Spain with 2.6%.</listitem></list><paragraph>The insolvency numbers for private individuals also do not show the whole picture. Only a fraction of heavily indebted households will decide to file for insolvency. Two of the main reasons for this are the stigma of declaring themselves insolvent and the potential business disadvantage.</paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:20090113 bankruptcy-01.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Cartoosh's View: '''Bankruptcy judge to<space/><link><target>Uncle Sam</target></link>''': Sorry, I have found no laws that would allow you to file for bankruptcy...</part></link><template><target>Col div</target><arg>3</arg></template></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Bankruptcy Act</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Bankruptcy alternatives</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Creditor's rights</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Debt consolidation</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Debt relief</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Debt restructuring</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Debtor in possession</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Default (finance)</target><part>Default</part></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>DIP Financing</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Distressed securities</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Financial distress</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Individual voluntary arrangement</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Insolvency</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Judicial estoppel</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Liquidation</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Protected trust deed</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Sole Trader Insolvency</target></link><space/>(UK)</listitem><listitem><link><target>Stalking Horse Agreement</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Tools of trade</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Turnaround ADR</target></link></listitem></list><paragraph><template><target>Col div end</target></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>Reflist</target><arg>2</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>Further reading</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><template><target>Cite book</target><arg name="last"><space/>Balleisen<space/></arg><arg name="first"><space/>Edward</arg><arg name="authorlink"><space/></arg><arg name="coauthors"><space/></arg><arg name="title">Navigating Failure: Bankruptcy and Commercial Society in Antebellum America</arg><arg name="year">2001<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">University of North Carolina Press</arg><arg name="location"><space/>Chapel Hill<space/></arg><arg name="isbn"><space/>0-8078-2600-6</arg><arg name="page">322</arg></template></listitem><listitem><template><target>Cite book</target><arg name="last"><space/>DePamphilis<space/></arg><arg name="first"><space/>Donald M.</arg><arg name="authorlink"><space/></arg><arg name="coauthors"><space/></arg><arg name="title">Mergers, Acquisitions, and Other Restructurings, 5th Edition</arg><arg name="year">2009<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Elsevier, Academic Press</arg><arg name="location"><space/></arg><arg name="isbn"><space/>978-0-12-374878-2</arg><arg name="pages"></arg></template></listitem><listitem><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="last">Mańko</arg><arg name="first">Rafał</arg><arg name="title">Cross-border insolvency law in the EU</arg><arg name="url">http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/bibliotheque/briefing/2013/130476/LDM_BRI(2013)130476_REV1_EN.pdf</arg><arg name="work">Library Briefing</arg><arg name="publisher">Library of the European Parliament</arg><arg name="accessdate">21 February 2013</arg></template></listitem><listitem><template><target>Cite book</target><arg name="last">Sandage<space/></arg><arg name="first">Scott A.<space/></arg><arg name="authorlink"><space/></arg><arg name="coauthors"><space/></arg><arg name="title">Born Losers: A History of Failure in America<space/></arg><arg name="year">2006<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Harvard University Press<space/></arg><arg name="location">Cambridge, Mass.<space/></arg><arg name="isbn">0-674-02107-X<space/></arg><arg name="pages"></arg></template></listitem><listitem><template><target>cite encyclopedia</target><arg name="last1"><space/>Zywicki<space/></arg><arg name="first1">Todd J.<space/></arg><arg name="authorlink1"><space/>Todd Zywicki<space/></arg><arg name="editor"><space/>[[David R.
