'''Apus''' is a faint [[constellation]] in the southern sky, first defined in the late 16th century. Its name means "no feet" in [[Greek language|Greek]], and it represents a [[bird-of-paradise]] (which were once believed to lack feet).  Its [[genitive]] is "Apodis".

==History==
Apus was one of twelve constellations created by [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]].  It first appeared on a 35&nbsp;cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 or 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius with [[Jodocus Hondius]].<ref name="ridpath"/>{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=76-77}}<ref name="UT">{{cite web |url = http://www.universetoday.com/19562/apus/ |title = Apus |last = Plotner |first = Tammy |publisher = Universe Today |date = 13 October 2008 |accessdate = 22 April 2012}}</ref>  Plancius called the constellation ''Paradysvogel Apis Indica''; the first word is [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for "bird of paradise", of genus [[Pteridophora]], but the others are [[Latin]] for "Indian Bee". ''Apis'' (Latin for "bee") is presumably an error for ''avis'' ("bird").<ref name="ridpath">{{cite web |url = http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/apus.htm |title = Apus |last = Ridpath |first = Ian |work = Star Tales |accessdate = 10 April 2012}}</ref><ref name="UT"/>

The name ''Apus'' is derived from the Greek ''apous'', meaning "without feet".  This referred to the Western misconception that the bird-of-paradise had no feet, which arose because the only specimens available in the West had their feet and wings removed.<ref name="ridpath"/> Such specimens began to arrive in Europe in 1522, when the survivors of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s expedition brought them home.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=252}}

After its introduction on Plancius's globe, the constellation's first known appearance in a celestial atlas was in [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603, where it was called "Apis Indica".<ref name="ridpath"/><ref name="UT"/>

Richard Allen reports Semler's assertion that de Houtman, who observed the southern constellations from the island of Sumatra, took his ideas for the formation of Apus (as well as [[Phoenix (constellation)|Phoenix]] and [[Indus_(constellation)|Indus]]) from the Chinese, who knew the stars of Apus as the "Little Wonder Bird",<ref>Richard H. Allen (1899) Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning, p. 45 <http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Topics/astronomy/_Texts/secondary/ALLSTA/Apus*.html></ref> and that Semler's assertion was disputed by Ideler (though Ideler acknowledged the Chinese constellations).
