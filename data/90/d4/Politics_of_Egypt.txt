{{Politics of Egypt}} 
{{See also|2013 Egyptian coup d'état}}
The '''politics of [[Egypt]]''' is based on [[republicanism]], with a [[semi-presidential system]] of government. Following the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011]], and the resignation of [[President of Egypt|President]] [[Hosni Mubarak]], executive power was assumed by the [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]], which dissolved the [[Parliament of Egypt|parliament]] and suspended the [[constitution]]. In 2012, [[Mohamed Morsi]] was [[Egyptian presidential election, 2012|elected]] as Egypt's fifth [[President of Egypt|president]] but was [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état|deposed]] by army chief General [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] who was subsequently elected as Egypt's sixth president in 2014.<ref name=ao8June>{{cite news|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/103147.aspx|title=El-Sisi sworn in as Egypt president|date=8 June 2014|accessdate=8 June 2014|publisher=Ahram Online}}</ref>

==Presidency==
{{Main|President of Egypt}}

Under the new regulations of the March 2011 referendum, the president is limited to two four-year terms, with the [[Judiciary of Egypt|Judiciary]] supervising the elections. The president is required to appoint a deputy, and a commission will draft a new constitution following the parliamentary election. Candidates must provide 30,000 signatures from at least 15 provinces, or 30 members of a chamber of the legislature, or nomination by a party holding at least one seat in the legislature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/commission-announces-proposed-changes-egyptian-constitution|title=Commission announces proposed changes to Egyptian Constitution|publisher=Egypt Independent|date=26 February 2011|accessdate=19 January 2014}}</ref>

Following the convening of the newly elected People’s Assembly and Maglis al-Shura in March 2012, a committee was to draft a new constitution to replace the pre-revolutionary one, followed by presidential elections. However, the [[Egyptian presidential election, 2012]] occurred without a new constitution. The military council, which took power in early 2011, promised a fair and civilian vote. The first round of the election took place on 23 May and 24 May 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18167224|title=Egyptians vote in landmark presidential election|publisher=BBC|date=23 May 2012|accessdate=19 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Bassem|first=Sabry|title=Quick Guide: The lowdown on Egypt's presidential frontrunners|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/36/122/42031/Presidential-elections-/Presidential-elections-news/-Quick-Guide-The-lowdown-on-Egypts-presidential-fr.aspx|date=20 May 2012|accessdate=19 January 2014|publisher=Ahram Online}}</ref> It was followed by a run-off on 16 June and 17 June<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/17/world/la-fg-egypt-election-20120617|title=Egypt runoff presidential election kicks off sullenly|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=17 June 2012|accessdate=19 January 2014}}</ref> which [[Mohamed Morsi]] won. He assumed office 30 June 2012.

On 3 July 2013, the constitution of Egypt was suspended and Morsi was ousted from the presidency. [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] was elected in the [[Egyptian presidential election, 2014|2014 presidential election]].<ref name=ao8June/>

==Legislative Branch==
{{main|History of Parliamentary life in Egypt}}
[[Parliament of Egypt|Parliament]] meets for one eight-month session each year; under special circumstances the President of the Republic can call an additional session. Even though the powers of the Parliament have increased since the 1980 Amendments of the Constitution, the Parliament continues to lack the powers to balance the extensive powers of the President.

===The People’s Assembly (Maglis El-Shaab)===
The [[House of Representatives (Egypt)|House of Representatives]] is the principal legislative body.  Out of the assembly’s 567 representatives, 540 are directly elected while 27 may be appointed by the President (though the law is not yet approved by the president).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.aswatmasriya.com/news/view.aspx?id=d1c74bd4-fc9f-416d-9507-7c7585506bd4|title=Cabinet preliminarily passes law regulating electoral districts|publisher=Aswat Masriya|date=10 December 2014|accessdate=10 December 2014}}</ref>  The assembly sits for a five-year term but can be dissolved earlier by the President. All seats are voted on in each election. Four hundred seats are voted on using [[proportional representation]] while the remaining forty-four are elected in local majority votes. The Constitution reserves fifty percent of The People’s Assembly may force the resignation of the executive cabinet by voting a motion of censure. For this reason, the [[Prime Minister of Egypt|Prime Minister]] and his cabinet are necessarily from the dominant party or coalition in the assembly. In the case of a president and  assembly from opposing parties, this leads to the situation known as [[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]].

The People's Assembly was dissolved with the abrogation of the constitution in February 2011. The first round of new elections is scheduled to start on 28 November 2011, the second round was held on 14 December 2011, the third on 3 January 2012 and the new assembly convened on 17 March 2012.<ref name=afp>{{cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g5BSkdO3TcP9CsIRc--wEe9AVB7g?docId=CNG.4e9dd22c6965a9c01668d330c7cc2b7e.881|title=Egypt elections to start on November 28|publisher=AFP|date=27 September 2011|accessdate=19 January 2014}}</ref> Nomination for the elections started on 12 October 2012. 70% of the 498 parliamentary seats will be based on the party list system and the remaining 30% through individual-candidate voting, according to official news agency MENA. "Egypt will be divided into 60 constituencies in accordance to the decree, 30 for the party lists system in which each list must include at least a woman candidate while the other 30 for the individual-candidate system in which the candidate shouldn't be affiliated to any political party."<ref name=xinhua>{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-09/27/c_131163534.htm|title=Egypt to hold parliamentary elections on Nov. 28|publisher=Xinhua|date=27 September 2011|accessdate=19 January 2014}}</ref> The reservation of 30 seats simple majority seats for independent candidates is controversial.<ref name=afp/>

===The Consultative Council (Maglis El-Shura)===
The [[Shura Council (Egypt)|Shura Council]] was the 264-member upper house of Parliament created in 1980. In the Shura Council 176 members were directly elected and 88 members were appointed by the President of the Republic for six-year terms. One half of the Shura Council was renewed every three years.

The Shura Council's legislative powers were limited. On most matters of legislation, the People’s Assembly retained the last word in the event of a disagreement between the two houses.

The Shura Council was dissolved with the abrogation of the constitution in February 2011. After the 2011 Egyptian revolution, three round elections for the new 270 seat Shura Council started on 29 January 2012 and ended on 11 March 2012.<ref name=afp/><ref name=xinhua/>

The Shura Council was removed from the draft copy of the 2014 constitution.<ref>{{cite web|title=50 member constitution committee eliminates Shura Council|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/87991/Egypt/Politics-/-member-constitution-committee-eliminates-Shura-Co.aspx|publisher=Ahram Online|date=1 December 2013|accessdate=19 January 2014}}</ref> The abolition of the council has been finalized with the passage of the constitution.<ref>{{cite web|title=Egypt constitution 'approved by 98.1 percent'|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/01/egypt-constitution-approved-981-percent-201411816326470532.html|publisher=Al Jazeera English|date=18 January 2014|accessdate=19 January 2014}}</ref>

===Parliamentary elections===
There were eighteen recognized political parties from across the political spectrum. The formation of political parties based on religion is prohibited by the Constitution. The official opposition and political pressure groups, like the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], were active in Egypt and made their views public. They are represented at various levels in the political system. Prior to the revolution, power was concentrated in the hands of the President of the Republic and the [[National Democratic Party (Egypt)|National Democratic Party]] which retained a [[super-majority]] in the People's Assembly.

The [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2000|November 2000 parliamentary elections]] were generally regarded to have been more transparent and better executed than past elections due to judicial monitoring of polling stations. Opposition parties continued to complain about electoral manipulation by the government, and many Egyptians felt their votes were monitored by poll workers, and could face retribution.  There were significant restrictions on the political process and freedom of expression for non-governmental organizations, including professional syndicates and organizations promoting respect for human rights.

With the abrogation of the constitution in February 2011, parliament was dissolved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/14/world/middleeast/14egypt.html?pagewanted=all|publisher=New York Times|title=Egyptian Military Dissolves Parliament|date=13 February 2011|accessdate=19 January 2014}}</ref> Many [[List of political parties in Egypt|new political parties]] formed in anticipation of running candidates in the [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2011–2012]].

Below the national level, authority is exercised by and through governors and mayors appointed by the central government and by popularly elected local councils.

==Military Council==
{{Main|Supreme Council of the Armed Forces}}
Following the 11 February 2011 resignation of president [[Hosni Mubarak]], Egypt came under the authority of the [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]], commonly referred to as the Military Council. It was headed by Field Marshal [[Mohamed Hussein Tantawi]]. The council was intended to be transitional, surrendering its state powers to the president following the [[Egyptian presidential election, 2012|election in May]].

==Political parties and elections==
{{Main|List of political parties in Egypt|Elections in Egypt}}
According to the [[Constitution of Egypt|Egyptian Constitution]], political parties are allowed to exist. Religious political parties are not allowed as it would not respect the [[separation of church and state|principle of non-interference of religion in politics]] and that religion has to remain in the private sphere to respect all beliefs. Also forbidden are political parties supporting militia formations or having an agenda that is contradictory to the constitution and its principles, or threatening the country's stability such as national unity between Muslim Egyptians and [[Copts|Christian Egyptians]].

As of 2012, there are more than 40 registered political parties in Egypt. The largest are [[Freedom and Justice Party (Egypt)|Freedom and Justice Party]], [[al-Nour Party]], [[New Wafd Party]], [[Free Egyptians Party]], [[Justice Party (Egypt)|Justice Party]], [[Wasat Party]], and the [[Egyptian Social Democratic Party]].

{{Life in Egypt}}

On 14 June 2012, the [[Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt]] ordered the People's Assembly to be dissolved, citing irregularities in the election of members.

==Civil society==
{{See also|Emergency law in Egypt}}
[[Egyptians]] had been living under emergency law since 1967, except for an 18-month break in 1980, until 31 May 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Egypt lifts unpopular emergency law|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/05/31/world/africa/egypt-emergency-law/index.html|publisher=CNN|date=2 June 2012|accessdate=19 January 2014|author=CNN Wire Staff}}</ref> Emergency laws have been continuously extended every three years since 1981. These laws sharply circumscribe any non-governmental political activity: street demonstrations, non-approved political organizations, and un-registered financial donations are formally banned. Nonetheless, since 2000, these restrictions have been violated in practice. In 2003, the agenda shifted heavily towards local democratic reforms, opposition to the succession of [[Gamal Mubarak]] as president, and rejection of violence by state security forces. Groups involved in the latest wave include PCSPI, the Egyptian Movement for Change ([[Kefaya]]), and the Association for Egyptian Mothers.

Substantial peasant activism exists on a variety of issues, especially related to [[land rights]] and [[land reform]]. A major flash point was the 1997 repeal of [[Egyptian land reform|Nasser-era land reform policies]] under pressure for [[structural adjustment]]. A pole for this activity is the Land Center for Human Rights.

The [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011]], inspired by the recent revolution in [[Tunisia]], forced the resignation of President Mubarak and the Military Junta that succeeded him abrogated the Constitution and promised free and fair elections under a new one.

==Political pressure groups and leaders==
Before the revolution, Mubarak tolerated limited political activity by the Brotherhood for his first two terms, but then moved more aggressively  to block its influence (arguably leading to its recent rise in public support). Trade unions and professional associations are officially sanctioned. In 2014, in Upper Egypt, several newspapers reported that the region of Upper Egypt wants to secede from Egypt to try to improve living standards.<ref name="Is Egypt Breaking Apart?">{{cite web | url=http://www.iar-gwu.org/content/egypt-breaking-apart | title=Is Egypt Breaking Apart? | publisher=International Affairs Review | date=17 February 2014 | accessdate=18 February 2014 | author=Gratowski,   J. Thomas}}</ref>

==Foreign relations==
{{main|Foreign relations of Egypt}}
The permanent headquarters for the [[League of Arab States]] (The Arab League) is located in Cairo. The Secretary General of the League has traditionally been an Egyptian. Former Egyptian Foreign Minister Nabil El-Araby is the present Secretary General of the Arab League. The Arab League moved out of Egypt to Tunis in 1978 as a protest at the peace treaty with Israel, but returned in 1989.

Egypt was the first Arab state to establish diplomatic relations with the state of Israel, after the signing of the [[Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty]] at the [[Camp David Accords (1978)|Camp David Accords]]. Egypt has a major influence amongst other Arab states, and has historically played an important role as a mediator in resolving disputes between various Arab nations, and in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. Most Arab nations still give credence to Egypt playing that role, though its effects are often limited.

Former Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] served as Secretary General of the United Nations from 1991 to 1996.

A territorial dispute with Sudan over an area known as the [[Hala'ib Triangle]], has meant that diplomatic relations between the two remain strained.
