'''Eusebius Amort''' (November 15, 1692 – February 5, 1775) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Roman Catholic]] [[theology|theologian]].

==Life==
Amort was born at Bibermuhle, near [[Tolz]], in Upper [[Bavaria]].  He studied at [[Munich]], and at an early age joined the [[Canons Regular]] at [[Polling Abbey|Polling]], where, shortly after his ordination in 1717, he taught theology and [[philosophy]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
The [[Parnassus Boicus]] learned society was based on a plan started in 1720 by three Augustian fathers. Eusebius Amort, Gelasius Hieber (1671-1731), a famous preacher in the [[German language]] and Agnellus Kandler (1692-1745), a genealogist and librarian. The initial plans fell through, but in 1722 they issued the first number of the ''Parnassus Boicus'' journal, communicating interesting information from the arts and sciences.{{sfn|Blackall|1954|p=98}}

In 1733 Amort went to [[Rome]] as theologian to [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Niccolo Maria Lercari]] (d. 1757).
He returned to Polling in 1735 and devoted the rest of his life to the revival of learning in Bavaria.  He died at Polling in 1775.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Works==
Amort, who had the reputation of being the most learned man of his age, was a voluminous writer on every conceivable subject, from [[poetry]] to [[astronomy]], from dogmatic theology to [[mysticism]].  His best known works are:

*A manual of theology in 4 vols, ''Theologia eclectica, moralis et scholastica'' (Augsburg, 1752; revised by [[Pope Benedict XIV]] for the 1753 edition published at Bologna)
*A defence of Catholic doctrine, entitled ''Demonstratio critica religionis Catholicae'' (Augsburg, 1751)
*A work on indulgences, which has often been criticized by [[Protestant]] writers, ''De Origine, Progressu, Valore, et Fructu Indulgentiorum'' (Augsburg, 1735)
*A treatise on mysticism, ''De Revelationibus et Visionibus, etc.'' (2 vols, 1744)
*The astronomical work ''Nova philosophiae planetarum et artis criticae systemata'' (Nuremberg, 1723).

The list of his other works, including his three erudite contributions to the question of authorship of the ''Imitatio Christi'', will be found in [[C. Toussaint]]'s scholarly article in [[Alfred Vacant]]'s ''Dictionnaire de theologie'' (1900, cols 1115-1117).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
