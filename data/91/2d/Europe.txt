Europe is now generally defined by geographers as the western part of Eurasia, with its boundaries marked by large bodies of water to the north, west and south; Europe's limits to the far east are usually taken to be the Urals, the [[Ural River]], and the [[Caspian Sea]]; to the southeast, including the [[Caucasus Mountains]], the [[Black Sea]] and the waterways connecting the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea.<ref name="Encarta">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopaedia 2007|title=Europe|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopaedia_761570768/Europe.html|accessdate=27 December 2007|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwbxqnne|archivedate=31 October 2009|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

Islands are generally grouped with the nearest continental landmass, hence [[Iceland]] is generally considered to be part of Europe, while the nearby island of [[Greenland]] is usually assigned to [[North America]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Europa copy.jpg|thumb|[[Europa (mythology)|Europa]] and the [[Bull (mythology)|bull]] on a Greek vase. Tarquinia Museum, c. 480 BC]]
In ancient [[Greek mythology]], [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]] was a [[Phoenicia]]n princess whom [[Zeus]] abducted after assuming the form of a dazzling white bull. He took her to the island of [[Crete]] where she gave birth to [[Minos]], [[Rhadamanthus]], and [[Sarpedon]]. For [[Homer]], Europe ({{lang-grc|Εὐρώπη}}, ''{{Unicode|Eurṓpē}}''; see also [[List of Greek place names]]) was a mythological queen of Crete, not a geographical designation.

The etymology of ''Europe'' is uncertain.<ref>Minor theories, such as the (probably folk-etymological) one deriving Europa from εὐρώς (''gen''.: εὐρῶτος) "mould" are not discussed in the section</ref> One theory suggests that it is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] εὐρύς (''eurus''), meaning "wide, broad"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Deu%29ru%2Fs εὐρύς], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> and ὤψ/ὠπ-/ὀπτ- (''ōps''/''ōp''-/''opt-''), meaning "eye, face, countenance",<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dw%29%2Fy ὤψ], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> hence ''{{Unicode|Eurṓpē}}'', "wide-gazing", "broad of aspect" (compare with [[Athena#Cult and attributes|''glauk'''ōp'''is'' (γλαυκῶπις 'grey-eyed') Athena]] or [[Hera|''bo'''ōp'''is'' (βοὠπις 'ox-eyed') Hera]]). ''Broad'' has been an [[epithet]] of Earth itself in the reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European religion]].<ref>{{Cite book|author=M. L. West |title=Indo-European poetry and myth |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2007 |pages=178–179 |isbn=0-19-928075-4 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> Another theory suggests that it is based on a [[Semitic]] word such as the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''erebu'' meaning "to go down, set"<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Europe "Europe"]. ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''.</ref> (in reference to the sun), [[cognate]] to [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] '' 'ereb'' "evening; west" and Arabic [[Maghreb]], Hebrew ''ma'arav'' (see also ''[[Erebus]]'', [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] ''*h<sub>1</sub>regʷos'', "darkness"). [[Martin Litchfield West]] states that "phonologically, the match between Europa's name and any form of the Semitic word is very poor".<ref>{{Cite book|author=M. L.

Barry]], professor in [[Princeton University]]'s Near Eastern Studies Department, finds the mention of the word ''Ereb'' on an Assyrian stele with the meaning of "night", "[the country of] sunset", in opposition to ''Asu'' "[the country of] sunrise", i.e. Asia (Anatolia coming equally from Ἀνατολή, "(sun)rise", "east").<ref>M.A. Barry (1999): « L’Europe et son mythe : à la poursuite du couchant ». ''Revue des deux Mondes''. p. 110. ISBN 978-2-7103-0937-6</ref> In the ''[[Homeric Hymns]]'' written in the seventh century BC, ''Eurôpè'' still represents, as ''Ereb'', the western shore of the [[Aegean Sea]].

Whatever the origin of the name of the mythological figure, Εὐρώπη is first used as a geographical term in the 6th century BC, by Greek geographers such as [[Anaximander]] and [[Hecataeus of Miletus|Hecataeus]]. Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the [[Phasis River]] (the modern Rioni) in the Caucasus, a convention still followed by [[Herodotus]] in the 5th century BC.<ref>''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 4.38.

who took the [[Tanais]] (the modern Don River) as the boundary.
The term "Europe" is first used for a cultural sphere in the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] of the 9th century. From that time, the term designated the sphere of influence of the [[Western Church]], as opposed to both the [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches and to the [[Islamic world]]. The modern convention, enlarging the area of "Europe" somewhat to the east and the southeast, develops in the 19th century.

Most major world languages use words derived from "Europa" to refer to the continent. Chinese, for example, uses the word {{Unicode|''Ōuzhōu''}} (歐洲/欧洲); a similar Chinese-derived term {{nihongo||欧州|Ōshū}} is also sometimes used in Japanese such as in the Japanese name of the European Union, {{nihongo||欧州連合|Ōshū Rengō}}, despite the [[katakana]] {{nihongo||ヨーロッパ|Yōroppa}} being more commonly used. However, in some Turkic languages the originally Persian name ''[[Frangistan]]'' (land of the [[Franks]]) is used casually in referring to much of Europe, besides official names such as ''Avrupa'' or ''Evropa''.<ref name="davison">{{Cite journal|author=Davidson, Roderic H. |title=Where is the Middle East?|jstor=20029452 |journal=Foreign Affairs |volume=38|issue=4 |pages=665–675 |year=1960|doi=10.2307/20029452 |ref=harv}}</ref>

During the [[decline of the Roman Empire]], Europe entered a long period of change arising from what historians call the "[[Age of Migrations]]". There were numerous invasions and migrations amongst the [[Ostrogoths]], [[Visigoths]], [[Goths]], [[Vandals]], [[Huns]], [[Franks]], [[Angles]], [[Saxons]], [[Slavs]], [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], [[Bulgars]] and, later on, the [[Vikings]], [[Pechenegs]], [[Cumans]]  and [[Magyars]].<ref name="mieawl" /> [[Renaissance]] thinkers such as [[Petrarch]] would later refer to this as the "Dark Ages".<ref>''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol. 4, No. 1. (Jan. 1943), pp. 69–74.</ref> Isolated monastic communities were the only places to safeguard and compile written knowledge accumulated previously; apart from this very few written records survive and much literature, philosophy, mathematics, and other thinking from the classical period disappeared from Western Europe though they were preserved in the east, in the [[Byzantine Empire]].<ref>[[Norman Cantor|Norman F. Cantor]], ''The Medieval World 300 to 1300''.</ref>

From the 7th century onwards, Muslim [[Arabs]] started to encroach on historically Roman territory. Over the next centuries Muslim forces took [[Cyprus in the Middle Ages|Cyprus]], [[Malta]], [[Emirate of Crete|Crete]], [[Emirate of Sicily|Sicily]] and [[history of Islam in southern Italy|parts of southern Italy]].<ref>Kennedy, Hugh (1995).

}} The unsuccessful [[Siege of Constantinople (717–718)|second siege of Constantinople]] (717) weakened the [[Umayyad|Umayyad dynasty]] and reduced their prestige. The Umayyads were then defeated by the [[Frankish Empire|Frank]]ish leader [[Charles Martel]] at the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] in 732, which ended their northward advance.

During the Dark Ages, the [[Western Roman Empire]] fell under the control of various tribes. The Germanic and Slav tribes established their domains over Western and Eastern Europe respectively.<ref name="natgeo 143">National Geographic, 143–145.</ref> Eventually the Frankish tribes were united under [[Clovis&nbsp;I]].<ref name="natgeo 162">National Geographic, 162.</ref> [[Charlemagne]], a Frankish king of the [[Carolingian]] dynasty who had conquered most of Western Europe, was anointed "[[Holy Roman Emperor]]" by the Pope in 800. This led in 962 to the founding of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which eventually became centred in the German principalities of central Europe.<ref name="natgeo 166">National Geographic, 166.</ref>

[[East Central Europe]] saw the creation of Slavic states and the adoption of [[Christianity]] (circa 1000 AD). Powerful [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] state of [[Great Moravia]] spread its territory all the way south to the Balkan Slavs. Moravia reached its largest territorial extent under [[Svatopluk I of Moravia|Svatopluk I]] and caused a series of armed conflicts with [[East Francia]]. Further south, placed between the [[Frankish Empire]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]] and [[First Bulgarian Empire|slavicized Bulgarian Empire]],  first [[South Slavs|South Slavic states]] emerged in the late 7th and 8th century and adopted [[Christianity]]: [[Principality of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian Principality]] (later [[Serbian Kingdom|Kingdom]] and [[Serbian Empire|Empire]]) and [[Duchy of Croatia]] (later [[Kingdom of Croatia (925–1102)|Kingdom of Croatia]]). To the East, the [[Kievan Rus]] expanded from its capital in [[Kiev]] to become the largest state in Europe by the 10th century. In 988, [[Vladimir the Great]] adopted [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] as the religion of state.

The predominantly [[medieval Greek|Greek speaking]] [[Eastern Roman Empire]] retroactively became known in the West as the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Its capital was [[Constantinople]]. Emperor [[Justinian I]] presided over Constantinople's first golden age: he established a [[Code of Justinian|legal code]], funded the construction of the [[Hagia Sophia]] and brought the Christian church under state control.<ref name="natgeo 135">National Geographic, 135.</ref> During most of its existence, the Byzantine Empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe.

The economic growth of Europe around the year 1000, together with the lack of safety on the mainland trading routes, made possible the development of major commercial routes along the coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In this context, the growing independence acquired by some coastal cities gave the [[Maritime Republics]] a leading role in the European scene.

The Middle Ages on the mainland were dominated by the two upper echelons of the social structure: the nobility and the clergy. [[Feudalism]] developed in [[France]] in the Early Middle Ages and soon spread throughout Europe.<ref name="natgeo 158">National Geographic, 158.</ref> A struggle for influence between the [[nobility]] and the [[monarchy]] in England led to the writing of the [[Magna Carta]] and the establishment of a [[parliament]].<ref name="natgeo 186">National Geographic, 186.</ref> The primary source of culture in this period came from the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Through monasteries and cathedral schools, the Church was responsible for education in much of Europe.<ref name="natgeo 158" />

The [[Papacy]] reached the height of its power during the High Middle Ages. An [[East-West Schism]] in 1054 split the former Roman Empire religiously, with the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the Roman Catholic Church in the former Western Roman Empire. In 1095 [[Pope Urban II]] called for a [[Crusades|crusade]] against [[Muslims]] occupying [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Holy Land]].<ref name="natgeo 192">National Geographic, 192.</ref> In Europe itself, the Church organised the [[Inquisition]] against heretics.

In the 11th and 12th centuries, constant incursions by nomadic [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] tribes, such as the [[Pechenegs]] and the [[Cuman-Kipchak Confederation|Cuman-Kipchaks]], caused a massive migration of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] populations to the safer, heavily forested regions of the north and temporarily halted the expansion of the Rus' state to the south and east.<ref name="Klyuch1">{{Cite book|last=Klyuchevsky|first=Vasily|title=The course of the Russian history|location=v.1|url=http://www.kulichki.com/inkwell/text/special/history/kluch/kluch16.htm|isbn=5-244-00072-1|year=1987|publisher="Myslʹ}}</ref> Like many other parts of [[Eurasia]], these territories were [[Mongol invasion of Rus|overrun by the Mongols]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/citd/RussianHeritage/4.PEAS/4.L/12.III.5.html |title=The Destruction of Kiev|publisher=University of Toronto|accessdate=10 June 2008}}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}</ref> The invaders, who became known as [[Tatars]], were mostly Turkic-speaking peoples under Mongol suzerainty.

Political intrigue within the Church in the mid-14th century caused the [[Western Schism]]. During this forty-year period, two popes—one in [[Avignon]] and one in Rome—claimed rulership over the Church. Although the schism was eventually healed in 1417, the papacy's spiritual authority had suffered greatly.<ref name="natgeo 193">National Geographic, 193.</ref>

[[File:Lucas Cranach (I) workshop - Martin Luther (Uffizi).jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Martin Luther]] initiated the [[Protestant Reformation]]]]
The Church's power was further weakened by the Protestant Reformation (1517–1648), initially sparked by [[The Ninety-Five Theses|the works]] of German theologian [[Martin Luther]], an attempt to start a reform within the Church. The Reformation also damaged the Holy Roman Emperor's influence, as German princes became divided between [[Protestant]] and Roman Catholic faiths.<ref name="natgeo 256">National Geographic, 256–257.</ref> This eventually led to the [[Thirty Years War]] (1618–1648), which crippled the Holy Roman Empire and devastated much of [[Early Modern history of Germany|Germany]], killing between 25 and 40 percent of its population.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195896/history-of-Europe/58335/Demographics#ref=ref310375 History of Europe – Demographics].

In parallel, the [[Eastern Question]] grew more complex ever since the Ottoman defeat in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)]]. As the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire seemed imminent, the [[Great Power]]s struggled to safeguard their strategic and commercial interests in the Ottoman domains. The [[Russian Empire]] stood to benefit from the decline, whereas the [[Habsburg Empire]] and [[Great Britain|Britain]] perceived the preservation of the Ottoman Empire to be in their best interests.

Economic instability, caused in part by debts incurred in the First World War and 'loans' to Germany played havoc in Europe in the late 1920s and 1930s. This and the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] brought about the worldwide Great Depression.

In 1933, Hitler became the leader of Germany and began to work towards his goal of building Greater Germany. Germany re-expanded and took back the [[Saarland]] and [[Rhineland]] in 1935 and 1936. In 1938, [[Austria]] became a part of Germany following the [[Anschluss]]. Later that year, following the [[Munich Agreement]] signed by Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy, Germany annexed the [[Sudetenland]], which was a part of [[Czechoslovakia]] inhabited by ethnic Germans, and in early 1939, the remainder of Czechoslovakia was split into the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]], controlled by Germany, and the [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovak Republic]]. At the time, Britain and France preferred a policy of [[appeasement]].

With tensions mounting between Germany and Poland over the future of [[Danzig]], the Germans turned to the Soviets, and signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], which allowed the Soviets to invade the Baltic states and parts of Poland and Romania.

World War I and especially World War II diminished the eminence of Western Europe in world affairs. After World War II the map of Europe was redrawn at the [[Yalta Conference]] and divided into two blocs, the Western countries and the communist Eastern bloc, separated by what was later called by [[Winston Churchill]] an "[[Iron Curtain]]". The United States and Western Europe
established the [[NATO]] alliance and later the Soviet Union and Central Europe established the [[Warsaw Pact]].<ref name="natgeo 530">National Geographic, 530.</ref>

The two new [[superpower]]s, the United States and the Soviet Union, became locked in a fifty-year-long Cold War, centred on [[nuclear proliferation]]. At the same time [[decolonisation]], which had already started after World War I, gradually resulted in the independence of most of the European colonies in Asia and Africa.<ref name="natgeo 534" />
In the 1980s the [[glasnost|reforms]] of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement in Poland accelerated the collapse of the Eastern bloc and the end of the Cold War. Germany was reunited, after the symbolic [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] in 1989, and the maps of Central and Eastern Europe were redrawn once more.<ref name="hobsbawn" />

[[European integration]] also grew after World War II.

Encyclopædia Britannica.</ref>
Land relief in Europe shows great variation within relatively small areas. The southern regions are more mountainous, while moving north the terrain descends from the high [[Alps]], [[Pyrenees]], and [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]], through hilly uplands, into broad, low northern plains, which are vast in the east. This extended lowland is known as the [[Great European Plain]], and at its heart lies the [[North German Plain]]. An arc of uplands also exists along the north-western seaboard, which begins in the western parts of the islands of [[Great Britain|Britain]] and [[Ireland]], and then continues along the mountainous, fjord-cut spine of Norway.

[[File:Europe land use map.png|thumb|left|Land use map of Europe with arable farmland (yellow), forest (dark green), pasture (light green), and tundra or bogs in the north (dark yellow)]]

This description is simplified. Sub-regions such as the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and the [[Italian Peninsula]] contain their own complex features, as does mainland Central Europe itself, where the relief contains many plateaus, river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend. Sub-regions like [[Iceland]], Britain, and Ireland are special cases. The former is a land unto itself in the northern ocean which is counted as part of Europe, while the latter are upland areas that were once joined to the mainland until rising sea levels cut them off.

Europe lies mainly in the [[temperate]] climate zones, being subjected to [[prevailing westerlies]].

The climate is milder in comparison to other areas of the same latitude around the globe due to the influence of the [[Gulf Stream]].<ref name="climate">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbook.com/wb/Students?content_spotlight/climates/european_climate |title=European Climate |work=World Book |accessdate=16 June 2008 |publisher=World Book, Inc |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20061109230709/http://www.worldbook.com/wb/Students?content_spotlight/climates/european_climate |archivedate=9 November 2006 }}</ref> The Gulf Stream is nicknamed "Europe's central heating", because it makes Europe's climate warmer and wetter than it would otherwise be. The Gulf Stream not only carries warm water to Europe's coast but also warms up the prevailing westerly winds that blow across the continent from the Atlantic Ocean.

Therefore, the average temperature throughout the year of Naples is 16&nbsp;°C (60.8&nbsp;°F), while it is only 12&nbsp;°C (53.6&nbsp;°F) in New York City which is almost on the same latitude. Berlin, Germany; Calgary, Canada; and Irkutsk, in the Asian part of Russia, lie on around the same latitude; January temperatures in Berlin average around 8&nbsp;°C (15&nbsp;°F) higher than those in Calgary, and they are almost 22&nbsp;°C (40&nbsp;°F) higher than average temperatures in Irkutsk.<ref name="climate" /> Similarly, northern parts of Scotland have a tempertate marine climate. The yearly average temperature in city of Inverness is 9.05 degrees Celsius (48.3 degrees Fahrenheit). However, Churchill, Manitoba, Canada, is on roughly the same latitude and has an average temperature of -6.5 degrees Celsius (20.3 degrees Fahrenheit), giving it a nearly subarctic climate.

===Geology===
{{Main|Geology of Europe}}
The geology of Europe is hugely varied and complex, and gives rise to the wide variety of landscapes found across the continent, from the [[Scottish Highlands]] to the rolling [[plain]]s of Hungary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soton.ac.uk/~imw/jpg/eurogy.jpg|title=Geology map of Europe|year=1967|publisher=University of Southampton|accessdate=9 June 2008}}</ref>

[[File:Gibraltar-Europa-Point-LH-from-the-sea.jpg|thumb|300px|Europa Point as seen from the [[Strait of Gibraltar]].]]
Europe's most significant feature is the dichotomy between highland and mountainous [[Southern Europe]] and a vast, partially underwater, northern plain ranging from Ireland in the west to the [[Ural Mountains]] in the east. These two halves are separated by the mountain chains of the [[Pyrenees]] and [[Alps]]/[[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]]. The northern plains are delimited in the west by the [[Scandinavian Mountains]] and the mountainous parts of the British Isles. Major shallow water bodies submerging parts of the northern plains are the [[Celtic Sea]], the [[North Sea]], the [[Baltic Sea]] complex and [[Barents Sea]].

The northern plain contains the old geological continent of [[Baltica]], and so may be regarded geologically as the "main continent", while peripheral highlands and mountainous regions in the south and west constitute fragments from various other geological continents. Most of the older geology of western Europe existed as part of the ancient [[microcontinent]] [[Avalonia]].

====Geological history====
{{Main|Geological history of Europe}}
The geological history of Europe traces back to the formation of the [[Baltic Shield]] (Fennoscandia) and the [[Sarmatian craton]], both around 2.25&nbsp;billion years ago, followed by the Volgo-Uralia shield, the three together leading to the [[East European craton]] (≈ [[Baltica]]) which became a part of the [[supercontinent]] [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Columbia]]. Around 1.1&nbsp;billion years ago, Baltica and Arctica (as part of the [[Laurentia]] block) became joined to [[Rodinia]], later resplitting around 550&nbsp;million years ago to reform as Baltica. Around 440&nbsp;million years ago [[Euramerica]] was formed from Baltica and Laurentia; a further joining with [[Gondwana]] then leading to the formation of [[Pangea]]. Around 190&nbsp;million years ago, Gondwana and [[Laurasia]] split apart due to the widening of the Atlantic Ocean. Finally, and very soon afterwards, Laurasia itself split up again, into Laurentia (North America) and the Eurasian continent. The land connection between the two persisted for a considerable time, via [[Greenland]], leading to interchange of animal species. From around 50&nbsp;million years ago, rising and falling sea levels have determined the actual shape of Europe, and its connections with continents such as Asia. Europe's present shape dates to the late [[Tertiary period]] about five million years ago.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106055|title=Europe|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|year=2007|accessdate=10 June 2008}}</ref>

===Biodiversity===
{{See also|Fauna of Europe}}
[[File:Europe biogeography countries.svg|right|thumb|300px|[[Biogeography|Biogeographic regions]] of Europe and bordering regions]]
Having lived side-by-side with agricultural peoples for millennia, Europe's animals and plants have been profoundly affected by the presence and activities of man. With the exception of [[Fennoscandia]] and northern Russia, few areas of untouched wilderness are currently found in Europe, except for various [[national park]]s.

The main natural vegetation cover in Europe is mixed [[forest]]. The conditions for growth are very favourable. In the north, the [[Gulf Stream]] and [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]] warm the continent. Southern Europe could be described as having a warm, but mild climate. There are frequent summer droughts in this region. Mountain ridges also affect the conditions. Some of these ([[Alps]], [[Pyrenees]]) are oriented east-west and allow the wind to carry large masses of water from the ocean in the interior. Others are oriented south-north ([[Scandinavian Mountains]], [[Dinaric Alps|Dinarides]], [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]], [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]) and because the rain falls primarily on the side of mountains that is oriented towards the sea, forests grow well on this side, while on the other side, the conditions are much less favourable. Few corners of mainland Europe have not been grazed by [[livestock]] at some point in time, and the cutting down of the pre-agricultural forest habitat caused disruption to the original plant and animal ecosystems.

Probably 80 to 90 percent of Europe was once covered by forest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saveamericasforests.org/europages/history&geography.htm|title=History and geography|publisher=Save America's Forest Funds|accessdate=9 June 2008}}</ref> It stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to the Arctic Ocean. Though over half of Europe's original forests disappeared through the centuries of [[deforestation]], Europe still has over one quarter of its land area as forest, such as the [[taiga]] of Scandinavia and Russia, mixed [[rainforest]]s of the Caucasus and the [[Cork oak]] forests in the western Mediterranean. During recent times, deforestation has been slowed and many trees have been planted. However, in many cases monoculture [[plantation]]s of [[Pinophyta|conifers]] have replaced the original mixed natural forest, because these grow quicker. The plantations now cover vast areas of land, but offer poorer habitats for many European forest dwelling species which require a mixture of tree species and diverse forest structure. The amount of natural forest in Western Europe is just 2–3% or less, in European Russia 5–10%. The country with the smallest percentage of forested area is [[Iceland]] (1%), while the most forested country is Finland (77%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcpfe.net/system/files/u1/publications/pdf/state_of_europes_forests_2007.pdf |title=State of Europe's Forests 2007: The MCPFE report on sustainable forest management in Europe |publisher=EFI Euroforest Portal |page=182 |accessdate=9 June 2008 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20080624190612/http://www.mcpfe.net/system/files/u1/publications/pdf/state_of_europes_forests_2007.pdf |archivedate=24 June 2008 }}</ref>

[[File:Floristic regions in Europe (english).png|thumb|left|300px|Floristic regions of Europe and neighbouring areas, according to Wolfgang Frey and Rainer Lösch]]
In temperate Europe, mixed forest with both [[flowering plant|broadleaf]] and coniferous trees dominate. The most important species in central and western Europe are [[beech]] and [[oak]]. In the north, the taiga is a mixed [[spruce]]–[[pine]]–[[birch]] forest; further north within Russia and extreme northern Scandinavia, the taiga gives way to [[tundra]] as the Arctic is approached. In the Mediterranean, many [[olive]] trees have been planted, which are very well adapted to its arid climate; [[Cupressus sempervirens|Mediterranean Cypress]] is also widely planted in southern Europe. The semi-arid Mediterranean region hosts much scrub forest. A narrow east-west tongue of Eurasian [[grassland]] (the [[steppe]]) extends eastwards from [[Ukraine]] and southern Russia and ends in Hungary and traverses into taiga to the north.

Glaciation during the [[Quaternary glaciation|most recent ice age]] and the presence of man affected the distribution of [[Fauna of Europe|European fauna]]. As for the animals, in many parts of Europe most large animals and top [[predator]] species have been hunted to extinction. The [[woolly mammoth]] was extinct before the end of the [[Neolithic]] period. Today [[wolf|wolves]] ([[carnivore]]s) and [[bear]]s ([[omnivore]]s) are endangered. Once they were found in most parts of Europe. However, deforestation and hunting caused these animals to withdraw further and further. By the [[Middle Ages]] the bears' habitats were limited to more or less inaccessible mountains with sufficient forest cover. Today, the [[European brown bear|brown bear]] lives primarily in the [[Balkan|Balkan peninsula]], Scandinavia, and Russia; a small number also persist in other countries across Europe (Austria, Pyrenees etc.), but in these areas brown bear populations are fragmented and marginalised because of the destruction of their habitat. In addition, [[polar bear]]s may be found on [[Svalbard]], a Norwegian archipelago far north of Scandinavia. The [[Eurasian wolf|wolf]], the second largest predator in Europe after the brown bear, can be found primarily in [[Central and Eastern Europe]] and in the Balkans, with a handful of packs in pockets of [[Western Europe]] (Scandinavia, Spain, etc.).

European wild cat, foxes (especially the red fox), jackal and different species of martens, hedgehogs, different species of reptiles (like snakes such as vipers and grass snakes) and amphibians, different birds (owls, hawks and other birds of prey).

Important European herbivores are snails, larvae, fish, different birds, and mammals, like rodents, deer and roe deer, boars, and living in the mountains, marmots, steinbocks, chamois among others.  A number of insects, such as the [[small tortoiseshell]] butterfly, add to the biodiversity.<ref>BRYANT, S., THOMAS, C. and BALE, J. (1997), Nettle-feeding nymphalid butterflies: temperature, development and distribution. Ecological Entomology, 22: 390–398. {{DOI|10.1046/j.1365-2311.1997.00082.x}}</ref>

The extinction of the [[Cretan Dwarf Hippopotamus|dwarf hippos]] and [[dwarf elephant]]s has been linked to the earliest arrival of humans on the islands of the [[Mediterranean]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/RainForest/3096/palaeol.html|title=Paleolithic Man and his Environment in Malta|last1=Savona-Ventura|first1=C.|last2=Mifsud|first2=A.|date=9 April 1997|accessdate=19 July 2014|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/RainForest/3096/palaeol.html&date=2009-10-25+09:39:06|archivedate=25 October 2009}}</ref>

Sea creatures are also an important part of European flora and fauna. The sea flora is mainly [[phytoplankton]]. Important animals that live in European seas are [[zooplankton]], [[mollusc]]s, [[echinoderm]]s, different [[crustacean]]s, [[squid]]s and [[octopuses]], fish, [[dolphin]]s, and [[whales]].

Biodiversity is protected in Europe through the Council of Europe's [[Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats|Bern Convention]], which has also been signed by the [[European Community]] as well as non-European states.

==Integration==
{{Supranational European Bodies|size=250px|align=right}}
{{Main|European integration}}
{{See also|International organizations in Europe}}
European integration is the process of political, legal, economic (and in some cases social and cultural) integration of states wholly or partially in Europe. In the present day, European integration has primarily come about through the Council of Europe and European Union in Western and Central Europe and [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] in Central and Eastern Europe and most of former Soviet countries.

==Economy==
[[File:Europe-GDP-PPP-per-capita-map.png|thumb|250px|European and bordering nations by [[GDP]] (PPP) per capita]]
{{Main|Economy of Europe}}

As a continent, the economy of Europe is currently the largest on Earth and it is the richest region as measured by assets under management with over $32.7&nbsp;trillion compared to North America's $27.1&nbsp;trillion in 2008.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fineman |first=Josh |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&sid=aL5a46f2RjVA |title=Bloomberg.com |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=15 September 2009 |accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref> In 2009 Europe remained the wealthiest region. Its $37.1 trillion in assets under management represented one-third of the world's wealth. It was one of several regions where wealth surpassed its precrisis year-end peak.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pr-inside.com/global-wealth-stages-a-strong-comeback-r1942019.htm |title=Global Wealth Stages a Strong Comeback |publisher=Pr-inside.com |date=10 June 2010 |accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref> As with other continents, Europe has a large variation of wealth among its countries. The richer states tend to be in the [[Western Europe|West]]; some of the [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an economies are still emerging from the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] and [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].

The European Union, a political entity composed of 28 European states, comprises the [[List of countries by GDP|largest single economic area]] in the world. 18 EU [[Eurozone|countries]] share the [[euro]] as a common currency.
Five European countries rank in the top ten of the world's largest [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|national economies in GDP (PPP)]]. This includes (ranks according to the [[The CIA World Factbook|CIA]]): Germany (5), the UK (6), Russia (7), France (8), and Italy (10).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2001rank.html|title=The CIA World Factbook – GDP (PPP)|date=15 July 2008|accessdate=19 July 2008|publisher=[[CIA]]}}</ref>

There is huge disparity between many European countries in terms of their income. The richest in terms of GDP per capita is Monaco with its US$172,676 per capita (2009) and the poorest is Moldova with its GDP per capita of US$1,631 (2010).<ref>[http://databank.worldbank.org/ddp/home.do?Step=12&id=4&CNO=2 The World Bank DataBank | Explore .

===Pre–1945: Industrial growth===
Capitalism has been dominant in the Western world since the end of feudalism.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com-archive-online.eu/EBchecked/topic/93927/capitalism Capitalism]. ''Encyclopædia Britannica.''</ref> From Britain, it gradually spread throughout Europe.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Industrialism: A Dictionary of Sociology|author=Scott, John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005}}</ref> The [[Industrial Revolution]] started in Europe, specifically the United Kingdom in the late 18th century,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/lecture17a.html|title=The Origins of the Industrial Revolution in England|publisher=The History Guide|author=Steven Kreis|date=11 October 2006|accessdate=1 January 2007}}</ref> and the 19th century saw Western Europe industrialise. Economies were disrupted by World War I but by the beginning of World War II they had recovered and were having to compete with the growing economic strength of the United States. World War II, again, damaged much of Europe's industries.

===1945–1990: The Cold War===
After World War II the economy of the UK was in a state of ruin,<ref>Dornbusch, Rudiger; Nölling, Wilhelm P.; Layard, Richard G. ''Postwar Economic Reconstruction and Lessons for the East Today'', pg. 117</ref> and continued to suffer relative economic decline in the following decades.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rethinking International Organisation: Deregulation and Global Governance|last=Emadi-Coffin|first=Barbara|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-19540-3|page=64}}</ref> Italy was also in a poor economic condition but regained a high level of growth by the 1950s. West Germany [[Wirtschaftswunder|recovered quickly]] and had doubled production from pre-war levels by the 1950s.<ref>Dornbusch, Rudiger; Nölling, Wilhelm P.; Layard, Richard G. ''Postwar Economic Reconstruction and Lessons for the East Today'', pg. 29</ref> France also staged a remarkable comeback enjoying rapid growth and modernisation; later on Spain, under the leadership of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]], also recovered, and the nation recorded huge unprecedented economic growth beginning in the 1960s in what is called the [[Spanish miracle]].<ref>Harrop, Martin. ''Power and Policy in Liberal Democracies'', pg. 23</ref> The majority of [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an states came under the control of the [[Soviet Union]] and thus were members of the [[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]] (COMECON).<ref name="loc-cs">"Germany (East)", Library of Congress Country Study, [http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/germany_east/gx_appnb.html Appendix B: The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]</ref>
[[File:Thefalloftheberlinwall1989.JPG|thumb|right|Fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989.]]
The states which retained a [[free-market]] system were given a large amount of aid by the United States under the [[Marshall Plan]].
<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/marshall-plan|title=Marshall Plan|publisher=US DEPARTMENT OF STATE Office of the historian}}</ref> The western states moved to link their economies together, providing the basis for the EU and increasing cross border trade. This helped them to enjoy rapidly improving economies, while those states in COMECON were struggling in a large part due to the cost of the [[Cold War]]. Until 1990, the [[European Community]] was expanded from 6 founding members to 12. The emphasis placed on resurrecting the West German economy led to it overtaking the UK as Europe's largest economy.

===1991–2007: Integration and reunification===
With the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe in 1991, the post-socialist states began free market reforms: Poland, Hungary, and [[Slovenia]] adopted them reasonably quickly, while [[Ukraine]] and Russia are still in the process of doing so.

After [[East Germany|East]] and West Germany were reunited in 1990, the economy of West Germany struggled as it had to support and largely rebuild the infrastructure of East Germany.
[[File:Unemployment European Union 2010M09.svg|thumb|right|Unemployment in the [[European Union]] in 2010, according to [[Eurostat]].]]
By the millennium change, the EU dominated the economy of Europe comprising the five largest European economies of the time namely Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Spain. In 1999, 12 of the 15 members of the EU joined the [[Eurozone]] replacing their former national currencies by the common euro. The three who chose to remain outside the Eurozone were: the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden.
The European Union is now the largest economy in the world.<ref>[http://thepropheticyears.com/reasons/The%20rise%20of%20the...oman%20empire.htm]</ref>

Since the [[Renaissance]], Europe has had a major influence in culture, economics and social movements in the world. The most significant [[invention]]s had their origins in the Western world, primarily Europe and the United States.<ref>[http://corporate.britannica.com/press/inventions.html Encyclopædia Britannica's Great Inventions], Encyclopædia Britannica</ref><ref>"[http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/101-gadgets-that-changed-the-world-398535.html 101 gadgets that changed the world]".

In 2005, the population of Europe was estimated to be 731&nbsp;million according to the United Nations,<ref name="UNPP 2006" /> which is slightly more than one-ninth of the world's population. A century ago, Europe had nearly a quarter of the [[world population|world's population]].<ref name="World Population Growth, 1950–2050">[http://www.prb.org/Educators/TeachersGuides/HumanPopulation/PopulationGrowth.aspx?p=1 World Population Growth, 1950–2050].

Today, large populations of European descent are found on every continent. European ancestry predominates in North America, and to a lesser degree in South America (particularly in [[Uruguay]], [[Argentina]], [[Chile]] and [[Brazil]], while most of the other [[Latin America]]n countries also have a considerable [[White Latin American|population of European origins]]). [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] have large European derived populations. Africa has no countries with European-derived majorities (or with the exception of [[Cape Verde]] and probably [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], depending on context), but there are significant minorities, such as the [[White South African]]s. In Asia, European-derived populations predominate in [[Northern Asia]] (specifically [[Russians]]), some parts of Northern [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Israel]].<ref>Robert Greenall, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4420922.stm Russians left behind in Central Asia], [[BBC News]], 23 November 2005</ref> Additionally, [[Transcontinental country|transcontinental]] or geographically Asian countries such as [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Turkey]] have populations historically closely related to Europeans, with considerable genetic and cultural affinity.

===Language===
{{Main|Languages of Europe}}
[[File:Rectified Languages of Europe map.png|thumb|Overview map of the distribution of major European languages]]

European languages mostly fall within three [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language groups: the [[Romance languages]], derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] of the [[Roman Empire]]; the [[Germanic languages]], whose ancestor language came from southern Scandinavia; and the [[Slavic languages]].<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica" />

Slavic languages are most spoken by the number of native speakers in Europe, they are spoken in Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe. Romance languages are spoken primarily in south-western Europe as well as in [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]], in Central or Eastern Europe. Germanic languages are spoken in Northern Europe, the British Isles and some parts of [[Central Europe]].<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica" />

Many other languages outside the three main groups exist in Europe. Other Indo-European languages include the [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] group (that is, [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]), the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] group (that is, [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scots Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]], [[Manx language|Manx]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], and [[Breton language|Breton]]<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica" />), [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], and [[Albanian language|Albanian]]. In addition, a distinct group of [[Uralic languages]] ([[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]) is spoken mainly in [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], and [[Hungary]], while [[Kartvelian languages]] ([[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Mingrelian language|Mingrelian]], and [[Svan language|Svan]]), are spoken primarily in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and two other language families reside in the North Caucasus (termed [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian]], most notably including [[Chechen language|Chechen]], [[Avar language|Avar]] and [[Lezgian language|Lezgin]] and [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian]], notably including [[Adyghe language|Adyghe]]). [[Maltese language|Maltese]] is the only [[Semitic language]] that is official within the EU, while [[Basque language|Basque]] is the only European [[language isolate]]. [[Turkic languages]] include [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]], in addition to the [[Languages of Russia|languages of minority nations]] in Russia.

Multilingualism and the protection of regional and minority languages are recognised political goals in Europe today. The [[Council of Europe]] [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]] and the Council of Europe's [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] set up a legal framework for language rights in Europe.

===Religion===
[[File:Petersdom von Engelsburg gesehen.jpg|thumb|[[St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Vatican City]], the largest church in the Europe.]]
{{Main|Religion in Europe}}
[[history of religion|Historically]], religion in Europe has been a major influence on [[Western art history|European art]], [[culture of Europe|culture]], [[Western philosophy|philosophy]] and [[European Union law|law]]. The largest religion in Europe is [[Christianity]], with 76.2% of Europeans considering themselves [[Christian]]s,<ref name="Christianity">{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2011/12/19/global-christianity-regions/#europe|title=Regional Distribution of Christians: Christianity in Europe|date=18 December 2011|work=Pew Research Center's Religion & Public Life Project|accessdate=22 February 2015}}</ref> including [[Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and various [[Protestant]] denominations (especially historically state-supported European ones such as [[Lutheranism]], [[Anglicanism]] and the [[Reformed faith]]). The notion of "Europe" and the "[[Western World]]" has been intimately connected with the concept of "[[Christendom|Christianity and Christendom]]" many even attribute Christianity for being the link that created a unified [[European identity]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Dawson|first=Christopher|title=Crisis in Western Education|year=1961|isbn=9780813216836|edition=reprint|author2=Glenn Olsen|page=108}}</ref>

The second most popular religion is [[Islam]] (6%)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-muslim/ |title=THE GLOBAL RELIGIOUS LANDSCAPE: Muslims |accessdate=2012-12-18 |work=pewforum}}</ref> concentrated mainly in the Balkans and eastern Europe ([[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Albania]], [[Kosovo]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[TRNC|North Cyprus]], [[Turkey]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[North Caucasus]], and the [[Idel-Ural|Volga-Ural region]]). Other religions, including Judaism, [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]] are minority religions (though Tibetan Buddhism is the majority religion of Russia's [[Republic of Kalmykia]]). The 20th century saw the revival of [[Neopaganism]] through movements such as [[Wicca]] and [[Druidry]].

Europe has become a relatively [[secular]] continent, with an increasing number and proportion of [[irreligion|irreligious]], [[atheism|atheist]] and [[agnosticism|agnostic]] people which make up about 18.2% of Europeans population,<ref name="Religiously Unaffiliated">{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/global-religious-landscape-unaffiliated.aspx|title=Religiously Unaffiliated|date=18 December 2012|work=Pew Research Center's Religion & Public Life Project|accessdate=22 February 2015}}</ref> actually the largest secular in the [[Western religion|Western world]]. There are a particularly high number of self-described non-religious people in the Czech Republic, [[Estonia]], Sweden, former East Germany, and France.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dogan|first=Mattei|year=1998|title=The Decline of Traditional Values in Western Europe|journal=International Journal of Comparative Sociology|publisher=Sage|volume=39|pages=77–90|doi=10.1177/002071529803900106|ref=harv}}</ref>

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Europe}} {{See also|European art}}
[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Le Moulin de la Galette.jpg|thumb|''[[Bal du moulin de la Galette|Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette]]'', 1876, by Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]
The culture of Europe can be described as a series of overlapping cultures; cultural mixes exist across the continent. Scholar Andreas Kaplan describes Europe as "embracing maximum cultural diversity at minimal geographical distances".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.emj.2014.03.006|title=Andreas M. Kaplan: European Management and European Business Schools: Insights from the History of Business Schools, European Management Journal, 2014}}</ref> There are cultural [[innovation]]s and movements, sometimes at odds with each other. Thus, the question of "common culture" or "common values" is complex.

According to historian [[Hilaire Belloc]], for several centuries the peoples of Europe based their self-identification on the remaining traces of the [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]] and on the concept of [[Christendom]], because many European-wide military alliances were of religious nature: the [[Crusades]] (1095–1291), the [[Reconquista]] (711–1492), the [[Battle of Lepanto]] (1571).<ref>Hilarie Belloc, [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8442 Europe and the Faith], Chapter I</ref>
