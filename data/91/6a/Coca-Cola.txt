'''Coca-Cola''' is a [[carbonation|carbonated]] [[soft drink]].<ref>In June 2012, Coca-Cola announced its intentions to begin distributing in [[Myanmar]]. {{cite news|title=Coca-Cola to spend $30 billion to grow globally|first=Leon|last=Stafford|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/business/coca-cola-to-spend-30-billion-to-grow-globally/nR6YS/|newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|date=September 9, 2012|accessdate=January 24, 2013}}</ref> It is produced by [[The Coca-Cola Company]] of [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and is often referred to simply as '''Coke''' (a registered trademark of The Coca-Cola Company in the United States since March 27, 1944). Originally intended as a [[patent medicine]] when it was invented in the late 19th century by [[John Pemberton]], Coca-Cola was bought out by businessman [[Asa Griggs Candler]], whose marketing tactics led Coke to its dominance of the world soft-drink market throughout the 20th century. The name refers to two of its original ingredients: [[kola nuts]], a source of [[caffeine]], and [[coca leaves]]. The current [[Coca-Cola formula|formula]] of Coca-Cola remains a [[trade secret]], although a variety of reported recipes and experimental recreations have been published.

The company produces [[concentrate]], which is then sold to licensed Coca-Cola bottlers throughout the world. The bottlers, who hold territorially exclusive contracts with the company, produce finished product in cans and bottles from the concentrate in combination with filtered water and sweeteners. The bottlers then sell, distribute and merchandise Coca-Cola to retail stores, restaurants and [[vending machines]]. The Coca-Cola Company also sells concentrate for [[soda fountain]]s to major restaurants and [[food service]] distributors.

The Coca-Cola Company has, on occasion, introduced other cola drinks under the Coke brand name. The most common of these is [[Diet Coke]], with others including [[Caffeine-Free Coca-Cola]], Diet Coke Caffeine-Free, [[Coca-Cola Cherry]], [[Coca-Cola Zero]], [[Coca-Cola Vanilla]], and special versions with lemon, lime, or coffee. In 2013, Coke products could be found in over 200 countries worldwide, with consumers downing more than 1.8 billion company beverage servings each day.<ref>Elmore, 2013, p 717</ref>

Based on [[Interbrand]]'s best global brand study of 2015, Coca-Cola was the world's third most valuable brand.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://interbrand.com/best-brands/best-global-brands/2015/ranking/}}</ref>

By 1888, three versions of Coca-Cola – sold by three separate businesses – were on the market. A copartnership had been formed on January 14, 1888 between Pemberton and four Atlanta businessmen: J.C. Mayfield, A.O. Murphey; C.O. Mullahy and E.H. Bloodworth. Not codified by any signed document, a verbal statement given by Asa Candler years later asserted under testimony that he had acquired a stake in Pemberton's company as early as 1887.<ref>{{cite book| author = Mark Pendergrast| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = March 16, 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| page = 42 }}</ref> John Pemberton declared that the ''name'' "Coca-Cola" belonged to his son, Charley, but the other two manufacturers could continue to use the ''formula''.<ref name="Pendergrast1">{{cite book| author = Mark Pendergrast| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = March 16, 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| pages = 45&nbsp;–47 }}</ref>

Charley Pemberton's record of control over the "Coca-Cola" name was the underlying factor that allowed for him to participate as a major shareholder in the March 1888 Coca-Cola Company incorporation filing made in his father's place.<ref>{{cite book| author = Mark Pendergrast| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = March 16, 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| page = 45 }}</ref> Charley's exclusive control over the "Coca Cola" name became a continual thorn in Asa Candler's side.
Candler's oldest son, Charles Howard Candler, authored a book in 1950 published by [[Emory University]]. In this definitive biography about his father, Candler specifically states: "..., on April 14, 1888, the young druggist [Asa Griggs Candler] purchased a one-third interest in the formula of an almost completely unknown proprietary elixir known as Coca-Cola."<ref>{{cite book | author = Candler, Charles Howard | title = Asa Griggs Candler | year = 1950 | publisher = Emory University | page = 81 | location = Georgia }}</ref>
[[File:- Coca-Cola - Old bottle opener -.jpg|right|thumb|Old German Coca-Cola [[bottle opener]].]]
The deal was actually between John Pemberton's son Charley and Walker, Candler & Co. – with John Pemberton acting as cosigner for his son. For $50 down and $500 in 30 days, Walker, Candler & Co. obtained all of the one-third interest in the Coca-Cola Company that Charley held, all while Charley still held on to the name.  After the April 14 deal, on April 17, 1888, one-half of the Walker/Dozier interest shares were acquired by Candler for an additional $750.<ref>{{cite book| author = Mark Pendergrast| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = March 16, 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| pages = 44&nbsp;–45  }}</ref>

==== The Coca-Cola Company ====
In 1892, Candler set out to incorporate a second company; "The Coca-Cola Company" (the current corporation). When Candler had the earliest records of the "Coca-Cola Company" burned in 1910, the action was claimed to have been made during a move to new corporation offices around this time.<ref>{{cite book| author = Mark Pendergrast| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = March 16, 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| page = 49  }}</ref>

After Candler had gained a better foothold on Coca-Cola in April 1888, he nevertheless was forced to sell the beverage he produced with the recipe he had under the names "Yum Yum" and "Koke".  This was while Charley Pemberton was selling the elixir, although a cruder mixture, under the name "Coca-Cola", all with his father's blessing.  After both names failed to catch on for Candler, by the summer of 1888, the Atlanta pharmacist was quite anxious to establish a firmer legal claim to Coca-Cola, and hoped he could force his two competitors, Walker and Dozier, completely out of the business, as well.<ref>{{cite book| author = Mark Pendergrast| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = March 16, 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| pages = 44&nbsp;–45}}</ref>

On August 16, 1888, Dr. John Stith Pemberton suddenly died, Asa G. Candler then sought to move swiftly forward to attain his vision of taking full control of the whole Coca-Cola operation.

Charley Pemberton, an alcoholic, was the one obstacle who unnerved Asa Candler more than anyone else.  Candler is said to have quickly maneuvered to purchase the exclusive rights to the name "Coca-Cola" from Pemberton's son Charley right after Dr. Pemberton's death. One of several stories was that Candler bought the title to the name from Charley's mother for $300; approaching her at Dr. Pemberton's funeral. Eventually, Charley Pemberton was found on June 23, 1894, unconscious, with a stick of opium by his side. Ten days later, Charley died at Atlanta's Grady Hospital at the age of 40.<ref>{{cite book| author = Mark Pendergrast| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = March 16, 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| pages = 48&nbsp;–49}}</ref>

In Charles Howard Candler's 1950 book about his father, he stated: "On August 30th [1888], he [Asa Candler] became sole proprietor of Coca-Cola, a fact which was stated on letterheads, invoice blanks and advertising copy."<ref>{{cite book | author = Candler, Charles Howard | title = Asa Griggs Candler | year = 1950 | publisher = Emory University | page = 81 | location = Georgia}}</ref>

With this action on August 30, 1888, Candler's sole control became technically all true.  Candler had negotiated with Margaret Dozier and her brother Woolfolk Walker a full payment amounting to $1,000, which all agreed Candler could pay off with a series of notes over a specified time span.  By May 1, 1889, Candler was now claiming full ownership of the Coca-Cola beverage, with a total investment outlay by Candler for the drink enterprise over the years amounting to $2,300.<ref>{{cite book| author = Mark Pendergrast| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = March 16, 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| page = 46 }}</ref>

In 1914, Margaret Dozier, as co-owner of the original Coca-Cola Company in 1888, came forward to claim that her signature on the 1888 Coca-Cola Company bill of sale had been forged.  Subsequent analysis of certain similar transfer documents had also indicated John Pemberton's signature was most likely a forgery, as well, which some accounts claim was precipitated by his son Charley.<ref>{{cite book| author = Mark Pendergrast| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = March 16, 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| pages = 45&nbsp;–47}}</ref>

On September 12, 1919, Coca-Cola Co. was purchased by a group of investors for $25 million and reincorporated. The company publicly offered 500,000 shares of the company for $40 a share.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/thisday/gahistory/09/12/coca-cola-sale-completed|title=This Day in Georgia History – Coca-Cola Sale Completed – GeorgiaInfo|work=usg.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/business-economy/robert-w-woodruff-1889-1985|title=Robert W.

In 1986, The Coca-Cola Company merged with two of their bottling operators (owned by JTL Corporation and BCI Holding Corporation) to form Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (CCE).<ref name="cokecce.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.cokecce.com/about-cce/our-story|title=Coca-Cola Enterprises : Our Story|publisher=Coca-Cola Enterprises|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20150321204349/https://www.cokecce.com/about-cce/our-story|archivedate=March 21, 2015}}</ref>

=== Origins of bottling ===
[[File:Commercial. At the Coca Cola Plant BAnQ P48S1P06539.jpg|thumb|Bottling plant of Coca-Cola Canada Ltd. January 8, 1941. [[Montreal]], [[Canada]].]]
The first bottling of Coca-Cola occurred in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]], Mississippi, at the Biedenharn Candy Company in 1891.  The proprietor of the bottling works was Joseph A. Biedenharn. The original bottles were Biedenharn bottles, very different from the much later hobble-skirt design of 1915 now so familiar.

It was then a few years later that two entrepreneurs from [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], namely; Benjamin F. Thomas and Joseph B. Whitehead, proposed the idea of bottling and were so persuasive that Candler signed a contract giving them control of the procedure for only one dollar.  Candler never collected his dollar, but in 1899, Chattanooga became the site of the first Coca-Cola bottling company.  Candler remained very content just selling his company's syrup.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cocacolaunited.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/HISTORY-OF-CHATTANOOGA-COCA-COLA-WORLDS-FIRST-BOTTLING-COMPANY.pdf |title= Chattanooga Coca-Cola History |accessdate=August 24, 2008 }}</ref> The loosely termed contract proved to be problematic for The Coca-Cola Company for decades to come. Legal matters were not helped by the decision of the bottlers to subcontract to other companies, effectively becoming parent bottlers.<ref name=history-of-bottling>{{cite web |url=http://www.coca-colacompany.com/our-company/history-of-bottling |title= History Of Bottling |accessdate=January 7, 2013 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5msXCIx46 | archivedate = January 18, 2010| deadurl=no}}</ref>

The first outdoor wall advertisement that promoted the Coca-Cola drink was painted in 1894 in [[Cartersville, Georgia]].<ref>[http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM2DK6 First painted wall sign to advertise Coca-Cola : Cartersville, GA] – Waymarking</ref>  Cola syrup was sold as an over-the-counter [[dietary supplement]] for upset stomach.<ref>Staff, The Doctors Book of Home Remedies.

On April 23, 1985, Coca-Cola, amid much publicity, attempted to change the [[Coca-Cola formula|formula]] of the drink with "New Coke". Follow-up taste tests revealed most consumers preferred the taste of New Coke to both Coke and [[Pepsi]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1913612_1913610_1913608,00.html|title=New Coke – Top 10 Bad Beverage Ideas|date=April 23, 2010|work=TIME.com}}</ref> but Coca-Cola management was unprepared for the public's [[nostalgia]] for the old drink, leading to a [[Backlash (sociology)|backlash]]. The company gave in to protests and returned to a variation of the old formula using high fructose corn syrup instead of cane sugar as the main sweetener, under the name Coca-Cola Classic, on July 10, 1985.

In April 2007, in Canada, the name "Coca-Cola Classic" was changed back to "Coca-Cola".

=== Formula of natural flavorings ===
{{Main|Coca-Cola formula}}

The exact formula of Coca-Cola's natural flavorings (but not its other ingredients, which are listed on the side of the bottle or can) is a [[trade secret]]. The original copy of the formula was held in [[SunTrust Bank]]'s main vault in Atlanta for 86 years. Its predecessor, the Trust Company, was the [[underwriter]] for the Coca-Cola Company's [[initial public offering]] in 1919. On December 8, 2011, the original secret formula was moved from the vault at SunTrust Banks to a new vault containing the formula which will be on display for visitors to its [[World of Coca-Cola]] museum in downtown Atlanta.<ref>{{cite web | publisher=csmonitor website | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Latest-News-Wires/2011/1208/Coca-Cola-formula-after-86-years-in-vault-gets-new-home | title=Coca-Cola formula, after 86 years in vault, gets new home | date=December 8, 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Coke Museum.JPG|thumb|Coca-Cola Museum in Atlanta, Georgia]]

According to Snopes, a popular myth states that only two executives have access to the formula, with each executive having only half the formula.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/ |title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Cokelore |accessdate=February 10, 2007 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5QDrZGjcI | archivedate = July 10, 2007| deadurl=no}}</ref> However, several sources state that while Coca-Cola does have a rule restricting access to only two executives, each knows the entire formula and others, in addition to the prescribed duo, have known the formulation process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/formula.asp|title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Cokelore (Have a Cloak and a Smile) |accessdate=February 22, 2007 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5msXBxkB7 | archivedate = January 18, 2010| deadurl=no}}</ref>

On February 11, 2011, [[Ira Glass]] revealed on his [[Public Radio International|PRI]] radio show, ''[[This American Life]]'', that the secret formula to Coca-Cola had been uncovered in a 1979 newspaper. The formula found basically matched the formula found in Pemberton's diary.<ref>Katie Rogers, [http://voices.washingtonpost.com/blog-post/2011/02/this_american_life_bursts_coca.html "'This American Life' bursts Coca-Cola's bubble: What's in that original recipe, anyway?,"] ''[[Washington Post]]'' BlogPost, February 15, 2011.

=== Use of stimulants in formula ===
[[File:Pembertoncokeanzeige.jpg|thumb|An early Coca Cola advertisement.]]

When launched, Coca-Cola's two key ingredients were [[cocaine]] and [[caffeine]]. The cocaine was derived from the [[coca]] leaf and the caffeine from [[kola nut]], leading to the name Coca-Cola (the "K" in Kola was replaced with a "C" for marketing purposes).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pponline.co.uk/encyc/0204.htm |title=Coca-cola |publisher=Pponline.co.uk |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}</ref><ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/cstartinventions/a/coca_cola.htm |title=The History of Coca Cola  | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5QDrW0eoP | archivedate = July 10, 2007| deadurl=no}}</ref>

==== Coca – cocaine ====
Pemberton called for five [[ounce]]s of coca leaf per gallon of syrup, a significant dose; in 1891, Candler claimed his formula (altered extensively from Pemberton's original) contained only a tenth of this amount. Coca-Cola once contained an estimated nine milligrams of cocaine per glass. In 1903, it was removed.<ref>Liebowitz, Michael, R. (1983). ''The Chemistry of Love''. Boston: Little, Brown, & Co.</ref>

After 1904, instead of using fresh leaves, Coca-Cola started using "spent" leaves – the leftovers of the cocaine-extraction process with trace levels of cocaine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_033.html|title=Is it true Coca Cola once contained cocaine? |accessdate=February 27, 2007| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5msXBwkls | archivedate = January 18, 2010| deadurl=no}}</ref> Since then, Coca-Cola uses a cocaine-free coca leaf extract prepared at a [[Stepan Company]] plant in [[Maywood, New Jersey]].<ref name="mayclifford">May, Clifford D. [http://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/01/business/how-coca-cola-obtains-its-coca.html "How Coca-Cola Obtains Its Coca"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 1, 1988. Accessed April 11, 2008. "A Stepan laboratory in Maywood, N.J., is the nation's only legal commercial importer of coca leaves, which it obtains mainly from Peru and, to a lesser extent, Bolivia. Besides producing the coca flavoring agent sold to [[The Coca-Cola Company]], Stepan extracts [[cocaine]] from the coca leaves, which it sells to [[Mallinckrodt]] Inc., a St. Louis pharmaceutical manufacturer that is the only company in the United States licensed to purify the product for medicinal use." See links for more information</ref>

In the United States, the Stepan Company is the only manufacturing plant authorized by the Federal Government to import and process the coca plant,<ref name="mayclifford" /> which it obtains mainly from Peru and, to a lesser extent, Bolivia. Besides producing the coca flavoring agent for Coca-Cola, the Stepan Company extracts cocaine from the coca leaves, which it sells to [[Mallinckrodt]], a [[St. Louis, Missouri]], [[pharmaceutical]] manufacturer that is the only company in the United States licensed to purify cocaine for medicinal use.<ref>{{cite news |first=Drew |last=Benson |title=Coca kick in drinks spurs export fears|url=http://www.mindfully.org/Food/2004/Kdrink-Coca-Drink19apr04.htm }}</ref>

Long after the syrup had ceased to contain any significant amount of cocaine, in the southeastern U.S., "dope" remained a common colloquialism for Coca-Cola, and "dope-wagons" were trucks that transported it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ncpedia.org/dope-wagons|title=Dope Wagons|work=ncpedia.org}}</ref>

==== Kola nuts – caffeine ====
Kola nuts act as a flavoring and the source of caffeine in Coca-Cola. In Britain, for example, the ingredient label states "Flavourings (Including Caffeine)."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coca-cola.co.uk/yourhealth/what_our_labels_tell_you/ |title=Coca-Cola Your Health – You and Your Family's GDA Questions Answered |publisher=Coca-cola.co.uk |date=April 13, 2010 |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}</ref> Kola nuts contain about 2.0 to 3.5% caffeine, are of bitter flavor and are commonly used in [[cola]] [[soft drinks]]. In 1911, the U.S. government initiated ''[[United States v. Forty Barrels and Twenty Kegs of Coca-Cola]]'', hoping to force Coca-Cola to remove caffeine from its formula. The case was decided in favor of Coca-Cola. Subsequently, in 1912, the U.S. Pure Food and Drug Act was amended, adding caffeine to the list of "habit-forming" and "deleterious" substances which must be listed on a product's label.

Coca-Cola contains 34&nbsp;mg of caffeine per 12 fluid ounces (9.8&nbsp;mg per 100&nbsp;ml).<ref>{{cite book| author = Gene A.

=== Franchised production model ===
The actual production and distribution of Coca-Cola follows a franchising model. The Coca-Cola Company only produces a syrup concentrate, which it sells to bottlers throughout the world, who hold Coca-Cola franchises for one or more geographical areas. The bottlers produce the final drink by mixing the syrup with filtered water and sweeteners, and then carbonate it before putting it in cans and bottles, which the bottlers then sell and distribute to retail stores, vending machines, restaurants and food service distributors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/ourcompany/aboutbottling.html |title=Offices & Bottling Plants |accessdate=January 7, 2013 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070216144908/http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/ourcompany/aboutbottling.html |archivedate = February 16, 2007 | deadurl=no}}</ref>

The Coca-Cola Company owns minority shares in some of its largest franchises, such as [[Coca-Cola Enterprises]], [[Coca-Cola Amatil]], [[Coca-Cola Hellenic]] Bottling Company and [[Coca-Cola FEMSA]], but fully independent bottlers produce almost half of the volume sold in the world.
Independent bottlers are allowed to sweeten the drink according to local tastes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cokecce.com/pages/allContent.asp?page_id=84#q1 |title=What Is the Difference Between Coca-Cola Enterprises and the Coca-Cola Company |accessdate=December 9, 2014 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20121021100615/http://cokecce.com/pages/allContent.asp?page_id=84 |archivedate=October 21, 2012}}</ref>

The bottling plant in [[Skopje]], [[Macedonia (country)|Macedonia]], received the 2009 award for "Best Bottling Company".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://macedoniaonline.eu/content/view/7151/1/ |title=Coca Cola: Macedonia makes the best Coke |publisher=Macedoniaonline.eu |date=June 16, 2009 |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}</ref>

Coca-Cola has been a point of legal discussion in the Middle East. In the early 20th century, a [[fatwa]] was created in Egypt to discuss the question of "whether Muslims were permitted to drink Coca-Cola and Pepsi cola."<ref name="Liebesny 1975 42–43">{{cite book|last=Liebesny|first=Herbert J.|title=The law of the Near and Middle East readings, cases, and materials|year=1975|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|pages=42–43}}</ref> The fatwa states: "According to the Muslim Hanefite, Shafi'ite, etc., the rule in Islamic law of forbidding or allowing foods and beverages is based on the presumption that such things are permitted unless it can be shown that they are forbidden on the basis of the Qur'an."<ref name="Liebesny 1975 42–43" /> The Muslim jurists stated that, unless the Qu'ran specifically prohibits the consumption of a particular product, it is permissible to consume. Another clause was discussed, whereby the same rules apply if a person is unaware of the condition or ingredients of the item in question.

=== Logo design ===
The Coca-Cola logo was created by John Pemberton's bookkeeper, [[Frank Mason Robinson]], in 1885.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/advertisingmedia/ss/Coca_Cola_Comp_2.htm |title=Coca Cola Company&nbsp;— Red Spencerian Script  | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5msXCGA2o | archivedate = January 18, 2010| deadurl=no}}</ref> Robinson came up with the name and chose the logo's distinctive cursive script. The writing style used, known as [[Spencerian Script|Spencerian script]], was developed in the mid-19th century and was the dominant form of formal handwriting in the United States during that period.

Robinson also played a significant role in early Coca-Cola advertising. His promotional suggestions to Pemberton included giving away thousands of free drink coupons and plastering the city of [[Atlanta]] with publicity banners and [[streetcar]] signs.<ref>{{cite web|title = Frank Robinson, creator of the Coca-Cola logo| url=http://coca-cola-art.com/2008/06/05/frank-robinson/| accessdate = December 15, 2008}}</ref>

=== Contour bottle design ===
{{redirect|Coke bottle|the song|Coke Bottle (song)}}
The  Coca-Cola bottle, called the "contour bottle" within the company, was created by bottle designer [[Earl R. Dean]]. In 1915, the [[Coca-Cola Company]] launched a competition among its bottle suppliers to create a new bottle for their beverage that would distinguish it from other beverage bottles, "a bottle which a person could recognize even if they felt it in the dark, and so shaped that, even if broken, a person could tell at a glance what it was."<ref name="vigo.lib.in.us">{{cite web |title=Inventory: Earl R. Dean Collection |url=http://www.vigo.lib.in.us/archives/inventories/business/dean.php|publisher=[[Vigo County Public Library]]|accessdate=December 14, 2008}}</ref>

Chapman J. Root, president of [[the Root Glass Company]] of [[Terre Haute, Indiana]], turned the project over to members of his supervisory staff, including company auditor T. Clyde Edwards, plant superintendent Alexander Samuelsson, and [[Earl R. Dean]], bottle designer and supervisor of the bottle molding room. Root and his subordinates decided to base the bottle's design on one of the soda's two ingredients, the [[coca leaf]] or the [[kola nut]], but were unaware of what either ingredient looked like. Dean and Edwards went to the [[Emeline Fairbanks Memorial Library]] and were unable to find any information about coca or kola. Instead, Dean was inspired by a picture of the gourd-shaped [[cocoa pod]] in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. Dean made a rough sketch of the pod and returned to the plant to show Root. He explained to Root how he could transform the shape of the pod into a bottle. Root gave Dean his approval.<ref name="vigo.lib.in.us" />

Faced with the upcoming scheduled maintenance of the mold-making machinery, over the next 24 hours Dean sketched out a concept drawing which was approved by Root the next morning. Dean then proceeded to create a bottle mold and produced a small number of bottles before the glass-molding machinery was turned off.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Bottle |last=Lundy |first=Betty |year=1986 |publisher=American Heritage Inc. |issn=0002-8738 |pages=98–101 |url=http://contourbottle.angelfire.com/The_Bottle.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>

Chapman Root approved the prototype bottle and a [[design patent]] was issued on the bottle in November 1915. The prototype never made it to production since its middle diameter was larger than its base, making it unstable on [[conveyor belt]]s. Dean resolved this issue by decreasing the bottle's middle diameter. During the 1916 bottler's convention, Dean's contour bottle was chosen over other entries and was on the market the same year. By 1920, the contour bottle became the standard for the [[Coca-Cola Company]]. A revised version was also patented in 1923. Because the Patent Office releases the ''Patent Gazette'' on Tuesday, the bottle was patented on December 25, 1923, and was nicknamed the "Christmas bottle." Today, the contour Coca-Cola bottle is one of the most recognized packages on the planet..."even in the dark!".<ref name=history-of-bottling />

As a reward for his efforts, Dean was offered a choice between a $500 bonus or a lifetime job at [[the Root Glass Company]]. He chose the lifetime job and kept it until the [[Owens-Illinois Glass Company]] bought out [[the Root Glass Company]] in the mid-1930s. Dean went on to work in other Midwestern glass factories.{{citation needed|date = May 2014}}

One alternative depiction has [[Raymond Loewy]] as the inventor of the unique design, but, while Loewy did serve as a designer of Coke cans and bottles in later years, he was in the [[French Army]] the year the bottle was invented and did not emigrate to the United States until 1919. Others have attributed inspiration for the design not to the cocoa pod, but to a [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]] [[Hoop skirt|hooped dress]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/bottle.asp |title=Snopes urban legend of the Coca-Cola bottle shape |publisher=Snopes.com |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}</ref>

In 1944, Associate Justice [[Roger J. Traynor]] of the [[Supreme Court of California]] took advantage of a case involving a waitress injured by an exploding Coca-Cola bottle to articulate the doctrine of [[strict liability]] for [[product liability|defective products]]. Traynor's [[concurring opinion]] in ''[[Escola v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co.]]'' is widely recognized as a landmark case in U.S. law today.<ref>See, e.g., Lawrence M. Friedman, ''American Law in the 20th century'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004), 356–357, and Jay M. Feinman, ''Law 101: Everything You Need to Know About the American Legal System'', rev. ed. (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), 165–168.</ref>

In 2007, the company's logo on cans and bottles changed. The cans and bottles retained the red color and familiar typeface, but the design was simplified, leaving only the logo and a plain white swirl (the "dynamic ribbon").{{citation needed|date = May 2014}}

[[Karl Lagerfeld]] is the latest designer to have created a collection of aluminum bottles for Coca-Cola. Lagerfeld is not the first fashion designer to create a special version of the famous Coca-Cola Contour bottle. A number of other limited edition bottles by fashion designers for Coca Cola Light soda have been created in the last few years.

In 2009, in Italy, Coca-Cola Light had a Tribute to Fashion to celebrate 100 years of the recognizable contour bottle. Well known Italian designers Alberta Ferretti, Blumarine, Etro, Fendi, Marni, Missoni, Moschino, and Versace each designed limited edition bottles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ifitshipitshere.blogspot.com/2010/04/coca-cola-light-get-dressed-by-another.html|title=Coca-Cola Light Gets Dressed By Another Designer, Karl Lagerfeld|accessdate=May 14, 2011}}</ref>

== Competitors ==
[[Pepsi]], the flagship product of [[PepsiCo]], The Coca-Cola Company's main rival in the soft drink industry, is usually second to Coke in sales, and outsells Coca-Cola in some markets. [[RC Cola]], now owned by the [[Dr Pepper Snapple Group]], the third largest soft drink manufacturer, is also widely available.{{citation needed|date = May 2014}}

Coca-Cola's advertising has significantly affected [[Culture of the United States|American culture]], and it is frequently credited with inventing the modern image of [[Santa Claus]] as an old man in a red-and-white suit. Although the company did start using the red-and-white Santa image in the 1930s, with its winter advertising campaigns illustrated by [[Haddon Sundblom]], the motif was already common.<ref>Barbara Mikkelson and David P.

Coke's advertising is pervasive, as one of [[Ernest Woodruff|Woodruff]]'s stated goals was to ensure that everyone on Earth drank Coca-Cola as their preferred beverage. This is especially true in southern areas of the United States, such as [[Atlanta]], where Coke was born.

Some Coca-Cola [[Television advertisement|television commercials]] between 1960 through 1986 were written and produced by former Atlanta radio veteran [[Don Naylor]] ([[WGST]] 1936–1950, [[WAGA (TV)|WAGA]] 1951–1959) during his career as a producer for the [[McCann Erickson]] [[advertising agency]]. Many of these early television commercials for Coca-Cola featured movie stars, sports heroes and popular singers.

During the 1980s, [[Pepsi-Cola]] ran a series of television advertisements showing people participating in taste tests demonstrating that, according to the commercials, "fifty percent of the participants who said they preferred Coke ''actually'' chose the Pepsi." Statisticians pointed out the problematic nature of a 50/50 result: most likely, the taste tests showed that in blind tests, most people cannot tell the difference between Pepsi and Coke. Coca-Cola ran ads to combat Pepsi's ads in an incident sometimes referred to as the ''[[cola wars]]''; one of Coke's ads compared the so-called [[Pepsi challenge]] to two [[chimpanzee]]s deciding which [[tennis ball]] was furrier. Thereafter, Coca-Cola regained its leadership in the market.

[[Selena]] was a spokesperson for Coca-Cola from 1989 till the time of her death. She filmed three commercials for the company. During 1994, to commemorate her five years with the company, Coca-Cola issued special Selena coke bottles.<ref>Orozco, Cynthia E. [http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/QQ/fquxg.html Quintanilla Perez, Selena.] The Handbook of Texas online. Retrieved on June 5, 2006</ref>

The Coca-Cola Company purchased [[Columbia Pictures]] in 1982, and began inserting Coke-product images into many of its films. After a few early successes during Coca-Cola's ownership, Columbia began to under-perform, and the studio was sold to [[Sony]] in 1989.

Coca-Cola has gone through a number of different [[advertising slogan]]s in its long history, including "The pause that refreshes", "I'd like to buy the world a Coke", and "Coke is it".

In 2006, Coca-Cola introduced [[My Coke Rewards]], a customer loyalty campaign where consumers earn points by entering codes from specially marked packages of Coca-Cola products into a website. These points can be redeemed for various prizes or sweepstakes entries.<ref>[http://www.mycokerewards.com/ My Coke Rewards] (Official Site)</ref>

In Australia in 2011, Coca-Cola began the "share a Coke" campaign, where the Coca-Cola logo was replaced on the bottles and replaced with first names. Coca-Cola used the 150 most popular names in Australia to print on the bottles.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jessica Burke |url=http://www.foodmag.com.au/news/sharing-your-coke--marketing-genius-or-just-entire |title=Sharing your Coke: marketing genius or just entirely weird? &#124; Food Magazine |publisher=Foodmag.com.au |date=September 26, 2011 |accessdate=February 23, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voxy.co.nz/lifestyle/whats-name/240/105315 |title=What's in a Name? |publisher=Voxy.co.nz |date=October 25, 2011 |accessdate= April 23, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.designtaxi.com/news/350737/For-Summer-Campaign-Coke-Prints-150-Popular-First-Names-on-Bottles/?page=1 |title=For Summer Campaign, Coke Prints 150 Popular First Names on Bottles |publisher=[[DesignTAXI.com]] |date=October 6, 2011 |accessdate= April 23, 2012}}</ref> The campaign was paired with a website page, Facebook page and an online "share a virtual Coke".

Keith Law, a producer and writer of commercials for [[Belfast CityBeat]], was not convinced by Coca-Cola's reintroduction of the advertisement in 2007, saying that "I don't think there's anything Christmassy about [[Heavy Goods Vehicle|HGVs]] and the commercial is too generic."<ref>{{cite news|title=Do TV campaigns ad up?|author=Jane Hardy|date=December 27, 2007|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk./lifestyle/do-tv-campaigns-ad-up-13505247.html|work=[[The Belfast Telegraph]]}}</ref>

=== Sports sponsorship ===
[[File:Coca Cola drinkende deelnemers Olympische Spelen (1952).jpg|thumb|upright|1952 Summer Olympics in [[Helsinki]]. Coca-Cola vending point]]
Coca-Cola was the first commercial [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]] of the Olympic games, at the [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 games]] in Amsterdam, and has been an Olympics sponsor ever since.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/sponsors/coca-cola |title=Coca-Cola|publisher=Olympic Movement|accessdate = August 12, 2012 }}</ref> This corporate sponsorship included the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] hosted in [[Atlanta]], which allowed Coca-Cola to spotlight its hometown. Most recently, Coca-Cola has released localized commercials for the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in Vancouver; one Canadian commercial referred to Canada's hockey heritage and was modified after Canada won the gold medal game on February 28, 2010 by changing the ending line of the commercial to say "Now they know whose game they're playing".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99msEwWpJBE |title=YouTube Post of Coca-Cola 2010 Olympic Hockey Commercial |accessdate=March 2, 2010 }}</ref>

Since [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]], Coca-Cola has sponsored the [[FIFA World Cup]], and other competitions organised by FIFA. One [[FIFA]] tournament trophy, the [[FIFA U-20 World Cup|FIFA World Youth Championship]] from Tunisia in [[1977 FIFA World Youth Championship|1977]] to Malaysia in [[1997 FIFA World Youth Championship|1997]], was called "FIFA&nbsp;— Coca Cola Cup".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/en/marketing/partners/index/0,3517,13,00.html |title=Marketing & TV > FIFA Partners > Coca Cola  |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070112104745/http://www.fifa.com/en/marketing/partners/index/0,3517,13,00.html |archivedate = January 12, 2007}}</ref> In addition, Coca-Cola sponsors the annual [[Coca-Cola 600]] and [[Coke Zero 400]] for the [[NASCAR]] [[Sprint Cup Series]] at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] in [[Concord, North Carolina]] and [[Daytona International Speedway]] in Daytona, Florida.

Coca-Cola has a long history of sports marketing relationships, which over the years have included [[Major League Baseball]], the [[National Football League]], the [[National Basketball Association]], and the [[National Hockey League]], as well as with many teams within those leagues. Coca-Cola has had a longtime relationship with the NFL's [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], due in part to the now-famous [[Hey Kid, Catch!|1979 television commercial]] featuring [[Joe Greene (American football)|"Mean Joe" Greene]], leading to the two opening the Coca-Cola Great Hall at [[Heinz Field]] in 2001 and a more recent [[Coca-Cola Zero]] commercial featuring [[Troy Polamalu]].

Coca-Cola is the official soft drink of many [[College football|collegiate football]] teams throughout the nation, partly due to Coca-Cola providing those schools with upgraded athletic facilities in exchange for Coca-Cola's sponsorship. This is especially prevalent at the high school level, which is more dependent on such contracts due to tighter budgets.

Coca-Cola was one of the official sponsors of the [[1996 Cricket World Cup]] held on the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Coca Cola is also one of the associate sponsor of [[Delhi Daredevils]] in [[Indian Premier League]].

In England, Coca-Cola was the main sponsor of [[The Football League]] between 2004 and 2010, a name given to the three professional divisions below the [[Premier League]] in [[association football|football]] (soccer). In 2005, Coca-Cola launched a competition for the 72 clubs of the football league&nbsp;— it was called "Win a Player". This allowed fans to place one vote per day for their favorite club, with one entry being chosen at random earning £250,000 for the club; this was repeated in 2006. The "Win A Player" competition was very controversial, as at the end of the 2 competitions, [[Leeds United A.F.C.]] had the most votes by more than double, yet they did not win any money to spend on a new player for the club. In 2007, the competition changed to "Buy a Player". This competition allowed fans to buy a bottle of Coca-Cola or Coca-Cola Zero and submit the code on the wrapper on the Coca-Cola website. This code could then earn anything from 50p to £100,000 for a club of their choice. This competition was favored over the old "Win a Player" competition, as it allowed all clubs to win some money.  Between 1992 and 1998, Coca-Cola was the title sponsor of the [[Football League Cup]] (Coca-Cola Cup), the secondary cup tournament of England.

Between 1994 and 1997, Coca-Cola was also the title sponsor of the [[Scottish League Cup]], renaming it the Coca-Cola Cup like its English counterpart.

Coca-Cola is the presenting sponsor of the [[Tour Championship]], the final event of the [[PGA Tour]] held each year at [[East Lake Golf Club]] in [[Atlanta]], GA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pgatour.com/tournaments/tour-championship-by-coca-cola.html|title=TOUR Championship by Coca-Cola|work=PGATour}}</ref>

Introduced March 1, 2010, in Canada, to celebrate the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], Coca Cola sold gold colored cans in packs of 12 {{convert|355|mL|0|abbr=on}} each, in select stores.<ref>{{cite web|title=Coca-Cola to Release Gold Can Commemorating the 2010 Olympics|url=http://bevwire.wordpress.com/2010/03/01/coca-cola-to-release-gold-can-commemorating-the-2010-olympics/|publisher=BevWire|accessdate=March 22, 2010|date=March 1, 2010}}</ref>

Coca-Cola has been prominently featured in countless films and television programs. Since its creation, it remains as one of the most prominent elements of the [[popular culture]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} It was a major plot element in films such as ''[[One, Two, Three]]'', ''[[The Coca-Cola Kid]]'', and ''[[The Gods Must Be Crazy]]'', among many others.

Not all musical references to Coca-Cola went well.  A line in "[[Lola (song)|Lola]]" by [[the Kinks]] was originally recorded as "You drink champagne and it tastes just like Coca-Cola."  When the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] refused to play the song because of the commercial reference, lead singer [[Ray Davies]] re-recorded the lyric as "it tastes just like cherry cola" to get airplay for the song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=1158 |title=Lola by The Kinks Songfacts |publisher=Songfacts.com |accessdate= April 23, 2012}}</ref>

Coca-Cola has a high degree of identification with the United States, being considered by some an "American Brand" or as an item representing America. During [[World War II]], this gave rise to brief production of the [[White Coke]] as a neutral brand.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/15/business/viewpoints-a-brief-history-of-coca-colonization.html|title=Viewpoints; A Brief History of Coca-Colonization|author=[[Mark Pendergrast]]|date=August 15, 1993|accessdate=September 12, 2012|page=256}}</ref>  The drink is also often a [[metonymy|metonym]] for the Coca-Cola Company.

There are some consumer boycotts of Coca-Cola in [[Arab world|Arab countries]] due to Coke's early investment in Israel during the [[Arab League boycott of Israel]] (its competitor Pepsi stayed out of Israel).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inminds.co.uk/boycott-coca-cola.html |title= Boycott Israel Campaign page on Coca-Cola|accessdate=August 3, 2007 }}</ref>  [[Mecca Cola]] and Pepsi have been successful{{vague|date=February 2012}} alternatives in the Middle East.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/31/international/europe/31FRAN.html|title=They Choke on Coke, But Savor Mecca-Cola|last1= Tagliabue|first1=John |last2= |first2= |date=December 31, 2002 |website=NYTimes.com |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=July 26, 2013}}</ref>

A Coca-Cola fountain dispenser (officially a Fluids Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus-2 or FGBA-2) was developed for use on the [[Space Shuttle]] as a test bed to determine if carbonated beverages can be produced from separately stored carbon dioxide, water and flavored syrups and determine if the resulting fluids can be made available for consumption without bubble nucleation and resulting foam formation.  The unit flew in 1996 aboard [[STS-77]] and held 1.65&nbsp;liters each of Coca-Cola and Diet Coke.<ref>{{cite web |last=Orloff |first=Richard W. |url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/shuttle_pk/pk/Flight_077_STS-077_Press_Kit.pdf |title=Space Shuttle Mission STS-77 |date=January 2001 |origyear=Press Kit May 1996 |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration |accessdate=June 13, 2009}}</ref>
