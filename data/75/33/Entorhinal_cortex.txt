The '''entorhinal cortex (EC)''' (ento = interior, rhino = nose, entorhinal = interior to the [[rhinal sulcus]]) is an area of the [[brain]] located in the [[medial temporal lobe]] and functioning as a hub in a widespread network for [[memory]] and navigation. The EC is the main interface between the [[hippocampus]] and [[neocortex]]. The [[EC-hippocampus system]] plays an important role in declarative (autobiographical/episodic/semantic) memories and in particular [[spatial memory|spatial memories]] including [[memory formation]], [[memory consolidation]], and memory optimization in [[sleep]]. The EC is also responsible for the pre-processing (familiarity) of the input signals in the reflex [[nictitating membrane]] response of classical trace conditioning, the association of impulses from the [[Human eye|eye]] and the [[ear]] occurs in the entorhinal cortex.

== Anatomy ==
In rodents, the EC is located at the [[Caudal (anatomical term)|caudal]] end of the [[temporal lobe]]. In primates it is located at the [[Anatomical terms of location#Anterior and posterior|rostral]] end of the temporal lobe and stretches dorsolaterally. It is usually divided into [[medial (anatomy)|medial]] and [[lateral (anatomy)|lateral]] regions with three bands with distinct properties and connectivity running perpendicular across the whole area. A distinguishing characteristic of the EC is the lack of cell bodies where layer IV should be; this layer is called the ''lamina dissecans''.

== Inputs and outputs ==
[[File:Apoe-cortical-thickness-entorhinal.jpg|thumb|right|300px|View of left entorhinal cortex (red) from beneath the brain, with front of brain at top. Artist’s rendering.]]
The superficial layers - layers II and III - of EC project to the [[dentate gyrus]] and [[hippocampus]]: Layer II projects primarily to [[dentate gyrus]] and hippocampal region CA3; layer III projects primarily to hippocampal region CA1 and the [[subiculum]]. These layers receive input from other cortical areas, especially associational, [[Perirhinal cortex|perirhinal]], and [[Parahippocampal gyrus|parahippocampal]] cortices, as well as [[prefrontal cortex]]. EC as a whole, therefore, receives highly processed input from every sensory modality, as well as input relating to ongoing cognitive processes, though it should be stressed that, within EC, this information remains at least partially segregated.

The deep layers, especially layer V, receive one of the three main outputs of the [[hippocampus]] and, in turn, reciprocate connections from other cortical areas that project to superficial EC.

The rodent entorhinal cortex shows a modular organization, with different properties and connections in different areas.

==Neuron information processing==
In 2005, it was discovered that entorhinal cortex contains a neural map of the spatial environment in rats.<ref name="Hafting">{{cite journal |author=Hafting T, Fyhn M, Molden S, Moser M, Moser E |title=Microstructure of a spatial map in the entorhinal cortex |journal=Nature |volume=436 |issue=7052 |pages=801–6 |year=2005 |pmid=15965463 | doi = 10.1038/nature03721 |bibcode=2005Natur.436..801H}}</ref> In 2014, John O'Keefe, May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser received the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, partly because of this discovery.<ref>{{cite web|title=Overview of Nobel Prize laureates in Physiology or Medicine|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/}}</ref>

Neurons in the [[lateral entorhinal cortex]] exhibit little spatial selectivity,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hargreaves E, Rao G, Lee I, Knierim J |title=Major dissociation between medial and lateral entorhinal input to dorsal hippocampus |journal=Science |volume=308 |issue=5729 |pages=1792–4 |year=2005 |pmid=15961670 |doi=10.1126/science.1110449|bibcode = 2005Sci...308.1792H }}</ref> whereas neurons of the [[medial entorhinal cortex]] (MEA), exhibit multiple "place fields" that are arranged in an hexagonal pattern, and are, therefore, called "[[grid cells]]". These fields and spacing between fields increase from the dorso-lateral MEA to the ventro-medial MEA.<ref name="Hafting" /><ref>{{cite journal |author=Fyhn M, Molden S, Witter M, Moser E, Moser M |title=Spatial representation in the entorhinal cortex |journal=Science |volume=305 |issue=5688 |pages=1258–64 |year=2004 |pmid=15333832 |doi=10.1126/science.1099901 |bibcode=2004Sci...305.1258F}}</ref>

The same group of researchers have found speed cells in the medial entorhinal cortex of rats. The speed of movement is translated from proprioceptive information and is represented as firing rates in these cells. The cells are known to fire in correlation to future speed of the rodent. <ref name="Kropff">{{cite journal | author = Kropff Em, Carmichael J E, Moser M-B, Moser E-I | year = 2015 | title = Speed cells in the medial entorhinal cortex | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 523 | pages = 419-424 | doi = 10.1038/nature14622 |bibcode = 2015Natur.523..419K }}</ref>

[[Single-unit recording]] of neurons in humans playing [[video game]]s find path cells in the EC, the activity of which indicates whether a person is taking a clockwise or counterclockwise path. Such EC "direction" path cells show this directional activity irrespective of the location of where a person experiences themselves, which contrasts them to place cells in the hippocampus, which are activated by specific locations.<ref name="Jacobs">{{cite journal | author = Jacobs J, Kahana MJ, Ekstrom AD, Mollison MV, Fried I | year = 2010 | title = A sense of direction in human entorhinal cortex | url = | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 107 | issue = 14| pages = 6487–6492 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0911213107 | pmid = 20308554 | pmc=2851993|bibcode = 2010PNAS..107.6487J }}</ref>

EC neurons process general information such as directional activity in the environment, which contrasts to that of the hippocampal neurons, which usually encode information about specific places. This suggests that EC encodes general properties about current contexts that are then used by hippocampus to create unique representations from combinations of these properties.<ref name="Jacobs"/>

==Alzheimer's disease==
The entorhinal cortex is the first area of the brain to be affected in [[Alzheimer's disease]]; a recent functional [[magnetic resonance imaging]] study has localised the area to the lateral entorhinal cortex.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Khan UA, Liu L, Provenzano FA, Berman DE, Profaci CP, Sloan R, Mayeux R, Duff KE, Small SA.|year=2013|title=Molecular drivers and cortical spread of lateral entorhinal cortex dysfunction in preclinical Alzheimer’s disease|journal=[[Nature Neuroscience]]|doi=10.1038/nn.3606}}</ref> Lopez ''et al.'' <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lopez|first1=M.

These authors also found that the volume of the left entorhinal cortex inversely correlates with the level of alpha band phase synchronization between the right anterior cingulate and temporo-occipital regions.

In 2012, neuroscientists at [[UCLA]] conducted an experiment using a virtual taxi video game connected to seven epilepsy patients with electrodes already implanted in their brains, allowing the researchers to monitor neuronal activity whenever memories were being formed. As the researchers stimulated the nerve fibers of each of the patients' entorhinal cortex as they were learning, they were then able to better navigate themselves through various routes and recognize landmarks more quickly. This signified an improvement in the patients' spatial memory.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Suthana|first1=N.|last2=Haneef|first2=Z.|last3=Stern|first3=J.|last4=Mukamel|first4=R.|last5=Behnke|first5=E.|last6=Knowlton|first6=B.|last7=Fried|first7=I.|year=2012|title=Memory Enhancement and Deep-Brain Stimulation of the Entorhinal Area|journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine]]|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1107212}}</ref>
