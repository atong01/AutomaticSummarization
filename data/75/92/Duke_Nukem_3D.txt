'''''Duke Nukem 3D''''' is a [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[3D Realms]] and published by [[GT Interactive Software]]. The full version of the game was originally released for [[MS-DOS]] in May 1996 as version 1.3d, while the shareware version was released on January 29, 1996. It is a sequel to the [[platform game]]s ''[[Duke Nukem (1991 video game)|Duke Nukem]]'' and ''[[Duke Nukem II]]'', published by 3D Realms. The ''Plutonium PAK'', an expansion pack which updated the game to version 1.4 and added a fourth eleven-level episode, was released in November 1996. The ''Atomic Edition'', a standalone version of the game that included the content from the ''Plutonium PAK'' and updated the game to version 1.5, was later released; the original version of ''Duke Nukem 3D'' has since been discontinued.

''Duke Nukem 3D'' features the adventures of the titular [[machismo|macho]] [[Duke Nukem (character)|Duke Nukem]], voiced by [[Jon St. John]], who fights against an [[alien invasion]] on Earth. Along with ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'' and ''[[Doom (video game)|Doom]]'', ''Duke Nukem 3D'' is considered to be responsible for popularizing first-person shooters, and was released to major acclaim. Reviewers praised the interactivity of the environments, gameplay, level design, and unique risqu√© humor, a mix of pop-culture satire and lampooning of over-the-top Hollywood action heroes. The game's violent nature, [[eroticism|erotic elements]], and [[Gender representation in video games|portrayal of women]] incited controversy.

After [[Development of Duke Nukem Forever|fifteen years]] in [[development hell]], a direct sequel was released called ''[[Duke Nukem Forever]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Duke3d 000.png|thumb|left|''Duke Nukem 3D'' gameplay at the beginning of the first level ("Hollywood Holocaust")]]
As a [[first-person shooter]] whose gameplay is similar to ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', the gameplay of ''Duke Nukem 3D'' involves moving through levels presented from the protagonist's point of view, shooting enemies on the way. The environments in ''Duke Nukem 3D'' are highly destructible and interactive; most props can be destroyed by the player.<ref name="history1">{{cite web|title = The History of Duke Nukem: Duke Enters The Third Dimension|url = http://uk.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/duke_hist/p3_01.html|work = [[GameSpot]]|accessdate = 1 July 2009}}</ref><ref name="gamespotr">{{cite web|author = Tim Soete|title = Duke Nukem 3D Review for PC|url = http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/dukenukem3d/review.html|date = 1 May 1996|work = [[GameSpot]]|accessdate = 1 July 2009}}</ref>

Levels were designed in a fairly non-linear manner such that players can advantageously use [[air duct]]s, back doors, and sewers to avoid enemies or find hidden caches. These locations are also filled with objects with which the player can interact, that either benefit the player in some form, light switches make it easier to see, while [[water fountain]]s and broken [[hydrant]]s provide some health points or simply diversion, and tipping [[strippers]] provokes a quote from Duke, and a provocative reveal from the dancer.

Weapons include the "Mighty Foot" (a basic kick attack), a [[pistol]], a [[shotgun]], a triple-barrelled [[chain gun]], a [[Rocket-propelled grenade|rocket-propelled grenade launcher]], [[pipe bomb]]s, freeze and [[shrink ray]]s, laser [[land mines]], and the rapid fire "Devastator" rocket launcher. There is also an extra weapon known as the "Expander", the opposite of the shrink ray weapon, which is only available in the ''Atomic Edition'' version of the game.

Various items can be picked up during gameplay. The portable [[First-aid kit|medkit]] allows players to heal Duke at will. [[Steroid]]s speed up Duke's movement, as well as instantly reversing the effects of the shrink ray weapon and increasing the strength of Duke's Mighty Foot for a short period. [[Night vision]] goggles allow players to see enemies in the dark. The "HoloDuke" device projects a [[hologram]] of Duke which can be used to distract enemies. Protective boots allow Duke to cross dangerously hot or toxic terrain. In sections where progress requires more aquatic legwork, [[scuba gear]], an [[aqua-lung]], allows Duke to take longer trips underwater. Duke's [[jet pack]] allows the player to move vertically and gain access to otherwise inaccessible areas.

The game features a wide variety of enemies; some of which are [[extraterrestrial life in culture|aliens]] and other [[mutant (fictional)|mutated]] humans. The [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] have been turned into "Pig Cops", a [[play on words|play]] on the derogatory term "pig" for police officers, with '''LARD''' emblazoned on their uniforms. As is usual for a first-person shooter, Duke Nukem encounters a large number of lesser foes, as well as [[boss (video gaming)|bosses]], usually at the end of episodes. Like Duke, these enemies have access to a wide range of weapons and equipment, and some weaker enemies have jet packs.

===Multiplayer===
''Duke Nukem 3D'' features multiplayer. At the time of its release, Internet-based gaming was just beginning. ''Duke Nukem 3D'' did not support the [[TCP/IP]] client/server model, instead based its network play on the [[IPX]] [[LAN]], modem or serial cable. ''Duke Nukem 3D'' players often either battled modem-to-modem, using the IPX network utility [[Kali (software)|Kali]]<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.kali.net/games.asp|title= Kali compatible games|accessdate= March 25, 2014}}</ref> or the [[Total Entertainment Network]] (TEN) online pay service.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ten.net/199706/html/ten__duke_nukem.html|title= Duke Nukem 3D on Ten.net|accessdate= March 25, 2014}}</ref> Kali allowed users to connect to a chat room to host and join games. ''Duke Nukem 3D'' was one of the more popular games on TEN prior to the closure of the network in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Total Entertainment Network|url=http://www.bestinclass.com/about/ten|website=BestInClass.com|accessdate=14 January 2015|date=2012}}</ref> The game was also supported by [[DWANGO]].<ref name=UGO>{{cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/games/history-of-online-gaming-1993-1994|title=History of Online Gaming - 1993-1994: DOOM and DWANGO|date=July 10, 2008|accessdate=January 16, 2013|publisher=UGO}}</ref>

''Duke Nukem 3D''{{'}}s levels were often used as the battlegrounds for these encounters, and users were even able to create their own [[level (video gaming)|levels]], or maps, using the [[Build engine|level editor]] bundled with the game, which was also used by the developers to design the initial levels.<ref name="dukemaps">{{cite web|title=Duke Maps Site: Free user-generated Duke Nukem 3D Maps created with the Build engine|url=http://dukemaps.tvgio.com|publisher=user-generated content freely distributed|accessdate=10 July 2011}}</ref> The game also features co-operative play, co-op, which allows players to complete the story based single player mode together. In ''Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition'', a new game play mode was introduced: Duke-Tag, a "[[capture the flag]]" style mode.

''Duke Nukem 3D'' has been ported to run on modern Microsoft Windows variants including Windows XP, Windows 7, and Windows 8. This has been made possible since the game's source code was publicly released in 2003. Various [[source port]]s have been made including ''EDuke32'', ''JFDuke3D'', ''hDuke'', and ''xDuke''. All four offer the original visual appearance of the game, while ''EDuke32'' also supports [[OpenGL]] rendering including the capability to use fan-created modern graphics using the High Resolution Pack.<ref name="hrp">{{cite web|title=Duke Nukem 3D: High Resolution Pack|url=http://hrp.duke4.net/|date=2012-09-15|accessdate=2012-09-16}}</ref> ''hDuke'' and ''xDuke'' can still be played online in multiplayer 'DukeMatch' format using launchers such as Duke Matcher and YANG, both freely available. ''EDuke32''{{'}}s multiplayer is in a state of [[development hell]] following an attempt to rewrite the network functionality using a [[client-server model]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Plot==

===Setting===
''Duke Nukem 3D'' is set on Earth "sometime in the early 21st century".<ref name="3drealms">{{cite web|title=3D Realms Site: Duke Nukem 3D Atomic Edition|url=http://legacy.3drealms.com/duke3d/index.html|publisher=[[3D Realms]]|accessdate=1 July 2009}}</ref> The levels of ''Duke Nukem 3D'' take players outdoors and indoors through rendered street scenes, military bases, [[desert]]s, a flooded city, [[space station]]s, moon bases, and a [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]] restaurant.

The game contains several humorous references to pop culture. Some of Duke's lines are drawn from movies such as ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', ''[[Dirty Harry]]'', ''[[Evil Dead II]]'', ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'',<ref name="stuff gaming greats">{{cite web | url=http://www.stuff.tv/news/past-and-future/gaming-greats/gaming-greats-%E2%80%93-duke-nukem-3d-1996 | title=Gaming Greats ‚Äì Duke Nukem 3D (1996) | publisher=[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]] | work=stuff.tv | date=Apr 7, 2011 | accessdate=January 30, 2012 | quote="I'm gonna rip off your head and excrete down your neck" [...] "It's time to kick ass and chew bubble gum... and I‚Äôm all outta gum." [...] That bubblegum line first appeared in the 1988 film They Live.

Players will encounter corpses of famous characters such as [[Luke Skywalker]], [[Indiana Jones]], [[Snake Plissken]], [[Doomguy|the protagonist]] of ''[[Doom (series)|Doom]]'', and a smashed [[Terminator (character)|T-800]]. In the first episode, players navigate a tunnel in the wall of a prison cell hidden behind a poster, just like in ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]''. During the second episode, players can see [[Monolith (Space Odyssey)|The Monolith]] (from ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'') on the moon. In the bathroom of the first level, [[867-5309]] is written on a wall.

The game cover itself is a parody of ''[[Army of Darkness]]'', with Duke posing as [[Ash Williams]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

=== Story ===

There is little story in the game, only a brief text prelude located under "Help" in the Main Menu, and a few [[cutscene]]s after the completion of an episode. The game picks up right after the events of ''[[Duke Nukem II]]'', with Duke returning to Earth in his space cruiser. As Duke descends on [[Los Angeles]] in hopes of taking a vacation, his ship is shot down by unknown hostiles. While sending a distress signal, Duke learns that aliens are attacking Los Angeles and have mutated the [[LAPD]]. With his vacation plans now ruined, Duke hits the "eject" button, and vows to do whatever it takes to stop the alien invasion.

In "Episode One: ''L.A. Meltdown''", Duke fights his way through a [[dystopian]] Los Angeles. At a [[strip club]], he is captured by pig-cops, but escapes the alien-controlled penitentiary and tracks down the alien cruiser responsible for the invasion in the [[San Andreas Fault]]. Duke discovers that the aliens were capturing women, and detonates the ship. Levels in this episode include a movie theater, a Red Light District, a prison, and a nuclear-waste disposal facility.

In "Episode Two: ''Lunar Apocalypse''", Duke journeys to [[outer space|space]], where he finds many of the captured women held in various [[incubator (neonatal)|incubator]]s throughout space stations that had been conquered by the aliens. Duke reaches the alien mothership on the Moon and kills an alien Overlord. As Duke inspects the ship's computer, it is revealed that the plot to capture women was merely a ruse to distract him. The aliens have already begun their attack on Earth.

In "Episode Three: ''Shrapnel City''", Duke battles the massive alien resistance through Los Angeles once again, and kills the leader of alien menace: the Cycloid Emperor. The game ends as Duke promises that after some "[[R&R (military)|R&R]]", he will be "...ready for more action!", as an anonymous woman calls him back to bed. Levels in this episode include a sushi bar, a movie set, a subway, and a hotel.

The story continues in the ''Atomic Edition''. In "Episode Four: ''The Birth''", it is revealed that the aliens used a captured woman to give birth to the Alien Queen, a creature which can quickly spawn deadly alien protector drones. Duke is dispatched back to Los Angeles to fight hordes of aliens, including the protector drones. Eventually, Duke finds the lair of the Alien Queen, and kills her, thus thwarting the alien plot. Levels in this episode include a fast-food restaurant ("Duke Burger"), a supermarket, a Disneyland parody called "Babe Land," a police station, the [[Exxon Valdez]], and [[Area 51]].

==Development==
''Duke Nukem 3D'' was developed on a budget of roughly $300,000.<ref name="Barton99">Barton, Matt (22 April 2011). [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_i3-aoHnww Matt Chat 99: Duke Nukem with Scott Miller], YouTube.</ref> The development team consisted of eight people for most of the development cycle, increasing to 12 or 13 people near the end.<ref name="Barton99"/> [[Scott Miller (entrepreneur)|Scott Miller]] of 3D Realms recalled that "with ''Duke 3D'', unlike every shooter that came before, we wanted to have sort of real life locations like a cinema theatre, you know, strip club, bookstores..."<ref name="Barton99"/>

''LameDuke'' is a [[beta version]] of ''Duke Nukem 3D'', which was released by 3D Realms as a "bonus" one year after the release of the official version. It has been released as is, with no support.<ref>{{cite web|title=3D Realms Site: Master Download Page|url=http://legacy.3drealms.com/downloads.html|publisher=3D Realms|accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref> ''LameDuke'' features four episodes: ''Mr. Caliber'', ''Mission Cockroach'', ''Suck Hole'', and ''Hard Landing''. Certain weapons were altered from the original versions and/or removed.

[[Lee Jackson (composer)|Lee Jackson]]'s theme song "Grabbag" has elicited many spin-offs and remixes over the years by both fans and professional musicians, including an officially sanctioned studio version by the popular [[thrash metal]] outfit [[Megadeth]]. Another version of the song was recorded by [[Chris Kline]] in August 2005. [[3D Realms]] featured it on the front page of their website and contracted with Kline to use it to promote their [[Xbox Live]] release of ''Duke Nukem 3D''.<ref name="YT_vertexguy_dukeXBL">{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NExBO-QOdIU |title=Official Duke Nukem 3D Xbox LIVE Arcade Trailer |accessdate=2009-08-04 |publisher=[[3D Realms]]}}</ref>

*'''''Full Version''''': The full version was the first official version released in May 1996 and contained the original 3 episodes. It also includes the full versions of ''Duke Nukem'' and ''Duke Nukem II'' as bonus content.

*'''''Plutonium PAK/Atomic Edition''''': The ''Atomic Edition'' of ''Duke Nukem 3D'' was released in November 1996 as a standalone game. It contained the original 3 episodes, as well as a new eleven-level fourth episode, bringing the level total to 41 as opposed to 30 in the original ''Duke Nukem 3D''. The ''Plutonium PAK'' was released as an upgrade package to convert the original release of ''Duke Nukem 3D'' (v1.3d) to the ''Atomic Edition'' (v1.4, later updated to v1.5 with the standalone ''Atomic Edition'' release and via a free download patch for the ''Plutonium PAK'' version on 3D Realms' website). It introduced two new enemies, the Pig Cop Tank and the Protector Drone, a new final boss, the Alien Queen, and a new weapon, the Expander. Changes to the script made the game easier to [[mod (video gaming)|mod]], and players could set up a multiplayer session against CPU [[artificial intelligence (video games)|bots]]. This is the only official add-on for the game developed by 3D Realms. Unlike the original ''Duke Nukem 3D'', however, the ''Atomic Edition'' does not include ''Duke Nukem'' and ''Duke Nukem II''.

President [[Bill Clinton]] is captured by alien forces, and Duke must save him. This expansion pack featured levels that were based on real-world locations, such as: the [[White House]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] headquarters, the [[Smithsonian]] museum, and the [[Washington Monument]] and other places in Washington, D.C. The add-on was also included as part of an official compilation called ''Duke Nukem: Kill-A-Ton Collection'' through business deals with 3D Realms. Charlie Wiederhold created levels for this add-on.
*'''''Duke Caribbean: Life's a Beach''''': This is an authorized add-on developed by Sunstorm Interactive and published by WizardWorks Software; it was released in December 1997. Duke is relaxing on a tropical island when he discovers that the aliens are having their own "vacation". This add-on includes a sunny Caribbean theme with levels that take place on beaches and vacation hotels. Charlie Wiederhold created several levels for this add-on. Wiederhold was later hired by 3D Realms to work on the sequel ''[[Duke Nukem Forever]]''.
*'''''Duke: Nuclear Winter''''': This is an authorized add-on developed by Simply Silly Software and published by WizardWorks Software; it was released in December 1997. [[Santa Claus]] is being mind-controlled by aliens into causing trouble on Earth. Several of the levels take place near the [[North Pole]].

*'''''Duke Assault''''': An add-on released in 1997 containing over 1,500 levels for ''Duke Nukem 3D''.

*'''''Duke Nukem's Penthouse Paradise''''': This is an official add-on for ''Duke Nukem 3D'', available exclusively from [[GT Interactive]] and [[Penthouse Magazine]]. Taking place between ''Duke Nukem 3D'' and the ''Atomic Edition'', aliens interrupt Duke's vacation and a couple of Penthouse photo shoots. Duke has to fight his way through a hotel, clubs, and, finally, the Penthouse offices.

===Console versions and add-ons===
Duke Nukem 3D was ported to many of the consoles of the time. All of the ports featured some sort of new content.

*'''''Duke Nukem 3D''''' ([[Game.com]]) was released in 1997 in the USA only.<ref>[http://www.gamefaqs.com/gamecom/564274-duke-nukem-3d/data Game.com release data], GameFAQs.com.</ref> Unlike every other version of the game, Duke Nukem cannot turn; he can only move forward, backward, and strafe to the left or right. Due to the Game.com's monochrome screen, it is also the only version to lack color. It only includes four levels from each of the original three episodes for a total of 12 levels. These levels were modified to accommodate Duke Nukem's inability to turn.

*'''''Duke Nukem 3D''''' ([[Sega Saturn]]) was ported by [[Lobotomy Software]] and published by [[Sega]] in 1997. It retains the original name and uses Lobotomy Software's own fully 3D ''SlaveDriver'' engine. This version uses the [[Sega NetLink]] for online gaming, and has built-in support for the Saturn's analog pad. It also includes a hidden multiplayer mini-game called ''[[Death Tank|Death Tank Zwei]]'', and an exclusive bonus level called Urea 51, accessed through the level "Fahrenheit". It was the final game branded by Sega of America under the Deep Water label, employed for games featuring adult content such as this game and ''[[Eternal Champions: Challenge from the Dark Side]]''.

*'''''Duke Nukem: Total Meltdown''''' (titled simply ''Duke Nukem'' in Europe), the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] port released in 1997, contains all three original episodes, plus a new fourth episode, ''Plug 'n' Pray'', which includes six extra levels and a secret level. The secret level was also included in the PC version. The new episode features several new enemies, including three new types of Pig Cops, and a new final boss, the CyberKeef. This version also features remixed music, some rearranged from the PC version, and some original, in streaming XA-Audio made by [[Mark Knight (sound designer)|Mark Knight]].<ref name="PSX Duke Nukem: Total Meltdown">{{cite web|url=http://psx.ign.com/objects/002/002194.html |title=IGN: Duke Nukem: Total Meltdown |publisher=Psx.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-21}}</ref>

[[File:Duke Nukem 64.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nintendo 64]] port. Note its level design changes and that some sprites were replaced with polygonal models.]]
*'''''Duke Nukem 64''''' is a port released in 1997 for the [[Nintendo 64]] which features a [[split screen (computer graphics)|split screen]] 4-player mode. In-game music was removed and, due to the port's [[censorship]], many items were renamed to avoid drug and sex references, and new lines of dialogue were recorded specifically for this version to remove swearing. Several levels were altered to include areas from the ''Atomic Edition'', such as a Duke Burger outlet in the second level which was not in the original PC version. Levels are played sequentially instead of as separate episodes. Other changes include the addition of four new weapons, dual sub-machine guns, a grenade launcher, a missile launcher, and the Plasma Cannon, alternative ammo types for the pistol, shotgun, and missile launcher, and a fully 3D model for the Cycloid Emperor boss. The Protector Drone, from the ''Atomic Edition'', also appears a few times in the standard levels.

[[File:Duke Nukem 3D Genesis.png|thumb|Mega Drive/Genesis port]]
*'''''Duke Nukem 3D''''' ([[Sega Genesis]]) was released in 1998 by [[Tec Toy]]. The visuals were drastically simplified, being closer to early shooters like ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]''. It consisted solely of ''Lunar Apocalypse'', the second from the original game's three episodes, which was heavily modified to suit the game engine. This version was released in [[South America]] only.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sega-16.com/2007/11/duke-nukem-3d/ |title=Review: Duke Nukem 3D |publisher=Sega-16.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24}}</ref> In 2015, Piko Interactive acquired the rights to the port from Tec Toy and released it worldwide in cartridge form on October 16, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Matulef|first1=Jeffrey|title=Duke Nukem 3D finally gets a Sega Mega Drive release|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-10-16-duke-nukem-3d-finally-gets-a-sega-mega-drive-release|website=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=17 October 2015|date=16 October 2015}}</ref>

==Source ports==

Following the release of the ''Doom'' source code in 1997, gamers wanted a similar source code release from 3D Realms. The last major game to make use of the ''Duke Nukem 3D'' source code was TNT Team's ''WWII GI'' in 1999. Its programmer, Matthew Saettler, obtained permission from 3D Realms to expand the gameplay enhancements done on ''WWII GI'' to ''Duke Nukem 3D''.

''EDuke'' was a semi-official branch of ''Duke Nukem 3D'' that was released as a patch as ''Duke Nukem 3D'' v2.0 for Atomic Edition users on July 28, 2000. It included a demo mod made by several beta testers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saettler.com/eduke/ |title=Enhanced Duke Nukem 3D |publisher=Saettler.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://legacy.3drealms.com/news/2000/07/eduke_patch_rel.html |title=3D Realms News: EDuke Patch Released! |publisher=3drealms.com |date=2000-07-28 |accessdate=2009-12-21}}</ref> It focused primarily on enhancing the CON scripting language in ways which allowed those modifying the game to do much more with the system than originally possible. Though a further version was planned, it never made it out of beta. It was eventually canceled due to programmer time constraints. About a month after the release of the ''Duke Nukem 3D'' source code, ''[[Blood (video game)|Blood]]'' project manager Matt Saettler released the source code for both EDuke v2.0 and EDuke v2.1, the test version of which would have eventually become the next EDuke release, under the GPL.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The [[source code]] to the ''Duke Nukem 3D'' v1.5 executable, which uses the Build engine, was released as [[free software]] under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] on April 1, 2003.<ref>{{cite web|last=Siegler|first=Joe|title=3D Realms News: Duke Nukem 3D Source Code Released |url=http://legacy.3drealms.com/news/2003/04/duke_nukem_3d_s_4.html|publisher=3D Realms |accessdate=14 January 2015|date=April 1, 2003}}</ref> The game content remains under a proprietary license. The game was quickly ported by enthusiasts to modern operating systems.

The first ''Duke Nukem 3D'' port was from icculus.org. It is a cross-platform project that allows the game to be played on: [[AmigaOS]], [[AmigaOS 4]], [[AROS]], [[BeOS]], [[FreeBSD]], [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]], [[MorphOS]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] rather than DOS. The icculus.org codebase would later be used as the base for several other ports, including ''Duke3d_32''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Duke3d_w32 |url=http://www.rancidmeat.com/project.php3?id=1 Duke3d_w32|website=Rancidmeat.com|accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref>

Another popular early project was Jonathon Fowler's ''JFDuke3D'', which, in December 2003, received backing from the original author of Build, programmer [[Ken Silverman]].<ref name="jfduke3d">{{cite web|url=http://www.jonof.id.au/jfduke3d |title=JonoF's Duke Nukem 3D Port (JFDuke3D) |publisher=Jonathon Fowler |date=2005-10-09 |accessdate=2012-09-16}}</ref> Fowler, in cooperation with Silverman, released a new version of ''JFDuke3D'' using [[Build engine#Polymost|Polymost]], an [[OpenGL]]-enhanced renderer for Build which allows hardware acceleration and 3D model support along with 32-bit color high resolution textures. Another project based on ''JFDuke3D'' called ''xDuke'', unrelated to the ''xDuke'' project based on ''Duke3d_w32'', runs on the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]. Silverman has since helped Fowler with a large portion of other engine work, including updating the network code, and helping to maintain various other aspects of the engine.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Development appears to have stopped; as of January 2015, there have been no new versions since October 9, 2005.

While a few short-lived [[DOS]]-based ''EDuke'' projects emerged, it was not until the release of ''EDuke32'', an extended version of ''Duke3D'' incorporating variants of both Fowler's [[Microsoft Windows]] ''JFDuke3D'' code, and Saettler's ''EDuke code'', by one of 3D Realms' forum moderators in late 2004, that ''EDuke's'' scripting extensions received community focus.<ref name="eduke32">{{cite web|url=http://www.eduke32.com/ |title=EDuke32 - Duke3D for Windows, Linux and OS X |publisher=Richard "TerminX" Gobeille |accessdate=2012-09-16}}</ref> Among the various enhancements, support for advanced [[shader model]] 3.0 based graphics was added to ''EDuke32'' during late 2008-early 2009. In June 2008, thanks to significant porting contributions from the [[DOSBox]] team, ''EDuke32'' became the only ''Duke Nukem 3D'' port to compile and run natively on [[64-bit]] Linux systems without the use of a 32-bit compatibility environment.

On April 1, 2009, an [[OpenGL]] Shader Model 3.0 renderer was revealed to have been developed for ''EDuke32'', named ''Polymer'' to distinguish from Ken Silverman's ''Polymost''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} It allows for much more modern effects such as dynamic lighting and [[normal mapping]]. Although Polymer is fully functional, it is technically incomplete and unoptimized, and is still in development. As of the fifth installment of the ''High Resolution Pack'', released in 2011, the Polymer renderer is mandatory. Another significant development of ''EDuke32'' in 2011, is true room over room (TROR), where sectors can be placed over other sectors, and can be seen at the same time. In practice, this allows for true 3-dimensional level design that was previously impossible, although the engine is still 2D.

On December 18, 2012, ''Chocolate Duke3D''<ref name="ChocolateDuke3D">{{cite web|url=https://github.com/fabiensanglard/chocolate_duke3D |title=Chocolate Duke3D - Duke3D for Windows, Linux and OS X |publisher=Fabien Sanglard |accessdate=2012-09-16}}</ref> port was released.

In February 2013, a source code review article was published that described the internal working of the code.<ref>{{cite web|title=Duke Nukem 3D Code Review|url=http://fabiensanglard.net/duke3d/index.php|website=Fabien Sanglard's Website|accessdate=14 January 2015|date=February 14, 2013}}</ref>

''Duke Nukem 3D'' was a commercial hit, selling about 3.5 million copies.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/12/fail_duke_nukem|title=Learn to Let Go: How Success Killed Duke Nukem|author=Clive Thompson|publisher=Wired|date=2009-12-21}}</ref> Reviewers paid a lot of attention to the sexual content within the game. Reception of this element varied: Tim Soete of [[GameSpot]] felt that it was "morally questionable",<ref name="gamespotr" /> while the [[Game Revolution]] reviewer noted that it was "done in a tongue-in-cheek manner," and he was "not personally offended".<ref>{{cite web|title=Duke Nukem 3D review for the PC|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/pc/duke-nukem-3d|date=5 June 1996|work=[[Game Revolution]]|accessdate=1 July 2009}}</ref> [[GamingOnLinux]] reviewer Hamish Paul Wilson commented in a later retrospective how the game's "dark dystopian atmosphere filled with pornography and consumerist decadence" in his view helped to ground "the game's more outlandish and obscene moments in context", concluding that "in a world as perverse as this, someone like Duke becoming its hero seems almost inevitable."<ref name="GamingOnLinux">{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Hamish|url=https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/the-big-three-build-engine-games-on-gog.5491|title=The Big Three Build Engine Games On GOG|publisher=[[GamingOnLinux]]|date=23 June 2015|accessdate=23 June 2015}}</ref>

===Controversy===
The game has been attacked by some critics, who allege that it promotes [[pornography]] and murder. Media Watch {{Unreliable source?|date=January 2015}} made the following comments about the game:

<blockquote class="toccolours">
''Duke Nukem 3D'' moves the 'shooter' through pornography stores, where Duke can use XXX sex posters for target practice. Duke throws cash at a prostituted woman telling her to 'Shake it, Baby' his gun ever ready. In the game bonus points are awarded for the murder of these mostly prostituted and partially nude women. Duke blows up [[stained glass]] windows in an empty church or goes to [[strip club]]s where Japanese women lower their [[kimono]]s exposing their breasts. Duke is encouraged to kill defenseless, often bound women.<ref>{{cite web|title=Teaching Boys to Kill|url=http://www.mediawatch.com/wordpress/?p=13|website=Media Watch|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090215043239/http://www.mediawatch.com/wordpress/?p=13|archivedate=February 15, 2009|date=October 9, 2004}}</ref></blockquote>

However, the game does not have a scoring or rewards system of any kind, either for killing women or doing anything else. Instead, the game spawns even more enemies if players kill a woman. No weapons, items, or power-ups, are ever given to players in return for violence towards women of any kind. Though a cosmetic shower of dollar bills appears if a stripper is killed, these cannot be collected and provide no gameplay or bonus score. The only exception is the "Fusion Station" level, where killing a certain woman will yield a shotgun as well as spawn an enemy. In response to the criticism encountered, [[Censorship|censored]] versions of the game were released in certain countries to avoid it being banned altogether. A similar censored version was carried at [[Wal-Mart]] retail stores in the United States.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In Australia, the game was originally refused classification on release.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} 3D Realms repackaged the game with the parental lock feature permanently enabled, although a patch available on the 3D Realms website allowed the user to revert the game back into its uncensored US version.<ref>{{cite web|title=Duke Nukem 3D Patch Guide|url=http://dukertcm.com/knowledge-base/documents-online/setup-patch-guide-duke3d.html|website=Build RCTM|accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref> The [[Office of Film and Literature Classification (Australia)|OFLC]] then attempted to have the game pulled from the shelves, but it was discovered that the distributor had notified them of this fact and the rating could not be surrendered; six months later, the game was reclassified and released uncensored with an MA15+ rating.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In Germany, the [[Bundespr√ºfstelle f√ºr jugendgef√§hrdende Medien|BPjM]] placed the game on their "List B" ("List of Media Harmful to Young People") of videos games, thus prohibiting its advertisement in the public. However, it was not fully confiscated, meaning that an adult could still request to see the game and buy it.<ref>{{cite web|title=Duke Nukem 3D for DOS|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/duke-nukem-3d|website=[[MobyGames]]|accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref> In 1999, ''Duke Nukem 3D'' was banned in Brazil, along with ''Doom'' and several other first-person shooters after a rampage, in and around a movie theater, was supposedly inspired by the first level in the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2447352.html|title=Brazil Bans More Games|author=Micheal Mullen|publisher=GameSpot}}</ref>

Despite such concerns from critics, legislators, and publishers, Scott Miller later recounted that 3D Realms saw very little negative feedback to the game's controversial elements from actual gamers or their parents.<ref name="Barton99"/> He pointed out that ''Duke Nukem 3D'' was appropriately rated "M" and had no real nudity, and speculated that that was enough to make it inoffensive to the general public.<ref name="Barton99"/>
