With his vacation plans now ruined, Duke hits the &quot;eject&quot; button, and vows to do whatever it takes to stop the alien invasion.</paragraph><paragraph>In &quot;Episode One:<space/><italics>L.A.

Duke reaches the alien mothership on the Moon and kills an alien Overlord. As Duke inspects the ship's computer, it is revealed that the plot to capture women was merely a ruse to distract him. The aliens have already begun their attack on Earth.</paragraph><paragraph>In &quot;Episode Three:<space/><italics>Shrapnel City</italics>&quot;, Duke battles the massive alien resistance through Los Angeles once again, and kills the leader of alien menace: the Cycloid Emperor. The game ends as Duke promises that after some &quot;<link><target>R&amp;R (military)</target><part>R&amp;R</part></link>&quot;, he will be &quot;...ready for more action!&quot;, as an anonymous woman calls him back to bed. Levels in this episode include a sushi bar, a movie set, a subway, and a hotel.</paragraph><paragraph>The story continues in the<space/><italics>Atomic Edition</italics>.

Duke is dispatched back to Los Angeles to fight hordes of aliens, including the protector drones. Eventually, Duke finds the lair of the Alien Queen, and kills her, thus thwarting the alien plot.
