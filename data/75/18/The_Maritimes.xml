After the French surrender, Louisbourg was thoroughly destroyed by British engineers to ensure it would never be reclaimed. With the fall of Louisbourg, French and Mi'kmaq resistance in the region crumbled. British forces seized remaining French control over Acadia in the coming months, with le-Saint-Jean falling in 1759 to British forces on their way to Quebec City for the Siege of Quebec and ensuing Battle of the Plains of Abraham.</paragraph><paragraph>The war ended and Britain had gained control over the entire Maritime region.</paragraph><heading level='3'>American Revolution</heading><paragraph>Following the<space/><link><target>Seven Years' War</target></link>, empty Acadian lands were settled first by<space/><link><target>New England Planters</target></link><space/>and then by immigrants brought from<space/><link><target>Yorkshire Emigration to Nova Scotia</target><part>Yorkshire</part></link>. le-Royale was renamed Cape Breton Island and incorporated into the Colony of Nova Scotia.</paragraph><paragraph>Both the colonies of Nova Scotia (present-day Nova Scotia and New Brunswick) and St. John's Island (Prince Edward Island) were affected by the<space/><link><target>American Revolutionary War</target></link>, largely by privateering against American shipping, but several coastal communities were also the targets of American raiders. Charlottetown, the capital of the new colony of St. John's Island, was ransacked in 1775 with the provincial secretary kidnapped and the Great Seal stolen. The largest military action in the Maritimes during the revolutionary war was the attack on<space/><link><target>Battle of Fort Cumberland</target><part>Fort Cumberland</part></link><space/>(the renamed<space/><link><target>Fort Beausejour</target></link>) in 1776 by a force of American sympathizers led by<space/><link><target>Jonathan Eddy</target></link>. The fort was partially overrun after a month-long siege, but the attackers were ultimately repelled after the arrival of British reinforcements from Halifax.</paragraph><paragraph>The most significant impact from this war was the settling of large numbers of<space/><link><target>Loyalist (American Revolution)</target><part>Loyalist</part></link><space/>refugees in the region, especially in Shelburne and Parrtown (Saint John). Following the<space/><link><target>Treaty of Paris (1783)</target><part>Treaty of Paris</part></link><space/>in 1783, Loyalist settlers in what would become New Brunswick persuaded British administrators to split the Colony of Nova Scotia to create the new colony of New Brunswick in 1784. At the same time, another part of the Colony of Nova Scotia, Cape Breton Island, was split off to become the Colony of Cape Breton Island.The Colony of St. John's Island was renamed to<space/><link><target>Prince Edward Island</target></link><space/>on November 29, 1798.</paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>War of 1812</target></link><space/>had some effect on the shipping industry in the Maritime colonies of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Cape Breton Island; however, the significant<space/><link><target>Royal Navy</target></link><space/>presence in Halifax and other ports in the region prevented any serious attempts by American raiders. Maritime and American<space/><link><target>privateer</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>targeted unprotected shipping of both the United States and Britain respectively, further reducing trade. The American border with New Brunswick did not have any significant action during this conflict, although British forces did occupy a portion of coastal<space/><link><target>Maine</target></link><space/>at one point. The most significant incident from this war which occurred in the Maritimes was the British capture and detention of the American<space/><link><target>frigate</target></link><space/><link><target>USS Chesapeake (1799)</target><part>USS ''Chesapeake''</part></link><space/>in Halifax.</paragraph><heading level='3'>19th century</heading><paragraph>In 1820, the Colony of<space/><link><target>Cape Breton Island</target></link><space/>was merged back into the Colony of Nova Scotia for the second time by the British government.</paragraph><paragraph>British settlement of the Maritimes, as the colonies of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island came to be known, accelerated throughout the late 18th century and into the 19th century with significant immigration to the region as a result of<space/><link><target>Scotland</target><part>Scottish</part></link><space/>migrants displaced by the<space/><link><target>Highland Clearances</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Irish diaspora</target><part>Irish</part></link><space/>escaping the<space/><link><target>Great Irish Famine</target><part>Great Irish Famine (1845-1849)</part></link>.

However, the majority of the conflict's impact was felt in the shipping industry. Maritime shipping boomed during the war due to large-scale Northern imports of war supplies which were often carried by Maritime ships as Union ships were vulnerable to Confederate naval raiders. Diplomatic tensions between<space/><link><target>United Kingdom</target><part>Britain</part></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>U.S. Northern states</target><part>Unionist North</part></link><space/>had deteriorated after some interests in Britain expressed support for the secessionist<space/><link><target>Confederate States of America</target><part>Confederate South</part></link>. The Union navy, although much smaller than the British<space/><link><target>Royal Navy</target></link><space/>and no threat to the Maritimes, did posture off Maritime coasts at times chasing Confederate naval ships which sought repairs and reprovisioning in Maritime ports, especially Halifax.</paragraph><paragraph>The immense size of the Union army (the largest on the planet toward the end of the Civil War), however, was viewed with increasing concern by Maritimers throughout the early 1860s. Another concern was the rising threat of<space/><link><target>Fenian</target></link><space/>raids on border communities in<space/><link><target>New Brunswick</target></link><space/>by those seeking to end British rule of<space/><link><target>Ireland</target></link>. This combination of events, coupled with an ongoing decline in British military and economic support to the region as the Home Office favoured newer colonial endeavours in Africa and elsewhere, led to a call among Maritime politicians for a conference on<space/><link><target>Maritime Union</target></link>, to be held in early September 1864 in Charlottetown chosen in part because of Prince Edward Island's reluctance to give up its jurisdictional sovereignty in favour of uniting with New Brunswick and Nova Scotia into a single colony. New Brunswick and Nova Scotia felt that if the union conference were held in Charlottetown, they might be able to convince Island politicians to support the proposal.</paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>Charlottetown Conference</target></link>, as it came to be called, was also attended by a slew of visiting delegates from the neighbouring colony of<space/><link><target>United Province of Canada</target><part>Canada</part></link>, who had largely arrived at their own invitation with their own agenda.

The regional economy has long been tied to natural resources such as fishing, logging, farming, and mining activities. Significant industrialization in the second half of the 19th century brought steel to<space/><link><target>Trenton, Nova Scotia</target></link>, and subsequent creation of a widespread industrial base to take advantage of the region's large underground coal deposits. After Confederation, however, this industrial base withered with technological change, and trading links to Europe and the U.S. were reduced in favour of those with Ontario and Quebec. In recent years, however, the Maritime regional economy has begun increased contributions from manufacturing again and the steady transition to a service economy.</paragraph><paragraph>Important manufacturing centres in the region include<space/><link><target>Pictou County, Nova Scotia</target><part>Pictou County</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Truro, Nova Scotia</target><part>Truro</part></link>, the<space/><link><target>Annapolis Valley</target></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>South Shore (Nova Scotia)</target><part>South Shore</part></link>, and the<space/><link><target>Strait of Canso</target></link><space/>area in Nova Scotia, as well as<space/><link><target>Summerside, Prince Edward Island</target><part>Summerside</part></link><space/>in Prince Edward Island, and the<space/><link><target>Miramichi, New Brunswick</target><part>Miramichi</part></link><space/>area, the<space/><link><target>North Shore (New Brunswick)</target><part>North Shore</part></link><space/>and the upper<space/><link><target>Saint John River (New Brunswick)</target><part>Saint John River</part></link><space/>valley of New Brunswick.</paragraph><paragraph>Some predominantly coastal areas have become major tourist centres, such as parts of Prince Edward Island, Cape Breton Island, the South Shore of Nova Scotia and the<space/><link><target>Gulf of St. Lawrence</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Bay of Fundy</target></link><space/>coasts of New Brunswick.

While urban areas are growing and thriving, economic adjustments have been harsh in rural and resource-dependent communities, and emigration has been an ongoing phenomenon for some parts of the region. Another problem is seen in the lower average wages and family incomes within the region. Property values are depressed, resulting in a smaller tax base for these three provinces, particularly when compared with the national average which benefits from central and western Canadian economic growth.</paragraph><paragraph>This has been particularly problematic with the growth of the<space/><link><target>welfare state</target></link><space/>in Canada since the 1950s, resulting in the need to draw upon<space/><link><target>equalization payments</target></link><space/>to provide nationally mandated social services.

That being said, New Brunswick has one of the largest military bases in the British Commonwealth (CFB Gagetown), which plays a significant role in the cultural and economic spheres of Fredericton, the province's capital city.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Historical</heading><heading level='4'>Growth</heading><paragraph><link><target>Image:CharlottetownConference1864.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>Delegates of the<space/><link><target>Charlottetown Conference</target></link><space/>on the steps of<space/><link><target>Government House (Prince Edward Island)</target><part>Government House</part></link></part></link>While the economic underperformance of the Maritime economy has been long lasting, it has not always been present. The mid-19th century, especially the 1850s and 1860s, has long been seen as a &quot;Golden Age&quot; in the Maritimes. Growth was strong, and the region had one of<space/><link><target>British North America</target></link>'s most extensive manufacturing sectors as well as a large international shipping industry. The question of why the Maritimes fell from being a centre of Canadian manufacturing to being an economic hinterland is thus a central one to the study of the region's pecuniary difficulties. The period in which the decline occurred had a great many potential culprits. In 1867 Nova Scotia and New Brunswick merged with the Canadas in<space/><link><target>Canadian Confederation</target><part>Confederation</part></link>, with Prince Edward Island joining them six years later in 1873. Canada was formed only a year after<space/><link><target>free trade</target></link><space/>with the United States (in the form of the<space/><link><target>Canadian-American Reciprocity Agreement</target><part>Reciprocity Agreement</part></link>) had ended. In the 1870s<space/><link><target>John A. Macdonald</target></link>'s<space/><link><target>National Policy</target></link><space/>was implemented, creating a system of protective<space/><link><target>tariffs</target></link><space/>around the new nation. Throughout the period there was also significant technological change both in the production and transportation of goods.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Was there a Golden Age?</heading><paragraph>Several scholars have explored the so-called &quot;golden age&quot; of the Maritimes in the years just before Confederation. In<space/><link><target>History of Nova Scotia</target><part>Nova Scotia</part></link>, the population grew steadily from 277,000 in 1851 to 388,000 in 1871, mostly from natural increase since immigration was slight.

In 1851-1871 there was an overall increase in per capita wealth holding. However most of the gains went to the urban elite class, especially businessmen and financiers living in Halifax.

Historian Kris Inwood places the date very early, at least in Nova Scotia, finding clear signs that the Maritimes &quot;Golden Age&quot; of the mid-nineteenth century was over by 1870, before Confederation or the National Policy could have had any significant impact. Richard Caves places the date closer to 1885. T.W. Acheson takes a similar view and provides considerable evidence that the early 1880s were in fact a booming period in Nova Scotia and this growth was only undermined towards the end of that decade. David Alexander argues that any earlier declines were simply part of the global<space/><link><target>Long Depression</target></link>, and that the Maritimes first fell behind the rest of Canada when the great boom period of the early twentieth century had little effect on the region. E.R. Forbes, however, emphasizes that the precipitous decline did not occur until after the<space/><link><target>World War I</target><part>First World War</part></link><space/>during the 1920s when new railway policies were implemented. Forbes also contends that significant Canadian defence spending during the<space/><link><target>World War II</target><part>Second World War</part></link><space/>favoured powerful political interests in Central Canada such as<space/><link><target>C.D. Howe</target></link>, when major Maritime shipyards and factories, as well as Canada's largest steel mill, located in Cape Breton Island, fared poorly.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Image:Yarmouth N.S 1910.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>250px</part><part>right</part><part><link><target>Yarmouth, Nova Scotia</target><part>Yarmouth</part></link><space/>in 1910</part></link>One of the most important changes, and one that almost certainly had an effect, was the revolution in transportation that occurred at this time. The Maritimes were connected to central Canada by the<space/><link><target>Intercolonial Railway</target></link><space/>in the 1870s, removing a longstanding barrier to trade. For the first time this placed the Maritime manufacturers in direct competition with those of Central Canada. Maritime trading patterns shifted considerably from mainly trading with<space/><link><target>New England</target></link>,<space/><link><target>United Kingdom</target><part>Britain</part></link>, and the<space/><link><target>Caribbean</target></link>, to being focused on commerce with the Canadian interior, enforced by the federal government's tariff policies.</paragraph><paragraph>Simultaneous with the construction of railways in the region, the age of the wooden sailing ship began to come to an end, being replaced by larger and faster steel<space/><link><target>steam ship</target><trail>s</trail></link>. The Maritimes had long been a centre for<space/><link><target>shipbuilding</target></link>, and this industry was hurt by the change. The larger ships were also less likely to call on the smaller population centres such as Saint John and Halifax, preferring to travel to cities like<space/><link><target>New York City</target><part>New York</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Montreal</target></link>. Even the<space/><link><target>Cunard Line</target></link>, founded by Haligonian<space/><link><target>Samuel Cunard</target></link>, stopped making more than a single ceremonial voyage to Halifax each year.</paragraph><paragraph>More controversial than the role of technology is the argument over the role of politics in the origins of the region's decline. Confederation and the tariff and railway freight policies that followed have often been blamed for having a deleterious effect on the Maritime economies. Arguments have been made that the Maritimes' poverty was caused by control over policy by Central Canada which used the national structures for its own enrichment. This was the central view of the<space/><link><target>Maritime Rights Movement</target></link><space/>of the 1920s, which advocated greater local control over the region's finances. T.W. Acheson is one of the main proponents of this theory. He notes the growth that was occurring during the early years of the National Policy in Nova Scotia demonstrates how the effects of railway fares and the tariff structure helped undermine this growth. Capitalists from Central Canada purchased the factories and industries of the Maritimes from their bankrupt local owners and proceeded to close down many of them, consolidating the industry in Central Canada.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Image:Corner of princess and the Water Street in Saint John NB New-Brunwick.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>250px</part><part>left</part><part>Princess and Water Street in Saint John</part></link>The policies in the early years of Confederation were designed by Central Canadian interests, and they reflected the needs of that region. The unified Canadian market and the introduction of railroads created a relative weakness in the Maritime economies. Central to this concept, according to Acheson, was the lack of metropolises in the Maritimes.</paragraph><paragraph>Montreal and<space/><link><target>Toronto</target></link><space/>were well suited to benefit from the development of large-scale manufacturing and extensive railway systems in<space/><link><target>Quebec</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Ontario</target></link>, these being the goals of the Macdonald and Laurier governments. In the Maritimes the situation was very different. Today New Brunswick has several mid-sized centres in Saint John, Moncton, and Fredericton but no significant population centre. Nova Scotia has a growing metropolitan area surrounding<space/><link><target>Halifax Regional Municipality</target><part>Halifax</part></link>, but a contracting population in industrial<space/><link><target>Cape Breton County, Nova Scotia</target><part>Cape Breton</part></link>, and several smaller centres in<space/><link><target>Bridgewater, Nova Scotia</target><part>Bridgewater</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Kentville, Nova Scotia</target><part>Kentville</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Yarmouth, Nova Scotia</target><part>Yarmouth</part></link>, and<space/><link><target>Pictou County, Nova Scotia</target><part>Pictou County</part></link>. Prince Edward Island's only significant population centres are in Charlottetown and<space/><link><target>Summerside, Prince Edward Island</target><part>Summerside</part></link>. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, just the opposite was the case with little to no population concentration in major industrial centres as the predominantly rural resource-dependent Maritime economy continued on the same path as it had since European settlement on the region's shores.</paragraph><paragraph>Despite the region's absence of economic growth on the same scale as other parts of the nation, the Maritimes has changed markedly throughout the 20th century, partly as a result of global and national economic trends, and partly as a result of government intervention. Each sub-region within the Maritimes has developed over time to exploit different resources and expertise. Saint John became a centre of the timber trade and shipbuilding and is currently a centre for oil refining and some manufacturing. The northern New Brunswick communities of<space/><link><target>Edmundston</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Campbellton, New Brunswick</target><part>Campbellton</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Dalhousie, New Brunswick</target><part>Dalhousie</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Bathurst, New Brunswick</target><part>Bathurst</part></link>, and<space/><link><target>Miramichi, New Brunswick</target><part>Miramichi</part></link><space/>are focused on the pulp and paper industry and some mining activity. Moncton was a centre for railways and has changed its focus to becoming a multi-modal transportation centre with associated manufacturing and retail interests. The Halifax metropolitan area has come to dominate peninsular Nova Scotia as a retail and service centre, but that province's industries were spread out from the coal and steel industries of industrial<space/><link><target>Cape Breton County, Nova Scotia</target><part>Cape Breton</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Pictou County, Nova Scotia</target><part>Pictou</part></link><space/>counties, the mixed farming of the North Shore and Annapolis Valley, and the fishing industry was primarily focused on the South Shore and<space/><link><target>Eastern Shore (Nova Scotia)</target><part>Eastern Shore</part></link>. Prince Edward Island is largely dominated by farming, fishing, and tourism.</paragraph><paragraph>Given the geographic diversity of the various sub-regions within the Maritimes, policies to centralize the population and economy were not initially successful, thus Maritime factories closed while those in Ontario and Quebec prospered.</paragraph><paragraph>The traditional<space/><link><target>staples thesis</target></link>, advocated by scholars such as S.A. Saunders, looks at the resource endowments of the Maritimes and argues that it was the decline of the traditional industries of shipbuilding and fishing that led to Maritime poverty, since these processes were rooted in geography, and thus all but inevitable. Kris Inwood has revived the staples approach and looks at a number of geographic weaknesses relative to Central Canada. He repeats Acheson's argument that the region lacks major urban centres, but adds that the Maritimes were also lacking the great rivers that led to the cheap and abundant<space/><link><target>hydro-electric power</target></link>, key to Quebec and Ontario's urban and manufacturing development, that the extraction costs of Maritime resources were higher (particularly in the case of Cape Breton coal), and that the soils of the region were poorer and thus the agricultural sector weaker.</paragraph><paragraph>The Maritimes are the only provinces in Canada which entered Confederation in the 19th century and have kept their original colonial boundaries. All three provinces have the smallest land base in the country and have been forced to make do with resources within. By comparison, the former colony of the<space/><link><target>United Province of Canada</target></link><space/>(divided into the District of<space/><link><target>Canada East</target></link>, and the District of<space/><link><target>Canada West</target></link>) and the western provinces were dozens of times larger and in some cases were expanded to take in territory formerly held in British Crown grants to companies such as the<space/><link><target>Hudson's Bay Company</target></link>; in particular the November 19, 1869 sale of<space/><link><target>Rupert's Land</target></link><space/>to the Government of Canada under the<space/><italics><link><target>Rupert's Land Act 1868</target></link></italics><space/>was facilitated in part by Maritime taxpayers. The economic riches of energy and natural resources held within this larger land base were only realized by other provinces during the 20th century.</paragraph><paragraph>One comparison made with the wealthier areas of Canada is that of the region's political and/or work culture. Today few academics make such a claim, but it still a common explanation in other circles.

Despite having an extensive coastline, New Brunswick's industrial sector has never been entirely reliant on the success of the fisheries. Likewise, the strong shipbuilding heritage of the province directly relates to its forest resources. Because of this, New Brunswickers tend to attribute their cultural heritage less with the sea and more with their forests and rivers.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Politics</heading><paragraph><template><target>Refimprove section</target><arg name="date">February 2008</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Maritime conservatism since the Second World War has been very much part of the<space/><link><target>Red Tory</target></link><space/>tradition, key influences being former<space/><link><target>Premier of Nova Scotia</target></link><space/>and federal<space/><link><target>Progressive Conservative Party of Canada</target><part>Progressive Conservative Party</part></link><space/>leader<space/><link><target>Robert Stanfield</target></link><space/>and New Brunswick Tory strategist<space/><link><target>Dalton Camp</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>In recent years, the<space/><link><target>social democracy</target><part>social democratic</part></link><space/><link><target>New Democratic Party (Canada)</target><part>New Democratic Party</part></link><space/>(NDP) has made significant inroads both federally and provincially in the region.

In 2015 the Liberals won every seat in The Maritimes, defeating Conservative and NDP incumbents.<space/></paragraph><paragraph>The Maritimes is currently represented in the Canadian Parliament by 25 Members of the House of Commons (Nova Scotia 11, New Brunswick 10, Prince Edward Island 4) and 24 Senators (Nova Scotia and New Brunswick 10 each, Prince Edward Island 4). This level of representation was established at the time of Confederation when the Maritimes had a much larger proportion of the national population. The comparatively large population growth of western and central Canada during the immigration boom of the 20th century has reduced the Maritimes' proportion of the national population to less than 10%, resulting in an over-representation in Parliament, with some federal ridings having fewer than 35,000 people, compared to central and western Canada where ridings typically contain 100,000-120,000 people.</paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>Senate of Canada</target></link><space/>is structured along regional lines, giving an equal number of seats (24) to the Maritimes, Ontario, Quebec, and western Canada, in addition to the later entry of Newfoundland and Labrador, as well as the three territories. Enshrined in the<space/><link><target>Canadian Constitution</target><part>Constitution</part></link>, this model was developed to ensure that no area of the country is able to exert undue influence in the Senate. The Maritimes, with its much smaller proportion of the national population (compared to the time of Confederation) also have an over-representation in the Senate, particularly compared to the population growth of Ontario and the western provinces. This has led to<space/><link><target>Triple-E Senate</target><part>calls to reform the Senate</part></link>; however, such a move would entail constitutional changes.</paragraph><paragraph>Another factor related to the number of Senate seats is that a constitutional amendment in the early 20th century mandated that no province can have fewer Members of Parliament than it has senators. This court decision resulted from a complaint by the Government of Prince Edward Island after that province's number of MPs was proposed to change from 4 to 3, accounting for its declining proportion of the national population at that time. When PEI entered Confederation in 1873, it was accorded 6 MPs and 4 Senators; however this was reduced to 4 MPs by the early twentieth century. Senators being appointed for life at this time, these coveted seats rarely went unfilled for a long period of time anywhere in Canada. As a result, PEI's challenge was accepted by the federal government, and its level of federal representation was secured. In the aftermath of the 1989 budget, which saw a fillibuster by Liberal Senators in attempt to kill legislation creating the<space/><link><target>Goods and Services Tax (Canada)</target><part>Goods and Services Tax</part></link>, Prime Minister<space/><link><target>Brian Mulroney</target></link><space/>&quot;stacked&quot; the Senate by creating additional seats in several provinces across Canada, including New Brunswick; however, there was no attempt by these provinces to increase the number of MPs to reflect this change in Senate representation.</paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><paragraph><template><target>Portal</target><arg>Geography of Canada</arg></template><template><target>Commons category</target><arg>Maritimes</arg></template></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Atlantic Canada</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Acadiensis</target></link>, scholarly history journal covering Atlantic Canada</listitem><listitem><link><target>Central Canada</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>List of regions of Canada</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Maritime Film Classification Board</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Maritime Union</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>New England</target></link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>Reflist</target></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>External links</heading><paragraph><template><target>Commons category</target><arg>Maritimes</arg></template></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><link type='external' href='http://www.apec-econ.ca'>Atlantic Provinces Economic Council</link></listitem><listitem><link type='external' href='http://www.aims.ca'>Atlantic Institute of Market Studies</link></listitem><listitem><link type='external' href='http://www.gpiatlantic.org'>Genuine Progress Indicator Atlantic</link></listitem><listitem><link type='external' href='http://www.moncton.net/info/townOfCityOf.aspx'>Atlantic Provinces Communities: Towns &amp; Cities.
