==Signs and symptoms==
[[Chest pain]] that occurs regularly with activity, after eating, or at other predictable times is termed stable [[angina]] and is associated with [[stenosis|narrowings]] of the [[artery|arteries]] of the [[heart]].

Angina that changes in intensity, character or frequency is termed unstable. [[Unstable angina]] may precede [[myocardial infarction]]. In adults who go to the emergency department with an unclear cause of pain, about 30% have pain due to coronary artery disease.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kontos|first1=MC|last2=Diercks|first2=DB|last3=Kirk|first3=JD|title=Emergency department and office-based evaluation of patients with chest pain|journal=Mayo Clinic proceedings|date=Mar 2010|volume=85|issue=3|pages=284–99|pmid=20194155|doi=10.4065/mcp.2009.0560|accessdate=October 26, 2015}}</ref>

[[File:Blausen 0259 CoronaryArteryDisease 02.png|thumb|Illustration depicting coronary artery disease]]
Limitation of blood flow to the heart causes [[ischemia]] (cell starvation secondary to a lack of oxygen) of the myocardial cells.  Myocardial cells may die from lack of [[oxygen]] and this is called a [[myocardial infarction]] (commonly called a heart attack). It leads to [[cardiac muscle|heart muscle]] damage, [[cardiac muscle|heart muscle]] death and later [[myocardial scarring]] without [[cardiac muscle|heart muscle]] regrowth. Chronic high-grade stenosis of the coronary arteries can induce transient [[ischemia]] which leads to the induction of a [[ventricular arrhythmia]], which may terminate into [[ventricular fibrillation]] leading to death.<ref name="AmbroseSingh2015">{{cite journal|last1=Ambrose|first1=John|last2=Singh|first2=Manmeet|title=Pathophysiology of coronary artery disease leading to acute coronary syndromes|journal=F1000Prime Reports|volume=7|year=2015|issn=20517599|doi=10.12703/P7-08}}</ref>

Typically, coronary artery disease occurs when part of the smooth, elastic lining inside a [[coronary artery]] (the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle) develops [[atherosclerosis]]. With atherosclerosis, the artery's lining becomes hardened, stiffened, and swollen with calcium deposits, fatty deposits, and abnormal inflammatory [[Cell (biology)|cells]] - to form a [[Atheromatous plaque|plaque]]. Deposits of calcium phosphates (hydroxyapatites) in the muscular layer of the blood vessels appear to play not only a significant role in stiffening arteries but also for the induction of an early phase of coronary [[arteriosclerosis]].  This can be seen in a so-called metastatic mechanism of [[calciphylaxis]] as it occurs in chronic kidney disease and haemodialysis  (Rainer Liedtke 2008). Although these patients suffer from a kidney dysfunction, almost fifty percent of them die due to coronary artery disease. Plaques can be thought of as large "pimples" that protrude into the channel of an artery, causing a partial obstruction to blood flow. Patients with coronary artery disease might have just one or two [[Atheromatous plaque|plaque]]s, or might have dozens distributed throughout their [[coronary arteries]]. {{anchor|CTO}}A more severe form is ''chronic total occlusion'' (CTO), when a coronary artery is completely obstructed for more than 3 months.<ref name="Aziz2005">{{cite journal|last1=Aziz|first1=S|title=Chronic total occlusions--a stiff challenge requiring a major breakthrough: is there light at the end of the tunnel?|journal=Heart|volume=91|issue=suppl_3|year=2005|pages=iii42–iii48|issn=1355-6037|doi=10.1136/hrt.2004.058495|accessdate=October 26, 2015}}</ref>

CAD has always been a tough disease to diagnose without the use of invasive or stressful activities.  The development of the [[Multifunction cardiogram|Multifunction Cardiogram (MCG)]] has changed the way CAD is diagnosed. The MCG consists of a 2 lead resting EKG signal which is transformed into a mathematical model and compared against tens of thousands of clinical trials to diagnose a patient with an objective severity score, as well as secondary and tertiary results about the patient's condition. The results from MCG tests have been validated in 8 clinical trials {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} which resulted in a database of over 50,000 patients where the system has demonstrated accuracy comparable to [[coronary angiography]] (90% overall sensitivity, 85% specificity).{{cn|date=October 2015}}

This level of accuracy comes from the application of advanced techniques in signal processing and systems analysis combined with a large scale clinical database which allows MCG to provide quantitative, evidence-based results to assist physicians in reaching a diagnosis.  The MCG has also been awarded a Category III CPT code by the [[American Medical Association]] in the July 2009 CPT update {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}.

The diagnosis of "Cardiac Syndrome X" - the rare coronary artery disease that is more common in women, as mentioned, an "exclusion" diagnosis. Therefore, usually the same tests are used as in any patient with the suspicion of coronary artery disease:
* [[Baseline (medicine)|Baseline]] [[electrocardiography]] (ECG)
* Exercise ECG – [[Cardiac stress test|Stress test]]
* Exercise radioisotope test (nuclear stress test, myocardial [[scintigraphy]])
* [[Echocardiography]] (including stress echocardiography)
* [[Coronary angiography]]
* [[Intravascular ultrasound]]
* [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI)

The diagnosis of coronary disease underlying particular symptoms depends largely on the nature of the symptoms. The first investigation is an [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG/EKG), both for "stable" angina and acute coronary syndrome. An [[Chest X-ray|X-ray of the chest]] and [[blood test]]s may be performed.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

===Stable angina===
{{main|Angina pectoris}}
{{unsourced|section|date=October 2015}}
In "stable" angina, chest pain with typical features occurring at predictable levels of exertion, various forms of [[cardiac stress test]]s may be used to induce both symptoms and detect changes by way of electrocardiography (using an ECG), [[echocardiography]] (using [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] of the heart) or [[scintigraphy]] (using uptake of [[radionuclide]] by the heart muscle). If part of the heart seems to receive an insufficient blood supply, [[Coronary catheterization|coronary angiography]] may be used to identify [[stenosis]] of the coronary arteries and suitability for [[angioplasty]] or [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|bypass surgery]].{{cn|date=October 2015}}

===Acute coronary syndrome===
{{main|Acute coronary syndrome}}
{{unsourced|section|date=October 2015}}
Diagnosis of [[acute coronary syndrome]] generally takes place in the [[emergency department]], where ECGs may be performed sequentially to identify "evolving changes" (indicating ongoing damage to the heart muscle). Diagnosis is clear-cut if ECGs show elevation of the "[[Electrocardiogram#ST segment|ST segment]]", which in the context of severe typical chest pain is strongly indicative of an acute [[myocardial infarction]] (MI); this is termed a STEMI (ST-elevation MI), and is treated as an emergency with either urgent [[Coronary catheterization|coronary angiography]] and [[percutaneous coronary intervention]] (angioplasty with or without [[stent]] insertion) or with [[thrombolysis]] ("clot buster" medication), whichever is available. In the absence of ST-segment elevation, heart damage is detected by [[cardiac marker]]s (blood tests that identify heart muscle damage). If there is evidence of damage ([[infarction]]), the chest pain is attributed to a "non-ST elevation MI" (NSTEMI). If there is no evidence of damage, the term "unstable angina" is used. This process usually necessitates admission to hospital, and close observation on a [[coronary care unit]] for possible complications (such as [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s – irregularities in the heart rate). Depending on the risk assessment, stress testing or angiography may be used to identify and treat coronary artery disease in patients who have had an NSTEMI or unstable angina.

===Risk assessment===
{{unsourced|section|date=October 2015}}
There are various risk assessment systems for determining the risk of coronary artery disease, with various emphasis on different variables above. A notable example is [[Framingham Score]], used in the [[Framingham Heart Study]]. It is mainly based on age, gender, diabetes, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, tobacco smoking and systolic blood pressure.

==Prevention==
Prevention involves: [[exercise]], decreasing [[obesity]], treating [[hypertension]], a [[healthy diet]], decreasing [[cholesterol]] levels, and [[smoking cessation|stopping smoking]]. Medications and exercise are roughly equally effective.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Naci|first=H.|author2=Ioannidis, J. P. A.|title=Comparative effectiveness of exercise and drug interventions on mortality outcomes: metaepidemiological study|journal=BMJ|date=October 1, 2013|volume=347|issue=oct01 1|pages=f5577–f5577|doi=10.1136/bmj.f5577|accessdate=October 26, 2015}}</ref>

In [[diabetes mellitus]], there is little evidence that very tight [[blood sugar]] control improves cardiac risk although improved sugar control appears to decrease other problems like kidney failure and blindness. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) recommends "low to moderate alcohol intake" to reduce risk of coronary artery disease although this remains without scientific cause and effect proof.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/5_population_nutrient/en/index12.html|title=5.

Secondary prevention is preventing further sequelae of already established disease. Lifestyle changes that have been shown to be effective to this goal include:
*[[Weight control]]
*[[Smoking cessation]]
* Avoiding the consumption of [[trans fats]] (in partially hydrogenated oils)
*[[Exercise]].

====Aspirin====
In those with no other heart problems aspirin decreases the risk of a myocardial infarction in men but not women and increases the risk of bleeding, most of which is from the stomach.

It is estimated that 60% of the world's cardiovascular disease burden will occur in the South Asian subcontinent despite only accounting for 20% of the world's population.
