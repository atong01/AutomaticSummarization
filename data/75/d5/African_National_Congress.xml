However, it then became dormant in the mid-1920s. During that time, black people were also represented by the<space/><link><target>Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union</target><part>ICU</part></link><space/>and the previously white-only Communist party.

These initial meetings were the first crucial steps towards resolution.</paragraph><paragraph>The next official step towards rebuilding South Africa was the Groote Schuur Minute where the government and the ANC agreed on a common commitment towards the resolution of the existing climate of violence and intimidation, as well as a commitment to stability and to a peaceful process of negotiations. The ANC negotiated the release of political prisoners and the indemnity from prosecution for returning exiles and moreover channels of communication were established between the Government and the ANC.</paragraph><paragraph>Later the Pretoria Minute represented another step towards resolution where agreements at Groote Schuur were reconsolidated and steps towards setting up an interim government and drafting a new constitution were established as well as suspension of the military wing of the ANC the Umkhonto we Sizwe. This step helped end much of the violence within South Africa. Another agreement that came out of the Pretoria Minute was that both parties would try and raise awareness that a new way of governance was being created for South Africa, and that further violence would only hinder this process. However, violence still continued in Kwazulu-Natal, which violated the trust between Mandela and de Klerk. Moreover, internal disputes in the ANC prolonged the war as consensus on peace was not reached.<extension extension_name='ref' name="concise"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="title">A concise history of South Africa</arg><arg name="first">Robert</arg><arg name="last">Ross</arg><arg name="publisher">Cambridge University Press</arg><arg name="year">1999</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The next significant steps towards resolution were the Repeal of the Population Registration Act, the repeal of the Group Areas and the Native Land Acts and a catch-all<space/><link><target>Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act, 1991</target><part>Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act</part></link><space/>was passed.<extension extension_name='ref' name="concise"></extension><space/>These measures ensured no one could claim, or be deprived of, any land rights on the basis of race.</paragraph><paragraph>In December 1991 the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (<link><target>Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa</target><part>CODESA</part></link>) was held with the aim of establishing an interim government.

In over 40 meetings the two men discussed and negotiated over many issues including the nature of the future political system, the fate of over 40,000 government employees and if/how the country would be divided. The result of these negotiations was an interim constitution that meant the transition from apartheid to democracy was a constitutional continuation and that the rule of law and state sovereignty remained intact during the transition, which was vital for stability within the country.
