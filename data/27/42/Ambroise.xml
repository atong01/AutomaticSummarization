The poem is known to us only through one<space/><link><target>Vatican Library</target><part>Vatican</part></link><space/><link><target>manuscript</target></link>, and long escaped the notice of historians.</paragraph><paragraph>The credit for detecting its value belongs to<space/><link><target>Gaston Paris</target></link>, although his edition (1897) was partially anticipated by the editors of the<space/><italics><link><target>Monumenta Germaniae Historica</target></link></italics>, who published some selections in the twenty-seventh volume of their Scriptores (1885). Ambroise followed Richard I as a<space/><link><target>noncombatant</target></link>, and not improbably as a court-<link><target>minstrel</target></link>. He speaks as an eye-witness of the king's doings at<space/><link><target>Messina, Italy</target><part>Messina</part></link>, in<space/><link><target>Cyprus</target></link>, at the<space/><link><target>siege of Acre (11891191)</target><part>siege of Acre</part></link>, and in the abortive campaign which followed the capture of that city.</paragraph><paragraph>Ambroise is surprisingly accurate in his<space/><link><target>chronology</target></link>; though he did not complete his work before 1195, it is evidently founded upon notes which he had taken in the course of his<space/><link><target>pilgrimage</target></link>. He shows no greater political insight than we should expect from his position; but relates what he had seen and heard with a nave vivacity which compels attention. He is by no means an impartial source: he is prejudiced against the<space/><link><target>Saracens</target></link>, against the French, and against all the rivals or enemies of his master, including the<space/><italics>Polein</italics><space/>party which supported<space/><link><target>Conrad of Montferrat</target></link><space/>against<space/><link><target>Guy of Lusignan</target></link>. He is rather to be treated as a<space/><link><target>biographer</target></link><space/>than as a historian of the Crusade in its broader aspects. Nonetheless he is an interesting primary source for the events of the years 11901192 in the<space/><link><target>Kingdom of Jerusalem</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Books 26 of the<space/><italics><link><target>Itinerarium Regis Ricardi</target></link></italics>, a Latin prose narrative of the same events apparently compiled by Richard, a canon of Holy Trinity, London, are closely related to Ambroise's poem. They were formerly sometimes regarded as the first-hand narrative on which Ambroise based his work, but that can no longer be maintained.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Published edition</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem>Ambroise,<space/><italics>LEstoire de la guerre sainte</italics>.
