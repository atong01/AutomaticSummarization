These people now controlled the Mediterranean ports, while the<space/><link><target>Kassites</target></link><space/>controlled the river route south to the<space/><link><target>Persian Gulf</target></link>.

At the end of the Bronze Age, Nineveh was much smaller than Babylon, but still one of the world's major cities (population c. 33,000). By the end of the Neo-Assyrian period, it had grown to a population of some 120,000, and was possibly the largest city in the world at that time.<extension extension_name='ref'>see<space/><link><target>historical urban community sizes</target></link>.

He had certain obligations to fulfill in the cult, and had to provide resources for the temples. The priesthood became a major power in Assyrian society.

Eriba-Adad I became involved in a dynastic battle between<space/><link><target>Tushratta</target></link><space/>and his brother<space/><link><target>Artatama II</target></link><space/>and after this his son<space/><link><target>Shuttarna II</target></link>, who called himself king of the Hurri while seeking support from the Assyrians. A pro-Assyria faction appeared at the royal Mitanni court. Eriba-Adad I had thus finally broken Mitanni influence over Assyria, and in turn had now made Assyria an influence over Mitanni affairs.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Ashur-uballit I</target></link><space/>(13651330 BC) succeeded the throne of Assyria in 1365 BC, and proved to be a fierce, ambitious and powerful ruler. Assyrian pressure from the southeast and Hittite pressure from the north-west, enabled Ashur-uballit I to break Mitanni power. He met and decisively defeated Shuttarna II, the Mitanni king in battle, making Assyria once more an imperial power at the expense of not only the Mitanni themselves, but also Kassite Babylonia, the Hurrians and the Hittites; and a time came when the Kassite king in Babylon was glad to marry<space/><link><target>Muballiat-ra</target></link>, the daughter of Ashur-uballit, whose letters to<space/><link><target>Akhenaten</target></link><space/>of Egypt form part of the<space/><link><target>Amarna letters</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>This marriage led to disastrous results for Babylonia, as the Kassite faction at court murdered the half Assyrian Babylonian king and placed a pretender on the throne. Assur-uballit I promptly invaded Babylonia to avenge his son-in-law, entering Babylon, deposing the king and installing<space/><link><target>Kurigalzu II</target></link><space/>of the royal line king there.</paragraph><paragraph>Ashur-uballit I then attacked and defeated<space/><link><target>Shattiwaza</target><part>Mattiwaza</part></link>, the Mitanni king, despite attempts by the Hittite king<space/><link><target>Suppiluliumas</target></link>, now fearful of growing Assyrian power, to help the Mitanni. The lands of the Mitanni and Hurrians were duly appropriated by Assyria, making it a large and powerful empire.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Enlil-nirari</target></link><space/>(13291308 BC) succeeded Ashur-uballit I. He described himself as a &quot;Great-King&quot; (<italics>Sharru rab</italics>) in letters to the Hittite kings. He was immediately attacked by Kurigalzu II of Babylon who had been installed by his father, but succeeded in defeating him, repelling Babylonian attempts to invade Assyria, counterattacking and appropriating Babylonian territory in the process, thus further expanding Assyria.</paragraph><paragraph>The successor of Enlil-nirari,<space/><link><target>Arik-den-ili</target></link><space/>(c. 13071296 BC), consolidated Assyrian power, and successfully campaigned in the<space/><link><target>Zagros</target></link><space/>Mountains to the east, subjugating the Lullubi and Gutians. In Syria, he defeated Semitic tribes of the so-called<space/><link><target>Ahlamu</target></link><space/>group, who were possibly predecessors of the Arameans or an Aramean tribe.</paragraph><paragraph>He was followed by<space/><link><target>Adad-nirari I</target></link><space/>(12951275 BC) who made<space/><link><target>Kalhu</target></link><space/>(Biblical<space/><link><target>Calah</target></link>/<link><target>Nimrud</target></link>) his capital, and continued expansion to the northwest, mainly at the expense of the Hittites and Hurrians, conquering Hittite territories such as<space/><link><target>Carchemish</target></link><space/>and beyond. He then moved into north eastern Asia Minor, conquering<space/><link><target>Shupria</target></link>. Adad-nirari I made further gains to the south, annexing Babylonian territory and forcing the Kassite rulers of Babylon into accepting a new frontier agreement in Assyria's favour.</paragraph><paragraph>Adad-nirari's inscriptions are more detailed than any of his predecessors. He declares that the gods of Mesopotamia called him to war, a statement used by most subsequent Assyrian kings. He referred to himself again as<space/><italics>Sharru Rabi</italics><space/>(meaning &quot;The Great King&quot; in the Akkadian language) and conducted extensive building projects in Ashur and the provinces.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1274 BC<space/><link><target>Shalmaneser I</target></link><space/>(12741244 BC) ascended the throne. He proved to be a great warrior king. During his reign he conquered the Hurrian kingdom of<space/><link><target>Urartu</target></link><space/>that would have encompassed most of Eastern Anatolia and the Caucasus Mountains in the 9th century BC, and the fierce Gutians of the Zagros. He then attacked the Mitanni-Hurrians, defeating both King<space/><link><target>Shattuara</target></link><space/>and his Hittite and Aramaean allies, finally completely destroying the Hurri-Mitanni kingdom in the process.</paragraph><paragraph>During the campaign against the Hittites, Shattuara cut off the Assyrian army from their supply of food and water, but the Assyrians broke free in a desperate battle, counterattacked, and conquered and annexed what remained of the Mitanni kingdom.

Quote: &quot;First coined in 1881 by the French Egyptologist G. Maspero (1896), the somewhat misleading term &quot;Sea Peoples&quot; encompasses the ethnonyms Lukka, Sherden, Shekelesh, Teresh, Eqwesh, Denyen, Sikil / Tjekker, Weshesh, and Peleset (Philistines). [Footnote: The modern term &quot;Sea Peoples&quot; refers to peoples that appear in several New Kingdom Egyptian texts as originating from &quot;islands&quot; (tables 1-2; Adams and Cohen, this volume; see, e.g.,<space/><link><target>Robert Drews</target><part>Drews</part></link><space/>1993, 57 for a summary). The use of quotation marks in association with the term &quot;Sea Peoples&quot; in our title is intended to draw attention to the problematic nature of this commonly used term. It is noteworthy that the designation &quot;of the sea&quot; appears only in relation to the Sherden, Shekelesh, and Eqwesh. Subsequently, this term was applied somewhat indiscriminately to several additional ethnonyms, including the Philistines, who are portrayed in their earliest appearance as invaders from the north during the reigns of Merenptah and Ramesses Ill (see, e.g., Sandars 1978; Redford 1992, 243, n. 14; for a recent review of the primary and secondary literature, see Woudhuizen 2006). Hencefore the term Sea Peoples will appear without quotation marks.]&quot;</extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="Drews48"><link type='external' href='https://books.google.com/books?id=bFpK6aXEWN8C&amp;amp;pg=PA48&amp;amp;lpg=PA48'>The End of the Bronze Age: Changes in Warfare and the Catastrophe Ca. 1200 B.C., Robert Drews, p4861</link><space/>Quote: &quot;The thesis that a great &quot;migration of the Sea Peoples&quot; occurred ca. 1200 B.C. is supposedly based on Egyptian inscriptions, one from the reign of Merneptah and another from the reign of Ramesses III.
