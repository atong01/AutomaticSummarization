'''Assyria''', a major [[Mesopotamian]] [[East Semitic languages|East Semitic]] kingdom and empire of the [[Ancient Near East]], existed as an independent state for a period of approximately nineteen centuries, from the 25th century BC to 605 BC, spanning the mid to [[Early Bronze Age]] through to the late [[Iron Age]]. For a further thirteen centuries, from the end of the 7th century BC to the mid-7th century AD, it survived as a [[geo-political]] entity, for the most part ruled by foreign powers, although a number of small [[Neo-Assyrian]] states such as [[Assur]], [[Adiabene]], [[Osroene]] and [[Hatra]] arose at different times between the 1st century BC and late 3rd century CE.

Centered on the Upper [[Tigris river]], in [[northern Mesopotamia]] (modern northern [[Iraq]], northeastern [[Syria]] and southeastern [[Turkey]]), the Assyrians came to rule powerful empires at several times. Making up a substantial part of the greater [[Mesopotamian]] "[[cradle of civilization]]," which included [[Sumer]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]] and much later [[Babylonia]], Assyria was at the height of technological, scientific and cultural achievements for its time. At its peak, the Assyrian empire stretched from [[Cyprus]] in the Mediterranean Sea to [[Persia]] ([[Iran]]), and from what is now [[Armenia]] to the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and [[Egypt]].

Assyria is named for its original capital, the ancient city of [[A≈°≈°ur]] (a.k.a. [[Ashur]]), which dates to c. 2600 BC (located in what is now the [[Saladin Province]] of northern [[Iraq]]), originally one of a number of [[Akkadian]] city states in Mesopotamia. In the 25th and 24th centuries BC, Assyrian kings were pastoral leaders. From the late 24th century BC, this people became subject to [[Sargon of Akkad]], who united all the [[Akkadian]] [[Semites]] and [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]-speaking peoples of Mesopotamia under the [[Akkadian Empire]], which lasted from c. 2334 BC to 2154 BC. Following the fall of the Akkadian Empire c. 2154 BC,<ref>Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', pp. 161‚Äì191.</ref> and the short-lived succeeding [[Neo-Sumerian Empire]] that ruled southern Assyria but not the north, Assyria regained full independence.

The history of Assyria proper is roughly divided into three periods, known as Old Assyrian, Middle Assyrian and Neo-Assyrian. These terms are in wide use in [[Assyrology]] and roughly correspond to the early to [[Middle Bronze Age]], [[Late Bronze Age]] and [[Early Iron Age]], respectively. In the Old Assyrian period, Assyria established colonies in [[Asia Minor]] and [[the Levant]] and, under king [[Ilushuma]], it asserted itself over southern Mesopotamia. From the mid 18th century BC, Assyria came into conflict with the newly created state of [[Babylonia]], which eventually eclipsed the far older Sumero-Akkadian states in the south, such as [[Ur]], [[Isin]], [[Larsa]] and [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]].

Assyria experienced fluctuating fortunes in the Old Assyrian period. Assyria became a regionally powerful nation with the [[Old Assyrian Empire]] from the late 21st century to the mid 18th century BC. Following this, it found itself under short periods of Babylonian and [[Mitanni]]-[[Hurrian]] rule in the 18th and 15th centuries BC respectively, and another period of great power occurred with the rise of the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (from 1365 BC to 1056 BC), which included the reigns of great kings, such as [[Ashur-uballit I]], [[Arik-den-ili]], [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] and [[Tiglath-Pileser I]]. During this period, Assyria overthrew the [[Mitanni]]-Empire and eclipsed the [[Hittite Empire]], [[Egyptian Empire]], [[Babylonia]], [[Elam]] and [[Phrygia]] in the [[Near East]].

Beginning with the campaigns of [[Adad-nirari II]] from 911 BC,<ref name="Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq">Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq''{{page needed|date=October 2013}}</ref> it again became a great power over the next three centuries, overthrowing the [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt]] and conquering [[Egypt]],<ref name="Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq"/> Babylonia, [[Elam]], [[Urartu]], [[Armenians|Armenia]], [[Media (region)|Media]], [[Persia]], [[Mannaeans|Mannea]], [[Gutium]], [[Phoenicia]]/[[Canaan]], [[Aramea]] ([[Syria]]), [[Arabia]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], [[Edom]], [[Moab]], [[Ammon]], [[Samarra]], [[Cilicia]], [[Cyprus]], [[Chaldea]], [[Nabatea]], [[Commagene]], [[Dilmun]], [[Libya]], the [[Hurrians]], [[Sutu, Iran|Sutu]] and [[Neo-Hittites]], driving the [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopians]], [[Kushites]] and [[Nubians]] from Egypt,<ref name="Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq"/> subjugating the [[Cimmerians]] and [[Scythians]] and exacting tribute from [[Phrygia]], [[Majan (civilization)|Magan]] and [[Land of Punt|Punt]]{{clarify|date=April 2014}} among others.<ref name="Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq"/>

After its fall (between 612 BC and 605 BC), Assyria remained a province and geo-political entity under the Babylonian, Median, [[Achaemenid]], [[Seleucid]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Sassanid]] empires until the [[Arab]] [[Islamic]] invasion and conquest of Mesopotamia in the mid-7th century AD, when it was finally dissolved, after which the remnants of the [[Assyrian people]] (by now almost exclusively [[East Syrian Rite|Eastern Rite]] [[Assyrian Christians]]) gradually became an ethnic, linguistic, cultural and religious minority in the traditional [[Assyrian homeland]]s, surviving there to this day.

Saggs">Saggs notes that: "the destruction of the Assyrian empire did not wipe out its population. They were predominantly peasant farmers and, since Assyria contains some of the best wheat land in the Near East, their descendants would, as opportunity permitted, build new villages over the old cities and carry on with agricultural life, remembering traditions of the former cities. After seven or eight centuries and various vicissitudes, these people became Christians" (''[[The Might That Was Assyria]]'', p. 290).</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jaas.org/edocs/v18n2/Parpola-identity_Article%20-Final.pdf |title=Parpola identity_article|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=19 June 2011| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20110717071922/http://www.jaas.org/edocs/v18n2/Parpola-identity_Article%20-Final.pdf| archivedate= 17 July 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Pre-history of Assyria==
In prehistoric times, the region that was to become known as Assyria (and Subartu) was home to a [[Neanderthal]] culture such as has been found at the [[Shanidar Cave]]. The earliest [[Neolithic]] sites in Assyria were the [[Jarmo]] culture c. 7100 BC and [[Hassuna|Tell Hassuna]], the centre of the ''Hassuna culture'', c. 6000 BC.

During the 3rd millennium BC, a very intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the [[Sumer]]ians and the [[Semitic]] [[Akkadian language|Akkad]]ians throughout [[Mesopotamia]], which included widespread [[wikt:bilingualism|bilingualism]].<ref name='Deutscher'>{{Cite book|title=Syntactic Change in Akkadian: The Evolution of Sentential Complementation|author=Deutscher, Guy|authorlink=Guy Deutscher (linguist)|publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Oxford University Press US]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-19-953222-3|pages=20‚Äì21|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XFwUxmCdG94C}}</ref> The influence of [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] (a [[language isolate]], i.e. not related to any other language) on [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence.<ref name='Deutscher'/> This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the 3rd millennium BC as a ''[[sprachbund]]''.<ref name='Deutscher'/>
[[File:Letter Luenna Louvre AO4238.jpg|thumb|Letter sent by the high-priest Lu'enna to the king of [[Lagash]] (maybe [[Urukagina]]), informing him of his son's death in combat, c. 2400 BC, found in [[Girsu]].]]
Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of Mesopotamia somewhere after the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate),<ref name="woods">Woods C. 2006 "Bilingualism, Scribal Learning, and the Death of Sumerian". In S.L. Sanders (ed) ''Margins of Writing, Origins of Culture'': 91‚Äì120 Chicago [http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/OIS2.pdf]</ref> but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary and scientific language in Mesopotamia until the 1st century AD.

The cities of [[Assur]] (also spelled [[Ashur]] or [[A≈°≈°ur]]) and [[Nineveh]], together with a number of other towns and cities, existed since at least before the middle of the 3rd millennium BC (c. 2600 BC), although they appear to have been Sumerian-ruled administrative centres at this time, rather than independent states.

According to some [[Judaeo-Christian]] writers {{who|date=September 2014}}, the city of Ashur was founded by [[Ashur (Bible)|Ashur]] the son of [[Shem]], who was deified by later generations as the city's patron god {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}. However, it is not among the cities said to have been founded by him in Genesis 10:11‚Äì12, and the far older Assyrian annals make no mention of the much later Judeo-Christian figures of Shem and Ashur.

Assyrian tradition lists an early Assyrian king named [[Ushpia]] as having dedicated the first temple to the god Ashur in the city in the 21st century BC. It is highly likely that the city was named in honour of its patron Assyrian god with the same name.

===Classical dating===
[[George Syncellus]] in his ''Chronographia'' quotes a fragment from [[Julius Africanus]] which dates the founding of Assyria to 2284 BC.<ref>[[Cory's Ancient Fragments]], [[Isaac Preston Cory]], 1832, p. 74.</ref> The Roman historian [[Velleius Paterculus]] citing Aemilius Sura states that Assyria was founded 1995 years before [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] was defeated in 197 BC (at the [[Battle of Cynoscephalae]]) by the Romans.<ref>''Roman History'', Book 1, Chapter 6.</ref> The sum therefore 197 + 1995 = 2192 BC for the foundation of Assyria. [[Diodorus Siculus]] recorded another tradition from [[Ctesias]], that dates Assyria 1,306 years before 883 BC (the starting date of the reign of [[Ashurnasirpal II]]) and so the sum 883 + 1306 = 2189 BC.<ref>''The History of Antiquity'' by Maximilian Duncker, 1877, p.&nbsp;26‚Äì30.</ref> The ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicle]]'' of Eusebius provides yet another date for the founding of Assyria, with the accession of [[Ninus]], dating to 2057 BC, but the Armenian translation of the ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicle]]'' puts this figure back slightly to 2116 BC. Another classical dating tradition found in the ''[[Excerpta Latina Barbari]]'' dates the foundation of Assyria, under [[Belus (Assyrian)|Belus]], to 2206 BC.

==Early Assyria, 2600‚Äì2335 BC==
The city of Ashur, together with a number of other Assyrian cities, seem to have been established by 2600 BC, however it is likely that they were initially Sumerian dominated administrative centres. In c. the late 26th century BC, [[Eannatum]] of [[Lagash]], then the dominant [[Sumer]]ian ruler in Mesopotamia, mentions "smiting [[Subartu]]" (Subartu being the Sumerian name for Assyria). Similarly, in c. the early 25th century BC, [[Lugal-Anne-Mundu]] the king of the Sumerian state of [[Adab (city)|Adab]] lists Subartu as paying tribute to him.

Of the early history of the kingdom of Assyria, little is positively known. In the [[Assyrian King List]], the earliest king recorded was [[Tudiya]]. In archaeological reports from [[Ebla]], it appeared that Tudiya's activities were confirmed with the discovery of a tablet where he concluded a treaty for the operation of a ''[[Karum (trade post)|karum]]'' (trading colony) in Eblaite territory, with "king" Ibrium of Ebla (who is now known to have been the [[vizier]] of Ebla for king [[Ishar-Damu]]). This entire reading is now questionable, as several scholars have more recently argued that the treaty in question may not have been with king Tudiya of Assyria, but rather with the unnamed king of an uncertain location called "Abarsal".

Tudiya was succeeded on the list by [[Adamu]] and then a further thirteen rulers (Yangi, Shuhlamu, Harharu, Mandaru, Imshu, Harshu, Didanu, Hanu, Zuabu, Nuabu, Abazu, Belu and Azarah). Nothing concrete is yet known about these names, although it has been noted that a much later Babylonian tablet listing the ancestral lineage of [[Hammurabi]], the [[Amorite]] king of Babylon, seems to have copied the same names from Tudiya through Nuabu, though in a heavily corrupted form.

The earliest kings, such as Tudiya, who are recorded as ''kings who lived in tents'', were independent semi-nomadic pastoralist rulers.<ref name="Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq"/> These kings at some point became fully urbanised and founded the ''city state'' of [[Ashur]].<ref>Saggs, ''The Might'', 24.</ref>

==Assyria in the Akkadian Empire and Neo-Sumerian Empires==

During the [[Akkadian Empire]] (2334‚Äì2154 BC) the Assyrians, like all the Mesopotamian Semites (and also the Sumerians), became subject to the dynasty of the city state of [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]], centered in central Mesopotamia. The Akkadian Empire founded by [[Sargon the Great]] claimed to encompass the surrounding "four quarters". The region of Assyria, north of the seat of the empire in central Mesopotamia, had also been known as [[Subartu]] by the Sumerians, and the name [[Azuhinum]] in Akkadian records also seems to refer to Assyria proper.

Assyrian rulers were subject to Sargon and his successors, and the city of Ashur became a regional administrative center of the Empire, implicated by the [[Nuzi#Archaeology|Nuzi tablets]].<ref name="Shendge1997">{{cite book|author=Malati J. Shendge|title=The language of the Harappans: from Akkadian to Sanskrit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xb6CZMmwo00C&pg=PA46|accessdate=22 April 2011|date=1 January 1997|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-325-0|page=46}}</ref>

During this period, the Akkadian-speaking Semites of Mesopotamia came to rule an empire encompassing not only Mesopotamia itself but large swathes of Asia Minor, ancient Iran, Elam, the [[Arabian Peninsula]], Canaan and Syria.

Assyria seems to have already been firmly involved in trade in Asia Minor by this time; the earliest known reference to Anatolian ''[[Karum (trade post)|karum]]''s in [[Hittite empire|Hatti]] was found on later cuneiform tablets describing the early period of the Akkadian Empire (c. 2350 BC). On those tablets, Assyrian traders in [[Burushanda]] implored the help of their ruler, Sargon the Great, and this appellation continued to exist throughout the Assyrian Empire for about 1,700 years. The name "Hatti" itself even appears in later accounts of his grandson, [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]], campaigning in Anatolia.

Assyrian and Akkadian traders spread the use of writing in the form of the Mesopotamian [[cuneiform]] script to [[Asia Minor]] and [[The Levant]] (modern [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]]).

However, towards the end of the reign of [[Sargon the Great]], the Assyrian faction rebelled against him; "the tribes of Assyria of the upper country‚Äîin their turn attacked, but they submitted to his arms, and Sargon settled their habitations, and he smote them grievously".<ref>Malati J. Shendge (1 January 1997). The language of the Harappans: from Akkadian to Sanskrit. Abhinav Publications. p. 46. ISBN 978-81-7017-325-0. Retrieved 22 April 2011.</ref>

The Akkadian Empire was destroyed by economic decline and internal civil war, followed by attacks from barbarian [[Gutian people]] in 2154 BC.

The rulers of Assyria during the period between c. 2154 BC and 2112 BC once again became fully independent, as the Gutians are only known to have administered southern Mesopotamia. However, the king list is the only information from Assyria for this period.

Most of Assyria briefly became part of the [[Neo-Sumerian Empire]] (or [[3rd dynasty of Ur]]) founded in c. 2112 BC. Sumerian domination extended as far as the city of Ashur, but appears not to have reached Nineveh and the far north of Assyria. One local ruler (''shakkanakku'') named [[ZƒÅriqum]] (who does not appear on any Assyrian king list) is listed as paying tribute to [[Amar-Sin]] of Ur. Ashur's rulers appear to have remained largely under Sumerian domination until the mid-21st century BC (c. 2050 BC); the king list names Assyrian rulers for this period and several are known from other references to have also borne the title of ''shakkanakka'' or vassal governors for the neo-Sumerians.

==Old Assyrian Kingdom==
The first written inscriptions by 'urbanised' Assyrian kings appear in the mid-21st century BC, after they had shrugged off Sumerian domination. The land of Assyria as a whole then consisted of a number of city states and small Semitic kingdoms, some of which were initially independent of Assyria. The foundation of the first major temple in the city of Ashur was traditionally ascribed to king [[Ushpia]] who reigned c. 2050 BC, possibly a contemporary of [[Ishbi-Erra]] of [[Isin]] and [[Naplanum]] of [[Larsa]].<ref>According to the [[Assyrian King List]] and Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', p. 187.</ref>  He was reputedly succeeded by kings named [[Apiashal]], [[Sulili]], [[Kikkiya]] and [[Akiya]] (died c. 2026 BC), of whom little is known, apart from much later mentions of Kikkiya conducting fortifications on the city walls, and building work on temples in Ashur.

The main rivals, neighbours or trading partners to early Assyrian kings during the 22nd, 21st and 20th centuries BC would have been the [[Hattians]] and [[Hurrians]] to the north in Asia Minor, the [[Gutians]], [[Lullubi]] and [[Turukku]] to the east in the [[Zagros Mountains]] of northwest [[Ancient Iran]], the [[Elamites]] to the southeast in what is now south central Iran, the [[Amorites]] to the west in what is today Syria, and their fellow [[Sumero-Akkadian]] city-states of southern Mesopotamia such as [[Isin]], [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], [[Ur]], [[Eshnunna]] and [[Larsa]].<ref name="Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq"/>

Like many city-states in early Mesopotamian history, Ashur was, to a great extent, originally an [[oligarchy]] rather than a monarchy. Authority was considered to lie with "the City", and the polity had three main centres of power‚Äîan assembly of elders, a hereditary ruler, and an [[eponym]]. The ruler presided over the assembly and carried out its decisions. He was not referred to with the usual Akkadian term for "king", ''≈°arrum''/''Sharru''; that was instead reserved for the city's patron deity [[Assur (god)|Assur]], of whom the ruler was the high priest. The ruler himself was only designated as "the steward of Assur" (''i≈°≈°iak Assur''), where the term for steward is a borrowing from Sumerian ''[[ENSI|ensi(k)]]''. The third centre of power was the eponym (''limmum''), who gave the year his name, similarly to the later [[archons of Athens|archons]] and [[Roman consul|consuls]] of [[Classical Antiquity]]. He was annually elected by [[Sortition|lot]] and was responsible for the economic administration of the city, which included the power to detain people and confiscate property. The institution of the eponym as well as the formula ''i≈°≈°iak Assur'' lingered on as ceremonial vestiges of this early system throughout the history of the Assyrian monarchy.<ref>Larsen, Mogens Trolle (2000): "The old Assyrian city-state". In Hansen, Mogens Herman, ''A comparative study of thirty city-state cultures: an investigation / conducted by the Copenhagen Polis Centre'', p.&nbsp;77‚Äì89.</ref><!--Refers to entire paragraph on political structure-->

===Dynasty of Puzur-Ashur I, 2025‚Äì1809 BC, Old Assyrian Empire===
In approximately 2025 BC (long chronology), [[Puzur-Ashur I]] (perhaps a contemporary of [[Shu-ilishu]] of Larsa and [[Samium]] of Isin) is speculated to have overthrown Kikkiya and founded a new dynasty which was to survive for 216 years. His descendants left inscriptions mentioning him regarding the building of temples to gods such as Ashur, [[Adad]] and [[Ishtar]] in Assyria. The length of his reign is unknown.

[[Shalim-ahum]] (died c. 2009 BC) succeeded the throne at a currently unknown date. He left inscriptions in archaic Old Assyrian regarding the construction of a temple dedicated to the god Ashur, and the placement of [[beer vats]] within it.

[[Ilushuma]]<ref>Lines 27 to 28<!-- OF WHAT?-->: [IE-r]i-≈°u dumu Iilu-≈°um-ma [≈°√° li-ma-ni]-≈°u-ni 40 mume≈° lugalta d√πu≈°.</ref> (c. 2008‚Äì1975 BC) took the throne in c. 2008 BC, and is known from his inscription (extant in several copies) where he claims to have "washed the copper" and "established liberty" for the Akkadians in Sumerian city-states as far as the Persian Gulf. This has been taken by some scholars to imply that he made military campaigns into Southern Mesopotamia to relieve his fellow Mesopotamians from Amorite and Elamite invasions, however some recent scholars have taken the view that the inscription means he supplied these areas with copper from [[Hittite empire|Hatti]], and that the word used for "liberty" (''adduraru'') is usually in the context of his exempting the southern Mesopotamian kings from tariffs.

:''"The freedom<ref group=nb>Freedom: ''addurƒÅru''.</ref> of the Akkadians and their children I established. I purified their copper. I established their freedom from the border of the marshes and Ur and Nippur, [[Awal]], and Kish, [[Der (Sumer)|Der]] of the goddess Ishtar, as far as the City of (Ashur)."''<ref name=grayson>{{ cite book | title = Assyrian Royal Inscriptions, Volume 1 | author = A. K. Grayson | publisher = Otto Harrassowitz | year = 1972 | pages = 7‚Äì8 }}</ref>

Assyria had long held extensive contact with Hattian, Hittite and Hurrian cities on the Anatolian plateau in Asia Minor. The Assyrians who had for centuries traded in the region, and possibly ruled small areas bordering Assyria, now established significant colonies in [[Cappadocia]] (e.g., at [[Kanesh]] (modern [[K√ºltepe]]) from 2008 BC to 1740 BC). These colonies, called ''[[Karum (trade post)|karum]]'', from the Akkadian word for 'port', were attached to Hattian cities in Anatolia, but physically separate, and had special tax status. They must have arisen from a long tradition of trade between Assyria and the Anatolian cities, but no archaeological or written records show this. The trade consisted of metals (copper or tin and perhaps iron; the terminology is not entirely clear) being traded for textiles from Assyria.

[[Erishum I]]<ref>Tablet copies: An 201139 and An 20114</ref> (c. 1974‚Äì1935 BC) vigorously expanded Assyrian colonies in Asia Minor during his long reign, the major ones appearing to be at Kanesh, [[·∏™attu≈°a]] ([[Boƒüazk√∂y]]) (the future capital of the [[Hittite Empire]]) and [[Amkuwa]] ([[Alisar H√∂y√ºk]]), together with a further eighteen smaller colonies. He created some of the earliest examples of [[Written Law]], conducted extensive building work in the form of fortifying the walls of major Assyrian cities and the erection of temples dedicated to Ashur and Ishtar. It is from his reign that the continuous ''limmum'' lists are known, however there are references to the eponym-books for his predecessors having been destroyed at some point.

[[Ikunum]] (c. 1934‚Äì1921 BC)<ref>Cahit G√ºnbattƒ±, An Eponym List (KEL G) from K√ºltepe Altoriental. Forsch. 35 (2008) 1, 103‚Äì132.</ref> built a major temple for the god [[Ningal]]. He further strengthened the fortifications of the city of Assur and maintained Assyria's colonies in Asia Minor.

[[Sargon I]] (c. 1920‚Äì1881 BC)<ref>Klaas R. Veenhof, The old Assyrian list of year eponyms from Karum Kanish and its chronological implications (Ankara, Turkish Historical Society, 2003</ref> succeeded him in c. 1920 BC, and had an unusually long reign of 39 years. It is likely he was named after his illustrious predecessor [[Sargon of Akkad]]. He is known to have refortified the defences of major Assyrian cities, and maintained Assyrian colonies in Asia Minor during his reign. Apart from this, little has yet been unearthed about him. At some point he appears to have withdrawn Assyrian aid to southern Mesopotamia. It was during his reign in Assyria that the initially minor city-state of [[Babylon]] was founded in 1894 BC by an [[Amorite]] ''Malka'' (prince) named [[Sumuabum]].

[[Puzur-Ashur II]] (c. 1881‚Äì1873 BC) came to the throne as an already older man due to his fathers long reign. Little is known about his rule, but it appears to have been uneventful.

[[Naram-Sin of Assyria|Naram-Suen]] (c. 1872‚Äì1818 BC) ascended to the throne in 1872 BC, and is likely named after his predecessor [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]] of the Akkadian Empire. Assyria continued to be wealthy during his 54-year-long reign (one of the longest in the ancient Near East), and he defeated the future usurper king [[Shamshi-Adad I]] who attempted to take his throne.

[[Erishum II]] (c. 1818‚Äì1809 BC) was to be the last king of the dynasty of Puzur-Ashur I, founded c. 2025 BC. After only eight or nine years in power he was overthrown by Shamshi-Adad I, the Amorite usurper who had previously been defeated in an attempt to unseat [[Naram-Sin of Assyria|Naram-Suen]], and who claimed legitimacy by asserting descent from the mid 21st century BC Assyrian king, [[Ushpia]].

===Amorite Period in Assyria, 1809‚Äì1750 BC===
The Amorites were successfully repelled by the Assyrian kings of the 20th and 19th centuries BC.
However, in 1809 BC the native Mesopotamian king of Assyria [[Erishum II]] was deposed, and the throne of Assyria was usurped by [[Shamshi-Adad I]] (c. 1809 ‚Äì 1776 BC) in the expansion of Semitic [[Amorite]] tribes from the [[Khabur River]] delta in the north eastern Levant.

Although regarded as an Amorite by later Assyrian tradition, Shamshi-Adad's descent is suggested to be from the same line as the native Mesopotamian ruler Ushpia in the [[Assyrian King List]]. He put his son [[Ishme-Dagan]] on the throne of a nearby Assyrian city, [[Ekallatum]], and maintained Assyria's Anatolian colonies. Shamshi-Adad I then went on to conquer the kingdom of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] (in modern Syria) on the [[Euphrates]] putting another of his sons, [[Yasmah-Adad]] on the throne there. Shamshi-Adad's Assyria now encompassed the whole of northern Mesopotamia and included territory in central Mesopotamia, Asia Minor and northern Syria. Shamshi-Adad I mentions conducting raids on the [[Canaan]]ite coasts of the far off [[Mediterranean]], where he erected stelae to commemorate his victories. He himself resided in a new capital city founded in the Khabur valley in northern Mesopotamia, called [[Shubat-Enlil]].

[[Ishme-Dagan I]] (1774‚Äì1763 BC) inherited Assyria, but Yasmah-Adad was overthrown by a new king called [[Zimrilim]] in Mari. The new king of Mari allied himself with the [[Amorite]] king [[Hammurabi]] of [[Babylon]], who had made the recently created, and originally minor state of Babylon into a major power. It was from the reign of Hammurabi onwards that southern Mesopotamia came to be known as [[Babylonia]].

Assyria now faced the rising power of Babylon in the south. Ishme-Dagan responded by making an alliance with the enemies of Babylon, and the power struggle continued without resolution for decades. Ishme-Dagan, like his father was a great warrior, and in addition to repelling Babylonian attacks, campaigned successfully against the [[Turukku]] and [[Lullubi]] of the [[Zagros Mountains]] (in modern Iran) who had attacked the Assyrian city of [[Ekallatum]], and against [[Dadusha]], king of [[Eshnunna]], and the state of [[Iamhad]] (modern [[Aleppo]]).

===Assyria under Babylonian domination, 1750‚Äì1732 BC===
Hammurabi, after first conquering Mari, Larsa, and [[Eshnunna]], eventually prevailed over Ishme-Dagan's successor [[Mut-Ashkur]] (1750‚Äì1740 BC), and subjected him to Babylon c. 1750 BC. With Hammurabi, the various ''karum'' colonies in Anatolia ceased trade activity‚Äîprobably because the goods of Assyria were now being traded with the Babylonians. The Assyrian monarchy survived, however the three Amorite kings succeeding Ishme-Dagan, [[Mut-Ashkur]] (who was the son of Ishme-Dagan and married to a Hurrian queen), [[Rimush]] (1739‚Äì1733 BC) and [[Asinum]] (1732 BC), were vassals, dependent on the Babylonians during the reign of Hammurabi, and for a short time, of his successor [[Samsu-iluna]].

===Assyrian Adaside dynasty, 1732‚Äì1451 BC===
The short lived [[Babylonian Empire]] quickly began to unravel upon the death of Hammurabi, and Babylonia lost control over Assyria during the reign of Hammurabi's successor [[Samsu-iluna]] (1750‚Äì1712 BC). A period of civil war ensued after Asinum (a grandson of Shamshi-Adad I and the last Amorite ruler of Assyria) was deposed in approximately 1732 BC by a powerful native Assyrian vice regent named [[Puzur-Sin]], who regarded Asinum as both a foreigner and a former lackey of Babylon.

A native king named [[Ashur-dugul]] seized the throne in 1732 BC, probably with the help of Puzur-Sin. However, he was unable to retain control for long, and was soon deposed by a rival claimant, [[Ashur-apla-idi]]. Internal instability ensued with four further kings ([[Nasir-Sin]], [[Sin-namir]], [[Ipqi-Ishtar]] and [[Adad-salulu]]) all reigning in quick succession over a period of approximately six years between 1732 and 1727 BC. Babylonia seems to have been too powerless to intervene or take advantage of this situation.

Finally, a king named [[Adasi]] (1726‚Äì1701 BC) came to the fore c. 1726 BC and managed to quell the civil unrest and stabilise the situation in Assyria. Adasi completely drove the Babylonians and Amorites from the Assyrian sphere of influence during his reign, and Babylonian power began to quickly wane in Mesopotamia as a whole, also losing the far south of Mesopotamia (an area roughly corresponding to ancient [[Sumer]]) to the native Akkadian-speaking [[Sealand Dynasty]], although the Amorites would retain control over a much reduced and weak Babylonia itself until 1595 BC, when they were overthrown by the [[Kassites]], a people from the [[Zagros]] Mountains who spoke a [[language isolate]] and were neither Semites nor Indo-Europeans.
[[File:Dr√§kt, Assyrier, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|130px|Assyrian, 1400 BC]]

Adasi was succeeded by [[Bel-bani]] (1700‚Äì1691 BC) who is credited in Assyrian annals with inflicting further defeats on the Babylonians and Amorites, and further strengthening and stabilising the kingdom.

Little is currently known of many of the kings that followed such as; [[Libaya]] (1690‚Äì1674 BC), [[Sharma-Adad I]] (1673‚Äì1662 BC), [[Iptar-Sin]] (1661‚Äì1650 BC), [[Bazaya]] (1649‚Äì1622 BC) (a contemporary of [[Peshgaldaramesh]] of the [[Sealand Dynasty]]), [[Lullaya]] (1621‚Äì1618 BC) (who usurperped the throne from Bazaya), [[Shu-Ninua]] (1615‚Äì1602 BC) and [[Sharma-Adad II]] (1601‚Äì1599 BC). However, Assyria seems to have been a relatively strong and stable nation, existing undisturbed by its neighbours such as the Hatti, Hittites, Hurrians, Amorites, Babylonians, Elamites or Mitanni during this period.

Assyria remained strong and secure; when Babylon was sacked and its Amorite rulers deposed by the [[Hittite Empire]], and subsequently fell to the [[Kassites]] in 1595 BC, both powers were unable to make any inroads into Assyria, and there seems to have been no trouble between the first Kassite ruler of Babylon, [[Agum II]], and [[Erishum III]] (1598‚Äì1586 BC) of Assyria, and a mutually beneficial treaty was signed between the two rulers.

[[Shamshi-Adad II]] (1585‚Äì1580 BC), [[Ishme-Dagan II]] (1579‚Äì1562 BC) and [[Shamshi-Adad III]] (1562‚Äì1548 BC) seem also to have had peaceful tenures, although few records have thus far been discovered about their reigns. Similarly, [[Ashur-nirari I]] (1547‚Äì1522 BC) seems not to have been troubled by the newly founded Mitanni Empire in Asia Minor, the Hittite empire, or Babylon during his 25-year reign. He is known to have been an active king, improving the infrastructure, dedicating temples and conducting various building projects throughout the kingdom.

[[Puzur-Ashur III]] (1521‚Äì1498 BC) proved to be a strong and energetic ruler. He undertook much rebuilding work in Assur, the city was refortified and the southern quarters incorporated into the main city defences. Temples to the moon god [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]] ([[Sin (mythology)|Nanna]]) and the sun god [[Shamash]] were erected during his reign. He signed a treaty with [[Burnaburiash I|Burna-Buriash I]] the Kassite king of Babylon, defining the borders of the two nations in the late 16th century BC. He was succeeded by [[Enlil-nasir I]] (1497‚Äì1483 BC) who appears to have had a peaceful and uneventful reign, as does his successor [[Nur-ili]] (1482‚Äì1471 BC).

The son of Nur-ili, [[Ashur-shaduni]] (1470 BC) was deposed by his uncle [[Ashur-rabi I]] (1470‚Äì1451 BC) in his first year of rule. Little is known about his nineteen-year reign, but it appears to have been largely uneventful.

===Assyria in decline, 1450‚Äì1393 BC===
The emergence of the Mitanni Empire in the 16th century BC did eventually lead to a short period of sporadic Mitanni-Hurrian domination in the latter half of the 15th century. The Indo-European-speaking Mitanni are thought to have conquered and formed the ruling class over the indigenous Hurrians of eastern Anatolia. The Hurrians spoke a [[language isolate]], i.e. neither Semitic nor Indo-European.

[[Ashur-nadin-ahhe I]] (1450‚Äì1431 BC) was courted by the [[Egypt]]ians, who were rivals of the Mitanni, and attempting to gain a foothold in the [[Near East]]. [[Amenhotep II]] sent the Assyrian king a tribute of gold to seal an alliance against the Hurri-Mitanni empire. It is likely that this alliance prompted [[Saushtatar]], the Mitanni emperor, to invade Assyria, and sack the city of Ashur, after which Assyria became a sometime vassal state, with Ashur-nadin-ahhe I being forced to pay tribute to Saushtatar. He was deposed by his own brother [[Enlil-nasir II]] (1430‚Äì1425 BC) in 1430 BC, possibly with the aid of the Mitanni, who received tribute from the new king. [[Ashur-nirari II]] (1424‚Äì1418 BC) had an uneventful reign, and appears to have also paid tribute to the Mitanni Empire.<ref name="Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq" />

The Assyrian monarchy survived, and the Mitanni influence appears to have been sporadic. They appear not to have been always willing or indeed able to interfere in Assyrian internal and international affairs.

[[Ashur-bel-nisheshu]] (1417‚Äì1409 BC) seems to have been independent of Mitanni influence, as evidenced by his signing a mutually beneficial treaty with [[Karaindash]], the Kassite king of Babylonia in the late 15th century. He also undertook extensive rebuilding work in Ashur itself, and Assyria appears to have redeveloped its former highly sophisticated financial and economic systems during his reign.

[[Ashur-rim-nisheshu]] (1408‚Äì1401 BC) also undertook building work, strengthening the city walls of the capital.

[[Ashur-nadin-ahhe II]] (1400‚Äì1393 BC) also received a tribute of gold and diplomatic overtures from Egypt, probably in an attempt to gain Assyrian military support against Egypt's Mitanni and Hittite rivals in the region. However, the Assyrian king appears not to have been in a strong enough position to challenge the Mitanni or Hittites.

[[Eriba-Adad I]] (1392‚Äì1366 BC), a son of Ashur-bel-nisheshu, ascended the throne in 1392 BC and finally broke the ties to the Mitanni Empire.

There are dozens of Mesopotamian cuneiform texts from this period, with precise observations of solar and lunar eclipses, that have been used as 'anchors' in the various attempts to define the [[chronology of Babylonia and Assyria]] for the early 2nd millennium BC (i.e., the "high", "middle", and "low" chronologies.)

Scholars variously date the beginning of the "Middle Assyrian period" to either the fall of the Old Assyrian kingdom of [[Shamshi-Adad I]], or to the ascension of [[Ashur-uballit I]] to the throne of Assyria.

===Assyrian expansion and empire, 1392‚Äì1056 BC===
{{See also|Military history of the Neo-Assyrian Empire}}
Assyria had difficulties with keeping the trade routes open. Unlike the situation in the Old Assyrian period, the Anatolian metal trade was effectively dominated by the [[Hittites]] and the [[Hurrians]]. These people now controlled the Mediterranean ports, while the [[Kassites]] controlled the river route south to the [[Persian Gulf]]. The main Assyrian cities of the middle period were [[Assur|Ashur]], [[Kalhu]] ([[Nimrud]]) and [[Nineveh]], all situated in the [[Tigris]] River valley. At the end of the Bronze Age, Nineveh was much smaller than Babylon, but still one of the world's major cities (population c. 33,000). By the end of the Neo-Assyrian period, it had grown to a population of some 120,000, and was possibly the largest city in the world at that time.<ref>see [[historical urban community sizes]]. Estimates are those of Chandler (1987).</ref>

The Middle Assyrian kingdom was well organized, and in the firm control of the king, who also functioned as the High Priest of [[Anshar|Ashur]], the state god. He had certain obligations to fulfill in the cult, and had to provide resources for the temples. The priesthood became a major power in Assyrian society. Conflicts with the priesthood are thought to have been behind the murder of king [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]].

By the reign of [[Eriba-Adad I]] (1392‚Äì1366 BC) Mitanni influence over Assyria was on the wane. Eriba-Adad I became involved in a dynastic battle between [[Tushratta]] and his brother [[Artatama II]] and after this his son [[Shuttarna II]], who called himself king of the Hurri while seeking support from the Assyrians. A pro-Assyria faction appeared at the royal Mitanni court. Eriba-Adad I had thus finally broken Mitanni influence over Assyria, and in turn had now made Assyria an influence over Mitanni affairs.

[[Ashur-uballit I]] (1365‚Äì1330 BC) succeeded the throne of Assyria in 1365 BC, and proved to be a fierce, ambitious and powerful ruler. Assyrian pressure from the southeast and Hittite pressure from the north-west, enabled Ashur-uballit I to break Mitanni power. He met and decisively defeated Shuttarna II, the Mitanni king in battle, making Assyria once more an imperial power at the expense of not only the Mitanni themselves, but also Kassite Babylonia, the Hurrians and the Hittites; and a time came when the Kassite king in Babylon was glad to marry [[Muballi·π≠at-≈†ƒìr≈´a]], the daughter of Ashur-uballit, whose letters to [[Akhenaten]] of Egypt form part of the [[Amarna letters]].

This marriage led to disastrous results for Babylonia, as the Kassite faction at court murdered the half Assyrian Babylonian king and placed a pretender on the throne. Assur-uballit I promptly invaded Babylonia to avenge his son-in-law, entering Babylon, deposing the king and installing [[Kurigalzu II]] of the royal line king there.

Ashur-uballit I then attacked and defeated [[Shattiwaza|Mattiwaza]], the Mitanni king, despite attempts by the Hittite king [[Suppiluliumas]], now fearful of growing Assyrian power, to help the Mitanni. The lands of the Mitanni and Hurrians were duly appropriated by Assyria, making it a large and powerful empire.

[[Enlil-nirari]] (1329‚Äì1308 BC) succeeded Ashur-uballit I. He described himself as a "Great-King" (''Sharru rab√ª'') in letters to the Hittite kings. He was immediately attacked by Kurigalzu II of Babylon who had been installed by his father, but succeeded in defeating him, repelling Babylonian attempts to invade Assyria, counterattacking and appropriating Babylonian territory in the process, thus further expanding Assyria.

The successor of Enlil-nirari, [[Arik-den-ili]] (c. 1307‚Äì1296 BC), consolidated Assyrian power, and successfully campaigned in the [[Zagros]] Mountains to the east, subjugating the Lullubi and Gutians. In Syria, he defeated Semitic tribes of the so-called [[Ahlamu]] group, who were possibly predecessors of the Arameans or an Aramean tribe.

He was followed by [[Adad-nirari I]] (1295‚Äì1275 BC) who made [[Kalhu]] (Biblical [[Calah]]/[[Nimrud]]) his capital, and continued expansion to the northwest, mainly at the expense of the Hittites and Hurrians, conquering Hittite territories such as [[Carchemish]] and beyond. He then moved into north eastern Asia Minor, conquering [[Shupria]].  Adad-nirari I made further gains to the south, annexing Babylonian territory and forcing the Kassite rulers of Babylon into accepting a new frontier agreement in Assyria's favour.

Adad-nirari's inscriptions are more detailed than any of his predecessors. He declares that the gods of Mesopotamia called him to war, a statement used by most subsequent Assyrian kings. He referred to himself again as ''Sharru Rabi'' (meaning "The Great King" in the Akkadian language) and conducted extensive building projects in Ashur and the provinces.

In 1274 BC [[Shalmaneser I]] (1274‚Äì1244 BC) ascended the throne. He proved to be a great warrior king. During his reign he conquered the Hurrian kingdom of [[Urartu]] that would have encompassed most of Eastern Anatolia and the Caucasus Mountains in the 9th century BC, and the fierce Gutians of the Zagros. He then attacked the Mitanni-Hurrians, defeating both King [[Shattuara]] and his Hittite and Aramaean allies, finally completely destroying the Hurri-Mitanni kingdom in the process.

During the campaign against the Hittites, Shattuara cut off the Assyrian army from their supply of food and water, but the Assyrians broke free in a desperate battle, counterattacked, and conquered and annexed what remained of the Mitanni kingdom. Shalmaneser I installed an Assyrian prince, [[Ilu-ippada]] as ruler of Mitanni, with Assyrian governors such as [[Meli-sah]], installed to rule individual cities.

The Hittites, having failed to save Mitanni, allied with Babylon in an unsuccessful economic war against Assyria for many years. Assyria was now a large and powerful empire, and a major threat to Egyptian and Hittite interests in the region, and was perhaps the reason that these two powers, fearful of Assyrian might, made peace with one another.<ref>Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', p. 263.</ref> Like his father, Shalmaneser was a great builder and he further expanded the city of Kalhu at the juncture of the Tigris and Zab Rivers.

Shalmaneser's son and successor, [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] (1244‚Äì1207 BC), won a major victory against the Hittites and their king [[Tudhaliya IV]] at the [[Battle of Nihriya]] and took thousands of prisoners. He then conquered Babylonia, taking [[Kashtiliash IV]] as a captive and ruled there himself as king for seven years, taking on the old title "King of Sumer and Akkad" first used by Sargon of Akkad. Tukulti-Ninurta I thus became the first Akkadian speaking native Mesopotamian to rule the state of Babylonia, its founders having been foreign Amorites, succeeded by equally foreign Kassites. Tukulti-Ninurta petitioned the god [[Shamash]] before beginning his counter offensive.<ref name=edwards>{{cite book | title = Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 2, Part 2, History of the Middle East and the Aegean Region, c. 1380‚Äì1000 BC | chapter = Assyrian Military Power, 1300‚Äì1200 B.C. | author = J.

In the process he defeated the Elamites, who had themselves coveted Babylon. He also wrote an epic poem documenting his wars against Babylon and Elam.

As relations with the priesthood in Ashur began deteriorating, Tukulti-Ninurta built a new capital city; [[Kar-Tukulti-Ninurta]].<ref>Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', pp. 26‚Äì34.</ref>

A number of historians, including [[Julian Jaynes]], identify [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] and his deeds as the historical origin for the fictional biblical character [[Nimrod]] in the Old Testament.

However, Tukulti-Ninurta's sons rebelled and besieged the ageing king in his capital. He was murdered and then succeeded by [[Ashur-nadin-apli]] (1206‚Äì1203 BC) who left the running of his empire to Assyrian regional governors such as [[Adad-bƒìl-gabbe]]. Another unstable period for Assyria followed, it was riven by periods of internal strife and the new king only made token and unsuccessful attempts to recapture Babylon, whose Kassite kings had taken advantage of the upheavals in Assyria and freed themselves from Assyrian rule. However, Assyria itself was not threatened by foreign powers during the reigns of [[Ashur-nirari III]] (1202‚Äì1197 BC), [[Enlil-kudurri-usur]] (1196‚Äì1193 BC) and [[Ninurta-apal-Ekur]] (1192‚Äì1180 BC), although Ninurta-apal-Ekur usurped the throne from Enlil-kudurri-usur.

[[Ashur-Dan I]] (1179‚Äì1133 BC) stabilised the internal unrest in Assyria during his unusually long reign, quelling instability. During the twilight years of the Kassite dynasty in Babylonia, he <ref>''Synchronistic History'', ii 9‚Äì12.</ref> records that he seized northern Babylonia, including the cities of [[Zaban]], [[Irriya]] and [[Ugar-sallu]] during the reigns of [[Marduk-apla-iddina I]] and [[Zababa-shuma-iddin]], plundering them and "taking their vast booty to Assyria." However, the conquest of northern Babylonia brought Assyria into direct conflict with Elam which had taken the remainder of Babylonia. The powerful Elamites, under king [[Shutruk-Nahhunte]], fresh from sacking Babylon, entered into a protracted war with Assyria, they briefly took the Assyrian city of [[Arrapkha]], which Ashur-Dan I then retook, eventually defeating the Elamites and forcing a treaty upon them in the process.<!--<ref name=kertai/>-->

Another very brief period of internal upheaval followed the death of Ashur-Dan I when his son and successor [[Ninurta-tukulti-Ashur]] (1133 BC) was deposed in his first year of rule by his own brother [[Mutakkil-Nusku]] and forced to flee to Babylonia. [[Mutakkil-Nusku]] himself died in the same year (1133 BC).

A third brother, [[Ashur-resh-ishi I]] (1133‚Äì1116 BC) took the throne. This was to lead to a renewed period of Assyrian expansion and empire. As the Hittite empire collapsed from the onslaught of the Indo-European [[Phrygians]] (called [[Mushki]] in Assyrian annals), Babylon and Assyria began to vie for Aramaean regions (in modern Syria), formerly under firm Hittite control. When their forces encountered one another in this region, the Assyrian king [[Ashur-resh-ishi I]] met and defeated [[Nebuchadnezzar I]] of Babylon on a number of occasions. Assyria then invaded and annexed Hittite-controlled lands in Asia Minor, Aram (Syria), and Gutians and Kassite regions in the Zagros, marking an upsurge in imperian expansion.

[[Tiglath-Pileser I]] (1115‚Äì1077 BC), vies with [[Shamshi-Adad I]] and [[Ashur-uballit I]] among historians as being regarded as the founder of the first Assyrian empire. The son of Ashur-resh-ishi I, he ascended to the throne upon his father's death, and became one of the greatest of Assyrian conquerors during his 38-year reign.{{sfnp|''EB'', "Tiglath-Pileser"|1911}}

His first campaign in 1112 BC was against the Phrygians who had attempted to occupy certain Assyrian districts in the Upper Euphrates region of Asia Minor; after defeating and driving out the Phrygians he then overran the [[Luwian]] kingdoms of [[Commagene]], Cilicia and Cappadocia in western Asia Minor, and drove the Neo-Hittites from the Assyrian province of Subartu, northeast of [[Malatia]].

In a subsequent campaign, the Assyrian forces penetrated Urartu, into the mountains south of [[Lake Van]] and then turned westward to receive the submission of Malatia. In his fifth year, Tiglath-Pileser again attacked Commagene, Cilicia and Cappadocia, and placed a record of his victories engraved on copper plates in a fortress he built to secure his Anatolian conquests.

The Aramaeans of northern and central Syria were the next targets of the Assyrian king, who made his way as far as the sources of the Tigris.{{sfnp|''EB'', "Tiglath-Pileser"|1911}} The control of the high road to the Mediterranean was secured by the possession of the Hittite town of [[Pitru]]<ref>Bryce, Trevor.

Leo Oppenheim]] translates as a [[narwhal]]) in the sea.{{sfnp|''EB'', "Tiglath-Pileser"|1911}} He was passionately fond of hunting and was also a great builder. The general view is that the restoration of the temple of the gods [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]] and [[Hadad]] at the Assyrian capital of Assur (Ashur) was one of his initiatives.{{sfnp|''EB'', "Tiglath-Pileser"|1911}}
He also invaded and defeated Babylon twice, assuming the old title "King of Sumer and Akkad", forcing tribute from Babylon, although he did not actually depose the actual king in Babylonia, where the old ''Kassite Dynasty'' had now succumbed to an Elamite one.

He was succeeded by [[Asharid-apal-Ekur]] (1076‚Äì1074 BC) who reigned for just two years. His reign marked the elevation of the office of ''umm√¢nu'' (royal scribe) in importance.

[[Ashur-bel-kala]] (1073‚Äì1056 BC) kept the vast empire together, campaigning successfully against Urartu and Phrygia to the north and the Arameans to the west. He maintained friendly relations with [[Marduk-shapik-zeri]] of Babylon, however upon the death of that king, he invaded Babylonia and deposed the new ruler [[Kada≈°man-Buria≈°]], appointing [[Adad-apla-iddina]] as his vassal in Babylon. He built some of the earliest examples of both [[Zoological Gardens]] and [[Botanical Gardens]] in Ashur, collecting all manner of animals and plants from his empire, and receiving a collection of exotic animals as tributes from Egypt.

He was also a great hunter, describing his exploits "at the city of [[Araziqu]] which is before the land of Hatti and at the foot of [[Mount Lebanon]]." These locations show that well into his reign Assyria still controlled a vast empire.

Late in his reign, the Middle Assyrian Empire erupted into civil war, when a rebellion was orchestrated by [[Tukulti-Mer]], a pretender to the throne of Assyria. Ashur-bel-kala eventually crushed Tukulti-Mer and his allies, however the civil war in Assyria had allowed hordes of Arameans to take advantage of the situation, and press in on Assyrian controlled territory from the west. Ashur-bel-kala counterattacked them, and conquered as far as Carchemish and the source of the [[Khabur river]], but by the end of his reign many of the areas of Syria and Phoenicia-Canaan to the west of these regions as far as the Mediterranean, previously under firm Assyrian control, were eventually lost to the Assyrian Empire.

===Assyria during the Bronze Age Collapse, 1055‚Äì936 BC===
The [[Bronze Age Collapse]] from 1200 BC to 900 BC was a [[Dark Ages (historiography)|dark age]] for the entire [[Near East]], [[North Africa]], [[Asia Minor]], [[Caucasus]], [[Mediterranean]] and [[Balkan]] regions, with great upheavals and mass movements of people.

Assyria and its empire were not unduly affected by these tumultuous events for some 150 years, perhaps the only ancient power that was not. However, upon the death of [[Ashur-bel-kala]] in 1056 BC, Assyria went into a ''comparative'' decline for the next 100 or so years. The empire shrank significantly, and by 1020 BC Assyria appears to have controlled only areas close to Assyria itself, essential to keeping trade routes open in eastern Aramea, south eastern Asia Minor, central Mesopotamia and north western Iran.

New [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]] peoples such as the Arameans, [[Chaldea]]ns and [[Suteans]] moved into areas to the west and south of Assyria, including overrunning much of Babylonia to the south, Indo-European speaking [[Iranic]] peoples such as the [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]] and [[Parthians]] moved into the lands to the east of Assyria, displacing the native Gutians and pressuring Elam and [[Mannea]] (which were all ancient non Indo-European civilisations of Iran), and to the north the Phrygians overran the Hittites, a new Hurrian state named Urartu arose in the Caucasus, and Cimmerians, [[Colchians]] (Georgians) and Scythians around the Black Sea and Caucasus. Egypt was divided and in disarray, and Israelites were battling with other fellow Semitic Canaanite peoples such as the [[Amalekites]], [[Moabites]], [[Edomites]] and [[Ammonites]] and the non-Semitic [[Peleset]]/[[Philistines]] (who have been conjectured to be one of the so-called [[Sea Peoples]])<ref name=AK2013>{{citation|title=The Philistines and Other "Sea Peoples" in Text and Archaeology|work=Society of Biblical Literature Archaeology and biblical studies|volume=15|first=Ann E.|last=Killebrew|publisher=Society of Biblical Lit|date=2013|isbn=9781589837218|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gBCl2IQfNioC&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=2}}. Quote: "First coined in 1881 by the French Egyptologist G. Maspero (1896), the somewhat misleading term "Sea Peoples" encompasses the ethnonyms Lukka, Sherden, Shekelesh, Teresh, Eqwesh, Denyen, Sikil / Tjekker, Weshesh, and Peleset (Philistines). [Footnote: The modern term "Sea Peoples" refers to peoples that appear in several New Kingdom Egyptian texts as originating from "islands" (tables 1-2; Adams and Cohen, this volume; see, e.g., [[Robert Drews|Drews]] 1993, 57 for a summary). The use of quotation marks in association with the term "Sea Peoples" in our title is intended to draw attention to the problematic nature of this commonly used term. It is noteworthy that the designation "of the sea" appears only in relation to the Sherden, Shekelesh, and Eqwesh. Subsequently, this term was applied somewhat indiscriminately to several additional ethnonyms, including the Philistines, who are portrayed in their earliest appearance as invaders from the north during the reigns of Merenptah and Ramesses Ill (see, e.g., Sandars 1978; Redford 1992, 243, n. 14; for a recent review of the primary and secondary literature, see Woudhuizen 2006).

Despite the apparent weakness of Assyria in comparison to its former might, at heart it in fact remained a solid, well defended nation whose warriors were the best in the world.<ref>Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq</ref> Assyria, with its stable monarchy, powerful army and secure borders was in a stronger position during this time than potential rivals such as Egypt, Babylonia, Elam, Phrygia, Urartu, Persia and Media.<ref>According to Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', pp.&nbsp;282‚Äì283.</ref> Kings such as [[Ashur-bel-kala]], [[Eriba-Adad II]], [[Ashur-rabi II]], [[Ashurnasirpal I]], [[Tiglath-Pileser II]] and [[Ashur-Dan II]] successfully defended Assyria's borders and upheld stability during this tumultuous time.

Assyrian kings during this period appear to have adopted a policy of maintaining and defending a compact, secure nation and satellite colonies immediately surrounding it, and interspersed this with sporadic punitive raids and invasions of neighbouring territories when the need arose.

[[Eriba-Adad II]] ruled for only two years, and in that time continued to campaign against the Arameans and neo-Hittites before he was deposed by his elderly uncle [[Shamshi-Adad IV]] (1053‚Äì1050 BC) who appears to have had an uneventful reign. [[Ashurnasirpal I]] (1049‚Äì1031 BC) succeeded him, and during his reign he continued to campaign endlessly against the Arameans to the west. Assyria was also afflicted by famine during this period. [[Shalmaneser II]] (1030‚Äì1019 BC) appears to have lost territory in the Levant to the Arameans, who also appear to have also occupied [[Nairi]] in southeast Asia Minor, hitherto an Assyrian colony.

[[Ashur-nirari IV]] took the throne in 1018 BC, and captured the Babylonian city of [[Atlila]] from [[Simbar-Shipak]] and continued Assyrian campaigns against the Arameans. He was eventually deposed by his uncle [[Ashur-rabi II]] in 1013 BC.

During the reign of [[Ashur-rabi II]] (1013‚Äì972 BC) Aramaean tribes took the cities of [[Pitru]] and [[Mutkinu]] (which had been taken and colonized by Tiglath Pileser I.) This event showed how far Assyria could assert itself militarily when the need arose. The Assyrian king attacked the Arameans, forced his way to the far off Mediterranean and constructed a [[stele]] in the area of [[Mount Atalur]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Calculated Frightfulness of Ashur Nasir Pal|first=A.T.|last= Olmstead|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=38|year=1918|pages=209‚Äì263}}</ref>

[[Ashur-resh-ishi II]] (971‚Äì968 BC) in all likelihood a fairly elderly man due to the length of his father's reign, had a largely uneventful period of rule, concerning himself with defending Assyria's borders and conducting various rebuilding projects within Assyria.

[[Tiglath-Pileser II]] (967‚Äì936 BC) succeeded him, and reigned for 28 years. He maintained the policies of his recent predecessors, but appears to have had an uneventful reign.

==Neo-Assyrian Empire, 911‚Äì612 BC==
[[File:Map of Assyria.png|thumb|300px|Map of the Neo-Assyrian Empire and its expansions.]]
{{main|Neo-Assyrian Empire|Military history of the Neo-Assyrian Empire}}

[[Ashur-Dan II]] (935‚Äì912 BC) oversaw a marked economic and organisational upturn in the fortunes of Assyria, laying the platform for it to once again forge an empire. He is recorded as having made successful punitive raids outside the borders of Assyria to clear [[Aramaeans|Aramean]] and other tribal peoples from the regions surrounding Assyria in all directions. He concentrated on rebuilding Assyria within its natural borders, from [[Tur Abdin]] to [[Arrapha]] ([[Kirkuk]]), he built government offices in all provinces, and created a major economic boost by providing ploughs throughout the land, which yielded record grain production.

The Neo-Assyrian Empire is usually considered to have begun with the accession of [[Adad-nirari II]], in [[911 BC]], lasting until the fall of Nineveh at the hands of the [[Babylonians|Babylonians, Chaldeans]], [[Medes|Medes/Persians]], [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] in 612 BC.<ref>[http://www.allempires.com/article/index.php?q=ae_chart Chart of World Kingdoms, Nations and Empires‚ÄîAll Empires]</ref>

===Expansion, 911‚Äì627 BC===
When the ancient Dark Ages (which for Assyria lasted from 1050 to 936 BC) finally lifted, the world had changed dramatically. Ancient kingdoms such as Assyria, Babylonia, Elam and Egypt still endured, the Hittites did also, in the form of smaller Neo-Hittite states. A number of new states had arisen during the tumultuous time between 1200 and 936 BC, such as; Persia, Media, Parthia, Mannea, Israel, Urartu, Phrygia, Lydia, the Aramean and Phoenician states of the Levant, Doric Greece, Putria (Libya), Colchia, Tabal, Nubia/Kush. In addition, other nations and peoples; such as Chaldea, Judah, Scythia, Cimmeria, Samaria, Ethiopia, Nabatea, Armenia and the Arabs were to emerge in the following centuries.

However, the ancient state of Assyria would once more rise to prominence, and Assyria was to meet and defeat these new peoples, together with old foes, over the coming three centuries.<ref name="Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq" />

Beginning with the campaigns of [[Adad-nirari II]] (911-892 BC), Assyria once more became a great power, growing to be the greatest empire the world had yet seen. The new king firmly subjugated the areas that were previously only under nominal Assyrian vassalage, conquering and deporting troublesome [[Aramaeans|Aramean]], [[Neo-Hittite]] and [[Hurrian]] populations in the north to far-off places. Adad-nirari II then twice attacked and defeated [[Shamash-mudammiq]] of [[Babylonia]], annexing a large area of land north of the [[Diyala River]] and the towns of [[Hƒ´t]] and [[Zanqu]] in mid Mesopotamia. Later in his reign, he made further gains against King [[Nabu-shuma-ukin I]] of [[Babylonia]]. He then conquered [[Kadmuh]] and [[Nisibin]] from the [[Arameans]], and secured the [[Khabur]] region.

His successor, [[Tukulti-Ninurta II]] (891‚Äì884 BC) consolidated Assyria's gains and expanded into the [[Zagros Mountains]] in modern [[Iran]], subjugating the newly arrived [[Persian people|Persians]], Parthians and [[Medes]] as well as pushing into central [[Asia Minor]].
[[File:Assyrian Attack on a Town.jpg|thumb|Assyrian attack on a town with archers and a wheeled battering ram, 865‚Äì860 BC]]
[[Ashurnasirpal II]] (883‚Äì859 BC) was a fierce and ruthless ruler who advanced without opposition through [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]] and [[Canaan]] (modern [[Syria]], [[Lebannon]], [[Jordan]] and [[Israel]]) and [[Asia Minor]] as far as the [[Mediterranean]] and conquered and exacted tribute from [[Aramea]], [[Phrygia]] and [[Phoenicia]] among others. Ashurnasirpal II also repressed revolts among the [[Medes]] and [[Persia]]ns in the Zagros Mountains, and moved his capital to the city of [[Kalhu]] ([[Calah]]/[[Nimrud]]). The palaces, temples and other buildings raised by him bear witness to a considerable development of wealth, science, architecture and art. He also built a number of new heavily fortified towns, such as [[Imgur-Enlil]] ([[Balawat]]), [[Tushhan]], [[Kar-Ashurnasirpal]] and [[Nibarti-Ashur]]. Ashurnasirpal II also had a keen interest in [[Botany]] and [[Zoology]]; collecting all manner of plants, seeds and animals to be displayed in Assyria.

[[Shalmaneser III]] (858‚Äì823 BC) had his authority challenged by a large alliance of a dozen nations, some of which were vassals, including; [[Babylonia]], [[Egypt]], [[Elam]], [[Persia]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], [[Hamath]], [[Phoenicia]], the [[Arabs]], [[Arameans]], [[Suteans]] and neo [[Hittites]] among others, fighting them to a standstill at the [[Battle of Qarqar]]. The failure of this alliance prevented pharaoh [[Osorkon II]] from regaining an Egyptian foothold in the Near East.

Subsequent to this, Shalmaneser III attacked and reduced [[Babylonia]] to vassalage, including subjugating the [[Chaldea]]n, [[Aramean]] and [[Sutean]] tribes settled within it. He then defeated [[Aramea]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], [[Moab]], [[Edom]], [[Urartu]], [[Phoenicia]], the [[Neo-Hittite]] states and the desert dwelling [[Arabs]] of the Arabian Peninsula, forcing all of these to pay tribute to Assyria.

It is in Assyrian accounts of the 850's BC, recorded during the reign of [[Shalmaneser III]], that the [[Arab people|Arabs]] and [[Chaldea]]ns first enter the pages of written history.

His armies penetrated to [[The Caucasus]], [[Lake Van]] and the [[Taurus Mountains]]; the Hittites around Carchemish were compelled to pay tribute, and the kingdoms of [[Hamath]] and [[Aram Damascus]] were subdued. In 831 BC, he received the submission of the [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]n kingdom of [[Tabal]]. He consolidated Assyrian control over the regions conquered by his predecessors and, by the end of his 27-year reign, Assyria was master of Mesopotamia, The Levant, western Iran, Israel, Jordan and much of Asia Minor. Due to old age, in the last 6 years of his reign he passed command of his armies to the "Turtanu" (General) [[Dayyan-Assur]].

However, his successor, [[Shamshi-Adad V]] (822-811 BC) (also known as [[Shamshi-Ramman II]]), inherited an empire beset by civil war in Assyria itself. The first years of his reign saw a serious struggle for the succession of the aged Shalmaneser III. The revolt, which had broken out by 826 BC, was led by Shamshi-Adad's brother [[Assur-danin-pal]]. The rebellious brother, according to Shamshi-Adad's own inscriptions, succeeded in bringing to his side 27 important cities, including [[Nineveh]] and [[Babylon]]. The rebellion lasted until 820 BC, preventing Assyria expanding its empire further until it was quelled.

Later in his reign, Shamshi-Adad V successfully campaigned against both [[Babylonia]] and [[Elam]], and forced a treaty in Assyria's favour on the Babylonian king [[Marduk-zakir-shumi I]]. In [[814 BCE]], he won the battle of [[Dur-Papsukkal]] against the new Babylonian king [[Murduk-balassu-iqbi]], and went on to subjugate the immigrant tribes of [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Arameans|Aramean]]s, and [[Sutean]]s who had recently settled in parts of [[Babylonia]].

He was succeeded by [[Adad-nirari III]] (810‚Äì782 BC), who was merely a boy. The Empire was thus ruled by his mother, the famed queen [[Semiramis]] ([[Shammuramat]]), until 806 BC. [[Semiramis]] held the empire together, and appears to have campaigned successfully in subjugating the [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Parthians]] and [[Medes]] during her regency, leading to the later [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] and also [[Greeks|Greek]] myths and legends surrounding her.<ref>Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', p.&nbsp;301‚Äì2.</ref>

In 806 BC, [[Adad-nirari III]] took the reins of power from [[Semiramis]]. He invaded the [[Levant]] and subjugated the [[Arameans]], [[Phoenicians]], [[Philistines]], [[Israelites]], [[Neo-Hittites]], [[Moabites]] and [[Edomites]]. He entered [[Damascus]] and forced tribute upon its [[Aramaeans|Aramean]] king [[Ben-Hadad III]]. He next turned eastward to [[Iran]], and subjugated the [[Persia]]ns, [[Medes]] and the pre Iranian [[Manneans]], penetrating as far north east as the [[Caspian Sea]]. He then turned south, forcing [[Babylonia]] to pay tribute. His next targets were the migrant [[Aramean]], [[Chaldean Dynasty|Chaldean]] and [[Sutu, Iran|Sutu]] tribes, who had settled in the far south eastern corner of Mesopotamia, whom he conquered and reduced to vassalage. Then the [[Arabs]] in the deserts of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] to the south of Mesopotamia were invaded, vanquished and forced to pay tribute also.
[[File:Human headed winged bull profile.jpg|right|thumb|A [[lamassu]] from the palace of Sargon II at [[Dur-Sharrukin]].]]

It is from this general period that the [[Cilician]] [[Indo-Anatolian]] term ''Surai'' ([[Syria]]) first appears in historical record in what is now called the [[√áinek√∂y inscription]], not in reference to the region of [[Aramea]] now encompassing modern Syria in [[The Levant]], but specifically and only to Assyria itself.

Adad-nirari III died prematurely in 782 BC, which led to a temporary period of stagnation within the empire. Assyria continued its military dominance, however [[Shalmaneser IV]] (782 - 773 BC) himself seems to have wielded little personal authority, and a victory over [[Argishti I]], king of [[Urartu]] at [[Til Barsip]] is accredited to an Assyrian General ([[Turtanu]]) named [[Shamshi-ilu]], who does not even bother to mention his king. Shamshi-ilu also scored victories over the [[Arameans]], [[Phrygians]], [[Persian people|Persians]] and [[Neo-Hittites]], and again, takes personal credit at the expense of his king.

[[Ashur-dan III]] ascended the throne in 772 BC. He proved to be a largely ineffectual ruler who was beset by internal rebellions in the cities of [[Ashur]], [[Arrapkha]] and [[Guzana]]; and his personal authority was checked by powerful generals, such as Shamshi-ilu. He failed to make any further gains in Babylonia, Canaan and [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]]. His reign was also marred by [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] and an ominous [[Solar Eclipse]] and, as with his predecessor, military victories were credited to Shamshi-ilu.

[[Ashur-nirari V]] became king in 754 BC, the early part of his reign seems to have been one of permanent internal revolution, and he apprears to have barely left his palace in [[Nineveh]]. However, later in his reign he led a number of successful campaigns in [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Levant]]. He was deposed by [[Tiglath-pileser III]] in 745 BC bringing a resurgence to Assyrian expansion.

[[Tiglath-Pileser III]] (745‚Äì727 BC), a usurper whose original name was ''Pulu'', initiated a renewed period of Assyrian expansion; [[Urartu]], [[Persia]], [[Median Empire|Media]], [[Mannea]], [[Babylonia]], [[Arabia]], [[Phoenicia]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], [[Samaria]], [[Nabatea]], [[Chaldea]], [[Cyprus]], [[Moab]], [[Edom]] and the [[Neo-Hittites]] were subjugated, Tiglath-Pileser III was declared king in [[Babylon]] and the Assyrian empire was now stretched from the [[Caucasus Mountains]] to [[Arabia]] and from the [[Caspian Sea]] to [[Cyprus]].

Tiglath-Pileser III had reorganised the Assyrian army into the first professional fighting force in history, he also incorporated conquered peoples into the imperial army to serve as light infantry, thus expanding the size of the army. He greatly improved the civil administration of his empire, reducing the influence of hitherto powerful nobles, regional governors and viceroys, and deporting troublesome peoples to other parts of his vast empire, setting the template for all future ancient empires<ref>Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq''</ref>
Tiglath-Pileser III also introduced [[Mesopotamian]] [[Eastern Aramaic]] as the ''Lingua Franca'' of Assyria and its vast empire, whose Akkadian infused descendant dialects still survive among the modern [[Assyrian Christian]] people to this day.<ref>Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', p. 308.</ref>

[[Shalmaneser V]] (726‚Äì723 BC) consolidated Assyrian power during his short reign, and repressed [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] attempts to gain a foothold in the near east, defeating and driving out Pharaoh [[Shoshenq V]] from the region. He is mentioned in Biblical sources as having conquered [[Israel]] and being responsible for deporting the [[Ten Lost Tribes of Israel]] to Assyria. He and his successor also brought the [[Samaritans]], people originating from Babylon, Cuthah, Ava, Sepharvaim and Hamath, and settled them in the towns of Samaria to replace the Israelites.<ref>2 Kings 17:24</ref>

[[File:Loewenjagd -645-635 Niniveh.JPG|thumb|Relief showing a [[Lion hunting|lion hunt]], from the north palace of [[Nineveh]], 645-635 BC]]

[[Sargon II]] (722‚Äì705 BC) maintained the empire, driving the [[Cimmerians]] and [[Scythians]] from [[Ancient Iran]], where they had invaded and attacked the [[Persia]]ns and [[Medes]], who were vassals of Assyria. [[Deioces]], king of the Medes and Persians was then forced to pay tribute after launching a failed rebellion against Assyria. When in 720 BCE a revolt occurred in [[Canaan]] against [[Sargon II]], king Hanno sought the help of Pharaoh [[Osorkon IV]] of the 22nd Dynasty of [[Egypt]]. The Egyptian king sent a general named [[Raia (general)|Raia]] as well as troops in order to support the neighboring ally. However, the coalition was defeated in battle at [[Rafah|Raphia]]: Raia fled back to Egypt, Raphia and [[Gaza City|Gaza]] were looted and Hanno was [[Death by burning|burnt alive]] by the Assyrians.<ref name=kk>Kitchen, ¬ß¬ß&nbsp;333‚Äì36;&nbsp;463‚Äì64</ref><ref name=G3412>Grimal, pp.&nbsp;341‚Äì42</ref><br>
In 716 BCE Sargon II crossed the Sinai and amassed an army on Egypt's border. Osorkon IV personally met the Assyrian king at the "[[Brook of Egypt]]" (most likely [[el-Arish]]) and was forced pay tribute to Sargon II to avoid being invaded.<ref name=kk/> [[Mannea]], [[Cilicia]] [[Cappadocia]] and [[Commagene]] were conquered, [[Urartu]] was ravaged, and [[Babylonia]], [[Chaldea]], [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]], [[Phoenicia]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], [[Arabia]], [[Cyprus]] and the famed [[Midas]] (king of [[Phrygia]]) were forced to pay tribute. His ''stele'' has been found as far west as [[Larnaca]] in [[Cyprus]]. Sargon II conquered [[Gurgum]], [[Milid]], the [[Georgian people|Georgian]] state of [[Tabal]], and all of the Neo-[[Hittites|Hittite]] kingdoms of the [[Taurus Mountains]]. [[Egypt]], now under a new [[Nubia]]n dynasty, once again attempted to gain ground in the region by supporting [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel's]] rebellion against the empire, however Sargon II once again crushed the uprising, and [[Piye]] was routed and driven back over the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]]. Sargon II was killed in 705 BC while on a punitive raid against the [[Cimmerians]], and was succeeded by [[Sennacherib]].

[[Sennacherib]] (705-681 BC), a ruthless ruler, defeated the [[Greeks]] who were attempting to gain a foothold in [[Cilicia]], and then defeated and drove the [[Nubia]]n ruled [[Egyptians]] from the [[Near East]] where the new Nubian Pharaoh [[Taharqa]] had once again fomented revolt against Assyria among the [[Israelites]], [[Judeans]] and [[Canaanites]].

[[Sennacherib]] was forced to contend with a major revolt within his empire, which included a large alliance of subject peoples, including [[Babylonians]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Medes]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Elamites]], [[Parthians]], [[Manneans]] and [[Arameans]]. The prime movers in this rebellion were [[Mushezib-Marduk]] of Babylonia, [[Achaemenes]] of Persia, [[Khumban-umena III]] of Elam, and [[Deioces]] of Media. The [[Battle of Halule]] was fought in 691 BC between Sennacherib and his enemies,  in which this vast alliance failed to overthrow Sennacherib. The Assyrian king was then able to subjugate these nations individually, [[Babylon]] was sacked and largely destroyed by Sennacherib.

He sacked [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], subjugated the [[Samaritans]] and laid siege to [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], forcing tribute upon it. He installed his own son [[Ashur-nadin-shumi]] as king in Babylonia. He maintained Assyrian domination over the Medes, Manneans and Persians to the east, Asia Minor and the southern Caucasus to the north and north west, and the Levant, Phoenicia and Aram in the west.

Sennacherib's palace and garden at [[Nineveh]] have been proposed by some scholars as the true location of the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]].<ref>[[Stephanie Dalley]] (2013) ''The Mystery of the Hanging Garden of Babylon: an elusive world Wonder traced'' OUP ISBN 978-0-19-966226-5</ref> During the reign of Sennacherib, the previously minor city of [[Nineveh]] (extant since approximately 3000 BC) was transformed into the capital of Assyria, growing at its height to be the largest city in the world at the time, with a population of up to 150,000 people.<ref>Thorkild Jacobsen and Seton Lloyd, Sennacherib's Aqueduct at Jerwan, Oriental Institute Publication 24, University of Chicago Press, 1935</ref>

Sennacherib was murdered by his own sons (according to the Bible the sons were named [[Adrammelech]], [[Abimelech]] and [[Sharezer]]) in a palace revolt, apparently in revenge for the destruction of Babylon, a city sacred to all Mesopotamians, including the Assyrians.

[[File:Lachishsiege1.PNG|right|thumb|[[Judea]]n captives being led away into slavery by the Assyrians after the [[siege of Lachish]] in 701 BC]]

[[Esarhaddon]] (680‚Äì669 BC) expanded Assyria still further, campaigning deep into the [[Caucasus Mountains]] in the north, defeating king [[Rusas II]] and breaking [[Urartu]] completely in the process. Esarhaddon campaigned successfully subjugating the [[Scythian]] king [[Ishpakaia]], and the [[Cimmerian]] king [[Teushpa]] in Asia Minor, and in Ancient Iran, the [[Manneans]], [[Gutians]], [[Persian people|Persians]] and [[Phraortes]] the king of the [[Medes]] were subjugated.

To the west, the kings of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], [[Edom]], [[Moab]], [[Israel]], [[Sidon]], [[Ekron]], [[Byblos]], [[Arvad]], [[Samarra]], [[Ammon]], [[Amalek]],  and the ten [[Greeks|Greek]] kings of [[Cyprus]], are listed as Assyrian subjects.

Esarhaddon expanded the empire as far south as [[Arabia]], [[Meluhha]], [[Magan]] and [[Dilmun]] (modern [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Bahrain]] the [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Qatar]]).

Tiring of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]ian interference in the Assyrian Empire, Esarhaddon decided to conquer Egypt. In 671 BC crossed the [[Sinai Desert]], and invaded and took [[Egypt]] with surprising ease and speed, driving its foreign [[Nubian people|Nubian]]/[[Kushite]] and [[Ethiopia]]n rulers out and destroying the [[Kushite Empire]] in the process.  Esarhaddon now declared himself "king of [[Egypt]], [[Libya]], and [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]]", and returned with rich booty from the cities of the delta; he erected a victory stele at this time, and paraded the captive Nubian Prince [[Ushankhuru]], the son of Taharqa in Nineveh. Esarhaddon stationed a small army in northern Egypt and describes how; "All Ethiopians (read Nubians/Kushites) I deported from Egypt, leaving not one left to do homage to me".[69] He installed native Egyptian princes throughout the land to rule on his behalf.[70] The conquest by Esarhaddon effectively marked the end of the short lived Kushite Empire.

[[Esarhaddon]] also completely rebuilt [[Babylon]] during his reign, bringing peace to Mesopotamia as a whole. The [[Babylonians]], [[Egyptians]], [[Elamites]], [[Cimmerians]], [[Scythians]], [[Persia]]ns, [[Medes]], [[Manneans]], [[Arameans]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Israelites]], [[Phoenicia]]ns and [[Urartu|Urartians]] were vanquished and regarded as vassals and Assyria's empire was kept secure.

He imposed a so-called ''Vassal Treaty'' upon his [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Median]] subjects, forcing [[Teispes]] of Persia and [[Deioces]] of Media to submit both to himself, and in advance to his chosen successor, Ashurbanipal.<ref>Grayson, Kirk A. (Autumn, 1987). "Akkadian Treaties of Seventh Century BC". Journal of Cuneiform Studies 39 (2): p.130.: ‚Äú... Esarhaddon imposes oaths to respect the right to succession of his two sons upon various peoples: the Medes in the Vassal Treaties and probably the people of Sippar in Text 3</ref>  Esarhaddon died whilst preparing to leave for Egypt to once more eject the [[Nubians]], who were attempting to encroach on the southern part of the country. This task was successfully completed by his successor, [[Ashurbanipal]].

Under [[Ashurbanipal]] (669‚Äì627 BC), Assyrian domination spanned from the [[Caucasus Mountains]] (modern [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]) in the north to [[Nubia]], [[Egypt]], [[Libya]] and [[Arabia]] in the south, and from the [[East Mediterranean]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Antioch]] in the west to [[Persia]] and the [[Caspian Sea]] in the east.

He was an unusually educated man for his time, being able to read and write in Akkadian, Aramaic and Sumerian, and having a proficient understanding of Astronomy and Mathematics, as well as military, civil and political aptitude. He built the famed [[Library of Ashurbanipal]] which contained a multitude of ancient texts from all over Mesopotamia, and was the first library in history to classify works in order of genre.
[[File:Susa-destruction.jpg|thumb|Ashurbanipal's brutal campaign against [[Elam]] in 647 BCE is recorded in this relief.]]

Ashurbanipal began his rule by fighting with a lot of difficulties the [[Nubia]]n/[[Kingdom of Kush|Cushite]] king [[Taharqa]], who had attempted to invade the southern part of Assyrian-controlled Egypt. [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] was sacked. Ashurbanipal then put down a series of rebellions by the native Egyptians themselves, installing [[Necho I]] as a puppet Pharaoh. However, in 664 BC, the new Nubian-Kushite king [[Tantamani]] once more attempted to invade Egypt, however he was savagely crushed, [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] was sacked and looted, and he fled to Nubia, bringing to an end, once and for all, Nubian designs on Egypt.

[[Phraortes]], the king of the [[Medes]] and Persians, also rebelled against Assyria, and attempted to attack Assyria itself in 653 BC, however he met with defeat at the hands of Ashurbanipal, and was killed. The succeeding Median kings, [[Madius]] and then [[Cyaxares the Great]], were both in turn subjugated by Ashurbanipal.

At around this time, [[Gyges of Lydia|Gyges]] king of [[Lydia]] in western Asia Minor, offered his submission to Ashurbanipal.

In 652 BC, just one year after his victory over Phraortes, his own brother [[Shamash-shum-ukin]], the Assyrian king of [[Babylon]] who had spent seventeen years peacefully subject to his sibling, became infused with Babylonian nationalism, declaring that Babylon and not Nineveh should be the seat of empire. Shamash-shum-ukin raised a powerful coalition of peoples resentful of being subject to Assyria, including- [[Babylonians]], [[Chaldean Dynasty|Chaldeans]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Arameans]], [[Suteans]], [[Arabs]], [[Elamites]], [[Scythians]], [[Cimmerians]], and even some [[Assyrians]]. War raged between the two brothers for five years, until in 648 BC, Babylon was sacked, and Shamash-shum-ukin slain. Ashurbanipal then wrought savage revenge, [[Elam]] was utterly destroyed, the Aramean, Chaldean, Sutean tribes were brutally punished, [[Arabia]]  was ravaged by the Assyrian army, and its rebellious shiekhs put to death. [[Cyrus I]] of [[Persia]] (grandfather of [[Cyrus the Great]]) was forced into submission, as a part of this defeated alliance.

Late in his reign, Ashurbanipal was forced to contend with renewed attempts on his empire by the [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]]. The Scythians were able to once more ravage Assyria's Median and Persian colonies in [[Ancient Iran]] before being finally subdued, and the last decade or so of his reign seems to have been peaceful.

He built vast libraries and initiated a surge in the building of temples and palaces. After the crushing of the Babylonian revolt, Ashurbanipal appeared master of all he surveyed. To the east, [[Elam]] was devastated and prostrate before Assyria, the [[Manneans]] and the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[Persia]]ns and Medes were vassals. To the south, [[Babylonia]] was occupied, the [[Chaldean people|Chaldeans]], [[Arabs]], [[Sutu, Iran|Sutu]] and [[Nabateans]] subjugated, the [[Nubia]]n empire destroyed, and [[Egypt]] paid tribute. To the north, the [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] had been vanquished and driven from Assyrian territory, [[Urartu]] ([[Armenia]]), [[Phrygia]], [[Corduene]] and the neo [[Hittites]] were in vassalage, and [[Lydia]] pleading for Assyrian protection. To the west, [[Aramea]] ([[Syria]]), the [[Phoenicians]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], [[Samarra]] and [[Cyprus]] were subjugated, and the [[Hellenised]] inhabitants of [[Caria]], [[Cilicia]], [[Cappadocia]] and [[Commagene]] paid tribute to Assyria.

Assyria conquered the [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt|25th dynasty Egypt]] (expelling its [[Nubian people|Nubian]]/[[Kushite]] dynasty) as well as [[Babylonia]], [[Chaldea]], [[Elam]], [[Median Empire|Media]], [[Persia]], [[Urartu]] ([[Armenia]]), [[Phoenicia]], [[Aramea]]/[[Syria]], [[Phrygia]], the [[Neo-Hittites|Neo-Hittite States]], the [[Hurrian|Hurrian lands]], [[Arabia]], [[Gutium]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], [[Samarra]], [[Moab]], [[Edom]], [[Corduene]], [[Cilicia]], [[Mannea]] and parts of [[Ancient Greece]] (such as [[Cyprus]]), and defeated and/or exacted tribute from [[Scythia]], [[Crimean Peninsula|Cimmeria]], [[Lydia]], [[Nubia]], [[Ethiopia]] and others.

At its height, the Empire encompassed the whole of the modern nations of [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Egypt]], [[Lebanon]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Cyprus]], together with large swathes of [[Iran]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Turkey]], [[Sudan]], [[Libya]], [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]].

Assyria now appeared stronger than ever. However, the long struggles pacifying the Babylonians, Chaldeans, Arameans and Elamites, the exertions undertaken in keeping the Medes, Scythians, Persians, Urartians and Cimmerians subjugated, and the constant campaigning over three centuries to control and expand its vast empire in all directions, had left Assyria exhausted.

It had been drained of wealth and manpower; the devastated provinces could yield nothing to supply the needs of the imperial exchequer, it was difficult to find sufficient troops to garrison and effectively control the huge empire, and after the death of Ashurbanipal severe civil unrest broke out in Assyria itself, and the empire began to unravel.

===Downfall, 626‚Äì605 BC===
The Assyrian Empire was severely crippled following the death of Ashurbanipal in 627 BC‚Äîthe nation and its empire descending into a prolonged and brutal series of civil wars involving three rival kings, [[Ashur-etil-ilani]], [[Sin-shumu-lishir]] and [[Sin-shar-ishkun]]. [[Egypt]]'s 26th Dynasty, which had been installed by the Assyrians as vassals, quietly detached itself from Assyria, although it was careful to retain friendly relations.

[[Ashur-etil-ilani]] came to the throne in 626 BC, and was immediately beset by a series of internal civil wars. He was deposed in 623 BC, after four years of bitter fighting by [[Sin-shumu-lishir]], an Assyrian ''Turtanu'' (General) who also occupied and claimed the throne of [[Babylon]] in that year. In turn, Sin-shumu-lishir was deposed as ruler of Assyria and Babylonia after a year of warfare by [[Sin-shar-ishkun]] (622‚Äì612 BC)‚Äîwho was then himself faced with constant violent rebellion in the Assyrian homeland.

This situation led to wholesale revolution in [[Babylonia]], and during the reign of [[Sin-shar-ishkun]] many Assyrian colonies to the west, east and north similarly took advantage and ceased to pay tribute to Assyria, most significantly the [[Medes]], [[Persia]]ns, [[Scythians]], [[Cimmerians]], [[Babylonians]], [[Chaldea]]ns and [[Arameans]].

The Scythians and Cimmerians took advantage of the bitter fighting among the Assyrians to raid Assyrian colonies, with hordes of horse borne marauders ravaging parts of [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]], where the vassal kings of [[Urartu]] and [[Lydia]] begged their Assyrian overlord for help in vain. They also raided the [[Levant]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] (where [[Ashkelon]] was sacked by the Scythians) and all the way into [[Egypt]] whose coasts were ravaged and looted with impunity.

The [[Iranic]] peoples (the [[Medes]], [[Persia]]ns and [[Parthians]]), aided by the previous Assyrian destruction of the hitherto dominant [[Elamites]] of [[Ancient Iran]], also took advantage of the upheavals in Assyria to coalesce into a powerful Median dominated force which destroyed the ''pre-Iranic'' Assyrian vassal kingdom of [[Mannea]] and absorbed the remnants of the pre-Iranic [[Elamites]] of southern Iran, and the equally pre-Iranic [[Gutians]], [[Manneans]] and [[Kassites]] of the [[Zagros Mountains]] and the [[Caspian Sea]].

In [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]] (modern [[Syria]]), [[Phoenicia]] and southern [[Canaan]] (modern [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Sinai]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]]), the various Aramean, Phoenician and Jewish states quietly reasserted their independence, and in western Asia Minor and eastern [[Mediterranean sea (oceanography)|Mediterranean]], the [[Lydians]], [[Greeks]], [[Cilicians]], [[Carians]], [[Cappadocia]]n and [[Luwian]] states did the same. [[Armenians]], [[Sarmatians]] and [[Colchians]] ([[Georgians]]) also began to establish themselves in parts of the Caucasus.

By 620 BC, [[Nabopolassar]], (a previously unknown ''Malka'' of the [[Chaldea]]n tribes who had settled the far southeast of [[Mesopotamia]] circa 900 BC) had claimed the city of Babylon and swathes of Babylonia in the confusion. Sin-shar-ishkun amassed a large army to eject Nabopolassar from Babylon; however, yet another massive revolt broke out in Assyria proper, forcing the bulk of his army to turn back, where they promptly joined the rebels in [[Nineveh]]. Similarly, Nabopolassar was unable to gain control over all of Babylonia, and could not make any inroads into Assyria despite its weakened state, being repelled at every attempt. The next four years saw bitter fighting in the heart of Babylonia itself, as the Assyrians tried to wrest back control.<ref name="Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq" />

However, in 615 BC Nabopolassar entered into an alliance with the Median king [[Cyaxares the Great]], a hitherto vassal of Assyria, who had taken advantage of the upheavals in Assyria to free the Iranian peoples from Assyrian vassalage and unite the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[Medes]], [[Persia]]ns and [[Parthians]], together with the remnants of the pre-Iranian [[Elamites]], [[Gutians]], [[Kassites]] and [[Manneans]], into a powerful Median-dominated force.

Mass alliances against Assyria were not a new phenomenon.  During the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365-1020 BC), peoples such as the [[Hittites]], [[Babylonians]], [[Mitanni]], [[Hurrians]], [[Elamites]], [[Phrygians]], [[Kassites]], [[Arameans]], [[Gutians]] and [[Canaanites]] had formed various coalitions at different times in vain attempts to break Assyrian power. During the [[Neo Assyrian Empire]], in the reigns of [[Shalmaneser III]] in the 9th century BC, [[Sargon II]] in the 8th century BC, and [[Sennacherib]] and [[Ashurbanipal]] in the earlier part of the 7th century BC, combined attempts to break Assyrian dominance by alliances including at different times; [[Babylonians]], [[Egyptians]], [[Greeks]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Elamites]], [[Nubians]], [[Medes]], [[Chaldean Dynasty|Chaldeans]], [[Phoenicians]], [[Canaanites]], [[Lydians]], [[Arameans]], [[Suteans]], [[Israelites]], [[Judean]]s, [[Scythians]], [[Cimmerians]], [[Manneans]], [[Urartians]], [[Cilicians]], [[Neo-Hittites]] and [[Arabs]] had all failed, Assyria being strong, well led and united, at the height of its power, and able to deal with any threat.

However the nation at this time was in a severely depleted state, ravaged by over a decade of internal civil war, disunity, instability, economic crisis and battle fatigue, and the forces ranged against it from all sides were to prove too much for the severely weakened Assyrians.

While Sin-shar-ishkun was fighting both the home grown rebels in Assyria and the Chaldeans and Babylonians in southern Mesopotamia, [[Cyaxares]] (technically a vassal of Assyria), in an alliance with the Scythians and Cimmerians, launched a surprise attack on a civil war bleaguered Assyria in 615 BC, sacking Kalhu (the Biblical Calah/Nimrud) and taking Arrapkha (modern Kirkuk). Nabopolassar, still pinned down in southern Mesopotamia, was completely uninvolved in this major breakthrough against Assyria.

However, from this point, the alliance of [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Babylonians]], [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] fought in unison against Assyria.

Despite the sorely depleted state of Assyria, bitter fighting ensued; throughout 614 BC the alliance of powers continued to gradually make hard fought inroads into Assyria itself, however in 613 BC the Assyrians somehow rallied against the odds and scored a number of counterattacking victories over the Medes-Persians, Babylonians-Chaldeans and Scythians-Cimmerians.

This led to the coalition of forces ranged against it to unite and launch a massive combined attack in 612 BC, finally besieging and entering Nineveh in late 612 BC, with Sin-shar-ishkun being slain in the bitter street by street fighting.

Despite the loss of almost all of its major cities, and in the face of overwhelming odds, Assyrian resistance continued. [[Ashur-uballit II]] (612- 605 BC) took the throne amid the street by street fighting in Nineveh, and refused a request to bow in vassalage to Nabopolassar, Cyaxares and their allies. He managed to break out of Nineveh and successfully fight his way to the northern Assyrian city of [[Harran]], he took the city and founded it as a new capital. Ashur-uballit II somehow managed to keep control of a now greatly reduced Assyria for five years or so, repelling attacks by his enemies. However, Harran too was eventually besieged and taken by the Medes, Babylonians and Scythians in 608 BC, with Ashur-uballit II once more managing to break free of the siege.

[[Egypt]], itself a former Assyrian colony whose current dynasty had been installed as puppet rulers by the Assyrians, then came to the aid of its former master, possibly in fear that without Assyrian protection it would be next to succumb, having already been ravaged by the Scythians.<ref name="Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq" />

[[Ashur-uballit II]] and [[Necho II|Necho]] of Egypt made a failed attempt to recapture Harran in 608 BC. The next three years saw the remnants of the Assyrian army and their Egyptian allies vainly attempting to eject the invaders from Assyria. In 605 BC, the Babylonians, Scythians and Medes-Persians defeated the Assyrians and Egyptians at [[Carchemish]].

Sections of the Assyrian army retreated to the western corner of Assyria after the fall of Harran and Carchemish, and a number of Assyrian imperial records survive between 604 BC and 599 BC in and around the Assyrian city of [[Dur-Katlimmu]] in what is today north eastern Syria, and so it is possible that remnants of the Assyrian administration and army still continued to hold out in the region for a few years.<ref>Ibid; also Assyria 1995: Proceedings of the 10th Anniversary Symposium of the Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project / Helsinki, September 7‚Äì11, 1995.</ref>

The fate of [[Ashur-uballit II]] remains unknown, his [[Limmu Lists]] end after the fall of Harran, and it is possible he was either killed at this time, at the battle of Carshemish in 605 BC, or continued to fight on, eventually simply disappearing into obscurity.

Certainly by 599 BC at the very latest, Assyria had been destroyed as an independent political entity, although it was to launch major rebellions against the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in 546 BC and 520 BC, and remained a [[geo-political]] region, ethnic entity and colonised province until the late 7th century AD, with small Assyrian states emerging in the region between the 2nd century BC and 4th century AD.

==Society==

===Middle Assyrian Period===
[[File:Assyrian troops return.png|thumb|Assyrian troops return after victory.]]
The Middle Assyrian Period was marked by the long wars fought that helped build Assyria into a [[warrior society]]. The king depended on both the citizen class and priests in his capital, and the landed nobility who supplied the horses needed by Assyria's military. Documents and letters illustrate the importance of the latter to Assyrian society.

Assyria needed less artificial [[irrigation]] than Babylon, and horse-breeding was extensive. Portions of elaborate texts about the care and training of them have been found. Trade was carried out in all directions. The mountain country to the north and west of Assyria was a major source of metal ore, as well as lumber. Economic factors were a common ''casus belli''.

===Law===
[[File:Flaying of rebels.jpg|thumb|Assyrians skinning or [[flaying]] their prisoners alive]]
All free male citizens were obliged to serve in the army for a time, a system which was called the ''ilku''-service. A [[legal code]] was produced during the 14th and 13th centuries which, among other things, clearly shows that the social position of women in Assyria was lower than that of neighbouring societies. Men were permitted to [[divorce]] their wives with no compensation paid to the latter. If a woman committed [[adultery]], she could be beaten or put to death. It's not certain if these laws were seriously enforced, but they appear to be a backlash against some older documents that granted things like equal compensation to both partners in divorce.

The women of the king's harem and their servants were also subject to harsh punishments, such as [[Strike (attack)|beatings]], [[mutilation]], and death. Assyria, in general, had much harsher laws than most of the region. [[Execution]]s were not uncommon, nor were whippings followed by forced labour. Some offenses allowed the accused a trial under torture/duress. One tablet that covers property rights has brutal penalties for violators. A creditor could force debtors to work for him, but not sell them.

Assyria, like much of Mesopotamia, was initially open to [[homosexual]] relationships between men. [[Male prostitute]]s and [[eunuch]]s could enjoy fame and influence.<ref name="Dynes">Homosexuality in the Ancient World, by Wayne R. Dynes, Taylor & Francis, 1992, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JrpU6O3VnawC&lpg=PP1&dq=Homosexuality%20in%20the%20Ancient%20World%20Dynes%20Donaldson&pg=PR8#v=onepage&q&f=false 8] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=JrpU6O3VnawC&lpg=PP1&dq=Homosexuality%20in%20the%20Ancient%20World%20Dynes%20Donaldson&pg=PA460#v=onepage&q&f=false 460]</ref>  In the Middle Assyrian Laws, [[sex crime]]s were punished identically whether they were homosexual or heterosexual.<ref name="Dynes" /><ref name="Nissinen">Homoeroticism in the Biblical World: A Historical Perspective, by Martti Nissinen, Fortress Press, 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-sHSNPG85tUC&lpg=PP1&dq=Homoeroticism%20in%20the%20Biblical%20World%20Nissinen&pg=PA24#v=onepage&q&f=false p.24-28]</ref> However, homosexual relationships between social equals, or those where a social better was [[Top, bottom and versatile|submissive or penetrated]], were treated as [[rape]].  However, an individual with a higher [[social class]] faced no punishment for penetrating someone of a lower social class, or devotees of Ishtar (whose [[gender role]]s were not considered solidly masculine). [[Omen]] texts referred to male homosexual acts without moral judgement or affirmation, though social distinctions determined whether the omen was considered beneficial or malevolent. In some ways, these omens conflicted with the law codes, though the law may have been enacted to curtail the omen's power.<ref name="Nissinen" /> One historian notes that the laws would not be so detailed "if homosexual behavior were not a familiar aspect of daily life of early Mesopotamia."<ref>The Origins and Role of Same-Sex Relations in Human Societies, by James Neill, McFarland, 27 Oct 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1ha9GgWNmy0C&lpg=PA83&dq=assyria%20homosexuality&pg=PA83#v=onepage&q&f=false p.83]</ref>

===Architecture===
Assyrian architecture, like that of Babylonia, was influenced by [[Sumero-Akkadian]] styles (and to some degree Mitanni), but early on developed its own distinctive style. Palaces sported colourful wall decorations, and seal-cutting (an art learned from Mittani) developed apace. Schools for scribes taught both the Babylonian and Assyrian dialects of [[Akkadian]], and [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] and [[Akkadian]] literary works were often copied with an Assyrian flavour.

The Assyrian dialect of Akkadian was used in legal, official, religious, and practical texts such as medicine or instructions on manufacturing items. During the 13th to 10th centuries, picture tales appeared as a new art form: a continuous series of images carved on square stone steles. Somewhat reminiscent of a comic book, these show events such as warfare or hunting, placed in order from the upper left to the lower right corner of the stele with captions written underneath them. These and the excellent cut seals show that Assyrian art was beginning to surpass that of Babylon. Architecture saw the introduction of a new style of [[ziggurat]], with two towers and colorful enameled tiles.

==Assyria after the empire==
{{see also|Achaemenid Assyria}}

===Achaemenid Assyria, Athura, Assuristan, Assyria province, Adiabene, Osroene and Hatra===
Assyria was initially ruled by the short lived [[Median Empire]] (605-549 BC) after its fall. In a twist of fate, [[Nabonidus]] the last king of Babylon (together with his son and co-regent [[Belshazzar]]) was himself an Assyrian from [[Harran]]. He had overthrown the short lived [[Chaldea]]n dynasty in Babylonia, after which the Chaldeans disappeared from history, being fully absorbed into the native population of Babylonia. However, apart from plans to dedicate religious temples in the city of Harran, Nabonidus showed little interest in rebuilding Assyria. [[Nineveh]] and [[Kalhu]] remained in ruins with only small numbers of Assyrians living within them, conversely a number of towns and cities such as [[Arrapkha]], [[Guzana]], [[Nohadra]] and [[Harran]] remained intact, and [[Assur]] and [[Arbil|Arbela]] ([[Irbil]]) were not completely destroyed, as is attested by their later revival. However, Assyria spent much of this short period in a degree of devastation following its fall.

====[[Achaemenid Assyria]] (549‚Äì330 BC)====
After the Medes were overthrown by the [[Persian people|Persians]] as the dominant force in Ancient Iran, Assyria was ruled by the [[Persia]]n [[Achaemenid Empire]] (as [[Athura]]) from 549 BC to 330 BC (see [[Achaemenid Assyria]]). Between 546 and 545 BC, Assyria rebelled against the new Persian Dynasty, which had usurped the previous Median dynasty. The rebellion centered around [[Tyareh]] was eventually quashed by [[Cyrus the Great]].

Assyria seems to have recovered dramatically, and flourished during this period. It became a major agricultural and administrative centre of the Achaemenid Empire, and its soldiers were a mainstay of the Persian Army.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nineveh.com/Assyrians%20after%20Assyria.html |title=Assyrians after Assyria|publisher=Nineveh.com |date=4 September 1999 |accessdate=19 June 2011| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20110714183623/http://www.nineveh.com/Assyrians%20after%20Assyria.html| archivedate= 14 July 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In fact, Assyria even became powerful enough to raise another full-scale revolt against the Persian empire in 520‚Äì519 BC.

The Persians had spent centuries under Assyrian domination (their first ruler [[Achaemenes]] and his successors, having been vassals of Assyria), and Assyrian influence can be seen in Achaemenid art, infrastructure and administration. Early Persian rulers saw themselves as successors to [[Ashurbanipal]], and [[Mesopotamian]] [[Aramaic]] was retained as the ''lingua franca'' of the empire for over two hundred years.<ref>Van de Mieroop, ''History'', p. 293.</ref> [[Nineveh]] was never rebuilt however, and 200 years after it was sacked [[Xenophon]] reported only small numbers of Assyrians living amongst its ruins. Conversely the ancient city of [[Assur]] once more became a rich and prosperous entity.<ref>Curtis, John (November 2003). "The Achaemenid Period in Northern Iraq". L‚Äôarch√©ologie de l‚Äôempire ach√©m√©nide (Paris, France): 12.</ref>

It was in 5th century BC Assyria that the [[Syriac language]] and [[Syriac script]] evolved. Five centuries later these were later to have a global influence as the liturgical language and written script for [[Syriac Christianity]] and its accompanying [[Syriac literature]] which also emerged in Assyria before spreading throughout the Near East, Asia Minor, The Caucasus, Central Asia, the Indian Subcontinent and China.

====Macedonian and Seleucid Assyria====
In 332 BC, Assyria fell to [[Alexander the Great]], the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] Emperor from [[Greece]], who called the inhabitants ''Assyrioi''. The [[Macedonian Empire]] (332-312) was partitioned in 312 BC. It thereafter became part of the [[Seleucid Empire]] (312 BC) and was renamed [[Syria]], a [[Hurrian]], [[Luwian]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] corruption of '''Assyria''', a term which for many centuries until the Seleucid era had only and specifically meant and referred to Assyria and the Assyrians, and not to [[The Levant]] and its largely Aramean, Phoenician and Neo-Hittite inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/articles/ttaasa.pdf |title=The Terms "Assyria" and "Syria" Again|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=19 June 2011| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20110613170304/http://www.aina.org/articles/ttaasa.pdf| archivedate= 13 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> It is from this period that the later [[Name of Syria|''Syria'' Vs ''Assyria'' naming controversy arises]], the Seleucids applied the name not only to Assyria itself, but also to the Levantine lands to the west (historically known as [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]] modern [[Syria]]/[[Eber Nari]]), which had been part of the Assyrian empire but never a part of Assyria.

When they lost control of Assyria, the name ''Syria'' survived but was erroneously applied only to the land of [[Aramea]] (also known as [[Eber Nari]]) to the west that had once been part of the Assyrian empire, but apart from the north eastern corner, had never been a part of Assyria itself, nor inhabited by Assyrians. This was to lead to both the Assyrians from Northern Mesopotamia and the Arameans and Phoenicians from the Levant being collectively dubbed '''Syrians''' (and later also '''Syriacs''') in [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] culture, regardless of ethnicity, history or geography.

During Seleucid rule, Assyrians ceased to hold the senior military and civil positions they had enjoyed under the Achaemenids, being largely replaced by Greeks. The Greek language also replaced Mesopotamian East Aramaic as the lingua franca of the empire, although this did not affect the Assyrian population themselves, who were not Hellenised during the Seleucid era.

During the Seleucid period in southern Mesopotamia, [[Babylon]] was gradually abandoned in favour of a new city named [[Dura Seleucus]], effectively bringing an end to ''Babylonia''.

====Parthian Assyria (150 BC ‚Äì 116 AD); [[Adiabene]] (69 BC ‚Äì 117 AD)====
By 150 BC, Assyria was largely under the control of the [[Parthian Empire]], once more as [[Athura]] (the Mesopotamian East Aramaic word for Assyria). The Parthians seem to have exercised only loose control over Assyria. Temples to the native gods of Assyria were resurrected in many towns and cities. A number of independent [[Neo-Assyrian]] states arose, the most notable being [[Adiabene]] (69 BC - 117 AD). Adiabene was described by historian [[Georges Roux]] as a virtual resurrection of Assyria.

The Assyrians began to convert to [[Christianity]] from [[Mesopotamian religion]] ([[Ashurism]]) during the period between the early 1st and 3rd centuries AD, with the founding of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]].

====Roman Assyria (116 AD ‚Äì 118 AD)====
However, in 116 AD, under [[Trajan]], Assyria and its independent states were taken over by Rome as the [[Assyria (Roman province)|Roman Province of Assyria]]. The Assyrian kingdom of [[Adiabene]] was destroyed as an independent state during this period. Roman rule lasted only a few years, and the Parthians once more regained control with the help of the Assyrians, who were incited to overthrow the Roman garrisons by the Parthian king.
However, a number of Assyrians were conscripted into the [[Roman Army]], with many serving in the region of [[Hadrians Wall]] in [[Ancient Britain]], and inscriptions in Aramaic made by [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] and [[Aramean]] soldiers have been discovered in northern [[England]] dating from the 2nd century AD.<ref>http://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2009/oct/13/hadrians-wall</ref>

====Parthian Assyria restored (119 AD ‚Äì 225 AD), [[Osroene]], [[Hatra]]====
[[Roman Empire|Romans]] and [[Parthians]] fought over Assyria and the rest of Mesopotamia for the next century, allowing a number of other Neo-Assyrian states to arise, namely [[Osroene]] (132 BC to AD 244) and [[Hatra]] (155‚Äì241 AD). Osroene became the first [[Christian]] state in history, and a major center of [[Syriac literature]] and [[Syriac Christianity]].

In addition, the ancient capital city of [[Ashur]] again flourished, and appears to have gained independence during the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. Temples to the Assyrian national gods [[Ashur]], [[Sin]], [[Hadad]], [[Ishtar]] and [[Shamash]] were once more dedicated throughout Assyria during this period. The noted Assyriologist [[Simo Parpola]] has speculated that Assyria may well have once again been fully independent for a while.

====Sassanid Assyria ([[Assuristan]] (226 AD ‚Äì circa 650 AD)====
In 226 AD, Assyria was largely taken over by the [[Sassanid Empire]]. After driving out the Romans and Parthians, the Sassanid rulers set about destroying the independent states within Assyria; Hatra was dissolved in 241 AD, Osroene in 244 AD and Assur was sacked by [[Shapur I]] in 256 AD.

It was known as [[Asuristan]] (the Sassanid name for Assyria) during this period, and became the birthplace of the [[Church of the East]] (now split into the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and [[Chaldean Catholic Church]]), with a flourishing [[Syriac]] ([[Assyrian people|Assyrian]]) Christian culture which exists there to this day. Temples were still being dedicated to the national god [[Ashur]] in his home city and in [[Harran]] during the 4th century, indicating an Assyrian identity was still strong.

During the Sassanid period, much of what had once been [[Babylonia]] in southern Mesopotamia was incorporated into Assyria.

Parts of Assyria appear to have been semi independent as late as the latter part of the 4th century AD, with a king named [[Sennacherib II]] ruling the northern reaches in 370s AD.

Centuries of constant warfare between the [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[Sassanid Empire]] left both empires exhausted, depleted and battle-fatigued, allowing the Muslim Arabs to break from the [[Arabian peninsula]] and invade territories hitherto held by these empires. After the [[Arab]] [[Islamic]] conquest in the 7th century, Assyria was dissolved as an entity, although the native Assyrian population still regarded the region as [[Athura]], an appellation which survived until the 19th century AD. Under Arab rule, Mesopotamia as a whole underwent a gradual process of [[Arabisation]] and [[Islamification]], and the region saw a gradual large influx of ''non indigenous'' [[Arab people|Arabs]], [[Kurds]], [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], and [[Turkic peoples]]. However, the indigenous [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] population of northern Mesopotamia (known as [[Ashuriyun]] by the Arabs) resisted this process, retaining their language, religion, culture and identity.

The previously basic civilisation of the desert dwelling Arabs was greatly enhanced and enriched by the influence and knowledge of native Mesopotamian scientists, physicians, mathematicians, theologians, astronomers, architects, agriculturalists, artists and astrologers.

Under the Arab Islamic empires, the Assyrians being Christians were classed as ''[[dhimmis]]'', a kind of second-class citizens who had certain restrictions imposed upon them however had their rights fully protected and were granted freedom in some matters. They were excluded from specific duties and occupations reserved for Muslims, did not enjoy the same political rights as Muslims, their word was not equal to that of a Muslim in legal and civil matters without a Muslim witness, as Christians they were subject to payment of a special tax ([[jizyah]]), they were banned from spreading their religion further in Muslim ruled lands, men were banned from marrying Muslim women, but at the same time they were also expected to adhere to the same laws of property, contract and obligation as the Muslim Arabs. They were however also allowed freedom in other matters. Personal matters such as marriage and divorce were governed by the personal law of Assyrians, the internal discipline was ensured by religious leaders who were answerable to the Muslims, they were allowed the consumption of alcohol, were punished equally for a crime as the Muslims and had protection from any aggression.<ref>H.

Although predominantly Christian, a minority of Assyrians still held onto their ancient Mesopotamian religion until as late as the 10th century AD.<ref name="nineveh.com">http://www.nineveh.com/parpola_eng.pdf</ref>

Assyrian people, still retaining [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] infused and influenced [[Eastern Aramaic]] and [[Assyrian Church of the East]] [[Christianity]], remained dominant in the north of Mesopotamia (what had been Assyria) as late as the 14th century AD<ref>According to Georges Roux and Simo Parpola</ref> and the city of [[Assur]] was still occupied by Assyrians during the Islamic period until the mid-14th century when the [[Muslim]] Turco-Mongol ruler [[Tamurlane]] conducted a religiously motivated massacre of indigenous [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] [[Christians]]. After that, there are no traces of a settlement at Ashur in the archaeological and numismatic record, and from this point the Assyrian population was dramatically reduced in their homeland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assur.de/Themen/Stadtgeschichte_Engl/body_stadtgeschichte_engl.html |title=History of Ashur |publisher=Assur.de |date= |accessdate=12 June 2012}}</ref>

A religious [[schism]] among the Assyrians of northern Mesopotamia emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries AD, when a large number of hitherto [[Assyrian Church of the East]] Assyrians from the far north of Mesopotamia entered communion with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] after becoming dissatisfied with the [[Abuna]] family's leadership of the Assyrian Church, and after at first failing to gain acceptance within the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]]. Rome named this new church ''The Church of Assyria and Mosul'' and its first leader ''Patriarch of the East Assyrians'' in 1553 AD. However, in 1683 AD, Rome altered the name to the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], this group of Assyrians eventually became known as [[Chaldean Catholics]] or [[Chaldo-Assyrians]] despite having no ethnic, historical, linguistic or geographic connections whatsoever to the long extinct Chaldean tribe of south east Mesopotamia.

The Assyrians suffered a number of religiously and ethnically motivated massacres throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries AD,<ref>Aboona, H (2008). Assyrians and Ottomans: intercommunal relations on the periphery of the Ottoman Empire. Cambria Press. pp. 218‚Äì219. ISBN 978-1-60497-583-3.</ref> culminating in the large scale [[Hamidian massacres]] of unarmed men, women and children by [[Muslim]] [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Kurds]] in the late 19th century at the hands of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its associated (largely [[Kurds|Kurdish]] and [[Arab]]) militias, which further greatly reduced numbers, particularly in southeastern Turkey.

[[File:Burning of Assyrians.jpg|thumb|The burning of bodies of Christian Assyrian women]]
The Assyrians suffered a further catastrophic series of events during [[World War I]] in the form of the religiously and ethnically motivated [[Assyrian Genocide]] at the hands of the [[Ottomans]] and their [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] and [[Arab]] allies from 1915‚Äì1918.<ref>Ak√ßam, Taner (2012).

Genocide Studies and Prevention, Vol. 1, No. 3, December 2006.</ref>  Some sources claim  that the highest number of Assyrians killed during the period was 750,000, while a 1922 Assyrian assessment set it at 275,000. The Assyrian Genocide ran largely in conjunction to the similarly motivated [[Armenian Genocide]] and [[Greek Genocide]]. In reaction against Turkish cruelty, Assyrians took up arms, and an [[Assyrian war of independence]] was fought during [[World War I]]. For a time, the Assyrians fought successfully against overwhelming numbers, scoring a number of victories over the Ottomans and Kurds, and also hostile Arab and Iranian groups; then their [[Russia]]n allies left the war following the [[Russian Revolution]], and [[Armenia]]n resistance broke. The Assyrians were left cut off, surrounded, and without supplies, forcing those in Asia Minor and Northwest Iran to fight their way, with civilians in tow, to the safety of [[United Kingdom|British]] lines and their fellow Assyrians in northern Iraq. The sizeable Assyrian presence in south eastern Anatolia which had endured for over four millennia was thus reduced to no more than 15,000 by the end of World War I.

The [[Assyrian Levies]] were founded by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in 1928, with ancient Assyrian military rankings, such as [[Rab-shakeh]], [[Rab-talia]] and Tartan, being revived for the first time in millennia for this force. The Assyrians were prized by the British rulers for their fighting qualities, loyalty, bravery and discipline, and were used to help the British put down insurrections among the Arabs and Kurds, guard the borders with Iran and Turkey and protect British military installations.<ref>[[Len Deighton]] (1993), ''[[Blood, Tears and Folly]]''</ref>

After Iraq was granted independence by the British in 1933, the Assyrians suffered the [[Simele Massacre]], where thousands of unarmed villagers (men, women and children) were slaughtered by joint Arab-Kurdish forces of the Iraqi Army. These massacres followed a clash between Assyrian tribesmen and the Iraqi army, where the Iraqi forces suffered a defeat after trying to disarm the Assyrians, whom they feared would attempt to secede from Iraq. Armed Assyrian Levies were prevented by the British from going to the aid of these civilians.

The Assyrians were allied with the British during [[World War II]], with eleven Assyrian companies seeing action in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]/[[Israel]] and another four serving in [[Cyprus]]. The Parachute Company was attached to the Royal Marine Commando and was involved in fighting in [[Albania]], [[Italy]] and [[Greece]]. Assyrians played a major role in the victory over Arab-Iraqi forces at the [[Battle of Habbaniya]] in 1941, when the Iraqi government decided to join WW2 on the side of [[Nazi Germany]]. The British presence in Iraq lasted until 1955, and Assyrian Levies remained attached to British forces until this time.

The period from the 1940s through to 1963 saw a period of respite for the Assyrians. The regime of President Kassim in particular saw the Assyrians accepted into mainstream society. Many urban Assyrians became successful businessmen, others were well represented in politics and the military, their towns and villages flourished undisturbed, and Assyrians came to excel, and be over represented in sports such as Boxing, Football, Athletics, Wrestling and Swimming.
[[File:Assyrian wedding, Mechelen.jpg|thumb|180px|Assyrian wedding, diaspora in Belgium]]

However, in 1963, the [[Ba'ath Party]] took power by force in Iraq. The Baathists, though secular, were [[Arab Nationalists]], and set about attempting to ''Arabize'' the many non Arab peoples of Iraq, including the Assyrians. Other ethnic groups targeted for forced ''Arabization'' included [[Kurds]], [[Armenians]], [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turcomans]], [[Mandeans]], [[Yezidi]], [[Shabaki]], [[Kawliya]], [[Persian people|Persians]] and [[Circassians]]. This policy included refusing to acknowledge the Assyrians as an ethnic group, banning the publication of written material in Eastern Aramaic, and banning its teaching in schools, banning parents giving Assyrian names to their children, banning Assyrian political parties, taking control of Assyrian churches, attempting to divide Assyrians on denominational lines (e.g. Assyrian Church of the East vs Chaldean Catholic Church vs Syriac Orthodox) and forced relocations of Assyrians from their traditional homelands to major cities.

In response to Baathist persecution, the Assyrians of the [[Zowaa]] movement within the [[Assyrian Democratic Movement]] took up armed struggle against the Iraqi regime in 1982 under the leadership of [[Yonadam Kanna]],<ref>http://www.zowaa.org/</ref> and then joined up with the [[Iraqi-Kurdistan Front|IKF]] in early 1990s. Yonadam Kanna in particular was a target of the [[Saddam Hussein]] Ba'ath regime for many years.

The policies of the Bathists have also long been mirrored in Turkey, whose governments have refused to acknowledge the Assyrians as an ethnic group since the 1920s, and have attempted to ''Turkify'' the Assyrians by calling them ''Semitic Turks'' and forcing them to adopt Turkic names. In Syria too, the Assyrian/Syriac Christians have faced pressure to identify as ''Arab Christians''.

Many persecutions have befallen the Assyrians since, such as the [[Anfal]] campaign and [[Baathist]], Arab and Kurdish nationalist and [[Islamist]] persecutions.

In recent years, the Assyrians in northern Iraq and north east Syria have become the target of extreme unprovoked [[Islamic terrorism]]. As a result, Assyrians have taken up arms, alongside other groups (such as the Kurds, Turcomans and Armenians) in response to unprovoked attacks by [[Al Qaeda]], [[ISIS]]/[[ISIL]], [[Nusra Front]] and other [[terrorist]] [[Islamic Fundamentalist]] groups. In 2014 Islamic terrorists of ISIS attacked Assyrian towns and villages in the [[Assyrian Homeland]] of northern Iraq, together with cities such as [[Mosul]] and [[Kirkuk]] which have large Assyrian populations. There have been reports of atrocities committed by ISIS terrorists since, including; beheadings, crucifixions, child murders, rape, forced conversions, [[Ethnic Cleansing]], robbery, and extortion in the form of illegal taxes levied upon non Muslims. Assyrians in Iraq have responded by forming armed militias to defend their territories.

Thus far, the only people who have been attested with a high level of genetic, historical, linguistic and cultural research to be the descendants of the ancient Mesopotamians are the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] [[Christians]] of [[Iraq]] and its surrounding areas in north west [[Iran]], north east [[Syria]] and south eastern [[Turkey]] (see [[Assyrian continuity]]), although others have made unsubstantiated claims of continuity. Assyria continued to exist as a geopolitical entity until the Arab-Islamic conquest in the mid-7th century, and Assyrian identity, personal, family and tribal names, and both spoken and written evolutions of [[Mesopotamian]] [[Aramaic]] (which still contain many [[Akkadian]] loan words and an Akkadian grammatical structure) have survived among the Assyrian people from ancient times to this day. (see [[Assyrian people]]).

==Assyrian religion==
The Assyrians, like the rest of the Mesopotamian peoples, followed the [[Sumero-Akkadian]] [[Mesopotamian Religion]], with the national god [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]] having pride of place at the head of the pantheon. This religion survived in Assyria from c. 3500 BC through to its gradual decline in the face of Christianity between the 1st and 10th centuries AD.<ref name="nineveh.com"/>

Other major gods within the pantheon were [[Anu]], [[Baal]], [[Ea (Babylonian god)|Ea]], [[Enlil]], [[Ishtar]] ([[Astarte]]), [[Shamash]], [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]], [[Adad]]/[[Hadad]], [[Sin (mythology)|Sin (Nanna)]], [[Dagon|Dagan]], [[Ninurta]], [[Nisroch]], [[Nergal]], [[Tiamat]], [[Ninlil]], [[Mullissu]], [[Zababa]] and [[El (deity)|El]].

Native religion was still strongly followed at least until the 4th century AD, and survived in pockets until at least the 10th century AD,<ref name="nineveh.com"/> although Assyrians had begun to adopt [[East Syrian Rite|Eastern Rite]] [[Christianity]] (as well as for a time [[Manicheanism]] and [[Gnosticism]]) which, like [[Syriac]] literature, had its birthplace in Assyria between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD. Assyrians today are exclusively [[Christian]], with most following the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], [[Ancient Church of the East]] and [[Syriac Orthodox]] churches.

==Language==
During the 3rd millennium BC, a very intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the [[Sumer]]ians and the [[Akkadian language|Akkad]]ians, which included widespread [[wikt:bilingualism|bilingualism]].<ref name='Deutscher'>{{cite book|title=Syntactic Change in Akkadian: The Evolution of Sentential Complementation|author=Deutscher, Guy|authorlink=Guy Deutscher (linguist)|publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Oxford University Press US]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-19-953222-3|pages=20‚Äì21|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XFwUxmCdG94C}}</ref> The influence of [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] on [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence.<ref name='Deutscher'/> This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the 3rd millennium BC as a ''[[sprachbund]]''.<ref name='Deutscher'/>

[[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of Mesopotamia somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate),<ref name="woods"/> but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary and scientific language in Mesopotamia until the 1st century AD.

In ancient times, Assyrians spoke a dialect of the [[Akkadian language]], an eastern branch of the [[Semitic languages]]. The first inscriptions, called Old Assyrian (OA), were made in the Old Assyrian period.<ref>Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', p. 188</ref> In the Neo-Assyrian period the [[Aramaic language]] became increasingly common,<ref>Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', p. 308</ref> more so than [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]‚Äîthis was thought to be largely due to the mass deportations undertaken by Assyrian kings,<ref name="Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq p382">Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', p. 382</ref> in which large Aramaic-speaking populations, conquered by the Assyrians, were relocated to Assyria and interbred with the Assyrians. The ancient Assyrians also used the [[Sumerian language]] in their literature and liturgy,<ref name="Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq p382"/> although to a more limited extent in the Middle- and Neo-Assyrian periods, when Akkadian became the main literary language.<ref name="Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq p382"/>

The destruction of the Assyrian capitals of Nineveh and Assur by the Babylonians, Medes and their allies, ensured that much of the bilingual elite (but not all) were wiped out. By the 7th century BC, much of the Assyrian population used Akkadian influenced Eastern Aramaic and not Akkadian itself. The last Akkadian inscriptions in Mesopotamia date from the 1st century AD. However, Eastern Aramaic dialects, as well as Akkadian and Mesopotamian Aramaic personal and family names, still survive to this day among [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] in the regions of northern [[Iraq]], southeast [[Turkey]], northwest [[Iran]] and northeast [[Syria]] that constituted old Assyria.<ref name="Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq p382"/>

After 90 years of effort, the [[University of Chicago]] has published an Assyrian Dictionary, whose form is more [[encyclopedia]] in style than [[dictionary]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110604/ap_on_re_us/us_postcard_the90_year_dictionary_project |title=Ancient world dictionary finished‚Äîafter 90 years|agency= Associated Press |publisher=News.yahoo.com |date=4 June 2011 |accessdate=19 June 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Transport of cedar Dur Sharrukin.jpg|thumb|Relief from Assyrian capital of [[Dur Sharrukin]], showing transport of Lebanese cedar (8th century BC)]]
Assyrian art preserved to the present day predominantly dates to the Neo-Assyrian period. Art depicting battle scenes, and occasionally the impaling of whole villages in gory detail, was intended to show the power of the emperor, and was generally made for propaganda purposes. These stone reliefs lined the walls in the royal palaces where foreigners were received by the king. Other stone reliefs depict the king with different deities and conducting religious ceremonies. Many stone reliefs were discovered in the royal palaces at [[Nimrud]] (Kalhu) and [[Khorsabad]] (Dur-Sharrukin). A rare discovery of metal plates belonging to wooden doors was made at [[Balawat]] ([[Imgur-Enlil]]).

[[File:S03 06 01 017 image 2350.jpg|thumbnail|Assyria. Head of winged bull, 9th c. B.C.; Brooklyn Museum Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]
Assyrian sculpture reached a high level of refinement in the Neo-Assyrian period. One prominent example is the winged bull ''Lamassu'', or [[shedu]] that guard the entrances to the king's court. These were apotropaic meaning they were intended to ward off evil. C. W. Ceram states in ''The March of Archaeology'' that ''lamassi'' were typically sculpted with five legs so that four legs were always visible, whether the image were viewed frontally or in profile.

Although works of precious gems and metals usually do not survive the ravages of time, some fine pieces of Assyrian jewelry were found in royal tombs at Nimrud.

There is ongoing discussion among academics over the nature of the [[Nimrud lens]], a piece of [[quartz]] unearthed by [[Austen Henry Layard]] in 1850, in the Nimrud palace complex in northern [[Iraq]]. A small minority believe that it is evidence for the existence of ancient Assyrian telescopes, which could explain the great accuracy of [[Assyrian astronomy]]. Other suggestions include its use as a magnifying glass for jewellers, or as a decorative furniture inlay. The Nimrud Lens is held in the British Museum.<ref name = "Mu≈øeum">[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=369215&partid=1 Lens], British Museum.</ref>

The Assyrians were also innovative in military technology, with the use of heavy cavalry, sappers, siege engines etc.

==Legacy==
{{main|Achaemenid Assyria|Assyriology|Assyrianism}}
[[File:Layard Nineveh.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Austen Henry Layard]] in Nineveh, 1852]]
[[Achaemenid]] Assyria (539‚Äì330 BC) retained a separate identity ([[Athura]]), official correspondence being in [[Imperial Aramaic]], and there was even a determined revolt of the two Assyrian provinces of Mada and Athura in 520 BC. Under [[Seleucid]] rule (330 BC ‚Äì approximately 150 BC), however, [[Aramaic]] gave way to [[Greek language|Greek]] as the official administrative language. Aramaic was marginalised as an official language, but remained spoken in both Assyria and Babylonia by the general populace. It also remained the spoken tongue of the indigenous Assyrian/Babylonian citizens of all Mesopotamia under Persian, Greek and Roman rule, and indeed well into the [[Arab]] period it was still the language of the majority, particularly in the north of Mesopotamia, surviving to this day among the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] Christians.

Between 150 BC and 226 AD, Assyria changed hands between the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] Iranians and Romans ([[Assyria (Roman province)|Roman Province of Assyria]]) until coming under the rule of [[Sassanid]] Persia in 226‚Äì651 AD, where it was known as [[Asuristan]].

A number of at least partly neo-Assyrian kingdoms existed in the area between in the late classical and early Christian period also; [[Adiabene]], [[Hatra]] and [[Osroene]].

[[Mesopotamia in Classical literature|Classical historiographers]] and Biblical writers had only retained a fragmented, very dim and often inaccurate picture of Assyria. It was remembered that there had been an Assyrian empire predating the Persian one, but all particulars were lost. Thus Jerome's ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' lists 36 kings of the Assyrians, beginning with [[Ninus]], son of [[Belus (Assyrian)|Belus]], down to [[Sardanapalus]], the last king of the Assyrians before the empire fell to [[Arbaces]] the Median. Almost none of these have been substantiated as historical, with the exception of the Neo-Assyrian and Babylonian rulers listed in [[Ptolemy's Canon]], beginning with [[Nabonassar]].

Mesopotamian empires such as the Akkadian Empire, Babylonian Empire, Middle Assyrian Empire, Neo Assyrian Empire and Neo Babylonian Empire asserted Mesopotamian dominance from the [[Caucasus Mountains]] to [[Arabia]] and [[Egypt]], and from [[Cyprus]] and the east [[Mediterranean]] to [[Persia]]. Thus the influence exerted by the Babylonian-Assyrian religion was particularly profound on other [[Semites]], including the [[Hebrews]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Canaanites]], [[Arameans]], [[Phoenicians]] and [[Arabs]], while their astral theology affected the ancient world in general, including the [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Greeks]], [[Armenians]] and the later [[Roman Empire|Romans]]. The impetus to the purification of the old [[Semitic]] [[polytheistic religions]] to which the [[Hebrews]] for a long time clung in common with their fellows‚Äîthe various branches of nomadic [[Arameans]] and [[Arabs]]‚Äîwas largely furnished by the remarkable civilization unfolded in the Euphrates valley and in many of the traditions, myths and legends embodied in the Old Testament; traces of direct adaptation from and responses to Babylonia and Assyria may be discerned, while the indirect influences in the domain of the prophetical books, as also in the [[Psalms]] and in the so-called "wisdom literature", are even more noteworthy. Stories in the [[Tanakh]], [[Old Testament]] and [[Quran]] such as; the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] [[creation narrative]], [[Tower of Babel]], [[The Great Flood]] and the book of [[Esther]], as well as various biblical characters such as [[Noah]], [[Nimrod]], [[Lilith]] and [[Asnapper]] bear clear influence from Assyria and Babylonia.<ref>Julian Jaynes (2000). The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind. Mariner Books. Retrieved 2013-06-16</ref><ref>Georges Contenau La Magie chez les Assyriens et les Babyloniens, Paris, 1947</ref><ref>Harris, Stephen L. (2002). Understanding the Bible. McGraw-Hill. pp. 50‚Äì51.ISBN 9780767429160</ref>

Even when we reach the [[New Testament]] period, we have not passed entirely beyond the sphere of Babylonian-Assyrian influences. In such a movement as early [[Christian]] [[gnosticism]], Assyrio-Babylonian elements‚Äîmodified, to be sure, and transformed‚Äîare largely present, while the growth of an apocalyptic literature is ascribed with apparent justice by many scholars to the recrudescence of views, the ultimate source of which is to be found in the astral-theology of the Babylonian and Assyrian Priests.

The Assyrians began to form and adopt a distinct [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Rite]] [[Christianity]], with its accompanying [[Syriac literature]], between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD, however native religion was still alive and well into the 4th century AD, and pockets survived into the 10th century AD and possibly as late as the 17th century in Mardin. However, the religion is now dead, and the indigenous Assyrian (a.k.a. Chaldo-Assyrian) people, though still retaining Eastern Aramaic dialects as a mother tongue, are now wholly Christian.

The [[modern discovery of Babylonia and Assyria]] begins with excavations in [[Nineveh]] in 1845, which revealed the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]]. Decipherment of [[cuneiform]] was a formidable task that took more than a decade; but, by 1857, the [[Royal Asiatic Society]] was convinced that reliable reading of cuneiform texts was possible. [[Assyriology]] has since pieced together the formerly largely forgotten history of Mesopotamia. In the wake of the archaeological and philological [[rediscovery of ancient Assyria]], [[Assyrian nationalism]] became increasingly popular among the surviving remnants of the [[Assyrian people]], and has come to strongly identify with ancient Assyria.
