'''Evolutionary linguistics''' is the [[scientific]] study of the psychosocial development and [[cultural evolution]] of individual languages as well as the [[origin of language|origins and development of human language]] itself.<ref name="Croft 2008">{{cite journal | last = Croft | first = William |date=October 2008 | title = Evolutionary Linguistics | journal = Annual Review of Anthropology | volume = 37 | pages = 219–234 | publisher = Annual Reviews | doi = 10.1146/annurev.anthro.37.081407.085156 | url = http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.anthro.37.081407.085156}}</ref> The main challenge in this research is the lack of empirical data: spoken [[language]] leaves practically no traces. This led to an abandonment of the field for more than a century. Since the late 1980s, the field has been revived in the wake of progress made in the related fields of [[psycholinguistics]], [[neurolinguistics]], [[evolutionary anthropology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[universal grammar]],and [[cognitive science]].

==History==
Inspired by the natural sciences, especially by [[biology]], [[August Schleicher]] (1821–1868) became the first to compare changing languages to evolving [[species]].<ref>Taub, Liba. ''Evolutionary Ideas and "Empirical" Methods: The Analogy Between Language and Species in the Works of Lyell and Schleicher.'' British Journal for the History of Science 26, pages 171–193 (1993)</ref> He introduced the representation of language families as an evolutionary tree (''Stammbaumtheorie'') in articles published in 1853.<ref>{{Cite web  | last = Schleicher| first =  August | title = Darwinism tested by the science of language : Free Download  | url = https://archive.org/details/darwinismtestedb69schl | publisher = Internet Archive  | date = 1869 | accessdate = 11 December 2013 }}</ref> ''Stammbaumtheorie'' proved very productive for [[comparative linguistics]], but did not solve the major problem of studying the [[origin of language]]: the lack of [[fossil]] records. Some scholars abandoned the question of the origin of language as unsolvable. Famously, the ''[[Société Linguistique de Paris]]'' in 1866 refused to admit any further papers on the subject.

[[Joseph Jastrow]] published a gestural theory of the evolution of language in the seventh volume of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', 1886.<ref name="Jastrow 1886">{{cite journal |author=Jastrow J |title=The Evolution of Language |journal=Science |volume=7 |issue=176S |pages=555–557 |year=1886 |pmid=17778380 |doi=10.1126/science.ns-7.176S.555 |jstor=1761264}}</ref>

The field re-appeared in 1988 in the ''[[Linguistic Bibliography]]'' as a subfield of [[psycholinguistics]]. In 1990, [[Steven Pinker]] and [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] published their paper "Natural Language and Natural Selection"<ref name="Pinker Bloom 2011">{{cite journal|last1=Pinker|first1=Steven|last2=Bloom|first2=Paul|title=Natural language and natural selection|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences| volume=13|issue=4| year=2011|pages=707–727 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X00081061}}</ref> which strongly argued for an [[adaptationist]] approach to language origins. Development strengthened further with the establishment (in 1996) of a series of conferences on the Evolution of Language (subsequently known as "Evolang"), promoting a scientific, multi-disciplinary approach to the issue, and interest from major academic publishers (e.g., the ''Studies in the Evolution of Language'' series has appeared with [[Oxford University Press]] since 2001)<ref>{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = Oxford Studies in the Evolution of Language | url = http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/category/academic/series/language/sel.do | publisher = Oxford University Press  | accessdate = 11 December 2013 }}</ref> and from scientific journals.

==Recent developments==
Evolutionary linguistics as a field is rapidly emerging as a result of developments in neighboring disciplines. To what extent language's features are determined by genes, a hotly debated dichotomy in linguistics, has had new light shed upon it by the discovery of the ''[[FOXP2]]'' [[gene]].<ref name="Scharff 2005">{{cite journal |author=Scharff C, Haesler S |title=An evolutionary perspective on FoxP2: strictly for the birds? |journal=Curr.

If both copies are damaged, the [[Purkinje layer]] (a part of the [[cerebellum]] that contains better-connected neurons than any other) develops abnormally, [[runt]]ing is more common, and pups die within weeks due to inadequate lung development.<ref name="Shu 2007">{{cite journal | author = Shu W, Lu MM, Zhang Y, Tucker PW, Zhou D, Morrisey EE | title = Foxp2 and Foxp1 cooperatively regulate lung and esophagus development | journal = Development | volume = 134 | issue = 10 | pages = 1991–2000 | date=May 2007| pmid = 17428829 | doi = 10.1242/dev.02846 | url = | issn = | last2 = Lu | last3 = Zhang | last4 = Tucker | last5 = Zhou | last6 = Morrisey }}</ref> Additionally, higher presence of ''FOXP2'' in songbirds is correlated to song changes, with [[Downregulation and upregulation|downregulation]] causing incomplete and inaccurate song imitation in [[Zebra Finch|zebra finches]]. In general, evidence suggests that the protein is vital to neuroplasticity. There is little support, however, for the idea that ''FOXP2'' is 'the grammar gene' or that it had much to do with the relatively recent emergence of syntactical speech.<ref name="Diller 2009">{{cite book | last1 = Diller | first1 = Karl C. |last2 = Cann | first2 =Rebecca L. |title = Evidence Against a Genetic-Based Revolution in Language 50,000 Years Ago |editors= Rudolf Botha and Chris Knight| work= The Cradle of Language|series = Oxford Series in the Evolution of Language |year = 2009 |publisher = Oxford University Press |location = Oxford. |isbn = 978-0-19-954586-5 | oclc = 804498749 | pages =135–149}}</ref>

Another controversial dichotomy is the question of whether human language is solely human or on a continuum with (admittedly far removed) [[Animal communication|animal communication systems]]. Studies in [[ethology]] have forced researchers to reassess many claims of uniquely human abilities for language and speech. For instance, [[Tecumseh Fitch]] has argued that the [[Larynx#Descended larynx|descended larynx]] is not unique to humans. Similarly, once held uniquely human traits such as formant perception, combinatorial phonology and compositional semantics are now thought to be shared with at least some nonhuman animal species. Conversely, [[Derek Bickerton]] and others argue that the advent of abstract words provided a mental basis for analyzing higher-order relations, and that any communication system that remotely resembles human language utterly relies on cognitive architecture that co-evolved alongside language.

As it leaves no fossils, language's form and even its presence are extremely hard or impossible to deduce from physical evidence. Computational modeling is now widely accepted as an approach to assure the internal consistency of language-evolution scenarios. Approximately one-third of all papers presented at the 2010 Evolution of Language conference<ref>{{Cite web  | title = Evolang8 - Program | url = http://www.let.uu.nl/evolang2010.nl/evolang8program.html | publisher =  | date = 2010  | accessdate = 11 December 2013 }}</ref> rely at least in part on computer simulations.

==Approaches==
One original researcher in the field is [[Luc Steels]], head of the research units of Sony CSL in [[Paris]] and the AI Lab at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]. He and his team are currently investigating ways in which artificial agents self-organize languages with natural-like properties and how meaning can co-evolve with language. Their research is based on the hypothesis that language is a [[complex adaptive system]] that emerges through adaptive interactions between agents and continues to evolve in order to remain adapted to the needs and capabilities of the agents. This research has been implemented in [[fluid construction grammar]] (FCG), a formalism for construction grammars that has been specially designed for the origins and evolution of language. The approach of computational modeling and the use of robotic agents grounded in real life is claimed to be theory independent. It enables the researcher to find out exactly what cognitive capacities are needed for certain language phenomena to emerge. It also focuses the researcher in formulating hypotheses in a precise and exact manner, whereas theoretical models often stay very vague.

Some linguists, such as [[John McWhorter]], have analyzed the evolution and construction of basic [[communication]] methods such as [[Pidgin]]ization and [[Creolization]].<ref name="McWhorter 2001">{{Cite book  | last1 = McWhorter | first1 = John H. | title = The power of Babel : a natural history of languag | date = 2001 | publisher = Times Books | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-7167-4473-3 | oclc = 46564796 }}</ref>

"Nativist" models of "[[Universal Grammar]]" are informed by [[linguistic universals]] such as the existence of [[pronoun]]s and [[demonstrative]]s, and the similarities in each language's process of [[nominalization]] (the process of [[verb]]s becoming [[noun]]s) as well as the reverse, the process of turning nouns into verbs.<ref name="Deutscher 2005">{{Cite book  | last1 = Deutscher | first1 = Guy | title = The unfolding of language : an evolutionary tour of mankind's greatest inventi | date = 2005 | publisher = Metropolitan Books | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-8050-7907-4 | oclc = 57311730 }}</ref> This is a purely descriptive approach to what we mean by "[[natural language]]" without attempting to address its emergence.

Finally there are those archaeologists and evolutionary anthropologists – among them Ian Watts,<ref name="Watts 2009">{{cite book |last = Watts | first = Ian  |title=Red Ochre, Body Painting, and Language: Interpreting the Blombos Ochre |editors= Rudolf Botha and Chris Knight| work= The Cradle of Language|series = Oxford Series in the Evolution of Language |year = 2009 |publisher = Oxford University Press |location = Oxford. |isbn = 978-0-19-954586-5 | oclc = 804498749 | pages =62–92}}</ref> Camilla Power<ref name="Power 2009">{{cite book |last = Power| first = Camilla |title=Sexual Selection Models for the Emergence of Symbolic Communication: Why They Should be Reversed |editors= Rudolf Botha and Chris Knight| work= The Cradle of Language|series = Oxford Series in the Evolution of Language |year = 2009 |publisher = Oxford University Press |location = Oxford. |isbn = 978-0-19-954586-5 | oclc = 804498749| pages= 257–280}}</ref> and [[Chris Knight (anthropologist)|Chris Knight]] (co-founder with [[James Hurford]] of the EVOLANG series of conferences) — who argue that 'the origin of language' is probably an insoluble problem. In agreement with [[Amotz Zahavi]],<ref name="Zahavi 1993">{{cite journal |author=Zahavi A |title=The fallacy of conventional signalling |journal=Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond., B, Biol. Sci. |volume=340 |issue=1292 |pages=227–30 |date=May 1993 |pmid=8101657 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1993.0061 |url=}}</ref> Knight argues that language — being a realm of patent fictions — is a theoretical impossibility in a Darwinian world, where signals must be intrinsically reliable. If we are going to explain language's evolution, according to this view, we must tackle it as part of a wider one — the evolutionary emergence of [[symbolic culture]] as such.<ref name="Knight 2009">{{Cite book | last1 = Knight| first1 =Chris| title=The origins of symbolic culture| editors = Ulrich J Frey; Charlotte Störmer; Kai P Willführ| work = Homo novus : a human without illusion | date = 2010 | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin ; New York | isbn = 978-3-642-12141-8 | oclc = 639461749| url = http://www.chrisknight.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/The-Origins-of-Symbolic-Culture.pdf |pages = 193–211 }}</ref>
