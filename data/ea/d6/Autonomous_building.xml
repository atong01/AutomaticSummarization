One major bank building (<link><target>ING Group</target><part>ING's</part></link><space/><link><target>Amsterdam</target></link><space/>headquarters) in the<space/><link><target>Netherlands</target></link><space/>was constructed to be autonomous and artistic as well.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Advantages</heading><paragraph>As an architect or engineer becomes more concerned with the disadvantages of transportation networks, and dependence on distant resources, their designs tend to include more autonomous elements. The historic path to autonomy was a concern for secure sources of heat, power, water and food. A nearly parallel path toward autonomy has been to start with a concern for environmental impacts, which cause disadvantages.</paragraph><paragraph>Autonomous buildings can increase security and reduce environmental impacts by using on-site resources (such as sunlight and rain) that would otherwise be wasted. Autonomy often dramatically reduces the costs and impacts of networks that serve the building, because autonomy short-circuits the multiplying inefficiencies of collecting and transporting resources. Other impacted resources, such as oil reserves and the retention of the local watershed, can often be cheaply conserved by thoughtful designs.</paragraph><paragraph>Autonomous buildings are usually<space/><link><target>efficient energy use</target><part>energy-efficient</part></link><space/>in operation, and therefore cost-efficient, for the obvious reason that smaller energy needs are easier to satisfy off-grid. But they may substitute energy production or other techniques to avoid diminishing returns in extreme conservation.</paragraph><paragraph>An autonomous structure is not always environmentally friendly. The goal of independence from support systems is associated with, but not identical to, other goals of environmentally responsible green building. However, autonomous buildings also usually include some degree of<space/><link><target>sustainability</target></link><space/>through the use of<space/><link><target>renewable energy</target></link><space/>and other renewable resources, producing no more<space/><link><target>greenhouse gas</target><trail>es</trail></link><space/>than they consume, and other measures.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Disadvantages</heading><paragraph>First and fundamentally, independence is a matter of degree. Complete independence is very hard or impossible to attain. For example, eliminating dependence on the electrical grid is relatively simple but growing all necessary food is a more demanding and time-consuming proposition.</paragraph><paragraph>Living in an autonomous shelter can require one to make sacrifices in one's lifestyle choices, personal behavior, and social expectations. Even the most comfortable and technologically advanced autonomous houses may require some differences in behavior. Some people adjust easily. Others describe the experience as inconvenient, irritating, isolating, or even as an unwanted full-time job. A well-designed building can reduce this issue, but usually at the expense of reduced autonomy.</paragraph><paragraph>An autonomous house must be custom-built (or extensively retrofitted) to suit the climate and location. Passive solar techniques, alternative toilet and sewage systems, thermal massing designs, basement battery systems, efficient windowing, and the array of other design tactics require some degree of non-standard construction, added expense, ongoing experimentation and maintenance, and also have an effect on the psychology of the space.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Brenda and Robert Vale</target><part>The Vales</part></link>, among others, have shown that living off-grid can be a practical, logical lifestyle choice&amp;mdash;under certain conditions.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">September 2010</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>Systems</heading><paragraph>This section includes some minimal descriptions of methods, to give some feel for such a building's practicality, provide indexes to further information, and give a sense of modern trends.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Water</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Ceres rainwater tank 2 Pengo.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>A domestic rainwater harvesting system</part></link><link><target>Image:Unterirdische Zisterne.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>A concrete under-floor cistern being installed.</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>There are many methods of collecting and conserving water.

Failure to pump a septic tank can cause overflow that damages the leach field, and contaminates ground water.

Paved areas and lawns or turf do not allow much precipitation to filter through the ground to recharge aquifers. They can cause flooding and damage in neighbourhoods, as the water flows over the surface towards a low point.</paragraph><paragraph>Typically, elaborate, capital-intensive<space/><link><target>storm sewer</target></link><space/>networks are engineered to deal with<space/><link><target>stormwater</target></link>. In some cities, such as the<space/><link><target>Victorian era</target></link><space/>London sewers or much of the old City of<space/><link><target>Toronto</target></link>, the storm water system is combined with the sanitary sewer system. In the event of heavy precipitation, the load on the sewage treatment plant at the end of the pipe becomes too great to handle and raw sewage is dumped into holding tanks, and sometimes into surface water.</paragraph><paragraph>Autonomous buildings can address precipitation in a number of ways:</paragraph><paragraph>If a water absorbing<space/><link><target>swale (geographical feature)</target><part>swale</part></link><space/>for each yard is combined with permeable<space/><link><target>concrete</target></link><space/>streets, storm drains can be omitted from the neighbourhood.

Solar roofs have the potential to be more cost-effective than retrofitted solar power, because buildings need roofs anyway.

The thermal mass of this system is sufficiently inexpensive and large that it can store enough summer heat to warm a building for the whole winter, and enough winter cold to cool the building in summer.</paragraph><paragraph>In annualized geo solar systems, the solar collector is often separate from (and hotter or colder than) the living space. The building may actually be constructed from<space/><link><target>Thermal insulation</target><part>insulation</part></link>, for example,<space/><link><target>straw-bale construction</target></link>. Some buildings have been aerodynamically designed so that convection via ducts and interior spaces eliminates any need for electric fans.</paragraph><paragraph>A more modest &quot;daily solar&quot; design is very practical. For example, for about a 15% premium in building costs, the<space/><link><target>passive house</target><part>Passivhaus</part></link><space/>building codes in Europe use high performance insulating windows, R-30 insulation, HRV ventilation, and a small thermal mass. With modest changes in the building's position, modern<space/><link><target>krypton</target></link>- or<space/><link><target>argon</target></link>-insulated windows permit normal-looking windows to provide passive solar heat without compromising insulation or structural strength. If a small heater is available for the coldest nights, a slab or basement cistern can inexpensively provide the required<space/><link><target>thermal mass</target></link>. Passivhaus building codes in particular bring unusually good interior air quality, because the buildings change the air several times per hour, passing it though a heat exchanger to keep heat inside.</paragraph><paragraph>In all systems, a small supplementary heater increases personal security and reduces lifestyle impacts for a small reduction of autonomy. The two most popular heaters for ultra-high-efficiency houses are a small<space/><link><target>heat pump</target></link>, which also provides<space/><link><target>air-conditioning</target></link>, or a central hydronic (radiator) air heater with water recirculating from the<space/><link><target>water heater</target></link>. Passivhaus designs usually integrate the heater with the ventilation system.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Earth sheltering</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>windbreak</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>can also reduce the absolute amount of heat needed by a building.

They increase a building's autonomy by decreasing the heat or fuel used to heat water. They are attractive because they have no lifestyle changes.</paragraph><paragraph>Current practical, comfortable domestic water-heating systems combine a solar preheating system with a<space/><link><target>water heater#Tankless heaters</target><part>thermostatic gas-powered flow-through heater</part></link>, so that the temperature of the water is consistent, and the amount is unlimited. This reduces life-style impacts at some cost in autonomy.<space/></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Solar water heater</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>can save large amounts of fuel. Also, small changes in lifestyle, such as doing laundry, dishes and bathing on sunny days, can greatly increase their efficiency. Pure solar heaters are especially useful for laundries, swimming pools and external baths, because these can be scheduled for use on sunny days.</paragraph><paragraph>The basic trick in a solar water heating system is to use a well-insulated holding tank. Some systems are<space/><link><target>vacuum</target></link>- insulated, acting something like large<space/><link><target>thermos</target></link><space/>bottles. The tank is filled with hot water on sunny days, and made available at all times. Unlike a conventional tank water heater, the tank is filled only when there is sunlight. Good storage makes a smaller, higher-technology collector feasible. Such collectors can use relatively exotic technologies, such as vacuum insulation, and reflective concentration of sunlight.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>cogeneration</target></link><space/>systems produce hot water from waste heat. They usually get the heat from the exhaust of a generator or fuel cell.</paragraph><paragraph>Heat recycling,<space/><link><target>cogeneration</target></link><space/>and solar pre-heating can save 50-75% of the gas otherwise used. Also, some combinations provide redundant reliability by having several sources of heat.Some authorities advocate replacing<space/><link><target>bottled gas</target></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>natural gas</target></link><space/>with<space/><link><target>biogas</target></link>. However, this is usually impractical unless live-stock are on-site. The wastes of a single family are usually insufficient to produce enough<space/><link><target>methane</target></link><space/>for anything more than small amounts of cooking.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Cooling</heading><paragraph>Annualized geo solar buildings often have buried, sloped water-tight skirts of insulation that extend<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>6</arg><arg>m</arg><arg>ft</arg></template><space/>from the foundations, to prevent heat leakage between the earth used as thermal mass, and the surface.</paragraph><paragraph>Less dramatic improvements are possible. Windows can be shaded in summer. Eaves can be overhung to provide the necessary shade. These also shade the walls of the house, reducing cooling costs.</paragraph><paragraph>Another trick is to cool the building's thermal mass at night, and then cool the building from the thermal mass during the day. It helps to be able to route cold air from a sky-facing radiator (perhaps an air heating solar collector with an alternate purpose) or evaporative cooler directly through the thermal mass. On clear nights, even in tropical areas, sky facing radiators can cool below freezing.</paragraph><paragraph>If a circular building is aerodynamically smooth, and cooler than the ground, it can be passively cooled by the &quot;dome effect.&quot; Many installations have reported that a reflective or light colored dome induces a local vertical heat driven vortex that sucks cooler overhead air downward into a dome if the dome is vented properly (a single overhead vent, and peripheral vents). Some people have reported a temperature differential as high as<space/><template><target>nowrap</target><arg>8 °C</arg></template><space/>(<template><target>nowrap</target><arg>15 °F</arg></template>) between the inside of the dome and the outside.<space/><link><target>Buckminster Fuller</target></link><space/>discovered this effect with a simple house design adapted from a<space/><link><target>grain silo</target></link>, and adapted his<space/><link><target>Dymaxion house</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>geodesic dome</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>to use it.</paragraph><paragraph>Refrigerators and air conditioners operating from the waste heat of a diesel engine exhaust, heater flue or solar collector are entering use. These use the same principles as a gas refrigerator. Normally, the heat from a flue powers an &quot;<link><target>absorptive refrigeration</target><part>absorptive chiller</part></link>&quot;. The cold water or brine from the chiller is used to cool air or a refrigerated space.</paragraph><paragraph>Cogeneration is popular in new commercial buildings. In current cogeneration systems small gas turbines or<space/><link><target>stirling engine</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>powered from natural gas produce electricity and their exhaust drives an<space/><link><target>absorptive chiller</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>A truck trailer refrigerator operating from the waste heat of a tractor's diesel exhaust was demonstrated by NRG Solutions, Inc. NRG developed a hydronic<space/><link><target>ammonia</target></link><space/>gas heat exchanger and vaporizer, the two essential new, not commercially available components of a waste heat driven refrigerator.</paragraph><paragraph>A similar scheme (multiphase cooling) can be by a multistage evaporative cooler. The air is passed through a spray of salt solution to dehumidify it, then through a spray of water solution to cool it, then another salt solution to dehumidify it again. The brine has to be regenerated, and that can be done economically with a low temperature solar still. Multiphase evaporative coolers can lower the air's temperature by 50F (28C), and still control humidity. If the brine regenerator uses high heat, they also partially sterilise the air.</paragraph><paragraph>If enough electric power is available, cooling can be provided by conventional air conditioning using a<space/><link><target>heat pump</target></link>.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Food production</heading><paragraph>Food production has often been included in historic autonomous projects to provide security.<extension extension_name='ref' name="publications"><link type='external' href='http://nature.my.cape.com/greencenter/pubonline.html'>Publications list of the New Alchemy Institute</link>.
