'''Chordates''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɔr|d|eɪ|t|s}}) are [[animal]]s possessing a [[notochord]], a hollow [[dorsal nerve cord]], [[pharyngeal slit]]s, an [[endostyle]], and a post-anal [[tail]] for at least some period of their life cycles. Taxonomically, the phylum includes the subphyla [[vertebrate|Vertebrata]], which includes [[mammal]]s, [[fish]], [[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s and [[bird]]s; [[Tunicate|Tunicata]], which includes [[salp]]s and [[sea squirt]]s; and [[Cephalochordata]], comprising the [[lancelet]]s. Members of the phylum Chordata are [[bilateral symmetry|bilaterally symmetric]], [[deuterostome]] [[coelom]]ates, and the vertebrate chordates display [[Segmentation (biology)|segmentation]].

[[Hemichordata]], which includes the [[acorn worm]]s, has been presented as a fourth chordate subphylum, but it now is usually treated as a separate phylum. It, along with the phylum [[Echinoderm]]ata, which includes [[starfish]], [[sea urchins]], [[sea cucumber]]s and their kin, are the chordates' closest relatives. Primitive chordates are known from at least as early as the [[Cambrian explosion]].

Of the more than 65,000 living species of chordates, about half are bony fish of the class [[Osteichthyes]]. The world's largest and fastest animals, the [[blue whale]] and [[peregrine falcon]] respectively, are chordates, as are [[human]]s.

==Overview of affinities==
Attempts to work out the evolutionary relationships of the chordates have produced several hypotheses. The current consensus is that chordates are [[monophyletic]], meaning that the Chordata include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, which is itself a chordate, and that craniates' nearest relatives are cephalochordates. All of the earliest chordate [[fossil]]s have been found in the Early [[Cambrian]] [[Chengjiang fauna]], and include two species that are regarded as [[fish]], which implies they are vertebrates. Because the fossil record of early chordates is poor, only [[molecular phylogenetics]] offers a reasonable prospect of dating their emergence. However, the use of molecular phylogenetics for dating evolutionary transitions is controversial.

It has also proved difficult to produce a detailed classification within the living chordates. Attempts to produce evolutionary "[[phylogenetic tree|family trees]]" give results that differ from traditional [[class (biology)|classes]] because several of those classes are not monophyletic. As a result, vertebrate classification is in a state of flux<ref>{{cite journal|last= Holland|first=N. D.|date= 22 November 2005|title= Chordates|journal= Curr. Biol. |volume=15|issue= 22|page= R911-R914}}</ref>

===Origin of name===
Although the name Chordata is attributed to [[William Bateson]] (1885), it was already in prevalent use by 1880. [[Ernst Haeckel]] described a taxon comprising tunicates, cephalochordates, and vertebrates in 1866. Though he used the German vernacular form, it is allowed under the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN code]] because of its subsequent latinization.<ref name="Nielsen2012">{{cite journal

[[Craniate]]s, one of the three subdivisions of chordates, have distinct [[skull]]s - including [[hagfish]], which have no [[vertebrae]]. [[Michael J. Benton]] comments, "craniates are characterized by their heads, just as chordates, or possibly all [[deuterostome]]s, are by their tails".

Since early chordates have left a poor fossil record, attempts have been made to calculate the key dates in their evolution by [[molecular phylogenetics]] techniques—by analyzing biochemical differences, mainly in RNA.

<!-- **************
The origin of chordates is currently unknown. The first clearly identifiable chordates are reduced fish- or [[lancelet]]-like specimens from the [[Cambrian]]. Most speculations about their origin fit into one or more of these categories:

* A sediment-dwelling, worm-like animal that evolved a flatter body and/or fins for swimming
* A sessile, tubular, filter-feeder that evolved into a free-swimming animal via the use of fins ([[Tunicates]], considered a chordate, are sessile filter feeders that have a tadpole-like larvae)
* A drifting or swimming larva of some other kind of animal that eventually retained its swimming features into adulthood

The notochord's stiffness in many chordates may have evolved to facilitate the effectiveness of alternating muscle contractions for swimming (in S-shaped movements). To bend the body, a muscle needs a rigid structure to pull against, and a notochord (at least before spines) is the main structure to provide this. The lack of a stiff body part would merely result in the shortening of the animal during muscle contractions instead of the bending motions needed for swimming.

Traditionally, Cephalochordata and Craniata were grouped into the proposed clade "Euchordata", which would have been the sister group to Tunicata/Urochordata. More recently, Cephalochordata has been thought of as a sister group to the "Olfactores", which includes the craniates and tunicates. The matter is not yet settled.

==Closest nonchordate relatives==

===Hemichordates===
{{main|Hemichordate}}

[[Hemichordate]]s ("half (½) chordates") have some features similar to those of chordates: branchial openings that open into the [[pharynx]] and look rather like gill slits; stomochords, similar in composition to [[notochord]]s, but running in a circle round the "collar", which is ahead of the mouth; and a [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorsal]] nerve cord—but also a smaller [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|ventral]] nerve cord.

There are two living groups of hemichordates. The solitary [[enteropneust]]s, commonly known as "acorn worms", have long [[proboscis]]es and worm-like bodies with up to 200 branchial slits, are up to {{convert|2.5|m|ft}} long, and burrow though seafloor [[sediment]]s. [[Pterobranch]]s are [[colony (biology)|colonial]] animals, often less than {{convert|1|mm|in}} long individually, whose dwellings are interconnected. Each [[filter feeding|filter feeds]] by means of a pair of branched tentacles, and has a short, shield-shaped proboscis. The extinct [[graptolite]]s, colonial animals whose fossils look like tiny [[hacksaw]] blades, lived in tubes similar to those of pterobranchs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/chordata/hemichordata.html|accessdate=2008-09-22|title=Introduction to the Hemichordata|publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology}}</ref>

===Echinoderms===
{{main|Echinoderm}}
[[Echinoderm]]s differ from chordates and their other relatives in three conspicuous ways: they possess [[bilateral symmetry]] only as larvae - in adulthood they have [[radial symmetry]], meaning that their body pattern is shaped like a wheel; they have [[tube feet]]; and their bodies are supported by [[skeleton]]s made of [[calcite]], a material not used by chordates. Their hard, calcified shells keep their bodies well protected from the environment, and these skeletons enclose their bodies, but are also covered by thin skins. The feet are powered by another unique feature of echinoderms, a [[water vascular system]] of canals that also functions as a "lung" and are surrounded by muscles that act as pumps. [[Crinoid]]s look rather like flowers, and use their feather-like arms to filter food particles out of the water; most live anchored to rocks, but a few can move very slowly. Other echinoderms are mobile and take a variety of body shapes, for example [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s and [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumbers]].<ref name="CowenHistLifeEd3P412">{{cite book
