In most<space/><link><target>jurisdiction</target><trail>s</trail></link>, the court system is divided into at least three levels: the trial court, which initially hears cases and reviews evidence and testimony to determine the facts of the case; at least one intermediate appellate court; and a<space/><link><target>supreme court</target></link><space/>(or court of last resort) which primarily reviews the decisions of the intermediate courts.

In some places, the appellate court has limited powers of review. &quot;Generally speaking, an appellate court's judgment provides 'the final directive of the appeals courts as to the matter appealed, setting out with specificity the court's determination that the action appealed from should be affirmed, reversed, remanded or modified'&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref'>State v.

Hence, such an appellate court will not consider an appellant's argument if it is based on a theory that is raised for the first time in the appeal.<space/><template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">July 2015</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>In most U.S. states, and in U.S. federal courts, parties before the court are allowed one appeal as of right. This means that a party who is unsatisfied with the outcome of a trial may bring an<space/><link><target>appeal</target></link><space/>to contest that outcome. However, appeals may be costly, and the appellate court must find an error on the part of the court below that justifies upsetting the verdict. Therefore, only a small proportion of trial court decisions result in appeals. Some appellate courts, particularly supreme courts, have the power of<space/><link><target>discretionary review</target></link>, meaning that they can decide whether they will hear an appeal brought in a particular case.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Institutional titles</heading><paragraph>Many U.S. jurisdictions title their appellate court a<space/><bold><italics>court of appeal</italics></bold><space/>or<space/><bold><italics>court of appeals</italics></bold>.<extension extension_name='ref'>The term<space/><italics>court of appeals</italics><space/>is not capitalized in carefully edited texts such as reference works, for example<space/><link type='external' href='http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Court+of+Appeal'>West's Encyclopedia of American Law</link><space/>unless referring to a specific court or courts, but many legal professionals do not comply with this most common English usage shown in major dictionaries and instead capitalize this and many other legal texts.</extension><space/>Historically, others have titled their appellate court a<space/><bold><italics>court of errors</italics></bold><space/>(or<space/><bold><italics>court of errors and appeals</italics></bold>), on the premise that it was intended to correct errors made by lower courts. Examples of such courts include the<space/><link><target>New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals</target></link><space/>(which existed from 1844 to 1947), the Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors (which has been renamed the<space/><link><target>Connecticut Supreme Court</target></link>), the Kentucky Court of Errors (renamed the<space/><link><target>Kentucky Supreme Court</target></link>), and the Mississippi High Court of Errors and Appeals (since renamed the<space/><link><target>Supreme Court of Mississippi</target></link>). In some jurisdictions, courts able to hear appeals are known as an<space/><bold>appellate division</bold>.</paragraph><paragraph>The phrase &quot;court of appeals&quot; most often refers to intermediate appellate courts.

Some jurisdictions have specialized appellate courts, such as the<space/><link><target>Texas Court of Criminal Appeals</target></link>, which only hears appeals raised in criminal cases, and the<space/><link><target>United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</target></link>, which has general jurisdiction but derives most of its caseload from patent cases, on one hand, and appeals from the<space/><link><target>Court of Federal Claims</target></link><space/>on the other.</paragraph><heading level='2'>New Zealand</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Court of Appeal of New Zealand</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>Court of Appeal of New Zealand</target></link>, located in<space/><link><target>Wellington</target></link>, is New Zealand's principal intermediate appellate court.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="title">Court of Appeal</arg><arg name="url">http://www.justice.govt.nz/courts/court-of-appeal</arg><arg name="website">justice.govt.nz</arg><arg name="accessdate">7 August 2014</arg></template></extension><space/>In practice, most appeals are resolved at this intermediate appellate level, rather than in the<space/><link><target>Supreme Court of New Zealand</target><part>Supreme Court</part></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="title">The history of the court system</arg><arg name="url">http://www.courtsofnz.govt.nz/about/system/history/overview/</arg><arg name="website">courtsofnz.govt.nz</arg><arg name="accessdate">7 August 2014</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Court of Criminal Appeal (disambiguation)</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Court of Criminal Appeals (disambiguation)</target></link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>Reflist</target></template></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>Lax, Jeffrey R. &quot;Constructing Legal Rules on Appellate Courts.&quot; American Political Science Review 101.3 (2007): 591-604.
