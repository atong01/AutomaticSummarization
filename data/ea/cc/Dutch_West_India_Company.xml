Among its founding fathers was<space/><link><target>Willem Usselincx</target></link><space/>(15671647). On June 3, 1621, it was granted a<space/><link><target>:wikisource:Charter of the Dutch West India Company</target><part>charter</part></link><space/>for a trade monopoly in the<space/><link><target>West Indies</target></link><space/>(meaning the Caribbean) by the<space/><link><target>Republic of the Seven United Netherlands</target></link><space/>and given jurisdiction over the<space/><link><target>Atlantic slave trade</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Brazil</target></link>, the<space/><link><target>Caribbean</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>North America</target></link>. The area where the company could operate consisted of<space/><link><target>West Africa</target></link><space/>(between the<space/><link><target>Tropic of Cancer</target></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>Cape of Good Hope</target></link>) and the<space/><link><target>Americas</target></link>, which included the<space/><link><target>Pacific Ocean</target></link><space/>and the eastern part of<space/><link><target>New Guinea</target></link>. The intended purpose of the charter was to eliminate competition, particularly Spanish or Portuguese, between the various trading posts established by the merchants. The company became instrumental in the<space/><link><target>Dutch colonization of the Americas</target></link>.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Origins</heading><paragraph><template><target>unreferenced section</target><arg name="date">June 2012</arg></template><link><target>File:Het West Indisch Huys - Amsterdam 1655.png</target><part>thumb</part><part>200px</part><part>The West Indian Warehouse at<space/><link><target>Rapenburg (Amsterdam)</target></link>, constructed in 1642</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>When the<space/><link><target>Dutch East India Company</target></link><space/>(VOC) was founded in 1602, some traders in Amsterdam did not agree with its monopolistic politics. With help from<space/><link><target>Plancius Peter</target></link>, a Flemish minister who was engaged in producing maps, globes and nautical instruments, they sought for a northeastern or northwestern access to Asia to circumvent the VOC monopoly. In 1609 English explorer<space/><link><target>Henry Hudson</target></link>, in employment of the VOC, landed on the coast of<space/><link><target>New England</target></link><space/>and sailed up what is now known as the Hudson River, in his quest for the<space/><link><target>Northwest Passage</target></link><space/>to Asia. However, he failed to find a passage. Consequently, in 1615<space/><link><target>Isaac Le Maire</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Samuel Blommaert</target></link>, assisted by others, focused on finding a south-westerly route around South America's<space/><link><target>Tierra del Fuego</target></link><space/>archipelago, in order to circumvent the monopoly of the VOC.</paragraph><paragraph>One of the first sailors who focused on trade with Africa was<space/><link><target>Balthazar de Moucheron</target></link>. The trade with<space/><link><target>Africa</target></link><space/>offered several possibilities to set up trading posts or factories, an important starting point for negotiations. It was Blommaert, however, who stated that in 1600 eight companies sailed on the coast of Africa, competing with each other for the supply of copper, from the<space/><link><target>Kingdom of Loango</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'>James LaFleur, ed. Pieter van den Broeck</extension><space/>Pieter van den Broecke was employed by one of these companies. In 1612, a Dutch fortress was built in<space/><link><target>Mouree</target></link><space/>(present day Ghana), along the<space/><link><target>Dutch Gold Coast</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Trade with the<space/><link><target>Caribbean</target></link>, for salt, sugar and tobacco, was hampered by Spain and delayed because of peace negotiations. Spain offered peace on condition that the Dutch Republic would withdraw from trading with Asia and America. Spain refused to sign the peace treaty if a West Indian Company would be established. At this time the<space/><link><target>Eighty Years' War</target><part>Dutch War of Independence (15681648)</part></link><space/>between Spain and the Dutch Republic was occurring.<space/><link><target>Grand Pensionary</target></link><space/><link><target>Johan van Oldenbarnevelt</target></link><space/>offered to only suspend trade with the West in exchange for the<space/><link><target>Twelve Years' Truce</target></link>. The result was that during a few years the company sailed under a foreign flag in South America. However, ten years later,<space/><link><target>Stadtholder</target></link><space/><link><target>Maurice of Orange</target></link>, proposed to continue the war with Spain, but also to distract attention from Spain to the Republic. In 1619, his opponent Johan van Oldenbarnevelt was beheaded, and when two years later the truce expired, the West Indian Company was established.</paragraph><heading level='2'>The first West India Company</heading><paragraph><link><target>Image:Delaware Bay Vinckeboons 14.jpg</target><part>left</part><part>thumb</part><part>200px</part><part>The Swaanendael Colony along the Delaware</part></link>The WIC was organized similarly to the<space/><link><target>Dutch East India Company</target></link><space/>(<template><target>lang-nl</target><arg>Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie</arg></template>, abbreviated as<space/><italics>VOC</italics>). Like the VOC, the WIC company had five offices, called chambers (<italics>kamers</italics>), in<space/><link><target>Amsterdam</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Rotterdam</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Hoorn</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Middelburg</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Groningen (city)</target><part>Groningen</part></link>, of which the chambers in Amsterdam and Middelburg contributed most to the company.

Only in 1623 was funding arranged, after several bidders were put under pressure. The<space/><link><target>States General of the Netherlands</target></link><space/>and the VOC pledged one million<space/><link><target>guilders</target></link><space/>in the form of capital and subsidy. Unlike the VOC, the WIC had no right to deploy military troops. When the Twelve Years' Truce in 1621 was over, the Republic had a free hand to re-wage war with Spain. A<space/><italics><link><target>Groot Desseyn</target></link></italics><space/>(&quot;grand design&quot;) was devised to seize the Portuguese colonies in Africa and the Americas, so as to dominate the sugar and slave trade. When this plan failed,<space/><link><target>privateering</target></link><space/>became one of the major goals within the WIC. The arming of merchant ships with guns and soldiers to defend themselves against Spanish ships was of great importance. On almost all ships in 1623, 40 to 50 soldiers were stationed, possibly to assist in the<space/><link><target>Maritime hijacking</target><part>hijacking</part></link><space/>of enemy ships.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>nl</target></template>Klein, P.W.

But because of high demand for trade with the West (mainly<space/><link><target>slave trade</target></link>), and the fact that still many colonies existed, it was decided to establish the Second Chartered West India Company (also called New West India Company) in 1675. This new company had the same trade area as the first. All ships, fortresses, etc. were taken over by the new company. The number of directors was reduced from 19 to 10, and the number of governors from 74 to 50. The new WIC had a capital that was slightly more than<space/><template><target>nowrap</target><arg>6 million</arg></template><space/>guilders around 1679, which was largely supplied by the Amsterdam Chamber.</paragraph><paragraph>From 1694 until 1700, the WIC waged a long conflict against the<space/><link><target>Eguafo Kingdom</target></link><space/>along the Gold Coast, present-day<space/><link><target>Ghana</target></link>.
