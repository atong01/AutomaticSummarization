Criminal defendants are usually obliged to post<space/><link><target>bail</target></link><space/>before being released from custody. For serious cases, such as murder, bail is often refused. Defendants must be present at every stage of the proceedings against them. (There is an exception for very minor cases such as traffic offenses in jurisdictions which treat them as crimes.)</paragraph><paragraph>In some jurisdictions, vulnerable defendants may be able to access the services of a<space/><link><target>Registered Intermediary</target></link><space/>to assist with communication at court.<extension extension_name='ref'>O'Mahony, B.M., Smith, K., &amp; Milne, R.
