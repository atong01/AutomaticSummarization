The northern and southern temperate zones have a flora distinct from that of the continent generally, which is tropical. In the countries bordering the<space/><link><target>Mediterranean Sea</target><part>Mediterranean</part></link>, there are groves of<space/><link><target>orange (fruit)</target><part>orange</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>olive</target></link><space/>trees, evergreen<space/><link><target>oak</target><trail>s</trail></link>,<space/><link><target>cork oak</target><part>cork</part></link><space/>trees and<space/><link><target>pine</target><trail>s</trail></link>, intermixed with<space/><link><target>cupressus</target><part>cypresses</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Myrtus</target><part>myrtles</part></link>,<space/><link><target>arbutus</target></link><space/>and fragrant<space/><link><target>Erica</target><part>tree-heaths</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>South of the<space/><link><target>Atlas mountains</target><part>Atlas</part></link><space/>Range the conditions alter. The zones of minimum rainfall have a very scanty flora, consisting of plants adapted to resist the great dryness. Characteristic of the<space/><link><target>Sahara</target></link><space/>is the<space/><link><target>date palm</target></link>, which flourishes where other vegetation can scarcely maintain existence, while in the semidesert regions the<space/><link><target>acacia</target></link>, from which gum arabic is obtained, is abundant.</paragraph><paragraph>The more humid regions have a richer vegetation; dense forest where the rainfall is greatest and variations of temperature least, conditions found chiefly on the tropical coasts, and in the west African equatorial basin with its extension towards the upper<space/><link><target>Nile</target></link>; and<space/><link><target>savanna</target></link><space/>interspersed with trees on the greater part of the plateaus, passing as the desert regions are approached into a scrub vegetation consisting of thorny acacias, etc. Forests also occur on the humid slopes of mountain ranges up to a certain elevation. In the coast regions the typical tree is the<space/><link><target>mangrove</target></link>, which flourishes wherever the soil is of a<space/><link><target>swamp</target></link><space/>character.</paragraph><paragraph>The dense<space/><link><target>forest</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>of West Africa contain, in addition to a great variety of<space/><link><target>hardwood</target><trail>s</trail></link>, two<space/><link><target>Arecaceae</target><part>palms</part></link>,<space/><italics><link><target>Elaeis guineensis</target></link></italics><space/>(oil palm) and<space/><italics><link><target>Raphia vinifera</target></link></italics><space/>(bamboo palm), not found, generally speaking, in the savanna regions.<space/><italics><link><target>Bombax</target></link></italics><space/>or silk-cotton trees attain gigantic proportions in the forests, which are the home of the India rubber-producing plants and of many valuable kinds of timber trees, such as<space/><link><target>odum</target></link><space/>(<italics>Chlorophora excelsa</italics>),<space/><link><target>ebony</target></link>,<space/><link><target>mahogany</target></link><space/>(<italics>Khaya senegalensis</italics>),<space/><link><target>Oldfieldia</target></link><space/>(<italics>Oldfieldia africana</italics>) and<space/><link><target>camwood</target></link><space/>(<italics>Baphia nitida</italics>). The climbing plants in the tropical forests are exceedingly luxuriant and the undergrowth or &quot;bush&quot; is extremely dense.</paragraph><paragraph>In the savannas the most characteristic trees are the monkey bread tree or<space/><link><target>baobab</target></link><space/>(<italics>Adanisonia digitata</italics>),<space/><link><target>Hyphaene thebaica</target><part>doum palm</part></link><space/>(<italics>Hyphaene</italics>) and<space/><link><target>euphorbia</target><trail>s</trail></link>. The<space/><link><target>coffee</target></link><space/>plant grows wild in such widely separated places as<space/><link><target>Liberia</target></link><space/>and southern<space/><link><target>Ethiopia</target></link>. The higher mountains have a special flora showing close agreement over wide intervals of space, as well as affinities with the mountain flora of the eastern<space/><link><target>Mediterranean Basin</target><part>Mediterranean</part></link>, the<space/><link><target>Himalaya</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Indo-China</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>In the swamp regions of north-east Africa<space/><link><target>papyrus</target></link><space/>and associated plants, including the soft-wooded<space/><link><target>ambach</target></link>, flourish in immense quantities, and little else is found in the way of vegetation. South Africa is largely destitute of forest save in the lower valleys and coast regions. Tropical flora disappears, and in the semi-desert plains the fleshy, leafless, contorted species of<space/><link><target>kapsia</target><trail>s</trail></link>,<space/><link><target>mesembryanthemum</target><trail>s</trail></link>,<space/><link><target>aloe</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and other succulent plants make their appearance. There are, too, valuable timber trees, such as the<space/><link><target>Podocarpus</target><part>Yellow-wood</part></link><space/>(<italics>Podocarpus elongatus</italics>),<space/><link><target>stinkwood</target></link><space/>(<italics>Ocotea</italics>),<space/><link><target>sneezewood</target></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>Cape ebony</target></link><space/>(<italics>Pteroxylon utile</italics>) and ironwood. Extensive miniature woods of heaths are found in almost endless variety and covered throughout the greater part of the year with innumerable blossoms in which red is very prevalent. Of the grasses of Africa alfa is very abundant in the plateaus of the Atlas range.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Fauna</heading><paragraph><link><target>Image:P l Bleyenberghi.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>upright</part><part>left</part><part>Southwest African lion (''Panthera leo bleyenberghi'').</part></link>The fauna again shows the effect of the characteristics of the vegetation. The open savannas are the home of large<space/><link><target>ungulate</target><trail>s</trail></link>, especially<space/><link><target>antelope</target><trail>s</trail></link>, the<space/><link><target>giraffe</target></link><space/>(peculiar to Africa),<space/><link><target>zebra</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Cape buffalo</target><part>buffalo</part></link>, wild<space/><link><target>donkey</target></link><space/>and four species of<space/><link><target>rhinoceros</target></link>; and of carnivores, such as the<space/><link><target>lion</target></link>,<space/><link><target>leopard</target></link>,<space/><link><target>hyena</target></link>, etc. The<space/><link><target>okapi</target></link><space/>(a genus restricted to Africa) is found only in the dense forests of the<space/><link><target>Congo River</target><part>Congo</part></link><space/>basin.<space/><link><target>Bear</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>are confined to the Atlas region,<space/><link><target>wolf</target><part>wolves</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>fox</target><trail>es</trail></link><space/>to North Africa. The<space/><link><target>elephant</target></link><space/>(though its range has become restricted through the attacks of hunters) is found both in the savannas and forest regions, the latter being otherwise poor in large game, though the special habitat of the<space/><link><target>chimpanzee</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>gorilla</target></link>.<space/><link><target>Baboon</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>mandrill</target><trail>s</trail></link>, with few exceptions, are peculiar to Africa. The single-humped<space/><link><target>camel</target></link>, as a domestic animal, isespecially characteristic of the northern deserts and steppes.</paragraph><paragraph>The rivers in the tropical zone abound with<space/><link><target>hippopotamus</target><part>hippopotami</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>crocodile</target><trail>s</trail></link>, the former entirely confined to Africa. The vast herds of game, formerly so characteristic of many parts of Africa, have much diminished with the increase of intercourse with the interior.<space/><link><target>Game reserve</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>have, however, been established in<space/><link><target>South Africa</target></link>,<space/><link><target>British Central Africa</target></link>,<space/><link><target>British East Africa</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Somaliland</target></link>, etc., while measures for the protection of wild animals were laid down in an international convention signed in May 1900.</paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>ornithology</target></link><space/>of northern Africa presents a close resemblance to that of southern Europe, scarcely a species being found which does not also occur in the other countries bordering the Mediterranean. Among the birds most characteristic of Africa are the<space/><link><target>ostrich</target></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>secretary-bird</target></link>. The ostrich is widely dispersed, but is found chiefly in the<space/><link><target>desert</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>steppe</target></link><space/>regions. The secretary-bird is common in the south. The<space/><link><target>weaver bird</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and their allies, including the<space/><link><target>long-tailed whydah</target><trail>s</trail></link>, are abundant, as are, among game-birds, the<space/><link><target>francolin</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>guineafowl</target></link>. Many of the smaller birds, such as the<space/><link><target>sunbird</target><trail>s</trail></link>,<space/><link><target>bee-eater</target><trail>s</trail></link>, the<space/><link><target>parrot</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>kingfisher</target><trail>s</trail></link>, as well as the larger<space/><link><target>plantain-eater</target><trail>s</trail></link>, are noted for the brilliance of their plumage.</paragraph><paragraph>Of<space/><link><target>reptile</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>the<space/><link><target>lizard</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>chameleon</target></link><space/>are common, and there are a number of venomous<space/><link><target>snake</target><trail>s</trail></link>, though these are not so numerous as in other tropical countries.</paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>scorpion</target></link><space/>is abundant. Of<space/><link><target>insect</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>Africa has many thousand different kinds; of these the<space/><link><target>locust</target></link><space/>is the proverbial scourge of the continent, and the ravages of the<space/><link><target>termite</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>are almost incredible. The spread of<space/><link><target>malaria</target></link><space/>by means of<space/><link><target>mosquito</target><trail>es</trail></link><space/>is common. The<space/><link><target>tsetse fly</target></link>, whose bite is fatal to all domestic animals, is common in many districts of South and East Africa. It is found nowhere outside Africa.</paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><paragraph><template><target>Portal</target><arg>Africa</arg></template></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Ecology</target></link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>References</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><template><target>1911</target></template></listitem></list><paragraph><template><target>Africa topics</target></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>DEFAULTSORT:Natural History Of Africa</target></template><link><target>Category:Natural history of Africa</target><part></part></link></paragraph></article>
