For 26 years (1863–1889) he was connected with the medical faculty of the [[Perelman School of Medicine|medical school of the University of Pennsylvania]], being elected professor of operative surgery in 1870 and professor of the principles and practice of surgery in the following year.

In 1889, he became the subject of the largest painting ever made by the Philadelphia artist [[Thomas Eakins]], called ''[[The Agnew Clinic]]'', in which he is shown conducting a mastectomy operation before a gallery of students and doctors. The artist can also be found to the right of the painting.

During the [[American Civil War]] he was consulting surgeon in the [[Mower Hospital|Mower Army Hospital]], near Philadelphia, and acquired considerable reputation for his operations in cases of gunshot wounds. He attended as operating surgeon when [[James A. Garfield|President Garfield]] was fatally wounded by the bullet of an assassin in 1881.<ref name="EB1911"/>

He was the author of several works, the most important being ''The Principles and Practice of Surgery'' (1878–1883).
