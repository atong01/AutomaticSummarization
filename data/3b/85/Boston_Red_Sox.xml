Following the trades, the club won 22 out of 25 games and qualified for the playoffs as the AL Wild Card.

In Game 4, the Red Sox found themselves facing elimination, trailing 43 in the ninth with<space/><link><target>Mariano Rivera</target></link><space/>in to close for the Yankees.

The Red Sox went on to win the game on a two-run home run by Ortiz in the 12th inning, who also made the walk-off hit in the 14th inning of game 5. The comeback continued with a victory from an injured Schilling in game 6. Three sutures being used to stabilize the tendon in Schilling's right ankle bled throughout the game, famously making his sock appear bloody red. The Red Sox completed their historic comeback in game 7 with a 10-3 defeat of the Yankees. Ortiz, who had the game-winning RBIs in Games 4 and 5, was named ALCS Most Valuable Player.

The Red Sox missed the playoffs in consecutive seasons for the first time since missing three straight postseasons from 2000 to 2002. Following the season, the Red Sox declined to exercise Terry Francona's 2012 contract option.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://espn.go.com/boston/mlb/story/_/id/7040260/terry-francona-boston-red-sox-part-ways-two-titles</arg><arg name="title">Terry Francona, Red Sox split</arg><arg name="date">September 30, 2011</arg><arg name="accessdate">October 1, 2011</arg><arg name="first">Joe</arg><arg name="last">McDonald</arg><arg name="work">ESPNBoston.com</arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite news</target><arg name="url">http://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2011/09/30/ignore-spin-red-sox-fired-terry-francona/Gu52pzZWWw8Af4iQ49WH7L/story.xml</arg><arg name="title">Ignore the spin – Red Sox fired Francona</arg><arg name="date">October 1, 2011</arg><arg name="accessdate">October 1, 2011</arg><arg name="first">Dan</arg><arg name="last">Shaughnessy</arg><arg name="newspaper">The Boston Globe</arg><arg name="page">A1</arg><arg name="authorlink">Dan Shaughnessy</arg></template></extension><space/>After the season, there was much controversy when it was claimed that the clubhouse didn't have solid leadership. On some days, starting pitchers Lackey, Beckett, and Lester spent time in the dugout drinking. Lester and the rest of the responsible pitchers stressed that they were only drinking when they had the day off pitching. After the tumultuous end of the season, Theo Epstein left for the<space/><link><target>Chicago Cubs</target></link><space/>and was replaced by his previous assistant,<space/><link><target>Ben Cherington</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>In December 2011,<space/><link><target>Bobby Valentine</target></link><space/>was hired as a new manager. At about the same time, longtime closer Papelbon signed with the<space/><link><target>Philadelphia Phillies</target></link><space/>rather than re-sign with the Red Sox. The 2012 season marked the centennial of<space/><link><target>Fenway Park</target></link>, and on April 20, past and present Red Sox players and coaches assembled to celebrate the park's anniversary. However, the collapse that they endured in September 2011 carried over into the season. The Red Sox struggled throughout the season due to injuries, inconsistent play, and off-field news. Many attempts to better the team through trades and free agent signing failed. Amidst rumors that Valentine and Youkilis were not getting along, the Red Sox traded Youkilis to the<space/><link><target>Chicago White Sox</target></link><space/>on June 24. On August 25, the Red Sox sent struggling players Gonzalez, Beckett, Crawford and infielder<space/><link><target>Nick Punto</target></link><space/>to the<space/><link><target>Los Angeles Dodgers</target></link><space/>for<space/><link><target>James Loney (baseball)</target><part>James Loney</part></link><space/>and four minor league prospects. In addition to the clubhouse drinking, Beckett was also heavily connected to another incident where some of the players attended his charity<space/><link><target>bowling</target></link><space/>game rather than the funeral for<space/><link><target>Johnny Pesky</target></link>, a longtime Red Sox shortstop, manager, and coach who died on August 13. Coupled with a bizarre and inconsistent season, the one-time ace became a pariah to Red Sox Nation. The Red Sox, realizing that the postseason was not in reach, decided to build with talent from their minor league system. Over the next few months, minor league callups<space/><link><target>Will Middlebrooks</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Pedro Ciriaco</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Ryan Lavarnway</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Daniel Nava</target></link><space/>were making regular appearances for the Red Sox.
