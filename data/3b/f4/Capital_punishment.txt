'''Capital punishment''', '''death penalty''' or '''execution''' is punishment by death. The [[Sentence (law)|sentence]] is referred to as a '''death sentence'''. Crimes that can result in a death penalty are known as '''capital crimes''' or '''capital offences'''. The term ''capital'' originates from the [[Latin]] ''capitalis'', literally "regarding the head" (referring to execution by [[beheading]]).<ref name=KronenwetterP202>{{Harvnb|Kronenwetter|2001|p=202}}</ref>

Capital punishment has, in the past, been practiced by most societies, as a punishment for criminals, and political or religious dissidents. Historically, the carrying out of the death sentence was often accompanied by torture, and executions were most often [[public execution|public]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/execution/readings/history.html |title=Readings – History Of The Death Penalty &#124; The Execution &#124; FRONTLINE |publisher=PBS |accessdate=11 February 2014}}</ref>

36 countries actively practice capital punishment, 103 countries have completely abolished it ''[[de jure]]'' for all crimes, 6 have abolished it for ordinary crimes only (while maintaining it for special circumstances such as war crimes), and 50 have abolished it ''[[de facto]]'' (have not used it for at least ten years and/or are under [[moratorium (law)|moratorium]]).

Nearly all countries in the world prohibit the execution of individuals who were under the age of 18 at the time of their crimes; since 2009, only [[Iran]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Sudan]] and [[Pakistan]] have carried out such executions.<ref name="autogenerated3">{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/news/2010/10/09/iran-saudi-arabia-sudan-end-juvenile-death-penalty |title=Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan: End Juvenile Death Penalty &#124; Human Rights Watch |publisher=Hrw.org |date=9 October 2010 |accessdate=11 February 2014}}</ref><ref name="Shafqat Hussain Hanged">{{cite web|url=http://www.reprieve.org.uk/press/pakistan-executes-shafqat-hussain-sentenced-to-death-as-a-juvenile/ |title=Pakistan executes Shafqat Hussain, sentenced to death as a juvenile |publisher=reprieve.org.uk |date=4 August 2015 |accessdate=29 August 2015}}</ref><ref name="Shafqat Hanged">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-33767835/ |title=Pakistan executes Shafqat Hussain despite appeals |publisher=bbc.com |date=4 August 2015 |accessdate=29 August 2015}}</ref> Executions of this kind are prohibited under [[international law]].<ref name="autogenerated3"/>

Capital punishment is a matter of active controversy in various countries and states, and positions can vary within a single [[political ideology]] or cultural region. In the [[European Union]] member states, Article 2 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] prohibits the use of capital punishment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf|title=Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|format=PDF|accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref> The [[Council of Europe]], which has 47 member states, also prohibits the use of the death penalty by its members.

==History==

Execution of criminals and political opponents has been used by nearly all societies—both to punish crime and to suppress political dissent. In most countries that practice capital punishment it is reserved for [[murder]], [[espionage]], [[treason]], or as part of military justice. In some countries sexual crimes, such as [[rape]], [[adultery]], [[incest]] and [[sodomy]], carry the death penalty, as do religious crimes such as [[Apostasy from Islam|apostasy in Islamic nations]] (the formal renunciation of the [[state religion]]). In many [[Use of capital punishment by nation|countries that use the death penalty]], [[drug trafficking]] is also a capital offense. In China, [[Trafficking in human beings|human trafficking]] and serious cases of [[Political corruption|corruption]] are punished by the death penalty. In militaries around the world [[courts-martial]] have imposed death sentences for offenses such as [[cowardice]], [[desertion]], [[insubordination]], and [[mutiny]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shotatdawn.org.uk/ |title=Shot at Dawn, campaign for pardons for British and Commonwealth soldiers executed in World War I |accessdate=20 July 2006 |publisher=Shot at Dawn Pardons Campaign |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20060703143147/http://www.shotatdawn.org.uk:80/ |archivedate=3 July 2006 }}</ref>

The use of formal execution extends to the beginning of recorded history. Most historical records and various primitive tribal practices indicate that the death penalty was a part of their justice system. Communal punishment for wrongdoing generally included compensation by the wrongdoer, [[corporal punishment]], [[shunning]], [[exile|banishment]] and execution. Usually, compensation and shunning were enough as a form of justice.<ref>So common was the practice of compensation that the word ''murder'' is derived from the French word ''mordre'' (bite) a reference to the heavy compensation one must pay for causing an unjust death. The "bite" one had to pay was used as a term for the crime itself: "Mordre wol out; that se we day by day." – [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (1340–1400), [[The Canterbury Tales]], ''The Nun's Priest's Tale,'' l. 4242 (1387–1400), repr. In ''The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer'', ed. Alfred W. Pollard, et al. (1898).</ref> The response to crime committed by neighbouring tribes or communities included an aformal apology, compensation or blood [[feud]]s.

A [[Feud|blood feud]] or vendetta occurs when arbitration between families or tribes fails or an arbitration system is non-existent. This form of justice was common before the emergence of an arbitration system based on state or organized religion. It may result from crime, land disputes or a code of honour. "Acts of retaliation underscore the ability of the social collective to defend itself and demonstrate to enemies (as well as potential allies) that injury to property, rights, or the person will not go unpunished."<ref>Translated from Waldmann, ''op.cit.'', p. 147.</ref> However, in practice, it is often difficult to distinguish between a war of vendetta and one of conquest.

Severe historical penalties include [[breaking wheel]], [[boiling to death]], [[flaying]], [[slow slicing]], [[disembowelment]], [[crucifixion]], [[impalement]], [[Crushing (execution)|crushing]] (including [[crushing by elephant]]), [[stoning]], [[execution by burning]], [[dismemberment]], [[sawing (torture)|sawing]], [[decapitation]], [[scaphism]], [[necklacing]] or [[blowing from a gun]].

===Ancient history===
Elaborations of tribal arbitration of [[feud]]s included peace settlements often done in a religious context and compensation system. Compensation was based on the principle of ''substitution'' which might include material (for example, cattle, slave) compensation, exchange of brides or grooms, or payment of the blood debt. Settlement rules could allow for animal blood to replace human blood, or transfers of property or [[Blood money (term)|blood money]] or in some case an offer of a person for execution. The person offered for execution did not have to be an original perpetrator of the crime because the system was based on tribes, not individuals. Blood feuds could be regulated at meetings, such as the [[Norsemen]] ''[[Thing (assembly)|things]]''.<ref>Lindow, ''op.cit.'' (primarily discusses Icelandic ''things'').</ref> Systems deriving from blood feuds may survive alongside more advanced legal systems or be given recognition by courts (for example, [[trial by combat]]). One of the more modern refinements of the blood feud is the [[duel]].
[[File:Mastro Titta.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Giovanni Battista Bugatti]], executioner of the [[Papal States]] between 1796 and 1865, [[list of people executed by the Holy See|carried out 516 executions]] ''(Bugatti pictured offering [[snuff (tobacco)|snuff]] to a condemned prisoner)''. [[Vatican City]] abolished [[Capital punishment in Vatican City|its capital punishment statute]] in 1969.]]

In certain parts of the world, nations in the form of ancient republics, monarchies or tribal oligarchies emerged. These nations were often united by common linguistic, religious or family ties. Moreover, expansion of these nations often occurred by conquest of neighbouring tribes or nations. Consequently, various classes of royalty, nobility, various commoners and slave emerged. Accordingly, the systems of tribal arbitration were submerged into a more unified system of justice which formalized the relation between the different "classes" rather than "tribes". The earliest and most famous example is [[Code of Hammurabi]] which set the different punishment and compensation, according to the different class/group of victims and perpetrators. The [[Torah]] (Jewish Law), also known as the [[Pentateuch]] (the first five books of the Christian [[Old Testament]]), lays down the death penalty for murder, [[kidnapping]], [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], violation of the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]], [[blasphemy]], and a wide range of sexual crimes, although evidence suggests that actual executions were rare.<ref>{{Cite book|first=William|last=Schabas|year=2002|title=The Abolition of the Death Penalty in International Law|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-81491-X}}</ref>

A further example comes from [[Ancient Greece]], where the [[Athenian]] legal system was first written down by [[Draco (lawgiver)|Draco]] in about 621 BC: the death penalty was applied for a particularly wide range of crimes, though [[Solon]] later repealed Draco's code and published new laws, retaining only Draco's homicide statutes.<ref>{{cite web|author=Robert|url=http://history-world.org/draco_and_solon_laws.htm|title=Greece, A History of Ancient Greece, Draco and Solon Laws|publisher=History-world.org|accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref> The word [[wikt:draconian|draconian]] derives from Draco's laws. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] also used death penalty for a wide range of offenses.<ref name=britannica>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/93902/capital-punishment|title=capital punishment (law) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia|publisher=Britannica.com|accessdate=12 December 2012}}</ref>

===Tang dynasty===
Although many are executed in the [[People's Republic of China]] each year in the present day, there was a time in the [[Tang dynasty]] when the death penalty was abolished.<ref name="benn 8">Benn, p. 8.</ref> This was in the year 747, enacted by [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] (r. 712–756). When abolishing the death penalty Xuanzong ordered his officials to refer to the nearest regulation by analogy when sentencing those found guilty of crimes for which the prescribed punishment was execution. Thus depending on the severity of the crime a punishment of severe scourging with the thick rod or of exile to the remote Lingnan region might take the place of capital punishment. However, the death penalty was restored only 12 years later in 759 in response to the [[An Lushan Rebellion]].<ref>Benn, pp. 209–210</ref> At this time in the Tang dynasty only the emperor had the authority to sentence criminals to execution. Under [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Xuanzong]] capital punishment was relatively infrequent, with only 24 executions in the year 730 and 58 executions in the year 736.<ref name="benn 8"/>

The two most common forms of execution in the Tang dynasty were strangulation and decapitation, which were the prescribed methods of execution for 144 and 89 offenses respectively. Strangulation was the prescribed sentence for lodging an accusation against one's parents or grandparents with a magistrate, scheming to kidnap a person and sell them into slavery and opening a coffin while desecrating a tomb. Decapitation was the method of execution prescribed for more serious crimes such as treason and sedition. Interestingly, and despite the great discomfort involved, most of the Tang Chinese preferred strangulation to decapitation, as a result of the traditional Tang Chinese belief that the body is a gift from the parents and that it is, therefore, disrespectful to one's ancestors to die without returning one's body to the grave intact.

Some further forms of capital punishment were practiced in the Tang dynasty, of which the first two that follow at least were extralegal. The first of these was scourging to death with the thick rod which was common throughout the Tang dynasty especially in cases of gross corruption. The second was truncation, in which the convicted person was cut in two at the waist with a fodder knife and then left to bleed to death.<ref name=Benn210>Benn, p. 210</ref> A further form of execution called Ling Chi ([[slow slicing]]), or death by/of a thousand cuts, was used from the close of the Tang dynasty (around 900) to its abolition in 1905.

When a minister of the fifth grade or above received a death sentence the emperor might grant him a special dispensation allowing him to commit suicide in lieu of execution. Even when this privilege was not granted, the law required that the condemned minister be provided with food and ale by his keepers and transported to the execution ground in a cart rather than having to walk there.

Nearly all executions under the Tang dynasty took place in public as a warning to the population. The heads of the executed were displayed on poles or spears. When local authorities decapitated a convicted criminal, the head was boxed and sent to the capital as proof of identity and that the execution had taken place.

In [[Middle Age|medieval]] and early modern Europe, before the development of modern [[prison]] systems, the death penalty was also used as a generalized form of punishment. During the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], as many as 72,000 people are estimated to have been executed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/execution/readings/history.html|title=History of the Death Penalty|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service|accessdate=12 December 2012}}</ref>

During early modern Europe, a massive [[moral panic]] regarding [[witchcraft]] swept across Europe and later the European colonies in North America. During this period, there were widespread claims that malevolent [[Satanism|Satanic]] [[witchcraft|witches]] were operating as an organized threat to [[Christendom]]. As a result, tens of thousands of women were prosecuted and executed through the [[witch trials in the early modern period|witch trials of the early modern period]] (between the 15th and 18th centuries).

The death penalty also targeted sexual offenses such as [[sodomy]]. In England, the [[Buggery Act 1533]] stipulated hanging as punishment for "[[buggery]]". [[James Pratt and John Smith]] were the last two Englishmen to be executed for sodomy in 1835.<ref>{{cite book | title=A Gay History of Britain: Love and Sex Between Men Since the Middle Ages | publisher=Greenwood World Publishing | last1=Cook |first1=Matt | last2=Mills |first2=Robert | last3=Trumback |first3=Randolph | last4=Cocks |first4=Harry | year=2007 |page=109| isbn=1846450020}}</ref>

Despite the wide use of the death penalty, calls for reform were not unknown. The 12th century [[Jewish]] legal scholar, Moses [[Maimonides]], wrote, "It is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent man to death." He argued that executing an accused criminal on anything less than absolute certainty would lead to a slippery slope of decreasing [[Legal burden of proof|burdens of proof]], until we would be convicting merely "according to the judge's caprice". Maimonides' concern was maintaining popular respect for law, and he saw errors of commission as much more threatening than errors of omission.<ref>Moses Maimonides, ''The Commandments, Neg. Comm. 290'', at 269–71 (Charles B. Chavel trans., 1967).</ref>

[[Islam]] on the whole accepts capital punishment,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/capitalpunishment.shtml|title=Islam and capital punishment|publisher=BBC|accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref> and the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]]s in [[Baghdad]], such as [[Al-Mu'tadid]], were often cruel in their punishments.<ref>''The Caliphate: Its Rise, Decline, and Fall.'', [[William Muir]]</ref> For hudud crimes such as [[zina]] (consensual extramarital or homosexual sex) and [[apostasy]] (leaving Islam and converting to another religion), [[Sharia]] requires capital punishment in public, while for crimes such as murder and manslaughter, the victim's family can either seek execution ([[Qisas]]) or can choose to spare the life of the killer in exchange for blood money restitution ([[Diyya]]).<ref name=elawa/><ref>Shahid M.

The last several centuries have seen the emergence of modern nation-states. Almost fundamental to the concept of nation state is the idea of [[citizenship]]. This caused justice to be increasingly associated with equality and universality, which in Europe saw an emergence of the concept of [[natural right]]s. Another important aspect is that emergence of standing police forces and permanent penitential institutions. The argument that deterrence, rather than retribution, is the main justification for punishment is a hallmark of the [[Rational choice theory (criminology)|rational choice theory]] and can be traced to [[Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria|Cesare Beccaria]] whose well-known treatise ''[[Dei delitti e delle pene|On Crimes and Punishments]]'' (1764), condemned [[torture]] and the death penalty and [[Jeremy Bentham]] who twice critiqued the death penalty.<ref name="deathpenalty">{{Cite journal|doi=10.2307/1143143|author1=Bedau, Hugo Adam|title=Bentham's Utilitarian Critique of the Death Penalty|journal=The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology|volume=74|issue=3|date=Autumn 1983|pages=1033–1065|publisher=[[Northwestern University School of Law]]|jstor=1143143|ref=harv}}</ref> Moving executions there inside prisons and away from public view was prompted by official recognition of the phenomenon reported first by Beccaria in Italy and later by [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Karl Marx]] of increased violent criminality at the times and places of executions.

By 1820 in Britain, there were 160 crimes that were punishable by death, including crimes such as shoplifting, petty theft, stealing cattle, or cutting down trees in public place.<ref>Durant, Will and Ariel, ''The Story of Civilization, Volume IX: The Age of Voltaire'' New York, 1965, page 71</ref> The severity of the so-called [[Bloody Code]], however, was often tempered by juries who refused to convict, or judges, in the case of petty theft, who arbitrarily set the value stolen at below the statutory level for a capital crime.<ref>Durant, Will and Ariel, ''The Story of Civilization, Volume IX: The Age of Voltaire'' New York, 1965, page 72,</ref>

The 20th century was a violent period. Tens of millions were killed in wars between nation-states as well as genocide perpetrated by nation states against political opponents (both perceived and actual), ethnic and religious minorities; the Turkish assault on the [[Armenian Genocide|Armenians]], [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] [[The Holocaust|attempt to exterminate the European Jews]], the [[Khmer Rouge]] [[Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia|decimation]] of [[Cambodia]], the [[Rwandan Genocide|massacre]] of the [[Tutsi]]s in [[Rwanda]], to cite four of the most notorious examples. A large part of execution was the summary execution of enemy combatants. In Nazi Germany there were three types of capital punishment; hanging, decapitation and death by shooting.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gN0QgcW4Td0C&pg=PA289&lpg=PA289&dq=Nazi+germany+law+decapitation&source=bl&ots=s76s2yKF0T&sig=VRp78E6M4IEwAIekYeVTWsvnHoY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=5ThoUpHKEYTCywG7koBg&ved=0CHkQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&q=Nazi%20germany%20law%20decapitation&f=false|page= 289|title=The criminal law of Japan: the general part|author=Dando Shigemitsu|year=1999}}</ref> Also, modern military organisations employed capital punishment as a means of maintaining military discipline. The Soviets, for example, executed 158,000 soldiers for desertion during [[World War&nbsp;II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/patriots-ignore-greatest-brutality/2007/08/12/1186857342382.html?page=2|title=Patriots ignore greatest brutality|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=13 August 2007|accessdate=12 December 2012}}</ref> In the past, [[cowardice]], absence without leave, [[desertion]], [[insubordination]], [[looting]], shirking under enemy fire and disobeying orders were often crimes punishable by death (see [[Decimation (Roman army)|decimation]] and [[running the gauntlet]]). One method of execution, since firearms came into common use, has almost invariably been [[firing squad]].

Various authoritarian states— for example those with fascist or communist governments—employed the death penalty as a potent means of political oppression. According to [[Robert Conquest]], the leading expert on Stalin's purges, more than 1 million Soviet citizens were executed during [[the Great Terror]] of 1937–38, almost all by a bullet to the back of the head.<ref>Conquest, Robert, ''[[The Great Terror]]: A Reassessment'', New York, pages 485–86</ref> [[Mao Zedong]] publicly stated that "800,000" people had been executed after the Communist Party's [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|victory]] in 1949. Partly as a response to such excesses, civil rights organizations have started to place increasing emphasis on the concept of [[human rights]] and an abolition of the death penalty.

Among countries around the world, almost all European and many Pacific Area states (including Australia, New Zealand and [[East Timor|Timor Leste]]), and Canada have abolished capital punishment. In Latin America, most states have completely abolished the use of capital punishment while some countries, such as Brazil, allow for capital punishment only in exceptional situations, such as treason committed during wartime. The [[Capital punishment in the United States|United States]] (the federal government and 31 of the states), Guatemala, most of the Caribbean and the majority of democracies in Asia (for example, Japan and India) and Africa (for example, Botswana and Zambia) retain it. South Africa's [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]], in judgment of the case of ''[[State v Makwanyane and Another]]'', unanimously abolished the death penalty on 6 June 1995.<ref name=French>{{cite news|last=French|first=Howard|title=South Africa's Supreme Court Abolishes Death Penalty|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/07/world/south-africa-s-supreme-court-abolishes-death-penalty.html|accessdate=4 December 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=7 June 1995}}</ref><ref name=CCSA>{{cite journal|last=South Africa: Constitutional Court|title=S v Makwanyane and Another (CCT3/94) (1995) ZACC 3; 1995 (6) BCLR 665; 1995 (3) SA 391; (1996) 2 CHRLD 164; 1995 (2) SACR 1|date=6 June 1995|url=http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/1995/3.html|accessdate=4 December 2012|publisher=Southern African Legal Information Institute}}</ref>

Abolition was often adopted due to political change, as when countries shifted from authoritarianism to democracy, or when it became an entry condition for the European Union. The United States is a notable exception: some states have had bans on capital punishment for decades (the earliest is [[Michigan]], where it was abolished in 1846), while others actively use it today. The death penalty there remains a contentious issue which is hotly debated.

In abolitionist countries, the debate is sometimes revived by particularly brutal murders though few countries have brought it back after abolishing it. However, a spike in serious, violent crimes, such as murders or terrorist attacks, has prompted some countries (such as Sri Lanka and Jamaica) to effectively end the moratorium on the death penalty. In retention countries, the debate is sometimes revived when a miscarriage of justice has occurred though this tends to cause legislative efforts to improve the judicial process rather than to abolish the death penalty.

==Movements towards painless execution==
{{Further|Cruel and unusual punishment}}
[[File:SQ Lethal Injection Room.jpg|thumb|A gurney in the [[San Quentin State Prison]] in the United States on which prisoners are restrained during an execution by [[lethal injection]].]]
Trends in most of the world have long been to move to less painful, or more humane, executions. France developed the [[guillotine]] for this reason in the final years of the 18th century, while Britain banned [[Hanged, drawn and quartered|drawing and quartering]] in the early 19th century. [[Hanging]] by turning the victim off a ladder or by kicking a stool or a bucket, which causes death by suffocation, was replaced by [[hanging|long drop "hanging"]] where the subject is dropped a longer distance to dislocate the neck and sever the [[spinal cord]]. Shah of Persia introduced throat-cutting and [[blowing from a gun]] as quick and painless alternatives to more tormentous methods of executions used at that time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://explorion.net/ride-india-across-persia-and-baluchistan/chapter-vii-ispahan-shiraz?page=3&quicktabs_3=1|title=• Travel & Exploration • A Ride to India across Persia and Baluchistan • CHAPTER VII. ISPAHAN – SHIRAZ|publisher=Explorion.net|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref> In the U.S., the [[electric chair]] and the [[gas chamber]] were introduced as more humane alternatives to hanging, but have been almost entirely superseded by [[lethal injection]], which in turn has been criticised as being too painful. Nevertheless, some countries still employ slow hanging methods, beheading by sword and [[stoning]].

In early [[New England]], public executions were a very solemn and sorrowful occasion, sometimes attended by large crowds, who also listened to a Gospel message<ref>[http://calebadams.org/news_article.htm Article from the ''Connecticut Courant''] (1 December 1803)</ref> and remarks by local preachers and politicians. The ''[[The Hartford Courant|Connecticut Courant]]'' records one such public execution on 1 December 1803, saying, "The assembly conducted through the whole in a very orderly and solemn manner, so much so, as to occasion an observing gentleman acquainted with other countries as well as this, to say that such an assembly, so decent and solemn, could not be collected anywhere but in New England."<ref>[http://calebadams.org/index.htm The Execution of Caleb Adams], 2003</ref>

==Abolition of capital punishment==
[[File:Leopold II as Grand Duke of Tuscany by Joseph Hickel 1769.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Peter Leopold II]], Grand Duke of Tuscany, by {{Ill|de|Joseph Hickel}}, 1769]]
Many countries have abolished capital punishment either in law or in practice. Since [[World War II]] there has been a trend toward abolishing capital punishment. 103 countries have abolished capital punishment altogether, 6 have done so for all offences except under special circumstances and 50 have abolished it in practice because they have not used it for at least 10 years or are under a moratorium.

The death penalty was banned in China between 747 and 759. In Japan, [[Emperor Saga]] abolished the death penalty in 818 under the influence of Shinto and it lasted until 1156.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1472|title=Encyclopedia of Shinto|publisher=kokugakuin.ac.jp|accessdate=5 September 2011}}</ref>

In England, a public statement of opposition was included in [[The Twelve Conclusions of the Lollards]], written in 1395. Sir Thomas More's ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', published in 1516, debated the benefits of the death penalty in dialogue form, coming to no firm conclusion. More recent opposition to the death penalty stemmed from the book of the Italian [[Cesare Beccaria]] ''Dei Delitti e Delle Pene'' ("[[On Crimes and Punishments]]"), published in 1764. In this book, Beccaria aimed to demonstrate not only the injustice, but even the futility from the point of view of [[social policy|social welfare]], of [[torture]] and the death penalty. Influenced by the book, [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Grand Duke Leopold II]] of Habsburg, famous [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightened monarch]] and future Emperor of Austria, abolished the death penalty in the then-independent [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]], the first permanent abolition in modern times. On 30 November 1786, after having ''de facto'' blocked capital executions (the last was in 1769), Leopold promulgated the reform of the [[penal code]] that abolished the death penalty and ordered the destruction of all the instruments for capital execution in his land. In 2000, Tuscany's regional authorities instituted an annual holiday on 30 November to commemorate the event. The event is commemorated on this day by 300 cities around the world celebrating [[Cities for Life Day]].

The [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] banned capital punishment in 1849. [[Venezuela]] followed suit and abolished the death penalty in 1854<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/venezuela/5.htm|title=Venezuela: A Country Study (The Century of Caudillismo)|publisher=countrystudies.us|accessdate=4 August 2012}}</ref> and [[Use of capital punishment by nation|San Marino]] did so in 1865. The last execution in San Marino had taken place in 1468. In Portugal, after legislative proposals in 1852 and 1863, the death penalty was abolished in 1867.

Abolition occurred in [[Capital punishment in Canada#History|Canada in 1976 (except for some military offences, with complete abolition in 1998)]], in [[Capital punishment in France#Abolition|France in 1981]], and in [[Capital punishment in Australia#Commonwealth|Australia in 1973]] (although the state of [[Capital punishment in Australia#Western Australia|Western Australia]] retained the penalty until 1984). In 1977, the United Nations General Assembly affirmed in a formal resolution that throughout the world, it is desirable to "progressively restrict the number of offenses for which the death penalty might be imposed, with a view to the desirability of abolishing this punishment".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsbatch.com/deathpenalty.htm|title=Death Penalty|publisher=Newsbatch.com|date=1 March 2005|accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref>

In the United Kingdom, it was abolished for murder (leaving only [[treason]], [[piracy with violence]], [[arson in royal dockyards]] and a number of wartime military offences as capital crimes) for a five-year experiment in 1965 and permanently in 1969, the last execution having taken place in 1964. It was abolished for all peacetime offences in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stephen-stratford.co.uk/capital_hist.htm|title=History of Capital Punishment|publisher=Stephen-stratford.co.uk|accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref>

In the United States, Michigan was the first state to ban the death penalty, on 18 May 1846.<ref>See Caitlin [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=micounty;cc=micounty;rgn=full%20text;idno=APK1036.0001.001;didno=APK1036.0001.001;view=image;seq=00000444 pp. 420–422]</ref> The death penalty was declared unconstitutional between 1972 and 1976 based on the ''[[Furman v. Georgia]]'' case, but the 1976 ''[[Gregg v. Georgia]]'' case once again permitted the death penalty under certain circumstances. Further limitations were placed on the death penalty in ''[[Atkins v. Virginia]]'' (death penalty unconstitutional for people with an [[intellectual disability]]) and ''[[Roper v. Simmons]]'' (death penalty unconstitutional if defendant was under age 18 at the time the crime was committed). In the United States, 19 states and the [[District of Columbia]] ban capital punishment, with [[Capital punishment in Nebraska|Nebraska]] the most recent state to ban the practice.<ref name=DugganOmaha>{{cite web|last1=Duggan|first1=Joe|last2=Hammel|first2=Paul|last3=Stoddard|first3=Martha|title=Hours of suspense, emotion lead up to a landmark vote for legislators on repealing death penalty|url=http://www.omaha.com/news/legislature/live-coverage-fate-of-death-penalty-in-nebraska-hinges-on/article_32726c27-0ef4-5415-9d07-f90f08707602.html|website=Omaha.com|accessdate=19 October 2015}}</ref>

One of the latest countries to abolish the death penalty for all crimes was [[Gabon]], in February 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.handsoffcain.info/archivio_news/index.php?iddocumento=15302086&mover=0|title=Death Penalty: Hands Off Cain Announces Abolition In Gabon|publisher=Handsoffcain.info|accessdate=12 December 2012}}</ref>

Abolitionists believe capital punishment is the worst violation of [[human rights]], because the [[right to life]] is the most important, and capital punishment violates it without necessity and inflicts to the condemned a [[psychological torture]]. Human rights activists oppose the death penalty, calling it "cruel, inhuman, and degrading punishment". [[Amnesty International]] considers it to be "the ultimate, irreversible denial of Human Rights".<ref name="Abolish the death penalty">{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty|title=Abolish the death penalty|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref>

A public execution is a form of capital punishment in which "members of the general public may voluntarily attend". The standard definition normally excludes the presence of a limited number of "passive citizens" that "witness the event to assure executive accountability".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Blum |first=Steven A. |date=Winter 1992 |title=Public Executions: Understand the "Cruel and Unusual Punishments" Clause |url=http://www.hastingsconlawquarterly.org/archives/V19/I2/Blum.pdf |journal=Hastings Constitutional Law Quarterly |publisher= |volume=19 |issue=2 |page=415 |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> While today the great majority of the world considers public executions to be uncivilized and distasteful and most countries have outlawed the practice, throughout much of history executions were performed publicly as a means for the state to demonstrate "its power before those who fell under its jurisdiction be they criminals, enemies, or political opponents". Additionally, it afforded the public a chance to witness "what was considered a great spectacle".<ref>{{cite book |last=Cawthorne |first=Nigel |date=2006 |title=Public Executions: From Ancient Rome to the Present Day |url= |location= |publisher= |pages=6–7 |isbn=978-0-7858-2119-9 |accessdate= }}</ref>

The death penalty for [[Adolescence|juvenile]] offenders (criminals aged under 18 years at the time of their crime) has become increasingly rare. Considering the [[Age of Majority]] is still not 18 in some countries, since 1990 nine countries have executed offenders who were juveniles at the time of their crimes: The [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC), [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Iran]], [[Nigeria]], [[Pakistan]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Sudan]], the [[United States]] (see ''[[List of juvenile offenders executed in the United States]]''), and [[Yemen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internationaljusticeproject.org/juvWorld.cfm|title=Juvenile executions (except US)|publisher=Internationaljusticeproject.org|accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref> The PRC<!--Refer to it as PRC to avoid confusion with the ROC on Taiwan-->, Pakistan, the United States, Yemen and Iran have since raised the minimum age to 18.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranwpd.com/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=3066:iran-changes-law-for-execution-of-juveniles&Itemid=64 |title=Iran changes law for execution of juveniles |publisher=Iranwpd.com |date=10 February 2012 |accessdate=30 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120429231704/http://iranwpd.com/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=3066:iran-changes-law-for-execution-of-juveniles&Itemid=64 |archivedate=29 April 2012 }}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://ghanoononline.ir/NSite/FullStory/News/?Serv=19&Id=16270 |title=مجازات قصاص برای افراد زیر 18 سال ممنوع شد |publisher=Ghanoononline.ir |accessdate=12 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120213111337/http://www.ghanoononline.ir:80/NSite/FullStory/News/?Serv=19&Id=16270 |archivedate=13 February 2012 }}</ref> Amnesty International has recorded 61 verified executions since then, in several countries, of both juveniles and adults who had been convicted of committing their offenses as juveniles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty/executions-of-child-offenders-since-1990 |title=Executions of juveniles since 1990 |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=12 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20121204044639/http://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty/executions-of-child-offenders-since-1990 |archivedate=4 December 2012 }}</ref> The PRC does not allow for the execution of those under 18, but child executions have reportedly taken place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGACT500152004|title=Stop Child Executions!

In addition, in 2002, the United States Supreme Court declared unconstitutional the execution of individuals with an [[intellectual disability]], in ''[[Atkins v. Virginia]]''.<ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/2002/LAW/06/20/scotus.executions/ Supreme Court bars executing mentally retarded] CNN.com Law Center. 25 June 2002 {{wayback|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/LAW/06/20/scotus.executions/ |date=20140407092922 }}</ref>

Between 2005 and May 2008, Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Yemen were reported to have executed child offenders, the most being from Iran.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/pub/2008/children/HRW.Juv.Death.Penalty.053008.pdf|title=HRW Report|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref>

The [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], which forbids capital punishment for juveniles under article 37(a), has been signed by all countries and [[ratification|ratified]], except for [[Somalia]] and the United States (notwithstanding the latter's Supreme Court decisions abolishing the practice).<ref>UNICEF, [http://www.unicef.org/crc/index_30229.html Convention of the Rights of the Child – FAQ]: "The Convention on the Rights of the Child is the most widely and rapidly ratified human rights treaty in history. Only two countries, Somalia and the United States, have not ratified this celebrated agreement. Somalia is currently unable to proceed to ratification as it has no recognised government. By signing the Convention, the United States has signaled its intention to ratify but has yet to do so."</ref> The UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights maintains that the death penalty for juveniles has become contrary to a [[jus cogens]] of [[customary international law]]. A majority of countries are also party to the U.N. [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (whose Article 6.5 also states that "Sentence of death shall not be imposed for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age...").

In Japan, the minimum age for the death penalty is 18 as mandated by the internationals standards. But under Japanese law, anyone under 20 is considered a juvenile. There are [[Capital punishment in Japan#Death sentences for minors|three men currently on death row]] for crimes they committed at age 18 or 19.

====Iran====
{{further|Human rights in Iran#Children's rights}}
Iran, despite its ratification of the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] and [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], was the world's largest executioner of juvenile offenders, for which it has received international condemnation; the country's record is the focus of the [[Stop Child Executions Campaign]]. But on 10 February 2012, Iran's parliament changed the controversial law of executing juveniles. In the new law, the age of 18 (solar year) would be for both genders considered and juvenile offenders will be sentenced on a separate law than of adults.<ref name=autogenerated2 /><ref name=autogenerated1 /> Based on the Islamic law which now seems to have been revised, girls at the age of 9 and boys at 15 of lunar year (11 days shorter than a solar year) were fully responsible for their crimes.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

Iran accounted for two-thirds of the global total of such executions, and currently{{update after|2014|8|15}} has roughly 140 people on death row for crimes committed as juveniles (up from 71 in 2007).<ref name=AP>[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-09-17-child-executions_N.htm Iranian activists fight child executions], Ali Akbar Dareini, [[Associated Press]], 17 September 2008.

====Somalia====
There is evidence that child executions are taking place in the parts of Somalia controlled by the [[Islamic Courts Union]] (ICU). In October 2008, a girl, Aisho Ibrahim Dhuhulow was buried up to her neck at a [[Soccer-specific stadium|football stadium]], then [[stoning|stoned]] to death in front of more than 1,000 people. The stoning occurred after she had allegedly pleaded guilty to [[adultery]] in a [[shariah]] court in [[Kismayo]], a city controlled by the ICU. According to a local leader associated with the ICU, she had stated that she wanted shariah law to apply.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7694397.stm|title=Somali woman executed by stoning|date=27 October 2008|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=31 October 2008}}</ref> However, other sources state that the victim had been crying, that she begged for mercy and had to be forced into the hole before being buried up to her neck in the ground.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7708169.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Stoning victim 'begged for mercy'|date=4 November 2008|accessdate=14 April 2010}}</ref> Amnesty International later learned that the girl was in fact 13 years old and had been arrested by the al-Shabab militia after she had reported being gang-raped by three men.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/somalia-girl-stoned-was-child-13-20081031 |title=Somalia: Girl stoned was a child of 13 |date=31 October 2008 |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=31 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20081109195953/http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/somalia-girl-stoned-was-child-13-20081031 |archivedate=9 November 2008 }}</ref>

==Capital crime==

===Murder===
One crime which capital punishment is used for is murder. Supporters of the death penalty argued that death penalty is morally justified when applied in murder especially with aggravating elements such as for multiple [[murder]], [[child murder]], [[serial killing]], [[torture murder]], [[mass murder]], [[terrorism]], [[massacre]] or [[genocide]]. It is said that capital punishment for murder is and should be "[[an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth]]".

===Drug trafficking===

Some countries that retain the death penalty for murder and other violent crimes do not execute offenders for drug-related crimes. Countries that have statutory provisions for the death penalty for drug-related offences {{as of | 2012 | lc = on}} include:

===Retribution===
[[File:Lingchi (cropped).jpg|thumb|Ling Chi – execution by [[slow slicing]] – was reserved for crimes viewed as especially severe, such as killing one's parents.]]
Supporters of the death penalty argued that death penalty is morally justified when applied in murder especially with aggravating elements such as for multiple [[homicide]], [[child murder]]ers, [[cop killer]]s, [[torture murder]] and [[mass killing]] such as [[terrorism]], [[massacre]], or [[genocide]]. Some even argue that not applying death penalty in latter cases is patently unjust. This argument is strongly defended by [[New York Law School]]'s Professor [[Robert Blecker Wants Me Dead|Robert Blecker]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyls.edu/faculty/faculty_profiles/robert_blecker/ |title=New York Law School :: Robert Blecker |publisher=Nyls.edu |accessdate=14 April 2013}}</ref> who says that the punishment must be painful in proportion to the crime. 18th century philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] sums it up as following;

{{Quote|But whoever has committed murder, must die. There is, in this case, no juridical substitute or surrogate, that can be given or taken for the satisfaction of justice. There is no likeness or proportion between life, however painful, and death; and therefore there is no equality between the crime of murder and the retaliation of it but what is judicially accomplished by the execution of the criminal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.american.edu/dgolash/Kant_on_Punishment.html/ |title=Immanuel Kant, The Philosophy of Right |publisher=American.edu |accessdate=6 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20140217232041/http://www1.american.edu:80/dgolash/Kant_on_Punishment.html |archivedate=17 February 2014 }}</ref>}}

Abolitionists argue that retribution is simply revenge and cannot be condoned. Others while accepting retribution as an element of criminal justice nonetheless argue that [[life without parole]] is a sufficient substitute. It is also argued that the punishing of a killing with another killing is a relatively unique punishment for a violent act, because in general violent crimes are not punished by subjecting the perpetrator to a similar act (e.g. rapists are not punished by being sexually assaulted).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/capitalpunishment/against_1.shtml#section_4 |title=Ethics – Capital punishment: Arguments against capital punishment |publisher=BBC |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=11 February 2014}}</ref>

===Human rights===
Abolitionists believe capital punishment is the worst violation of [[human rights]], because the [[right to life]] is the most important, and capital punishment violates it without necessity and inflicts to the condemned a [[psychological torture]]. Human rights activists oppose the death penalty, calling it "[[cruel and unusual punishment|cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment]]". [[Amnesty International]] considers it to be "the ultimate irreversible denial of Human Rights".<ref name="Abolish the death penalty"/> [[Albert Camus]] wrote in a 1956 book called ''Reflections on the Guillotine, Resistance, Rebellion & Death'':

{{Quote|An execution is not simply death. It is just as different from the privation of life as a concentration camp is from prison. [...] For there to be an equivalency, the death penalty would have to punish a criminal who had warned his victim of the date at which he would inflict a horrible death on him and who, from that moment onward, had confined him at his mercy for months. Such a monster is not encountered in private life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.smu.edu/rhalperi/ |title=Death Penalty News & Updates |publisher=People.smu.edu |accessdate=14 April 2013}}</ref>}}

In the classic doctrine of [[natural rights]] as expounded by for instance [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]], on the other hand, it is an important idea that the right to life can be forfeited.<ref name=feinberg>Joel Feinberg: [http://www.tannerlectures.utah.edu/lectures/documents/feinberg80.pdf Voluntary Euthanasia and the Inalienable Right to Life] [[Tanner Lectures on Human Values|The Tanner Lecture on Human Values]], 1 April 1977. {{wayback|url=http://www.tannerlectures.utah.edu/lectures/documents/feinberg80.pdf |date=20150402135830 }}</ref> As John Stuart Mill explained in a speech against an amendment to abolish capital punishment for murder in 1868;

{{Quote|And we may imagine somebody asking how we can teach people not to inflict suffering by ourselves inflicting it? But to this I should answer – all of us would answer – that to deter by suffering from inflicting suffering is not only possible, but the very purpose of penal justice. Does fining a criminal show want of respect for property, or imprisoning him, for personal freedom? Just as unreasonable is it to think that to take the life of a man who has taken that of another is to show want of regard for human life.

[[File:Timothy Evans Grave.JPG|thumb|Capital punishment was abolished in the United Kingdom in part because of the case of [[Timothy Evans]], an innocent man who was hanged in 1950.]]
{{Main|Wrongful execution}}

It is frequently argued that capital punishment leads to [[miscarriage of justice]] through the wrongful execution of innocent persons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?did=412&scid=6|title=Innocence and the Death Penalty|publisher=Deathpenaltyinfo.org|accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref> Many people have been proclaimed innocent victims of the death penalty.<ref>[http://capitaldefenseweekly.com/innocent.html Capital Defense Weekly<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{Dead link|date=August 2010}} {{Wayback|df=yes|url=http://capitaldefenseweekly.com/innocent.html|date=20070804222621|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justicedenied.org/executed.htm|title=Executed Innocents|publisher=Justicedenied.org|accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mitglied.lycos.de/PeterWill/penal9.htm|title=Wrongful executions|publisher=Mitglied.lycos.de|accessdate=23 August 2010}}{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref>

Some have claimed that as many as 39 executions have been carried out in the face of compelling evidence of innocence or serious doubt about guilt in the US from 1992 through 2004. Newly available [[DNA evidence]] prevented the pending execution of more than 15 [[death row]] inmates during the same period in the US,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.innocenceproject.org/Content/575.php|title=The Innocence Project – News and Information: Press Releases|publisher=Innoccenceproject.org|accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref> but DNA evidence is only available in a fraction of capital cases.<ref name="CB2">{{cite web|last=Lundin|first=Leigh|title=Casey Anthony Trial– Aftermath|url=http://criminalbrief.com/?p=17459|work=Capital Punishment|publisher=Criminal Brief|location=Orlando|date=10 July 2011|quote=With 400 condemned on death row, Florida is an extremely aggressive death penalty state, a state that will even execute for drug trafficking.}}</ref> However, since the death penalty reinstatement in the United States during the 1970s, no inmate executed has been granted posthumous pardon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/executed-possibly-innocent#also|title=Executed But Possibly Innocent &#124; Death Penalty Information Center|publisher=Deathpenaltyinfo.org|accessdate=30 April 2012}}</ref>

Improper procedure may also result in unfair executions. For example, [[Amnesty International]] argues that in [[Singapore]] "the [[Misuse of Drugs Act (Singapore)|Misuse of Drugs Act]] contains a series of presumptions which shift the burden of proof from the prosecution to the accused. This conflicts with the universally guaranteed right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty".<ref>Amnesty International, [http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engasa360012004 "Singapore – The death penalty: A hidden toll of executions"] (January 2004) {{wayback|url=http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engasa360012004 |date=20150501130132 }}</ref> This refers to a situation when someone is being caught with drugs. In this situation, in almost any jurisdiction, the prosecution has a [[prima facie]] case.

===Racial, ethnic and social class bias===
Opponents of the death penalty argue that this punishment is being used more often against perpetrators from racial and ethnic minorities and from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, than against those criminals who come from a privileged background; and that the background of the victim also influences the outcome.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/death-penalty/us-death-penalty-facts/death-penalty-and-race |title=Death Penalty and Race &#124; Amnesty International USA |publisher=Amnestyusa.org |accessdate=11 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eji.org/deathpenalty/racialbias |title=Racial Bias &#124; Equal Justice Initiative |publisher=Eji.org |accessdate=11 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20131514171700/http://www.eji.org/deathpenalty/racialbias |archivedate=1 January 1970 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncadp.org/pages/racial-bias |title=Racial Bias &#124; National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty |publisher=Ncadp.org |date=1999-03-18 |accessdate=2014-07-09}}</ref> Researchers have shown that white Americans are more likely to support the death penalty when told that it is mostly applied to African Americans.<ref name=peffley-2007>{{cite journal|last=Peffley|first=Mark|author2=Hurwitz|title=Jon|journal=American Journal of Political Science|year=2007|volume=51|issue=4|pages=996–1012|url=http://www.unc.edu/~fbaum/teaching/articles/AJPS-20007-Peffley.pdf|accessdate=3 May 2014|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00293.x}}</ref>

Again in 2008, a large majority of states from all regions adopted a second resolution calling for a moratorium on the use of the death penalty in the UN General Assembly (Third Committee) on 20 November. 105 countries voted in favour of the draft resolution, 48 voted against and 31 abstained.

A range of amendments proposed by a small minority of pro-death penalty countries were overwhelmingly defeated. It had in 2007 passed a non-binding resolution (by 104 to 54, with 29 abstentions) by asking its member states for "a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSN1849885920071218|title=U.N.

[[File:04CFREU-Article2-Crop.jpg|thumb|left|Article 2 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] affirms the prohibition on capital punishment in the [[European Union|EU]]]]

A number of regional conventions prohibit the death penalty, most notably, the Sixth Protocol (abolition in time of peace) and the 13th Protocol (abolition in all circumstances) to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. The same is also stated under the Second Protocol in the [[American Convention on Human Rights]], which, however has not been ratified by all countries in the Americas, most notably Canada and the United States. Most relevant operative international treaties do not require its prohibition for cases of serious crime, most notably, the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. This instead has, in common with several other treaties, an optional protocol prohibiting capital punishment and promoting its wider abolition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr-death.htm |title=Second Optional Protocol to the ICCPR |accessdate=8 December 2007 |publisher=Office of the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20071121143327/http://www.ohchr.org:80/english/law/ccpr-death.htm |archivedate=21 November 2007 }}</ref>

Several international organizations have made the abolition of the death penalty (during time of peace) a requirement of membership, most notably the [[European Union]] (EU) and the [[Council of Europe]]. The EU and the Council of Europe are willing to accept a [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] as an interim measure. Thus, while [[Capital punishment in Russia|Russia]] is a member of the Council of Europe, and the death penalty remains codified in its law, it has not made use of it since becoming a member of the Council – Russia has not executed anyone since 1996. With the exception of Russia (abolitionist in practice), [[Kazakhstan]] (abolitionist for ordinary crimes only), and Belarus (retentionist), all European countries are classified as abolitionist.<ref name="amnesty.org"/>

[[Capital punishment in Latvia|Latvia]] abolished ''de jure'' the death penalty for war crimes in 2012, becoming the last EU member to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty/death-sentences-and-executions-in-2012 |title=The Death Penalty in 2012 &#124; Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty.org |date=9 April 2013 |accessdate=11 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20131029232445/http://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty/death-sentences-and-executions-in-2012 |archivedate=29 October 2013 }}</ref>

The [http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=187&CM=&DF=&CL=ENG Protocol no.13] calls for the abolition of the death penalty in all circumstances (including for war crimes). The majority of European countries have signed and ratified it. Some European countries have not done this, but all of them except Belarus and Kazakhstan have now abolished the death penalty in all circumstances (''de jure'', and Russia ''de facto''). Poland is the most recent country to ratify the protocol, on 28 August 2013.<ref>{{cite web|language=Polish|url=http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,114877,14507593,Prezydent_podpisal_ustawy_dot__zniesienia_kary_smierci.html|title=Prezydent podpisał ustawy dot. zniesienia kary śmierci|trans_title=The President signed the Bill. the abolition of the death penalty

[[Turkey]] has recently, as a move towards EU membership, undergone a reform of its legal system. Previously there was a ''de facto'' moratorium on the death penalty in Turkey as the last execution took place in 1984. The death penalty was removed from peacetime law in August 2002, and in May 2004 Turkey amended its constitution in order to remove capital punishment in all circumstances. It ratified Protocol no. 13 to the European Convention on Human Rights in February 2006. As a result, Europe is a continent free of the death penalty in practice, all states but Russia, which has entered a moratorium, having ratified the Sixth Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights, with the sole exception of [[Belarus]], which is not a member of the Council of Europe. The [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] has been lobbying for Council of Europe observer states who practise the death penalty, the U.S. and Japan, to abolish it or lose their observer status. In addition to banning capital punishment for EU member states, the EU has also banned detainee transfers in cases where the receiving party may seek the death penalty.<ref>[[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], and most [[Europe]]an nations except [[Belarus]], Includes [[Albania]], [[Andorra]], [[Armenia]], [[Austria]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Belgium]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[Cyprus]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Iceland]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Israel]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Latvia]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Lithuania]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Malta]], [[Moldova]], [[Monaco]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[San Marino]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[Turkey]], [[Ukraine]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Vatican City]]

The newly created [[South Sudan]] is among the 111 UN member states that supported the resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly that called for the removal of the death penalty, therefore affirming its opposition to the practice. South Sudan, however, has not yet abolished the death penalty and stated that it must first amend its Constitution, and until that happens it will continue to use the death penalty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article46452 |title=South Sudan says death penalty remains until constitution amended – Sudan Tribune: Plural news and views on Sudan |publisher=Sudan Tribune |accessdate=11 February 2014}}</ref>

Among non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Amnesty International and [[Human Rights Watch]] are noted for their opposition to capital punishment. A number of such NGOs, as well as trade unions, local councils and bar associations formed a [[World Coalition Against the Death Penalty]] in 2002.

==Religious views==
{{Main|Religion and capital punishment}}
The world's major religions have mixed opinions on the death penalty, depending on the [[sect]], the individual believer, and the time period.

===Buddhism===
{{further|Religion and capital punishment#Buddhism}}
There is disagreement among Buddhists as to whether or not Buddhism forbids the death penalty. The first of the [[Five Precepts]] (Panca-sila) is to abstain from destruction of life. Chapter 10 of the [[Dhammapada]] states:

<blockquote>Everyone fears punishment; everyone fears death, just as you do. Therefore you do not kill or cause to be killed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/snp/snp.2.14.irel.html|title=Dhammika Sutta: Dhammika|publisher=Accesstoinsight.org|date=11 July 2010|accessdate=30 April 2012}}</ref></blockquote>

Chapter 26, the final chapter of the Dhammapada, states, "Him I call a [[brahmin]] who has put aside weapons and renounced violence toward all creatures. He neither kills nor helps others to kill." These sentences are interpreted by many Buddhists (especially in the West) as an injunction against supporting any legal measure which might lead to the death penalty. However, as is often the case with the interpretation of scripture, there is dispute on this matter. Historically, most states where the official religion is [[Buddhism]] have imposed capital punishment for some offenses. One notable exception is the abolition of the death penalty by the [[Emperor Saga]] of Japan in 818. This lasted until 1165, although in private manors executions continued to be conducted as a form of retaliation. [[Japan]] still imposes the death penalty, although some recent justice ministers have refused to sign death warrants, citing their [[Buddhist]] beliefs as their reason.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7694483.stm|title=Japan hangs two more on death row (see also paragraph 11)|publisher=BBC News|date=28 October 2008|accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref> Other Buddhist-majority states vary in their policy. For example, [[Bhutan]] has abolished the death penalty, but [[Thailand]] still retains it, although [[Buddhism]] is the official religion in both. [[Mongolia]] abolished the death penalty in 2012.

Many stories in Buddhist scripture stress the superior power of the Buddha's teaching to [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitate]] murderers and other criminals. The most well-known example is [[Angulimala]] in the [[Theravada]]n [[Pali canon]] who had killed 999 people and then attempted to kill his own mother and the Buddha, but under the influence of the Buddha he repented and entered the monkhood. The Buddha succeeded when the King and all his soldiers failed to eliminate the murderer by force.<ref>{{cite web|title=Thai Buddhist perspective on the death penalty|url=http://deathpenaltythailand.blogspot.com/2008/07/thai-buddhist-perspective-on-death.html|work=Seminar of Monks at Mahachulalongkorn Buddhist University, Chiangmai|publisher=Death Penalty Thailand}}</ref>

[[File:Mongolian woman condemned to die of starvation (retouched).jpg|thumb|A [[Mongolia]]n woman condemned to die of starvation, c. 1913]]

Without one official teaching on the death penalty, Thai monks are typically divided on the issue with some favoring abolition of the death penalty while others see it as bad karma stemming from bad actions in the past.

In the [[Edicts of Ashoka|edicts]] of the great Buddhist king [[Ashoka]] (ca. 304–232 BC) inscribed on great [[Pillars of Ashoka|pillars]] around his kingdom, the King showed [[Reverence for Life|reverence for all life]] by giving up the slaughtering of animals and many of his subjects followed his example. King Ashoka also extended the period before execution of those condemned to death so they could make a final appeal for their lives.

A close reading of texts in the [[Pali canon]] reveals different attitudes towards violence and capital punishment. The [[Pali]] scholar [http://salc.uchicago.edu/faculty/collins Steven Collins] finds [[Dhamma]] in the Pali canon divided into two categories according to the attitude taken towards violence. In Mode 1 Dhamma the use of violence is "context-dependent and negotiable". A King should not pass judgement in haste or anger but the punishment should fit the crime, with warfare and capital punishment acceptable in certain situations. In Mode 2 Dhamma the use of violence is "context-independent and non-negotiable" and the only advice to kings is to abdicate, renounce the world and leave everything to the law of karma. Buddhism is incompatible with any form of violence especially warfare and capital punishment.

In the world that humans inhabit there is a continual tension between these two modes of Dhamma. This tension is best exhibited in the [http://www.basicbuddhism.org/index.cfm?GPID=29 Cakkavatti Sihanada Sutta] (Digha Nikaya 26 of the Sutta Pitaka of the Pāli Canon), the story of humanity's decline from a golden age in the past. A critical turning point comes when the King decides not to give money to a man who has committed theft but instead to cut off his head and also to carry out this punishment in a particularly cruel and humiliating manner, parading him in public to the sound of drums as he is taken to the execution ground outside the city. In the wake of this decision by the king, thieves take to imitating the King's actions and murder the people from whom they steal to avoid detection. Thieves turn to highway robbery and attacking small villages and towns far away from the royal capital where they won't be detected. A downwards spiral towards social disorder and chaos has begun.

[[Religion and capital punishment#Christianity|Views on the death penalty in Christianity]] run a spectrum of opinions, from complete condemnation of the punishment, seeing it as a form of [[revenge]] and as contrary to Christ's message of [[forgiveness]], to enthusiastic support based primarily on [[Old Testament]] law.

Among the teachings of [[Jesus Christ]] in the [[Gospel of Luke]] and the [[Gospel of Matthew]], the message to his followers that one should "[[Turn the other cheek]]"  and his example in the story ''[[Pericope Adulterae]]'', in which Jesus intervenes in the [[stoning]] of an adulteress, are generally accepted as his condemnation of physical [[Revenge|retaliation]] (though most scholars<ref>{{cite web|title=NETBible: John 7 |publisher=Bible.org |url=http://net.bible.org/bible.php?book=Joh&chapter=7#n139 |accessdate=17 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20070228091803/http://net.bible.org:80/bible.php?book=Joh&chapter=7 |archivedate=28 February 2007 }} See note 139 on that page.</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Keith|first=Chris|title=Recent and Previous Research on the ''Pericope Adulterae'' (John 7.53—8.11)|journal=[[Currents in Biblical Research]]|volume=6|issue=3|pages=377–404|year=2008|doi=10.1177/1476993X07084793|ref=harv}}</ref> agree that the latter passage was "certainly not part of the original text of St John's Gospel"<ref name="Oxford">'Pericope adulterae', in FL Cross (ed.), ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'', (New York: [[Oxford University Press]], 2005).</ref>) More militant Christians consider [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 13:3–4 to support the death penalty. Many Christians have believed that Jesus' doctrine of peace speaks only to personal ethics and is distinct from civil government's duty to punish crime.

In the [[Old Testament]], Leviticus {{Bibleverse||Leviticus|20:2–27}} provides a list of transgressions in which execution is recommended. Christian positions on these passages vary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/exe_bibl2.htm|title=What The Christian Scriptures Say About The Death Penalty – Capital Punishment|publisher=Religioustolerance.org|accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref> The sixth [[Ten Commandments|commandment]] (fifth in the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Lutheran]] churches) is translated as "Thou shalt not kill" by some denominations and as "Thou shalt not murder" by others.

[[Eastern Orthodox]] Christianity does not officially condemn or endorse capital punishment. It states that it is not a totally objectionable thing, but also that its abolition can be driven by genuine Christian values, especially stressing the need for mercy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mospat.ru/en/documents/social-concepts/ix/|title=The Basis of the Social Concept, IX. 3|publisher=Mospat.ru|accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref>

The [[Rosicrucian Fellowship]] and many other [[Esoteric Christianity|Christian esoteric]] schools condemn capital punishment in all circumstances.<ref>Heindel, Max (1910s), ''The Rosicrucian Philosophy in Questions and Answers – Volume II: [http://www.rosicrucian.com/2qa/2qaeng02.htm#question33 Question no.33: Rosicrucian Viewpoint of Capital Punishment]'', ISBN 0-911274-90-1</ref><ref>The Rosicrucian Fellowship: ''[http://www.rosicrucian.com/zineen/pamen032.htm Obsession, Occult Effects of Capital Punishment]''</ref>

====Roman Catholic Church====
{{further|Religion and capital punishment#Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church and capital punishment}}
[[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]], a [[Doctor of the Church#Catholicism|Doctor]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]], accepted the death penalty as a deterrent and prevention method but not as a means of vengeance. (See [[Thought of Thomas Aquinas#Death penalty|Aquinas on the death penalty]].) The [[Roman Catechism]] stated this teaching thus:

<blockquote>Another kind of lawful slaying belongs to the civil authorities, to whom is entrusted power of life and death, by the legal and judicious exercise of which they punish the guilty and protect the innocent. The just use of this power, far from involving the crime of murder, is an act of paramount obedience to this Commandment which prohibits murder. The end of the Commandment is the preservation and security of human life. Now the punishments inflicted by the civil authority, which is the legitimate avenger of crime, naturally tend to this end, since they give security to life by repressing outrage and violence.

In [[Evangelium Vitae]], [[Pope John Paul II]] suggested that capital punishment should be avoided unless it is the only way to defend society from the offender in question, opining that punishment "ought not go to the extreme of executing the offender except in cases of absolute necessity: in other words, when it would not be possible otherwise to defend society. Today however, as a result of steady improvements in the organization of the penal system, such cases are very rare, if not practically non-existent."<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/edocs/ENG0141/__PP.HTM Papal encyclical, Evangelium Vitae], 25 March 1995 {{wayback|url=http://www.vatican.va/edocs/ENG0141/__PP.HTM |date=20121012045724 }}</ref> The most recent edition of the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] restates this view.<ref>Assuming that the guilty party's identity and responsibility have been fully determined, the traditional teaching of the Church does not exclude recourse to the death penalty, if this is the only possible way of effectively defending human lives against the unjust aggressor.</ref> That the assessment of the contemporary situation advanced by John Paul II is not binding on the faithful was confirmed by [[Cardinal Ratzinger]] when he wrote in 2004 that,

<blockquote>if a Catholic were to be at odds with the [[Pope|Holy Father]] on the application of capital punishment or on the decision to wage war, he would not for that reason be considered unworthy to present himself to receive Holy Communion. While the Church exhorts civil authorities to seek peace, not war, and to exercise discretion and mercy in imposing punishment on criminals, it may still be permissible to take up arms to repel an aggressor or to have recourse to capital punishment. There may be a legitimate diversity of opinion even among Catholics about waging war and applying the death penalty, but not however with regard to abortion and euthanasia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.priestsforlife.org/magisterium/bishops/04-07ratzingerommunion.htm|title=Abortion – Pro Life – Cardinal Ratzinger on Voting, Abortion, and Worthiness to Receive Holy Communion|publisher=Priestsforlife.org|accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref></blockquote>

The 1911 edition of the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] suggested that Catholics must hold that "the infliction of capital punishment is not contrary to the teaching of the Catholic Church, and the power of the State to visit upon culprits the penalty of death derives much authority from revelation and from the writings of theologians", but that the matter of "the advisability of exercising that power is, of course, an affair to be determined upon other and various considerations."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12565a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Capital Punishment (Death Penalty)|publisher=Newadvent.org|date=1 June 1911|accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref>

====Protestants====
Southern Baptists support the fair and equitable use of capital punishment for those guilty of murder or treasonous acts, so long as it does not constitute as an act of personal revenge or discrimination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sbc.net/resolutions/amResolution.asp?ID=299|title=SBC Resolution: On Capital Punishment|accessdate=26 October 2010|publisher=Southern Baptist Convention}}</ref>

The [[Lambeth Conference]] of [[Anglican]] bishops condemned the death penalty in 1988:

{{Quote|This Conference: ... 3. Urges the Church to speak out against: ... (b) all governments who practise capital punishment, and encourages them to find alternative ways of sentencing offenders so that the divine dignity of every human being is respected and yet justice is pursued;....<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambethconference.org/resolutions/1988/1988-33.cfm|title=Lambeth Conference of Anglican Bishops, 1988, Resolution 33, paragraph 3.

The [[United Methodist Church]], along with other [[Methodist]] churches, also condemns capital punishment, saying that it cannot accept retribution or social vengeance as a reason for taking human life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.umc.org/interior_print.asp?ptid=4&mid=1070|title=The United Methodist Church: Capital Punishment|publisher=Archives.umc.org|accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref> The Church also holds that the death penalty falls unfairly and unequally upon marginalised persons including the poor, the uneducated, ethnic and religious minorities, and persons with mental and emotional illnesses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=1&mid=2211|title=The United Methodist Church: Official church statements on capital punishment|publisher=Archives.umc.org|date=6 November 2006|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref> The [[General conference (United Methodist Church)|General Conference of the United Methodist Church]] calls for its [[bishop]]s to uphold opposition to capital punishment and for governments to enact an immediate moratorium on carrying out the death penalty sentence.

In a 1991 social policy statement, the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America|ELCA]] officially took a stand to oppose the death penalty. It states that revenge is a primary motivation for capital punishment policy and that true healing can only take place through repentance and forgiveness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elca.org/socialstatements/deathpenalty/ |title=ELCA Social Statement on the Death Penalty |publisher=Elca.org |date=4 September 1991 |accessdate=23 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100804080643/http://www.elca.org:80/socialstatements/deathpenalty/ |archivedate=4 August 2010 }}</ref>

[[Community of Christ]], the former Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS), is opposed to capital punishment. The first stand against capital punishment was taken by the church's [[Presiding High Council]] in 1995. This was followed by a resolution of the [[World Conference (Community of Christ)|World Conference]] in 2000. This resolution, WC 1273, states: {{Quote|[W]e stand in opposition to the use of the death penalty; and ... as a peace church we seek ways to achieve healing and restorative justice. Church members are encouraged to work for the abolition of the death penalty in those states and nations that still practise this form of punishment.<ref>{{cite web|author=Communication Services of Community of Christ, Independence Mo. |url=http://www.cofchrist.org/peace/statements/cptlpunish.asp |title=RLDS World Conference, Resolution 1273, Adopted 8 April 2000, entitled "Healing Ministry and Capital Punishment" |publisher=Cofchrist.org |date=8 April 2000 |accessdate=14 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120505113238/http://www.cofchrist.org/peace/statements/cptlpunish.asp |archivedate=5 May 2012 }}</ref>}}

Several key leaders early in the [[Protestant Reformation]], including [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]], followed the traditional reasoning in favour of capital punishment, and the [[Lutheran Church]]'s [[Augsburg Confession]] explicitly defended it. Some Protestant groups have cited [[s:Bible (World English)/Genesis#Chapter 9|Genesis 9:5–6]], [[s:Bible (World English)/Romans#Chapter 13|Romans 13:3–4]], and
[[s:Bible (World English)/Leviticus#Chapter 20|Leviticus 20:1–27]] as the basis for permitting the death penalty.<ref>{{Wayback |df=yes|date=20060915114705 |url=http://www.equip.org/free/CP1303.htm }}</ref><ref>{{Wayback |df=yes|date=20061214111249 |url=http://www.equip.org/free/CP1304.htm }}</ref>

[[Mennonites]], [[Church of the Brethren]] and [[Religious Society of Friends|Friends]] have opposed the death penalty since their founding, and continue to be strongly opposed to it today. These groups, along with other Christians opposed to capital punishment, have cited [[Christ]]'s [[Sermon on the Mount]] (transcribed in [[s:Bible (World English)/Matthew#Chapter 5|Matthew Chapter 5–7]]) and [[Sermon on the Plain]] (transcribed in [[s:Bible (World English)/Luke#Chapter 6|Luke 6:17–49]]). In both sermons, Christ tells his followers to [[turn the other cheek]] and to love their enemies, which these groups believe mandates [[nonviolence]], including opposition to the death penalty.

The [[Church of Scotland]] considers that capital punishment is unacceptable and does not provide an answer for even the most serious crimes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/speak_out/social_issues/criminal_justice|title=The Church of Scotland|work=churchofscotland.org.uk}}</ref>

In 2015, a large association representing over 30 U.S. protestant denominations<ref name=About_NAE>{{cite web|title=About NAE|url=http://nae.net/about-nae/|website=nae.net|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref> ceased promoting a pro-death penalty stance and announced its affirmation of Christians who oppose the death penalty as well as those who support it, and also affirmed both sides' ethical reasoning in doing so.<ref name=Evangelicals_Soften>{{cite news|last1=Markoe|first1=Lauren|title=Evangelicals soften death penalty stance|url=http://www.religionnews.com/2015/10/20/evangelicals-soften-death-penalty-stance/|accessdate=26 October 2015|work=Religion News Service|date=20 October 2015}}</ref><ref name=NAE_2015>{{cite web|last1=National Association of Evangelicals|title=Resolution: Capital Punishment 2015|url=http://nae.net/capital-punishment-2/|website=NAE.net|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref>

====Mormonism====
{{See also|Religion and capital punishment#Mormonism}}
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] neither supports nor opposes capital punishment, although the church's founder, [[Joseph Smith]], supported it.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Roberts|editor-first=B.

===Hinduism===
{{see also|Religion and capital punishment#Hinduism}}
A basis can be found in [[Hinduism|Hindu teachings]] both for permitting and forbidding the death penalty. Hinduism preaches ''[[ahimsa]]'' (or ''ahinsa'', non-violence), but also teaches that the soul cannot be killed and death is limited only to the physical body. The soul is reborn into another body upon death (until [[Moksha]]), akin to a human changing clothes. The religious, civil and criminal law of Hindus is encoded in the [[Dharmaśāstra]]s and the [[Arthasastra]]. The Dharmasastras describe many crimes and their punishments and call for the death penalty in several instances, including murder and righteous warfare.<ref>http://www.indologica.com/volumes/vol17-18/vol17-18_art16_SASSARMA.pdf</ref>

===Islam===
{{see also|Religion and capital punishment#Islam}}
[[File:Execution of a Moroccan Jewess by Alfred Dehodencq.jpg|"Execution of a Moroccan Jewess ([[Sol Hachuel]])" a painting by [[Alfred Dehodencq]]|thumb]]
[[Sharia]], the religious law in Islam, requires capital punishment for certain crimes.<ref name=elawa/><ref name=smz>Samuel M. Zwemer, The law of Apostasy, The Muslim World
Volume 14, Issue 4, pp. 373–391</ref> For example, the Quran states,

{{quotation|The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger, and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is: execution, or crucifixion, or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides, or exile from the land: that is their disgrace in this world, and a heavy punishment is theirs in the Hereafter.| Qur'an, Sura 5, [[Ayah|ayat]] 33<ref>{{cite quran|5|33|s=ns}}</ref>}}

Similarly, capital punishment by stoning for [[zina]] (extramarital sex) is prescribed in [[Hadith]]s, the books most trusted in Islam after Quran, particularly in ''Kitab Al-Hudud''.<ref name=zmh>Z. Mir-Hosseini (2011), Criminalizing sexuality: zina laws as violence against women in Muslim contexts, Int'l Journal on Human Rights, 15, 7–16</ref><ref>Ziba Mir-Hosseini (2001), Marriage on Trial: A Study of Islamic Family Law, ISBN 978-1860646089, pp. 140–223</ref>

{{quotation|'Ubada b. as-Samit reported: Allah's Messenger as saying: Receive teaching from me, receive teaching from me. Allah has ordained a way for those women. When an unmarried male commits adultery with an unmarried female, they should receive one hundred lashes and banishment for one year. And in case of married male committing adultery with a married female, they shall receive one hundred lashes and be '''stoned to death'''.|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|17|4191}}}}

{{quotation|Allah's Messenger awarded the punishment of stoning to death to the married adulterer and adulteress and, after him, we also awarded the punishment of stoning, I am afraid that with the lapse of time, the people may forget it and may say: We do not find the punishment of stoning in the Book of Allah, and thus go astray by abandoning this duty prescribed by Allah. Stoning is a duty laid down in Allah's Book for married men and women who commit adultery when proof is established, or if there is pregnancy, or a confession.|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|17|4194}}}}

In the four primary schools of [[Sunni]] [[fiqh]] (Islamic jurisprudence) and the two primary schools of [[Shi'a]] fiqh, certain types of crimes mandate capital punishment. Certain [[hudud]] crimes, for example, are considered crimes against Allah and require capital punishment in public.<ref name=elawa>Mohamed El-Awa (1993), Punishment in Islamic Law, American Trust Publications, ISBN 978-0892591428, pp 1–68</ref> These include [[Apostasy in Islam|apostasy]] (leaving Islam to become an atheist or convert to another religion such as Christianity),<ref name=aromar/><ref name=dforte>David Forte, [http://www.cepos.eu/pdf/revista%20de%20stiinte%20politice%20nr%2029.pdf Islam's Trajectory], Revue des Sciences Politiques, No. 29 (2011), pages 92–101</ref> [[fasad]] (mischief in the land, or moral corruption against Allah, social disturbance and creating disorder within the Muslim state)<ref>Oliver Leaman (2013), Controversies in Contemporary Islam, Routledge, ISBN 978-0415676137, Chapter 9</ref><ref>Marion Katz (2006), Corruption of the Times and the Mutability of the Shari'a, The. Cardozo Law Review, 28:171–188</ref> and [[zina]] (consensual heterosexual or homosexual relations not allowed by Islam).<ref name=zmh/>

{{quotation|The right to be convinced and to convert from Islam to another religion is held by only a minority of Muslim scholars. This view of religious freedom is, however, not shared by the vast majority of Muslim scholars both past as well as present.

[[Qisas]] is another category of sentencing where sharia permits capital punishment, for intentional or unintentional murder.<ref>Mohamed El-Awa (1993), Punishment in Islamic Law, American Trust Publications, ISBN 978-0892591428</ref> In the case of death, sharia gives the murder victim's nearest relative or [[Wali]] ({{large|ولي}}) a right to, if the court approves, take the life of the killer.<ref>Encyclopædia Britannica, [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/485784/qisas Qisas] (2012)</ref><ref>Shahid M. Shahidullah, Comparative Criminal Justice Systems: Global and Local Perspectives, ISBN 978-1449604257, pp. 370–377</ref>

{{quotation|O ye who believe! the law of equality is prescribed to you in cases of murder: the free for the free, the slave for the slave, the woman for the woman. But if any remission is made by the brother of the slain, then grant any reasonable demand, and compensate him with handsome gratitude, this is a concession and a Mercy from your Lord. After this whoever exceeds the limits shall be in grave penalty.|{{cite quran|2|178|style=nosup}}}}

Further, in case of Qisas-related capital punishment, sharia offers the victim's guardian the option of [[Diyya]] (monetary compensation).<ref name=britannica/> In several Islamic countries such as Sunni [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Pakistan]], as well as Shia [[Iran]], both hudud and qisas type capital punishment is part of the legal system and in use. In others, there is variation in the use of capital punishment.

Capital punishment for [[apostasy in Islam]] and [[Rajm|stoning to death in Islam]] are controversial topics. Similarly, the discriminatory option between capital punishment and monetary compensation for crimes such as murder is controversial, where jurists have asked if poor offenders face trial and capital punishment while wealthy offenders avoid even a trial by paying off Qisas compensation.<ref>[http://tribune.com.pk/story/612946/shahzeb-khan-murder-sc-delays-qisas-hearing-by-10-days/ "Qisas being used by the wealthy to avoid trial: CJ"]. ''The Express Tribune'' (Pakistan), 3 October 2013 (concerning the [[murder of Shahzeb Khan]]).</ref> Another historic and continuing controversy is the discrimination between the death of a Muslim and a non-Muslim [[dhimmi]], as well as discrimination between the death of a man and a woman, used in sharia-ruled states. Woman's life is considered half the worth of a man, while Christians and Jews are worth half of a Muslim, and the life of Buddhist, Hindu, folk religion or atheist is considered 1/16th the worth of a Muslim.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20110724130457/http://www.cgijeddah.com/cgijed/Welfare/deathbooklet.htm I.

Retrieved on 3 September 2010.</ref> This has led certain Islamic nations to discriminate between Muslims and non-Muslims while imposing capital punishment and compensation, for both intentional murder and manslaughter, depending on whether the victim is Muslim or non-Muslim, as well as based on the religion of the individual who has committed the crime.<ref>[http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/171744.pdf Saudi Arabia] U.S. State Department (2012)</ref>

Lethal stoning and [[beheading]] in public under sharia is controversial for being a cruel form of capital punishment.<ref>Ebbe, O. N., & Odo, I.

===Judaism===
{{main|Judaism and capital punishment}}
The official teachings of [[Judaism]] approve the death penalty in principle but the standard of proof required for application of death penalty is extremely stringent. In practice, it has been abolished by various Talmudic decisions, making the situations in which a death sentence could be passed effectively impossible and hypothetical. A capital case could not be tried by a normal ''[[Beit Din]]'' of three judges, it can only be adjudicated by a ''[[Sanhedrin]]'' of a minimum of 23 judges.<ref>[[Mishnah]] [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] [[s:Mishnah/Seder Nezikin/Tractate Sanhedrin/Chapter 1/4|1:4]]; [[Babylonian Talmud]] Sanhedrin [[s:he:סנהדרין ב א|2a]]</ref> Forty years before the destruction of the [[Second Temple|Temple in Jerusalem]] in approximately the year 70 CE,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ou.org/judaism-101/bios/leaders-in-the-talmudic-period/rabbi-yochanan-ben-zakkai/|title=Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai|accessdate=12 August 2015}}</ref> i.e. in approximately 30 CE, the Sanhedrin effectively abolished capital punishment,<ref>Babylonian Talmud (Sanhedrin [[s:he:סנהדרין מא א|41a]])</ref> making it a hypothetical upper limit on the severity of punishment, fitting in finality for God alone to use, not fallible people.

The 12th-century Jewish legal scholar, [[Maimonides]] said:

: "It is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent one to death."<ref name="Goldstein(Rabbi.)2006">{{cite book|last=Goldstein|first=Warren|authorlink=Warren Goldstein|title=Defending the human spirit: Jewish law's vision for a moral society|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uuizffmvKqQC&pg=PA269|accessdate=22 October 2010|year=2006|publisher=Feldheim Publishers|isbn=978-1-58330-732-8|page=269}}</ref>

Maimonides argued that executing a defendant on anything less than absolute certainty would lead to a slippery slope of decreasing burdens of proof, until we would be convicting merely "according to the judge's caprice". Maimonides was concerned about the need for the law to guard itself in public perceptions, to preserve its majesty and retain the people's respect.<ref>Moses Maimonides, ''The Commandments, Neg. Comm. 290'', at 269–271 (Charles B. Chavel trans., 1967).</ref>

The state of [[Israel]] retains the death penalty only for Nazis convicted of crimes against humanity.<ref name="Giventhat">Given that nearly all surviving Nazi perpetrators of the [[Shoah]] are in their 80s or 90s, it seems unlikely that there will any more executions.</ref> The only execution in Israeli history occurred in 1961, when [[Adolf Eichmann]], one of the principal organizers of the [[Holocaust]], was put to death after his trial in [[Jerusalem]].
