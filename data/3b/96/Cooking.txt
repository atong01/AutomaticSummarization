'''Cooking''' or '''cookery''' is the [[art]] of preparing [[food]] for consumption with the use of heat. Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely across the [[Earth|world]], reflecting unique environmental, economic, and cultural traditions and trends. The way that cooking takes place also depends on the skill and type of training an individual cook has. Cooking can also occur through chemical reactions without the presence of heat, most notably with [[ceviche]], a traditional South American dish where fish is cooked with the acids in lemon or lime juice.

[[Pyrolysis#Cooking|Preparing food with heat or fire]] is an activity unique to humans, and scientists believe the [[Control of fire by early humans|advent of cooking]] played an important role in human [[evolution]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/02/090213-human-diet-cooking.html |title=Cooking Gave Humans Edge Over Apes? |author=Christine Dell'Amore in Chicago|date=13 February 2009 |publisher=National Geographic News }}</ref> Most anthropologists believe that cooking fires first developed around 250,000 years ago. The expansion of agriculture, commerce, trade and transportation between civilizations in different regions offered cooks many new ingredients. New inventions and technologies, such as [[pottery]] for holding and boiling water, expanded cooking techniques. Some modern cooks apply advanced scientific techniques to food preparation to further enhance the flavour of the dish served.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=a-new-spin-on-cooking |title=A New Spin on Cooking |author=W.

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, food was a [[classic marker]] in Europe. In the nineteenth-century "[[Age of Nationalism]]" cuisine became a defining symbol of national identity. Communication between the Old World and the New World influenced the history of food because of the movement of foods from and to Europe, such as potatoes, tomatoes, corn, yams, and beans. Settler food in America reflected traditions adapted from Europe, but up until the end of this{{which|date=November 2014}} century, the presence of new ingredients along with the contact between diverse ethnic groups influenced experimentation. [[Industrial Revolution|Industrialization]] also marks a turning point that changed how food affected the nation{{which|date=November 2014}}.

The period of industrialization saw the beginnings of the mass-production, mass-marketing and standardization of food. Factories processed, preserved, canned, and packaged a wide variety of foods, and processed cereals quickly became a defining feature of the American breakfast.<ref>[http://www.nordion.com/documents/the-history-of-food-irradiation.pdf ] {{wayback|url=http://www.nordion.com/documents/the-history-of-food-irradiation.pdf |date=20131116012256 }}</ref> In the 1920s, [[frozen food|freezing methods]] as well as early [[cafeteria]]s and [[Fast-food restaurant|fast-food establishment]]s emerged. At this time processed and nationally distributed foods became a huge part of the nation's{{which|date=November 2014}} diet.

Along with changes in food, several changes in nutritional guidelines have occurred. Since 1916 the United States government has issued several different nutrition guidelines, eventually leading up to the [[Food pyramid (nutrition)|food pyramid]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/health/food-pyramid/|title=The history of the food pyramid|publisher=Washington Post|date=31 January 2011|accessdate=18 April 2013}}</ref> (introduced in Sweden in 1974). In 1916, "Food For Young Children" along with its sequel for adults, "How to Select Foods" was the first USDA guide to give specific dietary guidelines. Updated in the 1920s, these guides gave shopping suggestions for different-sized families along with a Depression Era revision which included four cost levels. In 1943, the USDA created the "Basic Seven" chart to make sure that people got the recommended nutrients. It included the first-ever Recommended Daily Allowances from the National Academy of Sciences. In 1956, the "Essentials of an Adequate Diet" brought recommendations which cut seven down to four groups that school children would learn about for decades. In 1979, a guide called "Food" was published, which addressed the link between too much of certain foods and chronic diseases. This publication also added "fats, oils, and sweets" to the four basic food groups and cautioned moderation. In 1992, the food pyramid debuted in the United States. The USDA introduced this, which represented proportions of foods in a balanced diet. In 2005, the pyramid got a makeover and was renamed MyPyramid. Lastly, in 2011, "MyPlate" came about.

==Ingredients==
Most ingredients in cooking are derived from [[organism|living organisms]]. Vegetables, fruits, grains and nuts as well as herbs and spices come from plants, while meat, eggs, and dairy products come from animals. Mushrooms and the yeast used in baking are kinds of [[fungi]]. Cooks also use water and minerals such as salt. Cooks can also use [[wine]] or [[Distilled beverage|spirits]].

Naturally occurring ingredients contain various amounts of molecules called ''proteins'', ''carbohydrates'' and ''fats''. They also contain water and minerals. Cooking involves a manipulation of the chemical properties of these molecules.

===Carbohydrates===
{{Main|Carbohydrate}}

Carbohydrates include the common sugar, [[sucrose]] (table sugar), a disaccharide, and such simple sugars as [[glucose]] (from the digestion of table sugar) and [[fructose]] (from fruit), and [[starch]]es from sources such as cereal flour, rice, [[arrowroot]], and potato. The interaction of heat and carbohydrate is complex.

[[Polysaccharide|Long-chain sugars]] such as [[starch]]
tend to break down into [[Monosaccharide|simpler sugars]] when cooked, while simple sugars can form [[syrup]]s. If sugars are heated so that all water of [[crystallisation]] is driven off, then [[caramelization]] starts, with the sugar undergoing thermal decomposition with the formation of [[carbon]], and other breakdown products producing [[caramel]]. Similarly, the heating of sugars and proteins elicits the [[Maillard reaction]], a basic flavor-enhancing technique.

An [[emulsion]] of starch with fat or water can, when gently heated, provide thickening to the dish being cooked. In European cooking, a mixture of butter and flour called a [[roux]] is used to thicken liquids to make stews or sauces. In Asian cooking, a similar effect is obtained from a mixture of rice or [[corn starch]] and water. These techniques rely on the properties of starches to create simpler mucilaginous [[saccharide]]s during cooking, which causes the familiar thickening of [[sauce]]s. This thickening will break down, however, under additional heat.

===Fats===
{{Main|Fat}}
[[File:Frying doughnuts.jpg|thumb|[[Doughnut]]s frying in oil]]
Types of fat include [[vegetable oil]]s, animal products such as butter and [[lard]], as well as fats from grains, including [[corn]] and [[flax]] oils. Fats can reach temperatures higher than the boiling point of water, and are often used to conduct high heat to other ingredients, such as in frying or sautéing.

===Proteins===
{{Main|Protein (nutrient)}}

Edible animal material, including [[muscle]], [[offal]], milk, [[egg (food)|eggs]] and [[egg white]]s, contains substantial amounts of protein. Almost all vegetable matter (in particular [[legume]]s and [[seed]]s) also includes proteins, although generally in smaller amounts. Mushrooms have high protein content. Any of these may be sources of [[essential amino acid]]s. When [[protein]]s are heated they become denatured (unfolded) and change texture. In many cases, this causes the structure of the material to become softer or more [[friable]] – meat becomes ''cooked'' and is more friable and less flexible. In some cases, proteins can form more rigid structures, such as the coagulation of [[albumen]] in egg whites. The formation of a relatively rigid but flexible matrix from egg white provides an important component in baking cakes, and also underpins many desserts based on [[meringue]].

===Water===
{{Main|Water}}

[[Image:Cuisson des pates.jpg|thumb|Water is often used to cook foods such as [[noodle]]s.]]

Cooking often involves water, frequently present in other liquids, which is both added in order to immerse the substances being cooked (typically water, [[stock (food)|stock]] or wine), and released from the foods themselves. A favourite method of adding flavour to dishes is to save the liquid for use in other recipes.  Liquids are so important to cooking that the name of the cooking method used is often based on how the liquid is combined with the food, as in [[steaming]], [[simmer]]ing, [[boiling]], [[braising]], and [[blanching (cooking)|blanching]]. Heating liquid in an open container results in rapidly increased [[evaporation]], which [[concentrate]]s the remaining [[flavor]] and ingredients – this is a critical component of both [[stewing]] and sauce making.  

===Vitamins and minerals===
{{Main|Vitamins|Minerals}}

Vitamins are materials required for normal [[metabolism]] but which the body cannot manufacture itself and which must therefore come from external sources. Vitamins come from several sources including fresh fruit and vegetables ([[Vitamin C]]), carrots, [[Liver (food)|liver]] ([[Vitamin A]]), cereal bran, bread, liver e (B vitamins), fish liver oil ([[Vitamin D]]) and fresh green vegetables ([[Vitamin K]]). Many minerals are also essential in small quantities including iron, [[calcium]], [[magnesium]] and [[sulphur]]; and in very small quantities copper, [[zinc]] and [[selenium]]. The micronutrients, minerals, and vitamins<ref>[http://www.brighthub.com/health/diet-nutrition/articles/44825.aspx Loss of nutrients when vegetables are cooked]</ref> in fruit and vegetables may be destroyed or eluted by cooking. Vitamin C is especially prone to oxidation during cooking and may be completely destroyed by protracted cooking.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/359175.stm |work=BBC News | title=Cooking vegetables 'improves benefits' | date=2 June 1999 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=February 2013}}The bioavailability of some vitamins such as [[thiamin]], [[vitamin B6]], [[niacin]], [[folate]], and [[carotenoids]] are increased with cooking by being freed from the food microstructure.<ref>Hotz, Christine, and Rosalind S. Gibson. "Traditional food-processing and preparation practices to enhance the bioavailability of micronutrients in plant-based diets." The Journal of nutrition 137.4 (2007): 1097-1100.</ref>  Blanching or steaming vegetables is a way of minimizing vitamin and mineral loss in cooking.

==Methods==
[[File:Propane smoker.jpg|thumb|upright|A diagram of a propane smoker used to prepare [[Smoking (cooking)|smoked foods]]]]
{{see also|List of cooking techniques}}
There are very many methods of cooking, most of which have been known since antiquity. These include baking, roasting, frying, grilling, barbecuing, smoking, boiling, steaming and braising. A more recent innovation is microwaving. Various methods use differing levels of heat and moisture and vary in cooking time. The method chosen greatly affects the end result because some foods are more appropriate to some methods than others. Some major hot cooking techniques include:

;Frying
: [[Frying|Fry]] – [[Deep frying]] – [[Hot salt frying]] – [[Hot sand frying]] – [[Pan frying]] – [[Pressure frying]] – [[Sautéing]] – [[Stir frying]]
;Steaming
: [[Steaming]] works by boiling water continuously, causing it to vaporise into steam; the steam then carries heat to the nearby food, thus cooking the food.  By many it is considered a healthy form of cooking, holding nutrients within the vegetable or meat being cooked. 
;Smoking
: [[Smoking (food)|Smoking]] is the process of flavoring, cooking, or preserving food by exposing it to smoke from burning or smoldering material, most often wood.

==Cooking and health==

===Food safety===
{{Main|Food safety}}

Cooking can prevent many [[foodborne illness]]es that would otherwise occur if the food was eaten raw. When heat is used in the preparation of food, it can kill or inactivate harmful organisms, such as bacteria and viruses, as well as various parasites such as [[tapeworm]]s and ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]''. [[Food poisoning]] and other illness from uncooked or poorly prepared food may be caused by bacteria such as [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|pathogenic strains]] of ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Salmonella typhimurium]]'' and ''[[Campylobacter]]'', viruses such as [[norovirus]]es, and [[protozoa]] such as ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]''. Parasites may be introduced through salad, meat that is uncooked or done [[Temperature (meat)|rare]], and unboiled water.

The [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilizing]] effect of cooking depends on temperature, cooking time, and technique used. However, some bacteria such as ''[[Clostridium botulinum]]'' or ''[[Bacillus cereus]]'' can form spores that survive cooking, which then germinate and regrow after the food has cooled. It is therefore recommended that cooked food should not be reheated more than once to avoid repeated growths that allow the bacteria to proliferate to dangerous level.<ref>[http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/_srcfiles/complete_safefood.pdf Safe Food Australia – A Guide to the Food Safety Standards]</ref>

Cooking also increases the digestibility of some foods because many foods, such as grains, are inedible when raw, and some are poisonous. For example, [[kidney bean]]s are toxic when raw or improperly cooked due to the presence of [[phytohaemagglutinin]], which can be inactivated after cooking for at least ten minutes at 100&nbsp;°C.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Noah ND, Bender AE, Reaidi GB, Gilbert RJ |title=NEWS, NOTES, AND EPIDEMIOLOGY |journal=Br Med J |volume=281 |issue=6234 |pages=236–7 |date=July 1980 |pmid=7407532 |doi=10.1136/bmj.281.6234.235 |pmc=1713670}}</ref> A [[slow cooker]] however may not reach the desired temperature and cases of poisoning from red beans cooked in a slow cooker have been reported.

Other considerations for food safety in cooking include the preparation, handling, and storage of food. According to the USDA, the temperature range from {{convert|40|to|140|F|C}} is the "[[Danger zone (food safety)|Danger zone]]" where bacteria is likely to proliferate, and food therefore should not be stored in this temperature range. Washing of hands and surfaces, especially when handling different meats, and keeping raw food separate from cooked food to avoidance of cross-contamination are good practices in food safety.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Factsheets/Basics_for_Handling_Food_Safely/index.asp |title=Basics for Handling Food Safely |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |accessdate=1 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040928210429/http://www.fsis.usda.gov/factsheets/Basics_for_Handling_Food_Safely/index.asp |archivedate=November 28, 2004 }}</ref> Food prepared on plastic cutting boards may be less likely to harbor bacteria than wooden ones,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ag.arizona.edu/pubs/health/foodsafety/az1076.html|title=Cutting Boards (Plastic Versus Wood)|publisher=Cooperative Extension, College of Agriculture & Life Sciences, the University of Arizona|work=Food Safety, Preparation and Storage Tips|year=1998|accessdate=21 June 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060613074257/http://ag.arizona.edu/pubs/health/foodsafety/az1076.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 13 June 2006}}</ref> other research however suggested otherwise.<ref name="ReluctantGourmet">{{cite web|url=http://www.reluctantgourmet.com/cutting_board.htm|title=Cutting Boards – wood or plastic?|work=ReluctantGourmet.com|accessdate=21 June 2006}}</ref> Washing and [[Disinfection|sanitizing]] cutting boards is highly recommended, especially after use with raw meat, poultry, or seafood. Hot water and soap followed by a rinse with a diluted antibacterial cleaner, or a trip through a dishwasher with a "sanitize" cycle, are effective methods for reducing the risk of illness due to contaminated cooking implements.<ref name="ReluctantGourmet"/>

===Effects on nutritional content of food===
{{See also|Raw foodism}}

[[Image:Rawtomatopasta1.jpg|thumb|A raw [[tomato sauce]] with [[olive]]s, [[celery]], [[spinach]] and [[walnut]]s on [[zucchini]] noodles.]]

Proponents of [[raw foodism]] argue that cooking food increases the risk of some of the detrimental effects on food or health. They point out that during cooking of vegetables and fruit containing [[vitamin C]], the vitamin elutes into the cooking water as well as becoming degraded through oxidation. Peeling vegetables can also substantially reduce the vitamin C content, especially in the case of potatoes where most vitamin C is in the skin.<ref>[http://www.potato2008.org/en/potato/factsheets.html Potatoes, nutrition and diet]</ref> However, research has shown that in the specific case of [[carotenoid]]s a greater proportion is absorbed from cooked vegetables than from raw vegetables.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/>

German research in 2003 showed significant benefits in reducing breast cancer risk when large amounts of raw vegetable matter are included in the diet. The authors attribute some of this effect to heat-labile [[phytonutrient]]s.<ref>Nutr Cancer. 2003;46(2):131-7</ref> [[Sulforaphane]], a [[glucosinolate]] breakdown product, which may be found in vegetables such as [[broccoli]], has been shown to be protective against [[prostate cancer]], however, much of it is destroyed when the vegetable is boiled.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Jin | first1 = Y. | last2 = Wang | first2 = M. | last3 = Rosen | first3 = R.

Several studies published since 1990 indicate that cooking meat at high temperature creates [[heterocyclic amine]]s (HCAs), which are thought to increase cancer risk in humans. Researchers at the [[National Cancer Institute]] found that human subjects who ate beef rare or medium-rare had less than one third the risk of stomach cancer than those who ate beef medium-well or well-done.<ref name=amines>{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/heterocyclic-amines |title=Heterocyclic Amines in Cooked Meats |publisher=[[National Cancer Institute]] }}</ref> While avoiding meat or eating meat raw may be the only ways to avoid HCAs in meat fully, the National Cancer Institute states that cooking meat below {{convert|212|F}} creates "negligible amounts" of HCAs.

Research has shown that grilling, barbecuing and smoking meat and fish increases levels of carcinogenic [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAH). In Europe, grilled meat and smoked fish generally only contribute a small proportion of dietary PAH intake since they are a minor component of diet – most intake comes from cereals, oils and fats.<ref name="PAH in diet">{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scf/out154_en.pdf |title=Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons – Occurrence in foods, dietary exposure and health effects |author=Scientific Committee on Food |date=4 December 2002 |publisher=[[European Commission]] |accessdate=21 August 2010}}</ref> However, in the US, grilled/barbecued meat is the second highest contributor of the mean daily intake of a known PAH carcinogen [[benzo(a)pyrene|benzo[a]pyrene]] at 21% after ‘bread, cereal and grain’ at 29%.<ref name="PAH in diet"/>

Baking, grilling or broiling food, especially starchy foods, until a toasted crust is formed generates significant concentrations of [[acrylamide]], a possible [[carcinogen]].<ref>{{cite journal|author = Tareke E, Rydberg P.|title = Analysis of acrylamide, a carcinogen formed in heated foodstuffs|journal = J.

Deep fried food in restaurants may contain high level of [[trans fat]] which is known to increase level of [[low-density lipoprotein]] that may increase risk of [[Coronary disease|heart diseases]] and other conditions. However, many fast food chains have now switched to trans-fat-free alternatives for deep-frying.<ref name="McDs">{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16873869/ |title=McDonald's finally picks trans-fat-free oil |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |date=30 January 2007 |accessdate=13 September 2007}}</ref>

==Science of cooking==
{{main|molecular gastronomy}}

The application of [[scientific knowledge]] to cooking and [[gastronomy]] has become known as [[molecular gastronomy]]. This is a subdiscipline of [[food science]]. Important contributions have been made by scientists, chefs and authors such as [[Herve This]] (chemist), [[Nicholas Kurti]] (physicist), [[Peter Barham]] (physicist), [[Harold McGee]] (author), [[Shirley Corriher]] (biochemist, author), [[Heston Blumenthal]] (chef), [[Ferran Adria]] (chef), [[Robert Wolke]] (chemist, author) and [[Pierre Gagnaire]] (chef).

Chemical processes central to cooking include the [[Maillard reaction]] – a form of non-enzymatic browning involving an amino acid, a reducing sugar and heat.

==Home-cooking and commercial cooking==

Home cooking has traditionally been a process carried out informally in a home or around a [[Communal oven|communal fire]], and can be enjoyed by all members of the family.  Cooking is also often carried out outside of personal quarters, for example at restaurants, or schools. [[Bakery|Bakeries]] were one of the earliest forms of cooking outside the home, and bakeries in the past often offered the cooking of pots of food provided by their customers as an additional service. In the present day, factory food preparation has become common, with many "ready-to-eat" foods being prepared and cooked in factories and home cooks using a mixture of [[wikt:from scratch|scratch made]], and factory made foods together to make a [[meal]].

"Home-cooking" may be associated with [[comfort food]], and some commercially produced foods are presented through advertising or [[packaging]] as having been "home-cooked", regardless of their actual origin.

Commercial cooking methods have evolved to a point where many of the ingredients and techniques used at home are being used in commercial cooking to great success and acceptance by patrons.
