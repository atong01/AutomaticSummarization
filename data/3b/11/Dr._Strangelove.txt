'''''Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb''''', more commonly known as '''''Dr. Strangelove''''', is a 1964 [[political satire]] [[black comedy]] film that satirizes the [[Cold War]] fears of a nuclear conflict between the USSR and the US. The film was directed, produced, and co-written by [[Stanley Kubrick]], stars [[Peter Sellers]] and [[George C. Scott]], and features [[Sterling Hayden]], [[Keenan Wynn]], and [[Slim Pickens]]. Production took place in the United Kingdom. The film is loosely based on [[Peter George (author)|Peter George]]'s [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] novel ''[[Red Alert (novel)|Red Alert]]''.

The story concerns an unhinged [[United States Air Force]] general who orders a [[first strike]] [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear attack]] on the [[Soviet Union]]. It follows the [[President of the United States]], his advisers, the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], and a [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) officer as they try to recall the bombers to prevent a [[nuclear apocalypse]]. It separately follows the crew of one [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] bomber as they try to deliver their payload.

In 1989, the United States [[Library of Congress]] included it in the first group of films selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]]. It was listed as number three on [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs]] list.

==Plot==
[[United States Air Force]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] Jack D. Ripper ([[Sterling Hayden]]) is commander of Burpelson Air Force Base, which houses the [[Strategic Air Command]] 843rd Bomb Wing, equipped with [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] bombers. The 843rd is currently in-flight on airborne alert, a few hours from the Soviet border.

[[File:Dr. Strangelove - Ripper and Mandrake.png|thumb|left|General Ripper explains to Group Captain Mandrake how he first discovered the Communist plot to pollute Americans' "precious bodily fluids."]]

General Ripper orders his [[executive officer#Military|executive officer]], [[Group Captain]] Lionel Mandrake ([[Peter Sellers]]) of the UK [[Royal Air Force]], to put the base on alert. Ripper also issues "Wing Attack Plan R" to the patrolling aircraft, one of which is commanded by Major T. J. "King" Kong ([[Slim Pickens]]). All of the aircraft commence an attack flight on Russia and set their radios to allow communications only through the [[CRM 114 (fictional device)|CRM 114]] discriminator, which is programmed to accept only communications preceded by a secret three-letter code known only to General Ripper.

Mandrake discovers that no war order has been issued by the Pentagon and tries to stop Ripper, who locks them both in his office. Ripper tells Mandrake that he believes the Soviets have been using [[fluoridation]] of the United States' water supplies to pollute the "precious bodily fluids" of Americans; at this point, Mandrake realizes that Ripper is insane.

At the Pentagon, General Buck Turgidson ([[George C. Scott]]) briefs President Merkin Muffley (also Peter Sellers) and other officers and aides about the attack in the "[[Joint War Room|War Room]]". President Muffley is shocked to learn that such orders could be given without his authorization, but Turgidson reminds him that Plan R—enabling a senior officer to launch a strike against the Soviets if all superiors have been killed in a first strike on Washington D.C.—allows such an action. Turgidson reports that his men are trying every possible three-letter CRM code to issue the stand-down order, but that this could take over two days and the planes are due to reach their targets in about an hour. Muffley orders the Army chief to storm the base and arrest General Ripper.

Turgidson attempts to convince Muffley to let the attack continue and use the element of surprise to annihilate the Soviet military altogether before they can strike back; Muffley, however, refuses to be party to a nuclear [[first strike]]. Instead, he brings Soviet ambassador Alexei de Sadeski ([[Peter Bull]]) into the War Room, to telephone [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Soviet premier]] Dimitri Kissov on the "[[Moscow–Washington hotline|hot line]]". Muffley warns the Premier of the impending attack and offers to reveal the planes' positions and targets so that the Russians can protect themselves.

After a heated discussion in Russian with the Premier, the ambassador informs President Muffley that the Soviet Union has created a [[doomsday device]], which consists of many buried [[cobalt bomb|bombs jacketed with "Cobalt-Thorium G"]] connected to a computer network set to detonate them automatically should any nuclear attack strike the country. Within two months after detonation, the Cobalt-Thorium G would encircle the earth in a radioactive cloud, wiping out all human and animal life, rendering the surface of the earth uninhabitable for 93 years. The device cannot be dismantled or "un-triggered", as it is programmed to explode if any such attempt is made. When the President's wheelchair-bound scientific advisor, former [[Nazi]] Dr. Strangelove (again, Peter Sellers), points out that such a doomsday device would only be an effective deterrent if everyone knew about it, de Sadeski replies that the Russian Premier had planned to reveal its existence to the world the following week (on the leader's birthday).

[[File:Dr. Strangelove - Riding the Bomb.png|thumb|Aircraft commander Major T. J. "King" Kong riding the bomb down.]]

Meanwhile, [[United States Army]] forces arrive at Burpelson, which is still sealed by General Ripper's order. A bloody battle ensues, and the Army forces eventually take over the base. Ripper kills himself, fearing he will be tortured into revealing the recall code. A soldier named Colonel "Bat" Guano ([[Keenan Wynn]]) forces his way into Ripper's office, where Mandrake identifies Ripper's CRM code from his desk blotter ("OPE," a variant of both ''Peace on Earth'' and ''Purity of Essence'').<ref name=Kramer>{{cite book|last1=Kramer|first1=Peter|title=Dr. Strangelove or: How I learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=1844577791|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GQkoBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT53&dq=dr+strangelove+ope+recall+code+%22peace+on+earth%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=g9rvVLTxPMadgwTX9oCwDw&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=dr%20strangelove%20ope%20recall%20code%20%22peace%20on%20earth%22&f=false|accessdate=27 February 2015}}</ref> Mandrake relays this code to the Pentagon with difficulty via payphone, the only working method of communication. Using the recall code, SAC successfully recalls most of the aircraft; however, Muffley learns that a [[surface-to-air missile]] has ruptured the fuel tank of Major Kong's plane and destroyed its communications device, making it impossible to recall this particular plane even with the correct recall code. President Muffley tells the Soviets the plane's target to help them find it, but doesn't realize that because of the shortened range of the crippled aircraft, Major Kong has selected a closer target. As the plane approaches the new target, the crew is unable to open the damaged bomb bay doors. Major Kong crimps broken electric wiring, whereupon the doors open. With Kong straddling it, the nuclear bomb falls and detonates, triggering the doomsday machine.

Dr. Strangelove recommends that the President gather several hundred thousand people to live in deep mineshafts where the radiation will not penetrate.  He suggests a 10:1 female-to-male ratio for a breeding program, to repopulate the Earth when the radiation has subsided. Turgidson, worried that the Soviets will do the same, warns about a "mineshaft gap", when the wheel chair bound Strangelove suddenly stands and says "Mein Führer, I can walk!!". The film then cuts to a montage of nuclear detonations, accompanied by [[Vera Lynn]]'s recording of "[[We'll Meet Again]]".

===Peter Sellers's multiple roles===
[[Columbia Pictures]] agreed to finance the film on condition that [[Peter Sellers]] play at least four major roles. This condition stemmed from the studio's opinion that much of the success of Kubrick's previous film ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]'' (1962) was based on Sellers's performance, in which his single character assumes a number of identities. Sellers had also played three roles in ''[[The Mouse That Roared (film)|The Mouse That Roared]]'' (1959). Kubrick accepted the demand, later explaining that "such crass and grotesque stipulations are the ''[[sine qua non]]'' of the motion-picture business."<ref name=Southern/><ref name=Southern2>Lee Hill, [http://www.altx.com/int2/terry.southern.html "Interview with a Grand Guy"]: interview with Terry Southern</ref>

Sellers ended up playing three of the four roles written for him. He had been expected to play Air Force Major T. J. "King" Kong, the [[B-52 Stratofortress]] aircraft commander, but from the beginning Sellers was reluctant. He felt his workload was too heavy and he worried he would not properly portray the character's [[Texas accent]]. Kubrick pleaded with him and asked screenwriter [[Terry Southern]] (who had been raised in Texas) to record a tape with Kong's lines spoken in the correct accent. Using Southern's tape, Sellers managed to get the accent right, and started shooting the scenes in the airplane, but then Sellers sprained an ankle and could not work in the cramped cockpit set.<ref name=Southern/><ref name=Southern2/><ref>In the fictionalized biopic ''[[The Life and Death of Peter Sellers]]'', it is suggested that Sellers faked the injury as a way to force Kubrick to release him from the contractual obligation to play this fourth role.</ref>

Sellers is said to have [[Ad libitum|improvised much of his dialogue]], with Kubrick incorporating the ad-libs into the written screenplay so that the improvised lines became part of the canonical screenplay, a practice known as [[retroscripting]].<ref name=Inside>"Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove," a documentary included with the 40th Anniversary Special Edition DVD of the film</ref><!-- 15m 31s Alexander Walker, 17m 50s Pamela Carlton --> <!-- Vincent LoBrutto's book on Stanley Kubrick? -->

; Group Captain Lionel Mandrake
According to film critic [[Alexander Walker (critic)|Alexander Walker]], the author of biographies of both Sellers and Kubrick, the role of [[Group Captain]] Lionel Mandrake was the easiest of the three for Sellers to play, as he was aided by his experience of mimicking his superiors while serving in the [[RAF]] during [[World War II]].<ref name=Inside/><!-- 15m 58s --> There is also a heavy resemblance to Sellers's friend and occasional co-star [[Terry-Thomas]] and [[prosthetic]]-limbed RAF ace [[Douglas Bader]].

; President Merkin Muffley
For his performance as President Merkin Muffley, Sellers flattened his natural English accent to resemble an American [[Midwestern United States|Midwesterner]]. Sellers drew inspiration for the role from [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]],<ref name=Inside/><!-- 16m 54s, Alexander Walker --> a former [[Illinois]] governor who was the Democratic candidate for the [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952]] and [[United States presidential election, 1956|1956 presidential elections]] and the U.N. ambassador during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].

In early takes, Sellers faked [[common cold|cold]] symptoms to emphasize the character's apparent weakness. This caused frequent laughter among the film crew, ruining several takes. Kubrick ultimately found this comic portrayal inappropriate, feeling that Muffley should be a serious character.<ref name=Inside/><!-- 16m 25s Ken Adam, 16m 54s Alexander Walker --> In later takes Sellers played the role straight, though the President's cold is still evident in several scenes.

In keeping with Kubrick's satirical character names, a "[[merkin]]" is a pubic hair wig. The president is bald, and his last name is "Muffley"; both are additional homages to a merkin.

; Dr. Strangelove
Dr. Strangelove is an ex-[[Nazism|Nazi]] scientist, suggesting [[Operation Paperclip]], the US effort to recruit top German technical talent at the end of World War II.<ref>Dan Geddes, "[http://www.thesatirist.com/films/DoctorStrangelove.html Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964)]"; ''The Satirist'', December 2011.</ref><ref>Beverly Merrill Kelley, ''Reelpolitik II: Political Ideologies in '50s and '60s Films''; Oxford: Rowman & Littlefield, 2004; p. [http://books.google.com/books?id=DgfTlr4ScSIC&pg=PA263#v=onepage&q&f=false 263].</ref> He serves as President Muffley's scientific adviser in the War Room. When General Turgidson wonders aloud what kind of name "Strangelove" is, saying to Mr. Staines ([[Jack Creley]]) that it is not a "[[Kraut]] name," Staines responds that Strangelove's original German surname was "Merkwürdigliebe," without mentioning that "Merkwürdigliebe" translates to "Strangelove" in English. Twice in the film, Strangelove "accidentally" addresses the president as "''Mein Führer''". Dr. Strangelove did not appear in the book ''Red Alert''.<ref>Jeffrey Townsend, et al., 'Red Alert' in John Tibbetts & James Welsh (eds), ''The Encyclopedia of Novels into Films'', New York, 1999, pp. 183–186</ref>

[[Image:JohnvonNeumann-LosAlamos.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[John von Neumann]] proposed the strategy of [[mutual assured destruction]]]]

The character is an amalgamation of [[RAND Corporation]] strategist [[Herman Kahn]], mathematician and [[Manhattan Project]] principal [[John von Neumann]], rocket scientist [[Wernher von Braun]] (a central figure in Nazi Germany's rocket development program recruited to the US after the war), and [[Edward Teller]], the "father of the [[hydrogen bomb]]."<ref>Paul Boyer, 'Dr. Strangelove' in Mark C. Carnes (ed.), ''Past Imperfect: History According to the Movies'', New York, 1996.</ref> There is a common misconception that the character was based on [[Henry Kissinger]], but Kubrick and Sellers denied this;<ref name=moviediva>{{cite web|url=http://www.moviediva.com/MD_root/reviewpages/MDDrStrangelove.htm|title=Dr Strangelove|work=moviediva.com}}</ref> Sellers said, "Strangelove was never modeled after Kissinger—that's a popular misconception.

The wheelchair-bound Strangelove furthers a Kubrick trope of the menacing, seated antagonist, first depicted in ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]'' through the character "Dr. Zaempf."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/836-lolita|title=Lolita|work=The Criterion Collection}}</ref> Strangelove's accent was influenced by that of Austrian-American photographer [[Weegee]], who worked for Kubrick as a special photographic effects consultant.<ref name=Inside/> Strangelove's appearance echoes the mad scientist archetype as seen in the character [[Rotwang]] in [[Fritz Lang]]'s film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927). Sellers's Strangelove takes from Rotwang the single black gloved hand (which in Rotwang's case is mechanical because of a lab accident), the wild hair and, most importantly, his ability to avoid being controlled by political power.<ref>Frayling, Christopher. Mad, Bad, and Dangerous?: The Scientist and the Cinema. London: Reaktion, 2006. p.26</ref> According to film critic [[Alexander Walker (critic)|Alexander Walker]], Sellers improvised Dr. Strangelove's lapse into the [[Nazi salute]], borrowing one of Kubrick's black leather gloves for the uncontrollable hand that makes the gesture. Dr. Strangelove apparently suffers from diagnostic apraxia ([[alien hand syndrome]]). Kubrick wore the gloves on the set to avoid being burned when handling hot lights, and Sellers, recognizing the potential connection to Lang's work, found them to be menacing.<ref name=Inside/>

===Slim Pickens as Major T. J. "King" Kong===
[[File:Dr. Strangelove - Wing Attack Plan R.png|thumb|Capt. "Ace" Owens, Lt. W. D. Kivel, and Major T. J. "King" Kong about to open Wing Attack Plan R.]]
[[Slim Pickens]], an established [[character actor]] and veteran of many Western films, was eventually chosen to replace Sellers as Major Kong after Sellers's injury. Terry Southern's biographer, Lee Hill, said the part was originally written with [[John Wayne]] in mind, and that Wayne was offered the role after Sellers was injured but he immediately turned it down.<ref name=Hill>Lee Hill, ''A Grand Guy: The Life and Art of Terry Southern'' (Bloomsbury, 2001), pp.118–119</ref> [[Dan Blocker]] of the ''[[Bonanza]]'' western television series was approached to play the part, but according to [[Terry Southern|Southern]], Blocker's agent rejected the script as being "too pinko".<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0088779/bio Biography for Dan Blocker] at [[Internet Movie Database]]</ref> Kubrick then recruited Pickens, whom he knew from Pickens's work in [[Marlon Brando]]'s ''[[One-Eyed Jacks]]''.<ref name=Hill/>

Fellow actor [[James Earl Jones]] recalls, "He was Major Kong on and off the set—he didn't change a thing—his temperament, his language, his behavior." Pickens was not told that the movie was a comedy and was only given the script for scenes he was in, to get him to play it "straight".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.phenry.org/movies/movienight/strangelove.php |title=Movie Night! |publisher=Phenry.org |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2010-03-06}}</ref>

Kubrick biographer John Baxter explains, in the documentary ''Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove'':<blockquote>As it turns out, Slim Pickens had never left the United States. He had to hurry and get his first passport. He arrived on the set, and somebody said, "Gosh, he's arrived in costume!", not realizing that that's how he always dressed&nbsp;... with the cowboy hat and the fringed jacket and the cowboy boots—and that he wasn't putting on the character—that's the way he talked.</blockquote>

Pickens, who had previously played only minor supporting and character roles, said his appearance as Maj. Kong greatly improved his career. He later commented, "After ''Dr. Strangelove'' the roles, the dressing rooms and the checks all started getting bigger."<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001620/bio Slim Pickens biography]</ref>

===George C. Scott as General Buck Turgidson===
[[File:Dr. Strangelove - General Buck Turgidson.png|thumb|General Buck Turgidson imitating a low-flying B-52 "frying chickens in a barnyard."]]
Kubrick tricked Scott into playing the role of Gen. Turgidson far more ridiculously than Scott was comfortable doing. Kubrick talked Scott into doing over the top "practice" takes, which Kubrick told Scott would never be used, as a way to warm up for the "real" takes. Kubrick used these takes in the final film, causing Scott to swear never to work with Kubrick again.<ref>{{Cite web|author=James Earl Jones |url=http://atomiccafe.tribe.net/thread/f4a9a3d6-0f96-45c5-83f1-62ff060f2375|title=A Bombardier's Reflection |publisher=Opinionjournal.com |date=2004-11-16 |accessdate=2010-03-06}}</ref>

During the filming, Kubrick and Scott had different opinions regarding certain scenes, but Kubrick got Scott to conform largely by repeatedly beating him at chess, which they played frequently on the set.<ref>[http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.ts.html "Kubrick on The Shining"] from Michel Ciment, 'Kubrick', Holt, Rinehart, and Winston; 1st American ed edition (1983), ISBN 0-03-061687-5</ref> Scott, a skilled player himself, later said that while he and Kubrick may not have always seen eye to eye, he respected Kubrick immensely for his skill at chess.

==Production==

===Novel and screenplay===
[[Stanley Kubrick]] started with nothing but a vague idea to make a thriller about a nuclear accident, building on the widespread [[Cold War]] fear for survival.<ref name=Siano>Brian Siano, [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0017.html "A Commentary on Dr. Strangelove"], 1995</ref> While doing research, Kubrick gradually became aware of the subtle and paradoxical "[[balance of terror]]" between nuclear powers. At Kubrick's request, [[Alastair Francis Buchan|Alastair Buchan]] (the head of the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies|Institute for Strategic Studies]]) recommended the thriller novel ''[[Red Alert (novel)|Red Alert]]'' by [[Peter George (author)|Peter George]].<ref>Alexander Walker, "Stanley Kubrick Directs," Harcourt Brace Co, 1972, ISBN 0-15-684892-9, cited in Brian Siano, [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0017.html "A Commentary on Dr. Strangelove"], 1995</ref> Kubrick was impressed with the book, which had also been praised by [[game theory|game theorist]] and future [[Nobel Prize in Economics]] winner [[Thomas Schelling]] in an article written for the ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]'' and reprinted in ''[[The Observer]],''<ref>Phone interview with Thomas Schelling by Sharon Ghamari-Tabrizi, published in her book ''The Worlds of Herman Kahn; The Intuitive Science of Thermonuclear War'' (Harvard University Press, 2005) [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0097.html "Dr. Strangelove"]</ref> and immediately bought the film rights.<ref name=Southern3>Terry Southern,[http://www.filmmakermagazine.com/fall2004/line_items/strangelove.php "Check-up with Dr. Strangelove"], article written in 1963 for Esquire but unpublished at the time</ref> In 2006, Schelling wrote that conversations between Kubrick, Schelling, and George in late 1960 about a treatment of ''Red Alert'' updated with intercontinental missiles eventually led to the making of the film.<ref>{{cite book |last=Schelling |first=Thomas C. |year=2006 |title=Strategies of Commitment and Other Essays |publisher=Harvard University Press |page=212 |isbn=0-674-02567-9}}</ref>

In collaboration with George, Kubrick started writing a screenplay based on the book. While writing the screenplay, they benefited from some brief consultations with Schelling and, later, [[Herman Kahn]].<ref name=Ghamari-Tabrizi>Sharon Ghamari-Tabrizi, [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0097.html "The Worlds of Herman Kahn; The Intuitive Science of Thermonuclear War"], Harvard University Press, 2005.</ref> In following the tone of the book, Kubrick originally intended to film the story as a serious drama. But, as he later explained during interviews, he began to see comedy inherent in the idea of [[mutual assured destruction]] as he wrote the first draft. Kubrick said:<blockquote>My idea of doing it as a nightmare comedy came in the early weeks of working on the screenplay. I found that in trying to put meat on the bones and to imagine the scenes fully, one had to keep leaving out of it things which were either absurd or paradoxical, in order to keep it from being funny; and these things seemed to be close to the heart of the scenes in question.<ref>''Macmillan International Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers'', vol. 1, p. 126</ref></blockquote>

Among the titles Kubrick considered for the film were ''Dr. Doomsday or: How to Start World War III Without Even Trying'', ''Dr. Strangelove's Secret Uses of Uranus'', and ''Wonderful Bomb''.<ref name="usher20120403">{{cite web | url=http://www.listsofnote.com/2012/04/dr-strangelove.html | title=Dr. Strangelove | work=Lists of Note | date=2012-04-03 | accessdate=April 16, 2012 | author=Usher, Shaun}}</ref> After deciding to make the film a black comedy, Kubrick brought in [[Terry Southern]] as a co-writer. The choice was influenced by reading Southern's comic novel ''[[The Magic Christian (novel)|The Magic Christian]]'', which Kubrick had received as a gift from Peter Sellers,<ref name=Southern>Terry Southern, [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0081.html "Notes from The War Room"], ''Grand Street'', issue #49</ref> and which itself became a Sellers film in 1969.

===Sets and filming===
''Dr. Strangelove'' was filmed at [[Shepperton Studios]], near [[London]], as Sellers was in the middle of a divorce at the time and unable to leave England.<ref name=interview69/> The sets occupied three main [[sound stage]]s: the Pentagon War Room, the B-52 Stratofortress bomber and the last one containing both the motel room and General Ripper's office and outside corridor.<ref name=Southern/> The studio's buildings were also used as the Air Force base exterior. The film's set design was done by [[Ken Adam]], the production designer of several [[James Bond in film|''James Bond'' films]] (at the time he had already worked on ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]''). The [[black and white]] cinematography was by [[Gilbert Taylor]], and the film was edited by [[Anthony Harvey]] and [[Stanley Kubrick]] (uncredited). The original musical score for the film was composed by [[Laurie Johnson]] and the special effects were by Wally Veevers. The theme of the chorus from the bomb run scene is a modification of ''[[When Johnny Comes Marching Home]]''. Sellers and Kubrick got on famously during the film's production and shared a love of photography.<ref>{{citation|author=Duncan, Paul|title=Stanley Kubrick: The Complete Films |publisher=Taschen GmbH|page=95|isbn=978-3-8365-2775-0}}</ref>

[[File:WarRoomModel.DrStrangelove.jpg|thumb|left|Model of the War Room constructed for the film.]]
[[File:Dr. Strangelove - The War Room.png|thumb|left|The War Room with the Big Board.]]

For the War Room, Ken Adam first designed a two-level set which Kubrick initially liked, only to decide later that it was not what he wanted. Adam next began work on the design that was used in the film, an [[expressionism|expressionist]] set that was compared with ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' and [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''. It was an enormous concrete room ({{convert|130|ft|m}} long and {{convert|100|ft|m}} wide, with a {{convert|35|ft|m|sing=on}}-high ceiling<ref name=Southern3/>) suggesting a bomb shelter, with a triangular shape (based on Kubrick's idea that this particular shape would prove the most resistant against an explosion). One side of the room was covered with gigantic strategic maps reflecting in a shiny black floor inspired by the dance scenes in old [[Fred Astaire]] films. In the middle of the room there was a large circular table lit from above by a circle of lamps, suggesting a poker table. Kubrick insisted that the table be covered with green [[baize]] (although this could not be seen in the black and white film) to reinforce the actors' impression that they are playing 'a game of poker for the fate of the world.'<ref name=Adam>"A Kubrick Masterclass," interview with Sir Ken Adam by Sir Christopher Frayling, 2005; excerpts from the interview were published online at [http://www.berlinale-talentcampus.de/www/73/viewentry/118 Berlinale talent capus] and the [http://www.scriptfactory.co.uk/go/WhatWeDo/Extract_285.html Script Factory website]</ref> Kubrick asked Adam to build the set ceiling in [[concrete]] to force the director of photography to use only the on-set lights from the circle of lamps. Moreover, each lamp in the circle of lights was carefully placed and tested until Kubrick was happy with the result.<ref>[http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0082.html Interview with Ken Adam by Michel Ciment], published in Michel Ciment, "Kubrick," Holt, Rinehart, and Winston; 1st American ed edition (1983), ISBN 0-03-061687-5</ref>

Lacking cooperation from [[United States Department of Defense|the Pentagon]] in the making of the film, the set designers reconstructed the aircraft cockpit to the best of their ability by comparing the cockpit of a [[B-29 Superfortress]] and a single photograph of the cockpit of a [[B-52]], and relating this to the geometry of the B-52's fuselage. The B-52 was state-of-the-art in the 1960s, and its cockpit was off-limits to the film crew. When some [[United States Air Force]] personnel were invited to view the reconstructed B-52 cockpit, they said that "it was absolutely correct, even to the little black box which was the CRM."<ref name=Inside/> It was so accurate that Kubrick was concerned whether Ken Adam's production design team had done all of their research legally, fearing a possible investigation by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]].<ref name=Inside/>

In several shots of the B-52 flying over the polar ice en route to Russia, the shadow of the actual camera plane, a [[Boeing]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]], is visible on the snow below. The B-52 was a scale model composited into the Arctic footage which was sped up to create a sense of jet speed.<ref>The camera ship, a former USAAF B-17G-100-VE, serial 44-85643, registered F-BEEA, had been one of four Flying Fortresses purchased from salvage at [[Altus, Oklahoma]] in December 1947 by the French [[Institut géographique national (France)|Institut géographique national]] and converted for survey and photo-mapping duty. It was the last active B-17 of a total of fourteen once operated by the IGN, but it was destroyed in a take-off accident at [[RAF Binbrook]] in 1989 during filming of the film ''[[Memphis Belle (film)|Memphis Belle]]''. {{Cite web|url=http://home.att.net/~jbaugher/1944_6.html|title=1944 USAAF Serial Numbers (44-83886 to 44-92098)|work=USAAS-USAAC-USAAF-USAF Aircraft Serial Numbers—1908 to Present|accessdate=2007-05-04|publisher=Joseph F.

===''Fail Safe''===
''Red Alert'' author [[Peter George (author)|Peter George]] collaborated on the screenplay with Kubrick and [[Satire|satirist]] [[Terry Southern]]. ''Red Alert'' was more solemn than its film version and it did not include the character Dr. Strangelove, though the main plot and technical elements were quite similar. A [[novelization]] of the actual film, rather than a re-print of the original novel, was published by George, based on an early draft in which the narrative is bookended by the account of aliens who, having arrived at a desolated Earth, try to piece together what has happened. This novelisation is to be reissued in December 2014 by [[Candy Jar Ltd|Candy Jar Books]], featuring never-before-published material on Strangelove's early career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://candyjarlimited.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/v-behaviorurldefaultvmlo.html |title=Candy Jar Publishes Classic |accessdate=14 October 2014}}</ref>

During the filming of ''Dr. Strangelove'', Stanley Kubrick learned that ''[[Fail Safe (1964 film)|Fail Safe]]'', a film with a similar theme, was being produced. Although ''Fail Safe'' was to be an ultra-realistic thriller, Kubrick feared that its plot resemblance would damage his film's box office potential, especially if it were released first. Indeed, the novel ''[[Fail-Safe (novel)|Fail-Safe]]'' (on which the film of the same name is based) is so similar to ''Red Alert'' that Peter George sued on charges of plagiarism and settled out of court.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ebookmall.com/ebook/72987-ebook.htm|title=Red Alert—Peter Bryant—Microsoft Reader eBook|accessdate=2006-11-27|publisher=eBookMall, Inc.}}</ref> What worried Kubrick most was that ''Fail Safe'' boasted acclaimed director [[Sidney Lumet]] and first-rate dramatic actors [[Henry Fonda]] as the American President and [[Walter Matthau]] as the advisor to the Pentagon, Professor Groeteschele. Kubrick decided to throw a legal wrench into ''Fail Safe'''s production gears. Lumet recalled in the documentary, ''Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove'': "We started casting. Fonda was already set&nbsp;... which of course meant a big commitment in terms of money. I was set, Walter [Bernstein, the screenwriter] was set&nbsp;... And suddenly, this lawsuit arrived, filed by Stanley Kubrick and Columbia Pictures."

Kubrick argued that ''Fail Safe'''s own 1960 source novel ''Fail-Safe'' had been plagiarized from Peter George's ''Red Alert'', to which Kubrick owned creative rights, and pointed out unmistakable similarities in intentions between the characters Groeteschele and Strangelove. The plan worked, and ''Fail Safe'' opened eight months behind ''Dr. Strangelove'', to critical acclaim but mediocre ticket sales.

===Ending===
The end of the film shows Dr. Strangelove exclaiming "''Mein Führer,'' I can walk!" before cutting to footage of nuclear explosions, with [[Vera Lynn]] singing "[[We'll Meet Again]]." This footage comes from nuclear tests such as shot BAKER of [[Operation Crossroads]] at [[Bikini Atoll]], the [[Trinity test]], a test from [[Operation Sandstone]] and the hydrogen bomb tests from [[Operation Redwing]] and [[Operation Ivy]]. In some shots, old warships (such as the German heavy cruiser ''[[German cruiser Prinz Eugen|Prinz Eugen]]''), which were used as targets, are plainly visible. In others the smoke trails of rockets used to create a calibration backdrop can be seen.

Former ''[[The Goon Show|Goon Show]]'' writer, and friend of Sellers, [[Spike Milligan]], was credited with suggesting the Vera Lynn music for the ending. (Additionally, Sellers' ad-libbed dialogue as the President on the phone with the Russian Premier is drawn from a skit between him and Milligan in the ''Goon Show'' episode "The Lost Emperor".)

===Original ending: the pie fight===
[[File:Pie Fight.jpg|thumb|The cream pie fight was removed from the final cut]]
It was originally planned for the film to end with a scene that was filmed, with everyone in the war room involved in a [[pie fight]].

Accounts vary as to why the pie fight was cut. In a 1969 interview, Kubrick said: "I decided it was [[farce]] and not consistent with the satiric tone of the rest of the film."<ref name=interview69>[http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0069.html "An Interview with Stanley Kubrick (1969)"], published in Joseph Gelmis, ''The Film Director as Superstar'', 1970, Doubleday and Company: Garden City, New York.</ref> Critic [[Alexander Walker (critic)|Alexander Walker]] observed that "the cream pies were flying around so thickly that people lost definition, and you couldn't really say whom you were looking at."<ref name=Inside/><!-- 36m 09s --> Nile Southern, son of screenwriter Terry Southern, suggested the fight was intended to be less jovial. "Since they were laughing, it was unusable, because instead of having that totally black, which would have been amazing, like, this blizzard, which in a sense is metaphorical for all of the missiles that are coming, as well, you just have these guys having a good old time. So, as Kubrick later said, 'it was a disaster of [[Homer]]ic proportions.'"<ref name=Inside/><!-- 35m 45s -->

===Effects of the Kennedy assassination on the film===
A first test screening of the film was scheduled for November 22, 1963, the day of the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]]. The film was just weeks from its scheduled premiere, but because of the assassination the release was delayed until late January 1964, as it was felt that the public was in no mood for such a film any sooner.<ref name="George C. Scott bio">{{cite book|last1=Sheward|first1=David|title=Rage and Glory: The Volatile Life and Career of George C. Scott|date=2008|publisher=[[Hal Leonard Publishing]]|isbn=9781557836700|pages=105–06|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VIwi8nGRuhIC&pg=PA105&lpg=PA105|accessdate=October 19, 2015}}</ref>

One line by Slim Pickens—"a fella could have a pretty good weekend in Dallas with all that stuff"—was dubbed to change "Dallas" to "[[Las Vegas Valley|Vegas]]", since Dallas was the city where Kennedy was killed.<ref name=Snider>Eric D. Snider, "[http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/movies/article/What-s-the-big-deal-Dr-Strangelove-1964-734814.php#page-2 What's the big deal?: Dr. Strangelove (1964)]"; ''Seattle Pi'', 25 October 2010.</ref>  The original reference to Dallas survives in the French-subtitled version of the film.

The assassination also serves as another possible reason why the pie-fight scene was cut. In the scene, after Muffley takes a pie in the face, General Turgidson exclaims: "Gentlemen! Our gallant young president has been struck down in his prime!" Editor Anthony Harvey stated that "[the scene] would have stayed, except that Columbia Pictures were horrified, and thought it would offend the president's family."<ref name=NoFighting>"No Fighting in the War Room Or: Dr. Strangelove and the Nuclear Threat", a documentary included with the 40th Anniversary Special Edition DVD of the film</ref> Kubrick and others have said that the scene had been cut earlier because it was not consistent with the rest of the film.<ref name=Snider />

===1994 re-release===
In 1994 the film was re-released. While the 1964 release used the 1.85:1 aspect ratio, the new print was in the slightly squarer 1.66:1 (5:3) ratio that Kubrick had originally intended.<ref>LoBrutto, Vincent. "Stanley Kubrick: A Biography".  Da Capo Press, 1995, p. 250</ref>

==Themes==

===Satirizing the Cold War===
''Dr. Strangelove'' takes passing shots at numerous [[Cold War]] attitudes, such as the "[[missile gap]]", but it primarily focuses its satire on the theory of [[mutual assured destruction]] (MAD),<ref>{{cite book |title=The American cinema of excess: extremes of the national mind on film |last=King |first=Mike |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2009|publisher=McFarland |location= |isbn=978-0-7864-3988-1 |page=46 |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> in which each side is supposed to be deterred from a nuclear war by the prospect of a universal cataclysmic disaster regardless of who "won". Military strategist and former physicist [[Herman Kahn]], in his 1960 ''[[On Thermonuclear War]],'' used the theoretical example of a [[doomsday device|doomsday machine]] to illustrate the limitations of MAD, which was developed by [[John von Neumann]]; He merely meant that the MAD doctrine shouldn't be pushed to extremes. It worried him that the military might like the idea of a doomsday machine and build one.<ref>See ''On Thermonuclear War'' pp. 144–155</ref> Kahn, a leading critic of MAD, urged America to plan for a limited nuclear war, and later became one of the architects of a doctrine that superficially resembled MAD, but allowed for limited nuclear warfare. He actually consulted with Kubrick on the doomsday machine concept for the film.  Kahn came over as cold and calculating, for example in his willingness to estimate how many human lives the United States could lose and still rebuild economically, but this was unfair, as he was not really advocating nuclear warfare. (He simply meant that if it came to nuclear war, there might in fact be a limited one, and we should keep our options open.)<ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy, Volume 1 |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2001|publisher=Simon and Schuster |location= |isbn=978-0-684-80657-0 |page=471 |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> Kahn's cold analytical attitude towards millions of deaths is reflected in Turgidson's remark to the president about the outcome of a preemptive nuclear war: "Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed. But I do say no more than ten to twenty million killed, tops, uh, depending on the breaks." Turgidson has a binder that is labelled "World Targets in [[Megadeaths]]", a term coined in 1953 by Kahn and popularized in his 1960 book ''On Thermonuclear War''.

The plan to regenerate the human race from the people sheltered in mineshafts is a parody of [[Nelson Rockefeller]]'s, [[Edward Teller]]'s, Herman Kahn's, and [[Chet Holifield]]'s 1961 plan to spend billions of dollars on a nationwide network of concrete-lined underground fallout shelters capable of holding millions of people.<ref>''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine November 1961 pages 112–115 et al.</ref>
This proposed fallout shelter network has similarities and contrasts to that of the very real and robust [[Military of Switzerland#Military and civil defence|Swiss civil defense]] network. Switzerland has an overcapacity of nuclear fallout shelters for the country's population size, and by law, new homes must still be built with a fallout shelter.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304231204576405700994655570.html?mod=WSJEUROPE_hpp_sections_world | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Deborah | last=Ball | title=Swiss Renew Push for Bomb Shelters | date=2011-06-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6347519.stm | work=BBC News | first=Imogen | last=Foulkes | title=Swiss still braced for nuclear war | date=2007-02-10}}</ref> If the US did this it would violate the spirit of MAD and destabilize the situation, because the US could launch a first strike and be safe against a retaliatory second strike. See [[Mutual assured destruction#Theory|Mad--Theory section]].

To refute early 1960s novels and Hollywood films like ''Fail-Safe'' and ''Dr. Strangelove'' which raised questions about U.S. control over nuclear weapons, the Air Force produced a documentary film—''[[SAC Command Post]]''—to demonstrate its responsiveness to presidential command and its tight control over nuclear weapons.<ref>''[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nukevault/ebb304/film03.htm SAC Command Post]''</ref>

===Sexual themes===
In the months following the film's release director Stanley Kubrick received a fan letter from Legrace G. Benson of the Dept. of History of Art at [[Cornell University]] interpreting the film as being sexually-layered. The director wrote back to Benson and confirmed the interpretation, "Seriously, you are the first one who seems to have noticed the sexual framework from intromission (the planes going in) to the last spasm (Kong's ride down and detonation at target)."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Castle |first1=Alison |title=The Stanley Kubrick Archives |year=2008 |publisher=Taschen |isbn=3836508885 |page=359}}</ref>

Sexual metaphors often popped up when the nuclear analysts that Kubrick consulted were discussing strategy, for example [[Bernard Brodie (military strategist)|Bernard Brodie]] compared his not attacking cities/withhold plan following belligerent escalation to [[coitus interruptus]] in an internally circulated [[memorandum]] at the RAND Corporation, while he described the [[Strategic Air Command|SAC]] plan of [[massive retaliation]] as "going all the way". This led RAND scholar Herman Kahn, whom Kubrick consulted, to [[quip]] to an assembled group of "massive retaliation" SAC officers - "Gentlemen, you do not have a [[war plan]]. You have a [[Schlesinger Doctrine|Wargasm!]]".<ref>Kaplan, Fred ''The Wizards of Armageddon''. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 1991, 222-223</ref>

==Reception==
The film was a popular success, earning [[US$]]4,420,000 in rentals in North America during its initial theatrical release.<ref>"Big Rental Pictures of 1964", ''Variety'', 6 January 1965 p 39. Please note this figure is rentals accruing to distributors not total gross.</ref>

It was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]]. In 2000 readers of ''[[Total Film]]'' magazine voted it the 24th greatest comedic film of all time. It holds a 99% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 68 reviews.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dr_strangelove/ |title = Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964) |accessdate = August 22, 2010 |publisher = Flixster | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}</ref> It is ranked number 7 in the All-Time High Scores chart of [[Metacritic]]'s Video/DVD section with an average score of 96.<ref name=metacritic>{{Cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/highscores.shtml |title=DVD/Video: All-Time High Scores |publisher= | work = Metacritic |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref> It is also listed as number 26 on ''[[Empire (magazine)#Current List, The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time|Empire's 500 Greatest Movies of All Time]]''.

==Potential sequel==
In 1995 Kubrick enlisted [[Terry Southern]] to script a sequel titled ''Son of Strangelove''. Kubrick had [[Terry Gilliam]] in mind to direct. The script was never completed, but index cards laying out the story's basic structure were found among Southern's papers after his October 1995 death; it was set largely in underground bunkers, where Dr. Strangelove had taken refuge with a group of women. In 2013 Gilliam commented: "I was told after Kubrick died—by someone who had been dealing with him—that he had been interested in trying to do another ''Strangelove'' with me directing. I never knew about that until after he died but I would have loved to."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twitchfilm.com/2013/10/stanley-kubrick-wanted-terry-gilliam-to-direct-son-of-strangelove.html|title=Stanley Kubrick Wanted Terry Gilliam To Direct SON OF STRANGELOVE|last=Brown|first=Todd|publisher=''[[Twitch Film]]''|date=October 12, 2013|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}</ref>
