Ripper also issues &quot;Wing Attack Plan R&quot; to the patrolling aircraft, one of which is commanded by Major T. J. &quot;King&quot; Kong (<link><target>Slim Pickens</target></link>). All of the aircraft commence an attack flight on Russia and set their radios to allow communications only through the<space/><link><target>CRM 114 (fictional device)</target><part>CRM 114</part></link><space/>discriminator, which is programmed to accept only communications preceded by a secret three-letter code known only to General Ripper.</paragraph><paragraph>Mandrake discovers that no war order has been issued by the Pentagon and tries to stop Ripper, who locks them both in his office. Ripper tells Mandrake that he believes the Soviets have been using<space/><link><target>fluoridation</target></link><space/>of the United States' water supplies to pollute the &quot;precious bodily fluids&quot; of Americans; at this point, Mandrake realizes that Ripper is insane.</paragraph><paragraph>At the Pentagon, General Buck Turgidson (<link><target>George C. Scott</target></link>) briefs President Merkin Muffley (also Peter Sellers) and other officers and aides about the attack in the &quot;<link><target>Joint War Room</target><part>War Room</part></link>&quot;. President Muffley is shocked to learn that such orders could be given without his authorization, but Turgidson reminds him that Plan Renabling a senior officer to launch a strike against the Soviets if all superiors have been killed in a first strike on Washington D.C.allows such an action. Turgidson reports that his men are trying every possible three-letter CRM code to issue the stand-down order, but that this could take over two days and the planes are due to reach their targets in about an hour. Muffley orders the Army chief to storm the base and arrest General Ripper.</paragraph><paragraph>Turgidson attempts to convince Muffley to let the attack continue and use the element of surprise to annihilate the Soviet military altogether before they can strike back; Muffley, however, refuses to be party to a nuclear<space/><link><target>first strike</target></link>. Instead, he brings Soviet ambassador Alexei de Sadeski (<link><target>Peter Bull</target></link>) into the War Room, to telephone<space/><link><target>Premier of the Soviet Union</target><part>Soviet premier</part></link><space/>Dimitri Kissov on the &quot;<link><target>MoscowWashington hotline</target><part>hot line</part></link>&quot;. Muffley warns the Premier of the impending attack and offers to reveal the planes' positions and targets so that the Russians can protect themselves.</paragraph><paragraph>After a heated discussion in Russian with the Premier, the ambassador informs President Muffley that the Soviet Union has created a<space/><link><target>doomsday device</target></link>, which consists of many buried<space/><link><target>cobalt bomb</target><part>bombs jacketed with &quot;Cobalt-Thorium G&quot;</part></link><space/>connected to a computer network set to detonate them automatically should any nuclear attack strike the country. Within two months after detonation, the Cobalt-Thorium G would encircle the earth in a radioactive cloud, wiping out all human and animal life, rendering the surface of the earth uninhabitable for 93 years. The device cannot be dismantled or &quot;un-triggered&quot;, as it is programmed to explode if any such attempt is made. When the President's wheelchair-bound scientific advisor, former<space/><link><target>Nazi</target></link><space/>Dr. Strangelove (again, Peter Sellers), points out that such a doomsday device would only be an effective deterrent if everyone knew about it, de Sadeski replies that the Russian Premier had planned to reveal its existence to the world the following week (on the leader's birthday).</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Dr. Strangelove - Riding the Bomb.png</target><part>thumb</part><part>Aircraft commander Major T.

A bloody battle ensues, and the Army forces eventually take over the base. Ripper kills himself, fearing he will be tortured into revealing the recall code.

Using the recall code, SAC successfully recalls most of the aircraft; however, Muffley learns that a<space/><link><target>surface-to-air missile</target></link><space/>has ruptured the fuel tank of Major Kong's plane and destroyed its communications device, making it impossible to recall this particular plane even with the correct recall code. President Muffley tells the Soviets the plane's target to help them find it, but doesn't realize that because of the shortened range of the crippled aircraft, Major Kong has selected a closer target. As the plane approaches the new target, the crew is unable to open the damaged bomb bay doors. Major Kong crimps broken electric wiring, whereupon the doors open. With Kong straddling it, the nuclear bomb falls and detonates, triggering the doomsday machine.</paragraph><paragraph>Dr. Strangelove recommends that the President gather several hundred thousand people to live in deep mineshafts where the radiation will not penetrate. He suggests a 10:1 female-to-male ratio for a breeding program, to repopulate the Earth when the radiation has subsided. Turgidson, worried that the Soviets will do the same, warns about a &quot;mineshaft gap&quot;, when the wheel chair bound Strangelove suddenly stands and says &quot;Mein Fhrer, I can walk!!&quot;.

He actually consulted with Kubrick on the doomsday machine concept for the film. Kahn came over as cold and calculating, for example in his willingness to estimate how many human lives the United States could lose and still rebuild economically, but this was unfair, as he was not really advocating nuclear warfare.
