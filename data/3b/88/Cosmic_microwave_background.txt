The '''cosmic microwave background''' ('''CMB''') is the [[thermal radiation]] left over from the time of [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] in [[Big Bang|Big Bang cosmology]].  In older literature, the CMB is also variously known as cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) or "relic radiation."  The CMB is a [[cosmic background radiation]] that is fundamental to [[observational cosmology]] because it is the oldest light in the universe, dating to the [[epoch of recombination]].  With a traditional [[optical telescope]], the space between stars and galaxies (the ''background'') is completely dark. However, a sufficiently sensitive [[radio telescope]] shows a faint background glow, almost exactly the same in all directions, that is not associated with any star, galaxy, or other object. This glow is strongest in the [[microwave]] region of the radio spectrum. The accidental discovery of CMB in 1964 by American radio astronomers [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]]<ref name="Penzias&Wilson">{{cite journal |last=Penzias |first=A.

:''The CMB is a snapshot of the oldest light in our Universe, imprinted on the sky when the Universe was just 380,000 years old. It shows tiny temperature fluctuations that correspond to regions of slightly different densities, representing the seeds of all future structure: the stars and galaxies of today.''<ref name=MPG>{{cite web |date=21 March 2013 |title=Planck reveals an almost perfect Universe |url=http://www.mpg.de/7044245/ |publisher=[[Max Planck Gesellschaft]] |accessdate=2013-06-03}}</ref>

The CMB is well explained as radiation left over from an early stage in the development of the universe, and its discovery is considered a landmark test of the [[Big Bang]] model of the universe. When the universe was young, before the formation of stars and planets, it was denser, much hotter, and filled with a uniform glow from a white-hot fog of hydrogen [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. As the universe expanded, both the plasma and the radiation filling it grew cooler. When the universe cooled enough, protons and electrons combined to form neutral atoms. These atoms could no longer absorb the [[thermal radiation]], and so the universe became transparent instead of being an opaque fog.<ref>{{cite serial |last=Kaku |first=M. |author-link=Michio Kaku |date=2014 |episode=First Second of the Big Bang |title=[[How the Universe Works]] |season=3 |number=4 |network=[[Discovery Science (TV channel)|Discovery Science]]}}</ref> Cosmologists refer to the time period when neutral atoms first formed as the ''[[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] epoch'', and the event shortly afterwards when photons started to travel freely through space rather than constantly being scattered by electrons and protons in plasma is referred to as photon [[Decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]]. The photons that existed at the time of photon decoupling have been propagating ever since, though growing fainter and less energetic, since the [[Metric expansion of space|expansion of space]] causes their [[wavelength]] to increase over time (and wavelength is inversely proportional to energy according to [[Planck's relation]]). This is the source of the alternative term ''relic radiation''. The ''surface of last scattering'' refers to the set of points in space at the right distance from us so that we are now receiving photons originally emitted from those points at the time of photon decoupling.

Precise measurements of the CMB are critical to cosmology, since any proposed model of the universe must explain this radiation. The CMB has a thermal [[black body]] spectrum at a temperature of {{val|2.72548|0.00057|u=K}}.<ref name=apj707_2_916>{{Cite journal |last1=Fixsen |first1=D.

(Alternatively if spectral radiance is defined as dE<sub>λ</sub>/dλ then the peak wavelength is 1.871&nbsp;mm.) The glow is very nearly uniform in all directions, but the tiny residual variations show a [[#Primary anisotropy|very specific pattern]], the same as that expected of a fairly uniformly distributed hot gas that has expanded to the current size of the universe. In particular, the spectral radiance at different angles of observation in the sky contains small [[anisotropy|anisotropies]], or irregularities, which vary with the size of the region examined. They have been measured in detail, and match what would be expected if small thermal variations, generated by quantum fluctuations of matter in a very tiny space, had expanded to the size of the observable universe we see today. This is a very active field of study, with scientists seeking both better data (for example, the [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck spacecraft]]) and better interpretations of the initial conditions of expansion.  Although many different processes might produce the general form of a black body spectrum, no model other than the Big Bang has yet explained the fluctuations. As a result, most cosmologists consider the Big Bang model of the universe to be the best explanation for the CMB.

The high degree of uniformity throughout the [[observable universe]] and its faint but measured anisotropy lend strong support for the Big Bang model in general and the [[ΛCDM model|ΛCDM ("Lambda Cold Dark Matter") model]] in particular.  Moreover, the fluctuations are [[coherence (physics)|coherent]] on angular scales that are larger than the apparent [[cosmological horizon]] at recombination.  Either such coherence is acausally [[fine-tuned]], or [[cosmic inflation]] occurred.<ref name="hep-ph/0309057">{{cite journal |last=Dodelson |first=S. |date=2003 |title=Coherent Phase Argument for Inflation |journal=[[AIP Conference Proceedings]] |volume=689 |pages=184–196 |arxiv=hep-ph/0309057 |bibcode=2003AIPC..689..184D |doi=10.1063/1.1627736}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Baumann |first=D. |date=2011 |title=The Physics of Inflation |url=http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/db275/TEACHING/INFLATION/Lectures.pdf |publisher=[[University of Cambridge]] |accessdate=2015-05-09}}</ref>

The cosmic microwave background was first predicted in 1948 by [[Ralph Alpher]], and [[Robert Herman]].<ref>

This high estimate was due to a mis-estimate of the [[Hubble constant]] by Alfred Behr, which could not be replicated and was later abandoned for the earlier estimate. Although there were several previous estimates of the temperature of space, these suffered from two flaws. First, they were measurements of the [[effective temperature|''effective'' temperature]] of space and did not suggest that space was filled with a thermal [[Planck spectrum]]. Next, they depend on our being at a special spot at the edge of the [[Milky Way galaxy]] and they did not suggest the radiation is isotropic. The estimates would yield very different predictions if Earth happened to be located elsewhere in the universe.<ref>

The 1948 results of Alpher and Herman were discussed in many physics settings through about 1955, when both left the Applied Physics Laboratory at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. The mainstream astronomical community, however, was not intrigued at the time by cosmology. Alpher and Herman's prediction was rediscovered by [[Yakov Zel'dovich]] in the early 1960s, and independently predicted by [[Robert Dicke]] at the same time. The first published recognition of the CMB radiation as a detectable phenomenon appeared in a brief paper by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] astrophysicists [[A. G. Doroshkevich]] and [[Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov|Igor Novikov]], in the spring of 1964.<ref>{{cite web|last=Penzias|first=A.

The interpretation of the cosmic microwave background was a controversial issue in the 1960s with some proponents of the [[steady state theory]] arguing that the microwave background was the result of [[integrated starlight|scattered starlight]] from distant galaxies.<ref>

This was largely because new measurements at a range of frequencies showed that the spectrum was a thermal, [[black body]] spectrum, a result that the steady state model was unable to reproduce.<ref>

==Relationship to the Big Bang==
{{Technical|section|date=September 2011}}
The cosmic microwave background radiation and the [[Hubble's law|cosmological redshift]]-distance relation are together regarded as the best available evidence for the [[Big Bang]] theory. Measurements of the CMB have made the inflationary Big Bang theory the Standard Model of Cosmology.<ref>{{cite arXiv|last=Scott|first=D.|date=2005|title=The Standard Cosmological Model|eprint=astro-ph/0510731|class=astro-ph}}</ref> The discovery of the CMB in the mid-1960s curtailed interest in [[non-standard cosmology|alternatives]] such as the [[steady state theory]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Durham, Frank|author2=Purrington, Robert D.|title=Frame of the universe: a history of physical cosmology|publisher=Columbia University Press|date=1983|isbn=0-231-05393-2|pages=193–209}}</ref>

The CMB essentially confirms the Big Bang theory. In the late 1940s Alpher and Herman reasoned that if there was a big bang, the expansion of the universe would have stretched and cooled the high-energy radiation of the very early universe into the microwave region and down to a temperature of about 5&nbsp;K.  They were slightly off with their estimate, but they had exactly the right idea.  They predicted the CMB.  It took another 15 years for Penzias and Wilson to stumble into discovering that the microwave background was actually there.<ref name="Apeiron2_3_79"/>

The CMB gives a snapshot of the [[universe]] when, according to standard cosmology, the temperature dropped enough to allow [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s to form [[hydrogen]] atoms, thus making the universe transparent to radiation. When it originated some 380,000 years after the Big Bang—this time is generally known as the "time of last scattering" or the period of [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] or [[Decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]]—the temperature of the universe was about 3000&nbsp;K. This corresponds to an energy of about 0.25&nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]], which is much less than the 13.6 eV ionization energy of hydrogen.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brandenberger|first=Robert H.|date=1995|title=Formation of Structure in the Universe|bibcode=1995astro.ph..8159B|pages=8159|arxiv=astro-ph/9508159}}</ref>

Since decoupling, the temperature of the background radiation has dropped by a factor of roughly 1,100<ref name="FirstWMAP"/> due to the expansion of the universe. As the universe expands, the CMB photons are [[redshift]]ed, making the radiation's temperature [[inversely proportional]] to a parameter called the universe's [[scale factor (universe)|scale length]]. The temperature ''T''<sub>r</sub> of the CMB as a function of redshift, z, can be shown to be proportional to the temperature of the CMB as observed in the present day (2.725&nbsp;K or 0.235 meV):<ref>{{cite journal | author=Noterdaeme, P. | author2=Petitjean, P. | author3=Srianand, R. | author4=Ledoux, C. | author5=López, S. | title=The evolution of the cosmic microwave background temperature.

:''T''<sub>r</sub> = 2.725(1 + ''z'')

===Primary anisotropy===
[[File:PowerSpectrumExt.svg|thumb|right|300px|The power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation temperature anisotropy in terms of the angular scale (or [[multipole moment]]). The data shown comes from the [[WMAP]] (2006), [[Arcminute Cosmology Bolometer Array Receiver|Acbar]] (2004) [[BOOMERanG experiment|Boomerang]] (2005), [[Cosmic Background Imager|CBI]] (2004), and [[Very Small Array|VSA]] (2004) instruments. Also shown is a theoretical model (solid line).]]

The [[anisotropy]] of the cosmic microwave background is divided into two types: primary anisotropy, due to effects which occur at the last scattering surface and before; and secondary anisotropy, due to effects such as interactions of the background radiation with hot gas or gravitational potentials, which occur between the last scattering surface and the observer.

The structure of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies is principally determined by two effects: acoustic oscillations and [[diffusion damping]] (also called collisionless damping or [[Joseph Silk|Silk]] damping). The acoustic oscillations arise because of a conflict in the [[photon]]–[[baryon]] plasma in the early universe. The pressure of the photons tends to erase anisotropies, whereas the gravitational attraction of the baryons—moving at speeds much slower than light—makes them tend to collapse to form dense haloes. These two effects compete to create acoustic oscillations which give the microwave background its characteristic peak structure. The peaks correspond, roughly, to resonances in which the photons decouple when a particular mode is at its peak amplitude.

The peaks contain interesting physical signatures. The angular scale of the first peak determines the [[shape of the universe|curvature of the universe]] (but not the [[topology]] of the universe). The next peak—ratio of the odd peaks to the even peaks—determines the reduced baryon density.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://background.uchicago.edu/~whu/intermediate/baryons.html |title=Baryons and Inertia |author=Wayne Hu}}</ref> The third peak can be used to get information about the dark matter density.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://background.uchicago.edu/~whu/intermediate/driving.html |title=Radiation Driving Force |author=Wayne Hu}}</ref>

The locations of the peaks also give important information about the nature of the primordial density perturbations. There are two fundamental types of density perturbations—called ''adiabatic'' and ''isocurvature''. A general density perturbation is a mixture of both, and different theories that purport to explain the primordial density perturbation spectrum predict different mixtures.
* Adiabatic density perturbations
:the fractional additional density of each type of particle ([[baryon]]s, [[photon]]s ...) is the same. That is, if at one place there is 1% more energy in baryons than average, then at that place there is also 1% more energy in photons (and 1% more energy in neutrinos) than average. [[Cosmic inflation]] predicts that the primordial perturbations are adiabatic.
* Isocurvature density perturbations
:in each place the sum (over different types of particle) of the fractional additional densities is zero. That is, a perturbation where at some spot there is 1% more energy in baryons than average, 1% more energy in photons than average, and 2% ''less'' energy in neutrinos than average, would be a pure isocurvature perturbation. [[Cosmic string]]s would produce mostly isocurvature primordial perturbations.

The CMB spectrum can distinguish between these two because these two types of perturbations produce different peak locations. Isocurvature density perturbations produce a series of peaks whose angular scales (''l''-values of the peaks) are roughly in the ratio 1:3:5:..., while adiabatic density perturbations produce peaks whose locations are in the ratio 1:2:3:...<ref name="hu_white_1996">{{cite journal|last=Hu |first=W.|last2=White|first2=M.|date=1996|title=Acoustic Signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background|journal=[[Astrophysical Journal]]|volume=471|pages=30–51|doi=10.1086/177951|bibcode=1996ApJ...471...30H|arxiv = astro-ph/9602019 }}</ref> Observations are consistent with the primordial density perturbations being entirely adiabatic, providing key support for inflation, and ruling out many models of structure formation involving, for example, cosmic strings.

Collisionless damping is caused by two effects, when the treatment of the primordial plasma as [[fluid]] begins to break down:
* the increasing [[mean free path]] of the photons as the primordial plasma becomes increasingly rarefied in an expanding universe
* the finite depth of the last scattering surface (LSS), which causes the mean free path to increase rapidly during decoupling, even while some Compton scattering is still occurring.
These effects contribute about equally to the suppression of anisotropies at small scales, and give rise to the characteristic exponential damping tail seen in the very small angular scale anisotropies.

The depth of the LSS refers to the fact that the decoupling of the photons and baryons does not happen instantaneously, but instead requires an appreciable fraction of the age of the universe up to that era. One method of quantifying how long this process took uses the ''photon visibility function'' (PVF). This function is defined so that, denoting the PVF by P(t), the probability that a CMB photon last scattered between time t and t+dt is given by P(t)dt.

The maximum of the PVF (the time when it is most likely that a given CMB photon last scattered) is known quite precisely.

However, to figure out how ''long'' it took the photons and baryons to decouple, we need a measure of the width of the PVF. The WMAP team finds that the PVF is greater than half of its maximum value (the "full width at half maximum", or FWHM) over an interval of 115,000 years. By this measure, decoupling took place over roughly 115,000 years, and when it was complete, the universe was roughly 487,000 years old.

===Late time anisotropy===
Since the CMB came into existence, it has apparently been modified by several subsequent physical processes, which are collectively referred to as late-time anisotropy, or secondary anisotropy. When the CMB photons became free to travel unimpeded, ordinary matter in the universe was mostly in the form of neutral hydrogen and helium atoms. However, observations of galaxies today seem to indicate that most of the volume of the [[intergalactic medium]] (IGM) consists of ionized material (since there are few absorption lines due to hydrogen atoms). This implies a period of [[reionization]] during which some of the material of the universe was broken into hydrogen ions.

The CMB photons are scattered by free charges such as electrons that are not bound in atoms. In an ionized universe, such charged particles have been liberated from neutral atoms by ionizing (ultraviolet) radiation. Today these free charges are at sufficiently low density in most of the volume of the universe that they do not measurably affect the CMB. However, if the IGM was ionized at very early times when the universe was still denser, then there are two main effects on the CMB:
# Small scale anisotropies are erased. (Just as when looking at an object through fog, details of the object appear fuzzy.)
# The physics of how photons are scattered by free electrons ([[Thomson scattering]]) induces polarization anisotropies on large angular scales. This broad angle polarization is correlated with the broad angle temperature perturbation.

Both of these effects have been observed by the WMAP spacecraft, providing evidence that the universe was ionized at very early times, at a [[redshift]] more than 17.{{clarify|date=January 2013}} The detailed provenance of this early ionizing radiation is still a matter of scientific debate. It may have included starlight from the very first population of stars ([[population III]] stars), supernovae when these first stars reached the end of their lives, or the ionizing radiation produced by the accretion disks of massive black holes.

The time following the emission of the cosmic microwave background—and before the observation of the first stars—is semi-humorously referred to by cosmologists as the [[Timeline of the Big Bang#Dark Ages|dark age]], and is a period which is under intense study by astronomers (See [[21 centimeter radiation]]).

Two other effects which occurred between reionization and our observations of the cosmic microwave background, and which appear to cause anisotropies, are the [[Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect]], where a cloud of high-energy electrons scatters the radiation, transferring some of its energy to the CMB photons, and the [[Sachs–Wolfe effect]], which causes photons from the Cosmic Microwave Background to be gravitationally redshifted or blueshifted due to changing gravitational fields.

==Polarization==
<!-- This section is linked from [[Cosmic inflation]] -->

The cosmic microwave background is [[polarization (waves)|polarized]] at the level of a few microkelvin. There are two types of polarization, called E-modes and B-modes. This is in analogy to [[electrostatics]], in which the electric field (''E''-field) has a vanishing [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] and the magnetic field (''B''-field) has a vanishing [[divergence]]. The E-modes arise naturally from [[Thomson scattering]] in a heterogeneous plasma. The B-modes are not sourced by standard scalar type perturbations. Instead they can be created by two mechanisms: the first one is by gravitational lensing of E-modes, which has been measured by the [[South Pole Telescope]] in 2013;<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hanson|first=D.|date=2013|title=Detection of B-mode polarization in the Cosmic Microwave Background with data from the South Pole Telescope|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=111|issue=14|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.141301|arxiv=1307.5830|url = http://www.nature.com/news/polarization-detected-in-big-bang-s-echo-1.13441 |bibcode = 2013PhRvL.111n1301H |display-authors=etal}}</ref> the second one is from [[gravitational wave]]s arising from [[cosmic inflation]]. Detecting the B-modes is extremely difficult, particularly as the degree of foreground contamination is unknown, and the [[weak gravitational lensing]] signal mixes the relatively strong E-mode signal with the B-mode signal.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=A.|last2=Challinor|first2=A.|date=2006|title=Weak gravitational lensing of the CMB|journal=[[Physics Reports]]|volume=429|pages=1–65|doi = 10.1016/j.physrep.2006.03.002|arxiv=astro-ph/0601594|bibcode = 2006PhR...429....1L }}</ref>

E-modes were first seen in 2002 by the [[Degree Angular Scale Interferometer]] (DASI).

==== Primordial gravitational waves ====
Primordial gravitational waves are [[gravitational waves]] that could be observed in the polarisation of the cosmic microwave background and having their origin in the [[early universe]]. Models of [[cosmic inflation]] predict that such gravitational waves should appear; thus, their detection supports the theory of inflation, and their strength can confirm and exclude different models of inflation. It is the result of three things: inflationary expansion of space itself, reheating after inflation, and turbulent fluid mixing of matter and radiation.

On 17 March 2014 it was announced that the [[BICEP and Keck Array|BICEP2]] instrument had detected the first type of B-modes, consistent with inflation and [[gravitational waves]] in the [[early universe]] at the level of {{nowrap|1=''r'' = {{val|0.20|+0.07|-0.05}}}}, which is the amount of power present in [[gravitational wave]]s compared to the amount of power present in other scalar density perturbations in the very early universe.

==Microwave background observations==
[[File:Ilc 9yr moll4096.png|thumb|right|300px|All-sky map of the [[CMB]], created from 9 years of [[WMAP]] data.]]
{{main|List of cosmic microwave background experiments}}

Subsequent to the discovery of the CMB, hundreds of cosmic microwave background experiments have been conducted to measure and characterize the signatures of the radiation. The most famous experiment is probably the [[NASA]] Cosmic Background Explorer ([[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]]) satellite that orbited in 1989–1996 and which detected and quantified the large scale anisotropies at the limit of its detection capabilities. Inspired by the initial COBE results of an extremely isotropic and homogeneous background, a series of ground- and balloon-based experiments quantified CMB anisotropies on smaller angular scales over the next decade. The primary goal of these experiments was to measure the angular scale of the first acoustic peak, for which COBE did not have sufficient resolution. These measurements were able to rule out [[cosmic string]]s as the leading theory of cosmic structure formation, and suggested [[cosmic inflation]] was the right theory. During the 1990s, the first peak was measured with increasing sensitivity and by 2000 the [[BOOMERanG experiment]] reported that the highest power fluctuations occur at scales of approximately one degree. Together with other cosmological data, these results implied that the geometry of the universe is [[flat space|flat]]. A number of ground-based [[interferometer]]s provided measurements of the fluctuations with higher accuracy over the next three years, including the [[Very Small Array]], [[Degree Angular Scale Interferometer]] (DASI), and the [[Cosmic Background Imager]] (CBI). DASI made the first detection of the polarization of the CMB and the CBI provided the first E-mode polarization spectrum with compelling evidence that it is out of phase with the T-mode spectrum.

In June 2001, [[NASA]] launched a second CMB space mission, [[WMAP]], to make much more precise measurements of the large scale anisotropies over the full sky. [[WMAP]] used symmetric, rapid-multi-modulated scanning, rapid switching radiometers to minimize non-sky signal noise.<ref name="FirstWMAP"/> The first results from this mission, disclosed in 2003, were detailed measurements of the angular power spectrum at a scale of less than one degree, tightly constraining various cosmological parameters. The results are broadly consistent with those expected from [[cosmic inflation]] as well as various other competing theories, and are available in detail at NASA's data bank for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) (see links below). Although WMAP provided very accurate measurements of the large scale angular fluctuations in the CMB (structures about as broad in the sky as the moon), it did not have the angular resolution to measure the smaller scale fluctuations which had been observed by former ground-based [[interferometer]]s.

A third space mission, the [[European Space Agency|ESA]] (European Space Agency) [[Planck Surveyor]], was launched in May 2009 and is currently performing an even more detailed investigation. Planck employs both [[HEMT]] radiometers and [[bolometer]] technology and will measure the CMB at a smaller scale than WMAP. Its detectors were trialled in the Antarctic [[Viper telescope]] as ACBAR ([[Arcminute Cosmology Bolometer Array Receiver]]) experiment—which has produced the most precise measurements at small angular scales to date—and in the [[Archeops]] balloon telescope.

==Data reduction and analysis==
Raw CMBR data from the space vehicle (i.e. WMAP) contain foreground effects that completely obscure the fine-scale structure of the cosmic microwave background. The fine-scale structure is superimposed on the raw CMBR data but is too small to be seen at the scale of the raw data. The most prominent of the foreground effects is the dipole anisotropy caused by the Sun's motion relative to the CMBR background. The dipole anisotropy and others due to Earth's annual motion relative to the Sun and numerous microwave sources in the galactic plane and elsewhere must be subtracted out to reveal the extremely tiny variations characterizing the fine-scale structure of the CMBR background.

The detailed analysis of CMBR data to produce maps, an angular power spectrum, and ultimately cosmological parameters is a complicated, computationally difficult problem. Although computing a power spectrum from a map is in principle a simple [[Fourier transform]], decomposing the map of the sky into [[spherical harmonics]], in practice it is hard to take the effects of noise and foreground sources into account. In particular, these foregrounds are dominated by galactic emissions such as [[Bremsstrahlung]], [[Synchrotron radiation#Synchrotron radiation in astronomy|synchrotron]], and [[dust#Dust in other contexts|dust]] that emit in the microwave band; in practice, the galaxy has to be removed, resulting in a CMB map that is not a full-sky map. In addition, point sources like galaxies and clusters represent another source of foreground which must be removed so as not to distort the short scale structure of the CMB power spectrum.

Constraints on many cosmological parameters can be obtained from their effects on the power spectrum, and results are often calculated using [[Markov Chain Monte Carlo]] sampling techniques.

===Low multipoles and other anomalies===

Recent observations with the [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck telescope]], which is very much more sensitive than WMAP and has a larger angular resolution, confirm the observation of the axis of evil.  Since two different instruments recorded the same anomaly, instrumental error (but not foreground contamination) appears to be ruled out.<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23301-planck-shows-almost-perfect-cosmos--plus-axis-of-evil.html Planck shows almost perfect cosmos – plus axis of evil]</ref>  Coincidence is a possible explanation, chief scientist from [[WMAP]], [[Charles L.

* In ''[[Wheelers (novel)|Wheelers]]'', a novel by [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] & [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]], CMBR is explained as the encrypted transmissions of an ancient civilization. This allows the Jovian "blimps" to have a society older than the currently-observed age of the universe.
* In ''[[The Three-Body Problem]]'', a novel by [[Liu Cixin]], CMBR becomes observable to the naked eye due to interference from an alien civilization.
