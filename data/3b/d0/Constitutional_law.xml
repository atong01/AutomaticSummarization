Constitutional law deals with the fundamental principles by which the government exercises its authority. In some instances, these principles grant specific powers to the government, such as the power to tax and spend for the welfare of the population. Other times, constitutional principles act to place limits on what the government can do, such as prohibiting the arrest of an individual without sufficient cause. In most nations, including the United States, constitutional law is based on the text of a document ratified at the time the nation came into being.</paragraph><heading level='2'>State and legal structure</heading><paragraph>Constitutional laws may often be considered second order rule making or rules about making rules to exercise power. It governs the relationships between the judiciary, the legislature and the executive with the bodies under its authority. One of the key tasks of constitutions within this context is to indicate hierarchies and relationships of power. For example, in a<space/><link><target>unitary state</target></link>, the constitution will vest ultimate authority in one central administration and<space/><link><target>legislature</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>judiciary</target></link>, though there is often a delegation of power or authority to local or municipal authorities. When a constitution establishes a<space/><link><target>federal state</target></link>, it will identify the several levels of government coexisting with exclusive or shared areas of jurisdiction over lawmaking, application and enforcement.<space/></paragraph><heading level='2'>Human rights</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Human rights</arg><arg>Human rights law</arg></template>Human rights or<space/><link><target>civil liberties</target></link><space/>form a crucial part of a country's constitution and govern the rights of the individual against the state. Most jurisdictions, like the<space/><link><target>United States of America</target><part>United States</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>France</target></link>, have a codified constitution, with a<space/><link><target>bill of rights</target></link>. A recent example is the<space/><link><target>Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union</target></link><space/>which was intended to be included in the<space/><link><target>Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe</target></link>, that failed to be ratified. Perhaps the most important example is the<space/><link><target>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</target></link><space/>under the<space/><link><target>UN Charter</target></link>. These are intended to ensure basic political, social and economic standards that a nation state, or intergovernmental body is obliged to provide to its citizens but many do include its governments.</paragraph><paragraph>Some countries like the<space/><link><target>United Kingdom</target></link><space/>have no entrenched document setting out fundamental rights; in those jurisdictions the constitution is composed of<space/><link><target>statute</target></link>,<space/><link><target>case law</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Constitutional convention (political custom)</target><part>convention</part></link>.
