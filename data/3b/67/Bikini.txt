A '''bikini''' is usually<!-- NOTE: The term "usually" is used because "bikini" can also refer to a man's swimsuit.--> a women's abbreviated two-piece [[swimsuit]] with a [[brassiere|bra top]] for the chest and [[panties]] cut below the navel.<ref name=MMOA /><ref name="Bikini">{{cite web|title=Bikini|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|date=February 13, 2014|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bikini}}</ref> The basic design is simple: two triangles of fabric on top cover the woman's [[breast]]s and two triangles of fabric on the bottom cover the [[groin]] in front and the [[buttocks]] in back.<ref name=MMOA /> The size of a bikini bottom can range from full pelvic coverage to a revealing [[thong (clothing)|thong]] or [[G-string]] design.

The name for the ''bikini'' design was coined in 1946 by [[Paris]]ian engineer [[Louis Réard]], the inventor of the bikini. He named the swimsuit after [[Bikini Atoll]], where testing on the [[atomic bomb]] was taking place. Fashion designer [[Jacques Heim]], also from Paris, invented a similar design in the same year. Due to its controversial and revealing design, the bikini was slow to be adopted. In many countries it was banned from beaches and public places. The [[Holy See]] declared the design sinful.<ref name=Alac>{{cite book |last=Alac |first=Patrik |title=Bikini Story |year=2012|publisher=Parkstone International |isbn=978-1-78042-951-9|edition=first |page=52 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=SIj_GBl5sAoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9zXxU5P2GMaC8gXWl4GQDA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> While still considered risqué the bikini gradually became a part of popular culture when [[filmstar]]s like [[Brigitte Bardot]], [[Raquel Welch]], [[Ursula Andress]] and others began wearing them on public beaches and in film.

The bikini design became common in most western countries by the mid-1960s as [[beachwear]], [[swimwear]] and [[underwear]]. By the late 20th century it had become common as [[Sportswear (activewear)|sportswear]] in sports such as [[beach volleyball]] and [[bodybuilding]]. Variations of the term are used to describe [[Bikini variant|stylistic variations]] for promotional purposes and industry classifications, like  [[monokini]], [[microkini]], [[tankini]], [[trikini]], pubikini, bandeaukini and skirtini. A man's [[Swim briefs|brief swimsuit]] may also be referred to as a bikini.<ref name="Bikini" /> A variety of men's and women's underwear are described as bikini underwear. The bikini has fueled spin-off industries, like [[bikini wax]]ing and [[sun tanning]].<ref name=AgeL>Lorna Edwards, "[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/06/02/1148956539436.html?page=fullpage You've still got it, babe], ''[[The Age]]'', June 3, 2006</ref>

The bikini has gradually grown to gain wide acceptance in [[Western world|Western society]]. According to French fashion historian [[Olivier Saillard]], the bikini is perhaps the most popular type of female beachwear around the globe because of "the power of women, and not the power of fashion". As he explains, "The emancipation of swimwear has always been linked to the emancipation of women."<ref name=BBCW>Kathryn Westcott, "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/5130460.stm The Bikini: Not a brief affair]", BBC News, June 5, 2006</ref> By the early 2000s, bikinis had become a US$811 million business annually, and boosted spin-off services like [[bikini waxing]] and [[sun tanning]].<ref name=AgeL>Lorna Edwards, "[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/06/02/1148956539436.html?page=fullpage You've still got it, babe], ''[[The Age]]'', June 3, 2006</ref>

==Construction==
A bikini top is very similar to a [[bra]], though its construction may be simpler. The bikini top is supported by a band around the woman's torso under her bust.  The chest band is held in place by ties at the back using a string or hook and eye fastener, or by the elasticity of the material, or it may be fastened at the front. Some bikini tops do not have fasteners and are pulled on over the head and breasts. Two fabric triangles attached to the chest band cover the breasts. The fabric triangles may be supported by [[shoulder strap]]s.  A bikini top may or may not provide full support for breasts like a [[bra]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The bikini bottoms are [[panties]] which are held in place by the tension of the fabric or by ties at the hips. The bottom consists of two triangles of fabric that cover the [[groin]] in front and the [[buttocks]] in the back.<ref name=MMOA /> The size of a bikini bottom can range from full pelvic coverage to a revealing [[thong (clothing)|thong]] or [[g-string]] design that only cover the [[mons pubis]].

Swimming or bathing outdoors was discouraged in the [[Christian West]], so there was little demand or need for swimming or bathing costumes until the 18th century. The bathing gown of the 18th century was a loose ankle-length full-sleeve [[chemise]]-type gown made of wool or flannel that retained coverage and modesty.<ref name=claud>Claudia B. Kidwell, ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/37586/37586-h/37586-h.htm Women's Bathing and Swimming Costume in the United States]'', Smithsonian Institution Press, City of Washington, 1968</ref>

In 1907, Australian swimmer and performer [[Annette Kellerman]] was arrested on a [[Boston]] beach for wearing form-fitting sleeveless one-piece knitted swimming tights that covered her from neck to toe, a costume she adopted from England,<ref name=claud /> although it became accepted swimsuit attire for women in parts of Europe by 1910.<ref>Liz Conor, ''The spectacular modern woman: feminine visibility in the 1920s'', page 152, Indiana University Press, 2004, ISBN 0-253-34391-7</ref> In 1913, designer [[Carl Jantzen]] made the first functional two-piece swimwear. Inspired by the introduction of females into Olympic swimming he designed a close-fitting costume with shorts for the bottom and short sleeves for the top.<ref name=heritage>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/web/20060705-bikini-swimming-suit-louis-reard-micheline-bernardini-paris-brigitte-bardot.shtml|accessdate=November 13, 2007|publisher=American Heritage Inc.|title=60 Years of Bikinis|author=Hoover, Elizabeth D.|date=July 5, 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070909195749/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/web/20060705-bikini-swimming-suit-louis-reard-micheline-bernardini-paris-brigitte-bardot.shtml |archivedate=September 9, 2007}}</ref>

During the 1920s and 1930s, people began to shift from "taking in the water" to "taking in the sun", at bathhouses and spas, and swimsuit designs shifted from functional considerations to incorporate more decorative features. [[Rayon]] was used in the 1920s in the manufacture of tight-fitting swimsuits,<ref name=sydelle>{{cite web|last=Sydelle|first=John|title=The Swimsuit Industry|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/swimsuit-industry-18779.html |work=The Houston Chronicle |accessdate=August 29, 2013}}</ref> but its durability, especially when wet, proved problematic.<ref name="Kadolph">{{cite book|title=Textiles|edition=9|author=Kadolph, Sara J. and Langford, Anna L.|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-025443-6|year=2001}}</ref> [[Jersey (clothing)|Jersey]] and [[silk]] were also sometimes used.<ref>R. Turner Wilcox, ''The Mode in Costume'', page 424, Courier Corporation, 2008, ISBN 978-0-486-46820-4</ref> By the 1930s, manufacturers had lowered necklines in the back, removed sleeves, and tightened the sides. With the development of new clothing materials, particularly [[latex]] and [[nylon]], swimsuits gradually began hugging the body through the 1930s, with shoulder straps that could be lowered for tanning.<ref>Bronwyn Labrum, Fiona McKergow and Stephanie Gibson, ''Looking Flash'', page 166, Auckland University Press, 2007, ISBN 978-1-86940-397-3</ref>

Women's swimwear of the 1930s and 1940s incorporated increasing degrees of [[midriff exposure]]. Teen magazines of late 1940s and 1950s featured similar designs of midriff-baring suits and tops. However, midriff fashion was stated as only for beaches and informal events and considered indecent to be worn in public.<ref name="girl">{{cite book|last=Claudia Mitchell, Jacqueline Reid-Walsh|title=Girl Culture: Studying girl culture : a readers' guide Volume 1 of Girl Culture: An Encyclopedia|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-33909-7|pages=434–435|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=arQy0v_PBx4C&pg=PA225}}</ref> Hollywood endorsed the new glamor in films like ''[[Neptune's Daughter (1949 film)|Neptune's Daughter]]'' in which [[Esther Williams]] wore provocatively named costumes such as "Double Entendre" and "Honey Child".<ref name=notting>{{cite news |first=David |last=Sandhu |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/sunandsea/728059/Nottingham-Bathed-in-nostalgia.html |title=Nottingham: Bathed in nostalgia |work=The Telegraph |date=August 4, 2003 |location=London}}</ref>

In Europe, 17-year-old [[Brigitte Bardot]] wore scanty bikinis (by contemporary standards) in the French film ''Manina, la fille sans voiles'' ("Manina, the girl unveiled"). The promotion for the film, released in France in March 1953, drew more attention to Bardot's bikinis than to the film itself. By the time the film was released in the United States in 1958 it was re-titled ''[[Manina, the Girl in the Bikini]]''. Bardot was also photographed wearing a bikini on the beach during the 1953 [[Cannes Film Festival]]. Working with her husband and agent [[Roger Vadim]] she garnered significant attention with photographs of her wearing a bikini on every beach in the south of France.<ref>{{cite web|title=The History of the Bikini|url=http://www.elle.com/fashion/g2906/the-history-of-the-bikini-654900/#slide-6|publisher=ELLE|date=April 23, 2012 | accessdate=August 21, 2013}}</ref>

Similar photographs were taken of [[Anita Ekberg]] and [[Sophia Loren]], among others.

The bikini finally caught on, and by 1963, the movie ''[[Beach Party]]'', starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon, led a wave of films that made the bikini a pop-culture symbol, though Funicello was barred from wearing Réard's bikini unlike the other young females in the films.

From the 1950s to mid-1970s, men's contest formats were often supplemented with women's beauty contests or bikini shows.

== Bikini underwear ==
[[File:Male model B and Female model A 01.JPG|thumb|Bikini underwear]]

Certain types of underwear are described as bikini underwear and designed for men and women. For women, bikini or bikini-style underwear is underwear that is similar in size and form to a regular bikini. It can refer to virtually any undergarment that provides less coverage to the [[midriff]] than [[Lingerie|traditional underwear]], [[panties]] or knickers,<ref>Alison J. Carter, ''Underwear: The Fashion History'', page 111, Batsford, 1992, ISBN 978-0-7134-6222-7</ref> especially suited to clothing such as [[crop top]]s. For men, bikini briefs are undergarments that are smaller and more revealing than men's regular [[briefs]]. Men's bikini briefs can be low- or high-side that are usually lower than true waist, often at hips, and usually have no access pouch or flap, legs bands at tops of thighs.<ref>Shaun Cole, ''[https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=EEEmuePeDX4C&pg=PA90&dq=bikini+underwear&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Ps8gVdOVGZGTuASoo4GYAw&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=bikini%20underwear&f=false The Story of Men's Underwear]'', pages 90-93, Parkstone International, 2012, ISBN 978-1-78042-882-6</ref> String bikini briefs have front and rear sections that meet in the crotch but not at the waistband, with no fabric on the side of the legs.<ref>{{cite web |title=The History of Underwear |url=http://www.boxerbriefs.com/history_of_underwear.htm |publisher=Boxerbriefs.com |accessdate=August 15, 2013}}</ref>

Swimwear and underwear have similar design considerations, both being [[form-fitting garment]]s. The main difference is that, unlike underwear, swimwear is open to public view.<ref>Jennifer Craik, ''The Face of Fashion: Cultural Studies in Fashion'', page 133, Routledge, 1993, ISBN 978-1-134-94056-1</ref> The swimsuit was and is follows underwear styles,<ref>Christine Schmid, ''The Swimsuit: Fashion from Poolside to Catwalk'', page 6, A&C Black, 2013, ISBN 978-0-85785-124-6</ref> and at about the same time that attitudes towards the bikini began to change, underwear underwent a redesign towards a minimal, unboned design that emphasized comfort first.<ref>Dan Parker, ''The Bathing Suit: Christian Liberty Or Secular Idolatry'', page 170, Xulon Press, 2003, ISBN 978-1-59160-753-3</ref>

As the swimsuit was evolving, the underwear started to change. Between 1900 to 1940, swimsuit lengths followed the changes in underwear designs.<ref>Muriel Barbier, Shazia Boucher, ''The Story of Lingerie'', page 139, Parkstone International, 2012, ISBN 978-1-78042-970-0</ref> In the 1920s women started discarding the corset, while the Cadole company of Paris started developing something they called the "breast girdle".<ref name=napol>Anthony Napoleon, ''Awakening Beauty", page 130, Virtualbookworm Publishing, 2003, ISBN 978-1-58939-378-3</ref> During the Great Depression, panties and bras became softly constructed and were made of various elasticized yarns making underwear fit like a second skin. By 1930s underwear styles for both women and men were influenced by the new brief models of swimwear from Europe. Although the waistband was still above the navel, the leg openings of the panty brief were cut in an arc to rise from the crotch to the hip joint. The brief served as a template for most all variations of panties for the rest of the century.<ref name=ddhills>Daniel Delis Hill, '' As Seen in Vogue: A Century of American Fashion in Advertising'', page 158, Texas Tech University Press, 2007, ISBN 978-0-89672-616-1</ref> Warner standardized the concept of [[Cup size]] in 1935. The first underwire bra was developed in 1938.<ref name=napol /> Beginning in the late thirties skants, a type of skanty men's briefs, were introduced, featuring very high-cut leg openings and a lower rise to the waistband.<ref name=ddhills /> [[Howard Hughes]] designed the push-up bra worn by [[Jane Russell]] in ''[[The Outlaw]]'' in 1943. In 1950 [[Maidenform]] introduced the first official bust enhancing bra.<ref name=napol />

By the 1960s, the bikini swimsuit influenced panty styles and coincided with the cut of the new lower rise jeans and pants.<ref name=ddhills /> In the seventies, with the emergence of skintight jeans, thong versions of the panty became mainstream, since the open, stringed back eliminated any tell-tale panty lines across the rear and hips.

== Men's bikini ==
[[File:Albert Cordina 1 (cropped).jpg|thumbnail|left|Men's bikini]]

The term ''men's bikini'' is sometimes used to describe [[swim briefs]]. Men's bikinis can have high or low side panels, and string sides or tie sides. Most lack a button or flap front. Unlike swim briefs, bikinis are not designed for drag reduction and generally lack a visible waistband. Suits less than 1.5&nbsp;inches wide at the hips are less common for sporting purposes and are most often worn for recreation, fashion, and [[sun tanning]]. The posing brief standard to [[bodybuilding]] competitions is an example of this style. Male [[punk rock]] musicians have performed on the stage wearing women's bikini briefs.<ref>A. W.

Swimsuits shown in men's wear collections by [[Giorgio Armani]], [[Dolce & Gabbana]] and [[Paul Smith (fashion designer)|Paul Smith]] have tended to be throwbacks to the designs of the 1930s and '40s.

Bikini waxing is the [[hair removal|epilation]] of [[pubic hair]] beyond the bikini line by use of [[waxing]]. The bikini line delineates the part of a woman's pubic area which would normally be covered by the bottom part of a swimsuit. In the context of waxing, it is generally understood to describe any pubic hair visible beyond the boundaries of a swimsuit.<ref name=Embod1 /> With certain styles of women's swimwear, pubic hair may become visible around the [[crotch]] area of a [[swimsuit]].<ref name=Embod1>Heinz Tschachler, Maureen Devine, Michael Draxlbauer; ''The EmBodyment of American Culture''; pp 61–62; LIT Verlag, Berlin-Hamburg-Münster; 2003; ISBN 3-8258-6762-5.</ref> Visible pubic hair is widely culturally disapproved, considered to be [[Embarrassment|embarrassing]], and often removed.<ref name=Embod1 /> With the reduction in the size of swimsuits, especially since the advent of the bikini after 1945, the practice of bikini waxing has also come into vogue.<ref name=Embod1 />

[[File:Tan lines on human female chest.jpg|thumb|left|Tan lines created by a bikini]]

The [[tan line]]s created by the wearing of a bikini while tanning are known as a bikini tan. These tan lines separate paler breasts, crotch, and buttocks from otherwise darker tanned skin. A 1969 innovation of tan-through swimwear uses fabric which is perforated with thousands of micro holes that are nearly invisible to the naked eye, but which let enough sunlight through to produce a line-free tan.<ref name=nyt>{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=Tan-Through Fabric Lets Sun Shine In |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60B12F8385F127A93C5A8178BD95F4D8685F9 |last=Taylor |first=Angela |date=October 17, 1969 |page=55}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1082764/3/ |title=Scorecard: No nudes is good news |magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=September 1, 1969 |accessdate=April 15, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20141016071014/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1082764/3/ |archivedate=October 16, 2014 }}</ref>
