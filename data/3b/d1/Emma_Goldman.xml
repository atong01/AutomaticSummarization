She believed it was necessary for anarchist thinkers to live their beliefs, demonstrating their convictions with every action and word. &quot;I don't care if a man's theory for tomorrow is correct,&quot; she once wrote. &quot;I care if his spirit of today is correct.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="WexInt92">Quoted in Wexler,<space/><italics>Intimate</italics>, p. 92.</extension><space/>Anarchism and free association were to her logical responses to the confines of government control and capitalism. &quot;It seems to me that<space/><italics>these</italics><space/>are the new forms of life,&quot; she wrote, &quot;and that they will take the place of the old, not by preaching or voting, but by living them.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="WexInt92"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>At the same time, she believed that the movement on behalf of human liberty must be staffed by liberated humans. While dancing among fellow anarchists one evening, she was chided by an associate for her carefree demeanor. In her autobiography, Goldman wrote:</paragraph><paragraph><extension extension_name='blockquote'>I told him to mind his own business, I was tired of having the Cause constantly thrown in my face. I did not believe that a Cause which stood for a beautiful ideal, for anarchism, for release and freedom from conventions and prejudice, should demand denial of life and joy. I insisted that our Cause could not expect me to behave as a nun and that the movement should not be turned into a cloister. If it meant that, I did not want it. &quot;I want freedom, the right to self-expression, everybody's right to beautiful, radiant things.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>Goldman,<space/><italics>Living</italics>, p. 56.</extension></extension></paragraph><heading level='4'>Tactical uses of violence</heading><paragraph>Goldman, in her political youth, held targeted violence to be a legitimate means of revolutionary struggle. Goldman at the time believed that the use of violence, while distasteful, could be justified in relation to the social benefits it might accrue. She advocated<space/><link><target>propaganda of the deed</target></link><italics>attentat</italics>, or violence carried out to encourage the masses to revolt. She supported her partner<space/><link><target>Alexander Berkman</target></link>'s attempt to kill industrialist<space/><link><target>Henry Clay Frick</target></link>, and even begged him to allow her to participate.<extension extension_name='ref' name="EGLiv88">Goldman,<space/><italics>Living</italics>, p. 88.</extension><space/>She believed that Frick's actions during the<space/><link><target>Homestead strike</target></link><space/>were reprehensible and that his murder would produce a positive result for working people. &quot;Yes,&quot; she wrote later in her autobiography, &quot;the end in this case justified the means.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="EGLiv88"></extension><space/>While she never gave explicit approval of<space/><link><target>Leon Czolgosz</target></link>'s assassination of US President<space/><link><target>William McKinley</target></link>, she defended his ideals and believed actions like his were a natural consequence of repressive institutions. As she wrote in &quot;The Psychology of Political Violence&quot;: &quot;the accumulated forces in our social and economic life, culminating in an act of violence, are similar to the terrors of the atmosphere, manifested in storm and lightning.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>Goldman,<space/><italics>Anarchism</italics>, p. 79.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Her experiences in Russia led her to qualify her earlier belief that revolutionary ends might justify violent means. In the afterword to<space/><italics><link><target>My Disillusionment in Russia</target></link></italics>, she wrote: &quot;There is no greater fallacy than the belief that aims and purposes are one thing, while methods and tactics are another.... The means employed become, through individual habit and social practice, part and parcel of the final purpose....&quot; In the same chapter, however, Goldman affirmed that &quot;Revolution is indeed a violent process,&quot; and noted that violence was the &quot;tragic inevitability of revolutionary upheavals...&quot;<space/><extension extension_name='ref'>Goldman,<space/><italics>Disillusionment</italics>, pp. 260264.</extension><space/>Some misinterpreted her comments on the Bolshevik terror as a rejection of all militant force, but Goldman corrected this in the preface to the first US edition of<space/><italics>My Disillusionment in Russia</italics>:</paragraph><paragraph><extension extension_name='blockquote'>The argument that destruction and terror are part of revolution I do not dispute. I know that in the past every great political and social change necessitated violence...Black slavery might still be a legalized institution in the United States but for the militant spirit of the John Browns. I have never denied that violence is inevitable, nor do I gainsay it now. Yet it is one thing to employ violence in combat, as a means of defense. It is quite another thing to make a principle of terrorism, to institutionalize it, to assign it the most vital place in the social struggle. Such terrorism begets counter-revolution and in turn itself becomes counter-revolutionary.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Goldman saw the militarization of Soviet society not as a result of armed resistance per se, but of the statist vision of the Bolsheviks, writing that &quot;an insignificant minority bent on creating an absolute State is necessarily driven to oppression and terrorism.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://ucblibrary3.berkeley.edu/Goldman/Writings/Russia/preface1.html'>&quot;Preface to First Volume of American Edition&quot; for ''My Disillusionment in Russia''</link><space/>(Emma Goldman Papers Project, University of California-Berkeley).</extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Capitalism and labor</heading><paragraph>Goldman believed that the economic system of capitalism was incompatible with human liberty. &quot;The only demand that property recognizes,&quot; she wrote in<space/><italics>Anarchism and Other Essays</italics>, &quot;is its own gluttonous appetite for greater wealth, because wealth means power; the power to subdue, to crush, to exploit, the power to enslave, to outrage, to degrade.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="EGAnar54">Goldman,<space/><italics>Anarchism</italics>, p. 54.</extension><space/>She also argued that capitalism dehumanized workers, &quot;turning the producer into a mere particle of a machine, with less will and decision than his master of steel and iron.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="EGAnar54"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Originally opposed to anything less than complete revolution, Goldman was challenged during one talk by an elderly worker in the front row. In her autobiography, she wrote:</paragraph><paragraph><extension extension_name='blockquote'>He said that he understood my impatience with such small demands as a few hours less a day, or a few dollars more a week.... But what were men of his age to do? They were not likely to live to see the ultimate overthrow of the capitalist system.

That was all they could hope to see realized in their lifetime.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Goldman-Living-52"></extension></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Goldman realized that smaller efforts for improvement such as higher wages and shorter hours could be part of a social revolution.</paragraph><heading level='3'>The state militarism, prison, voting, speech</heading><paragraph>Goldman viewed the state as essentially and inevitably a tool of control and domination. As a result, Goldman believed that voting was useless at best and dangerous at worst. Voting, she wrote, provided an illusion of participation while masking the true structures of decision-making. Instead, Goldman advocated targeted resistance in the form of strikes, protests, and &quot;direct action against the invasive, meddlesome authority of our moral code&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref' name="WexInt91">Wexler,<space/><italics>Intimate</italics>, p. 91.</extension><space/>She maintained an anti-voting position even when many anarcho-syndicalists in 1930s Spain voted for the formation of a liberal republic.

Goldman viewed crime as a natural outgrowth of an unjust economic system, and in her essay &quot;Prisons: A Social Crime and Failure&quot;, she quoted liberally from the 19th-century authors<space/><link><target>Fyodor Dostoevsky</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Oscar Wilde</target></link><space/>on prisons, and wrote:<space/><extension extension_name='blockquote'>Year after year the gates of prison hells return to the world an emaciated, deformed, will-less, shipwrecked crew of humanity, with the Cain mark on their foreheads, their hopes crushed, all their natural inclinations thwarted.
