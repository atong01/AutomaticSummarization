It was Doubleday's finest performance during the war, five hours leading 9,500 men against ten Confederate brigades that numbered more than 16,000. Seven of those brigades sustained casualties that ranged from 35 to 50 percent, indicating the ferocity of the Union defense. On Cemetery Hill, however, the I Corps could muster only a third of its men as effective for duty, and the corps was essentially destroyed as a combat force for the rest of the battle; it would be decommissioned in March 1864, its surviving units consolidated into other corps.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Tagg"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>On July 2, 1863, Army of the Potomac commander Maj.

Mills</target></link>, the fourth president of the<space/><link><target>National League</target></link>, was appointed in 1905 to determine the origin of baseball. The committee's final report, on December 30, 1907, stated, in part, that &quot;the first scheme for playing baseball, according to the best evidence obtainable to date, was devised by Abner Doubleday at Cooperstown, New York, in 1839.&quot; It concluded by saying, &quot;in the years to come, in the view of the hundreds of thousands of people who are devoted to baseball, and the millions who will be, Abner Doubleday's fame will rest evenly, if not quite as much, upon the fact that he was its inventor ... as upon his brilliant and distinguished career as an officer in the Federal Army.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>Kirsch, pp. xiii.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>However, there is considerable evidence to dispute this claim. Baseball historian George B. Kirsch has described the results of the Mills Commission as a &quot;myth&quot;. He wrote, &quot;Robert Henderson, Harold Seymour, and other scholars have since debunked the Doubleday-Cooperstown myth, which nonetheless remains powerful in the American imagination because of the efforts of Major League Baseball and the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown.&quot; At his death, Doubleday left many letters and papers, none of which describe baseball or give any suggestion that he considered himself a prominent person in the evolution of the game, and his<space/><italics>New York Times</italics><space/>obituary did not mention the game at all. Chairman Mills himself, who had been a Civil War colleague of Doubleday and a member of the honor guard for Doubleday's body as it lay in state in New York City, never recalled hearing Doubleday describe his role as the inventor. Doubleday was a cadet at West Point in the year of the alleged invention and his family had moved away from Cooperstown the prior year. Furthermore, the primary testimony to the commission that connected baseball to Doubleday was that of Abner Graves, whose credibility is questionable; a few years later, he shot his wife to death and was committed to an institution for the criminally insane for the rest of his life.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Kirschxiiixiv"></extension><space/>Part of the confusion could stem from there being another man by the same name in Cooperstown in 1839.<extension extension_name='ref'>Morris, Peter.<space/><italics>But Didn't We Have Fun</italics>.

Doubleday was a high ranking officer, whose duties included seeing to provisions for the US Army fighting throughout the south and border states.
