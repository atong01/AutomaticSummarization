The design offers more support for weight than a standard waist belt, without restricting movement of the arms, and while allowing easy access to the object carried. For example, the late 18th-century British Army's distinctive &quot;<link><target>Red coat (British army)</target><part>Red coat</part></link>&quot; uniform pattern featured a pair of white baldrics crossed at the chest, with a soldier's<space/><link><target>bayonet</target></link><space/>sheath suspended from one and his<space/><link><target>canteen (bottle)</target><part>canteen</part></link><space/>suspended from the other.
