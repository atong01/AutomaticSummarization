One '''centillion''' is a number, which is equal to either 10<sup>303</sup> or 10<sup>600</sup>, depending on [[Long and short scales|the system used]].

== Short scale ==
In areas using the short scale, such as Canada, the US, and the UK, a centillion is '''10<sup>303</sup>'''. It is formed on a pattern starting with a [[million]]: a million (1,000,000) has three zeroes more than a thousand (1,000); a billion (1,000,000,000) has two groups of three zeroes more than a thousand, and so on. One centillion has one hundred groups of three zeroes more than one thousand.

* A centillion is a thousand times more than a [[novemnonagintillion]].
* A centillion is a thousandth of an [[Names of large numbers#Extensions of the standard dictionary numbers|uncentillion]].

A centillion in the short-scale system is equivalent to a [[quinquagintilliard]], or a thousand [[quinquagintillion]], in the long-scale system.

== Long scale ==
In long scale usage, one centillion is '''10<sup>600</sup>''', which is equal to (10<sup>6</sup>)<sup>100</sup>; that is, it is the number with a hundred times as many zeroes as a million.

* A centillion is a thousand times more than a [[novemnonagintilliard]].
* A centillion is a thousandth of a [[centilliard]].
* A centillion is a million times more than a [[novemnonagintillion]].
* A centillion is a millionth of an [[Names of large numbers#Extensions of the standard dictionary numbers|uncentillion]].
A centillion in the long scale is equivalent to a cennovemnonagintillion in the short scale.<ref>http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/math/number/howhigh.html</ref>
