In [[politics]] and [[history]], a '''colony''' is a [[Territory (country subdivision)|territory]] under the immediate political control of a [[Sovereign state|state]], distinct from the home territory of the sovereign. For [[colonies in antiquity]], [[city-state]]s would often found their own colonies. Some colonies were historically countries, while others were territories without definite statehood from their inception. The '''Metropolitan state''' is the state that owns the colony. In [[Ancient Greece]], the city that founded a colony was known as the [[metropolis]]. "Mother country" is a reference to the metropolitan state from the point of view of citizens who live in its colony. There is a [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]].

Unlike a [[puppet state]] or [[satellite state]], a colony has no independent international representation, and its top-level administration is under direct control of the metropolitan state.

The term ''informal colony'' is used by some historians to refer to a country under the ''de facto'' control of another state, although this term is often contentious.

==Definitions==
The word "colony" comes from the Latin word ''colōnia''. This in turn derives from the word ''[[Colonus (person)|colōnus]]'', which means colonist but also implies a [[farmer]]. [[Cologne]] is an example of a settlement preserving this etymology. Other, less obvious settlements that began as Roman [[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]] include cities from [[Belgrade]] to [[York]]. A tell-tale sign of a settlement once being a Roman Colony is a city centre with a grid pattern.<ref>{{cite book|author=James S. Jeffers|title=The Greco-Roman world of the New Testament era: exploring the background of early Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YGmKaXiUDiYC|year=1999|publisher=InterVarsity Press|isbn=978-0-8308-1589-0|pages=[http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=YGmKaXiUDiYC&pg=PA52 52–53]}}</ref> The terminology is taken from architectural analogy, where a column pillar is beneath the (often stylized) head [[Capital (architecture)|capital]], which is also a biological analog of the body as subservient beneath the controlling head (with 'capital' coming from the Latin ''caput'', meaning 'head'). So colonies are not independently self-controlled, but rather are controlled from a separate entity that serves the capital function.

Roman colonies first appeared when the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] conquered neighbouring [[Ancient peoples of Italy|Italic peoples]]. These were small farming settlements that appeared when the Romans had subdued an enemy in war. A colony could take many forms, as a trade outpost or a military base in enemy territory. Its original definition as a settlement created by people migrating from a central region to an outlying one became the modern definition.

The United States also founded their own colonies in both the Atlantic and Pacific regions, such as [[Fort Madison, Nuku Hiva|Madisonville]] on the island of [[Nuku Hiva]] in 1813 and [[History of Liberia#Colonization (1821–1847)|Liberia]] in 1821.
* '''[[French Indochina]]'''  was formed in October 1887 from Annam, Tonkin, Cochinchina (which together form modern Vietnam) and the Kingdom of Cambodia; Laos was added after the Franco-Siamese War in 1893.

In the four protectorates, the French formally left the local rulers in power, who were the Emperors of Vietnam, Kings of Cambodia, and Kings of Luang Prabang, but in fact gathered all powers in their hands, the local rulers acting only as figureheads.
* '''[[Argentina]]''' gained its independence from Spain in 1810 and formed the modern constitution in 1853.

==Current colonies==

The [[Special Committee on Decolonization]] maintains the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]], which identifies areas the United Nations (though not without controversy) believes are colonies. Given that [[dependent territory|dependent territories]] have varying degrees of autonomy and political power in the affairs of the controlling state, there is disagreement over the classification of "colony".
