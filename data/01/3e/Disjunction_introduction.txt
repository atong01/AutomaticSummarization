'''Disjunction introduction''' or '''addition''' (also called '''or introduction''')<ref>Hurley{{full|date=January 2015}}</ref><ref>Moore and Parker{{full|date=January 2015}}</ref><ref>Copi and Cohen{{full|date=January 2015}}</ref> is a simple [[validity|valid]] [[logical form|argument form]], an [[immediate inference]] and a  [[rule of inference]] of [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]]. The rule makes it possible to introduce [[logical disjunction|disjunctions]] to [[formal proof|logical proofs]]. It is the [[inference]] that if ''P'' is true, then ''P or Q'' must be true.

:Socrates is a man.
:Therefore, either Socrates is a man or pigs are flying in formation over the English Channel.

The rule can be expressed as:
:<math>\frac{P}{\therefore P \or Q}</math>

where the rule is that whenever instances of "<math>P</math>" appear on lines of a proof, "<math>P \or Q</math>" can be placed on a subsequent line.

Disjunction introduction is controversial in [[paraconsistent logic]] because in combination with other rules of logic, it leads to [[Principle of explosion|explosion]] (i.e. everything becomes provable). See [[Paraconsistent logic#Tradeoff|Tradeoffs in Paraconsistent logic]].

== Formal notation ==
The ''disjunction introduction'' rule may be written in [[sequent]] notation:

: <math>P \vdash (P \or Q)</math>

where <math>\vdash</math> is a [[metalogic]]al symbol meaning that <math>P \or Q</math> is a [[logical consequence|syntactic consequence]] of <math>P</math> in some [[formal system|logical system]];

and expressed as a truth-functional [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] or [[theorem]] of propositional logic:

:<math>P \to (P \or Q)</math>

where <math>P</math> and <math>Q</math> are propositions expressed in some [[formal system]].
