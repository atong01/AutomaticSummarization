'''''Blade Runner''''' is a 1982 American [[neo-noir]] [[science fiction film]] directed by [[Ridley Scott]], and starring [[Harrison Ford]], [[Rutger Hauer]], [[Sean Young]], and [[Edward James Olmos]]. The screenplay, written by [[Hampton Fancher]] and [[David Peoples]], is a modified [[film adaptation]] of the 1968 novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' by [[Philip K. Dick]].

The film depicts a [[List of dystopian films|dystopian]] [[Los Angeles]] in November 2019, in which genetically engineered [[replicant]]s, which are visually indistinguishable from adult humans, are manufactured by the powerful Tyrell Corporation as well as by other "[[mega-corporation]]s" around the world. The use of  replicants on Earth is banned and they are exclusively utilized for dangerous or menial work on [[Space colonization|off-world colonies]]. Replicants who defy the ban and return to Earth are hunted down and killed ("retired") by special police operatives known as "Blade Runners". The plot focuses on a group of recently escaped replicants hiding in Los Angeles and the burnt-out expert Blade Runner, [[Rick Deckard]] (Harrison Ford), who reluctantly agrees to take on one more assignment to hunt them down.

Seven versions of the film have been shown for various markets as a result of controversial changes made by film executives. A ''[[Director's Cut]]'' was released in 1992 after a strong response to [[workprint]] screenings.

==Plot==
{{Hatnote|Note: Since there are several [[versions of Blade Runner|versions of ''Blade Runner'']], this summary excludes version-specific events.}}

In Los Angeles, November 2019, retired police officer [[Rick Deckard]] ([[Harrison Ford]]) is detained by officer [[Characters in Blade Runner#Gaff|Gaff]] ([[Edward James Olmos]]) and brought to his former supervisor, [[Characters in Blade Runner#Harry Bryant|Bryant]] ([[M. Emmet Walsh]]). Deckard, whose job as a "Blade Runner" was to track down bioengineered beings known as [[replicant]]s and destroy them, is informed that four have come to Earth illegally. As Tyrell Corporation Nexus-6 models, they have only a four-year lifespan and may have come to Earth to try to extend their lives.

Deckard watches a video of a Blade Runner named Holden administering the "Voight-Kampff" test designed to distinguish replicants from humans based on their emotional response to questions. The test subject, [[Characters in Blade Runner#Leon Kowalski|Leon]] ([[Brion James]]), shoots Holden after Holden asks about Leon's mother. Bryant wants Deckard to retire Leon and the other three replicants: [[Characters in Blade Runner#Roy Batty|Roy Batty]] ([[Rutger Hauer]]), [[Characters in Blade Runner#Zhora|Zhora]] ([[Joanna Cassidy]]), and [[Characters in Blade Runner#Pris|Pris]] ([[Daryl Hannah]]). Deckard initially refuses, but after Bryant ambiguously threatens him, he reluctantly agrees.

Deckard begins his investigation at the Tyrell Corporation to ensure that the test works on Nexus-6 models. While there, he discovers that [[Characters in Blade Runner#Dr. Eldon Tyrell|Dr. Eldon Tyrell's]] ([[Joe Turkel]]) assistant [[Characters in Blade Runner#Rachael|Rachael]] ([[Sean Young]]) is an experimental replicant who believes herself to be human. Rachael has been given false memories to provide an "emotional cushion". As a result, a more extensive test is required to determine whether she is a replicant.

Events are then set into motion that pit Deckard's search for the replicants against their search for Tyrell to force him to extend their lives. Roy and Leon investigate a replicant eye-manufacturing laboratory and learn of [[Characters in Blade Runner#J.F. Sebastian|J.F. Sebastian]] ([[William Sanderson]]), a gifted genetic designer who works closely with Tyrell. Rachael visits Deckard at his apartment to prove her humanity by showing him a family photo, but after Deckard reveals that her memories are implants from Tyrell's niece, she leaves his apartment in tears. Meanwhile, Pris locates Sebastian and manipulates him to gain his trust.

While searching Leon's hotel room, Deckard finds a photo of Zhora and a synthetic snake scale that leads him to a strip club where Zhora works. Deckard kills Zhora and shortly after is told by Bryant to also "retire" Rachael, who has disappeared from the Tyrell Corporation. After Deckard spots Rachael in a crowd, he is attacked by Leon, but Rachael kills Leon using Deckard's dropped pistol. The two return to Deckard's apartment, and during an intimate discussion, he promises not to hunt her; as she abruptly tries to leave, Deckard physically restrains her, forcing her to kiss him.

Arriving at Sebastian's apartment, Roy tells Pris the others are dead. Sympathetic to their plight, Sebastian reveals that because of "[[Methuselah]] Syndrome", a genetic [[premature aging]] disorder, his life will also be cut short. Sebastian and Roy gain entrance into Tyrell's secure penthouse, where Roy demands more life from his maker. Tyrell tells him that it is impossible. Roy confesses that he has done "questionable things" which Tyrell dismisses, praising Roy's advanced design and accomplishments in his short life. Roy kisses Tyrell, then kills him. Sebastian runs for the elevator followed by Roy, who then rides the elevator down alone.

Upon entering Sebastian's apartment, Deckard is ambushed by Pris, but he manages to kill her just as Roy returns. As Roy's body begins to shut down, he chases Deckard through the building, ending up on the roof. Deckard tries to jump to an adjacent roof, but misses and is left hanging precariously between buildings. Roy makes the jump with ease, and as Deckard's grip loosens, Roy hoists him onto the roof, saving him. As Roy's life runs out, he delivers [[Tears in rain soliloquy|a monologue]] about how his memories "will be lost like tears in the rain"; Roy dies in front of Deckard, who watches silently. Gaff arrives and shouts across to Deckard, "It's too bad she won't live, but then again, who does?" Deckard returns to his apartment and finds the door ajar, but Rachael is safe, asleep in his bed. As they leave, Deckard notices a small tin-foil [[origami]] unicorn on the floor, a familiar calling card that brings back to him Gaff's final words. Deckard and Rachael quickly leave the apartment block (and in an extended scene in the original theatrical release, they travel into daylight and an idyllic pastoral landscape).

Although ''Blade Runner'' is ostensibly an action film, it operates on multiple dramatic and narrative levels. It is indebted to [[film noir]] conventions: the ''[[femme fatale]]''; protagonist-narration (removed in later versions); dark and shadowy cinematography; and the questionable moral outlook of the hero – in this case, extended to include reflections upon the nature of his own humanity.<ref name="Barlow">Barlow, Aaron "Reel Toads and Imaginary Cities: Philip K.

''Blade Runner'' delves into the implications of technology on the environment and on society by reaching to the past, using literature, [[religious symbolism]], classical dramatic themes, and film noir. This tension between past, present, and future is mirrored in the retrofitted future of ''Blade Runner'', which is high-tech and gleaming in places but decayed and old elsewhere. Ridley Scott described the film as: "extremely dark, both literally and metaphorically, with an oddly masochistic feel", in an interview by [[Lynn Barber]] for the British Sunday newspaper ''[[The Observer]]'' in 2002. Scott "liked the idea of exploring pain" in the wake of his brother's [[skin cancer]] death: "When he was ill, I used to go and visit him in London, and that was really traumatic for me."<ref name="scottobserver" />

An aura of paranoia suffuses the film: corporate power looms large; the police seem omnipresent; vehicle and warning lights probe into buildings; and the consequences of huge biomedical power over the individual are explored – especially the consequences for replicants of their implanted memories. Control over the environment is depicted as taking place on a vast scale, hand in hand with the absence of any natural life, with artificial animals substituting for their extinct predecessors. This oppressive backdrop explains the frequently referenced migration of humans to extra-terrestrial ("off-world") colonies.<ref>{{citation |last1= Leaver |first1 = Tama |year= 1997 |title= Post-Humanism and Ecocide in William Gibson's ''Neuromancer'' and Ridley Scott's ''Blade Runner'' | url=http://project.cyberpunk.ru/idb/post-humanism_and_ecocide.html | publisher=Tama Leaver, University of Western Australia | accessdate=July 27, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703104841/http://project.cyberpunk.ru:80/idb/post-humanism_and_ecocide.html |archivedate=July 3, 2013 }}</ref>
The dystopian themes explored in ''Blade Runner'' are an early example of [[cyberpunk]] concepts expanding into film. Eyes are a recurring motif, as are manipulated images, calling into question reality and our ability to accurately perceive and remember it.<ref>{{citation |last1= Saini | first1 = Tinku |year= 1996 |url=http://kszu.standord.edu/uwi/br/tinku/ |title=Eye disbelieve |publisher=Tinku Saini, University of Washington |accessdate=January 31, 2008 |archiveurl=http://wolftrappe.blogspot.com/2006/09/eye-disbelieve-by-tinku-saini.html|archivedate = September 15, 2006}} {{Wayback|url=http://wolftrappe.blogspot.com/2006/09/eye-disbelieve-by-tinku-saini.html|date =20120328055807}}</ref><ref>{{citation |last1=McCoy |first1 = John|url= http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~syverson/309-fall95/classpage/bladerunner/mccoy/|title=The Eyes Tell All|publisher=University of Texas at Austin|accessdate=July 27, 2011|year=1995|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916221220/http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu:80/~syverson/309-fall95/classpage/bladerunner/mccoy/|archivedate=September 16, 2013}}</ref><ref>Bukatman, pp. 9–11</ref>

These thematic elements provide an atmosphere of uncertainty for ''Blade Runner''{{'}}s central theme of examining humanity. In order to discover replicants, an empathy test is used, with a number of its questions focused on the treatment of animals – seemingly an essential indicator of someone's "humanity". The replicants appear to show compassion and concern for one another and are juxtaposed against human characters who lack empathy while the mass of humanity on the streets is cold and impersonal. The film goes so far as to put in doubt whether Deckard is human, and forces the audience to re-evaluate what it means to be human.<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Kerman | first1 = Judith | year = 1991 | title = Retrofitting ''Blade Runner'': Issues in Ridley Scott's ''Blade Runner'' and Philip K.

===Casting===
{{see also|List of Blade Runner characters}}
Casting the film proved troublesome, particularly for the lead role of Deckard. Screenwriter Hampton Fancher envisioned [[Robert Mitchum]] as Deckard and wrote the character's dialogue with Mitchum in mind.<ref name="DangerousDays">{{Citation|title=Dangerous Days: Making Blade Runner|type = ''Blade Runner: The Final Cut'' DVD|publisher=[[Warner Bros.]]|year=2007}}</ref> Director Ridley Scott and the film's producers spent months meeting and discussing the role with [[Dustin Hoffman]], who eventually departed over differences in vision.<ref name="DangerousDays" /> Harrison Ford was ultimately chosen for several reasons, including his performance in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, Ford's interest in the ''Blade Runner'' story, and discussions with [[Steven Spielberg]] who was finishing ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' at the time and strongly praised Ford's work in the film.<ref name="DangerousDays" /> Following his success in films like ''Star Wars'' (1977) and ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' (1981), Ford was looking for a role with dramatic depth.<ref name="BladeRunnerNightmare"/> According to production documents, several actors were considered for the role, including [[Gene Hackman]], [[Sean Connery]], [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Paul Newman]], [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Tommy Lee Jones]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Al Pacino]], and [[Burt Reynolds]].<ref name="DangerousDays" />
One role that was not difficult to cast was [[Rutger Hauer]] as Roy Batty, the violent yet thoughtful leader of the replicants.<ref name="Ebert">{{citation | last=Ebert | first=Roger | date=September 11, 1992 | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19920911/REVIEWS/209110301/1023 | title=Blade Runner: Director's Cut | publisher=rogerebert.com | accessdate=July 27, 2011| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130304150411/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19920911/REVIEWS/209110301/1023 | archivedate=March 4, 2013 }}</ref> Scott cast Hauer without having met him, based solely on Hauer's performances in [[Paul Verhoeven]]'s movies Scott had seen (''[[Keetje Tippel|Katie Tippel]]'', ''[[Soldier of Orange]]'' and ''[[Turkish Delight (film)|Turkish Delight]]'').<ref name="DangerousDays" /> Hauer's portrayal of Batty was regarded by Philip K.

''Blade Runner'' used a number of then-lesser-known actors: [[Sean Young]] portrays Rachael, an experimental replicant implanted with the memories of Tyrell's niece, causing her to believe she is human;<ref>Sammon, pp. 92–93</ref> [[Nina Axelrod]] auditioned for the role.<ref name="DangerousDays" /> [[Daryl Hannah]] portrays Pris, a "basic pleasure model" replicant; [[Stacey Nelkin]] auditioned for the role, but was given another part in the film, which was ultimately cut before filming.<ref name="DangerousDays" /> Casting Pris and Rachael was challenging, requiring several screen tests, with [[Morgan Paull]] playing the role of Deckard. Paull was cast as Deckard's fellow bounty hunter Holden based on his performances in the tests.<ref name="DangerousDays" /> [[Brion James]] portrays Leon Kowalski, a combat replicant, and [[Joanna Cassidy]] portrays Zhora, an assassin replicant. 
[[Edward James Olmos]] portrays Gaff.

[[Joe Turkel]] portrays Dr. Eldon Tyrell, a corporate mogul who built an empire on genetically manipulated humanoid slaves. [[William Sanderson]] was cast as J. F.

Interest in adapting [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' developed shortly after its 1968 publication. Director [[Martin Scorsese]] was interested in filming the novel, but never [[option (finance)|optioned]] it.<ref>Bukatman, p. 13; Sammon, p. 23</ref> Producer [[Herb Jaffe]] optioned it in the early 1970s, but Dick was unimpressed with the screenplay written by Herb's son Robert: "Jaffe's screenplay was so terribly done&nbsp;... Robert flew down to Santa Ana to speak with me about the project. And the first thing I said to him when he got off the plane was, 'Shall I beat you up here at the airport, or shall I beat you up back at my apartment?'"<ref>Dick quoted in Sammon, p. 23</ref>

The screenplay by [[Hampton Fancher]]<!--Not titled "Android" initially&nbsp;– See Sammon, pp. 32 and 38 for explanation--> was optioned in 1977.<ref>Sammon, pp. 23–30</ref> Producer [[Michael Deeley]] became interested in Fancher's draft and convinced director Ridley Scott to film it. Scott had previously declined the project, but after leaving the slow production of ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]'', wanted a faster-paced project to take his mind off his older brother's recent death.<ref>Sammon, pp. 43–49</ref> He joined the project on February 21, 1980, and managed to push up the promised [[Filmways]] financing from US$13&nbsp;million to $15&nbsp;million. Fancher's script focused more on environmental issues and less on issues of humanity and faith, which had featured heavily in the novel, and Scott wanted changes. Fancher found a cinema treatment by [[William S. Burroughs]] for [[Alan E. Nourse]]'s novel ''[[The Bladerunner]]'' (1974), titled ''[[Blade Runner (a movie)]]''.{{refn|Some editions of Nourse's novel use the two-word spacing ''Blade Runner'', as does the Burroughs book.|group=nb}} Scott liked the name, so Deeley obtained the rights to the titles. Eventually he hired [[David Peoples]] to rewrite the script and Fancher left the job over the issue on December 21, 1980, although he later returned to contribute additional rewrites.<ref>Sammon, pp. 49–63</ref>

Having invested over $2.5&nbsp;million in pre-production,<ref>Sammon, p. 49</ref> as the date of commencement of principal photography neared, Filmways withdrew financial backing. In 10 days Deeley had secured $21.5&nbsp;million in financing through a three-way deal between [[The Ladd Company]] (through Warner Bros.), the Hong Kong-based producer [[Run Run Shaw|Sir Run Run Shaw]], and [[Tandem Productions]].<ref>Bukatman, pp. 18–19; Sammon, pp. 64–67</ref>

Philip K. Dick became concerned that no one had informed him about the film's production, which added to his distrust of Hollywood.<ref>Sammon, pp. 63–64</ref> After Dick criticized an early version of Hampton Fancher's script in an article written for the Los Angeles ''Select TV Guide'', the studio sent Dick the David Peoples rewrite.<ref>Sammon, pp. 67–69</ref> Although Dick died shortly before the film's release, he was pleased with the rewritten script, and with a 20-minute special effects test reel that was screened for him when he was invited to the studio. Despite his well known skepticism of Hollywood in principle, Dick enthused to Ridley Scott that the world created for the film looked exactly as he had imagined it.<ref name="FutureNoir-p284">Sammon, p. 284</ref> He said, "I saw a segment of [[Douglas Trumbull]]'s special effects for ''Blade Runner'' on the KNBC-TV news. I recognized it immediately. It was my own interior world. They caught it perfectly." He also approved of the film's script, saying, "After I finished reading the screenplay, I got the novel out and looked through it. The two reinforce each other, so that someone who started with the novel would enjoy the movie and someone who started with the movie would enjoy the novel."<ref name="Dick's final interview">{{citation|last=Boonstra|first=John|title=A final interview with science fiction's boldest visionary, who talks candidly about ''Blade Runner'', inner voices and the temptations of Hollywood|journal=Rod Serling's the Twilight Zone Magazine|volume=2|issue=3|date=June 1982|pages=47–52|url=http://www.philipkdick.com/media_twilightzone.html|accessdate=July 27, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528112644/http://www.philipkdick.com:80/media_twilightzone.html|archivedate=May 28, 2013}}</ref> The motion picture was dedicated to Dick.<ref>Blade Runner film, dedication after credits, 1:51:30</ref> Principal photography of ''Blade Runner'' began on March 9, 1981, and ended four months later.<ref>Sammon, p. 98</ref>

In 1992, Ford revealed, "''Blade Runner'' is not one of my favorite films.

It was a f**king {{sic}}<!--This is a direct quote from source, and is correct as written with two asterisks.--> nightmare. I thought that the film had worked without the narration.

The Voight-Kampff machine (or device) is a fictional interrogation tool, originating in the book where it is spelled ''Voigt-Kampff''. The Voight-Kampff is a [[polygraph]]-like machine used by Blade Runners to assist in the testing of an individual to determine if he or she is a replicant. It measures bodily functions such as respiration, blush response, heart rate, and eye movement in response to emotionally provocative questions.<ref>Sammon, pp. 106–107</ref> In the film two replicants take the test, Leon and Rachael, and Deckard tells Tyrell that it usually takes 20 to 30 cross-referenced questions to distinguish a replicant; in contrast with the book, where it is stated it only takes "six or seven" questions to make a determination. In the film it takes more than one hundred questions to determine that Rachael is a replicant.

===Music===
{{Main|Blade Runner (soundtrack)}}

The ''Blade Runner'' soundtrack by [[Vangelis]] is a dark melodic combination of classic composition and futuristic synthesizers which mirrors the film-noir retro-future envisioned by Ridley Scott. Vangelis, fresh from his [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning score for ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'',<ref name="NSVan">{{citation|title=Blade Runner – Scoring the music|url=http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/bladerunner/index.htm|publisher=Nemo Studios|accessdate=July 27, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019015508/http://www.nemostudios.co.uk:80/bladerunner/index.htm|archivedate=October 19, 2013}}</ref> composed and performed the music on his synthesizers.<ref>Sammon, pp. 271–274</ref> He also made use of various chimes and the vocals of collaborator [[Demis Roussos]].<ref name="FutureNoir-p419">Sammon, pp. 419–423</ref> Another memorable sound is the haunting tenor sax solo "Love Theme" by British saxophonist [[Dick Morrissey]], who performed on many of Vangelis's albums. Ridley Scott also used "Memories of Green" from the Vangelis album ''[[See You Later]], ''an orchestral version of which Scott would later use in his film ''[[Someone to Watch Over Me (film)|Someone To Watch Over Me]]''.<ref>{{Citation | last = Larsen | first = Peter | title = Film music | publisher=Reaktion Books | location = London | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-86189-341-3 |page=179}}</ref>

Along with Vangelis' compositions and ambient textures, the film's sound scape also features a track by the Japanese ensemble Nipponia – "Ogi No Mato" or "The Folding Fan as a Target" from the Nonesuch Records release ''Traditional Vocal and Instrumental Music -'' and a track by harpist Gail Laughton from "Harps of the Ancient Temples" on Laurel Records.<ref>Sammon, p. 424</ref>

Despite being well received by fans and critically acclaimed and nominated in 1983 for a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] and [[Golden Globe]] as best original score, and the promise of a soundtrack album from Polydor Records in the end titles of the film, the release of the official soundtrack recording was delayed for over a decade. There are two official releases of the music from ''Blade Runner''. In light of the lack of a release of an album, the [[New American Orchestra]] recorded an orchestral adaptation in 1982 which bore little resemblance to the original. Some of the film tracks would, in 1989, surface on the compilation ''Vangelis: Themes'', but not until the 1992 release of the ''Director's Cut'' version would a substantial amount of the film's score see commercial release.<ref name="FutureNoir-p419" />

These delays and poor reproductions led to the production of many [[bootleg recording]]s over the years. A bootleg tape surfaced in 1982 at science fiction conventions and became popular given the delay of an official release of the original recordings, and in 1993 "Off World Music, Ltd" created a bootleg CD that would prove more comprehensive than Vangelis' official CD in 1994.<ref name="FutureNoir-p419" /> A set with three CDs of ''Blade Runner''-related Vangelis music was released in 2007. Titled ''Blade Runner Trilogy'', the first disc contains the same tracks as the 1994 official soundtrack release, the second features previously unreleased music from the movie, and the third disc is all newly composed music from Vangelis, inspired by, and in the spirit of the movie.<ref>{{citation|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11110-blade-runner-trilogy-25th-anniversary/ |title=Album Review: Vangelis: ''Blade Runner Trilogy: 25th Anniversary'' |first=Mike |last=Orme |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] |accessdate=July 27, 2011 |date=February 7, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200702/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11110-blade-runner-trilogy-25th-anniversary/ |archivedate=October 29, 2013 }}</ref>

In addition to matte paintings and models, the techniques employed included multipass exposures. In some scenes, the set was lit, shot, the film rewound, and then rerecorded over with different lighting. In some cases this was done 16 times in all. The cameras were frequently [[Motion control photography|motion controlled using computers]].<ref name="adamsavage"/>  Many effects utilised techniques which had been developed during the production of ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]''.<ref>{{citation|url=http://douglastrumbull.com/key-fx-sequences-blade-runner-spinner-vehicles|title=Blade Runner: Spinner Vehicles|publisher=Trumbull Ventures|date=2010|accessdate=September 21, 2015}}</ref>

==Release==
''Blade Runner'' was released in 1,290 theaters on June 25, 1982. That date was chosen by producer [[Alan Ladd, Jr.]] because his previous highest-grossing films (''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'') had a similar opening date (25 May) in 1977 and 1979, making the date his "lucky day".<ref>Sammon, p. 309</ref>
''Blade Runner'' grossed reasonably good ticket sales according to contemporary reports; earning $6.1 million during its first weekend in theaters.<ref>{{citation|last1=Harmetz|first1=Aljean|title='E.T.' May Set Sales Record|at=Section C, Cultural Desk, page 9|publisher=The New York Times|date=June 29, 1982}}</ref> The film was released in close company to other science fiction films, including ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'', ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'', and, most significantly, ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', which had box office revenues that significant dwarfed the other film earnings.<ref>Sammon, pp. 316–317</ref>

===Critical reception===
Initial reactions among film critics were mixed. Some wrote that the plot took a back seat to the film's special effects, and did not fit the studio's marketing as an action/adventure movie.

===Versions===
{{Main|Versions of Blade Runner}}
Several different versions of ''Blade Runner'' have been shown. The original workprint version (1982, 113&nbsp;minutes) was shown for audience test previews in Denver and Dallas in March 1982. Negative responses to the previews led to the modifications resulting in the U.S. theatrical version.<ref>{{citation|last1=Kaplan|first1=Fred|title=A Cult Classic Restored, Again |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/30/movies/30kapl.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=September 30, 2007|accessdate=July 27, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220052847/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/30/movies/30kapl.html|archivedate=December 20, 2013}}</ref><ref>Sammon, p. 289</ref> The workprint was shown as a director's cut without Scott's approval at the Los Angeles Fairfax Theater in May 1990, at an AMPAS showing in April 1991, and in September and October 1991 at the Los Angeles NuArt Theater and the San Francisco Castro Theater.<ref>Bukatman, pp. 36–37; Sammon, pp. 334–340</ref> Positive responses pushed the studio to approve work on an official director's cut.<ref>Bukatman, p. 37</ref> A San Diego Sneak Preview was shown only once, in May 1982, and was almost identical to the U.S. theatrical version but contained three extra scenes not shown in any other version, including the 2007 Final Cut.<ref>Sammon, pp. 306 and 309–311</ref>

Two versions were shown in the film's 1982 theatrical release: the U.S. theatrical version (116&nbsp;minutes), known as the original version or ''Domestic Cut'', released on [[Betamax]] and VHS in 1983 and [[Laserdisc]] in 1987; and the ''International Cut'' (117&nbsp;minutes), also known as the "Criterion Edition" or "uncut version", which included more violent action scenes than the U.S. version. Although initially unavailable in the U.S., and distributed in Europe and Asia via theatrical and local Warner Home Video Laserdisc releases, it was later released on VHS and [[Criterion Collection]] Laserdisc in North America, and re-released in 1992 as a "10th Anniversary Edition".<ref>Sammon, pp. 326–329</ref>

Scott's ''Director's Cut'' (1991, 116&nbsp;minutes) was made available on VHS and Laserdisc in 1993, and on DVD in 1997. Significant changes from the theatrical version include: the removal of Deckard's voice-over; re-insertion of a unicorn sequence; and removal of the studio-imposed happy ending. Scott provided extensive notes and consultation to Warner Bros. through film preservationist Michael Arick, who was put in charge of creating the ''Director's Cut''.<ref name="Sammon, pp. 353, 365" /> Scott's ''The Final Cut'' (2007, 117&nbsp;minutes) was released by Warner Bros. theatrically on October 5, 2007, and subsequently released on DVD, [[HD DVD]], and [[Blu-ray Disc]] in December 2007.<ref name="thedigitalbits" /> This is the only version over which Scott had complete editorial control.<ref name="Sammon, pp. 353, 365" />

Among the folklore that has developed around the film over the years has been the belief that the film was a curse to the companies whose logos were displayed prominently as [[product placement]]s in some scenes.<ref>Sammon, p. 104</ref> While they were market leaders at the time, [[Atari]], [[Bell System|Bell]], [[Cuisinart]] and [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] experienced setbacks after the film's release.

Before the film's [[principal photography]] began, ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' magazine commissioned Paul M. Sammon to write an article about ''Blade Runner''{{'}}s production which became the book ''Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner''.<ref>{{citation |url= http://www.brmovie.com/Encyclopedia/PQRST.HTML |title= Encyclopedia Blade Runner|accessdate=January 22, 2008 |publisher=BRmovie.com |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080316193547/http://www.brmovie.com/Encyclopedia/PQRST.HTML |archivedate = March 16, 2008}}</ref>
The book chronicles ''Blade Runner''{{'}}s evolution, focusing on film-set politics, especially the British director's experiences with his first American film crew; of which producer [[Alan Ladd, Jr.]] has said, "Harrison wouldn't speak to Ridley and Ridley wouldn't speak to Harrison.

Philip K. Dick refused a $400,000 offer to write a ''Blade Runner'' novelization, saying: "[I was] told the cheapo novelization would have to appeal to the twelve-year-old audience" and "[it] would have probably been disastrous to me artistically." He added, "That insistence on my part of bringing out the original novel and not doing the novelization – they were just furious. They finally recognized that there was a legitimate reason for reissuing the novel, even though it cost them money. It was a victory not just of contractual obligations but of theoretical principles."<ref name="Dick's final interview" /> ''Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?'' was eventually reprinted as a [[movie tie-in (book)|tie-in]], with the film poster as a cover and the original title in parentheses below the ''Blade Runner'' title.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://books.google.com/?id=n0pzCsR6yDQC|title=Blade runner: (Do androids dream of electric sheep)|last=Dick|first=Philip K.|year=2007|publisher=Del Rey Books|page=216|accessdate=July 27, 2011|isbn=978-0-345-35047-3}}</ref>

There are two video games based on the film, [[Blade Runner (1985 video game)|one from 1985]] for [[Commodore 64]], [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]] by CRL Group PLC based on the music by Vangelis (due to licensing issues), and [[Blade Runner (1997 video game)|another action adventure PC game from 1997]] by [[Westwood Studios]].
