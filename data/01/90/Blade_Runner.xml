As Tyrell Corporation Nexus-6 models, they have only a four-year lifespan and may have come to Earth to try to extend their lives.</paragraph><paragraph>Deckard watches a video of a Blade Runner named Holden administering the &quot;Voight-Kampff&quot; test designed to distinguish replicants from humans based on their emotional response to questions. The test subject,<space/><link><target>Characters in Blade Runner#Leon Kowalski</target><part>Leon</part></link><space/>(<link><target>Brion James</target></link>), shoots Holden after Holden asks about Leon's mother.

Rachael has been given false memories to provide an &quot;emotional cushion&quot;. As a result, a more extensive test is required to determine whether she is a replicant.</paragraph><paragraph>Events are then set into motion that pit Deckard's search for the replicants against their search for Tyrell to force him to extend their lives. Roy and Leon investigate a replicant eye-manufacturing laboratory and learn of<space/><link><target>Characters in Blade Runner#J.F. Sebastian</target><part>J.F. Sebastian</part></link><space/>(<link><target>William Sanderson</target></link>), a gifted genetic designer who works closely with Tyrell. Rachael visits Deckard at his apartment to prove her humanity by showing him a family photo, but after Deckard reveals that her memories are implants from Tyrell's niece, she leaves his apartment in tears. Meanwhile, Pris locates Sebastian and manipulates him to gain his trust.</paragraph><paragraph>While searching Leon's hotel room, Deckard finds a photo of Zhora and a synthetic snake scale that leads him to a strip club where Zhora works. Deckard kills Zhora and shortly after is told by Bryant to also &quot;retire&quot; Rachael, who has disappeared from the Tyrell Corporation. After Deckard spots Rachael in a crowd, he is attacked by Leon, but Rachael kills Leon using Deckard's dropped pistol. The two return to Deckard's apartment, and during an intimate discussion, he promises not to hunt her; as she abruptly tries to leave, Deckard physically restrains her, forcing her to kiss him.</paragraph><paragraph>Arriving at Sebastian's apartment, Roy tells Pris the others are dead. Sympathetic to their plight, Sebastian reveals that because of &quot;<link><target>Methuselah</target></link><space/>Syndrome&quot;, a genetic<space/><link><target>premature aging</target></link><space/>disorder, his life will also be cut short. Sebastian and Roy gain entrance into Tyrell's secure penthouse, where Roy demands more life from his maker. Tyrell tells him that it is impossible. Roy confesses that he has done &quot;questionable things&quot; which Tyrell dismisses, praising Roy's advanced design and accomplishments in his short life. Roy kisses Tyrell, then kills him. Sebastian runs for the elevator followed by Roy, who then rides the elevator down alone.</paragraph><paragraph>Upon entering Sebastian's apartment, Deckard is ambushed by Pris, but he manages to kill her just as Roy returns. As Roy's body begins to shut down, he chases Deckard through the building, ending up on the roof. Deckard tries to jump to an adjacent roof, but misses and is left hanging precariously between buildings. Roy makes the jump with ease, and as Deckard's grip loosens, Roy hoists him onto the roof, saving him. As Roy's life runs out, he delivers<space/><link><target>Tears in rain soliloquy</target><part>a monologue</part></link><space/>about how his memories &quot;will be lost like tears in the rain&quot;; Roy dies in front of Deckard, who watches silently. Gaff arrives and shouts across to Deckard, &quot;It's too bad she won't live, but then again, who does?&quot; Deckard returns to his apartment and finds the door ajar, but Rachael is safe, asleep in his bed. As they leave, Deckard notices a small tin-foil<space/><link><target>origami</target></link><space/>unicorn on the floor, a familiar calling card that brings back to him Gaff's final words. Deckard and Rachael quickly leave the apartment block (and in an extended scene in the original theatrical release, they travel into daylight and an idyllic pastoral landscape).</paragraph><heading level='2'>Themes</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Themes in Blade Runner</arg></template><link><target>File:Blade Runner sun window.png</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>320px</part><part>alt=A screen-shot from the film depicts a large room as we look between two rows of pillars.

This tension between past, present, and future is mirrored in the retrofitted future of<space/><italics>Blade Runner</italics>, which is high-tech and gleaming in places but decayed and old elsewhere. Ridley Scott described the film as: &quot;extremely dark, both literally and metaphorically, with an oddly masochistic feel&quot;, in an interview by<space/><link><target>Lynn Barber</target></link><space/>for the British Sunday newspaper<space/><italics><link><target>The Observer</target></link></italics><space/>in 2002. Scott &quot;liked the idea of exploring pain&quot; in the wake of his brother's<space/><link><target>skin cancer</target></link><space/>death: &quot;When he was ill, I used to go and visit him in London, and that was really traumatic for me.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="scottobserver"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>An aura of paranoia suffuses the film: corporate power looms large; the police seem omnipresent; vehicle and warning lights probe into buildings; and the consequences of huge biomedical power over the individual are explored especially the consequences for replicants of their implanted memories. Control over the environment is depicted as taking place on a vast scale, hand in hand with the absence of any natural life, with artificial animals substituting for their extinct predecessors. This oppressive backdrop explains the frequently referenced migration of humans to extra-terrestrial (&quot;off-world&quot;) colonies.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>citation</target><arg name="last1"><space/>Leaver<space/></arg><arg name="first1"><space/>Tama<space/></arg><arg name="year"><space/>1997<space/></arg><arg name="title"><space/>Post-Humanism and Ecocide in William Gibson's ''Neuromancer'' and Ridley Scott's ''Blade Runner''<space/></arg><arg name="url">http://project.cyberpunk.ru/idb/post-humanism_and_ecocide.html<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Tama Leaver, University of Western Australia<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">July 27, 2011</arg><arg name="archiveurl">https://web.archive.org/web/20130703104841/http://project.cyberpunk.ru:80/idb/post-humanism_and_ecocide.html<space/></arg><arg name="archivedate">July 3, 2013<space/></arg></template></extension>The dystopian themes explored in<space/><italics>Blade Runner</italics><space/>are an early example of<space/><link><target>cyberpunk</target></link><space/>concepts expanding into film.
