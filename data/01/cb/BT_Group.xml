In 1896, the National Telephone Company was taken over by the General Post Office. In 1912 it became the primary supplier of telecommunications services, after the Post Office took over the private sector telephone service in GB, except for a few local authority services.

A committee was set up to look into the advantages and disadvantages of the proposal, and its findings were found to be favourable enough for the Government to re-establish a Steering Group on the Organisation of the Post Office.

At this time the first steps were taken to introduce competition into British telecommunications industry. In particular, the Act empowered the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, as well as British Telecommunications, to license other operators to run public telecommunications systems. Additionally, a framework was established which enabled the Secretary of State to set standards with the<space/><link><target>British Standards Institution</target></link><space/>(BSI) for apparatus supplied to the public by third parties, and had the effect of requiring British Telecommunications to connect approved apparatus to its systems. The Secretary of State made use of these new powers and began the process of opening up the apparatus supply market, where a phased programme of liberalisation was started in 1981. In 1982, a licence was granted to Cable &amp; Wireless to run a public telecommunications network through its subsidiary,<space/><link><target>Mercury Communications Ltd</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="BT History"></extension><extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/mercury-communications-ltd-history/'>History of Mercury Communications</link><space/>fundinguniverse.com</extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>1982 to 1991</heading><paragraph>On 19 July 1982, the Government formally announced its intention to privatise British Telecommunications with the sale of up to 51% of the company's shares to private investors. This intention was confirmed by the passing of the<space/><link><target>Telecommunications Act 1984</target></link>, which received Royal Assent on 12 April that year. The transfer to British Telecommunications plc of the business of British Telecommunications, the statutory corporation, took place on 6 August 1984 and, on 20 November 1984, more than 50 per cent of British Telecommunications shares were sold to the public. At the time, this was the largest share issue in the world.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.expressandstar.com/days/1976-2000/1984.html'>Tory conference bombed</link><space/>Express and Star.

Commercial freedom granted to British Telecommunications allowed it to enter into new joint ventures and, if it so decided, to engage in the manufacture of its own apparatus. The company's transfer into the private sector continued in December 1991 when the Government sold around half its remaining holding of 47.6% of shares, reducing its stake to 21.8%. Substantially all the government's remaining shares were sold in a third flotation in July 1993, raising 5&amp;nbsp;billion for the Treasury and introducing 750,000 new shareholders to the company.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/investing/8898538/Privatisation-shares-how-have-they-fared.html'>Privatisation shares how have they fared?</link><space/>The Telegraph, 18 November 2011</extension></paragraph><paragraph>The 1984 Act also abolished British Telecommunications's exclusive privilege of running telecommunications systems and established a framework to safeguard the workings of competition. This meant that British Telecommunications finally lost its monopoly in running telecommunications systems, which it had technically retained under the 1981 Act despite the Secretary of State's licensing powers. It now required a licence in the same way as any other telecommunications operator. The principal licence granted to British Telecommunications laid down strict and extensive conditions affecting the range of its activities, including those of manufacture and supply of apparatus.<extension extension_name='ref' name="BT History"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>In 1985,<space/><link><target>Cellnet</target></link><space/>was launched as a subsidiary of Telecom Securicor Cellular Radio Limited, a 60:40 venture between British Telecommunications and<space/><link><target>G4S</target><part>Securicor</part></link><space/>respectively.

The new policy enabled customers to acquire telecommunications services from competing providers using a variety of technologies.
