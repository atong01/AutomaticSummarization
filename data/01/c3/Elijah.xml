When Elijah finds her and asks to be fed, she says that she does not have sufficient food to keep her and her own son alive. Elijah tells her that God will not allow her supply of flour or oil to run out, saying, &quot;Don't be afraid..this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: 'The jar of flour will not be used up and the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the Lord gives rain on the land.&quot; She feeds him the last of their food, and Elijah's promise miraculously comes true; thus, by an act of faith the woman received the promised blessing. God gave her &quot;<link><target>manna</target></link>&quot; from heaven even while he was withholding food from his unfaithful people in the promised land. Some time later the widow's son dies and the widow cries, &quot;Did you come to remind me of my sin and kill my son?&quot; Moved by a faith like that of<space/><link><target>Abraham</target></link><space/>(Romans 4:17, Hebrews 11:19), Elijah prays that God might restore her son so that the veracity and trustworthiness of God's word might be demonstrated.<space/><template><target>Bibleverse</target><arg>1</arg><arg>Kings</arg><arg>17:22</arg><arg>HE</arg></template><space/>relates how God &quot;heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.&quot; This is the first instance of raising the dead recorded in Scripture. This non-Israelite widow was granted the best covenant blessing in the person of her son, the only hope for a widow in ancient society. The widow cried, &quot;...the word of the Lord from your mouth is the truth.&quot; She made a confession that the Israelites had failed to make.</paragraph><paragraph>After more than three years of drought and famine, God tells Elijah to return to Ahab and announce the end of the drought: not occasioned by repentance in Israel but by the command of the Lord, who had determined to reveal himself again to his people. While on his way, Elijah meets<space/><link><target>Obadiah (1 Kings)</target><part>Obadiah</part></link>, the head of Ahab's household, who had hidden a hundred prophets of the<space/><link><target>Yahweh</target><part>God of Israel</part></link><space/>when Ahab and Jezebel had been killing them.

Elijah then berates both the people of Israel and Ahab for their acquiescence in Baal worship. How long will you go limping with two different opinions? If the Lord is God, follow him; but if Baal then follow him (<template><target>Bibleverse</target><arg>1</arg><arg>Kings</arg><arg>18:21</arg><arg>HE</arg></template>). And the people were silent. The Hebrew for this word, &quot;go limping&quot; or &quot;waver&quot;, is the same as that used for &quot;danced&quot; in verse 26, where the prophets of Baal frantically dance. Elijah speaks with sharp irony: in the religious ambivalence of Israel, he is portraying here as engaging in a wild and futile religious &quot;dance&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>At this point Elijah proposes a direct test of the powers of Baal and Yahweh. The people of Israel, 450 prophets of Baal, and 400 prophets of<space/><link><target>Asherah</target></link><space/>are summoned to<space/><link><target>Mount Carmel, Israel</target><part>Mount Carmel</part></link>. Two altars are built, one for Baal and one for Yahweh. Wood is laid on the altars. Two oxen are slaughtered and cut into pieces; the pieces are laid on the wood. Elijah then invites the priests of Baal to pray for fire to light the sacrifice. They pray from morning to noon without success. Elijah ridicules their efforts. They respond by cutting themselves and adding their own blood to the sacrifice (such mutilation of the body was strictly forbidden in the Mosaic law). They continue praying until evening without success.</paragraph><paragraph>Elijah now orders that the altar of Yahweh be drenched with water from &quot;four large jars&quot; poured three times (<template><target>Bibleverse</target><arg>1</arg><arg>Kings</arg><arg>18:33–34</arg><arg>NIV</arg></template>). He asks God to accept the sacrifice. Fire falls from the sky, consuming the water, the sacrifice and the stones of the altar itself as well. Elijah then orders the death of the prophets of Baal. Elijah prays earnestly for rain to fall again on the land. Then the rains begin, signaling the end of the famine.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Mount Horeb</heading><paragraph><link><target>Jezebel (Bible)</target><part>Jezebel</part></link>, enraged that Elijah had ordered the deaths of her priests, threatens to kill Elijah (<template><target>Bibleverse</target><arg>1</arg><arg>Kings</arg><arg>19:1–13</arg><arg>HE</arg></template>). Later Elijah would prophesy about Jezebel's death, because of her sin. Later, Elijah flees to<space/><link><target>Beersheba</target></link><space/>in<space/><link><target>Kingdom of Judah</target><part>Judah</part></link>, continues alone into the wilderness, and finally sits down under a<space/><link><target>Retama</target><trail>ine</trail></link><space/>shrub, praying for death. He falls asleep under the tree; the<space/><link><target>angel of the Lord</target></link><space/>touches him and tells him to wake up and eat. When he awakens he finds bread and a jar of water. He eats, drinks, and goes back to sleep. The angel comes a second time and tells him to eat and drink because he has a long journey ahead of him.</paragraph><paragraph>Elijah travels for forty days and forty nights to<space/><link><target>Mount Horeb</target></link>, where<space/><link><target>Moses</target></link><space/>had received the<space/><link><target>Ten Commandments</target></link>. Elijah is the only person described in the Bible as returning to Horeb, after Moses and his generation had left Horeb several centuries before. He seeks shelter in a<space/><link><target>Cave of Elijah</target><part>cave</part></link>. God again speaks to Elijah (<template><target>Bibleverse</target><arg>1</arg><arg>Kings</arg><arg>19:9</arg><arg>HE</arg></template>): &quot;What doest thou here, Elijah?&quot;. Elijah did not give a direct answer to the Lord's question but evades and equivocates, implying that the work the Lord had begun centuries earlier had now come to nothing, and that his own work was fruitless. Unlike Moses, who tried to defend Israel when they sinned with the golden calf, Elijah bitterly complains over the Israelites' unfaithfulness and says he is the &quot;only one left&quot;. Up until this time Elijah has only the word of God to guide him, but now he is told to go outside the cave and &quot;stand before the Lord.&quot; A terrible wind passes, but God is not in the wind. A great earthquake shakes the mountain, but God is not in the earthquake. Then a fire passes the mountain, but God is not in the fire. Then a &quot;still small voice&quot; comes to Elijah and asks again, &quot;What doest thou here, Elijah?&quot; Elijah again evades the question and his lament is unrevised, showing that he did not understand the importance of the divine revelation he had just witnessed.

Ahab desires to have the vineyard of<space/><link><target>Naboth</target></link><space/>of<space/><link><target>Jezreel (city)</target><part>Jezreel</part></link>. He offers a better vineyard or a fair price for the land. But Naboth tells Ahab that God has told him not to part with the land. Ahab accepts this answer with sullen bad grace. Jezebel, however, plots a method for acquiring the land. She sends letters, in Ahab's name, to the elders and nobles who lived near Naboth. They are to arrange a feast and invite Naboth. At the feast, false charges of cursing God and Ahab are to be made against him. The plot is carried out and Naboth is stoned to death. When word comes that Naboth is dead, Jezebel tells Ahab to take possession of the vineyard.</paragraph><paragraph>God again speaks to Elijah and sends him to confront Ahab with a question and a prophecy: &quot;Have you killed and also taken possession?&quot; and, &quot;In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick up your own blood&quot; (<template><target>Bibleverse</target><arg>1</arg><arg>Kings</arg><arg>21:19</arg><arg>HE</arg></template>). Ahab begins the confrontation by calling Elijah his enemy. Elijah responds by throwing the charge back at him, telling him that he has made himself the enemy of God by his own actions. Elijah then goes beyond the prophecy he was given and tells Ahab that his entire kingdom will reject his authority; that Jezebel will be eaten by dogs within Jezreel; and that his family will be consumed by dogs as well (if they die in a city) or by birds (if they die in the country). When Ahab hears this he repents to such a degree that God relents in punishing Ahab but will punish Jezebel and their son<link><target>Ahaziah of Israel</target><part>Ahaziah</part></link>.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Ahaziah</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Elijah.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part><link><target>Russian icon</target></link><space/>of the Prophet Elijah, 18th century (<link><target>Iconostasis</target></link><space/>of<space/><link><target>Kizhi</target></link><space/><link><target>monastery</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Karelia</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Russia</target></link>).</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>Elijah continues now from Ahab to an encounter with<space/><link><target>Ahaziah of Israel</target><part>Ahaziah</part></link>.

Elijah intercepts his messengers and sends them back to Ahaziah with a message. In typical Elijah fashion, the message begins with a blunt, impertinent question: &quot;Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baalzebub, the god of Ekron?&quot;(<template><target>Bibleverse</target><arg>2</arg><arg>Kings</arg><arg>1:6</arg><arg>HE</arg></template>). Ahaziah asks the messengers to describe the person who gave them this message. They tell him he wore a hairy coat with a leather belt and he instantly recognizes the description as Elijah the Tishbite.</paragraph><paragraph>Ahaziah sends out three groups of soldiers to arrest Elijah. The first two are destroyed by fire which Elijah calls down from heaven. The leader of the third group asks for mercy for himself and his men.

A letter is sent under the prophet's name to<space/><link><target>Jehoram of Judah</target></link>. It tells him that he has led the people of Judah astray in the same way that Israel was led astray. The prophet ends the letter with a prediction of a painful death. This letter is a puzzle to readers for several reasons. First, it concerns a king of the southern kingdom, while Elijah concerned himself with the kingdom of Israel. Second, the message begins with &quot;Thus says<space/><link><target>YHVH</target></link>, God of your father David...&quot; rather than the more usual &quot;...in the name of<space/><link><target>YHVH</target></link><space/>the God of Israel.&quot; Also, this letter seems to come after Elijah's ascension into the whirlwind.<space/><link><target>Michael Wilcock</target></link><space/>suggests a number of possible reasons for this letter, among them that it may be an example of a better known prophet's name being substituted for that of a lesser known prophet.<extension extension_name='ref'>Myers, J.

The volume of references to Elijah in Jewish Tradition stands in marked contrast to that in the Canon. As in the case of most figures of Jewish legend, so in the case of Elijah, the biblical account became the basis of later legend. Elijah the precursor of the Messiah, Elijah zealous in the cause of God, Elijah the helper in distress: these are the three leading notes struck by the Aggadah, endeavoring to complete the biblical picture with the Elijah legends. His career is extensive, colorful, and varied. He has appeared the world over in the guise of a beggar and scholar.</paragraph><paragraph>From the time of<space/><link><target>Malachi</target></link>, who says of Elijah that God will send him before &quot;the great and dreadful day&quot; (Mal. 3:23), down to the later stories of the Chasidic rabbis, reverence and love, expectation and hope, were always connected in the Jewish consciousness with Elijah.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Origin</heading><paragraph>Three different theories regarding Elijah's origin are presented in the Aggadah literature:(1) he belonged to the tribe of Gad (Midrash Genensis Rabbah lxxi.)(2) he was a Benjamite from Jerusalem, identical with the Elijah mentioned in I Chron. viii:27(3) he was a priest.</paragraph><paragraph>Many Christian Church fathers also (Aphraates, &quot;Homilies,&quot; ed. Wright, p.&amp;nbsp;314; Epiphanius, &quot;Hres.&quot; lv. 3, passim) have stated that Elijah was a priest.

A<space/><link><target>midrash</target></link><space/>tells that they even abolished the sign of the covenant, and the prophet had to appear as Israel's accuser before God (Pire R. El. xxix.).</paragraph><paragraph>In the same cave where God once appeared to Moses and revealed Himself as gracious and merciful, Elijah was summoned to appear before God. By this summons he perceived that he should have appealed to God's mercy, instead of becoming Israel's accuser. The prophet, however, remained relentless in his zeal and severity, so that God commanded him to appoint his successor (Tanna debe Eliyahu Zua viii.).</paragraph><paragraph>The vision in which God revealed Himself to Elijah gave him at the same time a picture of the destinies of man, who has to pass through &quot;four worlds.&quot; This world was shown to the prophet in the form of the wind, since it disappears as the wind; storm () is the day of death, before which man trembles (); fire is the judgment in Gehenna, and the stillness is the last day (Tan., Peude, p.&amp;nbsp;128, Vienna ed.).</paragraph><paragraph>Three years after this vision (Seder 'Olam R. xvii.) Elijah was &quot;translated.&quot; Concerning the place to which Elijah was transferred, opinions differ among Jews and Christians, but the old view was that Elijah was received among the heavenly inhabitants, where he records the deeds of men (id. 70; Ber. R. xxxiv. 8), a task which according to the apocalyptic literature is entrusted to Enoch.</paragraph><paragraph>But as early as the middle of the 2nd century, when the notion of translation to heaven was very much changed by Christian theologians, the assertion was made that Elijah never entered into heaven proper (Suk. 5a). In later literature paradise is generally designated as the abode of Elijah (compare Pire R. El. xvi.), but since the location of paradise is itself uncertain, the last two statements may be identical.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Elijah in Judaism</heading><heading level='3'>Elijah's chair</heading><paragraph><template><target>See also</target><arg>Brit milah</arg></template><link><target>File:Chair of Elijah.JPG</target><part>thumb</part><part>&quot;Chair of Elijah&quot; used during the<space/><link><target>brit milah</target></link><space/>(circumcision) ceremony.

The rabbi, a friend of Elijahs, was asked what favor he might wish. The rabbi answered only that he be able to join Elijah in his wanderings. Elijah granted his wish only if he refrained from asking any questions about any of the prophets actions. He agreed and they began their journey. The first place they came to was the house of an elderly couple who were so poor they had only one old cow. The old couple gave of their hospitality as best they could. The next morning, as the travelers left, Elijah prayed that the old cow would die and it did. The second place they came to was the home of a wealthy man. He had no patience for his visitors and chased them away with the admonition that they should get jobs and not beg from honest people. As they were leaving, they passed the mans wall and saw that it was crumbling. Elijah prayed that the wall be repaired and it was so. Next, they came to a wealthy synagogue. They were allowed to spend the night with only the smallest of provisions. When they left, Elijah prayed that every member of the synagogue might become a leader.</paragraph><paragraph>Finally, they came to a very poor synagogue. Here they were treated with great courtesy and hospitality. When they left, Elijah prayed that God might give them a single wise leader. At this Rabbi Joshua could no longer hold back. He demanded of Elijah an explanation of his actions. At the house of the old couple, Elijah knew that the Angel of Death was coming for the old woman. So he prayed that God might have the angel take the cow instead. At the house of the wealthy man, there was a great treasure hidden in the crumbling wall. Elijah prayed that the wall be restored thus keeping the treasure away from the miser. The story ends with a moral: A synagogue with many leaders will be ruined by many arguments. A town with a single wise leader will be guided to success and prosperity. Know then, that if thou seest an evil-doer prosper, it is not always unto his advantage, and if a righteous man suffers need and distress, think not God is unjust.<extension extension_name='ref'>Ginzberg, Lewis.<space/><italics>Legends of the Bible.</italics><space/>Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956. p 599.</extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Rabbi Eliezer</heading><paragraph>The Elijah of legend did not lose any of his ability to afflict the comfortable.

Elijah lived in the reign of Ahab (B.C. 896874) and Ahaziah (B.C. 874872), kings of the (northern) kingdom of Israel or Samaria. He was a prophet of the desert, like John the Baptist, unlike our holy Prophet, who took part in, controlled, and guided all the affairs of his people. Both Ahab and Azariah were prone to lapse into the worship of Baal, the sun-god worshipped in Syria. That worship also included the worship of nature-powers and procreative powers, as in the Hindu worship of the Lingam, and led to many abuses. King Ahab had married a princess of Sidon, Jezebel, a wicked woman who led her husband to forsake Allah and adopt Baal-worship.&quot;Elijah denounced all Ahab's sins as well as the sins of Ahaziah and had to flee for his life. Eventually, according to the Old Testament (4 Kings, 2:11) he was taken up in a whirlwind to heaven in a chariot of fire after he had left his mantle with Elisha the prophet.&quot;</extension><space/>He is seen by<space/><link><target>Muslim</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>to be the prophetic predecessor to<space/><link><target>Elisha</target></link>.

It can be shown that a letter was received by Jehoram, King of Judah, from Elijah, after Elijah was taken to heaven. Either the letter was written before he went to heaven and delivered by a messenger on earth (unlikely), or Elijah was &quot;caught away&quot; as was Philip from the Gaza Road to Azotas, (about 17 miles, Acts 8:39,40) for an unspecified purpose and returned to the earth. Consider the evidence: 1. Elijah had been taken to heaven in a whirlwind. (2 Kings 2:11). 2. Elisha had taken over the duties of Elijah in the reign of Jehoshaphat. (2 Kings 3:10,11)., 3. Jehoram received a letter from Elijah, the prophet. (2 Chron. 21:1, 912). King Jehoram reigned after Jehoshaphat.
