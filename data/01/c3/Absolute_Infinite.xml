A [[cardinal number|multiplicity]] is called [[well-ordered]] if it fulfills the condition that every sub-multiplicity has a first [[element (mathematics)|element]]; such a multiplicity I call for short a "sequence".<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Now I envisage the system of all [ordinal] numbers and denote it ''Ω''.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
The system ''Ω'' in its natural ordering according to magnitude is a "sequence".<br />
Now let us adjoin 0 as an additional element to this sequence, and place it, obviously, in the first position; then we obtain a sequence ''Ω′'':<br />
<br />
0, 1, 2, 3, ... &omega;<sub>0</sub>, &omega;<sub>0</sub>+1, ..., &gamma;, ...
<br />
of which one can readily convince oneself that every number γ occurring in it is the type [i.e., order-type] of the sequence of all its preceding elements (including 0). (The sequence ''Ω'' has this property first for ω<sub>0</sub>+1. [ω<sub>0</sub>+1 should be ω<sub>0</sub>.])<br />
<br />
Now ''Ω&prime;'' (and therefore also ''Ω'') cannot be a consistent multiplicity. For if ''Ω&prime;'' were consistent, then as a well-ordered set, a number ''δ'' would correspond to it which would be greater than all numbers of the system ''Ω''; the number ''δ'', however, also belongs to the system ''Ω'', because it comprises all numbers. Thus ''δ'' would be greater than ''δ'', which is a contradiction. Therefore:<br />
<br />
''The system Ω of all [ordinal] numbers is an inconsistent, absolutely infinite multiplicity.''</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>The Burali-Forti paradox</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Burali-Forti paradox</arg></template>The idea that the collection of all ordinal numbers cannot logically exist seems<space/><link><target>paradoxical</target></link><space/>to many. This is related to<space/><link><target>Burali-Forti paradox</target><part>Cesare Burali-Forti's &quot;paradox&quot;</part></link><space/>which states that there can be no greatest<space/><link><target>ordinal number</target></link>. All of these problems can be traced back to the idea that, for every property that can be logically defined, there exists a set of all objects that have that property. However, as in Cantor's argument (above), this idea leads to difficulties.</paragraph><paragraph>More generally, as noted by<space/><link><target>A.W. Moore (mathematician)</target><part>A.W. Moore</part></link>, there can be no end to the process of<space/><link><target>set (mathematics)</target><part>set</part></link><space/>formation, and thus no such thing as the<space/><italics>totality of all sets</italics>, or the<space/><italics>set hierarchy</italics>. Any such totality would itself have to be a set, thus lying somewhere within the<space/><link><target>cumulative hierarchy</target><part>hierarchy</part></link><space/>and thus failing to contain every set.</paragraph><paragraph>A standard solution to this problem is found in<space/><link><target>Zermelo set theory</target><part>Zermelo's set theory</part></link>, which does not allow the unrestricted formation of sets from arbitrary properties. Rather, we may form the set of all objects that have a given property<space/><italics>and lie in some given set</italics><space/>(Zermelo's<space/><link><target>Axiom schema of specification</target><part>Axiom of Separation</part></link>). This allows for the formation of sets based on properties, in a limited sense, while (hopefully) preserving the consistency of the theory.</paragraph><paragraph>While this solves the logical problem, one could argue that the philosophical problem remains. It seems natural that a set of individuals ought to exist, so long as the individuals exist. Indeed,<space/><link><target>naive set theory</target></link><space/>might be said to be based on this notion. Although Zermelo's fix allows a<space/><link><target>Class (set theory)</target><part>class</part></link><space/>to describe arbitrary (possibly &quot;large&quot;) entities, these predicates of the<space/><link><target>meta-language</target></link><space/>may have no formal existence (i.e., as a set) within the theory. For example, the class of all sets would be a<space/><link><target>proper class</target></link>.
