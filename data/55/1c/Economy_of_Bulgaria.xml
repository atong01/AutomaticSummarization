During the 1930s, the Bulgarian economy was described as an economy militarily bound to Germany. In the early 1940s, as Germany began to lose the Second World War, the Bulgarian economy suffered a decline.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>bg icon</target></template><space/><link type='external' href='http://valtcheva.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=37&amp;amp;Itemid=26'><space/>XX .

During the Socialism era, Bulgarian economy continued to be industrialized, although free market trade substantially decreased, as private market initiatives became state-regulated. Still, the Bulgarian economy made significant overall progress in modernizing<space/><link><target>transport infrastructure</target><part>road infrastructure</part></link>, airline transportation, as well as developing the tourism sector by building tourist resorts along the Black sea coast and the mountain regions.</paragraph><paragraph>From the end of World War II until the widespread change of regime in<space/><link><target>Eastern Europe</target></link><space/>in November 1989, the<space/><link><target>Bulgarian Communist Party</target></link><space/>(BCP) exerted complete economic, social and political control in Bulgaria. The party's ascent to power in 1944 had marked the beginning of economic change towards<space/><link><target>planned economy</target></link>. During that time, Bulgaria followed the Soviet model of economic development more closely than any other member of the Eastern Bloc, while becoming one of the first members of<space/><link><target>Comecon</target></link>. The new regime shifted the economy type from a predominantly agrarian one towards an<space/><link><target>industrial economy</target></link>, while encouraging the relocation of the labour force from the countryside to the cities, thus providing workers for the newly built large-scale industrial complexes. At the same time, the focus of Bulgarian international trade shifted from Central Europe to Eastern Europe and the USSR.<extension extension_name='ref' name="csecon">William Marsteller. &quot;The Economy&quot;.<space/><link type='external' href='http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/bgtoc.html'>Bulgaria country study</link><space/>(Glenn E.

Bulgarian economy closely resembled that of the Soviet Union.

That represented a change on the Bulgarian political scene as political turbulence was common before BCP's ascent to power.<extension extension_name='ref' name="csecon"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Nonetheless, beginning in the early 1960s, low capital and labour productivity, as well as expensive material inputs, plagued the Bulgarian economy. With disappointing rates of growth came a high degree of economic experimentation. This experimentation took place within the socialist economic framework, although never approaching a market-based economy.<extension extension_name='ref' name="csecon"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>In the late 1980s, continuing poor economic performance intensified economic hardship. By that time, the misdirection and irrationality of BCP economic policies had become quite clear.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">November 2014</arg></template><space/>Bulgaria's economy contracted dramatically after 1987 when Comecon, with which the Bulgarian economy had integrated closely, dissolved. On 10 November 1989, at the November plenum of BCP,<space/><link><target>Todor Zhivkov</target></link><space/>was dismissed from his long-held party leader and head of state positions. The communist regime gave way to democratic elections and government. Unlike the communist parties in most other Eastern European states, the BCP (changing its name to<space/><link><target>Bulgarian Socialist Party</target></link>) retained power by winning the first free national elections in June 1990. That was made possible by changes in party leadership, programme, reduction of its power base and other moves which permitted economic re-orientation toward a market system. This difficult transition combined with political vagueness and unpreparedness of the Bulgarian people for social and economic changes led to dramatically worsening economic conditions during the early 1990s.<extension extension_name='ref' name="csecon"></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>1990-2000</heading><paragraph>Economic performance declined dramatically at the beginning of the 1990s after the disbandment of the<space/><link><target>Comecon</target></link><space/>system and the loss of the<space/><link><target>Soviet Union</target><part>Soviet</part></link><space/>and Comecon market, to which the country had been entirely tied. Also, as a result of political unrest with the first attempts to re-establish a democratic political system and free market economy (Bulgaria was a democratic monarchy with free market economy prior to the Socialist era) the<space/><link><target>standard of living</target></link><space/>fell by about 40%, and only started to stabilize significantly after 1998 after the fall of<space/><link><target>Jean Videnov</target></link>'s socialist government. It regained pre-1989 levels by June 2004.</paragraph><paragraph>First signs of recovery showed 1994 when<space/><link><target>Gross domestic product</target><part>GDP</part></link><space/>grew by 1.4%. This progress continued with 2.5% rise in 1995. Inflation, which surged to 122% in 1994, fell to normal rates of 32.9% in 1995. During 1996, however, the economy collapsed during Jean Videnov's government. That was due to the<space/><link><target>Bulgarian Socialist Party</target></link>'s inability to introduce vital economic reforms and failure to set legislative standards for banking and financial institutions, thus forcing an unstable banking system. All this led to an inflation rate of 311%, and the collapse of the<space/><link><target>Bulgarian lev</target><part>lev</part></link>. In the spring 1997, the pro-reform<space/><link><target>United Democratic Forces</target></link><space/>coalition came to power with its ambitious economic reform package. The reforms included introduction of a currency board regime, which was agreed to with the<space/><link><target>International Monetary Fund</target></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>World Bank</target></link>, allowed the economy to stabilize. The 2000s saw a steady pace of growth and budget surpluses, but shaky inflation.</paragraph><paragraph>Successful foreign direct investment and successive governments have demonstrated a commitment to economic reforms and responsible fiscal planning that have contributed greatly to the Bulgarian economy, with a historical growth rate average of 6% a year. Corruption in the public administration and a weak judiciary have continued to be long-term problems, with presence of organized crime remaining very high.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">March 2011</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Although politicians were giving warranties that the<space/><link><target>late-2000s recession</target></link><space/>would not hit Bulgaria, the economy suffered a 5.5% GDP decline in that period. Unemployment rose for at least five quarters bringing Bulgaria's worst recession since the early 1980s. Still, economic circumbstaces were not too severe when compared to the rest of<space/><link><target>Europe</target></link>. Future prospects are tied to the country's increasingly important integration with the European Union member states.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Reforms of the 1990s and early 2000s</heading><paragraph>Members of the government promised to move forward on cash and mass<space/><link><target>privatization</target></link><space/>upon taking office in January 1995 but were slow to act. United Nations sanctions against<space/><link><target>Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</target><part>Yugoslavia</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Iraq sanctions</target><part>Iraq</part></link><space/>(19902003), two of the country's most significant trading partners, took a heavy toll on the Bulgarian economy. The first signs of recovery emerged in 1994 when the GDP grew and inflation fell. The first round of mass privatisation finally began in January 1996, and auctions began toward the end of that year. The second and third rounds were conducted in Spring 1997 under a new government. In July 1998, the UDF-led government and the IMF reached an agreement on a 3-year loan worth about $800 million, which replaced the 14-month stand-by agreement that expired in June 1998. The loan was used to develop financial markets, improve<space/><link><target>social safety net</target></link><space/>programmes, strengthen the tax system, reform agricultural and energy sectors, and further liberalise trade. The<space/><link><target>European Commission</target></link>, in its 2002 country report, recognised Bulgaria as a functioning market economy, acknowledging the progress made by Prime Minister<space/><link><target>Ivan Kostov</target></link>'s government toward market-oriented reforms.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Rebound from the February 1997 crisis</heading><paragraph>In April 1997, the<space/><link><target>Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)</target><part>Union of Democratic Forces</part></link><space/>(SDS) won pre-term parliamentary<space/><link><target>Bulgarian parliamentary election, 1997</target><part>elections</part></link><space/>and introduced an IMF currency board system which succeeded in stabilizing the economy.

Because Bulgarian industry was configured to Soviet markets, the end of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact caused a severe crisis in the 1990s. After showing its first growth since the communist era in 2000, Bulgarias industrial sector has grown slowly but steadily in the early 2000s. The performance of individual manufacturing industries has been uneven, however. Food processing and tobacco processing suffered from the loss of Soviet markets and have not maintained standards high enough to compete in Western Europe. Textile processing generally has declined since the mid-1990s, although clothing exports have grown steadily since 2000.<extension extension_name='ref' name="cp10"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Oil refining survived the shocks of the 1990s because of a continuing export market and the purchase of the Burgas refinery by the Russian oil giant LUKoil. The chemical industry has remained in good overall condition but is subject to fluctuating natural gas prices. Growth in ferrous metallurgy, which is dominated by the Kremikovtsi Metals Combine, has been delayed by a complex privatization process and by obsolete capital equipment. Non-ferrous metallurgy has prospered because the Pirdop copper smelting plant was bought by Union Minire of Belgium and because export markets have been favourable.<extension extension_name='ref' name="cp10"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The end of the Warsaw Pact alliance and the loss of Third World markets were grave blows to the defence industry. In the early 2000s, the industrys plan for survival has included upgrading products to satisfy Western markets and doing cooperative manufacturing with Russian companies. The electronics industry, which also was configured in the 1980s to serve Soviet markets, has not been able to compete with Western computer manufacturers. The industry now relies on contract agreements with European firms and attracting foreign investment. The automotive industry has ceased the manufacture of cars, trucks, and buses. Manufacture of forklifts, a speciality in the communist era, also has stopped. In the early 2000s, shipbuilding has prospered at the major Varna and Ruse yards because of foreign ownership (Ruse) and privatization (Varna).<extension extension_name='ref'>Bulgaria country profile, p. 1011.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Only in recent years electronics and electric equipment production has regained higher levels.

The Bulgarian banking system, which was weak in the first post-communist years, was fully reformed in the late 1990s, including stronger oversight from the National Bank of Bulgaria and gradual privatisation. In 2003 the banking system was fully privatised, and substantial consolidation began making the system more efficient in 2004. Several smaller banks grew substantially between 2004 and 2006. These processes increased public confidence in the banks. Although the system still requires consolidation, loan activity to individuals and businesses increased in the early 2000s. The insurance industry has grown rapidly since a market reform in 1997, with the help of foreign firms. An example is the Bulgarian Insurance Group (BIG), a pension-fund and insurance management company owned by the Dutch-Israeli TBI Holding Company and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The introduction of health and pension insurance plans has expanded the private insurance industry. A series of reform laws in the early 2000s enabled the Bulgarian Stock Exchange to begin regular operation. As of 2005, stock market activity was limited by lack of transparency, although the growth rate increased beginning in 2004.<extension extension_name='ref'>Bulgaria country profile, p. 1112.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>After a decline in the 1990s, in the early 2000s the tourism industry has grown rapidly. In 2004 some 4 million foreigners visited Bulgaria, compared with 2.3 million in 2000. This trend is based on a number of attractive destinations, low costs, and restoration of facilities. Most of the industry had been privatised by 2004. Infrastructure items such as recreation facilities and booking services require improvement. Development of Bulgarias retail sales sector was slow until the early 2000s, when a large number of Western-style outlets began to appear, and Sofia developed as a retail center. By 2006 several major European retail chains had opened stores, and others planned to enter the Bulgarian market.<extension extension_name='ref' name="cp12">Bulgaria country profile, p. 12.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Bulgaria has attracted considerable investment from foreigners buying property either for their own use or for investment.

In the postcommunist era, the process of restoring agricultural land to private owners in a form that ensures productivity has been slow. Bank investment and insecurity in the land market contributed to slow development in the 1990s. By 2004 some 98 percent of the workforce and output of Bulgarias agricultural sector was private, including a number of large private cooperative enterprises. A significant amount of food also is produced for direct consumption by non-farmers on small plots, which are an important support for parts of the population. In 2000 and 2003, droughts limited agricultural production, and floods had the same effect in 2005. Bulgarias main field crops are wheat, corn, and barley. The main industrial crops are sugar beets, sunflowers, and tobacco. Tomatoes, cucumbers, and peppers are the most important vegetable exports. Production of apples and grapes, Bulgarias largest fruit products, has decreased since the communist era, but the export of wine has increased significantly. The most important types of livestock are cattle, sheep, poultry, pigs, and buffaloes, and the main dairy products are yogurt, cow and sheep cheese.<extension extension_name='ref' name="cp9">Bulgaria country profile, p. 9.</extension><space/>Bulgaria is the world's 13th largest<space/><link><target>sheep milk</target></link><space/>producer<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.fao.org/es/ess/top/topproduction.html?lang</arg><arg name="title">ESS Website ESS : Statistics home</arg><arg name="publisher"></arg><arg name="accessdate">3 March 2015</arg></template></extension><space/>and is the 15th largest producer of<space/><link><target>tobacco</target></link><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.fao.org/es/ess/top/topproduction.html;jsessionid</arg><arg name="title">FAO – Tobacco production country rank<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Fao.org<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">26 August 2010</arg></template></extension><space/>and 13th largest producer of<space/><link><target>raspberry</target><part>raspberries</part></link><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.fao.org/es/ess/top/topproduction.html;jsessionid</arg><arg name="title">FAO – Raspberry production country rank<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Fao.org<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">26 August 2010</arg></template></extension><space/>in Europe.

Between 1980 and 2000, the forested area increased by 4.6 percent. In 2002 a total of 4,800 tons of timber was harvested, 44 percent of which was fuel wood and 20 percent, pulpwood. Although nominal state timber standards are very strict, in 2004 an estimated 45 percent of Bulgarias timber harvest was logged illegally because of corruption in the forest service. Some 7.5 percent of forests are protected from all uses, and 65 percent are designated for ecological and commercial use. In 2005 about 70 percent of the total forest resource was rated economically viable.<extension extension_name='ref' name="cp9"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Since Bulgaria stopped high-seas fishing in 1995, the country has imported increasing amounts of fish. The fish farming industry (particularly sturgeon) has expanded in the early 2000s, and some environmental improvements in the Black Sea and the Danube River, the principal sources of fish, may increase the take in future years. However, the catch from those sources has decreased sharply in recent decades, yielding only a few species of fish for domestic markets in 2004. Between 1999 and 2001, Bulgarias total fish harvest, wild and cultivated, dropped from 18,600 tons to 8,100 tons, but in 2003 the harvest had recovered to 16,500 tons.<extension extension_name='ref' name="cp10">Bulgaria country profile, p. 10.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Production of the most important crops (according to the<space/><link><target>Food and Agriculture Organization</target></link>) in 2006 (in '000 tons) amounted to:<space/><link><target>wheat</target></link><space/>3301.9;<space/><link><target>sunflower</target></link><space/>1196.6;<space/><link><target>maize</target></link><space/>1587.8;<space/><link><target>grapes</target></link><space/>266.2;<space/><link><target>tobacco</target></link><space/>42.0;<space/><link><target>tomato</target><trail>es</trail></link><space/>213.0;<space/><link><target>barley</target></link><space/>546.3;<space/><link><target>potato</target><trail>es</trail></link><space/>386.1;<space/><link><target>Capsicum</target><part>peppers</part></link><space/>156.7;<space/><link><target>cucumber</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>61.5;<space/><link><target>Cherry</target><part>cherries</part></link><space/>18.2;<space/><link><target>watermelon</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>136.0;<space/><link><target>cabbage</target></link><space/>72.7;<space/><link><target>apple</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>26.1;<space/><link><target>plum</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>18.0;<space/><link><target>Strawberry</target><part>strawberries</part></link><space/>8.8.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Mining and minerals</heading><paragraph>Bulgarias mining industry has declined in the post-communist era. Many deposits have remained underdeveloped because of a lack of modern equipment and low funding. Mining has contributed less than 2 percent of GDP and engaged less than 3 percent of the workforce in the early 2000s. Bulgaria has the following estimated deposits of metallic minerals: 207 million tons of iron ore, 127 million tons of manganese ore, 936 million tons of copper ore, 238 million tons of chromium ore, and 150 million tons of gold ore. Several of Bulgarias minerals are extracted commercially; 80 percent of mining is done by open-pit excavation. Iron extraction at Kremikovtsi and elsewhere is not sufficient to support the domestic steel industry, but copper, lead, and zinc deposits fully supply the nonferrous metallurgy industries. A British firm has exploratory gold mines at Dikanyite and Gornoseltsi, and a domestic copper and gold mine operates at Chelopech. About 50 nonmetallic minerals are present in significant amounts. Substantial amounts of uranium are present in the Rhodope Mountains, but no extraction has occurred in the last 10 years.<extension extension_name='ref' name="cp10"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Despite the poor performance of the mining sector, productivity has increased in recent years.

in 2004, 11 percent worked in agriculture, 33 percent in industry, and 56 percent in services. The unemployment rate has been in double digits throughout the post-communist era, reaching a high point of 19 percent in 2000. Since then, the rate has decreased substantially with the creation of new jobs in private and state enterprises. In 2005 the official figure was 11.5 percent, compared with 16.9 percent at the end of 2002. However, in 2003 an estimated 500,000 Bulgarians were unemployed but not officially counted because they were not seeking work. In January 2005, the government raised the minimum wage by 25 percent, to US$90 per month. The largest labour unions are Podkrepa (Support) and the Confederation of Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria. They represent labour in the National Council for Tripartite Partnership, in which they join government and business representatives to discuss issues of labour, social security, and living standards. The unions were an important political force in the fall of the Zhivkov regime.<extension extension_name='ref' name="cp12"></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Currency and inflation</heading><paragraph><template><target>see also</target><arg>Bulgaria and the euro</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Bulgarias unit of currency is the<space/><link><target>Bulgarian lev</target><part>lev</part></link><space/>(pl., leva).

The state debt peaked in 1994, when it reached US$14.4 billion. During 1998-2008 Bulgaria maintained policy of<space/><link><target>Government budget balance</target><part>budget surpluses</part></link>, which reduced the state debt to 5.07 billion euro. Combined with the economic growth in that period, the state debt dropped to a record low of 13.7% of GDP, one of the lowest in the European Union. In 2008 Bulgaria also maintained 4.286 billion euro fiscal reserve, meaning that net state debt at this moment was only 0.784 billion euro.

In 1999 Bulgaria joined the Central European Free-Trade Agreement (CEFTA), with whose members (Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia; Macedonia was added in 2006) it has established important trade relations. The admission of all but Croatia and Romania to the EU in 2004 reduced the significance of CEFTA trade, however. In 2004 some 54 percent of Bulgarias import trade and 58 percent of its export trade was with EU member countries. Bulgaria has bilateral free-trade agreements with Albania, Croatia, Estonia, Israel, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, and Turkey.<extension extension_name='ref' name="cp12"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>In the early 2000s, hydrocarbon fuels remained an important import, although beginning in the late 1990s those commodities share of total imports decreased significantly, from 29 percent in 1996 to 13 percent in 2004. During that period, the diversification of imported productsimproved as the volume of machinery and equipment, consumer products, and automobiles increased. A large percentage of imports is accounted for by raw materials such as cloth, metal ore, and petroleum, which are processed and re-exported. The most important imports in 2005 were machinery and equipment, metals and ores, chemicals and plastics, fuels, and minerals. The major sources of imports, in order of volume, were Germany, Russia, Italy, Turkey, and Greece. In 2005 Bulgarias largest export markets, in order of volume, were Italy, Germany, Turkey,Greece, and Belgium. The most important export commodities were clothing, footwear, iron and steel, machinery and equipment, and fuels. In 2005 Bulgarias exports totaled US$11.7 billion and its imports totaled US$15.9 billion, incurring a trade deficit of US$4.2 billion. The trade deficit is especially severe with Russia, where markets for Bulgarian goods have shrunk drastically in the early 2000s.<extension extension_name='ref'>Bulgaria country profile, p. 12-13.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>In the first half of 2006, Bulgaria had a current account deficit of US$2.3 billion, a substantial increase over the deficit for the same period of 2005, which was some US$1.4 billion. Its trade deficit was US$2.78 billion, foreign direct investment totaled US$1.8 billion, and the financial account balance was US$2.29 billion. In mid-2006 the overall balance of payments was US$883 million, compared with US$755 million for the same period of 2005.<extension extension_name='ref' name="cp13">Bulgaria country profile, p. 13.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Bulgarias large foreign debt has been an economic burden throughout the postcommunist era. At the end of 2005, Bulgaria reported an external debt of US$15.2 billion, an increase in value but a decrease as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) compared with 2002 and previous years. As a percentage of GDP, the external debt remained constant between 2004 and 2005.<extension extension_name='ref' name="cp13"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Beginning in the late 1990s, investment from the West and from Russia has contributed significantly to recovery from the economic crisis of 199697, but the rate of investment has remained lower than that in other countries of Eastern Europe. In 2003 the largest national sources of foreign direct investment, in order of volume, were Austria, Greece, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. In 1997 the Belgian Solve company bought the Deny Soda Combine, and in 1999 LUKoil of Russia bought the Neftochim Oil Refinery at Burgas. Union Minire, a Belgian mining company, bought the large Pirdop copper-smelting plant, giving an important boost to Bulgarian nonferrous metallurgy. A number of foreign companies have invested in the chemical fertilizer and food-processing industries In the early 2000s, China invested in the Bulgarian electronics industry. Some cooperative agreements have been made for manufacture of vehicle components. Daimler-Chrysler of Germany has a contract to update Bulgarias military transport vehicles between 2003 and 2015. The French Eurocopter company has a bilateral protocol involving a variety of machinery, computer software, and other industrial products. In 2004 Bulgarian oil reserves attracted interest from Melrose Resources of Edinburgh. Russias natural gas giant, Gazprom, has pledged investment in Bulgarias natural gas infrastructure in exchange for increased purchase of its product. A three-company Israeli consortium agreed in 2004 to work with the domestic Overgas company (which is half-owned by Gazprom) on a major natural-gas distribution network in Bulgaria. In 2005 three European consortia submitted bids for construction of the Belene nuclear power plant. One such investor is the Italian ENEL energy consortium, which also owns the MaritsaIztok3 thermal power plant. In 2006 Russias Gazprom company bid against several European energy companies for ownership of newly privatized regional heating utilities, and the Austrian Petromaxx Energy Group invested US$120 million in a new oil refinery at Silistra.<extension extension_name='ref' name="cp13"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>In December 1996, Bulgaria joined the<space/><link><target>World Trade Organization</target></link>. In the early 1990s Bulgaria's slow pace of privatization, contradictory government tax and investment policies, and bureaucratic red tape kept foreign investment among the lowest in the region. Total direct foreign investment from 1991 through 1996 was $831 million. In the years since 1997, however, Bulgaria has begun to attract substantial foreign investment. In 2004 alone over 2.72 billion Euro (3.47 billion US dollars) were invested by foreign companies. In 2005 economists observed a slowdown to about 1.8 billion euros (2.3 billion US dollars) in<space/><link><target>Foreign direct investment</target><part>FDI</part></link><space/>which is attributed mainly to the end of the privatization of the major state owned companies.
