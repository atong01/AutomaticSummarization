'''Europa Island''' ({{Lang-fr|Île Europa}}) is a 28&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> low-lying tropical [[atoll]] in the [[Mozambique Channel]], about a third of the way from southern [[Madagascar]] to southern [[Mozambique]]. The island had never been inhabited until 1820, when the French family ''Rosier'' moved to it. The island officially became a possession of [[France]] in [[1897]]. The island, garrisoned by a detachment from [[Réunion]], has a [[weather station]] and is visited by scientists.  Though uninhabited, it is part of the "[[Scattered islands in the Indian Ocean|Scattered Islands]]" of the [[French Southern and Antarctic Lands]] administrative region. Europa Island was the setting of a 1968 episode of "[[The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau]]",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=The_Undersea_World_of_Jacques_Cousteau_-_Collection_One#Search_in_the_Deep |title=The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau - Collection One |publisher=DocuWiki |date=2013-11-10 |accessdate=2014-01-07}}</ref> partly focusing on the breeding habits of the [[green sea turtle]].

== Description ==
Europa is 6&nbsp;km in diameter, with a maximum altitude of 6 metres, and has 22.2 kilometres of [[coast]]line. It is surrounded by coral beaches and a fringing reef and encloses a [[mangrove]] [[lagoon]] of around 9&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and open to the sea on one side. There are no ports or harbours but anchorage is possible offshore.  Its [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] (EEZ), contiguous with that of [[Bassas da India]], is 127,300&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.  The [[Airport|airstrip]] is 1,500 metres long.

Climate is affected by the [[Agulhas Current]] with water temperatures usually above 30&nbsp;°C, southeast trade winds during the (austral) winter and occasional cyclones.

===Ecology===
The island is a [[nature reserve]].  Its vegetation consists of dry forest, scrub, [[euphorbia]], the mangrove swamp, and the remains of a [[sisal]] plantation.  It is one of the world's largest nesting sites for [[green sea turtle]]s. It is also home to [[goat]]s introduced by settlers in the late 18th century.

The island has been identified as an [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA) by [[BirdLife International]] because it supports a large and diverse population of breeding [[seabird]]s and other [[waterbird]]s.  It is the only known breeding site outside [[Aldabra]] and Madagascar for [[Malagasy pond heron]]s. Seabirds include the second largest colony in the western Indian Ocean of [[great frigatebird]]s (with up to 1100 pairs), [[Audubon's shearwater]]s (up to 100 pairs, probably of the subspecies ''Puffinus lherminieri bailloni'' previously considered endemic to the Mascarene Islands), [[dimorphic egret]]s and [[Caspian tern]]s.  The island is home to an endemic subspecies of [[white-tailed tropicbird]] (''Phaethon lepturus europae'').  There are three species of landbirds present, one of which is an endemic subspecies of the [[Malagasy white-eye]] (''Zosterops maderaspatanus voeltzkowi'').<ref>BirdLife International. (2012).

== History ==
While the island has probably been sighted by navigators since at least the 16th century, it takes its name from the [[United Kingdom|British]] ship ''Europa'', which visited it in December 1774. Ruins and graves on Europa island attest to several attempts at settlement from the 1860s to the 1920s.  For example, the French ''Rosiers'' family moved to the island in 1860, but subsequently abandoned it.<ref>[http://www.taaf.fr/spip/spip.php?article311 ] {{wayback|url=http://www.taaf.fr/spip/spip.php?article311 |date=20120131100906 }}</ref>
