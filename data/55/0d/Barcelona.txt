'''Barcelona''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ɑr|s|ə|ˈ|l|oʊ|n|ə}}, {{IPA-ca|bəɾsəˈlonə|lang}}, {{IPA-es|barθeˈlona|lang}}) is the capital city of the [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of [[Catalonia]] in [[Spain]] and Spain's second most populated city, with a population of 1.6 million<ref>{{cite web| title=Population of Barcelona | author=INE| publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estadistica| url=http://www.ine.es/jaxi/tabla.do|  date=1 January 2012 |accessdate=3 June 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5dzZdiz9T|archivedate=21 January 2009}}</ref> within its administrative limits. Its [[urban area]] extends beyond the administrative city limits with a population of around 4.7 million people, being the [[Largest urban areas of the European Union|sixth-most populous urban area]] in the [[European Union]] after [[Paris]], [[London]], [[Madrid]], the [[Ruhr|Ruhr area]], and [[Milan]].<ref name="demographia"/> It is the largest metropolis on the [[Mediterranean Sea]], located on the coast between the mouths of the rivers [[Llobregat]] and [[Besòs (river)|Besòs]], and bounded to the west by the [[Serra de Collserola]] mountain range, the tallest peak of which is {{convert|512|m|ft|0}} high.

Founded as a Roman city, in the Middle Ages Barcelona became the capital of the [[Counts of Barcelona|County of Barcelona]]. After merging with the [[Kingdom of Aragon]], Barcelona continued to be an important city in the [[Crown of Aragon]] as an economical and administrative center of this Crown and the capital of the [[Principality of Catalonia]]. Besieged several times during its history, Barcelona has a rich cultural heritage and is today an important cultural center and a major tourist destination. Particularly renowned are the architectural works of [[Antoni Gaudí]] and [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]], which have been designated UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]s. The headquarters of the [[Union for the Mediterranean]] is located in Barcelona. The city is known for hosting the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] as well as world-class [[Barcelona#Trade fair and exhibitions|conferences and expositions]] and also many [[Sport in Barcelona#International tournaments|international sport tournaments]].

Barcelona is one of the world's leading tourist, economic, trade fair and cultural centers, and its influence in commerce, education, entertainment, media, fashion, science, and the arts all contribute to its status as one of the [[global city|world's major global cities]].<ref name="GAWC">{{cite web |url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2010t.html |title=The World According to GaWC 2010 |publisher=Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network, [[Loughborough University]] |accessdate=2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131010004859/http://www.lboro.ac.uk:80/gawc/world2010t.html |archivedate=10 October 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/citylist.html |title=Inventory of World Cities |publisher=Globalization and World Cities (GaWC) Study Group and Network |accessdate=1 December 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131014191556/http://www.lboro.ac.uk:80/gawc/citylist.html |archivedate=14 October 2013 }}</ref> It is a major cultural and economic center in [[Iberian Peninsula|southwestern Europe]], 24th in the world (before [[Zürich]], after [[Frankfurt]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atkearney.com/documents/10192/dfedfc4c-8a62-4162-90e5-2a3f14f0da3a |title=2012 Global Cities Index |date= |accessdate=30 March 2014|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131020223227/http://www.atkearney.com/documents/10192/dfedfc4c-8a62-4162-90e5-2a3f14f0da3a|archivedate=20 October 2013}}</ref> and a financial center.

Sources suggest that the city may have been named after the Carthaginian general [[Hamilcar Barca]], who was supposed to have founded the city in the 3rd century BC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Barcelona |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=14 June 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140409161819/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Barcelona |archivedate=9 April 2014 }}</ref>

During [[Middle Ages|the Middle Ages]], the city was variously known as ''Barchinona'', ''Barçalona'', ''Barchelonaa'', and ''Barchenona''.

Internationally, Barcelona's name is usually abbreviated as 'Barsa' or 'Barça'. Locally, this name refers only to [[FC Barcelona]], the football club. Locals refer to the city instead as 'Barna'.

Another common abbreviation is 'BCN', which is also the [[IATA airport code]] of the [[Barcelona-El Prat Airport]].

The city is also referred to as the ''Ciutat Comtal'' in Catalan, and ''Ciudad Condal'' in Spanish, owing to its past as the seat of the [[Count of Barcelona]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Barcelona|Timeline of Barcelona}}
[[File:Barcino marble barcelona.jpg|thumbnail|A marble plaque in the Museu d'Història de la Ciutat de Barcelona, dated from around 110-130 AD and dedicated to the Roman colony of Barcino]]

The origin of the earliest settlement at the site of present-day Barcelona is unclear. Around the actual neighborhood of Raval have been found remains of an early settlement, including different tombs and a hut from 5.500 BC.
The founding of Barcelona is the subject of two different legends. The first attributes the founding of the city to the mythological [[Hercules]]. The second legend attributes the foundation of the city directly to the historical [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] [[Hamilcar Barca]], father of [[Hannibal]], who named the city ''Barcino'' after his family in the Third century BC.<ref>Oros. vii. 143; Miñano, ''Diccion.'' vol.&nbsp;i. p.&nbsp;391; Auson. ''Epist.'' xxiv. 68, 69, ''Punica Barcino''.</ref>

In about [[15 BC|15&nbsp;BC]], the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] redrew the town as a ''[[castra|castrum]]'' (Roman military camp) centerd on the "''Mons Taber''", a little hill near the contemporary city hall ([[Plaça de Sant Jaume]]). Under the Romans, it was a colony with the surname of ''Faventia'',<ref>[[Pliny the Elder|Plin.]] iii. 3. s.&nbsp;4</ref> or, in full, ''Colonia Faventia Julia Augusta Pia Barcino''<ref>Inscr. ap. Gruter, p. 426, nos. 5, 6.</ref> or ''Colonia Julia Augusta Faventia Paterna Barcino''. [[Pomponius Mela]]<ref>ii. 6</ref> mentions it among the small towns of the district, probably as it was eclipsed by its neighbour ''[[Tarragona|Tarraco]]'' (modern [[Tarragona]]), but it may be gathered from later writers that it gradually grew in wealth and consequence, favoured as it was with a beautiful situation and an excellent harbour.<ref>Avien. ''Ora Maritima.'' 520: "Et Barcilonum amoena sedes ditium."</ref> It enjoyed immunity from imperial burdens.<ref>Paul. Dig. 1. tit. 15, de Cens.</ref> The city minted its own coins; some from the era of [[Galba]] survive.

Important Roman vestiges are displayed in [[Plaça del Rei]] underground, as a part of the [[Barcelona City History Museum]] MUHBA; the typically Roman grid plan is still visible today in the layout of the historical center, the ''[[El Gòtic|Barri Gòtic]]'' (Gothic Quarter). Some remaining fragments of the Roman walls have been incorporated into the cathedral.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/spain/barcelona/walls/walls.html |title=Roman walls, Barcelona |publisher=Bluffton.edu |accessdate=5 May 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130723083724/http://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/spain/barcelona/walls/walls.html |archivedate=23 July 2013 }}</ref> The cathedral, also known as the Basilica ''La Seu'', is said to have been founded in 343. The city was conquered by the [[Visigoths]] in the early 5th century, becoming for a few years the capital of all [[Hispania]]. After being conquered by the [[Arabs]] in the early 8th century, it was conquered in 801 by [[Charlemagne]]'s son [[Louis the Pious|Louis]], who made Barcelona the seat of the Carolingian "[[Marca Hispanica|Hispanic March]]" (''Marca Hispanica''), a [[buffer zone]] ruled by the [[Counts of Barcelona|Count of Barcelona]].

The Counts of Barcelona became increasingly independent and expanded their territory to include all of [[Catalonia]], although on 6 July 985, Barcelona was [[Looting|sacked]] by the army of [[Almanzor]].<ref>'''The Usatges of Barcelona: The Fundamental Law of Catalonia''', ed.

His territories were later to be known as the [[Crown of Aragon]], which conquered many overseas possessions and ruled the western [[Mediterranean Sea]] with outlying territories [[Naples|in Naples]] and Sicily and as far as [[Duchy of Athens|Athens]] in the 13th century. The forging of a dynastic link between the Crowns of Aragon and [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] marked the beginning of Barcelona's decline. The Bank of Barcelona, probably the oldest public bank in Europe, was established by the city [[magistrate]]s in 1401. It originated from necessities of the state, as did the [[Medici Bank#Rise|Bank of Venice]] (1402) and the [[Bank of Saint George|Bank of Genoa]] (1407).<ref>The Bankers magazine, volume 11, page 595, J. Smith Homans Jr., New York 1857.</ref>

The marriage of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]] in 1469 united the two royal lines. [[Madrid]] became the center of political power whilst the colonisation of the Americas reduced the financial importance (at least in relative terms) of Mediterranean trade. Barcelona was a center of [[Catalan separatism]], including the [[Catalan Revolt]] (1640–52) against [[Philip IV of Spain]]. The [[plague (disease)|great plague]] of 1650–1654 halved the city's population.<ref>[http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/payne15.htm Chapter 15: A History of Spain and Portugal], Stanley G.

[[File:Castell de Montjuic - Fossat entrada - Barcelona (Catalonia).jpg|thumb|The [[Castle of Montjuïc|fortress at Montjuïc]], most southerly point from which measurements were made when calculating the [[meridional definition]] of the metre]]
In the 18th century, a fortress was built at [[Montjuïc]] that overlooked the harbour. In 1794, this fortress was used by the French astronomer [[Pierre Méchain|Pierre François André Méchain]] for observations relating to a survey stretching to [[Dunkirk]] that provided the official basis of the measurement of a metre.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Adler |first1=Ken|title=The measure of all things – The seven year odyssey that transformed the world|year=2002|publisher=Abacus|isbn=978-0-349-11507-8}}</ref> The definitive metre bar, manufactured from platinum, was presented to the French legislative assembly on 22 June 1799. Much of Barcelona was negatively affected by the [[Peninsular War|Napoleonic wars]], but the start of industrialization saw the fortunes of the province improve.

During the [[Spanish Civil War]], the city, and Catalonia in general, were resolutely Republican. Many enterprises and public services were "collectivised" by the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] and UGT unions. As the power of the Republican government and the Generalitat diminished, much of the city was under the effective control of [[anarchist]] groups. The anarchists lost control of the city to their own allies, the Communists and official government troops, after the street fighting of the Barcelona May Days. The fall of the city on 26 January 1939, caused a mass exodus of civilians who fled to the French border. The resistance of Barcelona to [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s [[coup d'état]] was to have lasting effects after the defeat of the Republican government. The autonomous institutions of [[Catalonia]] were abolished,<ref>Decree of 5 April 1938.</ref> and the use of the [[Catalan language]] in public life was suppressed. Barcelona remained the second largest city in Spain, at the heart of a region which was relatively industrialised and prosperous, despite the devastation of the [[Spanish Civil War|civil war]]. The result was a large-scale [[immigration]] from poorer regions of Spain (particularly [[Andalusia]], [[Murcia]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]), which in turn led to rapid urbanisation. The city gained vitality in 1992 when it hosted the Olympic games.<ref>"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/53030/Barcelona Barcelona (Spain)]".

[[File:Barcelona ISS009-E-9987.jpg|thumb|right|Barcelona from high altitude]]

Barcelona is located on the northeast coast of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], facing the [[Mediterranean Sea]], on a [[plain]] approximately {{convert|5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} wide limited by the mountain range of [[Serra de Collserola|Collserola]], the [[Llobregat]] river to the southwest and the [[Besòs (river)|Besòs]] river to the north.<ref name="gec_3">{{cite encyclopaedia |encyclopedia=Gran Enciclopèdia Catalana |title=Barcelona |date=July 1971 |publisher=Edicions 62 |volume=3 |location=Barcelona |pages=193–229}}</ref> This plain covers an area of {{convert|170|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}},<ref name="gec_3"/> of which {{convert|101|km²|1|abbr=on}}<ref name="guies_estadistiques">{{cite web|url=http://www.bcn.es/estadistica/catala/dades/inf/guies/bcn.pdf |title=11 Barcelona.indd |format=PDF |accessdate=26 June 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120220062823/http://www.bcn.es/estadistica/catala/dades/inf/guies/bcn.pdf |archivedate=20 February 2011 }}</ref> are occupied by the city itself. It is {{convert|120|km|0|abbr=off}} south of the [[Pyrenees]] and the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] border with France.

Barcelona is peppered with small hills, most of them urbanised, that gave their name to the neighbourhoods built upon them, such as [[El Carmel|Carmel]] (267&nbsp;m), [[Putget]] (181&nbsp;m) and Rovira (261&nbsp;m). The escarpment of [[Montjuïc]] (173&nbsp;m), situated to the southeast, overlooks the harbour and is topped by Montjuïc castle, a fortress built in the 17–18th centuries to control the city as a replacement for the Ciutadella. Today, the fortress is a museum and Montjuïc is home to several sporting and cultural venues, as well as Barcelona's biggest park and gardens.

The city borders on the municipalities of [[Santa Coloma de Gramenet]] and [[Sant Adrià de Besòs]] to the north; the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the east; [[El Prat de Llobregat]] and [[L'Hospitalet de Llobregat]] to the south; and [[Sant Feliu de Llobregat]], [[Sant Just Desvern]], [[Esplugues de Llobregat]], [[Sant Cugat del Vallès]], and [[Montcada i Reixac]] to the west. The municipality includes two small sparsely-inhabited [[exclave]]s to the north-west.

==Main sights==
[[File:Barcelona Iglesia Sagrada Familia.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sagrada Família]] church, [[Antoni Gaudí|Gaudí]]'s masterpiece]]

The ''[[El Gòtic|Barri Gòtic]]'' (Catalan for "Gothic Quarter") is the center of the old city of Barcelona. Many of the buildings date from medieval times, some from as far back as the Roman settlement of Barcelona. Catalan ''[[Modernisme|modernista]]'' architecture (related to the movement known as [[Art Nouveau]] in the rest of Europe), developed between 1885 and 1950 and left an important legacy in Barcelona. Several of these buildings are [[World Heritage Site]]s. Especially remarkable is the work of architect [[Antoni Gaudí]], which can be seen throughout the city. His best-known work is the immense but still unfinished church of the [[Sagrada Família]], which has been under construction since 1882, and is still financed by private donations. As of 2007, completion is planned for 2026.

Barcelona was also home to [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Mies van der Rohe]]'s [[Barcelona Pavilion]]. Designed in 1929 for the [[1929 Barcelona International Exposition|International Exposition]] for Germany, it is an iconic building that came to symbolize modern architecture as the embodiment of van der Rohe's aphorisms "less is more" and "God is in the details." The Barcelona pavilion was intended as a temporary structure, and was torn down in 1930 less than a year after it was constructed. A modern re-creation by Spanish architects now stands in Barcelona, however, constructed in 1986.

Barcelona won the 1999 [[Royal Institute of British Architects|RIBA]] [[Royal Gold Medal]] for its architecture,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.architecture.com/Files/RIBATrust/Awards/RoyalGoldMedal/Royal%20Gold%20Medallists%201848%20-%202008.pdf | title = RIBA Royal Gold Medallists | publisher = RIBA | accessdate = 28 January 2014| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20140202101307/http://www.architecture.com/Files/RIBATrust/Awards/RoyalGoldMedal/Royal%20Gold%20Medallists%201848%20-%202008.pdf | archivedate = 2 February 2014 }}</ref> the first (and as of 2015, only) time that the winner has been a city, and not an individual architect.

Barcelona is the home of many points of interest declared [[World Heritage Site]]s by [[UNESCO]]:<ref>The seventh element of Place [[World Heritage]] "Works of [[Antoni Gaudí]]" is the Crypt in [[Colònia Güell]], which is located at [[Santa Coloma de Cervelló]].</ref>

In 1900, Barcelona had a population of 533,000 people,<ref name="gec_3"/> which grew steadily but slowly until 1950, when it started absorbing a high number of people from other less-industrialized parts of Spain. Barcelona's population peaked in 1979 with 1,906,998 people, and fell throughout the 1980s and 1990s as more people sought a higher [[quality of life]] in outlying cities in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area. After bottoming out in 2000 with 1,496,266 people, the city's population began to rise again as younger people started to return, causing a great increase in housing prices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcn.es/estadistica/catala/dades/anuari/cap02/C0201010.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071221131641/http://www.bcn.es/estadistica/catala/dades/anuari/cap02/C0201010.htm |archivedate=21 December 2007 |title=Ajuntament de Barcelona: Estadística: Evolució de la població. 1900–2005 |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=26 June 2010}}</ref>

===Population density===
''Note: This text is entirely based on the municipal statistical database provided by the city council.''

Barcelona is one of the most densely populated cities in Europe. For the year 2008 the city council calculated the population to 1,621,090 living in the 102.2&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> sized municipality, giving the city an average population density of 15,926 inhabitants per square kilometre.

In the case of Barcelona though, the land distribution is extremely uneven. Half of the municipality or 50.2&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, all of it located on the municipal edge is made up of the ten least densely populated neighbourhoods containing less than 10% of the city's population, the uninhabited [[Zona Franca (Barcelona)|Zona Franca]] industrial area and [[Montjuïc]] forest park. Leaving the remaining 90% or slightly below 1.5 million inhabitants living on the remaining 52&nbsp;km2 at an average density close to 28,500 inhabitants per square kilometre.

Of the 73 neighbourhoods in the city, 45 had a population density above 20,000 inhabitants per square kilometre with a combined population of 1,313,424 inhabitants living on 38.6&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> at an average density of 33,987 inhabitants per square km. The 30 most densely populated neighbourhoods accounted for 57.5% of the city population occupying only 22,7% of the municipality, or in other words, 936,406 people living at an average density of 40,322 inhabitants per square kilometre. The city's highest density is found at and around the neighbourhood of [[Sagrada Família, Barcelona|la Sagrada Família]] where four of the city's most densely populated neighbourhoods are located side by side, all with a population density above 50,000 inhabitants per square kilometre.

Barcelona has a long-standing mercantile tradition. Less well known is that the region was one of the earliest to begin industrialization in [[continental Europe]], beginning with textile-related works from the mid-1780s but really gathering momentum in the mid-19th century, when it became a major center for the production of textiles and machinery. Since then, manufacturing has played a large role in its history.

Borsa de Barcelona (''Barcelona Stock Exchange'') is the main stock exchange in the northeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula.

An important business center, the [[World Trade Center Barcelona]], is located in Barcelona's [[Port Vell]] harbour.

The city is known for hosting well as world-class conferences and expositions, including the 1888 ''[[Exposición Universal de Barcelona]]'', the [[1929 Barcelona International Exposition]] (Expo 1929), the [[2004 Universal Forum of Cultures]] and the 2004 [[World Urban Forum]].

===Fashion===
[[File:Pasarela The Brandery 2.jpg|thumb|right|The Brandery fashion show]]

The traditional importance of textiles is reflected in Barcelona's drive to become a major fashion center. There have been many attempts to launch Barcelona as a fashion capital, notably ''Gaudi Home''.{{citation needed|reason=who or what is Gaudi Home; need cite for it and more info|date=January 2014}}

Beginning in the summer of 2000, the city hosted the prestigious [[Bread and Butter tradeshow|Bread & Butter urban fashion fair]] until 2009, when its organisers announced that it would be returning to [[Berlin]].

The seat of the city council is on the Plaça de Sant Jaume, opposite the seat of Generalitat de Catalunya. Since the [[Spanish transition to democracy|coming of the Spanish democracy]], Barcelona [[Municipal elections in Barcelona|had been governed]] by the [[Socialists' Party of Catalonia|PSC]], first with an [[absolute majority]] and later in coalition with [[Republican Left of Catalonia|ERC]] and [[Initiative for Catalonia Greens|ICV]]. After the May 2007 election, the ERC did not renew the coalition agreement and the PSC governed in a minority coalition with ICV as the junior partner.

After 32 years, on 22 May 2011, [[Convergence and Union|CiU]] gained a plurality of seats at the municipal election, gaining 15 seats to the PSC's 11. The [[People's Party (Spain)|PP]] hold 8 seats, ICV 5 and ERC 2.

===Districts===
[[File:Districtes de Barcelona.svg|right|thumb|Districts of Barcelona]]
{{main|Districts of Barcelona}}

Since 1987, the city has been divided into 10&nbsp;administrative [[Districts of Barcelona|districts]] (''districtes'' in Catalan, ''distritos'' in Spanish):
* [[Ciutat Vella]]
* [[Eixample]]
* [[Sants-Montjuïc]]
* [[District of Les Corts|Les Corts]]
* [[Sarrià-Sant Gervasi]]
* [[Gràcia]]
* [[Horta-Guinardó]]
* [[Nou Barris]]
* [[Sant Andreu]]
* [[Sant Martí (district)|Sant Martí]]

The districts are based mostly on historical divisions, and several are former towns annexed by the city of Barcelona in the 18th and 19th centuries that still maintain their own distinct character. Each district has its own council led by a city councillor. The composition of each district council depends on the number of votes each political party had in that district, so a district can be led by a councillor from a different party than the executive council.

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Spain}}
[[File:Paranimf de la Universitat de Barcelona.jpg|thumb|Main hall of the [[University of Barcelona]]]]

Barcelona has a well-developed higher education system of [[public university|public universities]]. Most prominent among these is the [[University of Barcelona]] (established in 1450), a world-renowned research and teaching institution with campuses around the city. Barcelona is also home to the [[Polytechnic University of Catalonia]], and the newer [[Pompeu Fabra University]], and, in the private sector the [[EADA Business School]] founded in 1957, became the first Barcelona institution to run manager training programmes for the business community.

The [[Open University of Catalonia]], a private Internet-centered [[open university]], is also based in Barcelona.

[[File:Vestíbul Universitat de Barcelona.jpg|thumb|right|Historic building of the [[University of Barcelona]], entrance vestibule]]

The city has a network of public schools, from nurseries to high schools, under the responsibility of a consortium led by city council (though the curriculum is the responsibility of the Generalitat de Catalunya). There are also many private schools, some of them Roman Catholic. Most such schools receive a public subsidy on a per-student basis, are subject to inspection by the public authorities, and are required to follow the same curricular guidelines as public schools, though they charge tuition. Known as ''escoles concertades'', they are distinct from schools whose funding is entirely private (''escoles privades'').

The language of instruction at public schools and ''escoles concertades'' is Catalan, as stipulated by the 2009 Catalan Education Act (in court for discrimination). Spanish may be used as a language of instruction by teachers of Spanish literature or language, and foreign languages by teachers of those languages. An experimental partial immersion programme adopted by some schools allows for the teaching of a foreign language (English, generally) across the curriculum, though this is limited to a maximum of 30% of the school day. No public school or ''escola concertada'' in Barcelona may offer 50% or full immersion programmes in a foreign language, nor does any public school or ''escola concertada'' offer International Baccalaureate programmes.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Barcelona}}
[[File:Palau de la Música - Interior general (2).JPG|thumb|[[Palau de la Música Catalana]]]]

Barcelona's cultural roots go back 2000 years.

Barcelona is designated as a [[global city|world-class city]] by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/citylist.html |title=Globalization and World Cities Study Group & Network – Inventory of World Cities |accessdate=7 July 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070630222000/http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/citylist.html| archivedate= 30 June 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Transport==
{{Main|Transport in Barcelona}}

===Airports===
Barcelona is served by [[Barcelona-El Prat Airport]], about {{convert|17|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the center of Barcelona. It is the second-largest airport in Spain, and the largest on the [[Mediterranean]] coast, which handles above 37.5 million passengers per year, showing an annual upward trend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite/Aeropuerto-Barcelona/es/Page/1045569607435/Presentacion.html |title=AENA Aeropuerto de Barcelona El Prat 2014 |publisher=Aena.es |date= |accessdate=2015-10-08}}</ref> It is a main hub for [[Vueling Airlines]] and [[Ryanair]], and also a focus for [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]] and [[Air Europa]]. The airport mainly serves domestic and European destinations, although some airlines offer destinations in Latin America, Asia and the United States. The airport is connected to the city by highway, commuter train ([[Aeroport railway station (el Prat)|Barcelona Airport railway station]]) and scheduled bus service. A new terminal (T1) has been built, and entered service on 17 June 2009.

Some low-cost airlines, such as [[Transavia.com]] and [[Ryanair]], also use [[Girona-Costa Brava Airport]], about {{convert|90|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} to the north, [[Reus Airport]], {{convert|77|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} to the south, or [[Lleida-Alguaire Airport]], about {{convert|150|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} to the west, of the city. [[Sabadell Airport]] is a smaller airport in the nearby town of [[Sabadell]], devoted to [[Flight training|pilot training]], aerotaxi and private flights.

===Seaport===
[[File:BarcelonaHarbour.jpg|thumb|[[Port of Barcelona]]]]

The [[Port of Barcelona]] has a 2000-year-old history and a great contemporary commercial importance. It is Europe's ninth largest [[containerization|container]] port, with a trade volume of 1.72 million TEU's in 2013.<ref name="traffic statistics 2013">[http://content.portdebarcelona.cat/cntmng/d/d/workspace/SpacesStore/1c206b0a-4787-49d8-9c8c-0563aa71719f/PortBcnTrafic2013_12_en.pdf Port of Barcelona traffic statistics 2013] - Port de Barcelona, 2014</ref> The port is managed by the Port Authority of Barcelona. Its {{convert|10|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} are divided into three zones: [[Port Vell]] (the old port), the commercial port and the logistics port ([[Barcelona Free Port]]).

The Port Vell area also houses the Maremagnum (a commercial mall), a multiplex cinema, the [[IMAX]] Port Vell and one of Europe's largest [[aquarium]]s – [[Aquarium Barcelona]], containing 8,000 fish and 11 sharks contained in 22 basins filled with 4 million litres of sea water. The Maremagnum, being situated within the confines of the port, is the only commercial mall in the city that can open on Sundays and public holidays.

===Railway===
[[File:Siemens Velaro high speed.jpg|thumb|Siemens Velaro designed for speeds of {{convert|310|km/h|0|abbr=on}} at Barcelona-Sants AVE station.]]

Barcelona is a major hub for [[RENFE]], the Spanish state railway network. The city's main [[Inter-city rail]] [[railway station|station]] is [[Barcelona Sants railway station|Barcelona-Sants]] station, whilst [[Estació de França]] terminus serves a secondary role handling suburban, regional and medium distance services. Freight services operate to local industries and to the Port of Barcelona.

RENFE's [[AVE]] [[high-speed rail]] system, which is designed for speeds of {{convert|310|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, was extended from [[Madrid]] to Barcelona in 2008 in the form of the [[Madrid–Barcelona high-speed rail line]]. A shared RENFE-SNCF high-speed rail connecting Barcelona and France ([[Paris]], [[Marseilles]] and [[Toulouse]], through [[LGV Perpignan–Figueres]]) was launched in 2013. Both these lines serve Barcelona Sants terminal station.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avui.cat/noticia/article/2-societat/5-societat/252283-barcelona-estrena-tgv.html|title=Barcelona estrena TGV|publisher=[[Avui]] |date=9 February 2008 |accessdate=11 July 2011 |language=catalan}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catalannewsagency.com/politics/item/the-last-high-speed-railway-stretch-between-barcelona-and-france-has-finally-been-unveiled-after-years-of-delays|title=The last High Speed railway stretch between Barcelona and France has finally been unveiled after years of delays|publisher=Catalan News Agency|date=8 January 2013|accessdate=27 January 2014|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140410223210/http://www.catalannewsagency.com/politics/item/the-last-high-speed-railway-stretch-between-barcelona-and-france-has-finally-been-unveiled-after-years-of-delays|archivedate=10 April 2014}}</ref>

Besides RENFE's services, other rail services in the Barcelona area are operated by the [[Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya]] (FGC), owned by the Catalonian government. The FGC operates largely [[commuter rail]] services, but also carries freight to the Port of Barcelona, as well as a number of [[rack railway]]s and [[funicular]]s, and three of the lines of the Barcelona Metro (see [[#Local public transport|''local public transport'']] below). Other suburban services are operated by [[Rodalies de Catalunya]] over RENFE tracks.

===Roads and highways===
[[File:BCN-rdaDalt-9976sh.jpg|thumb|upright|[[B-20 motorway (Spain)|B-20 motorway]] in Barcelona.]]

Barcelona lies on three international routes, including [[European route E15]] that follows the Mediterranean coast, [[European route E90]] to Madrid and Lisbon, and [[European route E09]] to Paris. It is also served by a comprehensive network of motorways and highways throughout the metropolitan area, including [[Autovía A-2|A-2]], [[Autovía A-7|A-7]]/[[Autopista AP-7|AP-7]], [[C-16 highway (Spain)|C-16]], [[C-17 highway (Spain)|C-17]], [[C-31 highway (Spain)|C-31]], [[C-32 highway (Spain)|C-32]], [[Autopista C-33|C-33]], [[Autovia C-60|C-60]].

The city is circled by three half [[Beltway|ring roads]] or bypasses, [[B20 motorway (Spain)|Ronda de Dalt (B-20)]] (on the mountain side), [[B10 motorway (Spain)|Ronda del Litoral (B-10)]] (along the coast) and [[Ronda del Mig]] (separated into two parts: [[Travessera de Dalt]] in the north and the [[Gran Via de Carles III]]), two partially covered<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcn.es/turisme/english/turisme/rutes/rondes_fr.htm |title=The covered Rondes (by-pass) |publisher=Bcn.es |accessdate=26 June 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090516235933/http://www.bcn.es:80/turisme/english/turisme/rutes/rondes_fr.htm |archivedate=16 May 2009 }}</ref> fast highways with several exits that bypass the city.

The city's main arteries include [[Avinguda Diagonal, Barcelona|Diagonal Avenue]], which crosses it diagonally, [[Avinguda Meridiana, Barcelona|Meridiana Avenue]] which leads to [[Plaça de les Glòries Catalanes, Barcelona|Glòries]] and connects with Diagonal Avenue and [[Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, Barcelona|Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes]], which crosses the city from east to west, passing through its center. The famous boulevard of [[La Rambla, Barcelona|La Rambla]], whilst no longer an important vehicular route, remains an important pedestrian route.

The [[Estació del Nord Sports Hall|Estació del Nord]] (Northern Station), a former [[railway station]] which was renovated for the 1992 Olympic Games, now serves as the terminus for long-distance and regional bus services.

===Local public transport===
[[File:LlefiàL10.JPG|thumb|right|Barcelona Metro]]

Barcelona is served by a comprehensive local public transport network that includes a [[rapid transit|metro]], a [[bus]] network, two separate modern tram networks, a separate historic tram line, and several funiculars and [[aerial tramway|aerial cable cars]]. Most of these networks and lines form a coordinated fare system, administered by the [[Autoritat del Transport Metropolità]] (ATM), although they are operated by a number of different bodies.

The largely underground [[Barcelona Metro]] network comprises eleven lines, identified by an "L" followed by the line number as well as by individual colours. Eight of these lines are operated on dedicated track by the [[Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona]] (TMB), whilst three lines are operated by the [[Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya]] (FGC) and share tracks with that company's commuter lines.

[[File:Barcelona Tram 01.jpg|thumb|Barcelona Tram]]

Another company, [[TRAMMET]], operates the city's two modern tram networks, known as [[Trambaix]] and [[Trambesòs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://w3.bcn.es/V01/Serveis/Noticies/V01NoticiesLlistatNoticiesCtl/0,2138,1653_35144087_1_573780100,00.html?accio=detall&home=HomeBCN&nomtipusMCM=Noticia |title=News related with the council plans for the tram network union |publisher=W3.bcn.es |accessdate=26 June 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091003195712/http://w3.bcn.es:80/V01/Serveis/Noticies/V01NoticiesLlistatNoticiesCtl/0,2138,1653_35144087_1_573780100,00.html?accio=detall&home=HomeBCN&nomtipusMCM=Noticia |archivedate=3 October 2009 }}</ref> The historic tram line, the [[Tramvia Blau]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmb.net/en_US/barcelona/moute/planols/planotramviablau.jsp |title=Information of Tramvia Blau |publisher=Tmb.net |accessdate=26 June 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091224023817/http://www.tmb.net/en_US/barcelona/moute/planols/planotramviablau.jsp |archivedate=24 December 2009 }}</ref> connects the metro (L7, operated by FGC) to the [[Funicular del Tibidabo]] (operated by TMB). The Funicular de Tibidabo climbs the Tibidabo hill, as does the [[Funicular de Vallvidrera]] (FGC). The [[Funicular de Montjuïc]] (TMB) climbs the [[Montjuïc]] hill. The city has two [[aerial lift|aerial cable cars]]: the [[Montjuïc Cable Car]] (to the Montjuïc castle) and the [[Port Vell Aerial Tramway]] that runs via [[Torre Jaume I]] and [[Torre Sant Sebastia|Torre Sant Sebastià]] over the port.

Buses in Barcelona are a major form of public transport, with extensive local, interurban and night bus networks. Most local services are operated by the TMB, although some other services are operated by a number of private companies, albeit still within the ATM fare structure. A separate private bus line, known as Aerobús, links the airport with the city center, with its own fare structure.

[[File:Prius Taxi Barcelona.jpg|thumb|left|Barcelona taxi]]

Barcelona has a [[taxicab|metered taxi]] fleet governed by the Institut Metropolità del Taxi (Metropolitan Taxi Institute), composed of more than 10,000 cars. Most of the licences are in the hands of [[Self-employment|self-employed]] drivers. With their black and yellow livery, Barcelona's taxis are easily spotted, and can be caught from one of many [[taxi rank]]s, hailed on street, or called by telephone.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.barcelona.com/barcelona_city_guide/all_about/taxis_in_barcelona | title = Barcelona Taxi Information | work = Barcelona.com | accessdate = 28 January 2014| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20140202102147/http://www.barcelona.com/barcelona_city_guide/all_about/taxis_in_barcelona | archivedate = 2 February 2014 }}</ref><ref>[http://bcnweb2.bcn.es:8885/taxi/infocorp/informacio.html L'Administració i la gestió del Taxi de Barcelona] {{dead link|date=May 2014}}</ref>
