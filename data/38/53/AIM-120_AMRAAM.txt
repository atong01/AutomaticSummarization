The '''AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile''', or '''AMRAAM''' (pronounced "am-ram"), is a modern [[Beyond-visual-range missile|beyond-visual-range]] [[air-to-air missile]] (BVRAAM) capable of all-weather day-and-night operations. Designed with 7" diameter instead of 8" diameter [[form-and-fit]] factors, and employing active transmit-receive radar guidance instead of semi-active receive-only radar guidance, it is a [[fire-and-forget]] upgrade to the previous generation [[AIM-7 Sparrow| Sparrow]] missiles. When an AMRAAM missile is being launched, [[NATO]] pilots use the [[Multiservice tactical brevity code|brevity code]] [[Fox (code word)|Fox Three]].<ref name="DTIC2">{{cite journal|date=April 25, 1997 |title=Multi-service Air-Air, Air-Surface, Surface-Air brevity codes |publisher=DTIC |page=14 |url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/service_pubs/lbrevity.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=April 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120209014757/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/service_pubs/lbrevity.pdf |archivedate=9 February 2012 }}</ref>

==Origins==
===AIM-7 Sparrow MRM===
The [[AIM-7 Sparrow]] medium range missile (MRM) was purchased by the US Navy from original developer [[Howard Hughes]]<ref>[[Hughes Aircraft#Howard Hughes Medical Institute sells Hughes Aircraft Company]]</ref> in the 1950s as its first operational air-to-air missile with "[[beyond visual range]]" (BVR) capability. With an effective range of about {{convert|12|mi|km}}, it was introduced as a radar [[beam riding|beam-riding]] missile and then it was improved to a [[semi-active radar homing|semiactive radar guided]] missile which would home in on reflections from a target illuminated by the radar of the launching aircraft. It was effective at visual to beyond visual range. The early beam riding versions of the Sparrow missiles were integrated onto the [[F3H Demon]] and [[F7U Cutlass]], but the definitive AIM-7 Sparrow was the primary weapon for the all-weather [[F-4 Phantom II]] fighter/interceptor, which lacked an internal gun in its [[U.S. Navy]], [[U.S. Marine Corps]], and early [[U.S. Air Force]] versions. The F-4 carried up to four AIM-7s in built-in recesses under its belly.

Although designed for use against non-maneuvering targets such as bombers, because of poor performance against fighters over North Vietnam, these missiles were progressively improved until they proved highly effective in dogfights. Together with the short-range, infrared-guided [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]], they replaced the [[AIM-4 Falcon]] IR and radar guided series for use in air combat by the USAF as well. A disadvantage to semi-active homing was that only one target could be illuminated by the launching [[fighter plane]] at a time. Also, the launching aircraft had to remain pointed in the direction of the target (within the azimuth and elevation of its own radar set) which could be difficult or dangerous in [[air-to-air combat]].

===AIM-54 Phoenix LRM===
The US Navy later developed the [[AIM-54 Phoenix]] long-range missile (LRM) for the fleet air defense mission. It was a large {{convert|1000|lb|kg|-2|abbr=on}}, Mach 5 missile designed to counter [[cruise missile]]s and the bombers that launched them. Originally intended for the straight-wing [[Douglas F6D Missileer]] and then the navalized version of the [[F-111B#F-111B|F-111B]], it finally saw service with the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat]], the only fighter capable of carrying such a heavy missile. Phoenix was the first US [[fire-and-forget]], multiple-launch, radar-guided missile: one which used its own active guidance system to guide itself without help from the launch aircraft when it closed on its target. This, in theory, gave a Tomcat with a six-Phoenix load the unprecedented capability of tracking and destroying up to six targets beyond visual range, as far as {{convert|100|mi|km|-1}} away—the only US fighter with such capability.

A full load of six Phoenix missiles and its {{convert |2000|lb|kg}} dedicated launcher exceeded a typical Vietnam-era bomb load. Its service in the US Navy was primarily as a deterrent, as its use was hampered by restrictive [[rules of engagement]] in conflicts such as Operations [[Desert Storm]], [[Southern Watch]], and [[Iraqi Freedom]]. The US Navy retired the Phoenix in 2004<ref>{{Citation | title = Navy Retires AIM-54 Phoenix Missile | url = http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=15422 | place = [[United States of America|US]] | publisher = Navy}}</ref> in light of availability of the AIM-120 AMRAAM on the [[F/A-18 Hornet]] and the pending retirement of the F-14 Tomcat from active service in late 2006.

===ACEVAL/AIMVAL===
The [[United States Department of Defense| Department of Defense]] conducted an extensive evaluation of air combat tactics and missile technology from 1974 to 1978 at [[Nellis AFB]] using the F-14 Tomcat and F-15 Eagle equipped with Sparrow and Sidewinder missiles as the blue force and aggressor F-5E aircraft equipped with [[AIM-9L]] [[all-aspect]] Sidewinders as the red force. This [[joint test and evaluation]] (JT&E) was designated Air Combat Evaluation/Air Intercept Missile Evaluation ([[ACEVAL/AIMVAL]]).{{citation needed| date= July 2010| reason= Dead link removed}} A principal finding was that the necessity to produce illumination for the Sparrow until impact resulted in the red force's being able to launch their all-aspect Sidewinders before impact, resulting in mutual kills. What was needed was Phoenix-type multiple-launch and terminal active capability in a Sparrow-size airframe. This led to a [[memorandum of agreement]] (MOA) with European allies (principally the UK and Germany for development) for the US to develop an advanced, medium-range, air-to-air missile with the USAF as lead service. The MOA also assigned responsibility for development of an advanced, short-range, air-to-air missile to the European team; this would become the British [[ASRAAM]].

===Requirements===
[[File:CATM 120C AMRAAM p1230119.jpg|thumb|Surface-to-air mounting (shown: CATM-120C captive training variant)]]
By the 1990s, the reliability of the Sparrow had improved so much from the dismal days of Vietnam that it accounted for the largest number of aerial targets destroyed in [[Gulf War| Desert Storm]]. But while the USAF had passed on the Phoenix and their own similar [[AIM-47]]/[[YF-12]] to optimize dogfight performance, they still needed a multiple-launch fire-and-forget capability for the F-15 and F-16. AMRAAM would need to be fitted on fighters as small as the F-16, and fit in the same spaces that were designed to fit the Sparrow on the F-4 Phantom. The European partners needed AMRAAM to be integrated on aircraft as small as the Sea Harrier. The US Navy needed AMRAAM to be carried on the F/A-18 Hornet and wanted capability for two to be carried on a launcher that normally carried one Sparrow to allow for more air-to-ground weapons. 

The AMRAAM became one of the primary air-to-air weapons of the new [[F-22 Raptor]] fighter, which needed to place all of its weapons into internal weapons bays in order to help achieve an extremely low [[radar cross-section]].

==Development==
[[File:AIM-120 first kill.jpg|thumb|right|150px|First successful test at the White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico 1982]]
AMRAAM was developed as the result of an agreement (the [[Family of Weapons]] MOA, no longer in effect by 1990), among the United States and several other [[NATO]] nations to develop air-to-air missiles and to share production technology. Under this agreement the U.S. was to develop the next generation medium range missile (AMRAAM) and Europe would develop the next generation short range missile ([[ASRAAM]]). Although Europe initially adopted the AMRAAM, an effort to develop the [[MBDA Meteor]], a competitor to AMRAAM, was begun in Great Britain. Eventually the ASRAAM was developed solely by the British, but using another source for its infrared seeker. After protracted development, the deployment of AMRAAM (AIM-120A) began in September 1991 in US Air Force [[F-15 Eagle]] fighter [[Squadron (aviation)| squadron]]s. The US Navy soon followed (in 1993) in its [[F/A-18 Hornet]] squadrons.

The eastern counterpart of AMRAAM is the somewhat similar [[Russian Air Force]] [[Vympel R-77| AA-12 "Adder"]], sometimes referred to in the West as the "AMRAAMski." Likewise, France began its own air-to-air missile development with the [[MICA (missile)|MICA]] concept that used a common airframe for separate radar-guided and infrared-guided versions.

==Operational features summary==
AMRAAM has an all-weather, beyond-visual-range (BVR) capability. It improves the aerial combat capabilities of US and allied aircraft to meet the threat of enemy air-to-air weapons as they existed in 1991. AMRAAM serves as a follow-on to the AIM-7 Sparrow missile series. The new missile is faster, smaller, and lighter, and has improved capabilities against low-altitude targets. It also incorporates a datalink to guide the missile to a point where its active radar turns on and makes terminal intercept of the target. An inertial reference unit and micro-computer system makes the missile less dependent upon the fire-control system of the aircraft.

Once the missile closes in on the target, its [[active radar]] guides it to intercept. This feature, known as "fire-and-forget", frees the aircrew from the need to further provide guidance, enabling the aircrew to aim and fire several missiles simultaneously at multiple targets and perform evasive maneuvers while the missiles guide themselves to the targets.

The missile also features the ability to "Home on Jamming,"<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/missile/aim-120.htm | title = Military Analysis Network: AIM-120 AMRAAM Slammer | date = April 14, 2000 | publisher= FAS | accessdate=April 12, 2012}}</ref> giving it the ability to switch over from active radar homing to passive homing – homing on jamming signals from the target aircraft. Software on board the missile allows it to detect if it is being jammed, and guide on its target using the proper guidance system.

==Guidance system overview==
===Interception course stage===
[[File:F-14 carrying AMRAAM.jpg|thumb|[[Grumman F-14 Tomcat]] carrying an AMRAAM during a 1982 test]]
AMRAAM uses two-stage [[missile guidance|guidance]] when fired at long range. The aircraft passes data to the missile just before launch, giving it information about the location of the target aircraft from the launch point and its direction and speed. The missile uses this information to fly on an interception course to the target using its built in [[inertial navigation system]] (INS). This information is generally obtained using the launching aircraft's radar, although it could come from an [[Infra-red search and track]] system, from a [[Joint Tactical Information Distribution System|data link]] from another fighter aircraft, or from an [[Airborne Early Warning and Control| AWACS]] aircraft.

After launch, if the firing aircraft or surrogate continues to track the target, periodic updates—such as changes in the target's direction and speed—are sent from the launch aircraft to the missile, allowing the missile to adjust its course, via actuation of the rear fins, so that it is able to close to a self-homing distance where it will be close enough to "catch" the target aircraft in the ''basket'' (the missile's radar field of view in which it will be able to lock onto the target aircraft, unassisted by the launch aircraft).

Not all armed services using the AMRAAM have elected to purchase the mid-course update option, which limits AMRAAM's effectiveness in some scenarios. The [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] initially opted not to use mid-course update for its [[Panavia Tornado ADV|Tornado F3]] force, only to discover that without it, testing proved the AMRAAM was less effective in BVR engagements than the older [[semi-active radar homing]] [[Skyflash|BAE Skyflash]] weapon—the AIM-120's own radar is necessarily of limited range and power compared to that of the launch aircraft.

===Terminal stage and impact===
Once the missile closes to self-homing distance, it turns on its active radar seeker and searches for the target aircraft. If the target is in or near the expected location, the missile will find it and guide itself to the target from this point. If the missile is fired at short range, WVR or the near BVR, it can use its active seeker just after launch, making the missile truly "fire and forget". {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

===Boresight mode===
Apart from the slave mode, there is a free guidance mode, called boresight. This mode is radar guidance-free, the missile just fires and locks the first thing it sees. This mode can be used for defensive shot, i.e. when the enemy has numerical superiority.

==Kill probability and tactics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}

===General considerations===
The [[probability of kill|kill probability]] (P<sub>k</sub>) is determined by several factors, including aspect (head-on interception, side-on or tail-chase), altitude, the speed of the missile and the target, and how hard the target can turn. Typically, if the missile has sufficient energy during the terminal phase, which comes from being launched at close range to the target from an aircraft with an altitude and speed advantage, it will have a good chance of success. This chance drops as the missile is fired at longer ranges as it runs out of overtake speed at long ranges, and if the target can force the missile to turn it might bleed off enough speed that it can no longer chase the target. Operationally, the missile, which was designed for [[Beyond-visual-range missile|beyond visual range]] combat, has a P<sub>k</sub> of 59% (17 missiles for 10 kills).<ref>http://www.ausairpower.net/APA-NOTAM-070109-1.html</ref> The targets included six [[Mikoyan MiG-29|MiG-29s]], a [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25|MiG-25]], a [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|MiG-23]], a [[Soko G-4 Super Galeb|Galeb]] and a US Army [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Blackhawk]] that was targeted by mistake.<ref>http://ausairpower.net/APA-Rus-BVR-AAM.html</ref>

==Variants and upgrades==
[[File:Aim 120 amraam missile 20040710 145603 1.4.jpg|thumb|An AIM-120 AMRAAM missile on display at the U.S. National Air and Space Museum]]
[[File:F-22 GBU39B AIM-120 m02006120800117.jpg|thumb|right|AIM-120 AMRAAM (right) fitted in a weapons bay of a [[F-22 Raptor]]]]

===Air-to-air missile versions===
There are currently four main variants of AMRAAM, all in service with the [[United States Air Force]], [[United States Navy]], and the United States Marine Corps. The '''AIM-120A''' is no longer in production and shares the enlarged wings and fins with the successor {{anchor|AIM-120B|B}}'''AIM-120B'''. The AIM-120C has smaller "clipped" aerosurfaces to enable internal carriage on the USAF [[F-22 Raptor]]. AIM-120B deliveries began in 1994.

The {{anchor|AIM-120C|C}}'''AIM-120C''' deliveries began in 1996. The C-variant has been steadily upgraded since it was introduced. The AIM-120C-6 contained an improved fuse (Target Detection Device) compared to its predecessor. The AIM-120C-7 development began in 1998 and included improvements in homing and greater range (actual amount of improvement unspecified). It was successfully tested in 2003 and is currently being produced for both domestic and foreign customers. It helped the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] replace the [[F-14 Tomcat]]s with [[F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]]s&nbsp;– the loss of the F-14's long-range [[AIM-54 Phoenix]] missiles (already retired) is offset with a longer-range AMRAAM-D. The lighter weight of the advanced AMRAAM enables an F/A-18E/F pilot greater bring-back weight upon carrier landings.

The {{anchor|AIM-120D|D}}'''AIM-120D''' is an upgraded version of the AMRAAM with improvements in almost all areas, including 50% greater range (than the already-extended range AIM-120C-7) and better guidance over its entire flight envelope yielding an improved kill probability ([[Probability of kill|P<sub>k</sub>]]). Raytheon began testing the D model on August 5, 2008, the company reported that an AIM-120D launched from an [[F/A-18F Super Hornet]] passed within lethal distance of a QF-4 target drone at the [[White Sands Missile Range]].<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/micro_stories.pl?ACCT=149999&TICK=RTN&STORY=/www/story/08-05-2008/0004861926&EDATE=Aug+5,+2008 Raytheon Press Release, 5 August 2008] {{wayback|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/micro_stories.pl?ACCT=149999&TICK=RTN&STORY=/www/story/08-05-2008/0004861926&EDATE=Aug+5,+2008 |date=20130328015036 }}</ref>

The AIM-120D (P3I Phase 4, formerly known as AIM-120C-8) is a development of the AIM-120C with a two-way data link, more accurate navigation using a GPS-enhanced IMU, an expanded no-escape envelope, improved HOBS (High-Angle Off-Boresight) capability, and a 50% increase in range. The AIM-120D is a joint USAF/USN project, and is currently in the testing phase. The USN was scheduled to field it from 2014, and AIM-120D will be carried by all Pacific carrier groups by 2020, although the [[Budget sequestration in 2013|2013 sequestration cuts]] could push back this later date to 2022.<ref name=Greenert20130918 >{{cite web | url=http://docs.house.gov/meetings/AS/AS00/20130918/101291/HHRG-113-AS00-Wstate-GreenertUSNJ-20130918.pdf | format=PDF | first=Admiral Jonathan | last=Greenert | authorlink=Jonathan Greenert | title=Statement Before The House Armed Services Committee on Planning For Sequestration in FY 2014 And Perspectives of the Military Services on the Strategic Choices And Management Review | date=September 18, 2013 | publisher=US House of Representatives | accessdate=September 21, 2013}}</ref>

There are also plans for [[Raytheon]] to develop a [[ramjet]]-powered derivative of the AMRAAM, the {{anchor|FMRAAM}}Future Medium Range Air-Air Missile ([[FMRAAM]]). It is not known whether the FMRAAM will be produced since the target market, the British Ministry of Defence, has chosen the [[MBDA Meteor|Meteor missile]] over the FMRAAM for a [[BVR]] missile for the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] aircraft.

Raytheon is also working with the [[Missile Defense Agency]] to develop the [[Network Centric Airborne Defense Element]] (NCADE), an anti-ballistic missile derived from the AIM-120. This weapon will be equipped with a [[Ramjet]] engine and an [[infrared homing]] seeker derived from the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder|Sidewinder]] missile. In place of a proximity-fused warhead, the NCADE will use a [[kinetic energy]] [[hit-to-kill]] vehicle based on the one used in the Navy's [[RIM-161 Standard Missile 3]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/ncade-an-abm-amraam-03305/ |title=Defense Industry Daily report, 20 November 2008 |publisher=Defenseindustrydaily.com |date=November 20, 2008 |accessdate=April 12, 2012}}</ref>

The −120A and −120B models are currently nearing the end of their service life while the −120D variant has just entered full production. AMRAAM was due to be replaced by the [[USAF]], the [[U.S. Navy]], and the [[U.S. Marine Corps]] after 2020 by the Joint Dual Role Air Dominance Missile ([[Next Generation Missile]]). This was unexpectedly terminated in the 2013 budget plan,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/usaf-cancels-amraam-replacement-368249/ |title=USAF cancels AMRAAM replacement |work=Flight International |date=February 14, 2012 |accessdate=April 12, 2012}}</ref> and so the future replacement is uncertain.

===Ground-launched systems===
[[File:AIM-120 AMRAAM P6230147.JPG|thumb|Battery of four SL-AMRAAM on HMMWV]]

[[Raytheon]] successfully tested launching AMRAAM missiles from a five-missile carrier on a M1097 [[Humvee]]. This system will be known as the '''SLAMRAAM''' (Surface Launched (SL) and AMRAAM). They receive their initial guidance information from a radar not mounted on the vehicle. Since the missile is launched without the benefit of an aircraft's speed or high altitude, its range is considerably shorter. Raytheon is currently marketing an SL-AMRAAM EX, purported to be an extended range AMRAAM and bearing a resemblance to the [[RIM-162 ESSM]].

The [[NASAMS|Norwegian Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System]] (NASAMS), developed by [[Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace]], consists of a number of vehicle-pulled launch batteries (containing six AMRAAMs each) along with separate radar trucks and control station vehicles.

While still under evaluation for replacement of current US Army assets, the SL-AMRAAM has been deployed in several nations' military forces. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has requested the purchasing of SL-AMRAAM as part of a larger 7 billion dollar foreign military sales package. The sale would include 288 AMRAAM C-7 missiles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=defense&id=news/DSCA091108.xml&headline=DSCA%20Announces%20Billions%20In%20Military%20Sales |title=DSCA Announces Billions in Military Sales |publisher=Aviation Week |date=September 11, 2008 |accessdate=April 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120307150630/http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=defense&id=news/DSCA091108.xml&headline=DSCA%20Announces%20Billions%20In%20Military%20Sales |archivedate=7 March 2012 }}</ref>

The US Army has test fired the SL-AMRAAM from a [[HIMARS]] artillery rocket launcher as a common launcher, as part of a move to switch to a larger and more survivable launch platform.<ref>[http://www.lockheedmartin.com/news/press_releases/2009/MFC_032509_LockheedMartinsHIMARSLauncher.html HIMARS Launcher Successfully Fires Air Defense Missile] {{wayback|url=http://www.lockheedmartin.com/news/press_releases/2009/MFC_032509_LockheedMartinsHIMARSLauncher.html |date=20150113101907 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2010/09/10/Raytheon-Army-test-new-SLAMRAAM-platform/UPI-16391284134034/ |title=Raytheon, Army test new SLAMRAAM platform |publisher=Upi.com |date=September 10, 2010 |accessdate=April 12, 2012}}</ref>

The National Guard Association of the United States has sent a letter asking for the United States Senate to stop the Army's plan to drop the SLAMRAAM program because without it there would be no path to modernize the Guard's [[AN/TWQ-1 Avenger]] Battalions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=4847002&c=AME&s=LAN |title=U.S. Army Recommends SLAMRAAM Termination |publisher=Defensenews.com |accessdate=April 12, 2012}}</ref>

On January 6, 2011, Secretary of Defense [[Robert Gates]] announced that the U.S. Army has decided to terminate acquisition of the SLAMRAAM as part of a budget-cutting effort.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://richmedia.onset.freedom.com/nwfdn/lemv4s-7jsfgatestranscripts.pdf|title=Statement on Department Budget and Efficiencies|work=U.S. Department of Defense|date=January 6, 2011|format=PDF|accessdate=July 13, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110711025437/http://richmedia.onset.freedom.com/nwfdn/lemv4s-7jsfgatestranscripts.pdf| archivedate= July 11, 2011 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

On February 22, 2015 Raytheon announced an Extended Range upgrade to NASAMS-launched AMRAAM, calling it [[NASAMS#AMRAAM-ER|AMRAAM-ER]].

==Operational history==
The AMRAAM was used for the first time on December 27, 1992, when a USAF [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16D]] shot down an Iraqi [[MiG-25]] that violated the southern no-fly-zone.<ref>Bjorkman, Eileen, Small, fast and in your face, Air & Space, February/March 2014, p,35</ref> Interestingly, this missile had been returned from the flight line as defective a day earlier. AMRAAM gained a second victory in January 1993 when an Iraqi [[MiG-23]] was shot down by a USAF [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16C]].

The third combat use of the AMRAAM was in 1994, when a [[Republika Srpska Air Force]] [[Soko J-21 Jastreb|J-21 Jastreb]] aircraft was shot down by a USAF [[F-16]]C that was patrolling the UN-imposed no-fly zone over [[Bosnia]]. In that engagement, at least three other Serbian aircraft were shot down by USAF F-16C fighters using [[AIM-9]] missiles (see [[Banja Luka incident]] for more details). At that point, three launches in combat had resulted in three kills, resulting in the AMRAAM's being informally named "slammer" in the second half of the 1990s.

In 1998 and 1999 AMRAAMs were again fired by USAF [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15]] fighters at Iraqi aircraft violating the No-Fly-Zone, but this time they failed to hit their targets. During the spring of 1999, AMRAAMs saw their main combat action during [[Operation Allied Force]], the Kosovo [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|bombing campaign]]. Six Serbian MiG-29 were shot down by NATO (4 USAF F-15C, 1 USAF F-16C, 1 Dutch F-16A MLU), all of them using AIM-120 missiles (the kill by the F-16C may have happened due to friendly fire, from [[SA-7 MANPAD]] fired by Serbian infantry).<ref name="ausairpower.net">{{cite web|author=Air Power Australia |url=http://www.ausairpower.net/APA-Rus-BVR-AAM.html |title=Air Power Australia: Technical Report APA-TR-2008-0301 |publisher=Ausairpower.net |accessdate=April 12, 2012}}</ref>

As of mid 2008, the AIM-120 AMRAAM has shot down nine aircraft (six [[MiG-29]]s, one [[MiG-25]], one [[MiG-23]], and one [[Soko J-21 Jastreb]]).<ref name="ausairpower.net"/> An AMRAAM was also involved in a friendly fire incident in 1994 when [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15]] fighters patrolling Iraq's Northern No-Fly Zone [[1994 Black Hawk shootdown incident|inadvertently shot down]] a pair of [[U.S. Army]] [[UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk]] helicopters.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/15/world/us-jets-over-iraq-attack-own-helicopters-in-error-all-26-on-board-are-killed.html |title=U.S. JETS OVER IRAQ ATTACK OWN HELICOPTERS IN ERROR; ALL 26 ON BOARD ARE KILLED |last=R.

Since 2007 Raytheon has continued to slip on AMRAAM deliveries, leading the USAF to withhold $621 million in 2012 on account of 193 missiles not delivered.<ref>Farrell, Michael B. [http://articles.boston.com/2012-03-21/business/31215613_1_raytheon-chief-executive-raytheon-stock-missile-deliveries "Air Force holding back $621m from Raytheon."] ''Boston Globe''.

On 23 March 2014, a Turkish Air Force F-16 shot down a Syrian Air Force Mig-23 that was violating air space.{{cn|date=August 2015}}

==Foreign sales==
Canadair, now [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]], had largely helped with the development of the [[AIM-7 Sparrow]] and Sparrow II, and assisted to a less extent in the AIM-120 development. Canada had placed an order for 256 AIM-120's, but cancelled half of them after engine ignition problems due to cold weather conditions. The AIM-9X & AIM-7 were ordered as replacements.

In early 1995 South Korea ordered 88 AIM-120A missiles for its KF-16 fleet. In 1997 South Korea ordered additional 737 AIM-120B missiles.<ref>http://newslibrary.naver.com/viewer/index.nhn?articleId=1995081400329102011&editNo=40&printCount=1&publishDate=1995-08-14&officeId=00032&pageNo=2&printNo=15510&publishType=00010</ref><ref>http://www.deagel.com/equipment/Air-to-Air-Missiles/AIM-120-AMRAAM.htm</ref>

In 2006 Poland received AIM-120C-5 missiles to arm its new [[F-16|F-16C/D Block 52+]] fighters.<ref name="deagel">[http://www.deagel.com/equipment/Air-to-Air-Missiles-AIM-120-AMRAAM-a001164.aspx] {{wayback|url=http://www.deagel.com/equipment/Air-to-Air-Missiles-AIM-120-AMRAAM-a001164.aspx |date=20140202092357 }}</ref>

In early 2006, the [[Pakistan Air Force]] (PAF) ordered 500 AIM-120C-5 AMRAAM missiles as part of a $650 million F-16 ammunition deal to equip its [[F-16|F-16C/D Block 50/52+]] and [[F-16|F-16A/B Block 15 MLU]] fighters. The PAF got the first three F-16C/D Block 50/52+ aircraft on July 3, 2010 and first batch of AMRAAMs on July 26, 2010.<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/micro_stories.pl?ACCT=149999&TICK=RTN&STORY=/www/story/01-15-2007/0004505958&EDATE=Jan+15,+2007 Raytheon Press Release, 15 January 2007] {{wayback|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/micro_stories.pl?ACCT=149999&TICK=RTN&STORY=/www/story/01-15-2007/0004505958&EDATE=Jan+15,+2007 |date=20150705134733 }}</ref>

In 2007, the United States government agreed to sell 218 AIM-120C-7 missiles to Taiwan as part of a large arms sales package that also included 235 AGM-65G-2 Maverick missiles. Total value of the package, including launchers, maintenance, spare parts, support and training rounds, was estimated at around US$421 million. This supplemented an earlier Taiwanese purchase of 120 AIM-120C-5 missiles a few years ago.<ref name="deagel"/>

2008 has brought announcements of new or additional sales to Singapore, Finland, Morocco and South Korea; in December 2010 the Swiss government requested 150 AIM-120C-7 missiles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defpro.com/news/details/20859/|accessdate=December 27, 2010|title=defence.professionals | publisher =defpro.com}}</ref> Sales to Finland have stalled, because the manufacturer has not been able to fix a mysterious bug that causes the rocket motors of the missile to fail in cold tests.<ref>[http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/Outo+vika+pys%C3%A4ytti+ohjuskaupan/a1346553626705 Outo vika pysäytti ohjuskaupan – Kotimaa – Helsingin Sanomat<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Cold weather malfunctions==
[[Finnish Defence Forces]] reported<ref name="hs.fi">[http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Mysterious+fault+causes+suspension+of+missile+delivery+from+US+manufacturer+Raytheon+/1329104729695 Helsingin Sanomat – International Edition – Home<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> on September 3, 2012 that the United States had not delivered any of the AMRAAM anti-aircraft missiles they had ordered due to a mysterious engine malfunction in cold weather. The manufacturer, [[Raytheon]], has not been able to determine the cause of the problem. Colonel Kari Renko, an engineer at the Finnish Air Force, was quoted<ref name="hs.fi"/> by [[Helsingin Sanomat]] as saying, ''"The problem involves the rocket engines which have been in use for decades"'' and that Finland first was told of the problems by the Americans about two years ago. The reason for the malfunction has been determined to be a change in the chemical formula of the rocket propellant to comply with new environmental regulations. The change caused the supplier of AMRAAM rocket motors, [[Alliant Techsystems]], to produce motors that were unreliable, especially in cold conditions where aircraft carrying them would fly. ATK has been unable to find a solution, and no new AMRAAM missiles had been delivered to the USAF since 2010 as a result. In late 2012, Raytheon solved the problem by selecting Norwegian ammunition manufacturer [[Nammo]] Raufoss to be their new supplier of AMRAAM rocket motors.<ref>Nammo is a 50/50 joint venture of the state of Norway and the Finnish partly state-owned Patria corporation.
