Originally money was a form of receipt, representing grain stored in temple granaries in<space/><link><target>Sumer</target></link><space/>in ancient<space/><link><target>Mesopotamia</target></link>, then<space/><link><target>Ancient Egypt</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>In this first stage of currency, metals were used as symbols to represent value stored in the form of commodities. This formed the basis of trade in the<space/><link><target>Fertile Crescent</target></link><space/>for over 1500 years. However, the<space/><link><target>Bronze Age collapse</target><part>collapse of the Near Eastern trading system</part></link><space/>pointed to a flaw: in an era where there was no place that was safe to store value, the value of a circulating medium could only be as sound as the forces that defended that store. Trade could only reach as far as the credibility of that military. By the late<space/><link><target>Bronze Age</target></link>, however, a series of<space/><link><target>Treaty</target><part>treaties</part></link><space/>had established safe passage for merchants around the Eastern Mediterranean, spreading from<space/><link><target>Minoan civilization</target><part>Minoan</part></link><space/><link><target>Crete</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Mycenae</target></link><space/>in the northwest to<space/><link><target>Elam</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Bahrain</target></link><space/>in the southeast. It is not known what was used as a currency for these exchanges, but it is thought that<space/><link><target>oxhide ingot</target><part>ox-hide shaped ingots</part></link><space/>of copper, produced in<space/><link><target>Cyprus</target></link>, may have functioned as a currency.</paragraph><paragraph>It is thought that the increase in piracy and raiding associated with the<space/><link><target>Bronze Age collapse</target></link>, possibly produced by the<space/><link><target>Peoples of the Sea</target></link>, brought the trading system of oxhide ingots to an end. It was only with the recovery of Phoenician trade in the 10th and 9th centuries BC that saw a return to prosperity, and the appearance of real coinage, possibly first in Anatolia with<space/><link><target>Croesus</target></link><space/>of<space/><link><target>Lydia</target></link><space/>and subsequently with the Greeks and Persians. In Africa many forms of value store have been used, including beads, ingots,<space/><link><target>ivory</target></link>, various forms of weapons, livestock, the<space/><link><target>manilla currency</target></link>, and ochre and other earth oxides. The manilla rings of<space/><link><target>West Africa</target></link><space/>were one of the currencies used from the 15th century onwards to sell slaves.<space/><link><target>African currency</target></link><space/>is still notable for its variety, and in many places various forms of<space/><link><target>barter</target></link><space/>still apply.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Coinage</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Coin</arg></template>These factors led to the metal itself being the store of value: first silver, then both silver and gold, and at one point also bronze. Now we have copper coins and other non-precious metals as coins. Metals were mined, weighed, and stamped into coins. This was to assure the individual taking the coin that he was getting a certain known weight of precious metal. Coins could be counterfeited, but they also created a new<space/><link><target>unit of account</target></link>, which helped lead to<space/><link><target>banking</target></link>.<space/><link><target>Archimedes' principle</target></link><space/>provided the next link: coins could now be easily tested for their<space/><link><target>Fineness</target><part>fine</part></link><space/>weight of metal, and thus the value of a coin could be determined, even if it had been shaved, debased or otherwise tampered with (see<space/><link><target>Numismatics</target></link>).</paragraph><paragraph>Most major economies using coinage had three tiers of coins: copper, silver and gold. Gold coins were used for large purchases, payment of the military and backing of state activities. Silver coins were used for midsized transactions, and as a unit of account for taxes, dues, contracts and fealty, while copper coins were used for everyday transactions. This system had been used in ancient<space/><link><target>Indian coinage</target><part>India</part></link><space/>since the time of the<space/><link><target>Mahajanapadas</target></link>. In Europe, this system worked through the<space/><link><target>medieval</target></link><space/>period because there was virtually no new gold, silver or copper introduced through mining or conquest.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">March 2010</arg></template><space/>Thus the overall ratios of the three coinages remained roughly equivalent.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Paper money</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Banknote</arg></template>In<space/><link><target>History of China</target><part>premodern</part></link><space/><link><target>China</target></link>, the need for credit and for a medium of exchange that was less physically cumbersome than large numbers of<space/><link><target>copper</target></link><space/>coins led to the introduction of<space/><link><target>paper money</target></link>, i.e.<space/><link><target>banknote</target><trail>s</trail></link>. Their introduction was a gradual process which lasted from the late<space/><link><target>Tang dynasty</target></link><space/>(618907) into the<space/><link><target>Song dynasty</target></link><space/>(9601279). It began as a means for merchants to exchange heavy coinage for<space/><link><target>receipt</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>of deposit issued as<space/><link><target>promissory note</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>by<space/><link><target>wholesaler</target><trail>s</trail></link>' shops. These notes were valid for temporary use in a small regional territory. In the 10th century, the<space/><link><target>Song dynasty</target></link><space/>government began to circulate these notes amongst the traders in its<space/><link><target>monopoly</target><part>monopolized</part></link><space/>salt industry. The Song government granted several shops the right to issue banknotes, and in the early 12th century the government finally took over these shops to produce state-issued currency. Yet the banknotes issued were still only locally and temporarily valid: it was not until the mid 13th century that a standard and uniform government issue of paper money became an acceptable nationwide currency.

As Sweden was rich in copper, its low value necessitated extraordinarily big coins, often weighing several kilograms.<space/></paragraph><paragraph>The advantages of paper currency were numerous: it reduced the need to transport gold and silver, which was risky; it facilitated loans of gold or silver at interest, since the underlying<space/><link><target>Hard money (policy)</target><part>specie</part></link><space/>(gold or silver) never left the possession of the lender until someone else redeemed the note; and it allowed a division of currency into credit and specie backed forms. It enabled the sale of<space/><link><target>stock</target></link><space/>in<space/><link><target>joint stock company</target><part>joint stock companies</part></link>, and the redemption of those<space/><link><target>Share (finance)</target><part>shares</part></link><space/>in paper.</paragraph><paragraph>But there were also disadvantages. First, since a note has no intrinsic value, there was nothing to stop issuing authorities from printing more notes than they had specie to back them with. Second, because it increased the money supply, it increased inflationary pressures, a fact observed by<space/><link><target>David Hume</target></link><space/>in the 18th century. Thus paper money would often lead to an inflationary bubble, which could collapse if people began demanding hard money, causing the demand for paper notes to fall to zero. The printing of paper money was also associated with wars, and financing of wars, and therefore regarded as part of maintaining a<space/><link><target>standing army</target></link>. For these reasons, paper currency was held in suspicion and hostility in Europe and America. It was also addictive, since the speculative profits of trade and capital creation were quite large. Major nations established<space/><link><target>mint (coin)</target><part>mints</part></link><space/>to print money and mint coins, and branches of their treasury to collect taxes and hold gold and silver stock.</paragraph><paragraph>At that time, both silver and gold were considered<space/><link><target>legal tender</target></link>, and accepted by governments for taxes. However, the<space/><link><target>Gresham's law</target><part>instability in the ratio</part></link><space/>between the two grew over the course of the 19th century, with the increases both in supply of these metals, particularly silver, and in trade. The parallel use of both metals is called<space/><link><target>bimetallism</target></link>, and the attempt to create a<space/><link><target>Bimetallism</target><part>bimetallic</part></link><space/>standard where both gold and silver backed currency remained in circulation occupied the efforts of<space/><link><target>inflation</target><trail>ists</trail></link>. Governments at this point could use currency as an instrument of policy, printing paper currency such as the United States<space/><link><target>United States Note</target><part>Greenback</part></link>, to pay for military expenditures. They could also set the terms at which they would redeem notes for specie, by limiting the amount of purchase, or the minimum amount that could be redeemed.</paragraph><paragraph>By 1900, most of the industrializing nations were on some form of<space/><link><target>gold standard</target></link>, with paper notes and silver coins constituting the circulating medium. Private<space/><link><target>bank</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and governments across the world followed<space/><link><target>Gresham's Law</target></link>: keeping the gold and silver they received, but paying out in notes. This did not happen all around the world at the same time, but occurred sporadically, generally in times of war or financial crisis, beginning in the early part of the 20th century and continuing across the world until the late 20th century, when the regime of floating fiat currencies came into force. One of the last countries to break away from the gold standard was the United States in 1971.</paragraph><paragraph>No country anywhere in the world today has an enforceable gold standard or<space/><link><target>silver standard</target></link><space/>currency system.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Banknote era</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Banknote</arg><arg>Fiat currency</arg></template>A<space/><link><target>banknote</target></link><space/>(more commonly known as a bill in the United States and Canada) is a type of currency, and commonly used as legal tender in many jurisdictions.
