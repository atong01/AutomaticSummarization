In [[mathematics]], specifically in [[Measure (mathematics)|measure theory]], a '''Borel measure''' on  a [[topological space]] is a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] that is defined on all open sets (and thus on all [[Borel sets]]).<ref>D. H. Fremlin, 2000. ''[http://www.essex.ac.uk/maths/people/fremlin/mt.htm Measure Theory]''. Torres Fremlin.</ref> Some authors require additional restrictions on the measure, as described below.

==Formal definition==
Let ''X'' be a [[locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space]], and let <math>\mathfrak{B}(X)</math> be the [[Sigma-algebra#Generated .CF.83-algebra|smallest σ-algebra]] that contains the [[open set]]s of ''X''; this is known as the σ-algebra of [[Borel set]]s.  A '''Borel measure''' is any measure ''μ'' defined on the σ-algebra of Borel sets.<ref>{{cite book | author=Alan J. Weir | title=General integration and measure | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=1974 | isbn=0-521-29715-X | pages=158–184 }}</ref> Some authors require in addition that ''μ''(''C'')&nbsp;<&nbsp;∞ for every [[compact set]]&nbsp;''C''. If a Borel measure ''μ'' is both [[inner regular]] and [[outer regular]], it is called a [[Borel regular measure|'''regular Borel measure''']] (some authors also require it to be [[Tightness of measures|tight]]). If ''μ'' is both inner regular and [[Locally finite measure|locally finite]], it is called a [[Radon measure]]. Note that a locally finite Borel measure automatically satisfies ''μ''(''C'')&nbsp;<&nbsp;∞ for every compact set&nbsp;''C''.

==On the real line==
The [[real line]] <math>\mathbb R</math> with its [[Real line#As a topological space|usual topology]] is a locally compact Hausdorff space, hence we can define a Borel measure on it. In this case, <math>\mathfrak{B}(\mathbb R)</math> is the smallest σ-algebra that contains the open intervals of <math>\mathbb R</math>. While there are many Borel measures μ, the choice of Borel measure which assigns <math>\mu([a,b])=b-a</math> for every interval <math>[a,b]</math> is sometimes called "the" Borel measure on <math>\mathbb R</math>. In practice, even "the" Borel measure is not the most useful measure defined on the σ-algebra of Borel sets; indeed, the [[Lebesgue measure]] <math>\lambda</math> is an extension of "the" Borel measure which possesses the crucial property that it is a [[complete measure]] (unlike the Borel measure). To clarify, when one says that the Lebesgue measure <math>\lambda</math> is an extension of the Borel measure <math>\mu</math>, it means that every Borel-measurable set ''E'' is also a Lebesgue-measurable set, and the Borel measure and the Lebesgue measure coincide on the Borel sets (i.e., <math>\lambda(E)=\mu(E)</math> for every Borel measurable set).

==Applications==

===Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral===
{{main|Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral}}
The [[Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral]] is the ordinary [[Lebesgue integral]] with respect to a measure known as the Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure, which may be associated to any function of [[bounded variation]] on the real line.  The Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure is a [[regular Borel measure]], and conversely every regular Borel measure on the real line is of this kind.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Halmos|first1=Paul R.|author1-link=Paul R. Halmos|title=Measure Theory | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | isbn=978-0-387-90088-9 | year=1974}}</ref>

===Laplace transform===
{{main|Laplace transform}}
One can define the [[Laplace transform]] of a finite Borel measure μ on the [[real line]] by the [[Lebesgue integral]]<ref>{{harvnb|Feller|1971|loc=§XIII.1}}</ref>

: <math>(\mathcal{L}\mu)(s) = \int_{[0,\infty)} e^{-st}\,d\mu(t).</math>

An important special case is where μ is a [[probability measure]] or, even more specifically, the Dirac delta function. In [[operational calculus]], the Laplace transform of a measure is often treated as though the measure came from a [[distribution function]] ''f''.  In that case, to avoid potential confusion, one often writes

: <math>(\mathcal{L}f)(s) = \int_{0^-}^\infty e^{-st}f(t)\,dt</math>

where the lower limit of 0<sup>−</sup> is shorthand notation for

: <math>\lim_{\varepsilon\downarrow 0}\int_{-\varepsilon}^\infty.</math>

This limit emphasizes that any point mass located at 0 is entirely captured by the Laplace transform.  Although with the [[Lebesgue integral]], it is not necessary to take such a limit, it does appear more naturally in connection with the [[Laplace–Stieltjes transform]].

===Hausdorff dimension and Frostman's lemma===
{{main|Hausdorff dimension|Frostman's lemma}}

Given a Borel measure μ on a metric space ''X'' such that μ(''X'') > 0 and μ(''B''(''x'', ''r'')) ≤ ''r<sup>s</sup>'' holds for some constant ''s'' > 0 and for every ball ''B''(''x'', ''r'') in ''X'', then the [[Hausdorff dimension]] dim<sub>Haus</sub>(''X'') ≥ ''s''. A partial converse is provided by [[Frostman's lemma]]:<ref>{{cite book

'''Lemma:''' Let ''A'' be a [[Borel measurable|Borel]] subset of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, and let ''s''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0. Then the following are equivalent:
*''H''<sup>''s''</sup>(''A'')&nbsp;>&nbsp;0, where ''H''<sup>''s''</sup> denotes the ''s''-dimensional [[Hausdorff measure]].
*There is an (unsigned) Borel measure ''&mu;'' satisfying ''&mu;''(''A'')&nbsp;>&nbsp;0, and such that 
::<math>\mu(B(x,r))\le r^s</math> 
:holds for all ''x''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> and ''r''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0.

===Cramér–Wold theorem===
{{main|Cramér–Wold theorem}}
The [[Cramér–Wold theorem]] in [[measure theory]] states that a Borel [[probability measure]] on <math>R^k</math> is uniquely determined by the totality of its one-dimensional projections.<ref>K. Stromberg, 1994. ''Probability Theory for Analysts''. Chapman and Hall.</ref> It is used as a method for proving joint convergence results. The theorem is named after [[Harald Cramér]] and [[Herman Ole Andreas Wold]].
