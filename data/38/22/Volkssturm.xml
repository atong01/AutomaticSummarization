Because of continuous fighting and weapon shortages, weapon training was often minimal. There was also a lack of instructors, meaning that weapons training was sometimes done by World War I veterans drafted into service themselves. Often<space/><italics>Volkssturm</italics><space/>members were only able to familiarize themselves with their weapons when in actual combat.</paragraph><paragraph>There was no standardization of any kind and units were issued only what equipment was available. This was true of every form of equipment<italics>Volkssturm</italics><space/>members were required to bring their own uniforms and culinary equipment etc. This resulted in the units looking very ragged and, instead of boosting civilian morale, it often reminded people of Germany's desperate state.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Hertzstein 1986 p. 248"></extension><space/>Armament was equally haphazard: though some<space/><link><target>Karabiner 98k</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>were on hand, members were also issued older<space/><link><target>Gewehr 98</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and 19th-century<space/><link><target>Mauser Model 1871</target><part>Gewehr 71s</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Steyr-Mannlicher M1888</target><trail>s</trail></link>, as well as<space/><link><target>Dreyse M1907</target></link><space/>pistols. In addition there was a plethora of Soviet, British, Belgian, French, Italian, and other weapons that had been captured by German forces during the war. The Germans had also developed cheap but reasonably effective<space/><italics>Volkssturm</italics><space/>weapons, like<space/><link><target>MP 3008</target></link><space/>machine pistols,<space/><link><target>Volkssturmgewehr 1-5</target></link><space/>rifles and<space/><link><target>VMG-27</target></link><space/>light machine guns. These were completely stamped and machine-pressed constructions (in the 1940s, industrial processes were much cruder than today, so a firearm needed great amounts of semi-artisanal work to be actually reliable). The<space/><italics>Volkssturm</italics><space/>troops were nominally supplied when and where possible by both by the Wehrmacht and the SS,<extension extension_name='ref'>Duffy (2002).<space/><italics>Red Storm on the Reich: The Soviet March on Germany, 1945</italics>, p. 383.</extension><space/>but often times they had little to spare. Being armed with leftovers compounded the<space/><italics>Volkssturm's</italics><space/>ineffectiveness; the large number of different ammunition types also put a strain on an already burdened logistics system (for example, the Gewehr 71s used a different type of ammunition than the two 98 rifles). In the last few months of the war, the shortages of modern firearms led to the use of weapons such as shotguns, and even muskets and crossbows taken from museums.</paragraph><paragraph>When units had completed their training and received armament, members took a customary<space/><link><target>Hitler oath</target><part>oath to Hitler</part></link><space/>and were then dispatched into combat. Unlike most English-speaking countries, Germany had universal military service for all young men for several generations, so many of the older members would have had at least basic military training from when they served in the<space/><link><target>Imperial German army</target><part>German Army</part></link><space/>and many would have been veterans of the<space/><link><target>First World War</target></link>.<space/><italics>Volkssturm</italics><space/>units were supposed to be used only in their own districts, but many were sent directly to the front lines. Ultimately, it was their charge to confront the overwhelming power of the British, American, Canadian, Polish, and Soviet armies alongside Wehrmacht forces to either turn the tide of the war or set a shining example for future generations of Germans and expunge the defeat of 1918 by fighting to the last, dying before surrendering.<extension extension_name='ref'>Berd Wegner, &quot;Zweite Weltkrieg und die Choreographie des Untergangs&quot;,<space/><italics>Geschichte und Gesellschaft</italics>, vol. xxvi (2000), no. 3, pp. 492-518.

Unremittingly fanatical members of the<space/><italics>Volkssturm</italics><space/>refused to abandon the Nazi ethos unto the dying days of the Third Reich and in a number of instances, took brutal police &quot;actions&quot; against German civilians deemed defeatists or cowards.<extension extension_name='ref'>Kershaw (2011).<space/><italics>The End: The Defiance and Destruction of Hitler's Germany, 1944-1945</italics>, p. 87.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>On some occasions, members of the<space/><italics>Volkssturm</italics><space/>showed tremendous courage and a determined will to resist, more so even than soldiers in the<space/><italics>Wehrmacht</italics>.

As American troops approached in midmorning on April 12, shots from the village rang out. Angered, the Americans commenced a two-hour artillery barrage complemented by aerial attacks that gutted the town with incendiary and high-explosive bombs. With their village engulfed in flames, the civilian inhabitants, mostly the elderly, women, and children, fled in search of shelter to the surrounding fields, all the while under American fire.<extension extension_name='ref'>Fritz (2004).<space/><italics>Endkampf: Soldiers, Civilians, and the Death of the Third Reich</italics>, p. 121.</extension></listitem></list></listitem></list><paragraph>Not every<space/><italics>Volkssturm</italics><space/>unit was suicidal or apocalyptic in outlook as the war drew closer to its end.
