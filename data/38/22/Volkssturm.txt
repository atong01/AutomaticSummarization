The '''''Volkssturm''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈfɔlks.ʃtʊɐ̯m}}, "people's attack"<ref>Fritz (2004). ''Endkampf: Soldiers, Civilians, and the Death of the Third Reich'', p. ix.</ref><ref>Kershaw (2011). ''The End: The Defiance and Destruction of Hitler's Germany, 1944-1945'', pp. 86-88.</ref>) was a [[Germany|German]] national [[militia]] of the last months of [[World War II]]. It was set up, not by the [[Wehrmacht|traditional German Army]], but by the [[Nazi Party]] on the orders of [[Adolf Hitler]] and its official existence was not announced until October 18, 1944.<ref name="Burleigh 2001 p. 786">Burleigh (2001). ''The Third Reich: A New History'', p. 786.</ref> It conscripted males between the ages [[child soldier|of 13]] and 60 years who were not already serving in some military unit as part of a German [[militia|Home Guard]]. Embodying a last-ditch effort and a call for a heroic defense, the ''Volkssturm'' comprised one of the final components of the [[Total war#Germany|Total War]] promulgated by Propaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]], part of a Nazi endeavor to overcome their enemies' military strength through force of will.<ref>Kershaw (2001). ''Hitler: 1936-1945, Nemesis'', pp. 713-714.</ref>

==Origins and organization==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J28787, Volkssturmbataillon an der Oder.jpg|right|thumb|''Volkssturm'' defending the Oder River February 1945]]
The new ''Volkssturm'' drew inspiration from the old [[Prussian]] ''[[Landsturm]]'' of 1813–1815 <ref>Hertzstein (1986). ''The War That Hitler Won'' p. 246.</ref> that fought in the liberation wars against [[Napoleon]], mainly as guerrilla forces. Plans to form a ''Landsturm'' national militia in [[Former eastern territories of Germany|Eastern Germany]] as a last resort to boost fighting strength initially came from ''[[Oberkommando des Heeres]]'' Army Chief, General [[Heinz Guderian]] in 1944.<ref>Guderian (2001) [1952]. ''Panzer Leader'', p. 362.</ref> Because the [[Wehrmacht]] lacked manpower to stop the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Soviet advance]], men in jobs not deemed necessary, those previously deemed unfit for military service, youth too young to fight previously, and injured soldiers recuperating from their wounds, were now called to arms.<ref>Moorhouse (2012). ''Berlin at War'', p. 351.</ref> The ''Volkssturm'' had existed, on paper, since around 1925, but it was only after Hitler ordered [[Martin Bormann]] to recruit six million men for this militia that the group became a physical reality. The intended strength of six million was never attained.

[[Joseph Goebbels]] and other propagandists depicted the ''Volkssturm'' as an outburst of enthusiasm and will to resist.<ref>Hertzstein (1986). ''The War That Hitler Won'' pp. 251-252.</ref>  It did create some morale, but this was undermined by their visible lack of uniforms and weaponry for the fight.<ref name="Hertzstein 1986 p. 248">Hertzstein (1986). ''The War That Hitler Won'' p. 248.</ref> Nazi themes of death, transcendence, and commemoration were given full play to encourage the fight.<ref>Hertzstein (1986). ''The War That Hitler Won'' p. 252.</ref> However, many also realized that this was a desperate attempt to turn the course of the war. A popular joke and an occasional comment about the ''Volkssturm'' are telling in this regard. Sardonic old men would remark, "''We old monkeys are the Führer’s newest weapon''"; whereas the joke went, "''Why is the Volkssturm Germany's most precious resource?''" to be answered by: "''Because its members have silver in their hair, gold in their mouth, and lead in their bones.''"<ref>Fritz (2004). ''Endkampf: Soldiers, Civilians, and the Death of the Third Reich'', p. 36.</ref>

In order for these militia units to be effective, the Nazis counted not only on strength in numbers, but also on fanaticism.<ref>Benz (2007). ''A Concise History of the Third Reich'', p. 254.</ref> During the early stages of ''Volkssturm'' planning, it became apparent that if militia units lacked morale they would lack combat effectiveness. To achieve the envisaged fanaticism, ''Volkssturm'' units were placed under direct command of the local Nazi party, meaning local ''[[Gauleiter|Gau]]''- and ''[[Kreisleiter]]s''. The new ''Volkssturm'' was also to become a nation-wide organization, with [[Heinrich Himmler]], as Replacement Army Commander, responsible for armament and training. Though normally under party control, ''Volkssturm'' units were placed under [[Wehrmacht]] command when engaged in action. Aware that a 'people's army' would not be able to withstand the onslaught of the modern army wielded by the Allies, Hitler issued the following order towards the end of 1944: 
::Experience in the East has shown that ''Volkssturm'', emergency and reserve units have little fighting value when left to themselves, and can be quickly destroyed. The fighting value of these units, which are for the most part strong in numbers, but weak in the armaments required for modern battle, is immeasurably higher when they go into action with troops of the regular army in the field.

::I, therefore, order: where ''Volkssturm'', emergency, and reserve units are available, together with regular units, in any battle sector, mixed battle-groups (brigades) will be formed under unified command, so as to give the ''Volkssturm'', emergency, and reserve units stiffening and support.<ref>Trevor-Roper (1964). ''Blitzkrieg to Defeat'', p. 204.</ref>

With the Nazi Party in charge of organizing the ''Volkssturm'', each ''Gauleiter'', or Nazi Party District Leader, was charged with the leadership, enrollment, and organization of the ''Volkssturm'' in their district. The largest ''Volkssturm'' unit seems to have corresponded to the next smaller territorial subdivision of the Nazi Party organization—the Kreis. The basic unit was a [[battalion]] of 642 men. Units were mostly composed of members of the [[Hitler Youth]], invalids, the elderly, or men who had previously been considered unfit for military service.<ref name="Massaquoi">[[Hans Jürgen Massaquoi]], of Liberian and German parents, had been rejected by the ''[[Jungvolk]]'' and the Wehrmacht on racial grounds, but was called by the Volkssturm. Hans J. Massaquoi, ''[[Destined to Witness]], 1990.</ref> Further desperation showed when on 12 February 1945, the Nazis conscripted German women and girls into the auxiliaries of the ''Volkssturm''.<ref>Hildebrand (1984). ''The Third Reich'', p. 82.</ref> Correspondingly, girls as young as 14 years began receiving instructions on the use of small-arms, bazookas, machine guns, and hand grenades from December 1944 through May 1945.<ref>Kater (2004). ''Hitler Youth'', p. 238.</ref> Like many aspects of the Nazi ''Volksgemeinschaft'' (people's community), the organization of Germany for war was all inclusive, reaching almost all levels of society as the establishment and expansion of the ''Volkssturm'' reveals.

Municipal organization:

* A ''Bataillon<!--German-->'' (battalion) in every [[Districts of Germany|Kreis]] (roughly equivalent to a [[U.S. county]]; there were 920 ''Kreise'' in Greater Germany)
* A ''Kompanie'' ([[Company (military unit)|company]]) in every Ortsgruppe		
* A ''Zug'' ([[platoon]]) in every Zelle (literally "a cell"; roughly equivalent to a U.S. [[precinct]]) 	   	
* A ''Gruppe'' ([[squad]]) in every Block (city block) 		

Each Gauleiter and Kreisleiter, had a ''Volkssturm'' Chief of Staff to assist in handling militia problems.

From its inception until the very end of the Nazi regime, Himmler and Bormann engaged in a power-struggle over the jurisdictional control over the ''Volkssturm'' regarding security and police powers in Germany and the occupied territories; a contest which Himmler and his SS more or less won on one level (police and security) but lost to Bormann on another (mobilizing reserve forces). Historian David Yelton described the situation as two ranking officers at the helm of a sinking ship fighting over command.<ref>David K. Yelton, "The SS, NSDAP, and the Question of Volkssturm Expansion", in Steinweis & Rogers (2003), ''The Impact of Nazism: New Perspectives on the Third Reich and Its Legacy'', pp. 167-177. (page 176 for ship analogy)</ref>

[[Image:Ranks Volkssturm.jpg|thumb|200px|Gruppenführer (1), Zugführer (2), Kompanieführer (3), Bataillonsführer (4)]]
The ''Volkssturm'' "uniform" was only a black armband with words ''Deutscher Volkssturm Wehrmacht'' with a series of [[silver]] collar pips pinned to the wearer's collar. These were characteristically derived from the [[Nazi party paramilitary ranks|rank insignia]] of the various paramilitary organizations of the [[Nazi Party]], which had control over them, and not of the regular [[Wehrmacht]]. Although the German government tried to issue as many of its members as possible with military uniforms of all sort, ranging from field gray to camouflage, these could not be provided to all its members, thus many members of the ''Volkssturm'' wore makeshift paramilitary uniforms or uniforms from their civilian jobs (such as train conductors of the [[Reichsbahn]]). The simple paramilitary insignia of the ''Volkssturm'' were as follows:

==Training and impact==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J31391, Berlin, Volkssturm, Ausbildung.jpg|thumb|February or March 1945: ''Volkssturm'' members being trained to use the ''[[Panzerfaust]]'' anti-tank weapon.]]
Typically, members of the ''Volkssturm'' received only very basic military training. It included a brief indoctrination and training on the use of basic weapons such as the [[Karabiner 98k]] [[rifle]] and ''[[Panzerfaust]]''. Because of continuous fighting and weapon shortages, weapon training was often minimal. There was also a lack of instructors, meaning that weapons training was sometimes done by World War I veterans drafted into service themselves. Often ''Volkssturm'' members were only able to familiarize themselves with their weapons when in actual combat.

There was no standardization of any kind and units were issued only what equipment was available. This was true of every form of equipment—''Volkssturm'' members were required to bring their own uniforms and culinary equipment etc. This resulted in the units looking very ragged and, instead of boosting civilian morale, it often reminded people of Germany's desperate state.<ref name="Hertzstein 1986 p. 248"/> Armament was equally haphazard: though some [[Karabiner 98k]]s were on hand, members were also issued older [[Gewehr 98]]s and 19th-century [[Mauser Model 1871|Gewehr 71s]] and [[Steyr-Mannlicher M1888]]s, as well as [[Dreyse M1907]] pistols. In addition there was a plethora of Soviet, British, Belgian, French, Italian, and other weapons that had been captured by German forces during the war. The Germans had also developed cheap but reasonably effective ''Volkssturm'' weapons, like [[MP 3008]] machine pistols, [[Volkssturmgewehr 1-5]] rifles and [[VMG-27]] light machine guns. These were completely stamped and machine-pressed constructions (in the 1940s, industrial processes were much cruder than today, so a firearm needed great amounts of semi-artisanal work to be actually reliable). The ''Volkssturm'' troops were nominally supplied when and where possible by both by the Wehrmacht and the SS,<ref>Duffy (2002). ''Red Storm on the Reich: The Soviet March on Germany, 1945'', p. 383.</ref> but often times they had little to spare. Being armed with leftovers compounded the ''Volkssturm's'' ineffectiveness; the large number of different ammunition types also put a strain on an already burdened logistics system (for example, the Gewehr 71s used a different type of ammunition than the two 98 rifles). In the last few months of the war, the shortages of modern firearms led to the use of weapons such as shotguns, and even muskets and crossbows taken from museums.

When units had completed their training and received armament, members took a customary [[Hitler oath|oath to Hitler]] and were then dispatched into combat. Unlike most English-speaking countries, Germany had universal military service for all young men for several generations, so many of the older members would have had at least basic military training from when they served in the [[Imperial German army|German Army]] and many would have been veterans of the [[First World War]]. ''Volkssturm'' units were supposed to be used only in their own districts, but many were sent directly to the front lines. Ultimately, it was their charge to confront the overwhelming power of the British, American, Canadian, Polish, and Soviet armies alongside Wehrmacht forces to either turn the tide of the war or set a shining example for future generations of Germans and expunge the defeat of 1918 by fighting to the last, dying before surrendering.<ref>Berd Wegner, "Zweite Weltkrieg und die Choreographie des Untergangs", ''Geschichte und Gesellschaft'', vol. xxvi (2000), no. 3, pp. 492-518. Cited in Bessel (2010). ''Germany 1945: From War to Peace'', p. 17.</ref> It was an apocalyptic goal which some of those assigned to the ''Volkssturm'' took to heart. Unremittingly fanatical members of the ''Volkssturm'' refused to abandon the Nazi ethos unto the dying days of the Third Reich and in a number of instances, took brutal police "actions" against German civilians deemed defeatists or cowards.<ref>Kershaw (2011). ''The End: The Defiance and Destruction of Hitler's Germany, 1944-1945'', p. 87.</ref>

On some occasions, members of the ''Volkssturm'' showed tremendous courage and a determined will to resist, more so even than soldiers in the ''Wehrmacht''. The ''Volkssturm'' battalion 25/235 for instance, started out with 400 men but fought on until there were only 10 men remaining. Fighting at [[Küstrin]] between 30 January to 29 March 1945, militia units made up mostly of the ''Volkssturm'' resisted for nearly two months. Losses were upwards of 60 percent for the ''Volkssturm'' at [[Kolberg]], roughly 1900 of them died at [[Breslau]], and during the [[Battle of Königsberg]] ([[Kaliningrad]]), another 2400 members of the ''Volkssturm'' were killed.<ref>Sorge (1986). ''The Other Price of Hitler's War: German Military and Civilian Losses Resulting from World War II'', pp. 49-50.</ref> At other times along the western front particularly, ''Volkssturm'' troops would cast their arms aside and disappear into the chaos.<ref name="Burleigh 2001 p. 786"/> Youthful ardor and fanaticism among Hitler Youth members fighting with the ''Volkssturm'' or an insatiable sense of duty from old men proved tragic sometimes. An example shared by historian Stephen Fritz is instructive in this case:
::In one representative village just north of [[Bad Windsheim]], the Herbolzheim ''Volkssturm'' unit, with its customary composition of elderly men and young boys under the influence of a few regular army soldiers, foolishly declared the town a fortress and laid mines in the streets. As American troops approached in midmorning on April 12, shots from the village rang out. Angered, the Americans commenced a two-hour artillery barrage complemented by aerial attacks that gutted the town with incendiary and high-explosive bombs. With their village engulfed in flames, the civilian inhabitants, mostly the elderly, women, and children, fled in search of shelter to the surrounding fields, all the while under American fire.<ref>Fritz (2004). ''Endkampf: Soldiers, Civilians, and the Death of the Third Reich'', p. 121.</ref>

Not every ''Volkssturm'' unit was suicidal or apocalyptic in outlook as the war drew closer to its end. Many of them lost their enthusiasm for the fight when it became clear that the Allies had won, prompting them to lay down their weapons and surrender - they also feared being captured by Allied forces and tortured or executed as partisans.<ref>Moorhouse (2012). ''Berlin at War'', p. 352.</ref>  Duty to their communities and sparing their fellow Germans from atrocities like that described near Bad Windsheim also played a part in their capitulation as did self-preservation.<ref>Bessel (2010). ''Germany 1945: From War to Peace'', p. 22.</ref>

Their most extensive use was during the [[Battle of Berlin]], during which ''Volkssturm'' units fought in many parts of the city. This battle was particularly devastating to its formations, however, since many members fought to the death out of fear of being captured by the Soviets, holding out to the very end which was in keeping with their covenant.<ref>Kissel (1962). ''Der Deutsche Volkssturm 1944/45'', p. 32.</ref> Unfortunately for them, a force of over 2.5 million Soviet troops, equipped with 6,250 tanks and over 40,000 artillery pieces was headed their way as the diminished remnants of the Wehrmacht were no match for their enemy. Meanwhile, Hitler decried "betrayal" to everyone yet hunkered-down in the Berlin bunker.<ref>Bessel (2010). ''Germany 1945: From War to Peace'', pp. 104-109.</ref> Not eager to die what was thought a pointless death above the bunker, many older members of the ''Volkssturm'' looked for places to hide from the approaching Soviet Army.<ref>Kershaw (2001). ''Hitler: 1936-1945, Nemesis'', p. 811.</ref> Juxtaposed against the tragic image of Berlin holding out against all odds, was the frequent exodus and capitulation of Wehrmacht soldiers and members of the ''Volkssturm'' in southern and western Germany.<ref>Bessel (2010). ''Germany 1945: From War to Peace'', pp. 135-137.</ref>

==Battle for Berlin==
In the [[Battle in Berlin|Battle for Berlin]], members of the ''Volkssturm'' (mainly young boys from the ages of 13-18 and old men) were used by the German high command as a last-ditch attempt to defend Berlin. The ''Volkssturm'' had a strength of about 60,000 in the Berlin area formed into 92 battalions, of which about 30 battalions of ''Volkssturm I'' (those with some weapons) were sent to forward positions while those of ''Volkssturm II'' (those without weapons) remained in the inner city. One of the few substantive fighting units left to defend Berlin was the LVI Panzer Corps, which occupied the southeastern sector of the town, whereas the remaining parts of the city were being defended by what remained of the SS, the ''Volkssturm'', and the Hitler Youth formations.<ref>Ziemke (1968). ''Stalingrad to Berlin: The German Defeat in the East'', p. 481.</ref>

One notable and unusual ''Volkssturm'' unit in the Battle for Berlin was the 3/115 [[Siemensstadt]] Battalion. It comprised 770 men, mainly First World War veterans in their 50s who were reasonably fit factory workers, with experienced officers. Unlike most ''Volkssturm'' units it was quite well equipped and trained. It was formed into three rifle companies, a support company (with two [[infantry support gun]]s, four infantry mortars and heavy machine guns), and a heavy weapons company (with four Soviet [[152 mm howitzer-gun M1937 (ML-20)|M-20 howitzers]] and a French De Bange 220&nbsp;mm mortar). The battalion first engaged Soviet troops at [[Friedrichsfelde]] on April 21 and saw the heaviest fighting over the following two days. It held out until May 2 by which time it was down to just 50 rifles and two light machine guns. The survivors fell back to join other ''Volkssturm'' units. 26 men from the battalion were awarded the [[Iron Cross]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Berlin battlefield guide: Third Reich & Cold War|page=212|author=Tony Le Tissier|publisher=Pen & Sword Military|year=2008|isbn=1-84415-766-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Death was our companion: the final days of the Third Reich|page=121|author=Tony Le Tissier|publisher=Sutton|year=2003|isbn=0-7509-3363-1}}</ref> Already in rubble from Allied bombing, the final stand in Berlin dwindled down to street fighting between highly trained, battle-hardened Russian troops at the brink of final victory against the remnants of German police units, a handful of soldiers, the ''Volkssturm'', and flak helpers.<ref>Irving (1991). ''Hitler’s War and the War Path'', p. 826.</ref> The chances of the ''Volkssturm'' making a major difference were never realistic in the face of the overwhelming Allied numbers and material superiority.

While [[Iron Cross|Iron Crosses]] were being handed out in places like Berlin, other cities and towns like [[Parchim]] and [[Mecklenburg]] witnessed old elites, acting as military commandants over the Hitler Youth and ''Volkssturm'', asserting themselves and demanding that the defensive fighting stop so as to spare lives and property.<ref>Bessel (2010). ''Germany 1945: From War to Peace'', pp. 139-140.</ref> Despite their best efforts, the last 4 months of the war were an exercise in futility for the ''Volkssturm'' and the Nazi leadership's insistence to continue the fight to the bitter end contributed an additional 1.23 million (approximated) deaths, half of them German military personnel and the other half from the ''Volkssturm''.<ref>Fritz (2004). ''Endkampf: Soldiers, Civilians, and the Death of the Third Reich'', p. 191.</ref>
