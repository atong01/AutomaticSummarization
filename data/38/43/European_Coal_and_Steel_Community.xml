It gained strong majority votes in all eleven chambers of the parliaments of the Six, as well as approval among associations and European public opinion. In 1950, many had thought another war was inevitable. The steel and coal interests, however, were quite vocal in their opposition. The Council of Europe, created by a proposal of Schuman's first government in May 1948, helped articulate European public opinion and gave the Community idea positive support.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Treaties</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Oprichtingsverdrag EGKS NL-HaNA 2.02.20 10123.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part></part></link></paragraph><paragraph>The 100-article<space/><link><target>Treaty of Paris (1951)</target><part>Treaty of Paris</part></link>, which established the ECSC, was signed on 18 April 1951 by &quot;the<space/><link><target>inner six</target></link>&quot;: France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg (<link><target>Benelux</target></link>).

They were to establish rules to make their membership fully 'representative' for democratic organised civil society. Members were appointed for two years and were not bound by any mandate or instruction of the organisations which appointed them. The Committee had a plenary assembly, bureau and president.

Some mines, for example were clearly unsustainable without government subsidies. Some miners had extremely poor housing. Over 15 years it financed 112,500 flats for workers, paying US$1,770 per flat, enabling workers to buy a home they could not have otherwise afforded. The ECSC also paid half the occupational redeployment costs of those workers who have lost their jobs as coal and steel facilities began to close down. Combined with regional redevelopment aid the ECSC spent $150&amp;nbsp;million creating 100,000 jobs, a third of which were for unemployed coal and steel workers. The welfare guarantees invented by the ECSC were extended to workers outside the coal and steel sector by some of its members.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Mathieu"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Far more important than creating Europe's first social and regional policy, it is argued that the ECSC introduced European peace.

Another world war, or 'world suicide' as Schuman called this threat in 1949, was avoided. In October 1953 Schuman said that the possibility of another European war had been eliminated. Reasoning had to prevail among member states.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">June 2008</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>However the ECSC failed to achieve several fundamental aims of the Treaty of Paris. It was hoped the ECSC would prevent a resurgence of large coal and steel groups such as the<space/><italics>Konzerne</italics>, which helped<space/><link><target>Adolf Hitler</target></link><space/>rise to power. In the Cold War trade-offs, the cartels and major companies re-emerged, leading to apparent<space/><link><target>price fixing</target></link><space/>(another element that was meant to be tackled). With a democratic supervisory system the worst aspects of past abuse were avoided with the anti-cartel powers of the Authority, the first international anti-cartel agency in the world. Efficient firms were allowed to expand into a European market without undue domination. Oil, gas, electricity became natural competitors to coal and also broke cartel powers. Furthermore, with the move to oil, the Community failed to define a proper energy policy. The Euratom treaty was largely stifled by de Gaulle and the European governments refused the suggestion of an Energy Community involving electricity and other vectors that was suggested at Messina in 1955. In a time of high inflation and monetary instability ECSC also fell short of ensuring an upward equalisation of pay of workers within the market. These failures could be put down to overambition in a short period of time, or that the goals were merely political posturing to be ignored. It has been argued that the greatest achievements of the European Coal and Steel Community lie in its revolutionary democratic concepts of a supranational Community.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Mathieu"></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Energy Community</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Energy policy of the European Union</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Flag of the European Coal and Steel Community</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>History of the European Union</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>History of the Ruhr District</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Industrial plans for Germany</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Monnet plan</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Schuman Declaration</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Supranationalism</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Supranational union</target></link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>Reflist</target></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>Further reading</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last"><space/>Grin<space/></arg><arg name="first"><space/>Gilles<space/></arg><arg name="year"><space/>2003<space/></arg><arg name="title"><space/>The Battle of the Single European Market: Achievements and Economic Thought, 1945–2000<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Kegan Paul<space/></arg><arg name="isbn"><space/>978-0-7103-0938-9</arg></template></listitem><listitem><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last"><space/>Hitchcock<space/></arg><arg name="first"><space/>William I.<space/></arg><arg name="year"><space/>1998<space/></arg><arg name="title"><space/>France Restored: Cold War Diplomacy and the Quest for Leadership in Europe, 1944–1954<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">University of North Carolina Press<space/></arg><arg name="isbn"><space/>0-8078-4747-X</arg></template></listitem><listitem><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last"><space/>Maas<space/></arg><arg name="first"><space/>Willem<space/></arg><arg name="year"><space/>2007<space/></arg><arg name="title"><space/>Creating European Citizens<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Rowman & Littlefield<space/></arg><arg name="isbn"><space/>978-0-7425-5485-6</arg></template></listitem><listitem><template><target>Cite book</target><arg name="title"><space/>Schuman or Monnet?
