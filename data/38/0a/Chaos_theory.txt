==Introduction==
Chaos theory concerns deterministic systems whose behavior can in principle be predicted. Chaotic systems are predictable for a while and then 'appear' to become random. The amount of time for which the behavior of a chaotic system can be effectively predicted depends on three things: How much uncertainty we are willing to tolerate in the forecast, how accurately we are able to measure its current state, and a time scale depending on the dynamics of the system, called the [[Lyapunov time]]. Some examples of Lyapunov times are: chaotic electrical circuits, about 1 millisecond; weather systems, a few  days (unproven); the solar system, 50 million years. In chaotic systems, the uncertainty in a forecast increases exponentially with elapsed time. Hence, doubling the forecast time more than squares the proportional uncertainty in the forecast.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} This means, in practice, a meaningful prediction cannot be made over an interval of more than two or three times the Lyapunov time. When meaningful predictions cannot be made, the system appears to be random.<ref>''Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order'', Steven Strogatz, Hyperion, New York, 2003, pages 189-190.</ref>

Devaney]] says that, for a dynamical system to be classified as chaotic, it must have these properties:<ref>{{cite book|title=A First Course in Dynamics: With a Panorama of Recent Developments|last=Hasselblatt|first=Boris|author2=Anatole Katok|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-58750-6}}</ref>

===Sensitivity to initial conditions===
{{Main|Butterfly effect}}

'''Sensitivity to initial conditions''' means that each point in a chaotic system is arbitrarily closely approximated by other points with significantly different future paths, or trajectories. Thus, an arbitrarily small change, or perturbation, of the current trajectory may lead to significantly different future behavior.

In some cases, the last two properties in the above have been shown to actually imply sensitivity to initial conditions,<ref>{{cite book |author=Elaydi, Saber N. |title=Discrete Chaos |publisher=Chapman & Hall/CRC |year=1999 |isbn=1-58488-002-3 |page=117 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Basener, William F. |title=Topology and its applications |publisher=Wiley |year=2006 |isbn=0-471-68755-3 |page=42 }}</ref> and if attention is restricted to [[Interval (mathematics)|intervals]], the second property implies the other two<ref>{{cite journal |author=Vellekoop, Michel; Berglund, Raoul |title=On Intervals, Transitivity = Chaos |journal=The American Mathematical Monthly |volume=101 |issue=4 |pages=353–5 |date=April 1994 |jstor=2975629 |doi=10.2307/2975629}}</ref> (an alternative, and in general weaker, definition of chaos uses only the first two properties in the above list).<ref>{{cite book |author=Medio, Alfredo; Lines, Marji |title=Nonlinear Dynamics: A Primer |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-521-55874-3 |page=165 }}</ref> The most practically significant property, sensitivity to initial conditions, is redundant in the definition, since it is implied by two (or for intervals, one) purely [[Topology|topological]] properties, which are therefore of greater interest to mathematicians.

Sensitivity to initial conditions is popularly known as the "[[butterfly effect]]", so-called because of the title of a paper given by [[Edward Lorenz]] in 1972 to the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in Washington, D.C., entitled ''Predictability: Does the Flap of a Butterfly’s Wings in Brazil set off a Tornado in Texas?''. The flapping wing represents a small change in the initial condition of the system, which causes a chain of events leading to large-scale phenomena. Had the butterfly not flapped its wings, the trajectory of the system might have been vastly different.

A consequence of sensitivity to initial conditions is that if we start with only a finite amount of information about the system (as is usually the case in practice), then beyond a certain time the system will no longer be predictable. This is most familiar in the case of weather, which is generally predictable only about a week ahead.<ref name="RGW">{{cite book |author=Watts, Robert G. |title=Global Warming and the Future of the Earth |publisher=Morgan & Claypool |year=2007 |page=17 }}</ref> Of course, this does not mean that we cannot say anything about events far in the future; some restrictions on the system are present. With weather, we know that the temperature will never reach 100&nbsp;°C or fall to -130&nbsp;°C on earth, but we are not able to say exactly what day we will have the hottest temperature of the year.

In more mathematical terms, the [[Lyapunov exponent]] measures the sensitivity to initial conditions. Given two starting [[trajectory|trajectories]] in the [[phase space]] that are infinitesimally close, with initial separation <math>\delta \mathbf{Z}_0</math> end up diverging at a rate given by

:<math> | \delta\mathbf{Z}(t) | \approx e^{\lambda t} | \delta \mathbf{Z}_0 |\ </math>

where t is the time and λ is the Lyapunov exponent. The rate of separation depends on the orientation of the initial separation vector, so a whole spectrum of Lyapunov exponents exist. The number of Lyapunov exponents is equal to the number of dimensions of the phase space, though it is common to just refer to the largest one. For example, the maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE) is most often used because it determines the overall predictability of the system. A positive MLE is usually taken as an indication that the system is chaotic.

Also, other properties relate to sensitivity of initial conditions, such as [[Measure (mathematics)|measure-theoretical]] [[Mixing (mathematics)|mixing]] (as discussed in [[ergodicity|ergodic]] theory) and properties of a [[Kolmogorov automorphism|K-system]].<ref name="WerndlCharlotte" />

===Topological mixing===
[[File:Chaos Topological Mixing.png|thumb|The map defined by <span style="white-space: nowrap;">''x'' → 4 ''x'' (1 – ''x'')</span> and <span style="white-space: nowrap;">''y'' → (''x'' + ''y)'' [[Modulo operation|mod]] 1</span> also displays [[topological mixing]]. Here, the blue region is transformed by the dynamics first to the purple region, then to the pink and red regions, and eventually to a cloud of vertical lines scattered across the space.]]
'''[[Topological mixing]]''' (or '''topological transitivity''') means that the system will evolve over time so that any given region or [[open set]] of its [[phase space]] will eventually overlap with any other given region. This mathematical concept of "mixing" corresponds to the standard intuition, and the mixing of colored [[dye]]s or fluids is an example of a chaotic system.

Topological mixing is often omitted from popular accounts of chaos, which equate chaos with only sensitivity to initial conditions. However, sensitive dependence on initial conditions alone does not give chaos. For example, consider the simple dynamical system produced by repeatedly doubling an initial value. This system has sensitive dependence on initial conditions everywhere, since any pair of nearby points will eventually become widely separated. However, this example has no topological mixing, and therefore has no chaos. Indeed, it has extremely simple behavior: all points except 0 will tend to positive or negative infinity.

===Density of periodic orbits===
For a chaotic system to have a [[Dense set|dense]] [[periodic orbit]] means that every point in the space is approached arbitrarily closely by periodic orbits.<ref>{{harvnb|Devaney|2003}}</ref> The one-dimensional [[logistic map]] defined by <span style="white-space: nowrap;">''x'' → 4 ''x'' (1 – ''x'')</span> is one of the simplest systems with density of periodic orbits.  For example, <math>\tfrac{5-\sqrt{5}}{8}</math>&nbsp;→ <math>\tfrac{5+\sqrt{5}}{8}</math>&nbsp;→ <math>\tfrac{5-\sqrt{5}}{8}</math> (or approximately 0.3454915&nbsp;→ 0.9045085&nbsp;→ 0.3454915) is an (unstable) orbit of period 2, and similar orbits exist for periods 4, 8, 16, etc. (indeed, for all the periods specified by [[Sharkovskii's theorem]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Alligood|Sauer|Yorke|1997}}</ref>

Sharkovskii's theorem is the basis of the Li and Yorke<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=T.Y. |last2=Yorke |first2=J.A. |title=Period Three Implies Chaos |journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]] |volume=82 |pages=985–92 |year=1975 |url=http://pb.math.univ.gda.pl/chaos/pdf/li-yorke.pdf |format=PDF |author-link=Tien-Yien Li |doi=10.2307/2318254 |issue=10 |author2-link=James A. Yorke}}</ref> (1975) proof that any one-dimensional system that exhibits a regular cycle of period three will also display regular cycles of every other length, as well as completely chaotic orbits.

===Strange attractors===
[[File:TwoLorenzOrbits.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Lorenz attractor]] displays chaotic behavior.  These two plots demonstrate sensitive dependence on initial conditions within the region of phase space occupied by the attractor.]]
Some dynamical systems, like the one-dimensional [[logistic map]] defined by <span style="white-space: nowrap;">''x'' → 4 ''x'' (1 – ''x''),</span> are chaotic everywhere, but in many cases chaotic behavior is found only in a subset of phase space. The cases of most interest arise when the chaotic behavior takes place on an [[attractor]], since then a large set of initial conditions will lead to orbits that converge to this chaotic region.

An easy way to visualize a chaotic attractor is to start with a point in the [[basin of attraction]] of the attractor, and then simply plot its subsequent orbit. Because of the topological transitivity condition, this is likely to produce a picture of the entire final attractor, and indeed both orbits shown in the figure on the right give a picture of the general shape of the Lorenz attractor.  This attractor results from a simple three-dimensional model of the [[Edward Lorenz|Lorenz]] weather system. The Lorenz attractor is perhaps one of the best-known chaotic system diagrams, probably because it was not only one of the first, but it is also one of the most complex and as such gives rise to a very interesting pattern, that with a little imagination, looks like the wings of a butterfly.

Unlike [[Attractor#Fixed point|fixed-point attractors]] and [[limit cycle]]s, the attractors that arise from chaotic systems, known as [[strange attractor]]s, have great detail and complexity.  Strange attractors occur in both [[continuous function|continuous]] dynamical systems (such as the Lorenz system) and in some [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] systems (such as the [[Hénon map]]). Other discrete dynamical systems have a repelling structure called a [[Julia set]] which forms at the boundary between basins of attraction of fixed points – Julia sets can be thought of as strange repellers. Both strange attractors and Julia sets typically have a [[fractal]] structure, and the [[fractal dimension]] can be calculated for them.

===Minimum complexity of a chaotic system===
[[File:LogisticMap BifurcationDiagram.png|thumb|right|[[Bifurcation diagram]] of the [[logistic map]] <span style="white-space: nowrap;">''x'' → ''r'' ''x'' (1 – ''x'').</span>  Each vertical slice shows the attractor for a specific value of ''r''.  The diagram displays [[Period-doubling bifurcation|period-doubling]] as ''r'' increases, eventually producing chaos.]]

Discrete chaotic systems, such as the logistic map, can exhibit strange attractors whatever their [[dimension]]ality. In contrast, for [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] dynamical systems, the [[Poincaré–Bendixson theorem]] shows that a strange attractor can only arise in three or more dimensions.  [[Dimension (vector space)|Finite-dimensional]] [[linear system]]s are never chaotic; for a dynamical system to display chaotic behavior, it has to be either [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]] or infinite-dimensional.

The [[Poincaré–Bendixson theorem]] states that a two-dimensional differential equation has very regular behavior. The Lorenz attractor discussed above is generated by a system of three [[differential equation]]s such as:
: <math> \begin{align}
\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} &= \sigma y - \sigma x, \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}t} &= \rho x - x z - y, \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\mathrm{d}t} &= x y - \beta z.
\end{align} </math>
where <math>x</math>, <math>y</math>, and <math>z</math> make up the [[State space representation|system state]], <math>t</math> is time, and <math>\sigma</math>, <math>\rho</math>, <math>\beta</math> are the system [[parameter]]s. Five of the terms on the right hand side are linear, while two are quadratic; a total of seven terms. Another well-known chaotic attractor is generated by the [[Rossler map|Rossler equations]] which have only one nonlinear term out of seven. Sprott <ref>{{cite journal|last=Sprott |first=J.C.|year=1997|title=Simplest dissipative chaotic flow|journal=[[Physics Letters A]]|volume=228|issue=4–5 |page=271|doi=10.1016/S0375-9601(97)00088-1|bibcode = 1997PhLA..228..271S }}</ref> found a three-dimensional system with just five terms, that had only one nonlinear term, which exhibits chaos for certain parameter values.

The reason is, simply put, that solutions to such systems are asymptotic to a two-dimensional surface and therefore solutions are well behaved.

While the Poincaré–Bendixson theorem shows that a continuous dynamical system on the Euclidean [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] cannot be chaotic, two-dimensional continuous systems with [[non-Euclidean geometry]] can exhibit chaotic behavior.<ref name="Rosario 2006">{{cite book|last=Rosario|first=Pedro|title=Underdetermination of Science: Part I|date=2006|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=1411693914}}</ref>  Perhaps surprisingly, chaos may occur also in linear systems, provided they are infinite dimensional.<ref>{{cite journal

=== Jerk systems ===
In [[physics]], [[Jerk (physics)|jerk]] is the third derivative of [[position (vector)|position]], and as such, in [[mathematics]] differential equations of the form
:: <math>J\left(\overset{...}{x},\ddot{x},\dot {x},x\right)=0</math>
are sometimes called ''Jerk equations''. It has been shown, that a jerk equation, which is equivalent to a system of three first order, ordinary, non-linear differential equations is in a certain sense the minimal setting for solutions showing chaotic behaviour. This motivates mathematical interest in jerk systems. Systems involving a fourth or higher derivative are called accordingly hyperjerk systems.<ref>K. E. Chlouverakis and J. C. Sprott, Chaos Solitons & Fractals 28, 739-746 (2005), Chaotic Hyperjerk Systems, http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pubs/paper297.htm</ref>

A jerk system's behavior is described by a jerk equation, and for certain jerk equations, simple electronic circuits may be designed which model the solutions to this equation. These circuits are known as jerk circuits.

One of the most interesting properties of jerk circuits is the possibility of chaotic behavior. In fact, certain well-known chaotic systems, such as the Lorenz attractor and the [[Rössler map]], are conventionally described as a system of three first-order differential equations, but which may be combined into a single (although rather complicated) jerk equation. Nonlinear jerk systems are in a sense minimally complex systems to show chaotic behaviour, there is no chaotic system involving only two first-order, ordinary differential equations (the system resulting in an equation of second order only).

An example of a jerk equation with nonlinearity in the magnitude of <math>x</math> is:
:<math>\frac{\mathrm{d}^3 x}{\mathrm{d} t^3}+A\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 x}{\mathrm{d} t^2}+\frac{\mathrm{d} x}{\mathrm{d} t}-|x|+1=0.</math>

Here, ''A'' is an adjustable parameter. This equation has a chaotic solution for ''A''=3/5 and can be implemented with the following jerk circuit; the required nonlinearity is brought about by the two diodes:

[[Image:JerkCircuit01.png|frameless|upright=1.4|center]]

In the above circuit, all resistors are of equal value, except <math>R_A=R/A=5R/3</math>, and all capacitors are of equal size. The dominant frequency will be <math>1/2\pi R C</math>. The output of [[operational amplifier|op amp]] 0 will correspond to the x variable, the output of 1 will correspond to the first derivative of x and the output of 2 will correspond to the second derivative.

==Spontaneous order==
Under the right conditions, chaos will spontaneously evolve into a lockstep pattern. In the [[Kuramoto model]], four conditions suffice to produce synchronization in a chaotic system.
Examples include the [[coupled oscillation]] of [[Christiaan Huygens]]' pendulums, fireflies, [[neuron]]s, the [[London Millenium Bridge]] resonance, and large arrays of [[Josephson junctions]].<ref>Steven Strogatz, ''Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order'', Hyperion, 2003.</ref>

An early proponent of chaos theory was [[Henri Poincaré]]. In the 1880s, while studying the [[three-body problem]], he found that there can be orbits that are nonperiodic, and yet not forever increasing nor approaching a fixed point.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Poincaré, Jules Henri |title=Sur le problème des trois corps et les équations de la dynamique.

Despite initial insights in the first half of the twentieth century, chaos theory became formalized as such only after mid-century, when it first became evident to some scientists that [[linear theory]], the prevailing system theory at that time, simply could not explain the observed behavior of certain experiments like that of the [[logistic map]]. What had been attributed to measure imprecision and simple "[[Pseudorandom noise|noise]]" was considered by chaos theorists as a full component of the studied systems.

The main catalyst for the development of chaos theory was the electronic computer. Much of the mathematics of chaos theory involves the repeated [[iteration]] of simple mathematical formulas, which would be impractical to do by hand. Electronic computers made these repeated calculations practical, while figures and images made it possible to visualize these systems. As a graduate student in [[Chihiro Hayashi]]'s laboratory at Kyoto University, [[Yoshisuke Ueda]] was experimenting with analog computers and noticed, on Nov. 27, 1961, what he called "randomly transitional phenomena".  Yet his advisor did not agree with his conclusions at the time, and did not allow him to report his findings until 1970.<ref>{{harvnb|Abraham|Ueda|2001|loc=See Chapters 3 and 4}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Sprott|2003|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=SEDjdjPZ158C&pg=PA89 89]}}</ref>

To his surprise the weather that the machine began to predict was completely different from the weather calculated before. Lorenz tracked this down to the computer printout. The computer worked with 6-digit precision, but the printout rounded variables off to a 3-digit number, so a value like 0.506127 was printed as 0.506. This difference is tiny and the consensus at the time would have been that it should have had practically no effect. However, Lorenz had discovered that small changes in initial conditions produced large changes in the long-term outcome.<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Chaos: Making a New Science]] |last=Gleick |first=James |year=1987 |publisher=Cardinal |location=London|page=17|isbn=0-434-29554-X}}</ref> Lorenz's discovery, which gave its name to [[Lorenz attractor]]s, showed that even detailed atmospheric modelling cannot, in general, make precise long-term weather predictions.

In December 1977, the [[New York Academy of Sciences]] organized the first symposium on Chaos, attended by David Ruelle, [[Robert May, Baron May of Oxford|Robert May]], [[James A. Yorke]] (coiner of the term "chaos" as used in mathematics), [[Robert Shaw (physicist)|Robert Shaw]], and the meteorologist Edward Lorenz. The following year, independently [[Pierre Coullet]] and [[Charles Tresser]] with the article "Iterations d'endomorphismes et groupe de renormalisation" and [[Mitchell Feigenbaum]] with the article "Quantitative Universality for a Class of Nonlinear Transformations" described logistic maps.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Mitchell |last=Feigenbaum |title=Quantitative universality for a class of nonlinear transformations |journal=Journal of Statistical Physics |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=25–52 |date=July 1978 |doi=10.1007/BF01020332 |bibcode=1978JSP....19...25F}}</ref><ref>Coullet, Pierre, and Charles Tresser.

In 1979, [[Albert J. Libchaber]], during a symposium organized in Aspen by [[Pierre Hohenberg]], presented his experimental observation of the [[Bifurcation theory|bifurcation]] cascade that leads to chaos and turbulence in [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection]] systems.

Feigenbaum]] for their inspiring achievements.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.wolffund.org.il/cat.asp?id=25&cat_title=PHYSICS|title = The Wolf Prize in Physics in 1986.}}</ref>

In 1986, the New York Academy of Sciences co-organized with the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] and the [[Office of Naval Research]] the first important conference on chaos in biology and medicine. There, [[Bernardo Huberman]] presented a mathematical model of the [[eye tracking disorder]] among [[schizophrenics]].<ref>{{cite journal |authorlink=Bernardo Huberman |author=Huberman, B.A. |title=A Model for Dysfunctions in Smooth Pursuit Eye Movement |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=504 Perspectives in Biological Dynamics and Theoretical Medicine |pages=260–273 |date=July 1987 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1987.tb48737.x |bibcode = 1987NYASA.504..260H }}</ref> This led to a renewal of [[physiology]] in the 1980s through the application of chaos theory, for example, in the study of pathological [[cardiac cycle]]s.

In 1987, [[Per Bak]], [[Chao Tang]] and [[Kurt Wiesenfeld]] published a paper in ''[[Physical Review Letters]]''<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bak, Per; Tang, Chao; Wiesenfeld, Kurt |title=Self-organized criticality: An explanation of the 1/f noise |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=381–4 |date=27 July 1987 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.59.381 |bibcode=1987PhRvL..59..381B|last2=Tang |last3=Wiesenfeld }} However, the conclusions of this article have been subject to dispute. {{cite web |url=http://www.nslij-genetics.org/wli/1fnoise/1fnoise_square.html |title=? |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}.

Alongside largely lab-based approaches such as the [[Bak–Tang–Wiesenfeld sandpile]], many other investigations have focused on large-scale natural or social systems that are known (or suspected) to display [[scale invariance|scale-invariant]] behavior. Although these approaches were not always welcomed (at least initially) by specialists in the subjects examined, SOC has nevertheless become established as a strong candidate for explaining a number of natural phenomena, including [[earthquake]]s (which, long before SOC was discovered, were known as a source of scale-invariant behavior such as the [[Gutenberg–Richter law]] describing the statistical distribution of earthquake sizes, and the [[Aftershock|Omori law]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Omori, F. |title=On the aftershocks of earthquakes |journal=Journal of the College of Science, Imperial University of Tokyo |volume=7 |pages=111–200 |year=1894 }}</ref> describing the frequency of aftershocks), [[solar flare]]s, fluctuations in economic systems such as [[financial market]]s (references to SOC are common in [[econophysics]]), [[landscape formation]], [[forest fire]]s, [[landslide]]s, [[epidemic]]s, and [[biological evolution]] (where SOC has been invoked, for example, as the dynamical mechanism behind the theory of "[[punctuated equilibrium|punctuated equilibria]]" put forward by [[Niles Eldredge]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]]). Given the implications of a scale-free distribution of event sizes, some researchers have suggested that another phenomenon that should be considered an example of SOC is the occurrence of [[war]]s. These investigations of SOC have included both attempts at modelling (either developing new models or adapting existing ones to the specifics of a given natural system), and extensive data analysis to determine the existence and/or characteristics of natural scaling laws.

In the same year, [[James Gleick]] published ''[[Chaos: Making a New Science]]'', which became a best-seller and introduced the general principles of chaos theory as well as its history to the broad public, though his history under-emphasized important Soviet contributions.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gleick|first=James|title=Chaos: Making a New Science|date=August 26, 2008|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=0143113453}}</ref> Initially the domain of a few, isolated individuals, chaos theory progressively emerged as a transdisciplinary and institutional discipline, mainly under the name of [[nonlinear system]]s analysis. Alluding to [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s concept of a [[paradigm shift]] exposed in ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962), many "chaologists" (as some described themselves) claimed that this new theory was an example of such a shift, a thesis upheld by Gleick.

The availability of cheaper, more powerful computers broadens the applicability of chaos theory. Currently, chaos theory continues to be a very active area of research,<ref>Motter A. E. and  Campbell D. K., [http://www.physicstoday.org/resource/1/phtoad/v66/i5/p27_s1?bypassSSO=1 Chaos at fifty], Phys.

==Distinguishing random from chaotic data==
It can be difficult to tell from data whether a physical or other observed process is random or chaotic, because in practice no [[time series]] consists of a pure "signal". There will always be some form of corrupting noise, even if it is present as round-off or truncation error. Thus any real time series, even if mostly deterministic, will contain some (pseudo-)randomness.<ref name=prov>{{cite journal |author=Provenzale, A. |title=Distinguishing between low-dimensional dynamics and randomness in measured time-series |journal=Physica D |volume=58 |pages=31–49 |year=1992 |doi=10.1016/0167-2789(92)90100-2 |bibcode = 1992PhyD...58...31P |last2=Smith |last3=Vio |last4=Murante |display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Brock, W.A. |title=Distinguishing random and deterministic systems: Abridged version |journal=[[Journal of Economic Theory]] |volume=40 |pages=168–195 |date=October 1986 |doi=10.1016/0022-0531(86)90014-1 }}</ref>

All methods for distinguishing deterministic and [[stochastic processes]] rely on the fact that a deterministic system always evolves in the same way from a given starting point.<ref name=prov /><ref>{{cite journal | author = Sugihara G., May R. | year = 1990 | title = Nonlinear forecasting as a way of distinguishing chaos from measurement error in time series | url = http://deepeco.ucsd.edu/~george/publications/90_nonlinear_forecasting.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Nature | volume = 344 | issue = 6268| pages = 734–741 |doi=10.1038/344734a0 | pmid = 2330029|bibcode = 1990Natur.344..734S | last2 = May }}</ref> Thus, given a time series to test for determinism, one can
# pick a test [[State space representation|state]];
# search the time series for a similar or nearby state; and
# compare their respective [[time evolution]]s.

Define the error as the difference between the time evolution of the test state and the time evolution of the nearby state. A [[deterministic system]] will have an error that either remains small (stable, regular solution) or increases exponentially with time (chaos). A stochastic system will have a randomly distributed error.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Casdagli |first=Martin |title=Chaos and Deterministic ''versus'' Stochastic Non-linear Modelling |journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=303–328 |year=1991 |jstor=2346130}}</ref>

Essentially, all measures of determinism taken from time series rely upon finding the closest states to a given test state (e.g., correlation dimension, Lyapunov exponents, etc.). To define the state of a system, one typically relies on [[phase space]] embedding methods such as [[Poincaré plot]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Broomhead, D.S.; King, G.P. |title=Extracting qualitative dynamics from experimental data |journal=Physica D |volume=20 |issue=2–3 |pages=217–236 |date=June–July 1986 |doi=10.1016/0167-2789(86)90031-X |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016727898690031X|bibcode = 1986PhyD...20..217B |last2=King }}</ref>
Typically one chooses an embedding dimension and investigates the propagation of the error between two nearby states. If the error looks random, one increases the dimension. If the dimension can be increased to obtain a deterministically looking error, then analysis is done. Though it may sound simple, one complication is that as the dimension increases, the search for a nearby state requires a lot more computation time and a lot of data (the amount of data required increases exponentially with embedding dimension) to find a suitably close candidate. If the embedding dimension (number of measures per state) is chosen too small (less than the "true" value), deterministic data can appear to be random, but in theory there is no problem choosing the dimension too large – the method will work.

When a [[Nonlinear system|nonlinear]] deterministic system is attended by external fluctuations, its trajectories present serious and permanent distortions. Furthermore, the noise is amplified due to the inherent nonlinearity and reveals totally new dynamical properties. Statistical tests attempting to separate noise from the deterministic skeleton or inversely isolate the deterministic part risk failure. Things become worse when the deterministic component is a nonlinear feedback system.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kyrtsou C | year = 2008 | title = Re-examining the sources of heteroskedasticity: the paradigm of noisy chaotic models | journal = Physica A | volume = 387 | issue = 27| pages = 6785–9 | doi = 10.1016/j.physa.2008.09.008 |bibcode = 2008PhyA..387.6785K }}</ref> In presence of interactions between nonlinear deterministic components and noise, the resulting nonlinear series can display dynamics that traditional tests for nonlinearity are sometimes not able to capture.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kyrtsou, C. |title=Evidence for neglected linearity in noisy chaotic models |journal=International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos |volume=15 |issue=10 |pages=3391–4 |year=2005 |doi=10.1142/S0218127405013964 |bibcode = 2005IJBC...15.3391K }}</ref>

[[File:BML N=200 P=32.png|400px|right|The red cars and blue cars take turns to move; the red ones only move upwards, and the blue ones move rightwards. Every time, all the cars of the same colour try to move one step if there is no car in front of it. Here, the model has self-organized in a somewhat geometric pattern where there are some traffic jams and some areas where cars can move at top speed.]]

It is possible that economic models can also be improved through an application of chaos theory, but predicting the health of an economic system and what factors influence it most is an extremely complex task.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Juárez|first=Fernando|title=Applying the theory of chaos and a complex model of health to establish relations among financial indicators|journal=Procedia Computer Science|year=2011|volume=3|pages=982–986|doi=10.1016/j.procs.2010.12.161}}</ref> Economic and financial systems are fundamentally different from those in the physical and natural sciences since the former are inherently stochastic in nature, as they result from the interactions of people, and thus pure deterministic models are unlikely to provide accurate representations of the data. The empirical literature that tests for chaos in economics and finance presents very mixed results, in part due to confusion between specific tests for chaos and more general tests for non-linear relationships.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Brooks |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Brooks (academic)|title=Chaos in foreign exchange markets: a sceptical view |journal=Computational Economics|year=1998 |volume=11 |pages=265–281 |ISSN=1572-9974 |doi=10.1023/A:1008650024944}}</ref>

Traffic forecasting is another area that greatly benefits from applications of chaos theory. Better predictions of when traffic will occur would allow measures to be taken for it to be dispersed before the traffic starts, rather than after. Combining chaos theory principles with a few other methods has led to a more accurate short-term prediction model (see the plot of the BML traffic model at right).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Jin|author2=Qixin Shi|title=Short-term traffic speed forecasting hybrid model based on Chaos–Wavelet Analysis-Support Vector Machine theory|journal=Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies|date=February 2013|volume=27|pages=219–232|doi=10.1016/j.trc.2012.08.004}}</ref>

Chaos theory also finds applications in psychology. For example, in modeling group behavior in which heterogeneous members may behave as if sharing to different degrees what in [[Wilfred Bion]]'s theory is a  basic assumption, the group dynamics is the result of the individual dynamics of the members: each individual reproduces the group dynamics in a different scale, and the chaotic behavior of the group is reflected in each member.<ref name="Dal FornoMerlone2013">{{cite journal | last1 = Dal Forno | first1 = Arianna | last2 = Merlone | first2 = Ugo | title = Nonlinear dynamics in work groups with Bion's basic assumptions | journal = Nonlinear Dynamics, Psychology, and Life Sciences | volume = 17| issue=2 | year = 2013 | pages = 295–315 | issn = 1090-0578  }}</ref>
