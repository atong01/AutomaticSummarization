==Career==

===Early work in outliners===
In 1979 Dave Winer became an employee of [[Personal Software]], where he worked on his own product idea named VisiText, which was his first attempt to build a commercial product around an "expand and collapse" outline display<ref name=apple-bluff>{{Cite news | last = Swaine | first = Michael | authorlink = Michael Swaine (author) | title = Calling Apple's Bluff | work = Dr. Dobb's | accessdate = 2009-06-08 | date = 1991-09-01 | url = http://www.ddj.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=184408623 }}</ref> and which ultimately established [[outliner]]s as a software product. In 1981 he left the company and founded [[Living Videotext]] to develop this still-unfinished product. The company was based in [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]], [[California|CA]], and grew to more than 50 employees.<ref name=apple-bluff />

ThinkTank, which was based on VisiText, was released in 1983 for [[Apple II series|Apple II]] and was promoted as an "idea processor."<ref>{{Cite news

===Years at UserLand===
{{main|UserLand Software}}

Winer founded [[Userland Software]] in 1988<ref name=outliners-and-programming /> and served as the company's CEO until 2002.

UserLand's original flagship product, [[Userland Software#Frontier|Frontier]], was a system-level [[scripting language|scripting]] environment for the [[Macintosh|Mac]],  Winer's pioneering weblog, ''Scripting News'', takes its name from this early interest. Frontier was an outliner-based scripting language, echoing Winer's longstanding interest in outliners and anticipating code-folding editors of the late 1990s.
Winer became interested in web publishing while helping automate the production process of the strikers' online newspaper during San Francisco's [[San Francisco newspaper strike of 1994|newspaper strike]] of November 1994,<ref name="rosenberg-everything-50" /> According to [[Newsweek]], through this experience, he "revolutionized Net publishing."<ref>{{Cite news|title=50 For The Future |work=Newsweek |accessdate=2009-05-10 |date=1995-02-27 |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/106555/output/print |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20111018120302/http://www.newsweek.com/id/106555/output/print |archivedate=18 October 2011 }}</ref> Winer subsequently shifted the company's focus to online publishing products, enthusiastically promoting and experimenting with these products while building his websites and developing new features. One of these products was [[Userland Software#Frontier|Frontier]]'s NewsPage Suite of 1997, which supported the publication of Winer's ''Scripting News'' and was adopted by a handful of users who "began playing around with their own sites in the Scripting News vein."<ref name="rosenberg-everything-59" /> These users included notably [[Chris Gulker]] and [[Jorn Barger]], who envisaged [[blog]]ging as a [[social networking service|networked]] practice among users of the software.<ref>{{Cite conference| publisher = ACM| doi = 10.1145/1557914.1557962| isbn = 978-1-60558-486-7| pages = 279–288| last = Ammann| first = Rudolf| title = Jorn Barger, the NewsPage network and the emergence of the weblog community| booktitle = Proceedings of the 20th ACM conference on hypertext and hypermedia| location = Torino, Italy| accessdate = 2009-07-15| year = 2009| url = http://tawawa.org/ark/p/jorn-barger-community.html}}</ref>

In 1997 Winer was appointed advisor to [[Seybold Seminars]] due to his "pioneering work in web-based publishing systems."<ref>{{cite web| title = The Seybold Institute| work = Seybold Seminars| accessdate = 2010-05-23| year = 1997| url = http://www.seyboldseminars.com/News/fellows.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19971018032643/http://www.seyboldseminars.com/News/fellows.html |archivedate=1997-10-18}}</ref> Keen to enter the "competitive arena of high-end Web development,"<ref>{{Cite news|last=Morgenstern |first=David |work=MacWeek |title=Frontier blazing Internet trail |accessdate=2010-05-31 |date=1998-06-26 |url=macweek.zdnet.com/1224-0627/nw_frontier.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20030701201326/http://macweek.zdnet.com:80/1224-0627/nw_frontier.html |archivedate=1 July 2003 }}</ref> Winer then came to collaborate with [[Microsoft]] and jointly developed the [[XML-RPC]] protocol. This led to the creation of [[Simple Object Access Protocol|SOAP]], which he co-authored with [[Microsoft]]'s [[Don Box]], Bob Atkinson, and Mohsen Al-Ghosein.

In December 1997, acting on the desire to "offer much more timely information,"<ref>{{Cite news| last = Gillmor| first = Dan| title = Small portals prove that size matters| work = San Jose Mercury News| date = 1998-12-06| accessdate = 2010-07-20| url = http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen/focus/DanGillmor19981206.htm}}</ref> Winer designed and implemented an [[XML]] syndication format for use on his ''Scripting News'' weblog,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tim.oreilly.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html?page=3 |title=Blogging and the Wisdom of Crowds |author=Tim O'Reilly |publisher=O'Reilly and Associates |date=2005-09-30 |accessdate=2007-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20060518113913/http://tim.oreilly.com:80/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html?page=3 |archivedate=18 May 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scripting.com/davenet/1997/12/15/scriptingNewsInXML.html |title=Scripting News in XML |author=Winer, Dave |date=1997-12-15 |publisher=[[Scripting News]] |accessdate=2006-10-31 }}</ref> thus making an early contribution to the [[history of web syndication technology]]. By December 2000, competing dialects of [[RSS]] included several varieties of [[Netscape]]'s RSS, Winer's RSS 0.92, and an [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]-based RSS 1.0. Winer continued to develop the branch of the RSS fork originating from RSS 0.92, releasing in 2002 a version called RSS 2.0.<ref>[http://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/rss2.html RSS 2.0 specification<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Winer's advocacy of web syndication in general and RSS 2.0 in particular convinced many news organizations to syndicate their news content in that format.<ref>{{cite news | first=Margaret | last=Kanes |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1032-993344.html	 |title=Old data update tool gains new converts	 |publisher=CNET News	 |date=March 20, 2003	 |accessdate=2007-01-26}}</ref> For example, in early 2002 the [[New York Times]] entered an agreement with UserLand to syndicate many of their articles in RSS 2.0 format.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=105317&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=593901 	 |title=NYTimes.com Expands Its RSS Feeds to 27 Categories	 |publisher=New York Times (press release)	 |date=July 20, 2004	 |accessdate=2007-01-26}}</ref> Winer resisted calls by technologists to have the shortcomings of RSS 2.0 improved. Instead, he froze the format and turned its ownership over to [[Harvard University]].<ref>{{Cite news| last = Festa| first = Paul| title = Dispute exposes bitter power struggle behind Web logs| work = CNET News| date = 2003-08-04| url = http://news.cnet.com/Battle-of-the-blog/2009-1032_3-5059006.html}}</ref>

With products and services based on UserLand's [[Userland Software#Frontier|Frontier]] system, Winer became a leader in [[blog]]ging tools from 1999 onwards,<ref>{{Cite book| last = Gillmor| first = Dan| title = We the Media: Grassroots Journalism by the People, for the People| chapter = The Read-Write Web| accessdate = 2010-05-31| year = 2004| chapterurl = http://authorama.com/we-the-media-3.html}}</ref> as well as a "leading evangelist of weblogs."<ref name=almost-famous />  In 2000 Winer developed the Outline Processor Markup Language [[OPML]], an [[XML]] format for [[Outline (summary)|outlines]], which originally served as the native file format for [[Radio UserLand]]'s [[outliner]] application and has since been adopted for other uses, the most common being to exchange lists of [[web feeds]] between web [[feed aggregator]]s. UserLand was the first to add an "enclosure" tag in its RSS, modifying its blog software and its aggregator so that bloggers could easily link to an audio file (see  [[podcast]]ing and [[history of podcasting]]).

In February 2002 Winer was named one of the "Top Ten Technology Innovators" by [[InfoWorld]].<ref>{{cite web| last = Udell| first = Jon| title = Top ten technology innovators: Dave Winer| work = Infoworld| accessdate = 2009-05-13| date = 2002-02-27| url = http://www.infoworld.com/articles/fe/xml/02/03/04/020304fewiner.html |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20041104022339/http://www.infoworld.com/articles/fe/xml/02/03/04/020304fewiner.html |archivedate = 2004-11-04}}</ref>

In June 2002 Winer underwent life-saving [[coronary artery bypass surgery|bypass surgery]]<ref>{{cite news|title=And the winner is ...|first= Steve |last=Gillmor|date= January 3, 2003|accessdate=May 2, 2012 |url=http://www.infoworld.com/print/9167|work=InfoWorld}}</ref> to prevent a heart attack and as a consequence stepped down as CEO of [[UserLand Software|UserLand]] shortly after.<ref>{{cite web | last = Winer | first = Dave | title = An untold story of UserLand | work = Scripting News | accessdate = 2008-08-08 | date = 2007-03-12 | url = http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/03/12/anUntoldStoryOfUserland.html}}</ref> He remained the firm's majority shareholder, however, and claimed personal ownership of [[Weblogs.com]].

===Weblogs.com===
{{main|Weblogs.com}}
Weblogs.com provided a free [[ping-server]] used by many [[weblog|blogging]] applications, as well as free hosting to many bloggers.
