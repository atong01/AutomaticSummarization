The musicologist and author Graham Wade writes:</paragraph><paragraph><extension extension_name='blockquote'><italics>Nowadays it is customary to play this repertoire on reproductions of instruments authentically modelled on concepts of musicological research with appropriate adjustments to techniques and overall interpretation. Thus over recent decades we have become accustomed to specialist artists with expertise in the art of vihuela (a 16th-century type of guitar popular in Spain), lute, Baroque guitar, 19th-century guitar, etc.<extension extension_name='ref' name="visee"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code</arg><arg name="title"><space/>SEGOVIA, Andres: 1950s American Recordings, Vol. 4</arg><arg name="publisher">Graham Wade</arg></template></extension></italics></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Different types of guitars have different sound aesthetics, e.g. different colour-spectrum characteristics (the way the sound energy is spread in the fundamental frequency and the<space/><link><target>overtones</target></link>), different response, etc. These differences are due to differences in construction, for example modern classical guitars usually use a different bracing (fan-bracing), than was used in earlier guitars (they had ladder-bracing); and a different voicing was used by the luthier.</paragraph><paragraph>It is interesting to note the historical parallel between musical styles (baroque, classical, romantic, flamenco, jazz) and the style of &quot;sound aesthetic&quot; of the musical instruments used, for example:<space/><link><target>Robert de Vise</target></link><space/>played on a baroque guitar with a very different sound aesthetic than the guitars used by<space/><link><target>Mauro Giuliani</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Luigi Legnani</target><part>Legnani</part></link><space/>- they used 19th century guitars. These guitars in turn sound different from the Torres models used by Segovia, that are suited for interpretations of romantic-modern works such as<space/><link><target>Federico Moreno Torroba</target><part>Moreno Torroba</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>When considering the guitar from a historical perspective, the musical instrument used is just as important as the musical language and style of the particular period. As an example: It is impossible to play a historically informed<space/><link><target>Robert de Vise</target><part>de Visee</part></link><space/>or Corbetta (baroque guitarist-composers) on a modern classical guitar. The reason is that the baroque guitar used courses, which are two strings close together (in unison), that are plucked together. This gives baroque guitars an unmistakable sound characteristic and tonal texture that is an integral part of an interpretation. Additionally the sound aesthetic of the baroque guitar (with its strong overtone presence) is very different from modern classical type guitars, as is shown below.</paragraph><paragraph>Today's use of Torres and post-Torres type guitars for repertoire of all periods is sometimes critically viewed: Torres and post-Torres style modern guitars (with their fan-bracing and design) have a thick and strong tone, very suitable for modern-era repertoire. However, they are considered to emphasize the fundamental too heavily (at the expense of overtone partials) for earlier repertoire (Classical/Romantic: Carulli, Sor, Giuliani, Mertz,&amp;nbsp;...; Baroque: de Visee,&amp;nbsp;...; etc.).<space/><italics>&quot;Andrs Segovia presented the Spanish guitar as a versatile model for all playing styles&quot;</italics>,<extension extension_name='ref' name="earlyromanticguitar.com"></extension><space/>to the extent, that still today,<space/><italics>&quot;many guitarists have tunnel-vision of the world of the guitar, coming from the modern Segovia tradition&quot;</italics>.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.earlyromanticguitar.com/erg/periodtechnique.htm'>Early Romantic Guitar Period Technique</link><space/>by earlyromanticguitar.com</extension></paragraph><paragraph>While fan-braced modern classical Torres and post-Torres style instruments coexisted with traditional ladder-braced guitars at the beginning of the 20th century; the traditional forms eventually fell away.

Miguel Llobet, Andrés Segovia and Julian Bream are the three performer personalities of the 20th century. Do not understand me wrong, we have many guitarists today that are very excellent performers, but none with such a distinct personality in their tone and style as Llobet, Segovia and Bream. In all instrumental areas, not just the guitar, there is a lack of individualism with a strong tendency to conformity. This I find very unfortunate since art (music, theatre or the pictorial arts) is a very individual and personal matter.<ref>{{cite web|url">http://www.v4m.net/GuitarFestivalRust/Interviews/InterviewBernardHebb.htm|title</arg><arg>Bernard Hebb</arg><arg>Interview</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>History</heading><paragraph><template><target>multiple image</target><arg name="direction">vertical<space/></arg><arg name="width">200

It has a high sound and is rather large to hold.

It is flat or slightly curved. The curvature of the fretboard is measured by the fretboard radius, which is the radius of a hypothetical circle of which the fretboard's surface constitutes a segment. The smaller the fretboard radius, the more noticeably curved the fretboard is. Fretboards are most commonly made of<space/><link><target>ebony</target></link>, but may also be made of<space/><link><target>Rosewood (timber)</target><part>rosewood</part></link><space/>or of phenolic composite (&quot;micarta&quot;).</paragraph><heading level='4'>Frets</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Fret</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Frets are the metal strips (usually nickel alloy or stainless steel) embedded along the<space/><link><target>fingerboard</target></link><space/>and placed at points that divide the length of string mathematically. The strings' vibrating length is determined when the strings are pressed down behind the frets. Each fret produces a different pitch and each pitch spaced a half-step apart on the 12 tone scale. The<space/><link><target>ratio</target></link><space/>of the widths of two consecutive frets is the<space/><link><target>twelfth root of two</target></link><space/>(<extension extension_name='math'>\sqrt[12]{2}</extension>), whose numeric value is about 1.059463. The twelfth fret divides the string in two exact halves and the 24th fret (if present) divides the string in half yet again. Every twelve frets represents one octave. This arrangement of frets results in<space/><link><target>equal temperament</target><part>equal tempered</part></link><space/>tuning.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Neck</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Guitar neck</arg></template><template><target>see also</target><arg>Guitar strings</arg></template>A classical guitar's frets, fretboard, tuners, headstock, all attached to a long wooden extension, collectively constitute its<space/><link><target>neck (music)</target><part>neck</part></link>. The wood for the fretboard usually differs from the wood in the rest of the neck. The bending stress on the neck is considerable, particularly when heavier gauge strings are used.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Neck joint or 'heel'</heading><paragraph>This is the point where the neck meets the body. In the traditional Spanish neck joint the neck and block are one piece with the sides inserted into slots cut in the block. Other necks are built separately and joined to the body either with a dovetail joint, mortise or flush joint. These joints are usually glued and can be reinforced with mechanical fasteners. Recently many manufacturers use bolt on fasteners. Bolt on neck joints were once associated only with less expensive instruments but now some top manufacturers and hand builders are using variations of this method. Some people believed that the Spanish style one piece neck/block and glued dovetail necks have better sustain, but testing has failed to confirm this.While most traditional Spanish style builders use the one piece neck/heel block, Fleta, a prominent Spanish builder, used a dovetail joint due to the influence of his early training in violin making.One reason for the introduction of the mechanical joints was to make it easier to repair necks. This is more of a problem with steel string guitars than with nylon strings, which have about half the string tension. This is why nylon string guitars often don't include a truss rod either.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Body</heading><paragraph>The body of the instrument is a major determinant of the overall sound variety for acoustic guitars. The guitar top, or soundboard, is a finely crafted and engineered element often made of<space/><link><target>spruce</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Thuja plicata</target><part>red cedar</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Sequoia sempervirens</target><part>redwood</part></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>mahogany</target></link>. This thin (often 2 or 3&amp;nbsp;mm thick) piece of wood, strengthened by different types of internal bracing, is considered the most prominent factor in determining the sound quality of a guitar. The majority of the sound is caused by vibration of the guitar top as the energy of the vibrating strings is transferred to it. Different patterns of wood bracing have been used through the years by luthiers (<link><target>Antonio Torres Jurado</target><part>Torres</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Hermann Hauser Sr.</target><part>Hauser</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Jos Ramrez (luthier)</target><part>Ramrez</part></link>, Fleta, and<space/><link><target>C.F. Martin &amp; Company</target><part>C.F. Martin</part></link><space/>being among the most influential designers of their times); to not only strengthen the top against collapsing under the tremendous stress exerted by the tensioned strings, but also to affect the resonation of the top. Some contemporary guitar makers have introduced new construction concepts such as &quot;double-top&quot; consisting of two extra-thin wooden plates separated by<space/><link><target>Nomex</target></link>, or carbon-fiber reinforced lattice - pattern bracing. The back and sides are made out of a variety of woods such as mahogany, Indian<space/><link><target>rosewood</target></link><space/>and highly regarded Brazilian rosewood (<italics>Dalbergia nigra</italics>). Each one is chosen for its aesthetic effect and structural strength, and such choice can also play a significant role in determining the instrument's<space/><link><target>timbre</target></link>. These are also strengthened with internal bracing, and decorated with inlays and purfling.</paragraph><paragraph>The body of a classical guitar is a resonating chamber that projects the vibrations of the body through a<space/><italics>sound hole</italics>, allowing the acoustic guitar to be heard without amplification. The sound hole is normally a single round hole in the top of the guitar (under the strings), though some have different placement, shapes, or numbers of holes. How much air an instrument can move determines its maximum volume.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Binding, purfling and kerfing</heading><paragraph>The top, back and sides of a classical guitar body are very thin, so a flexible piece of wood called<space/><italics>kerfing</italics><space/>(because it is often scored, or<space/><italics>kerfed</italics><space/>so it bends with the shape of the rim) is glued into the corners where the rim meets the top and back. This interior reinforcement provides 5 to 20&amp;nbsp;mm of solid gluing area for these corner joints.</paragraph><paragraph>During final construction, a small section of the outside corners is carved or routed out and filled with binding material on the outside corners and decorative strips of material next to the binding, which are called<space/><italics><link><target>purfling</target></link></italics>. This binding serves to seal off the<space/><link><target>endgrain</target></link><space/>of the top and back. Binding and purfling materials are generally made of either wood or high quality plastic materials.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Bridge</heading><paragraph>The main purpose of the bridge on a classical guitar is to transfer the vibration from the strings to the soundboard, which vibrates the air inside of the guitar, thereby amplifying the sound produced by the strings. The bridge holds the strings in place on the body. Also, the position of the saddle, usually a strip of bone or plastic that supports the strings off the bridge, determines the distance to the nut (at the top of the fingerboard).</paragraph><heading level='3'>Sizes</heading><paragraph>The modern full size classical guitar has a<space/><link><target>Scale (string instruments)</target><part>scale length</part></link><extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.hago.org.uk/faqs/scale-length.php'>Guitar scale length</link><space/>Hampshire guitar orchestra</extension><space/>of around 650&amp;nbsp;mm (25.6&amp;nbsp;inches), with an overall instrument length of 9651016&amp;nbsp;mm (38-40&amp;nbsp;inches). The scale length has remained quite consistent since it was chosen by the originator of the instrument,<space/><link><target>Antonio Torres Jurado</target><part>Antonio de Torres</part></link>. This length may have been chosen because it's twice the length of a violin string. As the guitar is tuned to one octave below that of the violin, the same size gut could be used for the first strings of both instruments.</paragraph><paragraph>Smaller-scale instruments are produced to assist children in learning the instrument as the smaller scale leads to the frets being closer together, making it easier for smaller hands. The scale-size for the smaller guitars is usually in the range 484578&amp;nbsp;mm (19-22.5&amp;nbsp;inches), with an instrument length of 785915&amp;nbsp;mm (31-36&amp;nbsp;inches).

One of the tunings from the 16th century is C-F-A-D. This is equivalent to the top four strings of the modern guitar tuned a tone lower. However, the absolute pitch for these notes is not equivalent to modern &quot;concert pitch&quot;. The tuning of the four-course guitar was moved up by a tone and toward the end of the 16th century, five-course instruments were in use with an added lower string tuned to A. This produced A-D-G-B-E, one of a wide number of variant tunings of the period. The low E string was added during the 18th century.''&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>Richard Chapman, &quot;The New Complete Guitarist&quot;, p. 10 left</extension></paragraph><table class="wikitable"><tablerow><tablehead>String</tablehead><tablehead><link><target>Scientific pitch notation</target><part>Sci. pitch</part></link></tablehead><tablehead><link><target>Helmholtz pitch notation</target><part>Helmholtz pitch</part></link></tablehead><tablehead><link><target>Interval (music)</target><part>Interval</part></link><space/>from<space/><link><target>middle C</target></link></tablehead><tablehead>Semitones from<space/><link><target>A440 (pitch standard)</target><part>A440</part></link></tablehead><tablehead><link><target>Frequency</target><part>Freq.</part></link>, if using an<space/><link><target>Equal temperament</target><part>Equal temperament tuning</part></link><space/>(using<space/><link><target>Twelfth root of two</target><part><extension extension_name='math'>\sqrt[12]{2} = 2^{(\frac{1}{12})}</extension></part></link>)</tablehead></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell>1st (highest pitch)</tablecell><tablecell>E<xhtml:sub>4</xhtml:sub></tablecell><tablecell>e'</tablecell><tablecell><link><target>major third</target></link><space/>above</tablecell><tablecell>-5</tablecell><tablecell><extension extension_name='math'>440 \rm{ Hz}\cdot (\sqrt[12]{2})^{-5} \approx<space/></extension><space/><bold>329.63&amp;nbsp;Hz</bold></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell>2nd</tablecell><tablecell>B<xhtml:sub>3</xhtml:sub></tablecell><tablecell>b</tablecell><tablecell><link><target>minor second</target></link><space/>below</tablecell><tablecell>-10</tablecell><tablecell><extension extension_name='math'>440 \rm{ Hz}\cdot (\sqrt[12]{2})^{-10} \approx<space/></extension><space/><bold>246.94&amp;nbsp;Hz</bold></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell>3rd</tablecell><tablecell>G<xhtml:sub>3</xhtml:sub></tablecell><tablecell>g</tablecell><tablecell><link><target>perfect fourth</target></link><space/>below</tablecell><tablecell>-14</tablecell><tablecell><extension extension_name='math'>440 \rm{ Hz}\cdot (\sqrt[12]{2})^{-14} \approx<space/></extension><space/><bold>196.00&amp;nbsp;Hz</bold></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell>4th</tablecell><tablecell>D<xhtml:sub>3</xhtml:sub></tablecell><tablecell>d</tablecell><tablecell><link><target>minor seventh</target></link><space/>below</tablecell><tablecell>-19</tablecell><tablecell><extension extension_name='math'>440 \rm{ Hz}\cdot (\sqrt[12]{2})^{-19} \approx<space/></extension><space/><bold>146.83&amp;nbsp;Hz</bold></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell>5th</tablecell><tablecell>A<xhtml:sub>2</xhtml:sub></tablecell><tablecell>A</tablecell><tablecell>minor tenth below</tablecell><tablecell>-24</tablecell><tablecell><extension extension_name='math'>440 \rm{ Hz}\cdot (\sqrt[12]{2})^{-24} =<space/></extension><space/><bold>110&amp;nbsp;Hz</bold></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell>6th (lowest pitch)</tablecell><tablecell>E<xhtml:sub>2</xhtml:sub></tablecell><tablecell>E</tablecell><tablecell>minor thirteenth below</tablecell><tablecell>-29</tablecell><tablecell><extension extension_name='math'>440 \rm{ Hz}\cdot (\sqrt[12]{2})^{-29} \approx<space/></extension><space/><bold>82.41&amp;nbsp;Hz</bold></tablecell></tablerow></table><paragraph>This tuning is such that neighboring strings are at most 5 semitones apart.There are also a variety of commonly used<space/><link><target>guitar tuning</target><part>alternate tunings</part></link>.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Bibliography</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><italics>The Guitar and its Music (From the Renaissance to the Classical Era)</italics><space/>(2007) by James Tyler, Paul Sparks.
