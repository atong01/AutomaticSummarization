'''Cream''' is a [[dairy product]] composed of the higher-[[butterfat]] layer skimmed from the top of [[milk]] before [[Homogenization (chemistry)|homogenization]]. In un-homogenized milk, the fat, which is less dense, will eventually rise to the top. In the industrial production of cream, this process is accelerated by using [[centrifuge]]s called "[[Separator (milk)|separator]]s". In many countries, cream is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content. Cream can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets.  Cream has high levels of [[saturated fat]]. <ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/everyone/basics/fat/saturatedfat.html Saturated Fat]</ref><ref>[http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/Eat-less-saturated-fat.aspx Eat less saturated fat]</ref>

Cream skimmed from milk may be called "sweet cream" to distinguish it from whey cream skimmed from [[whey]], a [[by-product]] of [[cheese]]-making. Whey cream has a lower fat content and tastes more salty, tangy and "cheesy".<ref>[http://oukosher.org/index.php/common/article/everything_is_in_butter/ Article on sweet cream, whey cream, and the butters they produce]</ref> In many countries, cream is usually sold partially fermented: [[sour cream]], [[crème fraîche]], and so on.

Cream has many culinary uses in both sweet and salty dishes.

Cream produced by [[cattle]] (particularly [[Jersey cattle]]) grazing on natural [[pasture]] often contains some natural [[carotenoid]] pigments derived from the [[plant]]s they eat; this gives the cream a slight yellow tone, hence the name of the yellowish-white color, [[cream (color)|cream]]. This is also the origin of [[butter]]'s yellow color. Cream from [[goat]]'s milk, or from cows fed indoors on grain or grain-based pellets, is white.

==Cuisine==

Cream is used as an ingredient in many foods, including [[ice cream]], many [[sauce]]s, [[soup]]s, stews, puddings, and some [[custard]] bases, and is also used for [[cakes]]. [[Irish cream]] is an alcoholic liqueur which blends cream with [[whiskey]], and often [[honey]], [[wine]], or coffee. Cream is also used in curries such as masala dishes.

Cream (usually light/single cream or [[half and half]]) is often added to [[coffee]] in the USA.

Both single and double cream can be used in cooking. Double cream or full-fat crème fraîche are often used when cream is added to a hot sauce, to prevent any problem with it separating or "splitting". In sweet and savory [[custard]]s such as those found in flan fillings, [[crème brûlée]]s and crème caramels, both types of cream may be used. Double cream can be thinned with milk to make an approximation of single cream.

==Types ==

[[File:Stewed nectarines.JPG|thumb|right|Stewed [[nectarine]]s and heavy cream]]

Different grades of cream are distinguished by their fat content, whether they have been heat-treated, whipped, and so on. In many jurisdictions, there are regulations for each type.

===United States===
In the United States, cream is usually sold as:
*[[Half and half]] (10.5–18% fat)
*Light cream (18–30% fat)
*Light whipping cream (30–36% fat)
*Heavy cream (36% fat or more)

Not all grades are defined by all jurisdictions, and the exact fat content ranges vary. The above figures are based on the [[Code of Federal Regulations]], Title 21, Part 131<ref>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=131 FDA > CDRH > CFR Title 21 Database Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_05/21cfr131_05.html 2005 CFR Title 21, Volume 2<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Australia===
The Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code - Standard 2.5.2 - Defines cream as milk product comparatively rich in fat, in the form of an emulsion of fat-in-skim milk, which can be obtained by separation from milk. Cream must contain no less than 350 g/kg of milk fat.<ref>http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2011C00621</ref>

Manufacturers labels may distinguish between different fat contents, a general guideline is as follows:

*Extra light (or 'lite'): 12–12.5% fat.
*Light (or 'lite'): 18–20% fat.
*Pure cream: 35–56% fat, without artificial thickeners.
*Thickened cream: 35–36.5% fat, with added gelatine and/or other thickeners to give the cream a creamier texture, also possibly with stabilizers to aid the consistency of whipped cream (this would be the cream to use for whipped cream, not necessarily for cooking)
*Single cream: Recipes calling for 'single cream' are referring to pure or thickened cream with about 35% fat.
*Double cream: 48–60% fat.<ref>http://www.choice.com.au/viewArticle.aspx?id=105898&catId=100286&tid=100008&p=6&title=Cream+and+sour+cream</ref>

=== Canada ===

Canadian cream definitions are similar to those used in the United States, except for that of "light cream". In Canada, "light cream" is low-fat cream, with [http://www.dairygoodness.ca/cream/types-of-cream/5-or-6-light-cream-or-cream-and-milk-blend-for-coffee 5% or 6% fat].  Another form of cream available in Canada is "cereal cream", which is approximately mid-way between 5% cream and coffee cream in fat content.

=== Japan ===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2013}}
In Japan, cream sold in supermarkets is usually between 35% and 48% butterfat.

Sour cream and crème fraîche (German: Sauerrahm, Crème fraîche; French: crème acidulée, crème fraîche; Italian: panna acidula, crème fraîche) are defined as cream soured by bacterial cultures.

Thick cream (German: verdickter Rahm; French: crème épaissie; Italian: panna addensata) is defined as cream thickened using thickening agents.

===Sweden===
In [[Sweden]], cream is usually sold as:
*Matlagningsgrädde ("''cooking cream''"), 10-15 %
*Kaffegrädde ("''Coffee cream''"), 10 %
*Vispgrädde (''whipping cream''), 36 - 40 %

Mellangrädde (27 %) is, nowadays, a less common variant. Gräddfil and Creme Fraiche are two common sour cream products.

==Processing and additives==
Cream may have [[thickening agent]]s and [[Food additive|stabilizer]]s added. Thickeners include [[sodium alginate]], [[carrageenan]], [[gelatine]], [[sodium bicarbonate]], [[tetrasodium pyrophosphate]], and [[alginic acid]].<ref name=DairyFats>Dairy Fats and Related Products, edited by Adnan Tamime. This book has a great deal of technical information on cream and other dairy fat products. Extracts available on Google books [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9h9dnGz7aP0C&lpg=PA296&ots=6Z3uB_hYUD&dq=cream%20alginate%20carrageenan%20-ice&pg=PA296#v=onepage&q=cream%20alginate%20carrageenan%20-ice&f=false]</ref>{{rp|296}}<ref>[http://www.hispanagar.com/carrageenan.htm Carrageenan]</ref>

Other processing may be carried out. For example, cream has a tendency to produce oily globules (called "feathering") when added to [[coffee]]. The stability of the cream may be increased by increasing the non-fat solids content, which can be done by partial demineralisation and addition of [[sodium caseinate]], although this is expensive.<ref name=DairyFats/>{{rp|297}}

==Other cream products==

[[File:Milkproducts v2.svg|thumb|275px|Chart of 50 types of milk products and relationships, including cream (click on image to enlarge).]]

{{nowrap|'''[[Butter]]''' is made}} by [[Churning (butter)|churning]] cream to separate the [[butterfat]] and [[buttermilk]]. This can be done by hand or by machine.

'''[[Whipped cream]]''' is made by [[whisk]]ing or [[mixer (cooking)|mixing]] [[air]] into cream with more than 30% fat, to turn the liquid cream into a soft solid. [[Nitrous oxide]] may also be used to make whipped cream.

'''[[Sour cream]]''', common in many countries including the U.S., Canada and Australia, is cream (12 to 16% or more milk fat) that has been subjected to a [[bacteria]]l culture that produces [[lactic acid]] (0.5%+), which [[souring|sours]] and thickens it.

'''[[Crème fraîche]]''' (28% milk fat) is slightly soured with bacterial culture, but not as sour or as thick as sour cream. Mexican '''crema''' (or '''cream espesa''') is similar to crème fraîche.

'''[[Smetana (cream)|Smetana]]''' is a heavy cream product (15-40% milk fat) Central and Eastern European sweet or sour cream.

'''Rjome''' or '''rømme''' is [[Norway|Norwegian]] sour cream containing 35% milk fat, similar to [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] '''sýrður rjómi'''.

'''[[Clotted cream]]''', common in the United Kingdom, is made through a process that starts by slowly heating whole milk to produce a very high-fat (55%) product. This is similar to Indian '''[[malai]]'''.

==Other items called "cream"==
Many non-edible substances are called creams due merely to their consistency: shoe cream is runny, unlike waxy shoe polish;  hand/body 'creme' is meant for the skin & 'cream' is a food product.

Regulations in many jurisdictions restrict the use of the word ''cream'' for foods. Words such as ''creme'', ''kreme'', ''creame'', or ''whipped topping'' are often used for products which cannot legally be called cream. In some cases foods can be described as cream although they do not contain predominantly milk fats; for example in Britain "[[ice cream]]" does not have to be a dairy product (although it must be labelled "contains non-milk fat"), and [[salad cream]] is the customary name for a condiment that has been produced since the 1920s<ref>[http://www.rsc.org/delivery/_ArticleLinking/DisplayArticleForFree.cfm?doi=AN9457000306&JournalCode=AN UK Ministry of food orders, 1945]</ref>
