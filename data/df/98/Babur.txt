'''Babur''' ({{lang-fa|بابر}}, {{abbr|lit.|literally}}&nbsp;"[[Tiger]]";{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}<ref name="Dale2004" /> 14 February 1483{{spaced ndash}}26 December 1530), born '''Ẓahīr-ud-Dīn Muḥammad''' ({{lang-ar|ظهیرالدین محمد}}, ''Zahir al-Din Muhammad''), was a conqueror from Central Asia who, following a series of setbacks, finally succeeded in laying the basis for the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal dynasty]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]] and became the first Mughal emperor. He was a direct descendant of Turco-Mongol conqueror [[Timur]] (Timurlane) from the [[Barlas]] clan, through his father, and also a descendant of [[Genghis Khan]] through his mother. He was also influenced by the [[Persian culture]] and this affected both his own actions and those of his successors, giving rise to a significant expansion of the [[Persianate society|Persianate]] ethos in the Indian subcontinent.<ref name="Ẓahīr-al-Dīn Moḥammad Bābor">F. Lehmann: [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/babor-zahir-al-din Ẓahīr-al-Dīn Moḥammad Bābor]. In [[Encyclopædia Iranica]]. Online Ed. December 1988 (updated August 2011).

His origin, milieu, training, and education were steeped in Persian culture and so Bābor was largely responsible for the fostering of this culture by his descendants, the Mughals of India, and for the expansion of Persian cultural influence in the Indian subcontinent, with brilliant literary, artistic, and historiographical results."</ref><ref name="Robert L.

Though born as Zahiruddin Muhammad Babur, he was commonly known as Babur. He was the eldest son of [[Umar Sheikh Mirza]]. He ascended the throne of [[Fergana]] in 1495 at the age of twelve and faced rebellion from his own relatives. He conquered [[Samarkand]] two years later, only to lose the city of Fergana soon after. In his attempt to reconquer it, he lost control of Samarkand. In 1501, his attempt to recapture both cities went in vain as he was defeated by [[Muhammad Shaybani Khan]]. In 1504, he conquered [[Kabul]], which was under the rule of the infant heir of [[Ulugh Begh]]. Babur formed a partnership with [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] ruler [[Ismail I]] and reconquered parts of central Asia including Samarkand, only to lose{{clarify|reason=lose what?|date=June 2015}} again to the Uzbeks.

After losing the city{{clarify|reason=which city? According to the previous para, he lost Samarkand twice. I'm not sure how many times he lost Fergana but that too looks like twice, if I hazard a guess|date=June 2015}} for the third time, Babur turned his attention to creating his empire in [[north India]]. At that time, north India was ruled by [[Ibrahim Lodi]] of the [[Lodi dynasty]]. In 1524, [[Daulat Khan Lodi]] invited his nephew, Babur, to overthrow Ibrahim and become ruler. Babur defeated Ibrahim Lodi at the [[First Battle of Panipat]] in 1526 and so founded the Mughal empire. However, he again had to face opposition, this time from [[Rana Sanga]] of [[Mewar]] who considered Babur as a foreigner. The Rana was defeated at the [[Battle of Khanwa]].

Babur married several times. Notable among his sons are [[Humayun]], [[Kamran Mirza]] and [[Hindal Mirza]]. He died in 1530 and was succeeded by Humayun. According to Babur's wishes, he was buried in [[Gardens of Babur|Bagh-e-Babur]] at Kabul in [[Afghanistan]]. Being a patrilineal descendant of Timur, Babur considered himself as a Timurid and Turk, though Uzbek sources claim him as an ethnic Uzbek. He is considered a national hero in [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]]. Many of his poems also have become popular folk songs. He wrote his autobiography, ''[[Baburnama]]'', in [[Chaghatai language|Chaghatai Turkic]] and this was later translated to [[Persian language|Persian]] during [[Akbar]]'s reign.

==Name==
[[Zahir al-Din (disambiguation)|Ẓahīr-ud-Dīn]] is [[Arabic language|Arabic]] for "Defender of [[Islam|the Faith]]" of [[Islam]] and Muhammad honors [[Muhammad|its prophet]].

The difficulty of pronouncing the name for his Central Asian Turco-Mongol army may have been responsible for the greater popularity of his nickname Babur,{{sfn|Eraly|2007|p=18–20}} also variously spelled '''Baber''',{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} '''Babar''',{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} and '''Bābor'''.<ref name="Ẓahīr-al-Dīn Moḥammad Bābor"/> The name is generally taken in reference to the [[Persian language|Persian]] ''babr'', meaning "[[tiger]]".{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}<ref name="Dale2004" /> The word repeatedly appears in [[Ferdowsi]]'s ''[[Shahnameh]]'' and was borrowed into the [[Turkic languages]] of Central Asia.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}}<ref>Thumb, Albert, ''Handbuch des Sanskrit, mit Texten und Glossar'', German original, ed.

The choice of vowel would nominally be restricted to one of the four front vowels (''e'', ''i'', ''ö'', ''ü'' per the Ottoman vowel harmony rule), hence ''babr''&nbsp;→ ''babür'', although the rule is routinely violated for words of Persian or Arabic derivation.<ref>''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain & Ireland'', Cambridge University Press, 1972.

[[File:Emperor babur.jpg|200px|thumb|17th century Portrait of Mughal Emperor Zahir ud-Din Mohammad (Babur)]]
Babur's memoirs form the main source for details of his life. They are known as the ''Baburnama'' and were written in Chaghatai Turkic, his mother-tongue,<ref name="Babur Nama">{{cite book|title=Babur Nama: Journal of Emperor Babur|year=2006|publisher=Penguin Books India|location=Mumbai|isbn=978-0-14-400149-1|page=xviii|author=Dilip Hiro|authorlink=Preface|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VW2HJL689wgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=ISBN9780144001491&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rrVoVLDFGtDvigLg9IGIDg&ved=0CCIQuwUwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> though, according to Dale, "his Turki prose is highly Persianized in its sentence structure, morphology or word formation and vocabulary."<ref name="Dale2004">{{cite book |first=Stephen Frederic |last=Dale |title=The garden of the eight paradises: Bābur and the culture of Empire in Central Asia, Afghanistan and India (1483–1530) |publisher=Brill |year=2004 |pages=15, 150 |isbn=90-04-13707-6 }}</ref> ''Baburnama'' was translated into Persian during the rule of Babur's grandson Akbar.<ref name="Babur Nama" />

Babur was born on {{OldStyleDate|14 February|1483|}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/History/Mughals/Babar.html |publisher=University of California Los Angeles |accessdate=2008-04-02 |work=Manas |title=Babar | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080515223744/http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/History/Mughals/Babar.html| archivedate= 15 May 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref> in the city of [[Andijan]], [[Andijan Province]], [[Fergana Valley]], contemporary Uzbekistan. He was the eldest son of [[Umar Sheikh Mirza]],<ref>{{cite web |quote=On the occasion of the birth of Babar Padishah (the son of Omar Shaikh) |url=http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/rash1.html |title=Mirza Muhammad Haidar |publisher=University of Washington |work=Silk Road Seattle |accessdate=2006-11-07 }}</ref> ruler of the Fergana Valley, the son of [[Abu Sa'id (Timurid dynasty)|Abū Saʿīd Mirza]] (and grandson of [[Miran Shah]], who was himself son of [[Timur]]) and his wife [[Qutlugh Nigar Khanum]], daughter of [[Yunus Khan]], the ruler of [[Moghulistan]] (and great-great grandson of [[Tughlugh Timur]], the son of [[Esen Buqa I]], who was the great-great-great grandson of [[Chaghatai Khan]], the second born son of Genghis Khan).<ref>{{cite book|author1=Babur|title=Babur Nama|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-400149-1|page=vii}}</ref>

Babur hailed from the Barlas tribe, which was of [[Mongol]] origin and had embraced [[Turkic people|Turkic]]<ref>[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-524 Babur] at [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]</ref> and Persian culture.<ref name="Iranica" /> He converted to Islam and resided in [[Turkestan]] and [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. Aside from the Chaghatai language, Babur was equally fluent in [[Persian language|Persian]], the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the Timurid elite.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-32175 Iran: The Timurids and Turkmen] at [[Encyclopædia Britannica]].</ref>

Hence Babur, though nominally a Mongol (or ''Moghul'' in Persian language), drew much of his support from the local Turkic and Iranian people of Central Asia, and his army was diverse in its ethnic makeup. It included [[Persian people|Persians]] (known to Babur as "[[Sart]]s" and "[[Tājik people|Tajiks]]"), [[Pashtun people|ethnic Afghans]], [[History of Arabs in Afghanistan|Arabs]], as well as Barlas and Chaghatayid Turko-Mongols from Central Asia.<ref>{{cite book |title=Central Asia in Historical Perspective |last=Manz |first=Beatrice Forbes |chapter=The Symbiosis of Turk and Tajik |publisher=Boulder, Colorado & Oxford |year=1994 |page=58 |isbn=0-8133-3638-4}}</ref>

== Rule in Central Asia ==

=== As ruler of Fergana ===

[[File:Shaybani.jpg|thumb|150px|Babur was driven out of Transoxiana by Muhammad Shaybani Khan, another descendent of Genghis Khan.]]
In 1494, at eleven years old, Babur became the ruler of Fergana, in present-day Uzbekistan, after Umar Sheikh Mirza died "while tending pigeons in an ill-constructed dovecote that toppled into the ravine below the palace".<ref>{{cite web|title=Wine and tulips in Kabul|url=http://www.economist.com/node/17723207|publisher=Economist|accessdate=12 June 2015}}</ref> During this time, two of his uncles from the neighbouring kingdoms, who were hostile to his father, and a group of nobles who wanted his younger brother Jahangir to be the ruler, threatened his succession to the throne.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|p=18–20}} His uncles were relentless in their attempts to dislodge him from this position as well as from many of his other territorial possessions to come.<ref>{{cite book|title=Domesticity and Power in the Early Mughal World |last=Lal |first=Ruby |isbn=0-521-85022-3 |date=25 September 2005 |page=69 |quote=It was over these possessions, provinces controlled by uncles, or cousins of varying degrees, that Babur fought with close and distant relatives for much of his life.}}</ref> Babur was able to secure his throne mainly because of help from his maternal grandmother, Aisan Daulat Begum, although there was also some luck involved.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|p=18–20}}

Most territories around his kingdom were ruled by his relatives, who were descendants of either Timur or Genghis Khan, and were constantly in conflict.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|p=18–20}} At that time, rival princes were fighting over the city of Samarkand to the west, which was ruled by his paternal cousin. Babur had a great ambition to capture it and in 1497, he [[Siege of Samarkand (1497)|besieged Samarkand]] for seven months before eventually gaining control over it.<ref name="Afghanistan">{{cite book |title= Afghanistan: A Short History of Its People and Politics |last=Ewans |first=Martin |isbn=0-06-050508-7 |publisher=HarperCollins |date=September 2002 |pages=26–7}}</ref> He was fifteen years old and for him, this campaign was a huge achievement.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|p=18–20}} Babur was able to hold it despite desertions in his army but later fell seriously ill. Meanwhile, a rebellion amongst nobles who favoured his brother, back home approximately {{convert|350|km|mi}} away robbed him of Fergana.<ref name="Afghanistan" /> As he was marching to recover it, he lost the Samarkand to a rival prince, leaving him with neither Fergana nor Samarkand.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|p=18–20}} He had held Samarkand for 100 days and he considered this defeat as his biggest loss, obsessing over it even later in his life after his conquests in India.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|p=18–20}}

In 1501, he laid [[Siege of Samarkand (1501)|siege on Samarkand]] once more, but was soon defeated by his most formidable rival, [[Muhammad Shaybani]], [[Khan (title)|khan]] of the Uzbeks.<ref name="Afghanistan" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/babur/babur1.html |quote=After being driven out of Samarkand in 1501 by the Uzbek Shaibanids... |title=The Memoirs of Babur |accessdate=2006-11-08 |publisher=University of Washington |work=Silk Road Seattle}}</ref> Samarkand, his lifelong obsession, was lost again. He tried to reclaim Fergana but lost it too and escaping with a small band of followers, he wandered to the mountains of central Asia and took refuge with hill tribes. Thus, during the ten years since becoming the ruler of Fergana, Babur suffered many short-lived victories and was without shelter and in exile, aided by friends and peasants.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|p=21–23}} He finally stayed in [[Tashkent]], which was ruled by his maternal uncle. Babur wrote, "During my stay in Tashkent, I endured much poverty and humiliation. No country, or hope of one!"{{sfn|Eraly|2007|p=21–23}} For three years Babur concentrated on building up a strong army, recruiting widely amongst the Tajiks of [[Badakhshan]] in particular. By 1502, Babur had resigned all hopes of recovering Fergana, he was left with nothing and was forced to try his luck someplace else.<ref Name="VDM0">{{cite book|last=Mahajan|first=V.D.|title=History of medieval India|year=2007|publisher=S Chand|location=New Delhi|isbn=8121903645|edition=10th|pages=428–429}}</ref>

=== At Kabul ===
Kabul was ruled by Ulugh Begh Mirza of the [[Arghun Dynasty]], who died leaving only an infant as heir.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|p=21–23}} The city was then claimed by Mukin Begh, who was considered to be a usurper and was opposed by the local populace. In 1504, by using the whole situation{{clarify|reason=what "whole" situation? the opposition in Kabul or that + the weather conditions, or something else?|date=June 2015}} to his own advantage, Babur was able to cross the snowy [[Hindu Kush]] mountains and [[Siege of Kabul (1504)|capture Kabul]];<ref name="Afghanistan" /> the remaining Arghunids were forced to retreat to [[Kandahar]]. With this move, he gained a new kingdom, re-established his fortunes and would remain its ruler until 1526.<ref name="VDM0" /> In 1505, because of the low revenue generated by his new mountain kingdom, Babur began his first expedition to India; in his memoirs, he wrote, "My desire for Hindustan had been constant. It was in the month of Shaban, the Sun being in Aquarius, that we rode out of Kabul for Hindustan". It was a brief raid across the [[Khyber Pass]].{{sfn|Eraly|2007|p=21–23}}

In the same year, Babur united with [[Sultan Husayn Mirza Bayqarah]] of [[Herat]], a fellow Timurid and distant relative, against their common enemy, the Uzbek Shaybani.<ref name="perspect">{{cite book |title=Perspectives on Persian Painting: Illustrations to Amir Khusrau's Khamsah |last=Brend |first=Barbara |date=20 December 2002 |isbn=0-7007-1467-7 |publisher=Routledge (UK) |page=188 }}</ref> However, this venture did not take place because Husayn Mirza died in 1506 and his two sons were reluctant to go to war.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|p=21–23}} Babur instead stayed at Herat after being invited by the two Mirza brothers. It was then the cultural capital of the eastern Muslim world. Though he was disgusted by the vices and luxuries of the city,{{sfn|Eraly|2007|p=24–26}} he marvelled at the intellectual abundance there, which he stated was "filled with learned and matched men".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Sewing Circles of Herat: A Personal Voyage Through Afghanistan |last=Lamb |first=Christina |page=153 |isbn=0-06-050527-3 |publisher=HarperCollins |date=February 2004 }}</ref> He became acquainted with the work of the Chagatai poet [[Mir Ali Shir Nava'i]], who encouraged the use of Chagatai as a [[literary language]].

[[File:Meeting between Babur and Sultan 'Ali Mirza near Samarqand.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Meeting between Babur and [[Ali Mirza Safavi]] near [[Samarkand]].|left]]

Babur became the only reigning ruler of the Timurid dynasty after the loss of Herat, and many princes sought refuge from him at Kabul because of Shaybani's invasion in the west.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|p=24–26}} He thus assumed the title of ''[[Padshah]]'' (emperor) among the Timurids—though this tile was insignificant since most of his ancestral lands were taken, Kabul itself was in danger and Shaybani continued to be a threat.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|p=24–26}} He prevailed during a potential rebellion in Kabul, but two years later a revolt among some of his leading generals drove him out of Kabul. Escaping with very few companions, Babur soon returned to the city, capturing Kabul again and regaining the allegiance of the rebels. Meanwhile, Shaybani was defeated and killed by [[Ismail I]], Shah of [[Shia Islam|Shia]] Safavid Persia, in 1510.<ref>{{cite book |title=Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions |last=Doniger |first=Wendy |isbn=0-87779-044-2 |date=September 1999 |page=539 |publisher=Merriam-Webster }}</ref>

Babur and the remaining Timurids used this opportunity to reconquer their ancestral territories. Over the following few years, Babur and Shah Ismail formed a partnership in an attempt to take over parts of Central Asia. In return for Ismail's assistance, Babur permitted the Safavids to act as a suzerain over him and his followers.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Islamic World in Ascendancy: From the Arab Conquests to the Siege in Vienna |last=Sicker |first=Martin |isbn=0-275-96892-8 |date=August 2000 |page=189 |quote=Ismail was quite prepared to lend his support to the displaced Timurid prince, Zahir ad-Din Babur, who offered to accept Safavid suzerainty in return for help in regaining control of Transoxiana.}}</ref> Thus, in 1513, after leaving his brother Nasir Mirza to rule Kabul, he managed to get Samarkand for the third time and Bokhara but lost both again to the Uzbeks.<ref name="VDM0" />{{sfn|Eraly|2007|p=24–26}} Shah Ismail reunited Babur with his sister [[Khanzada Begum|Khānzāda]], who had been imprisoned by and forced to marry the recently deceased Shaybani.<ref>Erdogan, Eralp, "Babür İmparatorluğu’nun Kuruluş Safhasında Şah İsmail ile Babür İttifakı", History Studies, Volume 6 Issue 4, p. 31-39, July 2014</ref> He returned to Kabul after three years in 1514. The following 11 years of his rule mainly involved dealing with relatively insignificant rebellions from Afghan tribes, his nobles and relatives, in addition to conducting raids across the eastern mountains.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|p=24–26}} Babur began to modernise and train his army despite it being, for him, relatively peaceful times.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|p=27–29}}

== Foreign relations ==
Babur began relations with the Safavids when he met [[Ali Mirza Safavi]] at Samarqand; their good relations lasted even after Babur was approached by the  [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. The Safavids army led by [[Najm-e Sani]] massacred civilians in [[Central Asia]] and then sought the assistance of Babur, who advised the Safavids to withdraw. The Safavids, however, refused and were defeated during the [[Battle of Ghazdewan]] by the warlord Ubaydullah Khan.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Stuart Cary Welch|title=The Emperors' Album: Images of Mughal India|publisher=Metroplitian Museum of Art|isbn=9780870994999|page=33}}</ref>

Babur's early relations with theOttomans were poor because the Ottoman [[Sultan]] [[Selim I]] provided his rival Ubaydullah Khan with powerful [[matchlock]]s and [[cannon]]s.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uB1uAAAAMAAJ&q=Ubaydullah+Khan#search_anchor |title=Mughal-Ottoman relations: a study of political & diplomatic relations ... |first=Naimur Rahman |last=Farooqi |publisher= |year=2008 |accessdate=2014-03-25}}</ref> In 1507, when ordered to accept Selim I as his rightful [[suzerainty|suzerain]] Babur refused, and gathered [[Qizilbash]] servicemen in order to counter the forces of Ubaydullah Khan during the [[Battle of Ghazdewan]]. In 1513, Selim I reconciled with Babur (fearing that he would join the Safavids), dispatched [[Ustad Ali Quli]] the artilleryman and [[Mustafa Rumi]], the matchlock marksman, and many other Ottoman Turks, in order to assist Babur in his conquests; this particular assistance proved to be the basis of future Mughal-Ottoman relations.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uB1uAAAAMAAJ&q=Babur&source=gbs_word_cloud_r&cad=6 |title=Mughal-Ottoman relations: a study of political & diplomatic relations ...  |first=Naimur Rahman |last=Farooqi |publisher= |year=2008 |accessdate=2014-03-25}}</ref> From them, he also adopted the tactic of using matchlocks and cannons in field (rather than only in [[siege]]s), which would give him an important advantage in India.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|p=27–29}}

Babur still wanted to escape from the Uzbeks, and finally chose India as a refuge instead of Badakhshan, which was to the north of Kabul. He wrote, "In the presence of such power and potency, we had to think of some place for ourselves and, at this crisis and in the crack of time there was, put a wider space between us and the strong foeman."{{sfn|Eraly|2007|p=27–29}} After his third loss of Samarkand, Babur gave full attention on conquest of India, launching a campaign, he reached [[Chenab]] in 1519.<ref name="VDM0" /> Until 1524, his aim was to only expand his rule to [[Punjab region|Punjab]], mainly to fulfil his ancestor Timur's legacy, since it used to be part of his empire.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|p=27–29}} At the time parts of north India was under the rule of Ibrahim Lodi of the Lodi dynasty, but the empire was crumbling and there were many defectors.

[[File:1526-First Battle of Panipat-Ibrahim Lodhi and Babur.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|Mughal artillery and troops in action during the [[Battle of Panipat (1526)]] .]]
Babur started his campaign in November 1525. He got news at [[Peshawar]] that Daulat Khan Lodi had switched sides and drove out Ala-ud-Din.{{clarify|reason=who drove out Ala-ud-Din? Babur or Lodi?|date=June 2015}} Babur then marched onto Lahore to confront Daulat Khan Lodi, only to see Daulat's army melt away at their approach.<ref name="VDM0" /> Daulat surrendered and was pardoned, thus within three weeks of crossing the [[Indus]] Babur became the master of Punjab.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Babur marched on to Delhi via Sirhind. He reached [[Panipat]] on 20 April 1526 and there met Ibrahim Lodi's numerically superior army of about 100,000 soldiers and 100 elephants.<ref name="VDM0" /><ref name="RSCHMI" /> In the battle that began on the following day, Babur utilised the tactic of ''Tulugma'', encircling Ibrahim Lodi's army and forcing it to face artillery fire directly, as well as frightening its war elephants.<ref name="RSCHMI" />

Ibrahim Lodi died during the battle thus ending the Lodi dynasty.<ref name="VDM0" />

Babur wrote in his memoirs about his victory :
{{Quote|By the grace of the Almighty God, this difficult task was made easy to me and that mighty army, in the space of a half a day was laid in dust.<ref name="VDM0" />}}

After the battle, Babur occupied Delhi and Agra, took the throne of Lodi, and laid the foundation for the eventual rise of Mughal Rule in India; however, before he became India's ruler, he had to fend off challengers, such as Rana Sanga.<ref Name="VDM1">{{cite book|last=Mahajan|first=V.

=== Battle of Khanwa ===
{{Main|Battle of Khanwa}}

The [[Battle of Khanwa]] was fought between Babur and the Rajput ruler Rana Sanga on 17 March 1527. Rana Sanga wanted to overthrow Babur, whom he considered to be a foreigner ruling in India, and also to extend the Rajput territories by annexing [[Delhi]] and [[Agra]]. He was supported by Afghan chiefs who felt Babur had been deceptive by refusing to fulfil promises made to them. Upon receiving news of Rana Sangha's advance towards Agra, Babur took a defensive position at [[Khanwa]] (currently in the Indian state of [[Uttar Pradesh]]), from where he hoped to be able to launch a counterattack later. According to K. V. Krishna Rao, Babur won the battle because of his "superior generalship" and modern tactics: the battle was one of the first in India that featured cannons. Rao also notes that Rana Sanga faced "treachery" when a Silhadi man converted to Islam and joined Babur's army with a garrison of 6,000 soldiers.<ref name="Rao">{{cite book|first=K. V.

== Personal life and relationships ==
There are no descriptions about Babur's physical appearance, except from the paintings in the translation of the [[Baburnama]] prepared during the reign of [[Akbar]].{{sfn|Eraly|2007|p=21–23}} In his autobiography, Babur claimed to be strong and physically fit, and claimed to have swum across every major river he encountered, including twice across the [[Ganges River]] in [[North India]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Elliot |first=Henry Miers |others=John Dowson (ed.) |title=The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians |chapter=The Muhammadan Period |chapterurl=http://persian.packhum.org/persian//pf?file=80201014&ct=56 |accessdate=2008-04-02 |date=1867–1877 |publisher=Trubner |location=London |quote=...and on the same journey, he swam twice across the Ganges, as he said he had done with every other river he had met with. }}</ref> Unlike his father, he had [[:wikt:ascetic|ascetic]] tendencies and did not have any great interest in women.

 |quote=Āisha Sultan Begum, the daughter of Sultan Ahmed Mirza, to whom I had been betrothed in the lifetime of my father and uncle, having arrived in [[Khujand]], I now married her, in the month of Shābān. In the first period of my being a married man, though I had no small affection for her, yet, from modesty and bashfulness, I went to her only once in ten, fifteen, or twenty days. My affection afterwards declined, and my shyness increased; in so much, that my mother the Khanum, used to fall upon me and scold me with great fury, sending me off like a criminal to visit her once in a month or forty days. }}</ref> However, he acquired several more wives and concubines over the years, and as required for a prince, he was able to ensure the continuity of his line; Babur treated them and his other women relatives well. In his memoirs, there is a mention of his infatuation for a younger boy when Babur was 16 years old.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|p=27–29}} According to the historian [[Abraham Eraly]], [[bisexuality]] was common and [[pederasty]] high fashion among the central Asian aristocrats of the time.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|p=12}}

Babur's first wife, Aisha Sultan Begum, was his cousin, the daughter of Sultan Ahmad Mirza, his father's brother. She was an infant when betrothed to Babur, who was himself five years old. They married eleven years later, {{circa|1498-99}} AD. The couple had one daughter by her, [[Fakhr-un-Nissa]], who died within a year in 1500. Three years later, after Babur's first defeat at Fergana, Aisha left him and returned to her father's household.<ref name="Babur's wives and children">{{cite book|title=Babur Nama:Journal of Emperor Babur|publisher=Penguin|page=362|ISBN=978-0-14-400149-1|author=Babur|edition=2006|authorlink=Babur|author2=Dilip Hiro|editor=Dilip Hiro|chapter=Babur's wives and children}}</ref>{{sfn|Eraly|2007|p=27–29}} In 1504, Babur married Zaynab Sultan Begum, who died childless within two years. In the period 1506-08, Babur married four women, being [[Maham Begum]] (in 1506), [[Masuma Sultan Begum]], Gulrukh Begum and Dildar Begum.<ref name="Babur's wives and children" /> Babur had four children by Maham Begum, of whom only one survived infancy. This was his eldest son and heir, [[Humayun]]. Masuma Sultan Begum died during childbirth; the year of her death is disputed (either 1508 or 1519). Gulrukh bore Babur two sons, [[Kamran Mirza|Kamran]] and [[Askari Mirza|Askari]], and Dildar Begum was the mother of Babur's youngest son, [[Hindal Mirza|Hindal]].<ref name="Babur's wives and children" /> Babur later married [[Mubaraka Yusufzai]], a Pashtun woman of the [[Yusufzai]] tribe. Gulnar Aghacha and Nargul Aghacha were two [[Circassian beauties|Circassian slaves]] given to Babur as gifts by Tahmasp Shah Safavi, the Shah of Persia. They became "recognized ladies of the royal household."<ref name="Babur's wives and children" />

During his rule in Kabul, when there was a relative time of peace, Babur pursued his interests in literature, art, music and gardening.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|p=27–29}} Previously, he never drank alcohol and avoided it when he was in Herat. In Kabul, he first tasted it at the age of thirty. He then began to drink regularly, host wine parties and consume preparations made from opium.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|p=24–26}} Though religion had a central place in his life, Babur also approvingly quoted a line of poetry by one of his contemporaries: "I am drunk, officer. Punish me when I am sober". He quit drinking for health reasons before the [[Battle of Khanwa]], just two years before his death, and demanded that his court do the same. But he did not stop chewing narcotic preparations, and did not lose his sense of irony. He wrote, "Everyone regrets drinking and swears an oath (of [[abstinence]]); I swore the oath and regret that."<ref>Pope, Hugh (2005). ''Sons of the Conquerors'', Overlook Duckworth, pp.234–235.</ref>

== Death and legacy ==
[[File:Babur and Humayun.jpg|Babur and his heir [[Humayun]]|thumb]]

Babur died at the age of 47 on {{OldStyleDate|5 January|1531|26 December 1530}}, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Humayun. After death, his body was moved to Kabul, Afghanistan where it lies in [[Bagh-e Babur]] (Babur Gardens).<ref name="VDM">{{cite book|last=Mahajan|first=V.D.|title=History of medieval India|year=2007|publisher=S Chand|location=New Delhi|isbn=8121903645|edition=10th|page=438 ed}}</ref>

It is generally agreed that, as a Timurid, Babur was not only significantly influenced by the Persian culture, but that his empire also gave rise to the expansion of the Persianate ethos in the Indian subcontinent.<ref name="Ẓahīr-al-Dīn Moḥammad Bābor" /><ref name="Robert L. Canfield 1991 p.20" />

For example, F. Lehmann states in the ''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]'':
{{Quote|His origin, milieu, training, and culture were steeped in Persian culture and so Babur was largely responsible for the fostering of this culture by his descendants, the Mughals of India, and for the expansion of Persian cultural influence in the Indian subcontinent, with brilliant literary, artistic, and historiographical results.<ref name="Iranica">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Lehmann |first=F. |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/babor-zahir-al-din |title= Memoirs of Zehīr-ed-Dīn Muhammed Bābur |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]] |accessdate=2008-04-02}}</ref>}}

One of the enduring features of Babur's life was that he left behind the lively and well-written autobiography known as ''Baburnama''.<ref name="baburnama"/> Quoting [[Henry Beveridge]], [[Stanley Lane-Poole]] writes:
{{Quote|His autobiography is one of those priceless records which are for all time, and is fit to rank with the confessions of St. Augustine and Rousseau, and the memoirs of Gibbon and Newton.

In his own words, "The cream of my testimony is this, do nothing against your brothers even though they may deserve it."  Also, "The new year, the spring, the wine and the beloved are joyful.

=== Babri Masjid ===
Babur is popularly believed to have demolished the Rama Temple at [[Ayodhya]], India, and built [[Babri Masjid]] there.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} However, three inscriptions which once adorned the surface of the mosque indicate that it was constructed on the orders of [[Mir Baqi]], not Babur. Baqi was one of Babur's generals who led forces sent to the region during his reign. In 2003, the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI) was asked to conduct a more detailed study and an excavation to ascertain the type of structure that was beneath the rubble of Babri Masjid.<ref>Ratnagar, Shereen (2004) "CA Forum on Anthropology in Public: Archaeology at the Heart of a Political Confrontation: The Case of Ayodhya" ''Current Anthropology'' 45(2): pp. 239–259, p. 239</ref> According to a news report in ''The Week'', the ASI report indicated "no mention of a temple, only of evidence of a massive structure, fragments of which speak about their association with temple architecture of the Saivite style."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20050323101829/http://www.the-week.com/23sep07/events1.htm |title=Events: Ayodhya; Layers of truth; Sept 7, 2003.
