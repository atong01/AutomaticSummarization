In many legal jurisdictions related to [[English law#Common law|English common law]], '''affray''' is a [[public order]] offence consisting of the fighting of one or more persons in a public place to the terror (in {{lang-fr|à l'effroi}}) of ordinary people.  Depending on their actions, and the laws of the prevailing jurisdiction, those engaged in an affray may also render themselves liable to prosecution for [[assault]], [[riot act|unlawful assembly]], or [[riot]]; if so, it is for one of these offences that they are usually charged.<ref name="britannica">"Affray", [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], 1911</ref>

==United Kingdom==

===England and Wales===
The [[common law offence]] of affray was abolished<ref>The [[Public Order Act 1986]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/64/section/9 section 9(1)]</ref> for [[England and Wales]]<ref>The [[Public Order Act 1986]], section 42</ref> on 1 April 1987.<ref>The [[Public Order Act 1986 (Commencement No. 2) Order 1987]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1987/198/article/2/made article 2] and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1987/198/schedule/made Schedule] (1987/198 (C. 4))</ref>  Affray is now a statutory offence that is [[triable either way]]. It is created by section 3 of the [[Public Order Act 1986]] which provides:

{{Blockquote|(1) A person is guilty of affray if he uses or threatens unlawful violence towards another and his conduct is such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his personal safety.
(2) Where 2 or more persons use or threaten the unlawful violence, it is the conduct of them taken together that must be considered for the purposes of subsection (1).<br>
(3) For the purposes of this section a threat cannot be made by the use of words alone.<br>
(4) No person of reasonable firmness need actually be, or be likely to be, present at the scene.<br>
(5) Affray may be committed in private as well as in public places.<br>
(6) . . . ''See sections 6(5) to 6(7)''.<br>
(7) A person guilty of affray is liable on [[conviction]] on [[indictment]] to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or a fine or both, or on [[summary conviction]] to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or a fine not exceeding the [[statutory maximum]] or both.<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/64/section/3 Digitised copy] of section 3 of the [[Public Order Act 1986]] from [[Legislation.gov.uk]].</ref>}}

The term "violence"  expression is defined by section 8.{{clarify|date=February 2015}}

Section 3(6) once provided that a constable could arrest without warrant anyone he reasonably suspected to be committing affray, but that subsection was repealed by paragraph 26(2) of Schedule 7 to, and Schedule 17 to, the [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]].

The '''[[mens rea]]''' of affray is that person is guilty of affray only if he intends to use or threaten violence or is aware that his conduct may be violent or threaten violence.<ref>The [[Public Order Act 1986]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/64/section/6 section 6(2)]</ref>

The offence of affray has been used by [[HM Government]] to address the problem of drunken or violent individuals who cause serious trouble on [[airliner]]s.
