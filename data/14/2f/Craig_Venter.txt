Venter began his college education at a [[community college]], [[College of San Mateo]] in [[California]], and later transferred to the [[University of California, San Diego]], where he studied under biochemist [[Nathan O. Kaplan]]. He received a [[Bachelor of Science|BS]] in [[biochemistry]] in 1972, and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[physiology]] and [[pharmacology]] in 1975, both from UCSD.<ref name="Taubes">{{cite journal |url=http://archive.sciencewatch.com/sept-oct97/sw_sep-oct97_page3.htm |title=Craig Venter Takes Aim at the Big Questions |journal=[[ScienceWatch]] |date=September–October 1997 |volume=8 |issue=5 |accessdate=June 7, 2009}}</ref> He married former PhD candidate Barbara Rae.<ref>[http://www.rae-venterlaw.com/who.htm Rae-Venter Law Group]</ref><ref name = "abfamb">{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/science/the-god-of-small-things/2007/01/25/1169594430068.html?page=fullpage |title=The god of small things |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=January 26, 2007}}</ref> After working as an [[associate professor]], and later as full professor, at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York at Buffalo]], he joined the [[National Institutes of Health]] in 1984.

==Career==

===EST controversy===
While an employee of the [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]], Venter used a technique for rapidly identifying all of the [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]]s present in a cell and began to use it to identify human brain genes. The short [[Complementary DNA|cDNA]] sequence fragments discovered by this method are called [[expressed sequence tag]]s (ESTs).  The [[NIH Office of Technology Transfer]] and Venter decided to use these ESTs to attempt to [[Biological patents in the United States|patent the genes]] they identified based on the ESTs alone.  When Venter disclosed this strategy during a Congressional hearing, a firestorm of controversy erupted.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Roberts | first = Leslie | date = October 11, 1991 | title = Genome patent fight erupts: an NIH plan to patent thousands of random DNA sequences will discourage industrial investment and undercut the Genome Project itself, the plan's critics charge | journal = [[Science (magazine)|Science]] | volume = 254 | issue = 5029 | pages = 184–186 | doi = 10.1126/science.1925568|bibcode = 1991Sci...254..184R }}</ref> The NIH later stopped the effort and abandoned the patent applications it had filed, following public outcry.<ref>{{Cite journal | date = 2006 | journal = [[Harvard Law Review]] | volume = 119 | title = Patent Law—Utility—Federal Circuit holds that expressed sequence tags lack substantial and specific utility unless underlying gene function is identified.—''In re Fisher'', 421 F.3d 1365 (Fed.

===Human Genome Project===
{{main|Human Genome Project}}
Venter was passionate about the power of genomics to radically transform healthcare. Venter believed that [[shotgun sequencing]] was the fastest and most effective way to get useful human genome data.<ref name="Weber1997">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Weber | first1 = James L.  | last2 = Myers | first2 = Eugene W.  | date = 1997 | journal = [[Genome Research]] | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | title = Human Whole-Genome Shotgun Sequencing | pages = 401–409 | doi = 10.1101/gr.7.5.401  | url = http://genome.cshlp.org/content/7/5/401.full  | doi_brokendate = 2015-01-09 | pmid=9149936
}}</ref> The method was rejected by the Human Genome Project however, since some geneticists felt it would not be accurate enough for a genome as complicated as that of humans, that it would be logistically more difficult, and that it would cost significantly more.<ref>Gannett, Lisa, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/human-genome/ The Human Genome Project Entry in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]  (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N.

Frustrated with what Venter viewed as the slow pace of progress in the Human Genome project, and unable to get funds for his ideas, he sought funding from the private sector to fund [[Celera Genomics]].<ref>{{cite book| author = Victor K. McElheny| title = Drawing the Map of Life: Inside the Human Genome Project| date = 2010| publisher = Basic Books (AZ)| isbn = 978-0-465-04333-0 }}</ref> The goal of the company was to sequence the entire human genome and release it into the [[public domain]] for non-commercial use in much less time and for much less cost than the public human genome project. The company planned to profit from their work by creating a value-added database of genomic data to which users could subscribe for a fee. The goal consequently put pressure on the public genome program and spurred several groups to redouble their efforts to produce the full sequence. [[DNA]] from five demographically different individuals was used by Celera to generate the sequence of the human genome; one of the individuals was Venter himself.

In 2000, Venter and [[Francis Collins (geneticist)|Francis Collins]] of the [[National Institutes of Health]] and U.S. Public Genome Project jointly made the announcement of the mapping of the human genome, a full three years ahead of the expected end of the Public Genome Program. The announcement was made along with [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]], and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]].<ref name="blueprint">{{cite news |first=Jamie |last=Shreeve |url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/051031/31genome.htm |title=The Blueprint of Life |newspaper=[[U.S. News and World Report]] |date=October 31, 2005 |accessdate=January 30, 2007}}</ref> Venter and Collins thus shared an award for "Biography of the Year" from [[A&E Network]].<ref name="montgomery">"{{cite press release |url=http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/mc/news/press/00-463.html |title=Time Magazine Dubs Montgomery County "DNA Alley" |publisher=[[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County, Maryland Government]]|date=December 19, 2000 |accessdate=January 30, 2007}}</ref>
On the 15 February 2001, the Human Genome Project consortium published the first Human Genome in the journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], and was followed, one day later, by a Celera publication in Science.<ref name="Venter2001">{{Cite journal | last1 = Venter | first1 = J.

Although Celera was originally set to sequence a composite of DNA samples, partway through the sequencing, Venter switched the samples for his own DNA.<ref name="dna switch">{{cite news |first=Emily |last=Singer |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/biomedicine/19328/?a=f |title=Technology Review |newspaper=[[Technology review]] |date=September 4, 2007 |accessdate=12 October 2014| quote=After leaving Celera in 2002, Venter announced that much of the genome that had been sequenced there was his own.}}</ref>

After contributing to the Human Genome, and its release into the public domain, Venter was fired by Celera in early 2002.<ref>{{cite news |first=Antonio |last=Regalo |title=Maverick biologist at work on next goal: creating life |newspaper=[[Seattle Times]] |date=July 24, 2005}}</ref> According to his biography, Venter was ready to leave Celera, and was fired due to conflict with the main investor, Tony White, that had existed since day one of the project. Venter writes that his main goal was always to accelerate science and thereby discovery, and he only sought help from the corporate world when he could not find funding in the public sector.

===Global Ocean Sampling Expedition===
The [[Global Ocean Sampling Expedition]] (GOS) is an [[ocean exploration]] [[genome project]] with the goal of assessing the [[genetic diversity]] in [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[microbial communities]] and to understand their role in nature's fundamental processes. Begun as a Sargasso Sea pilot sampling project in August 2003, Venter announced the full Expedition on 4 March 2004. The project, which used Venter's personal yacht, ''Sorcerer II'', started in Halifax, Canada, circumnavigated the globe and returned to the U.S. in January 2006.<ref name="for sale">{{cite news |title=Yacht for Sale: Suited for Sailing, Surfing, and Seaborne Metagenomics |work=GenomeWeb.com |publisher=GenomeWeb News|author=Larkman, Kirell |date=September 7, 2007 |accessdate=September 7, 2007}}</ref>

===Synthetic genomics===
[[Image:J. Craig Vernter Institute Rockville Maryland.jpg|200px|right|thumb|J.&nbsp;Craig Venter Institute in Rockville, Maryland]]
Venter is currently the president of the [[J. Craig Venter Institute]], which conducts research in [[synthetic biology]]. In June 2005, he co-founded [[Synthetic Genomics]], a firm dedicated to using modified [[microorganisms]] to produce [[clean fuels]] and biochemicals. In July 2009, [[ExxonMobil]] announced a $600 million collaboration with Synthetic Genomics to research and develop next-generation [[biofuel]]s.<ref name="exxon">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2009/07/14/14greenwire-exxon-sinks-600m-into-algae-based-biofuels-in-33562.html |title=Exxon Sinks $600M Into Algae-Based Biofuels in Major Strategy Shift|work=NYTimes.com|publisher=New York Times|date=July 14, 2009 | first=Katie | last=Howell}}</ref>

On September 4, 2007, a team led by Sam Levy published the first complete (six-billion-letter) [[genome]] of an individual human—Venter's own DNA sequence.<ref name="PloS_VG">{{cite journal|journal=PLoS Biology|date=2007|volume=5|issue=10|title=The Diploid Genome Sequence of an Individual Human|author=Levy S |url=http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.0050254 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0050254|pages=e254|pmid=17803354|pmc=1964779|author2=Sutton G|author3=Ng PC|author4=Feuk L|author5=Halpern AL|display-authors=5|last6=Walenz|first6=Brian P.|last7=Axelrod|first7=Nelson|last8=Huang|first8=Jiaqi|last9=Kirkness|first9=Ewen F.}}</ref> Some of the sequences in Venter's genome are associated with wet earwax,<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=117800 Omim - Ear Wax, Wet/Dry<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> increased risk of antisocial behavior, [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]] and [[cardiovascular diseases]].<ref>{{cite book| author = Venter, J.C.| title = A Life Decoded| date = 2007| publisher = Viking| location = New York| isbn = 978-0-670-06358-1 }}</ref> This publication was especially interesting since it contained a [[diploid]] instead of a [[haploid]] genome and shows promise for [[personalized medicine]] via [[genotyping]].{{Or|date=October 2009}} This genome, dubbed HuRef by Levy and others, was a landmark accomplishment.

The Human Reference Genome Browser is a web application for the navigation and analysis of Venter's recently published genome. The HuRef database consists of approximately 32 million DNA reads sequenced using [[microfluidic Sanger sequencing]], assembled into 4,528 scaffolds and 4.1 million [[Mutation|DNA variation]]s identified by genome analysis. These variants include [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNPs), block [[point mutation|substitutions]], short and large [[indel]]s, and structural variations like [[insertion (genetics)|insertions]], [[deletion (genetics)|deletions]], [[chromosome inversion|inversions]] and [[copy number variation|copy number changes]].

The browser enables scientists to navigate the HuRef genome assembly and sequence variations, and to compare it with the NCBI human build 36 assembly in the context of the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|NCBI]] and [[Ensembl]] annotations. The browser provides a comparative view between NCBI and HuRef consensus sequences, the sequence multi-alignment of the HuRef assembly, Ensembl and dbSNP annotations, HuRef variants, and the underlying variant evidence and functional analysis. The interface also represents the [[haplotype]] blocks from which diploid genome sequence can be inferred and the relation of variants to gene annotations. The display of variants and gene annotations are linked to external public resources including [[dbSNP]], Ensembl, [[Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man]] (OMIM) and [[Gene Ontology]] (GO).

Users can search the HuRef genome using HUGO gene names, Ensembl and dbSNP identifiers, HuRef [[contig]] or scaffold locations, or NCBI chromosome locations. Users can then easily and quickly browse any genomic region via the simple and intuitive pan and zoom controls; furthermore, data relevant to specific loci can be exported for further analysis.

===Human Longevity, Inc.===
On March 4, 2014 Venter and co-founders [[Peter Diamandis]] and [[Hariri#Others|Robert Hariri]] announced the formation of Human Longevity, Inc., a company focused on extending the healthy, "high performance", human lifespan.<ref name="PRNewswire">{{cite news | title = Human Longevity Inc.

Human Longevity's mission is to extend healthy human lifespan by the use of high-resolution [[big data]] diagnostics from [[genomics]], [[Metabolome|metabolomics]], [[Microbiome|microbiomics]], and [[proteomics]], and the use of [[stem cell therapy]].<ref name="HuffP">{{cite news | last = Smith | first = Robin L.  | title = The Regeneration Generation: A Conversation With Bob Hariri, Vice-Chairman and Co-Founder of Human Longevity Inc.  | publisher = [[The Huffington Post]] | date = 11 November 2014  | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robin-l-smith/the-regeneration-generati_b_6199076.html | accessdate = 2014-12-16 }}</ref>

==Author of two books==
Venter is the author of two books, the first of which was ostensibly an autobiography titled ''A Life Decoded''.<ref>{{cite book| author=J. Craig Venter| title = A Life Decoded: My Genome: My Life| date = October 18, 2007| publisher = [[Viking Adult]]| location = New York, New York| isbn = 0-670-06358-4| oclc = 165048736}}</ref> Venter's second book was titled ''Life at the Speed of Light'' in which he announced his theory that this is the generation in which there appears to be a dovetailing of the two previously diverse fields of science represented by computer programming and the genetic programming of life by DNA sequencing.<ref>{{cite book| author=J. Craig Venter| title = Life at the Speed of Light: From the Double Helix to the Dawn of Digital Life| date = October 17, 2013| publisher = [[Viking Adult]]| location = New York, New York| isbn = 9780670025404| oclc = 834432832}}</ref> He was applauded for his position on this by futurist [[Ray Kurzweil]].

==In popular culture==
Venter has been the subject of several biography books, several scientific documentary books, TV documentaries, numerous magazine articles, and many speeches.

Venter has been the subject of articles in several magazines, including ''[[Wired magazine|Wired]]'',<ref name="wired">Shreeve, James.

Venter appeared in the "Evolution" episode of the documentary television series ''[[Understanding (TV series)|Understanding]]''.

On May 16, 2004, Venter gave the commencement speech at [[Boston University]].<ref name="bu">Warren, Jessica. [http://www.dailyfreepress.com/news/april-30-genome-scientist-to-speak-at-commencement-1.932055 April 30: Genome scientist to speak at Commencement], ''The Daily Free Press'', April 28, 2004. Accessed August 2, 2008.</ref>

In a 2007 interview with ''[[New Scientist]]'' when asked "Assuming you can make [[Synthetic life|synthetic bacteria]], what will you do with them?", Venter replied: "Over the next 20 years, synthetic genomics is going to become the standard for making anything. The chemical industry will depend on it. Hopefully, a large part of the energy industry will depend on it. We really need to find an alternative to taking carbon out of the ground, burning it, and putting it into the atmosphere. That is the single biggest contribution I could make."

He was on the 2007 [[Time 100]] most influential people in the world list made by ''Time'' magazine. In 2007 he also received the [[Golden Eurydice Award]] for contributions to [[biophilosophy]].

On December 4, 2007, Venter gave the [[Richard Dimbleby Lecture|Dimbleby lecture]] for the BBC in London. In February 2008, he gave a speech about his current work at the [[TED (conference)|TED conference]].<ref name="ted">[http://www.ted.com/talks/craig_venter_is_on_the_verge_of_creating_synthetic_life.html TED | Talks | Craig Venter: On the verge of creating synthetic life (video)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Venter delivered the 2008 convocation speech for Faculty of Science honours and specialization students at the [[University of Alberta]]. A transcription of the speech is available [http://venter2008conv.jottit.com/ here].<ref name="expressnews.ualberta">Brown, M.: [http://www.expressnews.ualberta.ca/article.cfm?id=9399 "Genomics leader accepts U of A honorary degree"], "UofA ExpressNews"; retrieved on June 7, 2009.</ref>

Venter was featured in ''Time'' magazine's "The Top 10 Everything of 2008" article. Number three in 2008's Top 10 Scientific Discoveries was a piece outlining his work stitching together the 582,000 base pairs necessary to invent the genetic information for a whole new bacterium.<ref name="time">{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2008/top10/article/0,30583,1855948_1863947,00.html | work=Time | title=The Top 10 Everything Of 2008 | date=November 3, 2008 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}</ref>

For an episode aired on July 27, 2009, Venter was interviewed on his boat by BBC One for the first episode of TV show ''[[Bang Goes the Theory]]''.

On May 20, 2010, Venter announced the creation of first self-replicating semi-synthetic bacterial cell.<ref name="ted_a">http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/craig_venter_unveils_synthetic_life.html</ref>

On November 21, 2010 [[Steve Kroft]] profiled Venter and his research on ''[[60 Minutes]]''.

In the June 2011 issue of ''[[Men's Journal]]'', Venter was featured as the "Survival Skills" celebrity of the month.  He shared various anecdotes, and advice, including stories of his time in [[Vietnam]], as well as mentioning a bout with [[melanoma]] upon his back, which subsequently resulted in "giving a pound of flesh" to surgery.<ref name="mensjournal">{{cite web |publisher=Men's Journal |url=http://www.mensjournal.com/survival-skills-craig-venter |date=May 20, 2011 |author=Will Cockrell |title=Survival Skills: Craig Venter}}</ref>

Venter is mentioned, in the season finale of the first season of the science fiction series ''[[Orphan Black]]'', a joint production of [[Space (TV channel)|Space]] and [[BBC America]]. In the episode, Venter is referenced as patenting an organism and encoding a message in the genome of that organism, an act repeated by the character of Aldous Leekie (played by [[Matt Frewer]]). While the clones fear that this renders them as nothing more than property, in reality, in the United States and Canada, where the show primarily takes place, such a patent became unenforceable due to constitutional provisions and laws against owning human beings.

==Bibliography==
Venter is an [[ISI highly cited researcher]] and has authored over 200 publications in [[scientific journal]]s.<ref name="HighlyCited">{{cite web |title=Venter, J. Craig |work=[[ISIHighlyCited.com]] |url=http://hcr3.isiknowledge.com/author.cgi?&link1=Browse&link2=Results&id=770 |subscription=yes |date=August 19, 2003 |accessdate=October 17, 2009}}</ref>
<!--LIST CRITERIA-->
<!-- For inclusion on this list, a publication must meet ALL of the following criteria (see exceptions below):
(1) Include Venter as a ''primary'' author. He will invariably be listed first or last. THERE IS NO EXCEPTION TO THIS CRITERION.
(2) Be cited in a peer-reviewed scientific journal with an [[impact factor]] of at least 10.
(3) It must have at least an average of 100 citations PER YEAR. If you are using ISIknowledge, just click on the number of times cited, then click on "analyze results", and rank by publication year. To calculate this manually, take the number of citations the article has (try using ISIknowledge.com) and divide it by the number of years since it was published. This rule is more flexible for articles published in the 20th century, as most can reasonably be expected not to be cited often anymore.

Exceptions to criteria 3 are:
(1) his autobiography
(2) an article that is a BIG DEAL but is too recent to have been so highly cited (for example, "Environmental genome shotgun sequencing of the Sargasso Sea" was a huge deal, but was only cited 60 times in 2004, a very low number for a Venter article)
(3) a review, editorial, etc., that is often cited and that provides a broad overview OF HIS OWN WORKS.

The criteria may seem incredibly high, but they account for the fact that Venter's articles are hugely cited and WP is not a directory.

<!--NOTE: the use of the ellipsis is prescribed by the [[APA]] when a work has more than 7 authors and a later one needs mentioning. For the purposes of this section (and with a modification so that it matches the output of citation templates), the first 7 authors are listed, followed by the spaced ellipsis, followed by the author (Venter), and, if necessary, followed by ''et al''.-->
