'''''Eyes Wide Shut''''' is a 1999 [[erotic thriller]] [[film]]<!-- Before changing to "erotic thriller" with citation, address issues in new article section Genre and Marketing below. See also WP policy [[WP:UNDUE]]--> loosely based upon [[Arthur Schnitzler]]'s 1926 [[novella]] ''[[Dream Story|Traumnovelle]]'' (''Dream Story''). The film was directed, produced, and co-written by [[Stanley Kubrick]]. It was his last film, as he died six days after showing his final cut to [[Warner Bros.]] studios.<ref name="Jan Harlan">Jan Harlan, ''Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures''</ref> The story, set in and around [[New York City]], follows the sexually charged adventures of Dr. Bill Harford, who is shocked when his wife, Alice, reveals that she had contemplated an affair a year earlier. He embarks on a night-long adventure, during which he infiltrates a massive masked [[orgy]] of an unnamed [[secret society]].

Kubrick obtained the filming rights for ''Dream Story'' in the 1960s, considering it a perfect novel to [[Film adaptation|adapt on a film]] about sexual relations. The project was only revived in the 1990s, when the director hired writer [[Frederic Raphael]] to help him with the adaptation. The film was mostly shot in the United Kingdom (aside from some exterior [[establishing shots]]), and included a detailed recreation of some exterior [[Greenwich Village]] street scenes at [[Pinewood Studios]]. The film spent a long time in production, and holds the [[Guinness World Record]] for the longest continuous film shoot period, at 400 days.

''Eyes Wide Shut'' was released on July 16, 1999, a few months following Kubrick's death, to positive critical reaction and intakes of $162 million at the worldwide box office. Its strong sexual content also made it controversial; to ensure a theatrical [[Motion_Picture_Association_of_America_film_rating_system#Ratings|R rating]] in the United States, Warner Bros. digitally altered several scenes during post-production. The uncut version has since been released in DVD, [[HD DVD]], and [[Blu-ray Disc]] formats.

==Plot==
Dr. Bill Harford ([[Tom Cruise]]) and his wife, Alice ([[Nicole Kidman]]), are a young couple living in New York. They go to a Christmas party thrown by a wealthy patient, Victor Ziegler ([[Sydney Pollack]]). Bill meets an old friend from medical school, Nick Nightingale ([[Todd Field]]), who now plays piano professionally. While a Hungarian man named Sandor Szavost ([[Sky du Mont]]) tries to pick up Alice, two young models try to take Bill off for a tryst. He is interrupted by a call from his host upstairs, who had been having sex with Mandy ([[Julienne Davis]]), a young woman who has overdosed on a [[Speedball (drug)|speedball]]. Mandy recovers with Bill's aid.

The next evening at home, while smoking [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], Alice asks him if he had sex with the two girls. After Bill reassures her, she asks if he is ever jealous of men who are attracted to her. As the discussion gets heated, he states that he thinks women are more faithful than men. She rebuts him, telling him of a recent fantasy she had about a naval officer they had encountered on a vacation. Disturbed by Alice's revelation, Bill is then called by the daughter of a patient who has just died; he then heads over to her place. In her pain, Marion Nathanson ([[Marie Richardson]]) impulsively kisses him and says she loves him. Putting her off before her fiance Carl ([[Thomas Gibson]]) arrives, Bill takes a walk. He meets a prostitute named Domino ([[Vinessa Shaw]]) and goes to her apartment.

Alice phones just as Domino begins to kiss Bill, after which he calls off the awkward encounter. Meeting Nick at the jazz club where he's just finishing his last set, Bill learns that Nick has an engagement where he must play piano blindfolded. Bill presses for details. He learns that to gain admittance, one needs a costume, a mask, and the password (which Nick writes down for him). Bill goes to a costume shop. He offers the owner, Mr. Milich ([[Rade Serbedzija]]), a generous amount of money to rent a costume. In the shop, Milich catches his teenage daughter ([[Leelee Sobieski]]) with two Japanese men and expresses outrage at their lack of a sense of decency.

Bill takes a taxi to the country mansion mentioned by Nick. He gives the password and discovers a quasi-religious sexual ritual is taking place. Although he is masked, a woman takes Bill aside and warns him he does not belong there, insisting he is in terrible danger. She is then whisked away by someone else, so Bill spends some time wandering from room to room in the mansion, where groups of masked people are engaged in various types of sexual acts, while others watch. He is then interrupted by a porter who tells Bill that the taxi driver wants to speak urgently with him at the front door. However, the porter takes him to the ritual room, where a disguised red-cloaked [[Master of ceremonies|Master of Ceremonies]] confronts Bill with a question about a second password. Bill says he has forgotten. The Master of Ceremonies insists that Bill "kindly remove his mask", then his clothes. The masked woman who had tried to warn Bill now intervenes and insists that she be punished instead of him. Bill is ushered from the mansion and warned not to tell anyone about what happened there.

Just before dawn, Bill arrives home guilty and confused. He finds Alice laughing loudly in her sleep and awakens her. While crying, she tells him of a troubling dream in which she was having sex with the naval officer and many other men, and laughing at the idea of Bill seeing her with them. The next morning, Bill goes to Nick's hotel, where the desk clerk ([[Alan Cumming]]) tells Bill that a bruised and frightened Nick checked out a few hours earlier after returning with two large, dangerous-looking men. Nick tried to pass an envelope to the clerk when they were leaving, but it was intercepted, and Nick was driven away by the two men.

Bill goes to return the costume — but not the mask, which he has misplaced — and Milich, with his daughter by his side, states he can do other favors for Bill "and it needn't be a costume." The same two Japanese men leave; Milich implies to Bill that he has sold his daughter for prostitution. Bill returns to the country mansion in his own car and is met at the gate by a man with a note warning him to [[cease and desist]] his inquiries. At home, Bill thinks about Alice's dream while watching her tutor their daughter.

Bill reconsiders his sexual offers the night before. He first phones Marion, but hangs up after Carl answers the phone. Bill then goes to Domino's apartment with a gift. Her roommate Sally ([[Fay Masterson]]) is home, but not Domino. After Bill attempts to seduce Sally, she reveals to him that Domino has just tested positive for [[HIV]]. Bill leaves and notices a man is following him. After reading a newspaper story about a beauty queen who died of a drug overdose, Bill views the body at the morgue and identifies it as Mandy. Bill is summoned to Ziegler's house, where he is confronted with the events of the past night and day. Ziegler was one of those involved with the ritual orgy, and identified Bill and his connection with Nick. His own position with the secret society has been jeopardized by Bill's intrusion since Ziegler recommended Nick for the job.

Ziegler claims that he had Bill followed for his own protection, and that the warnings made against Bill by the society are only intended to scare him from speaking about the orgy. But he implies the society is capable of acting on their threats, telling Bill: "If I told you their names, I don't think you'd sleep so well". Bill asks about the death of Mandy, whom Ziegler has identified as the masked woman at the party who'd "sacrificed" herself to prevent Bill's punishment, and about the disappearance of Nick, the piano player. Ziegler insists that Nick is safely back at his home in [[Seattle]]. Ziegler also says the "punishment" was a charade by the secret society to further frighten Bill, and it had nothing to do with Mandy's death; she was a hooker and addict and had indeed died from another accidental drug overdose. Bill clearly does not know if Ziegler is telling him the truth about Nick's disappearance or Mandy's death, but he says nothing further and lets the matter drop.

When he returns home, Bill finds the rented mask on his pillow next to his sleeping wife. He breaks down in tears and decides to tell Alice the whole truth of the past two days. The next morning, they go Christmas shopping with their daughter. Alice muses that they should be grateful they have survived, that she loves him, and there is something they must do as soon as possible. When Bill asks what it may be, she simply says: "Fuck".

==Production==

===Development===
While [[Stanley Kubrick]] was interested in making a film about sexual relations as early as 1962, during production of ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'',<ref name=ew>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20471622_272431,00.html|title=Behind the scenes of ''Eyes Wide Shut''|first=Benjamin|last=Svetkey |date=July 23, 1999|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref> the project only took off after he read [[Arthur Schnitzler]]'s ''[[Dream Story]]'' in 1968, when he was seeking a work to follow on ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''. Kubrick got interested in adapting the story, and with the help of then-journalist [[Jay Cocks]], bought the filming rights to the novel.<ref name=time>{{cite web|url=http://www-cgi.cnn.com/ASIANOW/time/asia/magazine/1999/990809/cover1.html|work=Time|date=August 9, 1999|title=All Eyes On Them|author=[[Richard Schickel|Schickel, Richard]]|accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref> In the 1970s, Kubrick had thought of [[Woody Allen]] as the Jewish protagonist.{{sfn|Rasmussen|2005|p=222}} For the following decade, Kubrick even considered making his ''Dream Story'' adaptation a sex comedy "with a wild and somber streak running through it", starring [[Steve Martin]] in the main role.<ref name=vf>[[Michael Herr|Herr, Michael]]. [http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/classic/features/kubrick-199908 CLASSIC HOLLYWOOD: Kubrick], ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' (August 1999)</ref> The project was only revived in 1994, when Kubrick hired [[Frederic Raphael]] to work on the script, updating the setting from 19th century Vienna to 20th century New York City.<ref name=ew/> Kubrick invited [[Michael Herr]], a personal friend who helped write ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'', for revisions, but Herr declined for fear that he would both be underpaid and would commit to an overlong production.<ref name=vf/>

===Adaptation===
[[Arthur Schnitzler]]'s 1926 novella ''[[Dream Story]]'' is set around [[Vienna]] shortly after the turn of the century. The main characters are a couple named Fridolin and Albertina; their home is a typical [[suburb]]an middle-class home, not the film's posh urban apartment. Schnitzler himself, like the protagonist of this novel, lived in Vienna, was Jewish, and a medical doctor, though Schnitzler eventually abandoned medicine for writing.

While Fridolin and Albertina, the protagonist couple of ''Dream Story'', are sometimes implied to be [[Judaism|Jewish]], there is nothing in the novella which justifies this assumption, and neither Fridolin nor Albertina are typical Jewish names; whereas Nachtigall (Nightingale) is overtly identified as Jewish. Kubrick (himself of Jewish descent) frequently removed references to the Jewishness of characters in the novels he adapted.<ref name=cocks29>{{harvnb|Cocks|2004|p=29}}</ref> In the case of ''Eyes Wide Shut'', Frederic Raphael (who is also Jewish) wanted to keep the Jewish background of the protagonists, but Kubrick insisted that they should be "vanilla" Americans, without any details that would arouse any presumptions. The director added that Bill should be a "[[Harrison Ford]]-ish goy", and created the surname of Harford as an allusion to the actor.{{sfn|Raphael|2000|p=59}} This is reflected in the way the film handles the way Bill Harford is taunted by college students when going home in the morning. In the film, Bill is taunted with [[Homophobia|homophobic]] slurs. In the novella, these boys are recognized to be members of an [[anti-Semitic]] college fraternity.<ref name=cocks29/><ref>Lowenberg, Peter. "Freud, Schnitzler, and Eyes Wide Shut," in ''[[#Depth|Depth of field: Stanley Kubrick, film, and the uses of history]]'' (2006), pp.&nbsp;255–279.</ref> Kubrick's co-screenwriter, Frederic Raphael, in an introduction to a Penguin Classics edition of ''Dream Story'', writes "Fridolin is not declared to be a Jew, but his feelings of cowardice, for failing to challenge his aggressor, echo the uneasiness of Austrian Jews in the face of Gentile provocation."<ref>{{cite book |title=Dream Story |last=Schnitzler |first=Arthur |authorlink= |author2=Fredric Raphael |year=1999 |publisher=Penguin |location= |isbn=0-14-118224-5 |page=xiii |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>

The novella is set during the [[Carnival]], when people often wear masks to parties. The party that both husband and wife attend at the opening of the story is a masked Carnival ball, whereas the film's story begins at Christmas time.

Critic Randy Rasmussen suggests that the character of Bill is fundamentally more naïve, strait-laced, less disclosing and more unconscious of his vindictive motives than his counterpart, Fridolin.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rasmussen|2005|p=331}}</ref> For Rasmussen and others, the film's Bill Harford is essentially sleep-walking through life with no deeper awareness of his surrounding. In the novella when his wife discloses a private sexual fantasy, he in turn admits one of his own (of a girl in her mid to late teens), while in the film he is simply shocked. The film's argument over whether he has fantasies over female patients and whether women have sexual fantasies is simply absent from the novella where both husband and wife assume the other has fantasies. In the film, Bill's estrangement from Alice revolves around her confessing a recent fantasy to him; in the novella both exchange fantasies after which she declares that in her youth she could have easily married someone else, which is what precipitates their sense of estrangement.

In the novella, the husband long suspected that his patient (Marion) was infatuated with him, while in the film it is a complete surprise and he seems shocked. He is also more overwhelmed by the orgy in the film than in the novella. Fridolin is socially bolder but less sexual with the prostitute (Mizzi in the novella, Domino in the film). Fridolin is also conscious of looking old in the novella, though he hardly does in the film.

In the novella, the party (which is sparsely attended) uses "Denmark" as the password for entrance; that is significant in that Albertina had her infatuation with her soldier in Denmark. The film's password is "Fidelio", from the Latin word for "faithful", and which is the title of [[Beethoven]]'s only opera (''[[Fidelio|Fidelio, or Married Love]]''). In early drafts of the screenplay, the password was "Fidelio Rainbow". Jonathan Rosenbaum notes that both passwords echo elements of one member of the couple's behaviour, though in opposite ways.<ref>Rosenbaum, Jonathan. "In Dreams Begin Responsibilities"; in ''[[#Depth|Depth of field: Stanley Kubrick, film, and the uses of history]]'' (2006), pp.&nbsp;245–254</ref> The party in the novella consists mostly of nude ballroom dancing.

In the novella the woman who "redeems" Fridolin at the party, saving him from punishment, is costumed as a nun, and most of the characters at the party are dressed as nuns or monks; Fridolin himself used a monk costume. This aspect was retained in the film's original screenplay,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.godamongdirectors.com/scripts/eyeswshu.htm |title=Eyes Wide Shut original screenplay |publisher=Godamongdirectors.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-22}}</ref> but was deleted in the filmed version.

In the novella, when the husband returns home, the wife's dream is an elaborate drama that concludes with him getting [[crucified]] in a village square after Fridolin refuses to separate from Albertina and become the paramour of the village princess, even though Albertina is now occupied with copulating with other men, and watches him "without pity". By being faithful, Fridolin thus fails to save himself from execution in Albertina's dream although he was apparently spared by the woman's "sacrifice" at the masked sex party. In both the novella and film, the wife states that the laugh in her sleep just before she woke was a laugh of scornful contempt for her husband; although awake she states this matter-of-factly. The novella makes it clear that Fridolin at this point hates Albertina more than ever, thinking they are now lying together "like mortal enemies". It has been argued that the dramatic climax of the novella is actually Albertina's dream, and the film has shifted the focus to Bill's visit to the secret society's orgy whose content is more shocking in the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clas.ufl.edu/ipsa/2003/Greenwich%20conference.html |title=Rainer J. Kaus, '&#39;Notes on Eyes Wide Shut'&#39; |publisher=Clas.ufl.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-22}}</ref>

The adaptation created a character with no counterpart in the novella: Ziegler, who represents both the high wealth and prestige to which Bill Harford aspires, and a connection between Bill's two worlds (his regular life, and the secret society organizing the ball).{{sfn|Chion|2002|p.21}} Critic Randy Rasmussen interprets Ziegler as representing Bill's worst self, much as in other Kubrick films; the title character in ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' represents the worst of the American national security establishment, Charles Grady represents the worst of [[Jack Torrance]] in ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', and Clare Quilty represents the worst of Humbert Humbert in ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rasmussen|2005|p=332}}</ref>

Ziegler's presence allows Kubrick to change the mechanics of the story in a few ways. In the film, Bill first meets his piano-playing friend at Ziegler's party, and then while wandering around town, seeks him out at the Sonata Café. In the novella, the café encounter with Nightingale is a delightful coincidence. Similarly, the dead woman whom Bill suspects of being the woman at the party who saved him is a baroness that he was acquainted with earlier, not a hooker at Ziegler's party.

More significantly, in the film, Ziegler gives a commentary on the whole story to Bill, including an explanation that the party incident, where Bill is apprehended, threatened, and ultimately redeemed by the woman's sacrifice, was staged. Whether this is to be believed or not, it is an exposition of Ziegler's view of the ways of the world as a member of the power elite.{{sfn|Cocks|2004 |p= 146}}

The novella explains why the husband's mask is on the pillow next to his sleeping wife, she having discovered it when it slipped out of his suitcase, and placing it there as a statement of understanding. This is left unexplained in the film and left to the viewer's interpretation.

===Casting===
When Warner Bros. president [[Terry Semel]] approved production, he asked Kubrick to cast a movie star, as "you haven't done that since [[Jack Nicholson]] [in ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'']."<ref name=time/> Cruise was in England because his wife [[Nicole Kidman]] was there shooting ''[[The Portrait of a Lady (film)|The Portrait of a Lady]]'', and eventually Cruise decided to visit Kubrick's estate with Kidman. After that meeting, the director awarded them the roles.<ref>{{cite video|title=Interview: Tom Cruise on Stanley Kubrick|location=Eyes Wide Shut Blu-Ray (2007)|date=1999|publisher=Warner Bros Home Entertainment}}</ref> [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] and [[Harvey Keitel]] each were cast and filmed by Kubrick. Due to scheduling conflicts both had to drop out<ref name=ew/> – first Keitel with ''[[Finding Graceland]]'',<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M-gCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA11 |title=Keitel's Heartbreak Hotel |publisher=Books.google.com |date=1997-04-21 |accessdate=2014-08-22}}</ref> then Leigh with ''[[eXistenZ]]''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-04-27/features/9904270063_1_existenz-allegra-geller-virtual-reality|title=Hyper 'Existenz'|date=April 27, 1999|first=Gary|last=Dretzka|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}</ref> – and their roles were replaced by Marie Richardson and Sydney Pollack in the final cut.<ref name=time/>

===Filming===
[[File:Mentmore Towers from angle.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Mentmore Towers]], one of the settings used by the film|alt=A mansion with four towers.]]
[[Principal photography]] began in November 1996. Kubrick's perfectionism led to script pages being rewritten on the set, and most scenes requiring numerous takes. The shoot went much longer than expected, with [[Vinessa Shaw]]—playing the HIV-positive prostitute—being initially contracted for two weeks but ending up working for two months.<ref name=ew/> The crew got exhausted.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20471622_289898,00.html|title=Closing Their 'Eyes Wide Shut'|work=Entertainment Weekly|first=Dave|last=Karger |date=Oct 17, 1997|accessdate=2012-10-27}}</ref> Filming finally wrapped in June 1998.<ref name=ew/> The ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' recognized ''Eyes Wide Shut'' as the longest constant movie shoot, "for over 15 months, a period that included an unbroken shoot of 46 weeks".<ref>{{cite book|title=''[[Guinness World Records]] 2001''|page=93|year=2000|isbn=0-85112-102-0}}</ref>

Given Kubrick's [[fear of flying]], the entire film was shot in England. Sound-stage works were done at London's [[Pinewood Studios]], which included a detailed recreation of [[Greenwich Village]].  Kubrick's perfectionism went as far as sending workmen to Manhattan to measure street widths and note newspaper vending machine locations. Real New York footage was also shot to be [[rear projection effect|rear projected]] behind Cruise. Production was followed by a strong campaign of secrecy, helped by Kubrick always working with a short team on set.<ref name=ew/> Outdoor locations included [[Hatton Garden]] for a Greenwich Village street,{{sfn|Adams|2000|p=24}} [[Hamleys]] for the toy store from the film's ending,{{sfn|Adams|2000|p=16}} and [[Mentmore Towers]] and [[Elveden Hall]] in Elveden, Suffolk, England for the mansion.<ref>{{cite book|page=70|title=The Worldwide Guide to Movie Locations|first=Tony|last=Reeves|publisher=Chicago Review Press|year=2001|isbn=1-55652-432-3}}</ref> Larry Smith, who had first served as a [[Gaffer (filmmaking)|gaffer]] on both ''[[Barry Lyndon]]'' and ''The Shining'', was chosen by Kubrick to be the film's [[cinematographer]]. Kubrick refused to use studio lighting, forcing Smith to use the available light sources visible in the shot, such as lamps and Christmas tree lights. When this was not adequate, Smith used Chinese paper ball lamps to softly brighten the scene. The color was enhanced by [[push processing]] the film reels, which helped bring out the intensity of color.<ref name=asc/>

Kubrick's perfectionism led him to overseeing every visual element that would appear in a given frame, from props and furniture to the color of walls and other objects.<ref name=asc>{{cite journal|url=http://www.theasc.com/magazine/oct99/sword/pg1.htm|title=A Sword in the Bed|first=Stephen|last=Pizzella|journal=[[American Cinematographer]]|issue=33|date=28 October 1999}}</ref> One such element were the masks used in the orgy, which were inspired by the masked Carnival balls visited by the protagonists of the novel. Costume designer Marit Allen explained that Kubrick felt they fit in that scene for being part of the imaginary world and ended up "creat[ing] the impression of menace, but without exaggeration". Many masks as used in the Venetian carnival were sent to London, and Kubrick separated who would wear each piece.{{sfn|Ciment|2003|p. 177}} The paintings of Kubrick's wife Christiane are featured on decoration.<ref>[http://sensesofcinema.com/2002/23/ornament/#b6 ''Eyes Wide Shut''], ''[[Senses of Cinema]]''</ref>

After shooting completed, Kubrick entered a prolonged post-production process. On March 1, 1999, Kubrick showed a cut to Cruise, Kidman, and the Warner Bros. executives. The director died six days later.<ref name="Jan Harlan"/>

==Music==
[[Jocelyn Pook]] wrote the original music for ''Eyes Wide Shut'', but like other Kubrick movies the film was noted for its usage of classical music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/eyes-wide-shut-mw0000242501|title=Eyes Wide Shut|author=Ruhlmann, William|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=2012-10-22}}</ref> The opening title music is [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]]'s "[[Suite for Variety Orchestra (Shostakovich)|Suite for Variety Stage Orchestra]]", misidentified as "[[Suite for Jazz Orchestra No. 2 (Shostakovich)|Waltz 2 from Jazz Suite]]".

Pook was hired after choreographer Yolande Snaith rehearsed the masked ball orgy scene using Pook's composition "Backwards Priests" – which features a [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] [[Divine Liturgy]] recorded in a church in [[Baia Mare]], played backwards – as a reference track. Kubrick then called the composer and asked if she had anything else "weird" like that song, which was reworked for the final cut of the scene, with the title "Masked Ball". Pook ended up composing and recording four pieces of music, many times based on her previous work, totaling 24 minutes. The composer's work ended up having mostly [[string instrument]]s – including a [[viola]]  played by Pook herself – with no [[brass instrument|brass]] or [[woodwind]]s as Pook "just couldn't justify these other textures", particularly as she wanted the tracks played on dialogue-heavy scenes to be "subliminal" and felt such instruments would be intrusive.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/27/style/27iht-pook.t.html|title=Kubrick's Approval Sets Seal on Classical Crossover Success : Pook's Unique Musical Mix|work=International Herald Tribune|first=Mike |last=Zwerin|date=1999-10-27|accessdate=2012-11-12}}</ref><ref name=pook>{{cite journal|url=http://www.runmovies.eu/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=311&Itemid=57 |title=Jocelyn Pook on EYES WIDE SHUT |first=Rudy|last=Koppl|journal=Soundtrack Magazine|volume=18|number=71|year=1999}}</ref>

==Themes and interpretation==

===Genre===
The film was described by some reviewers and partially marketed as an [[erotic thriller]], a categorization disputed by others. It is classified as such in the book ''The Erotic Thriller in Contemporary Cinema'' by [[Linda Ruth Williams]],<ref>p. 397 Book published by Indiana University Press, 2005</ref> and was described as such in two news articles about Cruise and Kidman's lawsuit over assertions they saw a sex therapist during filming.<ref>The film business newspaper ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117499540.html?categoryid=13&cs=1] and the UK ''[[The Guardian]]'' [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/1999/apr/24/ameliagentleman]</ref> The positive review in ''Combustible Celluloid'' describes it as an erotic thriller upon first viewing, but actually a "complex story about marriage and sexuality".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.combustiblecelluloid.com/archive/eyeswide.shtml |title=Combustible Celluloid Review - Eyes Wide Shut (1999) |first=Jeffrey M. |last=Anderson |publisher=Combustiblecelluloid.com |date=1999-07-16 |accessdate=2015-05-24}}</ref> Also positive was High-Def Digest, also calling it an erotic thriller.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bluray.highdefdigest.com/273/eyeswideshut.html |title=Blu-ray Review: Eyes Wide Shut &#124; High-Def Digest |publisher=Bluray.highdefdigest.com |accessdate=2012-07-02}}</ref>

===Christmas setting===
In addition to relocating the story from Vienna in the 1900s to New York City in the 1990s, Kubrick changed the time-frame of Schnitzler's story from Mardi Gras to Christmas. One critic believes Kubrick did this because of the rejuvenating symbolism of Christmas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reverseshot.com/article/eyes_wide_shut |title=Wake Up Call |author=Michael Koresky |date=Spring 2006 |work= |publisher=Reverse Shot |accessdate=15 December 2011}}</ref> Others have noted that Christmas lights allow Kubrick to employ some of his distinct methods of shooting including using source location lighting, as he did in ''Barry Lyndon''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Stanley Kubrick: a narrative and stylistic analysis |last=Falsetto |first=Mario |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |location= |isbn=<!--0275969746, -->9780275969745 |page=137 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}} See also the section on "Disappearing Film Grain" at [http://kubrickfilms.tripod.com/id79.html]</ref> The ''New York Times'' noted that the film "gives an otherworldly radiance and personality to Christmas lights",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/16/movies/film-review-bedroom-odyssey.html |title=Film Review; Bedroom Odyssey |author=Janet Maslin |year=1999 |work= |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=4 March 2015}}</ref> and similarly critic Randy Rasmussen notes that "colorful Christmas lights&nbsp;... illuminate almost every location in the film."<ref>{{cite book |title=Stanley Kubrick: Seven Films Analyzed |last=Rasmussen |first=Randy |authorlink= |year=2005 |publisher=McFarland |location= |isbn=<!--0786421525, -->9780786421527 |page=333 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> ''Harper'''s film critic, Lee Siegel, believes the film's recurring motif is the Christmas tree, because it symbolizes the way that "Compared with the everyday reality of sex and emotion, our fantasies of gratification are, yes, pompous and solemn in the extreme&nbsp;...

Critic Alonso Duralde in his book ''Have Yourself a Movie Little Christmas'' categorizes this film as a "Christmas movie for grownups" (as he also does with Bergman's ''[[Fanny and Alexander]]'' and ''[[The Lion in Winter (1968 film)|The Lion in Winter]]''), arguing that "Christmas weaves its way through the film from start to finish".<ref>{{cite book |title=Have Yourself a Movie Little Christmas |last=Duralde |first=Alonso |authorlink= |year=2010|publisher=Limelight Editions |location= |isbn=<!--0275969746, -->9780275969745 |page=33|pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Nelson notes that the sex ritual combines elements of Venetian Carnival and Catholic rites. (In particular, the character of "Red Cloak" simultaneously serves as Grand Inquisitor and King of Carnival.) As such, Nelson argues the sex ritual is a symbolic mirror of the darker truth behind the façade of Victor Ziegler's earlier Christmas party.{{sfn|Nelson|2000|pp=288–9}} Carolin Ruwe writing in her 2007 book ''Symbols in Stanley Kubrick's Movie 'Eyes Wide Shut' '' argues that the mask is the prime symbol of the film, the masks at Somerton mansion reflecting the masks that all wear in society,<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_dfKY3D7cuEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Eyes+Wide+Shut&lr=&cd=14#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Symbols in Stanley Kubrick's Movie 'Eyes Wide Shut' – Carolin Ruwe – Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2000-07-30 |accessdate=2012-07-02}}</ref> a point reinforced by Tim Kreider who notes the many masks in the prostitute's apartment and her having been renamed in the film "[[Domino mask|Domino]]" which is a style of Venetian mask.<ref name=krieder/>

==Release==

===Marketing===
Warner Bros. heavily promoted ''Eyes Wide Shut'', while following Kubrick's secrecy campaign – to the point the film's [[press kit]]s contained no production notes – and also the director's suggestions to Semel regarding the marketing campaign, given one week prior to Kubrick's death. The first footage was shown to theater owners attending the 1999 edition of the [[ShoWest]] convention in Las Vegas. TV spots featured both Isaak and Ligeti's songs from the soundtrack while revealing little about the movie's plot. The film also appeared on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, and on show business programs such as ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' and ''[[Access Hollywood]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jul/05/entertainment/ca-53039|title=The Way Kubrick Would Have Wanted

===Box office===
''Eyes Wide Shut'' opened on July 16, 1999 in the United States. The film topped the weekend box office with $21.7 million from 2,411 screens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=1999&wknd=29&p=.htm|title=Weekend Box Office: July 16–18, 1999 Weekend|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=2012-10-22}}</ref> These numbers surpassed the studio's expectations of $20 million, and became both Cruise's sixth consecutive chart topper and Kubrick's highest opening weekend. Audiences had a drop from Friday to Saturday, which analysts attributed to the news coverage of [[John F.

The international performances for ''Eyes Wide Shut'' were more positive, with Kubrick's long-time assistant and brother-in-law [[Jan Harlan]] stating that "It was badly received in the Anglo-Saxon world, but it was very well received in the Latin world and Japan.

===Critical reception===
''Eyes Wide Shut'' received positive reviews from critics and currently has a "Certified Fresh" score of 74% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 146 reviews with an average rating of 7.5 out of 10. The critical consensus states "Kubrick's intense study of the human psyche yields an impressive cinematic work."<ref>http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/eyes_wide_shut/</ref> The film also has a score of 68 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 33 critics indicating "Generally favorable reviews".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/eyes-wide-shut|title=Eyes Wide Shut Reviews|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=November 24, 2011}}</ref> Over 50 critics listed the film among the best of 1999.<ref name=press/>

Critics objected to two features. The first complaint was that the movie's pacing was too slow; while this may have been intended to convey a dream state, critics objected that it made actions and decisions seem labored. Second, reviewers commented that Kubrick had shot his NYC scenes in a studio and that New York "didn't look like New York". Writing about erotic mystery thrillers, writer Leigh Lundin comments that watching the dissolving marriage was painful and the backdrop of Christmas against the dark topic was disturbing, but "the oblique, well-told plot rewards an attentive viewer".<ref name="CB1">{{cite web|last=Lundin|first=Leigh |title=Erotic Mystery Thrillers |url=http://www.criminalbrief.com/?p=13152|work=sex-n-violence |publisher=Criminal Brief |date=25 July 2010 }}</ref>

[[Lee Siegel (cultural critic)|Lee Siegel]] from ''[[Harper's]]'' felt that most critics responded mainly to the marketing campaign and did not address the film on its own terms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indelibleinc.com/kubrick/films/ews/reviews/harpers.html |title=EYES WIDE SHUT What the critics failed to see in Kubrick's last film |publisher=Indelibleinc.com |accessdate=2012-07-02}}</ref> Others felt that American censorship took an esoteric film and made it even harder to understand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moviecitynews.com/festivals/sundance_2006/dp_060125.html |title=For Movie Folks Who Considered Burning Down The Ratings Board When The Adjustment Was Enuf |publisher=Movie City News |date=26 January 2006 |accessdate=15 April 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071224055634/http://www.moviecitynews.com/festivals/sundance_2006/dp_060125.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 24 December 2007}}</ref> Reviewer [[James Berardinelli]] stated that it was arguably one of Kubrick's best films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reelviews.net/movies/e/eyes_wide.html |title=Review: Eyes Wide Shut |publisher=Reelviews.net |date=1999-03-07 |accessdate=2012-07-02}}</ref> Writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', reviewer [[Janet Maslin]] commented "This is a dead-serious film about sexual yearnings, one that flirts with ridicule yet sustains its fundamental eeriness and gravity throughout.

On the television show ''[[At the Movies (U.S. TV series)|Roger Ebert & the Movies]]'', director [[Martin Scorsese]] named ''Eyes Wide Shut'' his fourth-favorite film of the 1990s.<ref>[http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/index2.html?sec=7&subsec=29 Ebert and Roeper]</ref> For the introduction to [[Michel Ciment]]'s ''Kubrick: The Definitive Edition'', Scorsese wrote: "When ''Eyes Wide Shut'' came out a few months after Stanley Kubrick's death in 1999, it was severely misunderstood, which came as no surprise. If you go back and look at the contemporary reactions to any Kubrick picture (except the earliest ones), you'll see that all his films were initially misunderstood. Then, after five or ten years came the realization that ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001]]'' or ''[[Barry Lyndon]]'' or ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' was like nothing else before or since."{{sfn|Ciment|2003|p. viii}} Mystery writer and commentator Jon Breen agrees.<ref name="CB1" /> In 2012, [[Slant Magazine]] ranked the film #2 on its list of the 100 Best Films of the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/feature/the-100-best-films-of-the-1990s/334/page_10 |title=The 100 Best Films of the 1990s |publisher=Slantmagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-22}}</ref> The [[BBC]] listed it number 61 on their 100 greatest American films of all time time.<ref>http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20150720-the-100-greatest-american-films</ref>

===Home media===
''Eyes Wide Shut'' was first released in [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] on March 7, 2000.<ref name=press>{{cite press release|url=http://kubrickfilms.warnerbros.com/news/press/ews_pressrelease.html|title="Kubrick's Definitive Film & Haunting Final Masterpiece" and 1999's Most Talked About Film Debuts on VHS and DVD|publisher=Warner Bros. Home Entertainment|date=February 24, 2000|accessdate=2012-11-09}}</ref> The original DVD release corrects technical gaffes, including a reflected crew member, and altering a piece of Alice Harford's dialogue. Most home videos remove the verse that was claimed to be cited from the sacred Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita (although it was Pook's reworking of "Backwards Priests" as stated above.)

On October 23, 2007, [[Warner Home Video]] released ''Eyes Wide Shut'' in a special edition DVD, plus the [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] Disc formats.<ref>{{cite web|last=McCutcheon |first=David |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/08/03/kubrick-overload |title=Kubrick Overload! |publisher=IGN |date=2007-08-03 |accessdate=2014-08-22}}</ref> This is the first home video release that presents the film in anamorphic 1.78:1 (16:9) format (note that the film was shown theatrically as soft matted 1.66:1 in Europe and 1.85:1 in the USA and Japan). The previous DVD release used a 1.33:1 (4:3) aspect ratio. It is also the first American home video release to feature the uncut version. Although the earliest American DVD of the uncut version states on the cover that it includes both the R-rated and unrated editions, in actuality only the unrated edition is on the DVD.

==Controversies==

===Kubrick's opinion===
[[Jan Harlan]], Kubrick's brother-in-law and executive producer, reported that Kubrick was "very happy" with the film and considered it to be his "greatest contribution to the art of cinema".<ref>{{cite web|author=DVDTalk.com - news, reviews, bargains, and discussion forum |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/janharlaninterview.html |title=On Kubrick – A Talk With Kubrick Documentarian Jan Harlan |publisher=Dvdtalk.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://timessquare.com/Film/Film_Interviews/Jan_Harlan_Keeps_His_Eyes_Wide_Open_On_New_Ideas/ |title=Jan Harlan Keeps His Eyes Wide Open On New Ideas &#124; Times Square New York City |publisher=Timessquare.com |date=2007-11-07 |accessdate=2012-07-02}}</ref>

[[R. Lee Ermey]], an actor in Kubrick's film ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'', claimed that Kubrick phoned him two weeks before his death to express his despondency over ''Eyes Wide Shut''. "He told me it was a piece of shit", Ermey said in ''Radar'' magazine, "and that he was disgusted with it and that the critics were going to 'have him for lunch'. He said Cruise and Kidman had their way with him – exactly the words he used."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://filmdrunk.uproxx.com/2010/03/kubrick-says-cruise-kidman-ruined-eyes-wide-shut|title=''Kubrick says Cruise and Kidman ruined EWS''}}</ref>

According to [[Todd Field]], Kubrick's friend and an actor in ''Eyes Wide Shut'', Ermey's claims do not accurately reflect Kubrick's essential attitude. Field's response appeared in a 26 October 2006 interview with Slashfilm.com:<ref>[http://www.slashfilm.com/article.php?story=20061024toddfieldinterview2&query Interview: Todd Field Part 2 – /FILM]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref>

<blockquote>The polite thing would be to say 'No comment'. But the truth is that&nbsp;... let's put it this way, you've never seen two actors more completely subservient and prostrate themselves at the feet of a director. Stanley was absolutely thrilled with the film. He was still working on the film when he died. And he probably died because he finally relaxed. It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, right before he died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, like he did on all of his films. But I know that from people around him personally, my partner who was his assistant for thirty years. And I thought about R. Lee Ermey for ''[[In the Bedroom]]''. And I talked to Stanley a lot about that film, and all I can say is Stanley was adamant that I shouldn't work with him for all kinds of reasons that I won't get into because there is no reason to do that to anyone, even if they are saying slanderous things that I know are completely untrue.</blockquote>

In a [[reddit]] "Ask Me Anything" session, Stanley Kubrick's daughter, Katharina Kubrick, claimed that her father was very proud of the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134rvs/stanley_kubricks_daughter_katharina_kubrick_and/c70tgdp |title=littleroom comments on Stanley Kubrick's daughter Katharina Kubrick, and grandson Joe. AMA |publisher=Reddit.com |date=2012-11-13 |accessdate=2014-08-22}}</ref> She also discredited Ermey's claims, saying to a user who asked about Kubrick's alleged comments, "[not to] believe that for a second."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134rvs/stanley_kubricks_daughter_katharina_kubrick_and/c70tkzu |title=seluropnek comments on Stanley Kubrick's daughter Katharina Kubrick, and grandson Joe.

===Studio censorship and classification===
Citing contractual obligations to deliver an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R rating]], [[Warner Bros.]] digitally altered the orgy for the American release, [[censorship|blocking out]] graphic sexuality by inserting additional figures to obscure the view, avoiding an adults-only [[NC-17]] rating that limited distribution, as some large American theaters and video store operators disallow films with that rating. This alteration antagonized film critics and cinephiles,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/film/072899eyes-movie.html | work=The New York Times | title=Critics Assail Ratings Board Over 'Eyes Wide Shut'}}</ref> as they argued that Kubrick had never been shy about ratings (''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' was originally given an [[X-rated|X-rating]]). The unrated version of ''Eyes Wide Shut'' was released in the United States on 23 October 2007 in DVD, [[HD DVD]], and [[Blu-ray Disc]] formats.

The version in South America, Europe and Australia featured the orgy scene intact (theatrical and DVD release) with ratings mostly for people of 18+. In New Zealand and in Europe<!--at least German-language TV stations-->, the uncensored version has been shown on television with some controversy. In Australia, it was broadcast on [[Network Ten]] with the alterations in the American version for an MA rating, blurring and cutting explicit sexuality.

[[Roger Ebert]] objected to the technique of using digital images to mask the action. He said it "should not have been done at all" and it is "symbolic of the moral hypocrisy of the rating system that it would force a great director to compromise his vision, while by the same process making his adult film more accessible to young viewers."<ref name="Eyes Wide Shut">Roger Ebert's review of [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19990716/REVIEWS/907160302/1023 Eyes Wide Shut]</ref> Although Ebert has been frequently cited as calling the standard North American R-rated version the "[[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]]" version of ''Eyes Wide Shut'' – referencing two scenes in ''[[Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery]]'' in which, through camera angles and coincidences, sexual body parts are blocked from view in a comical way<ref>See [http://www.reelviews.net/reelviews/eyes-wide-shut Reel Views ''Eyes Wide Shut''], [http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/07.15.99/eyeswideshut-9928.html MetroActive ''Eyes Wide Shut''] and [http://www.filmblather.com/review.php?n=eyeswideshut FilmBlather, ''Eyes Wide Shut'']</ref> – his review stated that this joke referred to an early rough draft of the altered scene, never publicly released.<ref name="Eyes Wide Shut"/>
