They go to a Christmas party thrown by a wealthy patient, Victor Ziegler (<link><target>Sydney Pollack</target></link>). Bill meets an old friend from medical school, Nick Nightingale (<link><target>Todd Field</target></link>), who now plays piano professionally. While a Hungarian man named Sandor Szavost (<link><target>Sky du Mont</target></link>) tries to pick up Alice, two young models try to take Bill off for a tryst. He is interrupted by a call from his host upstairs, who had been having sex with Mandy (<link><target>Julienne Davis</target></link>), a young woman who has overdosed on a<space/><link><target>Speedball (drug)</target><part>speedball</part></link>. Mandy recovers with Bill's aid.</paragraph><paragraph>The next evening at home, while smoking<space/><link><target>cannabis (drug)</target><part>cannabis</part></link>, Alice asks him if he had sex with the two girls. After Bill reassures her, she asks if he is ever jealous of men who are attracted to her. As the discussion gets heated, he states that he thinks women are more faithful than men. She rebuts him, telling him of a recent fantasy she had about a naval officer they had encountered on a vacation. Disturbed by Alice's revelation, Bill is then called by the daughter of a patient who has just died; he then heads over to her place. In her pain, Marion Nathanson (<link><target>Marie Richardson</target></link>) impulsively kisses him and says she loves him. Putting her off before her fiance Carl (<link><target>Thomas Gibson</target></link>) arrives, Bill takes a walk. He meets a prostitute named Domino (<link><target>Vinessa Shaw</target></link>) and goes to her apartment.</paragraph><paragraph>Alice phones just as Domino begins to kiss Bill, after which he calls off the awkward encounter. Meeting Nick at the jazz club where he's just finishing his last set, Bill learns that Nick has an engagement where he must play piano blindfolded. Bill presses for details. He learns that to gain admittance, one needs a costume, a mask, and the password (which Nick writes down for him). Bill goes to a costume shop. He offers the owner, Mr. Milich (<link><target>Rade Serbedzija</target></link>), a generous amount of money to rent a costume. In the shop, Milich catches his teenage daughter (<link><target>Leelee Sobieski</target></link>) with two Japanese men and expresses outrage at their lack of a sense of decency.</paragraph><paragraph>Bill takes a taxi to the country mansion mentioned by Nick. He gives the password and discovers a quasi-religious sexual ritual is taking place. Although he is masked, a woman takes Bill aside and warns him he does not belong there, insisting he is in terrible danger. She is then whisked away by someone else, so Bill spends some time wandering from room to room in the mansion, where groups of masked people are engaged in various types of sexual acts, while others watch. He is then interrupted by a porter who tells Bill that the taxi driver wants to speak urgently with him at the front door. However, the porter takes him to the ritual room, where a disguised red-cloaked<space/><link><target>Master of ceremonies</target><part>Master of Ceremonies</part></link><space/>confronts Bill with a question about a second password. Bill says he has forgotten. The Master of Ceremonies insists that Bill &quot;kindly remove his mask&quot;, then his clothes. The masked woman who had tried to warn Bill now intervenes and insists that she be punished instead of him. Bill is ushered from the mansion and warned not to tell anyone about what happened there.</paragraph><paragraph>Just before dawn, Bill arrives home guilty and confused. He finds Alice laughing loudly in her sleep and awakens her. While crying, she tells him of a troubling dream in which she was having sex with the naval officer and many other men, and laughing at the idea of Bill seeing her with them. The next morning, Bill goes to Nick's hotel, where the desk clerk (<link><target>Alan Cumming</target></link>) tells Bill that a bruised and frightened Nick checked out a few hours earlier after returning with two large, dangerous-looking men. Nick tried to pass an envelope to the clerk when they were leaving, but it was intercepted, and Nick was driven away by the two men.</paragraph><paragraph>Bill goes to return the costume but not the mask, which he has misplaced and Milich, with his daughter by his side, states he can do other favors for Bill &quot;and it needn't be a costume.&quot; The same two Japanese men leave; Milich implies to Bill that he has sold his daughter for prostitution. Bill returns to the country mansion in his own car and is met at the gate by a man with a note warning him to<space/><link><target>cease and desist</target></link><space/>his inquiries. At home, Bill thinks about Alice's dream while watching her tutor their daughter.</paragraph><paragraph>Bill reconsiders his sexual offers the night before. He first phones Marion, but hangs up after Carl answers the phone. Bill then goes to Domino's apartment with a gift. Her roommate Sally (<link><target>Fay Masterson</target></link>) is home, but not Domino. After Bill attempts to seduce Sally, she reveals to him that Domino has just tested positive for<space/><link><target>HIV</target></link>. Bill leaves and notices a man is following him. After reading a newspaper story about a beauty queen who died of a drug overdose, Bill views the body at the morgue and identifies it as Mandy. Bill is summoned to Ziegler's house, where he is confronted with the events of the past night and day. Ziegler was one of those involved with the ritual orgy, and identified Bill and his connection with Nick. His own position with the secret society has been jeopardized by Bill's intrusion since Ziegler recommended Nick for the job.</paragraph><paragraph>Ziegler claims that he had Bill followed for his own protection, and that the warnings made against Bill by the society are only intended to scare him from speaking about the orgy. But he implies the society is capable of acting on their threats, telling Bill: &quot;If I told you their names, I don't think you'd sleep so well&quot;. Bill asks about the death of Mandy, whom Ziegler has identified as the masked woman at the party who'd &quot;sacrificed&quot; herself to prevent Bill's punishment, and about the disappearance of Nick, the piano player. Ziegler insists that Nick is safely back at his home in<space/><link><target>Seattle</target></link>. Ziegler also says the &quot;punishment&quot; was a charade by the secret society to further frighten Bill, and it had nothing to do with Mandy's death; she was a hooker and addict and had indeed died from another accidental drug overdose. Bill clearly does not know if Ziegler is telling him the truth about Nick's disappearance or Mandy's death, but he says nothing further and lets the matter drop.</paragraph><paragraph>When he returns home, Bill finds the rented mask on his pillow next to his sleeping wife. He breaks down in tears and decides to tell Alice the whole truth of the past two days. The next morning, they go Christmas shopping with their daughter. Alice muses that they should be grateful they have survived, that she loves him, and there is something they must do as soon as possible. When Bill asks what it may be, she simply says: &quot;Fuck&quot;.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Cast</heading><paragraph><template><target>col-begin</target></template><template><target>col-break</target></template></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Tom Cruise</target></link><space/>as Dr. William &quot;Bill&quot; Harford</listitem><listitem><link><target>Nicole Kidman</target></link><space/>as Alice Harford</listitem><listitem><link><target>Sydney Pollack</target></link><space/>as Victor Ziegler</listitem><listitem><link><target>Marie Richardson</target></link><space/>as Marion Nathanson</listitem><listitem><link><target>Todd Field</target></link><space/>as Nick Nightingale</listitem><listitem><link><target>Sky du Mont</target></link><space/>as Sandor Szavost</listitem><listitem><link><target>Rade erbedija</target></link><space/>as Mr. Milich</listitem></list><paragraph><template><target>col-break</target><arg name="gap">4em</arg></template></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Vinessa Shaw</target></link><space/>as Domino</listitem><listitem><link><target>Fay Masterson</target></link><space/>as Sally</listitem><listitem><link><target>Leelee Sobieski</target></link><space/>as Milich's daughter</listitem><listitem><link><target>Alan Cumming</target></link><space/>as Hotel desk clerk</listitem><listitem><link><target>Leon Vitali</target></link><space/>as Red Cloak</listitem><listitem><link><target>Julienne Davis</target></link><space/>as Amanda &quot;Mandy&quot; Curran</listitem><listitem><link><target>Thomas Gibson</target></link><space/>as Carl Thomas</listitem></list><paragraph><template><target>col-end</target></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>Production</heading><heading level='3'>Development</heading><paragraph>While<space/><link><target>Stanley Kubrick</target></link><space/>was interested in making a film about sexual relations as early as 1962, during production of<space/><italics><link><target>Dr. Strangelove</target></link></italics>,<extension extension_name='ref' name="ew"><template><target>cite news</target><arg name="url">http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20471622_272431,00.html</arg><arg name="title">Behind the scenes of ''Eyes Wide Shut''</arg><arg name="first">Benjamin</arg><arg name="last">Svetkey<space/></arg><arg name="date">July 23, 1999</arg><arg name="work">[[Entertainment Weekly]]</arg><arg name="accessdate">2012-10-24</arg></template></extension><space/>the project only took off after he read<space/><link><target>Arthur Schnitzler</target></link>'s<space/><italics><link><target>Dream Story</target></link></italics><space/>in 1968, when he was seeking a work to follow on<space/><italics><link><target>2001: A Space Odyssey (film)</target><part>2001: A Space Odyssey</part></link></italics>.

The main characters are a couple named Fridolin and Albertina; their home is a typical<space/><link><target>suburb</target><trail>an</trail></link><space/>middle-class home, not the film's posh urban apartment. Schnitzler himself, like the protagonist of this novel, lived in Vienna, was Jewish, and a medical doctor, though Schnitzler eventually abandoned medicine for writing.</paragraph><paragraph>While Fridolin and Albertina, the protagonist couple of<space/><italics>Dream Story</italics>, are sometimes implied to be<space/><link><target>Judaism</target><part>Jewish</part></link>, there is nothing in the novella which justifies this assumption, and neither Fridolin nor Albertina are typical Jewish names; whereas Nachtigall (Nightingale) is overtly identified as Jewish.

The party that both husband and wife attend at the opening of the story is a masked Carnival ball, whereas the film's story begins at Christmas time.</paragraph><paragraph>Critic Randy Rasmussen suggests that the character of Bill is fundamentally more nave, strait-laced, less disclosing and more unconscious of his vindictive motives than his counterpart, Fridolin.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Harvnb</target><arg>Rasmussen</arg><arg>2005</arg><arg name="p">331</arg></template></extension><space/>For Rasmussen and others, the film's Bill Harford is essentially sleep-walking through life with no deeper awareness of his surrounding. In the novella when his wife discloses a private sexual fantasy, he in turn admits one of his own (of a girl in her mid to late teens), while in the film he is simply shocked. The film's argument over whether he has fantasies over female patients and whether women have sexual fantasies is simply absent from the novella where both husband and wife assume the other has fantasies. In the film, Bill's estrangement from Alice revolves around her confessing a recent fantasy to him; in the novella both exchange fantasies after which she declares that in her youth she could have easily married someone else, which is what precipitates their sense of estrangement.</paragraph><paragraph>In the novella, the husband long suspected that his patient (Marion) was infatuated with him, while in the film it is a complete surprise and he seems shocked. He is also more overwhelmed by the orgy in the film than in the novella. Fridolin is socially bolder but less sexual with the prostitute (Mizzi in the novella, Domino in the film). Fridolin is also conscious of looking old in the novella, though he hardly does in the film.</paragraph><paragraph>In the novella, the party (which is sparsely attended) uses &quot;Denmark&quot; as the password for entrance; that is significant in that Albertina had her infatuation with her soldier in Denmark. The film's password is &quot;Fidelio&quot;, from the Latin word for &quot;faithful&quot;, and which is the title of<space/><link><target>Beethoven</target></link>'s only opera (<italics><link><target>Fidelio</target><part>Fidelio, or Married Love</part></link></italics>). In early drafts of the screenplay, the password was &quot;Fidelio Rainbow&quot;. Jonathan Rosenbaum notes that both passwords echo elements of one member of the couple's behaviour, though in opposite ways.<extension extension_name='ref'>Rosenbaum, Jonathan. &quot;In Dreams Begin Responsibilities&quot;; in<space/><italics><link><target>#Depth</target><part>Depth of field: Stanley Kubrick, film, and the uses of history</part></link></italics><space/>(2006), pp.&amp;nbsp;245254</extension><space/>The party in the novella consists mostly of nude ballroom dancing.</paragraph><paragraph>In the novella the woman who &quot;redeems&quot; Fridolin at the party, saving him from punishment, is costumed as a nun, and most of the characters at the party are dressed as nuns or monks; Fridolin himself used a monk costume. This aspect was retained in the film's original screenplay,<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.godamongdirectors.com/scripts/eyeswshu.htm<space/></arg><arg name="title">Eyes Wide Shut original screenplay<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Godamongdirectors.com<space/></arg><arg name="date"><space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2014-08-22</arg></template></extension><space/>but was deleted in the filmed version.</paragraph><paragraph>In the novella, when the husband returns home, the wife's dream is an elaborate drama that concludes with him getting<space/><link><target>crucified</target></link><space/>in a village square after Fridolin refuses to separate from Albertina and become the paramour of the village princess, even though Albertina is now occupied with copulating with other men, and watches him &quot;without pity&quot;. By being faithful, Fridolin thus fails to save himself from execution in Albertina's dream although he was apparently spared by the woman's &quot;sacrifice&quot; at the masked sex party. In both the novella and film, the wife states that the laugh in her sleep just before she woke was a laugh of scornful contempt for her husband; although awake she states this matter-of-factly. The novella makes it clear that Fridolin at this point hates Albertina more than ever, thinking they are now lying together &quot;like mortal enemies&quot;. It has been argued that the dramatic climax of the novella is actually Albertina's dream, and the film has shifted the focus to Bill's visit to the secret society's orgy whose content is more shocking in the film.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.clas.ufl.edu/ipsa/2003/Greenwich%20conference.html<space/></arg><arg name="title">Rainer J.

In the film, Bill first meets his piano-playing friend at Ziegler's party, and then while wandering around town, seeks him out at the Sonata Caf. In the novella, the caf encounter with Nightingale is a delightful coincidence. Similarly, the dead woman whom Bill suspects of being the woman at the party who saved him is a baroness that he was acquainted with earlier, not a hooker at Ziegler's party.</paragraph><paragraph>More significantly, in the film, Ziegler gives a commentary on the whole story to Bill, including an explanation that the party incident, where Bill is apprehended, threatened, and ultimately redeemed by the woman's sacrifice, was staged. Whether this is to be believed or not, it is an exposition of Ziegler's view of the ways of the world as a member of the power elite.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Cocks</arg><arg>2004<space/></arg><arg name="p"><space/>146</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>The novella explains why the husband's mask is on the pillow next to his sleeping wife, she having discovered it when it slipped out of his suitcase, and placing it there as a statement of understanding.
