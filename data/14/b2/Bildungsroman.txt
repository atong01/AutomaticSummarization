In [[literary criticism]], a '''''Bildungsroman''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈbɪldʊŋs.ʁoˌmaːn}}; {{lang-de|"novel of formation / education / culture"}}),{{efn|group=lower-alpha|Engel explains that the term has in recent years been applied to very different novels but originally meant a novel of formation of a character, of an individual personality in interaction (including conflict) with society. He also points out that it was, like the "novel of education" (''Erziehungsroman''), a subgenre of the "novel of development" (''Entwicklungsroman'').{{sfn|Engel|2008|pp=263–266}}}} '''novel of formation''', '''novel of education''',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/65244/bildungsroman |title=Bildungsroman: German literary genre |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=April 22, 2013}}</ref> or '''coming-of-age story''' (though it may also be known as a subset of the [[coming-of-age story]]) is a literary genre that focuses on the psychological and moral growth of the [[protagonist]] from youth to adulthood ([[coming of age]]),{{sfn|Lynch|1999}} in which character change is extremely important.{{sfn|Bakhtin|1996|p=21}}{{sfn|Jeffers|2005|p=2}}

==Origin==
The term was coined in 1819 by [[Philology|philologist]] [[Karl Morgenstern]] in his university lectures, and later famously reprised by [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], who legitimated it in 1870 and popularized it in 1905.{{sfn|Engel|2008|pp=263–266}} {{sfn|Summerfield|2010|p=1}} The genre is further characterized by a number of formal, topical, and thematic features.<ref>{{cite web |last=Iversen |first=Annikin Teines |year=2010 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/10037/2486 |title=Change and Continuity; The Bildungsroman in English |location=University of Tromsø |publisher=Munin open research archive}}</ref> The term coming-of-age novel is sometimes used interchangeably with ''Bildungsroman'', but its use is usually wider and less technical.

The birth of the ''Bildungsroman'' is normally dated to the publication of ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship]]'' by [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] in 1795–96.{{sfn|Jeffers|2005|p=49}} Although the ''Bildungsroman'' arose in Germany, it has had extensive influence first in Europe and later throughout the world. [[Thomas Carlyle]] translated Goethe’s novel into English, and after its publication in 1824, many British authors wrote novels inspired by it.<ref>Buckley, J. H.

The genre translates fairly directly into cinematic form, the [[coming-of-age film]].

==Plot outline==
A ''Bildungsroman'' relates the growing up or "coming of age" of a sensitive person who goes in search of answers to life's questions with the expectation that these will result from gaining experience of the world. The genre evolved from folklore tales of a [[dunce]] or youngest son going out in the world to seek his fortune. Usually in the beginning of the story there is an emotional loss which makes the protagonist leave on his journey. In a ''Bildungsroman'', the goal is maturity, and the protagonist achieves it gradually and with difficulty. The genre often features a main conflict between the main character and society. Typically, the values of society are gradually accepted by the protagonist and he/she is ultimately accepted into society — the protagonist's mistakes and disappointments are over. In some works, the protagonist is able to reach out and help others after having achieved maturity.

There are many variations and subgenres of ''Bildungsroman'' that focus on the growth of an individual. An ''Entwicklungsroman'' ("development novel") is a story of general growth rather than self-cultivation. An ''Erziehungsroman'' ("education novel") focuses on training and formal schooling,{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} while a ''[[Künstlerroman]]'' ("artist novel") is about the development of an artist and shows a growth of the self.<ref name="Werlock2010p387">{{cite web |author=Werlock, James P. |year=2010 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lWuyTK_0eBsC&pg=PA387 |title=The Facts on File companion to the American short story |volume=2 |page=387}}</ref>
