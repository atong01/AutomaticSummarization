'''Dr. Aloysius "Alois" Alzheimer''' ({{IPA-de|ˈaːloˌis  ˈalts.haɪmɐ|lang}}; 14 June 1864 – 19 December 1915) was a [[Bavaria]]n-born  [[Germany|German]] [[psychiatrist]] and [[neuropathologist]] and a colleague of [[Emil Kraepelin]]. Alzheimer is credited with identifying the first published case of "presenile dementia", which Kraepelin would later identify as [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref>Berrios G E (1991) Alzheimer’s Disease: A Conceptual History. ''International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry'' 5: 355-365</ref>

==Biography==
Aloysius Alzheimer was born in [[Marktbreit]], [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]] on 14 June 1864.<ref name=zilka>{{cite journal|last=Zilka|first=N.|author2=M. Novak|title=The tangled story of Alois Alzheimer|journal=Bratisl Lek Listy|year=2006|volume=107|issue=9-10|pages=343–345|url=http://www.bmj.sk/2006/107910-02.pdf|accessdate=4 September 2012}}</ref> His father served in the office of [[notary public]] in the family's hometown.<ref>[http://www.marktbreit.de/kultur_bildung/alzheimer_engl.htm "Marktbreit: Alzheimer´s Birthplace"]</ref>

Alzheimer attended  [[Aschaffenburg]], [[University of Tübingen|Tübingen]], [[Humboldt University Berlin|Berlin]], and [[University of Würzburg|Würzburg]] universities. He received a medical degree from Würzburg University in 1886. The following year, he spent five months assisting mentally ill women, before he took an office in the city mental asylum in [[Frankfurt am Main]]: the Städtische Anstalt für Irre und Epileptische (Asylum for Lunatics and Epileptics). [[:de:Emil Sioli|Emil Sioli]], a noted psychiatrist, was the dean of the asylum. Another neurologist, [[Franz Nissl]], began to work in the same asylum with Alzheimer, and they knew each other. Much of Alzheimer's later work on brain pathology made use of Nissl's method of silver staining of the [[histological]] sections. Alzheimer was the co-founder and co-publisher of the journal ''Zeitschrift für die gesamte Neurologie und Psychiatrie'', though he never wrote a book that he could call his own.
In 1901, Dr. Alzheimer observed a patient at the Frankfurt Asylum named [[Auguste Deter]]. The 51-year-old patient had strange behavioral symptoms, including a loss of short-term memory. This patient would become his obsession over the coming years. In April 1906, Mrs. Deter died and Alzheimer had her medical records and brain brought to Munich where he was working at Kraepelin's lab.  With two Italian physicians, he used the staining techniques to identify [[amyloid]] plaques and [[neurofibrillary tangles]]. A speech given on 3 November 1906 was the first time the pathology and the clinical symptoms of presenile dementia were presented together.<ref name="AlzBook">{{cite book|author =Maurer K., Maurer U.|title=Alzheimer: The Life of a Physician and Career of a Disease|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2003|location=New York|isbn=0-231-11896-1}}</ref> Through extremely fortunate circumstances the original microscope preparations on which Alzheimer based his description of the disease were rediscovered some years ago in Munich and his findings could thus be reevaluated.<ref name="Graeber">{{cite journal|author=Graeber MB, Koesel S, Egensperger R, Banati RB, Mueller U, Bise K, Hoff P, Moeller HJ, Fujisawa K, Mehraein P|title=Rediscovery of the case described by Alois Alzheimer in 1911: historical, histological and molecular genetic analysis|journal=Neurogenetics|volume=1|pages=73–80|year=1997|doi = 10.1007/s100480050011|pmid=10735278 |issue=1}}</ref>[[File:Alzheimer-ffm001.jpg|left|thumb|100px|Alzheimer's grave in Frankfurt]]

Since [[German language|German]] was the [[lingua franca]] of science{{fact|date=January 2015}} (and especially of psychiatry) at that time, Kraepelin's use of Alzheimer's disease in a textbook made the name famous. By 1911, his description of the disease was being used by European physicians to diagnose patients in the US.<ref name="AlzBook"/>

In August 1912, Dr. Alzheimer fell ill on the train on his way to the [[University of Breslau]], where he had been appointed professor of psychiatry in July 1912. Most probably he had a [[streptococcal]] infection and subsequent [[rheumatic fever]] leading to valvular heart disease, [[heart failure]] and [[kidney failure]]. He never recovered completely from this illness. He died of [[heart failure]] on 19 December 1915, at the age of 51 in [[Breslau]], [[Silesia Province|Silesia]], presently [[Wrocław]], [[Poland]]. He was buried on 23 December 1915 next to his wife Cecilie in the [[Frankfurt Main Cemetery|Hauptfriedhof in Frankfurt am Main]].
