According to the London IPO filings, the management team was Philippe Kahn as President, Spencer Ozawa as VP of Operations, Marie Bourget as CFO, and Spencer Leyton as VP of sales and business development, while all software development was continuing to take place in Denmark and later London as the Danish co-founders moved there. A first US IPO followed in 1989 after Ben Rosen joined the Borland board with<space/><link><target>Goldman Sachs</target></link><space/>as the lead banker and a second offering in 1991 with Lazard as the lead banker. All offerings were very successful and over-subscribed.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1985 Borland acquired Analytica and its<space/><link><target>Borland Reflex</target><part>Reflex</part></link><space/>database product. The engineering team of Analytica, managed by<space/><link><target>Brad Silverberg</target></link><space/>and including Reflex co-founder<space/><link><target>Adam Bosworth</target></link>, became the core of Borland's engineering team in the USA.

Adam Bosworth initiated and headed up the<space/><link><target>Quattro Pro</target><part>Quattro</part></link><space/>project until moving to Microsoft later in 1990 to take over the project which eventually became<space/><link><target>Microsoft Access</target><part>Access</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1987 Borland purchased Wizard Systems and incorporated portions of the Wizard C technology into<space/><link><target>Turbo C</target></link>. Bob Jervis, the author of Wizard C became a Borland employee. Turbo C was released on May 18, 1987, and an estimated 100,000 copies were shipped in the first month of its release. This apparently drove a wedge between Borland and Niels Jensen and the other members of his team who had been working on a brand new series of compilers at their London development centre. An agreement was reached and they spun off a company called Jensen &amp; Partners International(JPI), later<space/><link><target>TopSpeed</target></link>. JPI first launched a MS-DOS compiler named JPI Modula-2, that later became TopSpeed Modula-2, and followed up with TopSpeed C, TopSpeed C++ and TopSpeed Pascal compilers for both the MS-DOS and OS/2 operating systems. The TopSpeed compiler technology exists today as the underlying technology of the<space/><link><target>Clarion (programming language)</target><part>Clarion</part></link><space/>4GL programming language, a Windows development tool.</paragraph><paragraph>In September 1987 Borland purchased Ansa-Software, including their<space/><link><target>Borland Paradox</target><part>Paradox</part></link><space/>(version 2.0)<space/><link><target>database</target></link><space/>management tool.

This allowed the developer/user to utilize its products &quot;just like a book&quot;; he or she was allowed to make multiple copies of a program, as long as only one copy was in use at any point in time.</paragraph><heading level='3'>The 1990s: Rise and change</heading><paragraph>In September 1991 Borland purchased<space/><link><target>Ashton-Tate</target></link>, bringing the<space/><link><target>dBase</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>InterBase</target></link><space/>databases to the house, in an all stock transaction. Competition with Microsoft was fierce.<space/><link><target>Microsoft</target></link><space/>launched the competing database<space/><link><target>Microsoft Access</target></link><space/>and bought the dBase clone<space/><link><target>FoxPro</target></link><space/>in 1992, undercutting Borland's prices.

Borland survived as a company, but no longer had the dominance in software tools that it once had. It has gone through a radical transition in products, financing, and staff, now a very different company from the one which challenged Microsoft and Lotus in the early 1990s.</paragraph><paragraph>The internal problems that arose with the Ashton-Tate merger were a large part of the fall. Ashton-Tate's product portfolio proved to be weak, with no provision for evolution into the GUI environment of Windows. Almost all product lines were discontinued. The consolidation of duplicate support and development offices was costly and disruptive. Worst of all, the highest revenue earner of the combined company was dBASE with no Windows version ready.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.compuvision.info/delayed-graphical-products-put-dent-in-borlands-image.html'>Delayed Graphical Products Put Dent in Borlands Image</link>, PC Week, April 20, 1992</extension><space/>Borland had an internal project to clone dBASE which was intended to run on Windows and was part of the strategy of the acquisition, but by late 1992 this was abandoned due to technical flaws and the company had to constitute a replacement team (the<space/><link><target>ObjectVision</target></link><space/>team, redeployed) headed by<space/><link><target>Bill Turpin</target></link><space/>to redo the job. Borland lacked the financial strength to project its marketing and move internal resources off other products to shore up the dBASE/W effort. Layoffs occurred in 1993 to keep the company afloat, the third instance of this in five years. By the time dBASE for Windows eventually shipped, the developer community had moved on to other products such as Clipper or FoxBase and dBASE never regained significant share of Ashton-Tate's former market. This happened against the backdrop of the rise in Microsoft's combined Office product marketing.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">February 2007</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>A change in market conditions also contributed to Borland's fall from prominence. In the 1980s, companies had few people who understood the growing personal computer phenomenon, and so most technical people were given free rein to purchase whatever software they thought they needed. Borland had done an excellent job marketing to those with a highly technical bent. By the mid-1990s, however, companies were beginning to ask what the return was on the investment they had made in this loosely controlled PC software buying spree. Company executives were starting to ask questions that were hard for technically minded staff to answer, and so corporate standards began to be created. This required new kinds of marketing and support materials from software vendors, but Borland remained focused on the technical side of its products.</paragraph><paragraph>During 1993 Borland explored ties with<space/><link><target>WordPerfect</target></link><space/>as a possible way to form a suite of programs to rival Microsoft's nascent integration strategy. WordPerfect itself was struggling with a late and troubled transition to Windows. The eventual joint company effort, named Borland Office for Windows (a combination of the WordPerfect word processor, Quattro Pro spreadsheet and Paradox database) was introduced at the 1993 Comdex computer show. Borland Office never made significant in-roads against Microsoft Office. WordPerfect was then bought by Novell. In October 1994, Borland sold Quattro Pro and rights to sell up to million copies of Paradox to<space/><link><target>Novell</target></link><space/>for $140 million in cash, repositioning the company on its core software development tools and the Interbase database engine and shifting toward client-server scenarios in corporate applications. This later proved a good foundation for the shift to web development tools.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Philippe Kahn</target></link><space/>and the Borland board came to a disagreement on how to focus the company, and Philippe Kahn resigned as Chairman, CEO and President of Borland, a position he had held for 12 years, in January 1995. However, the parting was amicable as Kahn remained on the Borland board until November 7, 1996, when he resigned from that position.<extension extension_name='ref' name="KahnBoard"><template><target>cite press release</target><arg name="publisher">Borland
