Speer, who had arrived in Rastenburg the previous evening, had accepted Todt's offer to fly with him to Berlin, but had canceled some hours before takeoff (Speer stated in his memoirs that the cancellation was because of exhaustion from travel and a late-night meeting with Hitler). Later that day, Hitler appointed Speer as Todt's successor to all of his posts. In<space/><italics>Inside the Third Reich</italics>, Speer recounts his meeting with Hitler and his reluctance to take ministerial office, only doing so because Hitler commanded it. Speer also states that<space/><link><target>Hermann Gring</target></link><space/>raced to Hitler's headquarters on hearing of Todt's death, hoping to claim Todt's powers.

Consumer goods were still being produced at nearly as high a level as during peacetime. No fewer than five &quot;Supreme Authorities&quot; had jurisdiction over armament productionone of which, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, had declared in November 1941 that conditions did not permit an increase in armament production. Few women were employed in the factories, which were running only one shift. One evening soon after his appointment, Speer went to visit a Berlin armament factory; he found no one on the premises.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Fest</arg><arg>1999</arg><arg name="pp">139–41</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2005-0103-502, Albert Speer bei Panzer-Besichtigung.jpg</target><part>left</part><part>upright</part><part>thumb</part><part>Speer inspects a<space/><link><target>Panther tank</target></link>, 1942.</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>Speer overcame these difficulties by centralizing power over the war economy in himself.

Over these departments was a central planning committee headed by Speer, which took increasing responsibility for war production, and as time went by, for the German economy itself. According to the minutes of a conference at<space/><italics>Wehrmacht</italics><space/>High Command in March&amp;nbsp;1942, &quot;It is only Speer's word that counts nowadays.
