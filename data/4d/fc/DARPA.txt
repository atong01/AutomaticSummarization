The '''Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency''' ('''DARPA''') is an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] responsible for the development of [[emerging technologies]] for use by the military.

DARPA was created in 1958 as the '''Advanced Research Projects Agency''' ('''ARPA''') by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. Its purpose was to formulate and execute research and development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science, with the aim to reach beyond immediate military requirements.<ref name="Commission2008">Dwight D. Eisenhower and Science & Technology, (2008).Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial Commission, [http://www.eisenhowermemorial.org/onepage/IKE%20&%20Science.Oct08.EN.FINAL%20(v2).pdf Source].</ref> The administration was responding to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] launching of [[Sputnik 1]] in 1957, and DARPA's mission was to ensure [[U.S. military]] technology would be more sophisticated than that of the nation's potential enemies.

The name of the organization changed several times from its founding name ARPA: DARPA (March 1972), ARPA (February 1993), and DARPA (March 1996).

DARPA is independent from other military [[research and development]] and reports directly to senior Department of Defense management. DARPA has ca. 240 personnel (13 in management, close to 140 technical) directly managing a $3 billion budget.

DARPA funded projects have provided significant technologies that influenced many non-military fields, such as [[computer networking]] and [[graphical user interface]]s in information technology.

==Mission==
DARPA characterizes its mission as follows:<ref name="DARPA">{{cite web | url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&AD=ADA433949 | title= DARPA: Bridging The Gap Powered By Ideas |year=2005}}</ref>
<blockquote>
DARPA’s original mission, established in 1958, was to prevent technological surprise like the launch of Sputnik, which signaled that the Soviets had beaten the U.S. into space. The mission statement has evolved over time. Today, DARPA’s mission is still to prevent technological surprise to the US, but also to create technological surprise for our enemies.

==History==
[[File:DARPA through 50 years.ogv|thumb|right|DARPA achievements for the past 50 years]]

===Early history===
The creation of ARPA was authorized by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in 1958 for the purpose of forming and executing research and development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science, and able to reach far beyond immediate military requirements.,<ref name="Commission2008"/> the two relevant acts being the Supplemental Military Construction Authorization (Air Force)<ref>{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books/about/Fiscal_year_1958_supplemental_military_c.html?id=N-IPAAAAIAAJ |title = Fiscal Year 1958 Supplemental Military Construction Authorization (Air Force): Hearings, Eighty-fifth Congress, Second Session, on H.R. 9739. |date= January 21, 24, 1958}}</ref> (Public Law 85-325) and Department of Defense Directive 5105.15, in February 1958. Its creation was directly attributed to the launching of [[Sputnik]] and to U.S. realization that the [[Soviet Union]] had developed the capacity to rapidly exploit military technology. Initial funding of ARPA was $520 million.<ref name = Wizards20 >"$ 520 million appropriation and a $ 2 billion budget plan." Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (p. 20). Simon & Schuster. Kindle Edition.</ref> ARPA's first director, Roy Johnson, left a $160,000 management job at General Electric for an $18,000 job at ARPA.<ref name = Wizards21 >"Roy Johnson, ARPA’s first director, was, like his boss, a businessman. At age fifty-two, he had been personally recruited by McElroy, who convinced him to leave a $160,000 job with General Electric and take an $18,000 job in Washington." Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (p. 21). Simon & Schuster. Kindle Edition.</ref> [[Herbert York]] from [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] was hired as his scientific assistant.<ref name = Wizards21a >"Herbert York, whom Killian had been keen on, was given the job and moved to ARPA from the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory." Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (p. 21). Simon & Schuster. Kindle Edition.</ref>

Johnson and York were both keen on space projects, but when [[NASA]] was established later in 1958 all space projects and most of ARPA's funding were transferred to it. Johnson resigned and ARPA was repurposed to do "high-risk," "high-gain," "far out" basic research, a posture that was enthusiastically embraced by the nation's scientists and research universities.<ref name = Wizards21,22 >"The staff of ARPA saw an opportunity to redefine the agency as a group that would take on the really advanced “far-out” research....The scientific community, predictably, rallied to the call for a reinvention of ARPA as a “high-risk high-gain” research sponsor— the kind of R& D shop they had dreamed of all along" Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (p. 21,22). Simon & Schuster. Kindle Edition.</ref> ARPA's second director was Brigadier General Austin W. Betts, who resigned in early 1961. He was succeeded by [[Jack Ruina]] who served until 1963.<ref name = Wizards23,24 >"In early 1961 ARPA’s second director, Brigadier General Austin W. Betts, resigned" Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (pp. 23,24) Simon & Schuster. Kindle Edition.</ref> Ruina, the first scientist to administer ARPA, managed to raise its budget to $250 million.<ref name = Wizards23 >"Ruina raised ARPA’s annual budget to $ 250 million." Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (p. 23). Simon & Schuster. Kindle Edition.</ref> It was Ruina who hired [[J. C. R. Licklider]] as the first administrator of the [[Information Processing Techniques Office]] which played a vital role in creation of the internet.<ref name = Wizards27-39  >"J. C. R. Licklider." Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (p. 27-39). Simon & Schuster. Kindle Edition.</ref>

Additionally, the political and defense communities recognized the need for a high-level Department of Defense organization to formulate and execute R&D projects that would expand the frontiers of technology beyond the immediate and specific requirements of the Military Services and their laboratories. In pursuit of this mission, DARPA has developed and transferred technology programs encompassing a wide range of scientific disciplines which address the full spectrum of national security needs.

From 1958 to 1965, ARPA's emphasis centered on major national issues, including space, [[ballistic missile defense]], and [[nuclear test]] detection.<ref name = Wizards23a >"Projects in ballistic missile defense and nuclear test detection, couched in terms of basic research, were the top priorities." Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (p. 23). Simon & Schuster. Kindle Edition</ref>  During 1960, all of its civilian space programs were transferred to the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) and the military space programs to the individual Services.

This allowed ARPA to concentrate its efforts on the [[Project Defender]] (defense against ballistic missiles), [[Project Vela]] (nuclear test detection), and [[Project AGILE]] ([[counterinsurgency]] R&D) Programs, and to begin work on computer processing, [[behavioral sciences]], and materials sciences. The DEFENDER and AGILE Programs formed the foundation of DARPA sensor, [[surveillance]], and directed energy R&D, particularly in the study of [[radar]], [[infrared]] sensing, and [[x-ray]]/[[gamma ray]] detection.

ARPA at this point (1959) played an early role in [[Transit (satellite)|Transit]] (also called NavSat) a predecessor to the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS).<ref>{{cite book | title=Transit to Tomorrow.  Fifty Years of Space Research at The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory | author= Helen E. Worth and Mame Warren | year=2009 | url=http://space50.jhuapl.edu/pdfs/book.pdf}}</ref>  "Fast-forward to 1959 when a joint effort between DARPA and the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory began to fine-tune the early explorers’ discoveries. TRANSIT, sponsored by the Navy and developed under the leadership of Dr. Richard Kirschner at Johns Hopkins, was the first satellite positioning system."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.darpa.mil/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=2565 | title=The Story of GPS | author= Catherine Alexandrow | date = Apr 2008}}</ref><ref name=gap>{{cite book | url=http://www.darpa.mil/about/history/first_50_years.aspx | title=DARPA: 50 Years of Bridging the Gap| date= Apr 2008}}</ref>

During the late 1960s, with the transfer of these mature programs to the Services, ARPA redefined its role and concentrated on a diverse set of relatively small, essentially exploratory research programs. The agency was renamed the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1972, and during the early 1970s, it emphasized direct energy programs, information processing, and tactical technologies.

Concerning information processing, DARPA made great progress, initially through its support of the development of [[time-sharing]] (all modern operating systems rely on concepts invented for the [[Multics]] system, developed by a cooperation among [[Bell Labs]], [[General Electric]] and [[MIT]], which DARPA supported by funding [[Project MAC]] at MIT with an initial two-million-dollar grant).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mit.edu/6.933/www/Fall2001/AILab.pdf | author=Stefanie Chiou, Craig Music, Kara Sprague, Rebekah Wahba | date = 5 Dec 2001 |  title=A Marriage of Convenience: The Founding of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory}}</ref>

DARPA supported the evolution of the [[ARPANET]] (the first wide-area packet switching network), Packet Radio Network, Packet Satellite Network and ultimately, the [[Internet]] and research in the [[artificial intelligence]] fields of speech recognition and signal processing, including parts of [[Shakey the robot]].<ref name="ieee">{{cite web|url=http://ghn.ieee.org/wiki/index.php/Oral-History:Bertram_Raphael|title=Oral History: Bertram Raphael|work=IEEE Global History Network|publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]]|accessdate=2012-02-25}}</ref> DARPA also funded the development of the [[Douglas Engelbart]]'s NLS computer system and [[The Mother of All Demos]]; and the [[Aspen Movie Map]], which was probably the first [[hypermedia]] system and an important precursor of [[virtual reality]].

===Later history===
The [[Mansfield Amendment]] of 1973 expressly limited appropriations for defense research (through ARPA/DARPA) only to projects with direct military application. Some{{Who|date=September 2009}} contend that the amendment devastated American science, since ARPA/DARPA was a major funding source for basic science projects of the time; the [[National Science Foundation]] never made up the difference as expected.

The resulting "[[brain drain]]" is also credited with boosting the development of the fledgling personal computer industry. Some young computer scientists left the universities to startups and private research labs such as [[PARC (company)|Xerox PARC]].

Between 1976 and 1981, DARPA's major projects were dominated by air, land, sea, and space technology, tactical armor and anti-armor programs, infrared sensing for space-based surveillance, high-energy laser technology for space-based missile defense, antisubmarine warfare, advanced cruise missiles, advanced aircraft, and defense applications of advanced computing. These large-scale technological program demonstrations were joined by integrated circuit research, which resulted in submicrometer electronic technology and electron devices that evolved into the Very Large Scale Integration ([[VLSI]]) Program and the Congressionally mandated charged particle beam program.

Many of the successful programs were transitioned to the Services, such as the foundation technologies in [[automatic target recognition]], space based sensing, propulsion, and materials that were transferred to the [[Strategic Defense Initiative Organization|Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO)]], later known as the [[Ballistic Missile Defense Organization|Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO)]], now titled the [[Missile Defense Agency|Missile Defense Agency (MDA)]].

===Recent history===
During the 1980s, the attention of the Agency was centered on information processing and aircraft-related programs, including the [[Rockwell X-30|National Aerospace Plane (NASP)]] or [[Hypersonic Research Program (DARPA)|Hypersonic Research Program]]. The [[Strategic Computing Program (DARPA)|Strategic Computing Program]] enabled DARPA to exploit advanced processing and networking technologies and to rebuild and strengthen relationships with universities after the [[Vietnam War]]. In addition, DARPA began to pursue new concepts for small, lightweight satellites ([[LIGHTSAT (DARPA)|LIGHTSAT]]) and directed new programs regarding defense manufacturing, submarine technology, and armor/anti-armor.

On October 28, 2009 the agency broke ground on a new facility in Arlington, Virginia a few miles from the Pentagon.<ref>''[[Washington Times]]'', "Pentagon Agency Breaks Ground", October 29, 2009.</ref>

In fall 2011, DARPA hosted the [[100 Year Starship|100-Year Starship]] Symposium with the aim of getting the public to start thinking seriously about interstellar travel.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://cleantechnica.com/2012/01/28/fmoon-colony-newt-darpa-has-100-year-starship/|title=Forget the Moon Colony, Newt: DARPA Aims for 100 Year Starship|first=Tina|last=Casey|publisher=CleanTechnica|date=2012-01-28|accessdate=2012-08-25}}</ref>

* The [[Tactical Technology Office (DARPA)|Tactical Technology Office (TTO)]] engages in high-risk, high-payoff advanced military research, emphasizing the "system" and "subsystem" approach to the development of aeronautic, space, and land systems as well as embedded processors and control systems. This research includes an effort within the TTO to develop a small satellite [[launch vehicle]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.darpa.mil/tto/programs/Falcon.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080822050303/http://www.darpa.mil/tto/programs/Falcon.htm |archivedate=2008-08-22 |title=Falcon |publisher=DARPA |year=2008}}</ref> This vehicle is under development by [[AirLaunch LLC]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airlaunchllc.com/News.htm |title=Airlaunchllc News |publisher=Airlaunch}}</ref> This is part of the [[Force Application and Launch from Continental United States]] (FALCON) effort.
* The [[Biological Technologies Office (DARPA)|Biological Technologies Office (BTO)]] fosters, demonstrates, and transitions  breakthrough fundamental research, discoveries, and applications that integrate biology, engineering, and computer science for national security.  Created in April 2014 by DARPA director [[Arati Prabhakar]], taking programs from the MTO and DSO divisions.<ref>http://www.darpa.mil/NewsEvents/Releases/2014/04/01.aspx</ref>

===Former offices===
* [[Information Awareness Office]]: 2002–2003
* The [[Advanced Technology Office (DARPA)|Advanced Technology Office (ATO)]] researched, demonstrated, and developed high payoff projects in maritime, communications, special operations, command and control, and information assurance and survivability mission areas.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
* The [[Special Projects Office (DARPA)|Special Projects Office (SPO)]] researched, developed, demonstrated, and transitioned technologies focused on addressing present and emerging national challenges. SPO investments ranged from the development of enabling technologies to the demonstration of large prototype systems. SPO developed technologies to counter the emerging threat of underground facilities used for purposes ranging from command-and-control, to weapons storage and staging, to the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction. SPO developed significantly more cost-effective ways to counter proliferated, inexpensive cruise missiles, UAVs, and other platforms used for weapon delivery, jamming, and surveillance. SPO invested in novel space technologies across the spectrum of space control applications including rapid access, space situational awareness, counterspace, and persistent tactical grade sensing approaches including extremely large space apertures and structures.
* The [[Information Systems Office| Information Systems Office (ISO)]] in the 1990s developed system applications of advanced information technologies.  It was a predecessor to the Information Exploitation Office.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
A 1991 reorganization created several offices which existed throughout the early 1990s:<ref>{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6712/is_n27_v171/ai_n28601257/ | work=Defense Daily | title=DARPA restructures/creates new offices | year=1991}}</ref>
* The [[Electronic Systems Technology Office]] combined areas of the Defense Sciences Office and the Defense Manufacturing Office. This new office will focus on the boundary between general-purpose computers and the physical world, such as sensors, displays and the first few layers of specialized signal-processing that couple these modules to standard computer interfaces.
* The [[Computing Systems Technology Office]] combined functions of the old Information Sciences and Tactical Technology office. The office "will work scalable parallel and distributed heterogeneous computing systems technologies," DoD said.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
* The [[Software and Intelligent Systems Technology Office]] and the [[Computing Systems office]] will have responsibility associated with the Presidential High-Performance Computing Initiative. The Software office will also be responsible for "software systems technology, machine intelligence and software engineering."
* The [[Land Systems Office]] was created to develop advanced land vehicle and anti-armor systems, once the domain of the Tactical Technology Office
* The [[Undersea Warfare Office]] combined areas of the Advanced Vehicle Systems and Tactical Technology offices to develop and demonstrate submarine stealth and counterstealth and automation.
Reorganization in 2010 merged two offices:
* The [[Transformational Convergence Technology Office (DARPA)|Transformational Convergence Technology Office (TCTO)]] mission was to advance new crosscutting capabilities derived from a broad range of emerging technological and social trends, particularly in areas related to computing and computing-reliant subareas of the life sciences, social sciences, manufacturing, and commerce. The TCTO was folded into the I2O in 2010.<ref name="darpa.mil"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hpcwire.com/2010/09/22/embedded_clouds_a_look_back_at_hpec_2010/|title=Embedded Clouds: A Look Back at HPEC 2010|work=HPCwire|accessdate=7 July 2015}}</ref>
* The [[Information Processing Techniques Office|Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO)]] focused on inventing the networking, computing, and software technologies vital to ensuring DOD military superiority. The IPTO was combined with TCTO in 2010 to form the I2O.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://schedule.sxsw.com/2014/events/event_IAP28839|title=Schedule - sxsw.com|work=SXSW Schedule 2014|accessdate=7 July 2015}}</ref>

ARPA/DARPA is well known as a high-tech government agency, and as such has many appearances in popular fiction.  Some realistic references to ARPA in fiction are in ''[[Tom Swift]] and the Visitor from Planet X''  (DARPA consults on a technical threat),<ref>Victor Appleton II, 1961. [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17985/17985-h/17985-h.htm ''Tom Swift and the Visitor from Planet X''], originally published by Grosset & Dunlap of New York, now re-published by Project Gutenberg.  ARPA is referred to on [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17985/17985-h/17985-h.htm#chap_8 page 68] published 1961</ref> in episodes of television program ''[[The West Wing]]'' (the ARPA-DARPA distinction), the television program ''[[Numb3rs]]''<ref>''Numb3ers'', [http://www.cbs.com/primetime/ncis_los_angeles/recaps/105/recaps.php?season=1 Season 1, Episode 5], and [http://www.math.cornell.edu/~numb3rs/spulido/Numb3rs_season5/Numb3rs_517.html Season 5, Episode 17]</ref> (DARPA research into creating the first self-aware computer), and in the motion picture ''[[Executive Decision]]'' (use of a one-of-a-kind experimental prototype in an emergency).
