Some likely sailed to Ecuador by<space/><link><target>raft</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>from<space/><link><target>Central America</target></link>, others came to Ecuador via the Amazon tributaries, others descended from northern<space/><link><target>South America</target></link>, and others ascended from the southern part of South America through the Andes or by sailing on rafts. They developed different languages while emerging as unique ethnic groups.</paragraph><paragraph>Even though their languages were unrelated, these groups developed similar cultures because they lived in the same environment. The people of the coast developed a fishing, hunting, and gathering culture; the people of the highland Andes developed a sedentary agricultural way of life; and the people of the Amazon basin developed a nomadic hunting and gathering way of life.</paragraph><paragraph>Over time these groups began to interact and intermingle with each other so that groups of families in one area became one community or tribe, with a similar language and culture. Many civilizations arose in Ecuador, such as the<space/><link><target>Valdivia Culture</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Machalilla Culture</target></link><space/>on the coast, the<space/><link><target>Quitus</target></link><space/>(near present-day Quito), and the<space/><link><target>Caari</target></link><space/>(near present-day<space/><link><target>Cuenca, Ecuador</target><part>Cuenca</part></link>). Each civilization developed its own distinctive architecture, pottery, and religious interests.</paragraph><paragraph>In the highland Andes mountains, where life was more sedentary, groups of tribes cooperated and formed villages; thus, the first nations based on agricultural resources and the domestication of animals were formed. Eventually, through wars and marriage alliances of their leaders, a group of nations formed confederations. One region was consolidated under a confederation called the<space/><link><target>Shyris</target></link>, which exercised organized trading and bartering between the different regions. Its political and military power was under the rule of the Duchicela blood line.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Inca era</heading><paragraph>When the<space/><link><target>Incas</target></link><space/>arrived, they found that these confederations were so developed that it took the Incas two generations of rulers -<space/><link><target>Topa Inca Yupanqui</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Huayna Capac</target></link><space/>- to absorb these confederations into the<space/><link><target>Inca Empire</target></link>. The native confederations that gave them the most problems were deported to far away areas of Peru, Bolivia, and north Argentina. Similarly, a number of loyal Inca subjects from Peru and Bolivia were brought to Ecuador to prevent rebellion. Thus, the region of highland Ecuador became part of the<space/><link><target>Inca Empire</target></link><space/>in 1463 sharing the same language.</paragraph><paragraph>In contrast, when the Incas made incursions into coastal Ecuador and the eastern Amazon jungles of Ecuador, they found both the environment and natives more hostile. Moreover, when the Incas tried to subdue them, these natives withdrew to the interior and resorted to<space/><link><target>guerrilla</target></link><space/>tactics. As a result, Inca expansion into the Amazon basin and the Pacific coast of Ecuador was hampered. The natives of the Amazon jungle and coastal Ecuador remained relatively autonomous until the Spanish soldiers and missionaries arrived in force. The Amazonian natives and the<space/><link><target>Cayapas</target></link><space/>of Coastal Ecuador were the only groups to resist Inca and Spanish domination, maintaining their language and culture well into the 21st century.</paragraph><paragraph>Before the arrival of the Spaniards, the Inca Empire was involved in a<space/><link><target>Inca Civil War</target><part>civil war</part></link>. The untimely death of both the heir Ninan Cuchi and the Emperor Huayna Capac, from a European disease that spread into Ecuador, created a power vacuum between two factions. The northern faction headed by Atahualpa claims that Huayna Capac gave a verbal decree before his death about how the empire should be divided. He gave the territories pertaining to present-day Ecuador and northern Peru to his favorite son Atahualpa, who was to rule from Quito; and he gave the rest to<space/><link><target>Huscar</target></link>, who was to rule from<space/><link><target>Cuzco</target></link>. He willed that his heart be buried in Quito, his favorite city, and the rest of his body be buried with his ancestors in Cuzco.</paragraph><paragraph>Huscar did not recognize his father's will, since it did not follow Inca traditions of naming an Inca through the priests. Huscar ordered Atahualpa to attend their father's burial in Cuzco and pay homage to him as the new Inca ruler. Atahualpa, with a large number of his father's veteran soldiers, decided to ignore Huscar, and a civil war ensued. A number of bloody battles took place until finally Huscar was captured. Atahualpa marched south to Cuzco and massacred the royal family associated with his brother.</paragraph><paragraph>A small band of Spaniards headed by Francisco Pizarro landed in Tumbez and marched over the Andes Mountains until they reached Cajamarca, where the new Inca Atahualpa was to hold an interview with them. Valverde, the priest, tried to convince Atahualpa that he should join the Catholic Church and declare himself a vassal of Spain. This infuriated Atahualpa so much that he threw the Bible to the ground. At this point the enraged Spaniards, with orders from Valverde, attacked and massacred unarmed escorts of the Inca and captured Atahualpa.<space/><link><target>Pizarro</target></link><space/>promised to release Atahualpa if he made good his promise of filling a room full of gold. But, after a mock trial, the Spaniards executed Atahualpa by strangulation.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Spanish Rule</heading><paragraph>New infectious diseases, endemic to the Europeans, caused high fatalities among the indigenous population during the first decades of Spanish rule, as they had no<space/><link><target>immunity (medical)</target><part>immunity</part></link>.

Quito's nickname, &quot;<italics><link><target>Luz de Amrica</target></link></italics>&quot; (&quot;Light of America&quot;), is based on its leading role in trying to secure an independent and local government.

He supported his claims with Spanish Royal decrees or<space/><italics>Real Cedulas,</italics><space/>that delineated the borders of Spain's former overseas colonies. In the case of Ecuador, Flores-based Ecuador's<space/><italics><link><target>de jure</target></link></italics><space/>claims on the following cedulas - Real Cedula of 1563, 1739, and 1740; with modifications in the Amazon Basin and Andes Mountains that were introduced through the Treaty of Guayaquil (1829) which Peru reluctantly signed, after the overwhelmingly outnumbered Gran Colombian force led by<space/><link><target>Antonio Jos de Sucre</target></link><space/>defeated President and General La Mar's Peruvian invasion force in the<space/><link><target>Battle of Tarqui</target></link>.

Moreover, to add legitimacy to his claims, on February 16, 1840, Flores signed a treaty with Spain, whereby Flores convinced Spain to officially recognize Ecuadorian independence and its sole rights to colonial titles over Spain's former colonial territory known anciently to Spain as the Kingdom and Presidency of Quito.</paragraph><paragraph>Ecuador during its long and turbulent history has lost most of its contested territories to each of its more powerful neighbors, such as Colombia in 1832 and 1916, Brazil in 1904 through a series of peaceful treaties, and Peru after a short war in which the Protocol of Rio de Janeiro was signed in 1942.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Struggle for independence</heading><paragraph>During the struggle for independence, before Peru or Ecuador became independent nations, a few areas of the former Vice Royalty of New Granada - Guayaquil, Tumbez, and Jan - declared themselves independent from Spain. A few months later, a part of the Peruvian liberation army of San Martin decided to occupy the independent cities of Tumbez and Jan with the intention of using these towns as springboards to occupy the independent city of Guayaquil and then to liberate the rest of the Audiencia de Quito (Ecuador). It was common knowledge among the top officers of the liberation army from the south that their leader<space/><link><target>Jos de San Martn</target><part>San Martin</part></link><space/>wished to liberate present-day Ecuador and add it to the future republic of Peru, since it had been part of the Inca Empire before the Spaniards conquered it.

San Martin's plans were thwarted when<space/><link><target>Simn Bolvar</target><part>Bolvar</part></link>, with the help of Marshal Antonio Jos de Sucre and the Gran Colombian liberation force, descended from the Andes mountains and occupied Guayaquil; they also annexed the newly liberated Audiencia de Quito to the Republic of<space/><link><target>Gran Colombia</target></link>. This happened a few days before San Martin's Peruvian forces could arrive and occupy Guayaquil, with the intention of annexing Guayaquil to the rest of Audiencia of Quito (Ecuador) and to the future republic of Peru. Historic documents repeatedly stated that San Martin told Bolivar he came to Guayaquil to liberate the land of the Incas from Spain. Bolivar countered by sending a message from Guayaquil welcoming San Martin and his troops to Colombian soil.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Peruvian occupation of Jan, Tumbez, and Guayaquil</heading><paragraph>In the south, Ecuador had<space/><italics>de jure</italics><space/>claims to a small piece of land beside the Pacific Ocean known as Tumbez, which lay between the Zarumilla and Tumbez rivers. In Ecuador's southern Andes Mountain region where the Maraon cuts across, Ecuador had<space/><italics>de jure</italics><space/>claims to an area it called Jan de Bracamoros. These areas were included as part of the territory of Gran Colombia by Bolivar in December 17, 1819, during the<space/><link><target>Congress of Angostura</target></link><space/>when the Republic of Gran Colombia was created. Tumbez declared itself independent from Spain on January 17, 1821, and Jaen de Bracamoros on June 17, 1821, without any outside help from revolutionary armies. However, that same year, 1821, Peruvian forces participating in the Trujillo revolution occupied both Jaen and Tumbez. Some Peruvian generals, without any legal titles backing them up and with Ecuador still federated with the Gran Colombia, had the desire to annex Ecuador to the Republic of Peru at the expense of the Gran Colombia, feeling that Ecuador was once part of the Inca Empire. Then on July 28, 1821, Peruvian independence was proclaimed in Lima by the Liberator San Martin and Tumbez and Jaen which were included as part of the revolution of Trujillo by the Peruvian occupying force, had the whole region swear allegiance to the new Peruvian flag and incorporated itself into Peru, even though Peru was not completely liberated from Spain. After Peru was completely liberated from Spain by the patriot armies led by Bolivar and Antonio Jose Sucre at the<space/><link><target>Battle of Ayacucho</target></link><space/>dated December 9, 1824, there was a strong desire by some Peruvians to resurrect the<space/><link><target>Inca Empire</target></link><space/>and to include Bolivia and Ecuador. One of these Peruvian Generals was the Ecuadorian-born<space/><link><target>Jos de La Mar</target></link>, who became one of Peru's presidents after Bolivar resigned as dictator of Peru and returned to Colombia. Gran Colombia had always protested Peru for the return of Jaen and Tumbez for almost a decade, then finally Bolivar after long and futile discussion over the return of Jaen, Tumbez, and part of Mainas, declared war. President and General<space/><link><target>Jos de La Mar</target></link>, who was born in Ecuador, believing his opportunity had come to annex the District of Ecuador to Peru, personally, with a Peruvian force, invaded and occupied Guayaquil and a few cities in the Loja region of southern Ecuador on November 28, 1828. The war ended when a triumphant heavily outnumbered southern Gran Colombian army at<space/><link><target>Battle of Tarqui</target></link><space/>dated February 27, 1829, led by<space/><link><target>Antonio Jos de Sucre</target></link>, defeated the Peruvian invasion force led by President La Mar. This defeat led to the signing of the Treaty of Guayaquil dated September 22, 1829, whereby Peru and its Congress recognized Gran Colombian rights over Tumbez, Jaen, and Maynas. Through protocolized meetings between representatives of Peru and Gran Colombia, the border was set as Tumbez river in the west and in the east the Maranon and Amazon rivers were to be followed toward Brazil as the most natural borders between them. However, what was pending was whether the new border around the Jaen region should follow the Chinchipe river or the Huancabamba river. According to the peace negotiations Peru agreed to return Guayaquil, Tumbez, and Jan; despite this, Peru returned Guayaquil, but failed to return Tumbez and Jan, alleging that it was not obligated to follow the agreements, since the Gran Colombia ceased to exist when it divided itself into three different nations - Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela.</paragraph><heading level='4'>The dissolution of Gran Colombia</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Gran Colombia map 1824.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>260px</part><part>The<space/><link><target>Gran Colombia</target></link><space/>showing all Colombian Land Claims outlined in red</part></link></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Ecuador1830.png</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>250px</part><part>Ecuador in 1830</part></link>The Central District of the Gran Colombia, known as Cundinamarca or New Granada (modern Colombia) with its capital in Bogota, did not recognize the separation of the Southern District of the Gran Colombia, with its capital in Quito, from the Gran Colombian federation on May 13, 1830. After Ecuador's separation, the<space/><link><target>Department of Cauca</target></link><space/>voluntarily decided to unite itself with Ecuador due to instability in the central government of Bogota. President Juan Jos Flores with the approval of the Ecuadorian congress annexed the Department of Cauca on December 20, 1830, since the government of Cauca had called for union with the District of the South as far back as April 1830. Moreover, the Cauca region throughout its long history had very strong economic and cultural ties with the people of Ecuador. Also, the Cauca region which included such cities as<space/><link><target>Pasto</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Popayan</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca</target><part>Buenaventura</part></link><space/>had always been dependent on the Presidencia or Audiencia of Quito. Fruitless negotiations continued between the governments of Bogota and Quito, where the government of Bogota didn't recognize the separation of Ecuador or that of Cauca from the Gran Colombia until war broke out in May 1832. In five months, New Granada defeated Ecuador due to the fact that the majority of the Ecuadorian Armed Forces were composed of rebellious angry unpaid veterans from Venezuela and Colombia that did not want to fight against their fellow countrymen. Seeing that his officers were rebelling, mutinying, and changing sides, President Flores had no option but to reluctantly make peace with New Granada. The Treaty of Pasto of 1832 was signed by which the Department of Cauca was turned over to New Granada (modern Colombia), the government of Bogota recognized Ecuador as an independent country and the border was to follow the Ley de Divisin Territorial de la Repblica de Colombia (Law of the Division of Territory of the Gran Colombia) passed on June 25, 1824. This law set the border at the river Carchi and the eastern border that stretched to Brazil at the Caquet river. Later, Ecuador contended that the Republic of Colombia, while reorganizing its government, unlawfully made its eastern border provisional and that Colombia extended its claims south to the Napo River because it said that the Government of Popayan extended its control all the way to the Napo River.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Struggle for possession of the Amazon Basin known as Maynas</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:South America 1879.png</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>South America (1879): All land claims by Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia in 1879</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>When Ecuador seceded from the Gran Colombia, Peru decided not to follow the treaty of Guayaquil of 1829 or the protocoled agreements made. Peru contested Ecuador's claims with the newly discovered<space/><italics>Real Cedula</italics><space/>of 1802, by which Peru claims the King of Spain had transferred these lands from the Viceroyalty of New Granada to the Viceroyalty of Peru. During colonial times this was to halt the ever-expanding Portuguese settlements into Spanish domains, which were left vacant and in disorder after the expulsion of Jesuit missionaries from their bases along the Amazon Basin. Ecuador countered by labeling the Cedula of 1802 an ecclesiastical instrument, which had nothing to do with political borders. Peru began its de facto occupation of disputed Amazonian territories, after it signed a secret 1851 peace treaty in favor of Brazil. This treaty disregarded Spanish rights that were confirmed during colonial times by a Spanish-Portuguese treaty over the Amazon regarding territories held by illegal Portuguese settlers. Peru began occupying the defenseless missionary villages in the Mainas or Maynas region which it began calling Loreto with its capital in Iquitos. During its negotiations with Brazil, Peru stated that based on the royal cedula of 1802, it claimed Amazonian Basin territories up to Caqueta River in the north and toward the Andes Mountain range, depriving Ecuador and Colombia of all their claims to the Amazon Basin. Colombia protested stating that its claims extended south toward the Napo and Amazon Rivers. Ecuador protested that it claimed the Amazon Basin between the Caqueta river and the Maraon-Amazon river. Peru ignored these protests and created the Department of Loreto in 1853 with its capital in Iquitos which it had recently invaded and systematically began to occupy using the river systems in all the territories claimed by both Colombia and Ecuador. Peru briefly occupied Guayaquil again in 1860, since Peru thought that Ecuador was selling some of the disputed land for development to British bond holders, but returned Guayaquil after a few months. The border dispute was then submitted to Spain for arbitration from 1880 to 1910, but to no avail.</paragraph><paragraph>In the early part of the 20th century Ecuador made an effort to peacefully define its eastern Amazonian borders with its neighbors through negotiation. On May 6, 1904, Ecuador signed the Tobar - Rio Branco Treaty recognizing Brazils claims to the Amazon in recognition of Ecuador's claim to be an Amazonian country to counter Peru's earlier Treaty with Brazil back in October 23, 1851. Then after a few meetings with the Colombian government's representatives an agreement was reached and the Muoz Vernaza-Suarez Treaty was signed July 15, 1916, in which Colombian rights to the Putumayo river were recognized as well as Ecuador's rights to the Napo river and the new border was a line that ran midpoint between those to rivers. In this way Ecuador gave up the claims it had to the Amazonian territories between the Caquet River and Napo River to Colombia, thus cutting itself off from Brazil. Later a brief war erupted between Colombia and Peru, over Peru's claims to the Caquet region, which ended with the Peru reluctantly signing the Salomon-Lozano Treaty on March 24, 1922. Ecuador protested this secret treaty, since Colombia gave away Ecuadorian claimed land to Peru that Ecuador had given to Colombia in 1916.</paragraph><paragraph>In July 21, 1924 the Ponce-Castro Oyanguren Protocol was signed between Ecuador and Peru where both agreed to hold direct negotiations and to resolve the dispute in an equitable manner and to submit the differing points of the dispute to the United States for arbitration. Negotiations between the Ecuadorian and Peruvian representatives began in Washington on September 30, 1935. These negotiations were long and tiresome. Both sides logically presented their cases, but no one seemed to give up their claims. Then on February 6, 1937, Ecuador presented a transactional line which Peru rejected the next day. The negotiations turned into intense arguments during the next 7 months and finally on September 29, 1937 the Peruvian representatives decided to break off the negotiations without submitting the dispute to arbitration because the direct negotiations were going nowhere.</paragraph><paragraph>Four years later in 1941, amid fast-growing tensions within disputed territories around the Zarumilla River, war broke out with Peru. Peru claimed that Ecuador's military presence in Peruvian-claimed territory was an invasion; Ecuador, for its part, claimed that Peru had recently invaded Ecuador around the Zarumilla River and that Peru since Ecuador's independence from Spain has systematically occupied Tumbez, Jaen, and most of the disputed territories in the Amazonian Basin between the Putomayo and Maraon Rivers. In July 1941, troops were mobilized in both countries. Peru had an army of 11,681 troops who faced a poorly supplied and inadequately armed Ecuadorian force of 2,300, of which only 1,300 were deployed in the southern provinces. Hostilities erupted on July 5, 1941, when Peruvian forces crossed the Zarumilla river at several locations, testing the strength and resolve of the Ecuadorian border troops. Finally, on July 23, 1941, the Peruvians launched a major invasion, crossing the Zarumilla river in force and advancing into the Ecuadorian province of<space/><link><target>El Oro Province</target><part>El Oro</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Ecuador-peru-land-claims-01.png</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>Map of Ecuadorian Land Claims after 1916</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>During the course of the<space/><link><target>EcuadorianPeruvian War</target></link>, Peru gained control over part of the disputed territory and some parts of the province of El Oro, and some parts of the<space/><link><target>Loja Province</target><part>province of Loja</part></link>, demanding that the Ecuadorian government give up its territorial claims. The Peruvian Navy blocked the port of<space/><link><target>Guayaquil</target></link>, almost cutting all supplies to the Ecuadorian troops. After a few weeks of war and under pressure by the United States and several Latin American nations, all fighting came to a stop. Ecuador and Peru came to an accord formalized in the<space/><link><target>Rio Protocol</target></link>, signed on January 29, 1942, in favor of hemispheric unity against the<space/><link><target>Axis Powers</target></link><space/>in<space/><link><target>World War II</target></link><space/>favoring Peru with the territory they occupied at the time the war came to an end.</paragraph><paragraph>The 1944<space/><link><target>Glorious May Revolution</target></link><space/>followed a military-civilian rebellion and a subsequent civic strike which successfully removed Carlos Arroyo del Ro as a dictator from Ecuador's government. However a post-Second World War recession and popular unrest led to a return to populist politics and domestic military interventions in the 1960s, while foreign companies developed oil resources in the Ecuadorian Amazon. In 1972, construction of the Andean pipeline was completed. The pipeline brought oil from the east side of the Andes to the coast, making Ecuador South America's second largest oil exporter. The pipeline in southern Ecuador did nothing to resolve tensions between Ecuador and Peru, however.<link><target>File:Relevo-ecu.JPG</target><part>thumb</part><part>Ecuadorian troops during the Cenepa War</part></link><link><target>File:Mirage F.1JA.JPG</target><part>right</part><part>thumb</part><part>The<space/><link><target>Dassault Mirage F1</target><part>Mirage F.1JA</part></link><space/>(FAE-806) was one aircraft involved in the claimed shooting down of two Peruvian<space/><link><target>Sukhoi Su-22</target></link><space/>on February 10, 1995.</part></link>The<space/><link><target>Rio Protocol</target></link><space/>failed to precisely resolve the border along a little river in the remote<space/><italics>Cordillera del Cndor</italics><space/>region in southern Ecuador.

The rivers rise from snowmelt at the edges of the snowcapped peaks or from the abundant precipitation that falls at higher elevations. In the La Sierra region, the streams and rivers are narrow and flow rapidly over precipitous slopes. Rivers may slow and widen as they cross the hoyas yet become rapid again as they flow from the heights of the<space/><link><target>Andes</target></link><space/>to the lower elevations of the other regions. The highland rivers broaden as they enter the more level areas of the Costa and the Oriente.</paragraph><paragraph>In the Costa, the external coast has mostly intermittent rivers that are fed by constant rains from December through May and become empty riverbeds during the dry season.

Ecuador officially began its own monetary unit on June 28, 1835, when the inscription (rev.) &quot;EL ECUADOR EN COLOMBIA&quot; was changed to &quot;REPBLICA DEL ECUADOR&quot;. Many regional coins from neighboring Peru, Colombia, Bolivia, etc., as well as international units, were in circulation and accepted while Quito fought counterfeiting and tried to unify its currency. Counterfeiting had reached alarming proportions during 1842.

The mint equipment was worn and could not produce coins in sufficient quantity to compete with the foreign coin that entered Ecuador.</paragraph><paragraph>Congress passed a new monetary law on December 5, 1856, adopting the French decimal system, a standard of 0.900 for silver, and the Ecuadorian Franco. The peso remained a unit of account equal to 5 francos.

This is largely owing to the 17th-century shipwreck of a slave-trading galleon off the northern coast of Ecuador. The few black African survivors swam to the shore and penetrated the then-thick jungle under the leadership of Anton, the chief of the group, where they remained as free men maintaining their original culture, not influenced by the typical elements found in other provinces of the coast or in the Andean region. A little later, runaway slaves from Colombia known as<space/><italics>cimarrones</italics><space/>joined them. In the small Chota Valley of the province of Imbabura exist a small community of Africans among the province's predominantly mestizo population. These blacks are descendants of Africans, who were brought over from Colombia by Jesuits to work their colonial sugar plantations as slaves. As a general rule, small elements of zambos and mulattoes coexisted among the overwhelming mestizo population of coastal Ecuador throughout its history as gold miners in Loja, Zaruma, and Zamora and as shipbuilders and plantation workers around the city of Guayaquil.

These terminal degrees, as in the case of the PhD in other countries, were the main requirement for an individual to be accepted in academia as a professor or researcher. In the professional realm, a terminal degree granted by an accredited institution automatically provides a professional license to the individual.</paragraph><paragraph>However, in 2004, the National Council of Higher Education (CONESUP), started the reorganization of all the degree-granting schemes of the accredited universities in order to pair them with foreign counterparts. The new structure of some careers caused the dropping of subjects, credits, or even the name of the previously conferred diplomas. The terminal degree in law, previously known as JD<space/><link><target>Juris Doctor</target></link><space/>(Doctor en Jurisprudencia) was replaced by the one of<space/><italics>abogado</italics><space/>(attorney) with the exception of the modification of the number of credits to equate it to an undergraduate degree. In the same fashion for medical school, the required time of education was considerably reduced from nine years (the minimum needed to obtain the title of MD in Medicine and Surgery) to almost five, with the provision that the diploma is not terminal anymore, and it is given with the title of<space/><italics>mdico</italics><space/>(medic). Therefore, an MD or PhD in medicine is only to be obtained overseas until the universities adjust themselves to granting schemes and curriculum as in foreign counterparts. Nonetheless, a &quot;mdico&quot; can start a career as family practitioner or general medicine physician.<link><target>File:SageoEG - Biblioteca Municipal de Guayaquil 001.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part><link><target>Biblioteca Municipal de Guayaquil</target></link></part></link>This new reorganization, although very ambitious, lacked the proper path to the homologation of diplomas for highly educated professionals graduated in the country or even for the ones graduated in foreign institutions. One of the points of conflict was the imposition of obtaining foreign degrees to current academicians. As today, a master's degree is a requirement to keep an academic position and at least a foreign PhD to attain or retain the status of<space/><italics>rector</italics><space/>(president of a university) or<space/><italics>dcano</italics><space/>(dean). For Ecuadorian researchers and many academicians trained in the country, these regulations sounded illogical, disappointing, and unlawful since it appeared a question of a title name conflict rather than specialization or science advancement.</paragraph><paragraph>A debate to modify this and other reforms, specially the one which granted control of the Higher Education System by the government, was practically passed with consensus by the multi-partisan National Assembly on August 4, 2010, but vetoed by President<space/><link><target>Rafael Correa</target></link>, who wanted to keep the law strictly as it was originally redacted by his political party and SENPLADES (National Secretary of Planning and Development). Due to this change, there are many highly educated professionals and academicians under the old structure but estimated that only 87% of the faculty in public universities have already obtained a master's degree, and fewer than 5% have a PhD (although many of them already have Ecuadorian-granted doctorate degrees).</paragraph><paragraph>About 300 institutes of higher education offer two to three years of post-secondary vocational or technical training.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Sciences and research</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:NEE-01-PEGASO.jpg</target><part>left</part><part>thumb</part><part><link><target>Ecuadorian Civilian Space Agency</target><part>EXA</part></link>'s first satellite,<space/><link><target>NEE-01 Pegasus</target></link></part></link>Ecuador is currently placed in 96th position, of innovation in technology.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://web.archive.org/web/20131104000235/http://elcomercio.com/sociedad/Tecnologia-innovacion-emprendimiento-emprendedores-Ecuador-desarrollo-nuevasTecnologias_0_995900422.html'>Ecuador ocupa el puesto 96 en innovacin tecnolgica</link>. elcomercio.com.
