By the end of 19181919, some units had been created: secretly operative, investigatory, of transportation, military (special), operative, and instructional.

It commanded a team of soldiers, the Sveaborgesky regiment, as well as a group of Red Guardsmen. On January 14, 1918, Sovnarkom ordered Dzerzhinsky to organize teams of &quot;energetic and ideological&quot; sailors to combat speculation. By the spring of 1918, the commission had several teams. In addition to the Sveaborge team, it had an intelligence team, a team of sailors, and a strike team. Through the winter of 19171918, all the activities of VCheKa were centralized mainly in the city of Petrograd. It was one of the several other commissions in the country that fought against counterrevolution, speculation, banditry, and other activities perceived as crimes. Other organizations included: the Bureau of Military Commissars, and an Army-Navy investigatory commission to attack the counterrevolutionary element in the<space/><link><target>Red Army</target></link>, plus the Central Requisite and Unloading Commission to fight speculation. The investigation of counterrevolutionary or major criminal offenses was conducting by the Investigatory Commission of Revtribunal.

It offered to leave, for the VCheKa and the Commission of Bonch-Bruyevich, only the functions of detection and suppression, while investigative functions entirely transferred to it. The Investigatory Commission prevailed. On January 31, 1918, Sovnarkom ordered to relieve VCheKa of the investigative functions, leaving for the commission only the functions of detection, suppression, and prevention of so-called crimes. At the meeting of the Council of People's Commissars on January 31, 1918, a merger of VCheKa and the Commission of Bonch-Bruyevich was proposed. The existence of both commissions, VCheKa of Sovnarkom and the Commission of Bonch-Bruyevich of VTsIK, with almost the same functions and equal rights, became impractical. A decision followed two weeks later.<extension extension_name='ref'><italics><link><target>Izvestiya</target></link></italics>.

February 1918 saw the creation of local Extraordinary Commissions. One of the first founded was the<space/><link><target>Moscow</target></link><space/>Cheka. Sections and commissariats to combat counterrevolution were established in other cities. The Extraordinary Commissions arose, usually in the areas during the moments of the greatest aggravation of political situation. On February 25, 1918, as the counterrevolutionary organization<space/><italics>Union of Front-liners</italics><space/>was making advances, the executive committee of the<space/><link><target>Saratov</target></link><space/>Soviet formed a counter-revolutionary section. On March 7, 1918, because of the move from<space/><link><target>Petrograd</target></link><space/>to Moscow, the Petrograd Cheka was created. On March 9, a section for combating counterrevolution was created under the<space/><link><target>Omsk</target></link><space/>Soviet.

Establishment of provincial Extraordinary Commissions was largely completed by August 1918. In the Soviet Republic, there were 38<space/><link><target>guberniya</target><part>gubernatorial</part></link><space/>Chekas (Gubcheks) by this time.</paragraph><paragraph>On June 12, 1918, the All-Russian Conference of Cheka adopted the<space/><italics>Basic Provisions on the Organization of Extraordinary Commissions</italics>.

In August 1918, in the Soviet Republic had accounted for some 75 Uyezd-level Extraordinary Commissions. By the end of the year, 365 Uyezd-level Chekas were established. In 1918, the All-Russia Extraordinary Commission and the Soviets managed to establish a local Cheka apparatus.

In addition, border security Chekas were included in the system of local Cheka bodies.</paragraph><paragraph>In the autumn of 1918, as consolidation of the political situation of the republic continued, a move toward elimination of Uyezd-, Raion-, and Volost-level Chekas, as well as the institution of Extraordinary Commissions was considered. On January 20, 1919, VTsIK adopted a resolution prepared by VCheKa,<space/><italics>On the abolition of Uyezd Extraordinary Commissions</italics>.

In August 1918, railway sections were formed under the Gubcheks. Formally, they were part of the non-resident sections, but in fact constituted a separate division, largely autonomous in their activities.

No standard procedures were ever set up, except that the Commission was supposed to send the arrested to the Military-Revolutionary tribunals if outside of a war zone. This left an opportunity for a wide range of interpretations, as the whole country was in total chaos. At the direction of Lenin, the Cheka performed mass arrests, imprisonments, and executions of &quot;<link><target>enemies of the people</target></link>&quot;. In this, the Cheka said that they targeted &quot;class enemies&quot; such as the<space/><link><target>bourgeoisie</target></link>, and members of the<space/><link><target>clergy</target></link>; the first organized mass repression began against the<space/><link><target>Libertarianism</target><part>libertarians</part></link><space/>and socialists of Petrograd in April 1918. Over the next few months, 800 were arrested and shot without trial.</paragraph><paragraph>However, within a month, the Cheka had extended its repression to all political opponents of the communist government, including<space/><link><target>Anarchism</target><part>anarchists</part></link><space/>and others on the left. On April 11/12, 1918, some 26 anarchist political centres in Moscow were attacked. There 40 anarchists were killed by Cheka forces, and about 500 were arrested and jailed after a pitched battle took place between the two groups. (P. Avrich. G. Maximoff) In response to the anarchists' resistance, the Cheka orchestrated a massive retaliatory campaign of repression, executions, and arrests against all opponents of the Bolshevik government, in what came to be known as &quot;<link><target>Red Terror</target></link>&quot;. The<space/><italics>Red Terror</italics>, implemented by Dzerzhinsky on September 5, 1918, was vividly described by the<space/><link><target>Red Army</target></link><space/>journal<space/><italics>Krasnaya Gazeta</italics>:</paragraph><list type='ident'><listitem>&quot;Without mercy, without sparing, we will kill our enemies in scores of hundreds.

Already the Cheka, which made mass arrests of suspects, was tending to settle their fate independently, under formal control of the Party, but in reality without anybody's knowledge. The Party endeavoured to head it with incorruptible men like the former convict Dzerzhinsky, a sincere idealist, ruthless but chivalrous, with the emaciated profile of an [[Inquisitor]]: tall forehead, bony nose, untidy goatee, and an expression of weariness and austerity. But the Party had few men of this stamp and many Chekas. I believe that the formation of the Chekas was one of the gravest and most impermissible errors that the Bolshevik leaders committed in 1918 when plots, blockades, and interventions made them lose their heads. All evidence indicates that [[revolutionary tribunal (Russia)|revolutionary tribunal]]s, functioning in the light of day and admitting the right of defense, would have attained the same efficiency with far less abuse and depravity. Was it necessary to revert to the procedures of the Inquisition?"</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>The Cheka was also used against the armed anarchist<space/><link><target>Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine</target><part>Black Army</part></link><space/>of<space/><link><target>Nestor Makhno</target></link><space/>in the Ukraine.
