'''Edward Jenner''', [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|n|ər}}; 17 May 1749 – 26 January 1823) was an English physician and scientist who was the pioneer of [[smallpox vaccine]], the world's first [[vaccine]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stefan Riedel, MD, PhD |pmc=1200696 |title=Edward Jenner and the history of smallpox and vaccination |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=21–25 |date=January 2005 |publisher=Baylor University Medical Center |pmid=16200144}}</ref><ref name=Baxbydnb>{{cite web |last=Baxby |first=Derrick |title=Jenner, Edward (1749–1823) |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14749|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=14 February 2014}}</ref> He is often called "the father of [[immunology]]", and his work is said to have "saved more lives than the work of any other human".<ref name="JennerSundayTimes"/><ref name="JennerBBC"/><ref name="JennerDinWeb"/>

==Early life==
[[File:Memorial to Edward Jenner in Gloucester Cathedral.jpg|thumb|upright|Memorial to Jenner in [[Gloucester Cathedral]]]]
Edward Anthony Jenner was born on 17 May 1749<ref name="About Edward Jenner"/> (6 May [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]]) in [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire]], as the eighth of nine children. His father, the Reverend Stephen Jenner, was the [[vicar]] of Berkeley, so Jenner received a strong basic education.<ref name="About Edward Jenner"/>

He went to school in [[Wotton-under-Edge]] and [[Cirencester]].<ref name="About Edward Jenner">{{cite web |url=http://www.jenner.ac.uk/edward-jenner |title=About Edward Jenner |work=The Jenner Institute |accessdate=12 January 2013}}</ref> During this time, he was inoculated for [[smallpox]], which had a lifelong effect upon his general health.<ref name="About Edward Jenner"/> At the age of 14, he was apprenticed for seven years to Mr Daniel Ludlow, a [[surgeon]] of [[Chipping Sodbury]], South Gloucestershire, where he gained most of the experience needed to become a surgeon himself.<ref name="About Edward Jenner"/>

In 1770, Jenner became apprenticed in surgery and anatomy under surgeon [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] and others at [[St George's Hospital]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jennermuseum.com/Jenner/youngedward.html |title=Young Edward Jenner, Born in Berkeley|work=Edward Jenner Museum |accessdate=4 September 2012}}</ref> [[William Osler]] records<!-- lectures at Yale in 1913 - Bartlett free bookshelf on Web --> that Hunter gave Jenner [[William Harvey]]'s advice, very famous in medical circles (and characteristic of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]), "Don't think; try."<ref name="Loncarek"/> Hunter remained in correspondence with Jenner over [[natural history]] and proposed him for the Royal Society. Returning to his native countryside by 1773, Jenner became a successful family doctor and surgeon, practising on dedicated premises at Berkeley.

Jenner and others formed the Fleece Medical Society or Gloucestershire Medical Society, so called because it met in the parlour of the Fleece Inn, [[Rodborough]] (in [[Gloucestershire]]), meeting to dine together and read papers on medical subjects. Jenner contributed papers on [[angina pectoris]], [[ophthalmia]], and cardiac valvular disease and commented on [[cowpox]]. He also belonged to a similar society which met in Alveston, near Bristol.<ref>Papers at the Royal College of Physicians summarised at http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search2?coll_id=7135&inst_id=8</ref>

He became a master [[Freemasonry|mason]] 30 December 1802, in Lodge of Faith and Friendship #449. From 1812–1813, he served as worshipful master of Royal Berkeley Lodge of Faith and Friendship.<ref>http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/jenner_e/jenner_e.html</ref>

== Zoology ==
Jenner was elected fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1788,<!--or 1789: the Royal Society says 9, RCS say 8 and married afterward, that year--> following his publication of a careful study of the previously misunderstood life of the nested [[common cuckoo|cuckoo]], a study that combined observation, experiment, and dissection.

[[File:Cuculus canorus.jpg|thumb|left|Common cuckoo]]

His description of the newly hatched cuckoo, pushing its host's eggs and fledgling chicks out of the nest (contrary to existing belief that the adult cuckoo did it) was only confirmed in the 20th century,<ref>http://www.jennermuseum.com/ej/cuckoo.shtml  {{wayback|url=http://www.jennermuseum.com/ej/cuckoo.shtml |date=20090923015150 }}</ref> when photography became available. Having observed this behaviour, Jenner demonstrated an anatomical adaptation for it—the baby cuckoo has a depression in its back, not present after 12 days of life, that enables it to cup eggs and other chicks. The adult does not remain long enough in the area to perform this task. Jenner's findings were published in ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'' in 1788.<ref>Observations on the Natural History of the Cuckoo. By Mr. Edward Jenner. In a Letter to John Hunter, Esq. F. R. S Jenner, E Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London (1776–1886). 1788-01-01. 78:219–237 (Text at https://archive.org/details/philtrans06624558)</ref><ref>Cuckoo chicks evicting their nest mates: coincidental observations by Edward Jenner in England and Antoine Joseph Lottinger in France, Spencer G. Sealy and Mélanie F. Guigueno

"The singularity of its shape is well adapted to these purposes; for, different from other newly hatched birds, its back from the scapula downwards is very broad, with a considerable depression in the middle. This depression seems formed by nature for the design of giving a more secure lodgement to the egg of the Hedge-sparrow, or its young one, when the young Cuckoo is employed in removing either of them from the nest. When it is about twelve days old, this cavity is quite filled up, and then the back assumes the shape of nestling birds in general." <ref>(Letter to Hunter at the Royal Society, as above)</ref>

<!--Some discrepancies in the paper are ascribed to Jenner's nephew, who is said to have fabricated certain observations.-->Jenner's nephew assisted in the study. He was born on 30 June 1737.

==Marriage and human medicine==
[[File:Edward Jenner, certificate of attendance at Wellcome L0020702.jpg|thumb|upright|A lecturer's certificate of attendance given to Jenner. He attended many lectures on chemistry, medicine and physics.]]
Jenner married Catharine Kingscote (died 1815 from [[tuberculosis]]) in March 1788. He might have met her while he and other fellows were experimenting with [[balloons]]. Jenner's trial balloon descended into [[Kingscote Park, Gloucestershire]], owned by Anthony Kingscote, one of whose daughters was Catharine.<ref>Richard B. Fisher, Edward Jenner (Andre Deutsch, 1991) 40–42</ref>

He earned his MD from the [[University of St Andrews]] in 1792. He is credited with advancing the understanding of [[angina pectoris]].<ref>Journal of the Royal College of Physicians Edinburgh 2011; 41:361–5 {{doi|10.4997/JRCPE.2011.416}}</ref> In his correspondence with Heberden, he wrote, "How much the heart must suffer from the coronary arteries not being able to perform their functions."

==Invention of the vaccine==

Inoculation was already a standard practice, but involved serious risks. In 1721, [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]] had imported [[variolation]] to Britain after having observed it in [[Istanbul]], where her husband was the British ambassador. [[Voltaire]], writing of this, estimates that at this time 60% of the population caught smallpox and 20% of the population died of it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1778voltaire-lettres.asp#Letter%20XI |author=François Marie Arouet de Voltaire |title=Letters on the English or Lettres Philosophiques |year=1778 }}</ref> Voltaire also states that the [[Circassia]]ns used the inoculation from times immemorial, and the custom may have been borrowed by the Turks from the Circassians.<ref>{{Cite web | title=Voltaire on Circassian Medicine: ''Inoculation'' | url=http://www.circassianworld.com/new/history/miscelleneous/1202-circassian-medicine.html | publisher=Circassian World}} from {{cite book| author=Voltaire | title=The Works of Voltaire | volume=Vol. XIX (Philosophical Letters) | year=1733 }}</ref>

[[File:Edward Jenner- Smallpox.svg|thumb|English: The process above shows the steps taken by Edward Jenner to create vaccination. Edward Jenner, the father of vaccination, created the first vaccine for smallpox. He did this by inoculating James Phipps with cowpox, a similar virus of smallpox, to create immunity, unlike variolation, which used smallpox to create an immunity to itself.]]

In 1765, [[John Fewster]] published a paper in the [[London Medical Society]] entitled "Cow pox and its ability to prevent smallpox", but did not pursue the subject further.<ref>{{cite book |title=The greatest killer: smallpox in history, with a new introduction |last=Hopkins |first=Donald R. |year=2002 |publisher=University Of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-35168-1 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=z2zMKsc1Sn0C&lpg=PA80&pg=PA80&q=dr%20fewster#v=snippet&q=dr%20fewster&f=false}}</ref>

In the years following 1770, at least five investigators in England and Germany (Sevel, Jensen, Jesty 1774, Rendell, Plett 1791) successfully tested a cowpox vaccine in humans against smallpox.<ref name="PlettSudhoffs"/> For example, [[Dorset]] farmer [[Benjamin Jesty]]<ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 2279376| author= Hammarsten J. F. | pmid = 390826 | title = Who discovered smallpox vaccination?

Indeed, Jenner may have been aware of Jesty's procedures and success.<ref>{{cite book |last=Grant |first=John |title=Corrupted Science: Fraud, Ideology and Politics in Science| publisher= Facts, Figures & Fun |location=London |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-904332-73-2 |page=24}}</ref>

}}
Noting the common observation that milkmaids were generally immune to smallpox, Jenner postulated that the [[pus]] in the blisters that milkmaids received from [[cowpox]] (a disease similar to smallpox, but much less virulent) protected them from smallpox.

On 14 May 1796, Jenner tested his hypothesis by inoculating [[James Phipps]], an eight-year-old boy who was the son of Jenner's gardener. He scraped pus from cowpox blisters on the hands of Sarah Nelmes, a milkmaid who had caught cowpox from a cow called Blossom,<ref name="JennerMuseum"/> whose hide now hangs on the wall of the St George's medical school library (now in Tooting). Phipps was the 17th case described in Jenner's first paper<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=1556742&pageno=13 An Inquiry into the Causes and Effects of the Variolae Vaccinae, Edward Jenner]. Retrieved 17 November 2012</ref> on [[vaccination]].

Jenner inoculated Phipps in both arms that day, subsequently producing in Phipps a fever and some uneasiness, but no full-blown infection. Later, he injected Phipps with [[variolation|variolous material]], the routine method of immunization at that time. No disease followed. The boy was later challenged with variolous material and again showed no sign of infection.

Donald Hopkins has written, "Jenner's unique contribution was not that he inoculated a few persons with cowpox, but that he then proved [by subsequent challenges] that they were immune to smallpox. Moreover, he demonstrated that the protective cowpox pus could be effectively inoculated from person to person, not just directly from cattle.<ref name="Hopkins"/> Jenner successfully tested his hypothesis on 23 additional subjects.

Jenner continued his research and reported it to the Royal Society, which did not publish the initial paper. After revisions and further investigations, he published his findings on the 23 cases. Some of his conclusions were correct, some erroneous; modern microbiological and microscopic methods would make his studies easier to reproduce. The medical establishment, cautious then as now, deliberated at length over his findings before accepting them. Eventually, vaccination was accepted, and in 1840, the British government banned variolation{{spaced ndash}}the use of smallpox to induce immunity{{spaced ndash}}and provided vaccination using cowpox free of charge. (See [[Vaccination/Vaccination acts|Vaccination acts]]). The success of his discovery soon spread around Europe and, for example, was used ''en masse'' in the Spanish [[Balmis Expedition]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Carlos Franco-Paredes, Lorena Lammoglia, and José Ignacio Santos-Preciado |title=The Spanish Royal Philanthropic Expedition to Bring Smallpox Vaccination to the New World and Asia in the 19th Century |publisher=Oxford Journals |volume=41 |issue=9 |pages=1285–1289 |year=2005 |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/41/9/1285.full |doi= 10.1086/496930}}</ref> a three-year-long mission to the Americas, the Philippines, Macao, China, and Saint Helena Island led by Dr. [[Francisco Javier de Balmis]] with the aim of giving thousands the smallpox vaccine. The expedition was successful, and Jenner wrote, "I don’t imagine the annals of history furnish an example of philanthropy so noble, so extensive as this."

[[File:The cow pock.jpg|thumb|1802 caricature of Jenner vaccinating patients who feared it would make them sprout cowlike appendages.]]
Jenner's continuing work on vaccination prevented him from continuing his ordinary medical practice. He was supported by his colleagues and the King in petitioning Parliament, and was granted £10,000 in 1802 for his work on vaccination. In 1807, he was granted another £20,000 after the Royal College of Physicians had confirmed the widespread efficacy of vaccination.

In 1803 in London, he became president of the '''Jennerian Society''', concerned with promoting vaccination to eradicate [[smallpox]]. The Jennerian ceased operations in 1809. In 1808, with government aid, the National Vaccine Establishment was founded, but Jenner felt dishonoured by the men selected to run it and resigned his directorship.<ref>John Baron, Life of Edward Jenner (London, 1837), vol. 2, pp. 122–5.</ref> Jenner became a member of the Medical and Chirurgical Society on its founding in 1805 and presented a number of papers there. The society is now the [[Royal Society of Medicine]]. He was elected a foreign honorary member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1802.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter J|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterJ.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref> In 1806, Jenner was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

Returning to London in 1811, Jenner observed a significant number of cases of smallpox after vaccination. He found that in these cases the severity of the illness was notably diminished by previous vaccination. In 1821, he was appointed physician extraordinary to [[King George IV]], a great national honour, and was also made mayor of Berkeley and justice of the peace. He continued to investigate natural history, and in 1823, the last year of his life, he presented his "Observations on the Migration of Birds" to the Royal Society.

[[File:Sample of Edward Jenners hair, 1823. (9660576351).jpg|thumb|right|hair cut from Jenner's body after his death]]

Jenner was found in a state of [[apoplexy]] on 25 January 1823, with his right side paralysed. He never fully recovered and eventually died of an apparent stroke, his second, on 26 January 1823, aged 73. He was survived by one son and one daughter, his elder son having died of tuberculosis at the age of 21.

In 1979, the [[World Health Organization]] declared smallpox an eradicated disease.<ref>{{cite web |author=World Health Organization |title=Smallpox |year=2001 |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/smallpox/en/index.html}}</ref> This was the result of coordinated public health efforts by many people, but vaccination was an essential component. And although the disease was declared eradicated, some pus samples still remain in laboratories in [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], in the United States, and in [[State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR]] in [[Koltsovo, Novosibirsk Oblast]], Russia.

Jenner's vaccine laid the foundation for contemporary discoveries in [[immunology]].<ref name="JennerEssortment"/> In 2002, Jenner was named in the [[BBC]]'s list of the [[100 Greatest Britons]] following a UK-wide vote.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-134458/100-great-Britons--A-complete-list.html |title=100 great Britons – A complete list |work=Daily Mail |date=21 August 2002 |accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref>
