It only had a left hand buttonboard, with the right hand simply operating the bellows. One key feature for which Demian sought the patent was the sounding of an entire chord by depressing one key. His instrument also could sound two different chords with the same key; one for each bellows direction (a<space/><italics>bisonoric</italics><space/>action).</paragraph><paragraph>The piano accordion was first played in German-speaking regions, and then spread over Europe. Some early portable instrument with piano keys had been invented in 1821, but it started to actually be played much later, and built its reputation from there.</paragraph><paragraph>At that time in Vienna, mouth harmonicas with<space/><italics>Kanzellen</italics><space/>(chambers) had already been available for many years, along with bigger instruments driven by hand bellows. The<space/><link><target>diatonic</target></link><space/>key arrangement was also already in use on mouth-blown instruments. Demian's patent thus covered an accompanying instrument: an accordion played with the left hand, opposite to the way that contemporary chromatic hand harmonicas were played, small and light enough for travelers to take with them and used to accompany singing. The patent also described instruments with both<space/><link><target>Bass (sound)</target><part>bass</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Wiktionary</target><part>treble</part></link><space/>sections, although Demian preferred the bass-only instrument owing to its cost and weight advantages.<extension extension_name='ref' group="notes">German Text: &quot;Mit den Dekel des Balges, lt sich das ganze Instrument verdoppeln, so da man dadurch die Accorde vermehrt, oder auch mit einzelne Tne spielen kann, in diesem Fall, mu ein zweyter Einsatz mit Federn, und auch eine 2te Claviatur dazu kommen, der Blasebalg bleibt in der Mitte, jede Hand dirigirt abwechselnd, entweder die Claves, oder den Balg.

Through this doubling or increasing of chords within the instrument nothing new is invented or improved by someone else, because only the amount of similar parts is increased and the Instrument is heavier and more expensive.<link type='external' href='http://www.akkordeon-online.de/instrum/demian.htm'>German full text</link></extension></paragraph><paragraph>By 1831 at least the accordion had appeared in Britain.<extension extension_name='ref'><italics>The Times</italics>, Thursday, 3 March 1831; pg. 7; Issue 14477; col C :POPULAR JOURNAL of MUSIC On the 1st.
