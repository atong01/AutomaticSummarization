The word &quot;Bohemian&quot; has never been widely used by the local Czech population. In<space/><link><target>Czech language</target><part>Czech</part></link>, the region since the early Middle Ages has been called<space/><italics>echy</italics><space/>but also, especially during the period of restoration/emancipation of the Czech language and nation, as<space/><italics>echie.</italics><space/>Another term, stressing the importance of the state/nation, is<space/><italics>Krlovstv esk</italics><space/>(&quot;Czech Kingdom&quot;) in Czech, or<space/><italics>Bhmen</italics><space/>(Knigreich) in German. Its mainly Czech-speaking inhabitants were called<space/><italics>echov</italics><space/>(in modern Czech<space/><italics>ei</italics>).</paragraph><paragraph>In most other Western European vernaculars and in Latin (as<space/><italics>Bohemi</italics>), the word &quot;Bohemian&quot; or a derivate was used. If the Czech ethnic origin was to be stressed, combinations such as &quot;Bohemian of Bohemian language&quot; (<italics>ech eskho jazyka</italics>), &quot;a real Bohemian&quot; (<italics>prav ech</italics>), etc. were used.</paragraph><paragraph>It was not until the 19th century that other European languages began to use words related to &quot;Czechs&quot; (as in English,<space/><italics>Tschechen</italics><space/>in<space/><link><target>German language</target><part>German</part></link>,<space/><italics>Tchques</italics><space/>in<space/><link><target>French language</target><part>French</part></link>) in a deliberate (and successful) attempt to distinguish between ethnic Slavic-speaking Bohemians and other inhabitants of Bohemia. The latter were mostly<space/><link><target>ethnic Germans</target></link>, who identified as &quot;German Bohemians&quot; (<italics>Deutschbhmen</italics>) or simply as &quot;Bohemians&quot; (<italics>Bhmen</italics>). In many parts of Europe, state citizenship was not identical with ethnicity and language, and the various peoples were usually identified by their language. Ethnic boundaries in Bohemia were not always sharp, and people very often were bilingual. Intermarriages across language borders were also common. Native Czech speakers nearly often spoke German and many native German speakers spoke Czech with varying fluency, particularly in areas with many Czech speakers.</paragraph><paragraph>Currently, the word &quot;Bohemians&quot; is sometimes used when speaking about persons from Bohemia of all ethnic origins, especially before the year 1918, when the Kingdom of Bohemia ceased to exist. It is also used to distinguish between inhabitants of the western part (Bohemia proper) of the state, and the eastern (<link><target>Moravia</target></link>) or north-eastern (<link><target>Czech Silesia</target><part>Silesia</part></link>) parts.</paragraph><paragraph>The term &quot;<link><target>Bohemianism</target></link>&quot;, as associated with &quot;social unconventionality&quot;, comes from the French<space/><italics>bohmien.</italics><space/>This referred to<space/><link><target>Names of the Romani people</target><part>Gypsy</part></link><space/>&quot;because<space/><link><target>Romani people</target></link><space/>were thought to come from Bohemia, or because they perhaps entered the West through Bohemia&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Oxford"></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Name of the Czech Republic</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Czech studies</target><part>Bohemistics</part></link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>References</heading><list type='def'><listitem><defkey>Notes</defkey></listitem></list><paragraph><template><target>reflist</target></template></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Category:Bohemia</target><part>Bohemian</part></link><link><target>Category:Ethnic groups in the Czech Republic</target></link></paragraph></article>
