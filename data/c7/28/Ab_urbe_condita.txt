"'''''ab urbe condita'''''" (related to "'''''anno urbis conditae'''''"; '''A. U. C.''', '''AUC''', '''a.u.c.'''; also "'''''anno urbis'''''", short '''a.u.'''<ref>[[Cassius Dio|Dio]] uses "a.u." in his ''Roman History''</ref>) is a [[Latin]] phrase meaning "from the [[founding of Rome|founding of the City]] (Rome)",<ref>Literally translated as "From the city having been founded".</ref> traditionally dated to 753 BC. AUC is a year-numbering system used by some ancient [[Roman historian]]s to identify particular Roman years. Renaissance editors sometimes added AUC to Roman manuscripts they published, giving the false impression that the Romans usually numbered their years using the AUC system. The dominant method of identifying Roman years in Roman times was to name the two [[Roman consul|consul]]s who held office that year. The [[regnal year]] of the emperor was also used to identify years, especially in the [[Byzantine Empire]] after 537 when [[Justinian]] required its use. Examples of continuous numbering include counting by regnal year, principally found in the writings of German authors, for example [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen's]] ''[[History of Rome (Mommsen)|History of Rome]]'', and (most ubiquitously) in the [[Anno Domini]] year-numbering system.

==Significance==
The traditional date for the founding of Rome of 21 April 753 BC, was initiated by 1st century BC scholar [[Marcus Terentius Varro]]. Varro may have used the consular list with its mistakes, and called the year of the first consuls "245 ''ab urbe condita''", accepting the 244-year interval from [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] for the kings after the foundation of Rome. The correctness of Varro's calculation has not been proven scientifically but is still used worldwide.

From Emperor [[Claudius]] (reigned 41â€“54 AD) onwards, Varro's calculation superseded other contemporary calculations. Celebrating the anniversary of the city became part of imperial [[propaganda]]. Claudius was the first to hold magnificent celebrations in honour of the city's anniversary, in 48 [[Anno Domini|AD]], 800 years after the founding of the city. [[Hadrian]] and [[Antoninus Pius]] held similar celebrations, in 121 AD and 147/148 AD respectively.

During 248 AD, [[Philip the Arab]] celebrated Rome's first [[millennium]], together with [[Ludi saeculares]] for Rome's alleged tenth [[saeculum]]. [[Coin]]s from his reign commemorate the celebrations. A coin by a contender for the imperial throne, [[Pacatianus]], explicitly states "Year one thousand and first", which is an indication that the citizens of the Empire had a sense of the beginning of a new era, a ''Saeculum Novum''.

When the Roman Empire turned Christian during the following century, this imagery came to be used in a more [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] sense, and removed legal impediments to the development and public use of the ''[[Anno Domini]]'' dating system, which came into general use during the reign of [[Charlemagne]].

==Relationship with Anno Domini==
The [[Anno Domini]] year numbering was developed by a monk named [[Dionysius Exiguus]] in Rome during 525, as a result of his work on calculating the date of Easter. In his Easter table the year 532 AD was equated with the regnal year 248 of Emperor Diocletian. The table counted the years starting from the presumed birth of Christ, rather than the accession of the emperor [[Diocletian]] on 20 November 284, or as stated by Dionysius: "''sed magis elegimus ab incarnatione Domini nostri Jesu Christi annorum tempora praenotare...''"<ref>''Liber de Paschate'', [[Jacques Paul Migne|Migne]], ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'', [http://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC12663742&id=LcEYeL-4ZuEC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP10&dq=%22in+hoc+tomo+LXVII#PRA1-PT165,M1 Volume 67, page 481, note f]</ref> Blackburn and Holford-Strevens review interpretations of Dionysius which place the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] in 2 BC, 1 BC, or 1 AD.<ref>Blackburn, B. & Holford-Strevens, L, ''The Oxford Companion to the Year'' (Oxford University Press, 2003 corrected reprinting, originally 1999) 778&ndash;780.</ref> It was later calculated (from the historical record of the succession of [[List of Roman consuls|Roman consuls]]) that the year 1 AD corresponds to the Roman year 754 AUC, based on Varro's epoch. This however resulted in that year not corresponding with the lifetimes of historical figures reputed to be alive, or otherwise mentioned in connection with the Christian incarnation, e.g. [[Herod the Great]] or [[Publius Sulpicius Quirinius|Quirinius]].<ref>Suetonius, Lives of the Caesars: Tiberius, 49</ref>
