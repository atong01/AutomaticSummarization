This red sandstone-clad building, with its distinctive 'wave-shaped' organic roof planted with sedum, houses displays on the history of the Abbey and some of the best surviving stonework and other relics. The upper storey features a scale model of the Abbey complex, a computer-generated 'fly-through' reconstruction of the church as it was when complete, and a viewing gallery with excellent views of the ruins. The centre won the 2002 Angus Design Award. An archaeological investigation of the site of the visitors' centre before building started revealed the foundations of the medieval precinct wall, with a gateway, and stonework discarded during manufacture, showing that the area was the site of the masons' yard while the Abbey was being built.</paragraph><heading level='2'>In fiction</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Ruins of Arbroath Abbey (18thC).JPG</target><part>thumb</part><part>The ruins of the Abbey in the late 18th century</part></link>Arbroath Abbey was the basis for the description of the ruined monastery of St Ruth in<space/><link><target>Sir Walter Scott</target></link>'s<space/><italics><link><target>The Antiquary</target></link></italics>.<extension extension_name='ref'>Walter Scott,<space/><italics>The Antiquary</italics><space/>(London, 1895), p. 181</extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Burials</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>William the Lion</target></link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>See also</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Abbot of Arbroath</target></link>, for a list of abbots and commendators</listitem></list><heading level='2'>Notes</heading><paragraph><template><target>Reflist</target></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>References</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><template><target>EB1911</target><arg name="wstitle">Arbroath</arg><arg name="volume">2</arg></template></listitem><listitem><template><target>cite NIE</target><arg name="wstitle">Arbroath</arg></template></listitem><listitem><template><target>cite CE1913</target><arg name="wstitle">Abbey of Arbroath</arg><arg name="first">David Oswald Hunter</arg><arg name="last"><space/>Blair</arg></template></listitem></list><heading level='2'>External links</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><template><target>historic-Scotland-link</target><arg>013</arg></template></listitem></list><preblock><preline></preline></preblock><list type='bullet'><listitem><link type='external' href='http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/buildings/arbabbey.htm'>Angus Council, Arbroath Abbey history</link></listitem><listitem><link type='external' href='http://web.archive.org/web/20060205114939/http://uk.geocities.com/brotherrichard2000/new_page_2.htm'>Arbroath Abbey pageant</link><space/>Archive link</listitem><listitem><link type='external' href='http://www.angus.gov.uk/new/releases-archive/2003/2003-02-07a.html'>2002 Angus Design Award</link></listitem><listitem><link type='external' href='http://digital.nls.uk/slezer/engraving.cfm?sl=41'>Engraving of Arbroath Abbey in 1693</link><space/>by<space/><link><target>John Slezer</target></link><space/>at National Library of Scotland</listitem></list><paragraph><template><target>World Heritage Site 'Tentative List' applicants in Scotland</target></template><template><target>coord</target><arg>56</arg><arg>33</arg><arg>45</arg><arg>N</arg><arg>2</arg><arg>34</arg><arg>56</arg><arg>W</arg><arg>type:landmark_region:GB</arg><arg name="display">title</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Category:1178 establishments in Scotland</target></link><link><target>Category:16th-century disestablishments in Scotland</target></link><link><target>Category:Buildings and structures in Angus</target></link><link><target>Category:Christian monasteries in Scotland</target></link><link><target>Category:History of Angus</target></link><link><target>Category:Tironensian monasteries</target></link><link><target>Category:Category A listed buildings in Angus</target></link><link><target>Category:Listed monasteries in Scotland</target></link><link><target>Category:Museums in Angus</target></link><link><target>Category:Archaeological museums in Scotland</target></link><link><target>Category:Religious museums in Scotland</target></link><link><target>Category:Scottish parliamentary locations and buildings</target></link><link><target>Category:Ruined abbeys and monasteries</target></link><link><target>Category:Ruins in Angus</target></link></paragraph></article>
