==Life==

===Early life and career===
Affre was born at [[Saint-Rome-de-Tarn]], in the department of [[Aveyron]]. At the age of 14, he began to study for the priesthood at the Seminary of [[Saint-Sulpice, Paris]], which was under the direction of his uncle, the [[Abbé]] Denis Boyer, [[Society of Saint-Sulpice|S.S.]] He was an excellent student, and, while still a seminarian, soon became an instructor of [[dogmatic theology]] at the seminary in [[Nantes]]. 
In 1818, he was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] as a [[Catholic priest]]. 
From 1823-1833 he served as the [[Vicar General]], first of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Luçon|
Diocese of Luçon]] and then of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Amiens|Amiens]]. 
In 1839, he was appointed as [[coadjutor bishop]] of the [[Diocese of Strasbourg]].{{sfn|Grey|1913}}

The following year, Affre was elevated to the post of [[Archbishop of Paris]]. Though opposed to the government of King [[Louis-Philippe I]], he fully accepted the establishment of the [[French Second Republic]] in 1848,<ref name=DP>{{cite web|url=http://www.paris.catholique.fr/645-Denis-Auguste-Affre-1840-1848.html|work=Diocèse de Paris|title=Denis-Auguste Affre (1840-1848)|language=fr}}</ref> nevertheless he took no part in politics, but devoted himself to [[pastoral care]]. He opened new [[parish]]es in the working-class neighborhoods of the city. Among them were: Ménilmontant, Plaisance, Petit-Montrouge, Maison-Blanche, Petit-Gentilly, Notre-Dame de la Gare, Billancourt, Gros-Caillou.<ref name=DP/>

Affre was passionate in his determination to improve the study of theology in order to form clergy needed in the challenges which the Catholic Church faced at the time. 
He also was insistent on education as a human right. 
He opened a new seminary in Paris, called the [[:fr:Séminaire des Carmes|St. Joseph of the Carmelites Seminary]], on the site of a former Carmelite [[priory]], and a [[school of theology]] at the [[Sorbonne]].

===Death===
Affre's episcopate, however, is chiefly remembered owing to its tragic close during the [[insurrection of June 1848]].

On 23 June of that year, faced with starvation due to plans by the French government to close the [[National Workshops]] it had recently created in order to provide work to the poor, a large segment of the citizenry began rioting, setting up barricades in the streets of Paris. The crisis led to the government's handing dictatorial powers over the nation to General [[Louis Eugène Cavaignac]], who was determined to use all force necessary to crush the rebellion and ordered the [[National Guard (France)|French National Guard]] into Paris. Seeing the carnage caused among the civilian population caused by this campaign, [[Frederic Ozanam]], the founder of the [[Society of St. Vincent de Paul]], begged Affre to intervene to stop the bloodshed. The archbishop was led to believe that by his personal involvement peace might be restored between the military and the [[Insurgency|insurgent]]s.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Accordingly, on 25 June, in spite of the warning of Cavaignac, Affre mounted the barricade at the entrance to the [[Saint-Antoine-des-Champs|Faubourg Saint-Antoine]], bearing a green branch as sign of peace to address both sides. He had spoken only a few words, however, when the insurgents, hearing some shots and feeling that they had been betrayed, opened fire upon the National Guard. Affre fell, struck by a stray bullet. He was taken to his palace, where he died on 27 June.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

On the next day, the [[National Assembly of France]] issued a decree expressing their great sorrow over Affre's death, and the public funeral held on 7 July was one of the most striking public spectacles of the period. The crowd following his [[cortege]] was estimated to have numbered about 200,000 people.

Affre was buried in the Chapel of Saint-Denis in the Cathedral of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]]. His heart was removed and preserved in the chapel of the Carmelite Seminary, which he had founded. The [[pectoral cross]] which he was wearing when he was shot—seen in his portrait—is preserved by the Archdiocese of Paris as a [[relic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paris.catholique.fr/651-Croix-pectorale.html|work=Diocèse de Paris|title=Croix pectorale|language=fr}}</ref>

A street in the [[18th arrondissement of Paris]] is named in his honor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paris.catholique.fr/-Saint-Bernard-de-la-Chapelle-.html|work=Diocèse de Paris|title=Saint-Bernard de la Chapelle|language=fr}}</ref>

==Writings==
Affre wrote several articles for a newspaper called ''La France chrétienne''. Additionally he published two books to guide in the practical matters of handling Church property: '' Un Traité de l'administration temporelle des paroisses'' (Paris, 1827) and ''Un Traité de la propriété des biens ecclésiastiques'' (Paris, 1837). He also wrote a guide to studying the Christian faith, ''Une Introduction philosophique à l'étude du christianisme'' (Paris, 5th edition, 1846).
