In 1996, Mumy and his ''Lost in Space'' costar [[Jonathan Harris]] were reunited at a [[Walt Disney]] convention in [[Orlando, Florida]]. Mumy worked again with Harris on the retrospective special ''Lost In Space: Forever'' (1998), where they reprised their roles in a scene written by Mumy (Harris rewrote his own lines). This occurred the year after the rest of the cast (including both Mumy and Harris) stated in a ''[[TV Guide]]'' article that the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] planned to do a ''Lost in Space'' marathon while promoting a new movie. Harris was to appear in the planned TV movie, ''Lost in Space: The Journey Home'', but died before production started in 2002, and the production was subsequently cancelled. Mumy read the eulogy at Harris' funeral and was asked to narrate an account of his longtime friend's life on [[A&E Biography|A&E ''Biography'']] that year. 

In a 2010 interview on ''Blog Talk Radio'''s ''Lessons Learned'', Rick Tocquigny was asked if Mumy was a Jonathan Harris fan before they appeared together on ''Lost in Space''. Tocquigny said that at age five, Mumy was too young to watch his mentor's show ''[[The Third Man (TV series)|The Third Man]]'', which would have been aired late at night, but he was old enough to see ''[[The Bill Dana Show]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blogtalkradio.com/lifelessonsnetwork/2010/09/22/bill-mumy-of-lost-in-space-fame-shares-his-life-lessons|title=Bill Mumy of Lost in Space fame shares his life lessons 09/22 by Lessons Learned|publisher=Blog Talk Radio|date=2010-09-22|accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref>

On June 14, 2006, Mumy got to work with Harris one last time, though posthumously. Years before Harris died, he recorded voice work for the animated short ''[[The Bolt Who Screwed Christmas]],'' narrating the film and playing the part of The Bolt. As a tribute to Harris, writer-director [[John Wardlaw]] added a scene that reunited ''Lost in Space'' cast members Mumy, [[Marta Kristen]], and [[Angela Cartwright]] as the animated Ratchett family.<ref>[http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/cultist/2011/07/the_bolt_who_screwed_christmas.php Profile], miaminewtimes.com; accessed February 15, 2015.</ref>

In May 2013, 11 years after Harris' death in November 2002, Mumy commented on his connection with his friend and acting mentor offscreen and their onscreen connection while working  in character as Will Robinson and Dr. Smith oncreen, in ''Lost in Space''. Mumy noted: "I never really had too many uncomfortable moments working with any actor. I was comfortable working with most everybody. It’s just the more that Jonathan and I did together, the more he changed the character. He really changed the character of Dr. Smith himself. He really turned him from a snarling saboteur villain to this bumbling insulting kook. The more he played it for comedy, the more Irwin Allen liked it. The show really went the way that Jonathan led it. But we had great chemistry together, and we never had a bad day. We were always prepared, as was Bobby May who was inside the robot. When we had our work to do—and I think this is a very big reason [for] the way it went—they’d get us done in a couple of takes. Nobody screwed up. It was easier for the crew and it was easier for us, and people seemed to like it."<ref>[http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/billmumy Profile], popcultureaddict.com; accessed February 15, 2015.</ref>
