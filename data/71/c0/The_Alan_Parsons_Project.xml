Through the late 1970s and early 1980s, the group's popularity continued to grow (although they were always more popular in North America and<space/><link><target>Continental Europe</target></link><space/>than in their home country, never achieving a UK Top 40 single or Top 20 album).

This eventually led to a rift between the two artists. While Parsons pursued his own solo career and took many members of the Project on the road for the first time in a successful worldwide tour, Woolfson went on to produce musical plays influenced by the Project's music.<space/><italics><link><target>Freudiana</target></link></italics>,<space/><italics>Gaudi</italics><space/>and<space/><italics>Gambler</italics><space/>were three musicals that included some Project songs like &quot;Eye in the Sky&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Inside Looking Out&quot;, and &quot;Limelight&quot;.

The Sicilian Defence album was never released and never will be, if I have anything to do with it. I have not heard it since it was finished.

On the 2007 deluxe edition release, it is revealed that parts of this tape were used for the 1976 Griffith Park Planetarium launch of the original album, the 1987 remix, and various radio spots, all of which were included as bonus material.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Sound</heading><paragraph>Most of the Project's titles, especially the early work, share common traits (likely influenced by<space/><link><target>Pink Floyd</target></link>'s<space/><italics><link><target>The Dark Side of the Moon</target></link></italics>, on which Parsons was the<space/><link><target>audio engineer</target></link><space/>in 1973). They were<space/><link><target>concept album</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and typically began with an<space/><link><target>instrumental</target></link><space/>introduction, which faded into the first song, often had an instrumental piece in the middle of the second<space/><link><target>gramophone record</target><part>LP</part></link><space/>side, and concluded with a quiet, melancholic, or powerful song. The opening instrumental was largely done away with by 1980; no later Project album except<space/><italics><link><target>Eye in the Sky (album)</target><part>Eye in the Sky</part></link></italics><space/>featured one (although every album includes at least one instrumental somewhere in the running order). The instrumental on that album, &quot;Sirius&quot;, eventually became the best-known (or at least most frequently heard) Parsons instrumental. It was used as entrance music by various American sports teams, most notably by the<space/><link><target>Chicago Bulls</target></link><space/>during their 1990s<space/><link><target>National Basketball Association</target><part>NBA</part></link><space/><link><target>dynasty (sports)</target><part>dynasty</part></link>.

Lead vocal duties were shared by guest vocalists chosen by their vocal style to complement each song. In later years, Woolfson sang lead on many of the group's hits (including &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Eye in the Sky&quot; and &quot;Don't Answer Me&quot;); however, he did not sing any lead vocals on the band's first four albums and appeared as vocalist only sporadically thereafter. When the Woolfson-sung songs became significant hits, the record company pressured Parsons to use him more, but Parsons preferred &quot;real&quot; singers, which Woolfson admitted he was not.
