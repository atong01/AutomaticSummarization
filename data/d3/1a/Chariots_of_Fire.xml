Eric tells her that though he intends to eventually return to the China mission, he feels divinely inspired when running, and that not to run would be to dishonour God, saying, &quot;I believe that God made me for a purpose. But He also made me fast, and when I run, I feel His pleasure.&quot;</paragraph><paragraph>The two athletes, after years of training and racing, are accepted to represent Great Britain in the<space/><link><target>1924 Summer Olympics</target><part>1924 Olympics</part></link><space/>in Paris.

While boarding the boat to Paris for the Olympics, Liddell learns the news that the heat for his 100-metre race will be on a Sunday.

He knows his last chance for a medal will be the 100 metres. He competes in the race, and wins. His coach Sam Mussabini is overcome that the years of dedication and training have paid off with an Olympic gold medal. Now Abrahams can get on with his life and reunite with his girlfriend Sybil, whom he had neglected for the sake of running. Before Liddell's race, the American coach remarks dismissively to his runners that Liddell has little chance of doing well in his now far longer 400 metre race. But one of the American runners,<space/><link><target>Jackson Scholz</target></link>, hands Liddell a note of support for his convictions. Liddell defeats the American favourites and wins the gold medal.</paragraph><paragraph>The British team returns home triumphant. As the film ends, onscreen text explains that Abrahams married Sybil, and became the elder statesman of British athletics. Liddell went on to missionary work in China.

In the film, he doesn't learn that the 100-metre heat is to be held on the Christian Sabbath until he is boarding the boat to Paris. In fact, the schedule was made public several months in advance.

Full headline reads, &quot;Did You Know That Famous Scotch Sprinter Will Not Run in the Olympic 100 Metres Because The Trials Are Run on Sunday&quot;.</extension><space/>The decision to change races was, even so, made well before embarking to Paris, and Liddell spent the intervening months training for the 400 metres, an event in which he had previously excelled. It is true, nonetheless, that Liddell's success in the Olympic 400m was largely unexpected.</paragraph><paragraph>The film depicts Lindsay, having already won a medal in the 400-metre hurdles, giving up his place in the 400-metre race for Liddell. In fact<space/><link><target>David Burghley</target><part>Burghley</part></link>, on whom Lindsay is loosely based, was eliminated in the heats of the 110 hurdles (he would go on to win a gold medal in the 400 hurdles at the 1928 Olympics), and was not entered for the 400 metres.</paragraph><paragraph>The film reverses the order of Abrahams' 100m and 200m races at the Olympics. In reality, after winning the 100 metres race, Abrahams ran the<space/><link><target>200 metres</target></link><space/>but finished last,<space/><link><target>Jackson Scholz</target></link><space/>taking the gold medal. In the film, before his triumph in the 100m, Abrahams is shown losing the 200m and being scolded by Mussabini. And during the following scene in which Abrahams speaks with his friend Montague while receiving a massage from Mussabini, there is a French newspaper clipping showing Scholz and<space/><link><target>Charlie Paddock</target></link><space/>with a headline which states that the 200 metres was a triumph for the United States. In the same conversation, Abrahams laments getting &quot;beaten out of sight&quot; in the 200. The film thus has Abrahams overcoming the disappointment of losing the 200 by going on to win the 100, a reversal of the real order.</paragraph><paragraph>Eric Liddell actually also ran in the 200m race, and finished third, behind Paddock and Scholz. This was the only time in reality that Liddell and Abrahams competed in the same race.
