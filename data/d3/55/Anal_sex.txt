As with most forms of sexual activity, anal sex participants risk contracting [[sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs/STDs). Anal sex is considered a high-risk sexual practice because of the vulnerability of the anus and rectum.

Strong views are often expressed about anal sex. It is controversial in various cultures, especially with regard to [[religion and homosexuality|religious prohibitions]]. This is commonly due to prohibitions against anal sex among gay men or teachings about the [[Reproduction|procreative]] purpose of sexual activity.<ref name="Dean and Delvin"/><ref name="LeRoy"/><ref name="Discovery.com"/> It may be regarded as [[taboo]] or unnatural, and is a [[Crime|criminal offense]] in some countries, punishable by [[Corporal punishment|corporal]] or [[capital punishment]]; by contrast, people also regard anal sex as a natural and valid form of sexual activity that may be as fulfilling as other desired sexual expressions. They may regard it as an enhancing element of their [[Sex life|sex lives]] or as their primary form of sexual activity.<ref name="Dean and Delvin"/><ref name="LeRoy"/><ref name="Discovery.com"/>

The abundance of [[Nerve|nerve endings]] in the anal region and [[rectum]] can make anal sex pleasurable for men or women.<ref name="Answer"/><ref name="Carroll"/><ref name="LeRoy"/> The [[Sphincter ani internus muscle|internal]] and [[Sphincter ani externus muscle|external]] [[sphincter]] muscles control the opening and closing of the anus; these muscles, which are sensitive membranes made up of many nerve endings, facilitate pleasure or pain during anal sex.<ref name="Carroll"/><ref name="LeRoy"/> The ''Human Sexuality: An Encyclopedia'' states that "the inner third of the anal canal is less sensitive to touch than the outer two-thirds, but is more sensitive to pressure" and that "the rectum is a curved tube about eight or nine inches long and has the capacity, like the anus, to expand".<ref name="LeRoy"/>

In a 2010 clinical review article of heterosexual anal sex, the term ''anal intercourse'' is used to refer specifically to penile-anal penetration, and ''anal sex'' is used to refer to any form of anal sexual activity. The review suggests that anal sex is exotic among the sexual practices of some heterosexuals and that "for a certain number of heterosexuals, anal intercourse is pleasurable, exciting, and perhaps considered more intimate than vaginal sex".<ref name="McBride and Fortenberry"/>

Anal intercourse is sometimes used as a substitute for vaginal intercourse during [[menstruation]].<ref name="LeRoy"/> The likelihood of [[pregnancy]] occurring<!-- NOTE: This paragraph, including this line, relates to practice far more than it does to health, so it seemingly fits better here than in the Health risks section. --> during anal sex is greatly reduced, as anal sex alone cannot lead to pregnancy unless sperm is somehow transported to the vaginal opening.

Male-to-female anal sex is commonly viewed as a way of preserving female [[virginity]] because it is non-procreative and does not tear the [[hymen]]; a person, especially a teenage girl or woman, who engages in anal sex or other sexual activity with no history of having engaged in vaginal intercourse is often regarded among heterosexuals and researchers as not having yet experienced virginity loss.

===Prevalence===

In 1992, a study conducted by the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) found that 26% of men 18 to 59 and 20% of women 18 to 59 had engaged in heterosexual anal sex; a similar 2005 survey (also conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) found a rising incidence of anal sex relations in the American heterosexual population. The survey showed that 40% of men and 35% of women between 25 and 44 had engaged in heterosexual anal sex.<ref>William D. Mosher, PhD; Anjani Chandra, PhD; and Jo Jones, PhD, [http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ad/ad362.pdf Sexual Behavior and Selected Health Measures: Men and Women 15–44 Years of Age], U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES, Division of Vital Statistics, September 15, 2005</ref> In terms of overall numbers of survey respondents, seven times as many women as gay men said that they engaged in anal intercourse, with this figure reflecting the larger heterosexual population size.<ref>[[Anne-Christine d'Adesky]], ''Expanding Microbicide Research'' in amfAR Global Link&nbsp;– Treatment Insider; May 2004</ref>

In a 2007 report regarding the prevalence and correlates of heterosexual anal and oral sex among adolescents and adults in the United States, a National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) found that 34% men and 30% women reported ever participating in heterosexual anal sex. The percentage of participants reporting heterosexual anal sex was significantly higher among 20- to 24-year-olds and peaked among 30- to 34-year-olds.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=18190267 | doi=10.1086/522867 | volume=196 | issue=12 | title=Prevalence and correlates of heterosexual anal and oral sex in adolescents and adults in the United States |date=December 2007 | journal=J. Infect. Dis. | pages=1852–9 | author=Leichliter JS, Chandra A, Liddon N, Fenton KA, Aral SO}}</ref> A 2008 survey focused on a younger demographic of teenagers and young adults, aged 15–21. It found that 16% of 1350 surveyed had had this type of sex in the previous 3 months, with condoms being used 29% of the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/18245402/detail.html#- |title=Bradley Hasbro Children's Research Center}}</ref> However, given the subject matter, the survey hypothesized the prevalence was probably underestimated.<!-- A direct quote would be preferable here -->

In Kimberly R. McBride's 2010 clinical review on heterosexual anal intercourse and other forms of anal sexual activity, it is suggested that changing [[Norm (social)|norms]] may affect the frequency of heterosexual anal sex. McBride and her colleagues investigated the prevalence of non-intercourse anal sex behaviors among a sample of men (n=1,299) and women (n=1,919) compared to anal intercourse experience and found that 51% of men and 43% of women had participated in at least one act of oral–anal sex, manual–anal sex, or anal sex toy use.<ref name="McBride and Fortenberry"/> The report states the majority of men (n=631) and women (n=856) who reported heterosexual anal intercourse in the past 12 months were in exclusive, monogamous relationships: 69% and 73%, respectively.<ref name="McBride and Fortenberry"/> The review added that "most research on anal intercourse addresses men who have sex with men (MSM), with relatively little attention given to anal intercourse and other anal sexual behaviors between heterosexual partners" and "[r]esearch is quite rare that specifically differentiates the anus as a sexual organ or addresses anal sexual function or dysfunction as legitimate topics. As a result, we do not know the extent to which anal intercourse differs qualitatively from coitus."<ref name="McBride and Fortenberry"/>

According to a 2010 study from the [[National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior]] (NSSHB) that was authored by [[Debby Herbenick]] and other researchers, although anal intercourse is reported by fewer women than other partnered sex behaviors, partnered women in the age groups between 18–49 are significantly more likely to report having anal sex in the past 90 days.<ref>[http://www.nationalsexstudy.indiana.edu/ National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior (NSSHB).] Findings from the National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior, Center for Sexual Health Promotion, Indiana University. ''[[The Journal of Sexual Medicine]]'', Vol. 7, Supplement 5. 2010.</ref> As of 2011, this survey provides the most up to date data about anal sex at the population level.

Figures for prevalence can vary among different demographics, regions and nationalities. A 1999 South Korean survey of 586 women documented that 3.5% of the respondents reported having had anal sex.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.komci.org/GSResult.php?RID=0074KJA/1999.17.3.177&DT=6 |title=한국여성의 성형태에 대한 연구 (Sexual Behavior of Korean Women) |journal=Daehan Namseong Gwahak Hoeji |volume=17 |year=1999 |pages=177–185 |last=Yi |first=Ung-hoe |last2=Sin |first2=Jong-seong |last3=Choe |first3=Hyeong-gi |issue=3}}</ref> By contrast, a 2001 French survey of five hundred female respondents concluded that a total of 29% had engaged in this practice, with one third of these confirming to have enjoyed the experience.<ref name="French">{{cite web|title=Les pratiques sexuelles des Françaises |publisher=TNS/Sofres |url=http://www.tns-sofres.com/etudes/pol/030701_sexualite_r.htm |accessdate=April 30, 2007 |language=French| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070429151130/http://www.tns-sofres.com/etudes/pol/030701_sexualite_r.htm| archivedate = April 29, 2007}} Survey carried out by TNS/Sofres in a representative sample of 500 women from 18 to 65 years of age, in April and May 2002.</ref>

Figures for the prevalence of sexual behavior can also fluctuate over time. Edward O. Laumann's 1992 survey, reported in ''The Social Organization of Sexuality: Sexual Practices in the United States'', found that about 20% of heterosexuals had engaged in male-to-female anal sex. [[Sexology|Sex researcher]] [[Alfred Kinsey]], working in the 1940s, had found that number to be closer to 40% at the time. A researcher from the [[University of British Columbia]] in 2005 put the number of heterosexuals who have engaged in this practice at between 30% and 50%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Healthy sex is all in the talk |publisher=The Georgia Straight |date=May 5, 2005 |url=http://www.straight.com/article/healthy-sex-is-all-in-the-talk |accessdate=June 14, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070629140924/http://www.straight.com/article/healthy-sex-is-all-in-the-talk| archivedate= June 29, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> According to [[Columbia University]]'s health website [[Go Ask Alice!]]: "Studies indicate that about 25 percent of heterosexual couples have had anal sex at least once, and 10 percent regularly have anal penetration."<ref name="Not all"/> The increase of anal sexual activity among heterosexuals has also been linked to the increase in anal pornography, especially if a person views it more regularly than a person who does not.<ref name="Dean and Delvin"/><ref name="Boyle"/><ref name="Johansson"/><ref name="Seidman">{{cite book|title =Introducing the New Sexuality Studies: 2nd Edition|authors=Steven Seidman, Nancy Fischer, Chet Meeks|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2011|pages=108–112|isbn=1136818103|accessdate=December 22, 2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2rmjynItoEkC&pg=PA108}}</ref>

===Prevalence===
Reports with regard to the prevalence of anal sex among gay men in the west have varied over time. Magnus Hirschfeld, in his 1914 work ''The Homosexuality of Men and Women'', reported the rate of anal sex among gay men surveyed to be 8%, the least favored of all the practices documented.<ref>William A. Percy and John Lauritsen, Review in ''The Gay & Lesbian Review'', November–December 2002</ref> By the 1950s in the United Kingdom, it was thought that about 15% of gay males had anal sex.<ref name="Hyde">{{cite book | author =Harford Montgomery Hyde|title=The Love that Dared Not Speak Its Name: A Candid History of Homosexuality in Britain|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company|Little, Brown]]|year=1970|pages=6–7|isbn=|accessdate=August 19, 2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mBkbAAAAYAAJ}}</ref>

Similar to the Hirschfeld study, scholars state that oral sex and mutual masturbation are more common than anal stimulation among gay men in long-term relationships.<ref name="Not all"/><ref name="Johnson and Johnson"/> They say that anal intercourse is generally more popular among gay male couples than among heterosexual couples, but that "it ranks behind oral sex and mutual masturbation" among both sexual orientations in prevalence.<ref name="Weiten"/> Wellings et al. reported that "the equation of 'homosexual' with 'anal' sex among men is common among lay and health professionals alike" and that "yet an Internet survey of 18,000 MSM across Europe (EMIS, 2011) showed that oral sex was most commonly practised, followed by mutual masturbation, with anal intercourse in third place".<ref name="Wellings"/> A 2011 survey by ''[[The Journal of Sexual Medicine]]'' found similar results for U.S. gay and bisexual men.<ref>[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1743-6109.2011.02438.x/abstract Sexual Behaviors and Situational Characteristics of Most Recent Male-Partnered Sexual Event among Gay and Bisexually Identified Men in the United States] onlinelibrary.wiley.com Retrieved 2-13-2014</ref>

Commonly, heterosexual men reject the idea of being receptive partners during anal sex because they believe it is a [[Femininity|feminine]] act, can make them vulnerable, or contradicts their sexual orientation (for example, that it is indicative that they are gay).<ref name="Zdrok"/><ref name="Odets"/> National Institutes of Health (NIH) information published in the ''BMJ'' in 1999, however, states:<blockquote>There are little published data on how many heterosexual men would like their anus to be sexually stimulated in a heterosexual relationship.

What data we do have almost all relate to penetrative sexual acts, and the superficial contact of the anal ring with fingers or the tongue is even less well documented but may be assumed to be a common sexual activity for men of all sexual orientations.<ref name="Robin Bell"/></blockquote>

Most cases of anal cancer are related to infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV).

In later [[Greek literature#Roman Age|Roman-era Greek poetry]], anal sex became a common literary convention, represented as taking place with "eligible" youths: those who had attained the proper age but had not yet become adults. Seducing those not of proper age (for example, non-adolescent children) into the practice was considered very shameful for the adult, and having such relations with a male who was no longer adolescent was considered more shameful for the young male than for the one mounting him; Greek courtesans, or [[hetaera]]e, are said to have frequently practiced heterosexual anal intercourse as a means of preventing pregnancy.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = James E.|year = 1995 | title = The Practices of Romans 1:26: Homosexual or Heterosexual? | url = | journal = Novum Testamentum | volume = 37 | issue = 1| page = 9 | quote = Heterosexual anal intercourse is best illustrated in Classical vase paintings of hetaerae with their clients, and some scholars interpret this as a form of contraception | doi=10.1163/1568536952613631}}</ref>

A male citizen taking the passive (or receptive) role in anal intercourse was condemned in Rome as an act of ''impudicitia'' (immodesty or un[[chastity]]); free men, however, frequently took the active role with a young male slave, known as a ''[[catamite]]'' or ''puer delicatus''. The latter was allowed because anal intercourse was considered equivalent to vaginal intercourse in this way; men were said to "take it like a woman" (muliebria pati, "to undergo womanly things") when they were anally penetrated, but when a man performed anal sex on a woman, she was thought of as playing the boy's role.<ref name="Skinner">{{cite book|title =Invading the Roman Body: Manliness and Impenetrability in Roman Thought.

====Hinduism====
{{See also|History of sex in India|LGBT topics and Hinduism}}

Although Hindu society does not formally acknowledge sexuality between men, it formally acknowledges and gives space to sexuality between men and [[third gender]]s as a variation of male-female sex (meaning a part of heterosexuality, rather than homosexuality, if analyzed in western terms). Hijras, Alis, Kotis, etc. (the various forms of third gender that exist in India today) are all characterized by the gender role of having receptive anal and oral sex with men. However, sexuality between men (as distinct from third genders) has thrived, mostly unspoken and informally, without being seen as different in the way it is seen in the west; young men involved in "such relationships do not consider themselves to be 'homosexual' but conceive their behavior in terms of sexual desire, opportunity and pleasure".<ref>[http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0277953600001672 The social construction of male 'homosexuality' in India], by S Asthana and R. Oostvogels, published in 'Social Science & Medicine', vol 52(2001), Quote: "Indian culture is highly homosocial and displays of affection, body contact and the sharing of beds between men is socially acceptable (Kahn, 1994) This creates opportunities for sexual contact, though sexual behavior in this context is rarely seen as real sex, but as play. Much of this same-sex sexual activity begins in adolescence between school friends and within family environments and is non-penetrative... Young men who cultivate such relationships do not consider themselves to be 'homosexual' but conceive their behavior in terms of sexual desire, opportunity and pleasure."</ref>
