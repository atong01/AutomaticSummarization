However, under the<space/><link><target>American Bar Association</target></link>'s<space/><link><target>American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct</target><part>Model Rules of Professional Conduct</part></link>, which have been adopted in most states, disbarment in one state or court is grounds for disbarment in a jurisdiction which has adopted the Model Rules.</paragraph><paragraph>Disbarment is quite rare. Instead, lawyers are usually sanctioned by their own clients through civil malpractice proceedings, or via fine, censure, suspension, or other punishments from the disciplinary boards. To be disbarred is considered a great embarrassment and shame, even if one no longer wishes to pursue a career in the law.</paragraph><paragraph>Because disbarment rules vary by area, different rules can apply depending on where a lawyer is disbarred. Notably, the majority of US states have no procedure for permanently disbarring a person. Depending on the jurisdiction, a lawyer may reapply to the bar immediately, after five to seven years, or be banned for life.<extension extension_name='ref' name="reapply"><template><target>cite news</target><arg name="url">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3975/is_200707/ai_n19511820/pg_2<space/></arg><arg name="work">The Georgetown Journal of Legal Ethics<space/></arg><arg name="title">Should Permanent Disbarment be Permanent?<space/></arg><arg name="year">2007<space/></arg><arg name="first">Brian<space/></arg><arg name="last">Finkelstein<space/></arg><arg name="deadurl">yes</arg></template><space/><template><target>Dead link</target><arg name="date">June 2012</arg><arg name="bot">RjwilmsiBot</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Notable U.S. disbarments</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>List of disbarments in the United States</arg></template>The 20th and the 21st centuries have seen one former U.S.<space/><link><target>President of the United States</target><part>president</part></link><space/>and one former U.S.<space/><link><target>Vice President of the United States</target><part>vice president</part></link><space/>disbarred, and another president suspended from one bar and caused to resign from another bar rather than face disbarment.</paragraph><paragraph>Former Vice President<space/><link><target>Spiro Agnew</target></link>, having pleaded<space/><link><target>nolo contendere</target><part>no contest</part></link><space/>(which subjects a person to the same criminal penalties as a guilty plea, but is not an admission of guilt for a civil suit) to charges of<space/><link><target>bribery</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>tax evasion</target></link>, was disbarred from<space/><link><target>Maryland</target></link>, the state of which he had previously been<space/><link><target>Governor of Maryland</target><part>governor</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Former President<space/><link><target>Richard Nixon</target></link><space/>was disbarred from<space/><link><target>New York</target></link><space/>in 1976<extension extension_name='ref' name="nixon">http://www.history.com/exhibits/impeach/whthous1.html</extension><space/>for<space/><link><target>obstruction of justice</target></link><space/>related to the<space/><link><target>Watergate scandal</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>In October 2001 the<space/><link><target>United States Supreme Court</target></link><space/>barred President<space/><link><target>Bill Clinton</target></link><space/>from practicing before it.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite news</target><arg name="title">Clinton barred from practicing before Supreme Court</arg><arg name="publisher">CNN<space/></arg><arg name="date">October 2, 2001<space/></arg><arg name="url">http://archives.cnn.com/2001/LAW/10/01/scotus.clinton/<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">November 4, 2012<space/></arg></template></extension><space/>He then resigned from the Supreme Court bar in November.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite news</target><arg name="title">Clinton asks to quit Supreme Court Bar<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">CNN.com<space/></arg><arg name="url">http://archives.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/11/09/clinton.bar/<space/></arg><arg name="date">November 9, 2001<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">September 20, 2007<space/></arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Alger Hiss</target></link><space/>was disbarred for a felony conviction, but later became the first person reinstated to the bar in Massachusetts after disbarment.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.iwannagetthat.com/NewFiles/1948-alger-hiss.html</arg><arg name="title">iWannaGetThat -
