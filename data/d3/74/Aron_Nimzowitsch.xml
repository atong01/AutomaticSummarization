Notable in his &quot;system&quot; were concepts such as<space/><link><target>Glossary of chess#Overprotection</target><part>overprotection</part></link><space/>of pieces and pawns under attack, control of the center by pieces instead of pawns, blockading of opposing pieces (notably the<space/><link><target>passed pawns</target></link>) and<space/><link><target>prophylaxis (chess)</target><part>prophylaxis</part></link>.
