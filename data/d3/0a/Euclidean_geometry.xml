Euclidean geometry also allows the method of superposition, in which a figure is transferred to another point in space. For example, proposition I.4, side-angle-side congruence of triangles, is proved by moving one of the two triangles so that one of its sides coincides with the other triangle's equal side, and then proving that the other sides coincide as well. Some modern treatments add a sixth postulate, the rigidity of the triangle, which can be used as an alternative to superposition.<extension extension_name='ref'>Coxeter, p. 5</extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>System of measurement and arithmetic</heading><paragraph>Euclidean geometry has two fundamental types of measurements:<space/><link><target>angle</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Euclidean distance</target><part>distance</part></link>. The angle scale is absolute, and Euclid uses the<space/><link><target>right angle</target></link><space/>as his basic unit, so that, e.g., a 45-<link><target>degree (angle)</target><part>degree</part></link><space/>angle would be referred to as half of a right angle. The distance scale is relative; one arbitrarily picks a line segment with a certain nonzero length as the unit, and other distances are expressed in relation to it. Addition of distances is represented by a construction in which one line segment is copied onto the end of another line segment to extend its length, and similarly for subtraction.</paragraph><paragraph>Measurements of<space/><link><target>area (geometry)</target><part>area</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>volume</target></link><space/>are derived from distances. For example, a<space/><link><target>rectangle</target></link><space/>with a width of 3 and a length of 4 has an area that represents the product, 12. Because this geometrical interpretation of multiplication was limited to three dimensions, there was no direct way of interpreting the product of four or more numbers, and Euclid avoided such products, although they are implied, e.g., in the proof of book IX, proposition 20.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Congruentie.svg</target><part>thumb</part><part>An example of congruence.

Alternatively, two figures are congruent if one can be moved on top of the other so that it matches up with it exactly. (Flipping it over is allowed.) Thus, for example, a 2x6 rectangle and a 3x4 rectangle are equal but not congruent, and the letter R is congruent to its mirror image.

A relatively weak gravitational field, such as the Earth's or the sun's, is represented by a metric that is approximately, but not exactly, Euclidean. Until the 20th century, there was no technology capable of detecting the deviations from Euclidean geometry, but Einstein predicted that such deviations would exist. They were later verified by observations such as the slight bending of starlight by the Sun during a solar eclipse in 1919, and such considerations are now an integral part of the software that runs the<space/><link><target>Global Positioning System</target><part>GPS</part></link><space/>system.<extension extension_name='ref'>Rizos, Chris.<space/><link><target>University of New South Wales</target></link>.<space/><link type='external' href='http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap3/312.htm'>GPS Satellite Signals</link>. 1999.</extension><space/>It is possible to object to this interpretation of general relativity on the grounds that light rays might be improper physical models of Euclid's lines, or that relativity could be rephrased so as to avoid the geometrical interpretations. However, one of the consequences of Einstein's theory is that there is no possible physical test that can distinguish between a beam of light as a model of a geometrical line and any other physical model. Thus, the only logical possibilities are to accept non-Euclidean geometry as physically real, or to reject the entire notion of physical tests of the axioms of geometry, which can then be imagined as a formal system without any intrinsic real-world meaning.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Treatment of infinity</heading><heading level='3'>Infinite objects</heading><paragraph>Euclid sometimes distinguished explicitly between &quot;finite lines&quot; (e.g., Postulate 2) and &quot;<link><target>infinity</target><part>infinite</part></link><space/>lines&quot; (book I, proposition 12).
