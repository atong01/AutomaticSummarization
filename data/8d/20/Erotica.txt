'''Erotica''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]]  ἔρως, ''[[eros (love)|eros]]'' "desire") is any artistic work that deals substantively with [[eroticism|erotically]] [[sexual stimulation|stimulating]] or [[sexual arousal|sexually arousing]] subject matter.  All forms of art may depict erotic content, including [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[photography]], [[drama]], [[erotic film|film]], [[music]] or [[erotic literature|literature]]. Erotica has [[high-art]] aspirations, differentiating it from commercial [[pornography]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Pornography|url=http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568395/Pornography.html|work=[[Encarta]]|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwbuJpkR|archivedate=October 31, 2009|deadurl=yes}}</ref>  Another category is [[amateur pornography]] which includes non-commercial works.

'''Curiosa''' is erotica and pornography as discrete,  [[collectible]] items, usually in published or printed form.

==Erotica and pornography==
Distinction is often made between erotica and [[pornography]] (as well as the lesser known genre of sexual entertainment, [[ribaldry]]), although some viewers may not distinguish between them. A key distinction, some have argued, is that pornography's objective is the graphic depiction of sexually explicit scenes, while erotica "seeks to tell a story that involves sexual themes" that include a more plausible depiction of human sexuality than in pornography.<ref name=MIT>[http://tech.mit.edu/V116/N65/erotica.65l.html "Erotica Is Not Pornography"]. William J. Gehrke. ''The Tech''. December 10, 1996.</ref>  Additionally, works considered degrading or exploitative tend to be classified by those who see them as such, as "porn" rather than as "erotica" and consequently, pornography is often described as exploitative or degrading.<ref name=MIT/><ref name=India>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/815524.cms "Don't confuse erotica with porn"].
