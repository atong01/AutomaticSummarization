Having fulfilled his promise, Warner published a book entitled<space/><italics>How We Recovered the Ashes</italics>. Although the origins of the term are not referred to in the text, the title served (along with the general hype created in Australia) to revive public interest in the legend.

England won two out of the three matches played against Murdoch's Australian Eleven, and after the third match some Melbourne ladies put some ashes into a small urn and gave them to me as captain of the English Eleven.</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>A more detailed account of how the Ashes were given to Ivo Bligh was outlined by his wife, the Countess of Darnley, in 1930 during a speech at a cricket luncheon. Her speech was reported by the London Times as follows:<extension extension_name='ref'>The Times (London), 27 June 1930. page 7.</extension></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>quote</target><arg>In 1882, she said, it was first spoken of when the Sporting Times, after the Australians had thoroughly beaten the English at the Oval, wrote an obituary in affectionate memory of English cricket "whose demise was deeply lamented and the body would be cremated and taken to Australia". Her husband, then Ivo Bligh, took a team to Australia in the following year. Punch had a poem containing the words "When Ivo comes back with the urn" and when Ivo Bligh wiped out the defeat Lady Clarke, wife of Sir W. J. Clarke, who entertained the English so lavishly, found a little wooden urn, burnt a bail, put the ashes in the urn, and wrapping it in a red velvet bag, put it into her husband's (Ivo Bligh's) hands. He had always regarded it as a great treasure.</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>There is another statement which is not totally clear made by Lord Darnley in 1921 about the timing of the presentation of the urn.

However, during the tour of Australia in 2006/7, the MCC official accompanying the urn said the veil legend had been discounted, and it was now &quot;95% certain&quot; that the urn contains the ashes of a cricket bail.

As its condition is fragile and it is a prized exhibit at the MCC Cricket Museum, the MCC would not agree. Furthermore, in 2002, Bligh's great-great-grandson Lord Clifton, the heir-apparent to the<space/><link><target>Earl of Darnley</target><part>Earldom of Darnley</part></link>, argued that the Ashes urn should not be returned to Australia because it belonged to his family and was given to the MCC only for safe keeping.</paragraph><paragraph>As a compromise, the MCC commissioned a trophy in the form of a larger replica of the urn in<space/><link><target>Waterford Crystal</target></link>, to award to the winning team of each series from 199899.

Publicity surrounding the series was intense, and it was at some time during this series that the Ashes urn was crafted. Australia won the First Test by<space/><link><target>Result (cricket)</target><part>nine wickets</part></link>, but in the next two England were victorious. At the end of the Third Test, England were generally considered to have &quot;won back the Ashes&quot; 21. A fourth match was played, against a &quot;United Australian XI&quot;, which was arguably stronger than the Australian sides that had competed in the previous three matches; this game, however, is not generally considered part of the 188283 series. It<space/><italics>is</italics><space/>counted as a Test, but as a standalone. This match ended in a victory for Australia</paragraph><heading level='3'>1884 to 1896</heading><paragraph>After Bligh's victory, there was an extended period of English dominance.

England lost only four Ashes Tests in the 1880s out of 23 played, and they won all the seven series contested.</paragraph><paragraph>There was more chopping and changing in the teams, given that there was no official board of selectors for each country (in 188788, two separate English teams were on tour in Australia) and popularity with the fans varied. The 1890s games were more closely fought, Australia taking their first series win since 1882 with a 21 victory in 189192.

WSC came after an era during which the duopoly of Australian and English dominance dissipated; the Ashes had long been seen as a cricket world championship but the rise of the West Indies in the late 1970s challenged that view.

Australia's second innings score was 1727 at the end of Day 4, characterised by batting order changes to achieve a fast run rate to allow enough time to bowl England out amid inclement weather forecasts. Australia declared overnight to post England a target of 332 to win. Contrary to expectations, play resumed with only a minor delay on Day 5, and with captain Alastair Cook being bowled out for 0 (his first duck in 26 innings as captain), Australia looked to be in with a significant chance of a win, keeping their series hopes alive. By lunch England were 373, but on resumption of play only 3 balls were bowled before rain stopped play. This rain persisted and, at 16:40, the captains shook hands and the match was declared a draw.
