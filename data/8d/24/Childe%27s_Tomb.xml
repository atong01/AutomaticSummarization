Childe became separated from the main party and was lost. In order to save himself from dying of exposure, he killed his horse, disembowelled it and crept inside the warm carcass for shelter.

The season then being so cold, and he so benumed therewith, as he was enforced to kill his horse, and embowelled him, to creep into his belly to get heat; which not able to preserve him, was there frozen to death; and so found, was carried by Tavistoke men to be buried in the church of that abbey; which was so secretly done but the inhabitants of Plymstoke had knowledge thereof; which to prevent, they resorted to defend the carriage of the corpse over the bridge, where, they conceived, necessity compelled them to pass. But they were deceived by guile; for the Tavistoke men forthwith built a slight bridge, and passed over at another place without resistance, buried the body, and enjoyed the lands; in memory whereof the bridge beareth the name of Guilebridge to this day.<ref name">R198>Risdon (1811) pp. 198â€“9</ref></arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Finberg pointed out, however, that a document of 1651 refers to Tavistock's guildhall as<space/><italics>Guilehall</italics>, so<space/><italics>Guilebridge</italics><space/>is more likely to be<space/><italics>guild bridge</italics>, probably because it was built or maintained by one of the town guilds.<extension extension_name='ref' name="F277">Finberg (1946) p. 277</extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>In popular culture</heading><paragraph><link><target>Devon</target></link><space/>folk singer<space/><link><target>Seth Lakeman</target></link><space/>sang about Childe the Hunter on his 2006 album<space/><italics><link><target>Freedom Fields</target></link></italics>.</paragraph><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>Reflist</target><arg>2</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>Sources</heading><paragraph><template><target>refbegin</target></template></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last">Crossing
