Travis Morgan &amp; Partners were commissioned by the London Docklands Study Team to consider the issue. They proposed, among other recommendations, that a &quot;minitram&quot; people-mover system capable of carrying up to 20 people in each unit should be constructed to connect the Docklands with the planned Fleet line tube railway terminus at<space/><link><target>Fenchurch Street railway station</target></link>. The<space/><link><target>Greater London Council</target></link><space/>formed a Docklands Joint Committee with the Boroughs of<space/><link><target>Greenwich</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Lewisham</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Newham</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Southwark</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Tower Hamlets</target></link><space/>in 1974 to undertake the redevelopment of the area. A light railway systems was envisaged, terminating either at<space/><link><target>Tower Hill tube station</target></link><space/>or at Fenchurch Street, but both options were seen as too expensive. Nonetheless, in 1976 another report proposed a conventional tube railway for the area and London Transport obtained Parliamentary powers to build a line from<space/><link><target>Charing Cross railway station</target></link><space/>to Fenchurch Street, Surrey Docks (now<space/><link><target>Surrey Quays railway station</target></link>), the<space/><link><target>Isle of Dogs</target></link>,<space/><link><target>North Greenwich, Isle of Dogs</target><part>North Greenwich</part></link><space/>and Custom House to<space/><link><target>Woolwich Arsenal station</target><part>Woolwich Arsenal</part></link>. This was intended to be the second stage of the Fleet line&amp;nbsp; which had been renamed the<space/><link><target>Jubilee line</target></link>, the first stage of which opened in 1979 from<space/><template><target>LUL stations</target><arg name="station">Stanmore</arg></template><space/>to<space/><template><target>LUL stations</target><arg name="station">Charing Cross</arg></template>. However, when the Conservative Party came to power in May 1979 under<space/><link><target>Margaret Thatcher</target></link>, the plans to extend the Jubilee line were halted and the new government insisted that a lower-cost option should be pursued.<extension extension_name='ref' name="DLRhandbook-p4-5"><template><target>Cite book</target><arg name="last1">Pearce<space/></arg><arg name="first1">Alan<space/></arg><arg name="last2">Hardy<space/></arg><arg name="first2">Brian<space/></arg><arg name="last3">Stannard<space/></arg><arg name="first3">Colin<space/></arg><arg name="title">Docklands Light Railway Official Handbook<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Capital Transport Publishing<space/></arg><arg name="page">4-5<space/></arg><arg name="location">Harrow Weald<space/></arg><arg name="date">November 2000<space/></arg><arg name="isbn">185414-223-2<space/></arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The government created the<space/><link><target>London Docklands Development Corporation</target></link><space/>(LDDC) in July 1981 to coordinate the redevelopment of the Docklands. The need to provide a cheap public transport solution led to it commissioning London Transport to evaluate a number of exclusively light rail options. The core of the route ran alongside the<space/><link><target>Great Eastern Main Line</target><part>Great Eastern line</part></link><space/>out of London and south along the former London &amp; Blackwall Railway line through the Isle of Dogs. Three terminus options were proposed at the west end, at Tower Hill, Minories and Aldgate East. The Tower Hill option would have required a low-level interchange to be constructed alongside the existing Underground station, but this would have been a very costly venture. The Minories option, a high-level station virtually on the site of the old<space/><link><target>Minories railway station</target></link>, was selected and became the current Tower Gateway DLR terminus.<extension extension_name='ref' name="DLRhandbook-p4-5"></extension><space/>Aldgate East would have been perhaps the most ambitious of all of the options, as it originally envisaged a low-level connection with the<space/><link><target>District line</target></link><space/>that would have allowed DLR trains to run on Underground tracks to a variety of central London destinations. However, it quickly became apparent that there was no capacity on the existing network for integrating the DLR into the Underground.<extension extension_name='ref' name="DLRhandbook-p6">Pearce, Hardy &amp; Stannard,<space/><italics>Docklands Light Railway Official Handbook</italics><space/>(2000), p. 6</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Two southern terminus options were put forward, at Cubitt Town (today's Island Gardens station) and Tiller Road, on the west side of Millwall Dock, with two possible routes to reach them. A &quot;western&quot; route would have run from the Westferry station alongside West Ferry Road via Cuba Street, then either terminating at Tiller Road or continuing over Millwall Docks Cut to a terminus at Cubitt Town. The &quot;central&quot; option required the West India Docks to be infilled or bridged and would run down the middle of the peninsula, through what was at the time an area of derelict warehouses.<extension extension_name='ref' name="DLRhandbook-p6"></extension><space/>Ultimately this latter option was chosen, though the 1981 London Transport report warned that without extensive development around Canary Wharf the area would be &quot;very isolated with poor traffic prospects&quot;&amp;nbsp; as indeed it was, for a number of years.<extension extension_name='ref' name="DLRhandbook-p7">Pearce, Hardy &amp; Stannard,<space/><italics>Docklands Light Railway Official Handbook</italics><space/>(2000), p. 7</extension></paragraph><paragraph>The contract for the initial system was awarded to<space/><link><target>General Electric Company plc</target><part>GEC</part></link><space/><link><target>Mowlem</target></link><space/>in 1984<extension extension_name='ref' name="20CentLondon"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url"><space/>http://www.20thcenturylondon.org.uk/server.php?show</arg><arg name="title">Docklands Light Railway (D.L.R.)<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Exploring 20th Century London<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">3 September 2009</arg></template></extension><space/>and the system was constructed from 1985 to 1987 at a cost of 77&amp;nbsp;million.<extension extension_name='ref' name="ModernRailways3"><link><target>Roger Ford</target><part>Ford, Roger</part></link>. &quot;Opening of the Docklands Light Railway&quot;.<space/><italics><link><target>Modern Railways</target></link></italics><space/>(London).
