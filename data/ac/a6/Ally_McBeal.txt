'''''Ally McBeal''''' is<!-- DO NOT change the tense please! Read WP:MOSTV#Lead_paragraphs--> an American [[legal drama|legal]] [[comedy-drama]] [[television series]], originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] from September 8, 1997 to May 20, 2002. Created by [[David E. Kelley]], the series stars [[Calista Flockhart]] in the [[Ally McBeal (character)|title role]] as a young lawyer working in the fictional [[Boston]] [[List of fictional law firms|law firm]] Cage and Fish, with other young lawyers whose lives and loves were eccentric, humorous and dramatic. The series placed #48 on ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'s}} 2007 "New TV Classics" list.<ref>{{cite web|title=The New Classics: TV|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20207339,00.html|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=February 5, 2012|date=June 18, 2007}}</ref>

==Overview==
The series, set in the fictional [[Boston]] [[List of fictional law firms|law firm]] Cage and Fish, begins with main character [[Ally McBeal (character)|Allison Marie "Ally" McBeal]] joining the firm (co-owned by her law school classmate Richard Fish, played by [[Greg Germann]]) after leaving her previous job due to sexual harassment. On her first day Ally is horrified to find that she will be working alongside her ex-boyfriend Billy Thomas ([[Gil Bellows]])&mdash;whom she has never gotten over&mdash;and to make things worse, Billy is now married to fellow lawyer Georgia ([[Courtney Thorne-Smith]]), who also later joins Cage and Fish. The triangle among the three forms the basis for the main plot for the show's first three seasons.

Although ostensibly a legal drama, the main focus of the series was the romantic and personal lives of the main characters, often using legal proceedings as [[plot device]]s to contrast or reinforce a character's drama. For example, bitter divorce litigation of a client might provide a backdrop for Ally's decision to break up with a boyfriend. Legal arguments were also frequently used to explore multiple sides of various social issues.

Cage & Fish (which becomes Cage/Fish & McBeal or Cage, Fish, & Associates towards the end of the series), the fictional law firm where most of the characters work, is depicted as a highly sexualized environment, symbolized by its unisex restroom. Lawyers and secretaries in the firm routinely date, flirt with, or have a romantic history with each other, and frequently run into former or potential romantic interests in the courtroom or on the street outside.

The series had many offbeat and frequently surreal running gags and themes, such as Ally's tendency to immediately fall over whenever she met somebody she found attractive, or Richard Fish's [[Wattle (anatomy)|wattle]] fetish and humorous mottos ("Fishisms" & "Bygones"), or John's gymnastic dismounts out of the office's unisex bathroom stalls, or the dancing twins (played by Eric & Steve Cohen) at the bar, that ran through the series. The show used vivid, dramatic [[fantasy]] sequences for Ally's and other characters' wishful thinking; particularly notable is the [[dancing baby]].

The series also featured regular visits to a local bar where singer [[Vonda Shepard]] regularly performed (though occasionally handing over the microphone to the characters). The series also took place in the same [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] as David E. Kelley's legal drama ''[[The Practice]]'' (which aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]), as the two shows crossed over with one another on occasion, a very rare occurrence for two shows that aired on different networks.

==Episodes==
{{Main|List of Ally McBeal episodes}}
In Australia, Ally McBeal was aired from the Seven Network from 1997 to 2002. In 2010, Ally McBeal was aired repeatedly with Network Ten.

===Crossovers with ''[[The Practice]]''===
{{Seealso|The Practice#Crossovers}}
Seymore Walsh, a stern judge often exasperated by the eccentricities of the Cage & Fish lawyers and played by actor Albert Hall, was also a recurring character on ''The Practice''.  In addition, Judge Jennifer 'Whipper' Cone appears on ''The Practice'' episode "Line of Duty" (S02E15), while Judge Roberta Kittelson, a recurring character on ''The Practice'', has a featured guest role in the ''Ally McBeal'' episode "Do you Wanna Dance?"

Most of the primary ''Practice'' cast members guest starred in the ''Ally McBeal'' episode "The Inmates" (S01E20), in a storyline that concluded with the ''Practice'' episode "Axe Murderer" (S02E26), featuring Calista Flockhart and Gil Bellows reprising their ''Ally'' characters; what's unique about this continuing storyline is that ''Ally McBeal'' and ''The Practice'' happened to air on different networks.  Bobby Donnell, the main character of ''The Practice'' played by [[Dylan McDermott]], was featured heavily in both this crossover and another ''Ally McBeal'' episode, "These are the Days."

Regular ''Practice'' cast members [[Lara Flynn Boyle]] and [[Michael Badalucco]] each had a cameo in ''Ally McBeal'' (Boyle as a woman who trades insults with Ally in the episode "Making Spirits Bright" and Badalucco as one of Ally's dates in the episode "I Know him by Heart") but it remains ambiguous whether they were playing the same characters they play on ''The Practice''.

==Reception==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2012}}
Upon premiering in 1997, the show was an instant hit, average around 11 million viewers per episode. The shows second season saw an increase in ratings and soon became a top 20 show, averaging around 13 million viewers per episode. The show's ratings began to decline in the third season, but stabilized in the fourth season after [[Robert Downey, Jr.]] joined the regular cast as Ally's boyfriend Larry Paul, and a fresher aesthetic was created by new art director Matthew DeCoste. However, Downey's character was written out after the end of the season due to the actor's troubles with drug addiction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spinoff.comicbookresources.com/2014/03/05/tv-legends-revealed-robert-downey-jr-was-written-out-of-own-tv-wedding/|title=TV Legends Revealed - Robert Downey Jr. Was Written Out of Own TV Wedding|date=March 5, 2014|publisher=Comic Book Resources|author=Brian Cronin}}</ref>

The first two seasons, as well as the fourth, remain the most critically acclaimed and saw the most awards success at the Emmys, SAG Awards and the Golden Globes.

Along with ''[[Dharma & Greg]]'', ''Ally McBeal'' was one of the last two surviving shows to debut during the [[1997–98 United States network television schedule|1997-98 season]], one of the weakest in United States television history for new shows. (Only seven shows to debut would be picked up for a second season, and only ''Dharma & Greg'' and ''Ally McBeal'' would last longer than three seasons, each providing enough episodes for [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]].) Both shows ended at the end of the [[2001–02 United States network television schedule|2001-02 season]], five years after their debut. Both shows were produced by [[20th Century Fox Television]].

==Feminist criticism==
Despite its success, ''Ally McBeal'' received some negative criticism from TV critics and feminists who found the title character annoying and demeaning to women (specifically professional women<ref>Michelle L. Hammers, "Cautionary Tales of Liberation and Female Professionalism: The Case ''Against Ally McBeal''" ''Western Journal of Communication'' '''69''' 2, April (2005): 168. "The ease with which ''McBeal''s depictions of women are reincorporated into dominant masculinist discourses ... is particularly problematic for professional women. The increased danger that co-optation poses for professional women is due to the complex ways in which the discursive sedimentation that surrounds the female body, particularly as it has been traditionally sexualized and linked to emotionality, operates as a barrier to women's full and effective participation in professional spheres. Thus, ''McBeal'' operates as a cautionary tale about the dangers presented by the co-optation of postfeminist and third-wave feminist discourses as they relate to current professional discourses surrounding the female body.</ref>) because of her perceived flightiness, lack of demonstrated legal knowledge, short skirts,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/community/transcripts/chattr062598.html|title=Is Feminism Dead? (Chat Transcript – Phyllis Chesler)|publisher=Time Magazine|date=June 29, 1998}}</ref> and emotional instability. Perhaps the most notorious example of the debate sparked by the show was the June 29, 1998 cover story of ''Time'' magazine, which juxtaposed McBeal with three pioneering feminists ([[Susan B. Anthony]], [[Betty Friedan]], [[Gloria Steinem]]) and asked "Is Feminism Dead?"<ref>http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19980629,00.html</ref> In episode 12 of the second season of the show, Ally talks to her co-worker John Cage about a dream she had, saying "You know, I had a dream that they put my face on the cover of ''Time'' magazine as 'the face of feminism'."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdHSOF6gVwo|title=Ally McBeal, episode 12, season 2|publisher=20th Century Fox|date=August 22, 2009}}</ref><ref>[[:File:Is Feminism Dead - Time cover.jpg]]</ref>

==Music==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2012}}

''Ally McBeal'' was a heavily music-oriented show. [[Vonda Shepard]], a virtually unknown musician at the time, was featured continually on the show. Her song "Searchin' My Soul" became the show's theme song. Many of the songs Shepard performed were established hits with lyrics that paralleled the events of the episode, including "[[Both Sides Now (song)|Both Sides Now]]", "[[Hooked on a Feeling]]" and "[[Tell Him (Bert Berns song)|Tell Him]]". Besides recording background music for the show, Shepard frequently appeared at the ends of episodes as a musician performing at a local [[piano bar]] frequented by the main characters. On rare occasions, her character would have conventional dialogue. A portion of "Searchin' My Soul" was played at the beginning of each episode, but remarkably the song was never played in its entirety.

Several of the characters had a musical [[leitmotif]] that played when they appeared. John Cage's was "My Everything", Ling Woo's was the Wicked Witch of the West theme from ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', and Ally McBeal herself picked "Tell Him", when told by a psychiatrist that she needed a theme.

Due to the popularity of the show and Shepard's music, a soundtrack titled ''[[Songs from Ally McBeal]]'' was released in 1998, as well as a successor soundtrack titled ''Heart and Soul: New Songs From Ally McBeal'' in 1999. Two compilation albums from the show featuring Shepard were also released in 2000 and 2001. A Christmas album was also released under the title ''Ally McBeal: A Very Ally Christmas''.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/The-Man-With-Bag/dp/B00138A8P0 ''Ally McBeal: A Very Ally Christmas'' (2000) Sony Music]</ref> The album received positive reviews, and Shephard’s version of [[Kay Starr]]’s Christmas song [[(Everybody's Waitin' For) The Man with the Bag]], received considerable airplay during the holiday season.<ref>Atkinson, Terry (December 3, 2000) "''TV Shows Breed Christmas Albums''" The Post-Tribune (Gary, Indiana) (Entertainment News Service), page D-5.[http://0-search.proquest.com.libsys.arlingtonva.us/newsstand/docview/343646798/13B3F42545B27DF2559/7?accountid=46215]</ref>

Other artists featured on the show include [[Barry White]], [[Al Green]], [[Tina Turner]], [[Anastacia]], [[Elton John]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and [[Mariah Carey]].  [[Josh Groban]] played the role of Malcolm Wyatt in the May 2001 season finale, performing "You're Still You". The series creator, David E. Kelley, was impressed with Groban's performance at The Family Celebration event and based on the audience reaction to Groban's singing, Kelley created a character for him in that finale. The background score for the show was composed by [[Danny Lux]].

==DVD releases==

==''Ally'' (1999)==
In 1999, at the height of the show's popularity, a half-hour version entitled ''Ally''<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0210403/ "Ally" (1999) at IMDB]</ref> began airing in parallel with the main program. This version, designed in a sitcom format, used re-edited scenes from the main program, along with previously unseen footage. The intention was to further develop the plots in the comedy-drama in a sitcom style. It also focused only on Ally's personal life, cutting all the courtroom plots. The repackaged show was cancelled partway through its initial run. While 13 episodes of ''Ally'' were created, only 10 were actually broadcast.

==In popular culture==

McBeal and 1990s [[yuppie|young affluent professional]] women were parodied in the song ''Ally McBeal'' (tune of "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]" by [[Bob Dylan]]) by a cappella group [[Da Vinci's Notebook]] on their album ''The Life and Times of Mike Fanning'', released in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ally McBeal|url=http://www.elyrics.net/read/d/da-vinci_s-notebook-lyrics/ally-mcbeal-lyrics.html|publisher=elyrics.net|accessdate=April 8, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Rogovoy|first=Seth|title=Da Vinci's Notebook fills doctor's prescription|url=http://rogovoy.com/archive/378.shtml|date=February 18, 2003|publisher=Berkshire Eagle|accessdate=April 8, 2013}}</ref>

In episode 2, season 3 of the British comedy ''[[The Adam and Joe Show]]'', the show was parodied as 'Ally McSqeal' using soft toys.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLjdlq21c5M&feature=sh_e_se&list=SL The Adam and Joe Show]. YouTube. Retrieved on 2012-04-23.</ref>

A season 2 episode of ''[[Futurama]]'', "[[When Aliens Attack]]", featured a parody of the show entitled ''Single Female Lawyer''. The principal crux of the parody was that, effectively, ''Single Female Lawyer'' had no discernible plot other than the fact that the female lead was very attractive, wore a short skirt, and slept with her clients. The show has been broadcast into space for centuries, but the last episode was missing (due to Philip Fry's incompetence and time travel) and so a warlike alien race, who had become hooked on the show, demanded that Earth either play out the final episode for them or they would ignite the planet's atmosphere. Luckily, due to the nature of the show being little more than [[fan service]], it was easy for Fry, Leela and the others to replicate it by simply putting Leela in a miniskirt and ad libbing the dialogue on the spot.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
