Firstly, Radio 1. They outlawed the pirates and then didn't, as they promised, cater for the market the pirates created. Radio 1 and 2, most afternoons, run concurrently and the whole thing has slid right back to where it was before the pirates happened. They've totally fucked it. There's no radio station for young people any more. It's all down to housewives and trendies in Islington. They're killing the country by having that play list monopoly.

</arg></template>Initially, the station was unpopular with some of its target audience who, it is claimed, disliked the fact that much of its airtime was shared with<space/><link><target>BBC Radio 2</target><part>Radio 2</part></link><space/>and that it was less unequivocally aimed at a young audience than the offshore stations, with some DJs such as<space/><link><target>Jimmy Young (disc jockey)</target><part>Jimmy Young</part></link><space/>being in their 40s. The very fact that it was part of an &quot;establishment&quot; institution such as the<space/><link><target>BBC</target></link><space/>was a turn-off for some, and<space/><link><target>needle time</target></link><space/>restrictions prevented it from playing as many records as offshore stations had. It also had limited finances (partially because the BBC did not increase its licence fee to fund the new station) and often, as in January 1975, suffered disproportionately when the BBC had to make financial cutbacks, strengthening an impression that it was regarded as a lower priority by senior BBC executives.</paragraph><paragraph>Despite this, it gained massive audiences, becoming the most listened to station in the world with audiences of over 10 million claimed for some of its shows (up to 20 million for some of the combined Radio 1 and Radio 2 shows). In the early-mid-1970s Radio 1 presenters were rarely out of the British tabloids, thanks to the Publicity Department's high profile work. The popularity of Radio 1's touring summer live broadcasts the<space/><link><target>Radio 1 Roadshow</target></link><space/>- usually as part of the BBC 'Radio Weeks' promotions that took Radio 1, 2 and 4 shows on the road - drew some of the largest crowds of the decade. The station undoubtedly played a role in maintaining the high sales of 45 rpm single records although it benefited from a lack of competition, apart from<space/><link><target>Radio Luxembourg (English)</target><part>Radio Luxembourg</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Manx Radio</target></link><space/>in the Isle of Man. (<link><target>Independent Local Radio</target></link><space/>did not begin until October 1973 and took many years to cover virtually all of the UK).<space/><link><target>Alan Freeman</target></link>'s 'Saturday Rock Show' was voted 'Best Radio Show' 5 years running by readers of a national music publication, and was then axed by controller Derek Chinnery.</paragraph><heading level='3'>1990s changes</heading><paragraph>In his last few months as controller, Johnny Beerling commissioned a handful of new shows that in some ways set the tone for what was to come under<space/><link><target>Matthew Bannister</target></link>. One of these &quot;<link><target>Loud'n'proud</target></link>&quot; was the UK's first national radio series aimed at a gay audience (made in<space/><link><target>Manchester</target></link><space/>and was aired from August 1993). Far from being a parting quirk, the show was a surprise hit and led to the network's first coverage of the large outdoor<space/><link><target>Gay Pride</target></link><space/>event in 1994. Bannister took the reins fully in October 1993. His aim was to rid the station of its '<link><target>Smashie and Nicey</target></link>' image and make it appeal to the under 25s. Although originally launched as a youth station, by the early 1990s, its loyal listeners (and DJs) had aged with the station over its 25-year history. Many long-standing DJs, such as<space/><link><target>Simon Bates</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Dave Lee Travis</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Alan Freeman</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Bob Harris (radio)</target><part>Bob Harris</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Gary Davies</target></link>, and later<space/><link><target>Steve Wright (DJ)</target><part>Steve Wright</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Bruno Brookes</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Johnnie Walker (DJ)</target><part>Johnnie Walker</part></link><space/>left the station or were sacked, and in January 1995 old music (typically anything recorded before 1990) was banned from the daytime<space/><link><target>playlist</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Many listeners rebelled as the first new DJs to be introduced represented a crossover from other parts of the BBC (notably Bannister and Trevor Dann's former colleagues at the BBC's London station,<space/><link><target>BBC GLR</target><part>GLR</part></link>) with<space/><link><target>Emma Freud</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Danny Baker</target></link>. Another problem was that, at the time,<space/><link><target>BBC Radio 2</target><part>Radio 2</part></link><space/>was sticking resolutely to a format which appealed mainly to those who had been listening since the days of the<space/><link><target>BBC Light Programme</target><part>Light Programme</part></link>, and commercial radio, which was targeting the &quot;Radio 1 and a half&quot; audience, consequently enjoyed a massive increase in its audience share at the expense of Radio 1.</paragraph><paragraph>After the departure of<space/><link><target>Steve Wright (DJ)</target><part>Steve Wright</part></link>, who had been unsuccessfully moved from his long-running afternoon show to the breakfast show in January 1994, Bannister hired<space/><link><target>Chris Evans (presenter)</target><part>Chris Evans</part></link><space/>to present the prime morning slot in April 1995. Evans was a popular but controversial presenter who was eventually sacked in 1997 after he demanded to present the breakfast show for only four days per week. Evans was replaced from 17 February 1997 by<space/><link><target>Mark and Lard</target></link><space/><link><target>Mark Radcliffe</target></link><space/>(along with his sidekick<space/><link><target>Marc Riley</target></link>), who found the slick, mass-audience style required for a breakfast show did not come naturally to them. They were replaced by<space/><link><target>Zo Ball</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Kevin Greening</target></link><space/>eight months later in October 1997, with Greening moving on and leaving Ball as solo presenter. The reinvention of the station happened at a fortuitous time, with the rise of<space/><link><target>Britpop</target></link><space/>in the mid-90s bands like<space/><link><target>Oasis (band)</target><part>Oasis</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Blur (band)</target><part>Blur</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Pulp (band)</target><part>Pulp</part></link><space/>were popular and credible at the time and the station's popularity rose with them. Documentaries like John Peel's &quot;Lost in Music&quot; which looked at the influence that the use of<space/><link><target>drugs</target></link><space/>have had over popular musicians received critical acclaim but were slated inside<space/><link><target>Broadcasting House</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Later in the 1990s the Britpop boom declined, and manufactured chart pop (<link><target>boy bands</target></link><space/>and acts aimed at sub-teenagers) came to dominate the charts. New-genre music occupied the evenings (indie on weekdays and dance at weekends), with a mix of specialist shows and playlist fillers through late nights. The rise of<space/><link><target>rave</target></link><space/>culture through the late 1980s and early 1990s gave the station the opportunity to move into a controversial and youth-orientated movement by bringing in club DJ<space/><link><target>Pete Tong</target></link><space/>amongst others. There had been a dance music programme on Radio 1 since 1987 and Pete Tong was the second DJ to present an all dance music show. This quickly gave birth to the<space/><link><target>Essential Mix</target></link><space/>where underground DJs mix electronic and club based music in a two-hour slot. Dance music has been a permanent feature on Radio 1 since with club DJs such as<space/><link><target>Judge Jules</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Danny Rampling</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Seb Fontaine</target></link><space/>all having shows as well as Radio 1 hosting an annual weekend in<space/><link><target>Ibiza</target></link>.</paragraph><heading level='3'>2000s</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Lamacq whiley lowe.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>Steve Lamacq, Jo Whiley and Zane Lowe</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>Listening numbers continued to decline but the station succeeded in targeting a younger age-group and more cross gender groups. Eventually, this change in content was reflected by a rise in audience that is continuing to this day. Notably, the station has received praise for shows such as<space/><link><target>The Surgery with Aled</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Bobby Friction</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>DJ Nihal</target><part>Nihal</part></link>,<space/><italics>The Evening Session</italics><space/>with<space/><link><target>Steve Lamacq</target></link><space/>and its successor<space/><link><target>Zane Lowe</target></link>. Its website has also been well received.However, the breakfast show and the<space/><link><target>UK Top 40</target></link><space/>continued to struggle. In 2000, Zo Ball was replaced in the mornings by friend and fellow<space/><link><target>ladette</target></link><space/><link><target>Sara Cox</target></link>, but, despite heavy promotion, listening figures for the breakfast show continued to fall. In 2004 Cox was replaced by<space/><link><target>Chris Moyles</target></link>. The newly rebranded breakfast show was known as<space/><link><target>The Chris Moyles Show</target></link><space/>and it increased its audience, ahead of<space/><link><target>Today programme</target><part>The Today Programme</part></link><space/>on<space/><link><target>BBC Radio 4</target><part>Radio 4</part></link><space/>as the second most popular breakfast show (after<space/><link><target>The Chris Evans Breakfast Show</target></link><space/>hosted by<space/><link><target>Chris Evans (presenter)</target><part>Chris Evans</part></link>). Moyles continued to use innovative ways to try to tempt listeners from the 'Wake up with Wogan' show; in 2006, for example, creating a 'SAY NO TO WOGAN' campaign live on-air. This angered the BBC hierarchy, though the row simmered down when it was clear that the 'campaign' had totally failed to alter the listening trends of the time Wogan still increased figures at a faster rate than Moyles.The chart show's ratings fell after the departure of long-time host<space/><link><target>Mark Goodier</target></link>, amid falling single sales in the UK. Ratings for the show fell in 2002 whilst Goodier was still presenting the show, meaning that commercial radio's<space/><link><target>Pepsi Chart (UK)</target><part>Network Chart</part></link><space/>overtook it in the ratings for the first time. However, the BBC denied he was being sacked. The BBC show now competes with networked commercial radio's<space/><link><target>The Big Top 40 Show</target></link><space/>which is broadcast at the same time.</paragraph><paragraph>Many DJs either ousted by Bannister or who left during his tenure (such as<space/><link><target>Johnnie Walker (DJ)</target><part>Johnnie Walker</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Bob Harris (radio)</target><part>Bob Harris</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Steve Wright (DJ)</target><part>Steve Wright</part></link>) have joined<space/><link><target>BBC Radio 2</target><part>Radio 2</part></link><space/>which has now overtaken Radio 1 as the UK's most popular radio station, using a style that Radio 1 had until the early 1990s.The success of Moyles' show has come alongside increased success for the station in general. In 2006, DJs Chris Moyles,<space/><link><target>Scott Mills</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Zane Lowe</target></link><space/>all won gold<space/><link><target>Radio Academy Awards</target><part>Sony Radio Awards</part></link>, while the station itself came away with the best station award.A new evening schedule was introduced in September 2006, dividing the week by genre. Monday was mainly pop-funkrock-oriented, Tuesday was R&amp;B and hip-hop, Thursdays and Fridays were primarily dance, with specialist R&amp;B and reggae shows.Following the death of<space/><link><target>John Peel</target></link><space/>in October 2004,<space/><link><target>Annie Nightingale</target></link><space/>is now the longest serving presenter, having worked there since 1970.</paragraph><heading level='3'>2010s</heading><paragraph>The licence-fee funding of Radio 1, alongside Radio 2, is often criticised by the commercial sector.

These cons were configured to allow DJs to operate the equipment themselves and play their own records and jingle cartridges (called self-op). This was a departure from traditional BBC practice, where a studio manager would play in discs from the studio control cubicle. Due to needle time restrictions, much of the music was played from tapes of BBC session recordings. The DJs were assisted by one or more technical operators (TOs) who would set up tapes and control sound levels during broadcasts.</preline></preblock><paragraph>In 1985, Radio 1 moved across the road from<space/><link><target>Broadcasting House</target></link><space/>to<space/><link><target>Egton House</target></link>.
