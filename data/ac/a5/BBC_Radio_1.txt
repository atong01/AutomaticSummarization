'''BBC Radio 1''' is a British [[radio broadcasting|radio station]] operated by the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] which also broadcasts internationally, specialising in modern and current [[popular music]] and chart hits throughout the day. Radio 1 provides alternative genres after 7:00 pm, including electronic dance, hip hop, rock, indie or interviews. It is aimed primarily at the 15–29 age group,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/regulatory_framework/service_licences/radio/radio_servicelicences/radio1_servicelicence_30apr2007.pdf|format=PDF|title=Radio 1 Service Licence (Issued 30&nbsp;April 2007)|publisher=[[BBC Trust]]|date=30 April 2007|accessdate=2 February 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080227084103/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/regulatory_framework/service_licences/radio/radio_servicelicences/radio1_servicelicence_30apr2007.pdf| archivedate= 27 February 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref> although the average age of the UK audience in 2008 was 33.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/oct/24/commercialradio-bbc | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=John | last=Plunkett | title=Radio 1 slipping out of its age remit, warns commercial radio body | date=24 October 2008}}</ref>

It is the only national radio station that has more variety on its music playlists than [[The Hits Radio]] and [[Capital FM]] and showcases a mix of music in the daytime.

== History ==

=== First broadcast ===
Radio 1 was established in 1967 (along with its somewhat more adult-oriented counterpart, [[BBC Radio 2]]) as a successor to the [[BBC Light Programme]], which had broadcast popular music and other entertainment since 1945. Radio 1 was conceived as a direct response to the popularity of offshore [[Pirate radio in the United Kingdom|pirate radio]] stations such as [[Radio Caroline]] and [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]], which had been outlawed by Act of Parliament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/radio1/index.html |title=The Unofficial History of BBC Radio 1 & 2 |publisher=Radio Rewind |date= |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> Radio 1 was launched at 7:00 am on Saturday 30 September 1967.

The first disc jockey to broadcast on the new station was [[Tony Blackburn]], whose cheery style, first heard on [[Radio Caroline]] and [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]], won him the prime slot on what became known as the "Radio 1 Breakfast Show". The first words on Radio 1 – after a countdown by the Controller of Radios 1 and 2, Robin Scott, and a jingle, recorded at [[PAMS]] in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], beginning "The voice of Radio 1" – were "... And, good morning everyone. Welcome to the exciting new sound of Radio 1". This was the first use of US-style jingles on BBC radio, but the style was familiar to listeners who were acquainted with Blackburn and other DJs from their days on pirate radio. The first complete record played on Radio 1 was "[[Flowers in the Rain]]" by [[The Move]]. The second single was "[[Massachusetts (Bee Gees song)|Massachusetts]]" by [[Bee Gees|The Bee Gees]]. The breakfast show remains the most prized slot in the Radio 1 schedule, with every change of breakfast show presenter exciting considerable media interest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/radio1/radio_1_launch_day.htm |title=History - Launch day 1967 |publisher=Radio Rewind |date=30 September 1967 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref>
The initial rota of staff included [[John Peel]] and a gaggle of others, some hired from pirates, such as [[Keith Skues]], [[Ed Stewart]], [[Mike Raven]], David Ryder, Jim Fisher, [[Jimmy Young (disc jockey)|Jimmy Young]], [[Dave Cash (disc jockey)|Dave Cash]], [[Kenny Everett]], [[Simon Dee]], [[Terry Wogan]], Duncan Johnson, Doug Crawford, [[Tommy Vance]], [[Chris Denning]], [[Emperor Rosko]], [[Pete Murray (DJ)|Pete Murray]], and [[Bob Holness]]. Many of the most popular pirate radio voices, such as Simon Dee, had only a one-hour slot per week, ("Midday Spin.")<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/radio1/original_presenter_list.htm |title=BBC Radio 1 History - Original Presenters |publisher=Radio Rewind |date=4 September 1967 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> [[Annie Nightingale]], who joined in 1970, was Britain's first female DJ and is now the longest serving presenter, having constantly evolved her musical tastes with the times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/radio1/annie_nightingale_page.htm |title=BBC Radio 1 People - Annie Nightingale - Hi |publisher=Radio Rewind |date= |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref>

=== 1970s peak ===

Initially, the station was unpopular with some of its target audience who, it is claimed, disliked the fact that much of its airtime was shared with [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] and that it was less unequivocally aimed at a young audience than the offshore stations, with some DJs such as [[Jimmy Young (disc jockey)|Jimmy Young]] being in their 40s. The very fact that it was part of an "establishment" institution such as the [[BBC]] was a turn-off for some, and [[needle time]] restrictions prevented it from playing as many records as offshore stations had. It also had limited finances (partially because the BBC did not increase its licence fee to fund the new station) and often, as in January 1975, suffered disproportionately when the BBC had to make financial cutbacks, strengthening an impression that it was regarded as a lower priority by senior BBC executives.

Despite this, it gained massive audiences, becoming the most listened to station in the world with audiences of over 10 million claimed for some of its shows (up to 20 million for some of the combined Radio 1 and Radio 2 shows). In the early-mid-1970s Radio 1 presenters were rarely out of the British tabloids, thanks to the Publicity Department's high profile work. The popularity of Radio 1's touring summer live broadcasts the [[Radio 1 Roadshow]] - usually as part of the BBC 'Radio Weeks' promotions that took Radio 1, 2 and 4 shows on the road - drew some of the largest crowds of the decade. The station undoubtedly played a role in maintaining the high sales of 45 rpm single records although it benefited from a lack of competition, apart from [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] and [[Manx Radio]] in the Isle of Man. ([[Independent Local Radio]] did not begin until October 1973 and took many years to cover virtually all of the UK). [[Alan Freeman]]'s 'Saturday Rock Show' was voted 'Best Radio Show' 5 years running by readers of a national music publication, and was then axed by controller Derek Chinnery.

=== 1990s changes ===
In his last few months as controller, Johnny Beerling commissioned a handful of new shows that in some ways set the tone for what was to come under [[Matthew Bannister]]. One of these "[[Loud'n'proud]]" was the UK's first national radio series aimed at a gay audience (made in [[Manchester]] and was aired from August 1993). Far from being a parting quirk, the show was a surprise hit and led to the network's first coverage of the large outdoor [[Gay Pride]] event in 1994. Bannister took the reins fully in October 1993. His aim was to rid the station of its '[[Smashie and Nicey]]' image and make it appeal to the under 25s. Although originally launched as a youth station, by the early 1990s, its loyal listeners (and DJs) had aged with the station over its 25-year history. Many long-standing DJs, such as [[Simon Bates]], [[Dave Lee Travis]], [[Alan Freeman]], [[Bob Harris (radio)|Bob Harris]], [[Gary Davies]], and later [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]], [[Bruno Brookes]] and [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)|Johnnie Walker]] left the station or were sacked, and in January 1995 old music (typically anything recorded before 1990) was banned from the daytime [[playlist]].

Many listeners rebelled as the first new DJs to be introduced represented a crossover from other parts of the BBC (notably Bannister and Trevor Dann's former colleagues at the BBC's London station, [[BBC GLR|GLR]]) with [[Emma Freud]] and [[Danny Baker]]. Another problem was that, at the time, [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] was sticking resolutely to a format which appealed mainly to those who had been listening since the days of the [[BBC Light Programme|Light Programme]], and commercial radio, which was targeting the "Radio 1 and a half" audience, consequently enjoyed a massive increase in its audience share at the expense of Radio 1.

After the departure of [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]], who had been unsuccessfully moved from his long-running afternoon show to the breakfast show in January 1994, Bannister hired [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]] to present the prime morning slot in April 1995. Evans was a popular but controversial presenter who was eventually sacked in 1997 after he demanded to present the breakfast show for only four days per week. Evans was replaced from 17 February 1997 by [[Mark and Lard]] – [[Mark Radcliffe]] (along with his sidekick [[Marc Riley]]), who found the slick, mass-audience style required for a breakfast show did not come naturally to them. They were replaced by [[Zoë Ball]] and [[Kevin Greening]] eight months later in October 1997, with Greening moving on and leaving Ball as solo presenter. The reinvention of the station happened at a fortuitous time, with the rise of [[Britpop]] in the mid-90s – bands like [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Blur (band)|Blur]] and [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]] were popular and credible at the time and the station's popularity rose with them. Documentaries like John Peel's "Lost in Music" which looked at the influence that the use of [[drugs]] have had over popular musicians received critical acclaim but were slated inside [[Broadcasting House]].

Later in the 1990s the Britpop boom declined, and manufactured chart pop ([[boy bands]] and acts aimed at sub-teenagers) came to dominate the charts. New-genre music occupied the evenings (indie on weekdays and dance at weekends), with a mix of specialist shows and playlist fillers through late nights. The rise of [[rave]] culture through the late 1980s and early 1990s gave the station the opportunity to move into a controversial and youth-orientated movement by bringing in club DJ [[Pete Tong]] amongst others. There had been a dance music programme on Radio 1 since 1987 and Pete Tong was the second DJ to present an all dance music show. This quickly gave birth to the [[Essential Mix]] where underground DJs mix electronic and club based music in a two-hour slot. Dance music has been a permanent feature on Radio 1 since with club DJs such as [[Judge Jules]], [[Danny Rampling]] and [[Seb Fontaine]] all having shows as well as Radio 1 hosting an annual weekend in [[Ibiza]].

=== 2000s ===
[[File:Lamacq whiley lowe.jpg|thumb|right|Steve Lamacq, Jo Whiley and Zane Lowe]]

Listening numbers continued to decline but the station succeeded in targeting a younger age-group and more cross gender groups. Eventually, this change in content was reflected by a rise in audience that is continuing to this day. Notably, the station has received praise for shows such as [[The Surgery with Aled]], [[Bobby Friction]] and [[DJ Nihal|Nihal]], ''The Evening Session'' with [[Steve Lamacq]] and its successor [[Zane Lowe]]. Its website has also been well received.
However, the breakfast show and the [[UK Top 40]] continued to struggle. In 2000, Zoë Ball was replaced in the mornings by friend and fellow [[ladette]] [[Sara Cox]], but, despite heavy promotion, listening figures for the breakfast show continued to fall. In 2004 Cox was replaced by [[Chris Moyles]]. The newly rebranded breakfast show was known as [[The Chris Moyles Show]] and it increased its audience, ahead of [[Today programme|The Today Programme]] on [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] as the second most popular breakfast show (after [[The Chris Evans Breakfast Show]] hosted by [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]]). Moyles continued to use innovative ways to try to tempt listeners from the 'Wake up with Wogan' show; in 2006, for example, creating a 'SAY NO TO WOGAN' campaign live on-air. This angered the BBC hierarchy, though the row simmered down when it was clear that the 'campaign' had totally failed to alter the listening trends of the time – Wogan still increased figures at a faster rate than Moyles.
The chart show's ratings fell after the departure of long-time host [[Mark Goodier]], amid falling single sales in the UK. Ratings for the show fell in 2002 whilst Goodier was still presenting the show, meaning that commercial radio's [[Pepsi Chart (UK)|Network Chart]] overtook it in the ratings for the first time. However, the BBC denied he was being sacked. The BBC show now competes with networked commercial radio's [[The Big Top 40 Show]] which is broadcast at the same time.

Many DJs either ousted by Bannister or who left during his tenure (such as [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)|Johnnie Walker]], [[Bob Harris (radio)|Bob Harris]] and [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]]) have joined [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] which has now overtaken Radio 1 as the UK's most popular radio station, using a style that Radio 1 had until the early 1990s.
The success of Moyles' show has come alongside increased success for the station in general. In 2006, DJs Chris Moyles, [[Scott Mills]] and [[Zane Lowe]] all won gold [[Radio Academy Awards|Sony Radio Awards]], while the station itself came away with the best station award.
A new evening schedule was introduced in September 2006, dividing the week by genre. Monday was mainly pop-funkrock-oriented, Tuesday was R&B and hip-hop, Thursdays and Fridays were primarily dance, with specialist R&B and reggae shows.
Following the death of [[John Peel]] in October 2004, [[Annie Nightingale]] is now the longest serving presenter, having worked there since 1970.

=== 2010s ===
The licence-fee funding of Radio 1, alongside Radio 2, is often criticised by the commercial sector. In the first quarter of 2011 Radio 1 was part of an efficiency review conducted by [[John Myers (radio executive)|John Myers]].<ref name="tel-nov2010">{{cite news |first=Amanda |last=Andrews |date=28 November 2010 |title=BBC enlists commercial sector help to shake up radio |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/8164936/BBC-enlists-commercial-sector-help-to-shake-up-radio.html |work=The Telegraph |accessdate=12 March 2011 |location=London}}</ref> His role, according to Andrew Harrison, the chief executive of RadioCentre, was "to identify both areas of best practice and possible savings."<ref name="tel-nov2010"/>

The controller of Radio 1 and sister station 1Xtra changed to Ben Cooper on 28 October 2011, following the departure of Andy Parfitt. Ben Cooper answers to the Director of BBC Audio and Music, Tim Davie.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ben Cooper is appointed BBC Radio 1's new controller|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/15494493|accessdate=31 October 2011|newspaper=BBC News - Newsbeat|date=28 October 2011}}</ref>

On 7 December 2011, Ben Cooper's first major changes to the station were announced. Skream & Benga, Toddla T, Charlie Sloth and Friction replaced Judge Jules, Gilles Peterson, Kissy Sell Out and Fabio & Grooverider. A number of shows were shuffled to incorporate the new line up.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/071211radio1.html |title=Radio 1 announces changes to dance music line-up - Media centre |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> On 28 February 2012, further changes were announced. Greg James and Scott Mills swapped shows and [[Jameela Jamil]], [[Gemma Cairney]] and [[Danny Howard]] joined the station. The new line up of DJs for ''In New DJs We Trust'' was also announced with [[B.Traits]], Mosca, [[Jordan Suckley]] and Julio Bashmore hosting shows on a four weekly rotation.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2012/new-radio1.html |title=Greg James, Gemma Cairney and Jameela Jamil land new shows on Radio 1 - Media centre |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> This new schedule took effect on Monday, 2 April 2012.

In September 2012, Nick Grimshaw replaced Chris Moyles as host of "Radio 1's Breakfast Show". Grimshaw previously hosted Mon-Thurs 10pm-Midnight, Weekend Breakfast and Sunday evenings alongside Annie Mac. Grimshaw was replaced by Phil Taggart and Alice Levine on the 10pm-Midnight show.

In November 2012, another series of changes were announced. This included the departure of Reggie Yates and Vernon Kay. Jameela Jamil was announced as the new presenter of ''The Official Chart''. Matt Edmondson will host a weekend morning show and Tom Deacon will return to present a Wednesday night show. [[Dan Howell]] and [[Phil Lester]], famous [[YouTubers]] also joined the station. The changes took effect in January 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cairns |first=Dan |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/20267639 |title=BBC News - Vernon Kay and Reggie Yates to leave Radio 1 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=9 November 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref>

Former breakfast presenter Sara Cox hosted her last show on Radio 1 in February 2014 before moving to Radio 2. In March 2014, Gemma Cairney left the weekend breakfast show to host the weekday early breakfast slot, swapping shows with Dev.

In September 2014, Radio 1 operated a series of changes to their output which saw many notable presenters leave the station - including Edith Bowman, Nihal and Rob da Bank. Huw Stephens gained a new show hosting 10pm-1am Mon-Wed with Alice Levine presenting weekends 1pm-4pm. Radio 1's Residency also expanded with Skream joining the rotational line-up on Thursday nights 10pm-1am.

=== Studios ===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Radio One Studio.png|thumb|alt=Scott Mills Recording his show in the BBC Radio 1 Studios.|right|Scott Mills presenting his show at Radio 1 HQ.]] -->
From inception for over 20 years, Radio 1 broadcast from an adjacent pair of continuity suites (originally Con A and Con B) in the main control room of Broadcasting House. These cons were configured to allow DJs to operate the equipment themselves and play their own records and jingle cartridges (called self-op). This was a departure from traditional BBC practice, where a studio manager would play in discs from the studio control cubicle. Due to needle time restrictions, much of the music was played from tapes of BBC session recordings. The DJs were assisted by one or more technical operators (TOs) who would set up tapes and control sound levels during broadcasts.

In 1985, Radio 1 moved across the road from [[Broadcasting House]] to [[Egton House]]. The station moved to [[Yalding House]] in 1996, and Egton House was demolished in 2003 to make way for extension to Broadcasting House. This extension would eventually be renamed the Egton Wing, and then the Peel Wing.

Until recently, the studios were located in the basement of Yalding House (near to BBC Broadcasting House) which is on [[Great Portland Street]] in [[central London]]. They used to broadcast from two main studios in the basement; Y2 and Y3 (there is also a smaller studio, YP1, used mainly for production). These two main studios (Y2 and Y3) are separated by the "[[Live Lounge]]", although it is mainly used as an office; there are rarely live sets recorded from it, as [[Maida Vale Studios]] is used instead for larger set-ups. The studios are linked by webcams and windows through the "Live Lounge", allowing DJs to see each other when changing between shows. Y2 is the studio from where ''[[The Chris Moyles Show]]'' was broadcast and is also the studio rigged with static cameras for when the station broadcasts on the "Live Cam". The station moved there in 1996 from Egton House.

In December 2012 Radio 1 moved from Yalding House to new studios on the 8th floor of the new [[Broadcasting House|BBC Broadcasting House]], Portland Place, just a few metres away from the "Peel Wing", formerly the "Egton Wing", which occupies the land on which Egton House previously stood: it was renamed the "Peel Wing" in 2012 in honour of the long-serving BBC Radio 1 presenter, [[John Peel]], who broadcast on the station from its launch in 1967 up until his death in 2004.

Programmes have also regularly been broadcast from other regions, notably ''The Mark and Lard Show'', broadcast every weekday from [[New Broadcasting House (Manchester)|New Broadcasting House]], Oxford Road, [[Manchester]] for over a decade (October 1993–March 2004) — the longest regular broadcast on the network from outside the capital.

=== UK analogue frequencies ===
Radio 1 initially broadcast on 1214&nbsp;kHz [[medium wave]] (or 247 metres as it was referred to at the time) and moved to 1053/1089&nbsp;kHz (275/285 m) on 23 November 1978, but did not broadcast nationally on FM until 1988. The BBC was allocated three FM frequency ranges in 1955, for the then [[BBC Light Programme|Light Programme]] (now [[BBC Radio 2]]), [[BBC Third Programme|Third Programme]] (now [[BBC Radio 3]]) and [[BBC Home Service|Home Service]] (now [[BBC Radio 4]]) stations. This meant when Radio 1 was launched, there was no FM frequency range allocated for the station, the official reason being that there was no space even though no commercial stations had yet launched on FM. Because of this, from launch until the end of the 1980s Radio 1 was allowed to take over [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2's]] FM transmitters for a few hours per week – Saturday afternoons, Sunday teatime and evening – most notably for the Top 40 Singles Chart on Sunday afternoons – 10:00 pm to midnight on weeknights including [[Sounds of the Seventies]] until 1975, and thereafter the [[John Peel]] show (not forgetting the Friday Rock Show with the late Tommy Vance) and most Bank Holiday afternoons when Radio 2 was broadcasting a bank holiday edition of [[Sport on 2]].

In 1988 the 97–99&nbsp;MHz frequencies became available when the existing police communication allocation changed, and Radio 1 acquired them for its own national FM network. This was rolled out as of 1 September 1988, starting with the Central Scotland, Midlands & the north of England areas (FM broadcasts were available in London as of 31 October 1987, but this was at low power on 104.8&nbsp;MHz FM.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/images/transmitfm_sht1.jpg |title=Plans for Radio 1 FM services introduction |publisher=Radiorewind.co.uk |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> Radio 1 made great efforts to promote its new FM service, renaming itself on-air initially to 'Radio 1 FM' and also later on as '1FM' until 1995.

The Conservative government then decided that to increase competition on AM it would disallow the simulcast of services available on both AM and FM. Therefore, Radio 1's old medium wave frequencies were reallocated to Talk Radio UK in 1994 (now [[Talksport]]). Radio 1's last broadcast on MW was on 1 July that year, with [[Stephen Duffy]]'s "Kiss Me" being the last record played on MW just before 9:00 am. In the initial months after this closure a pre-recorded message with [[Mark Goodier]] was played to warn listeners that Radio 1 was now an "FM-only" station.<ref name="Radio 1 transmitter AM switchoff">{{cite web|url=http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/radio1/transmitter.htm |title=Radio 1 History - Transmitters |publisher=Radio Rewind |date= |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> During this time Radio 1 began broadcasting on spare audio subcarriers on [[Sky Television plc|Sky Television's]] analogue satellite service, initially in mono (on [[Gold (TV channel)|UK Gold]]) and later in stereo (on [[Sky Living|UK Living]]).

=== Digital distribution ===
The BBC launched its national radio stations on [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]] digital radio in 1995, however the technology was expensive at the time and so was not marketed, instead used as a test for future technologies. DAB was "officially" launched in 2002 as sets became cheaper. Today it can also be heard on UK digital TV services [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], [[Virgin Media]], [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]] and the Internet as well as FM. In July 2005, [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] began [[simulcast]]ing Radio 1 across the United States as channel 11 on its own service and channel 6011 on [[Dish Network]] satellite TV. [[Sirius Canada]] began simulcasting Radio 1 when it was launched on 1 December 2005 (also on channel 11). The Sirius simulcasts were [[Time shifting|time shifted]] five hours to allow U.S. and Canadian listeners in the [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|Eastern Time Zone]] to hear Radio 1 at the same time of day as UK listeners. On 12 November 2008, Radio 1 made its debut on XM Satellite Radio in both the US and Canada on channel 29,{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} moving to XM 15 and Sirius 15 on 4 May 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siriusxm.com/pdf/11-524_SIR_WebLUs_5_4.pdf|title=Sirius Channel Lineup|date=2 May 2011|accessdate=4 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siriusxm.com/pdf/11-524_XM_WebLUs_5_4.pdf|title=XM Channel Lineup|date=2 May 2011|accessdate=4 May 2011}}</ref> Until the full station was removed in August 2011, Radio 1 was able to be heard by approximately 20.6 million listeners in North America on satellite radio alone.
BBC Radio 1 can be heard on cable in the Netherlands at 105.10 FM.

{{Update|inaccurate=yes|date=October 2012}}
At 12am on 9 August 2011, [[Sirius XM Radio|Sirius XM]] ceased carrying BBC Radio 1 programming with no prior warning. On 10 August 2011 the BBC issued the following statement:
<blockquote>The BBC’s commercial arm BBC Worldwide has been in partnership with SIRIUS Satellite Radio to broadcast Radio 1 on their main network, since 2005.  This agreement has now unfortunately come to an end and BBC Worldwide are in current discussions with the satellite radio station to find ways to continue to bring popular music channel, BBC Radio 1, to the US audience. We will keep you posted.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/bbcworldwide/worldwidestories/pressreleases/2011/08_august/r1_sirius.shtml | title=Radio 1 - Sirius | publisher=BBC | work=BBC Worldwide Press Releases | date=10 August 2011 | accessdate=12 October 2013}}</ref></blockquote>

Thousands of angry Sirius XM customers began a campaign on [[Facebook]] and other social media to reinstate BBC Radio 1 on Sirius XM Radio.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.facebook.com/SaveRadio1inNorthAmerica | title=Get BBC Radio 1 Back on Sirius XM | publisher=Facebook | accessdate=12 October 2013}}</ref> One week later, Sirius and the BBC agreed on a new carriage agreement<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siriusxm.com/bbcradio1 |title=BBC Radio 1 - British Pop hits from U.K. Charts - SiriusXM Radio |publisher=Siriusxm.com |date= |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> that saw Radio 1 broadcast on a time-shifted format on the Sirius XM Internet Radio platform only, on channel 815. The channel is still unavailable on the satellite platform of the service.

Starting on 15 January 2012, ''The Official Chart Show'' began broadcasting on SiriusXM ''20on20'' channel 3, at 4pm and 9pm [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Standard Time]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

On 19 August 2014, SiriusXM again stopped carrying BBC Radio 1 programming with no advanced notice. The stream is no longer available on the Internet Radio platform.

=== Regionalisation ===<!-- This section is linked from [[BBC Northern Ireland]] -->
From 1999 until 2012, Radio 1 split the [[home nations]] for localised programming in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to allow the broadcast of a showcase programme for regional talent. Most recently, these shows were under the [[BBC Introducing]] brand. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had their own shows, which were broadcast on a 3-week rotational basis in England.

From January 2011 until June 2012 Scotland's show was presented by Ally McCrae.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00x592r |title=BBC Radio 1 - BBC Introducing in Scotland with Ally McCrae |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=11 June 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> Formally it was hosted by [[Vic Galloway]] (who also presents for [[BBC Radio Scotland]]); who had presented the show solo since 2004, after his original co-host [[Gill Mills]] departed.

Wales's show was hosted by Jen Long between January 2011 until May 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00x592p |title=BBC Radio 1 - BBC Introducing in Wales with Jen Long |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=28 May 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> Previously [[Bethan Elfyn]] occupied the slot, who had at one time hosted alongside Huw Stephens,<ref name="regions98">{{cite web|url=http://frequencyfinder.org.uk/r1_sched_98_04.html |title=Frequency Finder UK - Classic Radio 1 schedules |publisher=Frequencyfinder.org.uk |date=25 October 2004 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> until Stephens left to join the national network (Stephens still broadcasts a show for the Wales region, a Welsh-language music show on [[BBC Radio Cymru]], on a Monday evening between 7pm-10pm.)

Phil Taggart presented the Northern Irish programme between November 2011 and May 2012. The show was formerly presented by [[Rory McConnell]]. Before joining the national network, [[Colin Murray]] was a presenter on the Session in Northern Ireland, along with Donna Legge;<ref name="regions98" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article.aspx?art_id=1253 |title=Who is Colin Murray? |publisher=Culturenorthernireland.org |date=19 September 2008 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> after Murray's promotion to the network Legge hosted alone for a time, and on her departure McConnell took her place.

The regional opt-outs originally went out from 8:00 pm to 10:00 pm on Thursdays (the Evening Session's time slot) and were known as the Session in the Nations (the 'Session' tag was later dropped due to the demise of the Evening Session); they later moved to run from 7:30 pm to 9:00 pm, with the first half-hour of Zane Lowe's programme going out across the whole of the UK. On 18 October 2007 the regional programmes moved to a Wednesday night/Thursday morning slot from 12:00 am to 2:00 am under the ''BBC Introducing'' banner, allowing Lowe's Thursday show to be aired across the network; prior to this change Huw Stephens had presented the Wednesday midnight show nationally. In January 2011, BBC Introducing was moved to the new time slot of 00:00 to 02:00 on Monday mornings, and the Scottish and Welsh shows were given new presenters in the form of Ally McCrae and Jen Long.

The opt-outs were only available to listeners on the FM frequencies. Because of the way the DAB and digital TV services of Radio 1 are broadcast (a single-frequency network on DAB and a single broadcast feed of Radio 1 on TV platforms), the digital version of the station was not regionalised.

The [[BBC Trust]] announced in May 2012 that the regional music programmes on Radio 1 would be replaced with a single programme offering a UK-wide platform for new music as part of a series of cost-cutting measures across the BBC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18083178 |title=BBC News - Children's shows to leave BBC One |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=16 May 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> In June 2012, the regional shows ended and were replaced by a single ''BBC Introducing'' show presented by Jen Long and Ally McCrae.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01jk7zb |title=BBC Radio 1 - BBC Introducing with Jen and Ally |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref>

== Content ==

=== Music ===
Because of its youth-orientated nature, Radio 1 plays a mix of current songs, including [[indie rock|independent]]/[[alternative rock|alternative]], [[rap]], [[hip hop]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[House music|house]], [[electronica]], [[Dance music|dance]], [[drum and bass]], [[dubstep]] and [[Pop music|pop]].

Due to restrictions on the amount of commercial music that could be played on radio in the UK until 1988 (the "[[needle time]]" limitation) the station has recorded many live performances. Studio sessions (recordings of about four tracks made in a single day), also supplemented the live music content, many them finding their way to commercially available LPs and CDs. The sessions recorded for [[John Peel]]'s late night programme are particularly renowned.

The station also broadcasts documentaries and interviews. Although this type of programming arose from necessity it has given the station diversity. The needletime restrictions meant the station tended to have a higher level of speech by DJs. While the station is often criticised for "waffling" by presenters, an experimental "more music day" in 1988 was declared a failure after only a third of callers favoured it.

=== News and current affairs ===
{{Main|Newsbeat}}
Radio 1 has a [[Public service broadcasting in the United Kingdom|public service broadcasting]] obligation to provide news, which it fulfills through [[Newsbeat]] bulletins throughout the day. Shared with [[BBC Radio 1Xtra|1Xtra]], short news summaries are provided roughly hourly on the half-hour during daytime hours with two 15-minute bulletins at 12:45 and 17:45 on weekdays. The main presenter is Chris Smith, with [[Tina Daheley]] presenting during Radio 1's breakfast hours.

=== Online visualisation and social media ===
In recent years, Radio 1 has aimed to include more of its content online in order to relate to the changing nature of its audience. Its [[YouTube]] channel now has over 1 million subscribers<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/user/bbcradio1|title = BBC Radio 1 - YouTube|date = |accessdate = 11 August 2014|website = BBC Radio 1 - YouTube|publisher = |last = |first = }}
</ref> and many features and events are streamed on both that and the Radio 1 website.

The station also has a heavy presence on social media, with audience interaction now occurring mainly through [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] as well as [[Short Message Service|text messaging]].

It was announced in 2013 that Radio 1 had submitted plans to launch its own dedicated video channel on the [[BBC iPlayer]]<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/radio-1-channel.html|title = BBC Media Centre|date = 7 October 2013|accessdate = |website = Radio 1 to have own channel on BBC iPlayer|publisher = BBC|last = |first = }}
</ref> where videos of live performances as well as some features and shows would be streamed in a central location. Plans were approved by the [[BBC Trust]] in November 2014 and the channel will launch on 10 November 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://radiotoday.co.uk/2014/11/launch-date-set-for-radio-1s-iplayer-channel/|title = Launch date set for Radio 1’s iPlayer channel|date = 3 November 2014|accessdate =3 November 2014 |website = Radio Today|publisher = Radio Today|last =Martin |first =Roy }}</ref>

== Notable programming ==

=== Breakfast ===
{{Main|The Radio 1 Breakfast Show}}
The breakfast show has been presented by many famous names over the years. Currently this slot is broadcast between 6:30 am and 10:00 am, Monday to Friday and is hosted by [[Nick Grimshaw]].

=== Chart show ===
{{main|The Official Chart}}
BBC Radio 1's chart show had aired the [[UK Singles Chart]] exclusively on Sunday afternoons since the programme began; but this was moved to Fridays in July 2015. Currently broadcasting from 4:00 pm until 7:00 pm, the format, length and starting time have varied over the years, but it has always finished at 7:00 pm. For many years, the show prided itself on playing all 40 singles in the top 40 but this practice ended when [[Wes Butters]] took over as presenter in 2003; then only tracks below number 20 to be played were the new entries.

=== Special programming ===

==== Bank Holiday programming ====
Radio 1 provides alternative programming on some Bank Holidays. Programmes have included 'The 10 Hour Takeover', a request-based special, in which the DJs on air would encourage listeners to select any available track to play.

==== 40th birthday ====
On Sunday 30 September 2007, Radio 1 celebrated its 40th birthday.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/established1967|title = Radio 1 Established 1967|publisher = [[bbc.co.uk]]|accessdate = 2 February 2008}}
</ref> To mark this anniversary Radio 1 hosted a week of special features, including:
* Special shows hosted by music legends at 9:00 pm each weekday.
* Between 9:00 am and 10:00 am on the [[Chris Moyles]] show, the best music from the last 40 years (a re-creation of Simon Bates' [[The Golden Hour (Radio Feature)|Golden Hour]]).
* Playing Radio 1's old jingles, which were created by [[JAM Creative Productions]].
* 40 different artists performed 40 different covers, one from each year since Radio 1 was established. All 40 songs were played in the weeks leading up to the release of the [[compilation album]] ''[[Radio 1 Established 1967]]''.
* On the anniversary day [[Chris Moyles]] was joined on a special Breakfast Show by [[Tony Blackburn]]
* [[Vernon Kay]] interviewed past Breakfast Show presenters including [[Noel Edmonds]], [[Dave Lee Travis]] and [[Mike Smith (television presenter)|Mike Smith]].
* Ex Breakfast Show hosts [[Sara Cox]] & [[Zoë Ball]] teamed up to present an anniversary show on the Sunday.
* Past newsreaders including Peter Bowes, Richard Evans & Rod McKenzie returned to present bulletins.

==== Charity ====
Radio 1 regularly supports charities [[Comic Relief]], [[Sport Relief]] and [[Children in Need]].

On 18 March 2011, BBC's Radio 1 longest serving breakfast DJ [[Chris Moyles]] and sidekick [[Comedy Dave|Dave Vitty]] broadcast for 52 hours as part of a [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] attempt, in aid of [[Comic Relief]]. The pair stayed on air for 52 hours in total setting a new world record for 'Radio DJ Endurance Marathon (Team)’ after already breaking [[Simon Mayo]]'s 12-year record for Radio 1's Longest Show of 37 hours which he set in 1999, also for Comic Relief.

The presenters started on 16 March 2011 and came off air at 10:30 am on 18 March 2011. During this Fearne Cotton made a bet with DJ Chris Moyles that if they raise over £2,000,000 she will appear on the show in a swimsuit. After passing the £2,000,000 mark, Cotton appeared on the studio webcam in a stripy monochrome swimsuit. The appearance of Cotton between 10:10 am and 10:30 am caused the Radio 1 website to crash due to a high volume of traffic.

In total the event raised £2,622,421 for Comic Relief.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/chrismoyles/longestshow/ |title=Radio 1 - BBC Radio 1's Longest Show Ever with Chris Moyles and Comedy Dave for Comic Relief |publisher=BBC |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref>

== Events ==

=== Radio 1 Roadshows ===
The [[Radio 1 Roadshow]], which usually involved Radio 1 DJs and pop stars travelling around popular UK seaside destinations, began in 1973,<ref>http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/radio1/roadshow.htm</ref> hosted by [[Alan Freeman]] in [[Newquay]], [[Cornwall]], with the final one held at [[Heaton Park]], [[Manchester]] in 1999. Although the Roadshow attracted large crowds and the style changed with the style of the station itself—such as the introduction of whistlestop audio postcards of each location in 1994 ("2minuteTour")—they were still rooted in the older style of the station, and therefore fit for retirement.<ref>http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/end-of-the-road-for-radio-one-roadshow-284233.html</ref>

=== BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend ===
{{Main|Radio 1's Big Weekend}}
In March 2000, Radio 1 decided to change the Roadshow format, renaming it ''One Big Sunday'' in the process. Several of these ''Sundays'' were held in large city-centre parks. In 2003, the event changed again and was rebranded ''[[Radio 1's Big Weekend|One Big Weekend]]'', with each event occurring biannually and covering two days. Under this name, it visited [[Derry]] in Northern Ireland, as part of the ''Music Lives'' campaign, and [[Perry Park (Birmingham)|Perry Park]] in [[Birmingham]].

The most recent change occurred in 2005 when the event was yet again renamed and the decision taken to hold only one per year, this time as [[Radio 1's Big Weekend]]. Venues under this title have included [[Herrington|Herrington Country Park]], [[Camperdown Country Park]], [[Moor Park, Preston|Moor Park]]–which was the first ''Weekend'' to feature a third stage–[[Mote Park]], [[Lydiard Park]], [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]] and [[Carlisle Lake District Airport|Carlisle Airport]].

Tickets for each ''Big Weekend'' are given away free of charge, making it the largest free ticketed music festival in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/bigweekend/|title=Radio 1 announced line-up for One Big Weekend, Preston|publisher=[[bbc.co.uk]]|accessdate=2 February 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080218203420/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/bigweekend/| archivedate= 18 February 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend was replaced by a larger festival in 2012, named 'Radio 1's Hackney Weekend', with a crowd capacity of 100,000. The Hackney Weekend took place over the weekend of 23–24 June 2012 in [[Hackney Marshes]], [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], London. The event was to celebrate the [[2012 Cultural Olympiad]] in London and had artists such as [[Rihanna]], [[Jay-Z]] and [[Florence and the Machine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/events/hackneyweekend2012 |title=Radio 1's Hackney Weekend 2012 |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref>

In 2013, Radio 1's Big Weekend returned to [[Derry]] as part of the City of Culture 2013 celebrations. So far, Derry is the only city to have hosted the Big Weekend twice.

In May 2014, Radio 1's Big Weekend was held in Glasgow, Scotland. Acts which played at the event included [[Rita Ora]], [[The 1975]], [[Katy Perry]], [[Jake Bugg]] and [[Pharrell Williams]]. The event was opened on the Friday with a dance set in [[George Square]], featuring Radio 1 Dance DJs such as [[Danny Howard]] and [[Pete Tong]], and other well-known acts such as [[Martin Garrix]] and [[Tiësto|Tiesto]].

=== Ibiza Weekend ===
Radio 1 has annually held a dance music weekend broadcast live from [[Ibiza]] since the 1990s. The weekend has performances from world famous DJs and Radio 1's own dance music talent such as [[Pete Tong]] and [[Annie Mac]].

=== BBC Radio 1's Teen Awards ===
Since 2008 Radio 1 has held an annual event for teenagers aged 14 to 17 years. Originally named [[BBC Switch]] Live, the first event was held on 12 October 2008 at the [[Hammersmith Apollo]]. The event has been hosted by various Radio 1 DJs and guest co-hosts.

In 2010 the event was renamed 'BBC Radio 1's Teen Awards', and includes awards given to celebrities and particularly inspirational young people. Now hosted at [[Wembley Arena]], the event has included guests such as [[One Direction]], [[Tinie Tempah]], [[Fall Out Boy]] and [[Jessie J]].

The 2014 event took place in October and was hosted by [[Nick Grimshaw]] and [[Rita Ora]].<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/events/ec8mxj</ref>

=== Edinburgh Festival ===
Radio 1 often has a presence at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]]. Past events have included 'The Fun and Filth Cabaret' and 'Scott Mills: The Musical'.
