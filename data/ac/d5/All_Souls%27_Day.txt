==Byzantine (Greek) Catholic and the Eastern Orthodoxy==<!-- [[Saturday of the dead]] redirects here -->
Among [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Byzantine Rite|Byzantine (Greek)]] [[Eastern Catholic|Catholics]], there are several All Souls' Days during the year. Most of these fall on Saturday, since [[Jesus]] lay in the [[Holy Sepulchre|Tomb]] on [[Holy Saturday]]. These are referred to as Soul Saturdays.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} They occur on the following occasions:
*The Saturday of [[Paschal cycle#Pre-Lent|Meatfare Week]] (the second Saturday before [[Great Lent]])—the day before the Sunday of the Last Judgement
*The second Saturday of Great Lent
*The third Saturday of Great Lent
*The fourth Saturday of Great Lent
*[[Radonitsa]] (Monday or Tuesday after [[Thomas Sunday]])
*The Saturday before [[Pentecost]]
*Demetrius Saturday (the Saturday before the feast of [[Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki]]—26 October) (In all of the [[Orthodox Church]] there is a commemoration of the dead on the Saturday before the feast of [[Saint Michael the Archangel]]—8 November, instead of the Demetrius Soul Saturday)

In the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] there is also a commemoration of the dead on the Saturday closest to the Conception of [[St. John the Baptist]]—[[September 23 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|23 September]]{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In Slavic and Greek Churches, all of the Lenten Soul Saturdays are typically observed. In some of the Churches of the Eastern Mediterranean, Meatfare Saturday, Radonitsa and the Saturday before Pentecost are typically observed.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In addition to the Sundays mentioned above, Saturdays throughout the year are days for general commemoration of all saints, and special hymns to all saints are chanted from the [[Octoechos (liturgy)|Octoechos]], unless some greater [[Great Feasts|feast]] or [[saint]]'s commemoration occurs.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Roman Catholicism==
[[File:Jakub Schikaneder - All Souls' Day.jpg|thumbnail|''All Souls' Day'', Painting by [[Jakub Schikaneder]], 1888.]]
[[Prayer for the dead]] is a documented practice in Judaism and Christianity. The setting aside of a particular day for praying not for certain named individuals but for whole classes of the departed or for the dead in general cannot be traced to the earliest Christian centuries, but was well established by the end of the first millennium. Prayers for the deceased members of Benedictine monasteries were offered in the week after Pentecost and the practice of praying for the dead at a date near Pentecost was also followed in Spain in the 7th century. Other dates chosen were Epiphany and the anniversary of the death of some well-known saint, as shown by evidence from the beginning of the 9th century. By about 980, 1 October was an established date in Germany. The 11th century saw the introduction of a liturgical commemoration in diocesan calendars. In Milan the date was 16 October until changed in the second half of the 16th century to 2 November. This date, the day after [[All Saints' Day]], was that which Saint [[Odilo of Cluny]] chose in the 11th century for all the monasteries dependent on the [[Abbey of Cluny]]. From these the 2 November custom spread to other Benedictine monasteries and thence to the Western Church in general.<ref name=ZENIT>{{cite web|url=http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/all-souls-commemoration|title=Edward McNamara, "All Souls' Commemoration"|work=ZENIT - The World Seen From Rome|accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref>

The official name of the celebration in the [[Roman Rite]] [[liturgy]] is "'''The Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed'''".{{sfn|Mershman|1907}} In some countries the celebration is known as the '''[[Day of the Dead]]'''.

In the Roman Rite as revised in 1969, if 2 November falls on a Sunday, the Mass is of All Souls, but the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] is that of the Sunday. However, public celebration of Lauds and Vespers of the Dead with the people participating is permitted. A Sunday celebration of All Souls' Day is not anticipated on Saturday evening, as are a Sunday Mass and that of a solemnity or feast of the Lord that replaces a Sunday.  In countries where All Saints' Day is not a [[holy day of obligation]] attendance at an evening Mass of All Saints on Saturday 1 November satisfies the Sunday obligation.<ref name=ZENIT/> In every country, the formula of the Mass on that Saturday evening is that of the solemnity of All Saints, which outranks the Sunday of Ordinary Time whose Mass would normally be celebrated on that evening.<ref name=ZENIT/><ref>Universal Norms on the Liturgical Year and the Calendar, "Table of Liturgical Days"]</ref> However, in 2014, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops decided that for that year the Saturday evening (Sunday vigil) Mass in that country was to be that of All Souls.<ref name=ZENIT14>{{cite web|url=http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/all-souls-day-and-the-vigil-mass|title=Edward McNamara, "All Souls' Day and the Vigil Mass"|date=29 October 2014 |work=ZENIT - The World Seen From Rome|accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref>

In England and Wales, where holy days of obligation that fall on a Saturday are transferred to the following day, if 2 November is a Sunday, the solemnity of All Saints is transferred to that date, and All Souls Day is transferred to 3 November.<ref name=ZENIT14/> In pre-1970 forms of the Roman Rite, still observed by some, if All Souls Day falls on a Sunday, it is always transferred to 3 November.

Faithful departed may gain [[indulgence]], either plenary or partial indulgence, if the living perform certain acts and meet the specified requirements.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/tribunals/apost_penit/documents/rc_trib_appen_doc_20020826_enchiridion-indulgentiarum_lt.html |publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana |year=1999 |edition=16 iulii 1999 - Quarta editio |title=Enchiridion Indulgentiarum |language=Latin}}</ref>{{rp|N.15}}

==Anglican Communion==
[[File:Leichhardt All Souls Anglican Church.JPG|right|thumb|[[All Souls Anglican Church, Leichhardt|All Souls Anglican Church]] in the  [[Anglican Diocese of Sydney|Diocese of Sydney]], a parish dedicated to All Souls]]
In the [[Anglican Communion]], All Souls' Day is known liturgically as the Commemoration of All Faithful Departed, and is an optional observance seen as "an extension of All Saints' Day", the latter of which marks the first day of [[Allhallowtide]].<ref name=Third/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://baptistnews.com/opinion/commentaries/item/29405-recovering-allhallowtide|title=Recovering Allhallowtide|last=Dickison|first=Scott|date=22 October 2014|publisher=[[Baptist News Global]]|language=English|accessdate=20 September 2015|quote=Within the greater tradition of the church, All Hallows’ Eve and All Hallows’/Saints’ Day are actually the first two days of “Allhallowtide,” with “All Souls’ Day” being the final holiday of this three-day “season.”}}</ref> Historically and at present, several Anglican churches are dedicated to All Souls. During the [[English Reformation]], the observance of All Souls' Day lapsed, although a new Anglican theological understanding of the day has "led to a widespread acceptance of this commemoration among Anglicans".<ref name="Michno1998">{{cite book|last=Michno|first=Dennis G.|title=A Priest's Handbook: The Ceremonies of the Church, Third Edition||date=1 July 1998|publisher=Church Publishing, Inc.|language=English |isbn=9780819225047|page=160|quote=Though the observance of this day was abolished at the Reformation because of abuses connected with Masses for the dead, a renewed understanding of its meaning has led to a widespread acceptance of this commemoration among Anglicans, and to its inclusion as an optional observance in the calendar of the Episcopal Church.}}</ref> Patricia Bays, with regard to the Anglican view of All Souls' Day, wrote that:<ref name="BaysHancock2012"/>

==Protestant churches==
At the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] the celebration of All Souls' Day was fused with [[All Saints' Day]] in the [[Church of England]], though it was renewed individually in certain churches in connection with the [[Oxford Movement]] of the 19th century. The observance was officially made prominent with the publication of the 1980 ''[[Alternative Service Book]]'', and it features in ''[[Common Worship]]'' as a [[Lesser Festival]] called "Commemoration of the Faithful Departed (All Souls' Day)".

Among continental [[Protestantism|Protestants]] its tradition has been more tenaciously maintained. During [[Martin Luther (religious leader)|Luther's]] lifetime, All Souls' Day was widely observed in [[Saxony]] although the Roman Catholic meaning of the day was discarded; ecclesiastically in the [[Lutheran Church]], the day was merged with, and is often seen as an extension of All Saints' Day,<ref>{{cite web|title=St. Paul's Lutheran Church of Wurtemburg|last=Isaacs|first=Linda A.|date=6 November 2011|work=St. Paul's Lutheran Church of Wurtemburg|publisher=[[Evangelical Lutheran Conference & Ministerium of North America]]|language=English||quote=In fact, the Lutheran tradition lumps "All Saints Day" and "All Souls Day" together because we believe that we are all saints through our faith!}}</ref> with many Lutherans still visiting and decorating graves on all the days of Allhallowtide, including All Souls' Day.<ref name="VenbruxQuartier2013">{{cite book|last1=Venbrux|first1=Eric|last2=Quartier|first2=Thomas|last3=Venhorst|first3=Claudia|coauthors=Brenda Mathijssen|title=Changing European Death Ways||date=2013-01-12|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|language=English |isbn=9783643900678|page=183|quote=The way in which graveyards in Denmark are looked after suggests that they are deemed important. ... they are in the hands of the Lutheran church ... Furthermore, special attention to the graves is paid by decorating them in the month of Christmas, at Easter and on All Souls' day.

Among [[Czech people]] the custom of visiting and tidying graves of relatives on the day is quite common. In 1816, [[Prussia]] introduced a new date for the remembrance of the Dead among its Lutheran citizens: [[Totensonntag]], the last Sunday before [[Advent]]. This custom was later also adopted by the non-Prussian Lutherans in Germany, but it has not spread much beyond the Protestant areas of Germany.

In the [[Methodist Church]], [[Saints in Methodism|saints]] refer to all [[Christian]]s and therefore, on [[All Saint's Day]], the [[Church Universal]], as well as the deceased members of a [[local congregation]] are honoured and remembered.<ref name=Methodism>{{cite web|author=Laura Huff Hileman|title=What is All Saint's Day?|url=http://upperroom.org/askjulian/default.asp?act=answer&itemid=276387|quote=Saints are just people who are trying to listen to God's word and live God's call.

==Origins, practices and purposes==
Some believe that the origins of  All Souls' Day in [[European folklore]] and [[folk belief]] are related to customs of [[ancestor veneration]]<ref name="Norget2006">{{cite book|author=Kristin Norget|title=Days of Death, Days of Life: Ritual in the Popular Culture of Oaxaca|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2PfDPufLSUEC&pg=PA193|accessdate=2 November 2012|year=2006|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-13689-1|pages=193–}}</ref> practiced worldwide, through events such as the Chinese [[Ghost Festival]], the Japanese [[Bon Festival]]. The Roman custom was that of the [[Lemuria (festival)|Lemuria]].

The formal commemoration of the saints and martyrs ([[All Saints' Day]]) existed in the early Christian church since its [[Edict of Toleration by Galerius|legalization]], and alongside that developed a day for commemoration of all the dead (All Souls' Day). The modern date of All Souls' Day was first popularized in the early eleventh century after [[Odilo of Cluny|Abbot Odilo]] established it as a day for the monks of Cluny and associated monasteries to pray for the souls in purgatory. 

Many of these European traditions reflect the dogma of [[purgatory]]. For example, ringing bells for the dead was believed to comfort them in their cleansing there, while the sharing of [[soul cakes]] with the poor helped to buy the dead a bit of respite from the suffering of purgatory. In the same way, lighting candles was meant to kindle a light for the dead souls languishing in the darkness. Out of this grew the traditions of "going souling" and the baking of special types of bread or cakes.<ref>Medieval Histories 2012: 11:1 http://medievalhistories.com/wp-content/uploads/medievalhistories-november1.pdf</ref>

In [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]], cakes are left for them on the table and the room kept warm for their comfort. In [[Brittany]], people flock to the cemeteries at nightfall to kneel, bareheaded, at the graves of their loved ones, and to anoint the hollow of the [[tomb stone|tombstone]] with [[holy water]] or to pour libations of milk on it. At bedtime, the supper is left on the table for the souls.

In Bolivia, many people believe that the dead eat the food that is left out for them.
In Brazil people attend a Mass or visit the cemetery taking flowers to decorate their relatives' grave, but no food is involved.

In [[Malta]] many people make pilgrimages to graveyards, not just to visit the graves of their dead relatives, but to experience the special day in all its significance. Visits are not restricted to this day alone. During the month of November, Malta's cemeteries are frequented by families of the departed. Mass is also said throughout the month, with certain Catholic parishes organising special events at cemetery chapels.
