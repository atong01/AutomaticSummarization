{{Sexual orientation}}
'''Romantic orientation''', also called '''affectional orientation''', indicates the [[sex]] or [[gender]] with which a person is most likely to have a [[romance (love)|romantic relationship]] or [[Falling in love|fall in love]]. It is used both alternatively and side-by-side with the term ''[[sexual orientation]]'', and is based on the perspective that [[sexual attraction]] is but a single component of a larger dynamic.<ref>Crethar, H. C. & Vargas, L. A. (2007). ''Multicultural intricacies in professional counseling.'' In J. Gregoire & C. Jungers (Eds.), The counselor’s companion: What every beginning counselor needs to know. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum. ISBN 0-8058-5684-6. p.61.</ref> For example, although a [[pansexuality|pansexual]] person may feel sexually attracted to multiple genders, they may be predisposed to romantic intimacy with females. For [[Asexuality|asexual]] people, romantic orientation is often considered a more useful measure of attraction than sexual orientation.<ref name="Richards and Barker">{{cite book|authors=Christina Richards, Meg Barker|title=Sexuality and Gender for Mental Health Professionals: A Practical Guide|isbn=1-4462-9313-0|publisher=[[Sage Publications|SAGE]]|year=2013|pages=124–127|accessdate=July 3, 2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uSiXAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT124}}</ref><ref name="Cerankowski and Milks">{{cite book|authors=Karli June Cerankowski, Megan Milks|title=Asexualities: Feminist and Queer Perspectives|isbn=1-134-69253-6|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2014|pages=89–93|accessdate=July 3, 2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zLgTAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA89}}</ref>

==Relationship with sexuality and asexuality==
The implications of the distinction between romantic and sexual orientations has not been fully recognized, nor has it been studied extensively.{{sfn|Bogaert|2012|p=14}} It is common for sources to describe sexual orientation as including components of both sexual and romantic (or romantic equivalent) attractions.{{sfn|Bogaert|2012|p=14}} Similarly, ''romantic love'' has been noted as "love with strong components of sexuality and infatuation,"{{sfn|King|2010|p=450}} although some sources contradict this notion, stating that sexual and romantic attraction are not necessarily linked.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lgbtq.unc.edu/asexuality-attraction-and-romantic-orientation|title=Asexuality, Attraction, and Romantic Orientation|publisher=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|accessdate=April 9, 2015}}</ref> With regard to asexuality, while asexuals usually do not experience sexual attraction (see [[gray asexuality]]), they may still experience romantic attraction.<ref name="Richards and Barker"/><ref name="Cerankowski and Milks"/>
