It sold for 10 cents a copy from newsstands across the country. In 1910, moving to New York City, he renamed the magazine &quot;Aircraft&quot; and published it until 1914. The magazine chronicled the technical developments of the early aviation pioneers. He was the first advocate for commercial air travel, coining the term &quot;airline.&quot; He also advocated for a strong American flying force, lobbying Congress in 1913 to expand its appropriations for Army aircraft.</paragraph><paragraph>In early 1913, he learned to fly the Sloan-Deperdussin and the<space/><link><target>Blriot XI</target><part>Moisant-Bleriot</part></link><space/>monoplanes, becoming an accomplished pilot. Later that year he bought a Thomas flying boat and became the first air commuter regularly flying from his country house in Seidler's Beach NJ to the foot of 75th Street in NYC (about 35 miles). In 1917, utilizing the knowledge gained from 10 years advocating aviation, he built his first airplane, the Lawson Military Tractor 1 (MT-1) trainer, and founded the Lawson Aircraft Corporation. The company's plant was sited at Green Bay, WI. There he secured a contract and built the Lawson MT-2. He also designed the steel fuselage Lawson Armored Battler, which never got beyond the drafting board, given doubts within the Army aviation community and the signing of the armistice.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Lawson T-2.jpg</target><part>left</part><part>Lawson C.2 or T-2</part></link>After the war, in 1919 Lawson started a project to build America's first airline.

He demonstrated its capabilities in a 2000-mile multi-city tour from Milwaukee to Chicago-Toledo-Cleveland-Buffalo-Syracuse-New york City-Washington DC-Collinsville-Dayton-Chicago and back to Milwaukee, creating a buzz of positive press.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last">Alfred</arg><arg name="first">Lawson</arg><arg name="title">200 Mile Trip in First Airliner</arg><arg name="year">1928</arg><arg name="url">http://books.google.com/books?id</arg></template></extension><space/>The publicity allowed him to secure an additional $1 million to build the 26-passenger<space/><link><target>Lawson L-4</target><part>Midnight Liner</part></link>. In late 1920, he secured government contracts for three airmail routes and to deliver 10 war planes, but owing to the fall 1920 recession, he could not secure the necessary $100,000 in cash reserves called for in the contracts and had to decline them. In 1926 he started his last airliner, the 56-seat, two-tier Lawson super airliner.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="title">Lawson - Aircraft Industry Builder</arg><arg name="year">1930</arg><arg name="publisher">Humanity publishing company</arg></template></extension><space/>The aircraft crashed on takeoff on its maiden flight.</paragraph><paragraph>In this phase of his life, he was considered one of the leading thinkers in the budding American commercial aviation community, but his troubles with getting financial backing for his ideas led him to turn to economics, philosophy, and organization.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Lawsonomy (1929-1954)</heading><paragraph>In the 1920s, he promoted health practices, including<space/><link><target>vegetarianism</target></link>, and claimed to have found the secret of living to 200.

Lawson repeatedly predicted the worldwide adoption of Lawsonian principles by the year 2000.</paragraph><paragraph>He later propounded his own philosophy, Lawsonomy, and the<space/><link><target>Lawsonian religion</target></link>. He also developed, during the<space/><link><target>Great Depression</target></link>, the<space/><link><target>Populism</target><part>populist</part></link><space/>economic theory of &quot;<link><target>Direct Credit</target><trail>s</trail></link>&quot;, according to which banks are the cause of all economic woes, the oppressors of both capital and labour. Lawson believed that the government should replace banks as the provider of loans to business and workers. His rallies and lectures attracted thousands of listeners in the early 1930s, mainly in the upper Midwest, but by the late 1930s the crowds had dwindled.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1943, he founded the<space/><link><target>University of Lawsonomy</target></link><space/>in<space/><link><target>Des Moines, Iowa</target><part>Des Moines</part></link><space/>to spread his teachings and offer the degree of &quot;Knowledgian,&quot; but after various IRS and other investigations it was closed and finally sold in 1954, the year of Lawson's death. Lawson's financial arrangements remain mysterious to this day, and in later years he seems to have owned little property, moving from city to city as a guest of his farflung acolytes. In 1952, he was brought before a<space/><link><target>United States Senate</target></link><space/>investigative committee on allegations that his organization had bought war surplus machines and then sold them for a profit, despite claiming<space/><link><target>non-profit</target></link><space/>status. His attempt to explain Lawsonomy to the senators ended in mutual frustration and bafflement.<extension extension_name='ref'><italics>Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science</italics>, p. 77</extension><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite news</target><arg name="url"><space/>http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,816203,00.html<space/></arg><arg name="work">Time<space/></arg><arg name="title">Education: Zigzag & Swirl<space/></arg><arg name="date">March 24, 1952</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>A farm near<space/><link><target>Racine, Wisconsin</target><part>Racine</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Wisconsin</target></link>, is the only remaining university facility, although a tiny handful of churches may yet survive in places such as<space/><link><target>Wichita, Kansas</target><part>Wichita</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Kansas</target></link>.
