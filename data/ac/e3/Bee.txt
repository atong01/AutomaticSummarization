'''Bees''' are flying [[insect]]s closely related to [[wasp]]s and [[ant]]s, known for their role in [[pollination]] and, in the case of the best-known bee species, the [[European honey bee]], for producing [[honey]] and [[beeswax]]. Bees are a [[monophyly|monophyletic]] lineage within the superfamily [[Apoidea]], presently considered as a [[clade]] '''Anthophila'''. There are nearly 20,000 known species of bees in seven to nine recognized families,<ref name="Danforthetal2006">{{cite journal |author=Danforth BN, Sipes S, Fang J, Brady SG |title=The history of early bee diversification based on five genes plus morphology |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=103 |issue=41 |pages=15118–23 |date=October 2006 |pmid=17015826 |pmc=1586180 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0604033103 }}</ref> though many are undescribed and the actual number is probably higher.  They are found on every continent except [[Antarctica]], in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated [[flowering plant]]s.

Some species including [[honey bee]]s, [[bumblebee]]s, and [[stingless bee]]s live [[eusociality|socially]] in colonies. Bees are adapted for feeding on [[nectar (plant)|nectar]] and [[pollen]], the former primarily as an energy source and the latter primarily for [[protein]] and other nutrients. Most pollen is used as food for [[larva]]e. Bee [[pollination]] is important both ecologically and [[List of crop plants pollinated by bees|commercially]]; the decline in wild bees has increased the value of pollination by commercially managed hives of honey bees.

Bees range in size from tiny [[stingless bee]] species whose workers are less than {{convert|2|mm|inch|2}} long, to ''[[Megachile pluto]]'', the largest species of [[leafcutter bee]], whose females can attain a length of {{convert|39|mm|inch|2}}. The most common bees in the Northern Hemisphere are the [[Halictidae]], or sweat bees, but they are small and often mistaken for wasps or flies. Vertebrate predators of bees include birds such as [[bee-eater]]s; insect predators include [[beewolf|beewolves]] and [[dragonfly|dragonflies]].

Human [[beekeeping]] or apiculture has been practised for millennia, since at least the times of [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Ancient Greece]]. Apart from honey and pollination, honey bees produce [[beeswax]], [[royal jelly]] and [[propolis]]. Bees have appeared in mythology and folklore, again since ancient times, and they feature in works of literature as varied as [[Beatrix Potter]]'s ''[[The Tale of Mrs Tittlemouse]]'', [[W. B. Yeats]]'s poem ''[[The Lake Isle of Innisfree]]'', and Laline Paull's ''The Bees''. Bee larvae are included in the Javanese dish ''[[botok|botok tawon]]'', where they are eaten steamed with shredded [[coconut]].

== Evolution ==
[[File:Melittosphex burmensis.jpg|thumb|''[[Melittosphex burmensis]]'', a fossil bee preserved in [[amber]] from the [[Early Cretaceous]] of [[Myanmar]]]]

The ancestors of bees were [[wasp]]s in the family [[Crabronidae]], which were [[Predation|predators]] of other insects. The switch from insect prey to pollen may have resulted from the consumption of prey insects which were flower visitors and were partially covered with pollen when they were fed to the wasp larvae. This same [[evolution]]ary scenario may have occurred within the [[vespoidea|vespoid]] wasps, where the [[pollen wasp]]s evolved from predatory ancestors. Until recently, the oldest non-compression bee fossil had been found in New Jersey [[amber]], ''Cretotrigona prisca'' of [[Cretaceous|Cretaceous age]], a [[Apinae|corbiculate bee]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cardinal, Sophie; Danforth, Bryan N. |year=2011 |title=The Antiquity and Evolutionary History of Social Behavior in Bees |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=e21086 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0021086 }}</ref> A bee fossil from the [[early Cretaceous]] (~100 mya), ''[[Melittosphex burmensis]]'', is considered ''"an extinct lineage of pollen-collecting Apoidea [[Cladistics|sister]] to the modern bees"''.<ref name=Poinar>{{cite journal |author=Poinar, G.O.; Danforth, B.N. |title=A fossil bee from Early Cretaceous Burmese amber |journal=Science |volume=314 |issue=5799 |page=614 |year=2006 |url=http://fossilinsects.net/pdfs/Poinar_Danforth_2006_MelittosphexBurmese.pdf |pmid=17068254 |doi=10.1126/science.1134103}}</ref> Derived features of its morphology ([[Synapomorphy|apomorphies]]) place it clearly within the bees, but it retains two unmodified ancestral traits ([[Symplesiomorphy|plesiomorphies]]) of the legs (two mid-tibial spurs, and a slender hind basitarsus), showing its transitional status.<ref name=Poinar/> By the [[Eocene]] (~45 mya) there was already considerable diversity among eusocial bee lineages.<ref name=pnas3054932>{{cite journal|last=Engel|first=Michael S. |year=2001 |title=Monophyly and Extensive Extinction of Advanced Eusocial Bees: Insights from an Unexpected Eocene Diversity|journal=PNAS |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |volume=98 |issue=4 |pages=1661–1664 |doi=10.1073/pnas.041600198 |pmid=11172007 |pmc=29313 |jstor=3054932}}</ref>{{efn|[[Triassic]] nests in a petrified forest in Arizona, implying that bees evolved much earlier,<ref name=Buchmann2012/> are now thought to be beetle borings.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lucas |first1=Spencer G. |last2=Minter |first2=Nicholas J. |last3=Hunt |first3=Adrian P. |title=Re-evaluation of alleged bees' nests from the Upper Triassic of Arizona |journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology |date=February 2010 |volume=286 |issue=3–4| pages=194–201 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018210000118  |doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2010.01.010}}</ref>}}

{{further|coevolution}}

The earliest animal-pollinated flowers were shallow, cup-shaped blooms [[pollination|pollinated]] by insects such as [[beetle]]s, so the syndrome of insect pollination was well established before the first appearance of bees. The novelty is that bees are ''specialized'' as pollination agents, with behavioral and physical modifications that specifically enhance pollination, and are the most efficient pollinating insects. In a process of [[coevolution]], flowers developed longer tubes and bees developed longer tongues to extract the nectar.<ref name=Michener1974/> This drove the [[adaptive radiation]] of the [[Flowering plant|angiosperms]], and, in turn, the bees themselves.<ref name=Buchmann2012>{{cite book |author1=Buchmann, Stephen L. |author2=Nabhan, Gary Paul |title=The Forgotten Pollinators |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YWTZs5fSqb8C&pg=PA41 |year=2012 |publisher=Island Press |isbn=978-1-59726-908-7 |pages=41–42}}</ref>

This cladogram is based on Debevic et al. 2012, which used molecular phylogeny to demonstrate that the bees arose from deep within the Crabronidae, which is therefore paraphyletic. The Heterogynaidae is also broken up.

==Description==
[[File:European Honeybee (Apis mellifera) lapping mouthparts, showing labium and maxillae..jpg|thumb|upright|left|The lapping [[insect mouthparts|mouthparts]] of a honeybee, showing labium and maxillae]]

It is usually easy to recognise that a particular insect is a bee. They differ from closely related groups such as wasps by having branched or plume-like [[seta]]e (bristles), combs on the forelimbs for cleaning their antennae, small anatomical differences in the limb structure and the venation of the hind wings, and in females, by having the seventh dorsal abdominal plate divided into two half-plates.<ref name=Grimaldi>{{cite book |author1=Grimaldi, David |author2=Engel, Michael S. |title=Evolution of the Insects |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ql6Jl6wKb88C&pg=PA454 |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-82149-0 |page=454}}</ref>

Behaviourally, one of the most obvious characteristics of bees is that they collect pollen to provide provisions for their young, and have the necessary adaptations to do this. However, certain wasp species such as [[pollen wasp]]s have similar behaviours, and a few species of bee [[Scavenger|scavenge]] from carcases to feed their offspring.<ref name=Grimaldi/> The world's largest species of bee is thought to be the Indonesian resin bee ''[[Megachile pluto]]'', whose females can attain a length of {{convert|39|mm|inch|2}}.<ref>{{ cite journal | author = Messer, A.

[[File:Carpenter bee head and compound eyes.jpg|thumb|Head-on view of a [[carpenter bee]], showing antennae, three [[ocelli]], [[compound eye]]s, sensory bristles and mouthparts]]
A bee has a pair of large [[Eye#Compound eyes|compound eyes]] which cover much of the surface of the head. Between and above these are three small simple eyes ([[ocelli]]) which provide information for the bee on light intensity. The [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] usually have thirteen segments in males and twelve in females and are [[Insect morphology#Antennae|geniculate]], having an elbow joint part way along. They house large numbers of sense organs that can detect touch (mechanoreceptors), smell and taste, and small, hairlike mechanoreceptors that can detect air movement so as to "hear" sounds. The [[insect mouthparts|mouthparts]] are adapted for both chewing and sucking by having both a pair of [[Mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandibles]] and a long [[proboscis]] for sucking up nectar.<ref name=Extension>{{cite web |url=http://www.extension.org/pages/21754/anatomy-of-the-honey-bee |title=Anatomy of the Honey Bee |date=19 June 2014 |publisher=Extension |accessdate=30 June 2015}}</ref>

The thorax has three segments, each with a pair of robust legs, and a pair of membranous wings on the hind two segments. The front legs of corbiculate bees bear combs for cleaning the antennae, and in many species the hind legs bear pollen baskets, flattened sections with incurving hairs to secure the collected pollen. The wings are synchronised in flight and the somewhat smaller hind wings connect to the forewings by a row of hooks along their margin which connect to a groove in the forewing. The abdomen has nine segments, the hindermost three being modified into the sting.<ref name=Extension/>

==Sociality==

===Haplodiploid breeding system===
{{further|haplodiploidy|eusociality}}
[[File:Wasp attack.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3<!--size for low image-->|Willing to die for their sisters: worker honey bees killed defending their hive against [[wasp]]s, along with a dead wasp. Such [[eusocial]] behaviour is favoured by the [[haplodiploid]] [[Sex-determination system|sex determination]] system of bees.]]

According to [[inclusive fitness]] theory, organisms can gain fitness not just through increasing their own reproductive output, but also that of close relatives. In evolutionary terms, individuals should help relatives when ''Cost < Relatedness * Benefit''. The requirements for eusociality are more easily fulfilled by [[haplodiploid]] species such as bees because of their unusual relatedness structure.<ref name=Hughes2008>{{Cite journal | last1 = Hughes | first1 = W.

In haplodiploid species, females develop from fertilized eggs and males from unfertilized eggs. Because a male is [[haploid]] (has only one copy of each gene), his daughters (which are [[diploid]], with two copies of each gene) share 100% of his genes and 50% of their mother's. Therefore, they share 75% of their genes with each other. This mechanism of sex determination gives rise to what [[W. D. Hamilton]] termed "supersisters", more closely related to their sisters than they would be to their own offspring.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Hamilton | first=W.

This unusual situation has been proposed as an explanation of the multiple independent evolutions of eusociality (arising at least nine separate times) within the Hymenoptera.<ref name=Hughes/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Gullan |first1=P.

However, some eusocial species such as [[termites]] are not haplodiploid. Conversely, many bees are haplodiploid yet are not eusocial, and among eusocial species many queens mate with multiple males, creating half-sisters that share only 25% of their genes.<ref name=NTW>{{cite journal | last=Nowak | first=Martin | author2=Tarnita, Corina | author3=Wilson, E.O. | title=The evolution of eusociality | journal=Nature | year=2010 | volume=466 | pmid=20740005 | issue=7310 | pages=1057–1062 | doi=10.1038/nature09205 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v466/n7310/full/nature09205.html | pmc=3279739}}</ref> Haplodiploidy is thus neither necessary nor sufficient for eusociality.

===Eusociality===

{{further|eusociality|honey bee|bumblebee}}

Bees may be solitary or may live in various types of communities. The most advanced of these are [[Eusociality|eusocial]] colonies found among the honey bees, bumblebees, and stingless bees; these are characterised by having cooperative brood care and a division of labour into reproductive and non-reproductive adults. Sociality, of several different types, is believed to have evolved separately many times within the bees. In some species, groups of cohabiting females may be sisters, and if there is a [[division of labour]] within the group, they are considered [[semisocial]]. The group is called eusocial if, in addition, the group consists of a mother (the [[Queen bee|queen]]) and her daughters ([[Worker bee|workers]]), with male [[drone (bee)|drones]] at certain stages. When the castes are purely behavioural alternatives, the system is considered primitively eusocial as in many [[paper wasp]]s; when the castes are morphologically discrete, the system is considered highly eusocial.<ref name=Michener1974>{{cite book|author=Michener, Charles Duncan |title=The Social Behavior of the Bees: A Comparative Study |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aordrL_D-30C&pg=PA78 |year=1974 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-81175-1 |pages=22–78}}</ref>

There are many more species of primitively eusocial than highly eusocial bees, but they have rarely been studied. Most are in the family [[Halictidae]], or "sweat bees". Colonies are typically small, with a dozen or fewer workers, on average. Queens and workers differ only in size, if at all. Most species have a single season colony cycle, even in the tropics, and only mated females hibernate. A few species have long active seasons and attain colony sizes in the hundreds. The [[orchid bee]]s include some primitively eusocial species with similar biology. Some [[Allodapini|allodapine]] bees are primitively eusocial colonies, with [[progressive provisioning]]: a larva's food is supplied gradually as it develops, as is the case in honey bees and some bumblebees.<ref>{{cite book |author=Michener, Charles Duncan |title=The Social Behavior of the Bees: A Comparative Study |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aordrL_D-30C&pg=PA308 |year=1974 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-81175-1 |page=308}}</ref>

[[File:Bumblebee 05.JPG|thumb|left|A [[bumblebee]] carrying pollen in its [[pollen basket]]s (corbiculae)]]
[[Bumblebee]]s are eusocial, like the eusocial [[Vespidae]] such as [[hornet]]s. The queen initiates a nest on her own. Bumblebee colonies typically have from 50 to 200 bees at peak population, which occurs in mid to late summer. Nest architecture is simple, limited by the size of the pre-existing nest cavity, and colonies rarely last more than a year.<ref name=BBCT-nest>{{cite web | title=Bumblebee nests | url=http://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-bees/habitats/bumblebee-nests/ | publisher=Bumblebee Conservation Trust | accessdate=26 June 2015}}</ref>  In 2011, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] set up the Bumblebee Specialist Group to review the threat status of all bumblebee species world-wide using the [[IUCN Red List]] criteria.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/bumblebee_sg_proofed.pdf | title=Bumblebee Specialist Group: 2011 Update | publisher=IUCN |accessdate=7 October 2012}}</ref>

[[Stingless bee]]s are highly [[eusocial]]. They practise mass provisioning, with complex nest architecture and perennial colonies.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Roubik | first1=D.W. | year=2006 | title=Stingless bee nesting biology | journal=Apidologie | volume=37 | issue=2 | pages=124–143 | doi=10.1051/apido:2006026}}</ref>

The true honey bees (genus ''[[Apis (genus)|Apis]]'') are highly eusocial, and are among the best known of all insects. There are 29 subspecies of ''[[Apis mellifera]]'', native to Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. [[Africanized bee]]s are a hybrid strain of ''A. mellifera'' that escaped from experiments involving crossing European and African subspecies; they are unusually defensive.<ref>{{cite web | last1=Sanford | first1=Malcolm T. | title=The Africanized Honey Bee in the Americas: A Biological Revolution with Human Cultural Implications | url=http://apisenterprises.com/papers_htm/Misc/AHB%20in%20the%20Americas.htm | publisher=Apis Enterprises | accessdate=29 March 2015 |year=2006}}</ref>

===Solitary and communal bees===
[[File:Megachile rotundata.JPG|thumb|A leafcutting bee, ''[[Megachile rotundata]]'' cutting circles from acacia leaves]]

Most other bees, including familiar insects such as [[carpenter bee]]s, [[leafcutter bees]] and [[mason bees]] are solitary in the sense that every female is fertile, and typically inhabits a nest she constructs herself. There are no ''worker'' bees for these species. Solitary bees typically produce neither honey nor [[beeswax]].<ref name=Paetzel>{{cite book|author=Paetzel, Mary|title=Solitary Wasps and Bees: Their Hidden World in the Siskiyou Mountains |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=V4gyAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA98 |year=2010 |publisher=Lulu.com |isbn=978-0-557-36970-6 |pages=98–99}}</ref>

Solitary bees are important pollinators; they gather pollen to provision their nests with food for their brood. Often it is mixed with nectar to form a paste-like consistency. Some solitary bees have advanced types of pollen-carrying structures on their bodies. A very few species of solitary bees are being cultured for commercial pollination. Most of these species belong to a distinct set of [[genus|genera]], namely: carpenter bees, [[Halictidae|sweat bees]], mason bees, [[Colletes inaequalis|polyester bees]], [[squash bee]]s, [[Ceratina|dwarf carpenter bees]], leafcutter bees, [[alkali bee]]s and [[Anthophorini|digger bees]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beesource.com/resources/usda/management-of-wild-bees/ |author=Parker, Frank D.; Torchio, Philip F. |title=Management of Wild Bees |publisher=Beesource Beekeeping Community |date=1 October 1980 |accessdate=26 June 2015}}</ref>

[[File:Anthidium February 2008-1.jpg|left|thumb|A solitary bee, ''[[Anthidium florentinum]]'' (family [[Megachilidae]]), visiting ''[[Lantana]]'']]

Solitary bees are often [[oligolege]]s, in that they only gather pollen from one or a few species or genera of closely related plants (unlike honey bees and bumblebees which are generalists).<ref name=Waser2006>{{cite book|author=Waser, Nickolas M.|title=Plant-Pollinator Interactions: From Specialization to Generalization |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Fbl5c9fUxTIC&pg=PA110 |year=2006 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-87400-5 |pages=110–}}</ref> Specialist pollinators also include bee species which gather floral oils instead of pollen, and male orchid bees, which gather aromatic compounds from [[orchid]]s (one of the few cases where male bees are effective pollinators). The bees are often drawn to their specialist flower by the odour of the pollen defence chemicals created by the plant.<ref name=Dafni>{{cite book|author1=Dafni, Amots |author2=Hesse, Michael |author3=Pacini, Ettore|title=Pollen and Pollination |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-M7yCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA80 |year=2012 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |isbn=978-3-7091-6306-1 |pages=80}}</ref> In a very few cases only one species of bee can effectively pollinate a single [[plant]] species, and some plants are [[endangered species|endangered]] at least in part because their pollinator is also threatened. There is, however, a pronounced tendency for oligolectic bees to be associated with common, widespread plants which are visited by multiple pollinators. There are some forty oligoleges associated with the [[Larrea tridentata|creosote bush]] in the arid parts of the United States southwest, for example.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hurd, P.D. Jr., Linsley, E.G. |year=1975 |title=The principal ''Larrea'' bees of the southwestern United States |journal=Smithsonian Contributions to Zoology |volume=193 |pages=1–74 |doi=10.5479/si.00810282.193 |issue=193}}</ref>

Solitary bees create nests in hollow [[Phragmites|reeds]] or twigs, holes in [[wood]], or, most commonly, in tunnels in the ground. The female typically creates a compartment (a "cell") with an egg and some provisions for the resulting larva, then seals it off. A nest may consist of numerous cells. When the nest is in wood, usually the last (those closer to the entrance) contain eggs that will become males. The adult does not provide care for the brood once the egg is laid, and usually dies after making one or more nests. The males typically emerge first and are ready for mating when the females emerge. Solitary bees are either stingless or very unlikely to sting (only in self-defense, if ever).<ref>{{cite web |title=Solitary Bees (Hymenoptera) |url=http://www.royensoc.co.uk/insect_info/what/solitary_bees.htm |publisher=Royal Entomological Society |accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Other bees |url=http://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-bees/identification/other-bees/ |publisher=Bumblebee Conservation Trust |accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref>

While solitary females each make individual nests, some species. such as the European mason bee ''[[Hoplitis anthocopoides]]'', are gregarious, preferring to make nests near others of the same species, and giving the appearance of being social. Large groups of solitary bee nests are called ''aggregations'', to distinguish them from [[colony (biology)|colonies]]. In some species, multiple females share a common nest, but each makes and provisions her own cells independently. This type of group is called "communal" and is not uncommon. The primary advantage appears to be that a nest entrance is easier to defend from predators and parasites when there are multiple females using that same entrance on a regular basis.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Eickwort |first1=George C. |title=Gregarious Nesting of the Mason Bee Hoplitis anthocopoides and the Evolution of Parasitism and Sociality Among Megachilid Bees |journal=Evolution |date=1975 |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=142 |doi=10.2307/2407147}}</ref>

===Life cycle===
{{further|honey bee life cycle}}
[[File:Carpenter Bee Galleries.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Carpenter bee]] nests in a cedar wood beam (sawn open)]]

The life cycle of a bee, be it a solitary or social species, involves the laying of an egg, the development through several moults of a legless [[larva]], a [[pupa]]tion stage during which the insect undergoes [[Holometabolism|complete metamorphosis]], followed by the emergence of a winged adult. Most solitary bees and bumble bees in temperate climates overwinter as adults or pupae and emerge in spring when increasing numbers of flowering plants come into bloom. The males usually emerge first and search for females with which to mate. The sex of a bee is determined by whether or not the egg is fertilised; after mating, a female stores the sperm, and determines which sex is required at the time each individual egg is laid, fertilised eggs producing female offspring and unfertilised eggs, males. Tropical bees may have several generations in a year and no [[diapause]] stage.<ref name=Roubik1992>{{cite book|author=Roubik, David W.|title=Ecology and Natural History of Tropical Bees |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ljlaYMeI6noC |year=1992 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42909-2 |page=15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The bumblebee lifecycle|url=http://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-bees/lifecycle/ |publisher=Bumblebee Conservation Trust |accessdate=1 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Learning About Honey Bees |url=http://www.scmidstatebeekeepers.org/honeybeelifecycle.htm |publisher=The South Carolina Mid-State Beekeepers Association |accessdate=1 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Solitary Bees |url=http://www.nationalbeeunit.com/downloadDocument.cfm?id=901 |publisher=National Bee Unit |accessdate=1 July 2015}}</ref>

[[File:Bienen mit Brut 2.jpg|thumb|Honeybees on [[brood comb]] with eggs and [[larvae]] in cells]]
The egg is generally oblong, slightly curved and tapering at one end. In the case of solitary bees, each one is laid in a cell with a supply of mixed pollen and nectar next to it. This may be rolled into a pellet or placed in a pile and is known as mass provisioning. In social species of bee there is progressive provisioning with the larva being fed regularly while it grows. The nest varies from a hole in the ground or in wood, in solitary bees, to a substantial structure with wax combs in bumblebees and honey bees.<ref name=Shuckard>{{cite book |author=Shuckard, William Edward |title=British bees: an introduction to the study of the natural history and economy of the bees indigenous to the British Isles |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sReIAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA18 |year=1866 |publisher=L. Reeve & Co. |pages=18–23}}</ref>

The larvae are generally whitish grubs, roughly oval and bluntly-pointed at both ends. They have fifteen segments and spiracles in each segment for breathing. They have no legs but are able to move within the confines of the cell, helped by tubercles on their sides. They have short horns on the head, jaws for chewing their food and an appendage on either side of the mouth tipped with a bristle. There is a gland under the mouth that secretes a viscous liquid which solidifies into the silk they use to produce their cocoons. The pupa can be seen through the semi-transparent cocoon and over the course of a few days, the insect undergoes metamorphosis into the form of the adult bee. When ready to emerge, it splits its skin dorsally and climbs out of the [[exuvia]]e as a winged adult and breaks out of the cell.<ref name=Shuckard/>

===Flight===
[[File:Apis mellifera flying.jpg|thumb|Honeybee in flight carrying pollen in [[pollen basket]]]]
{{further|insect flight|bumblebee}}

In [[Antoine Magnan]]'s 1934 book ''Le vol des insectes'', he wrote that he and [[André Sainte-Laguë]] had applied the equations of [[air resistance]] to [[insect]]s and found that their flight could not be explained by fixed-wing calculations, but that "One shouldn't be surprised that the results of the calculations don't square with reality".<ref>Ingram, Jay (2001) ''The Barmaid's Brain'', Aurum Press, pp. 91–92, ISBN 0716741202.</ref> This has led to a common misconception that bees "violate aerodynamic theory", but in fact it merely confirms that bees do not engage in fixed-wing flight, and that their flight is explained by other mechanics, such as those used by [[helicopter]]s.<ref>{{cite web|author=Adams, Cecil |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1076/is-it-aerodynamically-impossible-for-bumblebees-to-fly |title=Is it aerodynamically impossible for bumblebees to fly? |publisher=The Straight Dope |date=4 May 1990 |accessdate=7 March 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090303140245/http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1076/is-it-aerodynamically-impossible-for-bumblebees-to-fly| archivedate= 3 March 2009 | deadurl= no}}</ref> In 1996 it was shown that vortices created by many insects' wings helped to provide lift.<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/dn8382-secrets-of-bee-flight-revealed.html Secrets of bee flight revealed], Phillips, Helen. 28 November 2005.

Wing-beat frequency normally increases as size decreases, but as the bee's wing beat covers such a small [[arc (geometry)|arc]], it flaps approximately 230 times per second, faster than a [[Drosophilidae|fruitfly]] (200 times per second) which is 80 times smaller.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Altshuler, Douglas L.; Dickson, William B.; Vance, Jason T.; Roberts, Stephen P.; Dickinson, Michael H. |title=Short-amplitude high-frequency wing strokes determine the aerodynamics of honeybee flight |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=102 |issue=50 |pages=18213–18218 |year=2005 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0506590102 |pmid=16330767 |pmc=1312389}}</ref>

The ethologist [[Karl von Frisch]] studied [[animal navigation|navigation]] in the honey bee.

He demonstrated that bees can recognize a desired compass direction in three different ways: by the sun, by the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] pattern of the blue sky, and by the earth’s magnetic field. He showed that the sun is the preferred or main compass; the other mechanisms are used under cloudy skies or inside a dark [[beehive]].<ref name=vonFrisch93>{{cite book |last=von Frisch |first=Karl |title=The Dancing Bees |year=1953 |publisher=Harcourt, Brace & World | pages=93–96}}</ref> Bees navigate using spatial memory with a "rich, map-like organization".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Menzel, Randolf; Greggers, Uwe; Smith, Alan;  Berger, Sandra; Brandt, Robert; Brunke, Sascha; Bundrock, Gesine; Hülse, Sandra; Plümpe, Tobias; Schaupp, Schaupp; Schüttler, Elke; Stach, Silke; Stindt, Jan; Stollhoff, Nicola; Watzl, Sebastian |title=Honey bees Navigate According to a Map-Like Spatial Memory |journal=PNAS |year=2005 |volume=102 |issue=8 |pages=3040–3045 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0408550102}}</ref>

Many bees are [[aposematic]]ally coloured, typically orange and black, warning of their ability to defend themselves with a powerful sting. As such they are models for [[Batesian mimicry]] by non-stinging insects such as [[bee-flies]], [[robber flies]] and [[hoverflies]],<ref name="ThorpHorning1983">{{cite book |last1=Thorp |first1=Robbin W.|last2=Horning |first2=Donald S. |last3=Dunning |first3=Lorry L. |title=Bumble Bees and Cuckoo Bumble Bees of California (Hymenoptera, Apidae) |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=v1eJ3fWwshIC&pg=PA9 |year=1983 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-09645-5 |page=9 | quote=Of the forms of mimicry, two relate to [[Bombini]].

Bees are themselves [[Müllerian mimicry|Müllerian mimics]] of other aposematic insects with the same colour scheme, including [[wasp]]s, [[Lycidae|lycid]] and other beetles, and many butterflies and moths ([[Lepidoptera]]) which are themselves distasteful, often through acquiring bitter and poisonous chemicals from their plant food.

Bees are also mimicked by plants such as the [[Ophrys apifera|bee orchid]] which imitates both the appearance and the scent of a female bee; male bees attempt to mate ([[pseudocopulation]]) with the furry lip of the flower, thus pollinating it.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bee Orchids and Insect Mimicry |url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/life/plants-fungi/bee-orchids/ |publisher=Natural History Museum |accessdate=1 July 2015}}</ref>

===Nocturnal bees ===
Four bee families ([[Andrenidae]], [[Colletidae]], [[Halictidae]], and [[Apidae]]) contain some species that are [[crepuscular]]. Most are tropical or subtropical, but there are some which live in arid regions at higher latitudes. These bees have greatly enlarged [[ocellus|ocelli]], which are extremely sensitive to light and dark, though incapable of forming images. Some have refracting superposition compound eyes: these combine the output of many elements of their compound eyes to provide enough light for each retinal photoreceptor. Their ability to fly by night enables them to avoid many predators, and to exploit flowers that produce nectar only or also at night.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Warrant |first1=Eric J. |title=Seeing in the dark: vision and visual behaviour in nocturnal bees and wasps |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |date=June 2008 |volume=211 |pages=1737–1746 |doi=10.1242/jeb.015396 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/211/11/1737.full}}</ref>

===In mythology and folklore===
{{main|bee (mythology)}}
[[File:Plaque bee-goddess BM GR1860.4-123.4.jpg|thumb|Gold plaques embossed with winged bee goddesses. Camiros, [[Rhodes]]. 7th century B.C.]]

Three bee maidens with the power of [[divination]] and thus speaking truth are described in [[Homer]]'s ''Hymn to Hermes'', and the food of the gods is "identified as honey"; the bee maidens were originally associated with [[Apollo]], and are probably not correctly identified with the [[Thriae]]. Honey, according to a Greek myth, was discovered by a nymph called Melissa ("Bee"); and honey was offered to the Greek gods from [[Helladic period|Mycenean times]]. Bees were associated, too, with the [[Delphic oracle]] and the prophetess was sometimes called a bee.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Scheinberg, Susan | year=1979 | title=The Bee Maidens of the Homeric Hymn to Hermes | journal=Harvard Studies in Classical Philology | volume=83 | pages=1–28 | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/311093}}</ref>

The image of a community of honey bees has been used from ancient to modern times, in [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]; in [[Virgil]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]; in [[Erasmus]] and [[Shakespeare]]; [[Tolstoy]], and by political and social theorists such as [[Bernard Mandeville]] and [[Karl Marx]] as a model for human [[society]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Bee |year=2004 |title=The Hive: the Story of the Honeybee |location=London |publisher=[[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] |isbn=0-7195-6598-7}}</ref> In English folklore, bees would be told of important events in the household, in a custom known as "[[Telling the bees]]".<ref name="Roud2006">{{cite book |author=Steve Roud |title=The Penguin Guide to the Superstitions of Britain and Ireland |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1Mc4qPiICvcC&pg=PT128 |date=6 April 2006 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-194162-2 |pages=128}}</ref>

[[Beatrix Potter]]'s illustrated book ''[[The Tale of Mrs Tittlemouse]]'' (1910) features Babbity Bumble and her brood ''(pictured)''.

[[W. B. Yeats]]'s poem ''[[The Lake Isle of Innisfree]]'' (1888) contains the couplet "Nine bean rows will I have there, a hive for the honey bee, / And live alone in the bee loud glade." At the time he was living in [[Bedford Park, London|Bedford Park]] in the West of London.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Deering |first1=Chris |title=Yeats in Bedford Park |url=http://www.chiswickw4.com/default.asp?section=info&page=conyeats.htm |publisher=ChiswickW4.com |accessdate=28 June 2015}}</ref>

[[Sue Monk Kidd]]'s ''[[The Secret Life of Bees]]'' (2004), and the 2009 film starring [[Dakota Fanning]],  tells the story of a girl who escapes her abusive home and finds her way to live with a family of beekeepers, the Boatwrights.

[[Dave Goulson]]'s ''[[A Sting in the Tale]]'' (2014) describes his efforts to save bumblebees in Britain, as well as much about their biology.

The playwright Laline Paull's [[fantasy]] ''The Bees'' (2015) tells the tale of a hive bee named Flora 717 from hatching onwards.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jones |first1=Gwyneth |title=The Bees by Laline Paull review – a fantasy with a sting in its tail |url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/21/bees-laline-paull-fantasy-novel-review |work=The Guardian |accessdate=28 June 2015}}</ref>

The humorous 2007 animated film ''[[Bee Movie]]'' used [[Jerry Seinfeld]]'s first script and was his first work for children; he starred as a bee named Barry B. Benson, alongside [[Renée Zellweger]].

===Beekeeping===
{{main|Beekeeping}}
[[Image:Beekeeper.jpg|thumb|right|A commercial beekeeper at work]]

Humans have kept [[honey bee]] colonies, commonly in [[beehive|hives]], for millennia. [[Beekeeper]]s collect  [[honey]], [[beeswax]], [[propolis]], [[pollen]], and [[royal jelly]] from hives; bees are also kept to [[pollination|pollinate]] crops and to produce bees for sale to other beekeepers.

Depictions of humans collecting honey from wild bees date to 15,000 years ago; efforts to domesticate them are shown in Egyptian art around 4,500 years ago.<ref>[http://reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/timelines/topics/beekeeping.htm Beekeeping in Ancient Egypt]</ref> Simple hives and smoke were used;<ref>[http://www.agropolis.fr/pdf/rencontres-apiculture-2008/pays/Egypte.pdf Apiculture in Egypt, Dr Tarek Issa Abd El-Wahab]</ref><ref>[http://beelore.com/2008/02/23/beekeeping-in-ancient-egypt/ Beekeeping in Ancient Egypt]</ref><ref name="Bodenheimer1960">{{Cite book | title = Animal and Man in Bible Lands | first = F.

{{main|List of crop plants pollinated by bees|Pollinator decline}}
[[File:Peponapis pruinosaCane-12.JPG|thumb|right|[[Squash bee]]s are important pollinators of [[Cucurbita|squashes]] and [[cucumber]]s.]]

Bees play an important role in [[pollination|pollinating]] [[flowering plant]]s, and are the major type of [[pollinator]] in many [[ecosystem]]s that contain flowering plants. It is estimated that one third of the human food supply depends on [[pollination]] by insects, birds and bats, most of which is accomplished by bees, especially the domesticated [[European honey bee]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Yang |first1=Sarah |title=Pollinators help one-third of world's crop production, says new study |url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2006/10/25_pollinator.shtml |publisher=UC Berkeley |accessdate=29 June 2015 |date=25 October 2006}}</ref>

Honey is a natural product produced by bees and stored for their own use, but its sweetness has always appealed to humans. Before domestication of bees was even attempted, humans were raiding their nests for their honey. Smoke was often used to subdue the bees and such activities are depicted in [[Cave painting|rock paintings]] in Spain which have been dated to 15,000 BC.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kt9DIY1g9HYC&pg=PA1074 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |isbn=978-1-4020-4559-2 |page=1074}}</ref> Indigenous people in many countries eat insects, including consuming the larvae and pupae of bees, mostly stingless bees.
