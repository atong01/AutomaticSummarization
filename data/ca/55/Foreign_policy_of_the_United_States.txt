{{Politics of the United States}}
The '''foreign policy of the United States''' is the way in which it interacts with foreign nations and sets standards of interaction for its organizations, corporations and individual citizens.

The officially stated goals of the foreign policy of the United States, including all the Bureaus and Offices in the [[United States Department of State]],<ref>http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/rls/dos/1718.htm</ref> as mentioned in the ''Foreign Policy Agenda'' of the Department of State, are "to build and sustain a more democratic, secure, and prosperous world for the benefit of the American people and the international community."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/s/d/rm/index.htm#mission|title=Bureau of Budget and Planning|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref> In addition, the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs]] states as some of its jurisdictional goals: "export controls, including nonproliferation of nuclear technology and nuclear hardware; measures to foster commercial interaction with foreign nations and to safeguard American business abroad; international commodity agreements; international education; and protection of American citizens abroad and expatriation."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalrelations.house.gov/about.asp?nav=jurisdiction|title=About the Committee|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref> US foreign policy and [[United States foreign aid|foreign aid]] have been the subject of much debate, praise and [[Criticism of the United States government|criticism]], both domestically and abroad.

==Powers of the President and Congress==
[[File:Foreign policy US government structure.png|thumb|right|400px|The US Constitution gives much of the foreign policy decision-making to the presidency, but the Senate has a role in ratifying treaties, and the Supreme Court interprets treaties when cases are presented to it.]]
{{Main|Treaty Clause|War Powers Clause|Appointments Clause|Commerce Clause|l4=Foreign Commerce Clause}}

Subject to the advice and consent role of the [[U.S. Senate]], the [[President of the United States]] negotiates treaties with foreign nations, but treaties enter into force if ratified by two-thirds of the Senate. The President is also [[Commander in Chief]] of the [[United States Armed Forces]], and as such has broad authority over the armed forces; however only Congress has authority to declare war,  and the civilian and military budget is written by the Congress. The [[United States Secretary of State]] is the [[foreign minister]] of the United States and is the primary conductor of state-to-state diplomacy. Both the Secretary of State and ambassadors are appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate. Congress also has power to regulate commerce with foreign nations.<ref>James M. McCormick, ''American Foreign Policy and Process'' (2009)  ch 7-8</ref>

==Historical overview==
{{Main|History of U.S. foreign policy|Timeline of United States diplomatic history}}

[[File:Jay-treaty.jpg|thumb|220px|The [[Jay Treaty]] of 1795 aligned the U.S. more with Britain and less with France, leading to political polarization at home]]

The main trend regarding the history of U.S. foreign policy since the American Revolution is the shift from [[non-interventionism]] before and after [[World War I]], to its growth as a world power and global [[hegemony]] during and since World War II and the end of the [[Cold War]] in the 20th century.<ref>George C. Herring, ''From Colony to Superpower: U.S. Foreign Relations Since 1776'' (2008)</ref> Since the 19th century, US foreign policy also has been characterized by a shift from the [[Political realism|realist school]] to the idealistic or [[Wilsonian]] school of international relations.<ref>Richard Russell, "American Diplomatic Realism: A Tradition Practised and Preached by George F. Kennan," ''Diplomacy and Statecraft'', Nov 2000, Vol. 11 Issue 3, pp&nbsp;159–83</ref>

Foreign policy themes were expressed considerably in [[George Washington]]'s [[George Washington's Farewell Address|farewell address]]; these included among other things, observing good faith and justice towards all nations and cultivating peace and harmony with all, excluding both "inveterate antipathies against particular nations, and passionate attachments for others", "steer[ing] clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world", and advocating trade with all nations. These policies became the basis of the [[Federalist Party]] in the 1790s. But the rival [[Jeffersonian Democracy|Jeffersonians]] feared Britain and favored France in the 1790s, declaring the [[War of 1812]] on Britain. After the 1778 alliance with France, the U.S. did not sign another permanent treaty until the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] in 1949. Over time, other themes, key goals, attitudes, or stances have been variously expressed by [[United States Presidential doctrines|Presidential 'doctrines']], named for them. Initially these were uncommon events, but since WWII, these have been made by most presidents.

In general, the United States followed an [[isolationist]] foreign policy until attacks against U.S. shipping by [[Barbary corsairs]] spurred the country into developing a naval force projection capability, resulting in the [[First Barbary War]] in 1801.<ref>{{cite web|last=Oren|first=Michael B.|title=The Middle East and the Making of the United States, 1776 to 1815|date=2005-11-03|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/05/11/michaelOren.html}}</ref>

Despite occasional entanglements with European Powers such as the [[War of 1812]] and the 1898 [[Spanish–American War]], U.S. foreign policy was marked by steady expansion of its foreign trade and scope during the 19th century, and it maintained its policy of avoiding wars with and between European powers. Concerning its domestic borders, the 1803 [[Louisiana Purchase]] doubled the nation's geographical area; Spain ceded the territory of [[Florida]] in 1819; annexation brought Texas in 1845; a war with Mexico in 1848 added California, Arizona and New Mexico. The U.S. bought [[Alaska Purchase|Alaska]] from the Russian Empire in 1867, and it annexed the Republic of Hawaii in 1898. Victory over Spain in 1898 brought the [[Philippines]], and [[Puerto Rico]], as well as oversight of Cuba. The short experiment in imperialism ended by 1908, as the U.S. turned its attention to the Panama Canal and the stabilization of regions to its south, including Mexico.

===20th century===

====World War I====
The 20th century was marked by two world wars in which the United States, along with allied powers, defeated its enemies and increased its international reputation. President [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]] was developed from his idealistic [[Wilsonianism]] program of spreading democracy and fighting militarism so as to end wars. It became the basis of the German Armistice (really a surrender) and the 1919 [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]. The resulting [[Treaty of Versailles]], due to European allies' punitive and territorial designs, showed insufficient conformity with these points and the U.S. signed separate treaties with each of its adversaries; due to Senate objections also, the U.S. never joined the [[League of Nations]], which was established as a result of Wilson's initiative. In the 1920s, the United States followed an independent course, and succeeded in a program of [[Washington Naval Conference|naval disarmament]], and [[Dawes Plan|refunding the German economy]]. New York became the financial capital of the world, but the downside was that the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] hurled the entire world into the [[Great Depression]]. American trade policy relied on high tariffs under the Republicans, and reciprocal trade agreements under the Democrats, but in any case exports were at very low levels in the 1930s.

====World War II====
{{main|Diplomatic history of World War II#United States}}
[[File:Yalta Conference cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Allies of World War II]] at the [[Yalta Conference]]: [[Winston Churchill]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Joseph Stalin]].]]
The United States adopted a non-interventionist foreign policy from 1932 to 1938, but then President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] moved toward strong support of the Allies in their wars against Germany and Japan. As a result of intense internal debate, the national policy was one of becoming the [[Arsenal of Democracy]], that is financing and equipping the Allied armies without sending American combat soldiers. Roosevelt mentioned four fundamental freedoms, which ought to be enjoyed by people "everywhere in the world"; these included the freedom of speech and religion, as well as freedom from want and fear. Roosevelt helped establish terms for a post-war world among potential allies at the [[Atlantic Charter|Atlantic Conference]]; [[Atlantic Charter#Content and analysis|specific points]] were included to correct earlier failures, which became a step toward the [[United Nations]]. American policy was to threaten Japan, to force it out of China, and to prevent its attacking the Soviet Union. However, Japan reacted by an attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, and the United States was at war with Japan, Germany, and Italy. Instead of the loans given to allies in World War I, the United States provided Lend-Lease grants of $50,000,000,000. Working closely with [[Winston Churchill]] of Britain, and Joseph Stalin of the Soviet Union, Roosevelt sent his forces into the Pacific against Japan, then into North Africa against Italy and Germany, and finally into Europe starting with France and Italy in 1944 against the Germans. The American economy roared forward, doubling industrial production, and building vast quantities of airplanes, ships, tanks, munitions, and, finally, the atomic bomb. Much of the American war effort went to strategic bombers, which flattened the cities of Japan and Germany.

====Cold War====
{{main|History of the Cold War}}
[[File:President Nixon meets with China's Communist Party Leader, Mao Tse- Tung, 02-29-1972 - NARA - 194759.tif|thumb|Chinese Communist Party Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] meets with U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]], 1972]]
After the war, the U.S. rose to become the dominant non-colonial economic power with broad influence in much of the world, with the key policies of the [[Marshall Plan]] and the [[Truman Doctrine]]. Almost immediately however, the world witnessed division into broad two camps during the [[Cold War]]; one side was led by the U.S., and the other by the Soviet Union, but this situation also led to the establishment of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. This period lasted until almost the end of the 20th century, and is thought to be both an ideological and power struggle between the two superpowers. A policy of [[containment]] was adopted to limit Soviet expansion, and a series of proxy wars were fought with mixed results. In 1991, the Soviet Union dissolved into separate nations, and the Cold War formally ended as the United States gave separate diplomatic recognition to the Russian Federation and other former Soviet states. With these changes to forty-five years of established diplomacy and military confrontation, new challenges confronted U.S. policymakers. American foreign policy is characterized by the protection of its national interests.

===21st century===
In the 21st century, U.S. influence remains strong but, in relative terms, is declining in terms of economic output compared to rising nations such as China, India, Russia, Brazil, and the newly consolidated [[European Union]]. Substantial problems remain, such as [[climate change]], [[nuclear proliferation]], and the specter of [[nuclear terrorism]]. Foreign policy analysts Hachigian and Sutphen in their book ''The Next American Century'' suggest all six powers have similar vested interests in stability and terrorism prevention and trade; if they can find common ground, then the next decades may be marked by peaceful growth and prosperity.<ref name=tws13jans3w2>{{cite news|author=Nikolas K. Gvosdev |title=FDR's Children |quote=Hachigian&nbsp;... and Sutphen&nbsp;... recognize that the global balance of power is changing; that despite America's continued predominance, the other pivotal powers "do challenge American dominance and impinge on the freedom of action the U.S. has come to enjoy and expect." Rather than focusing on the negatives, however, they believe that these six powers have the same vested interests: All are dependent on the free flow of goods around the world and all require global stability in order to ensure continued economic growth (and the prosperity it engenders). |work=National Interest |date=2008-01-02 |url=http://nationalinterest.org/bookreview/fdrs-children-1931 |accessdate=2010-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100826001356/http://nationalinterest.org:80/bookreview/fdrs-children-1931 |archivedate=26 August 2010 }}</ref>

==Law==
{{Main|Treaty|Treaty Clause}}
In the United States, there are three types of treaty-related law:
* '''[[Executive agreement]]s'''
** '''Congressional-executive agreements''' are made by the [[President of the United States|president]] and [[United States Congress|Congress]]. A majority of both houses makes it binding much like regular legislation after it is signed by the president. The constitution does not expressly state that these agreements are allowed, and constitutional scholars such as [[Laurence Tribe]] think they are unconstitutional.<ref>Laurence H. Tribe, "Taking Text and Structure Seriously: Reflections on Free-Form Method in Constitutional Interpretation," 108 Harv. L. Rev.
1221, 1227 (1995).</ref>  However, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] has upheld their validity.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}
** '''Sole executive agreements''' are made by the [[President of the United States|president]] alone.
* '''Treaties''' are formal written agreements specified by the [[Treaty Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. The president makes a treaty with foreign powers, but then the proposed treaty must be ratified by a two-thirds vote in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. For example, President [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]] proposed the [[Treaty of Versailles]] after World War I after consulting with allied powers, but this treaty was rejected by the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]; as a result, the U.S. subsequently made separate agreements with different nations. While most international law has a broader interpretation of the term ''[[treaty]]'', the U.S. sense of the term is more restricted. In ''[[Missouri v. Holland]]'', the Supreme Court ruled that the power to make treaties under the U.S. Constitution is a power separate from the other enumerated powers of the federal government, and hence the federal government can use treaties to legislate in areas which would otherwise fall within the exclusive authority of the states.

International law in most nations considers all three of the above agreements as ''[[Treaty|treaties]]''. In most nations, treaty laws supersede domestic law. So if there is a conflict between a treaty obligation and a domestic law, then the treaty usually prevails.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In contrast to most other nations, the United States considers the three types of agreements as distinct. Further, the United States incorporates treaty law into the body of U.S. federal law. As a result, [[United States Congress|Congress]] can modify or repeal treaties afterwards. It can overrule an agreed-upon treaty obligation even if this is seen as a violation of the treaty under international law. Several U.S. court rulings confirmed this understanding, including the 1900 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[The Paquete Habana|Paquete Habana]]'', a late 1950s decision in ''[[Reid v. Covert]]'', and a lower court ruling in 1986 in ''[[Garcia-Mir v. Meese]]''. Further, the Supreme Court has declared itself as having the power to rule a treaty as void by declaring it "unconstitutional", although as of 2011, it has never exercised this power.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The [[United States Department of State|State Department]] has taken the position that the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]] represents established law. Generally when the U.S. signs a treaty, it is binding. However, because of the ''[[Reid v. Covert]]'' decision, the U.S. adds a [[Reservation (law)|reservation]] to the text of every treaty that says, in effect, that the U.S. intends to abide by the treaty, but if the treaty is found to be in violation of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], then the U.S. legally can't abide by the treaty since the U.S. signature would be ''[[ultra vires]]''.

==Alliances==

===NATO===

The United States is a founding member of [[NATO]], the world's largest military alliance. The 28-nation alliance consists of Canada and much of Europe, including the nation with NATO's second largest military, the United Kingdom. Under the NATO charter, the United States is compelled to defend any NATO state that is attacked by a foreign power. NATO is restricted to within the North American and European areas. In 1989, the United States also granted five nations the [[major non-NATO ally]] status (MNNA); this number was increased in the late 1990s and following the [[September 11 attacks]]; it currently includes 28 nations. Each such state has a unique relationship with the United States, involving various military and economic partnerships and alliances.

United States foreign policy affirms its alliance with the United Kingdom as its most important{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} [[bilateral relationship]] in the world, evidenced by aligned political affairs between the [[White House]] and [[10 Downing Street]], as well as joint military operations carried out between the two nations. While both the United States and the United Kingdom maintain close relationships with many other nations around the world, the level of cooperation in military planning, execution of military operations, nuclear weapons technology, and intelligence sharing with each other has been described as "unparalleled" among major powers throughout the 20th and early 21st century.<ref name="wither">{{Cite journal |last=James |first=Wither |date=March 2006 |title=An Endangered Partnership: The Anglo-American Defence Relationship in the Early Twenty-first Century |journal=European Security |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=47–65 |doi=10.1080/09662830600776694 |accessdate=2007-01-09 |issn=0966-2839}}</ref>

{{Main|Canada–United States relations}}
The bilateral relationship between Canada and the United States is of notable importance to both countries. About 75–85% of Canadian trade is with the United States, and Canada is the United States' largest trading partner and chief supplier of oil. While there are disputed issues between the two nations, relations are close and the two countries share the "[[Canada – United States border|world's longest undefended border]]."<ref>John Herd Thompson, and Stephen J. Randall, ''Canada and the United States: Ambivalent Allies'' (4th ed.

Military collaboration began during World War II and continued throughout the [[Cold War]] on both a bilateral basis and a multilateral relationship through [[NATO]]. A high volume of trade and migration between the United States and Canada since the 1850s has generated closer ties, despite continued Canadian fears of being culturally overwhelmed by its neighbor, which is nine times larger in terms of population and eleven times larger in terms of economy.<ref name=twsG37>{{cite news |title= 5.

===Mexico===
{{Main|Mexico–United States relations}}

The United States shares a unique and often complex relationship with Mexico. A history of armed conflict goes back to the [[Texas Revolution]] in the 1830s, the [[Mexican–American War]] in the 1840s, and an American invasion in the 1910s. Important treaties include the [[Gadsden Purchase]], and multilaterally with Canada, the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]. The central issue in recent years has been illegal immigration, followed by illegal gun sales (from the U.S.), drug smuggling (to the U.S.) and escalating drug cartel violence just south of the U.S.-Mexico border.<ref>Tim Padgett, "Mexico's Calderón Needs to Listen, Not Just Lecture U.S." ''TIME'' May 19, 2010 [http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1990176,00.html online]</ref><ref>Burton Kirkwood, ''The History of Mexico'' (2010) pp&nbsp;97–99, 138-52, 216</ref>

The United States' relationship with Australia is a very close one, with [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] stating that "America doesn't have a better friend in the world than Australia".<ref>{{cite web|author=Lyndal Curtis for The World Today |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/03/25/2525854.htm |title=Rudd's warm Washington welcome - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2009-03-25 |accessdate=2014-08-18}}</ref> The relationship is formalized by the [[ANZUS|ANZUS treaty]] and the [[Australia–United States Free Trade Agreement]].
The two countries have a shared history, both have previously been British Colonies and many Americans flocked to the [[Australian gold rushes|Australian goldfields]] in the 19th century. At a strategic level, the relationship really came to prominence in World War II, when the two nations worked extremely closely in the [[Pacific War]] against Japan, with General [[Douglas MacArthur]] undertaking his role as Supreme Allied Commander based in Australia, effectively having Australian troops and resources under his command. During this period, the cultural interaction between Australia and the U.S. were elevated to a higher level as over 1 million U.S. military personnel moved through Australia during the course of the war. The relationship continued to evolve throughout the second half of the 20th Century, and today now involves strong relationships at the executive and mid levels of government and the military, leading [[Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs]], [[Kurt M. Campbell]] to declare that "in the last ten years, [Australia] has ascended to one of the closest one or two allies [of the U.S.] on the planet".<ref name="TVNZ_3065958">{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/q-and-a-news/q-guyon-espiner-interviews-kurt-campbell-3065958 |title=Q+A: Guyon Espiner interviews Kurt Campbell |date=October 11, 2009 |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=September 30, 2011}}</ref>

===Japan===
{{main|Japan–United States relations}}
The relationship began in the 1850s as the U.S. was a major factor in forcing Japan to resume contacts with the outer world beyond a very restricted role. In the late 19th century the Japanese sent many delegations to Europe, and some to the U.S., to discover and copy the latest technology and thereby modernize Japan very rapidly and allow it to build its own empire. There was some friction over control of Hawaii and the Philippines, but Japan stood aside as the U.S. annexed those lands in 1898. Likewise the U.S. did not object when Japan took control of Korea. The two nations cooperated with the European powers in suppressing the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in China in 1900, but the U.S. was increasingly troubled about Japan's denial of the [[Open Door Policy]] that would ensure that all nations could do business with China on an equal basis.<ref>Foster Rhea Dulles, ''Yankees and Samurai: America's Role in the Emergence of Modern Japan, 1791–1900'' (1965)</ref>

President Theodore Roosevelt admired Japan's strength as it defeated a major European power, Russia. He brokered an end to the war between Russia and Japan in 1905–6. Anti-Japanese sentiment (especially on the West Coast) soured relations in the 1907–24 era. In the 1930s the U.S. protested vehemently against Japan's seizure of Manchuria (1931), its war against China (1937–45), and its seizure of Indochina (Vietnam) 1940–41. American sympathies were with China and Japan rejected increasingly angry American demands that Japan pull out of China. The two nations fought an all-out war 1941–45; the U.S. won a total victory, with heavy bombing (including two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki) that devastated Japan's 50 largest industrial cities. The American army under [[Douglas MacArthur]] occupied and ruled Japan, 1945–51, with the successful goal of sponsoring a peaceful, prosperous and democratic nation.<ref>Walter LaFeber, ''The Clash: A History of US–Japan Relations'' (W.W. Norton, 1997)</ref>

In 1951, the U.S. and Japan signed [[Treaty of San Francisco]] and [[Security Treaty Between the United States and Japan]], subsequently revised as [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan]] in 1960, relations since then have been excellent. The United States considers Japan to be one of its closest allies, and it is both a Major Non-NATO ally and NATO contact country. The United States has several military bases in Japan including [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Yokosuka]], which harbors the [[United States Seventh Fleet|U.S. 7th Fleet]]. The [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|JSDF]], or Japanese Self Defense Force, cross train with the U.S. Military, often providing auxiliary security and conducting war games. When the U.S.President Barack Obama met with Japanese Prime Minister [[Taro Aso]] in 2009, he said the relationship with Japan as the "cornerstone of security in East Asia".<ref>{{cite news|title=Japanese Prime Minister Meets With Obama, Says Economy Complicates North Korea Talks|work=Washington Post|date=2009-02-25|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/24/AR2009022403404.html|accessdate=2013-01-24|first=Glenn|last=Kessler}}</ref> After the several years of critical moment during [[Democratic Party of Japan|Japan's Democratic Party]] administration, President Obama and Prime Minister [[Shinzo Abe]] reconfirmed the importance of its alliance and currently the U.S. and Japan negotiating to participate [[Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Japan and United States Reaffirm Their Close Ties|work=New York Times|date=2013-02-22|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/23/world/asia/japan-and-united-states-reaffirm-their-close-ties.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|accessdate=2013-02-23|first=Jackie|last=Calmes}}</ref><ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/22/joint-statement-united-states-and-japan Joint Statement by the United States and Japan]</ref>

===South Korea===
{{Main|South Korea–United States relations}}
[[South Korea]]–United States relations have been most extensive since 1945, when the United States helped establish capitalism in South Korea and led the UN-sponsored [[Korean War]] against North Korea and China (1950–1953).<ref>Jae Ho  Chung, ''Between Ally and Partner: Korea-China Relations and the United States'' (2008) [http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0231139071/ excerpt and text search]</ref> Stimulated by heavy American aid{{by whom|date=February 2013}}, South Korea's rapid economic growth, democratization and modernization greatly reduced its U.S. dependency.

===China===
{{Main|Sino-American relations}}
[[File:Chinadialogue speaking CK-0038.jpg|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] addresses the opening session of the first U.S.–China Strategic and Economic Dialogue.]]
American relations with the [[China|People's Republic of China]] are quite strong, yet complex. A great amount of trade between the two countries necessitates positive political relations, although occasional disagreements over tariffs, currency exchange rates and the [[Political status of Taiwan]] do occur. Nevertheless, the United States and China have an extremely extensive partnership. The U.S. criticizes China on human rights issues and in recent years, China has criticized the United States on human rights in return.

===Taiwan===
{{Main|Republic of China–United States relations}}

[[Taiwan]] (officially the Republic of China), does not have official [[diplomacy|diplomatic relations]] with America and no longer receives [[diplomatic recognition]] from the State Department of the United States, but it conducts unofficial diplomatic relations through its [[de facto]] embassy, commonly known as the "[[American Institute in Taiwan]] (AIT)", and is considered to be a strong Asian ally and supporter of the United States.<ref>Nancy Bernkopf Tucker, ed., ''Dangerous Strait: The U.S.-Taiwan-China Crisis'' (2005)</ref>

===ASEAN===
[[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) is an important partner for United States in both economic and geostrategic aspects. ASEAN's geostrategic importance stems from many factors, including: the strategic location of member countries, the large shares of global trade that pass through regional waters, and the alliances and partnerships which the United States shares with ASEAN member states. In July 2009, the United States signed ASEAN's Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, which establishes guiding principles intended to build confidence among its signatories with the aim of maintaining regional peace and stability.<ref>Daniel Seah, "The Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia: The Issue of Non-Intervention and its Accession by Australia and the USA," '' Chinese Journal of international Law and'' (2012) 11#4 pp 785 - 822  [http://chinesejil.oxfordjournals.org/content/11/4/785.short online]</ref> Trade flows are robust and increasing between America and the ASEAN region.

====Indonesia====
{{Main|Indonesia–United States relations}}
As the largest ASEAN member, [[Indonesia]] has played an active and prominent role in developing the organization.<ref>See {{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/07/20/editorial-the-asean-cage.html|title=Editorial: The ASEAN cage ''Jakarta Post''7 July 2011}}</ref> For United States, Indonesia is important for dealing with certain issues; such as terrorism,<ref>[http://www.cdi.org/terrorism/priority.cfm U.S.-Indonesia Military Relations in The Anti-Terror War]</ref> democracy, and how United States project its relations with Islamic world, since Indonesia has the world's largest Islamic population, and one that honors and respects religious diversity.<ref>[http://www.trumanproject.org/posts/2011/02/indonesia-important-focus-point-world-security Indonesia: An Important Focus Point for World Security]</ref> US eyes Indonesia as potential strategic allies in Southeast Asia.<ref name="asean.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.asean.org/afp/111.htm|title=404|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref> During his stately visit to Indonesia, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] has held up Indonesia as an example of how a developing nation can embrace democracy and diversity.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11723650|title=BBC News - Obama hails Indonesia as example for world|work=BBC News|accessdate=18 February 2015|date=November 10, 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://projects.washingtonpost.com/obama-speeches/speech/486/ Obama delivers a speech in the University of Indonesia]</ref>

====Malaysia====
{{Main|Malaysia–United States relations}}
Despite increasingly strained relations under the [[Mahathir Mohamad]] government, ties have been thawed under [[Najib Razak]]'s administration. Economic ties are particularly robust, with the United States being Malaysia's largest trading partner and Malaysia is the tenth-largest trading partner of the U.S. Annual two-way trade amounts to $49 billion. The United States and Malaysia launched negotiations for a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) in June 2006.

The United States and Malaysia enjoy strong security cooperation. Malaysia hosts the Southeast Asia Regional Center for Counterterrorism (SEARCCT), where over 2000 officials from various countries have received training. The United States is among the foreign countries that has collaborated with the center in conducting capacity building programmes. The U.S. and Malaysia share a strong military-to-military relationship with numerous exchanges, training, joint exercises, and visits.

====Myanmar====
{{Main|Burma–United States relations}}
Bilateral ties have generally been strained but are slowly improving. The United States has placed broad sanctions on Burma because of the [[8888 Uprising|military crackdown in 1988]] and the military regime's refusal to honour the [[Burmese general election, 1990|election results of the 1990]] People's Assembly election. Similarly, the [[European Union]] has placed embargoes on Burma, including an arms embargo, cessation of trade preferences, and suspension of all aid with the exception of [[humanitarian aid]].<ref name="EU">{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/comm/external_relations/myanmar/intro/index.htm |title= The EU's relations with Burma / Myanmar |accessdate=2006-07-13 |publisher=[[European Union]]|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060725000750/http%3A//ec.europa.eu/comm/external_relations/myanmar/intro/index.htm |archivedate = 25 July 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

US and European government sanctions against the military government, alongside boycotts and other types direct pressure on corporations by western supporters of the Burmese democracy movement, have resulted in the withdrawal from Burma of most U.S. and many European companies. However, several Western companies remain due to loopholes in the sanctions.<ref>[http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=3986 The List: Burma's Economic Lifelines]. ''[[Foreign Policy]]''. October 2007</ref> Asian corporations have generally remained willing to continue investing in Myanmar and to initiate new investments, particularly in [[natural resource]] extraction.

[[2011–12 Burmese political reforms|Ongoing reforms]] have improved relations between Burma and the United States.

====Philippines====
{{Main|Philippines–United States relations}}
The United States ruled the Philippines from 1898 to 1946. The Spanish government ceded the Philippines to the United States in the [[1898 Treaty of Paris]] that ended the Spanish–American War. The United States finally recognized Philippine independence on July 4, 1946 in the [[Treaty of Manila (1946)|Treaty of Manila]].<ref>{{Citation|url=http://untreaty.un.org/unts/1_60000/1/6/00000254.pdf|format=pdf|title=TREATY OF GENERAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES.

====Thailand====
{{Main|Thailand–United States relations}}
Thailand and the US are both former [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]] (SEATO) members, being close partners throughout the [[Cold War]], and are still close allies. Since 2003, the U.S. has designated  [[Thailand]] as a [[major non-NATO ally|Major Non-NATO Ally]].

====Vietnam====
{{Main|United States–Vietnam relations}}
United States involved in [[Vietnam War]] in 1955 to 1975. In 1995, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] announced the formal normalization of diplomatic relations with [[Vietnam]]. Today US eyes Vietnam as a potential strategic ally in Southeast Asia.<ref name="asean.org"/>

American relations with Eastern Europe are influenced by the legacy of the [[Cold War]]. Since the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], former Communist-bloc states in Europe have gradually transitioned to democracy and capitalism. Many have also joined the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]], strengthening economic ties with the broader Western world and gaining the military protection of the United States via the [[North Atlantic Treaty]].

===Kosovo===
{{Main|Kosovo–United States relations}}
The UN Security Council divided on the question of [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|Kosovo's declaration of independence]]. Kosovo declared its independence on February 17, 2008, whilst Serbia objected that Kosovo is part of its territory. Of the five members with veto power in the UN Security Council, the USA, UK, and France [[International reaction to the 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|recognized]] the declaration of independence, and [[China]] has expressed concern, while Russia considers it [[International reaction to the 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|illegal]]. "In its declaration of independence, [[Kosovo]] committed itself to the highest standards of democracy, including freedom and tolerance and justice for citizens of all ethnic backgrounds", President [[George W Bush]] said on February 19, 2008.<ref>[http://www.america.gov/st/peacesec-english/2008/February/20080219131902idybeekcm0.4052851.html Bush Hails Kosovo Independence], U.S. Department of State's Bureau of International Information Programs</ref><ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/jun/11/balkans.usa Bush insists Kosovo must be independent and receives hero's welcome in Albania], The Guardian</ref>

===Hub and spoke vs multilateral===
While America's relationships with Europe have tended to be in terms of multilateral frameworks, such as NATO, America's relations with Asia have tended to be based on a "hub and spoke" model using a series of bilateral relationships where states coordinate with the United States and do not collaborate with each other.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hufbauer|first1=Gary Clyde|last2=Schott|first2=Jeffrey J.|title=Western Hemisphere Economic Integration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYeeuxAkipUC&pg=PA132|year=1994|publisher=Peterson Institute|pages=132–22}}</ref>  On May 30, 2009, at the [[Shangri-La Dialogue]] Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates urged the nations of Asia to build on this hub and spoke model as they established and grew multilateral institutions such as [[ASEAN]], [[APEC]] and the ad hoc arrangements in the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2009/05/mil-090530-afps03.htm|title=Gates Delivers Keynote Address to Open Asia Security Conference|author=John Pike|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref> However, in 2011 Gates said that the United States must serve as the "indispensable nation," for building multilateral cooperation.<ref>Shanker, Tom.

As of 2014, the U.S. currently produces about 66% of the [[Petroleum|oil]] that it consumes.<ref>http://www.eia.gov/countries/country-data.cfm?fips=US</ref> While its imports have exceeded domestic production since the early 1990s, new [[hydraulic fracturing]] techniques and discovery of shale oil deposits in Canada and the American Dakotas offer the potential for increased energy independence from oil exporting countries such as [[OPEC]].<ref>[http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/petroleum/data_publications/company_level_imports/current/import.html Crude Oil and Total Petroleum Imports Top 15 Countries]</ref> Former U.S. President [[George W.

Two-thirds of the world's proven [[oil reserves]] are estimated to be found in the
[[Persian Gulf]].<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E4D6123AF93AA15752C0A9649C8B63 Shrinking Our Presence in Saudi Arabia], New York Times</ref><ref>[http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/environment/alternative-energy/end-cheap-oil.html The End of Cheap Oil], National Geographic</ref> Despite its distance, the Persian Gulf region was first proclaimed to be of national interest to the United States during World War II. [[Petroleum]] is of central importance to modern armies, and the United States—as the world's leading oil producer at that time—supplied most of the oil for the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] armies. Many U.S. strategists were concerned that the war would dangerously reduce the U.S. oil supply, and so they sought to establish good relations with [[Saudi Arabia]], a [[Monarchy|kingdom]] with large oil reserves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/oil/2005/crudedesigns.htm|title=Crude Designs:|author=James Paul - Global Policy Forum|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref>

The Persian Gulf region continued to be regarded as an area of vital importance to the United States during the [[Cold War]]. Three Cold War [[United States Presidential doctrines]]—the [[Truman Doctrine]], the [[Eisenhower Doctrine]], and the [[Nixon Doctrine]]—played roles in the formulation of the [[Carter Doctrine]], which stated that the United States would use military force if necessary to defend its "[[national interest]]s" in the [[Persian Gulf]] region.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20874331/ The war is about oil but it's not that simple], msnbc.com</ref> Carter's successor, President [[Ronald Reagan]], extended the policy in October 1981 with what is sometimes called the ''"Reagan Corollary to the Carter Doctrine"'', which proclaimed that the United States would intervene to protect Saudi Arabia, whose security was threatened after the outbreak of the [[Iran–Iraq War]].<ref>[http://www.history.navy.mil/wars/dstorm/sword-shield.htm The United States Navy and the Persian Gulf]</ref> Some analysts have argued that the implementation of the Carter Doctrine and the Reagan Corollary also played a role in the outbreak of the [[Iraq War|2003 Iraq War]].<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/996605.html What if the Chinese were to apply the Carter Doctrine?], Haaretz - Israel News</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,921819,00.html Selling the Carter Doctrine], TIME</ref><ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article2461214.ece Alan Greenspan claims Iraq war was really for oil], Times Online</ref><ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jun/20/iraq.oil Oil giants to sign contracts with Iraq], The Guardian</ref>

===Canada===
Almost all of Canada's energy exports go to the United States, making it the largest foreign source of U.S. energy imports: Canada is consistently among the top sources for U.S. oil imports, and it is the largest source of U.S. natural gas and electricity imports.<ref>See Energy Information Administration, [http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Canada/Background.html "Canada" (2009 report)]</ref>

===Africa===
In 2007 the U.S. was [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]'s largest single export market accounting for 28.4% of exports (second in total to the EU at 31.4%). 81% of U.S. imports from this region were petroleum products.<ref>http://www.agoa.gov/resources/US_African_Trade_Profile_2009.pdf</ref>

==Foreign aid==
{{Main|United States foreign aid|United States Agency for International Development}}
Foreign assistance is a core component of the State Department's international affairs budget, which is $49 billion in all for 2014.<ref name="appropriations.house.gov">See [http://appropriations.house.gov/uploadedfiles/01.13.14_fy_2014_omnibus_-_state_foreign_operations_-_summary.pdf "FY 2014 Omnibus – State and Foreign Operations Appropriations" (Jan 2014)]</ref>  Aid is considered an essential instrument of U.S. foreign policy. There are four major categories of non-military foreign assistance: bilateral development aid, economic assistance supporting U.S. political and security goals, humanitarian aid, and multilateral economic contributions (for example, contributions to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund).<ref>[http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/31987.pdf Foreign Aid: An Introductory Overview of U.S. Programs and Policy]</ref>

In absolute dollar terms, the United States government is the largest international aid donor ($23 billion in 2014).<ref name="appropriations.house.gov"/>  The [[USAID|U.S. Agency for International Development]] (USAID) manages the bulk of bilateral economic assistance; the Treasury Department handles most multilateral aid. In addition many private agencies, churches and philanthropies provide aid.

Although the United States is the largest donor in absolute dollar terms, it is actually ranked 19 out of 27 countries on the [[Commitment to Development Index]]. The CDI ranks the 27 richest donor countries on their policies that affect the developing world. In the aid component the United States is penalized for low net aid volume as a share of the economy, a large share of [[tied aid|tied]] or partially tied aid, and a large share of aid given to less poor and relatively undemocratic governments.

Foreign aid is a highly partisan issue in the United States, with liberals, on average, supporting foreign aid much more than conservatives do.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=23736|title=The Politics of American Foreign Policy: How Ideology Divides Liberals and Conservatives over Foreign Affairs - Peter Hays Gries|author=Stanford University Press|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref>

==Military==
The United States has fought wars and intervened militarily on many occasions. See, [[Timeline of United States military operations]]. The U.S. also operates a vast network of military bases around the world. See, [[List of United States military bases]].

In recent years, the U.S. has used its military superiority as sole superpower to lead a number of wars, including, most recently, the invasion of [[Iraq]] in March 2003 as part of its global "War on Terror."

====Opinion that U.S. intervention does not export democracy====
Professor Paul W. Drake argued that the U.S. first attempted to export [[democracy]] in [[Latin America]] through intervention from 1912 to 1932. Drake argued that this was contradictory because international law defines [[invasion|intervention]] as "dictatorial interference in the affairs of another state for the purpose of altering the condition of things." The study suggested that efforts to promote democracy failed because democracy needs to develop out of internal conditions, and can not be forcibly imposed. There was disagreement about what constituted ''[[democracy]]''; Drake suggested American leaders sometimes defined democracy in a narrow sense of a nation having elections; Drake suggested a broader understanding was needed. Further, there was disagreement about what constituted a "rebellion"; Drake saw a pattern in which the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] disapproved of any type of rebellion, even so-called "revolutions", and in some instances rebellions against dictatorships.<ref name="LA">{{cite book |last=Lowenthal |first=Abraham F. |date=March 1, 1991 |title=Exporting Democracy : The United States and Latin America |pages=1, 4, 5|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=0-8018-4132-1}}</ref> Historian [[Walter LaFeber]] stated, "The world's leading revolutionary nation (the U.S.) in the eighteenth century became the leading protector of the status quo in the twentieth century."<ref name = "Walter">{{cite book |last=Lafeber |first=Walter |year=1993 |title=Inevitable Revolutions: The United States in Central America |publisher=W.

====Opinion that U.S. intervention has mixed results====
Tures examined 228 cases of American intervention from 1973 to 2005, using [[Freedom House]] data. A plurality of interventions, 96, caused no change in the country's democracy. In 69 instances the country became less democratic after the intervention. In the remaining 63 cases, a country became more democratic.<ref name="operation"/> However this does not take into account the direction the country would have gone with no US intervention.

====Opinion that U.S. intervention effectively exports democracy====
Hermann and Kegley found that American military interventions designed to protect or promote democracy increased freedom in those countries.<ref name="promote"/> Peceny argued that the democracies created after military intervention are still closer to an [[autocracy]] than a [[democracy]], quoting Przeworski "while some democracies are more democratic than others, unless offices are contested, no regime should be considered democratic."<ref>{{cite journal

United States foreign policy also includes covert actions to topple foreign governments that have been opposed to the United States. In 1953 the CIA, working with the British government, initiated ''[[Operation Ajax]]'' against the democratically elected [[Prime Minister of Iran]] [[Mohammad Mossadegh]] who had attempted to [[nationalize]] Iran's oil, threatening the interests of the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]].<ref name=NYTsr2000>{{Cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Special Report: Secret History of the CIA in Iran|url=http://www.nytimes.com/library/world/mideast/041600iran-cia-index.html| year=2000}}</ref>

A year later, in [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état|''Operation PBSUCCESS'']], the United States government and the CIA toppled the democratically elected left-wing government of [[Jacobo Árbenz]] in [[Guatemala]] and installed the military dictator [[Carlos Castillo Armas]]. The [[United Fruit Company]] lobbied for Árbenz overthrow as his [[Decree 900|land reforms]] jeopardized their land holdings in Guatemala, and painted these reforms as a communist threat.

==Human Rights==
{{See also|List of authoritarian regimes supported by the United States|United States and state-sponsored terrorism}}
The inclusion of Human Rights in U.S. foreign policy had a controversial start. For one thing, human rights driven foreign policy did not originate in the Executive branch but was instead enforced upon it by Congress, starting in the 1970s.<ref name="Crabb & Holt">{{cite book|last=Crabb|first=Cecil V.|title=Invitation to Struggle: Congress, the President and Foreign Policy|year=1992|publisher=Congressional Quarterly|location=Michigan|isbn=978-0-87187-622-5|pages=187–211|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vW2GAAAAMAAJ&q=Invitation+to+Struggle&dq=Invitation+to+Struggle&source=bl&ots=Zef6IJ2aj5&sig=opXiwGJ0mjjNwwLGpGV-aBVi0Es&hl=en&sa=X&ei=OV4JUMLPAcyJ6wHD_fyJCg&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA|edition=2nd|author2=Pat Holt}}</ref> Following the [[Vietnam War]], the feeling that U.S. foreign policy had grown apart from traditional American values was seized upon by [[Donald M. Fraser|Senator Donald M. Fraser (D, MI)]], leading the Subcommittee on International Organizations and Movements, in criticizing Republican Foreign Policy under [[Richard Nixon#Presidency|the Nixon administration]]. In the early 1970s, Congress concluded the Vietnam War and passed the [[War Powers Resolution|War Powers Act]]. As "part of a growing assertiveness by Congress about many aspects of Foreign Policy,"<ref name=Forsythe>{{cite book|last=Forsythe|first=David|title=Human Rights and U.S. Foreign Policy: Congress Reconsidered|year=1988|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville|isbn=978-0-8130-0885-1|pages=1–23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cppHP3zb-ccC&dq=Human+Rights+and+U.S.+Foreign+Policy:+Congress+Reconsidered&source=gbs_navlinks_s}}</ref> Human Rights concerns became a battleground between the Legislative and the Executive branches in the formulation of foreign policy. David Forsythe points to three specific, early examples of Congress interjecting its own thoughts on foreign policy:

# Subsection (a) of the International Financial Assistance Act of 1977: ensured assistance through international financial institutions would be limited to countries "other than those whose governments engage in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights."<ref name="Forsythe" />
# Section 116 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended in 1984: reads in part, "No assistance may be provided under this part to the government of any country which engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights."<ref name="Forsythe" />
# Section 502B of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended in 1978: "No security assistance may be provided to any country the government of which engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights."<ref name="Forsythe" />

These measures were repeatedly used by Congress, with varying success, to affect U.S. foreign policy towards the inclusion of Human Rights concerns. Specific examples include [[El Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Guatemala]] and [[South Africa]]. The Executive (from Nixon to Reagan) argued that the [[Cold War]] required placing regional security in favor of US interests over any behavioral concerns of national allies. Congress argued the opposite, in favor of distancing the United States from oppressive regimes.<ref name="Crabb & Holt" /> Nevertheless, according to historian [[Daniel Goldhagen]], during the last two decades of the Cold War, the number of American client states practicing mass murder outnumbered those of the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>[[Daniel Goldhagen]] (2009).

==War on Drugs==
{{Main|War on Drugs}}
United States foreign policy is influenced by the efforts of the U.S. government to control imports of illicit [[illegal drug trade|drugs]], including [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], [[methamphetamine]], and [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. This is especially true in Latin America, a focus for the U.S. [[War on Drugs]]. Those efforts date back to at least 1880, when the U.S. and China completed an agreement that [[Prohibition (drugs)|prohibited]] the shipment of [[opium]] between the two countries.

Over a century later, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act requires the President to identify the major drug transit or major illicit drug-producing countries. In September 2005,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/09/20050915-2.html|title=Memorandum for the Secretary of State|date=15 September 2005|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref> the following countries were identified: [[Bahamas]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Burma]], [[Colombia]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Ecuador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Haiti]], India, [[Jamaica]], [[Laos]], Mexico, [[Nigeria]], Pakistan, [[Panama]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]] and [[Venezuela]]. Two of these, Burma and Venezuela are countries that the U.S. considers to have failed to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements during the previous 12 months. Notably absent from the 2005 list were [[Afghanistan]], the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[Vietnam]]; Canada was also omitted in spite of evidence that criminal groups there are increasingly involved in the production of [[MDMA]] destined for the United States and that large-scale cross-border trafficking of Canadian-grown cannabis continues. The U.S. believes that the Netherlands are successfully countering the production and flow of MDMA to the U.S.

Regarding support for certain anti-Communist dictatorships during the [[Cold War]], a response is that they were seen as a necessary evil, with the alternatives even worse Communist or fundamentalist dictatorships. David Schmitz says this policy did not serve U.S. interests. Friendly tyrants resisted necessary reforms and destroyed the political center (though not in South Korea), while the '[[Political realism|realist]]' policy of coddling dictators brought a backlash among foreign populations with long memories.<ref>The United States and Right-Wing Dictatorships, 1965–1989. David F. Schmitz. 2006.</ref><ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2005/12/11/do1102.xml&sSheet=/opinion/2005/12/11/ixopinion.html Do the sums, then compare U.S. and Communist crimes from the Cold War] Telegraph, 11 December 2005, Niall Ferguson</ref>

Many democracies have voluntary military ties with United States. See [[NATO]], [[ANZUS]], [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan]], [[Mutual Defense Treaty]] with [[South Korea]], and [[Major non-NATO ally]]. Those nations with military alliances with the U.S. can spend less on the military since they can count on U.S. protection. This may give a false impression that the U.S. is less peaceful than those nations.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9266967 Give peace a rating] May 31, 2007, from ''The Economist'' print edition</ref><ref>[http://www.japantoday.com/jp/news/407850/all Japan ranked as world's 5th most peaceful nation: report] Japan Today, May 31, 2007</ref>

Research on the [[democratic peace theory]] has generally found that democracies, including the United States, have not made war on one another. There have been U.S. support for coups against some democracies, but for example [[Spencer R. Weart]] argues that part of the explanation was the perception, correct or not, that these states were turning into Communist dictatorships. Also important was the role of rarely transparent United States government agencies, who sometimes mislead or did not fully implement the decisions of elected civilian leaders.<ref>{{cite book|last=Weart|first=Spencer R.|title=Never at War|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1998|isbn=0-300-07017-9}} pp. 221–224, 314.</ref>

Empirical studies (see [[democide]]) have found that democracies, including the United States, have killed much fewer civilians than dictatorships.<ref>DEATH BY GOVERNMENT By R.J. Rummel New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Publishers, 1994. Online links: [http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/NOTE1.HTM] [http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.FIG23.4.GIF] [http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/POWER.FIG2.GIF]</ref><ref>''[http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/inscr/genocide/ No Lessons Learned from the Holocaust?]'', Barbara Harff, 2003.</ref> Media may be biased against the U.S. regarding reporting human rights violations. Studies have found that ''The New York Times'' coverage of worldwide human rights violations predominantly focuses on the human rights violations in nations where there is clear U.S. involvement, while having relatively little coverage of the human rights violations in other nations.<ref name=Caliendo1999>{{cite journal|author=Caliendo, S.M.|year=1999|title=All the News That's Fit to Print? New York Times Coverage of Human-Rights Violations|journal=The Harvard International Journal of Press Politics|volume=4|pages=48–69|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/harvard_international_journal_of_press_politics/v004/4.4caliendo.html|accessdate=2008-04-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Caliendo, Stephen. and Gibney, Mark.|year=2006|title=American Print Media Coverage of Human Rights Violations|url=http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p152798_index.html?type=info|accessdate=2008-04-02}}</ref> For example, the bloodiest war in recent time, involving eight nations and killing millions of civilians, was the [[Second Congo War]], which was almost completely ignored by the media.

[[Niall Ferguson]] argues that the U.S. is incorrectly blamed for all the human rights violations in nations they have supported. He writes that it is generally agreed that Guatemala was the worst of the US-backed regimes during the Cold War. However, the U.S. cannot credibly be blamed for all the 200,000 deaths during the long [[Guatemalan Civil War]].<ref name="autogenerated1" /> The U.S. Intelligence Oversight Board writes that military aid was cut for long periods because of such violations, that the U.S. helped stop a coup in 1993, and that efforts were made to improve the conduct of the security services.<ref>[http://www.ciponline.org/iob.htm Report on the Guatemala Review] Intelligence Oversight Board. June 28, 1996.</ref> However, W. John Green contends that the United States was an "essential enabler" of "Latin America's political murder habit, bringing out and allowing to flourish some of the region's worst tendencies."<ref>W.

Today the U.S. states that democratic nations best support U.S. national interests. According to the U.S. State Department, "Democracy is the one national interest that helps to secure all the others. Democratically governed nations are more likely to secure the peace, deter aggression, expand open markets, promote economic development, protect American citizens, combat international terrorism and crime, uphold human and worker rights, avoid humanitarian crises and refugee flows, improve the global environment, and protect human health."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/democ/|title=Democracy|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref> According to former U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]], "Ultimately, the best strategy to ensure our security and to build a durable peace is to support the advance of democracy elsewhere. Democracies don't attack each other."<ref>{{cite news|author=Clinton, Bill|title=1994 State Of The Union Address|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/states/docs/sou94.htm|accessdate=2006-01-22|work=The Washington Post|date=January 28, 2000}}</ref> In one view mentioned by the U.S. State Department, democracy is also good for business. Countries that embrace political reforms are also more likely to pursue economic reforms that improve the productivity of businesses. Accordingly, since the mid-1980s, under President [[Ronald Reagan]], there has been an increase in levels of foreign direct investment going to emerging market democracies relative to countries that have not undertaken political reforms.<ref>[http://usinfo.state.gov/usinfo/USINFO/Products/Webchats/bohn_27_mar_2007.html]</ref> Leaked cables in 2010 suggested that the "dark shadow of terrorism still dominates the United States' relations with the world".<ref name=twsDecZ16af>{{cite news|first1=Scott|last1=Shane|first2=Andrew W.|last2=Lehren|title=Leaked Cables Offer Raw Look at U.S. Diplomacy|work=The New York Times|quote=The cables show that nearly a decade after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the dark shadow of terrorism still dominates the United States' relations with the world.&nbsp;... |date=2010-11-28|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/29/world/29cables.html?_r=2&pagewanted=2|accessdate=2010-12-26}}</ref>
