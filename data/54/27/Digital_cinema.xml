The specification ensures that 2K content can play on 4K projectors and vice-versa. Smaller resolutions in one direction are also supported (the image gets automatically centered). Later versions of the standard added also additional playback rates (like 25 fps in SMPTE mode).</paragraph><paragraph>For the sound component of the content the specification provides for up to 16 channels of uncompressed audio using the<space/><link><target>Broadcast Wave Format</target><part>&quot;Broadcast Wave&quot; (.wav)</part></link><space/>format at 24 bits and 48&amp;nbsp;kHz or 96&amp;nbsp;kHz sampling.</paragraph><paragraph>Playback is controlled by an<space/><link><target>XML</target></link>-format Composition Playlist, into an<space/><link><target>MXF</target></link>-compliant file at a maximum data rate of 250 Mbit/s.

While much of the specification codifies work that had already been ongoing in the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (<link><target>SMPTE</target></link>), the specification is important in establishing a content owner framework for the distribution and security of first-release motion picture content.</paragraph><paragraph>In addition to DCI's work, the National Association of Theatre Owners (NATO) released its Digital Cinema System Requirements.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="title">NATO Digital Cinema Requirements v2.1<space/></arg><arg name="url">http://www.natoonline.org/pdfs/NATO%20Digital%20Cinema%20System%20Requirements%20-%20release%202%201.pdf</arg><arg name="format">PDF<space/></arg><arg name="date">December 12, 2008<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">November 19, 2009</arg></template></extension>The document addresses the requirements of digital cinema systems from the operational needs of the exhibitor, focusing on areas not addressed by DCI, including access for the visually impaired and hearing impaired, workflow inside the cinema, and equipment interoperability.

It was clear by that point in time that HDTV did not provide a sufficient technological basis for the foundation of digital cinema playback. In Europe, India and Japan however, there is still a significant presence of HDTV for theatrical presentations. Agreements within the ISO standards body have led to these non-compliant systems being referred to as Electronic Cinema Systems (<bold>E-Cinema</bold>).</paragraph><heading level='3'>Digital cinema projectors</heading><preblock><preline>Only four manufacturers make DCI-approved digital cinema projectors; these are<space/><link><target>Sony</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Barco NV</target><part>Barco</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Christie (company)</target><part>Christie</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>NEC</target></link>.

Although D-Cinema projectors are similar in principle to digital projectors used in industry, education, and domestic 'home cinemas' they differ in two important respects: first, they must conform to the strict performance requirements of the DCI specification, second, they must incorporate anti-piracy devices intended to protect the content copyright. For these reasons all projectors intended to be sold to theaters for screening current release movies<space/><italics>must</italics><space/>be approved by the DCI before being put on sale. They now pass through a process called CTP (Compliance Test Plan). Because feature films in digital form are encrypted and the decryption keys (KDMs) are locked to the serial number of the server used (linking to both the projector serial number and server is planned in the future), a system will allow playback of a protected feature only with the required KDM.</preline></preblock><heading level='3'>DLP cinema projectors</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:4K DLP CINEMA.

Digital Projection Incorporated (DPI) designed and sold a few DLP Cinema units (is8-2K) when TI's 2K technology debuted but then abandoned the D-Cinema market while continuing to offer DLP-based projectors for non-cinema purposes. Although based on the same 2K TI &quot;light engine&quot; as those of the major players they are so rare as to be virtually unknown in the industry. They are still widely used for pre-show advertising but not usually for feature presentations.</paragraph><paragraph>TI's technology is based on the use of Digital Micromirror Devices (DMDs).<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.dlp.com/cinema/dlp-cinema/<space/></arg><arg name="title">What is Digital Cinema â€“ About Digital Theater - DLP Cinema Technology &#124; DLP â€“ Texas Instruments<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Dlp.com<space/></arg><arg name="date"><space/></arg><arg name="accessdate"></arg></template></extension><space/>These devices are manufactured from silicon using similar technology to that of computer memory chips. The surface of these devices is covered by a very large number of microscopic mirrors, one for each pixel, so a 2K device has about 2.2 million mirrors and a 4K device about 8.8 million. Each mirror vibrates several thousand times a second between two positions, in one light from the projector's lamp is reflected towards the screen, in the other away from it. The proportion of the time the mirror is in each position varies according to the required brightness of each pixel.</paragraph><paragraph>Three DMD devices are used, one for each of the primary colors. Light from the lamp, usually a Xenon similar to those used in film projectors with a power between 1&amp;nbsp;kW and 7&amp;nbsp;kW, is split by colored filters into red, green and blue beams which are directed at the appropriate DMD. The 'forward' reflected beam from the three DMMDs is then re-combined and focused by the lens onto the cinema screen.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Sony SXRD projectors</heading><paragraph>Alone amongst the manufacturers of DCI-compliant cinema projectors Sony decided to develop its own technology rather than use TI's DLP technology. SXRD projectors have only ever been manufactured in 4K form and, until the launch of the 4K DLP chip by TI, Sony SXRD projectors were the only 4K DCI-compatible projectors on the market. Unlike DLP projectors, however, SXRD projectors do not present the left and right eye images of stereoscopic movies sequentially but use half the available area on the SXRD chip for each eye image. Thus during stereoscopic presentations the SXRD projector functions as a sub 2K projector, the same for HFR 3D Content.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="author">SRX-R515P<space/></arg><arg name="url">http://www.sony.co.uk/pro/product/dcinemaproj/srx-r515/specifications#specifications<space/></arg><arg name="title">SRX-R515P (SRXR515P) : Specifications : United Kingdom : Sony Professional<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Sony.co.uk<space/></arg><arg name="date"><space/></arg><arg name="accessdate"></arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Stereo 3D images</heading><paragraph>In late 2005, interest in digital 3-D<space/><link><target>stereoscopy</target><part>stereoscopic</part></link><space/>projection led to a new willingness on the part of theaters to co-operate in installing 2K stereo installations to show Disney's<space/><italics><link><target>Chicken Little (2005 film)</target><part>Chicken Little</part></link></italics><space/>in<space/><link><target>3-D film</target></link>.
