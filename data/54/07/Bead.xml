The earliest beads were made of a variety of natural materials which, after they were gathered, could be readily drilled and shaped. As humans became capable of obtaining and working with more difficult materials, those materials were added to the range of available substances. More recently, synthetic materials were added.</paragraph><paragraph>In modern manufacturing, the most common bead materials are wood,<space/><link><target>plastic</target></link>,<space/><link><target>glass</target></link>,<space/><link><target>metal</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Rock (geology)</target><part>stone</part></link>.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Natural materials</heading><paragraph>Beads are still made from many naturally occurring materials, both organic (i.e., of<space/><link><target>animal</target></link>- or<space/><link><target>plant</target></link>-based origin) and inorganic (purely<space/><link><target>mineral</target></link><space/>origin).
