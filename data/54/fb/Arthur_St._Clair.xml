Chaos ruled the day in early 1787 with<space/><link><target>Shays' Rebellion</target></link><space/>in full force and the states refusing to settle land disputes or contribute to the now six-year-old federal government. On February 2, 1787, the delegates finally gathered into a quorum and elected St. Clair to a one-year term as<space/><link><target>President of the Continental Congress</target></link>. Congress enacted its most important piece of legislation, the<space/><link><target>Northwest Ordinance</target></link>, during St. Clair's tenure as president.

When the territory was divided in 1800, he served as governor of the<space/><link><target>Ohio Territory</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>As Governor, he formulated<space/><link><target>Maxwell's Code</target></link><space/>(named after its printer,<space/><link><target>William Maxwell (engraver)</target><part>William Maxwell</part></link>), the first written laws of the territory. He also sought to end Native American claims to Ohio land and clear the way for white settlement. In 1789, he succeeded in getting certain Indians to sign the<space/><link><target>Treaty of Fort Harmar</target></link>, but many native leaders had not been invited to participate in the negotiations, or had refused to do so. Rather than settling the Indian's claims, the treaty provoked them to further resistance in what is sometimes known as the &quot;<link><target>Northwest Indian War</target></link>&quot; (or &quot;Little Turtle's War&quot;). Mutual hostilities led to a campaign by General<space/><link><target>Josiah Harmar</target></link>, whose 1,500 militiamen were defeated by the Indians in October 1790.</paragraph><paragraph>In March 1791, St. Clair succeeded Harmar as commander of the<space/><link><target>United States Army</target></link><space/>and was commissioned as a<space/><link><target>major general</target></link>. He personally led a<space/><link><target>punitive expedition</target></link><space/>involving two Regular Army regiments and some militia. In October 1791 as an advance post for his campaign,<space/><link><target>Fort Jefferson (Ohio)</target></link><space/>was built under the direction of General Arthur St. Clair. Located in present-day<space/><link><target>Darke County</target></link><space/>in far western Ohio, the fort was built of wood and intended primarily as a supply depot; accordingly, it was originally named Fort Deposit. One month later, near modern-day<space/><link><target>Fort Recovery</target></link>, his force advanced to the location of Indian settlements near the headwaters of the<space/><link><target>Wabash River</target></link>, but on November 4 they were routed in battle by a tribal confederation led by<space/><link><target>Miami tribe</target><part>Miami</part></link><space/>Chief<space/><link><target>Little Turtle</target></link><space/>and Shawnee chief<space/><link><target>Blue Jacket</target></link>. More than 600 soldiers and scores of women and children were killed in the battle, which has since borne the name &quot;<link><target>St. Clair's Defeat</target></link>&quot;, also known as the &quot;Battle of the Wabash&quot;, the &quot;Columbia Massacre,&quot; or the &quot;Battle of a Thousand Slain&quot;. It remains the greatest defeat of a US Army by Native Americans in history, with about 623 American soldiers killed in action and about 50 Native Americans killed. Although an investigation exonerated him, St. Clair resigned his army commission in March 1792 at the request of President Washington, but he continued to serve as Governor of the Northwest Territory.<extension extension_name='ref'>Leroy V.
