As 3D gaming grew, OpenGL developed to include better support for programming techniques for interactive multimedia applications like games, giving developers choice between using OpenGL or Direct3D as the 3D graphics API for their applications. At that point a &quot;battle&quot; began between supporters of the cross-platform OpenGL and the Windows-only Direct3D. Incidentally, OpenGL was supported at Microsoft by the DirectX team. If a developer chose to use OpenGL 3D graphics API, the other APIs of DirectX are often combined with OpenGL in<space/><link><target>computer games</target></link><space/>because OpenGL does not include all of DirectX's functionality (such as sound or joystick support).</paragraph><paragraph>In a console-specific version, DirectX was used as a basis for Microsoft's<space/><link><target>Xbox (console)</target><part>Xbox</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Xbox 360</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Xbox One</target></link><space/><link><target>video game console</target><part>console</part></link><space/>API. The API was developed jointly between Microsoft and<space/><link><target>Nvidia</target></link>, who developed the custom graphics hardware used by the original Xbox. The Xbox API was similar to DirectX version 8.1, but is non-updateable like other console technologies. The Xbox was code named DirectXbox, but this was shortened to Xbox for its commercial name.<extension extension_name='ref'>J.

Version 4 was to be a shorter-term release with small features, whereas version 5 would be a more substantial release. The lack of interest from game developers in the features stated for DirectX 4 resulted in it being shelved, and the corpus of documents that already distinguished the two new versions resulted in Microsoft choosing to not re-use version 4 to describe features intended for version 5.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="title"><space/>The Old New Thing

Hardware manufacturers have to write these drivers for a particular DirectX version's device driver interface (or DDI), and test each individual piece of hardware to make them DirectX compatible. Some hardware devices have only DirectX compatible drivers (in other words, one must install DirectX in order to use that hardware). Early versions of DirectX included an up-to-date library of all of the DirectX compatible drivers currently available. This practice was stopped however, in favor of the web-based<space/><link><target>Windows Update</target></link><space/>driver-update system, which allowed users to download only the drivers relevant to their hardware, rather than the entire library.</paragraph><paragraph>Prior to DirectX 10, DirectX runtime was designed to be<space/><italics>backward compatible</italics><space/>with older drivers, meaning that newer versions of the APIs were designed to interoperate with older drivers written against a previous version's DDI. The application programmer had to query the available hardware capabilities using a complex system of &quot;cap bits&quot; each tied to a particular hardware feature. Direct3D 7 and earlier would work on any version of the DDI, Direct3D 8 requires a minimum DDI level of 6 and Direct3D 9 requires a minimum DDI level of 7.<extension extension_name='ref' name="MSDN"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="last">MSN</arg><arg name="title">Minimum DDI requirements</arg><arg name="url">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb219840(v</arg><arg name="publisher">Microsoft</arg><arg name="accessdate">2 August 2012</arg></template></extension>However, the Direct3D 10 runtime in Windows Vista cannot run on older hardware drivers due to the significantly updated DDI, which requires a unified feature set and abandons the use of &quot;cap bits&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Direct3D 10.1</target></link><space/>introduces &quot;<link><target>Direct3D#Feature levels</target><part>feature levels</part></link>&quot; 10_0 and 10_1, which allow use of only the hardware features defined in the specified version of Direct3D API.<space/><link><target>Direct3D 11</target></link><space/>adds level 11_0 and &quot;10 Level 9&quot; - a subset of the Direct3D 10 API designed to run on Direct3D 9 hardware, which has three feature levels (9_1, 9_2 and 9_3) grouped by common capabilities of &quot;low&quot;, &quot;med&quot; and &quot;high-end&quot; video cards; the runtime directly uses Direct3D 9 DDI provided in all WDDM drivers.

This API was known as &quot;<link><target>Managed DirectX</target></link>&quot; (or MDX for short), and claimed to operate at 98% of performance of the underlying native DirectX APIs. In December 2005, February 2006, April 2006, and August 2006, Microsoft released successive updates to this library, culminating in a beta version called Managed DirectX 2.0. While Managed DirectX 2.0 consolidated functionality that had previously been scattered over multiple assemblies into a single assembly, thus simplifying dependencies on it for software developers, development on this version has subsequently been discontinued, and it is no longer supported. The Managed DirectX 2.0 library expired on October 5, 2006.</paragraph><paragraph>During the<space/><link><target>Game Developers Conference</target><part>GDC</part></link><space/>2006, Microsoft presented the<space/><link><target>Microsoft XNA</target><part>XNA Framework</part></link>, a new managed version of DirectX (similar but not identical to Managed DirectX) that is intended to assist development of games by making it easier to integrate DirectX,<space/><link><target>High Level Shader Language</target></link><space/>(HLSL) and other tools in one package.
