'''Édouard Manet''' ({{IPAc-en|US|m|æ|ˈ|n|eɪ}} or {{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|m|æ|n|eɪ}}; {{IPA-fr|edwaʁ manɛ|lang}}; 23 January 1832 – 30 April 1883) was a [[French people|French]] [[painter]]. He was one of the first 19th-century artists to paint modern life, and a pivotal figure in the transition from [[realism (arts)|Realism]] to [[Impressionism]].

His early masterworks, ''[[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe|The Luncheon on the Grass (Le déjeuner sur l'herbe)]]'' and ''[[Olympia (painting)|Olympia]]'', both 1863, caused great controversy and served as rallying points for the young painters who would create Impressionism. Today, these are considered watershed paintings that mark the genesis of [[modern art]].

==Biography==
Born into an upper-class household with strong political connections, Manet rejected the future originally envisioned for him, and became engrossed in the world of painting. He married [[Suzanne Manet|Suzanne Leenhoff]] in 1863. The last 20 years of Manet's life saw him form bonds with other great artists of the time, and develop his own style that would be heralded as innovative and serve as a major influence for future painters.

===Early life===
[[File:Manet par Fantin-Latour.jpg|thumb|left|Manet's portrait painted by  [[Fantin-Latour]]]]
Édouard Manet was born in Paris on 23 January 1832, in the ancestral [[hôtel particulier]] (mansion) on the [[rue Bonaparte]]{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} to an affluent and well-connected family. His mother, Eugénie-Desirée Fournier, was the daughter of a diplomat and goddaughter of the Swedish crown prince [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Charles Bernadotte]], from whom the Swedish monarchs are descended. His father, Auguste Manet, was a French judge who expected Édouard to pursue a career in law. His uncle, Edmond Fournier, encouraged him to pursue painting and took young Manet to the [[Louvre]].<ref name = "King"/> In 1841 he enrolled at secondary school, the [[Collège Rollin]]. In 1845, at the advice of his uncle, Manet enrolled in a special course of drawing where he met [[Antonin Proust]], future Minister of Fine Arts and subsequent lifelong friend.

At his father's suggestion, in 1848 he sailed on a training vessel to [[Rio de Janeiro]]. After he twice failed the examination to join the [[French Navy|Navy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/mane/hd_mane.htm |title=Édouard Manet |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|date= |accessdate=2013-07-22}}</ref> his father relented to his wishes to pursue an art education. From 1850 to 1856, Manet studied under the academic painter [[Thomas Couture]]. In his spare time, Manet copied the [[Old Master|old masters]] in the Louvre.

From 1853 to 1856, Manet visited Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands, during which time he was influenced by the Dutch painter [[Frans Hals]], and the Spanish artists [[Diego Velázquez]] and [[Francisco Goya|Francisco José de Goya]].

In 1856, Manet opened a studio. His style in this period was characterized by loose brush strokes, simplification of details and the suppression of transitional tones. Adopting the current style of [[realism (arts)|realism]] initiated by [[Gustave Courbet]], he painted ''The Absinthe Drinker'' (1858–59) and other contemporary subjects such as beggars, singers, Gypsies, people in cafés, and bullfights. After his early career, he rarely painted religious, mythological, or historical subjects; examples include his ''Christ Mocked'', now in the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], and ''Christ with Angels'', in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York. Manet had two canvases accepted at the Salon in 1861. A portrait of his mother and father, who at the time was paralysed and robbed of speech by a stroke, was ill received by critics. The other, ''The Spanish Singer'', was admired by [[Theophile Gautier]], and placed in a more conspicuous location as a result of its popularity with Salon-goers. Manet's work, which appeared  "slightly slapdash" when compared with the meticulous style of so many other Salon paintings, intrigued some young artists. ''The Spanish Singer'', painted in a "strange new fashion [-] caused many painters' eyes to open and their jaws to drop."<ref>Ross King, The Judgement of Paris, p.20-21, from Fernand Desnoyers, Le Salon des Refusés, 1863</ref>

===''Music in the Tuileries''===
{{main|Music in the Tuileries}}
[[File:MANET - Música en las Tullerías (National Gallery, Londres, 1862).jpg|thumb|''[[Music in the Tuileries]]'', 1862]]
''Music in the Tuileries'' is an early example of Manet's painterly style. Inspired by Hals and Velázquez, it is a harbinger of his lifelong interest in the subject of leisure.

While the picture was regarded as unfinished by some,<ref name = "King"/> the suggested atmosphere imparts a sense of what the Tuileries gardens were like at the time; one may imagine the music and conversation.

Here, Manet has depicted his friends, artists, authors, and musicians who take part, and he has included a self-portrait among the subjects.

===''Luncheon on the Grass ''(''Le déjeuner sur l'herbe'')===
{{Main|Le déjeuner sur l'herbe}}
[[File:Edouard Manet - Luncheon on the Grass - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe|The Luncheon on the Grass]]'' (''Le déjeuner sur l'herbe''), 1863]]
A major early work is ''[[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe|The Luncheon on the Grass (Le déjeuner sur l'herbe)]]''. The [[Paris Salon]] rejected it for exhibition in 1863 but Manet exhibited it at the [[Salon des Refusés]] (Salon of the Rejected) later in the year. Emperor [[Napoleon III]] had initiated The Salon des Refusés after the Paris Salon rejected 2,783 paintings in 1863. Manet employed model [[Victorine Meurent]], his wife Suzanne, future brother-in-law Ferdinand Leenhoff, and one of his brothers to pose. Meurent also posed for several more of Manet's important paintings including ''Olympia''; and by the mid-1870s she became an accomplished painter in her own right.

The painting's juxtaposition of fully dressed men and a nude woman was controversial, as was its abbreviated, sketch-like handling, an innovation that distinguished Manet from Courbet. At the same time, Manet's composition reveals his study of the old masters, as the disposition of the main figures is derived from [[Marcantonio Raimondi]]'s [[engraving]] of the ''[[Judgement of Paris]]'' (c. 1515) based on a drawing by [[Raphael]].<ref name = "King"/>

Two additional works cited by scholars as important precedents for ''Le déjeuner sur l'herbe'' are ''[[Pastoral Concert]]'' (c. 1510, [[The Louvre]]) and ''[[The Tempest (painting)|The Tempest]]'' ([[Gallerie dell'Accademia]], Venice), both of which are attributed variously to Italian [[Renaissance]] masters [[Giorgione]] or [[Titian]].<ref>Paul Hayes Tucker, ''Manet's Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe'', Cambridge University Press, 1998, pp.12–14. ISBN 0-521-47466-3.</ref> ''The Tempest'' is an enigmatic painting featuring a fully dressed man and a nude woman in a rural setting. The man is standing to the left and gazing to the side, apparently at the woman, who is seated and breastfeeding a baby; the relationship between the two figures is unclear.<ref>[[John Rewald]], ''The History of Impressionism'', [[The Museum of Modern Art]], 4th revised edition 1973, (1st 1946, 2nd 1955, 3rd 1961), p.85. ISBN 0-87070-369-2.</ref> In ''Pastoral Concert'', two clothed men and a nude woman are seated on the grass, engaged in music making, while a second nude woman stands beside them.

===''Olympia''===
[[File:Edouard Manet - Olympia - Google Art Project 3.jpg|thumb|''[[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]]'', 1863]]
{{Main|Olympia (Manet)}}
As he had in ''Luncheon on the Grass'', Manet again paraphrased a respected work by a Renaissance artist in the painting ''[[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]]'' (1863), a nude portrayed in a style reminiscent of early studio photographs, but whose pose was based on [[Titian]]'s ''[[Venus of Urbino]]'' (1538). The painting is also reminiscent of [[Francisco Goya]]'s painting ''[[The Nude Maja]]'' (1800).

Manet embarked on the canvas after being challenged to give the Salon a nude painting to display.<!-- by whom? -->  His uniquely frank depiction of a self-assured prostitute was accepted by the Paris Salon in 1865, where it created a scandal. According to [[Antonin Proust]], "only the precautions taken by the administration prevented the painting being punctured and torn" by offended viewers.<ref>Neret, Gilles. ''Manet''. Taschen, 2003. p. 22. ISBN 3-8228-1949-2</ref> The painting was controversial partly because the nude is wearing some small items of clothing such as an orchid in her hair, a bracelet, a ribbon around her neck, and mule slippers, all of which accentuated her nakedness, sexuality, and comfortable courtesan lifestyle. The orchid, upswept hair, [[black cat]], and bouquet of flowers were all recognized symbols of sexuality at the time. This modern Venus' body is thin, counter to prevailing standards; the painting's lack of idealism rankled viewers. The painting's flatness, inspired by [[Ukiyo-e|Japanese wood block]] art, serves to make the nude more human and less voluptuous. A fully dressed black servant is featured, exploiting the then-current theory that black people were hyper-sexed.<ref name = "King"/> That she is wearing the clothing of a servant to a courtesan here furthers the sexual tension of the piece.

Olympia's body as well as her gaze is unabashedly confrontational. She defiantly looks out as her servant offers flowers from one of her male suitors. Although her hand rests on her leg, hiding her pubic area, the reference to traditional female virtue is ironic; a notion of modesty is notoriously absent in this work. A contemporary critic denounced Olympia's "shamelessly flexed" left hand, which seemed to him a mockery of the relaxed, shielding hand of Titian's Venus.<ref>Hunter, Dianne. ''Seduction and theory: readings of gender, representation, and rhetoric''. University of Illinois Press, 1989. p. 19. ISBN 0-252-06063-6.</ref> Likewise, the alert black cat at the foot of the bed strikes a sexually rebellious note in contrast to that of the sleeping dog in Titian's portrayal of the goddess in his Venus of Urbino.

"Olympia" was the subject of caricatures in the popular press, but was championed by the French avant-garde community, and the painting's significance was appreciated by artists such as [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Claude Monet]], and later [[Paul Gauguin]].

As with ''Luncheon on the Grass'', the painting raised the issue of prostitution within contemporary France and the roles of women within society.<ref name="King">Ross King.

===Life and times===
[[File:Edouard Manet - Berthe Morisot With a Bouquet of Violets - Google Art Project.jpg|right|thumbnail|upright|''[[Berthe Morisot with a Bouquet of Violets]]'', 1872]]
The roughly painted style and photographic lighting in these works was seen as specifically modern, and as a challenge to the Renaissance works Manet copied or used as source material. His work is considered 'early modern', partially because of the black outlining of figures, which draws attention to the surface of the picture plane and the material quality of paint.

He became friends with the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] [[Edgar Degas]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Alfred Sisley]], [[Paul Cézanne]] and [[Camille Pissarro]] through another painter, [[Berthe Morisot]], who was a member of the group and drew him into their activities. The grand niece of the painter [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]], Morisot had her first painting accepted in the [[Salon de Paris]] in 1864, and she continued to show in the salon for the next ten years.

Manet became the friend and colleague of Berthe Morisot in 1868. She is credited with convincing Manet to attempt [[plein air]] painting, which she had been practicing since she was introduced to it by another friend of hers, [[Camille Corot]]. They had a reciprocating relationship and Manet incorporated some of her techniques into his paintings. In 1874, she became his sister-in-law when she married his brother, [[Eugène Manet|Eugène]].

[[File:Manet Self-Portrait with Palette v3.jpg|left|thumbnail|upright|''[[Self-Portrait with Palette (Manet)|Self-Portrait with Palette]]'', 1879]]

Unlike the core Impressionist group, Manet maintained that modern artists should seek to exhibit at the [[Paris Salon]] rather than abandon it in favor of independent exhibitions. Nevertheless, when Manet was excluded from the International Exhibition of 1867, he set up his own exhibition. His mother worried that he would waste all his inheritance on this project, which was enormously expensive. While the exhibition earned poor reviews from the major critics, it also provided his first contacts with several future Impressionist painters, including Degas.

Although his own work influenced and anticipated the Impressionist style, he resisted involvement in Impressionist exhibitions, partly because he did not wish to be seen as the representative of a group identity, and partly because he preferred to exhibit at the Salon. [[Eva Gonzalès]] was his only formal student.

He was influenced by the Impressionists, especially Monet and Morisot. Their influence is seen in Manet's use of lighter colors, but he retained his distinctive use of black, uncharacteristic of Impressionist painting. He painted many outdoor ([[En plein air|plein air]]) pieces, but always returned to what he considered the serious work of the studio.

Manet enjoyed a close friendship with composer [[Emmanuel Chabrier]], painting two portraits of him; the musician owned 14 of Manet's paintings and dedicated his ''Impromptu'' to Manet's wife.<ref>Delage, R. ''Emmanuel Chabrier''. Paris: Fayard, 1999. Chapter XI examines in detail their relationship and the effects of each other on their work.</ref>

Throughout his life, although resisted by art critics, Manet could number as his champions [[Émile Zola]], who supported him publicly in the press, [[Stéphane Mallarmé]], and [[Charles Baudelaire]], who challenged him to depict life as it was. Manet, in turn, drew or painted each of them.

===Cafe scenes===
[[File:Edouard Manet - At the Café - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Cafe Concert'', 1878.  Scene set in the Cabaret de Reichshoffen on the Boulevard Rochechouart, where women on the fringes of society freely intermingled with well-heeled gentlemen.<ref>{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]]
 |url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/16473
 |title=At the Café}}</ref> The Walters Art Museum.]]

Manet's paintings of cafe scenes are observations of social life in 19th-century Paris. People are depicted drinking beer, listening to music, flirting, reading, or waiting. Many of these paintings were based on sketches executed on the spot. He often visited the Brasserie Reichshoffen on boulevard de Rochechourt, upon which he based ''At the Cafe'' in 1878. Several people are at the bar, and one woman confronts the viewer while others wait to be served. Such depictions represent the painted journal of a [[flâneur]]. These are painted in a style which is loose, referencing [[Frans Hals|Hals]] and [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], yet they capture the mood and feeling of Parisian night life. They are painted snapshots of [[bohemianism]], urban [[working people]], as well as some of the [[bourgeoisie]].

In ''Corner of a Cafe Concert'', a man smokes while behind him a waitress serves drinks. In ''The Beer Drinkers'' a woman enjoys her beer in the company of a friend. In ''The Cafe Concert'', shown at right, a sophisticated gentleman sits at a bar while a waitress stands resolutely in the background, sipping her drink. In ''The Waitress'', a serving woman pauses for a moment behind a seated customer smoking a pipe, while a ballet dancer, with arms extended as she is about to turn, is on stage in the background.

Manet also sat at the restaurant on the [[Avenue de Clichy]] called Pere Lathuille's, which had a garden in addition to the dining area. One of the paintings he produced here was ''Chez le père Lathuille'' (At Pere Lathuille's), in which a man displays an unrequited interest in a woman dining near him.

In ''Le Bon Bock'' (1873), a large, cheerful, bearded man sits with a pipe in one hand and a glass of beer in the other, looking straight at the viewer.

===Paintings of social activities===
[[File:Edouard Manet 053.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Races at Longchamp]]'', 1864]]

Manet painted the upper class enjoying more formal social activities. In ''Masked Ball at the Opera'', Manet shows a lively crowd of people enjoying a party. Men stand with top hats and long black suits while talking to women with masks and costumes. He included portraits of his friends in this picture.

His 1868 painting ''[[The Luncheon]]'' was posed in the dining room of the Manet house.

Manet depicted other popular activities in his work. In ''[[The Races at Longchamp]]'', an unusual perspective is employed to underscore the furious energy of racehorses as they rush toward the viewer. In ''Skating'', Manet shows a well dressed woman in the foreground, while others skate behind her. Always there is the sense of active urban life continuing behind the subject, extending outside the frame of the canvas.

In ''View of the International Exhibition'', soldiers relax, seated and standing, prosperous couples are talking. There is a gardener, a boy with a dog, a woman on horseback—in short, a sample of the classes and ages of the people of Paris.

===War===
[[File:Manet, Edouard - The Execution of Emperor Maximilian, 1867.jpg|thumb|''[[The Execution of Emperor Maximilian]]'', 1867. [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]. The least finished of three large canvases devoted to the execution of [[Maximilian I of Mexico]].]]
[[File:TheBaricade.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Barricade (Civil War)'']]

Manet's response to modern life included works devoted to war, in subjects that may be seen as updated interpretations of the genre of "history painting".<ref>Krell, Alan, ''Manet and the Painters of Contemporary Life'', page 83. Thames and Hudson, 1996.</ref> The first such work was the ''Battle of the Kearsarge and Alabama'' (1864), a sea skirmish known as the ''[[Battle of Cherbourg (1864)]]'' from the [[American Civil War]] which took place off the French coast, and may have been witnessed by the artist.<ref>Krell, pages 84–6.</ref>

Of interest next was the French intervention in Mexico; from 1867 to 1869 Manet painted three versions of the ''[[Execution of Emperor Maximilian]]'', an event which raised concerns regarding French foreign and domestic policy.<ref>Krell, pages 87–91.</ref> The several versions of the ''Execution'' are among Manet's largest paintings, which suggests that the theme was one which the painter regarded as most important. Its subject is the execution by Mexican firing squad of a Habsburg emperor who had been installed by [[Napoleon III]]. Neither the paintings nor a [[lithograph]] of the subject were permitted to be shown in France.<ref>Krell, page 91.</ref> As an indictment of formalized slaughter [[The Third of May 1808|the paintings look back]] to [[Francisco Goya|Goya]],<ref>Krell, page 89.</ref> and anticipate [[Picasso]]'s ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]''.

In January 1871, Manet traveled to [[Oloron-Sainte-Marie]] in the [[Pyrenees]]. In his absence his friends added his name to the "Fédération des artistes" (see: [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]]) of the [[Paris Commune]]. Manet stayed away from Paris, perhaps, until after the ''semaine sanglante'': in a letter to [[Berthe Morisot]] at [[Cherbourg]] (10 June 1871) he writes, ''"We came back to Paris a few days ago..."'' (the semaine sanglante ended on 28 May).

The Prints and Drawings Collection of the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)]] has a [[watercolour]]/[[gouache]] (''The Barricade'') by Manet, depicting a summary execution of [[Communards]] by Versailles troops based on a [[lithograph]] of the execution of [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian]]. A similar piece (''The Barricade''), oil on plywood, is held by a private collector.

On 18 March 1871, he wrote to his (confederate) friend [[Félix Bracquemond]] in Paris about his visit to [[Bordeaux]], the provisory seat of the French National Assembly of the [[Third French Republic]] where [[Émile Zola]] introduced him to the sites: ''"I never imagined that France could be represented by such doddering old fools, not excepting that little twit [[Adolphe Thiers|Thiers]]..."''<ref>Julliet Wilson-Bareau, ed., ''Manet by himself'', UK: Little Brown, 2004</ref>  If this could be interpreted as support of the Commune, a following letter to Bracquemond (21 March 1871) expressed his idea more clearly: ''"Only party hacks and the ambitious, the Henrys of this world following on the heels of the Milliéres, the grotesque imitators of the Commune of 1793..."'' He knew the communard Lucien Henry to have been a former painter's model and Millière, an insurance agent. ''"What an encouragement all these bloodthirsty caperings are for the arts! But there is at least one consolation in our misfortunes: that we're not politicians and have no desire to be elected as deputies"''.

===Paris===<!--Section linked from [[Victorine Meurent]]-->
Manet depicted many scenes of the streets of Paris in his works. The ''Rue Mosnier Decked with Flags'' depicts red, white, and blue pennants covering buildings on either side of the street; another painting of the same title features a one-legged man walking with crutches. Again depicting the same street, but this time in a different context, is ''Rue Mosnier with Pavers'', in which men repair the roadway while people and horses move past.

[[File:Edouard Manet - Le Chemin de fer - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left| ''The Railway'', 1873]]
''[[The Railway]]'', widely known as ''The Gare Saint-Lazare'', was painted in 1873. The setting is the urban [[landscape]] of Paris in the late 19th century. Using his favorite model in his last painting of her, a fellow painter, [[Victorine Meurent]], also the model for ''Olympia'' and the ''Luncheon on the Grass'', sits before an iron fence holding a sleeping puppy and an open book in her lap. Next to her is a little girl with her back to the painter, watching a train pass beneath them.

Instead of choosing the traditional natural view as background for an outdoor scene, Manet opts for the iron grating which "boldly stretches across the canvas"<ref>Gay, p. 106.</ref> The only evidence of the train is its white cloud of steam. In the distance, modern apartment buildings are seen. This arrangement compresses the foreground into a narrow focus. The traditional convention of deep space is ignored.

Historian Isabelle Dervaux has described the reception this painting received when it was first exhibited at the official Paris Salon of 1874: "Visitors and critics found its subject baffling, its composition incoherent, and its execution sketchy. [[caricature|Caricaturists]] ridiculed Manet's picture, in which only a few recognized the symbol of modernity that it has become today".<ref>Adams, Katherine H.; Michael L. Keene. ''After the Vote Was Won: The Later Achievements of Fifteen Suffragists''. McFarland, 2010. p. 37. ISBN 0-7864-4938-1.</ref> The painting is currently in the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=43340.0 |title=Art Object Page |publisher=Nga.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-07-22}}</ref>

Manet painted several boating subjects in 1874. ''Boating'', now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, exemplifies in its conciseness the lessons Manet learned from Japanese prints, and the abrupt cropping by the frame of the boat and sail adds to the immediacy of the image.<ref>Herbert, Robert L.

===Late works===
He completed painting his last major work, ''[[A Bar at the Folies-Bergère]] (Un Bar aux Folies-Bergère)'', in 1882 and it hung in the Salon that year.

In 1875, a book-length French edition of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "[[The Raven]]" included lithographs by Manet and translation by Mallarmé.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/dgkeysearchresult.cfm?parent_id=173889&word= |title=NYPL Digital Gallery &#124; Browse Title |publisher=Digitalgallery.nypl.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-22}}</ref>

In 1881, with pressure from his friend [[Antonin Proust]], the French government awarded Manet the [[Légion d'honneur]].

== Personal life ==
[[File:Manet-grave.jpg|thumb|upright|The grave of Manet at Passy]]
After the death of his father in 1862, Manet married [[Suzanne Manet|Suzanne Leenhoff]] in 1863. Leenhoff was a Dutch-born piano teacher of Manet's age with whom he had been romantically involved for approximately ten years. Leenhoff initially had been employed by Manet's father, Auguste, to teach Manet and his younger brother piano. She also may have been Auguste's mistress. In 1852, Leenhoff gave birth, out of wedlock, to a son, Leon Koella Leenhoff.

Eleven-year-old Leon Leenhoff, whose father may have been either of the Manets, posed often for Manet. Most famously, he is the subject of the ''[[Boy Carrying a Sword]]'' of 1861 (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). He also appears as the boy carrying a tray in the background of ''[[The Balcony (painting)|The Balcony]]''.<ref>Mauner, G. L., & Loyrette, H. ''Manet: the still-life paintings''. New York: H.N. Abrams in association with the American Federation of Arts, 2000. p. 66. ISBN 0-8109-4391-3.</ref>

Manet painted his wife in ''[[The Reading]]'', among other paintings.

== Death ==
In his forties Manet contracted [[syphilis]], for which he received no treatment.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} He also suffered from [[rheumatism]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} In the years before his death, he developed  [[Tabes dorsalis|locomotor ataxia]], a known side-effect of syphilis, which caused him considerable pain.<ref>"Manet, Édouard" in ''[[Benezit Dictionary of Artists]]''. Oxford Art Online. [[Oxford University Press]], accessed 23 November 2013. www.oxfordartonline.com.</ref>

In April 1883, his left foot was [[amputated]] because of [[gangrene]], and he died eleven days later in Paris. He is buried in the [[Passy Cemetery]] in the city.
