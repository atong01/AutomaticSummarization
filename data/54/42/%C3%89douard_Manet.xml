The orchid, upswept hair,<space/><link><target>black cat</target></link>, and bouquet of flowers were all recognized symbols of sexuality at the time. This modern Venus' body is thin, counter to prevailing standards; the painting's lack of idealism rankled viewers. The painting's flatness, inspired by<space/><link><target>Ukiyo-e</target><part>Japanese wood block</part></link><space/>art, serves to make the nude more human and less voluptuous.

She defiantly looks out as her servant offers flowers from one of her male suitors. Although her hand rests on her leg, hiding her pubic area, the reference to traditional female virtue is ironic; a notion of modesty is notoriously absent in this work.

Nevertheless, when Manet was excluded from the International Exhibition of 1867, he set up his own exhibition.
