Allen, 2001, p. 123</extension><space/>There is no clear answer to this question. There has only been one biography, written by Paul Allen, and this primarily covers his career in the theatre.<extension extension_name='ref' name="biography"></extension><space/>Ayckbourn has frequently said he sees aspects of himself in all his characters. For example, in<space/><italics><link><target>Bedroom Farce (play)</target><part>Bedroom Farce</part></link></italics><space/>(1975), he admitted to being, in some respects, all four of the men in the play.<extension extension_name='ref'>P. Allen, 2001, p. 155</extension><space/>It has been suggested that, after Ayckbourn himself, the person who is used the most in his plays is his mother, particularly as Susan in<space/><italics><link><target>Woman in Mind</target></link></italics><extension extension_name='ref'>P. Allen, 2001, p. 3</extension><space/>(1985).</paragraph><paragraph>What is less clear is how much influence events in Ayckbourn's life have had on his writing. It is true that the theme of marriages in various difficulties was heavily present throughout his plays in the early seventies, around the time his own marriage was coming to an end. However, by this time, he had also witnessed the failures of his parents' relationships as well as those of some of his friends.<extension extension_name='ref' name="auto"></extension><space/>Which relationships, if any, he drew on for his plays, is unclear. In Paul Allens biography, Ayckbourn is briefly compared to Dafydd and Guy in<space/><italics><link><target>A Chorus of Disapproval (play)</target><part>A Chorus of Disapproval</part></link></italics><space/>(1984). Both characters feel themselves in trouble, and there was speculation that Alan Ayckbourn himself may have felt himself to be in trouble. At the time, he had reportedly become seriously involved with another actress, which threatened his relationship with Heather Stoney.<extension extension_name='ref'>P. Allen, 2001, pp. 209210</extension><space/>But again, it is unclear whether this had any effect on the writing, and Paul Allen's view is that it is not current experience that Ayckbourn uses for his plays.</paragraph><paragraph>It could be that Ayckbourn had written plays with himself and his own issues in mind, but as Ayckbourn is portrayed as a guarded and private man,<extension extension_name='ref' name="biography"></extension><space/>it is hard to imagine him exposing his own life in his plays to any great degree. In the biography, Paul Allen wrote, regarding a suggestion in<space/><italics>Cosmopolitan</italics><space/>that his plays were becoming autobiographical: &quot;If we take that to mean that his plays tell his own life story, he still hasn't started.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="auto"></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Career</heading><heading level='3'>Early career and acting</heading><paragraph>On leaving school his theatrical career started immediately, with an introduction to Sir<space/><link><target>Donald Wolfit</target></link><space/>by his French master.<extension extension_name='ref'>P.
