</arg><arg name="quote">"During my brief connection with the Examiner, I put out large quantities of nonsense, both [[prose]] and [[Poetry|verse]], sounding the whole newspaper [[gamut]] from advertisements to editorials. In general quality 'Casey' (at least in my judgment) is neither better nor worse than much of the other stuff. Its persistent vogue is simply unaccountable, and it would be hard to say, all things considered, if it has given me more pleasure than annoyance. The constant wrangling about the [[authorship]], from which I have tried to keep aloof, has certainly filled me with disgust."<ref name</arg><arg name="source">Ernest Thayer</arg></template>Thayer's last piece, dated June 3, 1888, was a ballad entitled &quot;Casey&quot; (&quot;Casey at the Bat&quot;) which made him &quot;a prize specimen of the<space/><link><target>One-hit wonder</target><part>one-poem poet</part></link>&quot; according to<space/><link><target>American Heritage (magazine)</target><part>American Heritage</part></link>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Gardner"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>It took several months after its publication for the poem to make Thayer famous, since he was hardly the boastful type and had signed the June 24 poem with the nickname &quot;Phin&quot; which he had used since his time on the<space/><italics>Lampoon</italics>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Almanac"></extension><space/>Two mysteries remain about the poem: whether anyone or anyplace was the real-life Casey and Mudville, and, if so, their actual identities.

However, late 1880s Boston star<space/><link><target>King Kelly</target><part>Mike &quot;King&quot; Kelly</part></link><space/>is odds-on the most likely model for Casey's baseball situations. Besides being a native of a town close to Boston, Thayer, as a<space/><italics>San Francisco Examiner</italics><space/>baseball reporter in the offseason of 188788, covered exhibition games featuring Kelly. In November 1887, some of his reportage about a Kelly at-bat has the same ring as Casey's famous at-bat in the poem. A 2004 book by Howard W. Rosenberg,<space/><italics>Cap Anson 2: The Theatrical and Kingly Mike Kelly: U.S. Team Sport's First Media Sensation and Baseball's Original Casey at the Bat,</italics><space/>reprints a 1905 Thayer letter to a Baltimore scribe who was asking about the poem's roots. In the letter, Thayer singled out Kelly (d. 1894), as having shown &quot;impudence&quot; in claiming to have written it. Rosenberg argues that if Thayer still felt offended, Thayer may have steered later comments away from connecting Kelly to it. Kelly had also performed in vaudeville, and recited the poem dozens of times, possibly, to Thayer's dismay, butchering it. Incidentally, the first public performance of the poem was on August 14, 1888, by actor De Wolf Hopper, on Thayer's 25th birthday.</paragraph><paragraph>Thayer's recitation of it at a Harvard class reunion in 1895 may seem trivial except that it helps solve the mystery, which lingered into the 20th century, of who had written it. In the mid-1890s, Thayer contributed several other comic poems for Hearst's<space/><italics>New York Journal</italics><space/>and then turned to overseeing his family's mills in Worcester full-time.</paragraph><paragraph>Thayer moved to<space/><link><target>Santa Barbara, California</target><part>Santa Barbara</part></link><space/>in 1912, where he married Rosalind Buel Hammett and retired.

I have heard many others give 'Casey.' Fond mamas have brought their sons to me to hear their childish voices lisp the poem, but Thayer's was the worst of all. In a sweet, dulcet Harvard whisper he implored 'Casey' to murder the umpire, and gave this cry of mass animal rage all the emphasis of a caterpillar wearing rubbers crawling on a velvet carpet.
