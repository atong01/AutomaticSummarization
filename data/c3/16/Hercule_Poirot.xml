This aspect of Poirot is less evident in the later novels, partly because there is rarely a narrator to mislead.</paragraph><paragraph>In<space/><italics>Murder on the Links,</italics><space/>still largely dependent on clues himself, Poirot mocks a rival &quot;bloodhound&quot; detective who focuses on the traditional trail of clues established in detective fiction (e.g., Sherlock Holmes depending on<space/><link><target>footprints</target></link>,<space/><link><target>fingerprint</target><trail>s</trail></link>, and cigar ash). From this point on, Poirot establishes his psychological bona fides. Rather than painstakingly examining crime scenes, he inquires into the nature of the victim or the psychology of the murderer. He predicates his actions in the later novels on his underlying assumption that particular crimes are committed by particular types of people.</paragraph><paragraph>Poirot focuses on getting people to talk. In the early novels, he casts himself in the role of &quot;Papa Poirot&quot;, a benign confessor, especially to young women. In later works, Christie made a point of having Poirot supply false or misleading information about himself or his background to assist him in obtaining information.<extension extension_name='ref'>&quot;It has been said of Hercule Poirot by some of his friends and associates, at moments when he has maddened them most, that he prefers lies to truth and will go out of his way to gain his ends by elaborate false statements, rather than trust to the simple truth.&quot;<space/><template><target>harvnb</target><arg>Christie</arg><arg>2011b</arg><arg name="loc"><space/>Book One, Chapter 9</arg></template></extension><space/>In<space/><italics>The Murder of Roger Ackroyd</italics>, Poirot speaks of a non-existent mentally disabled nephew<extension extension_name='ref'>E.g. &quot;After a careful study of the goods displayed in the window, Poirot entered and represented himself as desirous of purchasing a rucksack for a hypothetical nephew.&quot;<space/><italics>Hickory Dickory Dock</italics>, Chapter 13</extension><space/>to uncover information about homes for the mentally unfit.

According to Hastings, it was chosen by Poirot 'entirely on account of its strict geometrical appearance and proportion' and described as the 'newest type of service flat' (The Florin Court building was actually built in 1936, decades after Poirot fictionally moved in.) His first case in this period was &quot;The Affair at the Victory Ball&quot;, which allowed Poirot to enter high society and begin his career as a private detective.</paragraph><paragraph>Between the world wars, Poirot travelled all over Europe, Africa, Asia, and half of South America investigating crimes and solving murders.

In<space/><italics>The Nemean Lion</italics>, Poirot sided with the criminal, Miss Amy Carnaby, allowing her to evade prosecution by blackmailing his client Sir Joseph Hoggins, who, Poirot discovered, had plans to commit murder. Poirot even sent Miss Carnaby two hundred pounds as a final payoff prior to the conclusion of her dog kidnapping campaign. In<space/><italics>The Murder of Roger Ackroyd</italics>, Poirot allowed the murderer to escape justice through suicide and then withheld the truth to spare the feelings of the murderer's relatives. In<space/><italics>The Augean Stables</italics>, he helped the government to cover up vast corruption. In<space/><italics>Murder on the Orient Express</italics>, Poirot allowed the murderers to go free after discovering that twelve different people participated in Ratchett's murder. There was no question of his guilt, but he had been acquitted in America over a technicality. Considering it poetic justice that twelve jurors had acquitted Ratchett and twelve people had stabbed him, Poirot produced an alternate sequence of events to explain the death.</paragraph><paragraph>After his cases in the Middle East, Poirot returned to Britain.

Most of the cases covered by Poirot's private detective agency take place before his retirement to grow<space/><link><target>Squash (plant)</target><part>marrows</part></link>, at which time he solves<space/><italics>The Murder of Roger Ackroyd</italics>. It has been said that the twelve cases related in<space/><italics>The Labours of Hercules</italics><space/>(1947) must refer to a different retirement, but the fact that Poirot specifically says that he intends to grow marrows indicates that these stories also take place before<space/><italics>Roger Ackroyd</italics>, and presumably Poirot closed his agency once he had completed them. There is specific mention in &quot;The Capture of Cerberus&quot; of the twenty-year gap between Poirot's previous meeting with Countess Rossakoff and this one. If the<space/><italics>Labours</italics><space/>precede the events in<space/><italics>Roger Ackroyd</italics>, then the Ackroyd case must have taken place around twenty years<space/><italics>later</italics><space/>than it was published, and so must any of the cases that refer to it. One alternative would be that having failed to grow marrows once, Poirot is determined to have another go, but this is specifically denied by Poirot himself.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>harvnb</target><arg>Christie</arg><arg>2004a</arg><arg name="loc">Chapter 13</arg></template><space/>in response to the suggestion that he might take up gardening in his retirement, Poirot answers &quot;Once the vegetable marrows, yes but never again&quot;.</extension><space/>Also, in &quot;The Erymanthian Boar&quot;, a character is said to have been turned out of Austria by the<space/><link><target>Nazism</target><part>Nazis</part></link>, implying that the events of<space/><italics><link><target>The Labours of Hercules</target></link></italics><space/>took place after 1937. Another alternative would be to suggest that the Preface to the<space/><italics>Labours</italics><space/>takes place at one date but that the labours are completed over a matter of twenty years. None of the explanations is especially attractive.</paragraph><paragraph>In terms of a rudimentary chronology, Poirot speaks of retiring to grow marrows in Chapter 18 of<space/><italics>The Big Four</italics><template><target>sfn</target><arg>Christie</arg><arg>2004b</arg><arg name="loc">Chapter 18</arg></template><space/>(1927) which places that novel out of published order before<space/><italics>Roger Ackroyd</italics>. He declines to solve a case for the Home Secretary because he is retired in Chapter One of<space/><italics>Peril at End House</italics><space/>(1932). He is certainly retired at the time of<space/><italics>Three Act Tragedy</italics><space/>(1935) but he does not enjoy his retirement and repeatedly takes cases thereafter when his curiosity is engaged. He continues to employ his secretary, Miss Lemon, at the time of the cases retold in<space/><italics>Hickory Dickory Dock</italics><space/>and<space/><italics>Dead Man's Folly</italics>, which take place in the mid-1950s. It is therefore better to assume that Christie provided no authoritative chronology for Poirot's retirement, but assumed that he could either be an active detective, a consulting detective, or a retired detective as the needs of the immediate case required.</paragraph><paragraph>One consistent element about Poirot's retirement is that his fame declines during it, so that in the later novels he is often disappointed when characters (especially younger characters) recognise neither him nor his name:</paragraph><paragraph><extension extension_name='blockquote'>&quot;I should, perhaps, Madame, tell you a little more about myself.

Beginning with<space/><italics>Three Act Tragedy</italics><space/>(1934), Christie had perfected during the inter-war years a subgenre of Poirot novel in which the detective himself spent much of the first third of the novel on the periphery of events. In novels such as<space/><italics>Taken at the Flood</italics>,<space/><italics><link><target>After the Funeral</target></link></italics>, and<space/><italics>Hickory Dickory Dock</italics>, he is even less in evidence, frequently passing the duties of main interviewing detective to a subsidiary character. In<space/><italics>Cat Among the Pigeons</italics>, Poirot's entrance is so late as to be almost an afterthought.
