Gregory's chronology of the events surrounding Clovis and Gundobad has been questioned by Bury, Shanzer, and Wood, among others. Gregory was somewhat of a Frankish apologist, and commonly discredited the enemies of Clovis by attributing to them some fairly shocking acts. As with Godegisel, he also commonly refers to the treachery of Clovis' allies, when in fact Clovis seems to have bought them off (e.g., in the case of the Ripuarians).</extension><space/>This is contested by, e.g., Bury, who points out problems in much of Gregory's chronology for the events.</paragraph><paragraph>C.500, when Gundobad and Clovis were at war, Gundobad appears to have been betrayed by his brother Godegisel, who joined the Franks; together Godegisel's and Clovis' forces &quot;crushed the army of Gundobad.&quot; (Marius a. 500; Gregory, II, 32) Gundobad was temporarily holed up in Avignon, but was able to re-muster his army and sacked Vienne, where Godegisel and many of his followers were put to death. From this point, Gundobad appears to have been the sole king of Burgundy. (e.g., Gregory, II, 33) This would imply that his brother Gundomar was already dead, though there are no specific mentions of the event in the sources.</paragraph><paragraph>Either Gundobad and Clovis reconciled their differences, or Gundobad was forced into some sort of vassalage by Clovis' earlier victory, as the Burgundian king appears to have assisted the Franks in 507 in their victory over<space/><link><target>Alaric II</target></link><space/>the Visigoth.</paragraph><paragraph>During the upheaval, sometime between 483-501, Gundobad began to set forth the<space/><italics>Lex Gundobada</italics><space/>(see below), issuing roughly the first half, which drew upon the<space/><italics>Lex Visigothorum</italics>.
