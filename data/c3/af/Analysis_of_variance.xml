The structure of the additive model allows solution for the additive coefficients by simple algebra rather than by matrix calculations. In the era of mechanical calculators this simplicity was critical. The determination of statistical significance also required access to tables of the F function which were supplied by early statistics texts.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Motivating example</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Anova, no fit..png</target><part>thumb</part><part>No fit.</part></link><link><target>File:ANOVA fair fit.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Fair fit</part></link><link><target>File:ANOVA very good fit.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Very good fit</part><trail>The</trail></link><space/>analysis of variance can be used as an exploratory tool to explain observations. A dog show provides an example. A dog show is not a random sampling of the breed: it is typically limited to dogs that are adult, pure-bred, and exemplary. A histogram of dog weights from a show might plausibly be rather complex, like the yellow-orange distribution shown in the illustrations. Suppose we wanted to predict the weight of a dog based on a certain set of characteristics of each dog. Before we could do that, we would need to<space/><italics>explain</italics><space/>the distribution of weights by dividing the dog population into groups based on those characteristics. A successful grouping will split dogs such that (a) each group has a low variance of dog weights (meaning the group is relatively homogeneous) and (b) the mean of each group is distinct (if two groups have the same mean, then it isn't reasonable to conclude that the groups are, in fact, separate in any meaningful way).In the illustrations to the right, each group is identified as<space/><italics>X</italics><xhtml:sub>1</xhtml:sub>,<space/><italics>X</italics><xhtml:sub>2</xhtml:sub>, etc. In the first illustration, we divide the dogs according to the product (interaction) of two binary groupings: young vs old, and short-haired vs long-haired (thus, group 1 is young, short-haired dogs, group 2 is young, long-haired dogs, etc.). Since the distributions of dog weight within each of the groups (shown in blue) has a large variance, and since the means are very close across groups, grouping dogs by these characteristics does not produce an effective way to explain the variation in dog weights: knowing which group a dog is in does not allow us to make any reasonable statements as to what that dog's weight is likely to be. Thus, this grouping fails to<space/><italics>fit</italics><space/>the distribution we are trying to explain (yellow-orange).</paragraph><paragraph>An attempt to explain the weight distribution by grouping dogs as (pet vs working breed) and (less athletic vs more athletic) would probably be somewhat more successful (fair fit). The heaviest show dogs are likely to be big strong working breeds, while breeds kept as pets tend to be smaller and thus lighter. As shown by the second illustration, the distributions have variances that are considerably smaller than in the first case, and the means are more reasonably distinguishable. However, the significant overlap of distributions, for example, means that we cannot reliably say that<space/><italics>X</italics><xhtml:sub>1</xhtml:sub><space/>and<space/><italics>X</italics><xhtml:sub>2</xhtml:sub><space/>are truly distinct (i.e., it is perhaps reasonably likely that splitting dogs according to the flip of a coinby pure chancemight produce distributions that look similar).</paragraph><paragraph>An attempt to explain weight by breed is likely to produce a very good fit. All Chihuahuas are light and all St Bernards are heavy. The difference in weights between Setters and Pointers does not justify separate breeds. The analysis of variance provides the formal tools to justify these intuitive judgments. A common use of the method is the analysis of experimental data or the development of models. The method has some advantages over correlation: not all of the data must be numeric and one result of the method is a judgment in the confidence in an explanatory relationship.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Background and terminology</heading><paragraph>ANOVA is a particular form of<space/><link><target>statistical hypothesis testing</target></link><space/>heavily used in the analysis of experimental data. A test result (calculated from the<space/><link><target>null hypothesis</target></link><space/>and the sample) is called statistically significant if it is deemed unlikely to have occurred by chance,<space/><italics>assuming the truth of the null hypothesis</italics>. A statistically significant result, when a probability (<link><target>p-value</target></link>) is less than a threshold (significance level), justifies the rejection of the<space/><link><target>null hypothesis</target></link>, but only if the a priori probability of the null hypothesis is not high.</paragraph><paragraph>In the typical application of ANOVA, the null hypothesis is that all groups are simply random samples of the same population. For example, when studying the effect of different treatments on similar samples of patients, the null hypothesis would be that all treatments have the same effect (perhaps none). Rejecting the null hypothesis would imply that different treatments result in altered effects.</paragraph><paragraph>By construction, hypothesis testing limits the rate of<space/><link><target>Type I errors</target></link><space/>(false positives) to a significance level. Experimenters also wish to limit<space/><link><target>Type II errors</target></link><space/>(false negatives). The rate of Type II errors depends largely on too small of sample size, significance level (when the standard of proof is high, the chances of overlooking a discovery are also high) and<space/><link><target>effect size</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>The terminology of ANOVA is largely from the statistical<space/><link><target>design of experiments</target></link>. The experimenter adjusts factors and measures responses in an attempt to determine an effect. Factors are assigned to experimental units by a combination of randomization and<space/><link><target>Randomized block design</target><part>blocking</part></link><space/>to ensure the validity of the results.<space/><link><target>Blind experiment</target><part>Blinding</part></link><space/>keeps theweighing impartial. Responses show a variability that is partially the result of the effect and is partially random error.</paragraph><paragraph>ANOVA is the synthesis of several ideas and it is used for multiple purposes. As a consequence, it is difficult to define concisely or precisely.</paragraph><paragraph>&quot;Classical ANOVA for balanced data does three things at once:<template><target>ordered list</target><arg name="start">1

The statisticalsignificance of the experiment is determined by a ratio of two variances. This ratio is independent of several possible alterationsto the experimental observations: Adding a constant to all observations does not alter significance. Multiplying all observations by a constant does not alter significance. So ANOVA statistical significance result is independent of constant bias and scaling errors as well as the units used in expressing observations. In the era of mechanical calculation it was common to subtract a constant from all observations (when equivalent to dropping leading digits) to simplify data entry.<extension extension_name='ref'>Montgomery (2001, Section 3-3: Experiments with a single factor: The analysis of variance; Analysis of the fixed effects model)</extension><extension extension_name='ref'>Cochran &amp; Cox (1992, p 2 example)</extension><space/>This is an example of data<link><target>Coding (social sciences)</target><part>coding</part></link>.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Logic of ANOVA</heading><paragraph>The calculations of ANOVA can be characterized as computing a numberof means and variances, dividing two variances and comparing the ratio to a handbook value to determine statistical significance.
