Boitano's new programs were received with standing ovations by the audience. Although Orser won the competition, Boitano skated clean, landing seven triple jumps, including a footwork section into a jump. Boitano, Leaver, and Bezic were so confident about the strength of Boitano's new programs that they omitted the quadruple toe loop, which if landed, could have put him a shoulder above Orser in technical merit.</paragraph><paragraph>The short program at the 1988<space/><link><target>United States Figure Skating Championships</target></link><space/>proved to be a highlight. Boitano received marks of 6.0 from eight of the nine judges for presentation, the second mark.
