This mutation also interferes with fat deposition, resulting in very lean meat.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Kambadur"></extension><space/>The truncated myostatin gene is unable to function in its normal capacity, resulting in accelerated lean muscle growth. Muscle growth is due primarily to physiological changes in the animal's muscle cells (fibers) from hypertrophy to a hyperplasia mode of growth. This particular type of growth is seen early in the fetus of a pregnant dam, which results in a calf that is born with two times the number of muscle fibers at birth than a calf with no myostatin gene mutation.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Kambadur"></extension><space/>In addition a new born double-muscled calfs birth weight compared to a normal calf is significantly greater.<extension extension_name='ref' name="De Smet"><template><target>cite journal</target><arg name="last">De Smet</arg><arg name="first">S</arg><arg name="title">Double-Muscled Animals</arg><arg name="year">2004</arg><arg name="volume">Encyclopedia of Meat Sciences</arg><arg name="pages">396–402</arg><arg name="doi">10.1016/B0-12-464970-X/00260-9</arg><arg name="editor1-first">Werner Klinth</arg><arg name="editor1-last">Jensen</arg><arg name="publisher">Oxford: Elsevier</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Belgian Blue cattle have improved feed conversion ratio (FCR) due to lower feed intake compared to weight gain.<extension extension_name='ref' name="De Smet"></extension><space/>The ability for these animals to have improved FCR is due to an altered composition of body weight gain which includes increased protein and decreased fat deposition.<extension extension_name='ref' name="De Smet"></extension><space/>The Belgian Blues bone structure is the same as a normal cow, albeit holding a greater amount of muscle, which causes them to have a greater meat to bone ratio. These cattle have a muscle yield of about 20% more on average than cattle without the genetic myostatin mutation.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Kambadur"></extension><space/>Because of this breeds increased muscle yield a diet containing higher protein is required to compensate for the altered mode of weight gain.<extension extension_name='ref' name="De Smet"></extension><space/>During finishing this breed requires high-energy (concentrated) feeds, and will not yield the same results if put on a high-fiber diet.<extension extension_name='ref' name="De Smet"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The value of the double-muscling breed is due to their superior carcass characteristics. However with decreased fat content there is decreased marbling of meat, which means the meat tenderness is reduced. Conversely, the Belgian Blue's meat tenderness has been argued to be just as tender because there are a large number of smaller muscle fibers.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="reason">Argued by whom?</arg><arg name="date">July 2015</arg></template><space/>The Belgian Blue's meat cuts also have a lower collagen content, which allows the protein quality to be improved due to a higher yield of amino acids.<extension extension_name='ref' name="De Smet"></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Breed issues</heading><paragraph>Double-muscled cows can experience<space/><link><target>dystocia</target></link><space/>(a difficult birth), even when bred to normal beef bulls or dairy bulls, because of a narrower birth canal.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Cheville256"></extension><space/>In addition to the dams reduced pelvic dimensions, the calfs birth weight and width are increased, making parturition harder.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Kambadur"></extension><space/>The<space/><link><target>:wikt:neonatal</target><part>neonatal</part></link><space/>calf is so large that<space/><link><target>Caesarean section</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>are routinely scheduled for breeders.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Cheville256"><template><target>harvnb</target><arg>Cheville</arg><arg>1999</arg><arg name="p">256</arg></template></extension><space/><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="last">Educational Vet Video</arg><arg name="title">Video of Cow Caesarean Section</arg><arg name="url">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v</arg><arg name="work">VetPulse TV in Practice</arg><arg name="publisher">YouTube</arg><arg name="accessdate">30 December 2013</arg></template></extension><space/>The bulls testicular weight and<space/><link><target>semen</target></link><space/>quantity and quality have been observed as reduced, however this seems to be less of an issue when compared to the dam's difficulties in calving.<extension extension_name='ref' name="De Smet"></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Economic efficiency</heading><paragraph>The economics of breeding and raising Belgian Blue cattle are inconclusive because of complications experienced during parturition and metabolic demand for increased concentrated feeds.
