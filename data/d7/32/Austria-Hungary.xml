The State administration comprised all affairs having relation to rights, duties and interests &quot; which are common to all territories&quot;; all other administrative tasks were left to the territories. Finally, the communes had self-government within their own sphere.</paragraph><paragraph>To this division of the work of administration corresponded a three-fold organization of the authorities: State, territorial and communal. The State authorities were divided on geographical lines into central, intermediate and local, and side by side with this there was a division of the offices for the transaction of business according to the various branches of the administration. The central authorities, which as early as the 18th century worked together in a common mother cell of the State chancery, became differentiated so soon as the growing tasks of administration called for specialization; in 1869 there were seven departments, and in the concluding decade of the Austrian Empire there were set up Ministries of Labour, Food, Public Health and Social Care. Under these ministries came the Statthalter, whose administrative area had ordinarily the proportions of a Crown territory (<italics>Kronland</italics>); but the immense variations in area of the Crown territories made a uniform and consistent intermediate administrative organization practically impossible. The lowest administrative unit was the political sub-district (<italics>Bezirk</italics>) under an official (<italics>Bezirkshauptmann</italics>), who united nearly all the administrative functions which were divided among the various ministries according to their attributions.<extension extension_name='ref' name="ah1911"></extension></paragraph><paragraph><bold>Kingdom of Hungary</bold></paragraph><paragraph>In regard to local government, the country was divided into municipalities or counties, which possessed a certain amount of self-government. Hungary proper was divided into sixty-three rural, and&amp;mdash;including Fiume&amp;mdash;twenty-six urban municipalities (see section on Administrative Divisions). These urban municipalities were towns which for their local government were independent of the counties in which they were situated, and have, therefore, a larger amount of municipal autonomy than the communes or the other towns. The administration of the municipalities is carried on by an official appointed by the king, aided by a representative body. Since 1876 each municipality had a council of twenty members to exercise control over its administration. According to this division Hungary proper is divided into seven circles.</paragraph><paragraph>Besides these sixty-three rural counties for Hungary, and eight for Croatia-Slavonia, Hungary had twenty-six urban counties or towns with municipal rights.

The government then began to sell off large portions of track to private investors to recoup some of its investments and because of the financial strains of the<space/><link><target>Revolutions of 1848</target><part>1848 Revolution</part></link><space/>and of the<space/><link><target>Crimean War</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>From 1854 to 1879, private interests conducted almost all rail construction.

During this time, many new areas joined the railway system and the existing rail networks gained connections and interconnections. This period marked the beginning of widespread rail transportation in Austria-Hungary, and also the integration of transportation systems in the area. Railways allowed the empire to integrate its economy far more than previously possible, when transportation depended on rivers.</paragraph><paragraph>After 1879, the Austrian and the Hungarian governments slowly began to renationalize their rail networks, largely because of the sluggish pace of development during the worldwide<space/><link><target>depression (economics)</target><part>depression</part></link><space/>of the 1870s.

Most of this constituted &quot;filling in&quot; of the existing network, although some areas, primarily in the far east, gained rail connections for the first time. The railway reduced transportation costs throughout the empire, opening new markets for products from other lands of the Dual Monarchy.

They also joined the zone tariff system of the MV (Hungarian State Railways). By 1910, the total length of the rail networks of Hungarian Kingdom reached 22,869&amp;nbsp;km (14,210&amp;nbsp;mi), the Hungarian network linked more than 1,490 settlements. Nearly half of the empire's railways were built in Hungary, thus the railroad density there became higher than that of Cisleithania.

In addition, the two major shipping companies (Austrian Lloyd and Austro-Americana) and several shipyards were located there. The k.u.k. navy used the port's shipyards to construct new naval ships. This port grew as Venice declined. From 1815 to 1866, Venice was included within the monarchy and was prevented from competing with Austrian-ruled ports. The merchant marine did not develop until Venice's shipping interest declined. The navy became significant during the time of the k.u.k. monarchy, as industrialization and development provided sufficient revenues to develop it.</paragraph><paragraph>The most important seaport for the Hungarian part of the k.u.k. was Fiume (<link><target>Rijeka</target></link>, today part of Croatia), where the Hungarian shipping companies, such as the Adria, operated. The largest Hungarian shipbuilding company was the Ganz-Danubius. Another significant seaport was Pola (<link><target>Pula</target></link>, today part of Croatia)&amp;nbsp; especially for the navy. In 1889, the Austrian merchant marine consisted of 10,022 ships, with 7,992 fishing vessels. The coast and sea trade had a total of 1,859 sailboats with crews of 6,489 men and a load capacity of 140,838 tons; and 171 steamers with a load capacity of 96,323 tons and a crew of 3,199 men.</paragraph><paragraph>The first Danubian steamer company, Donau-Dampfschiffahrt-Gesellschaft (DDSG), was the largest inland shipping company in the world until the collapse of the k.u.k.

All governments faced difficult and divisive hurdles in deciding on the languages of government and of instruction. The minorities sought the widest opportunities for education in their own languages, as well as in the &quot;dominant&quot; languagesHungarian and German.

As stated above, the common army stood under the administration of the joint minister of war, while the special armies were under the administration of the respective ministries of national defence. The yearly contingent of recruits for the army was fixed by the military bills voted on by the Austrian and Hungarian parliaments, and was generally determined on the basis of the population, according to the last census returns. It amounted in 1905 to 103,100 men, of which Austria furnished 59,211 men, and Hungary 43,889. Besides 10,000 men were annually allotted to the Austrian Landwehr, and 12,500 to the Hungarian Honved. The term of service was two years (three years in the cavalry) with the colours, seven or eight in the reserve and two in the Landwehr; in the case of men not drafted to the active army the same total period of service was spent in various special reserves.</paragraph><paragraph>The common minister of war was the head for the administration of all military affairs, except those of the Austrian Landwehr and of the Hungarian Honved, which were committed to the ministries for national defence of the two respective states.

In performance of this promise a constitution was promulgated in 1910. This included a Territorial Statute (Landesstatut) with the setting up of a Territorial Diet, regulations for the election and procedure of the Diet, a law of associations, a law of public meetings, and a law dealing with the district councils. According to this statute Bosnia-Herzegovina formed a single administrative territory under the responsible direction and supervision of the Ministry of Finance of the Dual Monarchy in Vienna. The administration of the country, together with the carrying out of the laws, devolved upon the Territorial Government in Sarajevo, which was subordinate and responsible to the Common Ministry of Finance. The existing judicial and administrative authorities of the Territory retained their previous organization and functions. That statute introduced the modern rights and laws in Bosnia Herzegovina, and it guaranteed generally the civil rights of the inhabitants of the Territory, namely citizenship, personal liberty, protection by the competent judicial authorities, liberty of creed and conscience, preservation of the national individuality and language, freedom of speech, freedom of learning and education, inviolability of the domicile, secrecy of posts and telegraphs, inviolability of property, the right of petition, and finally the right of holding meetings.<extension extension_name='ref'>Rene Albrecht-Carrie,<space/><italics>A Diplomatic History of Europe Since the Congress of Vienna</italics><space/>(1973) pp&amp;nbsp;25972</extension></paragraph><paragraph>The Bosnian Diet (Sabor) set up consisted of a single Chamber, elected on the principle of the representation of interests.

Of these 20 consisted of representatives of all the religious confessions, the president of the Supreme Court, the president of the Chamber of Advocates, the president of the Chamber of Commerce, and the mayor of Sarajevo. In addition to these were 72 deputies, elected by three curiae or electoral groups. The first curia included the large landowners, the highest taxpayers, and people who had reached a certain standard of education without regard to the amount they paid in taxes. To the second curia belonged inhabitants of the towns not qualified to vote in the first; to the third, country dwellers disqualified in the same way. With this curial system was combined the grouping of the mandates and of the electors according to the three dominant creeds (Catholic, Serbian Orthodox, Muslim). To the adherents of other creeds the right was conceded of voting with one or other of the religious electoral bodies within the curia to which they belonged.<extension extension_name='ref' name="b1911"></extension></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Gavrilo Princip captured in Sarajevo 1914.jpg</target><part>right</part><part>thumb</part><part>250px</part><part>This picture is usually associated with the arrest of<space/><link><target>Gavrilo Princip</target></link>, although some<extension extension_name='ref' name="FinestoneMassie"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="author1">Jeffrey Finestone</arg><arg name="author2">Robert K.

When, after our déjeuner, I once again emphasized the gravity of the situation, His Majesty authorized me to report to [Franz Joseph] that in this case, too, we could count on Germany’s full support. As mentioned, he first had to consult with the chancellor, but he did not have the slightest doubt that Herr von Bethmann Hollweg would fully agree with him, particularly with regard to action on our part against Serbia. In his [Wilhelm’s] opinion, though, there was no need to wait patiently before taking action.
The Kaiser said that Russia’s stance would always be a hostile one, but he had been prepared for this for many years, and even if war broke out between Austria-Hungary and Russia, we could rest assured that Germany would take our side, in line with its customary loyalty. According to the Kaiser, as things stood now, Russia was not at all ready for war.

Food production fell, the transportation system became overcrowded, and industrial production could not successfully handle the overwhelming need for munitions. Germany provided a great deal of help, but it was not enough. Furthermore, the political instability of the multiple ethnic groups of Empire now ripped apart any hope for national consensus in support of the war. Increasingly there was a demand for breaking up Empire and setting up autonomous national states based on historic language-based cultures.

On the end of the decisive joint Italian, British and French<space/><link><target>Battle of Vittorio Veneto</target><part>offensive at Vittorio Veneto</part></link>, the disintegrated Austria-Hungary signed a general armistice in<space/><link><target>Padua</target></link><space/>on 3 November 1918.</paragraph><paragraph>The government had failed badly on the homefront.

These leftist or left-liberal pro-Entente maverick parties opposed the monarchy as a<space/><link><target>form of government</target></link><space/>and considered themselves internationalist rather than patriotic.

As it became apparent that the Allied powers of the<space/><link><target>British Empire</target></link>, France, Italy and the United States would win World War I, nationalist movements, which had previously been calling for a greater degree of autonomy for various areas, started pressing for full independence.

However the leaders of these national groups rejected the idea; they deeply distrusted Vienna and were now determined to get independence.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Poprava vdc rumbursk vzpoury 1918.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>240px</part><part>The revolt of ethnic<space/><link><target>Czechs</target><part>Czech</part></link><space/>units in Austria in May 1918 was brutally suppressed.

In an apparent attempt to demonstrate good faith, Charles issued a proclamation (&quot;Imperial Manifesto of 16 October 1918&quot;) two days later which would have significantly altered the structure of the Austrian half of the monarchy. The Polish majority regions of<space/><link><target>Galicia (Eastern Europe)</target><part>Galicia</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Lodomeria</target></link><space/>were to be granted the option of seceding from the empire, and it was understood that they would join their ethnic brethren in Russia and Germany in resurrecting a Polish state. The rest of<space/><link><target>Cisleithania</target></link><space/>was transformed into a federal union composed of four partsGerman, Czech, South Slav and Ukrainian. Each of these was to be governed by a national council that would negotiate the future of the empire with Vienna, and Trieste was to receive a special status. No such proclamation could be issued in Hungary, where Hungarian aristocrats still believed they could subdue other nationalities and maintain the &quot;Holy Kingdom of St. Stephen&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>It was a dead letter. Four days later, on 18 October United States Secretary of State<space/><link><target>Robert Lansing</target></link><space/>replied that the Allies were now committed to the causes of the Czechs, Slovaks and South Slavs. Therefore, Lansing said, autonomy for the nationalities&amp;nbsp; the tenth of the Fourteen Points&amp;nbsp; was no longer enough and Washington could not deal on the basis of the Fourteen Points any more. In fact, a<space/><link><target>Czechoslovakia</target><part>Czechoslovak provisional government</part></link><space/>had joined the Allies on 14 October. The South Slavs in both halves of the monarchy had already declared in favor of uniting with Serbia in a large South Slav state by way of the 1917<space/><link><target>Corfu Declaration</target></link><space/>signed by members of the<space/><link><target>Yugoslav Committee</target></link>, and the Croatians had begun disregarding orders from Budapest earlier in October.</paragraph><paragraph>The Lansing note was, in effect, the death certificate of Austria-Hungary. The national councils had already begun acting more or less as provisional governments of independent countries. With defeat in the war imminent after the Italian offensive in the<space/><link><target>Battle of Vittorio Veneto</target></link><space/>on 24 October, Czech politicians peacefully took over command in Prague on 28 October (later declared the birthday of Czechoslovakia) and followed up in other major cities in the next few days.

On the 29th of October, the Slavs in both portions of what remained of Austria-Hungary proclaimed the<space/><link><target>State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs</target></link>. They also declared their ultimate intention was to unite with Serbia and Montenegro in<space/><link><target>Kingdom of Yugoslavia</target><part>a large South Slav state</part></link>. On the same day, the Czechs and Slovaks formally proclaimed the establishment of Czechoslovakia as an independent state. Charles' last Hungarian prime minister,<space/><link><target>Mihly Krolyi</target></link>, terminated the personal union with Austria on 31 October, officially dissolving the Austro-Hungarian state. By the end of October, there was nothing left of the Habsburg realm but its majority-German Danubian and Alpine provinces, and Charles' authority was being challenged even there by the German-Austrian state council.<extension extension_name='ref'>Watson,<space/><italics>Ring of Steel</italics><space/>pp 542-56</extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Consequences</heading><paragraph>Charles' last Austrian prime minister,<space/><link><target>Heinrich Lammasch</target></link>, concluded that Charles was in an impossible situation, and persuaded Charles that the best course was to relinquish, at least temporarily, his exercise of sovereign authority. On 11 November, Charles issued a proclamation in which he recognized Austria's right to determine the form of the state and renounced the right to participate in Austrian affairs of state. He also released the officials in Austria from their oath of loyalty to him. Two days later, he issued a similar proclamation for Hungary. However, he did not abdicate, remaining available in the event the people of either state should recall him. For all intents and purposes, this was the end of Habsburg rule.</paragraph><paragraph>In Austria and Hungary, republics were declared at the end of the war in November. The<space/><link><target>Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)</target><part>Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye</part></link><space/>(between the victors of World War I and Austria) and the<space/><link><target>Treaty of Trianon</target></link><space/>(between the victors and Hungary) regulated the new borders of Austria and Hungary, leaving both as small landlocked states. The Allies assumed without question that the minority nationalities wanted to leave Austria and Hungary, and also allowed them to annex significant blocks of German- and Hungarian-speaking territory. As a result, the<space/><link><target>First Austrian Republic</target><part>Republic of Austria</part></link><space/>lost roughly 60% of the old<space/><link><target>Austrian Empire</target></link>'s territory. It also had to drop<space/><link><target>Republic of German Austria</target><part>its plans for union with Germany</part></link>, as it was not allowed to unite with Germany without League approval. The<space/><link><target>Kingdom of Hungary (1920-1946)</target><part>restored Kingdom of Hungary</part></link>, which had replaced the republican government in 1920, lost roughly 72% of the pre-war territory of the<space/><link><target>Kingdom of Hungary</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>The decisions of the nations of the former Austria-Hungary and of the victors of the Great War, contained in the heavily one-sided treaties, had devastating political and economic effects. The previously rapid<space/><link><target>economic growth</target></link><space/>of the Dual Monarchy ground to a halt because the new borders became major economic barriers. All the formerly well established industries were designed to satisfy the needs of an extensive realm. As a result, the emerging countries were forced to make considerable sacrifices to transform their economies. The treaties created major political unease. As a result of these economic difficulties, extremist movements gained strength; and there was no regional superpower in central Europe.</paragraph><paragraph>The new Austrian state was, at least on paper, on shakier ground than Hungary. While what was left of Austria had been a single unit for over 700 years, it was united only by loyalty to the Habsburgs. By comparison, Hungary had been a nation and a state for over 900 years. However, after a brief period of upheaval and the<space/><link><target>Allies of World War I</target><part>Allies'</part></link><space/>foreclosure of union with Germany, Austria established itself as a federal republic. Despite the temporary<space/><italics><link><target>Anschluss</target></link></italics><space/>with<space/><link><target>Nazi Germany</target></link>, it still survives today.<space/><link><target>Adolf Hitler</target></link><space/>cited that all &quot;Germans&quot;, such as he and the other Austrians should be united with Germany, as all other Germans should.</paragraph><paragraph>Hungary, however, was severely disrupted by the loss of 72% of its territory, 64% of its population and most of its natural resources.

At state functions, the Austrian black-yellow and the Hungarian red-white-green tricolor were used.</paragraph><paragraph><xhtml:center><table style='border-collapse: collapse; border: 1px solid grey;'><tablerow><tablecell valign="top" align="left"><link><target>File:Austria-Hungary-flag-1869-1914-naval-1786-1869-merchant.svg</target><part>thumb</part><part>center</part><part></part></link><xhtml:br></xhtml:br>Naval ensign until 1918</tablecell><tablecell valign="top" align="left"><link><target>File:Flag of Austria-Hungary 1869-1918.svg</target><part>thumb</part><part>center</part><part></part></link><xhtml:br></xhtml:br>Civil ensign</tablecell><tablecell valign="top" align="left"><link><target>File:Naval Ensign of Austria-Hungary (1918).svg</target><part>thumb</part><part>center</part><part></part></link><xhtml:br></xhtml:br>Naval ensign of 1915 (not implemented)</tablecell><tablecell valign="top" align="left"><link><target>File:War flag of Austria-Hungary (1918).svg</target><part>thumb</part><part>center</part><part></part></link><xhtml:br></xhtml:br>War ensign (not implemented)</tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell valign="top" align="left"><link><target>File:Royal hungarian maritime flag.gif</target><part>thumb</part><part>center</part><part></part></link><xhtml:br></xhtml:br>Royal Hungarian maritime ensign</tablecell></tablerow></table></xhtml:center></paragraph><paragraph>Austria was represented by the black-yellow flag.
