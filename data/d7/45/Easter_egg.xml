Just so, too, when the Christian dies, the body is left in the grave, an empty shell, but the soul takes wings and flies away to be with God. Thus you see that though an egg seems to be as dead as a stone, yet it really has life in it; and also it is like Christ's dead body, which was raised to life again. This is the reason we use eggs on Easter. (In days past some used to color the eggs red, so as to show the kind of death by which Christ died,-a ''bloody'' death.)</arg><arg name="year">1878</arg><arg name="accessdate">7 April 2012</arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="url"><space/>http://books.google.com/books?id</arg><arg name="title"><space/>Christian belief and practice</arg><arg name="publisher">[[Heinemann (publisher)|Heinemann]]</arg><arg name="author"><space/>Gordon Geddes, Jane Griffiths</arg><arg name="quote">Red eggs are given to Orthodox Christians after the Easter Liturgy.

To give a pysanka is to give a symbolic gift of life, which is why the egg must remain whole. Furthermore, each of the designs and colors on the pysanka is likely to have a deep, symbolic meaning. Traditionally, the designs are chosen to match the character of the person to whom the pysanka is to be given.</paragraph><paragraph>At one time, in a large family by Maundy Thursday 60 or more eggs would have been completed by the women of the house. (The more daughters a family had, the more pysanky would be produced.) The eggs would then be taken to the church on Easter Sunday to be blessed, after which they were given away. Here is a partial list of how the pysanky would be used:</paragraph><list type='numbered'><listitem>One or two would be given to the priest.</listitem><listitem>Three or four were taken to the cemetery and placed on graves of the family.</listitem><listitem>Ten or fifteen were given to children or godchildren.</listitem><listitem>Ten or twelve were exchanged by the unmarried girls with the eligible men in the community.</listitem><listitem>Several were saved to place in the coffin of loved ones who might die during the year.</listitem><listitem>Several were saved to keep in the home for protection from fire, lightning and storms.</listitem><listitem>Two or three were placed in the mangers of cows and horses to ensure safe calving and colting and a good milk supply for the young.</listitem><listitem>At least one egg was placed beneath the bee hive to insure a good harvest of honey.</listitem><listitem>One was saved for each grazing animal to be taken out to the fields with the shepherds in the spring.</listitem><listitem>Several pysanky were placed in the nests of hens to encourage the laying of eggs.</listitem></list><paragraph>Everyone from the youngest to the oldest received a pysanka for Easter. Young people were given pysanky with bright designs; dark pysanky were given to older people.</paragraph><paragraph>A bowl full of pysanky was invariably kept in every home. It served not only as a colorful display, but also as protection from all dangers. Some of the eggs were emptied, and a birds head made of wax or dough and wings and tail-feathers of folded paper were attached. These doves were suspended before icons in commemoration of the birth of Christ, when a dove came down from heaven and soared over the child Jesus.</paragraph><paragraph>Many superstitions were attached to pysanky. Pysanky were thought to protect households from evil spirits, catastrophe, lightning and fires. Pysanky with spiral motifs were the most powerful, as the demons and other unholy creatures would be trapped within the spirals forever. A blessed pysanka could be used to find demons hidden in the dark corners of the house. Pysanky held powerful magic, and had to be disposed of properly. The eggshell had to be ground up very finely (and fed to chickens to make them good egg layers) or broken into pieces and tossed into a running stream. It was considered very bad luck to trample on a pysanka.<extension extension_name='ref'>, . (Folk Customs of Our People) : , 1993</extension></paragraph><paragraph>The color palette of traditional pysanky was fairly limited, and based on natural dyes. Yellow, red/orange, green, brown and black were the predominant colors. With the advent of aniline dyes in the 1800s, small amounts of blue and purple were sometimes added.

The Church adopted the custom, and regarded the eggs as the emblem of the resurrection, as is evinced by the [[benediction]] of [[Pope Paul V.]], about 1610, which reads thus: "Bless, O Lord! we beseech thee, this thy creature of eggs, that it may become a wholesome sustenance to thy faithful servants, eating it in thankfulness to thee on account of the resurrection of the Lord."
