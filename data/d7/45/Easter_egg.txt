==History==
[[File:Red Paschal Egg with Cross.JPG|thumb|Egg with [[Christian cross]], from the Greek Orthodox Monastery, [[Bolton]], [[Ontario]], Canada.]]

The practice of decorating eggshells is ancient, predating Christian traditions.<ref name=pre-Christian>{{cite book|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=S5BZAAAAYAAJ&q=decorating+eggs+pre-Christian&dq=decorating+eggs+pre-Christian&hl=en&sa=X&ei=cMpQU9XWO5WuyASAr4D4Dg&ved=0CGUQ6AEwBzgK|title= Wycinanki and pysanky: forms of religious and ethnic folk art from the Delaware Valley|publisher= University of Pittsburgh|author= Neil R.

The Christian custom of the Easter egg, however, can be traced as far back as the [[early Christians]] of [[Mesopotamia]], who stained eggs red in memory of the [[blood of Christ]], shed at [[crucifixion of Jesus|his crucifixion]].<ref name=History>{{cite book|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=TinZAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA558&dq=easter+egg+Christians+Mesopotamia&hl=en&sa=X&ei=LS2CT6yFM_Sy0AGNm73kBw&ved=0CGkQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&q=easter%20egg%20Christians%20Mesopotamia&f=false|title= Donahoe's Magazine, Volume 5|publisher=T.B. Noonan|quote=The early Christians of Mesopotamia had the custom of dyeing and decorating eggs at Easter. They were stained red, in memory of the blood of Christ, shed at His crucifixion. The Church adopted the custom, and regarded the eggs as the emblem of the resurrection, as is evinced by the benediction of Pope Paul V., about 1610, which reads thus: "Bless, O Lord! we beseech thee, this thy creature of eggs, that it may become a wholesome sustenance to thy faithful servants, eating it in thankfulness to thee on account of the resurrection of the Lord." Thus the custom has come down from ages lost in antiquity.)|year=1881|accessdate =7 April 2012}}</ref><ref name=Itihaas>{{cite book|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=CRvzTM0kev4C&pg=PA96&dq=In+many+countries+the+name+of+the+Christian+feast+we+call+Easter&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7ruAT-WLE6jo0QH6tdSLCA&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=In%20many%20countries%20the%20name%20of%20the%20Christian%20feast%20we%20call%20Easter&f=false|title= Welcome to the Church Year: An Introduction to the Seasons of the Episcopal Church|author=Vicki K.

The [[Roman Ritual]], the first edition of which was published in 1610 but which contains texts of much older date, has among the Easter Blessings of Food, along with those for lamb, bread, and new produce, the following [[blessing (Roman Catholic Church)|blessing]] for eggs:<ref name="History" /><ref name="Itihaas" /> {{quotation|Lord, let the grace of your blessing + come upon these eggs, that they be healthful food for your faithful who eat them in thanksgiving for the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with you forever and ever.<ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/prayer/roman2.txt The Roman Ritual. Part XI, Blessings and other sacramentals]</ref>}}

Although the tradition is to use dyed or painted chicken eggs, a modern custom is to substitute chocolate eggs, or plastic eggs filled with [[candy]] such as [[jelly bean]]s. These eggs can be hidden for children to find on Easter morning, which may be left by the [[Easter Bunny]]. They may also be put in a [[basket]] filled with real or artificial straw to resemble a [[bird nest|bird's nest]].

==Lenten tradition==
[[File:Uskršnja košarica2.jpg|thumb|Croatian [[Easter basket]]]]
[[File:Święcone2007.jpg|thumb|left|Blessing of Easter foods in [[Poland]]]]
The Easter egg tradition may also have merged into the celebration of the end of the privations of [[Lent]] in the West.
Historically, it was traditional to use up all of the household's eggs before Lent began.
Eggs were originally forbidden during [[Lent]] as well as on other traditional [[fasting|fast]] days in [[Western Christianity]] (this tradition still continues among the [[Eastern Christian Churches]]).
Likewise, in [[Eastern Christianity]], meat, eggs, and [[dairy]] are all prohibited during the [[Great Lent|Lenten fast]].

This established the tradition of [[Shrove Tuesday|Pancake Day]] being celebrated on [[Shrove Tuesday]]. This day, the Tuesday before [[Ash Wednesday]] when Lent begins, is also known as [[Mardi Gras]], a French phrase which translates as "Fat Tuesday" to mark the last consumption of eggs and dairy before Lent begins.

In the Orthodox Church, [[Great Lent]] begins on [[Clean Monday]], rather than Wednesday, so the household's dairy products would be used up in the preceding week, called [[Cheesefare Week]].

During Lent, since chickens would not stop producing eggs during this time, a larger than usual store might be available at the end of the fast if the eggs had not been allowed to hatch. The surplus, if any, had to be eaten quickly to prevent spoiling. Then, with the coming of Easter, the eating of eggs resumes.  Some families cook a special meatloaf with eggs in it to be eaten with the Easter dinner.<ref>http://www.rachaelray.com/recipes/easter-meatloaf</ref>

One would have been forced to hard boil the [[boiled egg|eggs]] that the chickens produced so as not to waste food, and for this reason the [[Spain|Spanish]] dish [[hornazo]] (traditionally eaten on and around Easter) contains hard-boiled eggs as a primary ingredient.
In [[Hungary]], eggs are used sliced in potato casseroles around the Easter period.

==Decoration and symbolism==
{{Main|Egg decorating||Pisanica (Croatian)|Pysanka|Święconka}}
[[File:Pasxalina abga.jpg|thumb|Easter eggs are traditionally dyed red to make [[red Easter eggs]], to symbolise the [[blood of Christ]]]]

[[File:Ostereier 9.JPG|thumb|Decorating eggs ]]
[[File:Easter eggs20100403 35.jpg|thumb||]]
In the Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches, Easter eggs are dyed red to represent the [[blood of Christ]], shed on the Cross, and the hard shell of the egg symbolized the sealed [[Holy Sepulchre|Tomb of Christ]] — the cracking of which symbolized his resurrection from the dead. Easter eggs are [[blessing|blessed]] by the priest at the end of the [[Paschal Vigil]] (which is equivalent to [[Holy Saturday]]), and distributed to the faithful. The egg is seen by followers of [[Christianity]] as a symbol of [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]: while being dormant it contains a new life sealed within it.<ref name="Meaning" /><ref name="Symbolism" />

Similarly, in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Poland]], the so-called [[święconka]], i.e. blessing of decorative baskets with a sampling of Easter eggs and other symbolic foods, is one of the most enduring and beloved Polish traditions on Holy Saturday.

During [[Paschaltide]], in some traditions the Pascal greeting with the Easter egg is even extended to the deceased. On either the second Monday or Tuesday of Pascha, after a [[memorial service (Orthodox)|memorial service]] people bring blessed eggs to the cemetery and bring the joyous [[paschal greeting]], "Christ has risen", to their beloved departed (see [[Radonitza]]).

Easter eggs are a widely popular symbol of new life in Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, Russia, Ukraine, and other [[Central Europe]]an countries' [[folklore|folk traditions]], which include concealing them in the garden for children to find, and making artificial eggs out of [[porcelain]] for ladies.<ref name=Anderson>Anderson, F.L.M., 1864, Seven Months' Residence in Russian Poland in 1868, London:Macmillan and Co.</ref>{{rp|45}} A batik (wax resist) process is used to create intricate, brilliantly colored eggs, the best-known of which is the Ukrainian [[pysanka]] and the Polish [[Pisanka (Polish)|pisanka]]. The celebrated [[Fabergé egg|Fabergé]] workshops created exquisite jeweled Easter eggs for the Russian Imperial Court. Most of these creations themselves contained hidden surprises such as clock-work birds, or miniature ships. A 27-foot (9&nbsp;m) sculpture of a pysanka stands in [[Vegreville]], [[Alberta]].

There are many other decorating techniques and numerous traditions of giving them as a token of friendship, love or good wishes. A tradition exists in some parts of the [[United Kingdom]] (such as [[Scotland]] and [[North East England]]) of rolling painted eggs down steep [[hill]]s on Easter Sunday. In the U.S., such an [[Easter egg roll]] (unrelated to an [[eggroll]]) is often done on flat ground, pushed along with a [[spoon]]; the Easter Egg Roll has become a much-loved annual event on the [[White House]] lawn. An [[Easter egg hunt]] is a common festive activity, where eggs are hidden outdoors (or indoors if in bad weather) for children to run around and find. This may also be a competition to see who can collect the most eggs.

When boiling eggs for Easter, a tan colour can be achieved by boiling the eggs with [[onion]] skins. Easter eggs are often dyed red through a process of boiling them with [[onion]] skins.<ref>[http://www.talerka.ru/recept/ukraine/krashanky/ Krashansky] Talerka.ru</ref> When boiling them with onion skins leaves can be attached prior to dying to create leaf patterns. The leaves are attached to the eggs before they are dyed with a transparent cloth to wrap the eggs with like inexpensive muslin or nylon stockings, leaving patterns once the leaves are removed after the dyeing process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/04/how-to-dye-easter-eggs-naturally-without-a-box-onion-skins-beets-cabbage.html|title=dye-easter-eggs-naturally-without-a-box-onion-skins-beets-cabbage|publisher=/www.seriouseats.com|accessdate=2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://natashaskitchen.com/2013/03/19/natural-easter-eggs-3-ways/|title=Natural Easter Eggs 3 Ways!/ with nylon stockings|publisher=natashaskitchen.com|accessdate=2014}}</ref> These eggs are part of [[Easter custom]] in many areas and often accompany other traditional [[Easter food]]s. [[Passover]] [[haminados]] are prepared with similar methods. A greater variety of colour was often provided by tying on the onion skin with different coloured woollen [[yarn]]. In the North of England these are called pace-eggs or paste-eggs, from a dialectal form of Middle English ''pasche''. They were usually eaten after an egg-jarping ([[egg tapping]]) competition. Natural colours are obtained by using various plants:
*''brown'': [[onion]] peels;
*''black'': [[oak]] or [[alder]] bark or the nutshell of [[walnut]];
*''golden'': the bark of young [[apple tree]] or the [[Calendula|marigold]] flower;
*''violet'': petals of the [[Malva|mallow]] flower;
*''green'': shoots of young [[rye]] or leaves of [[Vinca|periwinkle]];
*''pink'': [[beet]] juice.

In [[Italy]], chocolate eggs with a surprise inside have largely replaced the traditional Easter eggs.

An [[egg hunt]] is a game during which [[decorated egg]]s, real hard-boiled ones or artificial ones filled with, or made of [[chocolate]] [[candy|candies]], of various sizes, are hidden for children to find, both indoors and outdoors.<ref name="puritan">{{cite book| author= A.

In the [[North of England]], during Eastertide, a traditional game is played where hard boiled ''pace eggs'' are distributed and each player hits the other player's egg with their own. This is known as "[[egg tapping]]", "egg dumping" or "egg jarping". The winner is the holder of the last intact egg. The losers get to eat their eggs. The annual egg jarping world championship is held every year over Easter in Peterlee Cricket Club. It is also practised in Italy where is called Scuccetta (Mainly in Marche Region), Bulgaria, Hungary, Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Lebanon, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, Ukraine, and other countries. In parts of Austria, Bavaria and German-speaking Switzerland it is called ''Ostereiertitschen'' or ''Eierpecken''. In parts of Europe it is also called ''[[epper]]'', presumably from the German name ''Opfer'', meaning "offering" and in Greece it is known as ''[[tsougrisma]]''. In South [[Louisiana]] this practice is called Pocking Eggs<ref>{{cite web |title=Pocking eggs or la toquette |url=http://creolecajun.blogspot.com/2008/03/pocking-eggs-or-la-toquette.html|publisher=Creolecajun.blogspot.com |accessdate=2008-03-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=If Your Eggs Are Cracked, Please Step Down: Easter Egg Knocking in Marksville |url=http://www.louisianafolklife.org/LT/Articles_Essays/creole_art_egg_knocking.html |accessdate=2008-03-20}}</ref> and is slightly different. The [[Louisiana Creole people|Louisiana Creoles]] hold that the winner eats the eggs of the losers in each round.

The central European Slavic nations ([[Czechs]] and [[Slovaks]] etc.) have a tradition of gathering eggs by gaining them from the females in return of whipping them with a pony-tail shaped whip made out of fresh willow branches and splashing them with water, by the [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]]s called ''polivanja'', which is supposed to give them health and beauty.

[[Egg rolling]] is also a traditional Easter egg game played with eggs at Easter. In the United Kingdom, Germany, and other countries children traditionally rolled eggs down hillsides at Easter.<ref name="inventors">{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/estartinventions/a/easter_2.htm |title=Easter Eggs - Egg Rolling |publisher=Inventors.about.com |date=2012-04-09 |accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref> This tradition was taken to the [[New World]] by European settlers,<ref name="inventors"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wyrdology.com/festivals/easter/egg-rolling.html|title= Easter Eggs: their origins, tradition and symbolism|publisher=Wyrdology.com|accessdate=2008-03-15}}</ref> and continues to this day each Easter on the White House lawn.

The [[Pace Egg play]]s are traditional village plays, with a rebirth theme. The drama takes the form of a combat between the hero and villain, in which the hero is killed and brought to life, The plays take place in England during Easter.

In some [[Mediterranean]] countries, especially in [[Lebanon]], chicken eggs are boiled and decorated by dye and/or painting and used as decoration around the house. Then, on [[Easter Day]], young kids would duel with them saying 'Christ is resurrected, Indeed He is', breaking and eating them. This also happens in [[Bulgaria]], Macedonia, Serbia, Russia, Ukraine, [[Greece]] and [[Cyprus]] (where the eggs are painted red). In Easter Sunday friends and family hit each other's egg with their own. The one whose egg does not break is believed to be in for good luck in the future.

In Germany, eggs decorate trees and bushes as [[Easter egg tree]]s, and in several areas public wells as [[Osterbrunnen]].

In [[Egypt]], it's a tradition to decorate boiled eggs during [[Sham el-Nessim]] holiday, which falls every year after the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] [[Easter]].

[[Cascarón|Cascarones]], a Latin American tradition now shared by many US States with high Hispanic demographics, are an emptied and dried chicken egg stuffed with confetti and sealed with a piece of tissue paper. The eggs are hidden in a similar tradition to the American Easter egg hunt and when found the children (and adults) break them over each other's heads.

Each year 80 million easter eggs are sold in the UK alone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wasteconnect.co.uk/page.aspx?ID=36d6a9bc-a62a-4809-98cf-49dae76f2626|title=The End of Egg-cessive Easter Waste??|publisher=Waste connect |accessdate=15 April 2014}}</ref>

===Pysanky===
{{Main|Pysanky}}

[[File:Unfinished pysanka.jpg|thumb|Easter egg with the [[Paschal greeting]] "Christ is Risen!" ]]
[[File:Easter egg - Kroton 006.JPG|thumb|Polish [[drapanka]] style pysanka Easter eggs]]
A pysanka is a Ukrainian Easter egg, decorated using a wax-resist ([[batik]]) method. Many other eastern European ethnic groups decorate eggs using wax resistant batik methods for Easter. The word comes from the verb ''pysaty'', "to write", as the designs are not painted on, but written with [[beeswax]]. On Easter Sunday, families bring baskets with krashanky, pysanky, [[paska (bread)|paska]] and meat to be blessed. These are eaten upon returning home when the traditional fasting period is broken with a celebration.<ref name=krashanky>[http://books.google.com/books?id=WYjY3YcvlGkC&pg=PA13&lpg=PA13&dq=Krashanky&source=bl&ots=hJWk7igBUk&sig=dM0JkvKWrauqxTCuB3qRuMikU70&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bqpFU_HtD-Xk2QWWx4HwDA&ved=0CFoQ6AEwCg#v=onepage&q=Krashanky&f=false Ukrainian Egg Decoration: A Holiday Tradition] by Ann Stalcup</ref>

Pysanky are typically made to be given to family members and respected outsiders. To give a pysanka is to give a symbolic gift of life, which is why the egg must remain whole. Furthermore, each of the designs and colors on the pysanka is likely to have a deep, symbolic meaning. Traditionally, the designs are chosen to match the character of the person to whom the pysanka is to be given.

At one time, in a large family by Maundy Thursday 60 or more eggs would have been completed by the women of the house. (The more daughters a family had, the more pysanky would be produced.) The eggs would then be taken to the church on Easter Sunday to be blessed, after which they were given away. Here is a partial list of how the pysanky would be used:

# One or two would be given to the priest.
# Three or four were taken to the cemetery and placed on graves of the family.
# Ten or fifteen were given to children or godchildren.
# Ten or twelve were exchanged by the unmarried girls with the eligible men in the community.
# Several were saved to place in the coffin of loved ones who might die during the year.
# Several were saved to keep in the home for protection from fire, lightning and storms.
# Two or three were placed in the mangers of cows and horses to ensure safe calving and colting and a good milk supply for the young.
# At least one egg was placed beneath the bee hive to insure a good harvest of honey.
# One was saved for each grazing animal to be taken out to the fields with the shepherds in the spring.
# Several pysanky were placed in the nests of hens to encourage the laying of eggs.

Everyone from the youngest to the oldest received a pysanka for Easter. Young people were given pysanky with bright designs; dark pysanky were given to older people.

A bowl full of pysanky was invariably kept in every home. It served not only as a colorful display, but also as protection from all dangers. Some of the eggs were emptied, and a bird’s head made of wax or dough and wings and tail-feathers of folded paper were attached. These “doves” were suspended before icons in commemoration of the birth of Christ, when a dove came down from heaven and soared over the child Jesus.

Many superstitions were attached to pysanky. Pysanky were thought to protect households from evil spirits, catastrophe, lightning and fires. Pysanky with spiral motifs were the most powerful, as the demons and other unholy creatures would be trapped within the spirals forever. A blessed pysanka could be used to find demons hidden in the dark corners of the house. Pysanky held powerful magic, and had to be disposed of properly. The eggshell had to be ground up very finely (and fed to chickens to make them good egg layers) or broken into pieces and tossed into a running stream. It was considered very bad luck to trample on a pysanka.<ref>Воропай, Олекса. Звичаї Нашого Народу (Folk Customs of Our People) Київ: «Оберіг», 1993</ref>

The color palette of traditional pysanky was fairly limited, and based on natural dyes. Yellow, red/orange, green, brown and black were the predominant colors. With the advent of aniline dyes in the 1800s, small amounts of blue and purple were sometimes added. It is important to note that the meanings below are generalizations; different regions interpreted colors differently.
*'''Red''' - is probably the oldest symbolic color, and has many meanings. It represents life-giving blood, and often appears on pysanky with nocturnal and heavenly symbols. It represents love and joy, and the hope of marriage.
*'''Yellow''' - symbolized the moon and stars and also, agriculturally, the harvest. It is also associated with the sun.
*'''Blue''' - Represented blue skies or the air, and good health.
*'''White''' - Signified purity, birth, light, rejoicing, virginity.
*'''Green''' - the color of new life in the spring. Green represents the resurrection of nature, and the riches of vegetation.<ref>Manko, Vira. The Ukrainian Folk Pysanka L'viv, Ukraine: Svichado, 2005</ref>

==Legends==
[[File:Vasnetsov Maria Magdalene.JPG|thumb|upright|Maria Magdalene, 1899 by [[Viktor M. Vasnetsov]], depicted as one of the [[Myrrhbearers]].]]

===Christian traditions===
While the origin of Easter eggs can be explained in the symbolic terms described above, among followers of [[Eastern Christianity]] the [[legend]] says that [[Mary Magdalene]] was bringing cooked eggs to share with the other women at the tomb of Jesus, and the eggs in her basket miraculously turned bright red when she saw the risen Christ. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.melkite.org/Lent.htm |title=Traditions of Great Lent and Holy Week |publisher=Melkite Greek Catholic Eparchy of Newton |date= |accessdate=2012-09-24 }}</ref>

A different, but not necessarily conflicting legend concerns Mary Magdalene's efforts to spread the [[Gospel]]. According to this tradition, after the [[Ascension of Jesus]], Mary went to the Emperor of Rome and greeted him with "Christ has risen," whereupon he pointed to an egg on his table and stated, "Christ has no more risen than that egg is red."

The Church adopted the custom, and regarded the eggs as the emblem of the resurrection, as is evinced by the [[benediction]] of [[Pope Paul V.]], about 1610, which reads thus: "Bless, O Lord! we beseech thee, this thy creature of eggs, that it may become a wholesome sustenance to thy faithful servants, eating it in thankfulness to thee on account of the resurrection of the Lord."

Black|publisher= Church Publishing, Inc.|quote=The Christians of this region in Mesopotamia were probably the first to connect the decorating of eggs with the feast of the resurrection of Christ, and by the Middle Ages this practice was so widespread that in some places Easter Day was called Egg Sunday. In parts of Europe, the eggs were dyed red and were then cracked together when people exchanged Easter greetings. Many congregations today continue to have Easter egg hunts for the children after services on Easter Day.|date= 1 Jul 2004}}</ref>
In Greece, superstitions of the past included the custom of placing the first-dyed red egg at the home's [[iconostasis]] (place where icons are displayed) to ward off evil. The heads and backs of small lambs were also marked with the red dye to protect them.

===Parallels in other faiths===
[[File:Noruz1387.jpg|thumb|upright|Eggs at the Iranian [[Nowruz]]]]
The egg is widely used as a symbol of the start of new life, just as new life emerges from an egg when the chick hatches out.<ref name="fertility" />

Painted eggs are used at the Iranian spring holidays, the [[Nowruz]] that marks the first day of [[Spring (season)|spring]] or [[Equinox]], and the beginning of the year in the [[Persian calendar]]. It is celebrated on the day of the astronomical [[Northward equinox]], which usually occurs on March 21 or the previous/following day depending on where it is observed. The painted eggs are symbolizing fertility and are displayed on the Nowruz table, called [[Haft-Seen]] together with various other symbolic objects. There are sometimes one egg for each member of the family. The ancient [[Zoroastrians]] painted eggs for Nowruz, their New Year celebration, which falls on the [[Spring equinox]]. The tradition continues among Persians of [[Islam]]ic, [[Zoroastrian]], and other faiths today. The Nowruz tradition has existed for at least 2,500 years. The sculptures on the walls of [[Persepolis]] show people carrying eggs for Nowruz to the king.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The Neo-Pagan holiday of [[Wheel of the Year#Vernal Equinox (Ostara)|Ostara]] occurs at roughly the same time as Easter. While it is often claimed that the use of painted eggs is an ancient, pre-Christian component of the celebration of Ostara there are no historical accounts that the celebration of Ostara included this practice, apart from the [[Old High German lullaby]] which is believed by most to be a modern fabrication. Rather, the use of painted eggs has been adopted under the assumption that it might be a pre-Christian survival.

There are good grounds for the association between [[hare]]s (later termed [[Easter bunny|Easter bunnies]]) and [[eggs]], through folklore confusion between hares' forms (where they raise their young) and [[plover]]s' nests.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A18190677 |publisher=BBC.com|title=H2g2 - The Easter Bunny|accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref>

In [[Judaism]], a hard-boiled egg is an element of the [[Passover Seder]] (during the same time as Christian Holy Week), representing festival sacrifice. The children's game of hunting for the [[afikomen]] (a half-piece of matzo) has similarities to the Easter egg hunt tradition, by which the child who finds the hidden bread will be awarded a prize. In other homes, the children hide the afikoman and a parent must look for it; when the parents give up, the children demand a prize for revealing its location.

==Variations==
Easter eggs have inspired the form of many similar objects both precious and mundane, including [[chocolate egg]]s, monuments, and the famous [[Fabergé eggs]].<ref>[http://www.mieks.com/Faberge2/1885-Hen-Egg.htm Article on the first Hen egg]  {{wayback|url=http://www.mieks.com/Faberge2/1885-Hen-Egg.htm |date=20081016010630 }}</ref>

===Easter eggs for the visually impaired===
'''Beeping Easter eggs''' are Easter eggs that emit various clicks and noises so that visually impaired children can easily hunt for Easter eggs.

Some beeping Easter eggs make a single, high-pitched sound, while other types of beeping Easter eggs play a melody.<ref>{{cite news |last= Tillery |first= Carolyn |title= Annual Dallas Easter egg hunt for blind children scheduled for Thursday |work= [[The Dallas Morning News]]

Since 2008, the International Association of Bomb Technicians and Investigators (IABTI) have sponsored a nationwide charity campaign in the U.S., building beeping Easter eggs every year for visually impaired children.
