The '''brown bear''' (''Ursus arctos'') is a large [[bear]] distributed across much of northern [[Eurasia]] and [[North America]] and (with the [[polar bear]]) is the largest land-based predator on earth.<ref name="boddington">{{cite book | title = Fair Chase in North America | author = Boddington, Craig; illustrations by Carlson, Ken | publisher = [[Boone and Crockett Club]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-940864-47-9| page = 45 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Rri8xdwgdQ0C&pg=PA45}}</ref> 
There are several recognized subspecies within the brown bear species.

While the brown bear's range has shrunk and it has faced local extinctions, it remains listed as a [[least concern]] species by the [[IUCN]] with a total population of approximately 200,000. As of 2012, this and the [[American black bear]] are the only bear species not classified as threatened by the IUCN. However, the [[California golden bear|Californian]], [[Atlas bear|North African (Atlas bear)]], and [[Mexican grizzly bear|Mexican]] subspecies were hunted to extinction in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and many of the southern Asian subspecies are highly endangered. The smallest subspecies, the [[Himalayan brown bear]], is critically endangered, occupying only 2% of its former range and threatened by uncontrolled poaching for its parts.<ref>[http://www.euronews.com/2014/01/06/himalayan-brown-bears-now-critically-endangered/ Himalayan brown bears now critically endangered] 01-06-2014</ref> The [[Marsican brown bear]] in central [[Italy]] is believed to have a population of just 30 to 40 bears.

The brown bear's principal range includes parts of [[Russia]], [[India]], [[China]], [[Canada]], the [[United States]] (mostly [[Alaska]]), [[Scandinavia]] and the [[Carpathian]] region (especially [[Romania]]).<ref name=IUCN/><ref name="White">{{cite web|last=White|first=Paul|title=Brown Bear|url=http://www.transylvanianwildlifeproject.com/p/brown-bear.html|publisher=Transylvania Wildlife Project|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519162400/http://www.transylvanianwildlifeproject.com/p/brown-bear.html|archivedate=19 May 2013|accessdate=13 January 2014}}</ref> The brown bear is recognized as a national and state animal in several European countries. It is the most widely distributed of all bears.

==Evolution and Taxonomy==
The brown bear is sometimes referred to as the ''bruin'', from [[Middle English]]. This name originated in the fable, ''History of [[Reynard the Fox]]'', translated by [[William Caxton]], from [[Middle Dutch]] ''bruun'' or ''bruyn'', meaning ''[[brown]]'' (the color).<ref>American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. 2000.</ref> During the [[Old West]], the grizzly was termed "Old Ephraim" and sometimes as "Moccasin Joe".<ref name="rooseeltv">[http://www.fulltextarchive.com/page/Hunting-the-Grisly-and-Other-Sketches1/#p58 Hunting the Grisly and other Sketches]. FullTextArchive.com. Retrieved 15 September 2011.</ref>
The scientific name of the brown bear, ''Ursus arctos'', comes from the Latin "[[Ursus (disambiguation)|ursus]]", meaning "bear",<ref>Liddell, Henry George and Scott, Robert. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dursus "Ursus."] ''A Latin Dictionary''. Perseus Digital Library.</ref> and Άρκτος "arctos", from the Greek word for bear.<ref>Liddell, Henry George and Scott, Robert.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2315199 "Arktos."] ''A Greek-English Lexicon''. Perseus Digital Library.</ref>

There have been two ways that people have grouped brown bears, (1) by naming them by the region that they inhabit, and there are hundreds of brown bear names from this process. (2) Scientific [[taxonomy (biology)]] is the science of defining groups of biological organisms on the basis of shared characteristics and giving names to those groups. Both are valid ways to name bears.

===Generalized brown bear names and evolution===

Brown bears are thought to have evolved from ''[[Ursus etruscus]]'' in Asia.<ref name="evolution"/>  The brown bear Kurten believed to be "clearly derived from the Asian population of ''Ursus savini'' about 800,000 years ago; spread into Europe, to the New World."<ref name="Kurten 1976">{{cite book|last1=Kurten.|first1=Bjorn|title=The Cave Bear Story 1976|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York.|accessdate=19 March 2015}}</ref> The oldest fossils occur in China from about 0.5 [[mya (unit)|million years ago]].<ref name="evolution"/>  They entered Europe about 250,000 years ago, and North Africa shortly after.<ref name="evolution"/>  Brown bear remains from the Pleistocene period are common in the [[British Isles]], where it is thought they might have outcompeted [[cave bear]]s.<ref name="evolution"/>  The species entered Alaska 100,000 years ago, though they did not move south until 13,000 years ago.<ref name="evolution"/> It is speculated that brown bears were unable to migrate south until the extinction of the much larger ''[[Arctodus simus]]''.<ref name="geist"/>

Several paleontologists suggest the possibility of two separate brown bear migrations: grizzlies are thought to stem from narrow-skulled bears which migrated from northern Siberia to central Alaska and the rest of the continent, while Kodiak bears descend from broad-skulled bears from Kamchatka, which colonized the Alaskan peninsula.<ref name="evolution"/> Brown bear fossils discovered in Ontario, Ohio, Kentucky and Labrador show the species occurred farther east than indicated in historic records.<ref name="evolution">Bruce McLellan and David C. Reiner (1994). [http://www.bearbiology.com/fileadmin/tpl/Downloads/URSUS/Vol_9/McLellan_Reiner_Vol_9.pdf A Review of bear evolution] Int. Conf. Bear Res. and Manage. 9(1):85–96</ref>

===Scientific brown bear taxonomy===

There are many methods used by scientists to define bear [[species]] and [[subspecies]] as no one method is always effective. Genetic testing is now perhaps the most important way to scientifically define brown bear relationships and names. Generally genetic testing uses the word [[clade]] rather than species because a genetic test alone cannot define a [[biological species]]. Most genetic studies report on how closely related the bears are (or their [[Genetic distance]]). There are hundreds of obsolete brown bear subspecies, each with its own name, and this can become confusing; Hall (1981) lists 86 different types.<ref name=Harris>{{cite journal|last1=Harris|first1=Arthur H.|title=PLEISTOCENE VERTEBRATES OF ARIZONA, NEW MEXICO, AND TRANS-PECOS TEXAS.|date=2009|accessdate=24 May 2015}}</ref> The exact number of overall brown subspecies and its relationship to the [[polar bear]] remains in debate. The polar bear is a recent offshoot of the brown bear,<ref name="evolution"/> most likely from U. a. beringianus.

In North America, two [[ecotypes]] of the single species ''Ursus arctos horribilis'' are generally recognized—the coastal brown bear and the inland [[grizzly bear]]; these two types broadly define the range of sizes of all brown bear subspecies.

===Genetic clades===

"The genetic diversity of present-day brown bears (Ursus arctos) has been extensively studied over the years and appears to be geographically structured into five main clades."<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal|last1=Calvignac, S.; Hughes, S.; Tougard, C.; Michaux, J.; Thevenot, M.; Philippe, M.; Hamdine, W.; Hanni, C.|title=Ancient DNA evidence for the loss of a highly divergent brown bear clade during historical times.|journal=Mol. Ecol.|date=2008|volume=17|pages=1962–1970}}</ref>

===Brown bear names===
There is little agreement on the classification of brown bears because there are so many ways to name and group them.

Some systems have proposed as many as 90 subspecies,<ref name="Storer & Tevis 1955">{{cite book|last1=Storer|first1=T.I.|last2=Tevis|first2=L.P.|title=California Grizzly|date=1996-12-27|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, CA|isbn=0520205200|pages=335|url=http://www.amazon.com/California-Grizzly-Tracy-I-Storer/dp/0520205200|accessdate=18 March 2015}}</ref> while recent DNA analysis has identified as few as five clades.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bearinfo.org/YESFedRegister.pdf |title=Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Designating the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem Population of Grizzly Bears as a Distinct Population Segment; Removing the Yellowstone Distinct Population Segment of Grizzly Bears From the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife |accessdate=1 August 2006 |author=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |date=17 November 2006 |publisher=Federal Register / Vol. 70, No. 221 |pages=69854–69884 |format=PDF |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060825042929/http://www.bearinfo.org/YESFedRegister.pdf |archivedate = 25 August 2006}}</ref>

There are several recognized subspecies within the brown bear species. In North America, two types of the subspecies ''Ursus arctos horribilis'' are generally recognized—the coastal brown bear and the inland [[grizzly bear]]; these two types broadly define the range of sizes of all brown bear subspecies. An adult grizzly living inland in [[Yukon]] may weigh as little as {{convert|80|kg|abbr=on}}, while an adult coastal brown bear in nearby coastal [[Alaska]] living on a steady, nutritious diet of spawning [[salmon]] may weigh as much as {{convert|680|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name= Smith/> The exact number of overall brown subspecies remains in debate.

DNA analysis recently revealed that the brown bears in North America are genetically quite homogeneous except for the one subspecies [[Kodiak bear]] and the enigmatic [[ABC Islands Bears]] that have the [[mtDNA]] of the [[polar bear]] (''Ursus maritimus'').<ref name="Waits">{{cite journal | author = Waits, L.P. | year = 1998 | title = Mitochondrial DNA Phylogeography of the North American Brown Bear and Implications for Conservation | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 408–417 | doi = 10.1111/j.1523-1739.1998.96351.x|display-authors=etal}}</ref> As of 2005, 16 living global subspecies have been recognized.<ref>{{MSW3 Wozencraft | id =14000970 | pages = 588–589|heading = ''Ursus arctos''}}</ref><ref>[http://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search_value=180543 ''Ursus arctos''], ITIS</ref> The subspecies have been listed as follows:

====Hybrids====
{{Main|Grizzly–polar bear hybrid}}
A grizzly–polar bear hybrid (known as a ''pizzly bear'' or ''grolar bear'') is a rare [[ursid hybrid]] resulting from a union of a brown bear and a [[polar bear]]. It has occurred both in captivity and in the wild. In 2006, the occurrence of this hybrid in nature was confirmed by testing the [[DNA]] of a strange-looking bear that had been shot in the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[arctic]].<ref name="msn">{{cite news |url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/12738644/?GT1=8199 |title=Wild find: Half grizzly, half polar bear: Hunter bags what expert 'never thought would happen' in wild |agency=Associated Press |date=11 May 2006 |accessdate=14 May 2006}}</ref><ref name="mallet">{{cite journal |title=Hybridization, ecological races and the nature of species: empirical evidence for the ease of speciation |author=[[James Mallet]] |year=2008 |issue= 1506|pages=2971–2986 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0081 |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]] B |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/pap/Mallet08%20Phil%20Trans.pdf |volume=363 |pmid=18579473 |pmc=2607318}}</ref><ref name="barnosky">{{cite book |title=Heatstroke: Nature in an Age of Global Warming |author=Barnosky, Anthony D. |year=2009 |isbn=1-59726-197-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Di6SVZZjLAgC&pg=PA10|publisher=Island Press/Shearwater Books |location=Washington, DC}}</ref> Previously, the hybrid had been produced in [[zoo]]s, and was considered a "[[Cryptozoology|cryptid]]" (a hypothesized animal for which there is no scientific proof of existence in the wild).

These populations are divided into those carrying an eastern lineage (clade IIIa, Leonard et al. 2000), which is composed of Russian, northern Scandinavian and eastern European populations, and those carrying a western lineage (clade I, Leonard et al. 2000), which is composed of two subgroups, one believed to originate from the Iberian Peninsula, including southern Scandinavian bears and the Pyreneean populations; and the other from the Italian–Balkan peninsulas (Taberlet et al. 1994; see however Kohn et al. 1995). In addition, based on the subfossil record in northwestern Moldova and mitochondrial DNA data from modern populations, a Carpathian refuge has also been proposed (Sommer & Benecke 2005; Saarma et al. 2007)."<ref name=j1>{{Cite journal

The brown bear is the largest wild animal on the [[Iberian Peninsula]], although one of the smallest of the brown bears, weigh between {{convert|130|and|180|kg|lb|abbr=on}} as adults. Their fur varies from a pale cream color to dark brown, but always with a distinctively darker, nearly black tone at the paws and a yellowish tinge at the tip of each hair. The brown bear population is considered [[Endangered species|endangered]] in Spain.

The brown bear population in the [[Pyrenees]] stems mostly from bears reintroduced from [[Slovenia]], with one or two remaining original males.<ref name="La recuperació del rei dels boscos"/><ref name=j1/><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100213064125/http://www.fundacionosopardo.org/ficha.cfm?idArticulo=151 Cuántos osos hay y dónde viven].

==Description==
[[File:Bearclaw2.jpg|thumb|left|Brown bear claws are longer and less curved than those of black bears]]
[[File:Bear skull.jpg|thumb|left|Brown bear skull]]

===Color of brown bears===
Brown bears are often not brown. Brown bears have long, thick fur, with a moderately long mane at the back of the neck. In India, brown bears can be reddish with silver tips, while in China, brown bears are bicolored with a yellow-brown or whitish cape across the shoulders. North American grizzlies can be dark brown (almost black) to cream (almost white) or yellowish brown. Black hairs usually have white tips.<ref name="brown"/> The winter fur is very thick and long, especially in northern subspecies, and can reach {{Convert|11|to|12|cm|in|sigfig=1}} at the [[withers]]. The winter hairs are thin, yet rough to the touch. The summer fur is much shorter and sparser, and its length and density varies geographically.<ref name="soviet"/>

===Large claws for digging===
Brown bears have very large and curved claws, those present on the forelimbs being longer than those on the hind limbs. They may reach {{Convert|5|to|6|cm|in|sigfig=2}} and sometimes {{Convert|7|to|10|cm|in|sigfig=2}} along the curve.<ref name="soviet">[[#Heptner|Heptner]], "Sirenia and carnivora (Sea cows; Wolves and Bears)",</ref> They are generally dark with a light tip, with some forms having completely light claws.<ref name="soviet"/> Brown bear claws are longer and straighter than those of [[American black bear]]s (''Ursus americanus'').<ref name="brown">''Bear Anatomy and Physiology'' from Gary Brown's ''The Great Bear Almanac'', Lyons & Burford, Publishers, 1993</ref> The claws are blunt, while those of a black bear are sharp. Due to their claw structure, in addition to their excessive weight, adult brown bears cannot climb trees as can both species of black bear. The paws of the brown bear are quite large. The rear feet of adult bears have been found to typically measure {{convert|21|to|36|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, with huge Kodiak bears having measured up to {{convert|46|cm|in|abbr=on}} along their rear foot.<ref name="Hunter"/><ref name = "Wood">{{cite book | author = Wood, Gerald |url = | title =The Guinness Book of Animal Facts and Feats| year = 1983 | isbn = 978-0-85112-235-9}}</ref>

===Massive brown bear skulls and jaws===
Adults have massive, heavily built [[wikt:concave|concave]] skulls, which are large in proportion to the body. The forehead is high and rises steeply.<ref name="brown"/> The projections of the skull are well developed when compared to those of [[Asian black bear]]s (''Ursus thibetanus''): the latter have [[sagittal crest]]s not exceeding more than 19–20% of the total length of the skull, while the former have sagittal crests comprising up to 40–41% of the skull's length. Skull projections are more weakly developed in females than in males. The [[braincase]] is relatively small and elongated. There is a great deal of geographical variation in the skull, and presents itself chiefly in dimensions.<ref name="soviet"/> Grizzlies, for example, tend to have flatter profiles than European and coastal American brown bears.<ref name="living"/> Skull lengths of Russian bears tend to be {{Convert|31.5|to|45.5|cm|in|sigfig=3}} for males, and {{Convert|27.5|to|39.7|cm|in|sigfig=3}} for females. The width of the [[zygomatic arch]]es in males is {{Convert|17.5|to|27.7|cm|in|sigfig=2}}, and {{Convert|14.7|to|24.7|cm|in|sigfig=2}} in females.<ref name="soviet"/> Brown bears have very strong teeth: the [[incisors]] are relatively big and the [[canine teeth]] are large, the lower ones being strongly curved. The first three molars of the upper jaw are underdeveloped and single crowned with one root. The second upper molar is smaller than the others, and is usually absent in adults. It is usually lost at an early age, leaving no trace of the alveolus in the jaw. The first three molars of the lower jaw are very weak, and are often lost at an early age.<ref name="soviet"/> Although they have powerful jaws, brown bear jaws are incapable of breaking large bones with the ease of [[spotted hyena]]s (''Crocuta crocuta'').<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ecmjournal.org/journal/smi/pdf/smi99-37.pdf|title=Enamel microstructural specialization in the canine of the spotted hyena, ''Crocuta crocuta''|author=John M. Rensberger|journal=Scanning Microscopy|volume= 13|issue=2–3|year= 1999|pages=343–361}}</ref>

===Body size===
The size of brown bears is the most variable of modern bears. The typical size depends upon which population it is from. A large barren ground brown bear might seem quite small elsewhere.

The brown bear ([[grizzly bear]] in Europe, [[Yellowstone National Park]] or interior [[Alaska]]) seasonally weigh on average between {{convert|115|and|360|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Bears from the [[Yukon Delta]], interior [[British Columbia]], [[Jasper National Park]] and southern Europe can weigh from {{convert|55|to|155|kg|lb|abbr=on}} on average.<ref name= Smith/><ref>{{cite web|title=Brown Grizzly or Brown Bear (Ursus arctos)|url=http://www.nsrl.ttu.edu/tmot1/ursuarct.htm|publisher=Mammals of Texas- Online Edition |accessdate=14 June 2012}}</ref> Bears from the [[Syria]]n (''U. a. syriacus'') and the [[Gobi Desert]] (''U. a. gobiensis'') subspecies are around the same mass as the smaller Eurasian brown and grizzly bears and can exceptionally measure as small as {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} in head-and-body length.<ref name= Smith/> On the other end of the scale among interior brown bears, exceptional grizzly, Eurasian brown bears, and [[East Siberian brown bear]]s (''U. a. collaris'') have been weighed up to {{convert|680|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, {{convert|481|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and {{convert|600|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, respectively.<ref name = "Wood">{{cite book | author = Wood, Gerald |title =The Guinness Book of Animal Facts and Feats| year = 1983 | page = 256 | isbn = 978-0-85112-235-9}}</ref>

Interior brown bears are generally smaller than is often perceived, being around the same weight as an average [[African lion]] at an estimate average of {{convert|180|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in males and {{convert|135|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in females.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ursus arctos- Brown Bear species|url=http://wildpro.twycrosszoo.org/S/0MCarnivor/ursidae/ursus/Ursus_arctos/Ursus_arctos.htm#Measurement|publisher=Wildpro |accessdate=14 June 2012}}</ref>

The largest inland brown bear subspecies appears to be the [[Ussuri brown bear]] (''U. a. lasiotus''), likely the ancestor of the modern-day American grizzly, which can obtain sizes comparable to those of the coastal bears as described below.<ref name="soviet"/>

Due to the lack of genetic variation within subspecies, the environmental conditions in a given area likely plays the largest part in such weight variations.<ref name= Smith/>

The largest subspecies, the [[Kodiak bear]] (''U. a. middendorffi''), rivals the [[polar bear]] as the largest member of the bear family ([[Ursidae]]).<ref name= Smith>{{cite web|url=http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-439-01-0001.pdf |format=PDF |title=Mammalian Species- Ursus arctos |publisher=American Society of Mammalogists, Smith College |accessdate=14 June 2012}}</ref><ref name="kodiak">{{cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/endangered/esa-library/pdf/polar_bear.pdf |format=PDF |title=Polar bear,(''Ursus maritimus'') |publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |accessdate=22 March 2008 |quote=Appearance.([https://web.archive.org/web/20081216165727/http://ecos.fws.gov/speciesProfile/SpeciesReport.do?spcode=A0IJ Overview page])}}</ref><ref name= FWS>{{cite web|title=Kodiak Brown Bear- Kodiak- U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service |url=http://www.fws.gov/refuge/Kodiak/wildlife_and_habitat/bear.html|publisher=U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref><ref name= FWS>{{cite web|title=Kodiak Brown Bear- Kodiak- U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service |url=http://www.fws.gov/refuge/Kodiak/wildlife_and_habitat/bear.html|publisher=U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service |accessdate=14 June 2012}}</ref><ref>([https://web.archive.org/web/20081216165727/http://ecos.fws.gov/speciesProfile/SpeciesReport.do?spcode=A0IJ Overview page])</ref> The [[Ussuri brown bear]] and also the extinct [[California grizzly]]<ref name="Storer & Tevis 1955">{{cite book|last1=Storer|first1=T.

Size fluctuates depending upon sex, age, individual, geographic location, and season. The normal range of physical dimensions for a brown bear is a head-and-body length of {{convert|1.4|to|2.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a shoulder height of {{convert|70|to|153|cm|in|abbr=on}}. Males within one area are larger than females, typically weighing around 30% more.

The tail is relatively short, ranging from {{convert|6|to|22|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length.<ref>[http://www.zoo.org/animal-facts/brownbear Brown bear]. zoo.org</ref> 
Adult bears generally weigh between {{convert|100|and|635|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.

Generally speaking, brown bears weigh the least when they emerge from hibernation in the spring and then reach peak weights when preparing for hibernation in the fall (when they often gorge on large food stuffs).<ref name= Smith/>

===Ecotype or regional populations===
An adult grizzly living inland in [[Yukon]] may weigh as little as {{convert|80|kg|abbr=on}}, while an adult coastal brown bear in nearby coastal [[Alaska]] living on a steady, nutritious diet of spawning [[salmon]] may weigh as much as {{convert|680|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name= Smith/>

Young of the year typically weigh {{convert|2|-|27|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, while yearlings typically weigh {{convert|9|-|37|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name= Smith/>

The brown bears found in coastal regions of Alaska and far eastern Russia are the largest. The largest subspecies is the [[Kodiak bear]] (''U. a. middendorffi''), followed closely by the [[Kamchatka brown bear]] (''U. a. beringianus''), although bears from other coastal regions of eastern Asia and western North America can be comparably large. In these areas, the female averages from {{convert|181.4|to|318|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and the male averages from {{convert|272|to|635|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name= Smith/><ref name= FWS/> The maximum size of a Kodiak or brown bears in general is not certain. Exceptionally huge male Kodiaks can stand over {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall while on their hind legs and may exceed {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} high at the shoulder.<ref name="factsheet">{{cite web |url=http://www.wildlife.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=bears.trivia |publisher=Alaska Department of Fish and Game, Division of Wildlife Conservation |year=2008 |title=Kodiak Bear Fact Sheet |accessdate=27 October 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100320140013/http://www.wildlife.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=bears.trivia|archivedate=10 March 2010}}</ref> The weight of these enormous bruins is less certain.

===North America===
The brown bear is usually called the grizzly bear in North America. It once ranged throughout much of the entire continent.<ref name="pc.gc.ca">http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/mtn/ours-bears/generaux-basics/grizzli-grizzly.aspx</ref>

====Canada====
As many as 20,000 brown bears range throughout the [[Yukon]], [[Northwest Territories]], and [[British Columbia]], and in the western half of [[Alberta]].<ref name="pc.gc.ca"/>

====United States====
The brown bear has lost 98% of its habitat in the lower 48 states. About 95% of the brown bear population in the United States is in Alaska, though in the lower 48 states, they are repopulating slowly but steadily along the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] and the western [[Great Plains]].

Almost all U.S. bears live in Alaska.

===Asia===
In Asia, brown bears are found primarily throughout [[Russia]], thence more spottily southwest to parts of the [[Middle East]], to as far south as southwestern [[Iran]], and to the southeast in a small area of [[Northeast China]], [[Western China]], and parts of [[North Korea]], [[Pakistan]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[India]].

===Africa===
Many people hold the belief some brown bears may be present in the [[Atlas Mountains]] of [[Morocco]] but there have been none sighted in the last century.

In addition to the native [[Atlas bear]] the Romans apparently imported bears from Spain for spectacles with some escaping and founding a population in Africa.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Europe & Eurasia===
As of 2015 a stable population of around 250 individuals is present in the [[Cantabrian mountains]] of North West [[Spain]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} However, the population of brown bears in the [[Pyrenees]] mountain range between [[France]] and [[Spain]] is extremely low, estimated at 14 to 18, with a shortage of females.<ref name=IUCN/> Their rarity in this area has led biologists to release bears, mostly female, from [[Slovenia]] in spring 2006 to reduce the imbalance and preserve the species' presence in the area. The bears were released despite protests from French farmers. A small population of brown bears (''[[Ursus arctos marsicanus]]'') still lives in central Italy ([[Apennine Mountains]], [[Abruzzo]] and [[Latium]]), with no more than 70 individuals, protected by strong laws, but endangered by the human presence in the area.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In [[Arctic]] areas, the potential habitat of the brown bear is increasing. The [[global warming|warming of that region]] has allowed the species to move farther north into what was once exclusively the domain of the [[polar bear]]. In non-Arctic areas, habitat loss is blamed as the leading cause of endangerment, followed by hunting.

===Iran===
The brown bear occurs in Iran, Iraq and Turkey.<ref name="Boitani et al. 2008.">{{cite journal|last1=Boitani|first1=L.|last2=Cowling|first2=R.M.|last3=Dublin|first3=H.T.|title=Change the IUCN Protected Area Categories to Reflect Biodiversity Outcomes.|journal=PLoS Biology|date=2008|volume=6|issue=3|pages=436–438|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/  journal.pbio.0060066|accessdate=27 April 2015}}</ref> At least 20-30 were present in northern Iran a few years ago.<ref name="Farhadinia & Valizadegan 2015">{{cite journal|last1=Farhadinia|first1=Mohammad Sadegh|last2=Valizadegan|first2=Negin|title=A preliminary baseline status of the Syrian Brown Bear Ursus arctos syriacus (Mammalia: Carnivora: Ursidae) in Golestanak, northern Iran.|journal=Journal of Threatened Taxa|date=2015|volume=7(1)|url=http://www.threatenedtaxa.in/index.php/JoTT/article/view/1787/3104}}</ref>

==Conservation status==
While the brown bear's range has shrunk and it has faced local extinctions, it remains listed as a [[least concern]] species by the [[IUCN]] with a total population of approximately 200,000. As of 2012, this and the [[American black bear]] are the only bear species not classified as threatened by the IUCN. However, the [[California golden bear|Californian]], [[Atlas bear|North African (Atlas bear)]], and [[Mexican grizzly bear|Mexican]] subspecies were hunted to extinction in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and many of the southern Asian subspecies are highly endangered. The [[Syrian brown bear]] (''Ursus arctos syriacus'') is very rare.<ref name="Calvignac et al. 2009">{{cite journal|last1=Calvignac|first1=Sebastien|last2=Hughes|first2=Sandrine|last3=Hanni|first3=Catherine|title=Genetic diversity of endangered brown bear (Ursus arctos) populations at the crossroads of Europe, Asia and Africa|journal=Diversity and Distributions|date=2009|volume=15|pages=742–750|doi=10.1111/j.1472-4642.2009.00586.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2009.00586.x/full|accessdate=18 March 2015}}</ref>  The smallest subspecies, the [[Himalayan brown bear]], is critically endangered, occupying only 2% of its former range and threatened by uncontrolled poaching for its parts.<ref>[http://www.euronews.com/2014/01/06/himalayan-brown-bears-now-critically-endangered/ Himalayan brown bears now critically endangered].

===Regional extinctions===
The brown bear is [[extinct]] in: [[Algeria]], [[Austria]], Belgium, [[Denmark]], Egypt; Germany; Hungary; Ireland, Israel; Jordan, Lebanon; Liechtenstein; Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico; Moldova; Monaco, Morocco; Netherlands, Palestinian Territory; Portugal; San Marino; Switzerland; Syrian Arab Republic, Tunisia, [[United Kingdom]], [[Vatican City|Vatican]].

==Behavior==
Although the brown bear is primarily [[nocturnal]], it is frequently seen in morning and early evening hours.<ref name="Brown / Grizzly Bear Facts">{{cite web|title=Brown / Grizzly Bear Facts|url=http://www.bear.org/website/bear-pages/brown-or-grizzly-bear/68-brown-grizzly-bear-facts.html|publisher=North American Bear Center}}</ref> In summer through autumn, it can double its weight, gaining up to {{Convert|180|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of [[fat]], on which it relies to make it through winter, when it becomes very lethargic. Although they are not full [[hibernation|hibernators]] and can be woken easily, both sexes like to [[maternity den|den]] in a protected spot, such as a [[cave]], crevice, or hollow log, during the winter months. Brown bears are mostly solitary, although they may gather in large numbers at major food sources (e.g., [[moth]] colonies, open garbage dumps or rivers holding spawning [[salmon]]) and form social hierarchies based on age and size.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Egbert | first1 = Allan L. | last2 = Stokes | first2 = Allen W. | year = 1974 | title = The social behaviour of brown bears on an Alaskan salmon stream | url =http://www.bearbiology.com/fileadmin/tpl/Downloads/URSUS/Vol_3/Egbert_Stokes_Egbert_Vol_3.pdf | format=PDF | journal = International Conference Bear Res. and Manage | volume = 3 | pages = 41–56 | jstor=3872753 | last3 = Egbert | first3 = A.

Female bears with cubs rival adult males in aggression, and are more intolerant of other bears than single females. Young adolescent males tend to be least aggressive, and have been observed in nonantagonistic interactions with each other. [[Dominance (ethology)|Dominance]] between bears is asserted by making a frontal orientation, showing off canines, muzzle twisting and neck stretching to which a subordinate will respond with a lateral orientation, by turning away and dropping the head and by sitting or lying down.<ref>Stonorov, Derek and Stokes, Allen W. (1972) [http://www.bearbiology.com/fileadmin/tpl/Downloads/URSUS/Vol_2/Stonorov_Stokes.pdf "Social Behavior of the Alaska Brown Bear"] ''Panel 4: Bear Behaviour''</ref> During combat, bears use their paws to strike their opponents in the chest or shoulders and bite the head or neck. In his ''Great Bear Almanac'', Gary Brown lists 11 different sounds bears produce in 9 different contexts. Sounds expressing anger or aggravation include growls, roars, woofs, champs and smacks, while sounds expressing nervousness or pain include woofs, grunts, and bawls. Sows will bleat or hum when communicating with their cubs.<ref name="brown"/>

==Home ranges==
Brown bears usually occur over vast home ranges, however they are not highly territorial. Several adult bears often roam freely over the same vicinity without issue unless rights to a fertile female or food sources are being contested. Males always cover more area than females each year and will try to mate with as many females as they can (although females are not monogamous either). In areas where food is abundant and concentrated, such as coastal Alaska, home ranges for females are up to {{convert|24|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and for males are up to {{convert|89|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Similarly, in [[British Columbia]], bears of the two sexes travel relatively compact home ranges of {{convert|115|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and {{convert|318|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. In [[Yellowstone National Park]], home ranges for females are up to {{convert|281|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and up to {{convert|874|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} for males. In the central Arctic of Canada, where food sources are quite sparse, home ranges range up to {{convert|2434|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in females and {{convert|8171|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in males.<ref name="Hunter"/>

A study of male-inherited [[Y chromosome]] [[DNA]] sequence found that brown bears, over the past few 10,000 years, have shown strong [[male-biased dispersal]]<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/molbev/msu109| pmid = 24667925| title = Brown and Polar Bear Y Chromosomes Reveal Extensive Male-Biased Gene Flow within Brother Lineages| journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution| volume = 31| issue = 6| pages = 1353–63| year = 2014| last1 = Bidon | first1 = T.| last2 = Janke | first2 = A.| last3 = Fain | first3 = S.

M.| last8 = Lecomte | first8 = N.| last9 = Hailer | first9 = F.}}</ref> That study found surprisingly similar Y chromosomes in brown bear populations as far apart as Norway and coastal Alaska, indicating extensive [[gene flow]] across [[Eurasia]] and [[North America]]. Notably, this contrasts with genetic signals from female-inherited [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA), where brown bears of different geographic regions typically show strong differences in their mtDNA, a result of female [[philopatry]].

==Reproduction==
The [[mating season]] is from mid-May to early July.<ref name="Hunter"/> Being [[serially monogamous]], brown bears remain with the same mate from several days to a couple of weeks.<ref>[http://www.bear-hunting.org/types-of-bears/ Types of Bears] – Information on Specific Bear Species (2009)</ref> Females mature sexually between the age of 4 and 8 years of age, while males first mate about a year later on average, when they are large and strong enough to successfully compete with other males for mating rights.<ref name="Hunter"/>
[[File:Ähtärin karhut 24.jpg|thumb|left|Pair of mating brown bears, at [[Ähtäri Zoo]] in [[Ähtäri|Ähtäri, Finland]]]] Males, however, take no part in raising their cubs – parenting is left entirely to the females.

Through the process of [[delayed implantation]], a female's fertilized egg divides and floats freely in the uterus for six months. During winter dormancy, the fetus attaches to the [[uterus|uterine]] wall. The cubs are born eight weeks later, while the mother sleeps. If the mother does not gain enough weight to survive through the winter, the embryo does not implant and is reabsorbed into the body. The average litter has one to four cubs, usually two. There have been cases of bears with as many as six cubs.<ref name="Hunter"/> There are records of females sometimes adopting stray cubs or even trading cubs when they emerge from hibernation.<ref name="Hunter"/> Older females tend to give birth to larger litters. The size of a litter also depends on factors such as geographic location and food supply. At birth, the cubs are blind, toothless, hairless, and weigh less than {{Convert|450|g|lb|sigfig=1}}. They feed on their mother's milk until spring or even early summer, depending on climate conditions. At this time, the cubs weigh {{Convert|7|to|9|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and have developed enough to follow her and begin to forage for solid food.

Cubs remain with their mother from two to four years (exceptionally to 4 and a half years), during which time they learn survival techniques, such as which foods have the highest nutritional value and where to obtain them; how to hunt, fish, and defend themselves; and where to den. The cubs learn by following and imitating their mother's actions during the period they are with her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shadowofthebear.com/reproduction.html |title=Brown Bear Reproduction |publisher=Shadowofthebear.com |accessdate=10 October 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080501092730/http://www.shadowofthebear.com/reproduction.html |archivedate = 1 May 2008}}</ref> Brown bears practice [[infanticide (zoology)|infanticide]].<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1439-0310.2006.01152.x | title = Mating Strategies in Relation to Sexually Selected Infanticide in a Non-Social Carnivore: The Brown Bear | year = 2006 | last1 = Bellemain | first1 = Eva | last2 = Swenson | first2 = Jon E. | last3 = Taberlet | first3 = Pierre | journal = Ethology | volume = 112 | issue = 3 | pages = 238–246 }}</ref> An adult male bear may kill the cubs of another bear either to make the female sexually receptive or simply for consumption. Cubs flee up a tree when they see a strange male bear, and the mother often successfully defends them, even though the male may be twice as heavy as she.

==Longevity==
The brown bear is naturally a long-living animal. Wild females have been known to be able to reproduce at as old as 28 years of age, the oldest known age for reproduction in the wild of any ursid.<ref name="Hunter"/> Males commonly can live to 25 years, with the oldest female having been 37 years old. The species can live to 48 years of age in captivity. Annual mortality for bears of any age is estimated at around 10% in most protected areas.<ref name="Hunter"/> However, in hunted populations, an estimated average mortality rate of 38% is given.<ref name="Hunter"/> Around 13% to 44% of cubs die within their first year. Beyond predation by other large predators (rarely by [[Gray wolf|wolf packs]] or [[Siberian tiger]]s (''Panthera tigris altaica'')) and brown bears, starvation and accidents claim a few cubs. Even in populations living in protected areas without legal, non-governmental hunting, though, humans are still the leading cause of mortality for brown bears.<ref name="Brown Bear Hunting Alaska">{{cite web|title=Brown/Grizzly Bear Hunting in Alaska|url=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=brownbearhunting.main|publisher=Alaska Department of Fish and Game}}</ref> The largest number of legally hunting on the species occurs in [[Canada]], [[Finland]], [[Russia]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Alaska]].<ref name="Hunter"/>

==Dietary habits==
[[File:Brown Bear Feeding on Salmon.jpg|thumb|upright|Brown bear feeding on [[salmon]]]]
The Brown Bear is one of the most [[omnivorous]] animals in the world and has been recorded as consuming the greatest variety of foods of any bear.<ref name="Hunter"/> Throughout life, this species is regularly curious about the potential of eating virtually any organism or object that they encounter. Food that is both abundant and easily accessed or caught is preferred. Their jaw structure has evolved to fit their dietary habits. Their diet varies enormously throughout their differing areas based on opportunity.

Brown Bears are capable of obtaining practically all forms of the mammals: from the mouse-like rodents to the tiger "myshevidnyh".<ref>{{citation |title = РОЛЬ БУРОГО МЕДВЕДЯ В ЭКОСИСТЕМАХ ДАЛЬНЕГО ВОСТОКА РОССИИ |url=http://www.wcsrussia.org/DesktopModules/Bring2mind/DMX/Download.aspx?EntryId=3343&PortalId=32&DownloadMethod=attachment }}</ref> Despite their reputation, most brown bears are not highly carnivorous, as they derive up to 90% of their dietary [[food energy]] from vegetable matter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dced.state.ak.us/oed/student_info/learn/bearwatching.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415202025/http://www.dced.state.ak.us/oed/student_info/learn/bearwatching.htm |archivedate=15 April 2009 |title=Alaska is bear territory!|work=Alaska Office of Economic Development |publisher=Dced.state.ak.us |accessdate=10 October 2009}}</ref> They often feed on a variety of plant life, including [[Berry|berries]], [[grass]]es, [[flower]]s, [[acorn]]s (''Quercus'' ssp.) and [[pine cone]]s as well as [[Fungus|fungi]] such as [[mushroom]]s.<ref name= Smith/> Among all bears, brown bears are uniquely equipped to dig for tough foods such as [[root]]s and [[shoot]]s. They use their long, strong claws to dig out earth to reach the roots and their powerful jaws to bite through them.<ref name= Smith/> In spring, winter-provided carrion, grasses, shoots, sedges and forbs are the dietary mainstays for brown bears internationally.<ref name="Hunter"/> Fruits, including berries, become increasingly important during summer and early autumn. Roots and bulbs become critical in autumn for some inland bear populations if fruit crops are poor.<ref name="Hunter"/> They will also commonly consume animal matter, which in summer and autumn may regularly be in the form of [[insect]]s, [[larvae]] and [[Larva|grubs]], including [[beehive]]s. Bears in Yellowstone eat an enormous number of [[moth]]s during the summer, sometimes as many as 40,000 [[Army cutworm|army cutworm moths]] (''Euxoa auxiliaris'') in a single day, and may derive up to half of their annual food energy from these insects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yellowstonepark.com/MoreToKnow/ShowNewsDetails.aspx?newsid=163 |title=Yellowstone Grizzly Bears Eat 40,000 Moths a Day In August |publisher=Yellowstonepark.com |date=21 June 2011}}</ref> Brown bears living near coastal regions will regularly eat [[crab]]s and [[clam]]s.

In the Kamchatka peninsula and several parts of coastal Alaska, brown bears feed mostly on spawning [[salmon]], whose nutrition and abundance explain the enormous size of the bears in these areas. The fishing techniques of bears are well-documented. They often congregate around falls when the salmon are forced to breach the water, at which point the bears will try to catch the fish in mid-air (often with their mouths). They will also wade into shallow waters, hoping to pin a slippery salmon with their claws. While they may eat almost all the parts of the fish, bears at the peak of spawning, when there is usually a glut of fish to feed on, may eat only the most nutrious parts of the salmon (including the eggs and head) and then indifferently leave the rest of the carcass to scavengers, which can include [[red fox]]es, [[bald eagle]]s, [[common raven]]s and [[gull]]s. Despite their normally solitary habits, Brown bears will gather rather closely in numbers at good spawning sites. The largest and most powerful males claim the most fruitful fishing spots and bears (especially males) will sometimes fight over the rights to a prime fishing spot.<ref name="brown"/>

Beyond the regular predation of salmon, most brown bears are not particularly active predators.<ref name="brown"/> While perhaps a majority of bears of the species will charge at large prey at one point in their lives and most eat carrion, many predation attempts start with the bear clumsily and half-heartedly pursuing the prey and end with the prey escaping alive.<ref name="brown"/> On the other hand, some brown bears are quite self-assured predators who habitually pursue and catch large prey items. Such bears are usually taught how to hunt by their mothers from an early age.<ref name="brown"/> Large mammals preyed on can include various [[deer]] species such as [[elk]] (''Cervus canadensis''), [[red deer]] (''Cervus elaphus''), [[axis deer]] (''Axis axis''), [[roe deer|European roe deer]] (''Capreolus capreolus''), [[Siberian roe deer]] (''Capreolus pygargus''), [[fallow deer]] (''Dama dama''), [[mule deer]] (''Odocoileus hemionus''), [[white tailed deer]] (''Odocoileus virginianus''), [[moose]] (''Alces alces'') and [[Caribou (North America)|caribou]] (''Rangifer tarandus''). [[Bovid]]s are also regular prey including various [[ovis|sheep]], [[capra (genus)|goat]]s, [[antelope]], [[bison]] (''Bison'' ssp.) and [[muskoxen]] (''Ovibos moschatus''), as are [[wild boar]]s (''Sus scrofa'').<ref name= Smith/> When brown bears attack these large animals, they usually target young or infirm ones, as they are easier to catch. Typically when hunting (especially with young prey), the bear pins its prey to the ground and then immediately tears and eats it alive.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=French |first1= S.

Carrion is especially important in the early spring (when the bears are emerging from hibernation), much of it comprised by winter-killed big game.<ref name= Smith/> Cannibalism is not unheard of, though predation is not normally believed to be the primary motivation when brown bears attack each other.<ref name="brown"/>

When forced to live in close proximity with humans and their domesticated animals, bears may potentially predate any type of domestic animal. Among these, domestic [[cattle]] (''Bos primigenius taurus'') are sometimes exploited as prey. Cattle are bitten on the neck, back or head and then the abdominal cavity is opened for eating.<ref name= Smith/> In [[Norway]], free-ranging [[domestic sheep]] (''Ovis aries'') are numerous and the local brown bears derive 65-87% of their dietary energy in late summer from sheep. Due to the vulnerability of this prey, examination of sheep remains suggest many of the sheep consumed there are adults that were killed by the bears rather than merely scavenged, and thus some local farmers received partial compensation for their stock losses. In nearby northern Sweden, free-ranging sheep are not present and the bear derive their food predominantly from natural sources.<ref>Dahle, B., Sørensen, O. J., Wedul, E. H., Swenson, J. E., & Sandegren, F. (1998). ''The diet of brown bears Ursus arctos in central Scandinavia: effect of access to free-ranging domestic sheep Ovis aries''. Wildlife biology, 4(3), 147-158.</ref> Plants and fruit farmed by humans are readily consumed as well, including [[Maize|corn]] (''Zea mays ''), [[wheat]] (''Triticum'' spp.), [[sorghum]] (''Sorghum'' ssp.), [[melon]]s and any form of [[Berry|berries]].<ref name="brown"/> They will also feed at domestic [[Beekeeping|bee farms]], readily consuming both honey and the contents of the [[honey bee]] (''Apis mellifera'') colony.<ref name="brown"/> Human foods and trash or refuse is eaten when possible. When an open garbage dump was kept in Yellowstone, brown bears were one of the most voracious and regular scavengers. The dump was closed after both brown and American black bears came to associate humans with food and lost their natural fear of them.<ref name="brown"/>

Brown bears regularly intimidate [[Gray wolf|gray wolves]] (''Canis lupus'') away from their kills. In [[Yellowstone National Park]], brown bears pirate wolf kills so often, Yellowstone's Wolf Project director Doug Smith wrote, "It's not a matter of if the bears will come calling after a kill, but when." Despite the high animosity between the two species, most confrontations at kill sites or large carcasses end without bloodshed on either side. Though conflict over carcasses is common, on rare occasions the two predators tolerate each other on the same kill. To date, there is a single case of fully-grown wolves being killed by a grizzly bear.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.canadianfieldnaturalist.ca/index.php/cfn/article/view/550 |volume=122 |issue=1 |year=2008 |title= Gray Wolves, ''Canis lupus'', Killed by Cougars, ''Puma concolor'', and a Grizzly Bear, ''Ursus arctos'', in Montana, Alberta, and Wyoming |author= Jimenez, Michael D.; Asher, Valpa J.; Bergman, Carita; Bangs, Edward E. and Woodruff, Susannah P. |journal=The Canadian Field-Naturalist |page=76}} [http://mountainlion.org/US/WY/WY%20R%20Jimenez%20et%20al%202008%20Gray%20Wolves%20Killed%20by%20Cougars%20and%20Grizzly%20Bears%20in%20Montana,%20Alberta,%20and%20Wyoming%20-%20Canadian%20Field%20Naturalist.pdf PDF].</ref> Given the opportunity, however, both species will prey on the other's cubs.<ref>{{cite web |author=Downey, Betsy |title=Personal Encounter.

Brown bears usually dominate other bear species in areas where they coexist. Due to their smaller size, [[American black bear]]s are at a competitive disadvantage to brown bears in open, unforested areas. Although displacement of black bears by brown bears has been documented, actual interspecific killing of black bears by brown bears has only occasionally been reported.

==Relationship with humans==

===Conflicts between bears and humans===
Bears become attracted to human-created food sources, such as garbage dumps, litter bins, and dumpsters; they venture into human dwellings or [[barn]]s in search of food as humans encroach into bear habitats. In the U.S., bears sometimes kill and eat farm animals. When bears come to associate human activity with a "food reward", they are likely to continue to become emboldened; the likelihood of human-bear encounters increases, as they may return to the same location despite relocation. The saying "a fed bear is a dead bear" has come into use to popularize the idea that allowing bears to scavenge human garbage, such as trash cans and campers' backpacks, [[pet food]], or other food sources that draw the bear into contact with humans, can result in a bear's death.

Relocation of the bear has been used to separate the bear from the human environment, but it does not address the problem of the bear's newly learned association of humans with food or the environmental situations which created the human-habituated bear. "Placing a bear in habitat used by other bears may lead to competition and social conflict, and result in the injury or death of the less dominant bear."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bearsmart.com/managingBears/Relocation.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060513075036/http://www.bearsmart.com/managingBears/Relocation.html|archivedate=13 May 2006|title=Relocation|work=Get Bear Smart Society }}</ref>

[[Yellowstone National Park]], a reserve located in the western United States, contains prime habitat for the grizzly bear (''Ursus arctos horribilis''), and due to the enormous number of visitors, human-bear encounters are common. The scenic beauty of the area has led to an influx of people moving into the area. In addition, because there are so many bear relocations to the same remote areas of Yellowstone, and because male bears tend to dominate the center of the relocation zone, female bears tend to be pushed to the boundaries of the region and beyond. As a result, a large proportion of repeat offenders, bears that are killed for public safety, are females. This creates a further depressive effect on an already endangered species. The grizzly bear is officially described as "threatened" in the U.S. Though the problem is most significant with regard to grizzlies, these issues affect the other types of brown bears as well.

In Europe, part of the problem lies with [[shepherd]]s; over the past two centuries, many sheep and goat herders have gradually abandoned the more traditional practice of using [[dog]]s to guard flocks, which have concurrently grown larger. Typically, they allow the herds to graze freely over sizeable tracts of land. As bears reclaim parts of their range, they may eat livestock. In some cases, the shepherds shoot the bear, thinking their livelihood is under threat. Many are now better informed about the ample compensation available, and will make a claim when they lose livestock to a bear.

It is likely that humans caused extinction of bear populations and fragmentation of their habitats since prehistorical time. It is, for instance, shown that bear populations from the [[Greater Caucasus]] and the [[Lesser Caucasus]] Mountains, separated by the densely populated Transcaucasian Depression, have been matrilineally isolated since the early Holocene era, i.e., after permanent human settlements appeared throughout the area<ref name="mari" />

===Relationship with Native Americans===
[[File:Gorgonia, Mescalero medicine man.jpg|upright|thumb|Gorgonia, a Native American (Mescalero Apache) man. He holds a bear pelt and wears moccasin boots, a breechcloth, kilt, and vest.]]
[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes sympatric with brown bears often view them with a mixture of awe and fear. North American brown bears have at times been so feared by the natives, that they were rarely hunted, especially alone. At traditional grizzly hunts, the expedition was conducted with the same preparation and ceremoniality as intertribal warfare, and was never done except with a company of 4–10 warriors.{{clarify|reason=What nations? Which historical period? According to whom?|date=May 2015}} The tribe members who dealt the killing blow were highly esteemed among their compatriots. Californian natives actively avoided prime bear habitat, and would not allow their young men to hunt alone, for fear of bear attacks. During the Spanish colonial period, some tribes, instead of hunting grizzlies themselves, would seek aid from European colonists to deal with problem bears. Many authors in the American west wrote of natives or [[voyageurs]] with lacerated faces and missing noses or eyes due to attacks from grizzlies.<ref name="geist">Geist, Valerius (1989) [https://web.archive.org/web/20081216192502/http://www.cnr.uidaho.edu/wlf520/pdf/geist.pdf "Did Large Predators keep Humans out of North America?"], pp. 282–294 in Juliet Clutton-Brock (ed.)

[[Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore|Sleeping Bear Dunes]] is named after a Native American legend, where a female bear and her cub swam across Lake Michigan.  Exhausted from their journey, the bears rested on the shoreline and fell sound asleep.  Over the years, the sand covered them up, creating a huge sand dune.

Many Native American tribes both respect and fear the brown bear, even thinking of it as a god.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} One tale tells of how the black bear was a creation of the [[Great Spirit]], while the grizzly was created by the Evil Spirit.{{clarify|reason=Which nation?|date=May 2015}}<ref>''Folklore and Legends of the North American Indian'' compiled by Joshua B Lippincott, published by Abela Publishing Ltd, 2009, ISBN 0-9560584-6-9</ref> In [[Kwakiutl]] mythology, black and brown bears became enemies when Grizzly Bear Woman killed Black Bear Woman for being lazy.

Aggressive behavior in brown bears is favored by numerous selection variables. Unlike the smaller black bears, adult brown bears are too large and have improperly shaped claws to escape danger by climbing trees, so they respond to danger by standing their ground and warding off their attackers. Increased aggressiveness also assists female brown bears in better ensuring the survival of their young to reproductive age.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050309215404/http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2004/04/04-27-04tdc/04-27-04dscihealth-column-01.asp Why are grizzly bears more aggressive than our black bears?].

===Attacks on humans===
[[File:Bear trap GTNP1.jpg|thumb|right|Drum or barrel trap used to safely relocate bears; currently parked adjacent to a building in [[Grand Teton National Park]] in [[Wyoming]], [[United States]]]]
Brown bears seldom attack humans on sight, and usually avoid people. They are, however, unpredictable in temperament, and may attack if they are surprised or feel threatened.<ref name="attack">Herrero, Stepehen (1985) ''Bear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance'', Hurtig Publishers Ltd./ Edmonton</ref> Sows with cubs account for the majority of injuries and fatalities in North America. [[Habituation|Habituated]] or food-conditioned bears can also be dangerous, as their long-term exposure to humans causes them to lose their natural shyness, and, in some cases, to associate humans with food. Small parties of one or two people are more often attacked than large groups, with only one known case of an attack on a group of six or more. In that instance, it is thought that due to surprise, the bear may not have recognized the size of the group.<ref name="NOLS 2011 bear attack">Medred, Craig (26 July 2011) [http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/alaska-bear-attack-nols-kids-did-phenomenal-job Alaska bear attack: NOLS kids did a 'phenomenal job'], ''[[Alaska Dispatch]]''</ref>  In the majority of attacks resulting in injury, brown bears precede the attack with a growl or huffing sound,<ref name="attack"/> In contrast to injuries caused by American black bears, which are usually minor, brown bear attacks tend to result in serious injury and, in some cases, death.<ref name="attack"/> Brown bears seem to confront humans as they would when fighting other bears: they rise up on their hind legs, and attempt to "disarm" their victims by biting and holding on to the lower jaw to avoid being bitten in turn.<ref name="geist"/> Due to the bears' enormous physical strength, even a single bite or swipe can be deadly, as in tigers, with some human victims having had their heads completely crushed by a bear bite.<ref name="living">[https://archive.org/stream/livinganimalsofw01cornrich#page/n7/mode/2up '&#39;The living animals of the world; a popular natural history with one thousand illustrations'&#39; Volume 1: Mammals], by [[Charles John Cornish|Cornish, C.

In Japan, a large brown bear nicknamed "''Kesagake''" (袈裟懸け, "[[Kesa (clothing)|kesa]]-style slasher") made history for causing the [[Sankebetsu brown bear incident|worst bear attack in Japanese history]] at [[Tomamae, Hokkaidō]] during numerous encounters during December 1915. It killed seven people and wounded three others (with possibly another three previous fatalities to its credit) before being gunned down after a large-scale beast-hunt. Today, there is still a shrine at Rokusensawa (六線沢), where the event took place, in memory of the victims of the incident.

Within Yellowstone National Park, injuries caused by grizzly attacks in developed areas averaged approximately one per year during the 1930s through to the 1950s, though it increased to four per year during the 1960s. They then decreased to one injury every two years during the 1970s. Between 1980 and 2002, there have been only two human injuries caused by grizzly bears in a developed area. Though grizzly attacks were rare in the backcountry before 1970, the number of attacks increased to an average of approximately one per year during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.<ref>[http://www.yellowstone-bearman.com/yell_bear_maul_info.html Bear Caused Human Injuries and Deaths In Yellowstone National Park].

===History of defense from bears===
A study by US and Canadian researchers has found [[pepper spray]] to be more effective at stopping aggressive bear behavior than guns, working in 92% of studied incidents versus 67% for guns.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> Carrying pepper spray is highly recommended by many authorities when traveling in bear country; however, carrying two means of deterrent, one of which is a large caliber gun, is also advised. Solid shotgun slugs, or three buckshot rounds, or a pistol of .44 caliber or more is suggested if a heavy hunting rifle is not available. Guns remain a viable, last resort option to be used in defense of life from aggressive bears.<ref name="smith_brown_bear_projects">{{cite web

}}</ref> Too often, people do not carry a proper caliber weapon to neutralize the bear. According to the Alaska Science Center, a [[gauge (bore diameter)|12 gauge]] [[shotgun]] with [[slug (projectile)|slugs]] has been the most effective weapon. There have been fewer injuries as a result of only carrying lethal loads in the shotgun, as opposed to deterrent rounds. State of Alaska Defense of Life or Property (DLP) laws require one to report the kill to authorities, and salvage the hide, skull, and claws.<ref name="casenumber_07-96958">{{cite web

Campers are often told to wear bright colored red ribbons and bells, and carry whistles to ward off bears. They are told to look for grizzly scat in camping areas, and be careful to carry the bells and whistles in those areas. Grizzly scat is difficult to differentiate from black bear scat, as diet is in a constant state of flux depending on the availability of seasonal food items. If a bear is killed near camp, the bear's carcass must be adequately disposed of, including entrails and blood, if possible. Failure to move the carcass has often resulted in it attracting other bears and further exacerbating a bad situation. Moving camps immediately is another recommended method.

A page at the State of Alaska Department of Natural Resources website offers information about how to "[http://dnr.alaska.gov/parks/safety/bears.htm select a gun that will stop a bear (12-gauge shotgun or .300 mag rifle)]." This information is helpful for people venturing into "bear country", regardless of state or country,

===Culture===
[[File:The Three Bears - Project Gutenberg etext 19993.jpg|thumb|upright|"[[The Story of the Three Bears]]", illustration from ''Childhood's Favorites and Fairy Stories'']]
Brown bears often figure into the literature of Europe and North America, in particular that which is written for children. "[[The Brown Bear of Norway]]" is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[fairy tale]] telling the adventures of a girl who married a prince magically turned into a bear, and who managed to get him back into a human form by the force of her love and after many trials and difficulties. With "[[Goldilocks and the Three Bears]]", a story from England, the three bears are usually depicted as brown bears. In German speaking countries, children are often told the fairytale of [[Snow White and Rose Red]]; the handsome prince in this tale has been transfigured into a brown bear. In the United States, parents often read their preschool age children the book [[Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?]] to teach them their colors and how they are associated with different animals.

The [[Russian bear]] is a common [[national personification]] for [[Russia]] (as well as the former [[Soviet Union]]). The brown bear is also [[Finland]]'s national animal.

[[File:Berni Bayern.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Berni is a brown bear mascot of German football club [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]]]
The [[Bundesliga]] club [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] has a brown bear mascot named Berni.

The [[National Football League]] (NFL) franchise in Chicago, Illinois, is named the [[Chicago Bears|Bears]].  In this context, no differentiation between black and brown bears is needed.

The school mascot for [[George Fox University]], [[Brown University]], the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the [[University of California, Riverside]], and the [[University of Alberta]] is the brown bear.

The coat of arms of [[Madrid]] depicts a bear reaching up into a ''madroño'' or [[Arbutus unedo|strawberry tree]] (''Arbutus unedo'') to eat some of its fruit, whereas the Swiss city of [[Bern]]'s coat of arms also depicts a bear and the city's name is popularly thought to derive from the German word for bear.

In the town of [[Prats de Molló]], in [[Vallespir]], southern France, a "bear festival" (''festa de l'ós'') is celebrated annually at the beginning of spring, in which the locals dress up as bears, cover themselves with soot or coal and oil, and "attack" the onlookers, attempting to get everyone dirty. The festival ends with the ''ball de l'os'' (bear dance).

The [[grizzly bear]] is the state animal of [[Montana]].  The California golden bear is the state animal of [[California]]. Both animals are sub-species of the brown bear.
