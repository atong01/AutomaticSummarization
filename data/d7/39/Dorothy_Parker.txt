'''Dorothy Parker''' (August 22, 1893 – June 7, 1967) was an American poet, short story writer, critic and [[satire|satirist]], best known for her [[wit]], wisecracks, and eye for 20th-century urban foibles.

From a conflicted and unhappy childhood, Parker rose to acclaim, both for her literary output in publications such as ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and as a founding member of the [[Algonquin Round Table]]. Following the breakup of the circle, Parker traveled to Hollywood to pursue [[screenwriting]]. Her successes there, including two [[Academy Award]] nominations, were curtailed when her involvement in [[left-wing politics]] led to a place on the [[Hollywood blacklist]].

Dismissive of her own talents, she deplored her reputation as a "wisecracker". Nevertheless, her literary output and reputation for her sharp wit have endured.

==Early life and education==
Also known as Dot or Dottie, Parker was born Dorothy Rothschild to Jacob Henry<ref>{{cite book | last =Meade | first =Marion | title =Dorothy Parker: What Fresh Hell Is This? | publisher =Penguin Books | year =1987 | location =New York | page =5 | isbn =0-14-011616-8}}</ref> and Eliza Annie Rothschild (née Marston)<ref>Meade 6</ref> at 732 Ocean Avenue in the West End village of [[Long Branch, New Jersey]],<ref name="NYT obit">{{cite news |url=http://dorothyparker.com/nytobit.html |title=Dorothy Parker, 73, Literary Wit, Dies |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 8, 1967|first=Alden |last=Whitman }}</ref> where her parents had a summer beach cottage. Dorothy's mother was of Scottish descent, and her father was of German Jewish descent. Parker wrote in her essay "My Hometown" that her parents got her back to their [[Manhattan]] apartment shortly after Labor Day so she could be called a true New Yorker. Her mother died in West End in July 1898, when Parker was a month shy of turning five.<ref>Meade 12</ref> Her father remarried in 1900 to a woman named Eleanor Francis Lewis.<ref>Meade 13</ref> Parker hated her father and stepmother, accusing her father of being physically abusive and refusing to call Eleanor either "mother" or "stepmother", instead referring to her as "the housekeeper".<ref>{{cite book| last =Herrmann| first =Dorothy| title =With Malice Toward All: The Quips, Lives and Loves of Some Celebrated 20th-Century American Wits | publisher =G.

She sold her first poem to ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine in 1914 and some months later was hired as an editorial assistant for another [[Condé Nast Publications|Condé Nast]] magazine, ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''. She moved to ''Vanity Fair'' as a staff writer after two years at ''Vogue''.<ref>Silverstein 13</ref>

In 1917, she met and married a [[Wall Street]] [[stockbroker]], Edwin Pond Parker II<ref>Herrmann 78</ref>
(1893–1933<ref>{{cite news |title=Edwin P. Parker 2d |newspaper=The New York Times |agency=Associated Press |date=January 8, 1933 |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10E10FF3F58117B8EDDA10894D9405B838FF1D3 |accessdate=2013-02-28}}</ref>), but they were separated by his army service in [[World War I]]. She had ambivalent feelings about her Jewish heritage given the strong [[antisemitism]] of that era and joked that she married to escape her name.<ref>{{cite book| last =Penzer| first =Otto| title =The Vicious Circle: Mystery and Crime Stories by Members of the Algonquin Round Table| publisher =Pegasus Books| year =2007| location =New York| page = 99| isbn = 978-1933648675}}</ref>

==Algonquin Round Table years==
[[File:Algonquin Round Table.gif|thumb|250px|Parker, with Algonquin Round Table members and guests (l–r) Art Samuels (editor of ''Harper's'' and, briefly, ''The New Yorker''), Charles MacArthur, Harpo Marx, and Alexander Woollcott]]

Her career took off while she was writing theatre criticism for ''Vanity Fair'', which she began to do in 1918 as a stand-in for the vacationing [[P. G. Wodehouse]].<ref>Silverstein 18</ref> At the magazine, she met [[Robert Benchley]], who became a close friend, and [[Robert E. Sherwood]].<ref>{{cite book| last =Altman| first =Billy| title =Laughter's Gentle Soul: The Life of Robert Benchley| publisher =W. W. Norton & Company | year =1997| location = New York| page =146| isbn = 0-393-03833-5}}</ref> The trio began lunching at the [[Algonquin Hotel]] on a near-daily basis and became founding members of the [[Algonquin Round Table]]. The Round Table numbered among its members the newspaper columnists [[Franklin Pierce Adams]] and [[Alexander Woollcott]]. Through their re-printing of her lunchtime remarks and short verses, particularly in Adams' column "The Conning Tower", Dorothy began developing a national reputation as a wit. One of her most famous comments was made when the group was informed that famously taciturn former president [[Calvin Coolidge]] had died; Parker remarked, "How could they tell?"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Calvin Coolidge|date=2006|first=David|last=Greenberg|series=The American Presidents Series|publisher=Times Books|isbn=978-0-8050-6957-0|page=9|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAparker.htm}}</ref>

Parker's caustic wit as a critic initially proved popular, but she was eventually terminated by ''Vanity Fair'' in 1920 after her criticisms began to offend powerful producers too often. In solidarity, both Benchley and Sherwood resigned in protest.<ref>Altman 156–8</ref>

When [[Harold Ross]] founded ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in 1925, Parker and Benchley were part of a "board of editors" established by Ross to allay concerns of his investors. Parker's first piece for the magazine appeared in its second issue.<ref>Silverstein 32</ref> Parker became famous for her short, viciously humorous poems, many about the perceived ludicrousness of her many (largely unsuccessful) romantic affairs and others wistfully considering the appeal of suicide.

The next 15 years were Parker's greatest period of productivity and success. In the 1920s alone she published some 300 poems and free verses in ''Vanity Fair'', ''Vogue'', "The Conning Tower" and ''The New Yorker'' as well as ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', ''[[McCall's]]'' and ''[[The New Republic]]''.<ref>Silverstein 62–3</ref>
[[File:dotrope.jpg|thumb|left|Cover of the first edition of ''Enough Rope'']]
Parker published her first volume of poetry, ''Enough Rope'', in 1926. The collection sold 47,000 copies<ref name = "canlqr">Silverstein 35</ref> and garnered impressive reviews. ''[[The Nation]]'' described her verse as "caked with a salty humor, rough with splinters of disillusion, and tarred with a bright black authenticity".<ref>Meade 177</ref> Although some critics, notably the ''[[New York Times]]'' reviewer, dismissed her work as "[[flapper]] verse",<ref>Meade 178</ref> the volume helped cement Parker's reputation for sparkling wit.<ref name = "canlqr"/> Parker released two more volumes of verse, ''Sunset Gun'' (1928) and ''Death and Taxes'' (1931), along with the short story collections ''Laments for the Living'' (1930) and ''After Such Pleasures'' (1933). ''Not So Deep as a Well'' (1936) collected much of the material previously published in ''Rope'', ''Gun'' and ''Death'' and she re-released her fiction with a few new pieces in 1939 under the title ''Here Lies''.

She collaborated with playwright [[Elmer Rice]] to create ''Close Harmony'', which ran on Broadway in December 1924. The play was well received in out-of-town previews and was favorably reviewed in New York but closed after a run of just 24 performances. It did, however, become a successful touring production under the title ''The Lady Next Door''.<ref>Meade 138</ref>

Some of Parker's most popular work was published in ''The New Yorker'' in the form of acerbic book reviews under the byline "Constant Reader" (her response to the whimsy of [[A. A. Milne]]'s ''[[The House at Pooh Corner]]'': "Tonstant Weader fwowed up."<ref>{{cite book| last =Parker | first =Dorothy| title =Far From Well, collected in The Portable Dorothy Parker Revised and Enlarged Edition| publisher =Penguin Books| year =1976| location = New York| page =518| isbn = 0-14-015074-9}}</ref>). Her reviews appeared semi-regularly from 1927 to 1933,<ref>Silverstein 38</ref> were widely read, and were later published in a collection under the name ''Constant Reader'' in 1970.

Her best-known short story, "Big Blonde", published in ''[[The Bookman (New York)|The Bookman]]'' magazine, was awarded the [[O. Henry Award]] as the best short story of 1929.<ref>Herrmann 74</ref> Her short stories, though often witty, were also spare and incisive, and more bittersweet than comic.{{Citation needed|reason=Says who?|date=November 2012}}

She eventually separated from her husband, divorcing in 1928, and had a number of affairs. Her lovers included reporter-turned-playwright [[Charles MacArthur]] and the publisher [[Seward Collins]]. Her relationship with MacArthur resulted in a pregnancy, about which Parker is alleged to have remarked, "how like me, to put all my eggs into one bastard."<ref>Meade 105</ref> She had an abortion, and fell into a depression that culminated in her first attempt at suicide.<ref>Silverstein 29</ref>

It was toward the end of this period that Parker began to become politically aware and active. What would become a lifelong commitment to activism began in 1927 with the pending executions of [[Sacco and Vanzetti]]. Parker travelled to [[Boston]] to protest the proceedings. She and fellow Round Tabler [[Ruth Hale (feminist)|Ruth Hale]] were arrested, and Parker eventually pleaded guilty to a charge of "loitering and sauntering", paying a $5 fine.<ref>Silverstein 44</ref>

==Hollywood==
In 1934, she married [[Alan Campbell (screenwriter)|Alan Campbell]],<ref>Meade 238</ref> an actor with aspirations to become a screenwriter. Like Parker, he was half-Jewish and half-Scottish. He was reputed to be [[bisexual]]—indeed, Parker claimed in public that he was "[[queer]] as a billy goat".{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} The pair moved to Hollywood and signed ten-week contracts with [[Paramount Pictures]], with Campbell (who was also expected to act) earning $250 per week and Parker earning $1,000 per week. They would eventually earn $2,000 and in some instances upwards of $5,000 per week as freelancers for various studios.<ref>Silverstein 40</ref> She and Campbell worked on more than 15 films.<ref>{{IMDb name|0662213|Dorothy Parker}}</ref>

In 1936, she contributed lyrics for the song "[[I Wished on the Moon]]", with music by [[Ralph Rainger]]. The song was introduced in ''[[The Big Broadcast of 1936]]'' by [[Bing Crosby]].

With [[Robert Carson (writer)|Robert Carson]] and Campbell, she wrote the script for the 1937 film ''[[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|A Star is Born]]'', for which they were nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for Best Writing—Screenplay.<ref>{{cite web | title =A Star is Born (1937)—Awards| publisher =Internet Movie Database| url =http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029606/awards| accessdate = 2007-09-24 }}</ref> She wrote additional dialogue for ''[[The Little Foxes (film)|The Little Foxes]]'' in 1941 and received another Oscar nomination, with Frank Cavett, for 1947's ''[[Smash-Up, the Story of a Woman]]'', starring [[Susan Hayward]].<ref>{{cite web| title =Smash-Up: The Story of a Woman—Awards| publisher =Internet Movie Database| url =http://imdb.com/title/tt0039840/awards| accessdate = 2007-09-24 }}</ref>

After the United States entered the Second World War, Parker and [[Alexander Woollcott]] collaborated to produce an anthology of her work as part of a series published by [[Viking Press]] for servicemen stationed overseas. With an introduction by [[Somerset Maugham]]<ref>Meade 318</ref> the volume compiled over two dozen of Parker's short stories along with selected poems from ''Enough Rope'', ''Sunset Gun'', and ''Death and Taxes''. It was released in the United States in 1944 under the title ''The Portable Dorothy Parker''. Parker's is one of only three of the ''Portable'' series (the other two being [[William Shakespeare]] and The Bible) to remain continuously in print.<ref>{{cite book | last =Publisher's Note | title =The Portable Dorothy Parker Revised and Enlarged Edition | publisher =Penguin | year =1976 | location =New York| isbn =0-14-015074-9 }}</ref>

During the 1930s and 1940s, Parker became an increasingly vocal advocate of causes like civil liberties and civil rights, and a frequent critic of those in authority. She reported on the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Loyalist cause in Spain]] for the Communist magazine ''[[The New Masses]]'' in 1937.<ref>Meade 285</ref> At the behest of [[Otto Katz]], a covert Soviet Comintern agent and operative of German Communist Party agent [[Willi Muenzenberg]], Parker helped to found the [[Hollywood Anti-Nazi League]] in 1936 (which was suspected by the FBI of being a Communist Party front).<ref>Koch, Stephen, ''Double Lives: Stalin, Willi Munzenberg and the Seduction of the Intellectuals'', New York: Enigma Books (2004), Revised Edition, ISBN 1-929631-20-0</ref> The Hollywood Anti-Nazi League's membership eventually grew to some 4,000 strong. Its often wealthy members' contributions (probably not intended to support Communism) were, in the words of [[David Caute]],<ref name="autogenerated1">Caute, David, ''The Fellow Travellers: Intellectual Friends of Communism'', New Haven: Yale University Press (1988), ISBN 0-300-04195-0</ref> "able to contribute as much to [Communist] Party funds as the whole American working class".<ref name="autogenerated1" /><ref>[http://www.heretical.com/miscella/munzen.html Willi Münzenberg's 'Innocents' Clubs'<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Parker also served as chair of the Joint Anti-Fascist Rescue Committee. She organized Project Rescue Ship to transport Loyalist veterans to Mexico, headed Spanish Children's Relief and lent her name to many other left-wing causes and organizations.<ref>{{cite book | last =Buhle | first =Paul|author2=Dave Wagner | title =Radical Hollywood: The Untold Story Behind America's Favorite Movies | publisher =The New Press | year =2002 | location =New York | page =89| isbn =1-56584-718-0 }}</ref> Her former Round Table friends saw less and less of her, with her relationship with Robert Benchley being particularly strained (although they would reconcile).<ref>Altman 314</ref> Parker met [[S. J. Perelman]] at a party in 1932, and despite a rocky start (Perelman called it "a scarifying ordeal")<ref>Perelman 171</ref>—they remained friends for the next 35 years, even becoming neighbors when the Perelmans helped Parker and Campbell buy a run-down farm in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.

Parker was listed as a [[Communist]] by the publication ''[[Red Channels]]'' in 1950.<ref>{{cite web| title =Dorothy ParkerR Writer, Versifier | work =Red Channels: The Report of Communist Influence in Radio and Television | publisher =Counterattack| url =http://www.authentichistory.com/1950s/redchannels/redch115.html| accessdate = 2007-09-24 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070807192003/http://www.authentichistory.com/1950s/redchannels/redch115.html |archivedate = 2007-08-07}}</ref> The [[FBI]] compiled a 1,000-page dossier on her because of her suspected involvement in Communism during the [[Joseph McCarthy|McCarthy]] era.<ref>{{cite book| last =Kunkel| first =Thomas| title =Genius in Disguise: Harold Ross of The New Yorker| publisher =Carrol & Graf| year =1996| page = 405| isbn = 0-7867-0323-7}}</ref> As a result, she was placed on the [[Hollywood blacklist]] by the movie studio bosses. Her final screenplay was ''[[The Fan (1949 film)|The Fan]]'', a 1949 adaptation of [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[Lady Windermere's Fan]]'', directed by [[Otto Preminger]]. Her marriage to Campbell was tempestuous, with tensions exacerbated by Parker's increasing alcohol consumption and Campbell's long-term affair with a married woman while he was in Europe during [[World War II]].<ref>Meade 327</ref> They divorced in 1947,<ref>Meade 329</ref> then remarried in 1950.<ref>Meade 339</ref> Parker moved back to New York in 1952, living at the Volney residential hotel at 23 [[East 74th Street]] on the Upper East Side.<ref name="google2">{{cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Mqz2cxXtwEQC&pg=PA41&dq=%22East+74th%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YJRkUfajIPLe4AP6oICgBA&ved=0CFkQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=%22East%2074th%22&f=false |author= James Malanowski|title= Dead & Famous; Where the Grim Reaper has Walked in New York |publisher=Spy  |date=July 17, 1959 |accessdate=2013-04-10}}</ref> From 1957 to 1962, she wrote book reviews for ''[[Esquire magazine|Esquire]]'',<ref>{{cite web | last =Itzkovitz | first =Daniel | title =Dorothy Rothschild Parker (1893–1967) | publisher =Jewish Virtual Library | date =May 28, 1998 | url =http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/parker.html | accessdate = 2005-09-25 }}</ref> though these pieces were increasingly erratic owing to her continued abuse of alcohol. She returned to Hollywood in 1961 and reconciled with Campbell. In the next two years, they worked together on a number of unproduced projects. Campbell committed suicide by drug overdose in 1963.<ref>Meade 392–3</ref>

==Later life and death==
Following Campbell's death, Parker returned to New York City and the Volney residential hotel. In her later years, she would come to denigrate the group that had brought her such early notoriety, the Algonquin Round Table:
{{Quote | These were no giants. Think who was writing in those days—[[Ring Lardner|Lardner]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald|Fitzgerald]], [[William Faulkner|Faulkner]] and [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]]. Those were the real giants. The Round Table was just a lot of people telling jokes and telling each other how good they were. Just a bunch of loudmouths showing off, saving their gags for days, waiting for a chance to spring them... There was no truth in anything they said.  It was the terrible day of the wisecrack, so there didn't have to be any truth...<ref>Herrmann p. 85.</ref>}}

Parker was heard occasionally on radio, including ''[[Information Please]]'' (as a guest) and ''Author, Author'' (as a regular panelist). She wrote for the ''[[Columbia Workshop]]'', and both [[Ilka Chase]] and [[Tallulah Bankhead]] used her material for radio monologues.<ref>{{cite book| last = Dunning | first = John| title = On The Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 1998| isbn = 0-19-507678-8}}</ref>

Parker died on June 7, 1967, of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]<ref name="NYT obit"/> at the age of 73. In her will, she bequeathed her estate to Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]  Following King's death, her estate was passed on to the [[NAACP]].<ref>Silverstein 59.</ref> Her [[executor]], [[Lillian Hellman]], bitterly but unsuccessfully contested this disposition.<ref>Meade 413.</ref> Her ashes remained unclaimed in various places, including her attorney [[Paul O'Dwyer]]'s filing cabinet, for approximately 17 years.<ref>Meade 412.</ref>

==Posthumous honors==
In 1988, the NAACP claimed Parker's remains and designed a memorial garden for them outside their Baltimore headquarters. The plaque reads,

{{quote|Here lie the ashes of Dorothy Parker (1893–1967) humorist, writer, critic. Defender of human and civil rights. For her epitaph she suggested, 'Excuse my dust'.

[[File:Dorothyparkerlandmark.jpg|thumb|Plaque at Parker's birthplace]]
On August 22, 1992, the 99th anniversary of Parker's birth, the [[United States Postal Service]] issued a 29¢ U.S. commemorative [[postage stamp]] in the Literary Arts series. The Algonquin Round Table, as well as the number of other literary and theatrical greats who lodged there, helped earn the Algonquin Hotel its status as a New York City Historic Landmark. The hotel was so designated in 1987.<ref>{{Cite news | last =Heller Anderson | first =Susan | title =City Makes It Official: Algonquin is Landmark | newspaper =The New York Times | date =September 20, 1987 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6DE1E38F933A1575AC0A961948260 | accessdate = 2007-10-21 }}</ref> In 1996 the hotel was designated a National Literary Landmark by the [[Friends of Libraries]] USA based on the contributions of Parker and other members of the Round Table.

In 2014, Parker was elected to the [[New Jersey Hall of Fame]].

==In popular culture==
Parker was the inspiration for a number of fictional characters in several plays of her day. These included "Lily Malone" in [[Philip Barry]]'s ''Hotel Universe'' (1932), "Mary Hilliard" (played by [[Ruth Gordon]]) in George Oppenheimer's ''Here Today'' (1932), "Paula Wharton" in Gordon's 1944 play ''Over Twenty-one'' (directed by [[George S. Kaufman]]), and "Julia Glenn" in the Kaufman-[[Moss Hart]] collaboration ''[[Merrily We Roll Along (play)|Merrily We Roll Along]]'' (1934). Kaufman's representation of her in ''Merrily We Roll Along'' led Parker, once his Round Table compatriot, to despise him.<ref>Meade 241</ref> She also appeared as "Daisy Lester" in [[Charles Brackett]]'s 1934 novel ''Entirely Surrounded''.<ref>Silverstein 10–11</ref>

Parker appears as a character in the novel ''The Dorothy Parker Murder Case'' by [[George Baxt]] (1984), in a series of "Algonquin Round Table Mysteries" by J.J. Murphy (2011– ), and in Ellen Meister's novel ''Farewell, Dorothy Parker'' (2013).<ref>Meister, Ellen (2013) ''Farewell, Dorothy Parker''. Putnam Adult.  ISBN 039915907X</ref> She is the main character in a short story, "Love For Miss Dottie," by Larry N Mayer, which was selected by Mary Gaitskill for the collection ''Best New American Voices 2009'' (Harcourt).

She has been portrayed on film and television by [[Dolores Sutton]] in ''F. Scott Fitzgerald in Hollywood'' (1976),{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} [[Rosemary Murphy]] in ''Julia'' (1977),{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} [[Bebe Neuwirth]] in ''Dash and Lilly'' (1999),{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} and [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] in ''[[Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle]]'' (1994).<ref>{{IMDb title|0110588|Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle}} Foo {{cite web| title =''Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle''| publisher =Internet Movie Database| url =http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0110588/| accessdate = 2007-09-24 }}</ref> Neuwirth was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for her performance, and Leigh received a number of awards and nominations, including a [[Golden Globe]] nomination.
