In [[molecular biology]], '''DNA ligase''' is a specific type of enzyme, a [[ligase]], ({{EC number|6.5.1.1}}) that facilitates the joining of [[DNA]] strands together by catalyzing the formation of a [[phosphodiester bond]]. It plays a role in repairing single-strand breaks in duplex [[DNA]] in living organisms, but some forms (such as [[LIG4|DNA ligase IV]]) may specifically repair double-strand breaks (i.e. a break in both [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] strands of DNA). Single-strand breaks are repaired by DNA ligase using the complementary strand of the double helix as a template,<ref name="pmid15565146">{{cite journal | author = Pascal JM, O'Brien PJ, Tomkinson AE, Ellenberger T | title = Human DNA ligase I completely encircles and partially unwinds nicked DNA | journal = Nature | volume = 432 | issue = 7016 | pages = 473–8 |date=November 2004 | pmid = 15565146 | doi = 10.1038/nature03082 }}</ref> with DNA ligase creating the final phosphodiester bond to fully repair the DNA.

DNA ligase has applications in both [[DNA repair]] and [[DNA replication]] (see ''[[DNA ligase#Mammalian ligases|Mammalian ligases]]'').  In addition, DNA ligase has extensive use in [[molecular biology]] laboratories for [[recombinant DNA]] experiments (see ''[[DNA ligase#Applications in molecular biology research|Applications in molecular biology research]]''). Purified DNA ligase is used in gene cloning to join DNA molecules together to form [[recombinant DNA]].

==Ligase mechanism==
The mechanism of DNA ligase is to form two [[covalent]] [[phosphodiester bonds]] between [[3' end|3' hydroxyl ends]] of one [[nucleotide]], ("acceptor") with the [[5' end|5' phosphate end]] of another ("donor"). ATP is required for the ligase reaction, which proceeds in three steps: 
# adenylation (addition of AMP) of a lysine residue in the active center of the enzyme, [[pyrophosphate]] is released; 
# transfer of the AMP to the 5' phosphate of the so-called donor, formation of a pyrophosphate bond; 
# formation of a phosphodiester bond between the 5' phosphate of the donor and the 3' hydroxyl of the acceptor.<ref name="pmid4377758">{{cite journal | author = Lehman IR | title = DNA ligase: structure, mechanism, and function | journal = Science | volume = 186 | issue = 4166 | pages = 790–7 |date=November 1974 | pmid = 4377758 | doi = 10.1126/science.186.4166.790  }}</ref>

[[Image:Ligation.svg|thumb|none|upright=2|A pictorial example of how a ligase works (with [[DNA end|sticky end]]s)]]

Ligase will also work with [[DNA end|blunt end]]s, although higher enzyme concentrations and different reaction conditions are required.

== Types of ligases ==

=== ''E. coli'' DNA ligase ===
The ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' DNA ligase is encoded by the ''lig'' gene.  DNA ligase in ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', as well as most prokaryotes, uses energy gained by cleaving [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide]] (NAD) to create the phosphodiester bond.<ref name="foster"/>  It does not ligate blunt-ended DNA except under conditions of molecular crowding with [[polyethylene glycol]], and cannot join RNA to DNA efficiently.

=== T4 DNA ligase ===
The DNA ligase from [[bacteriophage T4]] is the ligase most-commonly used in laboratory research.<ref name="url_www.promega.com">{{cite web | url = https://www.promega.com/~/media/files/resources/product%20guides/cloning%20enzymes/ligases.pdf?la=en+ | title = Ligases | work = Enzyme Resources Guide | publisher = Promega Corporation | pages = 8–14 }}</ref>  It can ligate [[cohesive end|cohesive or "sticky" ends]] of DNA, oligonucleotides, as well as RNA and RNA-DNA hybrids, but not single-stranded nucleic acids.  It can also ligate [[blunt end|blunt-ended DNA]] with much greater efficiency than ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' DNA ligase.  Unlike ''E. coli'' DNA ligase, T4 DNA ligase cannot utilize NAD and it has an absolute requirement for ATP as a cofactor. Some engineering has been done to improve the ''in vitro'' activity of T4 DNA ligase; one successful approach, for example, tested T4 DNA ligase fused to several alternative DNA binding proteins and found that the constructs with either p50 or [[NF-kB]] as fusion partners were over 160% more active in blunt-end ligations for cloning purposes than wild type T4 DNA ligase.<ref name="pmid23754529">{{cite journal | author = Wilson RH, Morton SK, Deiderick H, Gerth ML, Paul HA, Gerber I, Patel A, Ellington AD, Hunicke-Smith SP, Patrick WM | title = Engineered DNA ligases with improved activities in vitro | journal = Protein Eng.

=== Mammalian ligases ===
In mammals, there are four specific types of ligase.
*[[LIG1|DNA ligase I]]: ligates the nascent DNA of the [[DNA replication#Lagging strand|lagging strand]] after the [[RNase H|Ribonuclease H]] has removed the RNA primer from the [[Okazaki fragment]]s.
*DNA ligase III: [[protein complex|complexes]] with [[DNA repair]] [[protein]] [[XRCC1]] to aid in sealing DNA during the process of [[DNA repair|nucleotide excision repair]] and recombinant fragments. Of the all known mammalian DNA ligases, only Lig III has been found to be present in mitochondria.
*[[LIG4|DNA ligase IV]]: complexes with [[XRCC4]].  It catalyzes the final step in the [[non-homologous end joining]] DNA double-strand break repair pathway.  It is also required for [[V(D)J recombination]], the process that generates diversity in [[immunoglobulin]] and [[T-cell receptor]] loci during [[immune system]] development.

DNA ligase from [[eukaryotes]] and some microbes uses [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) rather than NAD.<ref name="foster">{{cite book | author = Foster JB , Slonczewski J | title = Microbiology: An Evolving Science | edition = Second | publisher = W. W. Norton & Company | location = New York | year = 2010 | pages = | isbn = 0-393-93447-0 }}</ref>

===Thermostable ligases===
Ligases from various [[thermophilic bacteria]] have been cloned and sequenced, and are available commercially for use in ligase amplification reaction because of their thermostable properties.

==Measurement of ligase activity==
There are at least three different units used to measure the activity of DNA ligase:<ref name="isbn0-87969-577-3">{{cite book | author = Russell DW, Sambrook J | title = Molecular cloning: a laboratory manual | publisher = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory | location = Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-87969-577-3 | volume = 1 | edition = 3rd | chapter = Chapter 1: Plasmids and Their Usefulness in Molecular Cloning  | pages=1–159 }}</ref>
* '''Weiss unit''' - the amount of ligase that catalyzes the exchange of 1 nmole of <sup>32</sup>P from inorganic [[pyrophosphate]] to ATP in 20 minutes at 37<sup>°</sup>C.  This is the one most commonly used.
* '''Modrich-Lehman unit''' - this is rarely used, and one unit is defined as the amount of enzyme required to convert 100 nmoles of d(A-T)<sub>n</sub> to an exonuclease-III resistant form in 30 minutes under standard conditions.
* Many commercial suppliers of ligases use an arbitrary unit based on the ability of ligase to ligate cohesive ends.  These units are often more subjective than quantitative and lack precision.

== Applications in molecular biology research ==
{{main|Ligation (molecular biology) }}
DNA ligases have become indispensable tools in modern molecular biology research for generating [[recombinant DNA]] sequences.  For example, DNA ligases are used with [[restriction enzyme]]s to insert DNA fragments, often [[genes]], into [[plasmid]]s.

Controlling the optimal temperature is a vital aspect of performing efficient recombination experiments involving the ligation of cohesive-ended fragments.  Most experiments use T4 DNA Ligase (isolated from [[Enterobacteria phage T4|bacteriophage T4]]), which is most active at 37°C.<ref name="isbn978-0471188490">{{cite book | author = F. Baneyx F, Lucotte G | title = Introduction to Molecular Cloning Techniques | publisher = John Wiley & Sons | location = Chichester | year = 1993 | page = 156 | isbn = 978-0471188490 }}</ref>  However, for optimal ligation efficiency with cohesive-ended fragments ("sticky ends"), the optimal enzyme temperature needs to be balanced with the [[DNA melting|melting temperature]] T<sub>m</sub> of the sticky ends being ligated,<ref name="Tabor_2001">{{cite journal | author = Tabor S | title = DNA ligases | journal = Curr Protoc Mol Biol | volume = Chapter 3 | issue = | pages = Unit 3.14 |date=May 2001 | pmid = 18265223 | doi = 10.1002/0471142727.mb0314s08 | isbn = 0471142727 }}</ref> the [[Homologous chromosome|homologous pairing]] of the sticky ends will not be stable because the high temperature disrupts [[hydrogen bonding]]. A ligation reaction is most efficient when the sticky ends are already stably annealed, and disruption of the annealing ends would therefore result in low ligation efficiency. The shorter the [[DNA end#Overhangs and sticky ends|overhang]], the lower the T<sub>m</sub>.

Since blunt-ended DNA fragments have no cohesive ends to anneal, the melting temperature is not a factor to consider within the normal temperature range of the ligation reaction.  However, the higher the temperature, the lower the chance that the ends to be joined will be aligned to allow for ligation (molecules move around the solution more at higher temperatures).  The limiting factor in blunt end ligation is not the activity of the ligase but rather the number of alignments between DNA fragment ends that occur.  The most efficient ligation temperature for blunt-ended DNA would therefore be the temperature at which the greatest number of alignments can occur.  The majority of blunt-ended ligations are carried out at 14-25°C overnight.  The absence of stably annealed ends also means that the ligation efficiency is lowered, requiring a higher ligase concentration to be used.<ref name="Tabor_2001"/>

== History ==
The first DNA ligase was purified and characterized in 1967. The common commercially available DNA ligases were originally discovered in [[Enterobacteria phage T4|bacteriophage T4]], ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' and other [[bacteria]].<ref name="WeissRichardson1967">{{cite journal | author = Weiss B, Richardson CC | title = Enzymatic breakage and joining of deoxyribonucleic acid, I.
