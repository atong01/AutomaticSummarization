'''''Cahiers du Cinéma''''' ({{IPA-fr|kaje dy sinema}}, ''Notebooks on Cinema'') is a [[French language]] [[film]] [[magazine]] founded in 1951 by [[André Bazin]], [[Jacques Doniol-Valcroze]] and [[Joseph-Marie Lo Duca]].<ref name="NYT Itzkoff" /><ref name="Guardian Macnab">Macnab, Geoffrey (7 April 2001) [http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2001/apr/07/books.guardianreview ''Pretentious, nous?''] ''The Guardian''</ref> It developed from the earlier magazine ''Revue du Cinéma'' (''Review of the Cinema'') involving members of two Paris film clubs—''Objectif 49'' (''Objective 49'') ([[Robert Bresson]], [[Jean Cocteau]] and [[Alexandre Astruc]], among others) and ''Ciné-Club du Quartier Latin'' (''Cinema Club of the Latin Quarter''). Initially edited by Doniol-Valcroze and, after 1957, by [[Éric Rohmer]] (Maurice Scherer), it included amongst its writers [[Jacques Rivette]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Claude Chabrol]] and [[François Truffaut]].<ref name="NYT Itzkoff"/>

==History and profile==
''Cahiers'' re-invented the basic tenets of [[film criticism]] and [[film theory|theory]].  A 1954 article by Truffaut attacked ''La qualité française'' ("the French Quality") (usually translated as "The Tradition of Quality") and was the manifesto for 'la politique des Auteurs'<ref name="Guardian Macnab" /> which [[Andrew Sarris]] later termed the [[auteur theory]] &mdash; resulting in the re-evaluation of [[Hollywood]] films and directors such as [[Alfred Hitchcock]], [[Howard Hawks]], [[Robert Aldrich]], [[Nicholas Ray]], and [[Fritz Lang]]. ''Cahiers du Cinema'' authors also championed the work of directors [[Jean Renoir]], [[Roberto Rossellini]], [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], [[Max Ophüls]], and [[Jean Cocteau]], by centering their critical evaluations on a film's ''[[mise en scène]]''. In turn, auteurs were compared and contrasted, and a true film dialogue{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} was established. The magazine also was essential to the creation of the ''[[French New Wave|Nouvelle Vague]]'', or New Wave, of French cinema, which centered on films directed by ''Cahiers'' authors such as Godard and Truffaut. Movement by movement, style by style, the cahiers sought to advance and analyze the growth of world cinema.

Jacques Rivette replaced Rohmer as editor in 1963, shifted political and social concerns and paid more attention to the non-Hollywood cinema. The style moved through literary modernism in the early 1960s to radicalism and [[dialectical materialism]] by 1970. Moreover, during the mid-1970s the magazine was run by a [[Maoist]] editorial collective. In the mid-1970s, a review of the American movie ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' marked the magazine's return to more commercial perspectives, and an editorial turnover: ([[Serge Daney]], [[Serge Toubiana]], [[Thierry Jousse]], [[Antoine de Baecque]] and [[Charles Tesson]]). It led to the rehabilitation of some of the old ''Cahiers'' favourites, as well as some new film makers like [[Manoel de Oliveira]], [[Raoul Ruiz]], [[Hou Hsiao-Hsien]], [[Youssef Chahine]], and [[Maurice Pialat]]. Recent writers have included [[Serge Daney]], Serge Toubiana, Thierry Jousse, Antoine de Baecque, Vincent Ostria, Charles Tesson and [[André Téchiné]], [[Léos Carax]], [[Olivier Assayas]], [[Danièle Dubroux]], and [[Serge Le Péron]].

In 1998, the Editions de l'Etoile (the company publishing ''Cahiers'') was acquired by the press group ''[[Le Monde]]''.<ref>Dowell, Ben (10 February 2009) [http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/feb/10/le-monde-sells-cahiers-du-cinema "''Le Monde'' sells influential cinema magazine ''Cahiers du Cinéma''"] ''The Guardian''</ref> Traditionally losing money, the magazine attempted a make-over in 1999 to gain new readers, leading to a first split among writers and resulting in a magazine addressing all visual arts in a [[post-modernism|post-modernist]] approach. This version of the magazine printed ill-received opinion pieces on [[reality TV]] or [[video game]]s that confused the traditional readership of the magazine.<ref name="NYT Itzkoff" /><ref name="Guardian Macnab" />

''Le Monde'' took full editorial control of the magazine in 2003, appointing [[Jean-Michel Frodon]] as editor-in-chief.

In February 2009, ''Cahiers'' was acquired from ''Le Monde'' by Richard Schlagman, also owner of [[Phaidon Press]], a worldwide publishing group which specialises in books on the visual arts.<ref name="NYT Itzkoff"/> In July 2009, Stéphane Delorme and Jean-Philippe Tessé have been promoted respectively as editor-in-chief and deputy chief editor.
