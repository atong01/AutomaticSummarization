'''Augustin-Jean Fresnel''' ({{IPAc-en|f|r|eɪ|ˈ|n|ɛ|l}} {{respell|fray|NEL|'}}; {{IPA-fr|ɔ.ɡy.stɛ̃ ʒɑ̃ fʁɛ.nɛl|lang}}; 1788–1827)<!--Per MOS, full dates in infobox need not be repeated in lede-->, was a [[France|French]] [[engineer]] and [[physicist]] who contributed significantly to the establishment of the theory of [[wave|wave optics]]. Fresnel studied the behaviour of light both theoretically and experimentally.

He is perhaps best known as the [[inventor]] of the [[Fresnel lens]], first adopted in [[lighthouse]]s while he was a French commissioner of lighthouses, and found in many applications today.  His [[Fresnel equations]] on waves and [[reflectivity]] also form the basis for many applications in [[computer graphics]] today - for instance, the rendering of [[water]].

==Personal life and education==
Fresnel was the  
son of an architect, born at [[Broglie, Eure|Broglie]] ([[Eure]]). His early progress in learning was slow, and he still could not read when he was eight years old. At thirteen he entered the École Centrale in [[Caen]], and at sixteen and a half the [[École Polytechnique]], where he acquitted himself with distinction. From there he went to the [[École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées|École des Ponts et Chaussées]].

He received only scant public recognition during his lifetime for his labours in the cause of optical science. Some of his papers were not printed by the Académie des Sciences until many years after his death. But as he wrote to Young in 1824: in himself "that sensibility, or that vanity, which people call love of glory" had been blunted. "All the compliments," he says, "that I have received from [[François Arago|Arago]], [[Pierre Simon, Marquis de Laplace|Laplace]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Biot|Biot]] never gave me so much pleasure as the discovery of a theoretic truth, or the confirmation of a calculation by experiment".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Fresnel has been described as a man with interest in religious questions and deep faith in God.<ref>Graves, Dan. 1996.

He spent much of his life in Paris, and died of [[tuberculosis]] at [[Ville-d'Avray]], near Paris.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} His is one of the [[List of the 72 names on the Eiffel Tower|72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower]]. The writer [[Prosper Mérimée]] (1803-1870) was his first cousin.

==Career==
[[File:David d'Angers - Fresnel.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Bust of Augustin Fresnel by [[David d'Angers]].]]

He served as an engineer successively in the departments of [[Vendée]], [[Drôme]] and [[Ille-et-Vilaine]]; but having supported the [[Bourbon house|Bourbons]] in 1814 he lost his appointment on [[Napoleon]]'s return to power.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} He appears to have begun his research in optics around 1814, when he prepared a paper on the [[aberration of light]], although it was never published. In 1815, on the second restoration of the monarchy, he obtained a post as engineer in [[Paris]].

In 1818 he wrote a memoir on [[diffraction]], for which he received the prize of the [[French Academy of Sciences|Académie des Sciences]] at Paris the following year. He was the first to construct a special type of lens, now called a [[Fresnel lens]], as a substitute for mirrors in lighthouses. In 1819, he was nominated to be a commissioner of lighthouses.  In 1823 he was unanimously elected a member of the academy. In 1825 he became a member of the [[Royal Society of London]].  In 1827, the time of his last illness, the Royal Society of London awarded him the [[Rumford Medal]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1818 he published his Memoir on the Diffraction of Light, submitted to the Academe of science in 1818.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fresnel|first=Augustin|year=1819|chapter=Memoir on the Diffraction of Light|title=The Wave Theory of Light – Memoirs by Huygens, Young and Fresnel|publisher=American Book Company|pages=79–145|url=http://books.google.com/?id=_0hWAAAAMAAJ&dq=memoir%20of%20fresnel&pg=PA79#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> His discoveries and mathematical deductions, building on experimental work by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]], extended the [[Huygens' principle|wave theory]] of [[light]] to a large class of [[optical phenomenon|optical phenomena]], especially, to the [[Birefringence|double-refraction]] property of [[Iceland Spar]], or [[calcite]].<ref name="Whittaker">[[E. T. Whittaker|Whittaker, E. T.]], ''A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity''. Dublin University Press, 1910.</ref>

In 1817, Young had proposed a small transverse component to light, while yet retaining a far larger longitudinal component. Fresnel, by the year 1821, was able to show by mathematical methods that [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] could be explained only if light was ''entirely'' transverse, with no longitudinal vibration whatsoever.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fresnel|first=Augustin|year=1819|chapter=On the Action of Rays of Polarized Light upon Each Other|title=The Wave Theory of Light – Memoirs by Huygens, Young and Fresnel|publisher=American Book Company|pages=145–56|url=http://books.google.com/?id=_0hWAAAAMAAJ&dq=memoir%20of%20fresnel&pg=PA145#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> He proposed the [[aether drag hypothesis]] to explain a lack of variation in astronomical observations. His use of two plane mirrors of metal, forming with each other an angle of nearly 180°, allowed him to avoid the diffraction effects caused (by the apertures) in the experiment of [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi|F. M. Grimaldi]] on [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]]. This allowed him to conclusively account for the phenomenon of interference in accordance with the wave theory.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Polarized light research==
[[Image:fresnel rhomb.svg|thumb | left | 200px | A diagram of a Fresnel rhomb (blue). Incoming light, if linearly polarized at 45° with respect to the [[plane of incidence]] (along the page) has the relative phase of its ''s'' and ''p'' [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] components altered at two reflections, outputting a [[circularly polarized]] beam.]]
With [[François Arago]] he studied the laws of the interference of polarized rays. He obtained circularly polarized light by means of a rhombus of glass, known as a [[Fresnel rhomb]], having obtuse angles of 126° and acute angles of 54°. The [[Fresnel–Arago laws]] are three laws which summarise some of the more important properties of [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] between light of different states of [[polarization (waves)|polarization]]. The laws are as follows:<ref>[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Fresnel-AragoLaws.html World of Physics]</ref>
* Two [[orthogonal]], [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]] linearly [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]] waves cannot interfere.
* Two parallel coherent linearly polarized waves will interfere in the same way as [[Sunlight|natural light]].
* The two constituent orthogonal linearly polarized states of natural light cannot interfere to form a readily observable interference pattern, even if rotated into alignment (because they are incoherent).

The [[Fresnel equations]] describe the behaviour of [[light]] when moving between [[medium (optics)|media]] of differing [[refractive index|refractive indices]]. When light moves from a medium of a given [[refractive index]] ''n''<sub>1</sub> into a second medium with refractive index ''n''<sub>2</sub>, both [[reflection (physics)|reflection]] and [[refraction]] of the light may occur.

The [[Fresnel diffraction]] equation is an approximation of [[Kirchhoff's diffraction formula|Kirchhoff-Fresnel diffraction]] that can be applied to the propagation of waves in the [[near and far field|near field]].<ref>[[Max Born|M. Born]] & E. Wolf, Principles of Optics, 1999, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge</ref>  It is used to calculate the [[diffraction pattern]] created by waves passing through an aperture or around an object, when viewed from relatively close to the object.  In contrast the diffraction pattern in the [[near and far field|far field]] region is given by the [[Fraunhofer diffraction]] equation.
