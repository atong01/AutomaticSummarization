'''''The Downward Spiral''''' is the second [[studio album]] by American [[industrial rock]] band [[Nine Inch Nails]], released March 8, 1994, on [[Interscope Records]]. It is a [[concept album]] detailing the destruction of a man, from the beginning of his "downward spiral" to his attempt at [[suicide]]. ''The Downward Spiral'' features elements of industrial rock, [[techno]], and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], in contrast to the [[synthpop]]-influenced ''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]''.

Co-produced by [[Trent Reznor]] and [[Flood (producer)|Flood]], ''The Downward Spiral'' was conceived after the [[Lollapalooza]] 1991 festival tour as a pivot for Reznor's personal issues and the "negative vibe" felt by the band. Reznor moved to [[10050 Cielo Drive (Los Angeles)|10050 Cielo Drive]], Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles in [[Beverly Hills, California]] the following year, where actress [[Sharon Tate]] was murdered by members of the [[Manson Family]]. It was used as a studio called "Le Pig" for recording ''[[Broken (EP)|Broken]]'' and ''The Downward Spiral'' with collaborations from other musicians. The album was influenced by late 1970s rock music albums, [[David Bowie]]'s ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'' and [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[The Wall]]'' in particular, and focused on texture and space, avoiding explicit usage of guitars or [[synthesizers]].

''The Downward Spiral'' was promoted with the [[Self Destruct Tour]] and four songs from the album ("[[March of the Pigs]]", "[[Closer (Nine Inch Nails song)|Closer]]", "[[Piggy (song)|Piggy]]", and "[[Hurt (Nine Inch Nails song)|Hurt]]") became singles. The tour's concerts debuted the band's grungy and messy image and were violent and chaotic, with band members often injuring themselves and destroying their instruments. "March of the Pigs" and "Closer" were accompanied by music videos; the "March of the Pigs" video was shot twice and "Closer"'s was heavily censored. "Piggy" and "Hurt" were released as promotional singles.

A major commercial success, ''The Downward Spiral'' established Nine Inch Nails as a reputable force in the 1990s music scene, with its sound being widely imitated and Reznor receiving media hype and multiple honors while diverging into drug abuse and depression. It has been regarded by music critics and audiences as one of the most important albums of the 1990s and was praised for its abrasive, eclectic nature and dark themes, although it was scrutinized by social conservatives for its lyrics. A companion [[remix album]], ''[[Further Down the Spiral]]'', was released in 1995. To mark the album's tenth anniversary, ''The Downward Spiral'' was remastered and re-released on November 23, 2004 in high-resolution [[Super Audio CD|SACD]] and [[DualDisc]] formats.

==Writing and recording==
[[File:Adrian Belew (2009).jpg|thumb|[[Adrian Belew]]'s approach to guitar parts on the album improved Reznor's confidence in the instrument.]]
''The Downward Spiral'' was conceived after the Lollapalooza festival tour as Trent Reznor thought of a "negative vibe" felt by the band when they were in a European hotel. [[Nine Inch Nails live performances]] were known for its aggressive on-stage dynamic, in which band members act angry, injure themselves, and destroy instruments. Reznor had a [[Trent Reznor–TVT Records feud|feud]] with [[TVT Records]] that resulted in him co-founding Nothing Records with his former manager [[John Malm, Jr.]] and signing with Interscope. He wanted to explore a fictional character whose life is psychologically wounded and developed a concept about the album's themes; he later used the concept as lyrics. The concept was based on Reznor's social issues at the time: he had personal conflicts with band member [[Richard Patrick]] and was known for enjoying [[alcohol]].<ref name="Huxley">{{cite book

He called his first night in 10050 Cielo Drive "terrifying" because he already knew it and read books related to the incident. Reznor chose the Tate house to calibrate his engineering skills and the band bought a large console and two Studer machines as resources, a move that he believed was cheaper than renting.{{sfn|Huxley|1997|p=97–99}} The studio was also used for the recording of [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]]'s debut album ''[[Portrait of an American Family]]'', which Reznor co-produced.

Reznor took a similar approach to recording guitar parts: he would tape 20 to 25-minute long sessions of himself playing guitars on a hard disc recorder with the Studio Vision sequencer.<ref name="Machine Head"/>

Most of the music was recorded into a [[Macintosh]] computer using a board and manipulated with music editor programs on the computer. Unique effects such as analyzing and inverting the frequency were applied to the tracks to create original sounds.

In December 1993, Reznor was confronted by Patti Tate, who asked if he was exploiting Sharon Tate's death in the house. Reznor responded that he was interested in the house as her death happened there. He later made a statement about this encounter during a 1997 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'':

{{quote|While I was working on ''[The] Downward Spiral'', I was living in the house where Sharon Tate was killed. Then one day I met her sister [Patti Tate]. It was a random thing, just a brief encounter. And she said: 'Are you exploiting my sister's death by living in her house?' For the first time, the whole thing kind of slapped me in the face. I said, 'No, it's just sort of my own interest in American folklore. I'm in this place where a weird part of history occurred.' I guess it never really struck me before, but it did then. She lost her sister from a senseless, ignorant situation that I don't want to support. When she was talking to me, I realized for the first time, 'What if it was my sister?' I thought, 'Fuck [[Charles Manson|Charlie Manson]].' I went home and cried that night.

Flood, known for engineering and producing [[U2 (band)|U2]] and [[Depeche Mode]] albums, was employed as co-producer on ''The Downward Spiral''.

Numerous layers of metaphors are present throughout ''The Downward Spiral'', which leaves it open to wide interpretation. The album relays [[nihilism]] and is defined by a prominent theme of [[self-destructive behaviour|self-abuse]] and [[Self-control|control]]. It is a semi-autobiographical concept album in which the overarching plot follows the protagonist's descent into madness in his own inner [[solipsism|solipsistic]] world, through a metaphorical "Downward Spiral", dealing with religion, dehumanization, violence, disease, society, drugs, sex, and finally suicide.{{sfn|Huxley|1997|p=120}}<ref name=Allmusic>{{Allmusic |class=album |tab=review |id=r198574 |first=Steve |last=Huey |accessdate=April 27, 2004 }}</ref><ref name="The Quietus"/> Reznor described the concept as consisting of "someone who sheds everything around them to a potential nothingness, but through career, religion, relationship, belief and so on."<ref name="Trent Reznor 1994 Select" /> Media journalists like ''[[The New York Times]]'' writer [[Jon Pareles]] noted the album's theme of angst had already been used by [[grunge]] bands like [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], and that Nine Inch Nails' depiction was more generalized.<ref name="NY Times"/>

''The Downward Spiral'' features elements of industrial rock, techno, and heavy metal, a change from the synthpop-influenced ''Pretty Hate Machine''. Reznor regularly uses noise and distortion in his song arrangements that do not follow [[verse–chorus form]], and incorporates dissonance with chromatic melody or harmony (or both). The treatment of metal guitars in ''Broken'' is carried over to ''The Downward Spiral'', which includes innovative techniques such as expanded song structures and unconventional time signatures.{{sfn|Huxley|1997|p=109–121}}<ref name="Allmusic"/> The album features a wide range of textures and moods to illustrate the mental progress a central character.<ref name="Details">{{cite journal | title = The Art of Darkness | last = Heath | first = Chris | authorlink = Chris Heath | journal = [[Details (magazine)|Details]] | publisher = [[Condé Nast Publications]] |date=April 1995}}</ref> Reznor's singing follows a similar pattern from beginning to end, frequently moving from whispers to screams.<ref name="NIN-WT-IGN">{{Cite web | url=http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/manager/display_article.php?id=84 | work=IGN | title=Nine Inch Nails - With Teeth | author=Spence D. | date=May 3, 2005 | accessdate=January 29, 2014 | publisher=Ziff Davis}}</ref> These techniques are all used in the song "Hurt", which features a highly dissonant [[tritone]] played on guitar during the verses, a B5#11, emphasized when Reznor sings the eleventh note on the word "I" every time the B/E# [[dyad (music)|dyad]] is played.<ref>{{Cite book

"Mr. Self Destruct", a song about a powerful person, follows a build-up sampled from ''[[THX 1138]]'' with an "industrial roar" and is accompanied by an audio loop of a pinion rotating.

==Cover art==
''Committere'', an installation featuring artwork and sketches for ''The Downward Spiral'', "Closer" and "March of the Pigs" by [[Russell Mills (artist)|Russell Mills]] was displayed at the [[Glasgow School of Art]]. Mills explained the ideas and materials that made up the painting (titled "Wound") that was used for the [[cover art]]:

{{quote|I had been thinking about making works that dealt with layers, physically, materially and conceptually. I wanted to produce works that were about both exposure and revealing and at the same dealt with closure and covering. Given the nature of the lyrics and the power of the music I was working with, I felt justified in attempting to make works that alluded to the apparently contradictory imagery of pain and healing. I wanted to make beautiful surfaces that partially revealed the visceral rawness of open wounds beneath. The mixed media work 'Wound' was the first piece I tackled in this vein (no pun intended) and it became the cover of the album. It is made of plaster, acrylics, oils, rusted metals, insects, moths, blood (mine), wax, varnishes, and surgical bandaging on a wooden panel.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://web.archive.org/web/20100503082254/http://www.shedmatter.co.uk/russellmills/mills/installations/committere.html| title = Committere| author = Russell Mills| year = 2006| accessdate = April 25, 2009}}</ref>}}

===Tour===
{{See also|Self Destruct Tour}}
[[File:Trent Reznor Self-Destruct.jpg|thumb|Reznor performing during the Self Destruct tour, circa 1994–1995]]
The Nine Inch Nails live band embarked on the Self Destruct tour in support of ''The Downward Spiral''. Chris Vrenna and [[James Woolley]] performed drums and keyboards respectively, [[Robin Finck]] replaced [[Richard Patrick]] on guitar and bassist [[Danny Lohner]] was added to the line-up. The stage set-up consisted of dirty curtains which would pulled down and up for visuals shown during songs such as "Hurt". The back of the stage was littered with darker and standing lights, along with very little actual ones. The tour debuted the band's grungy and messy image in which they would come out in ragged clothes slathered in corn starch. The concerts were violent and chaotic, with band members often injuring themselves. They would frequently destroy their instruments at the end of concerts, attack each other, and stage-dive into the crowd.{{sfn|Huxley|1997|p=145–148}}

The tour included a set at [[Woodstock '94]] broadcast on [[Pay-per-view]] and seen in as many as 24&nbsp;million homes. The band being covered in mud was a result of pre-concert backstage play, contrary to the belief that it was an attention-grabbing ploy, thus making it difficult for Reznor to navigate the stage: Reznor pushed Lohner into the mud pit as the concert began and saw mud from his hair entering his eyes while performing. Nine Inch Nails was widely proclaimed to have "stolen the show" from its popular contemporaries, mostly classic rock bands, and its fan base expanded.{{sfn|Huxley|1997|p=151–153}}<ref name="PPV">{{cite journal

''The Downward Spiral''{{'}}s release date was delayed at various times to slow down Reznor's intended pace of the album's recording. The first delay caused the process of setting up Le Pig to take longer than he expected, and its release was postponed again as he was educating himself different ways to write songs that did not resemble those on ''Broken'' and ''Pretty Hate Machine''. He considered delivering the album to Interscope in early 1993, only to experience a [[writer's block]] as he was unable to produce any satisfactory material. Interscope grew impatient and concerned with this progress, but Reznor was not forced by their demands of expediency despite crediting the label for giving him creative freedom. He told rock music producer [[Rick Rubin]] that his motivation for creating the album was to get it finished, thus Rubin responded that Reznor might not do so until he makes music that is allowed to be heard. Reznor realized that he was in the most fortunate situation he imagined when the album was recorded with a normal budget, "cool" equipment, and a studio to work at.<ref name="Huxley"/>

Many music critics and audiences praised ''The Downward Spiral'' for its abrasive, eclectic nature and dark themes and commented on the concept of a destruction of a man.<ref name="Huxley"/> ''The New York Times'' writer Jon Pareles' review of the album found the music to be highly abrasive. Pareles asserted that unlike other electro-industrial groups like [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] and [[Nitzer Ebb]], "Reznor writes full-fledged tunes" with stronger use of melodies than riffs.

==Legacy==
The immediate success of ''The Downward Spiral'' established Nine Inch Nails as a reputable force in the 1990s. The band's image and musical style became highly recognizable that a [[Gatorade]] commercial featured a remix of "[[Down in It]]" without its involvement. Reznor felt uncomfortable with the media hype and success the band earned, received false reports of his death, depression, and relationship with mass murderer [[Jeffrey Dahmer]], and was depicted as a sex icon due to his visual identity.{{sfn|Huxley|1997|p=165–180}} Nine Inch Nails received several honors, including Grammy Award nominations for [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Performance]] for ''The Downward Spiral'' and [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song|Best Rock Song]] for "Hurt".{{sfn|Huxley|1997|p=207}} After the release of ''The Downward Spiral'', many bands such as [[Gravity Kills]], [[Stabbing Westward]], [[Filter (band)|Filter]], and [[Mötley Crüe]] made albums that imitated the sound of Nine Inch Nails.<ref name=RS763>{{cite news |newspaper=Rolling Stone |publisher=Wenner Media |issue=763 |date=June 26, 1997 | first=Jon |last=Wiederhorn |title=Generation Swine |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/generation-swine-19970626 |accessdate=March 8, 2014}}</ref><ref name="StereogumTDS20">{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1668716/the-downward-spiral-turns-20/franchises/the-anniversary|title=The Downward Spiral turns 20|author=Tom Breihan|work=Stereogum|date=March 7, 2014|accessdate=March 27, 2014}}</ref>

Reznor interpreted ''The Downward Spiral'' as an extension of himself that "became the truth fulfilling itself," as he experienced personal and social issues presented in the album after its release.

Retrospective reviews regard ''The Downward Spiral'' as one of the most important albums of the 1990s and Reznor's greatest work.

==Controversy==
Its emphasis on transgressive themes made ''The Downward Spiral''{{'}}s lyrics vulnerable to criticism from [[Conservatism in the United States#Social conservatism and tradition|American social conservatives]]. Senator [[Bob Dole]], then head of the Republican Party, sharply denounced [[Time Warner]] after a meeting between [[Michael J. Fuchs]] (head of the [[Warner Music Group]]), [[William Bennett]], and [[C.

;'''Deluxe Edition''' (Halo 8 DE)
To mark the album's tenth anniversary, ''The Downward Spiral'' was re-released on November 23, 2004 in high-resolution SACD and DualDisc formats. Disc one of the album's deluxe edition re-release is nearly identical to the original version; track anomalies such as sounds from previous tracks creeping up on start of tracks are fixed, and it includes a stereo and multi-channel [[Super Audio CD|SACD]] layer. The second bonus disc is a collection of remixes and b-sides and also includes a stereo SACD layer in addition to the Redbook CD layer. The last three tracks on the bonus disc are previously unreleased demo recordings from the original album.<ref name="TDS10">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/66210/nin-revisits-the-downward-spiral|author=Billboard staff|title=NIN Revisits ''The Downward Spiral''|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=November 2004|accessdate=November 14, 2013}}</ref><ref name="Allmusic TDSDE">{{Allmusic|author=Steve Huey|class=album|id=r717657|label=The Downward Spiral (Deluxe Edition)|accessdate=March 29, 2014}}</ref>
