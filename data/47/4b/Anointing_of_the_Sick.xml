However, the reception of the Mystery is not limited to those who are enduring physical illness. The Mystery is given for healing (both physical and spiritual) and for the forgiveness of sin. For this reason, it is normally required that one go to confession before receiving Unction. Because it is a Sacred Mystery of the Church, only Orthodox Christians may receive it.</paragraph><paragraph>The solemn form of Eastern Christian anointing requires the ministry of seven priests. A table is prepared, upon which is set a vessel containing<space/><link><target>wheat</target></link>. Into the wheat has been placed an empty shrine-lamp, seven candles, and seven anointing brushes. Candles are distributed for all to hold during the service. The rite begins with reading<space/><link><target>Psalm 51</target><part>Psalm 50</part></link><space/>(the great penitential psalm), followed by the chanting of a special<space/><link><target>Canon (hymnography)</target><part>canon</part></link>. After this, the senior priest (or bishop) pours pure olive oil and a small amount of wine into the shrine lamp, and says the &quot;Prayer of the Oil&quot;, which calls upon God to &quot;...sanctify this Oil, that it may be effectual for those who shall be anointed therewith, unto healing, and unto relief from every passion, every malady of the flesh and of the spirit, and every ill...&quot; Then follow seven series of<space/><link><target>epistle</target><trail>s</trail></link>,<space/><link><target>gospel</target><trail>s</trail></link>, long prayers,<space/><link><target>Ektenia</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>(litanies) and anointings.

The afflicted one is anointed with the<space/><link><target>sign of the cross</target></link><space/>on seven places: the forehead, the nostrils, the cheeks, the lips, the breast, the palms of both hands, and the back of the hands. After the last anointing, the<space/><link><target>Gospel Book</target></link><space/>is opened and placed with the writing down upon the head of the one who was anointed, and the senior priest reads the &quot;Prayer of the Gospel&quot;. At the end, the anointed kisses the Gospel, the Cross and the right hands of the priests, receiving their blessing.</paragraph><paragraph>Anointing is considered to be a public rather than a private sacrament, and so as many of the faithful who are able are encouraged to attend. It should be celebrated in the church when possible, but if this is impossible, it may be served in the home or hospital room of the afflicted.</paragraph><paragraph>Unction in the<space/><link><target>Greek Orthodox Church</target></link><space/>and Churches of Hellenic custom (<link><target>Melkite</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Antiochian Orthodox</target></link>, etc.) is usually given with a minimum of ceremony.</paragraph><paragraph>Anointing may also be given during<space/><link><target>Clean Monday</target><part>Forgiveness Vespers</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Holy Week</target><part>Great Week</part></link>, on<space/><link><target>Holy Wednesday</target><part>Great and Holy Wednesday</part></link>, to all who are prepared.

Just as her sins were forgiven because of her penitence, so the faithful are exhorted to repent of their sins. In the same narrative, Jesus says, &quot;in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial&quot; (Id., v. 12), linking the unction with Christ's death and resurrection.</paragraph><paragraph>In some<space/><link><target>diocese</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>of the<space/><link><target>Russian Orthodox Church</target></link><space/>it is customary for the bishop to visit each parish or region of the diocese some time during<space/><link><target>Great Lent</target></link><space/>and give Anointing for the faithful, together with the local clergy.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Anglican churches</heading><paragraph>The 1552 and later editions of the<space/><link><target>Book of Common Prayer</target></link><space/>omitted the form of anointing given in the original (1549) version in its Order for the Visitation of the Sick, but most twentieth-century Anglican prayer books do have anointing of the sick.<extension extension_name='ref' name="ODCC"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Some Anglicans accept that anointing of the sick has a sacramental character and is therefore a channel of God's grace, seeing it as an &quot;outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace&quot; which is the definition of a sacrament.

Protestant communities generally vary widely on the sacramental character of anointing. Most Mainline Protestants recognize only two sacraments, the Eucharist and baptism, deeming Anointing only a humanly-instituted rite. Non-traditional Protestant communities generally use the term &quot;<link><target>Ordinance (Christian)</target><part>ordinance</part></link>&quot; rather than &quot;Sacrament&quot;.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Mainline beliefs</heading><paragraph><link><target>Liturgical</target></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>Mainline Protestant</target></link><space/>communities (e.g.<space/><link><target>Presbyterian</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Congregational church</target><part>Congregationalist</part></link>/<link><target>United Church of Christ</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Methodist</target></link>, etc.) all have official yet often optional liturgical rites for the anointing of the sick partly on the model of Western pre-Reformation rites. Anointing need not be associated with grave illness or imminent danger of death.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Charismatic and Pentecostal beliefs</heading><paragraph>In<space/><link><target>Charismatic (Christians)</target><part>Charismatic</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Pentecostal</target></link><space/>communities, anointing of the sick is a frequent practice and has been an important ritual in these communities since the respective movements were founded in the 19th and 20th centuries. These communities use extemporaneous forms of administration at the discretion of the minister, who need not be a pastor. There is minimal ceremony attached to its administration. Usually, several people physically touch (laying on of hands) the recipient during the anointing. It may be part of a worship service with the full assembly of the congregation present, but may also be done in more private settings, such as homes or hospital rooms. Some Pentecostals believe that physical healing is within the anointing and so there is often great expectation or at least great hope that a miraculous cure or improvement will occur when someone is being prayed over for healing.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Evangelical and fundamentalist beliefs</heading><paragraph>In<space/><link><target>Evangelicalism</target><part>Evangelical</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Fundamentalism</target><part>Fundamentalist</part></link><space/>communities, anointing of the sick is performed with varying degrees of frequency, although laying on of hands may be more common than anointing. The rite would be similar to that of Pentecostals in its simplicity, but would usually not have the same emotionalism attached to it. Unlike some Pentecostals, Evangelicals and Fundamentalists generally do not believe that physical healing is within the anointing. Therefore, God may or may not grant physical healing to the sick. The healing conferred by anointing is thus a spiritual event that may not result in physical recovery.</paragraph><paragraph>The Church of the Brethren practices Anointing with Oil as an ordinance along with Baptism, Communion, Laying on of Hands, and the Love Feast.</paragraph><paragraph>Evangelical Protestants who use anointing differ about whether the person doing the anointing must be an ordained member of the<space/><link><target>clergy</target></link>, whether the oil must necessarily be olive oil and have been previously specially consecrated, and about other details. Several Evangelical groups reject the practice so as not to be identified with<space/><link><target>Charismatic movement</target><part>charismatic</part></link><space/>and Pentecostal groups, which practice it widely.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Use of Catholic rite among Protestants</heading><paragraph>Some Protestant US military chaplains carry the Roman Rite version of the Anointing of the Sick with them for use if called upon to assist wounded or dying soldiers who are Catholics. The Catholic and Orthodox Churches consider invalid<space/><italics>as a sacrament</italics><space/>the administration of Anointing of the Sick by such chaplains, who in the eyes of those Churches are not validly ordained priests. The rite performed by them is thus seen as having the same by no means negligible value of any other form of prayer offered for the sick or dying.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Latter Day Saint movement</heading><heading level='4'>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</heading><paragraph><link><target>Latter Day Saint movement</target><part>Latter-day Saints</part></link>, who consider themselves<space/><link><target>Restorationism (Christian primitivism)</target><part>restorationists</part></link>, also practice ritual anointing of the sick, as well as other forms of anointing.
