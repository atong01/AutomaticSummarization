{{Books of the New Testament}}
The '''Epistle of Jude''', often shortened to '''Jude''', is the penultimate book of the [[New Testament]] and is attributed to [[Jude, brother of Jesus|Jude]],  the brother of [[Jesus]] and [[James the Just]]. <!-- Jude was written by Judas (Yehudah), brother of James (Yacob) and Jesus (Yeshova). (See Mark 6:3 "Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?").-->

== Composition ==
The letter of Jude was one of the disputed books of the [[Biblical canon|Canon]]. Although its canonical status was [[Antilegomena|contested]],  its authenticity was never doubted by the [[Early Church]].  The links between the Epistle and [[2 Peter]], its use of the [[Apocryphal]] Books, and its brevity raised concern.<ref>Eusebius, ''Church History'' 2 23</ref>  It is one of the shortest books in the Bible, being only 25 verses long.

== Content ==
Jude urges his readers to defend the deposit of Christ's doctrine that had been closed by the time he wrote his epistle, and to remember the words of the apostles spoken somewhat before.  He uses language similar to the second epistle of Peter to answer concerns that the Lord seemed to tarry, ''How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts...''

Jude then asks the reader to recall how even after the Lord saved his people out of the land of Egypt, he did not hesitate to destroy those who fell into unbelief, much as he punished the angels who fell from their original exalted status.

Jude quotes directly from the [[Book of Enoch]], part of the scripture of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church|Ethiopian]] and [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Eritrean church]]es but rejected by other churches. He cites Enoch's prophecy that the Lord would come with many thousands of his saints to render judgement on the whole world.  He also paraphrases an incident in a text that has been lost about Satan and Michael quarrelling over the body of Moses.

=== Canonical status ===
The Epistle of Jude is held as canonical in the Christian Church. Although some scholars consider the letter a [[pseudonym]]ous work written between the end of the 1st century and the first quarter of the 2nd century, arguing from the references to the [[apostles]],<ref>Jude: 17–18</ref> tradition;<ref>Jude:3</ref> and the book's competent Greek style, conservative scholars date it between 66 and 90.<ref name="NAB">[http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/jude/jude.htm USCCB – NAB – Jude]</ref><ref>Norman Perrin, (1974) ''The New Testament: An Introduction'', p. 260</ref><ref>Bauckham,RJ (1986), [[Word Biblical Commentary]], Vol.50, Word (UK) Ltd. p.16</ref>

"More remarkable is the evidence that by the end of the second century Jude was widely accepted as canonical."<ref>Bauckham,RJ (1986), [[Word Biblical Commentary]], Vol.50, Word (UK) Ltd. p.17</ref> [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Tertullian]] and the [[Muratorian fragment|Muratorian canon]] considered the letter canonical. The first historical record of doubts as to authorship are found in the writings of [[Origen of Alexandria]], who spoke of the doubts held by some—albeit not him. [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] classified it with the "disputed writings, the ''[[antilegomena]].''" The letter was eventually accepted as part of the Canon by the [[Church Fathers]] such as [[Athanasius]] and the [[Synod of Laodicea|Synods of Laodicea]] (c. 363) and [[Councils of Carthage|Carthage]] (397).

=== Authorship ===
The [[Epistle]] title is written as follows: "Jude, a servant of [[Jesus]] Christ and brother of James" ([[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]]). There is a dispute as to whether "brother" means someone who has the same father and mother, or a half-brother or cousin or more distant familial relationship. This dispute over the true meaning of "brother" grew as the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|doctrine of the Virgin Birth]] evolved.<ref>Jocelyn Rhys, ''Shaken Creeds: The Virgin Birth Doctrine a Study of Its Origin'', Kessinger Publishing, 2003 ISBN 0-7661-7988-5, pp 3–53</ref><ref>Chester, A and Martin, RP (1994), 'The Theology of the Letters of James, Peter and Jude', CUP, p.65</ref><ref>Bauckham,RJ (1986), [[Word Biblical Commentary]], Vol.50, Word (UK) Ltd. p.14</ref>

The debate has continued over the author's identity as the apostle, the brother of Jesus, both, or neither. Some scholars have argued that since the author of that letter has not identified himself as an apostle and actually refers to the apostles as a third party, he cannot be identified with the [[Jude the Apostle|Jude who is listed as one of the Twelve]] (and, in the Gospel of Luke, is explicitly identified as being as "of James").<ref>Luke 6:16</ref><ref>Acts 1:13</ref><ref>John 14:22</ref> Others have drawn the opposite conclusion, i.e., that as an apostle, he would not have made such a claim on his own behalf.<ref>Bauckham,RJ (1986), [[Word Biblical Commentary]], Vol.50, Word (UK) Ltd. p.14f</ref> The many [[Jude, brother of Jesus|Jude]]s, named in the gospels and among the [[Desposyni|relatives of Jesus]],<ref>Matthew 13:55</ref><ref>Mark 6:3</ref> and his relationship to James the Just called the brother of Jesus has caused much confusion. Not a lot is known of Jude, which would explain the apparent need to identify him by reference to his better-known brother.<ref name="NAB"/> It is agreed that he is not the Jude who betrayed Jesus, [[Judas Iscariot]].

=== Style ===
The ''Epistle of Jude'' is a brief book of only a single chapter with 25 verses. It was composed as an ''[[encyclical]] letter''—that is, one not directed to the members of one church in particular, but intended rather to be circulated and read in all churches. The form, as opposed to the earlier letters of Paul, suggests that the author knew Paul's ''[[Epistle to the Ephesians]]'' or even that the Pauline epistles had already been collected and were circulating when the text was written.

The wording and syntax of this epistle in its original Greek demonstrates that the author was capable and fluent. The epistle is addressed to Christians in general,<ref>Jude 1:1</ref> and it warns them about the doctrine of certain errant teachers to whom they were exposed. Examples of [[heterodoxy|heterodox]] opinions that were circulating in the early 2nd century include [[Docetism]], [[Marcionism]], and [[Gnosticism]].

The epistle's style is combative, impassioned, and rushed. Many examples of evildoers and warnings about their fates are given in rapid succession. The epithets contained in this writing are considered to be some of the strongest found in the New Testament.

The epistle concludes with a [[doxology]], which is considered to be one of the highest in quality contained in the Bible. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

== Jude and 2 Peter ==
Part of Jude is very similar to [[2 Peter]] (mainly 2 Peter chapter 2), so much so that most scholars agree that there is a dependence between the two; that either one letter used the other directly, or they both drew on a common source.<ref>''Introduction to 2 Peter'' in ''Expositor's Bible Commentary'', Ed. F.E.Gaebelein, Zondervan 1976–1992</ref>

Because this epistle is much shorter than 2 Peter, and due to various stylistic details, some writers consider that Jude was the source for the similar passages of 2 Peter.<ref>e.g. Terrance Callan, ''Use of the Letter of Jude by the Second Letter of Peter'', in ''Biblica'' 85 (2004), pp. 42–64.</ref> However other writers, noting that Jude 18 quotes 2 Peter 3:3 as past tense, consider that Jude came after 2 Peter.<ref>e.g. John MacArthur ''1, 2, 3, John Jude'' 2007 p101 "...closely parallels that of 2 Peter (2:1–3:4), and it is believed that Peter's writing predated Jude for several reasons: (1) Second Peter anticipates the coming of false teachers (2 Pet. 2:1–2; 3:3), whereas Jude deals with their arrival (vv. 4, 11–12, 17–18); and (2) Jude quotes directly from 2 Peter 3:3 and acknowledges that it is from an apostle (vv. 17–18)."</ref>

Some scholars who consider Jude to predate 2 Peter note that the latter appears to quote the former but excises the reference to the non-canonical Enoch.<ref>[[Dale Martin]] 2009 (lecture).

== References to other books ==
The Epistle of Jude references at least two other books, with one being non-canonical in all churches and the other non-canonical in most churches.

:'''Verse 9''' refers to a dispute between [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]] and the [[devil]] about the body of [[Moses]]. Some interpreters {{Who?|date=June 2014}} understand this reference to be an allusion to the events described in Zechariah 3:1-2. {{Citation Needed|date=June 2014}} The classical theologian [[Origen]] attributes this reference to the non-canonical [[Assumption of Moses]].<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf04.vi.v.iv.iv.html Origen]</ref> According to [[James Charlesworth]], there is no evidence the surviving book of this name ever contained any such content.<ref name="OTP">James Charlesworth ''Old Testament Pseudepigrapha'', p. 76, [http://books.google.com/books?id=eRQ9AAAAIAAJ&lpg=PP1&dq=James%20Charlesworth&pg=PA76#v=onepage&q=Jude%20Moses&f=false Google books link]</ref> Others believe it to be in the lost ending of the book.<ref name="OTP"/><ref>The Assumption of Moses: a critical edition with commentary By Johannes Tromp. P270</ref>

:'''Verses 14–15''' contains a direct quote of a prophecy from 1En.1:9. The title "Enoch, the seventh from Adam" is also sourced from 1En.60:1. Most commentators assume that this indicates that Jude accepts the [[antediluvian]] patriarch [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] as the author of the [[Book of Enoch]] which contains the same quotation. However an alternative explanation is that Jude quotes the Book of Enoch aware that verses 14–15 are in fact an expansion of the words of Moses from Deuteronomy 33:2.<ref>Charles R. ''Enoch'' OUP, p. 119</ref><ref>Nickelsburg G. ''1 Enoch'' Fortress</ref><ref>Cox S. [http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/p_sinned.htm ''Slandering celestial beings'']</ref> This is supported by Jude's unusual Greek statement that "Enoch the Seventh from Adam prophesied to the false teachers, not "concerning" them.<ref>AUTOI dative</ref>

The [[Book of Enoch]] is not considered canonical by most churches, although it is by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] church.  According to Western scholars the older sections of the Book of Enoch (mainly in the ''Book of the Watchers'') date from about 300 BC and the latest part (''Book of Parables'') probably was composed at the end of 1st century BC.<ref>Fahlbusch E., Bromiley G.W. ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity: P-Sh'' pag 411, ISBN 0-8028-2416-1 (2004)</ref> It is generally accepted by scholars that the author of the Epistle of Jude was familiar with the Book of Enoch and was influenced by it in thought and diction.<ref>"Apocalyptic Literature" (column 220), ''[[Encyclopedia Biblica]]''</ref> Jude 1:14–15 quotes 1Enoch 1:9 which is part of the [[pseudepigrapha]] and is among the Dead Sea Scrolls [4Q Enoch (4Q204[4QENAR]) COL I 16–18].<ref>Clontz, T.E. and J., "The Comprehensive New Testament with complete textual variant mapping and references for the Dead Sea Scrolls, Philo, Josephus, Nag Hammadi Library, Pseudepigrapha, Apocrypha, Plato, Egyptian Book of the Dead, Talmud, Old Testament, Patristic Writings, Dhammapada, Tacitus, Epic of Gilgamesh", Cornerstone Publications, 2008, p.711, ISBN 978-0-9778737-1-5</ref>
