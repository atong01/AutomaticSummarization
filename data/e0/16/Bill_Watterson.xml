Dear Reader:<br/>
<br/>
I will be stopping ''Calvin and Hobbes'' at the end of the year. This was not a recent or an easy decision, and I leave with some sadness. My interests have shifted, however, and I believe I've done what I can do within the constraints of daily deadlines and small panels. I am eager to work at a more thoughtful pace, with fewer artistic compromises. I have not yet decided on future projects, but my relationship with Universal Press Syndicate will continue.<br/>
<br/>
That so many newspapers would carry ''Calvin and Hobbes'' is an honor I'll long be proud of, and I've greatly appreciated your support and indulgence over the last decade. Drawing this comic strip has been a privilege and a pleasure, and I thank you for giving me the opportunity.<br/>
<br/>

Watterson again confirmed that he would not be revisiting<space/><italics>Calvin and Hobbes</italics>, and that he was satisfied with his decision. Watterson also gave his opinion on the changes in the comic book industry and where it would be headed in future:</paragraph><paragraph><template><target>bquote</target><arg name="Personally, I like paper and ink better than glowing pixels, but to each his own. Obviously the role of comics is changing very fast. On the one hand, I donâ€™t think comics have ever been more widely accepted or taken as seriously as they are now. On the other hand, the mass media is disintegrating, and audiences are atomizing. I suspect comics will have less widespread cultural impact and make a lot less money. Iâ€™m old enough to find all this unsettling, but the world moves on. All the new media will inevitably change the look, function, and maybe even the purpose of comics, but comics are vibrant and versatile, so I think theyâ€™ll continue to find relevance one way or another. But they definitely wonâ€™t be the same as what I grew up with.<ref>{{cite web |url">http://mentalfloss.com/article/53216/mental-floss-exclusive-our-interview-bill-watterson |title</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>On February 26, 2014, Watterson published his first cartoon since the end of<space/><italics>Calvin and Hobbes</italics>: a poster for the documentary<space/><italics><link><target>Stripped (film)</target><part>Stripped</part></link></italics>.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="last">Gardner<space/></arg><arg name="first">Alan<space/></arg><arg name="url">http://dailycartoonist.com/index.php/2014/02/26/bill-watterson-provides-poster-art-for-stripped-documentary/<space/></arg><arg name="title">Bill Watterson provides poster art for Stripped documentary The Daily Cartoonist<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Dailycartoonist.com<space/></arg><arg name="date">2014-02-26<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2014-06-12</arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="last">Cohen</arg><arg name="first">Nicole</arg><arg name="title">'Calvin & Hobbes' Creator Pens His First Public Comic In 18 Years</arg><arg name="url">http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/02/27/283437272/calvin-hobbes-creator-pens-his-first-public-comic-in-18-years?utm_medium</arg><arg name="work">NPR</arg><arg name="accessdate">27 February 2014</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>In June 2014, three strips of<space/><italics><link><target>Pearls Before Swine (comics)</target><part>Pearls Before Swine</part></link></italics><space/>(published June 4, June 5, and June 6, 2014) featured guest illustrations by Watterson after cartoonist<space/><link><target>Stephan Pastis</target></link><space/>communicated with him via e-mail.

The typical layout consists of three rows with eight total squares, which takes up half a page if published with its normal size. Since some newspapers are restricted with space for their Sunday features, they often reduce the size of the strip. One of the more common ways is to cut the top two panels out, which Watterson believed forced him to waste the space on throwaway jokes that did not always fit the strip. While he was set to return from his first sabbatical, Watterson discussed with his syndicate a new format for<space/><italics>Calvin and Hobbes</italics><space/>that would enable him to use his space more efficiently and would almost require the papers his strip ran in to publish it as a half-page. Universal agreed that they would sell the strip as the half-page and nothing else, which garnered anger from papers and criticism for Watterson from both editors and some of his fellow cartoonists (whom he described as &quot;unnecessarily hot tempered&quot;). Eventually, Universal compromised and agreed to offer papers a choice between the full half-page or a reduced-sized version as to alleviate concerns about the size issue. Although Watterson conceded that this caused him to lose space in many papers, he said that in the end it was a benefit because he felt that he was giving the papers' readers a better strip for their money and editors were free not to run<space/><italics>Calvin and Hobbes</italics><space/>at their own risk; he added that he was not going to apologize for drawing a popular feature.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Cite book</target><arg name="last"><space/>Watterson</arg><arg name="first"><space/>Bill</arg><arg name="title"><space/>Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book</arg><arg name="publisher"><space/>Andrews and McMeel</arg><arg name="year"><space/>1995</arg><arg name="page"><space/>14</arg><arg name="isbn"><space/>0-8362-0438-7</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Awards and honors</heading><paragraph>Watterson was awarded the<space/><link><target>National Cartoonists Society</target></link>'s Reuben Award in both 1986 and 1988.<extension extension_name='ref' name="reub"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url"><space/>http://www.reuben.org/reuben.html<space/></arg><arg name="title">Reuben Award Winners 1946â€“Present
