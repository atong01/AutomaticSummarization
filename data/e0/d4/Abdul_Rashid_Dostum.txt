He was previously part of the leadership council of the [[National Front of Afghanistan]] along with [[Ahmad Zia Massoud]] and [[Mohammad Mohaqiq]], as well as chairman of his own political party, [[Junbish-e Milli-yi Islami-yi Afghanistan]] (National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan).

During the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]], Dostum was a general in the [[Afghan National Army|Afghan army]]. He later became an independent [[warlord]] and leader of [[Ethnic groups in Afghanistan#Uzbek|Afghanistan's Uzbek community]]. He participated in battles against the [[Mujahideen]] fighters in the 1980s as well as against the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|Taliban]] in the 1990s.

== Early life ==
{{expand section|date=October 2014}}
Dostum was born in 1954 in [[Khwaja du koh]], [[Jowzjan Province]], Afghanistan. Coming from an impoverished family, he received a very basic traditional education as he was forced to drop out of school at a young age. From there, he took up work in the [[Natural gas field|gas field]]s.

== Careers ==
Dostum began working in 1970 in a state-owned gas refinery in [[Sheberghan]], participating in [[Trade union|union]] [[politics]], as the new government started to arm the staff of the workers in the oil and gas [[refineries]]. The reason for this was to create "groups for the defense of the [[Saur Revolution|revolution]]". Because of the new [[communist]] ideas entering Afghanistan in the 1970s, he enlisted in the army in 1978. Dostum received his basic military training in [[Jalalabad]]. His [[Squadron (army)|squadron]] was deployed in the rural areas around Sheberghan, under the auspices of the Ministry of National Security.<ref name="globalsecurity">{{Cite web|author=|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/afghanistan/dostum.htm |title=Abdul Rashid Dostum |publisher=Global Security | language=| accessdate=18 March 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090301152731/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/afghanistan/dostum.htm| archivedate= 1 March 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

=== Soviet war in Afghanistan ===
{{Main|Soviet war in Afghanistan}}
By the mid-1980s his [[platoon (military unit)|platoon]] had grown in stature, reaching [[Company (military unit)|company]] status. He commanded around 20,000 militia men and was considered to be equivalent to a [[regiment|regimental commander]].<ref name="bbc">{{Cite news|author=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1563344.stm |title=Profile: General Rashid Dostum |publisher=BBC News | language=| accessdate=18 March 2009 | date=25 September 2001| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090408185925/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1563344.stm| archivedate= 8 April 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> While the unit recruited throughout Jowzjan and had a relatively broad base, many of its early troops and commanders came from Dostum's home village. He left the army after the purge of [[Parcham]]is, but returned after the [[Soviet Army|Soviet]] occupation began.<ref name="globalsecurity"/>

During the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]], Dostum was commanding a militia battalion to fight and rout [[mujahideen]] forces; he had been appointed an [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] due to prior military experience. This eventually became a regiment and later became incorporated into the defense forces as the [[53rd Division (Afghanistan)|53rd Infantry Division]]. Dostum and his new [[Division (military)|division]] reported directly to President [[Mohammad Najibullah]].<ref>Marshall, p. 3</ref> Later on he became the commander of the [[military unit]] 374 in [[Jowzjan]]. He defended the Soviet-backed Afghan government against the U.S., Pakistani, and Iranian-backed mujahideen forces throughout the 1980s. While he was only a regional commander, he had largely raised his forces by himself. The Jowzjani militia Dostum controlled was one of the few in the country which was able to be deployed outside its own region. They were deployed in [[Kandahar]] in 1988 when [[Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan|Soviet forces were withdrawing]] from Afghanistan.<ref name="afghanistan">{{Cite web|author=|url=http://www.islamicrepublicofafghanistan.com/abdul-rashid-dostum/ |title=Abdul Rashid Dostum |publisher=''Islamic Republic of Afghanistan'' | language=| accessdate=18 March 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090310122509/http://www.islamicrepublicofafghanistan.com/abdul-rashid-dostum/| archivedate= 10 March 2009 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

=== Civil war ===
{{Main|Civil war in Afghanistan (1992–1996)|Civil war in Afghanistan (1996–2001)}}
Dostum's men would become an important force in the [[Siege of Kabul|fall of Kabul]] in 1992. In April 1992, the opposition forces began their march to Kabul against the government of Najibullah. Dostum had allied himself with the opposition commanders [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] and [[Sayed Jafar Naderi]],<ref>Vogelsang (2002), p. 324.</ref> the head of the [[Isma'ili]] community, and together they captured the capital city. He and Massoud fought in a coalition against [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]].<ref name="afghanistan"/> Massoud and Dostum's forces joined together to defend Kabul against Hekmatyar, with some 4000-5000 of his troops, units of his Shiberghan-based 53rd Division and Balkh-based Guards Division, garrisoning [[Bala Hissar, Kabul|Bala Hissar]] fort, Maranjan Hill, and [[Kabul International Airport|Khwaja Rawash International Airport]].<ref>Anthony Davis, 'The Battlegrounds of Northern Afghanistan,' [[Jane's Intelligence Review]], July 1994, p.323-4</ref> In 1994, Dostum allied himself with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar against the government of [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]] and Ahmad Shah Massoud.<ref name="afghanistan"/>

=== Taliban and Northern Alliance era ===
Following the rise of the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|Taliban]] and their capture of Kabul, Dostum aligned himself with the [[Northern Alliance]] (United Front) against the Taliban. He stationed his troops in the city of [[Mazar-e-Sharif]].<ref name="afghanistan"/> The Northern Alliance was assembled in late 1996 by Dostum, Massoud and [[Karim Khalili]] against the Taliban. At this point he is said to have had a force of some 50,000 men supported by both aircraft and tanks. He ruled what was, in effect, an independent region. He printed his own Afghan currency and ran a small airline named [[Balkh Air]].<ref>Vogelsang (2002), p. 232.</ref>

Much like other northern alliance leaders, Dostum also faced infighting within his group and was later forced to surrender his power to General [[Abdul Malik Pahlawan]]. Malik entered into secret negotiations with the Taliban, who promised to respect his authority over much of northern Afghanistan, in exchange for [[Ismail Khan]], one of their enemies.<ref name="Johnson">{{Cite web|last=Johnson |first=Thomas H. |url=http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/si/2004/jul/johnsonJul04.asp |title=''Ismail Khan, Herat, and Iranian Influence''|publisher= Center for Contemporary Conflict | accessdate=20 March 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070329011958/http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/si/2004/jul/johnsonJul04.asp| archivedate= 29 March 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>De Ponfilly, Christophe(2001); ''Massoud l'Afghan''; Gallimard; ISBN 2-07-042468-5; p. 75</ref> Accordingly, on 25 May 1997 Malik arrested Khan and handed him over and let the Taliban enter Mazar-e-Sharif, giving them control over most of northern Afghanistan.

He then rejoined the Northern Alliance, and turned against his erstwhile allies, driving them from Mazar-e-Sharif. In October 1997, Dostum returned from exile and retook charge. After Dostum briefly regained control of Mazar-e-Sharif, the Taliban returned in 1998 and he again fled to Turkey.<ref name="afghanistan"/><ref>{{Cite web |last=UN Security Council report |first=

Dostum returned in 2001 to join the U.S.-led campaign against the Taliban. Along with General [[Mohammed Fahim|Fahim]], [[Ismail Khan]] and [[Mohammad Mohaqiq]].<ref name="bbc"/> In November 2001, with the beginning of the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, and against the wishes of the [[CIA]] who distrusted Dostum, a team including [[Johnny Micheal Spann]] landed to set up communications in the Dar-e-Suf. A few hours later 23 men of [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Operational Detachment Alpha (ODA) 595]] landed to begin the war.<ref name="nationalgeographic">{{Cite web|year=2007 |url = http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/0203/story.html#story_3|title = The Legend of Heavy D & the Boys:In the Field With an Afghan Warlord|publisher = [[National Geographic Society]]| accessdate = 22 April 2008 | author=Robert Young Pelton | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080406030343/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/0203/story.html| archivedate= 6 April 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name="ODA595">{{Cite web|year=2007 |url = http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/campaign/interviews/595.html|title = ODA 595|publisher = [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]| accessdate = 22 April 2008 | last= |quote=| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080429063752/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/campaign/interviews/595.html| archivedate= 29 April 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

On 24 November 2001, 300 Taliban soldiers retreated after the [[Siege of Kunduz]] by [[United States Army|American]] and Northern Alliance. The Taliban laid down their weapons a few miles from the city of Mazar-i-Sharif. They eventually surrendered to Dostum. A small group of armed foreign fighters were transferred to the 19th century [[Prison|prison fortress]], [[Qala-i-Jangi]]. The Taliban used concealed weapons to start the [[Battle of Qala-i-Jangi]] against the opposition forces. The uprising was eventually brought under control.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

In late 2001, the media began reporting that Dostum's forces, who were fighting the Taliban alongside the US Special Forces, intentionally suffocated as many as 2,000 Taliban prisoners in container trucks in an incident that has become known as the [[Dasht-i-Leili massacre]].<ref>{{Cite news | title = The Death Convoy Of Afghanistan | publisher = [[Newsweek]] | date = 25 August 2002 | url = http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2002/08/25/the-death-convoy-of-afghanistan.html | accessdate = 8 November 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | title = PHR Activities and Investigations Concerning the Mass Gravesite at Dasht-e-Leili Near Sheberghan, Afghanistan | publisher = [[Physicians for Human Rights]] | url = http://afghanistan.phrblog.org/get-the-facts/chronology/ | accessdate = 7 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/23/world/nation-challenged-siege-fierce-fighting-erupts-near-kunduz-despite-surrender.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=A Nation challenged: Siege; Fierce Fighting Erupts Near Kunduz, Despite Surrender Deal | first1=Dexter | last1=Filkins | first2=Carlotta | last2=Gall | date=23 November 2001 | accessdate=30 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/08/world/asia/08warlords.html | work=The New York Times | title=Afghan Leader Courts the Warlord Vote | date=8 August 2009 | accessdate=30 March 2010 | first=Richard A. | last=Oppel Jr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/05/world/a-nation-challenged-the-captives-prison-packed-with-taliban-raises-concern.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=A Nation challenged: The captives; Prison Packed With Taliban Raises Concern | first1=Carlotta | last1=Gall | first2=Mark | last2=Landler | date=5 January 2002 | accessdate=30 March 2010}}</ref><ref name=nytimes2009-07-18>{{Cite news

Other prisoners were killed when guards shot into the containers. The bodies were said to have been buried in a mass grave in Dasht-i-Leili, a stretch of desert just outside [[Sheberghan]]. A 2002 declassified U.S. State Department intelligence report states that another source, whose identity is redacted, concluded that about 1,500 Taliban prisoners died. Estimates from other witnesses or human rights groups range from several hundred to several thousand. The report also says that several Afghan witnesses were later tortured or killed." Dostum claimed only 200 were killed. There was satellite evidence that mass graves had been dug up and moved as well as eyewitness statements by survivors. Ultimately no formal investigation was conducted and an official website of General Dostum <ref name="generaldostum.com">http://generaldostum.com/2010/01/25/post-title-5/</ref> lays out a timeline of events attempting to refute these numbers. The foundation of the controversy lay in confusion in estimating the number of Taliban that possibly joined the Northern Alliance or simply returned to their villages after the Kunduz surrender.

=== Karzai administration ===
{{Further|Presidency of Hamid Karzai}}
In the aftermath of Taliban's removal from northern Afghanistan, forces loyal to Dostum frequently clashed with [[Tajik people|Tajik]] forces loyal to [[Atta Muhammad Nur]]. Atta's men kidnapped and killed a number of Dostum's men, and constantly agitated to gain control of Mazar-e-Sharif. Through the political mediations of the Karzai administration, the [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF) and the United Nations, the Dostum-Atta feud has gradually declined.

Dostum served as deputy defense minister the early period of the [[Presidency of Hamid Karzai|Karzai administration]]. In March 2003, he established a [[North Zone of Afghanistan]]. On 20 May 2003, Dostum narrowly escaped an assassination attempt.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} He was often residing outside Afghanistan, mainly in Turkey.

On 16 August 2009, Dostum made a requested return from exile to Afghanistan to support President Hamid Karzai in his bid for [[Afghan presidential election, 2009|re-election]]. He later flew by helicopter to his northern stronghold of Sheberghan, where he was greeted by thousands of his supporters in the local stadium.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article6799717.ece Times Online. "Afghan warlord General Dostum returns to boost Karzai’s campaign."]</ref> He subsequently made overtures to the United States, promising he could "destroy the Taliban and al Qaeda" if supported by the U.S., saying that "the U.S. needs strong friends like Dostum."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://washingtontimes.com/news/2009/sep/22/afghan-warlords-will-fight-if-us-gives-aid/?feat=home_headlines&|title=Afghan warlords will fight if U.S. gives weapons|last=Motlagh|first=Jason|author2=Carter, Sara A. |date=22 September 2009|work=[[Washington Times]]|accessdate=23 September 2009}}</ref>

=== Ghani administration ===
{{Further|Presidency of Ashraf Ghani}}

He became [[Vice President of Afghanistan]] in the [[Afghan presidential election, 2014|2014 Afghan presidential election]]. His running mates were [[Ashraf Ghani]] and [[Sarwar Danish]].

== Time in Turkey ==
Some media reports stated earlier that Dostum was "seeking political asylum" in Turkey <ref name=http://xrl.us/ozw7p>"Dostum seeking asylum in Turkey - media reports," Quqnoos.com, 6 December 2008, retrieved 6 December 2008</ref> while others said he was exiled.<ref name=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/244638,afghan-general-rashid-dostum-flies-to-exile-in-turkey.html>"Afghan general Rashid Dostum flies to exile in Turkey," Deutsche Presse-Agentur via earthtimes.org, 4 December 2008, retrieved 6 December 2008</ref> One Turkish media outlet said Dostum was visiting after flying there with then Turkey's Foreign Minister [[Ali Babacan]] during a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).<ref name=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=160690&bolum=102>"Afghan warlord in Turkey but not in exile, official says," Today's Zaman, 5 December 2008, retrieved 6 December 2008</ref>

== Political and social views ==
While Dostum was ruling northern Afghanistan before the Taliban took over in 1998, women were able to go about unveiled, girls were allowed to go to school and study at the [[University of Balkh]] in [[Mazar-e-Sharif]], cinemas showed Indian films and music played on television, activities which were all banned by the Taliban.<ref>Vogelsang (2002) p. 232.</ref>

He viewed the ISAF forces attempt to crush the Taliban as ineffective and has gone on record saying that he could mop up the Taliban "in six months"<ref name="canada.com"/> if allowed to raise a 10,000 strong army of Afghan veterans.<ref name="canada.com"/> Senior Afghan government officials do not trust Dostum as they are concerned that he might be secretly rearming his forces.<ref name="canada.com"/>
