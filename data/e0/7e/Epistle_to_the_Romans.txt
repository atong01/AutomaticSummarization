{{Books of the New Testament}}

The '''Epistle to the Romans''', often shortened to '''Romans''', is the sixth book in the [[New Testament]]. Biblical scholars agree that it was composed by the [[Apostle Paul]] to explain that [[salvation]] is offered through the [[Good News (Christianity)|gospel]] of [[Jesus Christ]]. It is the longest of the [[Pauline epistles]] and is considered his "most important theological legacy" and [[magnum opus]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Felix Just, S.J. |url=http://catholic-resources.org/Bible/NT-Statistics-Greek.htm |title=New Testament Statistics: Number of Chapters, Verses, and Words in the Greek NT |publisher=Catholic-resources.org |date=2 September 2005 |accessdate=18 September 2013}}</ref><ref>[http://www.tc.umn.edu/~parkx032/RM.html Bible.

== General presentation ==
In the opinion of [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] scholar [[Joseph Fitzmyer]], the book "overwhelms the reader by the density and sublimity of the topic with which it deals, the gospel of the justification and salvation of Jew and Greek alike by the grace of God through faith in Jesus Christ, revealing the uprightness and love of [[God the Father]]."<ref>Fitzmyer, xiii</ref>

[[N. T. Wright]] notes that Romans is

|...neither a systematic theology nor a summary of Paul's lifework, but it is by common consent his masterpiece. It dwarfs most of his other writings, an Alpine peak towering over hills and villages. Not all onlookers have viewed it in the same light or from the same angle, and their snapshots and paintings of it are sometimes remarkably unalike. Not all climbers have taken the same route up its sheer sides, and there is frequent disagreement on the best approach. What nobody doubts is that we are here dealing with a work of massive substance, presenting a formidable intellectual challenge while offering a breathtaking theological and spiritual vision.<ref>Leander E.

== Authorship ==
{{Main|Authorship of the Pauline epistles}}

The scholarly consensus is that Paul authored the Epistle to the Romans.

C. E. B. Cranfield, in the introduction to his commentary on Romans, says:

<blockquote>The denial of Paul's authorship of Romans by such critics... is now rightly relegated to a place among the curiosities of NT scholarship. Today no responsible criticism disputes its Pauline origin. The evidence of its use in the Apostolic Fathers is clear, and before the end of the second century it is listed and cited as Paul's. Every extant early list of NT books includes it among his letters. The external evidence of authenticity could indeed hardly be stronger; and it is altogether borne out by the internal evidence, linguistic, stylistic, literary, historical and theological.<ref>Cranfield, C. E. B. The Epistle to the Romans 1–8 (Vol. 1), International Critical Commentary Series. King's Lynn: T&T Clark Ltd, 2004, p. 1-2</ref></blockquote>

The letter was most probably written while Paul was in [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], and probably while he was staying in the house of [[Gaius (biblical figure)|Gaius]] and transcribed by [[Tertius of Iconium|Tertius]] his [[amanuensis]].<ref>Dunn, xliv; Stuhlmacher, 5; {{Bibleref2|Romans|16:22|31}}</ref> There are a number of reasons Corinth is most plausible. Paul was about to travel to [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] on writing the letter, which matches Acts{{Bibleref2c|Acts|20:3|KJV}} where it is reported that Paul stayed for three months in [[Early centers of Christianity#Greece|Greece]]. This probably implies Corinth as it was the location of Paul’s greatest missionary success in Greece.<ref name=Dunn>Dunn, xliv</ref> Additionally [[Phoebe (Christian woman)|Phoebe]] was a deacon of the church in [[Kechries|Cenchreae]], a port to the east of Corinth, and would have been able to convey the letter to [[Early centers of Christianity#Rome|Rome]] after passing through Corinth and taking a ship from Corinth’s west port.<ref name=Dunn/> Erastus, mentioned in {{Bibleref2|Romans|16:23|31}}, also lived in Corinth, being the city's commissioner for public works and city treasurer at various times, again indicating that the letter was written in Corinth.<ref>Bruce, 280–281; Dunn, xliv</ref>

The precise time at which it was written is not mentioned in the epistle, but it was obviously written when the collection for Jerusalem had been assembled and Paul was about to "go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints", that is, at the close of his second visit to Greece, during the winter preceding his last visit to that city.<ref>{{Bibleref2|Rom|15:25|KJV}}; cf. {{Bibleref2|Acts|19:21|KJV}}; {{Bibleref2|Acts|20:2–3|KJV}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|20:16|KJV}}; {{bibleref2|1Cor|16:1–4|KJV|1 Cor 16:1–4}}</ref> The majority of scholars writing on Romans propose the letter was written in late 55/early 56 or late 56/early 57.<ref>Bruce, 12; Dunn, xliii</ref> Early 58 and early 55 both have some support, while German New Testament scholar [[Gerd Lüdemann]] argues for a date as early as 51/52 (or 54/55) following on from Knox, who proposed 53/54. Lüdemann is the only serious challenge to the consensus of mid to late 50s.<ref>Dunn, xliii–xliv</ref>

== Paul's life in relation to his epistle ==
[[File:Paul arrested.jpg|thumb|right|Saint Paul arrested by the Romans]]{{Main|Redaction criticism}}

For ten years before writing the letter (approx. 47–57), Paul had traveled around the territories bordering the [[Aegean Sea]] evangelizing. Churches had been planted in the Roman provinces of [[Galatia]], [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaia]] and [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]]. Paul, considering his task complete, wanted to preach the gospel in [[Early centers of Christianity#Seville|Spain]], where he would not "build upon another man’s foundation".{{Bibleref2c|Rom|15:20|31}}<ref name="Bruce, 11-12">Bruce, 11–12</ref> This allowed him to visit Rome on the way, a long-time ambition of his. The letter to the Romans, in part, prepares them and gives reasons for his visit.<ref name="Bruce, 11-12"/>

In addition to Paul’s geographic location, his religious views are important. First, Paul was a [[Hellenistic Jew]] with a [[Pharisaic]] background (see [[Gamaliel]]), integral to his identity, see [[Paul the Apostle and Judaism]] for details. His concern for his people is one part of the dialogue and runs throughout the letter. Second, the other side of the dialogue is [[Road to Damascus|Paul’s conversion]] and calling to follow Christ in the early 30s.

== The churches in Rome ==
{{Main|Textual criticism}}
{{see also|Early centers of Christianity#Rome}}

The most probable ancient account of the beginning of Christianity in Rome is given by a 4th-century writer known as [[Ambrosiaster]]:<ref>TIB IX 1955 p. 367</ref>

{{quote|It is established that there were [[Roman Jews|Jews living in Rome]] in the [[Apostolic Age|times of the Apostles]], and that those Jews who had believed [in Christ] passed on to the Romans the tradition that they ought to profess Christ but keep the law [Torah] ... One ought not to condemn the Romans, but to praise their faith, because without seeing any signs or miracles and without seeing any of the apostles, they nevertheless accepted faith in Christ, although [[Judaizers|according to a Jewish rite]].<ref>Ambrosius, ''Works'', iii 373.</ref>}}

From Adam Clarke:
{{quote|The occasion of writing the epistle: ... Paul had made acquaintance with all circumstances of the Christians at Rome ... and finding that it was ... partly of heathens converted to Christianity, and partly of [[Jewish Christians|Jews]], who had, with many [[Judaizers|remaining prejudices]], believed in Jesus as the true Messiah, and that many contentions arose from the claims of the Gentiles to equal privileges with the Jews, and from absolute refusal of the Jews to admit these claims, unless the Gentile converts become [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcised]]; he wrote this epistle to adjust and settle these differences.<ref>A.C. 1831 VI p. 3</ref>}}

At this time, the [[Jew]]s made up a substantial number in Rome, and their [[synagogue]]s, frequented by many, enabled the [[Gentile]]s to become acquainted with the story of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]]. Consequently, churches composed of both Jews and Gentiles were formed at Rome. According to [[Irenaeus]], a 2nd-century [[Church Father]], the church at Rome was founded directly by the apostles [[St. Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]].<ref>Irenaeus, [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103303.htm ''Against Heresies'', Book III,3,2]</ref> However, many modern scholars disagree with Irenaeus, holding that while little is known of the circumstances of the church's founding, it was not founded by Paul:<ref>"The Expositor's Bible Commentary", (Ed. F.E.Gaebelein, Zondervan, 1976–92) Commentary on Romans (Introduction)</ref>

{{quote|1=Many of the brethren went out to meet Paul on his approach to Rome. There is evidence that Christians were then in Rome in considerable numbers and probably had more than one place of meeting.|2=Easton's Bible Dictionary<ref>{{cite EBD|wstitle=Romans, Epistle to the}}<br>{{Bibleref2|Acts|28:13–15|KJV}}</ref>}}

Note the large number of names in {{Bibleref2|Romans|16:3–15|KJV}} of those then in Rome, and verses 5, 15 and 16 indicate there was more than one church assembly or company of believers in Rome. Verse 5 mentions a church that met in the house of [[Aquila and Priscilla]]. Verses 14 and 15 each mention groupings of believers and saints.<ref>
[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/16.htm Geneva Study Bible] on Romans 16:5, regarding the "church" (translated as "company" or congregation in some 16th-century translations) says: (b) The company of the faithful, for in so great a city as that was, there were different companies.
* [http://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/romans/16.htm Vincent's Word Studies] (1886) on Romans 16:5 says: The phrase ''church that is in their'' (or his) ''house'' occurs 1 Corinthians 16:19, of Aquila and Priscilla; Colossians 4:15, of Nymphas; Plm 1:2, of Philemon. A similar gathering may be implied in Romans 16:14, Romans 16:15. Bishop Lightfoot says there is no clear example of a separate building set apart for christian worship within the limits of the Roman Empire before the third century.
* [http://biblehub.com/commentaries/pnt/romans/16.htm People's New Testament] (PNT 1891) on Romans 16:5 says: . As the early Christians had no houses of worship, they met in the homes of prominent brethren. In the large cities there would be several such groups. One of these in Rome met in the house of Priscilla and Aquila.
* and PNT on verse 16:15 says: ''And all the saints which are with them''. Probably another household church, which met with those just named.

Jews were expelled from Rome because of disturbances around AD 49 by the [[edict]] of [[Claudius]].<ref>{{Bibleref2|Acts|18:1–2|9|Acts 18:1–2}} "After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth; <sup>2</sup> And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them."

Marxsen, ''Introduction to the New Testament: An Approach to its problems'' (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1968) but is critiqued and modified by Fitzmyer. Fitzmyer's main contention is that Paul seems to be purposefully vague. Paul could have been more specific if he wanted to address this problem specifically.</ref> Keck thinks Gentile Christians may have developed a dislike of or looked down on Jews (see also [[Antisemitism]] and [[Responsibility for the death of Jesus]]), because they [[Supersessionism|theologically rationalized]] that Jews were no longer God's people.<ref>Leander E. Keck, ''The New Interpreter's Bible'', 407</ref>

== Style ==
{{Main|Form criticism}}

Scholars often have difficulty assessing whether Romans is a [[Letter (message)|letter]] or an [[epistle]]:

<blockquote>
A letter is something non-literary, a means of communication between persons who are separated from each other. Confidential and personal in nature, it is intended only for the person or persons to whom it is addressed, and not at all for the public or any kind of publicity...An Epistle is an artistic literary form, just like the dialogue, the oration, or the drama. It has nothing in common with the letter except its form: apart from that one might venture the paradox that the epistle is the opposite of a real letter. The contents of the epistle are intended for publicity—they aim at interesting "the public."<ref>[[A. Deissmann]], ''Light from the Ancient East, 2nd ed'' (London: Hodder & Stoughton, 1927), 218, 220</ref>
</blockquote>

Joseph Fitzmyer argues, from evidence put forth by Stirewalt, that the style of Romans is an "essay-letter."<ref>Fitzmyer, p. 69</ref> [[Philip Melanchthon]], a writer during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], suggested that Romans was ''caput et summa universae doctrinae christianae'' ("a summary of all Christian doctrine").<ref name="arpdmz">Fitzmyer, p. 74</ref> While some scholars attempt to suggest, like Melanchthon, that it is a type of theological treatise, this view largely ignores chapters 14 and 15 of Romans. There are also many "noteworthy elements" missing from Romans that are included in other areas of the Pauline corpus.<ref>Fitzmyer, p. 74, who notes that the Ekklesia, Eucharist and eschatology (especially the parousia) are not present in Romans</ref> The breakdown of Romans as a treatise began with [[F.C. Baur]] in 1836 when he suggested "this letter had to be interpreted according to the historical circumstances in which Paul wrote it."<ref name="arpdmz"/>

Paul sometimes uses a style of writing common in his time called a "diatribe". He appears to be responding to a "heckler" (probably an imaginary one based on Paul's encounters with real objections in his previous preaching), and the letter is structured as a series of arguments. In the flow of the letter, Paul shifts his arguments, sometimes addressing the Jewish members of the church, sometimes the Gentile membership and sometimes the church as a whole.

== Purposes of writing ==
The main purpose of the epistle to the Romans may given by Paul in {{Bibleref2|Romans|1:1|KJV}}, where he reveals that he is set apart by God for the purpose of preaching the Gospel, which he explains. He wishes to impart to the Roman readers a gift of encouragement and assurance in all that God has freely given them (see {{Bibleref2|Romans|1:11–12|KJV}}; {{Bibleref2|1Co|2:12|niv|1&nbsp;Corinthians 2:12}}).

The purposes of the apostle in dictating this letter to his [[Amanuensis]] Tertius{{Bibleref2c-nb|Romans|16:22}} are also articulated in the second half of {{Bibleref2|Rom|15||chapter 15}}:

# Paul asks for prayers for his forthcoming journey to Jerusalem; he hopes that the offering collected from the Gentile churches will be accepted there.
# Paul is planning to travel to [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] from Jerusalem and to spend some time there before moving on to Spain; he hopes the Roman church will support his mission to Spain.
# Since Paul has never been to [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], he outlines his gospel so that his teaching will not be confused by that of "false teachers".
# Paul is aware that there is some conflict between Gentile and [[Jewish Christians]] in the [[Early centers of Christianity#Rome|Roman church]], and he addressed those concerns (chapters thirteen and the first half of fourteen). While the Roman church was presumably founded by Jewish Christians, the exile of Jews from Rome in AD 49 by [[Claudius]] resulted in Gentile Christians taking leadership positions.

To review the current scholarly viewpoints on the purpose of Romans, along with a bibliography, see ''Dictionary of Paul and His Letters''.<ref>s.v. "Romans, Letter to the"</ref> For a 16th-century "Lollard" reformer view, see the work of
[[William Tyndale]]. In his prologue to his translation of the book of Romans, which was largely taken from the prologue of German Reformer [[Martin Luther]], Tyndale writes that:

<blockquote>
... this epistle is the principal and most excellent part of the new testament, and most pure evangelion, that is to say glad tidings and what we call the gospel, and also a light and a way in unto the whole scripture ... The sum and whole cause of the writings of this epistle, is, to prove that a man is justified by faith only: which proposition whoso denieth, to him is not only this epistle and all that Paul writeth, but also the whole scripture, so locked up that he shall never understand it to his soul's health. And to bring a man to the understanding and feeling that faith only justifieth, Paul proveth that the whole nature of man is so poisoned and so corrupt, yea and so dead concerning godly living or godly thinking, that it is impossible for her to keep the law in the sight of God.<ref>Tyndale's New Testament, edited by David Daniel (Yale University Press, London and New Haven, 1989), 223</ref>
</blockquote>

== Contents ==
[[File:Codex Alexandrinus 088a - Ro 1,1 ff.jpg|thumb|The beginning of the Epistle in [[Codex Alexandrinus]]]]This essay-letter composed by Paul was written to a specific audience at a specific time; to understand it, the situations of both Paul and the recipients must be understood.

=== Prologue (1:1–15) ===

====Greeting (1:1–7)====
The introduction{{Bibleref2c|Rom|1:1–16}} provides some general notes about Paul. He introduces [[Apostle (Christian)#The Apostle of the Gentiles: Paul the Apostle|his apostleship]] here and introductory notes about the gospel he wishes to preach to the church at Rome. Jesus' human line stems from [[David]].{{Bibleref2c-nb|Rom|1:3}} Paul, however, does not limit his ministry to Jews. Paul's goal is that the [[Gentiles]] would also hear the [[gospel]].{{Bibleref2c-nb|Ro|1:5}}

====Prayer of Thanksgiving (1:8–15)====
He commends the Romans for their [[faith]].{{Bibleref2c-nb|Rom|1:8}} Paul also speaks of the past obstacles that have blocked his coming to Rome earlier.{{Bibleref2c-nb|Ro|1:11–13}}

=== Salvation in Christ (1:16–8:39) ===

====Righteousness of God (1:16–17)====
Paul's announcement that he is not "ashamed" (''epaiscúnomai'') of his gospel because it holds power (''dúnamis''). These two verses form a backdrop for the rest of the book. First, we note that Paul is unashamed of his love for this gospel that he preaches about Jesus Christ. He also notes that he is speaking to the "Jew first."{{Bibleref2c-nb|Ro|1:16}} There is significance to this, but much of it is scholarly conjecture as the relationship of [[Paul the Apostle and Judaism]] is still debated. We are hard-pressed to find an answer to such a question without knowing more about the audience in question. Wayne Brindle argues, based on Paul's former writings against the [[Judaizers]] in [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] and [[2&nbsp;Corinthians]], that rumors had probably spread about Paul totally negating the Jewish existence in a Christian world, see also [[Antinomianism#Antinomianism in the New Testament|Antinomianism in the New Testament]] and [[Supersessionism]]. Paul may have used the "Jew first" approach to counter such a view.<ref>W.A. Brindle, "To The Jew First: Rhetoric, Strategy, History, or Theology?" ''Bibliotheca Sacra'' 159 (2002): 221</ref>

====Condemnation: The Universal corruption of Gentiles and Jews (1:18–3:20)====

===== The judgment of God (1:18–32) =====
Paul now begins into the main thrust of his letter. He begins by suggesting that humans have taken up ungodliness and wickedness for which there will be [[Divine retribution|wrath from God]].{{Bibleref2c-nb|Ro|1:18}} People have taken God's invisible image and made him into an [[Idolatry and Christianity|idol]]. Paul draws heavily here from the [[Wisdom of Solomon]].<ref>for all of these comparisons see Ben Witherington's commentary on Romans, p. 63 which is available on a limited preview basis from Google books.</ref> He condemns unnatural sexual behavior and warns that such behavior will result in a depraved body and mind{{Bibleref2c-nb|Ro|1:26–27}} and says that people who do such things (including murder and wickedness {{Bibleref2c-nb|Ro|1:29}}) are worthy of death.{{Bibleref2c-nb|Ro|1:32}} Paul stands firmly against the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|idol worship system which was common in Rome]].

===== Paul's warning of hypocrites (2:1–4) =====

On the traditional [[Protestant]] interpretation, Paul here calls out Jews who are condemning others for not following the law when they themselves are also not following the law. Stanley Stowers, however, has argued on rhetorical grounds that Paul is in these verses not addressing a Jew at all but rather an easily recognizable caricature of the typical boastful person (ὁ ἀλαζων). Stowers writes, "There is absolutely no justification for reading {{Bibleref2-nb|Ro|2:1–5}} as Paul's attack on 'the hypocrisy of the Jew.' No one in the [[Christianity in the 1st century|first century]] would have identified ''ho alazon'' with Judaism. That popular interpretation depends upon anachronistically reading later Christian characterizations of Jews as 'hypocritical [[Pharisees]]'".<ref>Stowers, ''A Rereading of Romans''. Yale Press, 1994, p.101</ref> See also [[Anti-Judaism]].

==== Justification: The Gift of Grace and Forgiveness through Faith (3:21–5:11) ====

Paul says that a righteousness from God has made itself known apart from the law, to which the [[Torah|law]] and [[Neviim|prophets]] testify, and this righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus to all who believe.{{Bibleref2c-nb|Ro|3:21–22}} He describes [[Justification (theology)|justification]] – legally clearing the believer of the guilt and penalty of sin – as a gift of God,{{Bibleref2c-nb|Ro|3:24}} and not the work of man (lest he might boast), but by faith.{{Bibleref2c-nb|Ro|3:28}}

==== Assurance of salvation (5–11) ====

In chapters five through eight, Paul argues that believers can be [[Assurance (theology)|assured]] of their [[hope]] in [[salvation]], having been freed from the bondage of sin. Paul teaches that through [[faith]],{{Bibleref2c-nb|Rom|3:28|KJV}} {{Bibleref2c-nb|Rom|4:3|KJV}} the faithful have been joined with [[Jesus of Nazareth|Jesus]]{{Bibleref2c-nb|Rom|5:1|KJV}} and freed from sin.{{Bibleref2c-nb|Rom|6:1–2|KJV}} {{Bibleref2c-nb|Rom|6:18|KJV}} Believers should celebrate in the assurance of salvation.{{Bibleref2c-nb|Rom|12:12|KJV}} This promise is open to everyone since everyone has sinned,{{Bibleref2c-nb|Rom|3:23|KJV}} save the one who paid for all of them.{{Bibleref2c-nb|Rom|3:24|KJV}}

In {{Bibleref2|Romans|9–11||chapters 9–11}} Paul addresses the faithfulness of [[God]] to the [[Israelites]], where he says that God has been faithful to His promise. Paul hopes that all Israelites will come to realize the truth{{Bibleref2c-nb|Rom|9:1–5|KJV}} since he himself was also an Israelite,{{Bibleref2c-nb|Rom|11:1|KJV}} and had in the past been a persecutor of [[Early Christians]]. In {{Bibleref2|Romans|9–11}} Paul talks about how the nation of Israel has been cast away, and the conditions under which Israel will be God's chosen nation again: when Israel returns to its faith, sets aside its unbelief.{{Bibleref2c-nb|Rom|11:19–24|KJV}}

In {{Bibleref2|Romans|7:1|KJV}}, Paul says that humans are under the law while we live: "Know ye not...that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?" However, Jesus' death on the cross makes believers dead to the law ({{Bibleref2-nb|Rom|7:4|KJV}}, "Wherefore, my brethren, ye are also become dead to the law by the [[body of Christ]]"), according to [[Antinomianism#Pauline passages supporting antinomianism|an antinomistic interpretation]].

===Transformation of believers (12–15:13)===
{{See also|Redemptive gifts}}
From chapter 12 through the first part of chapter 15, Paul outlines how the [[Gospel]] transforms believers and the behaviour that results from such a transformation. This transformation is described as a “renewing of your mind” (12:2),<ref>[http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Rom&c=12&t=NASB#s=t_conc_1058002 Blue Letter Bible – Romans 12]</ref> a transformation that [[Douglas J. Moo]] characterizes as “the heart of the matter.”<ref>Douglas J. Moo, ''The Epistle to the Romans (Eerdmans'', 1996), 748.</ref> It is a transformation so radical that it amounts to a “a transfiguration of your brain,” a "[[Metanoia (theology)|metanoia]]", a “mental revolution.”<ref>Edward J Anton, ''Repentance: A Cosmic Shift of Mind and Heart'' (Discipleship Publications, 2005) 30.</ref>

Paul goes on to describe how believers should live. Christians are no longer under the law, that is, no longer bound by the law of Moses,<ref>[[Douglas J. Moo]], ''Romans: The NIV Application Commentary: From Biblical Text to Contemporary Life'' (Zondervan, 2000), 399.</ref> but under the grace of God, see [[Law and grace]]. We do not need to live under the law because to the extent our minds have been renewed, we will know “almost instinctively” what God wants of us. The law then provides an “objective standard” for judging progress in the “lifelong process” of our mind’s renewal.<ref>Douglas J. Moo, ''The Epistle to the Romans'' (Eerdmans, 1996), 756–758.</ref>

To the extent they have been set free from [[sin]] by renewed minds (Romans 6:18),<ref>[http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Rom&c=6&t=NASB&ss=1#s=t_conc_1052018 Blue Letter Bible – Romans 6]</ref> believers are no longer bound to sin. Believers are free to live in obedience to God and love everybody. As Paul says in Romans 13:10, "love (ἀγάπη) worketh no ill to his neighbor: therefore love is the fulfilling of law".<ref>[http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Rom&c=13&t=KJV&ss=1#s=1059010 Blue Letter Bible – Romans 13]</ref>

The fragment in Romans 13:1–7 dealing with obedience to earthly powers is considered by some, for example James Kallas,<ref>[http://www.swordandploughshare.com/main-blog/2010/9/30/romans-131-7-an-interpolation.html The Sword and the Ploughshare ''Romans 13:1–7 an Interpolation?'']</ref> to be a gloss incorporated later.<ref>[http://hodos.org/romans/Paul%20and%20Empire%20-%20book%20report.htm Review of the book ''Paul and Empire – Religion and Power in Roman Imperial Society'' (Edited by Richard A. Horsley)]</ref> (See also the [[Great Commandment]] and [[Christianity and politics]]).

===Epilogue (15:1–16:23)===
* Admonition (15:1–7)
* Summary of the Epistle (15:8)

====Paul's ministry and travel plans (16:14–27)====

The concluding verses contain a description of his travel plans, personal greetings and salutations. One-third of the twenty-one Christians identified in the greetings are [[Paul the Apostle and women|women]], some of whom played an important role in the early church at Rome. Additionally, none of these Christians answer to the name [[Saint Peter|Peter]], although according to the [[History of the Catholic Church|Catholic storyline]], he had been ruling as [[Pope]] in Rome for about 25 years. Possibly related was the [[Incident at Antioch]] between Paul and Peter.

* Personal greetings (16:1–23 [24])
* Closing [[doxology]] (16:25–27)

== Hermeneutics ==
{{Main|Biblical hermeneutics}}

=== Catholic interpretation ===
{{Main|Sola gratia}}

Catholics accept the necessity of faith for salvation but point to {{Bibleref2|Romans|2:5–11|KJV}} for the necessity of living a [[Good works|virtuous life]] as well:<ref>For an authoritative discussion of the Catholic viewpoint, see ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', s.v. [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13156a.htm "Epistle to the Romans"]</ref>

<blockquote>
But by your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed. For he will render to every man according to his works: to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life; but for those who are factious and do not obey the truth, but obey wickedness, there will be wrath and fury. There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek, but glory and honor and peace for every one who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek. For God shows no partiality. 
</blockquote>

Throughout his writings, St. Augustine strongly affirms the Catholic understanding of this and other such Scriptural admonitions. In his sermons to his Catholic congregations, he is especially careful to warn them against an inordinate desire for a complete assurance of salvation. In his ''Exposition of Psalm 147'' for example, he states:<ref>''Works, Expositions of the Psalms (121–150)'', 2004, New City Press, ISBN 1-56548-210-7 ISBN 9781565482104, Part 3, volume, 20, p. 446.[http://books.google.com/books?id=pcwHg1EszuQC&pg=PA446&dq=%22ought+to+be+secure+only+when+they+have+dominated+this+world%E2%80%99s+lusts%22&cd=1#v=onepage&q=%22ought%20to%20be%20secure%20only%20when%20they%20have%20dominated%20this%20world%E2%80%99s%20lusts%22&f=false]</ref>

<blockquote>The gospel warned us, "Be on the watch for the last day, the day when the Son of Man will come," because it will spell disaster for those it finds secure as they are now – secure for the wrong reasons, I mean, secure in the pleasures of this world, when they ought to be secure only when they have ''dominated this world's lusts''. The apostle certainly prepares us for that future life in words of which I also reminded you on that occasion.</blockquote>

Again, in his ''Exposition of Psalm 85'', Augustine is perhaps even more specific:<ref>''Works, Expositions of the Psalms (73–98)'', 2002 John E. Rotelle, ed., ISBN 1-56548-167-4, ISBN 978-1-56548-167-1, part 3, vol. 18, p. 236. [http://books.google.com/books?id=W6UsLdKZsKgC&pg=PA236&dq=%22Let+us+not+expect+security+while+we+are+on+pilgrimage%22&hl=en&ei=4rMbTfOQCYGs8Aak3fS1Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Let%20us%20not%20expect%20security%20while%20we%20are%20on%20pilgrimage%22&f=false]</ref>

<blockquote>Let us not expect security while we are on pilgrimage. When we do find ourselves wanting it, what we are looking for is bodily sluggishness rather than personal security.</blockquote>

=== Protestant interpretation ===
{{Main|Sola fide}}

In the Protestant interpretation, the New Testament epistles (including Romans), describes salvation as coming from faith and not from righteous actions. For example, Romans {{Bibleref2-nb|Romans|4:2–5|9}} (underlining added):

: 2 For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath ''whereof''<!--italics in source--> to glory; but <u>not before God</u>. 3 For what saith the scripture? Abraham <u>believed</u> God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness. 4 Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. 5 But to him that <u>worketh not, but believeth</u> on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted unto him for righteousness.

They also point out that in Romans <span class=plainlinks>{{Bibleref2|Romans|2|9|chapter 2}}</span>, Paul says that God will reward those who follow the law and then goes on to say that ''no one'' follows the law perfectly (see also [[Sermon on the Mount#Interpretations|Sermon on the Mount: Interpretation]]) Romans {{Bibleref2-nb|Rom|2:21–25|9}}:

:21 Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal? 22 Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege? 23 Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God? 24 For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written. 25 For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.

[[Martin Luther]] described Paul's letter to the Romans as the "most important piece in the New Testament. It is purest Gospel. It is well worth a Christian's while not only to memorize it word for word but also to occupy himself with it daily, as though it were the daily bread of the soul".<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/l/luther/romans/pref_romans.html Martin Luther's Preface to the Letter of St. Paul to the Romans] cf. Luther's comments in his treatise on ''The Adoration of the Sacrament'' (1523) in which he refers to the [[Words of Institution|words of institution]] of the [[Eucharist]] as being "the sum and substance of the whole gospel". ''Luther's Works'', American Edition, St. Louis and Philadelphia: [[Concordia Publishing House]] and Fortress (Muhlenberg) Press, [https://archive.org/details/luthersworksvolu008249mbp vol. 36 (Word and Sacrament II (1959))] , [http://books.google.com/books?id=FQHx9n3qBu8C&pg=PA277&ots=g5iYjZ6Hny&dq=%22the+sum+and+substance+of+the+whole+gospel%22&sig=YFKDJjhyuXrRdII_T0jrpZoA2Oo], p.277.</ref>

Luther controversially added the word "alone" (''allein'' in German) to Romans {{Bibleref2-nb|Romans|3:28|9;10}}<!-- added Luther Bibel 1545 --> so that it read: "thus, we hold, then, that man is justified without doing the works of the law, ''alone'' through faith".<ref>The 1522 "Testament" reads at Romans 3:28: "So halten wyrs nu, das der mensch gerechtfertiget werde, on zu thun der werck des gesetzs, ''alleyn'' durch den glawben" (emphasis added to the German word for "alone"). [http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Lutherbibel/R%C3%B6mer_%281522%29#Das_Dritte_Capitel]</ref> The word "alone" does not appear in the original Greek [[Biblical manuscript|text]],<ref>The Greek text reads: λογιζόμεθα γάρ δικαιоῦσθαι πίστει ἄνθρωπον χωρὶς ἔργων νόμου ("for we reckon a man to be justified by faith without deeds of law")[http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~fisher/cgi-bin/gnt?id=0603]</ref> but Luther defended his translation by maintaining that the adverb "alone" was required both by idiomatic German and Paul's intended meaning. This is a ''"literalist view"'' rather than an [[Literal translation|literal view]] of the Bible.<ref>Martin Luther, ''On Translating: An Open Letter'' (1530), Luther's Works, 55 vols., (St. Louis and Philadelphia: Concordia Publishing House and Fortress Press), 35:187–189, 195; cf. also Heinz Bluhm, ''Martin Luther Creative Translator'', (St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1965), 125–137.</ref>

Apologist James Swan lists numerous Catholic sources that also translated Romans 3:28 with the word "alone," or testified to others doing so before Luther.<ref>{{cite web | last=Swan|first=James|title=Luther Added The Word "Alone" to Romans 3:28?|url= http://beggarsallreformation.blogspot.com/2006/02/luther-added-word-alone-to-romans-328.html |work=February 05, 2006|accessdate=29 March 2014}}</ref> A Bible commentary published in 1864 reports that:

{{quote|Catholic translators before the time of Luther had given the same translation. So in the Nuremberg Bible, 1483, "Nur durch den glauben." And the Italian Bibles of Geneva, 1476, and of Venice, 1538, ''per sola fede''. The Fathers also often use the expression, "man is justified by faith alone;" <ref>Hodge, Charles, ''Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans'' (New Edition), 1864, p100</ref>}}

The ''Romans Road'' refers to a set of scriptures from Romans that Christian evangelists use to present a clear and simple case for personal salvation to each person. They are: Romans {{bibleref2-nb|Romans|3:23|9}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Romans|3:10|9}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Romans|6:23|9}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Romans|5:8|9}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Romans|5:11|9}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Romans|10:13|9}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Romans|10:9|9}} and {{bibleref2-nb|Romans|10:17|9}}.<ref>[http://www.wels.net/evangelism/magazine/witnessing/roman-way The Roman Way], by [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]]</ref>

Romans has been at the forefront of several major movements in Protestantism. [[Martin Luther]]'s lectures on Romans in 1515–1516 probably coincided with the development of his criticism of [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] which led to the [[95 Theses]] of 1517. In 1738, while hearing Luther's Preface to the Epistle to the Romans read at [[St. Botolph]] Church on [[Aldersgate Street]] in London, [[John Wesley]] famously felt his heart "strangely warmed", a conversion experience which is often seen as the beginning of [[Methodism]]. In 1919 [[Karl Barth]]'s commentary on Romans, ''[[The Epistle to the Romans (Barth)|The Epistle to the Romans]]'', was the publication which is widely seen as the beginning of [[neo-orthodoxy]].
