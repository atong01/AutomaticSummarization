The '''''Benjamin Franklin''-class''' [[submarine]] was a group of [[Federal government of the United States|US]] [[ballistic missile submarine]]s that were in Navy service from the 1960s–2000s.  The class was an evolutionary development from the earlier {{sclass-|James Madison|submarine|4}} of fleet ballistic missile submarine.  Having quieter machinery and other improvements, they are considered a separate class. A subset of this class is the re-engineered 640 class starting with {{USS|George C. Marshall| SSBN-654}}.  The ''Benjamin Franklin'' class, together with the {{sclass-|George Washington|submarine|5}}, {{sclass-|Ethan Allen|submarine|5}}, {{sclass-|Lafayette|submarine|5}}, and {{sclass-|James Madison|submarine|5}} classes, comprise the "[[41 for Freedom]]" that were the Navy's main contribution to the [[nuclear deterrent]] force through the late 1980s. This class and the ''James Madison'' class are combined with the ''Lafayette''s in some references.

==Design==

The ''Benjamin Franklin''-class submarines were built with the [[Polaris missile|Polaris A-3]] [[ballistic missile]], and in the early 1970s were converted to carry the [[Poseidon missile|Poseidon C-3]] missile.  During the late 1970s and early 1980s, six boats were further modified to carry the [[Trident missile|Trident I (C-4)]] missile, along with six ''James Madison''-class boats. These were ''Benjamin Franklin'', ''Simon Bolivar'', ''George Bancroft'', ''Henry L. Stimson'', ''Francis Scott Key'', and ''Mariano G. Vallejo''.<ref name="Conways p612"/>

Due to the loss of {{USS|Thresher|SSN-593}} in April 1963, this class was designed to [[SUBSAFE]] standards and its equipment was similar to the [[Sturgeon-class submarine|''Sturgeon'' class]] fast [[attack submarine]]s (SSNs). Previous US SSBNs except the ''George Washington'' class had equipment similar to the [[Thresher-class submarine|''Thresher'' class]] SSNs.

This class can be distinguished by the fairwater planes' location halfway up the sail; the ''Lafayette''s and ''James Madison''s had the fairwater planes in the upper front portion of the sail.

Two submarines of this class were converted for delivery of up to 66 [[United States Navy SEALs|SEALs]] or other [[Special Operations Forces]] each. In the early 1990s, to make room for the {{sclass-|Ohio|submarine|0}} ballistic missile submarines within the limits set by the [[SALT II]] strategic arms limitation treaty, the ballistic missile tubes of {{USS|Kamehameha|SSBN-642}} and {{USS|James K. Polk|SSBN-645}} were disabled. Those boats were redesignated [[special operations]] [[attack submarine]]s and given attack submarine (SSN) [[hull classification symbols]]. They were equipped with [[dry deck shelter]]s to accommodate [[SEAL Delivery Vehicle]]s or other equipment.<ref name="Conways p612"/>

==Fate==
The ''Benjamin Franklin''s were decommissioned between 1992 and 2002 due to a combination of [[SALT II]] treaty limitations as the {{sclass-|Ohio|submarine|4}} SSBNs entered service, age, and the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]].<ref name="Conways p612"/> USS ''Kamehameha'' was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] on 2 April 2002, the last ship of the ''Benjamin Franklin'' class to be decommissioned.<ref>[http://www.navsource.org/archives/08/08642.htm ''Kamehameha'' at NavSource.org]</ref>

The sail of ''George Bancroft'' is preserved at the [[Naval Submarine Base King's Bay]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. ''James K. Polk''{{'}}s [[Sail (submarine)|sail]] is on display at the [[National Museum of Nuclear Science & History]]<ref>
