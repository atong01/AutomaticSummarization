==Early life and education==
Walcott was born and raised in [[Castries]], [[Saint Lucia]], in the [[West Indies]] with a twin brother, the future playwright [[Roderick Walcott]], and a sister, Pamela Walcott. His family is of African and European descent, reflecting the complex colonial history of the island which he explores in his poetry. His mother, a teacher, loved the arts and often recited poetry around the house.<ref Name="Paris Review">[http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2719/the-art-of-poetry-no-37-derek-walcott "Derek Walcott, The Art of Poetry No. 37"], ''The Paris Review'' Winter 1986</ref> His father, who painted and wrote poetry, died at age 31 from [[mastoiditis]] while his wife was pregnant with the twins Derek and Roderick, who were born after his death.<ref name="Paris Review" /> Walcott's family was part of a minority Methodist community, who felt overshadowed by the dominant Catholic culture of the island established during French colonial rule.

As a young man Walcott trained as a painter, mentored by [http://www.stluciafolk.org/folkPersonalities/view/18  Harold Simmons], whose life as a professional artist provided an inspiring example for him.  Walcott greatly admired [[Cézanne]] and [[Giorgione]] and sought to learn from them.<ref name="Paris Review" /> Walcott's painting was later exhibited at the [[Anita Shapolsky Gallery]] in New York City, along with the art of other writers, in a 2007 exhibition named "The Writer's Brush: Paintings and Drawing by Writers".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-writers-brush/|title=The Writer's Brush|date=16 December 2007|work=CBS News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anitashapolskygallery.com/past_exhibits_writers.html|title=The Writer's Brush; September 11th – October 27th, 2007 |work=Anita Shapolsky Gallery NYC}}</ref>

He studied as a writer, becoming “an elated, exuberant poet madly in love with English” and strongly influenced by modernist poets such as [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Ezra Pound]].<ref Name="Poetry Found">[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/derek-walcott "Derek Walcott"], Poetry Foundation.</ref> Walcott had an early sense of a vocation as a writer. In the poem "Midsummer" (1984), he wrote: 
<poem>
Forty years gone, in my island childhood, I felt that 
the gift of poetry had made me one of the chosen, 
that all experience was kindling to the fire of the Muse.<ref name="Paris Review" />
</poem>
At 14, Walcott published his first poem, a [[John Milton|Miltonic]], religious poem in the newspaper, ''The Voice of St Lucia.'' An English Catholic priest condemned the Methodist-inspired poem as blasphemous in a response printed in the newspaper.<ref name="Paris Review" /> By 19, Walcott had self-published his two first collections with the aid of his mother, who paid for the printing: ''25 Poems'' (1948) and ''Epitaph for the Young: XII Cantos'' (1949).  He sold copies to his friends and covered the costs.<ref Name="Academy">[http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/220 "Derek Walcott"], Academy of American poets</ref> He later commented, <blockquote>I went to my mother and said, 'I’d like to publish a book of poems, and I think it’s going to cost me two hundred dollars.' She was just a seamstress and a schoolteacher, and I remember her being very upset because she wanted to do it. Somehow she got it—a lot of money for a woman to have found on her salary. She gave it to me, and I sent off to [[Trinidad]] and had the book printed. When the books came back I would sell them to friends. I made the money back.<ref name="Paris Review" /></blockquote>The influential Bajan poet [[Frank Collymore]] critically supported Walcott's early work.<ref name="Paris Review" />

With a scholarship, he studied at the [[University College of the West Indies]] in [[Kingston, Jamaica]].<ref Name="British Council">{{cite web|url=http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=authC2D9C28A0a4dc1BE88LsX2F7F9A1|title=Derek Walcott – British Council Literature|author=British Council|work=contemporarywriters.com}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Derek Walcott married Fay Moston, a secretary, but the marriage lasted only a few years and ended in divorce. Walcott married a second time to Margaret Maillard, who worked as an almoner in a hospital, but that also ended in divorce. In 1976, Walcott then married to Norline Metivier, which just like the previous two, ended in a breakup.

Walcott is also known for his passion for traveling to different countries around the world. He splits his time between New York, Boston, and St. Lucias, where he incorporates the influences of different areas into his pieces of work.

==Career==
After graduation, Walcott moved to Trinidad in 1953, where he became a critic, teacher and journalist.<ref Name="British Council"/> Walcott founded the [[Trinidad Theatre Workshop]] in 1959 and remains active with its Board of Directors.<ref Name="Academy"/>

Exploring the Caribbean and its history in a colonialist and post-colonialist context, his collection ''In a Green Night: Poems 1948–1960'' (1962) attracted international attention.<ref Name="Poetry Found"/> His play ''[[Dream on Monkey Mountain]]'' (1970) was produced on NBC-TV in the United States the year it was published. In 1971 it was produced by the [[Negro Ensemble Company]] off-Broadway in New York City; it won an [[Obie Award]] that year for "Best Foreign Play".<ref>[http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0153558.html Obie Award Listing: ''Dream on Monkey Mountain''], InfoPlease</ref> The following year, Walcott won an [[OBE]] from the British government for his work.<ref name="Oxford University">[http://www.ox.ac.uk/about_the_university/university_year/encaenia/past_five_years/honorary06.html Oxford University]</ref>

He was hired as a teacher by [[Boston University]] in the United States, where he founded the [[Boston Playwrights' Theatre]] in 1981. That year he also received a [[MacArthur Foundation Fellowship]] in the United States.  Walcott taught literature and writing at Boston University for more than two decades, publishing new books of poetry and plays on a regular basis and retiring in 2007. He became friends with other poets, including the Russian [[Joseph Brodsky]], who lived and worked in the US after being exiled in the 1970s, and the Irish [[Seamus Heaney]], who also taught in Boston.

His epic poem, ''[[Omeros]]'' (1990), which loosely echoes and refers to characters from ''[[The Iliad]]'', has been critically praised "as Walcott's major achievement."<ref name="poetryfoundation.org"/> The book received praise from publications such as ''The Washington Post'' and ''The New York Times Book Review'', which chose the book as one of its "Best Books of 1990".

Walcott was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1992, the second Caribbean writer to receive the honor after [[Saint-John Perse]], who was born in [[Guadeloupe]], received the award in 1960. The Nobel committee described Walcott's work as “a poetic oeuvre of great luminosity, sustained by a historical vision, the outcome of a multicultural commitment.”<ref Name="Poetry Found"/> He won an [[Anisfield-Wolf Book Award]]<ref name="anisfield-wolf.org"/> for Lifetime Achievement in 2004.

His later poetry collections include ''Tiepolo’s Hound'' (2000), illustrated with copies of his watercolors;<ref>[http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/5936 "Derek Walcott's ''Tiepolo’s Hound''"], essay, Academy of American Poets</ref> ''The Prodigal'' (2004), and ''White Egrets'' (2010), which received the T.S. Eliot Prize.<ref Name="Poetry Found"/><ref Name="British Council"/>

In 2009, Walcott began a three-year distinguished scholar-in-residence position at the [[University of Alberta]].  In 2010, he became Professor of Poetry at the [[University of Essex]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.essex.ac.uk/news/event.aspx?e_id=1156|title=Nobel Laureate Derek Walcott is new Professor of Poetry|date=11 December 2009|accessdate=10 January 2010|publisher=''[[University of Essex]]''}}</ref>

===Oxford Professor of Poetry candidacy===
In 2009, Walcott was a leading candidate for the position of [[Oxford Professor of Poetry]]. He withdrew his candidacy after reports of documented accusations against him of sexual harassment from 1981 and 1996.<ref>{{cite book

===Themes===
[[Methodism]] and spirituality have played a significant role from the beginning in Walcott's work. He commented, "I have never separated the writing of poetry from prayer. I have grown up believing it is a [[vocation]], a religious vocation." Describing his writing process, he wrote, "the body feels it is melting into what it has seen… the 'I' not being important. That is the ecstasy...Ultimately, it’s what [[Yeats]] says: 'Such a sweetness flows into the breast that we laugh at everything and everything we look upon is blessed.' That’s always there. It’s a benediction, a transference. It’s gratitude, really. The more of that a poet keeps, the more genuine his nature."<ref name="Paris Review" /> He also notes, "if one thinks a poem is coming on...you do make a retreat, a withdrawal into some kind of silence that cuts out everything around you. What you’re taking on is really not a renewal of your identity but actually a renewal of your anonymity."<ref name="Paris Review" />

===Influences===
Walcott has said his writing was influenced by the work of the American poets, [[Robert Lowell]] and [[Elizabeth Bishop]], who were also friends.<ref name="Paris Review" />

===Playwriting===
He has published more than twenty plays, the majority of which have been produced by the [[Trinidad Theatre Workshop]] and have also been widely staged elsewhere. Many of them address, either directly or indirectly, the liminal status of the West Indies in the post-colonial period. Through poetry he also explores the paradoxes and complexities of this legacy.

===Essays===
In his 1970 essay "What the Twilight Says: An Overture", discussing art and theatre in his native region (from ''Dream on Monkey Mountain and Other Plays''), Walcott reflects on the West Indies as colonized space.  He discusses the problems for an artist of a region with little in the way of truly [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] forms, and with little national or nationalist identity. He states: “We are all strangers here... Our bodies think in one language and move in another". The epistemological effects of colonization inform plays such as ''Ti-Jean and his Brothers''. Mi-Jean, one of the eponymous brothers, is shown to have much information, but to truly know nothing. Every line Mi-Jean recites is rote knowledge gained from the coloniser; he is unable to synthesize it or apply it to his life as a colonised person.

Walcott notes of growing up in West Indian culture:<blockquote>"What we were deprived of was also our privilege. There was a great joy in making a world that so far, up to then, had been undefined... My generation of West Indian writers has felt such a powerful elation at having the privilege of writing about places and people for the first time and, simultaneously, having behind them the tradition of knowing how well it can be done—by a [[Daniel Defoe|Defoe]], a [[Dickens]], a [[Henry Handel Richardson|Richardson]]."<ref name="Paris Review" /></blockquote>Walcott identifies as "absolutely a Caribbean writer", a pioneer, helping to make sense of the legacy of deep colonial damage.<ref name="Paris Review" /> In such poems as "The Castaway" (1965) and in the play ''[[Pantomime (Walcott play)|Pantomime]]'' (1978), he uses the metaphors of shipwreck and [[Robinson Crusoe|Crusoe]] to describe the culture and what is required of artists after colonialism and slavery: both the freedom and the challenge to begin again, salvage the best of other cultures and make something new. These images recur in later work as well. He writes, "If we continue to sulk and say, Look at what the slave-owner did, and so forth, we will never mature. While we sit moping or writing morose poems and novels that glorify a non-existent past, then time passes us by."<ref name="Paris Review" />

===''Omeros''===
Walcott's epic book-length poem ''[[Omeros]]'' was published in 1990 to critical acclaim. The poem very loosely echoes and references [[Homer]] and some of his major characters from ''[[The Iliad]]''. Some of the poem's major characters include the island fishermen Achille and Hector, the retired English officer Major Plunkett and his wife Maud, the housemaid Helen, the blind man Seven Seas (who symbolically represents Homer), and the author himself.

Although the main narrative of the poem takes place on the island of St. Lucia, where Walcott was born and raised, Walcott also includes scenes from [[Brookline, Massachusetts]] (where Walcott was living and teaching at the time of the poem's composition), and the character Achille imagines a voyage from Africa onto a slave ship that is headed for the Americas; also, in Book Five of the poem, Walcott narrates some of his travel experiences in a variety of cities around the world, including [[Lisbon]], London, [[Dublin]], Rome, and Toronto.
 
Composed in a variation on ''[[terza rima]]'', the work explores the themes that run throughout Walcott's oeuvre: the beauty of the islands, the colonial burden, the fragmentation of Caribbean identity, and the role of the poet in a post-colonial world.<ref name="Bixby">Patrick Bixby, [http://www.english.emory.edu/Bahri/Walcott.html "Derek Walcott"], essay: Spring 2000, Emory University, accessed 30 March 2012.</ref>

===Criticism and praise===
Walcott's work has received praise from major poets including [[Robert Graves]], who wrote that Walcott "handles English with a closer understanding of its inner magic than most, if not any, of his contemporaries",<ref>Robert D. Hamner, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CkNTOawGMjwC&pg=PA1&lpg=PA1&dq=&source=bl&ots=t6XBMMi0rR&sig=b1kkPUT2Dxvp3yj5E75Xm8qmjFg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=6ZpJVLeLF8P3apG4gOAH&ved=0CDoQ6AEwBA#v=snippet&q=handles%20English&f=false "Introduction", ''Critical Perspectives on Derek Walcott''] (Three Continents, 1993), Lynne Rienner, 1997, p. 1.</ref> and [[Joseph Brodsky]], who praised Walcott's work, writing: "For almost forty years his throbbing and relentless lines kept arriving in the English language like tidal waves, coagulating into an archipelago of poems without which the map of modern literature would effectively match wallpaper. He gives us more than himself or 'a world'; he gives us a sense of infinity embodied in the language."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/220|title=Derek Walcott|work=poets.org}}</ref> Walcott noted that he, Brodsky, and the Irish poet [[Seamus Heaney]], who all taught in the United States, were a band of poets "outside the American experience".

The poetry critic William Logan critiqued Walcott's work in a ''New York Times'' book review of Walcott's ''Selected Poems''. While he praised Walcott's writing in ''Sea Grapes'' and ''The Arkansas Testament'', he had mostly negative things to say about Walcott's poetry, calling ''Omeros'' "clumsy" and ''Another Life'' "pretentious.".<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/08/books/review/Logan.t.html? Logan, William. The Poet of Exile. New York Times. April 8, 2007]</ref> Finally, he concluded with the faint praise that "No living poet has written verse more delicately rendered or distinguished than Walcott, though few individual poems seem destined to be remembered."

Most reviews of Walcott's work are more positive. For instance, in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' review of ''The Poetry of Derek Walcott'', Adam Kirsch had high praise for Walcott's oeuvre, describing his style in the following manner:<blockquote>By combining the grammar of vision with the freedom of metaphor, Walcott produces a beautiful style that is also a philosophical style. People perceive the world on dual channels, Walcott’s verse suggests, through the senses and through the mind, and each is constantly seeping into the other. The result is a state of perpetual magical thinking, a kind of ''Alice in Wonderland'' world where concepts have bodies and landscapes are always liable to get up and start talking.<ref>[http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/02/03/full-fathom-five-2 Kirsch, Adam. "Full Fathom Five." The New Yorker. 3 February 2014]</ref></blockquote> He calls ''Another Life'' Walcott's "first major peak" and analyzes the painterly qualities of Walcott's imagery from his earliest work through to later books like ''Tiepolo's Hound''. He also explores the post-colonial politics in Walcott's work, calling him "the postcolonial writer par excellence." He calls the early poem "A Far Cry from Africa" a turning point in Walcott's development as a poet. Like Logan, Kirsch is critical of ''Omeros'' which he believes Walcott fails to successfully sustain over its entirety. Although ''Omeros'' is the volume of Walcott's that usual receives the most critical praise, Kirsch, instead believes that ''Midsummer'' is his best book.
