In [[mathematics]], the '''Borsuk–Ulam theorem''' (BUT), states that every [[continuous function]] from an [[n-sphere|''n''-sphere]] into [[Euclidean space|Euclidean ''n''-space]] maps some pair of [[antipodal point]]s to the same point. Here, two points on a sphere are called antipodal if they are in exactly opposite directions from the sphere's center.

Formally: if <math>f: S^n \to R^n</math> is continuous then there exists an <math>x\in S^n</math> such that:  <math>f(-x)=f(x)</math>.

The case <math>n=1</math> can be illustrated by saying that there always exist a pair of opposite points on the earth's equator with the same temperature. The same is true for any circle. This assumes the temperature varies continuously.

The case <math>n=2</math> is often illustrated by saying that at any moment, there is always a pair of antipodal points on the [[Earth]]'s surface with equal temperatures and equal barometric pressures.

BUT has several equivalent statements in terms of [[odd function]]s. Recall that   <math>S^n</math> is the [[n-sphere|''n''-sphere]] and <math>B^n</math> is the [[n-ball|''n''-ball]]:
* If <math>g: S^n \to R^n</math> is a continuous odd function, then there exists an <math>x\in S^n</math> such that:  <math>g(x)=0</math>.
* If <math>g: B^n \to R^n</math> is a continuous function which is odd on <math>S^{n-1}</math> (the boundary of <math>B^n</math>), then there exists an <math>x\in B^n</math> such that:  <math>g(x)=0</math>.

==History==

According to {{harvtxt|Matoušek|2003|p=25}}, the first historical mention of the statement of BUT appears in {{harvtxt|Lyusternik|Shnirel'man|1930}}.  The first proof was given by {{harvs|first=Karol|last=Borsuk|authorlink=Karol Borsuk|year=1933|txt}}, where the formulation of the problem was attributed to [[Stanislaw Ulam]].  Since then, many alternative proofs have been found by various authors, as collected by {{harvtxt|Steinlein|1985}}.

==Equivalent statements==
The following statements are equivalent to BUT.<ref name=prescott2002>{{cite web | url=http://www.und.edu/instruct/tprescott/papers/thesis/thesis.pdf | title=Extensions of the Borsuk-Ulam Theorem (Thesis) | publisher=Harvey Mudd College | date=2002 | accessdate=25 May 2015 | author=Prescott, Timothy}}</ref>

=== With odd functions ===
A function <math>g</math> is called ''odd'' (aka ''antipodal'' or ''antipode-preserving'') if for every <math>x</math>: <math>g(-x)=-g(x)</math>.

BUT is equivalent to the following statement: A continuous odd function from an ''n''-sphere into Euclidean ''n''-space has a zero. PROOF: 
* If BUT is correct, then it is specifically correct for odd functions, and for an odd function, <math>g(-x)=g(x)</math> iff <math>g(x)=0</math>. Hence every odd continuous function has a zero.
* For every continuous function <math>f</math>, the following function is continuous and odd: <math>g(x)=f(x)-f(-x)</math>. If every odd continuous function has a zero, then <math>g</math> has a zero, and there, <math>f(x)=f(-x)</math>. Hence BUT is correct.

=== With retractions ===
Define a ''retraction'' as a function <math>h: S^n \to S^{n-1}</math>.

BUT is equivalent to the following claim: there is no continuous odd retraction.

PROOF: If BUT is correct, then every continuous odd function from <math>S^n</math> must include 0 in its range. However,  <math>0 \notin S^{n-1}</math> so there cannot be a continuous odd function whose range is <math>S^{n-1}</math>.

Conversely, if BUT is incorrect, then there is a continuous odd function <math>g: S^n \to R^n</math> with no zeroes. Then we can construct another odd function <math>h: S^n \to S^{n-1}</math> by:

:<math>h(x)=\frac{g(x)}{|g(x)|}</math>

since <math>g</math> has no zeroes, <math>h</math> is well-defined and continuous. Thus we have a continuous odd retraction.

== Proofs ==
===1-dimensional case===
The 1-dimensional case can easily be proved using the [[intermediate value theorem]] (IVT). 

Let <math>g</math> be an odd real-valued function on a circle. Pick an arbitrary <math>x</math>. If <math>g(x)=0</math> then we are done. Otherwise, w.l.o.g. <math>g(x)>0</math>. But <math>g(-x)<0</math>. Hence, by the IVT there is a point <math>y</math> between <math>x</math> and <math>-x</math> on which <math>g(y)=0</math>.

===General case - algebraic topology proof===
BUT can be proved by the stronger statement that every odd function <math>h^*: S^{n-1} \to S^{n-1}</math> has odd [[degree of a mapping|degree]].{{why|date=May 2015}}

Assume by contradiction that there exists a continuous odd retraction <math>h: S^n \to S^{n-1}</math>.

Let <math>h^*: S^{n-1} \to S^{n-1}</math> be the restriction of <math>h</math> to the equator. <math>h^*</math> is also odd and thus has non-zero degree. 

By construction, <math>h^*</math> extends to the whole upper hemisphere of <math>S^n</math>{{why|date=May 2015}}, and as such is null-homotopic {{what|date=May 2015}}. A null-homotopic map has degree zero, contradicting our only assumption, namely that <math>h</math> exists.

===General case - combinatorial proof===
BUT can be proved from [[Tucker's lemma]].
<ref name=FreundTodd1982>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/0097-3165(81)90027-3}}</ref>
<ref name=prescott2002/><ref name=SimmonsSu2003>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/s0165-4896(02)00087-2}}</ref>

Let <math>g: S^n \to R^n</math> be a continuous odd function. Because ''g'' is continuous on a compact domain, it is [[uniformly continuous]]. Therefore, for every <math>\epsilon > 0</math>, there is a <math>\delta > 0</math> such that, for every two points of <math>S_n</math> which are within <math>\delta</math> of each other, their images under ''g'' are within <math>\epsilon</math> of each other.

Define a triangulation of <math>S_n</math> with edges of length at most <math>\delta</math>. Label each vertex <math>v</math> of the triangulation with a label <math>l(v)\in {\pm 1, \pm 2, ..., \pm n}</math> in the following way:
* The absolute value of the label is the ''index'' of the coordinate with the highest absolute value of ''g'': <math>|l(v)| = \arg\max_k (g(v)_k)</math>.
* The sign of the label is the sign of ''g'', so that: <math>l(v) = \sgn (g(v)) |l(v)|</math>.
Because ''g'' is odd, the labeling is also odd: <math>l(-v) = -l(v)</math>. Hence, by Tucker's lemma, there are two adjacent vertices <math>u, v</math> with opposite labels. Assume w.l.o.g. that the labels are <math>l(u)=1, l(v)=-1</math>. By definition of ''l'', this means that in both <math>g(u)</math> and <math>g(v)</math>, coordinate #1 is the largest coordinate; in <math>g(u)</math> this coordinate is positive while in <math>g(v)</math> it is negative. By the construction of the triangulation, the distance between <math>g(u)</math> and <math>g(v)</math> is at most <math>\epsilon</math>; this means that both <math>|g(u)|</math> and <math>|g(v)|</math> are bounded by <math>\epsilon</math>. 

The above is true for every <math>\epsilon</math>; hence there must be a point ''u'' in which <math>|g(u)|=0</math>.

== Corollaries==

* No subset of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> is [[homeomorphic]] to '''S'''<sup>''n''</sup>.
* The [[Ham sandwich theorem]]: For any [[Compact space|compact]] sets ''A''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''A<sub>n</sub>'' in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> we can always find a hyperplane dividing each of them into two subsets of equal measure.

== Equivalent results ==
Above we showed how to prove BUT from Tucker's lemma. The converse is also true: it is possible to prove Tucker's lemma from BUT. Therefore, these two theorems are equivalent.
{{Analogous fixed-point theorems}}

== Generalizations ==
1. In the original BUT, the domain of the function ''f'' is the unit ''n''-sphere (the boundary of the unit ''n''-ball). In general, it is true also when the domain of ''f'' is the boundary of any open bounded symmetric subset of ''R''<sup>''n''</sup> containing the origin (Here, symmetric means that if ''x'' is in the subset then -''x'' is also in the subset).<ref>{{springer|title=Borsuk fixed-point theorem|id=p/b110770}}</ref>

2. Consider the function ''A'' which maps a point to its antipodal point: ''A(x)=-x''. Note that ''A(A(x))=x''. The original BUT claims that there is a point ''x'' in which ''f(A(x))=f(x)''. In general, this is true also for every function ''A'' for which ''A(A(x))=x''.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/1969632}}</ref> However, in general this is not true for other functions ''A''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mathoverflow.net/questions/61141/generalization-of-borsuk-ulam | title=Generalization of Borsuk-Ulam | publisher=Math Overflow | accessdate=18 May 2015 | author=Jens Reinhold, Faisal, Sergei Ivanov}}</ref>
