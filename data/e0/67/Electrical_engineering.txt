'''Electrical engineering''' is a field of [[engineering]] that generally deals with the study and application of [[electricity]], [[electronics]], and [[electromagnetism]]. This field first became an identifiable occupation in the latter half of the 19th century after commercialization of the electric [[telegraph]], the [[telephone]], and [[electric power]] distribution and use. Subsequently, [[broadcasting]] and [[recording media]] made electronics part of daily life.  The invention of the [[transistor]], and later the [[integrated circuit]], brought down the cost of electronics to the point they can be used in almost any household object.

Electrical engineering has now subdivided into a wide range of subfields including [[electronics]], [[digital computers]], [[power engineering]], [[telecommunication]]s, [[control systems]], [[radio-frequency engineering]], [[signal processing]], [[instrumentation]], and [[microelectronics]].  The subject of [[electronic engineering]] is often treated as its own subfield but it intersects with all the other subfields, including the [[power electronics]] of power engineering.

Electrical engineers typically hold a [[academic degree|degree]] in electrical engineering or electronic engineering.  Practicing engineers may have [[professional certification]] and be members of a [[professional body]]. Such bodies include the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) and the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology (professional society)]] (IET).

Electrical engineers work in a very wide range of industries and the skills required are likewise variable. These range from basic circuit theory to the management skills required of a [[project manager]].  The tools and equipment that an individual engineer may need are similarly variable, ranging from a simple [[voltmeter]] to a top end analyzer to sophisticated design and manufacturing software.

==History==
{{Main|History of electrical engineering}}

[[Electricity]] has been a subject of scientific interest since at least the early 17th century. The first electrical engineer was probably [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] who designed the [[versorium]]: a device that detected the presence of statically charged objects. He was also the first to draw a clear distinction between magnetism and static electricity and is credited with establishing the term electricity.{{sfn|Martinsen|Grimnes|2011|p=411}} In 1775 [[Alessandro Volta]]'s scientific experimentations devised the [[electrophorus]], a device that produced a static electric charge, and by 1800 Volta developed the [[voltaic pile]], a forerunner of the electric battery.{{sfn|Walker|2007|p=23}}

===19th century===
[[File:Faraday Cochran Pickersgill.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The discoveries of [[Michael Faraday]] formed the foundation of electric motor technology]]
However, it was not until the 19th century that research into the subject started to intensify. Notable developments in this century include the work of [[Georg Ohm]], who in 1827 quantified the relationship between the [[electric current]] and [[potential difference]] in a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]], of [[Michael Faraday]], the discoverer of [[electromagnetic induction]] in 1831, and of [[James Clerk Maxwell]], who in 1873 published a unified [[Maxwell's equations|theory]] of electricity and [[magnetism]] in his treatise ''Electricity and Magnetism''.{{sfn|Lambourne|2010|p=11}}

Beginning in the 1830s, efforts were made to apply electricity to practical use in the [[telegraph]]. By the end of the 19th century, the world had been forever changed by the rapid communication made possible by the engineering development of land-lines, [[submarine communications cable|submarine cable]]s, and, from about 1890, [[wireless telegraphy]].

Practical applications and advances in such fields created an increasing need for standardized units of measure. They led to the international standardization of the units [[volt]], [[ampere]], [[coulomb]], [[ohm]], [[farad]], and [[henry (unit)|henry]]. This was achieved at an international conference in Chicago in 1893.{{Sfn|Rosenberg|2008|p=9}} The publication of these standards formed the basis of future advances in standardisation in various industries, and in many countries the definitions were immediately recognised in relevant legislation.{{sfn|Tunbridge|1992}}

During these years, the study of electricity was largely considered to be a subfield of [[physics]]. It was not until about 1885 that [[universities]] and [[institutes of technology]] such as [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) and [[Cornell University]] started to offer [[bachelor's degree]]s in electrical engineering. The [[Technische Universität Darmstadt]] founded the first department of electrical engineering in the world in 1882. In that same year, under Professor Charles Cross, MIT began offering the first option of electrical engineering within its [[physics]] department.{{Sfn|Wildes|Lindgren|1985|p=19}} In 1883, [[Technische Universität Darmstadt]] and Cornell University introduced the world's first bachelor's degree courses of study in electrical engineering, and in 1885 [[University College London]] founded the first chair of electrical engineering in [[Great Britain]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Electrical Engineer|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TLLmAAAAMAAJ|year=1911|page=54}}</ref> The [[University of Missouri]] established the first department of electrical engineering in the United States in 1886.{{sfn|Wildes|Lindgren|1985|p=23}} Several other schools soon followed suit, including Cornell and the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] in [[Atlanta]], Georgia.

During these decades use of electrical engineering increased dramatically. In 1882, [[Thomas Edison]] switched on the world's first large-scale electric power network that provided 110 volts — [[direct current]] (DC) — to 59 customers on [[Manhattan Island]] in [[New York City]]. In 1884, [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Sir Charles Parsons]] invented the [[steam turbine]] allowing for more efficient electric power generation. [[Alternating current]], with its ability to transmit power more efficiently over long distances via the use of [[transformer]]s,  developed rapidly in the 1880s and 1890s with transformer designs by [[Károly Zipernowsky]], [[Ottó Bláthy]] and [[Miksa Déri]] (later called ZBD transformers), [[Lucien Gaulard]], [[John Dixon Gibbs]] and [[William Stanley, Jr.]]. Practical [[AC motor]] designs including [[induction motor]]s were independently invented by [[Galileo Ferraris]] and [[Nikola Tesla]] and further developed into a practical [[three-phase]] form by [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]] and [[Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown]].{{Sfn|Heertje|Perlman|1990|p=138}} [[Charles Steinmetz]] and [[Oliver Heaviside]] contributed to the theoretical basis of alternating current engineering.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=f5FqsDPVQ2MC&pg=PA1229&dq=theoretical++alternating+current++Oliver+Heaviside&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bifsUOmuLKio0AHXtIGoBg&ved=0CFUQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=theoretical%20%20alternating%20current%20%20Oliver%20Heaviside&f=false I.

===More modern developments===
[[File:Guglielmo Marconi.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[Guglielmo Marconi]] known for his pioneering work on long distance radio transmission]]
During the [[invention of radio|development of radio]], many scientists and [[inventor]]s contributed to [[radio communications|radio technology]] and electronics. The mathematical work of [[James Clerk Maxwell]] during the 1850s had shown the relationship of different forms of [[electromagnetic radiation]] including possibility of invisible airborne waves (later called "radio waves"). In his classic physics experiments of 1888, [[Heinrich Hertz]] proved Maxwell's theory by transmitting [[radio wave]]s with a [[spark-gap transmitter]], and detected them by using simple electrical devices. Other physicists experimented with these new waves and in the process developed devices for transmitting and detecting them. In 1895 [[Guglielmo Marconi]] began work on a way to adapt the known methods of transmitting and detecting these "Hertzian waves" into a purpose built commercial [[Wireless telegraphy|wireless telegraphic]] system. Early on, he sent wireless signals over a distance of one and a half miles. In December 1901, he sent wireless waves that were not affected by the curvature of the Earth. Marconi later transmitted the wireless signals across the Atlantic between Poldhu, Cornwall, and St. John's, Newfoundland, a distance of {{convert|2100|mi|km}}.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1909/marconi-bio.html Marconi's biography at Nobelprize.org] retrieved 21 June 2008.</ref>

In 1897, [[Karl Ferdinand Braun]] introduced the [[cathode ray tube]] as part of an [[oscilloscope]], a crucial enabling technology for [[television|electronic television]].{{sfn|Abramson|1955|p=22}} [[John Ambrose Fleming|John Fleming]] invented the first radio tube, the [[diode]], in 1904. Two years later, [[Robert von Lieben]] and [[Lee De Forest]] independently developed the amplifier tube, called the [[triode]].{{Sfn|Huurdeman|2003|p=226}}

In 1920 [[Albert Hull]] developed the [[Cavity magnetron|magnetron]] which would eventually lead to the development of the [[microwave oven]] in 1946 by [[Percy Spencer]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Albert W.

In 1941 [[Konrad Zuse]] presented the [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]], the world's first fully functional and programmable computer using electromechanical parts.  In 1943 [[Tommy Flowers]] designed and built the [[Colossus (computer)|Colossus]], the world's first fully functional, electronic, digital and programmable computer.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Raúl |last=Rojas |contribution=The history of Konrad Zuse's early computing machines |page=237 |editor1-first=Raúl |editor1-last=Rojas |editor2-first=Ulf |editor2-last=Hashagen |title=The First Computers—History and Architectures History of Computing |publisher=MIT Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-262-68137-4}}<br/>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Anthony E. |last=Sale |contribution=The Colossus of Bletchley Park |pages=354–355 |editor1-first=Raúl |editor1-last=Rojas |editor2-first=Ulf |editor2-last=Hashagen |title=The First Computers—History and Architectures History of Computing |publisher=MIT Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-262-68137-4}}</ref> In 1946 the [[ENIAC]] (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) of [[John Presper Eckert]] and [[John Mauchly]] followed, beginning the computing era.

===Solid-state transistors===
The invention of the [[transistor]] in late 1947 by [[William B. Shockley]], [[John Bardeen]], and [[Walter Brattain]] of the [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] opened the door for more compact devices and led to the development of the [[integrated circuit]] in 1958 by [[Jack Kilby]] and independently in 1959 by [[Robert Noyce]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Electronics Timeline | work = Greatest Engineering Achievements of the Twentieth Century | url = http://www.greatachievements.org/?id=3956 | accessdate =18 January 2006 }}</ref> Starting in 1968, [[Marcian Hoff|Ted Hoff]] and a team at the [[Intel Corporation]] invented the first commercial [[microprocessor]], which foreshadowed the [[personal computer]]. The [[Intel 4004]] was a four-bit processor released in 1971, but in 1973 the [[Intel 8080]], an eight-bit processor, made the first personal computer, the [[Altair 8800]], possible.<ref>{{cite web | title = Computing History (1971–1975) | url = http://mbinfo.mbdesign.net/1971-75.htm | accessdate =18 January 2006 }}</ref>

==Subdisciplines==
Electrical engineering has many subdisciplines, the most common of which are listed below. Although there are electrical engineers who focus exclusively on one of these subdisciplines, many deal with a combination of them. Sometimes certain fields, such as electronic engineering and [[computer engineering]], are considered separate disciplines in their own right.

===Power===
{{Main|Power engineering}}
[[File:Power pole.jpg|thumb|right|[[Utility pole|Power pole]]]]
Power engineering deals with the [[electricity generation|generation]], [[electric power transmission|transmission]] and [[electric power distribution|distribution]] of [[electricity]] as well as the design of a range of related devices.{{Sfn|Grigsby|2012}} These include [[transformer]]s, [[electric generator]]s, [[electric motor]]s, high voltage engineering, and [[power electronics]]. In many regions of the world, governments maintain an electrical network called a [[power grid]] that connects a variety of generators together with users of their energy. Users purchase electrical energy from the grid, avoiding the costly exercise of having to generate their own. Power engineers may work on the design and maintenance of the power grid as well as the power systems that connect to it.<ref name="UNESCO"/> Such systems are called ''on-grid'' power systems and may supply the grid with additional power, draw power from the grid or do both. Power engineers may also work on systems that do not connect to the grid, called ''off-grid'' power systems, which in some cases are preferable to on-grid systems. The future includes Satellite controlled power systems, with feedback in real time to prevent power surges and prevent blackouts.

===Control===
{{Main|Control engineering}}
[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching.jpg|thumb|right|[[Control systems]] play a critical role in [[space flight]].]]
[[Control engineering]] focuses on the [[mathematical model|modeling]] of a diverse range of [[dynamic system]]s and the design of [[controller (control theory)|controllers]] that will cause these systems to behave in the desired manner.{{sfn|Bissell|1996|p=17}} To implement such controllers electrical engineers may use [[electronic circuit]]s, [[digital signal processor]]s, [[microcontroller]]s and [[programmable logic control]]s (PLCs). [[Control engineering]] has a wide range of applications from the flight and propulsion systems of [[Airliner|commercial airliners]] to the [[cruise control]] present in many modern [[automobile]]s.{{sfn|McDavid|Echaore-McDavid|2009|p=95}} It also plays an important role in [[industrial automation]].

Control engineers often utilize [[feedback]] when designing [[control system]]s. For example, in an [[automobile]] with [[cruise control]] the vehicle's [[speed]] is continuously monitored and fed back to the system which adjusts the [[Internal combustion engine|motor's]] [[Power (physics)|power]] output accordingly. Where there is regular feedback, [[control theory]] can be used to determine how the system responds to such feedback.{{sfn|Fairman|1998|p=119}}

===Electronics===
{{Main|Electronic engineering}}

[[File:Componentes.JPG|thumb|left|[[Electronic components]]]]
Electronic engineering involves the design and testing of [[electronic circuit]]s that use the properties of [[electrical element|components]] such as [[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, [[inductor]]s, [[diode]]s and [[transistor]]s to achieve a particular functionality.<ref name="UNESCO">{{cite book|title=Engineering: Issues, Challenges and Opportunities for Development|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=09i67GgGPCYC&pg=PA128|year=2010|publisher=UNESCO|isbn=978-92-3-104156-3|pages=127–8}}</ref> The [[tuned circuit]], which allows the user of a [[radio]] to [[electronic filter|filter]] out all but a single station, is just one example of such a circuit. Another example (of a pneumatic signal conditioner) is shown in the adjacent photograph.

Prior to the Second World War, the subject was commonly known as ''radio engineering'' and basically was restricted to aspects of communications and [[radar]], [[radio|commercial radio]] and [[television|early television]].<ref name="UNESCO"/> Later, in post war years, as consumer devices began to be developed, the field grew to include modern television, audio systems, [[computer]]s and [[microprocessors]]. In the mid-to-late 1950s, the term ''radio engineering'' gradually gave way to the name ''electronic engineering''.

Before the invention of the [[integrated circuit]] in 1959,{{Sfn|Thompson|2006|p=4}} electronic circuits were constructed from discrete components that could be manipulated by humans. These discrete circuits consumed much space and [[electric power|power]] and were limited in speed, although they are still common in some applications. By contrast, [[integrated circuit]]s packed a large number—often millions—of tiny electrical components, mainly [[transistor]]s,{{Sfn|Merhari|2009|p=233}} into a small chip around the size of a [[coin]]. This allowed for the powerful [[computer]]s and other electronic devices we see today.

===Microelectronics===
{{Main|Microelectronics}}
[[File:80486dx2-large.jpg|thumb|right|[[Microprocessor]]]]
[[Microelectronics]] engineering deals with the design and [[microfabrication]] of very small electronic circuit components for use in an [[integrated circuit]] or sometimes for use on their own as a general electronic component.{{Sfn|Bhushan|1997|p=581}} The most common microelectronic components are [[semiconductor]] [[transistor]]s, although all main electronic components ([[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s etc.) can be created at a microscopic level. [[Nanoelectronics]] is the further scaling of devices down to [[nanometer]] levels. Modern devices are already in the nanometer regime, with below 100&nbsp;nm processing having been standard since about 2002.{{Sfn|Mook|2008|p=149}}

Microelectronic components are created by chemically fabricating wafers of semiconductors such as silicon (at higher frequencies, [[compound semiconductor]]s like gallium arsenide and indium phosphide) to obtain the desired transport of electronic charge and control of current. The field of microelectronics involves a significant amount of chemistry and material science and requires the electronic engineer working in the field to have a very good working knowledge of the effects of [[quantum mechanics]].{{sfn|Sullivan|2012}}

===Signal processing===
{{Main|Signal processing}}
[[File:Bayer pattern on sensor.svg|thumb|left|A [[Bayer filter]] on a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] requires signal processing to get a red, green, and blue value at each pixel.]]
[[Signal processing]] deals with the analysis and manipulation of [[signal (information theory)|signals]].{{Sfn|Tuzlukov|2010|p=20}} Signals can be either [[analog signal|analog]], in which case the signal varies continuously according to the information, or [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital]], in which case the signal varies according to a series of discrete values representing the information. For analog signals, signal processing may involve the [[amplifier|amplification]] and [[Filter (signal processing)|filtering]] of audio signals for audio equipment or the [[modulation]] and [[demodulation]] of signals for [[telecommunication]]s. For digital signals, signal processing may involve the [[Data compression|compression]], [[error detection]] and [[error correction]] of digitally sampled signals.{{Sfn|Manolakis|Ingle|2011|p=17}}

Signal Processing is a very mathematically oriented and intensive area forming the core of [[digital signal processing]] and it is rapidly expanding with new applications in every field of electrical engineering such as communications, control, radar, [[audio engineer]]ing, [[broadcast engineering]], power electronics and bio-medical engineering as many already existing analog systems are replaced with their digital counterparts. [[Analog signal processing]] is still important in the design of many [[control system]]s.

DSP processor ICs are found in every type of modern electronic systems and products including, [[SDTV]] | [[HDTV]] sets,{{sfn|Bayoumi|Swartzlander|1994|p=25}} radios and mobile communication devices, [[Hi-Fi]] audio equipment, [[Dolby]] [[noise reduction]] algorithms, [[GSM]] mobile phones, [[mp3]] multimedia players, camcorders and digital cameras, automobile control systems, [[noise cancelling]] headphones, digital [[spectrum analyzer]]s, intelligent missile guidance, [[radar]], [[GPS]] based cruise control systems and all kinds of [[image processing]], [[video processing]], [[audio signal processing|audio processing]] and [[speech processing]] systems.{{Sfn|Khanna|2009|p=297}}

===Telecommunications===
{{Main|Telecommunications engineering}}
[[File:Erdfunkstelle Raisting 2a.jpg|thumb|right|[[Satellite dish]]es are a crucial component in the analysis of satellite information.]]
[[Telecommunications|Telecommunications engineering]] focuses on the [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of [[information]] across a [[channel (communications)|channel]] such as a [[coax cable]], [[optical fiber]] or [[free space optical communications|free space]].{{sfn|Tobin|2007|p=15}} Transmissions across free space require information to be encoded in a [[carrier wave]] to shift the information to a carrier frequency suitable for transmission, this is known as [[modulation]]. Popular analog modulation techniques include [[amplitude modulation]] and [[frequency modulation]].{{Sfn|Chandrasekhar|2006|p=21}} The choice of modulation affects the cost and performance of a system and these two factors must be balanced carefully by the engineer.

Once the transmission characteristics of a system are determined, telecommunication engineers design the [[transmitter]]s and [[receiver (radio)|receivers]] needed for such systems. These two are sometimes combined to form a two-way communication device known as a [[transceiver]]. A key consideration in the design of transmitters is their [[power consumption]] as this is closely related to their [[signal strength]].{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=19}}{{sfn|Zhang|Hu|Luo|2007|p=448}} If the signal strength of a transmitter is insufficient the signal's information will be corrupted by [[signal noise|noise]].

===Instrumentation===
{{Main|Instrumentation engineering}}
[[File:F-18E cockpit m02006112600499.jpg|thumb|right|[[Flight instruments]] provide pilots with the tools to control aircraft analytically.]]
[[Instrumentation engineering]] deals with the design of devices to measure physical quantities such as [[pressure]], [[Volumetric flow rate|flow]] and [[temperature]].{{Sfn|Grant|Bixley|2011|p=159}} The design of such instrumentation requires a good understanding of [[physics]] that often extends beyond [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic theory]]. For example, [[flight instruments]] measure variables such as [[wind speed]] and [[altitude]] to enable pilots the control of aircraft analytically. Similarly, [[thermocouple]]s use the [[Peltier-Seebeck effect]] to measure the temperature difference between two points.{{sfn|Fredlund|Rahardjo|Fredlund|2012|p=346}}

Often instrumentation is not used by itself, but instead as the [[sensor]]s of larger electrical systems. For example, a thermocouple might be used to help ensure a furnace's temperature remains constant.<ref>{{cite book|title=Manual on the Use of Thermocouples in Temperature Measurement|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Pos-MXDWb6MC&pg=PA154|date=1 January 1993|publisher=ASTM International|isbn=978-0-8031-1466-1|page=154}}</ref> For this reason, instrumentation engineering is often viewed as the counterpart of control engineering.

===Computers===
{{Main|Computer engineering}}
[[File:MEGWARE.CLIC.jpg|thumb|right|[[Supercomputer]]s are used in fields as diverse as [[computational biology]] and [[geographic information systems]].]]
Computer engineering deals with the design of [[computer]]s and [[computer system]]s. This may involve the design of new [[computer hardware|hardware]], the design of [[personal digital assistant|PDAs]], tablets and [[supercomputers]] or the use of computers to control an [[manufacturing|industrial plant]].{{sfn|Obaidat|Denko|Woungang|2011|p=9}} Computer engineers may also work on a system's [[software]]. However, the design of complex software systems is often the domain of [[software engineering]], which is usually considered a separate discipline.{{sfn|Jalote|2006|p=22}} [[Desktop computer]]s represent a tiny fraction of the devices a computer engineer might work on, as computer-like architectures are now found in a range of devices including [[video game console]]s and [[DVD player]]s.

===Related disciplines===
[[File:VIP Bird2.jpg|thumb|left|The Bird VIP Infant ventilator]]
[[Mechatronics]] is an engineering discipline which deals with the convergence of electrical and [[machine|mechanical]] systems. Such combined systems are known as [[electromechanical]] systems and have widespread adoption. Examples include [[automation|automated manufacturing systems]],{{sfn|Mahalik|2003|p=569}} [[HVAC|heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems]]{{sfn|Leondes|2000|p=199}} and various subsystems of [[aircraft]] and [[automobile]]s.
{{sfn|Shetty|Kolk|2010|p=36}}

The term ''mechatronics'' is typically used to refer to [[macroscopic]] systems but [[Futures studies|futurists]] have predicted the emergence of very small electromechanical devices. Already such small devices, known as [[Microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS), are used in automobiles to tell [[airbag]]s when to deploy,{{sfn|Maluf|Williams|2004|p=3}} in [[digital projector]]s to create sharper images and in [[inkjet printer]]s to create nozzles for high definition printing. In the future it is hoped the devices will help build tiny implantable medical devices and improve [[optical communication]].{{Sfn|Iga|Kokubun|2010|p=137}}

[[Biomedical engineering]] is another related discipline, concerned with the design of [[medical equipment]]. This includes fixed equipment such as [[ventilator]]s, [[MRI|MRI scanners]]{{Sfn|Dodds|Kumar|Veering|2014|p=274}} and [[electrocardiograph|electrocardiograph monitors]] as well as mobile equipment such as [[cochlear implant]]s, [[artificial pacemaker]]s and [[artificial heart]]s.

At some schools, the students can then choose to emphasize one or more subdisciplines towards the end of their courses of study.

[[File:LM317 typical schematic.svg|thumb|left|Typical [[circuit diagram|electrical engineering diagram]] used as a [[troubleshooting]] tool]]

At many schools, electronic engineering is included as part of an electrical award, sometimes explicitly, such as a Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical and Electronic), but in others electrical and electronic engineering are both considered to be sufficiently broad and complex that separate degrees are offered.<ref>{{cite web|title=Electrical and Electronic Engineering|url=http://www.flinders.edu.au/science_engineering/csem/disciplines/eee/|accessdate=8 December 2011}}</ref>

Some electrical engineers choose to study for a postgraduate degree such as a [[Master of Engineering]]/[[Master of Science]] (M.Eng./M.Sc.), a Master of [[Engineering Management]], a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.) in Engineering, an [[Engineering Doctorate]] (Eng.D.), or an [[Engineer's degree]]. The master's and engineer's degrees may consist of either [[research]], [[coursework]] or a mixture of the two. The Doctor of Philosophy and Engineering Doctorate degrees consist of a significant research component and are often viewed as the entry point to [[academia]]. In the United Kingdom and some other European countries, Master of Engineering is often considered to be an undergraduate degree of slightly longer duration than the Bachelor of Engineering rather than postgraduate.<ref>Various including graduate degree requirements [http://www.eecs.mit.edu/grad/degrees.html at MIT], study guide [http://www.ecm.uwa.edu.au/students/study-guides-2012/be-elec-mech at UWA], the curriculum [http://www.queensu.ca/calendars/appsci/pg219.html at Queen's] and unit tables [http://www.abdn.ac.uk/registry/calendar/requirements/07H50116.doc at Aberdeen]</ref>

==Practicing engineers==
[[File:Belgium. Belgian electrical engineers Georges Jean L. Van Antro, left, Georges H. Marchal, center, and Jacques de... - NARA - 541661.tif|thumb|right|Belgian electrical engineers inspecting the rotor of a 40,000 kilowatt [[turbine]] of the [[General Electric Company]] in New York City]]
In most countries, a bachelor's degree in engineering represents the first step towards [[professional certification]] and the degree program itself is certified by a [[professional body]].<ref name="Labor2008">{{cite book|title=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2008–2009|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=F4ZS7UQ1QZoC|date=1 March 2008|publisher=U S Department of Labor, Jist Works|isbn=978-1-59357-513-7|page=148}}</ref> After completing a certified degree program the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements (including work experience requirements) before being certified. Once certified the engineer is designated the title of [[Professional Engineer]] (in the United States, Canada and South Africa), [[Chartered engineer|Chartered Engineer]] or [[Incorporated Engineer]]  (in India, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, Ireland and [[Zimbabwe]]), Chartered Professional Engineer (in Australia and New Zealand) or [[European Engineer]] (in much of the [[European Union]]).

[[File:3 Park Avenue.JPG|thumb|left|The [[IEEE]] corporate office is on the 17th floor of [[3 Park Avenue]] in [[New York City]]]]
The advantages of certification vary depending upon location. For example, in the United States and Canada "only a licensed engineer may seal engineering work for public and private clients".<ref>{{cite web | title = Why Should You Get Licensed? | work = National Society of Professional Engineers | url = http://www.nspe.org/lc1-why.asp | accessdate =11 July 2005 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050604085233/http://www.nspe.org/lc1-why.asp| archivedate = 4 June 2005}}</ref> This requirement is enforced by state and provincial legislation such as [[Quebec]]'s Engineers Act.<ref>{{cite web | title = Engineers Act | work = Quebec Statutes and Regulations (CanLII) | url = http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&file=//I_9/I9_A.htm | accessdate =24 July 2005 }}</ref> In other countries, no such legislation exists. Practically all certifying bodies maintain a [[ethical code|code of ethics]] that they expect all members to abide by or risk expulsion.<ref>{{cite web | title = Codes of Ethics and Conduct | work = Online Ethics Center | url = http://onlineethics.org/CMS/profpractice/ethcodes.aspx | accessdate =24 July 2005 }}</ref> In this way these organizations play an important role in maintaining ethical standards for the profession. Even in jurisdictions where certification has little or no legal bearing on work, engineers are subject to [[contract law]]. In cases where an engineer's work fails he or she may be subject to the [[negligence|tort of negligence]] and, in extreme cases, the charge of [[criminal negligence]]. An engineer's work must also comply with numerous other rules and regulations such as [[building codes]] and legislation pertaining to [[environmental law]].

Professional bodies of note for electrical engineers include the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) and the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] (IET).  The IEEE claims to produce 30% of the world's literature in electrical engineering, has over 360,000 members worldwide and holds over 3,000 conferences annually.<ref>{{cite web | title = About the IEEE | work = IEEE | url = http://www.ieee.org/about/ | accessdate =11 July 2005 }}</ref> The IET publishes 21 journals, has a worldwide membership of over 150,000, and claims to be the largest professional engineering society in Europe.<ref>{{cite web | title = About the IET | work = The IET | url = http://www.theiet.org/about/ | accessdate =11 July 2005 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Journal and Magazines | work = The IET | url = http://www.theiet.org/publishing/journals/ | accessdate =11 July 2005 }}</ref> Obsolescence of technical skills is a serious concern for electrical engineers. Membership and participation in technical societies, regular reviews of periodicals in the field and a habit of continued learning are therefore essential to maintaining proficiency. MIET(Member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology) is recognised in Europe as Electrical and computer (technology) engineer.<ref>{{cite web | title = Electrical and Electronics Engineers, except Computer | work = Occupational Outlook Handbook | url = http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos031.htm | accessdate =16 July 2005|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050713014728/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos031.htm|archivedate=13 July 2005}} (see [[work of the United States Government|here]] regarding copyright)</ref>

In Australia, Canada and the United States electrical engineers make up around 0.25% of the labor force (see [[#demographics|<span id="demographics_back">note</span>]]).

==Tools and work==

From the [[Global Positioning System]] to [[electricity generation|electric power generation]], electrical engineers have contributed to the development of a wide range of technologies. They design, develop, test and supervise the deployment of electrical systems and electronic devices. For example, they may work on the design of [[telecommunication|telecommunication systems]], the operation of [[power station|electric power stations]], the [[lighting]] and [[electrical wiring|wiring]] of [[building]]s, the design of [[home appliance|household appliances]] or the electrical [[control theory|control]] of industrial machinery.<ref>{{cite web | title = Electrical and Electronics Engineers, except Computer | work = Occupational Outlook Handbook | url = http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos031.htm | accessdate =16 July 2005 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050713014728/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos031.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 13 July 2005}} (see {{Wayback |date= |url=www.bls.gov/oco/ocos031.htm }})</ref>

[[File:Molnya-1 Musee du Bourget P1010442.jpg|thumb|left|[[Communications satellite|Satellite communications]] is typical of what electrical engineers work on.]]
Fundamental to the discipline are the sciences of [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] as these help to obtain both a [[Qualitative data|qualitative]] and [[Quantity|quantitative]] description of how such systems will work. Today most [[engineering]] work involves the use of [[computers]] and it is commonplace to use [[computer-aided design]] programs when designing electrical systems. Nevertheless, the ability to sketch ideas is still invaluable for quickly communicating with others.

[[File:Shadow Hand Bulb large.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Shadow Hand|Shadow robot hand]] system]]
Although most electrical engineers will understand basic [[circuit theory]] (that is the interactions of elements such as [[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, [[diode]]s, [[transistor]]s and [[inductor]]s in a circuit), the theories employed by engineers generally depend upon the work they do. For example, [[quantum mechanics]] and [[solid state physics]] might be relevant to an engineer working on [[VLSI]] (the design of integrated circuits), but are largely irrelevant to engineers working with macroscopic electrical systems. Even [[circuit theory]] may not be relevant to a person designing telecommunication systems that use [[commercial off-the-shelf|off-the-shelf]] components. Perhaps the most important technical skills for electrical engineers are reflected in university programs, which emphasize [[numeracy|strong numerical skills]], [[computer literacy]] and the ability to understand the [[technical terminology|technical language and concepts]] that relate to electrical engineering.{{Sfn|Taylor|2008|p=241}}

[[File:Laser in fibre.jpg|thumb|A [[laser]] bouncing down an [[poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic]] rod, illustrating the total internal reflection of light in a multi-mode optical fiber.]]

A wide range of instrumentation is used by electrical engineers.  For simple control circuits and alarms, a basic [[multimeter]] measuring [[voltage]], [[electric current|current]] and [[electrical resistance|resistance]] may suffice.  Where time-varying signals need to be studied, the [[oscilloscope]] is also an ubiquitous instrument.  In [[RF engineering]] and high frequency telecommunications [[spectrum analyzer]]s and [[Network analyzer (electrical)|network analyzer]]s are used.  In some disciplines safety can be a particular concern with instrumentation.  For instance medical electronics designers must take into account that much lower voltages than normal can be dangerous when electrodes are directly in contact with internal body fluids.{{sfn|Leitgeb|2010|P=122}} Power transmission engineering also has great safety concerns due to the high voltages used; although [[voltmeter]]s may in principle be similar to their low voltage equivalents, safety and calibration issues make them very different.<ref>{{harvnb|Naidu|Kamaraju|2009|p=210}}</ref>  Many disciplines of electrical engineering use tests specific to their discipline.  Audio electronics engineers use [[audio system measurements|audio test sets]] consisting of a signal generator and a meter, principally to measure level but also other parameters such as [[harmonic distortion]] and [[noise (electronics)|noise]].  Likewise information technology have their own test sets, often specific to a particular data format, and the same is true of television broadcasting.

[[File:Navy-Radome.jpg|left|260px|thumbnail|[[Radome]] at the Misawa Air Base Misawa Security Operations Center, Misawa, Japan]]
For many engineers, technical work accounts for only a fraction of the work they do. A lot of time may also be spent on tasks such as discussing proposals with clients, preparing [[budget]]s and determining [[schedule (project management)|project schedules]].<ref>Trevelyan, James; (2005). ''What Do Engineers Really Do?''. University of Western Australia. (seminar with [http://www.mech.uwa.edu.au/jpt/Engineering%20Roles%20050503.pdf slides])</ref> Many senior engineers manage a team of [[technician]]s or other engineers and for this reason [[project management]] skills are important. Most engineering projects involve some form of documentation and [[technical writing|strong written communication]] skills are therefore very important.

The [[Office|workplaces]] of engineers are just as varied as the types of work they do. Electrical engineers may be found in the pristine lab environment of a [[fabrication plant]], the offices of a [[consulting firm]] or on site at a [[mining|mine]]. During their working life, electrical engineers may find themselves supervising a wide range of individuals including [[scientist]]s, [[electrician]]s, [[computer programmers]] and other engineers.{{Sfn|McDavid|Echaore-McDavid|2009|p=87}}

Electrical engineering has an intimate relationship with the physical sciences.  For instance the physicist [[Lord Kelvin]] played a major role in the engineering of the first [[transatlantic telegraph cable]].<ref>Huurdeman, pp.&nbsp;95–96</ref>  Conversely, the engineer [[Oliver Heaviside]] produced major work on the mathematics of transmission on telegraph cables.<ref>Huurdeman, p.90</ref>  Electrical engineers are often required on major science projects.  For instance, large [[particle accelerator]]s such as [[CERN]] need electrical engineers to deal with many aspects of the project: from the power distribution, to the instrumentation, to the manufacture and installation of the [[superconducting electromagnet]]s.<ref>Schmidt, p.218</ref><ref>Martini, p.179</ref>
