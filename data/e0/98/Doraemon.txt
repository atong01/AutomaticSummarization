'''''Doraemon''''' ({{lang-ja|ドラえもん}}) is a Japanese [[manga]] series written and illustrated by the manga writing team [[Fujiko Fujio]]. The series has also been adapted into a successful [[anime]] series and [[media franchise]]. The story revolves around a [[Robot|robotic cat]] named [[Doraemon (character)|Doraemon]], who [[time travel|travels back in time]] from the 22nd century to aid a pre-teen boy named {{nihongo|Nobita Nobi|野比のび太|Nobi Nobita}}.

The Doraemon manga series was first published in December 1969 in six different magazines. A total of 1,345 stories were created in the original series, which are published by [[Shogakukan]] under the {{nihongo|Tentōmushi|てんとう虫}} manga brand, extending to forty-five volumes. The volumes are collected in the Takaoka Central Library in [[Toyama Prefecture|Toyama]], Japan, where Fujiko Fujio was born. [[Turner Broadcasting System]] bought the rights to the Doraemon anime series in the mid-1980s for a United States English-language release,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jref.com/japan/travel/prefectures/kanagawa/doraemon_museum.shtml |title=Fujiko F. Fujio Museum |publisher=Japan Reference |accessdate=September 11, 2012}}</ref> but canceled it without explanation before broadcasting any episodes. In July 2013 it was announced that the manga would be released digitally in English via the [[Amazon Kindle]] [[e-book]] service. It is [[List of best-selling manga|one of the best-selling manga in the world]], having sold over 100 million copies.

Awards for Doraemon include the [[Japan Cartoonists Association Award]] for excellence in 1973, the first [[Shogakukan Manga Award]] for [[Children's anime and manga|children's manga]] in 1982,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://comics.shogakukan.co.jp/mangasho/rist.html | script-title=ja:小学館漫画賞: 歴代受賞者 | publisher=Shogakukan | language=Japanese | accessdate=August 19, 2007}}</ref> and the first [[Osamu Tezuka Culture Award]] in 1997.

The [[List of Doraemon films|film series]] is the largest by number of admissions in Japan.

==Name==
The name "Doraemon" can be roughly translated  to "stray." "Dora" derives from "''dora neko''" (brazen or stray cat, どら猫), and is a corruption of ''nora'' (stray). "Emon" 衛門、右衛門 is an archaic component of male given names like Goemon. "Dora" is not derived (directly) from ''dora'' 銅鑼, meaning gong, but rather a pun on that and the fact that Doraemon loves [[dorayaki]]. The name {{Nihongo|"Doraemon"|ドラえもん}} is stylized as an unusual mixture of [[Katakana]] (ドラ 'dora') and [[Hiragana]] (えもん 'emon').

==Plot==
[[File:Doraemon first appearance.jpg|thumb|300px|The first appearance of Doraemon, who came via the time machine.]]

{{main|List of Doraemon characters}}

[[Doraemon (character)|Doraemon]] is sent back in time by a young boy named Sewashi Nobi to improve the circumstances of his grandfather, [[Nobita Nobi|Nobita]], so that his descendants may enjoy a better future. In the original timeline, Nobita experienced nothing but misery and misfortune manifested in the form of very poor grades and bullying throughout his life. This culminates in the burning down of a future business he sets up which leaves his family line beset with financial problems. In order to alter history and better the Nobi family's fortunes, Sewashi initially wanted to send a super-robot to protect Nobita, but with his meager allowance he could only afford an imperfectly-made factory-rejected toy: an anthropomorphic robot cat called Doraemon.

Doraemon has a pocket from which he produces toys, medicines, and tools from the future, all of which are referred to as 'gadgets' by Doraemon. Some of the gadgets  are based on real Japanese household devices with fanciful twists, but most are completely [[science fiction]]. Thousands of gadgets have been featured in the series with such as the "[[bamboo-copter]]", a small head accessory that allows flight and the "Anywhere Door", a door that opens up to any place the user wishes.

Nobita's closest friend is Shizuka Minamoto, who also serves as his romantic interest. Nobita is usually tormented by the bully Takeshi Goda, nicknamed "Gian", and the cunning and arrogant Suneo Honekawa. A typical story consists of Doraemon using one of his gadgets in order to assist Nobita in various ways, often causing more trouble than he was trying to solve.

In December 1969 the ''Doraemon'' manga appeared in six different children's monthly magazines published by [[Shogakukan]]. The magazines were aimed at children from nursery school to fourth grade.

In addition, Doraemon has appeared in a variety of manga series by Shōgakukan.

===Anime===

====Television series====
{{main|Doraemon (1973 anime)|Doraemon (1979 anime)|Doraemon (2005 anime)}}
After a brief and unpopular animated series in 1973 by [[Nippon Television]], ''Doraemon'' remained fairly exclusive in manga form until 1979 when a newly formed animation studio, [[Shin-Ei Animation]] (Now owned by [[TV Asahi]]) produced an anime series of ''Doraemon.''<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schilling|first1=Mark|title=The Encyclopedia of Japanese Pop Culture|date=1997|publisher=Weatherhill|location=New York|page=39|accessdate=25 December 2014}}</ref> This series became incredibly popular, and ended with 1,787 episodes on March 25, 2005.

Celebrating the anniversary of the franchise, a new ''Doraemon'' series began airing on TV Asahi on April 15, 2005 with new [[seiyū|voice actors]] and staff, and updated character designs. On May 12, 2014, TV Asahi Corporation announced an agreement with [[The Walt Disney Company]] to bring the 2005 series to the [[Disney XD]] television channel in the United States beginning in the summer of that year.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Consumers/Doraemon-plans-to-make-US-debut-this-summer|title=Doraemon plans to make U.S. debut this summer|date=May 9, 2004|accessdate=May 24, 2014}}</ref> Besides using the name changes that were used in AltJapan's English adaptation of the original manga, other changes and edits have also been made to make the show more relatable to an American audience, such as Japanese text being replaced with English text on certain objects like signs and graded papers, and items such as [[Japanese yen|yen notes]] being replaced by [[United States dollar|US dollar bills]]. Confirmed cast member of the new American adaptation include veteran anime voice actress [[Mona Marshall]] in the title role of Doraemon and [[Johnny Yong Bosch]] of ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers|Power Rangers]]'' and ''[[Bleach (anime)|Bleach]]'' fame as Noby. The English dub is produced by [[Bang Zoom!

====Feature films====
{{Further|List of Doraemon films}}
In 1980, [[Toho]] released the first of a series of annual feature length [[animated film]]s based on the lengthy special volumes published annually. Unlike the anime and manga (some based on the stories in select volumes), they are more action-adventure oriented and have more of a [[Shōnen manga|shōnen]] demographic, taking the familiar characters of ''Doraemon'' and placing them in a variety of exotic and perilous settings. Nobita and his friends have visited the age of the [[dinosaur]]s, the far reaches of the [[galaxy]], the heart of darkest Africa (where they encountered a race of sentient bipedal dogs), the depths of the ocean, and a world of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]]. Some of the films are based on [[legend]]s such as [[Atlantis]], and on literary works including ''[[Journey to the West]]'' and ''[[Arabian Nights]].'' Some films also have serious themes, especially on environmental topics and the use of technology. Overall, the films have a somewhat darker tone in their stories, unlike the manga and anime.

===Video games===
{{details|List of Doraemon video games}}

There are a total of 63 Japanese-only video games ranging from platformer games to RPG games, which began with the Emerson's [[Arcadia 2001]] system.

As one of the oldest, continuously running icons, Doraemon is a recognizable character in this contemporary generation. Nobita, the show's protagonist, is a break from other characters typically portrayed as special or extraordinary, and this portrayal has been seen as reasons of its appeal as well as the contrary: especially in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|author=TETSUO IWAMOTO, Asahi Staff Writer|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/cool_japan/culture/AJ201209030098 |title=Happy birthday!

In late 2011, Shogakukan and [[Toyota]] joined forces to create a series of live-action commercials as part of Toyota's ReBorn ad campaign. The commercials depict the characters nearly 20 years older. Hollywood actor [[Jean Reno]] plays Doraemon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-07-14/jean-reno-goes-to-olympics-as-doraemon-in-new-live-action-ad |title=Jean Reno Goes to Olympics as Doraemon in New Live-Action Ad – News |work=Anime News Network |date=2013-01-27 |accessdate=2013-01-31}}</ref>

Doraemon has become a prevalent part of popular culture in Japan. Newspapers also regularly make references to Doraemon and his pocket as something with the ability to satisfy all wishes. Other characters in the series are also referenced frequently on TV shows if their cast resembles them.

Doraemon appears in appeals for charity. [[TV Asahi]] launched the ''Doraemon Fund'' charity fund to raise money for natural disasters.<ref>{{cite web |title=Doraemon Fund |url=http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/doraemonbokin/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040111135443/http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/doraemonbokin/ |archivedate=January 11, 2004  |work=[[TV Asahi]]}}</ref>
