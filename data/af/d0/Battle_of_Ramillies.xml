Villeroi still believed (on 22 May) the Allies were a full days march away when in fact they had camped near Corswaren waiting for the Danish squadrons to catch up; for his part, Marlborough deemed Villeroi still at Jodoigne when in reality he was now approaching the plateau of Mont St. Andr with the intention of pitching camp near Ramillies (see map at right).<extension extension_name='ref' name="chandler172"></extension><space/>However, the Prussian infantry was not there.

A large open plain, just over 1 mile (~2&amp;nbsp;km) wide, lay between Taviers and Ramillies, but unlike Blenheim, there was no stream to hinder the cavalry. His centre was secured by Ramillies itself, lying on a slight eminence which gave distant views to the north and east. The French left flank was protected by broken country, and by a stream, the Petite Gheete, which runs deep between steep and slippery slopes. On the French side of the stream the ground rises to Offus, the village which, together with Autre-Eglise farther north, anchored Villerois left flank. To the west of the Petite Gheete rises the plateau of Mont St. Andr; a second plain, the plateau of Jandrenouille upon which the Anglo-Dutch army amassed rises to the east.<extension extension_name='ref' name="barnett162"></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Initial dispositions</heading><paragraph><link><target>Image:Ramillies 1706, initial attack.png</target><part>thumb</part><part>250px</part><part>Initial attack at the Battle of Ramillies, 23 May 1706.

The centre was formed by the mass of Dutch, German, Protestant Swiss and Scottish infantry perhaps 30,000 men facing Offus and Ramillies. Also facing Ramillies Marlborough placed a powerful battery of thirty 24-pounders, dragged into position by a team of oxen; further batteries were positioned overlooking the Petite Gheete.

These guns (some of which were of the three barrelled kind first seen at Elixheim the previous year) enjoyed good arcs of fire, able to fully cover the approaches of the plateau of Jandrenouille over which the Allied infantry would have to pass.</paragraph><paragraph>Marlborough, however, noticed several important weaknesses in the French dispositions.<extension extension_name='ref'>Chandler:<space/><italics>A Guide to the Battlefields of Europe,</italics><space/>30</extension><space/>Tactically, it was imperative for Villeroi to occupy Taviers on his right and Autre-Eglise on his left, but by adopting this posture he had been forced to over-extend his forces.<extension extension_name='ref' name="lynn304">Lynn:<space/><italics>The Wars of Louis XIV, 16671714,</italics><space/>304</extension><space/>Moreover, this disposition concave in relation to the Allied army gave Marlborough the opportunity to form a more compact line, drawn up in a shorter front between the horns of the French crescent; when the Allied blow came it would be more concentrated and carry more weight.

Despite Orkneys protestations, Cadogan insisted on compliance and, reluctantly, Orkney gave the word for his troops to fall back to their original positions on the edge of the plateau of Jandrenouille.

Shielded as they were from observation by a slight fold in the land, their commander, Brigadier-General Van Pallandt, ordered the regimental colours to be left in place on the edge of the plateau to convince their opponents they were still in their initial position. Therefore, unbeknown to the French who remained oblivious to the Allies real strength and intentions on the opposite side of the Petite Gheete, Marlborough was throwing his full weight against Ramillies and the open plain to the south. Villeroi meanwhile, was still moving more reserves of infantry in the opposite direction towards his left flank; crucially, it would be some time before the French commander noticed the subtle change in emphasis of the Allied dispositions.<extension extension_name='ref'>Falkner:<space/><italics>Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,</italics><space/>78</extension></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Image:Hendrik van Nassau-Ouwerkerk.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>170px</part><part>''Henry of Nassau, Lord of Overkirk'' (1640-1708).</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>At around 15:30, Overkirk advanced his massed squadrons on the open plain in support of the infantry attack on Ramillies.
