In [[geology]], '''beryl''' is a [[mineral]] composed of [[beryllium]] [[aluminium]] [[Silicate minerals#Cyclosilicates|cyclosilicate]] with the [[chemical formula]] Be<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>6</sub>O<sub>18</sub>. The [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]] [[crystal]]s of beryl may be very small or range to several meters in size. Terminated crystals are relatively rare. Pure beryl is colorless, but it is frequently tinted by impurities; possible colors are green, blue, yellow, red, and white.

==Etymology==
The name beryl is derived (via [[Latin]]: ''beryllus'', [[Old French]]: ''beryl'', and [[Middle English]]: beril) from [[Greek language|Greek]] βήρυλλος ''beryllos'' which referred to a "precious blue-green color-of-sea-water stone"; akin to [[Prakrit]] ''verulia'', ''veluriya'' ("beryl").<ref>{{cite web |title=beryl |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster|Merriam-Webster, Inc.]] |work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/beryl |accessdate=January 27, 2014}}</ref> The German word ''Brille'' and the Dutch word ''bril'' (eyeglasses) are also derived from Prakrit ''verulia''.<ref>Olivelle, Patrick (2006), Between the Empires, Society in India 300 BCE to 400 CE, page 463, Oxford University Press.</ref> The term was later adopted for the mineral beryl more exclusively.<ref name=Webmineral/>

==Deposits==
Beryl of various colors is found most commonly in [[granite|granitic]] [[pegmatite]]s, but also occurs in [[mica]] [[schist]]s in the [[Urals|Ural Mountains]], and [[limestone]] in [[Colombia]]. Beryl is often associated with [[tin]] and [[tungsten]] ore bodies. Beryl is found in [[Europe]] in [[Norway]], [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Sweden]] (especially morganite), [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Russia]], as well as [[Brazil]], Colombia, [[Madagascar]], [[Mozambique]], [[South Africa]], the [[United States]], and [[Zambia]]. US beryl locations are in [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Connecticut]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Idaho]], [[Maine]], [[New Hampshire]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Dakota]] and [[Utah]].

[[New England]]'s [[pegmatites]] have produced some of the largest beryls found, including one massive crystal from the [[Bumpus Quarry]] in [[Albany, Maine]] with dimensions {{convert|5.5|by|1.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} with a mass of around 18 [[Tonne|metric tons]]; it is New Hampshire's state mineral. {{As of|1999}}, the world's largest known naturally occurring crystal of any mineral is a crystal of beryl from Malakialina, Madagascar, {{convert|18|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3.5|m|abbr=on}} in diameter, and weighing {{convert|380,000|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref>G. Cressey and I. F. Mercer, (1999) ''Crystals'', London, Natural History Museum, page 58</ref>

==Varieties==

===Aquamarine and maxixe===
[[File:Aigue-marine Pakistan 180308.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|Aquamarine]]
[[File:Aquamarin-G-EmpireTheWorldOfGems.jpg|thumb|left|Faceted aquamarine, 13.24ct, Brazil]]
Aquamarine (from {{lang-la|aqua marina}}, "water of the sea") is a blue or [[cyan]] variety of beryl. It occurs at most localities which yield ordinary beryl. The gem-gravel [[Placer mining|placer]] deposits of [[Sri Lanka]] contain aquamarine. Clear yellow beryl, such as that occurring in Brazil, is sometimes called ''aquamarine chrysolite''.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} The deep blue version of aquamarine is called ''maxixe''. Maxixe is commonly found in the country of Madagascar. Its color fades to white when exposed to sunlight or is subjected to heat treatment, though the color returns with irradiation.

The pale blue color of aquamarine is attributed to Fe<sup>2+</sup>. The Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions produce golden-yellow color, and when both Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup> are present, the color is a darker blue as in maxixe. Decoloration of maxixe by light or heat thus may be due to the charge transfer between Fe<sup>3+</sup> and Fe<sup>2+</sup>.<ref name=color>{{cite web|url=http://minerals.caltech.edu/FILES/Visible/BERYL/Index.htm| title = Color in the Beryl group| accessdate = 2009-06-06}}</ref><ref name=ibragim>{{cite journal| doi =10.1134/S0020168509020101| title =Correlations between admixtures and color centers created upon irradiation of natural beryl crystals| year =2009| author =Ibragimova, E.

In the United States, aquamarines can be found at the summit of [[Mount Antero|Mt. Antero]] in the [[Sawatch Range]] in central Colorado. In [[Wyoming]], aquamarine has been discovered in the [[Big Horn Mountains]], near [[Powder River Pass]].  Another location within the United States is the [[Sawtooth Range (Idaho)|Sawtooth Range]] near [[Stanley, Idaho]].  Although the minerals are within a wilderness area which prevents collecting.  In Brazil, there are mines in the states of [[Minas Gerais]], [[Espírito Santo]], and [[Bahia]], and minorly in [[Rio Grande do Norte]]. The mines of Colombia, Zambia, Madagascar, [[Malawi]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Kenya]] also produce aquamarine.

The largest aquamarine of gemstone quality ever mined was found in Marambaia, Minas Gerais, Brazil, in 1910.

It is named for the ''trapiche'', a grinding wheel used to process [[sugarcane]] in the region. Colombian emeralds are generally the most prized due to their transparency and fire. Some of the rarest emeralds come from three main emerald mining areas in Colombia: Muzo, Coscuez, and Chivor. Fine emeralds are also found in other countries, such as [[Zambia]], [[Brazil]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Madagascar]], [[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Russia]]. In the US, emeralds can be found in [[Hiddenite, North Carolina]]. In 1998, emeralds were discovered in the [[Yukon]].

[[File:Beryl golden beryl rough XH.jpg|thumb|left|90px|Golden beryl]]
[[File:Beryl heliodor polished XH.jpg|thumb|left|90px|Heliodor]]
''Golden beryl'' can range in colors from pale yellow to a brilliant gold. Unlike [[emerald]], golden beryl has very few flaws. The term "golden beryl" is sometimes synonymous with ''heliodor'' (from Greek ''hēlios – ἥλιος'' "sun" + ''dōron – δῶρον'' "gift") but golden beryl refers to pure yellow or golden yellow shades, while heliodor refers to the greenish-yellow shades. The golden yellow color is attributed to Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions.<ref name=color/><ref name=ibragim/> Both golden beryl and heliodor are used as gems. Probably the largest cut golden beryl is the flawless 2054 [[Carat (unit)|carat]] stone on display in the [[National Museum of Natural History#Hall of Geology, Gems, and Minerals|Hall of Gems]], [[Washington, D.C.]], United States.<ref>{{cite book| page=77|url=http://books.google.com/?id=MPZK8ILOSR0C&pg=PA77| title = Gemstones| author = Arthur Thomas| publisher = New Holland Publishers| isbn = 1-84537-602-1| year=2007}}</ref>

[[File:Zrost beryli, Namibia3.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Goshenite]]
Colorless beryl is called ''goshenite''. The name originates from [[Goshen, Massachusetts]] where it was originally discovered. Since all these color varieties are caused by impurities and pure beryl is colorless, it might be tempting to assume that goshenite is the purest variety of beryl. However, there are several elements that can act as inhibitors to color in beryl and so this assumption may not always be true. The name goshenite has been said to be on its way to extinction and yet it is still commonly used in the gemstone markets. Goshenite is found to some extent in almost all beryl localities. In the past, goshenite was used for manufacturing eyeglasses and lenses owing to its transparency. Nowadays, it is most commonly used for gemstone purposes and also considered as a source of beryllium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galleries.com/minerals/gemstone/goshenit/goshenit.htm| title = Goshenite, the colorless variety of beryl| accessdate = 2009-06-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://opticalmineralogy.com/the-silicates-mineral-class/goshenite-gem/| title = Goshenite gem| accessdate = 2009-06-06}}</ref>

The gem value of goshenite is relatively low. However, goshenite can be colored yellow, green, pink, blue and in intermediate colors by irradiating it with high-energy particles. The resulting color depends on the content of Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Fe, and Co impurities.<ref name=ibragim/>

===Morganite===
[[File:Morganit-G-EmpireTheWorldOfGems.jpg|thumb|right|Faceted morganite, 2.01ct, Brazil]]
[[File:Morganite (Brésil).jpg|thumb|left|100px|Morganite]]
Morganite, also known as "pink beryl", "rose beryl", "pink emerald", and "cesian (or ''caesian'') beryl", is a rare light pink to rose-colored [[Gemstone|gem]]-quality variety of beryl. Orange/yellow varieties of morganite can also be found, and color banding is common. It can be routinely heat treated to remove patches of yellow and is occasionally treated by irradiation to improve its color. The pink color of morganite is attributed to Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions.<ref name=color/>
 
Pink beryl of fine color and good sizes was first discovered on an island on the coast of Madagascar in 1910.<ref name="query.nytimes.com">{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E0DE4DD1339E433A25755C0A9649D946196D6CF | work=The New York Times | title=GEM NAMED FOR MORGAN.; Newly Discovered Pink Beryl Is to be Known as Morganite | date=1910-12-06}}</ref> It was also known, with other gemstone minerals, such as [[tourmaline]] and [[kunzite]], at [[Pala, California]].

[[File:RedBeryl-G-EmpireTheWorldOfGems.jpg|thumb|right|Faceted red beryl, 0.56 ct, Utah US]]
[[File:Beryl-196800.jpg|thumb|left|Red beryl]]
Red beryl (also known as "red emerald" or "scarlet emerald") is a red variety of beryl. It was first described in 1904 for an occurrence, its [[Type locality (geology)|type locality]], at Maynard's Claim (Pismire Knolls), Thomas Range, [[Juab County, Utah|Juab County]], [[Utah]].<ref>[http://www.mindat.org/min-690.html MinDat – Red beryl]</ref><ref>[http://geology.utah.gov/surveynotes/gladasked/gladberyl.htm Carl Ege, Utah Geological Survey]</ref> The old synonym "bixbite" is deprecated from the [[World Jewellery Confederation|CIBJO]], because of the risk of confusion with the mineral [[bixbyite]] (also named after the mineralogist [[Maynard Bixby]]). The dark red color is attributed to Mn<sup>3+</sup> ions.<ref name=color/>

Red beryl is very rare and has only been reported from a handful of locations including: [[Wah Wah Mountains]], [[Beaver County, Utah]]; [[Black Range|Paramount Canyon]] and [[Black Range|Round Mountain]], [[Sierra County, New Mexico]], although the latter locality does not often produce gem grade stones;<ref name="Mindat">[http://www.mindat.org/min-690.html Mindat Red Beryl Page]</ref> and Juab County, Utah. The greatest concentration of gem-grade red beryl comes from the Ruby-Violet Claim in the Wah Wah Mountains of the Thomas range of mid-western Utah, discovered in 1958 by Lamar Hodges, of [[Fillmore, Utah]], while he was prospecting for [[uranium]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Red Emerald History | url=http://www.redemerald.com/history.html | date=2007-11-21 | accessdate=2007-11-21}}</ref> Red beryl has been known to be confused with [[pezzottaite]], a [[caesium]] analog of beryl, that has been found in Madagascar and more recently Afghanistan – although cut gems of the two varieties can be distinguished from their difference in [[refractive index]], and rough crystals can be easily distinguished by differing crystal systems (pezzottaite trigonal, red beryl hexagonal). Synthetic red beryl is also produced.<ref>[http://www.gemstoneslist.com/bixbite.html "Bixbite" – The Gemstone List]</ref>

While gem beryls are ordinarily found in pegmatites and certain metamorphic stones, red beryl occurs in topaz-bearing [[rhyolite]]s. It is formed by crystallizing under low pressure and high temperature from a pneumatolytic phase along fractures or within near-surface [[miarolitic cavities]] of the rhyolite. Associated minerals include bixbyite, [[quartz]], [[orthoclase]], [[topaz]], [[spessartine]], [[pseudobrookite]] and [[hematite]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://geology.utah.gov/surveynotes/gladasked/gladberyl.htm |title=What gemstone is found in Utah that is rarer than diamond and more valuable than gold? |author=Carl Ege |work=Utah Geological Survey |accessdate=July 2, 2011}}</ref>
