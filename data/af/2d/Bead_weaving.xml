The most common bead weaving technique requires two passes of the weft thread. First, an entire row of beads is strung on the weft<space/><link><target>yarn</target><part>thread</part></link>. Then the beads are pressed in between the warp threads. The<space/><link><target>Sewing needle</target><part>needle</part></link><space/>is passed back through the beads above the warp threads to lock the beads into place. Heddle looms were popular near the beginning of the 20th century. They allowed weaving of beads by raising every other thread and inserting strung beads in the shed, the space between the lowered and raised threads. There are still a few Heddle Bead Looms being manufactured today. The most difficult part of loomwork is finishing off the warp threads.</paragraph><paragraph>Although loomed pieces are typically rectangular, it is possible to increase and decrease to produce angular or curvy shapes.<space/><link><target>Fringe (trim)</target><part>Fringe</part></link><space/>can also be added during weaving or before the piece is removed from the loom.</paragraph><paragraph>Bead looms vary in size and are typically made of wood or metal. Usually, a<space/><link><target>comb</target></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>Spring (device)</target><part>spring</part></link><space/>is used to hold the warp threads a bead-width apart. Some looms have roller bars that allow the weaver to produce pieces that are longer than the loom.

All off-loom techniques can be accomplished using a single needle and thread (no warp threads), but some have two-needle variations.Different stitches produce pieces with distinct textures, shapes, and patterns. There are a number of different off-loom bead stitches, including:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>peyote stitch</target></link>, also known as gourd stitch</listitem><listitem><link><target>brick stitch</target></link>, also known as Comanche or Cheyenne stitch</listitem><listitem><link><target>square stitch</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>herringbone stitch</target></link>, also known as Ndebele stitch</listitem><listitem><link><target>Pondo stitch</target></link>, also known as African circle stitch</listitem><listitem><link><target>right-angle weave</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>triangle weave</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>bead netting</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>African helix</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Dutch spiral</target></link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>References</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem>Don Pierce,<space/><italics>Beading on a Loom.</italics><space/>Interweave Press, 1999.
