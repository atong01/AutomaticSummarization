After the game of September 2, the Cubs record was 84-52 with the Mets in second place at 77-55. But then a losing streak began just as a Mets winning streak was beginning. The Cubs lost the final game of a series at Cincinnati, then came home to play the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who would finish in third place). After losing the first two games by scores of 9-2 and 13-4, the Cubs led going into the ninth inning. A win would be a positive springboard since the Cubs were to play a crucial series with the Mets the very next day. But Willie Stargell drilled a 2-out, 2-strike pitch from the Cubs' ace reliever, Phil Regan, onto Sheffield Avenue to tie the score in the top of the ninth. The Cubs would lose 7-5 in extra innings.[6]Burdened by a four-game losing streak, the Cubs traveled to Shea Stadium for a short two-game set. The Mets won both games, and the Cubs left New York with a record of 84-58 just 12 game in front. Disaster followed in Philadelphia, as a 99 loss Phillies team nonetheless defeated the Cubs twice, to extend Chicago's losing streak to eight games. In a key play in the second game, on September 11, Cubs starter Dick Selma threw a surprise pickoff attempt to third baseman Ron Santo, who was nowhere near the bag or the ball. Selma's throwing error opened the gates to a Phillies rally.After that second Philly loss, the Cubs were 84-60 and the Mets had pulled ahead at 85-57. The Mets would not look back. The Cubs' eight-game losing streak finally ended the next day in St. Louis, but the Mets were in the midst of a ten-game winning streak, and the Cubs, wilting from team fatigue, generally deteriorated in all phases of the game.[1] The Mets (who had lost a record 120 games 7 years earlier), would go on to win the World Series. The Cubs, despite a respectable 92-70 record, would be remembered for having lost a remarkable 17 games in the standings to the Mets in the last quarter of the season.</paragraph><heading level='4'>19771979: The June Swoon</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>1977 Chicago Cubs season</arg></template>Following the '69 season, the club posted winning records for the next few seasons, but no playoff action.

The following two seasons also saw the Cubs get off to a fast start, as the team rallied to over 10 games above .500 well into both seasons, only to again wear down and play poorly later on, and ultimately settling back to mediocrity. This trait became known as the &quot;<italics>June Swoon</italics>.&quot; Again, the Cubs' unusually high number of day games is often pointed to as one reason for the team's inconsistent late season play.</paragraph><paragraph>P.K.

Following the &quot;Daily Double,&quot; Matthews, Durham, Cey, Moreland and Davis gave the Cubs an order with no gaps to pitch around.

With his shots in the 9th and 10th innings Wrigley Field erupted and Sandberg set the stage for a comeback win that cemented the Cubs as the team to beat in the East. No one would catch them, except the Padres in the playoffs.</paragraph><paragraph>In early August the Cubs swept the Mets in a 4-game home series that further distanced them from the pack. An infamous Keith Moreland-<link><target>Ed Lynch (baseball)</target><part>Ed Lynch</part></link><space/>fight erupted after Lynch hit Moreland with a pitch, perhaps forgetting Moreland was once a linebacker at the University of Texas. It was the second game of a double header and the Cubs had won the first game in part due to a three run home run by Moreland. After the bench-clearing fight the Cubs won the second game, and the sweep put the Cubs at 6845.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1984, the two leagues, American and National, each had two divisions, East and West. The divisional winners met in a best-of-5 series to advance to the World Series, in a &quot;23&quot; format, first two games were played at the home of the team who did not have home field advantage. Then the last three games were played at the home of the team, with home field advantage. Thus the first two games were played at Wrigley Field and the next three at the home of their opponents, San Diego. A common and unfounded myth is that since Wrigley Field did not have lights at that time the National League decided to give the home field advantage to the winner of the NL West. In fact, home field advantage had rotated between the winners of the East and West since 1969 when the league expanded. In even numbered years, the NL West had home field advantage. In odd numbered years, the NL East had home field advantage. Since the NL East winners had had home field advantage in 1983, the NL West winners were entitled to it.</paragraph><paragraph>The confusion may stem from the fact that Major League Baseball did decide that, should the Cubs make it to the World Series, the American League winner would have home field advantage unless the Cubs hosted home games at an alternate site since the Cubs home field of Wrigley Field did not yet have lights. Rumor was the Cubs could hold home games across town at Comiskey Park, home of the American League's Chicago White Sox. Rather than hold any games in the cross town rival Sox Park, the Cubs made arrangements with the August A. Busch, owner of the St. Louis Cardinals, to use Busch Stadium in St. Louis as the Cubs &quot;home field&quot; for the World Series. This was approved by Major League Baseball and would have enabled the Cubs to host games 1 and 2, along with games 6 and 7 if necessary. At the time home field advantage was rotated between each league. Odd numbered years the AL had home field advantage. Even numbered years the NL had home field advantage. In the 1982 World Series the St. Louis Cardinals of the NL had home field advantage. In the 1983 World Series the Baltimore Orioles of the AL had home field advantage.</paragraph><paragraph>In the<space/><link><target>1984 National League Championship Series</target><part>NLCS</part></link>, the Cubs easily won the first two games at Wrigley Field against the<space/><link><target>1984 San Diego Padres season</target><part>San Diego Padres</part></link>.

With wins of 130 and 42, the Cubs needed to win only one game of the next three in San Diego to make it to the World Series. After being beaten in Game 3 71, the Cubs lost Game 4 when Smith, with the game tied 55, allowed a game-winning home run to Garvey in the bottom of the ninth inning. In Game 5 the Cubs took a 30 lead into the 6th inning, and a 32 lead into the seventh with Sutcliffe (who won the<space/><link><target>Cy Young Award</target></link><space/>that year) still on the mound. Then, Leon Durham had a sharp grounder go under his glove.

After splitting the first two games at home, the Cubs headed to the Bay Area, where despite holding a lead at some point in each of the next three games, bullpen meltdowns and managerial blunders ultimately led to three straight losses. The Cubs couldn't overcome the efforts of Will Clark, whose home run off Maddux, just after a managerial visit to the mound, led Maddux to think Clark knew what pitch was coming. Afterward, Maddux would speak into his glove during any mound conversation, beginning what is a norm today. Mark Grace was 1117 in the series with 8 RBI.

His torrid strikeout numbers earned Wood the nickname<space/><italics>&quot;Kid K,&quot;</italics><space/>and ultimately earned him the 1998<space/><link><target>NL Rookie of the Year</target></link><space/>award. Sosa caught fire in June, hitting a major league record 20 home runs in the month, and his home run race with Cardinals slugger<space/><link><target>Mark McGwire</target></link><space/>transformed the pair into international superstars in a matter of weeks.

Apparently handcuffed by the Tribune's bankruptcy and the sale of the club to the Ricketts family, the Cubs' quest for a NL Central 3-peat started with notice that there would be less invested into contracts than in previous years. Chicago engaged St. Louis in a see-saw battle for first place into August 2009, but the Cardinals played to a torrid 206 pace that month, designating their rivals to battle in the Wild Card race, from which they were eliminated in the season's final week. The Cubs were plagued by injuries in 2009, and were only able to field their Opening Day starting lineup three times the entire season. Third baseman Aramis Ramrez injured his throwing shoulder in an early May game against the Milwaukee Brewers, sidelining him until early July and forcing journeyman players like<space/><link><target>Mike Fontenot</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Aaron Miles</target></link><space/>into more prominent roles. Additionally, key players like Derrek Lee (who still managed to hit .306 with 35 HR and 111 RBI that season), Alfonso Soriano and Geovany Soto also nursed nagging injuries. The Cubs posted a winning record (8378) for the third consecutive season, the first time the club had done so since 1972, and a new era of ownership under the Ricketts' family was approved by MLB owners in early October.</paragraph><heading level='4'>The decline and rebuild</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Starlin Castro 09-05-2010.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>upright</part><part>left</part><part>Starlin Castro during his 2010 rookie season.</part><trail>Rookie</trail></link><space/><link><target>Starlin Castro</target></link><space/>debuted in early May (2010) as the starting shortstop.
