In contrast to the approach of<space/><link><target>cognitive science</target></link>, behaviorism does not accept private events such as thinking, perceptions, and unobservable emotions as causes of an organism's behavior. However, in contrast to methodological behaviorism, Skinner's radical behaviorism did accept thoughts, emotions, and other &quot;private events&quot; as responses subject to the same rules as overt behavior. In his words:<space/><extension extension_name='blockquote'><preblock><preline>The position can be stated as follows: what is felt or introspectively observed is not some nonphysical world of<space/><link><target>consciousness</target></link>, mind, or mental life but the observer's own body. This does not mean, as I shall show later, that introspection is a kind of psychological research, nor does it mean (and this is the heart of the argument) that what are felt or introspectively observed are the causes of the behavior. An organism behaves as it does because of its current structure, but most of this is out of reach of introspection. At the moment we must content ourselves, as the methodological behaviorist insists, with a person's genetic and environment histories. What are introspectively observed are certain collateral products of those histories.</preline></preblock><paragraph><xhtml:br></xhtml:br>...<xhtml:br></xhtml:br>In this way we repair the major damage wrought by<space/><link><target>mentalism (disambiguation)</target><part>mentalism</part></link>.

For twenty five hundred years people have been preoccupied with feelings and mental life, but only recently has any interest been shown in a more precise analysis of the role of the environment. Ignorance of that role led in the first place to mental fictions, and it has been perpetuated by the explanatory practices to which they gave rise.<extension extension_name='ref'><italics>ibid</italics>. pp. 1820 of the paperback edition which had the redacted typo s/it/is/.</extension></paragraph></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Theoretical structure</heading><paragraph>Skinner's behavioral theory was largely set forth in his first book,<space/><italics>Behavior of Organisms</italics>.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last1">Skinner</arg><arg name="first1">B.F.</arg><arg name="title">Behavior of Organisms</arg><arg name="date">1938</arg><arg name="publisher">Appleton-Century-Crofts</arg><arg name="location">New York</arg></template></extension><space/>Here he gave a systematic description of the manner in which environmental variables control behavior.

They are strengthened through operant conditioning, sometimes called &quot;instrumental conditioning&quot;, in which the occurrence of a response yields a reinforcer. Respondents might be measured by their latency or strength, operants by their rate. Both of these sorts of behavior had already been studied experimentally, for example, respondents by Pavlov<space/><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last1">Pavlov</arg><arg name="first1">I.

J.</extension><space/>and was one of the first accounts to bring them under one roof.</paragraph><paragraph>The idea that behavior is strengthened or weakened by its consequences raises several questions. Among the most important are these: (1) Operant responses are strengthened by reinforcement, but where do they come from in the first place? (2) Once it is in the organism's repertoire, how is a response directed or controlled? (3) How can very complex and seemingly novel behaviors be explained?</paragraph><heading level='4'>The origin of operant behavior</heading><paragraph>Skinner's answer to the first question was very much like Darwin's answer to the question of the origin of a &quot;new&quot; bodily structure, namely, variation and selection. Similarly, the behavior of an individual varies from moment to moment; a variation that is followed by reinforcement is strengthened and becomes prominent in that individual's behavioral repertoire. &quot;Shaping&quot; was Skinner's term for the gradual modification of behavior by the reinforcement of desired variations. As discussed later in this article, Skinner believed that &quot;superstitious&quot; behavior can arise when a response happens to be followed by reinforcement to which it is actually unrelated.</paragraph><heading level='4'>The control of operant behavior</heading><paragraph>The second question, &quot;how is operant behavior controlled?&quot; arises because, to begin with, the behavior is &quot;emitted&quot; without reference to any particular stimulus. Skinner answered this question by saying that a stimulus comes to control an operant if it is present when the response is reinforced and absent when it is not. For example, if lever-pressing only brings food when a light is on, a rat, or a child, will learn to press the lever only when the light is on. Skinner summarized this relationship by saying that a discriminative stimulus (e.g. light) sets the occasion for the reinforcement (food) of the operant (lever-press). This &quot;three-term contingency&quot; (stimulus-response-reinforcer) is one of Skinner's most important concepts, and sets his theory apart from theories that use only pair-wise associations.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Jenkins"></extension></paragraph><heading level='4'>Explaining complex behavior</heading><paragraph>Most behavior of humans cannot easily be described in terms of individual responses reinforced one by one, and Skinner devoted a great deal of effort to the problem of behavioral complexity. Some complex behavior can be seen as a sequence of relatively simple responses, and here Skinner invoked the idea of &quot;chaining&quot;. Chaining is based on the fact, experimentally demonstrated, that a discriminative stimulus not only sets the occasion for subsequent behavior, but it can also reinforce a behavior that precedes it. That is, a discriminative stimulus is also a &quot;conditioned reinforcer&quot;. For example, the light that sets the occasion for lever pressing may be used to reinforce &quot;turning around&quot; in the presence of a noise. This results in the sequence &quot;noise - turn-around - light - press lever - food&quot;. Much longer chains can be built by adding more stimuli and responses.</paragraph><paragraph>However, Skinner recognized that a great deal of behavior, especially human behavior, cannot be accounted for by gradual shaping or the construction of response sequences.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Contingencies">Skinner, B. F.(1966) Contingencies of Reinforcement, New York; Appleton-Century-Crofts. reprinted 2013, B. F. Skinner Foundation.</extension><space/>Complex behavior often appears suddenly in its final form, as when a person first finds his way to the elevator by following instructions given at the front desk. To account for such behavior Skinner introduced the concept of rule-governed behavior. First, relatively simple behaviors come under the control of verbal stimuli: the child learns to &quot;jump&quot;, &quot;open the book&quot;, and so on. After a large number of responses come under such verbal control, a sequence of verbal stimuli can evoke an almost unlimited variety of complex responses.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Contingencies"></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Reinforcement</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Reinforcement</arg></template>Reinforcement, a key concept of<space/><link><target>behaviorism</target></link>, is the primary process that shapes and controls behavior, and occurs in two ways, &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot;. In The Behavior of Organisms (1938), Skinner defined &quot;negative reinforcement&quot; to be synonymous with<space/><link><target>punishment</target></link>, that is, the presentation of an aversive stimulus. Subsequently, in Science and Human Behavior (1953), Skinner redefined negative reinforcement. In what has now become the standard set of definitions, positive reinforcement is the strengthening of behavior by the occurrence of some event (e.g., praise after some behavior is performed), whereas negative reinforcement is the strengthening of behavior by the removal or avoidance of some aversive event (e.g., opening and raising an umbrella over your head on a rainy day is reinforced by the cessation of rain falling on you).</paragraph><paragraph>Both types of reinforcement strengthen behavior, or increase the probability of a behavior reoccurring; the difference is in whether the reinforcing event is something applied (positive reinforcement) or something removed or avoided (negative reinforcement). Punishment is the application of an aversive stimulus/event (positive punishment or punishment by contingent stimulation) or the removal of a desirable stimulus (negative punishment or punishment by contingent withdrawal). Though punishment is often used to suppress behavior, Skinner argued that this suppression is temporary and has a number of other, often unwanted, consequences.<extension extension_name='ref'>Skinner, B.

It was invented by Skinner while he was a graduate student at<space/><link><target>Harvard University</target></link>, where he received the doctorate in 1931. As used by Skinner, the box had a lever (for rats) or a disk in one wall (for pigeons). A press on this &quot;manipulandum&quot; could deliver food to the animal through an opening in the wall, and responses reinforced in this way increased in frequency. By controlling this reinforcement together with discriminative stimuli such as lights and tones, or punishments such as electric shocks, experimenters have used the operant box to study a wide variety of topics, including schedules of reinforcement, discriminative control, delayed response (&quot;memory&quot;), punishment, and so on. By channeling research in these directions, the operant conditioning chamber has had a huge influence on course of research in animal learning and its applications. It enabled great progress on problems that could be studied by the measuring the rate, probability, or force of a simple, repeatable response. However, it discouraged the study of behavioral processes not easily conceptualized in such terms - spatial learning, in particular, which is now studied in quite different ways, for example by the use of the<space/><link><target>water maze</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Jenkins"></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Cumulative recorder</heading><paragraph>The cumulative recorder makes a pen-and-ink record of simple repeated responses. Skinner designed it for use with the<space/><link><target>Operant chamber</target></link><space/>as a convenient way to record and view the rate of responses such as a lever press or a key peck. In this device a sheet of paper gradually unrolls over a cylinder. Each response steps a small pen across the paper, starting at one edge; when the pen reaches the other edge, it quickly resets to the initial side. The slope of the resulting ink line graphically displays the rate of the response; for example rapid responses yield a steeply sloping line on the paper, slow responding yields a line of low slope. The cumulative recorder was a key tool used by Skinner in his analysis of behavior, and it was very widely adopted by other experimenters, gradually falling out of use with the advent of the laboratory computer. Skinner's major experimental exploration of response rates, presented in his book with C. B.

F. and Holland, J. &quot;The Analysis of Behavior: A Program for Self Instruction&quot;, 1961, p.387</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Teaching machines, though perhaps rudimentary, were not rigid instruments of instruction. They could be adjusted and improved based upon the students performance. For example, if a student made many incorrect responses, the machine could be reprogrammed to provide less advanced prompts or questions- the idea being that students acquire behaviors most efficiently if they make few errors. Multiple-choice formats were not best suited for teaching machines because they tended to increase student mistakes and the contingencies of reinforcement were relatively uncontrolled.</paragraph><paragraph>Not only useful in teaching explicit skills, machines could also promote the development of a repertoire of behaviors that Skinner called self-management. Effective self-management means attending to stimuli appropriate to a task, avoiding distractions, reducing the opportunity of reward for competing behaviors, and so on. For example, machines encourage students to pay attention before receiving a reward. Skinner contrasted this with the common classroom practice of initially capturing students attention (e.g., with a lively video) and delivering a reward (e.g., entertainment) before the students have actually performed any relevant behavior. This practice fails to reinforce correct behavior and actually counters the development of self-management.</paragraph><paragraph>Skinner pioneered the use of teaching machines in the classroom, especially at the primary level.

Skinner argued that education has two major purposes: (1) to teach repertoires of both verbal and nonverbal behavior; and (2) to interest students in learning. He recommended bringing students behavior under appropriate control by providing reinforcement only in the presence of stimuli relevant to the learning task. Because he believed that human behavior can be affected by small consequences, something as simple as the opportunity to move forward after completing one stage of an activity can be an effective reinforcer (Skinner, 1961, p.&amp;nbsp;380). Skinner was convinced that, to learn, a student must engage in behavior, and not just passively receive information. (Skinner, 1961, p.&amp;nbsp;389).</paragraph><paragraph>Skinner believed that effective teaching must be based on positive reinforcement which is, he argued, more effective at changing and establishing behavior than punishment. He suggested that the main thing people learn from being punished is how to avoid punishment. For example, if a child is forced to practice playing an instrument, the child comes to associate practicing with punishment and thus learns to hate and avoid practicing the instrument. This view had obvious implications for the then widespread practice of<space/><link><target>rote learning</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>school discipline</target><part>punitive discipline</part></link><space/>in education.

He discovered that the pigeons associated the delivery of the food with whatever chance actions they had been performing as it was delivered, and that they subsequently continued to perform these same actions.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://oyc.yale.edu/economics/financial-markets/content/sessions/session-8-human-foibles-fraud-manipulation-and'>ECON 252, Lecture 8</link><space/>by Professor Robert Schiller at Yale University</extension></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>quote</target><arg name="One bird was conditioned to turn counter-clockwise about the cage, making two or three turns between reinforcements.

The bird behaves as if there were a causal relation between its behavior and the presentation of food, although such a relation is lacking. There are many analogies in human behavior. Rituals for changing one's fortune at cards are good examples. A few accidental connections between a ritual and favorable consequences suffice to set up and maintain the behavior in spite of many unreinforced instances. The bowler who has released a ball down the alley but continues to behave as if she were controlling it by twisting and turning her arm and shoulder is another case in point. These behaviors have, of course, no real effect upon one's luck or upon a ball half way down an alley, just as in the present case the food would appear as often if the pigeon did nothingâ€”or, more strictly speaking, did something else.<ref name">superstition /></arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Modern behavioral psychologists have disputed Skinner's &quot;superstition&quot; explanation for the behaviors he recorded. Subsequent research (e.g. Staddon and Simmelhag, 1971), while finding similar behavior, failed to find support for Skinner's &quot;adventitious reinforcement&quot; explanation for it. By looking at the timing of different behaviors within the interval, Staddon and Simmelhag were able to distinguish two classes of behavior: the<space/><italics>terminal response</italics>, which occurred in anticipation of food, and<space/><italics>interim responses</italics>, that occurred earlier in the interfood interval and were rarely contiguous with food. Terminal responses seem to reflect classical (as opposed to operant) conditioning, rather than adventitious reinforcement, guided by a process like that observed in 1968 by Brown and Jenkins in their &quot;autoshaping&quot; procedures. The causation of interim activities (such as the schedule-induced<space/><link><target>polydipsia</target></link><space/>seen in a similar situation with rats) also cannot be traced to adventitious reinforcement and its details are still obscure (Staddon, 1977).<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;amp;artid=1348192'>Timberlake &amp; Lucas, (1985) &quot;JEAB&quot;</link></extension></paragraph><paragraph>This experiment was also repeated on humans, in a less controlled manner, on the popular British TV series<space/><italics><link><target>Trick or Treat (TV series)</target><part>Trick or Treat</part></link></italics>, leading to similar conclusions to those of Skinner.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.channel4.com/programmes/derren-brown-trick-or-treat/4od#3193912<space/></arg><arg name="title">Derren Brown: Trick or Treat - 4oD<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Channel 4<space/></arg><arg name="date"><space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2012-11-07</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Quotations</heading><paragraph>&quot;I do not admire myself as a person.
