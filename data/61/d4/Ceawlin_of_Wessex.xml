The first event in West Saxon history, the date of which can be regarded as reasonably certain, is the baptism of<space/><link><target>Cynegils</target></link>, which occurred in the late 630s, perhaps as late as 640. The<space/><italics>Chronicle</italics><space/>dates Cerdic's arrival to 495, but adding up the lengths of the reigns as given in the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List, leads to the conclusion that Cerdic's reign might have started in 532, a difference of 37 years. Neither 495 nor 532 may be treated as reliable, however, the latter date relies on the presumption that the Regnal List is correct in presenting the Kings of Wessex as having succeeded one another, with no omitted kings, no<space/><link><target>Joint monarchs</target><part>joint kingship</part><trail>s</trail></link>, and that the durations of the reigns are correct as given.

Subgroupings of different West Saxon lineages give the impression of separate groups, of which Ceawlin's line is one.

The lack of gaps between the overlordships of the later bretwaldas has been used to make an argument for Ceawlin's dates matching the later entries in the<space/><italics>Chronicle</italics><space/>with reasonable accuracy.

Ceawlin defeated thelberht in 568 according to the<space/><italics>Chronicle</italics>. thelberht's dates are a matter of debate, but recent scholarly consensus has his reign starting no earlier than 580. The 568 date for the battle at Wibbandun is thought to be unlikely because of the assertion in various versions of the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List that Ceawlin's reign lasted either seven or seventeen years. If this battle is placed near the year 590, before thelberht has established himself as a powerful king, then the subsequent annals relating to Ceawlin's defeat and death may be reasonably close to the correct date. In any case, the battle with thelberht is unlikely to have been more than a few years on either side of 590.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Kirby_56_2">The argument is made in more detail in Kirby,<space/><italics>Earliest English Kings</italics>, p. 56.
