Early works such as<space/><italics>Portrait of a Man</italics><space/>(1929) show Alston's detailed and realistic style depicted through<space/><link><target>pastel</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and charcoals, inspired by the style of<space/><link><target>Winold Reiss</target></link>. In his<space/><italics>Girl in a Red Dress</italics><space/>(1934) and<space/><italics>The Blue Shirt</italics><space/>(1935), he used modern and innovative techniques for his portraits of young individuals in Harlem.<space/><italics>Blue Shirt</italics><space/>is thought to be a portrait of Jacob Lawrence. During this time he also created<space/><italics>Man Seated with Travel Bag</italics><space/>(c. 193840), showing the seedy and bleak environment, contrasting with work like the racially charged<space/><italics>Vaudeville</italics><space/>(c. 1930) and its<space/><link><target>caricature</target></link><space/>style of a man in<space/><link><target>blackface</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Wardlaw"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Inspired from his trip south, Alston began his &quot;family series&quot; in the 1940s.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Wardlaw"></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="Pierce"></extension><space/>Intensity and angularity come through in the faces of the youth in his portraits<space/><italics>Untitled (Portrait of a Girl)</italics><space/>and<space/><italics>Untitled (Portrait of a Boy)</italics>.

Later family portraits show Alston's exploration of<space/><link><target>religious symbolism</target></link>, color, form and space. His family group portraits are often faceless, which Alston states is the way that white America views blacks. Paintings such as<space/><italics>Family</italics><space/>(1955) show a woman seated and a man standing with two children the parents seem almost solemn while the children are described as hopeful and with a use of color made famous by<space/><link><target>Czanne</target></link>. In<space/><italics>Family Group</italics><space/>(c. 1950) Alston's use of gray and<space/><link><target>ochre</target></link><space/>tones brings together the parents and son as if one with geometric patterns connecting them together as if a<space/><link><target>puzzle</target></link>. The simplicity of the look, style and emotion upon the family is reflective and probably inspired by Alston's trip south. His work during this time has been described as being &quot;characterized by his reductive use of form combined with a sun-hued&quot;. During this time he also started to experiment with<space/><link><target>ink and wash painting</target></link><space/>seen in work like<space/><italics>Portrait of a Woman</italics><space/>(1955) as well as creating portraits to illustrate the music surrounding him in Harlem.<space/><italics>Blues Singer #4</italics><space/>shows a female singer on stage with a white flower on her shoulder and a bold red dress, reminiscent of<space/><link><target>Ella Fitzgerald</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Wardlaw"></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="Pierce"></extension><space/><italics>Girl in a Red Dress</italics><space/>is thought to may be<space/><link><target>Bessie Smith</target></link>, for whom he drew many times when she was recording and performing.
