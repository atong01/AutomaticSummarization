The thousand yard rushing season by rookie running back<space/><link><target>Jamal Lewis</target></link><space/>combined with the stout Ravens defense kept Baltimore competitive in games even when the offense struggled.

With the defeat of the Colts in the Wildcard round, the Ravens were primed to face the Denver Broncos at Mile High Stadium in Denver in the AFC divisional round. Labeled as huge underdogs coming into the game, especially considering the previous thrashing that was dealt against them by the aforementioned Denver Broncos in a home loss at M&amp;T Bank Stadium on December 16th, 2012. The Ravens, however, shocked the sports world as well as many analysts and fans of football alike, by defeating the Peyton Manning led<space/><link><target>Denver Broncos</target></link><space/>in the second overtime, 3835, in a spectacular divisional round matchup on Saturday, January 12, 2013. It looked as though they had lost the game as they got the ball with just over a minute left on their own twenty-three-yard line, but a clutch 70-yard touchdown pass, known colloquially as &quot;The<space/><link><target>Mile High Miracle</target></link>&quot;, from<space/><link><target>Joe Flacco</target></link><space/>to<space/><link><target>Jacoby Jones</target></link><space/>sent the game to overtime. In overtime, an interception of<space/><link><target>Peyton Manning</target></link><space/>by<space/><link><target>Corey Graham</target></link><space/>(who had already returned one interception for a touchdown earlier in the game) put the Ravens in field position to kick the winning field goal. The win vaulted the Ravens to play for the AFC Conference Championship against the<space/><link><target>New England Patriots</target></link><space/>on Sunday, January 20, 2013; the Ravens won 2813 after shutting out<space/><link><target>Tom Brady</target></link><space/>and the New England offense in the second half, completely dismantling any offensive attempt(s) thereafter. The win placed the Ravens in<space/><link><target>Super Bowl XLVII</target></link><space/>against the<space/><link><target>San Francisco 49ers</target></link><space/>on February 3, 2013. The Ravens opened the game in thrilling fashion as their opening drive of the game ended with a touchdown pass from Super Bowl MVP Joe Flacco to wide receiver Anquan Boldin. Flacco threw two second-quarter touchdown passes as Baltimore took a 21-6 lead into halftime. After halftime, the Ravens received the kickoff from the 49ers, and Jacoby Jones returned the kickoff for a record setting 108-yard touchdown. However, soon after the Jacoby Jones touchdown, a power-outage at the stadium led to a 34-minute stoppage in play due to inefficiencies in lighting, on-field visibility, and electrical equipment. After power was restored, the 49ers regained composure and came storming back, scoring 17 unanswered points. The 49ers had a final chance to take the lead late in the game, but a goal-line stand by the Ravens with less than two minutes remaining sealed the contest as the Baltimore Ravens won Super Bowl XLVII 3431. Super Bowl XLVII has also been dubbed the &quot;Harbaugh Bowl&quot; since the 49ers were coached by<space/><link><target>Jim Harbaugh</target></link>, the brother of Ravens coach<space/><link><target>John Harbaugh</target></link>.The Ravens returned to Baltimore to celebrate with their fans on Tuesday, February 5.

Free agent linebacker<space/><link><target>Paul Kruger (American football)</target><part>Paul Kruger</part></link><space/>signed with the Cleveland Browns, linebacker<space/><link><target>Dannell Ellerbe</target></link><space/>signed with the Miami Dolphins, cornerback<space/><link><target>Cary Williams</target></link><space/>signed with the Philadelphia Eagles, and safety<space/><link><target>Ed Reed</target></link><space/>signed with the Houston Texans. Additionally, safety<space/><link><target>Bernard Pollard</target></link><space/>was released due to salary cap reasons and later signed with the Tennessee Titans. Wide receiver<space/><link><target>Anquan Boldin</target></link><space/>was traded to the San Francisco 49ers for a sixth-round draft pick. The Ravens made some offseason additions as well, signing defensive linemen<space/><link><target>Chris Canty (defensive lineman)</target><part>Chris Canty</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Marcus Spears (defensive end)</target><part>Marcus Spears</part></link><space/>as well as signing key free agent linebacker<space/><link><target>Elvis Dumervil</target></link><space/>and safety<space/><link><target>Michael Huff</target></link>. As well as drafting first round pick Safety Matt Elam, second round pick Linebacker Arthur Brown, third round pick Defensive Tackle Brandon Williams, and fourth round pick &quot;hybrid&quot; Fullback Kyle Juszczyk among others. Unfortunately during training camp the Ravens lost another key player, tight-end<space/><link><target>Dennis Pitta</target></link><space/>for the entire season (who was primed for an even greater 2013 season). During a routine drill, he suffered a dislocated/fractured hip after colliding with another teammate (James Ihedigbo) at the back of the end zone. In response, during August, they re-signed wide receiver<space/><link><target>Brandon Stokley</target></link>, whom they drafted in 1999, and signed former Colts and<space/><link><target>Tampa Bay Buccaneers</target></link><space/>tight end,<space/><link><target>Dallas Clark</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>The season started out badly for the Ravens, as they were defeated by the Broncos in their season opener, thus becoming the second Super Bowl Champion to lose the NFL kickoff game. This meant that they held the first loss of the season, breaking a record for the most points allowed by the defense and ending a 75-game streak of holding a .500 or better win-loss ratio. They would rebound in Week 2 with a 146 victory over their division rival, the<space/><link><target>Cleveland Browns</target></link>. The following week the Ravens took on the unbeaten Houston Texans at home; this time they would face a familiar face in safety Ed Reed, who played for them for 12 seasons. After a strong showing by the defense, which only allowed 9 points, the Ravens clobbered the Texans 309. In Week 4, the Ravens struggled against the Buffalo Bills as Joe Flacco threw a career high 5 interceptions. The Ravens fell to the Bills 2320. At 22, the Ravens hit the road to Miami to take on the Dolphins. Although they faced a 136 deficit at halftime, the offense rallied to score 17 consecutive points giving the Ravens a 2313 lead in the 4th quarter. However, Miami answered right back with 10 points of their own, tying the game at 23 with 8:03 left. Justin Tucker then kicked a 44-yard field goal with 1:42 left to give the Ravens a 2623 lead. After the Dolphins comeback attempt stalled, Caleb Sturgis missed a field goal late, giving the Ravens the win. The Ravens then returned home to take on the Green Bay Packers. The offense struggled early, as the Ravens were shut out in the first half. Trailing 16-3 in the 4th quarter Joe Flacco found Jacoby Jones in the end zone for an 11-yard touchdown pass to reduce the deficit to 16-10. After another Packers field goal, the Ravens faced a 19-10 deficit with 4:17 remaining. Joe Flacco was able to find Dallas Clark in the end zone for an 18-yard touchdown pass, making it 19-17. However, the Packers were able to seal the victory by picking up first downs and running out the clock. The following week, the Ravens would fall to their rivals, the Pittsburgh Steelers 16-19 on a last second field goal by Steelers kicker<space/><link><target>Shaun Suisham</target></link>. The following week, the Ravens would lose 18-24 to the Cleveland Browns for the first time under John Harbaugh. Facing the probable end to their season at that point, the Ravens would snap their three-game skid with a win against their first-place division rivals, the<space/><link><target>2013 Cincinnati Bengals season</target><part>Cincinnati Bengals</part></link><space/>20-17 in overtime. The following week, the Ravens were scheduled to face the<space/><link><target>Chicago Bears</target></link>. The game was delayed for two hours due to a heavy storm.

On<space/><link><target>NFL on Thanksgiving Day</target><part>Thanksgiving</part></link>, the Ravens would defeat the Steelers 22-20 at home, avenging their Week 7 loss to them, and improving to 2-0 on Thanksgiving games. In Week 14 the Ravens would beat the Minnesota Vikings 26-29. In Week 15, the Ravens would beat the Detroit Lions at Ford Field 18-16 off Justin Tucker's 6 field goals, including a 61-yarder that proved to be the game-clinching score followed by a<space/><link><target>Matthew Stafford</target></link><space/>interception. In Week 16 the Ravens would lose at home to the New England Patriots 41-7 making it the second worst home loss in Ravens history. In Week 17 the Ravens faced the Cincinnati Bengals. The defense forced 4 interceptions on Andy Dalton but it wasn't enough for the offense to take advantage of. Baltimore tied the game 17-17 in the second half, but surrendered 17 unanswered points to the Bengals, thus ending their season at 8-8 and missing the playoffs for the first time since 2007.</paragraph><heading level='4'>2014</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>2014 Baltimore Ravens season</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>On January 27, 2014, the Ravens hired former<space/><link><target>Houston Texans</target></link><space/>head coach<space/><link><target>Gary Kubiak</target></link><space/>to be their new offensive coordinator after<space/><link><target>Jim Caldwell (American football)</target><part>Jim Caldwell</part></link><space/>accepted the new available head coaching job with the<space/><link><target>Detroit Lions</target></link>.

The Baltimore Ravens terminated Rice's contract as a result, and was later indefinitely suspended by the NFL.

On the Sunday after the Thursday night victory, the Ravens headed to Cleveland for a third straight division game with the Browns. In a tough fought game, the Baltimore Ravens won 23-21 with a game-winning 32-yard field goal by Justin Tucker as time expired. On September 28, the Ravens hosted the Carolina Panthers, and in a fabulous offensive performance, defeated the Carolina Panthers 38-10; with this victory the Ravens have defeated every visiting franchise at least once at home (and at M&amp;T Bank Stadium). The very next week, the Ravens traveled to Indianapolis to play the Colts in Week 5. However, three turnovers and QB<space/><link><target>Joe Flacco</target></link><space/>being sacked four times resulted in a 20-13 loss, breaking the 3-2 Ravens win streak. In week 6, Joe Flacco led the Ravens to an impressive 48-17 victory over the<space/><link><target>Tampa Bay Buccaneers</target></link>. Flacco threw 5 touchdown passes in the first 16:03 of the game, an NFL record, to put the contest out of reach early in the 2nd quarter. In Week 7, the Ravens hosted the<space/><link><target>Atlanta Falcons</target></link><space/>and won 29-7. The next week, the Ravens traveled to Cincinnati for a key divisional game. Both defenses forced key turnovers in a game that no passing touchdowns were thrown. In the waning seconds of the 4th quarter as Baltimore trailed, Flacco threw an 80-yard touchdown pass to Steve Smith that seemingly won the game. However, Smith was controversially called for offensive pass interference on Bengals safety<space/><link><target>George Iloka</target></link>, who looked to have flopped, that negated the touchdown. The Ravens ended up losing 27-24 and being swept by the Bengals for the first time since 2009. The next week, the Ravens traveled to Pittsburgh for another key division match. Two unfortunate turnovers led to an offensive surge by the Steelers and Ben Roethlisberger throwing six touchdowns on an injury riddled Baltimore secondary, humbling the Ravens 43-23. Afterwards, the Ravens made some changes to their secondary, cutting cornerbacks<space/><link><target>Chykie Brown</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Dominique Franks</target></link>, and signing former Ravens cornerback<space/><link><target>Danny Gorrer</target></link>. The Ravens hosted the Tennessee Titans in Week 10, winning 21-7, and going into their bye week 6-4.

Running back Justin Forsett had a career night, running for 182 yards and 2 touchdowns, as the Ravens won 34-27, improving their record to 7-4 and a 4-0 sweep of the NFC south. In Week 13 against the<space/><link><target>San Diego Chargers</target></link>, the Ravens loss in heartbreaking fashion 34-33, allowing the Chargers to score 21 points in the 4th quarter. The Ravens rebounded the next week against the Miami Dolphins winning 27-10, and the defense sacking Dolphins quarterback<space/><link><target>Ryan Tannehill</target></link><space/>six times. The defense was even more dominant against the Jacksonville Jaguars in a 20-12 win, sacking rookie quarterback<space/><link><target>Blake Bortles</target></link><space/>eight times. In Week 16, the Ravens traveled to Houston to take on the Texans. In one of Joe Flacco's worst performances, the offense sputtered against the Houston defense and Flacco threw three interceptions, including two inside the Ravens own 20 yard line, falling to the Texans 25-13. With their playoff chances and season hanging in the balance, the Ravens took on the Browns in Week 17 at home. After three quarters had gone by and down 10-3, Joe Flacco led the Ravens on a comeback scoring 17 unanswered points in the 4th quarter, winning 20-10. With the win, and the Kansas City Chiefs defeating the San Diego Chargers, the Ravens clinched their sixth playoff berth in seven seasons, and the first since winning Super Bowl XLVII.</paragraph><paragraph>In the wildcard playoff game, the Ravens won 30-17 against their divisional rivals, the<space/><link><target>2014 Pittsburgh Steelers season</target><part>Pittsburgh Steelers</part></link>, at<space/><link><target>Heinz Field</target></link>.

This is due to the fact that the then-Colts owner, Robert Irsay, while publicly still in negotiations with the city for the stadium improvements that he was demanding, snuck the Colts out of Baltimore in the middle of the night to take them to Indianapolis. During Ravens home games the scoreboard lists the away team simply as &quot;Away&quot; or &quot;Indy&quot; rather than the team name that is traditionally used for the visiting opponent. The PA announcer will also refer to the Colts as the Indianapolis Professional Football Team; although on January 6, 2013 the scoreboard at the playoff game between the Baltimore Ravens and Indianapolis Colts at M&amp;T Bank Stadium listed the away team as &quot;Colts&quot;.

The rivalry reached a new level of friction with this, the second career playoff game between the two clubs. The Ravens clawed to a 2016 lead in the fourth quarter but Patriots quarterback<space/><link><target>Tom Brady</target></link><space/>dove into the end zone to make the score 2320 with around 11 minutes remaining; this proved to be the winning touchdown.

Unlike the previous meeting, the Ravens put up a strong offensive performance, leading by 14 points twice in the game. However, Tom Brady would bring the Patriots back by attacking the Ravens vulnerable secondary and taking a 35-31 lead late in the 4th quarter. Joe Flacco would drive to the Patriots side of the field with under two minutes to play in regulation. However a key interception by Flacco due to a misplay on the ball by Torrey Smith essentially sealed the game in the Patriots favor to send them to the AFC Championship.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Logo controversy</heading><paragraph><link><target>Image:Bwings.png</target><part>right</part><part>thumb</part><part>Baltimore Ravens logo from 1996 to 1998</part></link><link><target>Image:RavensdrawingBouchat.png</target><part>right</part><part>frame</part><part>Bouchat's original sketch</part></link>The team's first helmet logo, used from 1996 through 1998, featured raven wings outspread from a shield displaying a letter<space/><italics>B</italics><space/>framed by the word<space/><italics>Ravens</italics><space/>overhead and a<space/><link><target>cross bottony</target></link><space/>underneath.
