When used by academics, an arbitrage is a transaction that involves no negative<space/><link><target>cash flow</target></link><space/>at any probabilistic or temporal state and a positive cash flow in at least one state; in simple terms, it is the possibility of a risk-free profit after transaction costs.

By doing so, a more accurate price will be obtained than if the price is calculated with a present value pricing approach. Arbitrage-free pricing is used for bond valuation and used to detect arbitrage opportunities for investors.</paragraph><paragraph>For purpose of valuing the price of a bond its cash flows can each be thought of as packets of incremental cash flows with a large packet upon maturity, being the principal. Since the cash flows are dispersed throughout future periods they must be discounted back to the present. In the present value approach, the cash flows are discounted with one discount rate to find the price of the bond. In arbitrage-free pricing, multiple discount rates are used.</paragraph><paragraph>The present value approach assumes that the yield of the bond will stay the same until maturity. This is a simplified model because interest rates may fluctuate in the future, which in turn affects the yield on the bond. The discount rate may be different for each of the cash flows for this reason. Each cash flow can be considered a zero-coupon instrument that pays one payment upon maturity. The discount rates used should be the rates of multiple zero-coupon bonds with maturity dates same as each cash flow and similar risk as the instrument being valued. By using multiple discount rates the arbitrage-free price will be the sum of the<space/><link><target>discounted cash flow</target><trail>s</trail></link>. Arbitrage-free price refers to the price at which no price arbitrage is possible.</paragraph><paragraph>The ideas of using multiple discount rates obtained from zero-coupon bonds and discount a similar bonds cash flow to find its price is derived from the yield curve. The yield curve is a curve of the yields of the same bond with different maturities. This curve can be used to view trends in the markets expectations of how interest rates will move in the future. In arbitrage-free pricing of a bond a yield curve of similar zero-coupon bonds with different maturities is created. If the curve were to be created with Treasury securities of different maturities they would be stripped of their coupon payments through bootstrapping. This is to transform the bonds into zero-coupon bonds. The yield of these zero-coupon bonds would then be plotted on a diagram with time on the x-axis and yield on the y-axis.</paragraph><paragraph>Since the yield curve in a way displays the markets expectations on how yields and interest rates may move, the arbitrage-free pricing approach is more realistic than using only one discount rate. With this, investors can use this approach to value bonds and find mismatches in prices, resulting in an arbitrage opportunity. If a bond valued with the arbitrage-free pricing approach turns out to be priced higher in the market an investor could have such an opportunity:</paragraph><list type='numbered'><listitem>Investor goes short the bond at price at time t<xhtml:sub>1</xhtml:sub>.<space/></listitem><listitem>Investor goes long the zero-coupon bonds making up the related yield curve and strip and sell any coupon payments at t<xhtml:sub>1</xhtml:sub>.<space/></listitem><listitem>As t&gt;t<xhtml:sub>1</xhtml:sub><space/>the price spread between the prices will decrease.</listitem><listitem>At maturity the prices will converge and be equal.

The transactions must occur<space/><italics>simultaneously</italics><space/>to avoid exposure to market risk, or the risk that prices may change on one market before both transactions are complete. In practical terms, this is generally possible only with securities and financial products that can be traded electronically, and even then, when each leg of the trade is executed the prices in the market may have moved. Missing one of the legs of the trade (and subsequently having to trade it soon after at a worse price) is called 'execution risk' or more specifically 'leg risk'.<extension extension_name='ref' group="note">As an arbitrage consists of at least two trades, the metaphor is of putting on a pair of pants, one leg (trade) at a time.

This type of price arbitrage is the most common, but this simple example ignores the cost of transport, storage, risk, and other factors. &quot;True&quot; arbitrage requires that there be no market risk involved. Where securities are traded on more than one exchange, arbitrage occurs by simultaneously buying in one and selling on the other.</paragraph><paragraph>See<space/><link><target>rational pricing</target></link>, particularly<space/><link><target>rational pricing#Arbitrage mechanics</target><part>arbitrage mechanics</part></link>, for further discussion.</paragraph><paragraph>Mathematically it is defined as follows:</paragraph><list type='ident'><listitem><extension extension_name='math'>P(V_t \geq 0) = 1 \text{ and } P(V_t \neq 0) &gt; 0 \,<space/></extension></listitem></list><paragraph>where<space/><extension extension_name='math'>V_0 = 0</extension><space/>and<space/><extension extension_name='math'>V_t</extension><space/>denotes the portfolio value at time&amp;nbsp;<italics>t</italics>.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Examples</heading><paragraph><template><target>original research</target><arg>section</arg><arg name="date">January 2015</arg></template></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>Suppose that an<space/><link><target>exchange rate</target></link><space/>(after taking out the fees for making the exchange) in London is 5 = 1000 and the exchange rate in Tokyo is 1000 = 6. Converting 2000 to 12 in Tokyo and converting that 12 into 2400 in London, for a profit of 400, would be arbitrage. In reality, this arbitrage is so simple that it almost never occurs. But more complicated foreign exchange arbitrages, such as the spot-forward arbitrage (see<space/><link><target>interest rate parity</target></link>) are much more common.</listitem><listitem>One example of arbitrage involves the<space/><link><target>New York Stock Exchange</target></link><space/>and the Security Futures Exchange<space/><link><target>OneChicago, LLC</target><part>OneChicago (OCX)</part></link>. When the price of a stock on the NYSE and its corresponding<space/><link><target>futures contract</target></link><space/>on OCX are out of sync, one can buy the less expensive one and sell it on the more expensive market. Because the differences between the prices are likely to be small (and not to last very long), this can be done profitably only with computers examining a large number of prices and automatically exercising a trade when the prices are far enough out of balance. The activity of other arbitrageurs can make this risky. Those with the fastest computers (i.e. lowest latency to respond to the market) and the most expertise take advantage of series of small differences that would not be profitable if taken individually.</listitem><listitem>Economists use the term &quot;<link><target>global labor arbitrage</target></link>&quot; to refer to the tendency of manufacturing jobs to flow towards whichever country has the lowest wages per unit output at present and has reached the minimum requisite level of political and economic development to support<space/><link><target>industrialization</target></link>.

(Note that &quot;offshoring&quot; is not synonymous with &quot;outsourcing&quot;, which means &quot;to subcontract from an outside supplier or source&quot;, such as when a business outsources its payroll or cleaning.

Any given bookmaker will weight their odds so that no one<space/><link><target>customer</target></link><space/>can cover all outcomes at a profit against their books. However, in order to remain competitive they must keep margins usually quite low. Different bookmakers may offer different odds on the same outcome of a given event; by taking the best odds offered by each bookmaker, a customer can under some circumstances cover all possible outcomes of the event and lock a small risk-free profit, known as a<space/><link><target>Dutch book</target></link>. This profit will typically be between 1% and 5% but can be much higher. One problem with sports arbitrage is that bookmakers sometimes make mistakes and this can lead to an invocation of the 'palpable error' rule, which most bookmakers invoke when they have made a mistake by offering or posting incorrect odds. As bookmakers become more proficient, the odds of making an 'arb' usually last for less than an hour and typically only a few minutes. Furthermore, huge bets on one side of the market also alert the bookies to correct the market.</listitem><listitem><link><target>Exchange-traded fund</target></link><space/>arbitrage Exchange Traded Funds allow authorized participants to exchange back and forth between shares in underlying securities held by the fund and shares in the fund itself, rather than allowing the buying and selling of shares in the ETF directly with the fund sponsor. ETF trade in the open market, with prices set by market demand. An ETF may trade at a premium or discount to the value of the underlying assets. When a significant enough premium appears, an arbitrageur will buy the underlying securities, convert them to shares in the ETF, and sell them in the open market. When a discount appears, an arbitrageur will do the reverse. In this way, the arbitrageur makes a low-risk profit, while keeping ETF prices in line with their underlying value.</listitem><listitem>Some types of<space/><link><target>hedge fund</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>make use of a modified form of arbitrage to profit.

Any difference between the hedged positions represents any remaining risk (such as basis risk) plus profit; the belief is that there remains some difference which, even after hedging most risk, represents pure profit. For example, a fund may see that there is a substantial difference between U.S. dollar debt and local currency debt of a foreign country, and enter into a series of matching trades (including currency swaps) to arbitrage the difference, while simultaneously entering into<space/><link><target>credit default swap</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>to protect against<space/><link><target>country risk</target></link><space/>and other types of specific risk.</listitem></list><heading level='2'>Price convergence</heading><paragraph>Arbitrage has the effect of causing prices in different markets to converge.

Canadians would have to buy American dollars to buy the cars and Americans would have to sell the Canadian dollars they received in exchange. Both actions would increase demand for US dollars and supply of Canadian dollars. As a result, there would be an appreciation of the US currency.

Formally, arbitrage transactions have<space/><link><target>negative skew</target></link><space/>prices can get a small amount closer (but often no closer than 0), while they can get very far apart. The day-to-day risks are generally small because the transactions involve small differences in price, so an execution failure will generally cause a small loss (unless the trade is very big or the price moves rapidly). The rare case risks are extremely high because these small price differences are converted to large profits via<space/><link><target>Leverage (finance)</target><part>leverage</part></link><space/>(borrowed money), and in the rare event of a large price move, this may yield a large loss.</paragraph><paragraph>The main day-to-day risk is that part of the transaction fails execution risk.

However, this is not necessarily the case. Many exchanges and inter-dealer brokers allow multi legged trades (e.g. basis block trades on LIFFE).</paragraph><paragraph>Competition in the marketplace can also create risks during arbitrage transactions. As an example, if one was trying to profit from a price discrepancy between IBM on the NYSE and IBM on the London Stock Exchange, they may purchase a large number of shares on the NYSE and find that they cannot simultaneously sell on the LSE. This leaves the arbitrageur in an unhedged risk position.</paragraph><paragraph>In the 1980s,<space/><link><target>risk arbitrage</target></link><space/>was common. In this form of<space/><link><target>speculation</target></link>, one trades a security that is clearly undervalued or overvalued, when it is seen that the wrong valuation is about to be corrected by events. The standard example is the stock of a company, undervalued in the stock market, which is about to be the object of a takeover bid; the price of the takeover will more truly reflect the value of the company, giving a large profit to those who bought at the current price&amp;mdash;if the merger goes through as predicted. Traditionally, arbitrage transactions in the securities markets involve high speed, high volume and low risk. At some moment a price difference exists, and the problem is to execute two or three balancing transactions while the difference persists (that is, before the other arbitrageurs act). When the transaction involves a delay of weeks or months, as above, it may entail considerable risk if borrowed money is used to magnify the reward through leverage.

The arbitrage manifests itself in the form of a relatively cheap longer maturity municipal bond, which is a municipal bond that yields significantly more than 65% of a corresponding taxable corporate bond. The steeper slope of the municipal<space/><link><target>yield curve</target></link><space/>allows participants to collect more after-tax income from the municipal bond portfolio than is spent on the interest rate swap; the carry is greater than the hedge expense. Positive, tax-free carry from muni arb can reach into the double digits. The bet in this municipal bond arbitrage is that, over a longer period of time, two similar instrumentsmunicipal bonds and interest rate swapswill correlate with each other; they are both very high quality credits, have the same maturity and are denominated in U.S. dollars. Credit risk and duration risk are largely eliminated in this strategy. However, basis risk arises from use of an imperfect hedge, which results in significant, but range-bound principal volatility. The end goal is to limit this principal volatility, eliminating its relevance over time as the high, consistent, tax-free cash flow accumulates. Since the inefficiency is related to government tax policy, and hence is structural in nature, it has not been arbitraged away.</paragraph><paragraph>Note, however, that many municipal bonds are callable, and that this imposes substantial additional risks to the strategy.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Convertible bond arbitrage</heading><paragraph>A<space/><link><target>convertible bond</target></link><space/>is a<space/><link><target>bond (finance)</target><part>bond</part></link><space/>that an investor can return to the issuing company in exchange for a predetermined number of shares in the company.</paragraph><paragraph>A convertible bond can be thought of as a<space/><link><target>corporate bond</target></link><space/>with a stock<space/><link><target>call option</target></link><space/>attached to it.</paragraph><paragraph>The price of a convertible bond is sensitive to three major factors:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><italics><link><target>interest rate</target></link></italics>.

Many ADR's are exchangeable into the original security (known as<space/><link><target>fungibility</target></link>) and actually have the same value. In this case there is a spread between the perceived value and real value, which can be extracted. Other ADR's that are not exchangeable often have much larger spreads. Since the ADR is trading at a value lower than what it is worth, one can purchase the ADR and expect to make money as its value converges on the original. However, there is a chance that the original stock will fall in value too, so by shorting it one can hedge that risk.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Dual-listed companies</heading><paragraph>A<space/><link><target>dual-listed company</target></link><space/>(DLC) structure involves two companies incorporated in different countries contractually agreeing to operate their businesses as if they were a single enterprise, while retaining their separate legal identity and existing stock exchange listings. In integrated and efficient financial markets, stock prices of the twin pair should move in lockstep. In practice, DLC share prices exhibit large deviations from theoretical parity. Arbitrage positions in DLCs can be set up by obtaining a long position in the relatively underpriced part of the DLC and a short position in the relatively overpriced part. Such arbitrage strategies start paying off as soon as the relative prices of the two DLC stocks converge toward theoretical parity. However, since there is no identifiable date at which DLC prices will converge, arbitrage positions sometimes have to be kept open for considerable periods of time. In the meantime, the price gap might widen. In these situations, arbitrageurs may receive<space/><link><target>margin call</target><trail>s</trail></link>, after which they would most likely be forced to liquidate part of the position at a highly unfavorable moment and suffer a loss.

In total $2.3 billion was invested, half of which long in Shell and the other half short in Royal Dutch (Lowenstein, p.&amp;nbsp;99). In the autumn of 1998 large defaults on Russian debt created significant losses for the hedge fund and LTCM had to unwind several positions. Lowenstein reports that the premium of Royal Dutch had increased to about 22 percent and LTCM had to close the position and incur a loss.

On the other hand, if the real risk is higher than the regulatory risk then it is profitable to make that loan and hold on to it, provided it is priced appropriately. Regulatory arbitrage can result in parts of entire businesses being unregulated as a result of the arbitrage.</paragraph><paragraph>This process can increase the overall riskiness of institutions under a risk insensitive regulatory regime, as described by<space/><link><target>Alan Greenspan</target></link><space/>in his October 1998 speech on<space/><link type='external' href='http://www.ny.frb.org/research/epr/98v04n3/9810gree.pdf'>The Role of Capital in Optimal Banking Supervision and Regulation</link>.</paragraph><paragraph>The term &quot;Regulatory Arbitrage&quot; was used for the first time in 2005 when it was applied by Scott V. Simpson, a partner at law firm Skadden, Arps, to refer to a new defence tactic in hostile mergers and acquisitions where differing takeover regimes in deals involving multi-jurisdictions are exploited to the advantage of a target company under threat.</paragraph><paragraph>In economics, regulatory arbitrage (sometimes, tax arbitrage) may be used to refer to situations when a company can choose a nominal place of business with a regulatory, legal or tax regime with lower costs. For example, an<space/><link><target>insurance</target></link><space/>company may choose to locate in<space/><link><target>Bermuda</target></link><space/>due to preferential tax rates and policies for insurance companies. This can occur particularly where the business transaction has no obvious physical location: in the case of many financial products, it may be unclear &quot;where&quot; the transaction occurs.</paragraph><paragraph>Regulatory arbitrage can include restructuring a bank by outsourcing services such as IT. The outsourcing company takes over the installations, buying out the bank's assets and charges a periodic service fee back to the bank. This frees up cashflow usable for new lending by the bank. The bank will have higher IT costs, but counts on the multiplier effect of<space/><link><target>money creation</target></link><space/>and the interest rate spread to make it a profitable exercise.</paragraph><paragraph>Example:Suppose the bank sells its IT installations for 40 million USD. With a reserve ratio of 10%, the bank can create 400 million USD in additional loans (there is a time lag, and the bank has to expect to recover the loaned money back into its books). The bank can often lend (and securitize the loan) to the IT services company to cover the acquisition cost of the IT installations. This can be at preferential rates, as the sole client using the IT installation is the bank. If the bank can generate 5% interest margin on the 400 million of new loans, the bank will increase interest revenues by 20 million. The IT services company is free to leverage their balance sheet as aggressively as they and their banker agree to. This is the reason behind the trend towards outsourcing in the financial sector. Without this money creation benefit, it is actually more expensive to outsource the IT operations as the outsourcing adds a layer of management and increases overhead.</paragraph><paragraph>According to PBS Frontline's 2012 four-part documentary, &quot;Money, Power, and Wall Street,&quot; regulatory arbitrage, along with asymmetric bank lobbying in Washington and abroad, allowed investment banks in the pre- and post-2008 period to continue to skirt laws and engage in the risky proprietary trading of opaque derivatives, swaps, and other credit-based instruments invented to circumvent legal restrictions at the expense of clients, government, and publics.</paragraph><paragraph>Due to the Affordable Care Acts expansion of Medicaid coverage, one form of Regulatory Arbitrage can now be found when businesses engage in Medicaid Migration, a maneuver by which qualifying employees who would typically be enrolled in company health plans elect to enroll in Medicaid instead.

LTCM had attempted to make money on the price difference between different<space/><link><target>Bond (finance)</target><part>bonds</part></link>. For example, it would sell<space/><link><target>United States Treasury security</target><part>U.S. Treasury securities</part></link><space/>and buy Italian bond futures. The concept was that because Italian bond futures had a less liquid market, in the short term Italian bond futures would have a higher return than U.S. bonds, but in the long term, the prices would converge. Because the difference was small, a large amount of money had to be borrowed to make the buying and selling profitable.</paragraph><paragraph>The downfall in this system began on August 17, 1998, when<space/><link><target>Russia</target></link><space/>defaulted on its<space/><link><target>Russian ruble</target><part>ruble</part></link><space/>debt and domestic dollar debt. Because the markets were already nervous due to the<space/><link><target>Asian financial crisis</target></link>, investors began selling non-U.S. treasury debt and buying U.S. treasuries, which were considered a safe investment. As a result, the price on US treasuries began to increase and the return began decreasing because there were many buyers, and the return (yield) on other bonds began to increase because there were many sellers (i.e. the price of those bonds fell). This caused the difference between the prices of U.S. treasuries and other bonds to increase, rather than to decrease as LTCM was expecting. Eventually this caused LTCM to fold, and their creditors had to arrange a bail-out. More controversially, officials of the<space/><link><target>Federal Reserve</target></link><space/>assisted in the negotiations that led to this bail-out, on the grounds that so many companies and deals were intertwined with LTCM that if LTCM actually failed, they would as well, causing a collapse in confidence in the economic system. Thus LTCM failed as a fixed income arbitrage fund, although it is unclear what sort of profit was realized by the banks that bailed LTCM out.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Etymology</heading><paragraph>&quot;Arbitrage&quot; is a French word and denotes a decision by an arbitrator or arbitration tribunal.
