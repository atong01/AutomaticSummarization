'''Donald Allen Wollheim''' (October 1, 1914 – November 2, 1990) was an [[American people|American]] science fiction [[List of science fiction editors|editor]], publisher,  [[List of science fiction authors|writer]], and [[science fiction fandom|fan]]. As an author, he published under his own name as well as under pseudonyms, including '''David Grinnell'''.<ref name="smith">{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Curtis C.|authorlink=Curtis C. Smith|title=Twentieth Century Science Fiction Writers|publisher=St. Martin's|year=1981|location=New York|pages=596–98|isbn=0-312-82420-3}}</ref>

A founding member of the [[Futurians]], he was a leading influence on science fiction development and fandom in the 20th century United States.<ref name="smith"/>

==Wollheim as fan==

''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'' (first edition, 1979) calls Wollheim "one of the first and most vociferous sf fans."<ref name="ency">{{cite book|last=Nicholls|first=Peter|title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|publisher=Granada|year=1979|location=London|pages=660–61}}</ref> He published numerous fanzines and co-edited the early ''Fanciful Tales of Space and Time''.  His importance to early fandom is chronicled in the 1974 book ''The Immortal Storm'' by Sam Moskowitz<ref>{{cite book|last=Moskowitz|first=Sam|title=The Immortal Storm|publisher=Hyperion Press|year=1974|location=Westport, CT}}</ref> and in the 1977 book ''The Futurians'' by Damon Knight.<ref name="futurians"/>[[File:With Frederik Pohl and John Michel c. 1938.jpg|left|thumb|With Frederik Pohl and John Michel, 1938]]

Wollheim organized the first science fiction convention. A group from New York met with a group from Philadelphia on October 22, 1936 in Philadelphia. The modern [[Philcon]] convention claims descent from this event. Out of this meeting, plans were formed for regional and national meetings, including the first Worldcon.<ref name="Locus90">''LOCUS'', December 1990, Donald A. Wollheim: Obituaries and Appreciations, pp. 68–70.</ref>

Wollheim was a member of the New York Science Fiction League, one of the clubs established by [[Hugo Gernsback]] to promote science fiction.<ref name="futurians">{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Damon|authorlink=Damon Knight|title=The Futurians|publisher=John Day|year=1977|location=New York|isbn=0-381-98288-2}}</ref> When payment was not forthcoming for the first story he sold to Gernsback, Wollheim formed a group with several other authors, and successfully sued for payment. He was expelled from the Science Fiction League as "a disruptive influence"<ref name="Locus90"/> but was later reinstated. From the September 1935 issue of Gernsback's ''Wonder Stories'':
{{blockquote | 
THREE MEMBERS EXPELLED

It grieves us to announce that we have found the first disloyalty in our organization...  These members we expelled on June 12th.  Their names are Donald A. Wollheim, John B. Michel, and William S. Sykora - three active fans who just got themselves onto the wrong road.}}

In 1937 Wollheim founded the [[Fantasy Amateur Press Association]], whose first mailing (July 1937) included this statement from Wollheim: "There are many fans desiring to put out a voice who dare not, for fear of being obliged to keep it up, and for the worry and time taken by subscriptions and advertising. It is for them and for the fan who admits it is his hobby and not his business that we formed the FAPA." In 1938, with several friends, he formed the [[Futurians]]—arguably the best-known of the science fiction clubs. At one time or another, the membership included [[Isaac Asimov]], [[Frederik Pohl]], [[Cyril Kornbluth]], [[James Blish]], [[John B. Michel|John Michel]], [[Judith Merril]], [[Robert A. W. Lowndes]], [[Richard Wilson (author)|Richard Wilson]], [[Damon Knight]], [[Virginia Kidd]], and [[Larry T. Shaw]].<ref name="Locus90"/> In 1943 Wollheim married fellow Futurian Elsie Balter (1910–1996). It proved to be a lasting marriage and a publishing partnership.

The Futurians became less fan-oriented and more professional after 1940. Its conferences and workshops focused on writing, editing, and publishing, with many of its members interested in all three.<ref name="Locus90"/>

==Wollheim as author==

Wollheim's first story, "The Man from Ariel", was published in the January 1934 issue of ''[[Wonder Stories]]''<ref name=isfdb/><ref>{{cite web|last=Silver|first=Steven H|authorlink=Steven H Silver|title=Debut Science Fiction|url=http://www.sfsite.com/~silverag/debut.html#W:|accessdate=2007-09-21}}</ref> when he was nineteen. [[File:Don Wollheim & daughter Betsy.jpg|thumb|left|His author photo: Don Wollheim & daughter Betsy (1954)]] He was not paid for the story, and he learned that other authors had not been paid either and said so in the ''Bulletin'' of the Terrestrial Fantascience Guild.<ref name="speer">{{cite book|last=Speer|first=Jack|authorlink=Jack Speer|title=Up to Now|publisher=Full-Length Articles|year=1939}}</ref> Publisher [[Hugo Gernsback]] eventually settled with Wollheim and the other authors out of court for $75, but when Wollheim submitted another story to Gernsback under the pseudonym Millard Verne Gordon, "The Space Lens" was published in the September 1935 issue<ref name=isfdb/> but he was again not paid.<ref name="davin">{{cite book|last=Davin|first=Eric Leif|authorlink=Eric Leif Davin|title=Pioneers of Wonder|publisher=Prometheus Books |year=1999 |location=New York|isbn=1-57392-702-3}}</ref> His third known story was published in ''Fanciful Tales of Time and Space'', Fall 1936, a fanzine that he edited himself.<!-- published by Shepherd & Wollheim; perhaps only one issue http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/seriesgrid.cgi?33890 --><ref name=isfdb/> That year he also published and edited another short-lived fanzine, ''Phantagraph''.<ref name=isfdb/>

Wollheim's stories were published regularly from 1940; at the same time he was becoming an important editor. In the 1950s and 60s he wrote chiefly novels. He usually used pseudonyms for works aimed at grownups, and wrote children's novels under his own name. Notable and popular were the eight "Mike Mars" books for children, which explored different facets of the NASA space program.<ref name="ency"/> Also well-received were the "Secret" books for young readers: ''The Secret of Saturn's Rings'' (1954), ''Secret of the Martian Moons'' (1955), and ''The Secret of the Ninth Planet'' (1959). As Martin Pearson he published the "Ajax Calkins" series, which became the basis for his novel ''Destiny's Orbit'' (1962).<ref name="ency"/> A sequel, ''Destination: Saturn'' was published in 1967 in collaboration with [[Lin Carter]]. One of his most important books, however, was nonfiction; ''The Universe Makers'' (1971) is a discussion of themes and philosophy in science fiction.

One of Wollheim's short stories, "Mimic", was made into the feature [[Mimic (film)|film]] of the same name, released in 1997.<ref>{{IMDb name|938586}}.</ref>

"In true editorial fashion, he was honest about the quality of his own writing", says his daughter Betsy. "He felt it was fair to middling at best. He always knew that his great talent was as an editor."<ref name="betsy">Personal interview with Elizabeth Wollheim. April 27, 2009.</ref>

==Wollheim as editor and publisher==

[[Robert Silverberg]] said that Donald Wollheim was "one of the most significant figures in 20th century American science fiction publishing", adding, "A plausible case could be made that he was ''the'' most significant figure — responsible in large measure for the development of the science fiction paperback, the science fiction anthology, and the whole post-Tolkien boom in fantasy fiction."<ref name="Locus90"/>

Wollheim edited the first science fiction anthology to be mass-marketed, ''The Pocket Book of Science Fiction'' (1943).<ref name="Locus90"/> It was also the first book containing the words "science fiction" in the title.<ref name="betsy"/> It included works by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], [[Theodore Sturgeon]], [[Thomas Sigismund Stribling|T. S. Stribling]], [[Stephen Vincent Benét]], [[Ambrose Bierce]], and [[H. G. Wells]]. Shortly before World War II, he edited two of the earliest periodicals devoted entirely to science fiction, ''Stirring Science Stories'' and ''Cosmic Stories.''<ref>''The New York Times'', November 3, 1990, Section 1, p. 18.</ref>

[[Image:acexx06.jpg|left|thumb|Ace Double, ''The Brain Stealers/Atta'' (1954)]]
[[Image:Avon Fantasy Reader 10.djvu|right|thumb|Avon Fantasy Reader No. 10, edited by Donald Wollheim]]
In 1945 Wollheim edited the first hardcover anthology from a major publisher and the first omnibus, ''The Viking Portable Novels of Science''. He also edited the first anthology of original sf, ''The Girl With the Hungry Eyes'' (1947), although there is evidence that this last was originally intended to be the first issue of a new magazine.<ref name="Locus90"/> Between 1947 and 1951 he was the editor at the pioneering paperback publisher [[Avon (publishers)|Avon Books]], where he made available highly affordable editions of the works of [[A. Merritt]], [[H. P. Lovecraft]], and [[C. S. Lewis]]' ''Silent Planet'' space trilogy, bringing these previously little-known authors a wide readership.<ref name="silver">{{cite book|last=Silverberg|first=Robert|title=Reflections & Refractions: Thoughts on Science Fiction, Science, and Other Matters|publisher=Underwood|year=1997|location=Grass Valley, Calif|pages=253–56}}</ref> During this period he also edited the influential ''[[Avon Fantasy Reader]]'' for eighteen issues, and the ''[[Avon Science Fiction Reader]]'' for three.  These periodicals contained mostly reprints and a few original stories.

In 1952 Wollheim left Avon to work for [[A. A. Wyn]] at the Ace Magazine Company and spearhead a new paperback book list, [[Ace Books]]. In 1953 he introduced science fiction to the Ace lineup,<ref name="smith"/> and for 20 years as editor-in-chief was responsible for their multi-genre list and, most important to him, their renowned sf list.<ref name="ency"/> Wollheim invented the ''[[Ace Double]]s'' series which consisted of pairs of books, usually by different authors, bound back-to-back with two "front" covers.<ref name="silver"/> Because these paired books had to fit a fixed total page length, one or both were usually abridged to fit, and Wollheim often made other editorial alterations — as witness the differences between [[Poul Anderson]]'s Ace novel ''War of the Wing-Men'' and its definitive revised edition, ''The Man Who Counts''. Among the authors who made their paperback debuts in Ace Doubles were [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Samuel R. Delany]], [[Leigh Brackett]], [[Ursula K. Le Guin]], and [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]].<ref name="silver"/> [[William S. Burroughs]]' first book, ''[[Junkie (novel)|Junkie]]'', was published as an Ace Double.<ref name="silver"/> Wollheim also helped develop [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]], [[Robert Silverberg]], [[Avram Davidson]], [[Fritz Leiber]], [[Andre Norton]], [[Thomas Burnett Swann]], [[Jack Vance]], and [[Roger Zelazny]], among others.<ref name="Locus90"/> While at Ace, he and co-editor Terry Carr began an annual anthology series, ''The World's Best Science Fiction'', the first collection of what they considered the best of the prior year's short stories, from magazines, hardcovers, paperback collections and other anthologies.<ref name="Locus90"/>

In the early 1960s Ace reintroduced Edgar Rice Burroughs' work, which had long been out of print, and in 1965, Ace bought the paperback rights to [[Dune]].<ref name="Locus90"/> (Herbert's title worried Wollheim, who feared it would be mistaken for a western.)<ref name="betsy"/> Eventually, Ace introduced single paperback books and became one of the preeminent genre publishers. Ace and Ballantine dominated sf in the 1960s and built the genre by publishing original material as well as reprints.<ref name="Locus90"/>

[[File:3 Ace Tolkien.jpeg|thumb|left|The famed Ace editions, now collectors' items]] There was a time when no paperback publisher would publish fantasy. It was believed that there was no public for fantasy and that it wouldn't sell. Then Wollheim changed everything when he brought out an unauthorized paperback edition of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' in three volumes — the first mass-market paperback edition of Tolkien's epic.<ref name="silver"/> In a 2006 interview, his daughter Elizabeth said:

<blockquote>He called Professor Tolkien in 1964 and asked if he could publish ''Lord of the Rings'' as Ace paperbacks. Tolkien said he would never allow ''Lord of the Rings'', his great work, to appear in 'so degenerate a form’ as the paperback book. Don was one of the fathers of the entire paperback industry. He'd spearheaded the Ace line, he was the originating editor-in-chief of the Avon paperback list in 1945, and I think he was hurt and took it personally. He did a little research and discovered a loophole in the copyright. Houghton Mifflin, Tolkien’s American hardcover publisher, had neglected to protect the work in the United States. So, incensed by Tolkien’s response, he realized that he could legally publish the trilogy and did. This brash act (which ultimately benefited his primary competitors as well as Tolkien) was really the Big Bang that founded the modern fantasy field, and only someone like my father could have done that. He paid Tolkien, and he was responsible for making not only Tolkien extremely wealthy but Ballantine Books as well. And if he hadn’t done it, who knows when — or if — those books would ever have been published in paperback.<ref>''LOCUS'', June 2006, Betsy Wollheim Interview.</ref></blockquote>

Tolkien had authorized a paperback edition of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' in 1961, though that edition was never made available outside the U.K.<ref>{{cite web|title=The First Paperback Edition of The Hobbit|url=http://www.tolkiencollector.com/hobbhist.htm |accessdate=2009-04-27}}</ref> Eventually, he supported paperback editions of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and several of his other texts, but it is difficult to say whether he was persuaded to do so by the manifest economic wisdom evident in sales of the Ace editions. In any case, Ace was forced to cease publishing the unauthorized edition and to pay Tolkien for their sales following a grass-roots campaign by Tolkien's U.S. fans.<ref>{{cite web|author=Reynolds, Pat|year=2004|title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text|url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html}}</ref><ref>{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}</ref> A 1993 court determined that the copyright loophole suggested by Ace Books was incorrect and its paperback edition was found to have been a violation of copyright under [[Copyright law of the United States|US law.]]<ref>Eisen, Durwood & Co. v. Christopher R. Tolkien et al., 794 F. Supp. 85, 23 U.S.P.Q.2d 1150 (S.D.N.Y. 1992), affirmed without opinion, 990 F.2d 623 (2nd Cir. 1993).</ref> (At this time, the U.S. had yet to join the International Copyright Convention, and most laws on the books existed to protect domestic creations from foreign infringement. Houghton Mifflin was technically in violation of the law when they exceeded their import limits and failed to renew their interim copyright.) In the ''LOCUS'' obituary for Donald Wollheim, however, yet more detail emerges.
<blockquote>Houghton-Mifflin had imported sheets instead of printing their own edition, but they didn't want to sell paperback rights. Ace printed the first paperback edition and caused such a furor that Tolkien rewrote the books enough to get a new copyright, then sold them to Ballantine. The rest is history. Although Ace and Wollheim have become the villains in the Tolkien publishing gospel, it's probable that the whole Tolkien boom would not have happened if Ace hadn't published them.<ref name="Locus90"/></blockquote>

==DAW Books==

Wollheim left Ace in 1971. [[Frederik Pohl]] describes the circumstances:
<blockquote>Unfortunately, when Wyn died [in 1968] the company was sold to a consortium headed by a bank.&nbsp;... Few of them had any publishing experience before they found themselves running Ace. It showed. Before long, bills weren't being paid, authors' advances and royalties were delayed, budgets were cut back, and most of Donald's time was spent trying to soothe authors and agents who were indignant, and had every right to be, at the way they were treated.<ref name="Locus90"/></blockquote>
[[Image:DAW Books Logo.jpg|right|thumb|DAW Books logo used from 1972 to 1984]]
Upon leaving Ace, he and his wife, Elsie Balter Wollheim, founded [[DAW Books]], named for his initials. DAW can claim to be the first mass market specialist science fiction and [[fantasy fiction]] publishing house.<ref name="smith"/> DAW issued its first four titles in April 1972. Most of the writers whom he had developed at Ace went with him to DAW: Marion Zimmer Bradley, Andre Norton, Philip K. Dick, John Brunner, [[A. Bertram Chandler]], [[Kenneth Bulmer]], [[Gordon R. Dickson]], [[A. E. van Vogt]], and [[Jack Vance]]. In later years, when his distributor, [[New American Library]], threatened to withhold [[Thomas Burnett Swann]]'s Biblical fantasy ''How Are the Mighty Fallen'' (1974) because of its homosexual content, Wollheim fought vigorously against their decision. They relented.

His later author discoveries included [[Tanith Lee]], [[Jennifer Roberson]], [[Michael Shea (author)|Michael Shea]], [[Ian Wallace (author)|Ian Wallace]], [[Tad Williams]], [[Celia S. Friedman]], and [[C. J. Cherryh]], whose ''Downbelow Station'' (1982) was the first DAW book to win the Hugo Award for best novel. He was also able to give a number of British writers — [[Michael Moorcock]], [[Edwin Charles Tubb|E. C. Tubb]], [[Brian Stableford]], [[Barrington Bayley]], [[Michael Coney]] — a new American audience. He published translations of international sf as well as anthologies of translated stories, ''Best From the Rest of the World.'' With the help of [[Arthur W. Saha]], Wollheim also edited and published the popular "Annual World's Best Science Fiction" anthology from 1971 until his death.

==Recognition==

Upon Wollheim's death in 1990, the prolific editor Robert Silverberg argued ([[#Wollheim as editor and publisher|above]]) that he may have been "''the'' most significant figure" in American SF publishing.<ref name=Locus90/>

[[Robert Jordan]] credits Wollheim for helping to launch his (Jordan's) career. Wollheim made an offer for Jordan's first novel, ''Warriors of the Ataii'', though he withdrew the offer when Jordan requested some minor changes to the contract. Jordan claims that Wollheim's first, 'laudatory' letter convinced him that he could write, and so he chose to remember the first letter and forget about the second.<ref>McAlpine, Rachel. {{Wayback |date=20020624153852 |url=http://writing.co.nz/writing/fantasy.htm |title=New Zealand interview with Robert Jordan}}.</ref><ref>Kleffel, Rick. [http://www.theoryland.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=6032 Fine Print interview with Robert Jordan].</ref> The novel was never published, but Jordan went on to write the immensely successful [[Wheel of Time]] series for a different publisher.

Marion Zimmer Bradley refers to him as "a second father", Frederik Pohl calls him "a founder",<ref name="Locus90"/> and Robert Silverberg says he was "seriously underrated" and "one of the great shapers of science-fiction publishing in the United States".<ref name="silver"/> In 1977 scholar [[Robert Scholes]] named Wollheim "one of the most important editors and publishers of science fiction."<ref name="scholes-rabkin">{{cite book | first1=Robert | last1=Scholes| authorlink1= Robert Scholes| first2 = Eric S.| last2 = Rabkin|title=Science Fiction: History, Science, Vision| publisher=Oxford University Press| location=London|date=1977|chapter=Bibliography I: History and Criticism of Science Fiction}}</ref>

From 1975 Wollheim received several special awards for his contributions to science fiction and to fantasy.<ref name=SFAwards/><!-- including one at the 1975 World SF Convention and runner-up to Ian & Betty Ballantine at the 1975 World Fantasy Convention
