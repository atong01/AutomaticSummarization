The article also indicates that Attila's name could have originated from Turkic/Mongolian word for horse - &quot;at, adyy/agta&quot; - but it also states: &quot;Of course we do not know how the name sounded in the language of the Huns. Sometime, somewhere, somehow a proto-form like *agtala- changed to *attila. We cannot tell if the assimilation of gt to tt, and/or if loss of a final consonant took place in Hunnic or if these changes were part of the adaptation process into Latin, Gothic and Greek...Truly, our knowledge of the Hunnic language is almost zero.

Originally titled,<space/><italics>A History of Attila and the Huns</italics>, Thompson did not enter controversies over Hunnic origins and considers that Attila's victories were achieved only when there was no concerted opposition. The 1999 edition includes an &quot;Afterword&quot; by Heather which adds substantial new material and explains how the revised edition came to be. A preview of many of the pages of the Afterword is available at the link if you are a registered Amazon buyer via their &quot;Look Inside!&quot; feature.
