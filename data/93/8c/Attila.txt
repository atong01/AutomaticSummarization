'''Attila''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|t|ɨ|l|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|t|ɪ|l|ə}}; [[fl.]] 434–453), frequently referred to as '''Attila the Hun''', was the ruler of the [[Huns]] from 434 until his death in March 453. Attila was a leader of the [[Hunnic Empire]], which stretched from the [[Ural River]] to the [[Rhine River]] and from the [[Danube River]] to the [[Baltic Sea]].

During his reign, he was one of the most feared enemies of the [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] and [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern]] Roman Empires. He crossed the Danube twice and plundered the [[Balkans]], but was unable to take [[Constantinople]]. His unsuccessful campaign in [[Persia]] was followed in 441 by an invasion of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, the success of which emboldened Attila to invade the West.<ref name=CEnAttila /> He also attempted to conquer [[Roman Gaul]] (modern France), crossing the Rhine in 451 and marching as far as Aurelianum ([[Orléans]]) before being defeated at the [[Battle of the Catalaunian Plains]].

He subsequently invaded [[Italy]], devastating the northern provinces, but was unable to take [[Rome]]. He planned for further campaigns against the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] but died in 453. After Attila's death his close adviser [[Ardaric]] of the [[Gepids]] led a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] revolt against Hunnic rule, after which the Hunnic Empire [[Battle of Nedao|quickly collapsed]].

== Appearance and character ==
There is no surviving first-hand account of Attila's appearance, but there is a possible second-hand source provided by [[Jordanes]], who cites a description given by [[Priscus]].<ref name=Bakker /><ref name=Wolfram />

{{quote|Short of stature, with a broad chest and a large head; his eyes were small, his beard thin and sprinkled with grey; and he had a flat nose and tanned skin, showing evidence of his origin.<ref name=Jordanes />}}

Some modern scholars have suggested that this description is typically East Asian, because it has all the combined features that fit the physical type of people from Eastern Asia, and Attila's ancestors may have come from there.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=tOnQDfRU-poC&pg=PA143 The Roman Empire and Its Germanic Peoples. By Herwig Wolfram]</ref><ref>The Cambridge History of Early Inner Asia, Volume 1 edited by Denis Sinor [https://books.google.com/books?id=ST6TRNuWmHsC&pg=PA202]</ref>

== Etymology ==
The origin of the name "''[[Attila (name)|Attila]]''" is unclear. [[Menander]] used the term ''Attila'' as the name of the [[Volga River]].<ref name=Rubruck /> Pritsak considers it to mean "universal ruler" in a [[Turkic languages|Turkic language]] related to [[Bulgar language|Danube Bulgarian]].<ref name=Pritsak />{{rp|444}}

[[Turkology|Turkologist]] [[Otto J. Maenchen-Helfen]] rejects a Turkic etymology, and suggests an [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]] origin: "''Attila'' is formed from [[Gothic language|Gothic]] or [[Gepids|Gepidic]] atta, 'father', by means of the diminutive suffix -ila." He finds Pritsak's etymology "ingenious but for many reasons unacceptable". However, he suggests that these names were: {{quote|not the true names of the Hun princes and lords. What we have are Hunnic names in Germanic dress, modified to fit the Gothic tongue, or popular Gothic etymologies, or both.<ref name=Maenchen />{{rp|386–387}}}}

The names of Attila's relatives [[Bleda]], [[Rugila]], and [[Laudaricus]] are also Germanic.<ref name=Maenchen />{{rp|386–390}}<ref name=Maenchen />{{rp|441}} Other prominent Huns with Germanic names include [[Edeko]], [[Onegesius]], and [[Ragnaris]].<ref name=Maenchen />{{rp|386–390}}<ref name=Maenchen />{{rp|441}} Historian [[Peter Heather]] states that the possibility cannot be ruled out of Attila being of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] ancestry, judging by a hypothetical Germanic etymology of Attila's name and the status of [[Gothic language|Gothic]] as the [[lingua franca]] at his court.<ref name=SpiegelOL />

M. Snædal casts doubt on the Germanic origin of the name Attila in a recently published article. "The Gothic origin of the name Attila is questionable," Snædal writes. "It is at least as likely to be of Hunnic origin." The article points out that the word "atta" is a migratory term for "father/forefather" common in multiple languages, including many Turkic languages. The article also indicates that Attila's name could have originated from Turkic/Mongolian word for horse - "at, adyy/agta" - but it also states: "Of course we do not know how the name sounded in the language of the Huns. Sometime, somewhere, somehow a proto-form like *agtala- changed to *attila. We cannot tell if the assimilation of gt to tt, and/or if loss of a final consonant took place in Hunnic or if these changes were part of the adaptation process into Latin, Gothic and Greek...Truly, our knowledge of the Hunnic language is almost zero. One can only guess a solution to this riddle of Attila's name." <ref>Snædal, M. (2015). ATTILA. Studia Etymologica Cracoviensia, (20), 211-219. [http://www.ejournals.eu/SEC/2015/Issue-3/art/4470/]</ref>

The name has many variants in modern languages: Atli and Atle in [[Old Norse|Norse]]; Attila, Atilla, and Etele in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] (Attila is the most popular); Etzel in German ([[Nibelungenlied]]); Attila, Atilla, Atilay, or Atila in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]; and Adil and Edil in [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] or Adil ("same/similar") or Edil ("to use") in Mongolian.

== Historiography and source ==
The historiography of Attila is faced with a major challenge, in that the only complete sources are written in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] by the enemies of the Huns. Attila's contemporaries left many testimonials of his life, but only fragments of these remain.<ref name=Escher />{{rp|25}} [[Priscus]] was a Roman diplomat and historian who wrote in Greek, and he was both a witness to and an actor in the story of Attila, as a member of the embassy of [[Theodosius II|Theodosius&nbsp;II]] at the Hunnic court in 449. He was obviously biased by his political position, but his writing is a major source for information on the life of Attila, and he is the only person known to have recorded a physical description of him. He wrote a history of the late Roman Empire in eight books covering the period from 430 to 476.<ref name=Given />

Today we have only fragments of Priscus' work, but it was cited extensively by 6th-century historians [[Procopius]] and [[Jordanes]],<ref name=Rouche />{{rp|413}} especially in Jordanes' ''[[Getica|The Origin and Deeds of the Goths]]''. It contains numerous references to Priscus's history, and it is also an important source of information about the Hunnic empire and its neighbors. He describes the legacy of Attila and the Hunnic people for a century after Attila's death. [[Marcellinus Comes]], a chancellor of [[Justinian]] during the same era, also describes the relations between the Huns and the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].<ref name=Escher />{{rp|30}}

Numerous ecclesiastical writings contain useful but scattered information, sometimes difficult to authenticate or distorted by years of hand-copying between the 6th and 17th centuries. The [[Hungary|Hungarian]] writers of the 12th century wished to portray the Huns in a positive light as their glorious ancestors, and so repressed certain historical elements and added their own legends.<ref name=Escher />{{rp|32}}

The literature and knowledge of the Huns themselves was transmitted orally, by means of epics and chanted poems that were handed down from generation to generation.<ref name=Rouche />{{rp|354}} Indirectly, fragments of this [[oral history]] have reached us via the literature of the Scandinavians and Germans, neighbors of the Huns who wrote between the 9th and 13th centuries. Attila is a major character in many Medieval epics, such as the [[Nibelungenlied]], as well as various [[Edda]]s and [[saga]]s.<ref name=Escher />{{rp|32}}&nbsp;<ref name=Rouche />{{rp|354}}

[[Archaeology|Archaeological]] investigation has uncovered some details about the lifestyle, art, and warfare of the Huns. There are a few traces of battles and sieges, but today the tomb of Attila and the location of his capital have not yet been found.<ref name=Escher />{{rp|33–37}}

== Early life and background ==
{{Main|Huns}}
The Huns were a group of [[Eurasian nomads]], appearing from east of the [[Volga]], who migrated into Europe c.&nbsp;370<ref name=Rene>{{Cite book |last=Grousset |first=Rene |title=The Empire of the Steppes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1970 |isbn=0-8135-1304-9 |pages=38}}</ref> and built up an enormous empire there. Their main military techniques were [[mounted archer]]y and [[javelin]] throwing. They were possibly the descendants of the [[Xiongnu]] (Hsiung-nu) who [[History of the Han Dynasty|had been northern neighbors]] of China three hundred years before<ref name=DeGuignes /> and may be the first expansion of [[Turkic people]] across [[Eurasia]].<ref name=Eliznik /><ref name=Calise /><ref name=Arutiunov /><ref name=Canfield /><ref name=Frazee /> They were in the process of developing [[sedentism|settlements]] before their arrival in Europe, yet the Huns were a society of pastoral warriors<ref name=Rouche />{{rp|259}} whose primary form of nourishment was meat and milk, products of their herds.

The origin and [[Hunnic language|language of the Huns]] has been the subject of debate for centuries. According to some theories, their leaders at least may have spoken a [[Turkic language]], perhaps closest to the modern [[Chuvash language]].<ref name=Pritsak />{{rp|444}} One scholar suggests a relationship to [[Yeniseian]].<ref name=Vovin /> According to the ''Encyclopedia of European Peoples'', "the Huns, especially those who migrated to the west, may have been a combination of central Asian [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]], [[Mongols|Mongolic]], and [[Ugric peoples|Ugric]] stocks."<ref name=Waldman />

Attila's father [[Mundzuk]]<ref name=Jordanes /> was the brother of Kings [[Octar]] and [[Rugila]], who reigned jointly over the Hunnic empire in the early fifth century. This form of [[diarchy]] was recurrent with the Huns, but historians are unsure whether it was institutionalized, merely customary, or an occasional occurrence.<ref name=Escher />{{rp|80}} His family was from a noble lineage, but it is uncertain whether they constituted a royal [[dynasty]]. Attila's birthdate is not known, but journalist Éric Deschodt and writer Herman Schreiber have proposed a date of 395.<ref name=Deschodt /><ref name=Schreiber /> However, historian [[Iaroslav Lebedynsky]] and archaeologist Katalin Escher prefer an estimate between the 390s and the first decade of the fifth century.<ref name=Escher />{{rp|40}}

Attila grew up in a rapidly changing world. His people were nomads who had only recently arrived in Europe.<ref name=Bona />{{rp|15}} They crossed the [[Volga]] river during the 370s and annexed the territory of the [[Alans]], then attacked the Gothic kingdom between the [[Carpathian mountains]] and the [[Danube]]. They were a very mobile people, whose mounted archers had acquired a reputation of invincibility, and the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] seemed unable to withstand them.<ref name=Rouche />{{rp|133–151}} Vast populations fleeing the Huns moved from [[Germania]] into the Roman Empire in the west and south, and along the banks of the [[Rhine]] and Danube. In 376, the Goths crossed the Danube, initially submitting to the Romans but soon rebelling against Emperor [[Valens]], whom they killed in the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378.<ref name=Rouche />{{rp|100}} Large numbers of [[Vandals]], Alans, [[Suebi]], and [[Burgundians]] [[crossing of the Rhine|crossed the Rhine]] and invaded Roman [[Gaul]] on December&nbsp;31, 406 to escape the Huns.<ref name=Escher />{{rp|233}} The Roman Empire had been split in half since 395 and was ruled by two distinct governments, one based in [[Ravenna]] in the West, and the other in [[Constantinople]] in the East. The Roman Emperors, both East and West, were generally from the [[Theodosian dynasty|Theodosian]] family in Attila's lifetime (despite several power struggles).<ref name=Lebedynsky />{{rp|13}}

The Huns dominated a vast territory with nebulous borders determined by the will of a constellation of ethnically varied peoples. Some were assimilated to Hunnic nationality, whereas many retained their own identities and rulers but acknowledged the [[suzerainty]] of the king of the Huns.<ref name=Lebedynsky />{{rp|11}} The Huns were also the indirect source of many of the Romans' problems, driving various Germanic tribes into Roman territory, yet relations between the two empires were cordial: the Romans used the Huns as [[mercenary|mercenaries]] against the Germans and even in their civil wars. Thus, the usurper [[Joannes]] was able to recruit thousands of Huns for his army against [[Valentinian III|Valentinian&nbsp;III]] in 424.  It was [[Flavius Aetius|Aëtius]], later Patrician of the West, who managed this operation.  They exchanged ambassadors and hostages, the alliance lasting from 401 to 450 and permitting the Romans numerous military victories.<ref name=Rouche />{{rp|111}} The Huns considered the Romans to be paying them tribute, whereas the Romans preferred to view this as payment for services rendered. The Huns had become a great power by the time that Attila came of age during the reign of his uncle Rugila, to the point that [[Nestorius]], the Patriarch of Constantinople, deplored the situation with these words: "They have become both masters and slaves of the Romans."<ref name=Rouche />{{rp|128}}

== Campaigns against the Eastern Roman Empire ==
[[File:Huns empire.png|thumb|left|325px|[[Hunnic Empire]] (green)]]
The death of [[Rugila]] (also known as Rua or Ruga) in 434 left the sons of his brother [[Mundzuk]], Attila and [[Bleda]] (Buda), in control of the united Hun tribes. At the time of the two brothers' accession, the Hun tribes were bargaining with Eastern Roman Emperor [[Theodosius II|Theodosius&nbsp;II]]'s envoys for the return of several [[wikt:renegade|renegades]] who had taken refuge within the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], possibly Hunnic nobles who disagreed with the brothers' assumption of leadership.

The following year, Attila and Bleda met with the imperial legation at [[Margus (city)|Margus]] ([[Požarevac]]), all seated on horseback in the Hunnic manner,<ref name=Howarth /> and negotiated a successful [[Treaty of Margus|treaty]]. The Romans agreed to return the fugitives, to double their previous [[tribute]] of 350 Roman pounds (c.&nbsp;115&nbsp;kg) of gold, to open their markets to Hunnish traders, and to pay a ransom of eight ''[[solidus (coin)|solidi]]'' for each Roman taken prisoner by the Huns. The Huns, satisfied with the treaty, decamped from the Roman Empire and returned to their home in the [[Great Hungarian Plain]], perhaps to consolidate and strengthen their empire. Theodosius used this opportunity to strengthen the [[walls of Constantinople]], building the city's first [[sea wall]], and to build up his border defenses along the [[Danube]].

The Huns remained out of Roman sight for the next few years while they invaded the [[Sassanid Empire]]. They were defeated in [[Armenia]] by the Sassanids, abandoned their invasion, and turned their attentions back to Europe. In 440, they reappeared in force on the borders of the Roman Empire, attacking the merchants at the market on the north bank of the Danube that had been established by the treaty.

Crossing the Danube, they laid waste to the cities of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] and forts on the river, including (according to [[Priscus]]) [[Viminacium]], a city of [[Moesia]]. Their advance began at Margus, where they demanded that the Romans turn over a bishop who had retained property that Attila regarded as his. While the Romans discussed the bishop's fate, he slipped away secretly to the Huns and betrayed the city to them.

While the Huns attacked city-states along the Danube, the [[Vandals]] (led by [[Geiseric]]) captured the Western Roman province of Africa and its capital of [[Carthage]]. Carthage was the richest province of the Western Empire and a main source of food for Rome. The [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] [[Shah]] [[Yazdegerd II of Persia|Yazdegerd&nbsp;II]] invaded [[Armenia]] in 441.

The Romans stripped the Balkan area of forces, sending them to Sicily in order to mount an expedition against the Vandals in Africa. This left Attila and Bleda a clear path through Illyricum into the Balkans, which they invaded in 441. The Hunnish army sacked Margus and Viminacium, and then took [[Singidunum]] ([[Belgrade]]) and [[Sirmium]]. During 442, Theodosius recalled his troops from [[Sicily]] and ordered a large issue of new coins to finance operations against the Huns. He believed that he could defeat the Huns and refused the Hunnish kings' demands.

Attila responded with a campaign in 443.<ref name=Dupuy /> The Huns were equipped with new military weapons as they advanced along the Danube, such as [[battering ram]]s and rolling siege towers, and they overran the military centers of Ratiara and successfully besieged Naissus ([[Niš]]).

Advancing along the [[Nišava|Nišava River]], the Huns next took Serdica ([[Sofia]]), Philippopolis ([[Plovdiv]]), and Arcadiopolis ([[Lüleburgaz]]). They encountered and destroyed a Roman army outside Constantinople but were stopped by the double walls of the Eastern capital. They defeated a second army near Callipolis ([[Gelibolu]]).

Theodosius, stripped of his armed forces, admitted defeat, sending the ''[[magister militum|Magister militum per Orientem]]'' [[Anatolius (consul 440)|Anatolius]] to negotiate peace terms. The terms were harsher than the previous treaty: the Emperor agreed to hand over 6,000 Roman pounds (c. 2000&nbsp;kg) of gold as punishment for having disobeyed the terms of the treaty during the invasion; the yearly tribute was tripled, rising to 2,100 Roman pounds (c. 700&nbsp;kg) in gold; and the ransom for each Roman prisoner rose to 12 ''solidi''.

Their demands were met for a time, and the Hun kings withdrew into the interior of their empire.  Bleda died following the Huns' withdrawal from Byzantium (probably around 445). Attila then took the throne for himself, becoming the sole ruler of the Huns.<ref name=Haas />

== Solitary kingship ==
[[File:MorThanFeastofAttila.jpg|thumb|right|325px|[[Mór Than]]'s painting ''The Feast of Attila'', based on a fragment of [[Priscus]]]]

In 447, Attila again rode south into the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] through [[Moesia]]. The [[Roman military history|Roman army]], under [[Goths|Gothic]] ''[[magister militum]]'' Arnegisclus, met him in the [[Battle of the Utus]] and was defeated, though not without inflicting heavy losses. The Huns were left unopposed and rampaged through the Balkans as far as [[Thermopylae]].

Constantinople itself was saved by the [[Isauria]]n troops of ''[[magister militum per Orientem]]'' [[Zeno (consul 448)|Zeno]] and protected by the intervention of prefect [[Constantinus (consul 457)|Constantinus]], who organized the reconstruction of the walls that had been previously damaged by earthquakes and, in some places, to construct a new line of fortification in front of the old. An account of this invasion survives:

{{quote|The barbarian nation of the Huns, which was in [[Thrace]], became so great that more than a hundred cities were captured and Constantinople almost came into danger and most men fled from it.&nbsp;... And there were so many murders and blood-lettings that the dead could not be numbered. Ay, for they took captive the churches and monasteries and slew the monks and maidens in great numbers.|Callinicus, in his ''Life of Saint Hypatius''}}

== In the west ==
[[File:Attila in Gaul 451CE.svg|thumb|300px|left|The general path of the Hun forces in the invasion of [[Gaul]]]]

In 450, Attila proclaimed his intent to attack the [[Visigoth]] kingdom of [[Toulouse]] by making an [[military alliance|alliance]] with Emperor [[Valentinian III|Valentinian&nbsp;III]]. He had previously been on good terms with the [[Western Roman Empire]] and its influential general [[Flavius Aetius|Flavius Aëtius]]. Aëtius had spent a brief [[exile]] among the Huns in 433, and the troops that Attila provided against the [[Goths]] and [[Bagaudae]] had helped earn him the largely honorary title of ''[[magister militum]]'' in the west. The gifts and diplomatic efforts of [[Geiseric]], who opposed and feared the Visigoths, may also have influenced Attila's plans.

However, Valentinian's sister was [[Justa Grata Honoria|Honoria]], who had sent the Hunnish king a plea for help — and her engagement ring — in order to escape her forced betrothal to a [[Roman Senate|Roman senator]] in the spring of 450. Honoria may not have intended a proposal of marriage, but Attila chose to interpret her message as such. He accepted, asking for half of the western Empire as dowry.

When Valentinian discovered the plan, only the influence of his mother [[Galla Placidia]] convinced him to exile Honoria, rather than killing her. He also wrote to Attila, strenuously denying the legitimacy of the supposed marriage proposal. Attila sent an emissary to [[Ravenna]] to proclaim that Honoria was innocent, that the proposal had been legitimate, and that he would come to claim what was rightfully his.

[[File:AttilatheHunonhorsebackbyGeorgeSStuart.jpg|thumb|170px|Attila the Hun on horseback by [[George S. Stuart|George&nbsp;S. Stuart]]]]
Attila interfered in a succession struggle after the death of a Frankish ruler. Attila supported the elder son, while Aëtius supported the younger. (The location and identity of these kings is not known and subject to conjecture.) Attila gathered his [[vassal]]s—[[Gepids]], [[Ostrogoths]], [[Rugians]], [[Scirians]], [[Heruls]], [[Thuringians]], [[Alans]], [[Burgundians]], among others–and began his march west. In 451, he arrived in [[Belgica]] with an army exaggerated by [[Jordanes]] to half a million strong. [[J. B. Bury]] believes that Attila's intent, by the time he marched west, was to extend his kingdom—already the strongest on the continent—across [[Gaul]] to the Atlantic Ocean.<ref name=Bury />

On April&nbsp;7, he captured [[Metz]]. Other cities attacked can be determined by the [[hagiographic]] ''[[biography|vitae]]'' written to commemorate their bishops: [[Nicasius of Rheims|Nicasius]] was slaughtered before the altar of his church in [[Rheims]]; [[Servatus]] is alleged to have saved [[Tongeren]] with his prayers, as Saint [[Genevieve]] is said to have saved Paris.<ref name=Hodgkin /> [[Lupus of Troyes|Lupus]], bishop of [[Troyes]], is also credited with saving his city by meeting Attila in person.<ref name=CEnAttila /><ref name=CEnTroyes />

Aëtius moved to oppose Attila, gathering troops from among the [[Franks]], the [[Burgundians]], and the [[Celts]]. A mission by [[Avitus]] and Attila's continued westward advance convinced the Visigoth king [[Theodoric I|Theodoric&nbsp;I]] (Theodorid) to ally with the Romans. The combined armies reached [[Orléans]] ahead of Attila, thus checking and turning back the Hunnish advance. (Later accounts of the battle report that the Huns were either already within the city or in the midst of storming it when the Roman-Visigoth army arrived; Jordanes mentions no such thing.)<ref name=Bury /> Aëtius gave chase and caught the Huns at a place usually assumed to be near Catalaunum (modern [[Châlons-en-Champagne]]).

The two armies clashed in the [[Battle of Châlons]], whose outcome is commonly considered to be a strategic victory for the Visigothic-Roman alliance. Theodoric was killed in the fighting and Aëtius failed to press his advantage, according to Edward Gibbon and Edward Creasy, because he feared the consequences of an overwhelming Visigothic triumph as much as he did a defeat. From Aëtius' point of view, the best outcome was what occurred: Theodoric died, Attila was in retreat and disarray, and the Romans had the benefit of appearing victorious.

== Invasion of Italy and death ==
[[File:Leoattila-Raphael.jpg|thumb|325px|right|[[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]]'s ''The Meeting between Leo the Great and Attila'' depicts Leo, escorted by [[Saint Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]], meeting with the [[Hun]] king outside Rome]]

Attila returned in 452 to renew his marriage claim with Honoria, invading and ravaging Italy along the way. The city of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] was founded as a result of these attacks when the residents fled to small islands in the [[Venetian Lagoon]]. His army sacked numerous cities and razed [[Sack of Aquileia|Aquileia]] so completely that it was afterwards hard to recognize its original site.<ref name=Thompson />{{rp|159}}

Legend has it that he had his soldiers carry dirt in their helmets to build a hill north of Aquileia from which he could watch the destruction of the city, thus founding the town of [[Udine]], where a [[Udine castle|castle]] now stands on the legendary hill.<ref name=Udine /> Aëtius lacked the strength to offer battle, but managed to harass and slow Attila's advance with only a shadow force. Attila finally halted at the [[Po River|River Po]]. By this point, disease and starvation may have taken hold in Attila's camp, thus helping to stop his invasion.

Emperor [[Valentinian III|Valentinian&nbsp;III]] sent three envoys, the high civilian officers [[Gennadius Avienus]] and Trigetius, as well as the Bishop of Rome [[Pope Leo I|Leo&nbsp;I]], who met Attila at [[Mincio]] in the vicinity of [[Mantua]] and obtained from him the promise that he would withdraw from Italy and negotiate peace with the Emperor.<ref name=CEnLeoI /> [[Prosper of Aquitaine]] gives a short description of the historic meeting, but gives all the credit to Leo for the successful negotiation. [[Priscus]] reports that superstitious fear of the fate of [[Alaric I|Alaric]] gave him pause - as Alaric died shortly after sacking Rome in 410.

In reality, Italy had suffered from a terrible famine in 451 and her crops were faring little better in 452; Attila's devastating invasion of the plains of northern Italy this year did not improve the harvest.<ref name=Thompson />{{rp|161}} To advance on Rome would have required supplies which were not available in Italy, and taking the city would not have improved Attila's supply situation. Therefore, it was more profitable for Attila to conclude peace and retreat back to his homeland.<ref name=Thompson />{{rp|160–161}}

Furthermore, an East Roman force had crossed the Danube under the command of another officer also named Aetius—who had participated in the [[Council of Chalcedon]] the previous year—and proceeded to defeat the Huns who had been left behind by Attila to safeguard their home territories. Attila, hence, faced heavy human and natural pressures to retire "from Italy without ever setting foot south of the [[Po (river)|Po]]."<ref name=Thompson />{{rp|163}} As [[Hydatius]] writes in his ''Chronica Minora'':
{{quote|The Huns, who had been plundering Italy and who had also stormed a number of cities, were victims of divine punishment, being visited with heaven-sent disasters: famine and some kind of disaster. In addition, they were slaughtered by auxiliaries sent by the Emperor [[Marcian]] and led by Aetius, at the same time, they were crushed in their [home] settlements&nbsp;... Thus crushed, they made peace with the Romans and all retired to their homes.|Hydatius|Chron Min.'' II pp.&nbsp;26ff''}}

[[File:Ulpiano Checa La invasión de los bárbaros.jpg|thumb|325px|left|The Huns, led by Attila, invade Italy (''Attila, the Scourge of God'', by [[Ulpiano Checa]], 1887).]]

===Death===
Marcian was the successor of Theodosius, and he had ceased paying tribute to the Huns in late 450 while Attila was occupied in the west. Multiple invasions by the Huns and others had left the Balkans with little to plunder. After Attila left Italy and returned to his palace across the Danube, he planned to strike at Constantinople again and reclaim the tribute which Marcian had stopped. However, he died in the early months of 453.

The conventional account from Priscus says that Attila was at a feast celebrating his latest marriage, this time to the beautiful young Ildico. (The name suggests [[Goths|Gothic]] or [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogoth]] origins, if it is uncorrupted.)<ref name=Thompson />{{rp|164}} In the midst of the revels, however, he suffered a severe [[Epistaxis|nosebleed]] and choked to death in a stupor. An alternative theory is that he succumbed to [[internal bleeding]] after heavy drinking, possibly a condition called [[esophageal varices]], where dilated veins in the lower part of the [[esophagus]] rupture leading to death by hemorrhage.<ref name=Man />

Another account of his death was first recorded 80 years after the events by Roman chronicler [[Marcellinus Comes]]. It reports that "Attila, King of the Huns and ravager of the provinces of Europe, was pierced by the hand and blade of his wife."<ref name=Chadwick /> The ''[[Volsunga saga]]''<ref name=Volsunga /> and the ''[[Poetic Edda]]''<ref name=Atlakvitha /> also claim that King Atli (Attila) died at the hands of his wife Gudrun. Most scholars reject these accounts as no more than hearsay, preferring instead the account given by Attila's contemporary Priscus. Priscus' version, however, has recently come under renewed scrutiny by Michael A. Babcock.<ref name=Babcock /> Based on detailed [[Philology|philological]] analysis, Babcock concludes that the account of natural death given by Priscus was an ecclesiastical "cover story," and that Emperor Marcian (who ruled the Eastern Roman Empire from 450 to 457) was the political force behind Attila's death.

[[Jordanes]] says: "The greatest of all warriors should be mourned with no feminine lamentations and with no tears, but with the blood of men." His horsemen galloped in circles around the silken tent where Attila lay in state, singing his [[dirge]], according to [[Cassiodorus]] and Jordanes: "Who can rate this as death, when none believes it calls for vengeance?"

Then they celebrated a ''strava'' (lamentation) over his burial place with great feasting. Legend says that he was laid to rest in a triple coffin made of gold, silver, and iron, along with some of the spoils of his conquests. His men diverted a section of the river, buried the coffin under the riverbed, and then were killed to keep the exact location a secret.

His sons [[Ellac]] (his appointed successor), [[Dengizich]], and [[Ernakh]] fought over the division of his legacy, specifically which vassal kings would belong to which brother. As a consequence, they were divided, defeated, and scattered the following year by a Germanic alliance led by the [[Gepids|Gepid]] [[Ardaric]] (who had been Attila's most prized chieftain) in the [[Battle of Nedao]]. Attila's successor and son Ellac was killed in that battle. Ellac's successor Dengizich attempted a renewed invasion across the Danube in 468 AD, but was defeated at the [[Battle of Bassianae]] by Ostrogothic king [[Valamir]]. Dengizich was killed by Roman-Gothic general [[Anagast]] the following year, after which the Hunnic Empire ended.

Attila's many children and relatives are known by name and some even by deeds, but soon valid genealogical sources all but dried up, and there seems to be no verifiable way to trace Attila's descendants. This has not stopped many genealogists from attempting to reconstruct a [[descent from antiquity|valid line of descent]] for various medieval rulers. One of the most credible claims has been that of the Khans of [[Bulgaria]] (see [[Nominalia of the Bulgarian khans]]). A popular but unconfirmed genealogical theory attempts to relate Attila to [[Charlemagne]].

== Later folklore and iconography ==
{{further|Attila the Hun in popular culture}}

Attila himself is said to have claimed the titles "Descendant of the Great [[Nimrod]]", and "King of the Huns, the Goths, the [[Danes]], and the [[Medes]]"—the last two peoples being mentioned to show the extent of his control over subject nations even on the peripheries of his domain.<ref name=Creasy />

[[Jordanes]] embellished the report of [[Priscus]], reporting that Attila had possessed the "Holy War Sword of the [[Scythians]]", which was given to him by [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] and made him a "prince of the entire world."<ref name=Geary /><ref name=Oakeshott />

Attila was the standard source of legitimacy on the European steppe until [[Genghis Khan]]. By the end of the 12th century the royal court of Hungary proclaimed their descent from Attila. [[Lampert of Hersfeld]]'s contemporary chronicles report that shortly before the year 1071, the [[Sword of Attila]] had been presented to [[Otto of Nordheim]] by the exiled queen of Hungary, [[Anastasia of Kiev]].<ref name=Rona /> This sword, a cavalry [[sabre]] now in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in Vienna, appears to be the work of Hungarian goldsmiths of the ninth or tenth century.<ref name=Fillitz />

[[File:Attila-PopeLeo-ChroniconPictum.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Illustration of the meeting between Attila and Pope Leo from the [[Chronicon Pictum]], c.&nbsp;1360]]
An anonymous chronicler of the medieval period represented the meeting of Pope Leo and Atilla as attended also by [[Saint Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]], "a miraculous tale calculated to meet the taste of the time."<ref name=Fordham /> This apotheosis was later portrayed artistically by the Renaissance artist [[Raphael]] and sculptor [[Algardi]], whom eighteenth-century historian [[Edward Gibbon]] praised for establishing “one of the noblest legends of ecclesiastical tradition.” <ref name=Gibbon />

According to a version of this narrative related in the [[Chronicon Pictum]], a mediaeval Hungarian chronicle, the Pope promised Attila that if he left Rome in peace, one of his successors would receive a holy crown (which has been understood as referring to the [[Holy Crown of Hungary]]).

[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - Atilla, King of the Huns (CXXXVII).jpg|thumb|150px|right|Attila in the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]] (1493)]]
Some histories and chronicles describe him as a great and noble king, and he plays major roles in three Norse [[sagas]]: ''[[Atlakviða]]'',<ref name=Atlakvitha /> ''[[Volsunga saga|Völsungasaga]]'',<ref name=Volsunga /> and ''[[Atlamál]]''.<ref name=Atlamol /> The ''Polish Chronicle'' represents Attila's name as ''Aquila''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

[[Frutolf of Michelsberg]] and [[Otto of Freising]] pointed out that some songs as "vulgar fables" made [[Theoderic the Great]], Attila and [[Ermanaric]] contemporaries, when any reader of Jordanes knew that [[anachronism|this was not the case]].<ref name=Innes />

In 1812, [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] conceived the idea of writing an opera about Attila and approached [[August von Kotzebue]] to write the libretto. It was, however, never written.<ref name=Thayer />

In World War&nbsp;I, Allied propaganda referred to Germans as the "[[List of terms used for Germans#Hun|Huns]]", based on a 1900 speech by [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Emperor Wilhelm&nbsp;II]] praising Attila the Hun's military prowess, according to [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]'s ''[[Glimpses of World History]]''.<ref name=Nehru />

''[[Der Spiegel]]'' commented on November 6, 1948, that the [[Sword of Attila]] was hanging menacingly over [[Austria]].<ref name=DerSpiegel />

American writer [[Cecelia Holland]] wrote ''The Death of Attila'' (1973), a historical novel in which Attila appears as a powerful background figure whose life and death deeply impact the protagonists, a young Hunnic warrior and a Germanic one.

In modern Hungary and in Turkey, "Attila" and its Turkish variation "Atilla" are commonly used as a male first name. In Hungary, several public places are named after Attila; for instance, in [[Budapest]] there are 10 Attila Streets, one of which is an important street behind the [[Buda Castle]]. When the [[Turkish Armed Forces]] invaded [[Cyprus]] in 1974, the operations were named after Attila ("The Attila Plan").<ref name=Martin />

The 1954 [[Universal International]] film ''[[Sign of the Pagan]]'' starred [[Jack Palance]] as Attila.

The stressed back syllabic ''til'' (= ''t il'') assimilated the front member ''es'', so it became *''as''. The consonantic sequence s-t (''a<u>s</u> <u>t</u>il-'') became, due to metathesis, ''t-s'', which by assimilation resulted in ''tt''. In 1981 I was able to establish a Danube-Bulgarian nominative-suffix /A/ from the consonantic stems. Recalling that Danube-Bulgarian was a Hunnic language, I can now add to the data in the article of 1955 the following: the Hunnic title ''attíla'' is a nominative, (in /A/) form of ''attíl-'' (< *''etsíl'' < *''es tíl'') with the meaning "the oceanic, universal [ruler];" cf. the title of the Pečeneg ruler Куря, i.e., ''Kür+ä'', meaning "universal" (cf. no.&nbsp;3).}}&nbsp;(p.&nbsp;444.)</ref>
