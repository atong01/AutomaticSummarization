Another element of horse mounted warfare is the psychological impact a mounted soldier can inflict on an opponent.</paragraph><paragraph>The speed, mobility and shock value of the cavalry was greatly appreciated and exploited in armed forces in the Ancient and Middle Ages; some forces were mostly cavalry, particularly in nomadic societies of Asia, notably the Mongol armies.

During the 17th century cavalry in Europe lost most of its armor, ineffective against the muskets and cannon which were coming into use, and by the mid-19th century armor had mainly fallen into disuse, although some regiments retained a small thickened<space/><link><target>cuirass</target></link><space/>that offered protection against lances and sabres and some protection against shot.</paragraph><paragraph>In the<space/><link><target>Interwar period</target><part>period</part></link><space/>between the<space/><link><target>World war</target><part>World Wars</part></link>, many cavalry units were converted into<space/><link><target>motorized infantry</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>mechanized infantry</target></link><space/>units, or reformed as tank troops.

Most cavalry units that are horse-mounted in modern armies serve in purely ceremonial roles, or as mounted infantry in difficult terrain such as mountains or heavily forested areas.

Fighting from the back of a horse was much more difficult than mere riding. The cavalry acted in pairs; the reins of the mounted archer were controlled by his neighbour's hand. Even at this early time, cavalry used swords, shields, and bows. The sculpture implies two types of cavalry, but this might be a simplification by the artist. Later images of Assyrian cavalry show saddle cloths as primitive saddles, allowing each archer to control his own horse.</paragraph><paragraph>As early as 490 BC a breed of large horses was bred in the Nisaean plain in Media to carry men with increasing amounts of armour (Herodotus 7,40 &amp; 9,20). But large horses were still very exceptional at this time. Excepting a few ineffective attempts to revive<space/><link><target>scythed chariot</target><trail>s</trail></link>, and continuing far eastern use, the use of chariots in battle was obsolete in civilized nations by the time of the Persian defeat at the hands of<space/><link><target>Alexander the Great</target></link>, but chariots remained in use for ceremonial purposes such as carrying the victorious general in a<space/><link><target>Roman triumph</target></link>, or for racing.

Three types of cavalry became common: light cavalry, whose riders, armed with javelins, could harass and skirmish; heavy cavalry, whose troopers, using lances, had the ability to close with their opponents; and finally those whose equipment allowed them to fight either on horseback or foot. The role of horsemen did however remain secondary to that of the<space/><link><target>hoplites</target></link><space/>or heavy infantry who comprised the main strength of the citizen levies of the various city states.</paragraph><paragraph>Cavalry played a relatively minor role in<space/><link><target>Ancient Greece</target><part>ancient Greek</part></link><space/><link><target>city-states</target></link>, with conflicts decided by massed armored infantry.

The<space/><link><target>Athens</target><part>Athenian</part></link><space/>author and soldier<space/><link><target>Xenophon</target></link><space/>in particular advocated the creation of a small but well-trained cavalry force; to that end, he wrote several manuals on horsemanship and cavalry operations.</paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>Macedon</target><trail>ian</trail></link><space/>Kingdom in the north, on the other hand, developed a strong cavalry force that culminated in the<space/><italics>hetairoi</italics><space/>(<link><target>Companion cavalry</target></link>) of Philip II of Macedon and<space/><link><target>Alexander the Great</target></link>. In addition to these heavy cavalry, the Macedonian army also employed lighter horsemen called<space/><link><target>prodromoi</target></link><space/>for scouting and screening, as well as the<space/><link><target>Macedonian phalanx</target><part>Macedonian pike phalanx</part></link><space/>and various kinds of<space/><link><target>light infantry</target></link>. There were also the<space/><italics>Ippiko</italics><space/>(or &quot;Horserider&quot;), Greek &quot;heavy&quot; cavalry, armed with kontos (or cavalry lance), and sword. These wore leather armour or mail plus a helmet. They were medium rather than heavy cavalry, meaning that they were better suited to be scouts, skirmishers, and pursuers rather than front line fighters. This combination of cavalry and infantry helped to break enemy lines and were used effectively to dominate the opponents of the kingdom.</paragraph><paragraph>The effectiveness of this combined-arms system was most dramatically demonstrated in Alexander's conquest of<space/><link><target>Persia</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Bactria</target></link>, and northwestern India.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Roman Republic and Early Empire</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Roman cavalry</arg></template><link><target>File:Kln Reitergrabmal.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>upright</part><part>right</part><part>Tombstone of a Roman auxiliary trooper from Cologne, Germany.

The most notable of these was the<space/><link><target>Battle of Cannae</target></link>, when he inflicted a catastrophic defeat on the Romans.

This does not mean that its utility should be underestimated, as its strategic role in scouting, skirmishing, and outpost duties was crucial to the Romans' capability to conduct operations over long distances in hostile or unfamiliar territory. On some occasions Roman cavalry also proved its ability to strike a decisive tactical blow against a weakened or unprepared enemy, such as the final charge at the<space/><link><target>Battle of Aquilonia</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>After defeats such as the<space/><link><target>Battle of Carrhae</target></link>, the Romans learned the importance of large cavalry formations from the<space/><link><target>Parthian Empire</target><part>Parthians</part></link>.

Medieval military doctrine employed them as part of a combined-arms force along with various kinds of foot troops; however medieval chroniclers tended to pay undue attention to the knights at the expense of the rank and file, which led early students of military history to suppose that this heavy cavalry was the only force that mattered on medieval European battlefields, which was not the case.</paragraph><paragraph>Massed English longbowmen triumphed over French cavalry at<space/><link><target>Battle of Crcy</target><part>Crcy</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Battle of Poitiers (1356)</target><part>Poitiers</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Battle of Agincourt</target><part>Agincourt</part></link>, while at<space/><link><target>Battle of Gisors</target><part>Gisors</part></link><space/>(1188),<space/><link><target>Battle of Bannockburn</target><part>Bannockburn</part></link><space/>(1314), and<space/><link><target>Battle of Laupen</target><part>Laupen</part></link><space/>(1339), foot-soldiers proved their invulnerability to cavalry charges as long as they held their formation. Once the<space/><link><target>Switzerland</target><part>Swiss</part></link><space/>developed their<space/><link><target>pike square</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>for offensive as well as defensive use, infantry started to become the principal arm. This aggressive new doctrine gave the Swiss victory over a range of adversaries, and their enemies found that the only reliable way to defeat them was by the use of an even more comprehensive<space/><link><target>combined arms</target></link><space/>doctrine, as evidenced in the<space/><link><target>Battle of Marignano</target></link>. The introduction of missile weapons that required less skill than the longbow, such as the<space/><link><target>crossbow</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>hand cannon</target></link>, also helped remove the focus somewhat from cavalry elites to masses of cheap infantry equipped with easy-to-learn weapons. These missile weapons were very successfully used in the<space/><link><target>Hussite Wars</target></link>, in combination with<space/><link><target>Wagenburg</target></link><space/>tactics.</paragraph><paragraph>This gradual rise in the dominance of infantry led to the adoption of dismounted tactics. From the earliest times knights and mounted men-at-arms had frequently dismounted to handle enemies they could not overcome on horseback, such as in the<space/><link><target>Battle of the Dyle</target></link><space/>(891) and the<space/><link><target>Battle of Bremule</target></link><space/>(1119), but after the 1350s this trend became more marked with the dismounted men-at-arms fighting as super-heavy infantry with two-handed<space/><link><target>sword</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>poleaxe</target><trail>s</trail></link>. In any case, warfare in the Middle Ages tended to be dominated by raids and sieges rather than pitched battles, and mounted men-at-arms rarely had any choice other than dismounting when faced with the prospect of assaulting a fortified position.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Renaissance Europe</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Retable de l'Agneau mystique (8).jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>Knighted cavalry and noblemen, painting by<space/><link><target>Jan van Eyck</target></link><space/>(c. 1390-1441).</part></link>Ironically, the rise of infantry in the early 16th century coincided with the &quot;golden age&quot; of heavy cavalry; a French or Spanish army at the beginning of the century could have up to half its numbers made up of various kinds of light and heavy cavalry, whereas in earlier medieval and later 17th-century armies the proportion of cavalry was seldom more than a quarter.</paragraph><paragraph>Knighthood largely lost its military functions and became more closely tied to social and economic prestige in an increasingly capitalistic Western society.

There was a general reduction in the number of cavalry regiments in the British, French, Italian and other Western armies but it was still argued with conviction (for example in the 1922 edition of the<space/><italics><link><target>Encyclopdia Britannica</target></link></italics>) that mounted troops had a major role to play in future warfare. The 1920s saw an interim period during which cavalry remained as a proud and conspicuous element of all major armies, though much less so than prior to 1914.</paragraph><paragraph>Cavalry was extensively used in the<space/><link><target>Russian Civil War</target></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>Soviet-Polish War</target></link>. The last major cavalry battle was the<space/><link><target>Battle of Komarw</target></link><space/>in 1920, between Poland and the Russian Bolsheviks. Colonial warfare in Morocco, Syria, the Middle East and the<space/><link><target>North-West Frontier Province (19011955)</target><part>North West Frontier</part></link><space/>of India provided some opportunities for mounted action against enemies lacking advanced weaponry.<link><target>File:Lietuvos kavalerija.Lithuanian cavalry.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>upright=1.5</part><part><link><target>Lithuania</target><trail>n</trail></link><space/>lancers training in the 1930s</part></link>The post-war German Army (<link><target>Reichsheer</target></link>) was permitted a large proportion of cavalry (18 regiments or 16.4% of total manpower) under the conditions of the<space/><link><target>Treaty of Versailles</target></link>. The U.S. Cavalry abandoned its sabres in 1934 and commenced the conversion of its horsed regiments to mechanized cavalry, starting with the First Regiment of Cavalry in January 1933.</paragraph><paragraph>In the<space/><link><target>British Army</target></link>, all cavalry regiments were mechanised between 1929 and 1941, redefining their role from horse to armoured vehicles to form the<space/><link><target>Royal Armoured Corps</target></link><space/>together with the<space/><link><target>Royal Tank Regiment</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>The thirty-nine regiments of the<space/><link><target>British Indian Army</target></link><space/>were reduced to twenty-one as the result of a series of amalgamations immediately following World War I. The new establishment remained unchanged until 1936 when three regiments were redesignated as permanent training units, each with six, still mounted, regiments linked to them. In 1938 the process of mechanism began with the conversion of a full cavalry brigade (two Indian regiments and one British) to armoured car and tank units. By the end of 1940 all of the Indian cavalry had been mechanised, receiving light tanks, armoured cars or 15cwt trucks. The last horsed regiment of the Indian Army (other than the Viceregal Bodyguard and some Indian States Forces regiments) was the 19th King George's Own Lancers which had its last mounted parade at Rawalpindi on 28 October 1939. This unit still exists (though in the Pakistan Army) with an armour TOE.</paragraph><paragraph>During the 1930s the French Army experimented with integrating mounted and mechanised cavalry units into larger formations. Dragoon regiments were converted to motorised infantry (trucks and motor cycles), and cuirassiers to armoured units; while light cavalry (Chasseurs a' Cheval, Hussars and Spahis) remained as mounted sabre squadrons. The theory was that mixed forces comprising these diverse units could utilise the strengths of each according to circumstances. In practice mounted troops proved unable to keep up with fast moving mechanised units over any distance.</paragraph><heading level='3'>World War II cavalry</heading><paragraph>While most armies still maintained cavalry units at the outbreak of World War II in 1939, significant mounted action was largely restricted to the Polish, Balkan and Soviet campaigns.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Polish</heading><paragraph>A popular myth is that<space/><link><target>Polish cavalry</target></link><space/>armed with lances charged German tanks during the September 1939 campaign.

Another myth describes Polish cavalry as being armed with both sabres and lances; lances were used for peacetime ceremonial purposes only and the primary weapon of the Polish cavalryman in 1939 was a rifle. Individual equipment did include a sabre, probably because of well-established tradition, but in the case of a melee combat this secondary weapon would probably be more effective than a rifle and bayonet. Moreover, the<space/><link><target>Polish cavalry brigade order of battle in 1939</target></link><space/>included, apart from the mounted soldiers themselves, light and heavy machine guns (wheeled),<space/><link><target>Anti-tank rifle, model 35</target></link>, anti-aircraft weapon, artillery like<space/><link><target>Bofors 37 mm</target></link><space/>anti tank gun or light and scout tanks, etc. The last cavalry vs. cavalry mutual charge in Europe took place in Poland during the<space/><link><target>battle of Krasnobrod</target></link>, when Polish and German cavalry units clashed with each other.</paragraph><paragraph>The last classical cavalry charge of the war was that made on March 1, 1945 during the<space/><link><target>Battle of Schoenfeld</target></link><space/>by the 1st &quot;Warsaw&quot; Independent Cavalry Brigade. Infantry and tanks had been employed to little effect against the German position, both of which floundered in the open wetlands only to be dominated by infantry and antitank fire from the German fortifications on the forward slope of Hill 157, overlooking the wetlands. The Germans had not taken cavalry into consideration when fortifying their position which, combined with the &quot;Warsaw&quot;s swift assault, overran the German anti-tank guns and consolidated into an attack into the village itself, now supported by infantry and tanks.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Greek</heading><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>Italian invasion of Greece</target></link><space/>in October 1940 saw mounted cavalry used effectively by the Greek defenders along the mountainous frontier with Albania.

Armoured cavalry such as the<space/><link><target>Byzantine Empire</target><part>Byzantine</part></link><space/><link><target>cataphract</target></link><space/>were used as shock troopsthey would charge the main body of the enemy and, in many cases, their actions decided the outcome of the battle, hence the later term &quot;battle cavalry&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref'>p.490, Lynn</extension></paragraph><paragraph>During the<space/><link><target>Gunpowder warfare</target><part>Gunpowder Age</part></link>, armored cavalry become obsolete. However, many units retained<space/><link><target>cuirass</target><trail>es</trail></link><space/>and helmets for their protective value against<space/><link><target>sword</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>bayonet</target></link><space/>strikes and the morale boost these provide to the wearers. By this time the main difference between light and battle cavalry was their training; the former was regarded as a tool for harassment and reconnaissance, while the latter was considered best for close-order charges.</paragraph><paragraph>Since the development of armored warfare the distinction between light and heavy armor has persisted basically along the same lines.<space/><link><target>Armored car (military)</target><part>Armored car</part><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>light tank</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>have adopted the<space/><link><target>reconnaissance</target></link><space/>role while medium and heavy tanks are regarded as the decisive<space/><link><target>shock troops</target></link>.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Social status</heading><paragraph>From the beginning of civilization to the 20th century, ownership of heavy cavalry horses has been a mark of wealth amongst settled peoples. A cavalry horse involves considerable expense in breeding, training, feeding, and equipment, and has very little productive use except as a mode of transport.</paragraph><paragraph>For this reason, and because of their often decisive military role, the cavalry has typically been associated with high<space/><link><target>social status</target></link>. This was most clearly seen in the<space/><link><target>Feudalism</target><part>feudal system</part></link>, where a lord was expected to enter combat armored and on horseback and bring with him an entourage of<space/><link><target>peasants</target></link><space/>on foot. If landlords and peasants came into conflict, the peasants would be ill-equipped to defeat armored knights.</paragraph><paragraph>In later national armies, service as an officer in the cavalry was generally a badge of high social status. For instance prior to 1914 most officers of British cavalry regiments came from a socially privileged background and the considerable expenses associated with their role generally required private means, even after it became possible for officers of the line infantry regiments to live on their pay. Options open to poorer cavalry officers in the various European armies included service with less fashionable (though often highly professional) frontier or colonial units. These included the British Indian cavalry, the Russian<space/><link><target>Cossacks</target></link><space/>or the French<space/><link><target>Chasseurs d' Afrique</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>During the 19th and early 20th centuries most monarchies maintained a mounted cavalry element in their royal or imperial guards. These ranged from small units providing ceremonial escorts and palace guards through to large formations intended for active service. The mounted escort of the Spanish Royal Household provided an example of the former and the twelve cavalry regiments of the Prussian Imperial Guard an example of the latter. In either case the officers of such units were likely to be drawn from the aristocracies of their respective societies.</paragraph><heading level='2'>On film</heading><paragraph>Some small sense of the noise and power of a cavalry charge can be gained from the 1970 film<space/><italics><link><target>Waterloo (1970 film)</target><part>Waterloo</part></link></italics>, which featured some 2000 cavalrymen,<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">February 2008</arg></template><space/>some of them cossacks.
