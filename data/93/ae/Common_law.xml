For we know that the common law is that system of law which was introduced by the Saxons on their settlement in England, and altered from time to time by proper legislative authority from that time to the date of Magna Carta, which terminates the period of the common law, or lex non scripta, and commences that of the statute law, or Lex Scripta.

Judge Cardozo held:</paragraph><paragraph><template><target>quote</target><arg>It may be that Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co. have extended the rule of Thomas v. Winchester. If so, this court is committed to the extension. The defendant argues that things imminently dangerous to life are poisons, explosives, deadly weapons—things whose normal function it is to injure or destroy. But whatever the rule in Thomas v. Winchester may once have been, it has no longer that restricted meaning. A scaffold (Devlin v. Smith, supra) is not inherently a destructive instrument. It becomes destructive only if imperfectly constructed. A large coffee urn (Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co., supra) may have within itself, if negligently made, the potency of danger, yet no one thinks of it as an implement whose normal function is destruction. What is true of the coffee urn is equally true of bottles of aerated water (Torgeson v. Schultz, 192 N. Y. 156). We have mentioned only cases in this court. But the rule has received a like extension in our courts of intermediate appeal. In Burke v. Ireland (26 App. Div. 487), in an opinion by CULLEN, J., it was applied to a builder who constructed a defective building; in Kahner v. Otis Elevator Co. (96 App. Div. 169) to the manufacturer of an elevator; in Davies v. Pelham Hod Elevating Co. (65 Hun, 573; affirmed in this court without opinion, 146 N. Y. 363) to a contractor who furnished a defective rope with knowledge of the purpose for which the rope was to be used. We are not required at this time either to approve or to disapprove the application of the rule that was made in these cases. It is enough that they help to characterize the trend of judicial thought.

We hold, then, that the principle of ''Thomas v. Winchester'' is not limited to poisons, explosives, and things of like nature, to things which in their normal operation are implements of destruction. If the nature of a thing is such that it is reasonably certain to place life and limb in peril when negligently made, it is then a thing of danger. Its nature gives warning of the consequences to be expected. If to the element of danger there is added knowledge that the thing will be used by persons other than the purchaser, and used without new tests then, irrespective of contract, the manufacturer of this thing of danger is under a duty to make it carefully. ... There must be knowledge of a danger, not merely possible, but probable.</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Cardozo's new &quot;rule&quot; exists in no prior case, but is inferrable as a synthesis of the &quot;thing of danger&quot; principle stated in them, merely extending it to &quot;foreseeable danger&quot; even if &quot;the purposes for which it was designed&quot; were not themselves &quot;a source of great danger.&quot;<space/><italics>MacPherson</italics><space/>takes some care to present itself as foreseeable progression, not a wild departure.

There is no such tort in English common law; thus, any jurisdiction that lacks a wrongful death statute will not allow a lawsuit for the wrongful death of a loved one. Where a wrongful death statute exists, the compensation or other remedy available is limited to the remedy specified in the statute (typically, an upper limit on the amount of damages). Courts generally interpret statutes that create new causes of action narrowlythat is, limited to their precise termsbecause the courts generally recognize the legislature as being supreme in deciding the reach of judge-made law unless such statute should violate some &quot;second order&quot;<space/><link><target>constitutional law</target></link><space/>provision (<italics>cf</italics>.<space/><link><target>judicial activism</target></link>).</paragraph><paragraph>Where a tort is rooted in common law (<link><target>Common law#1.

The king's judges would then return to London and often discuss their cases and the decisions they made with the other judges. These decisions would be recorded and filed. In time, a rule, known as<space/><italics><link><target>stare decisis</target></link></italics><space/>(also commonly known as precedent) developed, whereby a judge would be bound to follow the decision of an earlier judge; he was required to adopt the earlier judge's interpretation of the law and apply the same principles promulgated by that earlier judge if the two cases had similar facts to one another. Once judges began to regard each other's decisions to be binding precedent, the pre-Norman system of local customs and law varying in each locality was replaced by a system that was (at least in theory, though not always in practice) common throughout the whole country, hence the name &quot;common law.&quot;</paragraph><paragraph>Henry II's creation of a powerful and unified court system, which curbed somewhat the power of<space/><link><target>canon law</target><part>canonical</part></link><space/>(church) courts, brought him (and England) into conflict with the church, most famously with<space/><link><target>Thomas Becket</target></link>, the<space/><link><target>Archbishop of Canterbury</target></link>. Eventually, Becket was murdered inside<space/><link><target>Canterbury Cathedral</target></link><space/>by four knights who believed themselves to be acting on Henry's behalf.

Therefore, the president of the bench's view of the case is not neutral and may be biased while conducting the trial after the reading of the dossier. Unlike the common law proceedings, the president of the bench in the inquisitorial system is not merely an umpire and is entitled to directly interview the witnesses or express comments during the trial, as long as he or she does not express his or her view on the guilt of the accused.</paragraph><paragraph>The proceeding in the inquisitorial system is essentially by writing. Most of the witnesses would have given evidence in the investigation phase and such evidence will be contained in the dossier under the form of police reports. In the same way, the accused would have already put his or her case at the investigation phase but he or she will be free to change her or his evidence at trial. Whether the accused pleads guilty or not, a trial will be conducted. Unlike the adversarial system, the conviction and sentence to be served (if any) will be released by the trial jury together with the president of the trial bench, following their common deliberation.</paragraph><paragraph>There are many exceptions in both directions. For example, most proceedings before U.S. federal and state agencies are inquisitorial in nature, at least the initial stages (<italics>e.g.</italics>, a patent examiner, a social security hearing officer, and so on), even though the law to be applied is developed through common law processes.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Contrasting role of treatises and academic writings in common law and civil law systems</heading><paragraph>The role of the legal academy presents a significant &quot;cultural&quot; difference between common law (<link><target>Common law#2.

During the Napoleonic wars the Kingdom of the Netherlands adopted the French<space/><italics>code civil</italics><space/>in 1809, however the Dutch colonies in the Cape of Good Hope and Sri Lanka, at the time called Ceylon, were seized by the British to prevent them being used as bases by the French Navy. The system was developed by the courts and spread with the expansion of British colonies in Southern Africa. Roman Dutch common law relies on legal principles set out in Roman law sources such as Justinian's Institutes and Digest, and also on the writing of Dutch jurists of the 17th century such as<space/><link><target>Hugo Grotius</target><part>Grotius</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Johannes Voet</target><part>Voet</part></link>.
