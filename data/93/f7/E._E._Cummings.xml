They were a well-known family in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His father was a professor at Harvard University and later the nationally known minister of Old South Church in Boston, Massachusetts. His mother who loved to spend time with her children, played games with Cummings and his sister, Elizabeth. Cummings wrote poems and also drew as a child, and he often played outdoors with the many other children who lived in his neighborhood. He also grew up in the company of such family friends as the philosophers William James (18421910) and Josiah Royce (18551916). He graduated from Harvard University in 1915 and then received an advanced degree from Harvard in 1916.<extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.notablebiographies.com/Co-Da/Cummings-E-E.html</extension></paragraph><paragraph>He exhibited<space/><link><target>transcendentalism</target><part>transcendental</part></link><space/>leanings his entire life. As he grew in maturity and age, Cummings moved more toward an<space/><link><target>I and Thou</target><part>&quot;I, Thou&quot;</part></link><space/>relationship with God. His journals are replete with references to &quot;le bon Dieu,&quot; as well as prayers for inspiration in his poetry and artwork (such as Bon Dieu! may I some day do something truly great. amen.). Cummings &quot;also prayed for strength to be his essential self ('may I be I is the only prayernot may I be great or good or beautiful or wise or strong'), and for relief of spirit in times of<space/><link><target>depression (mood)</target><part>depression</part></link><space/>('almighty God!

These men took my sixty-six year old mother by the arms and tried to lead her toward a nearby farmhouse; but she threw them off, strode straight to my father's body, and directed a group of scared spectators to cover him.

All the fuss perplexed him. The poems were commenting on prejudice, he pointed out, and not condoning it. He intended to show how derogatory words cause people to see others in terms of stereotypes rather than as individuals. &quot;America (which turns Hungarian into 'hunky' &amp; Irishman into 'mick' and Norwegian into 'square- head') is to blame for 'kike,'&quot; he said.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Reef"></extension></extension></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>William Carlos Williams</target></link><space/>spoke out in his defence.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Reef"><italics>E.

The production was directed by James Light. The play's main characters are &quot;Him&quot;, a playwright, and &quot;Me&quot;, his girlfriend.

It is an allegorical Christmas fantasy presented in one act of five scenes. The play was inspired by his daughter Nancy, with whom he was reunited in 1946. It was first published in the Harvard College magazine the<space/><italics>Wake</italics>. The play's main characters are Santa Claus, his family (Woman and Child), Death, and Mob. At the outset of the play, Santa Claus's family has disintegrated due to their lust for knowledge (Science). After a series of events, however, Santa Claus's faith in love and his rejection of the materialism and disappointment he associates with Science are reaffirmed, and he is reunited with Woman and Child.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Name and capitalization</heading><paragraph>Cummings's publishers and others have sometimes echoed the unconventional<space/><link><target>orthography</target></link><space/>in his poetry by writing his name in lowercase and without periods (<link><target>full stop</target><trail>s</trail></link>), but normal orthography (uppercase and full stops) is supported by scholarship and preferred by publishers today.<extension extension_name='ref' name="friedman92"></extension><space/>Cummings himself used both the lowercase and capitalized versions, though he most often signed his name with capitals.<extension extension_name='ref' name="friedman92"><template><target>cite journal</target><arg name="last"><space/>Friedman<space/></arg><arg name="first"><space/>Norman<space/></arg><arg name="year"><space/>1992<space/></arg><arg name="title"><space/>Not "e. e. cummings"<space/></arg><arg name="journal">Spring<space/></arg><arg name="volume"><space/>1<space/></arg><arg name="pages"><space/>114–121<space/></arg><arg name="url"><space/>http://faculty.gvsu.edu/websterm/cummings/caps.htm<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate"><space/>December 13, 2005<space/></arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The use of lowercase for his initials was popularized in part by the title of some books, particularly in the 1960s, printing his name in lower case on the cover and spine.
