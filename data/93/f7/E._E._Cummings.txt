'''Edward Estlin Cummings''' (October 14, 1894 – September 3, 1962), known as '''E.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;Cummings''', with the abbreviated form of his name often written by others in lowercase letters as '''e&nbsp;e&nbsp;cummings''' (in the style of some of his poems—see [[#Name and capitalization|name and capitalization]], below), was an [[Poetry of the United States|American poet]], painter, essayist, author, and playwright. His body of work encompasses approximately 2,900 poems, two [[autobiographical novel]]s, four plays and several essays, as well as numerous drawings and paintings. He is remembered as an eminent voice of [[Modernist poetry in English|20th century English literature]].

===Early years===
Edward Estlin Cummings was born on October 14, 1894, to Edward Cummings and Rebecca Haswell Clarke who were [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]]. They were a well-known family in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His father was a professor at Harvard University and later the nationally known minister of Old South Church in Boston, Massachusetts. His mother who loved to spend time with her children, played games with Cummings and his sister, Elizabeth.  Cummings wrote poems and also drew as a child, and he often played outdoors with the many other children who lived in his neighborhood. He also grew up in the company of such family friends as the philosophers William James (1842–1910) and Josiah Royce (1855–1916). He graduated from Harvard University in 1915 and then received an advanced degree from Harvard in 1916.<ref>http://www.notablebiographies.com/Co-Da/Cummings-E-E.html</ref>

He exhibited [[transcendentalism|transcendental]] leanings his entire life. As he grew in maturity and age, Cummings moved more toward an [[I and Thou|"I, Thou"]] relationship with God. His journals are replete with references to "le bon Dieu," as well as prayers for inspiration in his poetry and artwork (such as “Bon Dieu! may I some day do something truly great. amen.”). Cummings "also prayed for strength to be his essential self ('may I be I is the only prayer—not may I be great or good or beautiful or wise or strong'), and for relief of spirit in times of [[depression (mood)|depression]] ('almighty God! I thank thee for my soul; & may I never die spiritually into a mere mind through disease of loneliness')."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/unitarians/cummings.html |title=E. E. Cummings: Poet And Painter}}</ref>

Cummings wanted to be a poet from childhood and wrote poetry daily aged 8 to 22, exploring assorted forms. He went to [[Harvard]] and developed an interest in modern poetry which ignored conventional grammar and syntax, aiming for a dynamic use of language. Upon graduating, he worked for a book dealer.<ref Name="PoetryF">[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/e-e-cummings Profile at the Poetry Foundation]</ref>

===The war years===
In 1917, with the First World War ongoing in Europe, Cummings enlisted in the [[AFS Intercultural Programs#WWI|Norton-Harjes Ambulance Corps]], along with his college friend [[John Dos Passos]]. Due to an administrative mix-up, Cummings was not assigned to an ambulance unit for five weeks, during which time he stayed in Paris. He fell in love with the city, to which he would return throughout his life.<ref name=utexas>{{cite web|url=http://research.hrc.utexas.edu:8080/hrcxtf/view?docId=ead/00030.xml|title=E. E. Cummings:   An Inventory of His Collection at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center|publisher=Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center |accessdate=May 9, 2010}}</ref>

During their service in the ambulance corps, they sent letters home that drew the attention of the military censors, and were known to prefer the company of French soldiers over fellow ambulance drivers. The two openly expressed anti-war views; Cummings spoke of his lack of hatred for the Germans.<ref>Friedman, Norman "Cummings, E[dward] E[stlin]" in Steven Serafin ''The Continuum Encyclopedia of American Literature'', 2003, Continuum, p. 244.</ref> On September 21, 1917, just five months after his belated assignment, he and a friend, [[William Slater Brown]], were arrested by the French military on suspicion of espionage and undesirable activities. They were held for 3½ months in a military detention camp at the ''[[La Ferté-Macé|Dépôt de Triage]]'', in [[La Ferté-Macé]], Orne, Normandy.<ref name=utexas/>

They were imprisoned with other detainees in a large room. Cummings' father failed to obtain his son's release through diplomatic channels and in December 1917 wrote a letter to President Wilson. Cummings was released on December 19, 1917, and Brown was released two months later. Cummings used his prison experience as the basis for his novel, ''[[The Enormous Room]]'' (1922), about which [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] said, "Of all the work by young men who have sprung up since 1920 one book survives—''The Enormous Room'' by e e cummings... Those few who cause books to live have not been able to endure the thought of its mortality."<ref>Bloom, p. 1814.</ref> <!-- Did F Scott Fitzgerald use upper- or lower-case for Cummings' name?  In a direct quote, it matters. -->

Cummings returned to the United States on New Year's Day 1918. Later in 1918 he was drafted into the army. He served in the [[12th Division (United States)|12th Division]] at [[Camp Devens|Camp Devens, Massachusetts]], until November 1918.<ref>Kennedy, p. 186.</ref><ref>[http://freepages.military.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~worldwarone/WWI/divisions.html#Twelfth Data on U.S. Army Divisions during World War I; 12th Division, 23rd Infantry Brigade, 73rd Infantry (draftees)]</ref>

===Post-war years===
Cummings returned to Paris in 1921 and remained there for two years before returning to New York. His collection ''Tulips and Chimneys'' came in 1923 and his inventive use of grammar and syntax is evident. The book was heavily cut by his editor. ''XLI Poems'', was then published in 1925. With these collections Cummings made his reputation as an avant garde poet.<ref Name="PoetryF"/>

During the rest of the 1920s and 1930s Cummings returned to Paris a number of times, and traveled throughout Europe, meeting, among others, [[Pablo Picasso]]. In 1931 Cummings traveled to the [[Soviet Union]], recounting his experiences in ''[[Eimi (book)|Eimi]]'', published two years later. During these years Cummings also traveled to Northern Africa and [[Mexico]] and worked as an essayist and portrait artist for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine (1924–1927).

In 1926, Cummings's parents were in a car accident; his father was killed and his mother survived, although severely injured. Cummings later described the accident in the following passage from his ''i: six nonlectures'' series given at Harvard (as part of the [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures]]) in 1952 and 1953:

<blockquote>
A locomotive cut the car in half, killing my father instantly. When two brakemen jumped from the halted train, they saw a woman standing – dazed but erect – beside a mangled machine; with blood spouting (as the older said to me) out of her head. One of her hands (the younger added) kept feeling her dress, as if trying to discover why it was wet. These men took my sixty-six year old mother by the arms and tried to lead her toward a nearby farmhouse; but she threw them off, strode straight to my father's body, and directed a group of scared spectators to cover him. When this had been done (and only then) she let them lead her away.
</blockquote>

His father's death had a profound effect on Cummings, who entered a new period in his artistic life. He began to focus on more important aspects of life in his poetry. He started this new period by paying homage to his father in the poem "my father moved through dooms of love"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~richie/poetry/html/aupoem114.html |title= My father moved through dooms of love}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | first = Gary | last = Lane | authorlink =  | year = 1976 | title = I Am: A Study of E.

In the 1930s Samuel Aiwaz Jacobs was Cummings' publisher; he had started the Golden Eagle Press after working as a typographer and publisher.

===Final years===
[[File:EECummingsGrave.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of E. E. Cummings]]

In 1952, his alma mater, [[Harvard University]] awarded Cummings an honorary seat as a guest professor. The [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures]] he gave in 1952 and 1955 were later collected as ''i: six nonlectures''.

Cummings spent the last decade of his life traveling, fulfilling speaking engagements, and spending time at his summer home, [[Joy Farm]], in [[Silver Lake, New Hampshire]]. He died of a stroke on September 3, 1962, at the age of 67 in [[North Conway, New Hampshire]] at the Memorial Hospital.<ref>{{cite news |coauthors= |title=E. E. Cummings Dies of Stroke. Poet Stood for [[Stylistics (linguistics)|Stylistic Liberty]] |url= |work=New York Times |date=September 4, 1962}}</ref> His cremated remains were buried in Lot 748 Althaeas Path, in Section 6, [[Forest Hills Cemetery]] and Crematory in Boston. In 1969, his third wife, model and photographer Marion Morehouse Cummings, died and was buried in an adjoining plot.

Cummings's papers are held at the [[Houghton Library]] at [[Harvard University]] and the [[Harry Ransom Center]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]].<ref name=utexas/>

==Personal life==

===Marriages===
[[File:EECummings pd4.jpg|thumb|upright|Sketched self-portrait circa 1920]]
Cummings was married briefly twice; his longest relationship was outside marriage. Cummings's first marriage, to Elaine Orr, began as a love affair in 1918 while she was married to [[Scofield Thayer]], one of Cummings's friends from Harvard. During this time he wrote a good deal of his erotic poetry.<ref name="Kennedy">''Selected Poems,'' Ed. Richard S. Kennedy, Liveright, 1994.</ref> The couple had a daughter together, Nancy, born on December 20, 1919. Nancy was Cummings's only child.

After divorcing Thayer, Elaine married Cummings on March 19, 1924. However, they separated after two months and divorced less than nine months later. Elaine left Cummings for a wealthy Irish banker, moved to Ireland, and took Nancy with her. Under the terms of the divorce Cummings was granted custody of Nancy for three months each year, but Elaine refused to abide by the agreement. Cummings did not see his daughter again until 1946. Nancy later married [[Joseph Willard Roosevelt]], second son of [[Kermit Roosevelt]] and Belle Wyatt Willard.

Cummings married his second wife Anne Minnerly Barton on May 1, 1929, and they separated three years later in 1932. That same year, Anne obtained a [[Mexican divorce]]; it was not officially recognized in the United States until August 1934.

The year Cummings and Anne separated, he met Marion Morehouse, a fashion model and photographer. Although it is not clear whether the two were ever formally married, Morehouse lived with Cummings in a [[common-law marriage]] until his death in 1962. She died on May 18, 1969,<ref>''Marion Morehouse Cummings, Poet's Widow, Top Model, Dies'' , [[The New York Times]], May 19, 1969.</ref> while living at 4 [[Patchin Place]], [[Greenwich Village]], New York City, where Cummings had resided since September 8, 1924.<ref>Sawyer-Lauçanno, p. 255.</ref>

===Political views===
According to his testimony in ''[[Eimi (book)|EIMI]]'', Cummings had little interest in politics until his trip to the Soviet Union in 1931,<ref name=Blumenkranz>Carla Blumenkranz, [http://www.poetryfoundation.org/article/180437 "The Enormous Poem: When E.E. Cummings Repunctuated Stalinism."] Poetry Foundation. www.poetryfoundation.org/</ref> after which he shifted rightward on many political and social issues.<ref>[http://college.cengage.com/english/lauter/heath/4e/students/author_pages/modern/cummings_ee.html College.cengage.com]</ref> Despite his radical and [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] public image, he was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and, later, an ardent supporter of [[Joseph McCarthy]].<ref>Wetzsteon, Ross. 'Republic of Dreams: Greenwich Village: The American Bohemia, 1910–1960', pp. 449 [http://books.google.com/books?id=o2DB77ccf9sC&pg=PA449 Google Books]</ref>

==Work==

===Poetry===
Despite Cummings's familiarity with [[avant-garde]] styles (undoubtedly affected by the ''[[Calligrammes]]'' of [[Apollinaire]], according to a contemporary observation<ref>Taupin, Rene, ''The Influence of French Symbolism on Modern American Poetry 1927'' (Trans. William Pratt), AMS Inc, New York 1985  ISBN 0404615791</ref>), much of his work is quite traditional. Many of his poems are [[sonnet]]s, albeit often with a modern twist, and he occasionally made use of the [[blues#Lyrics|blues]] form and [[acrostics]]. Cummings' poetry often deals with themes of love and nature, as well as the relationship of the individual to the masses and to the world. His poems are also often rife with satire.

While his poetic forms and themes share an affinity with the [[Romanticism|romantic tradition]], Cummings' work universally shows a particular idiosyncrasy of [[syntax]], or way of arranging individual words into larger phrases and sentences. Many of his most striking poems do not involve any typographical or punctuation innovations at all, but purely syntactic ones.

<!---NB **The typography is Cummings' original setting**--->

As well as being influenced by notable [[Modernist literature|modernists]], including [[Gertrude Stein]] and [[Ezra Pound]], Cummings in his early work drew upon the [[Imagism|imagist]] experiments of [[Amy Lowell]]. Later, his visits to Paris exposed him to [[Dada]] and [[surrealism]], which he reflected in his work. He began to rely on symbolism and allegory where he once used simile and metaphor. In his later work, he rarely used comparisons that required objects that were not previously mentioned in the poem, choosing to use a symbol instead. Due to this, his later poetry is "frequently more lucid, more moving, and more profound than his earlier."<ref>Friedman, Norman. ''E. E. Cummings the Art of His Poetry.'' Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 1967. p. 89.</ref> Cummings also liked to incorporate imagery of nature and death into much of his poetry.

While some of his poetry is [[free verse]] (with no concern for [[rhyme]] or [[meter (poetry)|meter]]), many have a recognizable sonnet structure of 14 lines, with an intricate rhyme scheme. A number of his poems feature a typographically exuberant style, with words, parts of words, or punctuation symbols scattered across the page, often making little sense until read aloud, at which point the meaning and emotion become clear. Cummings, who was also a painter, understood the importance of presentation, and used typography to "paint a picture" with some of his poems.<ref>{{cite journal | first = Iain | last = Landles | authorlink = Iain Landles | year = 2001 | title = An Analysis of Two Poems by E. E. Cummings | journal=SPRING, the Journal of the E. E. Cummings Society | volume = 10 | pages = 31–43 }}</ref>

The seeds of Cummings' unconventional style appear well established even in his earliest work. At age six, he wrote to his father:

<blockquote><small>FATHER DEAR. BE, YOUR FATHER-GOOD AND GOOD,<br>
HE IS GOOD NOW, IT IS NOT GOOD TO SEE IT RAIN,<br>
FATHER DEAR IS, IT, DEAR, NO FATHER DEAR,<br>
LOVE, YOU DEAR,<br>
ESTLIN.</small><ref>''Selected letters of E. E. Cummings'', (1972) Edward Estlin Cummings, Frederick Wilcox Dupee, George Stade. University of Michigan p3 ISBN 978-0-233-95637-4</ref></blockquote>

Following his autobiographical novel, ''[[The Enormous Room]]'', Cummings' first published work was a collection of poems entitled ''[[Tulips and Chimneys]]'' (1923). This work was the public's first encounter with his characteristic eccentric use of grammar and punctuation.

Some of Cummings' most famous poems do not involve much, if any, odd typography or punctuation, but still carry his unmistakable style, particularly in unusual and impressionistic word order.

{{Quote box |width=300px |align=right ||salign=right
 |quote  =<poem>
anyone lived in a pretty how town
(with up so floating many bells down)
spring summer autumn winter

</poem>
 |source =From "[[anyone lived in a pretty how town]]" (1940)<ref>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poem/11856 "anyone lived in a pretty how town" at the Poetry Foundation]</ref>}}

Cummings' work often does not proceed in accordance with the conventional combinatorial rules that generate typical English sentences (for example, "they sowed their isn't"). His readings of [[Gertrude Stein|Stein]] in the early part of the century probably served as a springboard to this aspect of his artistic development. {{citation needed|date=October 2011}} In some respects, Cummings' work is more stylistically continuous with Stein's than with any other poet or writer.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In addition, a number of Cummings' poems feature, in part or in whole, intentional misspellings, and several incorporate phonetic spellings intended to represent particular dialects. Cummings also made use of inventive formations of compound words, as in "in Just"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/images/modeng/public/Cum2Dia/CumDi580.jpg |title=in Just}}</ref> which features words such as "mud-luscious", "puddle-wonderful", and "eddieandbill." This poem is part of a sequence of poems entitled ''Chansons Innocentes'';<ref>[http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15398 ''Chansons Innocentes'']</ref> it has many references comparing the "balloonman" to [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], the mythical creature that is half-goat and half-man. Literary critic [[R.P. Blackmur]] has commented that this usage of language is “frequently unintelligible because he disregards the historical accumulation of meaning in words in favour of merely private and personal associations.”<ref>Friedman, Norman. ''E. E. Cummings the Art of His Poetry''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 1967. p. 61-62.</ref>

Many of Cummings' poems are satirical and address social issues<ref>[http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15404 "why must itself up every of a park"]</ref> but have an equal or even stronger bias toward romanticism: time and again his poems celebrate love, sex, and the season of rebirth.<ref>[http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15403 "anyone lived in a pretty how town"]</ref>

Cummings also wrote children's books and novels. A notable example of his versatility is an introduction he wrote for a collection of the comic strip ''[[Krazy Kat]]''.

===Controversy===
Cummings is also known for controversial subject matter, as he has a large collection of erotic poetry. In his 1950 collection ''Xaipe: Seventy-One Poems'', Cummings published two poems containing words that caused an outrage in some quarters.<ref>Friedman, Norman, and Harry Thornton Moore. ''E. E. Cummings the Growth of a Writer''. Carbondale: Southern Illinois UP, 1964. p 153-54.</ref>

:<poem>

</poem>

Cummings biographer Catherine Reef notes of the incident:
<blockquote>
Friends begged Cummings to reconsider publishing these poems, and the book's editor pleaded with him to withdraw them, but he insisted that they stay. All the fuss perplexed him. The poems were commenting on prejudice, he pointed out, and not condoning it. He intended to show how derogatory words cause people to see others in terms of stereotypes rather than as individuals. "America (which turns Hungarian into 'hunky' & Irishman into 'mick' and Norwegian into 'square- head') is to blame for 'kike,'" he said.<ref Name="Reef"/>
</blockquote>

[[William Carlos Williams]] spoke out in his defence.<ref Name="Reef">''E. Cummings'' (2006) by Catherine Reef, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt p115 ISBN 978-0-618-56849-9</ref>

===Plays===
During his lifetime, Cummings published four plays. ''HIM'', a three-act play, was first produced in 1928 by the [[Provincetown Players]] in New York City. The production was directed by James Light. The play's main characters are "Him", a playwright, and "Me", his girlfriend. Cummings said of the unorthodox play:
<blockquote>Relax and give the play a chance to strut its stuff—relax, stop wondering what it is all 'about'—like many strange and familiar things, Life included, this play isn't 'about,' it simply is. . . . Don't try to enjoy it, let it try to enjoy you. <small>DON'T TRY TO UNDERSTAND IT, LET IT TRY TO UNDERSTAND YOU.</small>"<ref>Kennedy, p. 295.</ref></blockquote>

''Anthropos, or the Future of Art'' is a short, one-act play that Cummings contributed to the anthology ''Whither, Whither or After Sex, What? A Symposium to End Symposium''. The play consists of dialogue between Man, the main character, and three "infrahumans", or inferior beings. The word ''[[Greek language|anthropos]]'' is the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "man", in the sense of "mankind".

''Tom, A Ballet'' is a ballet based on ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''. The ballet is detailed in a "synopsis" as well as descriptions of four "episodes", which were published by Cummings in 1935. It has never been performed.<ref>[http://www.gvsu.edu/english/cummings/Tom.html GVSU.edu The E. E. Cummings Society].</ref>

''[[Santa Claus: A Morality]]'' was probably Cummings's most successful play. It is an allegorical Christmas fantasy presented in one act of five scenes. The play was inspired by his daughter Nancy, with whom he was reunited in 1946. It was first published in the Harvard College magazine the ''Wake''. The play's main characters are Santa Claus, his family (Woman and Child), Death, and Mob. At the outset of the play, Santa Claus's family has disintegrated due to their lust for knowledge (Science). After a series of events, however, Santa Claus's faith in love and his rejection of the materialism and disappointment he associates with Science are reaffirmed, and he is reunited with Woman and Child.

===Name and capitalization===
Cummings's publishers and others have sometimes echoed the unconventional [[orthography]] in his poetry by writing his name in lowercase and without periods ([[full stop]]s), but normal orthography (uppercase and full stops) is supported by scholarship and preferred by publishers today.<ref name="friedman92" /> Cummings himself used both the lowercase and capitalized versions, though he most often signed his name with capitals.<ref name="friedman92">{{cite journal | last = Friedman | first =  Norman | year = 1992 | title = Not "e. e. cummings" | journal=Spring | volume = 1 | pages = 114–121 | url = http://faculty.gvsu.edu/websterm/cummings/caps.htm | accessdate = December 13, 2005 }}</ref>

The use of lowercase for his initials was popularized in part by the title of some books, particularly in the 1960s, printing his name in lower case on the cover and spine. In the preface to ''E. E. Cummings: The Growth of a Writer'' by Norman Friedman, critic Harry T. Moore notes, "He [Cummings] had his name put legally into lower case, and in his later books the titles and his name were always in lower case."<ref>{{cite book | last = Friedman | first = Norman | title = E. E. Cummings: The Growth of a Writer | location = Carbondale | publisher=Southern Illinois University Press | year = 1964 | isbn = 0-8093-0978-5 }}</ref> According to Cummings's widow, however, this is incorrect.<ref name="friedman92" /> She wrote to Friedman: "You should not have allowed H. Moore to make such a stupid & childish statement about Cummings & his signature." On February 27, 1951, Cummings wrote to his French translator D. Jon Grossman that he preferred the use of upper case for the particular edition they were working on.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Friedman | first = Norman | year = 1995 | title = Not "e. e. cummings" Revisited | journal=Spring | volume = 5 | pages = 41–43 | url = http://faculty.gvsu.edu/websterm/cummings/caps2.html | accessdate = May 12, 2007 }}</ref> One Cummings scholar believes that on the rare occasions Cummings signed his name in all lowercase, he may have intended it as a gesture of humility, not as an indication that it was the preferred orthography for others to use.<ref name="friedman92" />

==Adaptations==
In 1943, modern dancer and choreographer [[Jean Erdman]] presented "The Transformations of Medusa, Forever and Sunsmell" with a commissioned score by [[John Cage]] and a spoken text from the titular poem by E. E. Cummings, sponsored by the [[Arts Club of Chicago]]. Erdman also choreographed "Twenty Poems" (1960), a cycle of E. E. Cummings's poems for eight dancers and one actor with a commissioned score by [[Teiji Ito]], performed in the round at the [[Circle in the Square Theatre]] in Greenwich Village.
 
In 1961, [[Pierre Boulez]] composed "Cummings ist der dichter" from poems by E.E. Cummings.<ref>[http://brahms.ircam.fr/works/work/6957/ "Brahms : IRCAM database"]</ref>
