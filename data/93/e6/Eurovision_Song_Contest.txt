Each participating country submits an original song to be performed on [[live television]] and radio and then casts votes for the other countries' songs to determine the most popular song in the competition.

== Origins ==
{{further2|[[History of the Eurovision Song Contest]]}}

In the 1950s, as a [[Effects of World War II|war-torn Europe]] rebuilt itself, the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU)—based in [[Switzerland]]—set up an ad hoc committee to search for ways of bringing together the countries of the EBU around a "light entertainment programme".<ref name="bristol">{{cite news|title=Singing out loud and proud|date=17 May 2005|publisher=''[[Daily Mail and General Trust]]''|work=[[Bristol Evening Post]]|accessdate=18 July 2009|author=Staff|quote=In the mid-1950s, the members of the European Broadcasting Union set up an ad hoc committee to investigate ways of rallying the countries of Europe round a light entertainment programme. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) was formed on 12 February 1950 by 23 broadcasting organisations from Europe and the Mediterranean at a conference in Devon, United Kingdom. It was on 6 June 1954, that Montreux became the venue for the first transmission by the EBU's Eurovision Network of the Narcissus Festival and its flower-bedecked procession floats. At Monaco, in late January 1955, this committee, chaired by Marcel Bezençon, director general of Swiss Television, came up with the idea of creating a song contest, inspired by the very popular San Remo Festival. The idea was approved by the EBU General Assembly in Rome on 19 October 1955, and it was decided that the first "Eurovision Grand Prix" – so baptised, incidentally, by a British journalist – would take place in spring 1956 at Lugano, Switzerland.}}</ref> At a committee meeting held in [[Monaco]] in January 1955, director general of Swiss television and committee chairman [[Marcel Bezençon]] conceived the idea of an international song contest where countries would participate in one television programme, to be transmitted simultaneously to all countries of the union.<ref name="bristol" /><ref name="GoldenJubilee">{{cite web|first=Patrick |last=Jaquin|date=1 December 2004|url=http://www.ebu.ch/en/union/diffusion_on_line/television/tcm_6-8971.php|title= Eurovision's Golden Jubilee|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|accessdate=18 July 2009}}</ref> The competition was based upon the existing [[Sanremo Music Festival]] held in Italy,<ref>{{cite web |publisher= ''[[BBC Online]]'' |year= 2003 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/eurovision/2003/history |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5nDiNS1hs |archivedate= 1 February 2010 |title= History of Eurovision |accessdate= 20 July 2006}}</ref> and was seen as a technological experiment in [[live television]], as in those days it was a very ambitious project to join many countries together in a wide-area international network. Satellite television did not exist, and the [[Eurovision Network]] comprised a terrestrial [[Microwave radio relay|microwave network]].<ref name="EBU40years">{{cite web|first= George T. |last=Waters |date= Winter 1994 |url= http://www.ebu.ch/en/technical/trev/trev_262-editorial.html |title= Eurovision: 40 years of network development, four decades of service to broadcasters |publisher = ''[[European Broadcasting Union]]'' | accessdate=15 July 2006}}</ref> The concept, then known as "Eurovision Grand Prix", was approved by the EBU General Assembly in a meeting held in Rome on 19 October 1955 and it was decided that the first contest would take place in spring 1956 in Lugano, Switzerland.<ref name="bristol" /> The name "Eurovision" was first used in relation to the EBU's network by British journalist George Campey in the London ''[[Evening Standard]]'' in 1951.<ref name="GoldenJubilee"/>

The first contest was held in the town of [[Lugano]], [[Switzerland]], on 24 May 1956. Seven countries participated—each submitting two songs, for a total of 14. This was the only contest in which more than one song per country was performed: since 1957 all contests have allowed one entry per country. The [[Eurovision Song Contest 1956|1956 contest]] was won by the host nation, Switzerland.<ref name="milestones">{{cite web |publisher= ''[[European Broadcasting Union]]'' |year= 2005 |url= http://www.eurovision.tv/english/611.htm  |title= Historical Milestones |accessdate=26 May 2006 |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20060526065558/http://www.eurovision.tv/english/611.htm |archivedate = 26 May 2006}}{{dead link|date=May 2015}}</ref>

=== Naming ===
The programme was first known as the "Eurovision Grand Prix" (in English). This "Grand Prix" name was adopted by [[Denmark]], [[Norway]] and the [[Francophone countries]], with the French designation being "''Le Grand-Prix Eurovision de la Chanson Européenne''".<ref>{{cite web |first= Franck |last=Thomas |year= 1999 |url= http://www.eurovision-fr.net/histoire/histoire5659.php  |title= Histoire 1956 à 1959 | publisher = ''eurovision-fr.net'' | accessdate= 17 July 2006 |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20060502192602/http://www.eurovision-fr.net/histoire/histoire5659.php |archivedate = 2 May 2006|language=fr}}</ref> The "Grand Prix" has since been dropped and replaced with "''Concours''" (contest) in French, but not in [[Danish language|Danish]] or [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]. The Eurovision Network is used to carry many news and sports programmes internationally, among other specialised events organised by the EBU.<ref>{{cite web |publisher= ''[[European Broadcasting Union]]'' |date= 14 June 2005|url= http://www.ebu.ch/departments/operations/ops.php |title= The EBU Operations Department |accessdate= 20 July 2006}}</ref> However, in the minds of the public, the name "Eurovision" is most closely associated with the Song Contest.<ref name="EBU40years"/>

== Format ==
The format of the contest has changed over the years, though the basic tenets have always been thus: participant countries submit new original songs, which are performed live in a television programme transmitted across the Eurovision Network by the EBU simultaneously to all countries.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3712029.stm | work=BBC News | title=Voting fault hits Eurovision heat | date=13 May 2004 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref> A "country" as a participant is represented by one television broadcaster from that country: typically, but not always, that country's national [[public broadcasting|public broadcasting organisation]]. The programme is hosted by one of the participant countries, and the transmission is sent from the [[auditorium]] in the host city. During this programme, after all the songs have been performed, the countries then proceed to cast votes for the other countries' songs: nations are not allowed to vote for their own song.<ref name="2009rules"/> At the end of the programme, the winner is declared as the song with the most points. The winner receives, simply, the prestige of having won—although it is usual for a [[trophy]] to be awarded to the winning songwriters, and the winning country is invited to host the event the following year.<ref name="milestones"/>

The programme is invariably opened by one or more presenters, welcoming viewers to the show. Between the songs and the announcement of the voting, an interval act is performed. These acts can be any form of entertainment imaginable. Interval entertainment has included such acts as [[The Wombles (band)|the Wombles]] ({{ESCYr|1974}})<ref name="ESC1974">{{cite web|publisher= ''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=290|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1974|accessdate=19 July 2009}}</ref> and the first international presentation of [[Riverdance]] ({{ESCYr|1994}}).<ref>{{cite web |first=Clive |last=Barnes |url= http://www.riverdance.com/htm/theshow/thejourney |title= Riverdance Ten Years on |publisher = ''RiverDance'' | accessdate=27 July 2006}}</ref>

As national broadcasters join and leave the [[Eurovision (network)|Eurovision]] feed transmitted by the EBU, the EBU/Eurovision network logo ident (not to be confused with the song contest logo) is displayed. The accompanying theme music (used on other Eurovision broadcasts) is the prelude to [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier]]'s ''[[Te Deum (Charpentier)|Te Deum]]''.<ref name="GoldenJubilee"/> Originally the same logo was used for both the Eurovision network and European Broadcasting Union, however they now have two different logos; when the ident is transmitted it is the Eurovision network logo that appears.

The Eurovision Song Contest finals are traditionally held on a Saturday evening in [[May (month)|May]], at 19:00 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] (15:00 [[Eastern Daylight Time|EDT]], 20:00 [[British Summer Time|BST]]/[[Irish Standard Time|IST]], or 21:00 [[Central European Summer Time|CEST]]). Usually one Saturday in May is chosen, although the contest has been held on a Thursday (in 1956; and since 2005 in the semi-finals)<ref>{{cite web|publisher= ''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=273|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1956|accessdate=19 July 2009}}</ref> and as early as March (in 1979).<ref>{{cite web|publisher= ''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=295|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1979|accessdate=19 July 2009}}</ref>

Active members include broadcasting organisations, whose transmissions are often made available to at least 98% of households in their own country which are equipped to receive such transmissions.<ref name="EBUmembership"/>

If an EBU Active Member wishes to participate they must fulfil conditions as laid down by the rules of the contest. A separate copy is drafted annually. As of 2015, this includes the necessity to have broadcast the previous year's programme within their country, and the broadcaster must have paid the EBU a participation fee in advance of the [[time limit|deadline]] specified in the rules of the contest for the year in which they wish to participate.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Eligibility to participate is not determined by [[geography|geographic]] inclusion within the continent of Europe, despite the "Euro" in "Eurovision" – nor does it have any relation to the [[European Union]].

The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia reconstituted itself as [[Serbia and Montenegro]] in 2003—entered the contest in 2004—and finally dissolved in 2006, making two separate states: [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]; both of which made their début in the contest in 2007, the winner that year being Serbia.</small>

== Hosting ==

Most of the expense of the contest is covered by [[Sponsor (commercial)|commercial sponsors]] and contributions from the other participating nations. The contest is considered to be a unique opportunity for promoting the host country as a tourist destination. In the summer of 2005, Ukraine abolished its normal visa requirement for visitors from the EU to coincide with its hosting of the event.<ref>{{cite news |first= Helen |last=Fawkes | publisher = ''[[BBC News Online]]'' |date=19 May 2005|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4561275.stm |title=Ukrainian hosts' high hopes for Eurovision|accessdate= 19 July 2009}}</ref>

Preparations for the event start a matter of weeks after the host wins in the previous year, and confirms to the EBU that they intend to—and have the capacity to—host the event.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} A host city is chosen—often a national or regional capital city—and a suitable concert venue is identified. The two largest concert venues were [[Parken Stadium|Parken]] in Copenhagen (which held approximately 38,000 people when [[Denmark]] hosted in 2001<ref name="milestones"/>) and the [[Esprit Arena]] in Düsseldorf (which held approximately 36,500 people when Germany hosted in 2011). The smallest town to have been hosts was [[Millstreet]] in [[County Cork]], Ireland, in 1993. The village had a population of 1,500<ref>{{cite web |publisher= ''[[Republic of Ireland]]''|url= http://www.ria.gov.ie/filestore/publications/English-CORK-_Millstreet-FINALISED.pdf|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5iLzAiOSQ|archivedate= 18 July 2009|title=General Information on Millstreet|format=PDF|accessdate=17 July 2009}}</ref>—although the [[Green Glens Arena]] venue could hold up to 8,000 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.millstreet.ie/green%20glens/greenglens.htm|title=Green Glens Arena|publisher=''[[Millstreet|Town of Millstreet]]''|accessdate=19 July 2009}}</ref>

=== Host country ===
After the first two contests were hosted by Switzerland and Germany, it was decided that henceforth the winning country would host the contest the next year.<ref name="milestones"/> The winner of the 1957 Contest was the Netherlands, and Dutch television accepted the responsibility of hosting in 1958. In all but five of the years since this rule has been in place, the winning country has hosted the show the following year. The exceptions are:

* {{ESCYr|1960}}—hosted by the [[BBC]] in London when the Netherlands declined due to expense. The UK was chosen to host because it had come second in 1959.<ref name="50yrs"/>
* {{ESCYr|1963}}—hosted by the BBC in London when France declined due to expense. Although the UK had only come fourth in 1962, Monaco and Luxembourg (who came second and third) had also declined.<ref name="50yrs"/>
* {{ESCYr|1972}}—hosted by the BBC in [[Edinburgh]] when Monaco was unable to provide a suitable venue: [[Télé Monte Carlo|Monegasque television]] invited the BBC to take over due to its previous experience.<ref name="50yrs"/>
* {{ESCYr|1974}}—hosted by the BBC in [[Brighton]] when Luxembourg declined due to expense. The BBC was becoming known as the host by default, if the winning country declined.<ref name="ESC1974"/>
* {{ESCYr|1980}}—hosted by the [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]] in [[The Hague]] when Israel declined due to expense, having staged the {{ESCYr|1979}} event in Jerusalem, and the fact that the date chosen for the contest (19 April) was [[Yom Hazikaron|Israel's Remembrance Day]] that year. The Dutch offered to host the contest after several other broadcasters (including the BBC) were unwilling to do so.<ref name="50yrs"/> The reluctance of those national broadcasters to stage the contest were due to already having hosted the event during the past couple of years, in addition to the expense involved.

Since 1981, all contests have been held in the country which won the previous year.

=== Eurovision logo and theme ===
[[File:Eurovision Song Contest logo.svg|thumb|right|Logo used in 2004–2014]]
The current generic logo was introduced for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004 Eurovision Song Contest]] in Turkey, to create a consistent visual identity. The host country's flag appears in the heart of the generic logo. Each year of the contest, the host country creates a sub-theme which is usually accompanied and expressed with a sub-logo and slogan. The theme and slogan are announced by the [[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]] and the host country's national broadcaster.

The generic logo was revamped in 2014, ten years after the first generic logo was created. The revamped logo was conducted by lead designer Cornelis Jacobs and his team of Cityzen Agency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=eurovision_song_contest_logo_evolves|title=Eurovision Song Contest logo evolves|work=[[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]]|first=Jarmo|last=Siim|accessdate=31 July 2014}}</ref> The logo was used for the first time in the [[2015 Eurovision Song Contest]], the 60th anniversary of the contest.

=== Slogans ===
Since the 2002 contest, slogans (or themes) have been introduced in the show (2009 being the only exception). The slogan is decided by the host broadcaster and based on the slogan, the theme and the visual design are developed.

=== Eurovision Week ===
The term "Eurovision Week" is used to refer to the week during which the Contest takes place.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7418045.stm | work=BBC News | title=Serbia in spotlight for Eurovision | date=23 May 2008 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref> As it is a live show, the Eurovision Song Contest requires the performers to have perfected their acts in [[rehearsal]]s in order for the programme to run smoothly. In addition to rehearsals in their home countries, every participant is given the opportunity to rehearse on the stage in the Eurovision auditorium. These rehearsals are held during the course of several days before the Saturday show, and consequently the delegations arrive in the host city many days before the event. Journalists and fans are also present during the preceding days, and so the events of Eurovision last a lot longer than a few hours of television.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} A number of officially accredited hotels are selected for the delegations to stay in, and shuttle-bus services are used to transport the performers and accompanying people to and from the contest venue.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]'' |date=17 March 2008 |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news/belgrade-2008?id=587 |title=Belgrade 2008 |accessdate=19 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20080518160711/http://www.eurovision.tv:80/page/news/belgrade-2008?id=587 |archivedate=18 May 2008 }}</ref>

Each participating broadcaster nominates a Head of Delegation, whose job it is to coordinate the movements of the delegate members, and who acts as that country's representative to the EBU in the host city.<ref name="2005rules">{{cite web|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|year=2005|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/searchfiles_english/574.htm |title=Rules of the 2005 Eurovision Song Contest|accessdate=10 February 2006 |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20060210010517/http://www.eurovision.tv/searchfiles_english/574.htm |archivedate = 10 February 2006}}{{dead link|date=May 2015}}</ref> Members of the delegations include performers, lyricists, composers, official press officers and—in the years where songs were performed with a live orchestra—a conductor. Also present if desired is a commentator: each broadcaster may supply their own commentary for their TV and/or radio feed, to be broadcast in each country. The commentators are given dedicated commentary booths situated around the back of the arena behind the audience.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

=== Rehearsals and press conferences ===
[[File:Lena Oslo3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lena Meyer-Landrut|Lena]], representing Germany, performing [[Satellite (Lena Meyer-Landrut song)|Satellite]] during a rehearsal in 2010]]
Since 2004, the first rehearsals have commenced on the Sunday almost two weeks before the Grand Final. There are two rehearsal periods for each country. The countries taking part in the semi-finals have their first rehearsal over four days from the first Sunday to Wednesday. The second is from Thursday to Sunday. The countries which have already directly qualified for the Grand Final rehearse on the Saturday and Sunday.<ref name="eurovision.tv">[http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2012/RehearsalSchedule2012/_press_v1.1pdf ]{{Dead link|date=September 2012}}</ref>

[[File:2006ch Press Conference.jpg|thumb|left|[[Switzerland]] hosting a press conference at Eurovision 2006.]]
After each country has rehearsed, the delegation meets with the show's artistic director in the video viewing room. Here, they watch the footage of the rehearsal just performed. At this point the Head of Delegation may make known any special requirements needed for the performance, and request them from the host broadcaster. Following this meeting, the delegation hold a press conference where members of the accredited press may pose them questions.<ref name="RehearsalSchedule">{{cite web|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|year=2008|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/media/ESC2008_rehearsals.pdf|title=Rehearsal Schedule|format=PDF|accessdate=19 July 2009}}</ref> The rehearsals and press conferences are held in parallel; so one country holds its press conference, while the next one is in the auditorium rehearsing. A printed summary of the questions and answers which emerge from the press conferences is produced by the host press office, and distributed to journalists' [[Pigeon-hole messagebox|pigeon-holes]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|year=2008|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/interviews-2008?id=944|title=Interviews 2008|accessdate=21 June 2009}}</ref>

Before each of the semi-finals three dress rehearsals are held. Two rehearsals are held the day before (one in the afternoon and the other in the evening), while the third is held on the afternoon of the live event. Since tickets to the live shows are often scarce, tickets are also sold in order that the public may attend these dress rehearsals.

The same applies for the final, with two rehearsals on the Friday and the third on Saturday afternoon before the live transmission of the grand final on Saturday evening.<ref name="RehearsalSchedule"/> For both semi-finals and for the final, the second dress rehearsal is also the ''Jury Final'', this is where the jury from each country casts their votes. This means that 50% of the result is already decided before the live contests have taken place.<ref name="eurovision.tv"/>

=== Parties and Euroclub ===
On the Monday evening of Eurovision Week, a ''Mayor's Reception'' is traditionally held, where the city administration hosts a celebration that Eurovision has come to their city. This is usually held in a grand municipally owned location in the city centre. All delegations are invited, and the party is usually accompanied by live music, complimentary food and drink and—in recent years—[[fireworks]].<ref name="AthensNews">{{cite web|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|date=11 May 2009|url= http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=2560|title=The grand opening reception!|accessdate=19 July 2009}}</ref>

After the semi-final and grand final there are after-show parties, held either in a facility in the venue complex or in another suitable location within the city.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=2793|title=After Show Party: Reactions|accessdate=20 June 2009}}</ref>

A ''Euroclub'' is held every night of the week: this is a Eurovision-themed [[nightclub]], to which all accredited personnel are invited.<ref name="Euroclub">{{cite web|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=2309|title=The EuroClub: Official party venue opened its doors|accessdate=18 July 2009}}</ref>

During the week many delegations have traditionally hosted their own parties in addition to the officially sponsored ones. However, in the new 2000 millennium the trend has been for the national delegations to centralise their activity and hold their celebrations in the Euroclub.<ref name="Euroclub"/>

== Rules ==
{{further2|[[Rules of the Eurovision Song Contest]]}}

Numerous detailed rules must be observed by the participating nations, and a new version is produced each year, for instance the rules specify various deadlines, including the date by which all the participating broadcasters must submit the final recorded version of their song to the EBU. The rules also cover sponsorship agreements and rights of broadcasters to re-transmit the show. The most notable rules which affect the format and presentation of the contest have changed over the years, and are highlighted here.

=== Live music ===
All vocals must be sung live; no voices are permitted on backing tracks.<ref name="2009rules"/> In 1999, the Croatian song featured sounds on their backing track which sounded suspiciously like human voices. The Croatian delegation stated that there were no human voices, but only digitally synthesised sounds which replicated vocals. The EBU nevertheless decided that they had broken the spirit of the rules, and docked them 33% of their points total that year for the purpose of calculating their five-year points average for future qualification.<ref name="ESC1999">{{cite web|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=314|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1999|accessdate=21 July 2009}}</ref>

From 1956 until 1998, the host country was required to provide a live orchestra. Prior to 1973, all music had to be played by the host orchestra. From 1973 onwards, pre-recorded backing tracks were permitted—although the host country was still obliged to provide a live orchestra in order to give participants a choice. If a backing track was used, then all the instruments heard on the track were required to be present on the stage. In 1997 this requirement was dropped.<ref name="50yrs"/>

In 1999 the requirement for a live orchestra was abolished: it was left as an optional contribution.<ref name="1999rules"/> The host that year, Israel's IBA, decided not to use an orchestra in order to save expenses, and thus 1999 was the first year when all the songs were played as pre-recorded backing tracks (in conjunction with live vocals).

=== Language ===
{{Main|Languages in the Eurovision Song Contest}}

Each submission must have vocals; purely instrumental music has never been allowed. Originally, competitors were required to sing in their own national language, but this rule has been changed several times over the years. From 1956 until 1965, there was no rule restricting the languages in which the songs could be sung. In 1966 a rule was imposed stating that the songs must be performed in one of the official languages of the country participating, after Sweden presented its 1965 entry in English.<ref name="milestones"/>

The language restriction continued until 1973, when performers were again allowed to sing in any language they wished.<ref name="ESC1973">{{cite web|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=289|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1973|accessdate=21 July 2009}}</ref> Several winners in the mid-1970s took advantage of this: performers from non-English-speaking countries sang in English, including [[ABBA]] in 1974.

In 1977, the EBU decided to revert to the national language restriction. However, special dispensation was given to Germany and Belgium as their national selections had already taken place; both countries' entries were in English.<ref name="ESC1977">{{cite web|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=293|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1977|accessdate=21 July 2009}}</ref>

In 1999 the rule was changed to allow the choice of language once more.<ref name="ESC1999"/> Belgium entered the 2003 Contest with "[[Sanomi]]", a song sung in a [[constructed language]],<ref name="ArtificialLanguages">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=554|title=Ishtar for Belgium to Belgrade!|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|first=Andreas |last=Schacht|date=9 March 2008|accessdate=19 July 2009}}</ref> finishing in second place. In 2006 the Dutch entry, "[[Amambanda]]", was sung partly in English and partly in an artificial language.<ref name="ArtificialLanguages"/> In 2008 the Belgian entry, "[[O Julissi]]", was sung in an artificial language.<ref name="ArtificialLanguages"/> In 2011 the Norwegian entry, "[[Haba Haba]]", which was sung in English and [[Swahili language|Swahili]], was the first song to be sung in an African language, apart from Arabic.<ref name="AfricanLanguage">{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/16749|title=Norway sends Stella Mwangi to Eurovision 2011|publisher=''EscToday.com''|first=Victor|last=Hondal|date=12 February 2011|accessdate=19 February 2011}}</ref>

=== Voting ===
{{further2|[[Voting at the Eurovision Song Contest]]}}

The voting system used in the contest has changed over the years. The current system has been in place since 1975, and is a [[positional voting system]]. Countries award 12 points to their favourite song, then 10 to the second favourite, and then scores from 8 down to 1 to another eight songs.<ref name="ESC1975">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=291|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1975|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|accessdate=23 July 2009}}</ref>

Historically, a country's votes were decided by an internal jury, but in 1997 five countries (Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom) experimented with [[televoting]], giving members of the public in those countries the opportunity to vote ''en masse'' for their favourite songs. The experiment was a success,<ref name="50yrs">{{cite book | last = O'Connor | first = John Kennedy | year = 2005 | title = The Eurovision Song Contest 50 Years The Official History | publisher = Carlton Books Limited | location = London|isbn = 1-84442-586-X}}</ref> and from 1998 onwards all countries were encouraged to use televoting wherever possible. Back-up juries are still used by each country, in the event of a televoting failure. Nowadays members of the public may also vote by SMS, in addition to televoting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200705/11/eng20070511_373758.html |title=People's Daily Online – Eurovision Song Contest semi-final held in Helsinki |publisher=English.people.com.cn |date=11 May 2007 |accessdate=15 May 2011}}</ref> From 2013, the public may also vote via a [[mobile app]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=eurovision_song_contest_app_launched|title=Eurovision Song Contest app launched!|publisher=Eurovision.tv |date=7 May 2013 |accessdate=3 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/static/app/|title=Download the official Eurovision app|publisher=Eurovision.tv |date=3 November 2014 |accessdate=3 November 2014}}</ref>

The current method for ranking entries is a 50/50 combination of both [[televoting|telephone vote]] and the votes of five jurymember made up of music professionals in each country.<ref name="2010 voting">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=4533&_t=Exclusive%3A+Juries+also+get+50%25+stake+in+Semi-Final+result!|title=Exclusive: Juries also get 50% stake in Semi-Final result!|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=11 October 2009|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]]''|accessdate=2014-11-08}}</ref> It was first used in the final of the&nbsp;[[Eurovision Song Contest 2009|2009 edition]], and extended the following year to the semi-finals.
In the event of a televoting(insufficient amount of votes/technical issues) or jury failure(technical issue/breach of rules), only a jury/televoting was used by each country<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/results?event=1883&voter=MD|title=Full Splitt Results|last=|first=|date= May 2014|work=European Broadcasting Union|publisher=eurovision.tv|accessdate=28 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/results?event=1893&voter=GE |title=Full Splitt Results|last=|first=|date= May 2014|work=European Broadcasting Union|publisher=eurovision.tv|accessdate=28 January 2015}}</ref>

Since 1964 the voting has been presided over by the EBU [[scrutineer]], who is responsible for ensuring that all points are allocated correctly and in turn. The following are the scrutineers and Executive Supervisors of the Eurovision Song Contest appointed by the EBU:
* {{flagicon|Switzerland}} [[Rolf Liebermann]] (1956)
* {{flagicon|Yugoslavia}} Miroslav Vilček (1964–1965)
* {{flagicon|UK}} [[Clifford Brown (scrutineer)|Clifford Brown]] (1966–1977)
* {{flagicon|Switzerland}} Frank Naef (1978–1992)
* {{flagicon|Germany}} Christian Clausen (1993–1995)

* {{flagicon|Sweden}} [[Svante Stockselius]] (2004–2010)
* {{flagicon|Norway}} [[Jon Ola Sand]] (2011–present)

According to one study of [[Voting at the Eurovision Song Contest#Regional block voting|Eurovision voting patterns]], certain countries tend to form "clusters" or "cliques" by frequently voting in the same way.<ref name="FennEtAl">{{cite arXiv |first1= Daniel|last1= Fenn|first2= Omer|last2= Suleman|first3= Janet|last3= Efstathiou|first4=Neil F.|last4= Johnson |year= 2006|eprint= physics/0505071|title= How does Europe Make Its Mind Up?

==== Presentation of votes ====
[[File:Eurovision 2004 Scoreboard.jpg|right|thumb|Electronic scoreboard, as [[Johnny Logan (singer)|Johnny Logan]] announces the Irish votes in 2004]]
After the interval act is over, when all the points have been calculated, the presenter(s) of the show call upon each voting country in turn to invite them to announce the results of their vote. Prior to 1994 the announcements were made over [[telephone line]]s; with the audio being piped into the auditorium for the audience to hear, and over the television transmission. However thanks to Moya Doherty from RTE  since and including 1994 the announcements are done in vision. Often the opportunity is taken by each country to show their spokesperson standing in front of a backdrop which includes a famous place in that country. For example, the French spokesperson might be seen standing in front of the Eiffel Tower.

From 1957 to 1962, the participating countries were called in reverse order of the presentation of their songs, and from 1963 to 2003, they were called in the same order in which their songs had been presented (except for 1974). Since 2004, when semi-finals were introduced, the order of the countries' announcements of votes has changed; and the countries that did not make it to the final each year could also vote. In 2004, the countries were called in alphabetical order (according to their [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2|ISO codes]]).<ref>{{cite web|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|date=12 May 2004|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/archive_2004/english/1098.htm |title=Eurovision 2004 – Voting Briefing|accessdate=7 May 2005 |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20050507155415/http://www.eurovision.tv/archive_2004/english/1098.htm |archivedate = 7 May 2005}}{{dead link|date=May 2015}}</ref> In 2005, the votes from the non-qualifying semi-finalists were announced first, in their running order on the Thursday night; then the finalists gave their votes in their own order of performance. Between 2006 and 2010, a separate draw was held to determine the order in which countries would present their votes.<ref name="2006draw">{{cite web|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|date=21 March 2006|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/english/2038.htm |title=Results from the draw|accessdate=27 May 2006 |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20060527003915/http://www.eurovision.tv/english/2038.htm |archivedate = 27 May 2006}}{{dead link|date=May 2015}}</ref> In 2011, the voting order was determined by the results of a jury the day before the final so as to create as much suspense as possible when the votes were revealed.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=esctoday.com|date=11 May 2011|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/17435|title=Eurovision 2011: Voting order revealed!}}</ref>

From 1971 to 1973, each country sent two jurors, who were present at the contest venue (though the juries in 1972 were locked away in the Great Hall of [[Edinburgh Castle]]) and announced their votes as the camera was trained on them. In 1973 one of the Swiss jurors made a great show of presenting his votes with flamboyant gestures. This system was retired the next year.<ref name="50yrs"/>

In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1956|1956]] no public votes were presented: a closed jury simply announced that Switzerland had won.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=273|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1956|work=Eurovision.tv}}</ref> From 1957 to 1987, the points were displayed on a physical [[scoreboard]] to the side of the stage. As digital graphic technology progressed, the physical scoreboards were superseded in 1988 by an [[Computer graphics|electronic representation]] which could be displayed on the TV screen at the will of the programme's director.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=''[[BBC Online]]''|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/eurovision/mymu/atoz.shtml|title=A to Z of Eurovision|accessdate=9 August 2006 |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20060427103610/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/eurovision/mymu/atoz.shtml <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 27 April 2006}}{{dead link|date=May 2015}}</ref>

In 2006<ref name="2006draw"/> the EBU decided to save time during the broadcast—much of which had been taken up with the announcement of every single point—because there was an ever-increasing number of countries voting. Since then, votes from 1 to 7 from each country have been displayed automatically on screen and the remaining points (8, 10 and 12) are read out in ascending order by the spokesperson, culminating with the maximum 12 points. Countries must announce the country names and points in either English or French and the scores are repeated by the contest's presenters in the other language. The expression ''{{lang|fr|douze points}}'' when the host or spokesperson states the top score in French is popularly associated with the contest.<ref name="1999rules">{{cite web|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|date=13 October 1998 |url= http://www.eurosong.net/archive/esc1999.pdf|format=PDF|title=Rules of the 44th Eurovision Song Contest, 1999|accessdate=18 July 2006}}</ref>

==== Ties for first place ====
In {{ESCYr|1969}}, four of the sixteen countries taking part, France, Spain, the [[Netherlands]] and the United Kingdom, all tied for first place with 18 points each. There was nothing in the rules to decide an outright winner, so all four were declared joint winners. This caused much discontent among most of the other participating countries, and mass walkouts were threatened. [[Finland]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[Portugal]] did not participate in the 1970 Contest as a protest against the results of the previous year. This prompted the EBU to introduce a tie-break rule.<ref name="ESC1969">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=286|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1969|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|accessdate=23 July 2009}}</ref><ref name="ESC1970">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=223|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1970|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|accessdate=23 July 2009}}</ref>

Under the current rules, in the event of more than one country scoring the same total number of points, a count is made of the numbers of countries who awarded points to each of the tied countries, and the one who received points from the most countries is declared the winner. If the numbers are still tied, it is counted how many sets of maximum points (12 points) each country received. If there is still a tie, the numbers of 10-point scores awarded are compared—and then the numbers of 8-point scores, all the way down the list. In the extremely unlikely event of there then ''still'' being a tie for first place, the song performed earliest in the running order is declared the winner, unless the host country performed first in the running order. Since 2008, the same tie-break rule now applies to ties for all places.<ref name="2009rules">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/esc2009rules.pdf|title=Rules for the Eurovision Song Contest 2009|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|format=PDF|accessdate=18 July 2009}}</ref>

As of {{CURRENTYEAR}}, the only time since 1969 when two or more countries have tied for first place on total points alone was in 1991, when France and Sweden both totalled 146 points. At that time, the rules did not include counting the numbers of countries awarding any points to these countries' songs, but began with tallying up the numbers of 12-point scores awarded. Both France and Sweden had received four sets of 12 points. However, because Sweden had received more sets of 10-point scores, they were declared the winners. Had the current rule been in play, France would have won instead.<ref name="50yrs"/>

=== Broadcasting ===
Each participating broadcaster is required to broadcast the show in its entirety: including all songs, recap, voting and reprise, skipping only the interval act for advertising breaks if they wish.<ref name="2009rules"/> From 1999 onwards, broadcasters who wished to do so were given the opportunity to take more advertising breaks as short, non-essential hiatuses were introduced into the programme.<ref name="1999rules"/> Three major interruptions or preemptions of the contest broadcast have taken place since 1999. The Dutch state broadcaster pulled their broadcast of the 2000 final to provide emergency news coverage of a major incident, the [[Enschede fireworks disaster]]. Spain's RTVE delayed their broadcast of the second semi-final in the 2009 Contest, due to the [[2009 Mutua Madrileña Madrid Open|Madrid Open]] tennis tournament. The Albanian state broadcaster deferred their broadcast of the first semi-final in 2012 to provide emergency news coverage of the [[Qafa e Vishës bus accident]].

==== Political recognition issues ====
In 1978, during the performance of the Israeli entry, the Jordanian broadcaster [[JRTV]] suspended the broadcast and showed pictures of flowers. When it became apparent during the later stages of the voting sequence that Israel was going to win the contest, JRTV abruptly ended the transmission.<ref name="50yrs"/> Afterwards, the Jordanian news media refused to acknowledge that Israel had won and announced that the winner was Belgium (who had actually come in 2nd place).<ref>{{cite web|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=294|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1978|accessdate=18 July 2009}}</ref> In 1981 JRTV did not broadcast the voting because the name of Israel appeared on the scoreboard.

In 2005, [[Lebanon]] intended to [[Lebanon in the Eurovision Song Contest|participate in the contest]]. However, Lebanese law does not allow recognition of Israel, and consequently Lebanese television did not intend to transmit the Israeli entry. The EBU informed them that such an act would breach the rules of the contest, and Lebanon was subsequently forced to withdraw from the competition. Their late withdrawal incurred a fine, since they had already confirmed their participation and the deadline had passed.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=''[[BBC News Online]]''|date=18 March 2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4362373.stm|title=Lebanon withdraws from Eurovision|accessdate=15 July 2006}}</ref> However, the Eurovision Song Contest albums were still being sold in Lebanese music stores until 2009, with the word Israel erased from the back cover. As of 2010, the albums were banned completely from sale.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In 2009, the song "[[We Don't Wanna Put In]]" was selected to represent [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. However, the song text was banned by Eurovision as it was interpreted as criticism against [[Prime Minister of Russia]] [[Vladimir Putin]] after the [[Russo-Georgian War]] the previous year. When asked to change the lyrics of the song, the Georgian broadcaster [[Georgian Public Broadcaster|GPB]] withdrew from the 2009 contest.<ref>References are found in "[[We Don't Wanna Put In]]"</ref>

=== Other ===
* In the first contest in 1956, there was a recommended time limit of 3½ minutes per song.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/history/1956/56_rules.pdf|title=Reglement du Grand Prix Eurovision 1956 De La Chanson Européenne|format=PDF|accessdate=19 July 2009}}</ref> In 1957, despite protests, the Italian song was 5:09 minutes in duration. This led to a stricter time limit of 3 minutes precisely.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=274|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1957|accessdate=19 July 2009}}</ref> Since the three-minute time limit was adopted in 1960, some artists have had songs longer than three minutes, which must be edited down to 3 minutes, though some songs exceed that time by a few seconds. Many of the entries also have longer versions (including different languages) for commercial release, and since the 1990s, some are released in additional remixed versions.
* The EBU impose no restrictions on the nationalities of the performers or songwriters. Individual broadcasters are, however, permitted to impose their own restrictions at their discretion.<ref name="2005rules"/>
* From 1957 to 1970 (in 1956 there was no restriction at all) only soloists and duos were allowed on stage. From 1963, a chorus of up to three people was permitted. Since 1971, a maximum of six performers have been permitted on the stage.<ref name="2005rules"/>
* The performance and/or lyrics of a song "must not bring the Contest into disrepute". No lyrics, speeches, gestures of a political or similar nature are permitted. No swearing or unacceptable language is allowed, neither are commercial messages.<ref name="2009rules"/>
* From 1990 onwards, all people on stage must be at least 16 years of age.<ref name="2009rules"/>
* Each performance may consist of a maximum of six people on stage. No live animals.<ref name="2009rules"/>
* Each artist may perform for only one country per year.
* The music and text must not have been published or performed before 1 September of the year before the contest is held. Many countries also have the additional rule that the song shall never have been [[Performance|performed]] before the relevant national Eurovision Contest. Covers, reworked or sampled versions of older songs are not allowed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2012/ESC_2012_public_version_Rules_ENG.pdf|title=Extracts from the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest rules|work=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=20 February 2012}}</ref>

== Expansion of the contest ==

[[File:Eurovision participation map.svg|thumb|Participants in the Eurovision Song Contest, coloured by decade of debut.]]
[[File:Eurovision Participants 1992.svg|thumb|Regular participants in 1992. [[Yugoslavia]] is coloured in red: 1991 was the last year in which that nation participated under one name.]]
[[File:Regular Participants 1994.svg|thumb|Regular participants in 1994. Changes from 1992 include the addition of Central and Eastern European countries, and the separation of ex-Yugoslavian states.]]

The number of countries participating has steadily grown over time, from seven in 1956 to over 20 in the late 1980s. In 1993, twenty-five countries participated in the competition, including, for the first time, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia, entering independently due to the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|dissolution of Yugoslavia]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=235|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1993|accessdate=25 June 2009}}</ref>

Because the contest is a live television programme, a reasonable time limit must be imposed on the duration of the show. In recent years the nominal limit has been three hours, with the broadcast occasionally overrunning.<ref name="1999rules"/>

=== Pre-selections and relegation ===
Since 1993, and following the cessation of the Eastern European OIRT network and the merger with the EBU, there have been more entries than there is time to reasonably include in a single TV show. Several relegation or qualification systems have been tried in order to limit the number of countries participating in the contest at one time. Thus the 1993 Contest introduced two new features: first, a pre-selection competition was held in [[Ljubljana]] in which seven [[Eastern Bloc|new countries]] fought for three places in the international competition. Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia took part in ''[[Kvalifikacija za Millstreet]]''; and the three former Yugoslav republics, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia, qualified for a place in the international final.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=235|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1993|accessdate=22 July 2009}}</ref> Also to be introduced that year was "relegation": the lowest-placed countries in the 1993 score table were not invited in 1994, to allow the countries which failed the 1993 pre-selection into the 1994 Contest. The 1994 Contest included—for the first time—Estonia, Romania, Slovakia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland and Russia.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=309|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1994|accessdate=22 July 2009}}</ref>

Relegation continued in 1994 and 1995;<ref>{{cite web|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=310|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1995|accessdate=22 July 2009}}</ref> but in 1996 a different pre-selection system was used, in which nearly all the countries participated. Audio tapes of all the songs were sent to juries in each of the countries some weeks before the television show. These juries selected the songs which would be included in the international broadcast.<ref name="ESC1996">{{cite web|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=311|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1996|accessdate=18 July 2009}}</ref> Norway, as the host country in 1996 (having won the previous year), automatically qualified and so did not need to go through pre-selection.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

One country which failed to qualify in the 1996 pre-selection was Germany. As one of the largest financial contributors to the EBU, their non-participation in the contest brought about a funding issue, which the EBU would have to consider.<ref name="ESC1996"/>

{{Anchor|Big Four|Big Five}}

=== Big Four and Big Five ===
Since 2000, [[France in the Eurovision Song Contest|France]], [[Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest|Germany]], [[Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest|Spain]] and [[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest|United Kingdom]] have automatically qualified for the final, regardless of their positions on the scoreboard in previous contests, as they are the four biggest financial contributors to the [[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]].<ref name="1999rules"/> These countries became known as the "Big Four". On 31 December 2010, it was announced that [[Italy in the Eurovision Song Contest|Italy]] would compete in the Eurovision Song Contest after a fourteen-year absence and that it would also automatically qualify for the final, joining the other four qualifiers to become the "Big Five", considered by some to be a controversial decision.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|title=43 nations on 2011 participants list|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=22833&_t=43+nations+on+2011+participants+list!|publisher=''Eurovision.tv''|accessdate=31 December 2010|date=31 December 2010}}</ref> Germany became the first and, as of 2015, the only "Big Five" country to win the contest since the rule was made in 2000, when [[Lena Meyer-Landrut]] won the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010|2010 Contest]]. [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest|Turkey]] withdrew from the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2013|2013 Contest]] with the status of the "Big Five" being one of the reasons cited.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jiandani|first=Sanjay|title=Turkey will not go to Eurovision in Malmö|url=http://www.esctoday.com/40037/turkey-will-not-be-in-malmo/|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=14 December 2012|date=14 December 2012}}</ref>

=== Qualification and semi-finals ===

{{legend|#63BE7B|100%}} {{legend|#FFEB84|50%}} {{legend|#F8696B|0%}}]]
From 1997 to 2001, countries qualified for each contest based on the average of their points totals for their entries over the previous five years.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|url= http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=312|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1997|accessdate= 26 June 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|url= http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=266|title=Eurovision Song Contest 2001|accessdate= 26 June 2009}}</ref> However, there was much discontent voiced over this system because a country could be excluded merely because of poor previous results, which did not take into account how good a fresh attempt might be. This led the EBU to create what was hoped would be a more permanent solution to the problem. A qualification round, known as the semi-final, was introduced for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004 Contest]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|url= http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=9|title=Eurovision Song Contest 2004 Semi-final|accessdate= 22 July 2009}}</ref> This semi-final was held on the Wednesday during Eurovision Week, and was a programme similar in format to the grand final, whose time slot remained 19:00 UTC on the Saturday. The highest-placed songs from the semi-final qualified for the grand final, while the lower-placed songs were eliminated. From 2005 to 2007, the semi-final programme was held on the Thursday of Eurovision Week.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|url= http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=157|title=Eurovision Song Contest 2005 Semi-final|accessdate= 22 July 2009}}</ref> In these two shows there was enough time to include all the countries who wished to participate.

The ten highest-placed non-Big Four countries in the "grand final" were guaranteed a place in the following year's grand final, without having to qualify. If, for example, Germany came in the top ten, the eleventh-placed non-Big-Four country would automatically qualify for the next year's grand final.<ref name="2005rules"/> The remaining countries—which had not automatically qualified for the grand final—had to enter the semi-final.<ref name="2005rules"/>

At the 50th annual meeting of the EBU reference group in September 2007, it was decided that, with still more nations entering, starting from the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008 contest]] onwards ''two'' semi-finals would be held,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ebu.ch/CMSimages/en/PR_ESC%20Semi-Finals_01%2E10%2E07_EN_tcm6-54154.pdf|title=Eurovision Song Contest – Two Semi-finals in 2008|date=1 October 2007|accessdate=18 July 2009|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|format=PDF}}</ref> from each of which one could qualify for the final.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/05/16/1084646073107.html | title=Bubble rapt | date=17 May 2004 | work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref> From 2008 onwards, the scoreboard position in previous years has not been relevant, and—save for the automatic qualifiers—all participating countries have had to participate in the semi-finals, regardless of their previous year's scoreboard position. The only countries which automatically qualify for the grand final are the host country and the Big Five: France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, who continue to enjoy their protected status.<ref name="2009rules"/>

In each of the semi-finals the voting is conducted among those countries which participate in that semi-final. With regard to the automatic grand final qualifiers, who do not participate in the semi-finals, a draw is conducted to determine in which semi-final each of them will be allowed to vote. In contrast, ''every'' participating country in a particular year may vote in the Saturday grand final – whether their song qualified for the final or not.

The ten countries which receive the most votes in each semi-final qualify for the grand final. They are announced by the presenters in English and French, in a random order. Full voting results are withheld until after the grand final, whereupon they are published on the EBU's website.<ref name="2009rules"/>

There have been a number of Eurovision artists and groups whose careers were directly launched into the spotlight following their win.

=== Winning countries ===
{{Esccnty|Ireland}} holds the record for the highest number of wins, having won the contest seven times—including three times in a row in 1992, 1993, and 1994. {{Esccnty|Sweden}} are second with six wins as of 2015. {{Esccnty|France}}, {{Esccnty|Luxembourg}} and the {{Esccnty|United Kingdom}} are joint third with five wins. Next comes the {{Esccnty|Netherlands}}, with four victories. Three countries have won three times, {{Esccnty|Denmark}}, {{Esccnty|Israel}} and {{Esccnty|Norway}}. Five countries have won twice, {{Esccnty|Austria}}, {{Esccnty|Germany}}, {{Esccnty|Italy}}, {{Esccnty|Spain}} and {{Esccnty|Switzerland}}.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/1999/may/29/davidsharrock|title=Discord at pop's Tower of Babel|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=29 May 1999|first=David|last=Sharrock|accessdate=16 May 2013}}</ref>

The United Kingdom holds the record for the highest number of runner-up placings, coming in second on no less than [[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest#Contestants|15 occasions]] as of 2015.

The early years of the contest saw many wins for "traditional" Eurovision countries: France, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. However, the success of these countries has declined in recent decades; the Netherlands last won in 1975; France, in 1977; and Luxembourg, in 1983. Luxembourg last entered the contest in 1993.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.esctoday.com/3221/luxembourg_never_to_return_to_the_contest/ |title=Eurovision Song Contest – Dusseldorf 2011 &#124; News – 'Luxembourg never to return to the contest' |publisher=Esctoday.com |date=5 September 2008 |accessdate=22 May 2011}}</ref>

The first years of the 21st century produced numerous first-time winners, from both "new" and long-serving countries who had previous entered numerous times but without victories. Every year from 2001 to 2008 inclusive, a country won for its first time. Estonia was the first post-Soviet country to win the competition in 2001. The 2006 winner was {{Esccnty|Finland}}, which finally won after having entered the contest for 45 years. {{Esccnty|Ukraine}}, on the other hand, did not have to wait so long, winning with only their second entry in 2004.

{{Esccnty|Serbia}} won the very first year it entered as an independent state, in 2007, with a [[Molitva|ballad]] in Serbian language.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society-article.php?yyyy=2007&mm=05&dd=13&nav_category=113&nav_id=41193 |title=News – Serbia wins Eurovision Song Contest |publisher=B92 |date= |accessdate=15 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20071122210407/http://www.b92.net:80/eng/news/society-article.php?yyyy=2007&mm=05&dd=13&nav_category=113&nav_id=41193 |archivedate=22 November 2007 }}</ref> Interestingly, in 2004, {{Esccnty|Serbia and Montenegro}} also almost won the initial year it entered as a competitor state, finishing up second behind Ukraine, also with a [[Lane moje|ballad]] in Serbian language.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.rs/books?id=Eq7nilnv93cC&pg=PA143&lpg=PA143&dq=serbia+montenegro+lane+moje+second&source=bl&ots=GE8LQSbGBW&sig=iAepyVj1Ikm1vB506lyfSxIOiys&hl=sr&sa=X&ei=CbnwVNrYFYGzUd3PgfAM&ved=0CFkQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=serbia%20montenegro%20lane%20moje%20second&f=false|title=A Song for Europe|work=google.rs}}</ref> Other relatively quick winners were {{Esccnty|Latvia}}, who won in 2002, only their third year competing, and Azerbaijan, who won in 2011 in only their fourth year in the competition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/year|title=By year|work=Eurovision.tv}}</ref>

The country that has participated the longest without any win is {{Esccnty|Portugal}}, which made its debut in 1964 and has never finished in the top five. {{Esccnty|Malta}} is the most successful country without a win, achieving two-second places and two third places.<ref name="History of Eurovision song contest">{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/year |title=History of Eurovision song contest |publisher=Eurovision.tv |date=20 October 2014 |accessdate= 20 October 2014}}</ref>

In 2009, {{Esccnty|Norway}} won the contest with 387 points, the highest total in the history of the competition, becoming the first competitor to score 300 or more points, including 16 maximum scores. This feat was emulated in 2012, when Sweden won with 372 points, but with a new record of 18 maximum scores.<ref name="History of Eurovision song contest"/> In 2015, {{Esccnty|Sweden}} won the contest with 365 points, becoming the first competitor to ever reach 300 points or more twice while winning both times. {{Esccnty|Russia}} placed second with 303 points, becoming the first country to score more than 300 points without winning.

Since the introduction of the [[Voting at the Eurovision Song Contest#Voting Systems|50/50 voting system]] in 2009, the juries and the voters haven't agreed on the winner twice, in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011|2011]] and in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2015|2015]]. [[Azerbaijan in the Eurovision Song Contest 2011|2011 winner Azerbaijan]] won only the televotes and [[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015|2015 winner Sweden]] won only the jury votes.

Since the introduction of semi-finals, six countries, other than the big five, have always reached the final: {{Esccnty|Azerbaijan}}, {{Esccnty|Bosnia and Herzegovina}}, {{Esccnty|Greece}}, {{Esccnty|Romania}}, Russia, and {{Esccnty|Ukraine}}. However, both Bosnia and Herzegovina and Ukraine have missed at least one contest since the inception of the semi-finals.<ref name="History of Eurovision song contest"/> Also Greece is the only country that has qualified from the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996|1996 Pre-qualifying round]] and from all the semi finals they've participated.

The show, entitled [[Congratulations: 50 Years of the Eurovision Song Contest]] after [[Cliff Richard]]'s {{ESCYr|1968}} [[Congratulations (song)|entry]] for the United Kingdom, was held in Copenhagen, and featured a competition among fourteen of the most popular songs from the last 50 years of the contest. A telephone vote was held to determine the most popular Eurovision song of all-time, which was won by ABBA's "[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]" (winner for Sweden in {{ESCYr|1974}}).<ref>{{cite news| publisher= ''[[BBC News Online]]''| date= 23 October 2005 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4366574.stm |title= Abba win 'Eurovision 50th' vote|accessdate=20 July 2006}}</ref> The event was hosted by the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997 Contest]] winner for the United Kingdom, [[Katrina Leskanich]], and Latvia's representative on its debut at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000 Contest]], [[Renārs Kaupers]].

In 2015, the EBU had decided again to commemorate the contest and agreed with the United Kingdom's broadcaster, BBC, to produce a show for the 60th anniversary of the contest, after evaluating several proposals from member broadcasters in regards to the anniversary celebration beyond the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2015|2015 Contest]] in May.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/71929/ebu-pan-european-survey/|title=EBU: A pan-European survey|website=esctoday.com|publisher=ESCToday|last=Borg|first=Luje|accessdate=9 December 2013|date=9 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://eurovoix.com/2015/01/29/60th-anniversay-bbc-confirmed-as-show-producers/|title=60th Anniversay: BBC Confirmed As Show Producers|website=eurovoix.com|publisher=Eurovoix|accessdate=29 January 2015|date=29 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/eurovision-2015-bbc-to-produce-60th-anniversary-special-3451/|title=Eurovision 2015: BBC to produce 60th anniversary special|website=officialcharts.com|publisher=Official Charts Company|accessdate=29 January 2015|date=29 January 2015}}</ref> The event, entitled [[Eurovision Song Contest's Greatest Hits]], took place at the [[Eventim Apollo]] in [[Hammersmith]], [[London]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Roxburgh|first1=Gordon|title=Official: London to host Eurovision's 60th Anniversary Event|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=official_london_to_host_eurovisions_60th_anniversary_event|website=eurovision.tv|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=3 February 2015|date=3 February 2015}}</ref> and featured [[Eurovision Song Contest's Greatest Hits#Participating countries|fifteen acts from thirteen countries]] in the official line-up.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Freeman|first1=Guy|title=Eurovision's Greatest Hits - full line-up revealed!|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/eurovision/entries/8aedd078-e506-4242-9df3-9b8a14b03ead|website=bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 February 2015|format=6 February 2015}}</ref><ref name="Event Details">{{cite web|last1=Jiandani|first1=Sanjay|title=United Kingdom: 4 more Eurovision acts join the party!|url=http://esctoday.com/94879/united-kingdom-join-party/|website=esctoday.com|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=5 February 2015|date=5 February 2015}}</ref> Unlike the 50th anniversary show in 2005 which was broadcast live, this event didn't feature a competition and was pre-recorded to be televised across Europe and other EBU members on various dates schedule by the respective broadcasters. The event was hosted by the British commentator for Eurovision, [[Graham Norton]], and the host of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2013|2013 Contest]], [[Petra Mede]].

In late 2011, the EBU had begun archiving all the contests since the first edition in 1956 in order to be finalised before the 2015 Contest, for the 60th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=38943|title=EBU starts Eurovision archive project|last=Siim|first=Jarmo|accessdate=8 October 2011|date=8 October 2013|website=eurovision.tv|publisher=EBU}}</ref> It was later reported that the archive is ready and will be released on the 60th anniversary with making the content available to journalists in broadcast-ready formats while also giving public accessibility to "selected content" through the official Eurovision website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://escxtra.com/2013/06/archive-to-be-opened-in-time-for-60th-anniversary/|title=General: Archive to be opened in time for 60th Anniversary|website=escxtra.com|publisher=escXtra|accessdate=4 June 2013|date=4 June 2013|last=N.|first=Danny}}</ref>

== Criticism and controversy ==
The contest has been the subject of criticism regarding both its musical and political content.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=''[[BBC News Online]]''|date=9 May 2007 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/berkshire/6640231.stm|title=Politics 'not Eurovision factor'|accessdate= 25 May 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|publisher=''[[BBC News Online]]''|date=14 May 2007 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6654719.stm|title=Malta slates Eurovision's voting|accessdate= 25 May 2008}}</ref> For example, on rare occasions, certain countries have been booed when performing or received points, specially when being given by a neighbour country. Most recently in 2014 and 2015, Russia was heavily booed when it qualified to the final and received high points.<ref>[http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-27306108 "BBC News – Russia booed at Eurovision semi-final"]. ''BBC''. 2014-05-07. Retrieved 2014-05-13.</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Wyatt|first1=Daisy|title=Eurovision 2015: Russia booed despite song contest’s best efforts to put 'music over politics'|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/eurovision/eurovision-2015-russia-booed-despite-song-contests-best-efforts-to-put-music-over-politics-10272901.html|website=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=29 May 2015|date=24 May 2015}}</ref> The reason for the booing is considered to be due to Russian intervention in Ukraine and opposition to the country's policy on LGBT rights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/culturehousedaily/2014/05/eurovision-2014-the-booing-of-russia-was-a-disgrace/|title=Eurovision 2014: the booing of Russia was a disgrace|work=Spectator Blogs}}</ref>

=== Musical style and presentation ===
Because the songs are playing to such a diverse supranational audience with contrasting musical tastes, and countries want to be able to appeal to as many people as possible to gain votes, this has led to the music of the contest being characterised as a "mishmash of power ballads, ethnic rhythms and bubblegum pop".<ref>{{cite news|first=Paul |last=Majendie|date=11 August 2007|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKL1142844820070814|publisher=''[[Reuters]]''|title=Edinburgh Fringe show celebrates Eurovision kitsch|accessdate=18 July 2009}}</ref> This well-established pattern, however, was notably broken in 2006 with Finnish hard rock band [[Lordi]]'s victory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovisionaustria.com/blog/eurovisions-diamond-day/ |title=Eurovision's Diamond Day}}</ref> As Eurovision is a visual show, many performances attempt to attract the attention of the voters through means other than the music, notably elaborate lighting sequences and [[pyrotechnics]]; sometimes leading to bizarre on-stage theatrics, costumes, including the use of revealing dress.<ref>Paul Allatson, "'[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a776540935?words=allatson&hash=267716188 Antes cursi que sencilla’: Eurovision Song Contests and the Kitsch Drive to Euro-Unity]," in the Special issue on Creolisation: Towards a Non-Eurocentric Europe, in ''Culture, Theory and Critique'', vol. 48, no. 1 (Spring 2007): 87–98.</ref>

=== Political and geographical voting ===
The contest has long been accused by some of political bias: the perception is that judges and televoters allocate points based on their nation's relationship to the other countries, rather than the musical merits of the songs.<ref>{{cite news |publisher= ''[[BBC News Online]]'' |date=16 May 2004|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/3719157.stm |title= Eurovision votes 'farce' attack |accessdate= 15 July 2006}}</ref> According to one study of Eurovision voting patterns, certain countries tend to form "clusters" or "cliques" by frequently voting in the same way.<ref name="FennEtAl"/> Another study concludes that as of 2006, [[voting bloc]]s have, on at least two occasions, crucially affected the outcome of the contest.<ref name="Gatherer">Derek Gatherer. "[http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/9/2/1.html Comparison of Eurovision Song Contest Simulation with Actual Results Reveals Shifting Patterns of Collusive Voting Alliances.]", ''Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation''  vol. 9, no. 2. 31 March 2006. Retrieved 14 May 2011.</ref> On the other hand, others argue that certain countries allocate disproportionately high points to others because of similar musical tastes and cultures and because they speak similar languages,<ref>[http://w.ecares.org/ecare/personal/ginsburgh/papers/153.eurovision.pdf Ginsburgh, Victor and Abdul Noury. 2006. The Eurovision Song Contest Is Voting Political or Cultural?]</ref><ref>{{cite web |author= Spierdjik, Laura; Vellekoop, Michel|date=18 May 2006|url= http://doc.utwente.nl/66198/1/1794.pdf|title=Geography, Culture, and Religion: Explaining the Bias in Eurovision Song Contest Voting|publisher=rug.nl|accessdate=3 June 2015|format=PDF}}</ref> and are therefore more likely to appreciate each other's music.

Another influential factor is the high proportion of [[expatriate]]s and ethnic minorities living in certain countries. Although judges and televoters cannot vote for their own country's entry, expatriates can vote for their country of origin.

The total numbers of points to be distributed by each country are equal, irrespective of the country's population. Thus voters in countries with larger populations have less power as individuals to influence the result of the contest than those voting in smaller countries. For example, [[San Marino]] holds the same voting power as Russia despite the vast geographic and population differences between them.

To try to reduce the effect of voting blocs, national juries were re-introduced alongside televoting in the final in 2009: each contributing 50% of the vote.<ref name="juryconfirmed">{{cite web |url=http://esctoday.com/news/read/12655 |title=EBU confirms 50/50 vote for Eurovision Song Contest |last=Viniker |first=Barry |date=8 December 2008 |publisher=''ESCToday'' |accessdate=8 December 2008}}</ref> This hybrid system was expanded in 2010 to also be implemented in the semi-finals.<ref name="Countries">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=7923&_t=Exclusive%3A+39+countries+to+be+represented+in+Oslo|title=Exclusive: 39 countries to be represented in Oslo|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=31 December 2009|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]]''|accessdate=31 December 2009}}</ref> However, since 1994 no country has won two years in a row, and semi-finals have also been won by different countries, until 2012 when Sweden won the second semi-final in 2011 and 2012. Although many of them used to give their 12 points to the same country each year, like [[Cyprus]] and [[Greece]], it has been noticed that factors such as the sets of other high votes received (7, 8 or 10 points) and the number of countries giving points to a specific entry, also highly affect the final positions.

=== Running order of the participating songs ===
{{Copy edit|section|date=October 2015}}
The final running order of the competing performances at the semi-finals and the final were decided by the producers of the show and approved by the EBU Executive Supervisor and the Reference Group, as had been done since the 2013 Contest, and in contrast to a draw system for the contest's editions up until 2012; that is excluding an ongoing draw method for the host country's direct position at the final.<ref name=follow_live_heads_of_delegations_meet_in_vienna>{{cite web|title=Heads of Delegations meet in Vienna|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=follow_live_heads_of_delegations_meet_in_vienna|website=eurovision.tv|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=16 March 2015}}</ref> With the aim of making the shows more exciting and ensuring that all contestants had a chance to stand out, preventing entries that are too similar cancelling each other out.<ref name="running order">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=running_order_malmoe_2013_to_be_determined_by_producers|title=Running order Malmö 2013 to be determined by producers|last=Siim|first=Jarmo|date=7 November 2012|work=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=9 November 2012}}</ref> The decision elicited mixed reactions from both fans of the contest and participating broadcasters.<ref name="running order fans">{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/?p=38497|title=Mixed feelings about Eurovision rule change|last=Repo|first=Juha|date=8 November 2012|publisher=ESCToday.com|accessdate=22 November 2012}}</ref><ref name="running order ireland">{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/?p=39057|title=Ireland reacts to running order rule|last=Jiandani|first=Sanjay|date=19 November 2012|publisher=ESCToday.com|accessdate=22 November 2012}}</ref><ref name="running order san marino">{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/?p=39020|title=San Marino reacts to running order rule|last=Sanjay|first=Jiandani|date=16 November 2012|publisher=ESCToday.com|accessdate=22 November 2012}}</ref><ref name="running order moldova">{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/?p=38649|title=Moldova reacts to running order rule|last=Jiandani|first=Sanjay|date=14 November 2012|publisher=ESCToday.com|accessdate=22 November 2012}}</ref>
The running order is decided by the producers, approved by the EBU Executive Supervisor and the Reference Group of the contest, some consider it to be controversial, there can be a risk of corruption, manipulation and benefits for some countries, running position is considered by some to be of importance to the result.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esctips.com/2012/11/07/producers-to-decide-eurovision-running-order/|title=Producers To Decide Eurovision Running Order|author=Gavster|work=esctips.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=eurovision 2013 running order rule change controversy|url=https://eurovisiontimes.wordpress.com/2012/11/09/eurovision-2013-running-order-rule-change-controversy/|last=|first=|date= November 9, 2012|publisher=Eurovisiontimes|accessdate=23 May 2015}}</ref> There has been allegations that EBU and the producers some years deliberately gave some highly ranked artists a bad running position and the favourites of the producers and the EBU had a better starting position.<ref>{{cite web|title=Startnummeranalys|url=http://blogg.dn.se/melodifestivalen2015/2015/05/22/startnummeranalys/|last=Fahl|first=Hanna|date=22 May 2015|publisher=DN|accessdate=23 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=De är hotet mot Måns Zelmerlöw i finalen|url=http://www.expressen.se/noje/de-ar-hotet-mot-mans-zelmerlow-i-finalen/ |last=Färsjö|first=Therese|date=22 May 2015|publisher=Expressen|accessdate=23 May 2015}}</ref>
