Flirty Fishing was practiced by members of Berg's inner circle starting in 1973, and was introduced to the general membership in 1976, when it became widely practiced by members of the group. In some areas, Flirty Fishers used escort agencies to meet people.

He suggested that for those who were in dire need of physical love and affection, even sex could be used as evidence to them of the Lord's love. ... The motivation, guiding principle, and reasoning behind the FFing ministry was that through this sacrificial proof of love, some would better accept and understand God's great love for them. The goal was that they would come to believe in and receive God's own loving gift of salvation through His Son, Jesus, who gave His life for them. By this unorthodox method David felt many would find the Lord's love and salvation, who never would have otherwise.</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>In his judgment of a child custody court case in England in 199495, after extensively researching COG publications and hearing the testimony of numerous witnesses, Lord Justice Sir<space/><link><target>Alan Ward (judge)</target><part>Alan Ward</part></link><space/>said the following about Flirty Fishing:</paragraph><paragraph><template><target>quote</target><arg name="I am quite satisfied that most of the women who engaged in this activity and the subsequent refinement of ESing, (which was finding men through escort agencies), did so in the belief that they were spreading God's word. But I am also totally satisfied that that was not Berg's only purpose. He and his organization had another and more sordid reason. They were procuring women to become common prostitutes. They were knowingly living in part on the earnings of prostitution. That was criminal activity. Their attempts to deny this must be dismissed as cant and hypocrisy. To deny that the girls were acting as prostitutes because 'we are not charging but we expect people to show their thanks and their appreciation and they ought to give more for love than if we charged them' is an unacceptable form of special pleading. The 'FFers handbook' told the girls that fishing could be fun but fun did not pay the bills. 'You've got to catch a few to make the fun pay for itself. So don't do it for nothing'.<ref name">"WardJudgment">[http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Judgment_of_Lord_Justice_Ward Judgment of the Rt. Hon.

The judge concluded that it was only in &quot;the last months of 1977 Berg started counseling the members that it was permissible for proselyting reasons to offer sexual contacts and services to perspective<space/><template><target>sic</target></template><space/>members, the more so when the latter were potentially good financial contributors to the cult&quot;.

In 1987, new rules banned, under penalty of<space/><link><target>excommunication</target></link>, sexual contact with non-members. However, the new rules also stated that exceptions would be allowed.

After some complaints from people who stated that they had been abused as children by adults, a new rule, that sexual interactions should not occur between an adult and a minor, was put in place.</paragraph><heading level='3'>The Family (19821994)</heading><paragraph>At the end of 1983, TF was reporting 10,000 full-time members living in 1,642 TF Homes.

The rights referred to in the Charter were what a member could expect to receive from the group and how members were to be treated by leaders and fellow members.

The Charter has been amended over the years according to changes within the group. TFI's 2010 policies state that all members must tithe (give 10% of their income) or give a monthly contribution in order to retain membership, as per Biblical instructions.</paragraph><paragraph>In the 1994-95 British court case,<space/><link><target>The Right Honorable</target><part>the Rt.

However, he found that TF had abandoned these practices and concluded that they were a safe environment for children. Nevertheless, he did require that the group cease all corporal punishment of children in the United Kingdom and denounce any of Berg's writings that were &quot;responsible for children in TF having been subjected to sexually inappropriate behaviour&quot;.</paragraph><heading level='3'>The Family International (2004present)</heading><paragraph>In 2004, the movement's name was changed to The Family International.

Internal publications spoke of arresting a general trend towards a less dedicated lifestyle, and the need for re-commitment to the group's mission of fervent evangelism. In the second half of 2004, a six-month period was held to help members refocus their priorities (known as<space/><italics>The Renewal</italics>). The group was reorganized, with new levels of membership defined into the following categories: Family Disciples (FD), Missionary Members (MM), Fellow Members (FM), Active Members (AM), and General Members (GM).</paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><italics>Love Charter</italics><space/>governs FDs, while the<space/><italics>Missionary Member Statutes</italics><space/>and<space/><italics>Fellow Member Statutes</italics><space/>were written for the governance of TFI's Missionary member and Fellow Member circles, respectively.

TFI teaches that the<space/><link><target>Bible</target></link><space/>and &quot;Mo letters&quot; from leader David Berg, aka Moses David, are the inspired Word of God and revelation. Berg proclaimed himself to be the last and most anointed<space/><link><target>prophet</target></link><space/>of the<space/><link><target>end times</target></link>,<extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/HomeARC_ML_3197</extension><space/>predicted in the Old and New Testaments, specifically in the reference to &quot;a prophet like Moses&quot; (although Christians recognize that Simon Peter was referring to Christ in this passage, as was Moses in Deuteronomy).<extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/HomeARC_ML_1642</extension><space/>Berg is regarded by TFI members as a prophet who passed on God's message, and his writings are seen by them as &quot;filling in the gaps&quot; (par.24)<extension extension_name='ref' name="HomeARC_ML_0329">http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/HomeARC_ML_0329</extension><space/>in the Bible. Members claim that Berg's writings never contradict or are irreconcilable with Scripture, and that they only accentuate what is already in the Bible. However, if members think that his teachings contradict the Bible, they are urged to let The Bible take precedence over them. The group believes Berg's spiritual &quot;mantle&quot; passed to his wife,<space/><link><target>Karen Zerby</target></link>, at his death. The couple's officially published writings are regarded as part of the &quot;Word of God,&quot; nearly equal in weight and importance to the Bible as divine revelations. These beliefs have been re-addressed in recent publications<extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Reboot-03:_Backtracking_Through_TFI_History#David.E2.80.99s_writings</extension><space/>issued in 2010, which say they are no longer requirements of membership. However neither Berg's nor Zerby's prophetic status has been retracted.</paragraph><paragraph>TFI members believe that the<space/><link><target>Great Commission</target></link><space/>to evangelize the world is every Christian's duty, and that their lives should be dedicated to serving God and others. Among their several levels of membership, the most committed &quot;Family Disciples&quot; (FD) live<space/><link><target>commune (intentional community)</target><part>communally</part></link>. The group encourages having children. While birth control was at first sharply discouraged as<space/><italics>ungodly</italics>, the choice is now left to the individual; the practice is not uncommon, though it was officially regarded as indicating lack of trust in God's plan. Birth-control views were among those re-addressed in 2010.</paragraph><paragraph>A central tenet of TFI theology is the &quot;Law of Love&quot; which, stated simply, claims that if a person's actions are motivated by unselfish, sacrificial love and are not intentionally hurtful, they are in accordance with Scripture and thus lawful in the eyes of God. Though the romantic and sexual implication of this principle is<space/><link><target>polyamory</target></link>, the &quot;Law of Love&quot; emphasizes unselfishness, giving, caring, respect, honesty, and other essential Christian values that should be enacted in every facet of life (they use Matthew 22:3740 and Galatians 5:14 as the ostensible bases for this belief). The members believe that this law supersedes all other Biblical laws, except those forbidding male<space/><link><target>homosexuality</target></link>, which they believe is a<space/><link><target>sin</target></link>. Female<space/><link><target>bisexuality</target></link><space/>is allowed, though a lesbian life that completely excludes men is not. TFI teaches that God created<space/><link><target>human sexuality</target></link>, that it is a natural, emotional, and physical need, and that<space/><link><target>heterosexual</target></link><space/>relations between consenting adults constitute a pure and natural wonder of God's creation,<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/The_Devil_Hates_Sex'>&lt;cite&gt;The Devil Hates Sex!

Since 2010, the age of consent in TFI is determined by local laws and regulations. Since 1986,<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Liberty_or_Stumbling_Block'>&lt;cite&gt;Liberty or Stumblingblock?&lt;/cite&gt;</link>, by Sara Kelley, November 1986</extension><space/>sex between minors and adults has been forbidden. Adult members may have sex with any other adult member of the opposite sex, and are encouraged to do so, regardless of marital status, as a way to foster unity and combat loneliness of those &quot;in need&quot;. This is commonly called &quot;sharing&quot;, or &quot;sacrificial sex&quot;. While TFI policy states that members should not be pressured into sex against their will, numerous former members have alleged they were coerced to &quot;share&quot; or cast as selfish or unloving if they did not. These issues were also re-addressed in 2010, reflecting a need to change this aspect of TFI culture to respect personal sexual decisions and become more inclusive of differing personal views.</paragraph><paragraph>TFI members believe they are living in the period the Bible calls the &quot;<link><target>End times</target><part>Last Days</part></link>&quot; or the &quot;Time of the End&quot;, the era immediately preceding Christ's return.

Although prophecy, also referred to as<space/><link><target>channeling (mediumistic)</target><part>channeling</part></link>, has been a part of the movement from the beginning, it has assumed greater significance under Zerby's leadership.</listitem></list><heading level='4'>Spirit Helpers</heading><list type='ident'><listitem>These include<space/><link><target>angel</target><trail>s</trail></link>, departed humans, other religious and mythical figures, and even celebrities; for example the goddess<space/><link><target>Aphrodite</target></link>, the Snowman,<space/><link><target>Merlin</target></link>, the<space/><link><target>Sphinx</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Elvis</target></link>,<extension extension_name='ref'>http://pubs.xfamily.org/text.php?t=3059</extension><space/><link><target>Marilyn Monroe</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Audrey Hepburn</target></link>,<extension extension_name='ref'>http://pubs.xfamily.org/text.php?t=3060</extension><space/><link><target>Nixon</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Winston Churchill</target></link>. Spirit helpers are sent to give instruction and to help fight the spiritual warfare going on alongside the physical world. TFI members believe that beseeching spirit helpers by name, or naming demons when rebuking or cursing them, makes their prayers more powerful. As a result, TFI regularly publishes names of individual helpers and demons, as well groups of them, noting their respective areas of power. TFI members of all ages are encouraged to &quot;channel&quot; their spirit helpers, to be possessed by and communicate with them frequently, and receive spirit stories from them.</listitem></list><heading level='4'>The Keys of the Kingdom</heading><list type='ident'><listitem>TFI believes that the Biblical passage &quot;I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatsoever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven&quot; (<template><target>bibleref</target><arg>Matthew</arg><arg>16:19</arg></template>), refers to an increased spiritual authority given to Peter and the early disciples. These keys were hidden and unused in the centuries that followed, but were revealed again through Karen Zerby as additional power for praying and obtaining miracles. TFI members call on the various Keys of the Kingdom for extra effect during prayer. The Keys are also believed to power various<space/><link><target>supernatural</target><part>spiritual</part></link><space/><link><target>spacecraft</target></link><template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">August 2009</arg></template><space/>(known as Key Craft); and they can transform into spiritual swords for fighting demons.

Male members are cautioned to visualize themselves as women, in order to avoid a homosexual relationship with Jesus. Many TFI publications, and spirit messages claimed to be from Jesus himself, elaborate this intimate, sexual relation they believe Jesus desires and needs.

Most of them have assumed many leadership positions in the organization, including chairmanships of international, regional, and national boards.</paragraph><paragraph>However, a small number of second-generation members have left to pursue secular careers or higher education, and to rear their children in a different environment. There is little anti-TFI sentiment among those who have left (examples include<space/><link><target>Rose McGowan</target></link>, as well as sisters Celeste Jones, Kristina Jones, and Julianna Buhring, who wrote a book<extension extension_name='ref' name="nwms">Jones, K., Jones, C. &amp; Buhring, J. 2007 &quot;Not Without My Sister&quot;, Harper Collins Publishing, London</extension><space/>on their lives in TFI).<extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.notwithoutmysister.com/bios.php</extension><space/>Several former members have legally pursued alleged physical and sexual abusers, who, they say, are shielded by the group's leaders.</paragraph><paragraph>Some former<space/><link><target>Missionary Kids</target></link><space/>have returned to the country of their citizenship, where they are<space/><link><target>Third Culture Kids</target></link><space/>(TCKs). Many have kept in communication with each other. A notable example of this is the site MovingOn.org, created by a former second-generation member in 2001 (closed down as of February 2009).</paragraph><paragraph>Some SGAs who remained in the group were vocal defenders of TFI's lifestyle. One outlet for their views was MyConclusion.com,<extension extension_name='ref' name="MyConclusion"><link type='external' href='http://www.myconclusion.com'>MyConclusion.com</link><space/>Opinions and responses by current second-generation members with positive viewpoints about TFI</extension><space/>a site opened shortly after the 2005 murder-suicide of SGA Rick Rodriguez and Angela Smith. Yet in subsequent years, some of those same second-generation adults left and became just as vocal, or more so, in opposing TFI. This seems to illustrate the effects of mental conditioning and group-think on TFI youth, including the rejection of (and by) the group upon their exit.</paragraph><paragraph>Members are encouraged to remain friendly with relatives who have left. However, they are discouraged from associating with anyone considered enemies of TFI, including ex-members who appear on television programs or publish books and articles denouncing the group.</paragraph><paragraph>Several former SGAs have reported alleged crimes to law enforcement, testified against TFI in court, and publicly criticized the group's members and practices. In the past, TFI used the term<space/><italics><link><target>apostate</target></link></italics><space/>for such former members, and argued that their testimony was unreliable. Some TFI members have claimed that SGAs who alleged abuse were mentally unstable,<space/><link><target>demonic possession</target><part>demonically possessed</part></link>, or paid by anti-cult movements. Former SGAs often resent the &quot;apostate&quot; label, noting they never chose to join the group. Since 2009, TFI documents have discouraged using pejorative terms for former members. They express the need to understand and respect the decisions of former members, and to support them in establishing themselves outside the group. TFI's past literature, however, and its general culture, continue to make life difficult for second- and third-generation members who leave.<space/></paragraph><heading level='3'>Secrecy</heading><paragraph>TFI members are expected to respect legal and civil authorities where they live. Members have typically cooperated with appointed authorities, even during the police and social-service raids of their communities in the early 1990s.<extension extension_name='ref'>Bainbridge, William Sims (2002). &quot;The Endtime Family: Children of God&quot;.<space/><italics>State University of New York Press</italics>, Albany, NY.</extension><space/>However, a controversial belief taught and practiced by a small number of members holds that it is right to lie to non-members (or &quot;unbelievers&quot;) to protect God's work. This belief is commonly referred to as &quot;deceivers yet true&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://xfamily.org/index.php/Deceivers_yet_true'>Deceivers yet true XFamily Children of God</link></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Extreme secrecy surrounding leadership and finances, and aversion to government oversight, have been consistent throughout TFI's history. World Services (WS), its central administrative wing, operates in seclusion, very few members even knowing its whereabouts. Since 2010, workers' families have been told the location of specific WS centers, but the information is not otherwise available.</paragraph><paragraph>It is not uncommon for senior leaders to legally change their names. There have been allegations that membersincluding senior leadersuse forged or fraudulently obtained passports from Australia, Canada, the United States, and other countries. Senior leaders typically try not to publish their legal names; this has become more difficult because of legal action in many countries. In particular, a major court case in England brought to light many formerly guarded names of senior members.</paragraph><paragraph>In TFI's older publications, printed photographs of WS members were typically censored by means of a rudimentary pencil drawing over the person's face. In TFI-produced art, Berg's head was often replaced with that of a lion.</paragraph><paragraph>After Berg's death in 1994, members and the public were finally allowed to see photographs of him. In 2005, several current photos of Karen Zerby, Steven Kelly, and leading WS members were leaked online.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Category:Photos_of_Family_Leaders'>Photos of TFI leaders</link></extension><space/>This marked the first time in nearly 30 years that images of Zerby were publicly available. Since the TFI policy changes of 2009-10, the level of secrecy has changed somewhat. Pictures of Zerby and Kelly can now be found online,<extension extension_name='ref'>http://karenzerby.org/</extension><space/>and<template><target>When</target><arg name="date">February 2011</arg></template><space/>Kelly carries pictures of Zerby with him to show members. But Zerby's and Kelly's whereabouts are still heavily guarded secrets, and TFI's structure and organization remain closed to any public accounting or government oversight.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Finances</heading><paragraph>TFI finances are based on a system of<space/><link><target>tithe</target><part>tithing</part></link>. All members are required to donate 10% of their income to World Services. A further 3% is required for regional offices of locally administered projects and a community lending program, and a final 1% is demanded for regional literature publishing. Supplementary giving to TFI offices and leadership, beyond the 14% is encouraged and fairly common.</paragraph><paragraph>Additional income comes from marketing products such as children's videos and music (under varied names such as<space/><link><target>Treasure Attic</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Kiddy Viddy</target></link>) and selling posters on the street. In recent years, many TFI members have established associations and foundations subject to the accounting and auditing regulations where they live; since 2008, TFI documents have emphasized the need for members' charity works to be transparent and sustainable.</paragraph><paragraph>How TFI channels its funds around the world depends largely on the trust of carefully placed, non-senior members, who typically manage bank accounts that contain organization funds in their own names. Despite this practice, TFI says it has experienced very little graft; the publicized cases have involved insubstantial amounts of money.</paragraph><paragraph>In TFI's literature, impending global financial doom is a common theme. Accordingly, the group has gone to considerable lengths to avoid investments it deems unstable in the event of a crash. Typically, its reserves are stored in Japanese yen, Swiss francs, and gold. TFI has consistently avoided investing in real estate, stocks or bonds. Since many members are now creating businesses and charitable enterprises, and the group's end-time beliefs have been modified, long-term planning and investments are more common.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Reception</heading><paragraph>The group has been criticized by the press and the<space/><link><target>anti-cult movement</target></link>. In 1971, an organization called<space/><link><target>FREECOG</target></link><space/>was founded by concerned family members and followers, including<space/><link><target>deprogramming</target><part>deprogrammer</part></link><space/><link><target>Ted Patrick</target></link>, to &quot;free&quot; them from their involvement in the group.</paragraph><paragraph>Frequently, critics cite Berg's writings, and incidents of alleged criminal behavior by individuals. TFI members, meanwhile, argue that not all of Berg's writings reflect the group's fundamental beliefs (contained in the &quot;Statement of Faith&quot;) or policies (contained in the 1995 &quot;Love Charter&quot;). They also reject judging the entire group for the wrongdoing of individuals, even when those individuals are at the highest leadership levels.</paragraph><paragraph>Due to the high commitment nature of the group and its controversial beliefs, the movement tends to generate strong feelings of faith or anger in both current and former members.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Programs, projects, and productions</heading><paragraph>TFI has numerous programs, local foundations, and projects through which it operates around the world.
