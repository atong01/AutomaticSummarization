The first, &quot;Nemesis of the Daleks&quot; (#152155), with the Seventh Doctor, features an appearance of a Dalek Emperor. Speaking with the Emperor, the Doctor addresses him as Davros, but the Emperor responds &quot;Who is Davros?&quot; The Doctor initially assumes Davros' personality has been totally subsumed, but in the later strip &quot;<link><target>Emperor of the Daleks</target></link>&quot; (#197202) this Emperor is shown as a different entity from Davros. Set prior to<space/><italics><link><target>Remembrance of the Daleks</target></link></italics><space/>in Davros' timeline, but after in the timeline of the Doctor, the latter, accompanied by<space/><link><target>Bernice Summerfield</target></link>, together with help from the Sixth Doctor, ensures that Davros will survive the wrath of the Daleks so that he can assume the title of Emperor, allowing history to take its course. &quot;Up Above the Gods&quot; (#227), a vignette following up on this, features the Sixth Doctor and Davros having a conversation in the TARDIS.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Audio plays</heading><paragraph>Terry Molloy has reprised his role as Davros in the<space/><link><target>Doctor Who spin-offs</target><part>spin-off</part></link><space/><link><target>radio drama</target><part>audio plays</part></link><space/>produced by<space/><link><target>Big Finish Productions</target></link>, mostly notably<space/><italics><link><target>Davros (Doctor Who audio)</target><part>Davros</part></link></italics><space/>(taking place during the<space/><link><target>Sixth Doctor</target></link>'s era), which, through flashbacks, explored the scientist's life prior to his crippling injury, which is attributed to a Thal nuclear attack (an idea that first appeared in<space/><link><target>Terrance Dicks</target></link>' novelisation of<space/><italics>Genesis of the Daleks</italics>).</paragraph><paragraph><italics>Davros</italics>, which does not feature the Daleks, apparently fills in the gaps between<space/><italics>Resurrection of the Daleks</italics><space/>and<space/><italics>Revelation of the Daleks</italics>,<extension extension_name='ref'>A timeline provided with<space/><italics>The Complete Davros Collection</italics><space/>placed<space/><italics>Davros</italics><space/>after<space/><italics>Resurrection of the Daleks</italics>.</extension><space/>and has the scientist trying to manipulate the galaxy's economy into a war footing similar to Skaro's. The Sixth Doctor manages to defeat his plans, and Davros is last heard when his ship explodes, an event obliquely mentioned in<space/><italics>Revelation</italics>. However the Doctor thinks he has survived. Davros also mentions he will work on a plan to combat famine, tying into Revelation of the Daleks.</paragraph><paragraph><italics><link><target>The Davros Mission</target></link></italics><space/>is an original audio adventure (without the Doctor) available on the Complete Davros Collection DVD box set. It takes place directly after the television story<space/><italics>Revelation</italics>, while leaving the planet Necros and beginning Davros' trial. At the end of<space/><italics>Davros Mission</italics>, he turns the tables on the Daleks, forcing them to do his bidding. The Big Finish miniseries<space/><link><target>List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish#I.2C Davros</target><part>I, Davros</part></link>, also features trial scenes, but mostly explores his early life. In those four stories, his journey is seen from his boyhood, to just before<space/><italics>Genesis of the Daleks</italics>.</paragraph><paragraph><italics><link><target>The Curse of Davros</target></link></italics><space/>begins with Davros and the Daleks working together to try and alter the outcome of the<space/><link><target>Battle of Waterloo</target></link><space/>using technology that Davros has created that allows him to swap peoples' minds, with matters becoming more complicated when the<space/><link><target>Sixth Doctor</target></link><space/>uses the device to swap bodies with Davros in an attempt to subvert the Daleks' plans from the inside. At the end, Davros is left with an army of Daleks who have had their minds wiped. These Daleks presumably become the &quot;Imperial Daleks&quot;, first seen in<space/><italics>Remembrance of the Daleks</italics>.</paragraph><paragraph>In<space/><italics><link><target>The Juggernauts</target></link></italics>, Davros is on the run from the original Daleks. He hatches a plan to add human<space/><link><target>Nervous system</target><part>tissue</part></link><space/>to robotic<space/><link><target>List of Doctor Who robots#M</target><part>Mechanoids</part></link>, using them, along with his own Daleks, to destroy the originals. At the end of the story, the<space/><link><target>self-destruct</target></link><space/>mechanism of Davros' life-support chair explodes, destroying an entire human colony. It is not clear how Davros survives to become the Dalek Emperor as seen in<space/><italics>Remembrance</italics>. However, in the DVD, the Davros Connections, director Gary Russell points out that the explosion of Davros' life-support chair leaves the listener to believe there is little of Davros left. This fits chronologically the fact that in &quot;Remembrance&quot; Davros is seen as a head inside the Emperor Dalek.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.purpleville.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/rtwebsite/DavrosBoxset.htm'>The Davros Connections DVD</link></extension></paragraph><paragraph>By the time of the<space/><link><target>Eighth Doctor</target></link><space/>audio play<space/><italics><link><target>Terror Firma</target></link></italics><space/>(set after<space/><italics>Remembrance</italics>), Davros is commanding a Dalek army which has successfully conquered the Earth. His mental instability has grown to the point where &quot;Davros&quot; and &quot;the Emperor&quot; exist within him as<space/><link><target>Disassociative identity disorder</target><part>different personalities</part></link>. His Daleks recognise this instability and rebel against Davros.

In the novel the Dalek Prime claimed that the planet Antalin had been<space/><link><target>Terraforming</target><part>terraformed</part></link><space/>to resemble Skaro and was destroyed in its place. A subterfuge to destroy Daleks aligned to Davros; both on Skaro (Antalin) and those that remained hidden within Dalek ranks on Skaro (original). Despite finding evidence of threat to Skaro via evidence found on 22nd century earth of Davros' mission to 1960s Earth and seeing the event via time-tracking equipment, the Dalek Prime allowed the destruction of Skaro to destroy Daleks allied to Davros. Dalek Prime also claimed that the Dalek/Movellan war (and indeed most of Dalek history before the destruction of &quot;Skaro&quot;) was actually faked for Davros' benefit; in fact another ruse designed to bait Davros into giving evidence against himself (as he does in his trial.) Skaro is later seen to be intact and undamaged, and one character notes that it is quite possible the Dalek Prime is lying in order to weaken Davros' claim to leadership of the Daleks, while using foreknowledge of events to destroy and entrap Davros and his allies.</paragraph><paragraph><italics>War of the Daleks</italics>, like the comic strips and audio plays, is of uncertain<space/><link><target>canon (fiction)</target><part>canonicity</part></link><space/>when it comes to the television series.At the conclusion of<space/><italics>War</italics>, Davros was seemingly disintegrated by a<space/><link><target>Dalek variants#Spider Daleks</target><part>Spider Dalek</part></link><space/>on the order of the Dalek Prime.
