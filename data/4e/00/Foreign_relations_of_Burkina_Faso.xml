Although the<space/><link><target>Agency for International Development</target></link><space/>(USAID) closed its office in<space/><link><target>Ouagadougou</target></link><space/>in 1995, about $18 million annually of USAID funding goes to Burkina's development through non-governmental and regional organizations. The largest is a<space/><link><target>Food for Peace</target></link><space/>school lunch program administered by<space/><link><target>Catholic Relief Services</target></link>.
