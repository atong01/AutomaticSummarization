'''Bjørn Lomborg''' ({{IPA-da|bjɶɐ̯n ˈlʌmbɒˀw|lang}}; born 6 January 1965) is a [[Denmark|Danish]] author and environmentalist who is an [[adjunct professor]] at the [[Copenhagen Business School]], director of the [[Copenhagen Consensus Center]] (a non-profit think tank), and a former director of the Danish government's [[Environmental Assessment Institute]] (EAI) in [[Copenhagen]]. He became internationally known for his best-selling and controversial book, ''[[The Skeptical Environmentalist]]'' (2001), in which he argues that many of the costly measures and actions adopted by scientists and policy makers to meet the challenges of global warming will ultimately have minimal impact on the world’s rising temperature.<ref>[http://foreignpolicyblogs.com/2013/10/23/a-candid-discussion-with-bjorn-lomborg/  A Candid Discussion with Bjorn Lomborg]</ref>

In 2002, Lomborg and the Environmental Assessment Institute founded the [[Copenhagen Consensus]], a project-based conference where prominent [[economists]] sought to establish priorities for advancing global welfare using methods based on the theory of [[welfare economics]].

In 2009, ''[[Business Insider]]'' cited Lomborg as one of "The 10 Most-Respected Global Warming Skeptics".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-ten-most-important-climate-change-skeptics-2009-7?op=1 | title=The 10 Most-Respected Global Warming Skeptics | publisher=Business Insider | date=30 July 2009 | accessdate=24 April 2015 | author=Weisenthal, Joe}}</ref> While Lomborg campaigned against the [[Kyoto Protocol]] and other measures to cut carbon emissions in the short-term, he argued for adaptation to short-term temperature rises, and for spending money on research and development for longer-term environmental solutions.  His issue is not with the reality of climate change, but rather with the economic and political approaches being taken (or not taken) to meet the challenges of that climate change.  He is a strong advocate for focusing attention and resources on what he perceives as far more pressing world problems, such as AIDS, malaria and malnutrition.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/oct/17/comment.climatechange | title=Sucked dry | publisher=The Guardian | date=17 Oct 2007 | accessdate=24 April 2015 | author=Lomborg, Bjorn}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704517504574589952331068322 | title=Time for a Smarter Approach to Global Warming | publisher=Wall Street Journal | date=15 Dec 2009 | accessdate=24 April 2015 | author=Lomborg, Bjorn}}</ref> In his critique of the 2012 [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]], Lomborg stated: "Global warming is by no means our main environmental threat."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/wrongheaded-in-rio | title=Wrongheaded in Rio|year=2012 |work=[[Project Syndicate]] | first1=Bjørn | last1=Lomborg}}</ref>  In 2011 and 2012, Lomborg was named a ''Top 100 Global Thinker'' by [[Foreign Policy]] "for looking more right than ever on the politics of climate change".<ref>[http://blog.ted.com/foreign-policy-releases-its-list-of-the-100-top-global-thinkers-including-17-ted-speakers/  Foreign Policy releases its list of the 100 Top Global Thinkers, including 17 TED speakers]</ref>

== Education ==
Lomborg spent a year as an undergraduate at the [[University of Georgia]], earned an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] degree in [[political science]] at the [[University of Aarhus]] in 1991, and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in political science at the [[University of Copenhagen]] in 1994.

== Career ==
Lomborg lectured in [[statistics]] in the Department of Political Science at the University of Aarhus as an [[assistant professor]] (1994&ndash;1996) and [[associate professor]] (1997&ndash;2005). He left the university in February 2005 and in May of that year became an adjunct professor in Policy-making, Scientific Knowledge and the Role of Experts at the Department of Management, Politics and Philosophy, [[Copenhagen Business School]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-management-politics-and-philosophy/events/appointment-of-bjoern-lomborg | title=Appointment of Bjørn Lomborg | publisher=Copenhagen Business School | date=3 June 2005 | accessdate=24 April 2015}}</ref>

Early in his career, his professional areas of interest lay in the simulation of strategies in [[collective action]] [[Ethical dilemma|dilemmas]], simulation of [[political party|party]] behavior in [[Party-list proportional representation|proportional voting systems]], and the use of surveys in [[public administration]].  In 1996, Lomborg's paper, "Nucleus and Shield: Evolution of Social Structure in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma", was published in the [[academic journal]], ''[[American Sociological Review]]''.<ref name=1996Nucleus>{{Cite journal  | last = Lomborg  | first = Bjørn  | authorlink =  | year = 1996  | month =  | title = Nucleus and Shield: The Evolution of Social Structure in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma  | journal = American Sociological Review  | volume = 61  | issue = 2  | pages = 278&ndash;307  | doi = 10.2307/2096335  | publisher = American Sociological Review, Vol. 61, No. 2  | jstor = 2096335 }}</ref>

Later, Lomborg's interests shifted to the use of statistics in the [[Environmental movement|environmental arena]]. In 1998, Lomborg published four [[essay]]s about the state of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] in the leading Danish newspaper ''[[Politiken]]'', which according to him "resulted in a firestorm debate spanning over 400 articles in major metropolitan newspapers."<ref>[http://www.lomborg.com/about/biography/ Bjørn Lomborg Biography], www.lomborg.com. Retrieved 26 February 2006.</ref> This led to the ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'', whose English translation was published as a work in [[environmental economics]] by Cambridge University Press in 2001. He later edited ''Global Crises, Global Solutions'', which presented the first conclusions of the Copenhagen Consensus, published in 2004 by the Cambridge University Press. In 2007, he authored a book entitled ''[[Cool It: The Skeptical Environmentalist's Guide to Global Warming]].''

In March 2002, the newly elected [[Centre-right|center-right]] [[prime minister]], [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]], appointed Lomborg to run Denmark's new [[Environmental Assessment Institute]] (EAI). On 22 June 2004, Lomborg announced his decision to resign from this post to go back to the University of Aarhus,<ref name=lomborg-error>{{cite web |last1=Fog|first1=Kåre |title=The functioning of the Environmental Assessment Institute |url=http://www.lomborg-errors.dk/lomborgstory15.htm |publisher=www.lomborg-errors.dk |accessdate=25 October 2015 |pages=15}}</ref> saying his work at the Institute was done and that he could better serve the public debate from the academic sector.

===Copenhagen Consensus===
{{anchor|Bjørn Lomborg#Copenhagen Consensus}} <!-- "Australian Consensus Centre" redirects here  -->
Lomborg and the Environmental Assessment Institute founded the Copenhagen Consensus in 2002, which seeks to establish priorities for advancing [[world|global]] welfare using methodologies based on the theory of welfare economics. A panel of prominent economists was assembled to evaluate and rank a series of problems every four years. The project was funded largely by the Danish government and was co-sponsored by ''[[The Economist]]''. A book summarizing the conclusions of the economists' first assessment, ''[[Global Crises, Global Solutions]]'', edited by Lomborg, was published in October 2004 by [[Cambridge University Press]].

In 2006, Lomborg became director of the newly established [[Copenhagen Consensus Center]], a Danish government-funded institute intended to build on the mandate of the EAI, and expand on the original Copenhagen Consensus conference.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/our-story | title=Our story | publisher=Copenhagen Consensus Center | accessdate=21 November 2014}}</ref> Denmark withdrew its funding in 2012 and the Center faced imminent closure.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/23/bjorn-lomborg-climate-thinktank-close | title=Bjorn Lomborg's climate sceptic thinktank to close | publisher=''The Guardian'' | date=23 Jan 2012 | accessdate=21 November 2014}}</ref><ref name="Guardian-17-Apr-2015" /> Lomborg left the country and reconstituted the Center as a non-profit organization in the United States.<ref name="cosmos">{{cite web | url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/earth-sciences/bj%C3%B8rn-lomborg-resilient-environmentalist | title=Bjørn Lomborg: The resilient environmentalist | publisher=''COSMOS Magazine'' | date=21 October 2013 | accessdate=21 November 2014 | author=Kloor, Keith}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/press-contact | title=Press Contact | publisher=Copenhagen Consensus Center | accessdate=21 November 2014}}</ref> The Center was based out of a "Neighborhood Parcel Shipping Center" in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], though Lomborg himself was based in [[Prague]] in the Czech Republic.<ref name="Conversation">{{cite news|url=http://theconversation.com/still-no-consensus-for-bjorn-lomborg-the-climate-change-refugee-45423|title=Still no consensus for Bjorn Lomborg, the climate change refugee|last=Holmes|first=David|work=The Conversation|date=30 July 2015|accessdate=30 July 2015}}</ref> In 2015, Lomborg described the Center's funding as "a little more than $1m a year...from private donations",<ref name="Guardian-17-Apr-2015" /> of which Lomborg himself was paid $775,000 in 2012.<ref name="Conversation" />

In April 2015, it was announced that an alliance between the Copenhagen Consensus Center and the [[University of Western Australia]] would see the establishment of the Australian Consensus Centre, a new policy research center at the UWA Business School. The University described the center's goals as a "focus on applying an economic lens to proposals to achieve good for Australia, the region and the world, prioritizing those initiatives which produce the most social value per dollar spent.".<ref name="news.uwa.edu.au">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.uwa.edu.au/201504027455/events/new-economic-prioritisation-research-centre-uwa|title=New economic prioritisation research centre at UWA|publisher=University of Western Australia|date=2 April 2015|accessdate=30 July 2015}}</ref> This appointment came under intense scrutiny, particularly when leaked documents revealed that the Australian government had approached UWA and offered to fund the Consensus Centre, information subsequently confirmed by a senior UWA lecturer.<ref name="SMH-23-Apr-2015">{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/bjorn-lomborg-centre-leaked-documents-cast-doubt-on-abbott-government-claims-20150423-1mqfnn.html|title=Bjorn Lomborg centre: leaked documents cast doubt on Abbott government claims|last1=Cox|first1=Lisa|last2=Knott|first2=Matthew|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=23 April 2015|accessdate=30 July 2015}}</ref> Reports indicated that Prime Minister [[Tony Abbott]]'s office was directly responsible for Lomborg's elevation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/prime-minister-tony-abbotts-office-the-origin-for-controversial-bjorn-lomborg-centre-decision-20150423-1mrha2.html|title=Prime Minister Tony Abbott's office the origin for controversial Bjorn Lomborg centre decision|last1=Massola|first1=James|last2=Knott|first2=Matthew|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=23 April 2015|accessdate=30 July 2015}}</ref> $4 million of the total funding for the center was to be provided by the Australian federal government,<ref name="Guardian-17-Apr-2015">{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/17/abbott-government-gives-4m-to-help-climate-sceptic-set-up-australian-centre|title=Abbott government gives $4m to help climate contrarian set up Australian centre|last=Taylor|first=Lenore|date=16 April 2015|accessdate=30 July 2015}}</ref> with UWA not contributing any funding for the centre.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Paul|title=Message from the Vice-Chancellor on the Australian Consensus Centre|url=http://www.news.uwa.edu.au/201505087564/message-vice-chancellor-australian-consensus-centre|publisher=University of Western Australia|accessdate=10 May 2015|date=8 May 2015}}</ref>

In July 2015, [[Flinders University]] senior management began quietly canvassing its staff about a plan to host the Lomborg Consensus Centre at the University, likely in the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences.

== ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' ==
:''Main article:'' ''[[The Skeptical Environmentalist]]''

In 2001, he attained significant attention by publishing ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'', a controversial book whose main thesis is that many of the most-publicized claims and predictions on environmental issues are wrong.

In the chapter on climate change in ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'', he states: "This chapter accepts the reality of man-made global warming but questions the way in which future scenarios have been arrived at and finds that forecasts of climate change of 6 degrees by the end of the century are not plausible".{{sfn|Lomborg|2001|p=259}} [[Cost–benefit analyses]], calculated by the [[Copenhagen Consensus]], ranked climate mitigation initiatives lowest on a list of international development initiatives when first done in 2004.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/sites/default/files/2004copenhagen_consensus_result_final.pdf | title=Copenhagen Consensus: The Results | publisher=Copenhagen Consensus Center | accessdate=21 November 2014}} "Optimal carbon tax," "The Kyoto Protocol," and "Value-at-risk carbon tax" ranked 15, 16, and 17 on a ranked list of 17 evaluated projects, with a collective Project Rating of Bad.</ref> In a 2010 interview with the ''[[New Statesman]]'', Lomborg summarized his position on climate change: "Global warming is real – it is man-made and it is an important problem.

=== Formal accusations of scientific dishonesty ===
After the publication of ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'', Lomborg was formally accused of scientific dishonesty by a group of environmental scientists, who brought a total of three complaints against him to the [[Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty]] (DCSD), a body under Denmark's [[Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Denmark|Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation]] (MSTI). Lomborg was asked whether he regarded the book as a "debate" publication, and thereby not under the purview of the DCSD, or as a scientific work; he chose the latter, clearing the way for the inquiry that followed.<ref name="icg2008">{{cite web | url=http://www.cprm.gov.br/33IGC/1343527.html | title=The 'Lomborg case' on sustainable development and scientific dishonesty | publisher=International Geological Congress | date=2008 | accessdate=23 November 2014 | author=Hansen, Jens Morten}}</ref> The charges claimed that ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' contained deliberately misleading data and flawed conclusions. Due to the similarity of the complaints, the DCSD decided to proceed on the three cases under one investigation.

In January 2003, the DCSD released a ruling that sent a mixed message, finding the book to be scientifically dishonest through misrepresentation of scientific facts, but Lomborg himself not guilty due to his lack of expertise in the fields in question.<ref>[http://fivu.dk/en/publications/2004/annual-report-2003-the-danish-committees-on-scientific-dishonesty The Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty: 2003 Annual Report]. Retrieved 13 February 2008.</ref> That February, Lomborg filed a complaint against the decision with the MSTI, which had oversight over the DCSD. In December, 2003, the Ministry annulled the DCSD decision, citing procedural errors, including lack of documentation of errors in the book, and asked the DCSD to re-examine the case. In March 2004, the DCSD formally decided not to act further on the complaints, reasoning that renewed scrutiny would, in all likelihood, result in the same conclusion.<ref name=icg2008 /><ref>{{Cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3340305.stm | title = Lomborg celebrates ministry ruling | authorlink = | work = | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 22 December 2003 | doi = | accessdate = }}</ref>

==== Response of the academic community ====
The original DCSD decision about Lomborg provoked a [[petition]]<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20030117223212/http://www.math.ku.dk/~dlando/indsamling.htm "Underskriftsindsamling i protest mod afgørelsen om Bjørn Lomborg fra - Udvalgene Vedrørende Videnskabelig Uredelighed"].

=== Continued debate and criticism ===
The rulings of the Danish authorities in 2003&ndash;2004 left Lomborg's critics frustrated. Lomborg claimed vindication as a result of MSTI's decision to set aside the original finding of DCSD.

''The Lomborg Deception'', a book by [[Howard Friel]], claims to offer a "careful analysis" of the ways in which Lomborg has "selectively used (and sometimes distorted) the available evidence",<ref name=pk>Philip Kitcher.

A group of scientists published an article in 2005 in the ''[[Journal of Information Ethics]]'',<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Rörsch, A. |title=On the opposition against the book The Skeptical Environmentalist by B. Lomborg |journal=Journal of Information Ethics |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=16–28 |date=Spring 2005 |doi=10.3172/JIE.14.1.16|display-authors=etal}}</ref> in which they concluded that most criticism against Lomborg was unjustified, and that the scientific community misused their authority to suppress Lomborg.

The claim that the accusations against Lomborg were unjustified was challenged in the next issue of ''Journal of Information Ethics''<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Fog, K. |title=The real nature of the opposition against B.

Fog reasserted his contention that, despite the ministry's decision, most of the accusations against Lomborg were valid. He also rejected what he called "the [[Galileo affair|Galileo]] hypothesis", which he describes as the conception that Lomborg is just a brave young man confronting old-fashioned opposition. Fog and other scientists have continued to criticize Lomborg for what one called "a history of misrepresenting" climate science.<ref>{{cite web |year=2015 |author=Fog, K. |title=Lomborg Errors |url=http://www.lomborg-errors.dk/ |accessdate=31 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |year=2015 |author=Rahmstorf, Stefan |title=Bjørn Lomborg, just a scientist with a different opinion? |url= http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=18727 |publisher=RealClimate.org |accessdate=31 August 2015}}</ref>

In April 2015 Lomborg gained further attention as a climate contrarian when he issued a call for all subsidies to be removed from fossil fuels on the basis that "a disproportionate share of the subsidies goes to the middle class and the rich"...making fossil fuel so "inexpensive that consumption increases, thus exacerbating global warming".<ref>http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/its-time-to-stop-subsidizing-fossil-fuels/article24002168/</ref>

In 2014 the government of Australia offered the University of Western Australia $4 million to establish a “consensus centre” with Lomborg as director. The university accepted the offer, setting off a firestorm of opposition from its faculty and students and from climate scientists around the world. In April 2015 the university reversed itself and rejected the offer. The government continued to seek a sponsor for the proposed institution.<ref>{{cite web |date=4 June 2015  |author=Knott, M. |title=Bjorn Lomborg saga: Senate estimates hears 'consensus centre' could still come to Australia |url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/bjorn-lomborg-saga-senate-estimates-hears-consensus-centre-could-still-come-to-australia-20150604-ghgd75.html |publisher=Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=31 August 2015}}</ref> On 21 October 2015 the offered funding was withdrawn.<ref name=aaas-no-funds/> (For further details see the "Copenhagen Consensus" sub-section of the "[[#Copenhagen Consensus|Career]]" section, above.)

== Discussions in the media ==
After the release of ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' in 2001, Lomborg was subjected to intense scrutiny and criticism in the [[News media|media]], where his scientific qualifications and integrity were both attacked and defended. The verdict of the Danish Committees for Scientific Dishonesty fueled this debate and brought it into the spotlight of international [[mass media]]. By the end of 2003 Lomborg had become an international celebrity, with frequent appearances on radio, television and [[Publishing|print media]] around the world.
* ''[[Scientific American]]'' published strong criticism of Lomborg's book. Lomborg responded on his own [[website]], quoting the article at such length that ''Scientific American'' threatened to sue for [[copyright infringement]]. Lomborg eventually removed the rebuttal from his website; it was later published in [[PDF]] format on ''Scientific American'''s site.<ref>[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00000B96-9517-1CDA-B4A8809EC588EEDF "Bjørn Lomborg’s comments to the 11-page critique in January 2002 Scientific American (SA)"]. Scientific American; rebuttal last updated 16 February 2002. Retrieved 26 February 2006.</ref> The magazine also printed a response to the rebuttal.<ref>Rennie, John.

* ''[[The Economist]]'' defended Lomborg, claiming the panel of experts that had criticised Lomborg in ''Scientific American'' was both biased and did not actually counter Lomborg's book. ''The Economist'' argued that the panel's opinion had come under no scrutiny at all, and that Lomborg's responses had not been reported.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=1522706 "Thought control"]. ''The Economist'', 9 January 2003. Retrieved 26 February 2006.</ref>
* ''[[Penn & Teller: Bullshit!]]''&nbsp;&mdash; the U.S. [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] television programme featured an episode entitled "Environmental Hysteria" in which Lomborg criticised what he claimed was environmentalists' refusal to accept a [[cost-benefit analysis]] of environmental questions, and stressed the need to prioritise some issues above others.<ref>[http://www.sho.com/site/ptbs/topics.do?topic=eh ''Bullshit'', "Environmental Hysteria"]. Showtime.</ref> 
*''[[Rolling Stone]]'' stated, "Lomborg pulls off the remarkable feat of welding the techno-optimism of the Internet age with a lefty's concern for the fate of the planet."<ref>[http://www.lomborg.com/files/lombquo.doc "Early Praise for The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World"]. Cambridge University Press. Retrieved 26 February 2006.</ref>
* The [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] strongly criticised ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'', claiming it to be "seriously flawed and failing to meet basic standards of credible scientific analysis", accusing Lomborg of presenting data in a fraudulent way, using flawed logic and selectively citing non-peer-reviewed literature.<ref name="UCS">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/solutions/fight-misinformation/ucs-examines-the-skeptical.html#.VTzjWfdApSA|title=UCS Examines 'The Skeptical Environmentalist' |publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists|accessdate=11 February 2010}}</ref> The review was conducted by [[Peter Gleick]], [[Jerry D. Mahlman]], [[Edward O. Wilson]], [[Thomas Lovejoy]], [[Norman Myers]], [[Jeffrey Harvey (biologist)|Jeff Harvey]], and [[Stuart Pimm]].
