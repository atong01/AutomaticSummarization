To him sin is the consequence of freedom, not a natural condition. The body is not the cause, but the instrument of sin. The remedy for it is repentance, on which he insists. Like many of the Eastern Fathers, he focuses on high moral living as essential to true Christianity. His doctrine of the<space/><link><target>Resurrection of Christ</target><part>Resurrection</part></link><space/>is not quite so realistic as that of other Fathers; but his conception of the Church is decidedly empirical: the existing Church form is the true one, intended by Christ, the completion of the Church of the<space/><link><target>Old Testament</target></link>. His interpretation of the<space/><link><target>Eucharist</target></link><space/>is disputed. If he sometimes seems to approach the symbolic view, at other times he comes very close to a strong realistic doctrine. The bread and wine are not mere elements, but the body and blood of Christ. Chapman finds Cyril less equivocal and finds him upholding the doctrine of Transubstantiation.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Chapman"><link type='external' href='http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04595b.htm'>Chapman, John. &quot;Saint Cyril of Jerusalem.&quot; The Catholic Encyclopedia.

His writings are filled with the loving and forgiving nature of God which was somewhat uncommon during his time period. Cyril fills his writings with great lines of the healing power of forgiveness and the Holy Spirit like The Spirit comes gently and makes himself known by his fragrance. He is not felt as a burden for God is light, very light. Rays of light and knowledge stream before him as the Spirit approaches. The Spirit comes with the tenderness of a true friend to save, to heal, to teach, to counsel, to strengthen and to console. Cyril truly believes in the forgiving aspect of Christianity and knows the power it holds to turn those in pain towards the light of God. Cyril himself followed God's message of forgiveness himself many times throughout his life. Most clearly seen in his two major exiles where Cyril was disgraced and forced to leave his position and his people behind. He never wrote or showed any ill will towards those who wronged him. Cyrils central messages also contain the primary principle of faith. Cyril knew religion wasnt about proving the existence of God or proving the divinity of Christ but rather instilling a faith in people. Cyril knew the power and importance of faith and tried at every opportunity to pass his faith onto others, allowing them to feel the presence of the Holy Spirit. Through his simple message Cyril became recognized as one of the most profound and admired Bishops in church history, which ultimately led to his canonization by the Christian church.</paragraph><heading level='2'><link><target>Catechism</target><part>Catechetical</part></link><space/>lectures</heading><paragraph>Cyril's famous twenty-three lectures given to catechumens in Jerusalem being prepared for, and after,<space/><link><target>baptism</target></link><space/>are best considered in two parts: the first eighteen lectures are common known as the<space/><italics>Catechetical Lectures</italics>,<space/><italics>Catechetical Orations</italics><space/>or<space/><italics>Catechetical Homilies</italics>, while the final five are often called the<space/><italics>Mystagogic Catecheses</italics><space/>(), because they deal with the<space/><italics>mysteries</italics><space/>() i.e.<space/><link><target>Sacraments</target></link><space/>of<space/><link><target>Baptism</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Confirmation</target></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>Eucharist</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'><list type='bullet'><listitem>&quot;The Penguin Dictionary of Saints, 3rd Edition&quot;,<space/><link><target>Donald Attwater</target></link><space/>and Catherine Rachel John, New York: Peguin Putnam Inc., 1995, p. 101</listitem></list></extension></paragraph><paragraph>His<space/><link><target>Catechesis</target><part>catechetical lectures</part></link><space/>(<link><target>Greek language</target><part>Greek</part></link><space/><italics></italics>)<space/><extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf207.ii.iv.html</extension><space/>are generally assumed, on the basis of limited evidence, to have been delivered either in Cyril's early years as a bishop, around 350, or perhaps in 348, while Cyril was still a priest, deputising for his bishop, Maximus.<extension extension_name='ref'>The main evidence for this dating is that at one point Cyril casually refers to the heresy of Mani as being seventy years old (<italics>Cat</italics><space/>6.20). Andrew Louth, 'Palestine', in Frances Young et al.,<space/><italics>The Cambridge History of Early Christian Literature</italics>, (2010), p284</extension><space/>The<space/><italics>Catechetical Lectures</italics><space/>were given in the<space/><italics>Martyrion</italics>, the basilica erected by Constantine.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Andrew Louth 2010 p284"></extension><space/>They contain instructions on the principal topics of Christian faith and practice, in rather a popular than a scientific manner, full of a warm pastoral love and care for the catechumens to whom they were delivered. Each lecture is based upon a text of Scripture, and there is an abundance of Scriptural quotation throughout. In the<space/><italics>Catechetical Lectures</italics>, parallel with the exposition of the<space/><link><target>Creed</target></link><space/>as it was then received in the Church of Jerusalem are vigorous polemics against<space/><link><target>Paganism</target><part>pagan</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Jewish</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Christian heresy</target><part>heretical</part></link><space/>errors. They are of great importance for the light which they throw upon the method of instruction usual of that age, as well as upon the liturgical practises of the period, of which they give the fullest account extant.</paragraph><paragraph>In the 13th lecture, Cyril of Jerusalem discusses the Crucifixion and burial of Jesus Christ. The main themes that Cyril focuses on in these lectures are<space/><link><target>Original sin</target></link><space/>and Jesus sacrificing himself to save us from our sins. Also, the burial and Resurrection which occurred three days later proving the divinity of Jesus Christ and the loving nature of the Father. Cyril was very adamant about the fact that Jesus went to his death with full knowledge and willingness. Not only did he go willingly but throughout the process he maintained his faith and forgave all those who betrayed him and engaged in his execution. Cyril writes who did not sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth, who, when he was reviled, did not revile, when he suffered did not threaten.<extension extension_name='ref' name="cyril"><list type='bullet'><listitem>&quot; Cyril, Drijvers, J. W. (2004). Cyril of Jerusalem: Bishop and city. Supplements to Vigiliae Christianae, v. 72. Leiden: Brill. , p. 7</listitem></list></extension><space/>This line by Cyril shows his belief in the selflessness of Jesus especially in this last final act of Love. The lecture also gives a sort of insight to what Jesus may have been feeling during the execution from the whippings and beatings, to the crown of thorns, to the nailing on the cross. Cyril intertwines the story with the messages Jesus told throughout his life before his execution relating to his final act. For example Cyril writes I gave my back to those who beat me and my cheeks to blows; and my face I did not shield from the shame of spitting.<extension extension_name='ref' name="cyril"><list type='bullet'><listitem>&quot; Cyril, Drijvers, J.

The segment of the Catechesis really reflects the voice Cyril maintained in all of his writing. The writings always have the central message of the Bible; Cyril is not trying to add his own beliefs in reference to religious interpretation and remains grounded in true biblical teachings.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Eschatology</heading><paragraph>Cyril identified the four beast-kingdoms of Daniel 7: For as the first kingdom which became renowned was that of the Assyrians, and the second, that of the Medes and Persians together, and after these, that of the Macedonians was the third, so the fourth kingdom now is that of the Romans.&quot; The fourth beast he said would be &quot;a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall surpass all kingdoms.
