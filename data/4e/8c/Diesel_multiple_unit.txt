A '''diesel multiple unit''' or '''DMU''' is a [[multiple-unit]] train powered by on-board [[diesel engine]]s. A DMU requires no separate [[locomotive]], as the engines are incorporated into one or more of the carriages. They may also be referred to as a [[railcar]] or [[railmotor]], depending on country. Diesel-powered units may be further classified by their transmission type: diesel-electric (DEMU), diesel-mechanical (DMMU) or diesel-hydraulic (DHMU).

==Design==
The diesel engine may be located above the frame in an engine bay or under the floor. Driving controls can be at both ends, on one end, or none.

==Types==
DMUs are usually classified by the method of transmitting motive power to their wheels.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

===Diesel-mechanical {{Anchor|DMMU}}===
In a diesel-mechanical multiple unit (DMMU) the rotating energy of the engine is transmitted via a [[Transmission (mechanics)|gearbox]] and driveshaft directly to the wheels of the train, like a [[automobile|car]]. The transmissions can be shifted manually by the driver, as in the great majority of first-generation [[British Rail]] DMUs, but in most applications gears are changed automatically.

===Diesel-hydraulic===
In a diesel-hydraulic multiple unit, a hydraulic [[torque converter]], a type of fluid coupling, acts as the transmission medium for the motive power of the diesel engine to turn the wheels. Some units feature a hybrid mix of hydraulic and mechanical transmissions, usually reverting to the latter at higher operating speeds as this decreases engine RPM and noise.

===Diesel-electric {{Anchor|DEMU}}===
In a diesel-electric multiple unit (DEMU) a [[diesel engine]] drives an [[electrical generator]] or an [[Alternator#Diesel electric locomotive alternators|alternator]] which produces [[electrical energy]]. The generated current is then fed to electric [[traction motor]]s on the [[wheel]]s or [[bogie]]s in the same way as a conventional [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel electric]] [[Diesel-electric locomotive|locomotive]].<ref name=gaz-voyager />

In modern DEMUs, such as the [[Bombardier Voyager family]], each car is entirely self-contained and has its own engine, generator and electric motors.<ref name=gaz-voyager>{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view//cutting-noise-and-smoothing-the-ride.html|title=Cutting noise and smoothing the ride|publisher=Railway Gazette|date=1 August 2000|quote=In the Voyager application, every car has a Cummins underfloor engine and alternator supplying power to a pair of body-mounted traction motors. Each drives one inner axle through a cardan shaft and axle-mounted final drive gearbox. |accessdate=20 January 2011}}</ref> In older designs, such as the [[British Rail Class 207#Technical details|British Rail Class 207]], some cars within the [[consist]] may be entirely unpowered or only feature electric motors, obtaining electric current from other cars in the consist which have a generator and engine.

==Benefits==
A train composed of DMU cars scales well, as it allows extra passenger capacity to be added at the same time as motive power. It also permits passenger capacity to be matched to demand, and for trains to be split and joined en route. It is not necessary to match the power available to the size and weight of the train – each unit is capable of moving itself, so as units are added, the power available to move the train increases by the necessary amount. DMUs may have better acceleration capabilities, with more power-driven axles, making them more suitable for routes with frequent closely spaced stops, as compared with conventional locomotive and unpowered carriage setups.

Distribution of the propulsion among the cars also results in a system that is less vulnerable to single-point-of-failure outages. Many classes of DMU are capable of operating with faulty units still in the consist. Because of the self-contained nature of diesel engines, there is no need to run [[Railway electrification|overhead electric lines]] or [[Third rail|electrified track]], which can result in lower system construction costs.

These advantages must be weighed against the underfloor noise and vibration that may be an issue with this type of train.

In the [[Republic of Ireland]] the [[Córas Iompair Éireann]] (CIE), which controlled the republic's railways between 1945 and 1986, introduced DMUs in the mid-1950s and they were the first diesel trains on many main lines.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

====United Kingdom====
[[File:222009 at St Pancras.jpg|thumb|right|[[East Midlands Trains]] [[British Rail Class 222|222009]] at [[St Pancras railway station|London St Pancras]]]]

{{further2|[[British railcars and diesel multiple units]]|[[List of British Rail diesel multiple unit classes]]}}

The first significant use of DMUs in the [[United Kingdom]] was by the [[Great Western Railway]], which introduced its small but successful series of diesel-mechanical [[GWR railcars]] in 1934. The [[LNER]]<ref>[http://www.lner.info/locos/IC/aw_railcar.php The Armstrong-Whitworth Diesel-Electric Railcars]</ref> and [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] also experimented with DMUs in the 1930s, the LMS both on [[LMS railcars|its own system]], and on that of its [[Northern Counties Committee#Railcars|Northern Irish subsidiary]], but development was curtailed by [[World War II]].

After nationalisation, [[British Railways]] revived the concept in the early 1950s. At that time there was an urgent need to move away from expensive steam traction which led to many experimental designs using diesel propulsion and [[multiple unit]]s. The early DMUs proved successful, and under BR's 1955 Modernisation Plan the building of a large fleet was authorised. These BR "First Generation" DMUs were built between 1956 and 1963, and some are still in service as of 2008.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

BR's owners, the British Government, required that contracts for the design and manufacture of new locomotives and rolling stock be split between numerous private firms as well as BR's own workshops, while different BR Regions laid down different specifications. The result was a multitude of different types, one of which was:
* 'Intercity' units, which were more substantially constructed, and shared many features with contemporary hauled coaching stock. They were built for express services on important secondary routes on the Scottish, North Eastern and Western Regions.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In 1960, British Railways introduced its [[British Rail Classes 251 and 261|Blue Pullman]] high-speed DEMUs.<ref name="Heaps, BR Diary: 1968–1977" >{{cite book |title=BR Diary: 1968–1977 |chapter=End of the Blue Pullmans |last=Heaps |first=Chris |isbn=0-7110-1611-9 |year=1988 |publisher=[[Ian Allan Publishing|Ian Allan]] |location=London |pages=66–67 }}</ref>
These were few in number and relatively short-lived,<ref name="Heaps, BR Diary: 1968–1977" /> but they paved the way for the very successful British Rail "[[InterCity 125]]" or High Speed Train (HST) units, which were built between 1975 and 1982 to take over most principal express services on non-electrified routes.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/4/newsid_2486000/2486817.stm |title=1976: New train speeds into service |work =BBC News Online |accessdate=15 February 2011 | date=4 October 1976 | location=London}}</ref><ref name=NewOps>{{cite web| url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/DoT_WP001.pdf |title=New opportunities for the railways: the privatisation of British Rail |publisher=Railway Archive | page=8 |accessdate=15 February 2011 }}</ref>

[[File:170518 at Peterborough.JPG|thumb|left|The popular [[British Rail Class 170|Class 170]] was the best selling DMU of the last 10 years in the UK.]]
By the early 1980s, many of the surviving First Generation units were reaching the end of their design life, leading to spiralling maintenance costs, poor reliability and a poor public image for the railway. A stopgap solution was to convert some services back to locomotive haulage, as spare locomotives and hauled coaching stock were available, but this also increased operating costs. Commencing in the mid '80s, British Rail embarked upon its so called "Sprinterisation" programme, to replace most of the first generation DMUs and many locomotive-hauled trains with three new families of DMU:
* [[Pacer (train)|Class 140-144 Pacer]] [[railbus]]es, ultra-low-cost diesel-mechanical units utilising 4-wheeled chassis and lightweight bus bodywork, designed for provincial branch line and stopping services. The earliest examples have now been withdrawn from service;{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
* [[Sprinter (train)|Sprinter]] a family of diesel-hydraulic DMUs. These fall into three sub-groups; [[British Rail Class 150|Class 150 Sprinters]] (for branch line/commuter service), [[British Rail Class 153|Class 153]] / [[British Rail Class 155|155]] / [[British Rail Class 156|156 Super Sprinters]] (for longer cross country services), and [[British Rail Class 158|Class 158]] / [[British Rail Class 159|159]] Express units (for secondary express services);
* Networker diesel-hydraulic units, of [[British Rail Class 165|Class 165 Network Turbo]] (standard commuter version) and [[British Rail Class 166|Class 166 Network Express]] (for longer distance commuter services). These took over the remaining non-electric commuter services into London.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Following the [[privatisation of British Rail]] in the late 1990s, several other diesel-hydraulic DMU families have been introduced:{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}
* [[British Rail Class 168|Class 168 Clubman]] and [[British Rail Class 170|Class 170]]/[[British Rail Class 171|171 Turbostar]] units, a development of the earlier Networkers. These are built by [[Bombardier Transportation]] and are the most numerous and widespread of the post-privatisation designs. The same basic design has been adapted for a variety of different types of use, ranging from commuter to secondary express services;
* [[British Rail Class 175|Class 175 Coradia]] were designed by [[Alstom]] as a rival to the 170 Turbostar, but bought only by [[First North Western]];
* [[British Rail class 180|Class 180 Adelante]] were an Alstom design for express services built only for [[Great Western Railway (train operating company)|First Great Western]];
* [[British Rail Class 185|Class 185 Desiro]], a [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] design introduced to the UK in 2006 for [[First TransPennine Express]] services.

===North America===

[[Canada]] generally follows similar buffer strength requirements to the USA,<ref name="rsaa">Such as the [[Railroad Safety Appliance Act]] of 1893.</ref> but new services are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. As a result, several types of lightweight DMUs have been used:

* The [[O-Train]] [[Trillium Line]] in [[Ottawa, Ontario]] uses European-standard [[Alstom Coradia LINT]] (previously [[Bombardier Talent]]) DMUs on conventional railway tracks under a specific safety agreement with [[Transport Canada]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
* [[Via Rail]] operates [[Budd Rail Diesel Car]]s on its [[Sudbury – White River train]].
* Réseau Charlevoix ([[Le Massif]]) operates a shuttle in [[Charlevoix]] region, Québec.
* [[Canadian National]] operates the small custom-built [[Koaham Shuttle]] between [[Lillooet, British Columbia|Lillooet]], and [[D'Arcy, British Columbia|D'Arcy]] via [[Seton Portage, British Columbia|Seton Portage]], 213 northeast of [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
* [[Union Pearson Express]] uses [[Nippon Sharyo DMU]] trains for express service between [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]] and [[Toronto Pearson International Airport|Pearson Airport]].

====Costa Rica====
[[File:Tren urbano de Costa Rica.jpg|thumb|Apollo 2400 DMU in service in Costa Rica]]
[[Costa Rica]] has purchased several Apolo 2400 series DMU railcars from the former narrow gauge operator in Spain, which are run in commuter service.

====United States====
In the [[United States]] only FRA-compliant DMU systems are permitted on freight rail corridors. This is due to the [[Federal Railway Administration]] setting higher [[Coupler (railway)|coupling strength]] requirements than European regulators, effectively prohibiting the use of lighter weight European-style [[inter-city rail]] DMUs on U.S. main line railways without [[timesharing]] with freight operations or special waivers from the FRA. This has greatly restricted the development of DMUs within the U.S. as no other country requires the much heavier FRA compliant vehicles, and no export market for them exists.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Operations using FRA-compliant vehicles:
*The [[South Florida Regional Transportation Authority]] has used a [[Colorado Railcar]] [[Bilevel rail car|bi-Level]] DMU and Coach consist since October 2006 as a technology demonstrator on the 87-mile long [[Tri-Rail]] commuter rail line between [[Miami]] and [[West Palm Beach]], [[Florida]]. In early 2007, three more bi-level DMUs and an additional bi-level non-powered coach were acquired.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
* Since February 2009, [[TriMet]] is using FRA-compliant [[Colorado Railcar]] DMUs for its rush-hour [[WES Commuter Rail]] service, a suburb-to-suburb line between [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]] and [[Wilsonville, Oregon]]. The opening of the line was delayed from fall 2008 to early 2009 due to delays in getting the vehicles. TriMet also has two refurbished former [[Alaska Railroad|Alaska RR]] RDCs as backup trainsets for when one or more Colorado Railcar DMUs is out of service.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}
* Also in [[Oregon]], former [[BC Rail]] RDCs were used on the Lewis and Clark Explorer excursion train from [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] to [[Astoria, Oregon|Astoria]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
* [[Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit]], also referred to as SMART, will operate [[Nippon Sharyo DMU]]s (the same as those in Toronto) on its route between San Rafael and Santa Rosa, CA.

Operations using non FRA-compliant vehicles:
* [[Capital Metro]] uses [[Stadler GTW]] cars to operate [[Capital MetroRail]], a commuter rail line serving the [[Greater Austin]], [[Texas]] area.
* In [[Denton County]], [[Texas]], [[DCTA]] also uses [[Stadler GTW]] cars to operate its [[A-train (Denton County Transportation Authority)|A-train]] service. DCTA has secured from the FRA the first-ever alternative vehicle technology waiver to use these cars on active freight corridors.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Bj|title=DCTA gets go-ahead to use Stadler cars|url=http://www.dentonrc.com/local-news/local-news-headlines/20120605-dcta-gets-go-ahead-to-use-stadler-cars.ece|accessdate=6 June 2012|newspaper=Denton Record-Chronicle|date=5 June 2012}}</ref>
* [[New Jersey Transit]] operates the [[River LINE]] from [[Camden, NJ]] to [[Trenton, NJ]], every 15 minutes during peak hours and every 30 minutes at other times. It uses modified [[Stadler GTW]] trains of one or two cars. The line is classified as [[light rail]] because it utilizes imported European made DMUs that do not meet [[Federal Railway Administration|FRA]] crash guidelines. The cars may not operate with the [[freight rail]] service that shares the line, so evening operating hours are restricted to Saturday nights. This line currently carries over 7,500 passengers on a typical weekday, exceeding expectations.
* [[North County Transit District|NCTD]] operates the [[Sprinter (passenger rail)|Sprinter]] line using [[Siemens Desiro|Desiro Classic]] DMUs built by [[Siemens AG]]. Opened March, 2008, The line operates every half-hour daily, except limitations in the morning and at night on Saturday, Sunday and on holidays. The line runs from [[Oceanside, CA]], where transfer is possible with [[Coaster (San Diego)|Coaster]] [[commuter rail]] service to [[San Diego]], to [[Escondido, CA]]. Like the NJT River Line, it is classified as light rail due to the use of European made DMUs, but does not run at a more typical light rail frequency.

Proposed operations:
* [[BART]] The eBART expansion plan calls for diesel multiple unit train service to be implemented from the existing Pittsburg/Bay Point station. The first phase of the expansion will proceed east along the Highway 4 corridor to the town of Antioch. The plan includes an option for a station at Railroad Avenue in Pittsburg. Future expansions in this direction could connect the eBART service to Oakley, Brentwood, Byron, and beyond to Tracy and Stockton. The DMU system was chosen as a less-expensive alternative to the existing third-rail BART design. Funding for this expansion was approved in April 2009.<ref name="bart">[http://www.bart.gov/news/articles/2009/news20090427.aspx BART moves forward with $1 billion in extension projects | bart.gov<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
* [[Boston]]'s [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] is planning to acquire 30 DMUs for use on the [[Fairmount Line]], currently run by locomotive-pulled carriages, in order to improve service and headways on the line. The units are expected to enter service in 2018.<ref>http://www.wbur.org/2014/10/16/fairmount-line-weekend-service-subway-fares</ref>  A new proposal for a rail line connecting Back Bay and the Waterfront district may end up using this type of train.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/09/05/state-begin-innovative-rail-service-between-seaport-district-and-back-bay/oHUinYj30lzOV6KNCQUMEJ/story.html|publisher=Boston Globe|accessdate=6 October 2013}}</ref> Though the MBTA issued a "request for proposals" in 2014, the MBTA failed to include funds for the DMU pilot program implementation in the 2016 Capital Investment Program. Bonding authority still exists for DMU procurement, and the RFP has been extended pending future decisions to execute a service plan for the Fairmount Line.
* The [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] approved an allocation of $250,000 for a feasibility study of DMUs for "future transportation options for the region" on 5 July 2006 (Ara Najarian, Metro Board Member).{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}
* [[Chicago]]'s commuter rail line, [[Metra]], is studying the use of DMUs on its newly proposed lines ([[Suburban Transit Access Route (Metra)|STAR line]], [[SouthEast Service (Metra)|SES)]]. They claim these DMUs will have better acceleration, be more fuel efficient, and seat more customers than the current diesel locomotive and double decker rail cars that are currently in use.<ref name="metra">[http://metraconnects.metrarail.com Metra Connects : Proposed New Starts<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
* Seattle Area - The Central Puget Sound's regional transit agency [[Sound Transit]], along with the [[Puget Sound Regional Council]] evaluated the feasibility of both DMU and diesel locomotive technology for operation in the Eastside BNSF Corridor in response to a state legislative request. The Eastside BNSF corridor runs from the City of Snohomish in the north to Renton in the south of the metro area. Sound Transit has no plans to operate passenger rail service in the eastside BNSF corridor, but has committed limited funds to provide capital improvements in the event another public or private operator proposes to operate the service.<ref name="psrc">[http://www.psrc.org/about/pubs/bnsf/fullreport/bnsf]</ref>
* Anchorage Mat-Su Area- As part of a joint U.S. Forest Service (USFS) and ARRC Chugach Forest Whistle Stop project, a self-propelled rail car was purchased and delivered spring 2009. The diesel multiple unit (DMU) maybe available for flexible demonstration service during winter months.<ref name="akrail">http://www.alaskarailroad.com/Portals/6/pdf/projects/2010%20Commuter%20Partnership%20&%20Opportunities.pdf</ref>
* The [[Long Island Rail Road]], the busiest commuter railroad in the United States, is exploring the possibility of operating DMUs on some of its lesser traveled routes in non-electrified territory (on the [[Montauk Branch|Montauk]], [[Greenport Branch|Greenport]], [[Port Jefferson Branch|Port Jefferson]], and [[Oyster Bay Branch|Oyster Bay]] branches), where operation of its current fleet of [[C3 (railcar)|C3]] bilevel railcars pulled by [[DE30AC]]/[[DM30AC]] locomotives is uneconomical and inefficient.
