Most commonly, the line is divided into two equal parts by a<space/><link><target>caesura</target></link><space/>between the sixth and seventh syllables. Alternatively, the line is divided into three four-syllable sections by two caesuras.</paragraph><paragraph>The dramatic works of<space/><link><target>Pierre Corneille</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Jean Racine</target></link><space/>are typically composed of rhyming alexandrine couplets. The caesura after the sixth syllable is here marked ||. Note that in these examples, as in the vast majority of pre-20th-century French poetry, the pronunciation of the &quot;e muet&quot; follows rigid, indeed formal, rules: normally it is pronounced if followed by a consonant sound. Thus &quot;partm-euh cinq cents&quot;, &quot;esclav-euh des Mores&quot; and, still in the 20th-century verse of the Eluard extract, &quot;perl-euh z-en placard&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph><extension extension_name='blockquote'><paragraph><extension extension_name='poem'><paragraph>Nous partmes cinq cents ; || mais par un prompt renfortNous nous vmes trois mille || en arrivant au port</paragraph><list type='ident'><listitem>Corneille,<space/><italics>Le Cid</italics><space/>Act IV, scene 3</listitem></list></extension></paragraph></extension></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Charles Baudelaire</target><part>Baudelaire's</part></link><space/><italics>Les Bijoux</italics><space/>(The Jewels) is a typical example of the use of the alexandrine in 19th-century French poetry:</paragraph><paragraph><extension extension_name='blockquote'><extension extension_name='poem'>La trs-chre tait nue, || et, connaissant mon cur,Elle n'avait gard || que ses bijoux sonores,Dont le riche attirail || lui donnait l'air vainqueurQu'ont dans leurs jours heureux || les esclaves des Mores.</extension></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Even a 20th-century Surrealist, such as<space/><link><target>Paul luard</target></link>, used alexandrines on occasion, such as in these lines from<space/><italics>L'galit des sexes</italics><space/>(in<space/><italics>Capitale de la douleur</italics>) (note the variation between caesuras after the sixth syllable, and after fourth and eighth):</paragraph><paragraph><extension extension_name='blockquote'><extension extension_name='poem'>Ni connu la beaut || des yeux, beaut des pierres,Celle des gouttes d'eau, || des perles en placard,Des pierres nues || et sans squelette, || ma statue</extension></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Modern references</heading><paragraph>In the comic book<space/><link><target>Asterix and Cleopatra</target></link>, the author Goscinny inserted a pun about alexandrines: when the Druid Panoramix (&quot;Getafix&quot; in the English translation) meets his Alexandrian (Egyptian) friend the latter exclaims<space/><italics>Je suis, mon cher ami, || trs heureux de te voir</italics><space/>at which Panoramix observes<space/><italics>C'est un Alexandrin</italics><space/>(&quot;That's an alexandrine!&quot;/&quot;He's an Alexandrian!&quot;). The pun can also be heard in the theatrical adaptations.

It is also usual for there to be a caesura between the sixth and seventh syllables (as the examples from<space/><link><target>Alexander Pope</target><part>Pope</part></link><space/>below illustrate).<space/><link><target>Robert Bridges</target></link><space/>noted that in the lyrical sections of<space/><italics><link><target>Samson Agonistes</target></link></italics>,<space/><link><target>John Milton</target><part>Milton</part></link><space/>significantly varied the placement of the caesura.</paragraph><paragraph>In<space/><link><target>Edmund Spenser</target></link>'s<space/><italics><link><target>The Faerie Queene</target><part>Faerie Queene</part></link></italics><space/>eight lines of pentameter are followed by an alexandrine, the eponymous<space/><link><target>Spenserian stanza</target></link>.

In the<space/><link><target>English Restoration</target><part>Restoration</part></link><space/>and eighteenth century, poetry written in couplets is sometimes varied by the introduction of a triplet in which the third line is an alexandrine, as in<space/><link><target>To the Memory of Mr. Oldham</target><part>this sample</part></link><space/>from<space/><link><target>John Dryden</target><part>Dryden</part></link>, which introduces a 5-5-6 triplet after two pentameter couplets:</paragraph><paragraph><extension extension_name='blockquote'><extension extension_name='poem'>But satire needs not those, and wit will shineThrough the harsh cadence of a rugged lineA noble error, and but seldom made,When poets are by too much force betrayed.Thy generous fruits, though gathered ere their prime,Still showed a quickness; and maturing timeBut mellows what we write to the dull sweets of rhyme.</extension></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Alexandrines also formed the first line of the couplet form Poulter's Measure (the second line being a<space/><link><target>Fourteener (poetry)</target><part>fourteener</part></link>) as exemplified in<space/><link><target>Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey</target></link>'s poem,<space/><italics>Complaint of the Absence of her lover, being upon the sea</italics><space/>(1547).</paragraph><heading level='2'>Origin</heading><paragraph>There is some doubt as to the origin of the name; but most probably it is derived from a<space/><link><target>Alexander Romance</target><part>collection of Alexandrine romances</part></link>, collected in the 12th century, of which<space/><link><target>Alexander the Great</target></link><space/>was the hero, and in which he was represented, somewhat like the British<space/><link><target>King Arthur</target><part>Arthur</part></link>, as the pride and crown of chivalry. Before the publication of this work most of the<space/><link><target>trouvre</target></link><space/>romances appeared in octosyllabic verse. There is also a theory that the form was invented by the 12th-century poet<space/><link><target>Alexander of Paris</target></link>. The new work, which was henceforth to set the fashion to French literature, was written in lines of twelve syllables, but with a freedom of pause which was afterwards greatly curtailed. The new fashion, however, was not adopted all at once.
