Article 2, Section 2 of the Berne Convention states: &quot;It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to prescribe that works in general or any specified categories of works shall not be protected unless they have been fixed in some material form.&quot; Some countries do not require that a work be produced in a particular form to obtain copyright protection. For instance, Spain, France, and Australia do not require fixation for copyright protection. The United States and Canada, on the other hand, require that the work be &quot;fixed in a tangible medium of expression&quot; to obtain copyright protection. U.S. law requires that the fixation be stable and permanent enough to be &quot;perceived, reproduced or communicated for a period of more than transitory duration.&quot; Similarly, Canadian courts consider fixation to require that the work be &quot;expressed to some extent at least in some material form, capable of identification and having a more or less permanent endurance.&quot;<space/><link type='external' href='http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/copyrightforlibrarians/Module_3:_The_Scope_of_Copyright_Law#Fixation'>Harvard Law School</link>,<space/><italics>The Scope of Copyright Law</italics>.</extension><space/>It is often shared among multiple authors, each of whom holds a set of rights to use or license the work, and who are commonly referred to as<space/><link><target>:wiktionary:rightsholder</target><part>rightsholders</part></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Citation</target><arg name="title">Copyright</arg><arg name="publisher">University of California</arg><arg name="year">2014</arg><arg name="url">http://copyright.universityofcalifornia.edu/ownership/joint-works.html</arg><arg name="accessdate">2014-12-15</arg></template></extension><space/>These rights frequently include reproduction, control over<space/><link><target>derivative work</target><trail>s</trail></link>, distribution,<space/><link><target>Performing rights</target><part>public performance</part></link>, and &quot;<link><target>moral rights</target></link>&quot; such as attribution.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Citation</target><arg name="title">17 U.S.C. ยง 106</arg><arg name="publisher">United States of America</arg><arg name="year">2011</arg><arg name="url">http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106</arg><arg name="accessdate">2014-12-15</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Copyrights are considered<space/><italics>territorial</italics><space/>rights, which means that they do not extend beyond the territory of a specific jurisdiction.

Different cultural attitudes, social organizations, economic models and legal frameworks are seen to account for why copyright emerged in<space/><link><target>Europe</target></link><space/>and not, for example, in Asia. In the<space/><link><target>Middle Ages</target></link><space/>in Europe, there was generally a lack of any concept of literary property due to the general relations of production, the specific organization of literary production and the role of culture in society. The latter refers to the tendency of oral societies, such as that of Europe in the medieval period, to view knowledge as the product and expression of the collective, rather than to see it as individual property. However, with copyright laws, intellectual production comes to be seen as a product of an individual, with attendant rights. The most significant point is that patent and copyright laws support the expansion of the range of creative human activities that can be commodified. This parallels the ways in which<space/><link><target>capitalism</target></link><space/>led to the commodification of many aspects of social life that earlier had no monetary or economic value per&amp;nbsp;se.<extension extension_name='ref'>Bettig, Ronald V.

In most of the world, the default length of copyright is the life of the author plus either 50 or 70 years.

In Italy and France, there were post-wartime extensions that could increase the term by approximately 6 years in Italy and up to about 14 in France.
