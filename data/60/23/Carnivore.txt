A '''carnivore''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɑr|n|ɪ|v|ɔər}} meaning 'meat eater' ([[Latin]], ''caro'' meaning 'meat' or 'flesh' and ''vorare'' meaning 'to devour') is an [[organism]] that derives its energy and nutrient requirements from a [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] consisting mainly or exclusively of [[animal]] [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]], whether through [[predation]] or [[scavenger|scavenging]].<ref>Nutrient Requirements: Carnivores. Duane E. Ullrey. Encyclopedia of Animal Science.</ref><ref name="MC">Mammals: Carnivores. Duane E. Ullrey. Encyclopedia of Animal Science.</ref> Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called [[wikt:obligate|obligate]] carnivores while those that also consume non-animal food are called [[wikt:facultative|facultative]] carnivores.<ref name="MC"/> [[Omnivore]]s also consume both animal and non-animal food, and apart from the more general definition, there is no clearly defined ratio of plant to animal material that would distinguish a facultative carnivore from an omnivore.<ref>Mammals"' Omnivores. Duane E. Ullrey. Encyclopedia of Animal Science.</ref> A carnivore that sits at the top of the [[foodchain]] is termed an [[apex predator]].

Plants that capture and digest insects (and, at times, other small animals) are called [[carnivorous plants]]. Similarly, [[fungi]] that capture microscopic animals are often called [[carnivorous fungi]].

==Classification==
 
The word "carnivore" sometimes refers to the [[mammal]]ian order [[Carnivora]], but this is somewhat misleading. While many Carnivora meet the definition of being meat eaters, not all do, and even fewer are true obligate carnivores (see below). For example, most species of [[bear]]s are actually [[omnivore|omnivorous]], except for the [[giant panda]], which is almost exclusively [[herbivore|herbivorous]], and the exclusively meat-eating [[polar bear]], which lives in the Arctic, where few plants grow. In addition, there are plenty of carnivorous species that are not members of Carnivora.

Outside the animal kingdom, there are several genera containing [[carnivorous plant]]s and several phyla containing [[carnivorous fungus|carnivorous fungi]]. The former are predominantly insectivores, while the latter prey mostly on microscopic [[invertebrate]]s, such as [[nematode]]s, [[amoebae]] and [[springtail]]s.

Carnivores that eat [[insect]]s and similar invertebrates primarily or exclusively are called [[insectivore]]s, while those that eat [[fish]] primarily or exclusively are called [[piscivore]]s. Large [[piscivore]] amphibians that evolved 400 million years ago were the first vertebrates to conquer land. Insectivores evolved next and predators of other vertebrates after that.<ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse">{{cite journal | url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/38/12/1079 | author= Sahney, S., Benton, M.J. & Falcon-Lang, H.J. | year=2010 | title= Rainforest collapse triggered Pennsylvanian tetrapod diversification in Euramerica | journal=Geology | volume = 38 | pages = 1079–1082 | format=PDF | doi=10.1130/G31182.1 | issue=12 }}</ref>

Carnivores may alternatively be classified according to the percentage of meat in their diet. The diet of a [[hypercarnivore]] consists of more than 70% meat, that of a [[mesocarnivore]] 50-70%, and that of a [[hypocarnivore]] less than 30%, with the balance consisting of non-animal foods, which may include [[fruit]]s, other plant material, or [[fungi]].

===Obligate carnivores===
[[File:Tigre d'Asie à robe blanche.jpg|thumb|right|This [[Bengal tiger]]'s sharp [[teeth]] and strong jaws are the classical physical traits expected from carnivorous mammalian [[predator]]s]]
Obligate carnivores or "true" carnivores depend on the nutrients found only in animal flesh for their survival. While they may consume small amounts of plant material, they lack the [[physiology]] required for the efficient [[digestion]] of vegetable matter and, in fact, some carnivorous mammals eat vegetation specifically as an [[emetic]].
For instance, [[Felidae|felids]] including the [[domestic cat]] are obligate carnivores requiring a diet of primarily animal flesh and organs.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Velegrand-Defretin|first=Veronique|title=Differences between cats and dogs: a nutritional view|journal=Proceedings of the Nutrition Society|year=1994|volume=53|pages=15–24|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FPNS%2FPNS53_01%2FS0029665194000066a.pdf&code=b428e668252a801500828a47df480146|doi=10.1079/pns19940004}}</ref> Specifically, cats have high protein requirements and their metabolisms appear unable to synthesize certain essential nutrients (including [[retinol]], [[arginine]], [[taurine]], and [[arachidonic acid]]), and thus they rely on animal flesh in their diet to supply these nutrients. <ref>{{cite book|author1=Ullrey, D.

== Characteristics of carnivores ==
Characteristics commonly associated with carnivores include organs for capturing and disarticulating prey (teeth and claws serve these functions in many vertebrates) and status as a [[predator]]. In truth, these assumptions may be misleading, as some carnivores do not hunt and are [[scavengers]] (though most hunting carnivores will scavenge when the opportunity exists). Thus they do not have the characteristics associated with hunting carnivores. Carnivores have comparatively short digestive systems, as they are not required to break down tough cellulose found in plants. Many animals that hunt other animals have evolved eyes that face forward, thus making depth perception possible. This is almost universal among mammalian predators. Other predators, like crocodiles, have sideways facing eyes and hunt by ambush rather than pursuit.

==Prehistoric carnivores==
The first vertebrate carnivores were fish, and then amphibians that moved on to land. Early [[tetrapods]] were large amphibious [[piscivores]]. Some scientists assert that ''[[Dimetrodon]]'' "was the first terrestrial vertebrate to develop the curved, serrated teeth that enable a predator to eat prey much larger than itself."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/5928/20140207/carnivorous-pre-dinosaur-predator-first-evolve-steak-knife-teeth.htm |author= Foley, James A. |date= February 7, 2014 |title= Carnivorous, Pre-Dinosaur Predator was First to Evolve Steak Knife-like Teeth |publisher= Nature World News |accessdate= May 3, 2014}}</ref> While amphibians continued to feed
on fish and later insects, reptiles began exploring two new food types, tetrapods (carnivory), and
later, plants (herbivory). Carnivory was a natural transition from insectivory for medium and large tetrapods, requiring minimal adaptation (in contrast, a complex set of adaptations was necessary for feeding on highly fibrous plant materials).<ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse" />

Prehistoric mammals of the crown-clade [[Carnivoramorpha]] (Carnivora and [[Miacoidea]] without [[Creodonta]]), along with the early order Creodonta, and some mammals of the even earlier order [[Cimolesta]], were true carnivores. The earliest carnivorous mammal is considered{{By whom|date=April 2011}} to be the ''[[Cimolestes]]'' that existed during the Late Cretaceous and [[Paleogene]] [[Period (geology)|Period]]s in North America about 66 million years ago. Most species of ''Cimolestes'' were mouse to rat-sized, but the Late [[Cretaceous]] ''[[Cimolestes magnus]]'' reached the size of a [[marmot]], making it one of the largest [[Mesozoic]] mammals known (20-60g). The cheek teeth combined the functions of piercing, shearing and grinding, and the molars of ''[[Palaeoryctes]]'' had extremely high and acute [[cusp (dentistry)|cusp]]s that had little function other than piercing. The [[dentition]] of ''Cimolestes'' foreshadows the same cutting structures seen in all later carnivores. While the earlier smaller species were [[insectivores]], the later marmot-sized ''[[Cimolestes magnus]]'' probably took larger prey and were definitely a carnivore to some degree. The cheek teeth of ''[[Hyracolestes ermineus]]'' (an [[ermine]]-like [[shrew]] - 40g) and ''[[Sarcodon pygmaeus]]'' ("pygmy flesh tooth" - 75g), were common in the latest [[Paleocene]] of Mongolia and China and occupied the small predator niche. The cheek teeth show the same characteristic notches that serve in today's carnivores to hold flesh in place to shear apart with cutting ridges.

Some [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]]s such as ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' that existed during the [[Mesozoic|Mesozoic Era]] were probably obligate carnivores.
