'''Debian GNU/Hurd''' is the [[Debian|Debian project]]'s distribution of the [[GNU]] [[operating system]], using the [[GNU Hurd]] [[microkernel]].
Debian GNU/Hurd has been in development since 1998,<ref>{{cite mailing list
 |title=debian-hurd@lists.debian.org is up!
 |url=http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/1998/07/msg00000.html
 |accessdate=10 September 2009 }}
</ref> and has made an official release in May 2013, with 78% of the software packaged for Debian GNU/Linux ported to the GNU Hurd.<ref>{{cite web
 |title=The GNU/Hurd architecture, nifty features, and latest news
 |url=http://people.debian.org/~sthibault/hurd-i386/2013-02-02-fosdem.pdf
 |accessdate=11 February 2013 }}
</ref> However, the Hurd itself remains under development, and as such is not ready for use in production systems. The overwhelming majority of Debian users run Debian with [[Linux]] (Debian GNU/Linux), rather than Debian GNU/Hurd. The Debian GNU/Hurd developers were hoping to be able to release it for the next major release of [[Debian]], "wheezy",<ref>[https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/news/2011-q2.html 2011-q2], GNU Hurd news, read 15 August 2011.</ref><ref>[http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/ Debian GNU/Hurd] project page, read 15 August 2011.</ref> which took place in May 2013.<ref>[http://www.debian.org/News/2013/20130504 2013-q2] Debian news, read 6 May 2013.</ref> However, Hurd is not part of the official "wheezy" release, but GNU/Hurd is further maintained and improved as an unofficial port.

Debian GNU/Hurd is distributed as an installer CD (running the official Debian installer) or ready-to-run [[virtual disk image]] ([[Live CD]], [[Live USB]]). The CD uses the [[IA-32]] architecture, making it compatible with [[IA-32]] and [[x86-64]] PCs.

The current version of Debian GNU/Hurd is 2015, published in April 2015.
