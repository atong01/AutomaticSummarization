'''Afro Celt Sound System''' is a [[band (music)|musical group]] which fuses modern [[electronic dance music|electronic dance rhythms]] ([[trip hop]], [[techno music|techno]], etc.) with traditional [[Irish traditional music|Irish]] and [[Music of Africa|West African]] music. It was originally formed in 1995 by [[Grammy]]-nominated producer-guitarist [[Simon Emmerson]], and features a wide range of guest artists.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=afro-celt-sound-system-p200387/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Afro Celt Sound System Biography|last=Harris|first=Graid|publisher=Allmusic.com|accessdate=18 November 2010}}</ref>

Their albums have been released through [[Peter Gabriel]]'s [[Real World Records]], and they have frequently performed at [[WOMAD]] festivals worldwide. Their sales on the label are exceeded only by Gabriel himself. Their recording contract with Real World was for five albums, of which ''Volume 5: Anatomic'' was the last.<ref name="jazzmann">{{cite web|url=http://www.thejazzmann.com/reviews/review/afro-celt-sound-system-capture/|title=Review of Capture|last=Mann|first=Ian|publisher=TheJazzMann.com|accessdate=18 November 2010}}</ref>

After a number of festival dates in 2007, the band went on hiatus. In 2010, they regrouped to play a number of shows (including a return to WOMAD<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realworldrecords.com/news/afro-celt-sound-system-return-to-the-home-where-they-were-launched-in-1995-the-womad-festival |title=News » Real World Records - World music label |publisher=Real World Records |date=2013-09-19 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref>), releasing a re-mastered retrospective titled ''Capture.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realworldrecords.com/catalogue/capture |title=World music label |publisher=Real World Records |date=2013-09-19 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref>

On the 20 May 2014 Afro Celt Sound System launched a new website and with it announced the upcoming release of a new album, ''Born''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://afroceltsoundsystem.com/ |title=Afro Celt Sound System |publisher=Afro Celt Sound System |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref>

==Formation==
The inspiration behind the project dates back to 1991, when Simon Emmerson, a [[Grammy Award]]-nominated British [[Record producer|producer]] and guitarist, collaborated with Afro-pop star [[Baaba Maal]]. While making an album with Maal in Senegal, Emmerson was struck by the similarity between one African melody and a traditional Irish air. Back in London, Irish musician [[Davy Spillane]] told Emmerson about a belief that nomadic Celts lived in Africa or India before they migrated to Western Europe. Whether or not the theory was true, Emmerson was intrigued by the two countries' musical affinities.

In an experiment that would prove successful, Emmerson brought two members of Baaba Maal's band together with traditional Irish musicians to see what kind of music the two groups would create. Adding a dash of modern sound, Emmerson also brought in English dance mixers for an electronic beat. "People thought I was mad when I touted the idea," Emmerson told Jim Carroll of ''[[The Irish Times]]''. "At the time, I was out of favour with the London club scene. I was broke and on income support but the success was extraordinary".{{full|date=November 2012}}

Jamming in the studios at Real World, musician Peter Gabriel's recording facilities in [[Wiltshire, England]], the diverse group of musicians recorded the basis of their first album in one week. This album, ''[[Volume 1: Sound Magic]]'', was released by Real World Records in 1996, and marked the debut of the Afro Celt Sound System, an energetic global fusion the likes of which the music world had not yet seen.

"Prior to that first album being made, none of us knew if it would work," musician James McNally told Larry Katz of the Boston Herald. "We were strangers who didn't even speak the same language. But we were bowled over by this communication that took place beyond language."{{full|date=November 2012}} McNally, who grew up second-generation Irish in London, played whistles, keyboards, piano, [[bodhran]], and bamboo flute.

''Sound Magic'' has now sold over 300,000 copies. The band performed at festivals, raves, and dance clubs and regularly included two African musicians, Moussa Sissokho on talking drum and djembe and [[N'Faly Kouyate]] on vocals, [[Kora (instrument)|kora]] and [[balafon]].

Just as the second album was getting off the ground, one of the group's core musicians, 27-year-old [[keyboardist]] [[Jo Bruce]] (son of [[Cream (band)|Cream]] bass player [[Jack Bruce]]), died suddenly of an [[asthma]] attack. The band was devastated, and the album was put on hold. Then Irish pop star [[Sinéad O'Connor]] came to the rescue, collaborating with the band and helping them cope with their loss. "[O'Connor] blew into the studio on a windy November night and blew away again leaving us something incredibly emotional and powerful," McNally told Katz. "We had this track we didn't know what to do with. Sinéad scribbled a few lyrics and bang! She left us completely choked up."{{full|date=November 2012}} So taken was the band with O'Connor's song, "Release," that they used the name for the title of their album. ''[[Volume 2: Release]]'' hit the music stores in 1999, and by the spring of 2000 it had sold more than half a million copies worldwide.

In 2000 the group was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in the Best World Music category. The band, composed at the time of eight members from six countries (England, [[Senegal]], Guinea, Ireland, France and [[Kenya]]), took pride in its ability to bring people together through music. "We can communicate anywhere at any corner of the planet and feel that we're at home," McNally told Patrick MacDonald of [[The Seattle Times]]''. "We're breaking down categories of world music and rock music and black music. We leave a door open to communicate with each other's traditions. And it's changed our lives".{{full|date=November 2012}}

In 2001 the group released ''[[Volume 3: Further in Time]]'', which climbed to number one on Billboard's Top World Music Albums chart. Featuring guest spots by Peter Gabriel and [[Robert Plant]], the album also incorporated a heightened African sound. "On the first two records, the pendulum swung more toward the Celtic, London club side of the equation," Emmerson told the Irish Times's Carroll. "For this one, we wanted to have more African vocals and input than we'd done before."{{full|date=November 2012}} Again the Afro Celt Sound System met with success. Chuck Taylor of Billboard magazine praised the album as "a cultural phenomenon that bursts past the traditional boundaries of contemporary music."{{full|date=November 2012}} The single "[[When You're Falling]]", with vocals by Gabriel, became a radio hit in the United States.

In 2003, for the ''[[Seed]]'' album, they temporarily changed their name to the simpler '''Afrocelts'''; this was subsequently regarded as a mistake, and they reverted to the longer and more familiar band name for their subsequent albums, ''[[Pod (Afro Celt Sound System album)|Pod]]'', a compilation of new mixes of songs from the first four albums, ''[[Volume 5: Anatomic]]'' (their fifth studio album), and ''[[Capture - Afro Celt Sound System 1995-2010]]".

They played a number of shows to promote ''Volume 5: Anatomic'' in 2006 and summer 2007, ending with a gig in Korea,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afrocelts.org/wst_page9.html |title=Afro Celt Sound System Fan Website - ACSS News |publisher=Afrocelts.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref> before taking an extended break to work on side projects, amongst them ''[[The Imagined Village]]'' featuring Simon Emmerson and Johnny Kalsi. Starting in the summer of 2010, the band performed a series of live shows to promote a new 2-CD album, ''[[Capture - Afro Celt Sound System 1995-2010]]'', released on 6 September 2010 on Real World Records. Further performances continue to the present day, and a new album-in-progress titled ''Born'' was announced on their website in 2014.

==Band members==
