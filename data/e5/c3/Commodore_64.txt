Part of the Commodore 64's success is because it was sold in retail stores instead of just electronics and/or computer stores. Commodore produced many of its parts [[Vertical integration|in-house to control costs]], including custom IC chips from [[MOS Technology]]. It has been compared to the [[Ford Model T]] automobile for its role in bringing a new technology to middle-class households via creative mass-production.<ref name="Kahney">{{cite web|url= http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2003/09/60349|title=Grandiose Price for a Modest PC |last=Kahney|first=Leander|date=September 9, 2003|publisher=CondéNet, Inc|accessdate=September 13, 2008}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:C64 startup animiert.gif|260px|left|thumb|The Commodore&nbsp;64 startup screen]]
In January 1981, [[MOS Technology]], Inc., Commodore's [[integrated circuit]] design subsidiary, initiated a project to design the graphic and audio chips for a next generation [[video game console]]. Design work for the chips, named [[MOS Technology VIC-II]] (Video Integrated Circuit for graphics) and [[MOS Technology SID]] (Sound Interface Device for audio), was completed in November 1981.<ref name="IEEE_Perry_C64">{{cite journal

Commodore then began a game console project that would use the new chips—called the ''Ultimax'' or alternatively the ''[[Commodore MAX Machine]]'', engineered by Yash Terakura from Commodore Japan. This project was eventually cancelled after just a few machines were manufactured for the Japanese market.{{fact|date=March 2015}}

At the same time, Robert "Bob" Russell (system programmer and architect on the [[Commodore VIC-20|VIC-20]]) and Robert "Bob" Yannes (engineer of the SID) were critical of the current product line-up at Commodore, which was a continuation of the [[Commodore PET]] line aimed at business users. With the support of Al Charpentier (engineer of the VIC-II) and Charles Winterble (manager of MOS Technology), they proposed to Commodore CEO [[Jack Tramiel]] a true low-cost sequel to the VIC-20. Tramiel dictated that the machine should have {{nowrap|64 kB}} of [[random-access memory]] (RAM). Although {{nowrap|64 kB}} of [[dynamic random access memory]] (DRAM) cost over {{USD|100}} at the time, he knew that DRAM prices were falling, and would drop to an acceptable level before full production was reached. In November, Tramiel set a deadline for the first weekend of January, to coincide with the 1982 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES).<ref name="IEEE_Perry_C64" />

The product was [[code name]]d the VIC-40 as the successor to the popular [[VIC-20]]. The team that constructed it consisted of Yash Terakura,<ref>http://sceneworld.org/blog/2015/02/12/video-interview-with-yash-terakura/</ref> Bob Russell, Bob Yannes and David A. Ziembicki. The design, prototypes and some sample software were finished in time for the show, after the team had worked tirelessly over both [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] and [[Christmas]] weekends.

The machine incorporated [[Commodore BASIC|Commodore BASIC 2.0]] in [[Read-only memory|ROM]]. BASIC also served as the [[user interface]] [[shell (computing)|shell]] and was available immediately on startup at the <code>READY</code> prompt.

When the product was to be presented, the VIC-40 product was renamed C64.

The C64 made an impressive debut at the January 1982 [[Consumer Electronics Show]], as recalled by Production Engineer David A. Ziembicki: "All we saw at our booth were [[Atari]] people with their mouths dropping open, saying, 'How can you do that for $595?'.".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/9449764/Commodore-64-at-30-computing-for-the-masses.html|title=Commodore 64 at 30: Computing for the Masses|author=Christopher Williams|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''|date=4 August 2012|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref> The answer was [[vertical integration]]; due to Commodore's ownership of [[MOS Technology]]'s [[semiconductor device fabrication|semiconductor fabrication]] facilities, each C64 had an estimated production cost of {{USD|135}}.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Market war===
[[File:CBM64Cartridges.JPG|thumb|right|Game cartridges for ''[[Radar Rat Race]]'' and ''[[International Soccer]]'']]
Upon its introduction in August 1982, the C64 faced a wide range of competing [[home computer]]s.<ref name="computerhistory1982"/> With a lower price and more flexible hardware, it quickly outsold many of its competitors. In the [[United States]] the greatest competitors were the [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 8-bit]] 400, the Atari 800, and the [[Apple II series|Apple&nbsp;II]]. The Atari 400 and 800 had been designed to accommodate previously stringent FCC emissions requirements and so were expensive to manufacture. The latest revision in the aging Apple II line, the Apple IIe, had higher-resolution graphics modes than the C64.<ref name="5150a">{{cite web |url= http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&c=274|title=PC – Model 5150|publisher=old-computers.com|accessdate=September 13, 2008}}</ref><ref name="5150b">{{cite web|url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&c=83|title=Apple IIe|publisher=old-computers.com|accessdate= September 13, 2008}}</ref> Though similar in specifications, the two computers represented differing design philosophies; as an [[open architecture]] system, upgrade capability for the Apple II was granted by internal expansion slots, whereas the C64's comparatively closed architecture had only a single external [[ROM cartridge]] port for bus expansion. However, the Apple used its expansion slots for interfacing to common peripherals like disk drives, printers and modems; the C64 had a variety of ports integrated into its motherboard which were used for these purposes, usually leaving the cartridge port free. Commodore's was not a completely closed system, however; the company had published detailed specifications for most of their models since the PET and VIC-20 days, and the C64 was no exception.

All four machines had similar memory configurations which were standard in 1982–1983: 48K for the Apple II+<ref name="APPLEII+">{{cite web|url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&c=571|title=Apple II+|publisher=old-computers.com|accessdate=September 13, 2008}}</ref> (upgraded within months of C64's release to 64K with the Apple IIe) and 48K for the Atari 800.<ref name="Atari800">{{cite web|url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&c=460|title= Atari 800|publisher=old-computers.com|accessdate=September 13, 2008}}</ref> At upwards of $1,200,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah06.html|title=Apple&nbsp;II History Chap 6|work=Apple II History|accessdate=November 17, 2014}}</ref> the Apple&nbsp;II was about twice as expensive, while the Atari 800 cost $899. One key to the C64's success was Commodore's aggressive marketing tactics, and they were quick to exploit the relative price/performance divisions between its competitors with a series of television commercials after the C64's launch in late 1982.<ref name="Commercials">{{cite web|url=http://www.commodorebillboard.de/Commercials/Commodore/english/CommodoreCommercialsEnglish.htm |title=Commodore Commercials |publisher=commodorebillboard.de |accessdate=September 13, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20080820101519/http://www.commodorebillboard.de/Commercials/Commodore/english/CommodoreCommercialsEnglish.htm |archivedate=August 20, 2008 }}</ref> The company also published detailed documentation to help developers,<ref name="gupta198306">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1983-06-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_037_1983_Jun#page/n135/mode/2up | title=Commodore 64 Programmer's Reference Guide | work=Compute! | date=June 1983 | accessdate=October 30, 2013 | author=Gupta, Anu M. | pages=134 | type=review}}</ref> while Atari initially kept technical information secret.<ref name="tomczyk1984">{{cite book | title=The Home Computer Wars: An Insider's Account of Commodore and Jack Tramiel | publisher=Compute!

Commodore sold the C64 not only through its network of authorized dealers, but also through department stores, discount stores, toy stores and college bookstores. The C64 had a built-in [[RF modulator]] and thus could be plugged into any television set. This allowed it (like its predecessor, the VIC-20) to compete directly against video game consoles such as the [[Atari 2600]]. Like the Apple IIe, the C64 can also output a [[composite video]] signal (avoiding the RF modulator) that can be plugged into a specialized monitor for a sharper picture. Unlike the IIe, the C64's NTSC output capability also includes separate luminance/chroma signal output equivalent to (and electrically compatible with) [[S-Video]], for connection to the [[Commodore 64 peripherals#Other peripherals|Commodore 1702]] monitor, providing even better video quality than a composite signal.

Aggressive pricing of the C64 is considered to have been a major catalyst in the [[North American video game crash of 1983]]. In January 1983, Commodore offered a $100 [[rebate (marketing)|rebate]] in the United States on the purchase of a C64 to anyone trading in another video game console or computer.<ref name="PM Jun 1983">{{cite journal | last = Protecto Enterprise | title = Commodore computer advertisement | journal = Popular Mechanics | volume = 159 | issue = 6 | page = p. 140 | publisher = Hearst Magazines| date = June 1983| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=itUDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA141 | issn = 0032-4558| quote = We pack with your computer a voucher good for $100 rebate from the factory when you send in your old Atari, Mattel, Coleco electronic game or computer …}}</ref> To take advantage of this rebate, some mail-order dealers and retailers offered a [[Timex Sinclair 1000]] for as little as $10 with purchase of a C64, so the consumer could send the TS1000 to Commodore, collect the rebate, and pocket the difference; [[Timex Group USA|Timex Corporation]] departed the computer market within a year. Commodore's tactics soon led to a [[price war]] with the major [[home computer]] manufacturers. The success of the VIC-20 and C64 contributed significantly to the exit of [[Texas Instruments]] and other smaller competitors from the field.

The price war with Texas Instruments was seen as a personal battle for Commodore president [[Jack Tramiel]].<ref name="TM Apr 84">{{cite journal | last = Nocera | first = Joseph| title = Death of a Computer | journal = Texas Monthly | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = pp. 136–139, 216–226 | publisher = Emmis Communications | location = Austin, Texas | date = April 1984| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=DSsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA224| issn = 0148-7736| quote = Once before, Commodore had put out a product in a market where it chief competitor was TI: a line of digital watches.

In Europe, the primary competitors to the C64 were British-built computers: the [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]], the [[BBC Micro]] and the [[Amstrad CPC464]]. In the UK, the 48K Spectrum had not only been released a few months ahead of the C64's early 1983 debut, but it was also selling for £175, less than half the C64's £399 price. The Spectrum quickly became the market leader and Commodore had an uphill struggle against it. The C64 did however go on to rival the Spectrum in popularity in the latter half of the 1980s. Adjusted to the size of population, the popularity of Commodore&nbsp;64 was the highest in Finland where it was subsequently marketed as "the computer of the republic".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://yle.fi/ohjelmat/1285543 | title=Yle: Ohjelmat| date=November 20, 2011 | accessdate=July 15, 2012}}</ref>

In the end it was not lack of demand or the cost of the C64 itself (still profitable at a retail price point between £44 and £50), but the cost of producing the drive that ended the machine's long run. In March 1994, at [[CeBIT]] in [[Hanover]], [[Germany]], Commodore announced that the C64 would be finally discontinued in 1995, <ref name="AFNS">Amiga Format News Special. "Commodore at CeBIT '94".

===The C64 family===
[[File:CommodoreMAX isolated.png|thumb|[[Commodore MAX Machine]]]]
In 1982 Commodore released the [[Commodore MAX Machine]] in [[Japan]]. It was called the Ultimax in the United States, and VC-10 in Germany. The MAX was intended to be a game console with limited computing capability, and was based on a very cut-down version of the hardware family later used in the C64. The MAX was discontinued months after its introduction because of poor sales in Japan.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gamereactor.eu/articles/24131/Gaming's+Defining+Moments+No.+22/|title=Jack Tramiel and the Commodore 64|author=Mike Holmes|publisher=''[[Gamereactor]]''|date=15 April 2012|accessdate=6 August 2015}}</ref>

1983 saw Commodore attempt to compete with the [[Apple&nbsp;II]]'s hold on the U.S. education market with the [[Commodore Educator 64|Educator 64]],<ref name="zimmers">{{cite web|url= http://www.zimmers.net/cbmpics/ced64s.html|title=The Educator 64 & Commodore PET 64 (aka C=4064)| publisher=zimmers.net|accessdate=September 13, 2008}}</ref> essentially a C64 and "greenscale" monochrome monitor in a PET case.

[[File:Sx-64 build crop.jpg|thumb|right|[[Commodore SX-64]]]]
Also in 1983, Commodore released the [[Commodore SX-64|SX-64]], a portable version of the C64. The SX-64 has the distinction of being the first ''full-color'' [[portable computer]]. While earlier computers using this form factor only incorporated monochrome "green screen" displays, the base SX-64 unit featured a {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} color [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) and an integrated [[Commodore 1541|1541]] floppy disk drive. Unlike most other C64s, the SX-64 did not have a cassette connector.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/01/20/tob_commodore_sx_64/|title=Remembering the Commodore SX-64|author=Austin Modine|publisher=''[[The Register]]''|date=20 Jan 2008|accessdate=19 August 2015}}</ref>

In 1984, Commodore released the [[Commodore Plus/4]]. It has a higher-color display, a newer implementation of [[Commodore BASIC]] (V3.5), and built-in software in what was positioned as an inexpensive business oriented system. However, it is incompatible with the C64, and the burgeoning [[influence of the IBM PC on the personal computer market]] market rendered the limited business software of the Plus/4 system of marginal value. The Plus/4 lacks hardware [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] capability and lacks a [[MOS Technology SID|SID chip]], thus underperforming in two of the areas that had made the C64 successful.

Two designers at Commodore, Fred Bowen and [[Bil Herd]], were determined to rectify the problems of the [[Commodore Plus/4|Plus/4]]. They intended that the eventual successors to the C64—the [[Commodore 128]] and 128D computers (1985)—were to build upon the C64, avoiding the Plus/4's flaws.<ref name="kirps.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.kirps.com/web/main/_blog/all/in-memory-of-the-commodore-c128.shtml|title=In Memory Of The Commodore C128 - Popular Science and Technology Blog by Jos Kirps|publisher=|accessdate=November 17, 2014}}</ref><ref name = "InfoWorld Jan 1985">{{cite journal | last = Mace | first = Scott| title = Commodore Shows New 128 | journal = InfoWorld | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = pp. 19–20 | publisher = Popular Computing | location = Menlo Park, CA | date = January 28, 1985| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=6i4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA19| issn = 0199-6649}}</ref> The successors had many improvements such as a structured BASIC with graphics and sound commands, 80-column display ability, and full [[CP/M]] compatibility. The decision to make the [[Commodore 128]] [[plug compatible]] with the C64 was made quietly by Bowen and Herd, software and hardware designers respectively, without the knowledge or approval by the management in the post [[Jack Tramiel]] era. The designers were careful not to reveal their decision until the project was too far along to be challenged or changed and still make the impending Consumer Electronics Show (CES) show in Las Vegas.<ref name="kirps.com"/> Upon learning that the C128 was designed to be compatible with the C64, Commodore's marketing department independently announced that the C128 would be 100% compatible with the C64, thereby raising the bar for C64 support. In a case of [[malicious compliance]], the 128 design was altered to include a separate "64 mode" using a complete C64 environment to ensure total compatibility.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

[[File:C64c system.jpg|thumb|Commodore 64c with [[Commodore 1541|1541-II]] floppy disk drive and 1084S monitor displaying television-compatible [[S-video]]]]
In 1986, Commodore released the 64c computer, which is functionally identical to the original. The exterior design was remodeled in the sleeker style of the [[Commodore 128]].{{r|wagner198608}} The 64c's modifications are more than skin-deep with new versions of the SID, VIC and I/O chips being deployed—with the core voltage reduced from 12V to 9V. In the [[United States]], the 64c was often bundled with the third-party [[GEOS (8-bit operating system)|GEOS]] [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) based operating system, as well as the software needed to access [[QuantumLink]]. The [[Commodore 1541]] disk drive received a matching face-lift resulting in the 1541c. Later a smaller, sleeker 1541-II model was introduced along with the {{nowrap|800 kB}} 3.5-inch [[microfloppy]] [[Commodore 1581|1581]].

[[File:C64GS-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|right|[[Commodore 64 Games System]] "C64GS"]]
In 1990, the C64 was repackaged in the form of a game console, called the [[Commodore 64 Games System|C64 Games System]] (C64GS), with most external connectivity removed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrogamingcollector.com/Vintage-Consoles/CommodoreC64GS.html|title=Commodore C64GS|quote=The Commodore 64 Games System, generally referred to as the C64GS is basically a Commodore 64 computer, with the keyboard and most other connectivity removed. You have the base unit, a cartridge port, two joystick ports, RF and Video outs... and that's your lot.}}</ref> A simple modification to the 64c's motherboard was made to allow cartridges to be inserted from above. A modified ROM replaced the BASIC interpreter with a boot screen to inform the user to insert a cartridge. Designed to compete with the Nintendo Entertainment System and the Sega Master System, it suffered from very low sales compared to its rivals. It was another commercial failure for Commodore, and it was never released outside Europe.

In 1990, an advanced successor to the C64, the [[Commodore 65]] (also known as the "C64DX"), was prototyped, but the project was canceled by Commodore's chairman [[Irving Gould]] in 1991. The C65's specifications are very good for an 8-bit computer, bringing specs comparable to the 16-bit [[Apple&nbsp;IIgs]]. For example, it can display 256 colors on screen, while [[Amiga Original chipset|OCS]] based Amigas can only display 64 in [[Amiga Halfbrite mode|HalfBrite]] mode (32 colors and half-bright transformations). Although no specific reason was given for the C65's cancellation, it would have competed in the marketplace with Commodore's lower end Amigas and the [[Commodore CDTV]].

===C64 clone===
In the middle of 2004, after an absence from the marketplace of more than 10 years, PC manufacturer [[Tulip Computers]] BV (owners of the Commodore brand since 1997) announced the [[C64 Direct-to-TV]] (C64DTV), a [[joystick]]-based [[handheld TV game|TV game]] based on the C64 with 30 games built into ROM. Designed by [[Jeri Ellsworth]], a self-taught computer designer who had earlier designed the modern [[C-One]] C64 implementation, the C64DTV was similar in concept to other mini-consoles based on the [[Atari 2600]] and [[Intellivision]] which had gained modest success earlier in the decade. The product was advertised on [[QVC]] in the United States for the 2004 holiday season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/20/technology/a-toy-with-a-story.html|title=A Toy with a Story|author=John Markoff|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=20 December 2004|accessdate=20 August 2015}}</ref> By ''"hacking"'' the [[circuit board]], it is possible to attach [[Commodore 1541|C1541]] floppy disk drives, hard drives, second joysticks, and [[PS/2 port|PS/2]]-keyboards to these units, which gives the DTV devices nearly all of the capabilities of a full Commodore 64.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The DTV hardware is also used in the mini-console ''Hummer'', sold at [[RadioShack]] in mid-2005.

===Newer compatible hardware===
C64 enthusiasts still develop new hardware, including [[Ethernet]] cards,<ref name="Dunkels">{{cite web|url=http://www.dunkels.com/adam/tfe/|title=The Final Ethernet – C64 Ethernet Cartridge|last= Dunkels|first=Adam|accessdate=September 13, 2008}}</ref> specially adapted [[hard disk]]s and [[flash memory|flash]] card interfaces ([[sd2iec]]).<ref name="sd2iec">{{cite web|url=http://www.c64-wiki.com/index.php/SD2IEC|title=SD2IEC on c64 wiki}}</ref>

===Brand reuse===

===Virtual Console===
Several Commodore 64 games were released on the [[Wii|Nintendo Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] service in Europe and North America only. The games were removed from the service as of August 2013 for unknown reasons.{{cn|date=March 2015}}

==Software==
{{Main|Commodore 64 software}}

In 1982, the C64's graphics and sound capabilities were rivaled only by the [[Atari 8-bit family]], and appeared exceptional when compared with the widely publicised [[Atari VCS]] and [[Apple&nbsp;II]].

The C64 is often credited with starting the computer [[subculture]] known as the [[demoscene]] (see [[Commodore 64 demos]]). It is still being actively used in the demoscene,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lyonlabs.org/commodore/c4-2008/c4-2008.html |title=C=4 Expo 2008 |publisher=Lyonlabs.org |date= |accessdate=April 22, 2013}}</ref> especially for music (its [[MOS Technology SID|sound chip]] even being used in special sound cards for PCs, and the [[Elektron SidStation]] synthesizer).

Even though other computers quickly caught up with it, the C64 remained a strong competitor to the later [[video game console]]s [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) and [[Sega Master System]], thanks in part to its by-then established software base, especially outside North America, where it comprehensively outsold the NES.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===BASIC===
{{Main|Commodore BASIC}}
[[File:Simons Basic Splash Screen.gif|thumb|right|The Simons' BASIC start-up screen. Note the altered background and text colors (vs the ordinary C64 blue tones), and the {{nowrap|8 [[kilobyte|kB]]}} reduction of available BASIC program memory due to the [[address space]] used by the cartridge.]]

As is common for home computers of the early 1980s, the C64 incorporates a ROM-based version of the [[BASIC]] programming language. There is no [[operating system]] as such. The [[KERNAL]] is accessed via BASIC commands. The disk drive has its own [[microprocessor]], much like the earlier CBM/PET systems and the [[Atari 400]] & [[Atari 800]]. This means that no memory space is dedicated to running a [[disk operating system]], as was the case with earlier systems such as the [[Apple&nbsp;II]] and [[TRS-80]].

Commodore BASIC 2.0 is used instead of the more advanced BASIC 4.0 from the PET series, since C64 users were not expected to need the disk-oriented enhancements of BASIC 4.0. The company did not expect many to buy a disk drive, and using BASIC 2.0 simplified VIC-20 owners' transition to the 64.<ref name="heimarck198706">{{cite news | url=http://archive.org/stream/1987-06-computegazette/Compute_Gazette_Issue_48_1987_Jun#page/n21/mode/2up | title=When 2 + 3.5 + 4 = 7 / The Evolution of Commodore BASIC | work=Compute!'s Gazette | date=June 1987 | accessdate=June 30, 2014 | author=Heimarck, Todd | pages=20–26}}</ref> "The choice of BASIC 2.0 instead of 4.0 was made with some soul-searching, not just at random. The typical user of a C64 is not expected to need the direct disk commands as much as other extensions and the amount of memory to be committed to BASIC were to be limited. We chose to leave expansion space for color and sound extensions instead of the disk features. As a result, you will have to handle the disk in the more cumbersome manner of the 'old days'."<ref>"C64 Basic Introduction", ''Commodore Magazine'', August 1982, p. 65.</ref>

The version of BASIC is limited and does not include specific commands for sound or graphics manipulation, instead requiring users to use the "[[PEEK and POKE]]" commands to access the graphics and sound chip registers directly. To provide extended commands, including graphics and sound, Commodore produced two different cartridge-based extension to BASIC 2.0: [[Simons' BASIC]] and [[Super Expander 64]].

Other languages available for the C64 include [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[C (programming language)|C]], <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lyonlabs.org/commodore/powerc.html|title=Power C for the Commodore 64}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clipshop.ca/Aztec/compilers.htm#commodore|title=Wonderfully Ancient Aztec C Compilers}}</ref> [[Logo (programming language)|Logo]], [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]], and [[FORTRAN]]. Compilers for BASIC 2.0 such as Petspeed&nbsp;2 (from Commodore), Blitz (from Jason Ranheim) and Turbo Lightning (from Ocean Software) were produced. While much of the first generation of C64 software used the standard BASIC, after 1983 almost all professionally produced programs were written in [[assembly language]], either [[cross development|cross developed]] on a larger computer, or directly on the C64 using a machine code monitor or an assembler. This maximized speed and minimized memory use.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Alternative operating systems===
[[File:GeOS Commodore 64.gif|thumb|[[GEOS (8-bit operating system)|GEOS]] for the Commodore 64]]
Many third party operating systems have been developed for the C64. As well as the original [[GEOS (8-bit operating system)|GEOS]], two third-party GEOS-compatible systems have been written: [[Wheels (operating system)|Wheels]] and [[GEOS megapatch]]. Both of these require hardware  upgrades to the original C64. Several other operating systems are or have been available, including [[WiNGS OS]], the Unix-like [[LUnix]], operated from a command-line, and the embedded systems OS [[Contiki]], with full GUI. Other less well known OSes include ACE, Asterix, DOS/65 and [[GeckOS]].

A version of [[CP/M]] was released, but this requires the addition of an external Z80 processor to the expansion bus. Furthermore, the Z80 processor is underclocked to be compatible with the C64's memory bus, so performance is poor compared to other CP/M implementations. C64 CP/M and C128 CP/M both suffer a lack of software; although most commercial CP/M software can run on these systems, software media is incompatible between platforms. The low usage of CP/M on Commodores means that software houses saw no need to invest in mastering versions for the Commodore disk format.

===Networking software===
During the 1980s, the Commodore 64 was used to run [[bulletin board system]]s using software packages such as [[Bizarre 64]], [[Blue Board (software)|Blue Board]], C-Net, [[Color 64]], CMBBS, C-Base, DMBBS, Image BBS, and The Deadlock Deluxe BBS Construction Kit, often with [[sysop]]-made modifications. These boards sometimes were used to distribute [[cracked software]]. As late as December 2013, there were 25 such Bulletin Board Systems in operation, reachable via the [[Telnet]] protocol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cbbsoutpost.servebbs.com|title=Commodore BBS Outpost|publisher=|accessdate=November 17, 2014}}</ref>

There were major commercial [[online services]], such as [[Compunet]] (UK), [[CompuServe]] (US – later bought by [[America Online]]), [[The Source (online service)|The Source]] (US) and [[Minitel]] (France) among many others. These services usually required custom software which was often bundled with a [[modem]] and included free online time as they were billed by the minute.

[[Quantum Link]] (or Q-Link) was a U.S. and Canadian online service for Commodore 64 and 128 personal computers that operated from November 5, 1985, to November 1, 1994. It was operated by [[Quantum Computer Services]] of [[Vienna, Virginia|Vienna]], Virginia, which in October 1991 changed its name to [[America Online]], and continued to operate its [[AOL]] service for the [[IBM PC compatible]] and Apple [[Macintosh]]. Q-Link was a modified version of the [[PlayNET]] system, which [[Control Video Corporation]] (CVC, later renamed Quantum Computer Services) licensed.

===Online gaming===
{{Main|History of massively multiplayer online games}}
The first graphical character-based interactive environment is ''[[Club Caribe]]''. First released as ''[[Habitat (video game)|Habitat]]'' in 1988, ''Club Caribe'' was introduced by [[LucasArts]] for [[Q-Link]] customers on their Commodore 64 computers. Users could interact with one another, chat and exchange items. Although the game's [[open world]] was very basic, its use of online avatars (already well-established off-line by [[Ultima (series)|''Ultima'']] and other games) and combination of chat and graphics was revolutionary. Online graphics in the late 1980s were severely restricted by the need to support modem data transfer rates as slow as 300 [[bits per second]]. Habitat's graphics were stored locally on floppy disk, eliminating the need for network transfer.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sdtimes.com/sd-times-blog-strangest-software-project-ive-ever-run/|title=The Strangest Software Project I’ve Ever Run|author=Alex Handy|publisher=''[[SD Times]]''|date=23 September 2014|accessdate=19 August 2015}}</ref>

==Hardware==
{{Repetition|date=April 2010}}

===CPU and memory===
{{Main|MOS Technology 6510}}

The C64 uses an [[8-bit]] [[MOS Technology 6510]] [[microprocessor]]. This is a close derivative of the [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] with an added 6-bit internal I/O port that in the C64 is used for two purposes: to [[Bank switching|bank-switch]] the machine's [[read-only memory]] (ROM) in and out of the processor's address space, and to operate the [[Commodore Datasette|datasette]] tape recorder.

The C64 has {{nowrap|64½ kB}} of [[random-access memory|RAM]], of which 1 kb of ½ bytes are color RAM for text mode and {{nowrap|38 kB}} are available to built-in [[Commodore BASIC]] 2.0 on startup. There is {{nowrap|20 kB}} of ROM, made up of the BASIC interpreter, the kernel, and the character ROM. As the processor could only address {{nowrap|64 kB}} at a time, the [[read-only memory|ROM]] was mapped into memory and only {{nowrap|38,911 bytes}} of RAM (plus 4 kb between ROMs) were available at startup.

If a program does not use the BASIC interpreter, RAM can be read as well as written over that ROM's location. However, this means the character ROM is not available, and the RAM in its place is instead used for the character glyphs. Normally, this RAM is uninitialized, which then results in nothing but random patterns appearing on the screen. This is solved by copying the character ROM into RAM. This had two benefits: the standard typeface can be rewritten, and character codes can be rewritten as picture elements. 

Most C64 games have been written in this way, using low resolution, which requires much less processor time and memory. Furthermore, picture elements can be reused, saving even more memory. The same technique is used on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]].

===Graphics===
{{Main|MOS Technology VIC-II}}

The [[Video Display Controller|graphics chip]], [[MOS Technology VIC-II|VIC-II]], features 16 colors, eight hardware [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] per [[scanline]] (enabling up to 112 sprites per PAL screen), [[scrolling]] capabilities, and two bitmap graphics modes. The standard text mode features 40 columns, like most [[Commodore PET]] models; the built in character encoding is not standard [[ASCII]] but [[PETSCII]], an extended form of ASCII-1963.

Most screenshots show borders around the screen, which is a feature of the VIC-II chip. By utilizing interrupts to reset various hardware registers on precise timings it was possible to place graphics within the borders and thus utilize the full screen.<ref name="Ojala">{{cite web| url=http://www.antimon.org/dl/c64/code/opening.txt|title=Opening the Borders|last=Ojala|first=Pasi| accessdate=September 13, 2008}}</ref>

There are two low-resolution and two bitmapped modes. Multicolor bitmapped mode has an addressable screen of 160&nbsp;×&nbsp;200 pixels, with a maximum of four colors per 4&nbsp;×&nbsp;8 character block. High-resolution bitmapped mode has an addressable screen of 320&nbsp;×&nbsp;200 pixels, with a maximum of two colors per 8&nbsp;×&nbsp;8 character block.

Multicolor low-resolution has a screen of 160&nbsp;×&nbsp;200 pixels, 40&nbsp;×&nbsp;25 addressable with four colors per 8&nbsp;×&nbsp;8 character block; high resolution "low resolution" has a screen of 320&nbsp;×&nbsp;200 pixels, 40&nbsp;×&nbsp;25 addressable with two colors per 8&nbsp;×&nbsp;8 character block. Most C64 video games are multicolor low-resolution; this allows only block-by-block character animation due to the limited addressable space. However, further innovation allows video chips to automate [[sprites (computer graphics)|sprites]] and vertical and horizontal scrolling pixel-by-pixel, allowing graphics to work smoothly and quickly regardless of the video mode. Some animation, like bullets, use character animation when sprites are unavailable.

===Sound===
{{Main|MOS Technology SID}}

The [[MOS Technology SID|SID]] chip has three channels, each with its own [[ADSR envelope]] generator and filter capabilities. [[ring modulation]] makes use of channel N°3, to work with the other two channels. [[Robert Yannes|Bob Yannes]] developed the SID chip and later co-founded synthesizer company [[Ensoniq]]. Yannes criticized other contemporary computer sound chips as "primitive, obviously...designed by people who knew nothing about music". Often the game music has become a hit of its own among C64 users. Well-known composers and programmers of game music on the C64 are [[Rob Hubbard]], [[Tel Jeroen]], [[David Whittaker (video game composer)|David Whittaker]], [[Chris Hülsbeck]], [[Ben Daglish]], [[Martin Galway]] and David Dunn among many others. Due to the chip's three channels, chords are played as [[arpeggio]]s, coining the C64's characteristic lively sound. It was also possible to continuously update the master volume with sampled data to enable the playback of 4-bit digitized audio. As of 2008, it became possible to play four channel 8-bit audio samples, 2 SID channels and still use filtering.<ref>{{cite web|title=New revolutionary C64 music routine unveiled|publisher=C64Music!|year=2008|url=http://c64music.blogspot.com.au/2008/11/new-revolutionary-c64-music-routine.html|accessdate=May 20, 2014}}</ref>

There are two versions of the SID chip: the 6581 and the 8580. The MOS Technology 6581 was used in the original ("breadbox") C64s, the early versions of the 64c, and the [[Commodore 128]]. The 6581 was replaced with the MOS Technology 8580 in 1987. The 6581 sound quality is a little crisper, and many Commodore 64 fans have said that they prefer its sound. The main difference between the 6581 and the 8580 is the supply voltage. The 6581 uses a {{nowrap|12 volt}} supply—the 8580, a {{nowrap|9 volt}} supply. A modification can be made to use the 6581 in a newer 64c board (which uses the {{nowrap|9 volt}} chip).

The SID chip's distinctive sound has allowed it to retain a following long after its host computer was discontinued. A number of audio enthusiasts and companies have designed [[MOS Technology SID#Hardware reimplementations|SID-based products]] as add-ons for the C64, [[x86|x86 PCs]], and standalone or [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] music devices such as the [[Elektron SidStation]]. These devices use chips taken from excess stock, or removed from used computers.

In 2007, [[Timbaland]]'s extensive use of the [[SidStation]] led to the [[2007 Timbaland plagiarism controversy|plagiarism controversy]] for "Block Party" and "[[Do It (Nelly Furtado song)|Do It]]" (written for [[Nelly Furtado]]).

===Hardware revisions===
Cost reduction was the driving force behind the C64's vintage motherboard revisions. Reducing [[manufacturing cost]]s was vitally important to Commodore's survival during the [[price war]] and leaner years of the 16-bit era. The C64's original ([[NMOS logic|NMOS]] based) motherboard would go through two major redesigns, (and numerous sub-revisions) exchanging positions of the VIC-II, SID and [[programmable logic array|PLA]] chips. Initially, a large portion of the cost was eliminated by reducing the number of discrete components, such as [[diode]]s and [[resistor]]s, which enabled the use of a smaller [[printed circuit board]].

The case is made from [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] plastic which may become brown with time. This can be reversed by using the public domain chemical mix "[[Retr0bright]]".

[[File:C64Cmotherboard.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A C64C motherboard ("C64E" Rev B PAL 1992).]]

====ICs====
The VIC-II was manufactured with 5 [[micrometre|micrometer]] NMOS technology<ref name="IEEE_Perry_C64" /> and was clocked at either {{nowrap|17.73447 MHz}} (PAL) or {{nowrap|14.31818 MHz}} (NTSC). Internally, the clock was divided down to generate the dot clock (about 8&nbsp;MHz) and the [[two-phase clock|two-phase system clocks]] (about 1&nbsp;MHz; the exact pixel and system clock speeds are slightly different between NTSC and PAL machines). At such high clock rates, the chip generated a lot of heat, forcing MOS Technology to use a ceramic [[dual in-line package]] called a "CERDIP". The ceramic package was more expensive, but it dissipated heat more effectively than plastic.

After a redesign in 1983, the VIC-II was encased in a plastic dual in-line package, which reduced costs substantially, but it did not totally eliminate the heat problem.<ref name="IEEE_Perry_C64" /> Without a ceramic package, the VIC-II required the use of a [[heat sink]]. To avoid extra cost, the metal [[radio frequency|RF]] [[electromagnetic shielding|shielding]] doubled as the heat sink for the VIC, although not all units shipped with this type of shielding. Most C64s in [[Europe]] shipped with a cardboard [[Electromagnetic shielding|RF shield]], coated with a layer of metal foil. The effectiveness of the cardboard was highly questionable, and worse still it acted as an insulator, blocking airflow which trapped heat generated by the SID, VIC, and PLA chips.

The SID was originally manufactured using NMOS at 7 and in some areas 6 micrometers.<ref name="IEEE_Perry_C64" /> The prototype SID and some very early production models featured a ceramic dual in-line package, but unlike the VIC-II, these are extremely rare as the SID was encased in plastic when production started in early 1982.

====Motherboard====
In 1986, Commodore released the last revision to the classic C64 [[motherboard]]. It was otherwise identical to the 1984 design, except for the two 64 [[kilobit]] × 4 bit [[DRAM]] chips that replaced the original eight 64 kilobit × 1 bit ICs.

After the release of the Commodore 64c,<ref name='Commodore 64c abbreviated as "C64C" (capital c on both ends)'>{{cite web|last1=Kirk|first1=Mandy|title=Commodore 64C System Guide at Auction on ebay|url=http://www.ebay.com/itm/Commodore-64C-Personal-Computer-System-Programming-Guide-Manual-RARE-/321552326540?pt=US_Vintage_Computing_Manuals_Merchandise&hash=item4ade031f8c|website=www.ebay.com|publisher=Commodore International|accessdate=October 17, 2014}}</ref> MOS Technology began to reconfigure the original C64's chipset to use [[HMOS]] production technology. The main benefit of using HMOS was that it required less voltage to drive the IC, which consequently generates less heat. This enhanced the overall reliability of the SID and VIC-II. The new chipset was renumbered to 85xx to reflect the change to HMOS.

In 1987, Commodore released a 64c variant with a highly redesigned motherboard commonly known as a "short board". The new board used the new HMOS chipset, featuring a new 64-pin PLA chip. The new "SuperPLA", as it was dubbed, integrated many discrete components and [[transistor–transistor logic]] (TTL) chips. In the last revision of the 64c motherboard, the 2114 color RAM was integrated into the SuperPLA.

===Power supply===
[[Image:Commodore 64 - Joystickports, EinAus-Schalter, Poweranschluss.jpg|thumb|{{nowrap|Joystick ports}}, {{nowrap|power switch}}, {{nowrap|power inlet}}]]
The C64 used an external [[power supply]], a [[Linear power supply|conventional transformer]] with multiple tappings (as opposed to [[Switched-mode power supply|switch mode]], the type now used on PC power supplies), encased in an [[epoxy]] resin gel which discouraged tampering but tended to increase the heat level during use.

This saved space within the computer's case and allowed international versions to be more easily manufactured. The [[Commodore 1541|1541-II]] and [[Commodore 1581|1581]] disk drives, along with various third-party clones, also come with their own external power supply "bricks", as did most peripherals leading to a "spaghetti" of cables and the use of numerous double adapters by users. These power supplies are notorious for failing over time; the computer reportedly had a 30% return rate in late 1983, compared to the 5-7% the industry considered acceptable.<ref name = "Infoworld Nov 1983">{{Cite journal | last = Mace | first = Scott | title = Commodore 64: Many unhappy returns | journal = InfoWorld | volume = 5 | issue = 46 | page = p. 23 | publisher = Popular Computing Inc. | date = November 13, 1983 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=wS8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA23 | issn = 0199-6649}}</ref><ref name="anderson198403">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/creativecomputing-1984-03/Creative_Computing_v10_n03_1984_Mar#page/n57/mode/2up | title=Commodore | work=Creative Computing | date=March 1984 | accessdate=6 February 2015 | author=Anderson, John J. | pages=56 | authorlink=John J. Anderson}}</ref>

Commodore later changed the design, omitting the gel. The follow-on model, the Commodore 128, used a larger, improved power supply that included a fuse. The power supply that came with the [[Commodore REU]] was similar to that of the Commodore 128's unit, providing an upgrade for customers who purchased that accessory.

==Reception==
''[[BYTE]]'' in July 1983 stated that "the 64 retails for $595. At that price it promises to be one of the hottest contenders in the under-$1000 personal computer market". It described SID as "a true music synthesizer...the quality of the sound has to be heard to be believed", while criticizing the use of Commodore BASIC 2.0, the floppy disk performance which is "even slower than the [[Atari 810]] drive", and Commodore's quality control.<ref name="wszola198307">{{cite news | url=http://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-07/1983_07_BYTE_08-07_Videotex#page/n231/mode/2up | title=Commodore 64 | work=BYTE | date=July 1983 | accessdate=October 20, 2013 | author=Wszola, Stan | pages=232}}</ref>
