A month later Tchaikovsky wrote back to her: &quot;It is a very pretty piece, but it is much too short.

One side argues that the term is a misnomer, an inappropriate label which Debussy himself opposed. In a letter of 1908 he wrote: &quot;I am trying to do 'something different' an effect of reality... what the imbeciles call 'impressionism', a term which is as poorly used as possible, particularly by the critics, since they do not hesitate to apply it to [J.M.W.]<space/><link><target>J.

Debussy became a frequent participant at<space/><link><target>Stphane Mallarm</target></link>'s Symbolist gatherings, where Wagnerism dominated the discussion. However, in contrast to the enormous works of Wagner and other late-romantic composers around this time, Debussy chose to write in smaller, more accessible forms.</paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><italics><link><target>Deux arabesques</target></link></italics><space/>is an example of one of Debussy's earliest works, already developing his musical language.<space/><italics><link><target>Suite bergamasque</target></link></italics><space/>(1890) recalls<space/><link><target>rococo</target></link><space/>decorousness with a modern cynicism and puzzlement, and contains one of Debussy's most popular pieces,<space/><italics><link><target>Suite bergamasque</target><part>Clair de Lune</part></link></italics>.

In contrast to the large orchestras so favoured by late-romanticism, Debussy wrote this piece for a smaller ensemble, emphasizing instrumental colour and timbre. Despite Mallarm himself and colleague and friend<space/><link><target>Paul Dukas</target></link><space/>having been impressed by the piece, it was controversial at its premiere, but nevertheless established Debussy as one of the leading composers of the era.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Middle works</heading><preblock><preline>The three<space/><italics><link><target>Nocturnes (Debussy)</target><part>Nocturnes</part></link></italics><space/>(1899) include characteristic studies: in<space/><italics>Nuages</italics>, using veiled harmony and texture;<space/><italics>Ftes</italics>, in exuberance; and<space/><italics>Sirnes</italics>, using whole-tones.

He uses scales such as the whole tone scale, musical modes, and the octatonic scale in his preludes which exaggerate this tonal ambiguity, making the key of each prelude almost indistinguishable at times. The second book of Preludes for piano represents Debussy's strong interest in the indefinite and esoteric.</paragraph><paragraph><template><target>Listen</target><arg name="type">music

In addition to the Russian composers, one of Debussy's biggest influences was Richard Wagner. According to Pierre Louys, Debussy &quot;did not see 'what anyone can do beyond Tristan.<template><target>'&quot;</target></template><extension extension_name='ref' name="leshow"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>After Debussy's Wagner phase, he started to become immensely interested in non-Western music and its unorthodox approaches to composition. Specifically, he was drawn to the Javanese<space/><link><target>Gamelan</target></link>: a musical ensemble from the island of<space/><link><target>Java</target></link><space/>that played an array of unique instrumentation, including<space/><link><target>gongs</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>metallophones</target></link>. He first heard the gamelan at the 1889 Paris Exposition. Debussy was not interested in directly quoting his non-Western influences, but instead allowed this non-Western aesthetic to generally influence his own musical work, for example, by frequently using quiet, unresolved dissonances, coupled with the damper pedal, to emulate the &quot;shimmering&quot; effect created by a<space/><link><target>gamelan</target></link><space/>ensemble.</paragraph><paragraph>Debussy was just as influenced by other art forms as he was by music, if not more so. He took a strong interest in literature and visual art, and used these mediums to help shape his unique musical style. Debussy was heavily influenced by the French symbolist movement of the 1880s, which encompassed poetry, visual art, and theatre. He shared the movement's interest in the esoteric and indefinite and their rejection of<space/><link><target>Naturalism (literature)</target><part>naturalism</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Realism (arts)</target><part>realism</part></link>. Specifically, &quot;the development of<space/><link><target>free verse</target></link><space/>in poetry and the disappearance of the subject or model in painting influenced Debussy to think about issues of musical form.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="leshow"></extension><space/>Debussy became personally acquainted with writers and painters of the movement, and based some of his own works on those of the symbolists. The poet<space/><link><target>Stphane Mallarm</target></link><space/>was a major influence, who in talking of &quot;a 'musicalization' of poetry&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="leshow"></extension><space/>laid claim to a strong connection between music and his own poetry. Debussy's &quot;<link><target>Prlude l'aprs-midi d'un faune</target></link>&quot; was directly influenced by Mallarm's poem<space/><link><target>L'aprs-midi d'un faune (poem)</target><part>&quot;Afternoon of a Faun&quot;</part></link>. Like the symbolists in respect to their own art forms, Debussy aimed to reject common techniques and approaches to composition and attempted to evoke more of a sensorial experience for the listener with his works. Since his time at the Paris Conservatoire, Debussy believed he had much more to learn from artists than from musicians, who were primarily interested in their musical careers.</paragraph><paragraph>Above all, Debussy was inspired by nature and the impression it made on the mind, making a pantheistic profession of faith when he called &quot;mysterious<space/><link><target>Pantheism</target><part>Nature</part></link>&quot; his religion. 'I do not practice religion in accordance with the sacred rites. I have made mysterious Nature my religion. I do not believe that a man is any nearer to God for being clad in priestly garments, nor that one place in a town is better adapted to meditation than another. When I gaze at a sunset sky and spend hours contemplating its marvellous ever-changing beauty, an extraordinary emotion overwhelms me. Nature in all its vastness is truthfully reflected in my sincere though feeble soul. Around me are the trees stretching up their branches to the skies, the perfumed flowers gladdening the meadow, the gentle grass-carpeted earth, ... and my hands unconsciously assume an attitude of adoration. ... To feel the supreme and moving beauty of the spectacle to which Nature invites her ephemeral guests! ... that is what I call prayer.'<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="title">Claude Debussy: His Life and Works</arg><arg name="year">1933</arg><arg name="publisher">Oxford University Press, H.
