A '''drink''' or '''beverage''' is a [[liquid]] intended for [[human]] consumption. In addition to basic needs, beverages form part of the [[culture]] of human society. Although all beverages, including juice, soft drinks, and carbonated drinks, have some form of [[water]] in them, water itself is often not classified as a beverage, and the word ''[[wikt:beverage|beverage]]'' has been recurrently defined as not referring to water.

An [[alcoholic beverage]] is a drink containing [[ethanol]], commonly known as alcohol, although in [[chemistry]] the definition of an alcohol includes many other compounds. Alcoholic beverages, such as [[wine]], [[beer]], and [[liquor]], have been part of human culture and development for 8,000 years.

Non-alcoholic beverages often signify drinks that would normally contain alcohol, such as [[beer]] and [[wine]] but are made with less than .5 percent alcohol by volume. The category includes drinks that have undergone an alcohol removal process such as non-alcoholic beers and de-alcoholized wines.

==Biology==
When the human body becomes dehydrated it experiences the sensation of ''[[thirst]]''. This craving of fluids results in an instinctive need to drink. Thirst is regulated by the [[hypothalamus]] in response to subtle changes in the body's [[electrolyte]] levels, and also as a result of changes in the volume of blood circulating. The complete elimination of beverages, i.e. water, from the body will result in death faster than the removal of any other substance.<ref name="Cheney">{{cite journal|last=Cheney|first=Ralph|date=July 1947|title=The Biology and Economics of the Beverage Industry|journal=Economic Botany|volume=1|issue=3|pages=243–275|jstor=4251857|doi=10.1007/bf02858570}}</ref> Water and milk have been basic drinks throughout history.<ref name="Cheney" /> As water is essential for life, it has also been the carrier of many diseases.<ref name="Liquid Pleasure">{{cite book|last=Burnett|first=John|title=Liquid Pleasures: A Social History of Drinks in Modern Britain|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|pages=1–20|isbn=9781134788798}}</ref>

As mankind evolved, new techniques were discovered to create drinks from the plants that were native to their areas.

==History==
[[File:Bacchusbycaravaggio.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Caravagio]]'s interpretation of Bacchus]]
Drinking has been a large part of socialising throughout the centuries. In [[Ancient Greece]], a social gathering for the purpose of drinking was known as a [[symposium]], where watered down wine would be drunk. The purpose of these gatherings could be anything from serious discussions to direct indulgence. In [[Ancient Rome]], a similar concept of a ''convivium'' took place regularly.

Many early societies considered alcohol a gift from the gods,<ref name="Beverage Book">{{cite book|last=Katsigris|first=Costas|author2=Thomas, Chris|title=The Bar and Beverage Book|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2006|pages=5–10|isbn=9780470073445}}</ref> leading to the creation of gods such as [[Dionysus]]. Other religions forbid, discourage, or restrict the drinking of alcoholic beverages for various reasons. In [[List of countries with alcohol prohibition|some regions]] with a dominant religion the production, sale, and consumption of alcoholic beverages is forbidden to everybody, regardless of religion.

[[Toast (honor)|Toasting]] is a method of honouring a person or wishing good will by taking a drink.<ref name="Beverage Book" /> Another tradition is that of the [[loving cup]], at weddings or other celebrations such as sports victories a group will share a drink in a large receptacle, shared by everyone until empty.<ref name="Beverage Book" />

In East Africa and Yemen, coffee was used in native religious ceremonies. As these ceremonies conflicted with the beliefs of the Christian church, the [[Ethiopian Church]] banned the secular consumption of coffee until the reign of Emperor [[Menelik II]].<ref>{{cite book |first1=Richard |last1=Pankhurst |title=Economic History of Ethiopia |location=Addis Ababa |publisher=[[Addis Ababa University|Haile Selassie I University]] |year=1968 |page=198}}</ref> The beverage was also banned in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Turkey during the 17th century for political reasons<ref name="hopkins2006">{{cite web | url=http://accidentalhedonist.com/food-stories-the-sultans-coffee-prohibition/ | title=Food Stories: The Sultan's Coffee Prohibition | last=Hopkins | first=Kate | date=March 24, 2006 | work=Accidental Hedonist |accessdate=January 3, 2010}}<!-- doubtful WP:RS, but comments suggest it can be sourced to both "Devil's Cup" and "Devil's Picnic" --></ref> and was associated with rebellious political activities in Europe.

==Production==
A beverage or drink is a form of liquid which has been prepared for human consumption. This can include a number of different steps, some prior to transport, others immediately prior to consumption.

===Purification of water===
{{details|Water purification}}
Water is the chief constituent in all drinks, and the primary ingredient in most. Water is purified prior to [[drinking water|drinking]]. Methods for purification include [[filtration]] and the addition of chemicals, such as [[Water chlorination|chlorination]]. The importance of purified water is highlighted by the [[World Health Organisation]], who point out 94% of deaths from [[diarrhea]] - the third biggest cause of infectious death worldwide at 1.8 million annually - could be prevented by improving the quality of the victim's environment, particularly safe water.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/combating_diseasepart1lowres.pdf |format=PDF|publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |title=Combating Waterborne Diseases at the Household Level |page=11 |year=2007|isbn=978-92-4-159522-3}}</ref>

===Pasteurisation===
{{details|Pasteurisation}}
Pasteurisation is the process of heating a liquid to for a period of time at a specified temperature, then immediately cooling. The process reduces the growth of [[micro-organisms]] within the liquid, thereby increasing the time before spoilage. It is primarily used on [[milk]], which prior to pasteurisation is commonly infected with [[pathogen]]ic bacteria and therefore the more likely than any other part of the common diet in the developed world to cause illness.<ref name=wilson>{{Citation | last = Wilson | first = G. S. | title = The Pasteurization of Milk | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 1 | issue = 4286 | year = 1943 | pages = 261 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2282302/?page=1 | pmc=2282302 | pmid=20784713 | doi=10.1136/bmj.1.4286.261}}</ref>

===Juicing===
[[File:Pressoir epi.jpg|right|thumb|First developed in the Middle Ages, basket presses have a long history of use in winemaking.]]
{{details3|[[Juice]] and [[Pressing (wine)]]}}
The process of extracting juice from fruits and vegetables can take a number of forms. Simple crushing of most fruits will provide a significant amount of liquid, though a more intense pressure can be applied to get the maximum amount of juice from the fruit. Both crushing and pressing are processes used in the production of wine.

===Infusion===
{{details|Infusion}}
Infusion is the process of extracting flavours from plant material by allowing the material to remain suspended within water. This process is used in the production of [[tea]]s, [[herbal teas]] and can be used to prepare [[coffee]] (when using a [[french press|coffee press]]).

===Percolation===
{{details|Coffee percolation}}
The name is derived from the word "[[percolation|percolate]]" which means ''to cause (a solvent) to pass through a permeable substance especially for extracting a soluble constituent''.<ref>{{cite web|title=percolate|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/percolated|year=2008|publisher=Merriam Webster|accessdate=2008-01-09}}</ref>
In the case of coffee-brewing the solvent is water, the permeable substance is the coffee grounds, and the soluble constituents are the chemical compounds that give coffee its color, taste, aroma, and stimulating properties.

===Carbonation===
{{details|Carbonation}}
Carbonation is the process of dissolving [[Carbon Dioxide]] into a liquid, such as water.

===Fermentation===
{{details3|[[Fermentation]], [[Fermentation in winemaking]] and [[Beer]]}}

Fermentation is a [[metabolism|metabolic]] process that converts [[sugar]] to [[alcohol]]. Fermentation has been used by humans for the production of beverages since the [[Neolithic age]]. In [[winemaking]], grape juice is combined with yeast in an [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] environment to allow the fermentation.<ref name="cox">Jeff Cox ''"From Vines to Wines: The Complete Guide to Growing Grapes and Making Your Own Wine"'' pgs 133–136 Storey Publishing 1999 ISBN 1-58017-105-2</ref> The amount of sugar in the wine and the length of time given for fermentation determine the alcohol level and the [[sweetness of wine|sweetness of the wine]].<ref name="Bird">D. Bird ''"Understanding Wine Technology"'' pg 67–73 DBQA Publishing 2005 ISBN 1-891267-91-4</ref>

When [[brewing]] beer, there are four primary ingredients - water, grain, yeast and hops. The grain is encouraged to [[germinate]] by soaking and drying in heat, a process known as [[malting]]. It is then milled before soaking again to create the sugars needed for fermentation. This process is known as [[mashing]]. Hops are added for flavouring, then the yeast is added to the mixture (now called [[wort]]) to start the fermentation process.<ref name="beer">{{cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yjLqQPU_DzYC&pg=PT197#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The Illustrated Guide to Brewing Beer|author= Matthew Schaefer |page=197|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc.|date= 15 Feb 2012 |accessdate=13 November 2012 |isbn= 9781616084639}}</ref>

===Distillation===
[[File:Liquor Still Frankfort 489226997.jpg|thumb|left|An old [[whiskey]] [[still]].]]
{{details3|[[Distillation]] and [[Distilled beverage]]}} 
Distillation is a method of [[separation process|separating]] [[mixture]]s based on differences in [[Volatility (physics)|volatility]] of components in a boiling liquid mixture. It is one of the methods used in the purification of water. It is also a method of producing spirits from milder alcoholic beverages.

===Mixing===
{{details|Cocktails}}
An [[alcoholic beverage|alcoholic]] [[mixed drink]] that contains two or more ingredients is referred to as a cocktail. Cocktails were originally a mixture of spirits, sugar, water, and [[bitters]].<ref>{{cite book
|title=How To Mix Drinks
|author=Thomas, Jerry

==Types of drink==

===Non-alcoholic drinks===
[[File:Ice water with lemon.jpg|thumb|Ice water with lemon]]
{{details|Non-alcoholic beverage}}
A non-alcoholic drink is one that contains little or no [[Ethanol|alcohol]]. This category includes [[low-alcohol beer]], non-alcoholic [[wine]], and [[apple cider]] if they contain less than 0.5% [[alcohol by volume]]. The term "soft drink" specifies the absence of alcohol in contrast to "hard drink" and "drink". The term "drink" is theoretically neutral, but often is used in a way that suggests alcoholic content. Beverages such as soda pop, [[sparkling water]], [[iced tea]], [[lemonade]], [[root beer]], [[fruit punch]], [[milk]], [[hot chocolate]], [[tea]], [[coffee]], [[milkshake]]s, and [[tap water]] and energy drinks are all soft drinks.

In many cultures of the world, especially the Western world, humans continue to consume dairy milk beyond infancy, using the milk of other animals (especially [[cattle]], [[goat]]s and [[sheep]]) as a beverage. Plant milk, a general term for any milk-like product that is derived from a plant source, also has a long history of consumption in various countries and cultures. The most popular varieties internationally are [[soy milk]], [[almond milk]], [[rice milk]] and [[coconut milk]].

====Tea====
[[File:Tea leaves steeping in a zhong čaj 05.jpg|thumb|left|[[Oolong tea]]]]
{{see also2|[[Tea]]|[[Herbal tea]]}}
Tea, the second most consumed drink in the world, is produced from infusing dried leaves of the ''camellia sinensis'' shrub, in boiling water.<ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=DJ2j_bX6WTUC|title=Tea: The Drink that Changed the World |author= Martin, Laura C. |publisher=Tuttle Publishing|year=2007|pages=7–8|ref=Martin|isbn=0804837244}}</ref> There are many ways in which tea is prepared for consumption: lemon or milk and sugar are among the most common additives worldwide. Other additions include butter and salt in [[Bhutan]], [[Nepal]], and [[Tibet]]; [[bubble tea|chewy tapioca balls]] in [[Taiwan]]; fresh ginger in [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]]; mint in [[North Africa]] and [[Senegalese tea culture|Senegal]]; cardamom in [[Central Asia]]; rum to make [[Jagertee]] in [[Central Europe]]; and coffee to make [[yuanyang (drink)|yuanyang]] in [[Hong Kong]]. Tea is also served differently from country to country: in [[China]] and [[Japan]] tiny cups are used to serve tea; in [[Thailand]] and the [[United States]] tea is often served cold (as "iced tea") or with a lot of sweetener; [[Indian people|Indian]]s boil tea with milk and a blend of spices as [[masala chai]]; tea is brewed with a [[samovar]] in [[Iran]], [[Kashmir]], [[Russia]] and [[Turkey]]; and in the Australian [[Outback]] it is traditionally brewed in a [[billycan]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Saberi|first=Helen|title=Tea: A Global History|publisher=Reaktion Books|year=2010|pages=7|isbn=1861898924|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mZ0TUWvE9qQC}}</ref>
Tea leaves can be processed in different ways resulting in a drink which appears and tastes different. Chinese yellow and green tea are steamed, roasted and dried; Oolong tea is semi-fermented and appears green-black and black teas are fully fermented<ref>{{cite book|last=Gibson|first=E.L.|author2=Rycroft, J.A.|others=Watson, R.; Martin, C.|title=Psychological and Physiological Consequences of Drinking Tea ''in Handbook of Behavior, Food and Nutrition''|editor=Victor R.

====Coffee====
[[File:A small cup of coffee.JPG|thumb|[[Coffee]]]]
{{main|Coffee}}
Coffee is a [[Drip brew|brewed]] [[beverage]] prepared from the roasted seeds of several species of an [[evergreen]] [[shrub]] of the [[genus]] ''[[Coffea]]''. The two most common sources of coffee beans are the highly regarded ''[[Coffea arabica]]'', and the "robusta" form of the hardier ''[[Coffea canephora]]''. Coffee plants are cultivated in [[List of countries by coffee production|more than 70 countries]]  Once ripe, coffee [[epigynous berries|"berries"]] are picked, processed, and dried to yield the seeds inside. The seeds are then roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor, before being ground and brewed to create coffee.

Coffee is slightly [[acidic]] (pH 5.0–5.1<ref>[http://www.thecoffeefaq.com/7health.html#coffeeacidic Coffee and Health]. Thecoffeefaq.com (2005-02-16). Retrieved on 2013-01-22.</ref>) and can have a stimulating effect on humans because of its [[caffeine]] content. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world.<ref name="Villanueva">

====Carbonated drinks====
{{see also2|[[Carbonation]]|[[Soft drink]]}}
Carbonated drinks refer to drinks which have carbon dioxide dissolved into them. This can happen naturally through fermenting and in natural water spas or artificially by the dissolution of carbon dioxide under pressure. The first commercially available artificially carbonated drink is believed to have been produced by Thomas Henry in the late 1770s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Steen|first=Dr. David|author2=Ashhurst, Philip.|title=Carbonated Soft Drinks: Formulation and Manufacture |publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2008|pages=1–2|isbn=1405171707|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LfphGPaZtzwC}}</ref>
Cola, orange, various roots, ginger, and lemon/lime are commonly used to create non-alcoholic carbonated drinks; sugars and preservatives may be added later.<ref name="SIVASANKAR">{{cite book|last=Sivasankar|first=B.|title=FOOD PROCESSING AND PRESERVATION|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|year=2002|pages=314|chapter=24|isbn=8120320867|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tbxGHBUY0BcC}}</ref>

====Juice and juice drinks====
{{Main|Juice}}
[[File:Oranges and orange juice.jpg|thumb|left|[[Orange (fruit)|Orange]] [[juice]] is usually served cold.]]
[[Fruit]] juice is a natural product that contains few or no additives. Citrus products such as [[orange juice]] and [[tangerine]] juice are familiar breakfast drinks, while [[grapefruit juice]], pineapple, apple, grape, lime, and lemon juice are also common. [[Coconut water]] is a highly nutritious and refreshing juice. Many kinds of berries are crushed; their juices are mixed with water and sometimes sweetened. Raspberry, blackberry and currants are popular juices drinks but the percentage of water also determines their nutritive value. Grape juice allowed to ferment produces [[wine]].

Fruits are highly perishable so the ability to extract juices and store them was of significant value. Some fruits are highly acidic and mixing them with water and sugars or honey was often necessary to make them palatable. Early storage of fruit juices was labor-intensive, requiring the crushing of the fruits and the mixing of the resulting pure juices with sugars before bottling.

Vegetable juices are usually served warm or cold. Different types of vegetables can be used to make vegetable juice such as [[carrot]]s, tomatoes, [[cucumber]]s, [[celery]] and many more. Some vegetable juices are mixed with some fruit juice to make the vegetable juice taste better. Many popular vegetable juices, particularly ones with high tomato content, are high in sodium, and therefore consumption of them for health must be carefully considered. Some vegetable juices provide the same health benefits as whole vegetables in terms of reducing risks of [[cardiovascular disease]] and [[cancer]].

===Alcoholic Drinks===
{{Main|Alcoholic beverage}}
An alcoholic beverage is a drink that contains [[ethanol]], commonly known as [[alcohol]] (although in [[chemistry]] the definition of "alcohol" includes many other compounds). [[Beer]] has been a part of human culture for 8,000 years.<ref>{{cite book |title=Origin and History of Beer and Brewing: From Prehistoric Times to the Beginning of Brewing Science and Technology |last=Arnold |first=John P |year=2005 |edition=Reprint |publisher=BeerBooks.com}}</ref>

In many countries, drinking [[alcoholic beverage]]s in a local [[Bar (establishment)|bar]] or [[pub]] is a cultural tradition.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Drinking Life: A Memoir |last=Hamill |first=Pete |year=1994 |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York|isbn= 978-0-316-34102-8}}</ref>

====Beer====
[[File:Aufseß Bier.JPG|thumb|Glasses and tankards of German beer]]
Beer is an [[alcoholic beverage]] produced by the [[Hydrolysis|saccharification]] of [[starch]] and [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]] of the resulting sugar. The starch and saccharification [[enzyme]]s are often derived from malted cereal grains, most commonly [[malt]]ed barley and malted wheat.<ref name="Barth 2014">Barth, Roger. ''The Chemistry of Beer: The Science in the Suds'', Wiley 2013: ISBN 978-1-118-67497-0.</ref> Most beer is also flavoured with [[hops]], which [[bittering agent|add bitterness]] and act as a natural [[preservative]], though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The preparation of beer is called [[brewing]]. Beer is the world's most widely consumed [[alcoholic beverage]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Volume of World Beer Production|work=European Beer Guide|url=http://www.europeanbeerguide.net/eustats.htm#production|accessdate=17 October 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061028165040/http://www.europeanbeerguide.net/eustats.htm|archivedate=28 October 2006 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref> and is the third-most popular drink overall, after [[Drinking water|water]] and [[tea]].<ref name="Nelson 2005">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=6xul0O_SI1MC&pg=PA1&dq=most+consumed+beverage|title=The Barbarian's Beverage: A History of Beer in Ancient Europe|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, Oxon|isbn=0-415-31121-7|page=1|accessdate=21 September 2010|last= Nelson|first=Max}}</ref> It is thought by some to be the oldest fermented beverage.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Alchemy of Culture: Intoxicants in Society|first=Richard|last=Rudgley|isbn=978-0-7141-1736-2|year=1993|page=411|url=http://books.google.com/?id=5baAAAAAMAAJ&q=The+Alchemy+of+Culture&dq=The+Alchemy+of+Culture|publisher=British Museum Press|location=London|accessdate=13 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Origin and History of Beer and Brewing: From Prehistoric Times to the Beginning of Brewing Science and Technology|first=John P|last=Arnold|isbn=0-9662084-1-2|year=2005|page=411|url=http://books.google.com/?id=O5CPAAAACAAJ&dq=Origin+and+History+of+Beer+and+Brewing|publisher=Reprint Edition by BeerBooks|location=Cleveland, Ohio|accessdate=13 January 2012}}</ref><ref>Joshua J.

====Cider====
Cider is a [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] [[alcoholic beverage]] made from [[fruit juice]], most commonly and traditionally [[apple juice]], but also the juice of [[peach]]es, [[pear]]s ("Perry" cider) or other fruit. Cider may be made from any variety of apple, but certain [[cultivar]]s grown solely for use in cider are known as [[cider apple]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Science of Cidermaking Part 1 - Introduction|url=http://cider.org.uk/part1.htm|first=Andrew|last=Lea|accessdate=2 November 2011}}</ref> The [[United Kingdom]] has the highest per capita consumption of cider, as well as the largest cider-producing companies in the world,<ref name="cideruk">{{cite web| url = http://www.cideruk.com/ | title = National Association of Cider Makers | accessdate = 2007-12-21}}</ref> {{As of|2006}}, the U.K. produces 600 million litres of cider each year (130 million imperial gallons).<ref>{{cite web| url= http://cideruk.com/media_centre/interesting_facts | publisher= National Association of Cider Makers | title= Interesting Facts | accessdate= 24 February 2009}}</ref>

====Wine====
{{double image|left|White Wine Glas.jpg|120|Red Wine Glass.jpg|128|[[Wine glass]]es of [[white wine]] and [[red wine]]|||}}
Wine is an [[alcoholic beverage]] made from [[fermentation (wine)|fermented]] [[grape]]s or other fruits. The natural chemical balance of grapes lets them ferment without the addition of [[sugar]]s, [[acid]]s, [[enzyme]]s, water, or other [[nutrient]]s.<ref>{{cite book |title=Vintage: The Story of Wine |last=Johnson |first=H. |year=1989 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |isbn=0-671-79182-6 |pages=11–6 }}</ref> [[Yeast in winemaking|Yeast consumes the sugars]] in the grapes and converts them into [[Ethanol|alcohol]] and [[carbon dioxide]]. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. The well-known variations result from the very complex interactions between the biochemical development of the fruit, reactions involved in fermentation, [[terroir]] and subsequent [[appellation]], along with human intervention in the overall process. The final product may contain tens of thousands of chemical compounds in amounts varying from a few percent to a few parts per billion.

Wines made from produce besides grapes are usually named after the product from which they are produced (for example, [[rice wine]], [[pomegranate]] wine, [[Apfelwein|apple wine]] and [[elderberry wine]]) and are generically called [[fruit wine]]. The term "wine" can also refer to starch-fermented or fortified beverages having higher alcohol content, such as [[barley wine]], [[huangjiu]], or [[sake]].

Wine has a rich history dating back thousands of years, with the earliest production so far discovered having occurred {{c.|6000}}&nbsp;BC in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].<ref name=archaeology96>{{cite journal |first=Mark |last=Berkowitz |title=World's Earliest Wine |url=http://www.archaeology.org/9609/newsbriefs/wine.html |publisher=Archaeological Institute of America |journal=Archaeology |volume=49 |issue=5 |year=1996 |accessdate=25 June 2008}}</ref><ref name=indie>{{cite news |first=David |last=Keys |title=Now that's what you call a real vintage: professor unearths 8,000-year-old wine |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20111005120059/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/now-thats-what-you-call-a-real-vintage-professor-unearths-8000yearold-wine-577863.html |work=[[The Independent]] |date=28 December 2003 |accessdate=20 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Cultures of The World Georgia|last1=Spilling |first1=Michael |last2=Wong |first2=Winnie |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-0-7614-3033-9 |page=128 |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> It had reached the [[Balkans]] by {{c.|4500}}&nbsp;BC and was consumed and celebrated in ancient [[ancient Greece and wine|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome and wine|Rome]].

From its earliest appearance in written records, wine has also played an important role in religion. [[Red wine]] was closely associated with [[blood]] by the [[ancient Egyptians]], who, according to [[Plutarch]], avoided its free consumption as late as the 7th-century BC [[Saite dynasty]], "thinking it to be the blood of those who had once battled against the gods".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/A.html | title = Isis & Osiris | publisher = University of Chicago}}</ref> The [[ancient Greek religion|Greek]] [[cult of Dionysus|cult]] and [[Dionysian Mysteries|mysteries]] of [[Dionysus]], carried on by the [[ancient Romans|Romans]] in their [[Bacchanalia]], were the origins of western [[theater]]. [[Judaism]] incorporates it in the [[Kiddush]] and [[Christianity]] in its [[Eucharist]], while alcohol consumption was forbidden in [[Islam]].

====Spirits====
[[File:Alkoholika.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Various bottles of spirits]]
The term spirit refers to a distilled beverage that contains no added sugar and has at least 20% [[alcohol by volume]] (ABV). Popular spirits include [[borovička]], [[brandy]], [[gin]], [[rum]], [[slivovitz]], [[tequila]], [[vodka]], and [[whisky]]. Brandy is a spirit created by distilling wine, whilst vodka may be distilled from any [[starch]]- or [[sugar]]-rich plant matter; most vodka today is produced from [[Cereal|grains]] such as [[sorghum]], [[maize|corn]], [[rye]] or [[wheat]].

==In culture==

===Places to drink===
[[File:Vincent Willem van Gogh - Cafe Terrace at Night (Yorck).jpg|thumb|''[[Cafe Terrace at Night]]'', September 1888, by [[Vincent van Gogh]].]]
Throughout history, people have come together in establishments to socialise whilst drinking. This includes cafés and [[coffeehouse]]s, focus on providing hot drinks as well as light snacks. Many coffee houses in the [[Middle East]], and in [[West Asia]]n immigrant districts in the [[Western world]], offer ''shisha'' (''nargile'' in Turkish and Greek), flavored tobacco smoked through a [[hookah]]. [[coffeehouse#Espresso bars|Espresso bars]], such as [[Starbucks]] and [[Costa Coffee]] are a type of coffeehouse that specialize in serving [[espresso]] and espresso-based drinks.

In China and Japan, the establishment would be a [[tea house]], were people would socialise whilst drinking tea. Chinese scholars have used the teahouse for places of sharing ideas.

Alcoholic drinks are served in [[drinking establishments]], which have different cultural connotations. For example, [[pub]]s are fundamental to the culture of [[British culture|Britain]],<ref name="EB">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482410/public-house Public House] Britannica.com; Subscription Required. Retrieved 3 July 2008.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insiders-scotland-guide.com/ScottishPubs.html |title=Scottish pubs |publisher=Insiders-scotland-guide.com |accessdate=4 November 2012}}</ref> [[Culture of Ireland#Food and drink|Ireland]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Cronin|first=Michael|author2=O'Connor, Barbara|title=Irish Tourism: image, culture, and identity |editor=Barbara O'Connor|publisher=Channel View Publications|year=2003|series=Tourism and Cultural Change|volume=1|page=83|isbn= 978-1-873150-53-5 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=mLkIW-c4dScC&pg=PA83&dq=%22Many+foreign+visitors+regard+Ireland%27s+pub+culture%22#v=onepage&q=%22Many%20foreign%20visitors%20regard%20Ireland%27s%20pub%20culture%22&f=false |accessdate=27 March 2011}}</ref> [[Australian culture|Australia]],<ref>[http://www.convictcreations.com/culture/drinking.htm Australian Drinking Culture] Convict Creations. Retrieved 24 April 2011.</ref> [[Atlantic Canada]], [[New England]], [[Metro Detroit]], [[South Africa]] and [[Culture of New Zealand|New Zealand]]. In many places, especially in villages, a pub can be the focal point of the community. The writings of [[Samuel Pepys]] describe the pub as the heart of England. Many pubs are controlled by breweries, so [[cask ale]] or [[keg beer]] may be a better value than wines and spirits.

In contrast, Types of bars range from seedy bars or nightclubs, sometimes termed "dive bars",<ref>Todd Dayton, {{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LpUSVjBPHRwC&pg=PT7&dq=the+ideal+dive&hl=en&ei=HcZITNrrE4HNjAeu5IDDDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=the%20ideal%20dive&f=false |title=''San Francisco's Best Dive Bars'', page 4 |publisher=Ig Publishing, 2009, ISBN 097031258X |accessdate=2010-07-22 }}</ref> to elegant places of entertainment for the elite. Bars provide [[Bar stool|stools]] or chairs that are placed at tables or counters for their patrons. The term "bar" is derived from the [[bar (counter)|specialized counter]] on which drinks are served. Some bars have entertainment on a stage, such as a live band, comedians, [[Go-Go dancing|go-go dancers]], or [[striptease|strippers]]. Patrons may sit or stand at the bar and be served by the [[bartender]], or they may sit at tables and be served by cocktail servers.

===Matching with food===
[[File:Champagne flute and bottle.jpg|thumb|left|Champagne flute and bottle]]
{{main|Wine and food matching}}
Food and drink are often paired together to enhance the taste experience. This primarily happens with wine and a culture has grown up around the process. Weight, flavors and textures can either be contrasted or complemented.<ref name="Oldman pg 219-235">M. Oldman ''"Oldman's Guide to Outsmarting Wine" pg 219-235 Penguin Books 2004 ISBN 0-14-200492-8</ref> In recent years, food magazines began to suggest particular wines with recipes and restaurants would offer multi-course dinners matched with a specific wine for each course.<ref name="MacNeil pg 83-88">K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 83-88 Workman Publishing 2001 ISBN 1-56305-434-5</ref>

===Presentation===
Different drinks have unique receptacles for their consumption. This is sometimes purely for presentations purposes, such as for cocktails. In other situations, the drinkware has practical application, such as coffee cups which are designed for insulation or [[snifter|brandy snifters]] which are designed to encourage evaporation but trap the aroma within the glass.

Many glasses include a stem, which allows the drinker to hold the glass without affecting the temperature of the drink. In champagne glasses, the bowl is designed to retain champagne's signature [[carbonation]], by reducing the [[surface area]] at the opening of the bowl. Historically, champagne has been served in a [[champagne coupe]], the shape of which allowed carbonation to dissipate even more rapidly than from a standard [[wine glass]].
