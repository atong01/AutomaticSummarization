<article title='Education_reform'><paragraph><bold>Education reform</bold><space/>is the name given to the goal of changing<space/><link><target>public education</target></link>. Historically, reforms have taken different forms because the motivations of reformers have differed. However, since the 1980s, education reform has been focused on changing the existing system from one focused on inputs to one focused on outputs (i.e., student achievement). In the United States, education reform acknowledges and encourages public education as the primary source of K-12 education for American youth. Education reformers desire to make public education into a market (in the form of an input-output system), where accountability creates high-stakes from curriculum standards tied to standardized tests.<extension extension_name='ref'>http://parentreolution.org/who-we-are/</extension><extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.dfer.org/about/principles/</extension><space/>As a result of this input-output system, equality has been conceptualized as an end point, which is often evidenced by an achievement gap among diverse populations.<extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.edtrust.org/issues/pre-k-12/closing-the-gaps</extension><space/>This conceptualization of education reform is based on the market-logic of competition. As a consequence, competition creates inequality which has continued to drive the market-logic of equality at an end point by reproduce the achievement gap among diverse youth. Overall, education reform has and continues to be used as a substitute for needed economic reforms in the United States.</paragraph><paragraph>The one constant for all forms of education reform includes the idea that small changes in education will have large social returns in citizen health, wealth and well-being. For example, a stated motivation has been to reduce cost to students and society. From ancient times until the 1800s, one goal was to reduce the expense of a<space/><link><target>Great Books#Program</target><part>classical education</part></link>. Ideally, classical education is undertaken with a highly educated full-time (extremely expensive) personal tutor.

Abstract, introspective answers to these questions can theoretically compress large amounts of facts into relatively few principles.

Some reformers incorporated several motivations, e.g.<space/><link><target>Maria Montessori</target></link>, who both &quot;educated for peace&quot; (a social goal), and to &quot;meet the needs of the child&quot; (A humanistic goal). In historic Prussia, an important motivation for the invention of<space/><link><target>Kindergarten</target></link><space/>was to foster national unity by teaching a national language while children were young enough that learning a language was easy.</paragraph><paragraph>Reform has taken many forms and directions. Throughout history and the present day, the meaning and methods of education have changed through debates over what content or experiences result in an educated individual or an educated society. Changes may be implemented by individual educators and/or by broad-based school organization and/or by curriculum changes with performance evaluations.</paragraph><heading level='2'>History</heading><heading level='3'>Early history</heading><heading level='4'>Classical times</heading><paragraph><link><target>Plato</target></link><space/>believed that children would never learn unless they wanted to learn.

Lancaster started as a poor<space/><link><target>Religious Society of Friends</target><part>Quaker</part></link><space/>in early 19th century London. Bell started the Madras School of India. The monitorial system uses slightly more-advanced students to teach less-advanced students, achieving student-teacher ratios as small as 2, while educating more than a thousand students per adult. Lancaster promoted his system in a piece called<space/><link type='external' href='http://www.constitution.org/lanc/improv-1803.htm'>Improvements in Education</link><space/>that spread widely throughout the English-speaking world.</paragraph><paragraph>Discipline and labor in a Lancaster school were provided by an economic system. Scrip, a form of money meaningless outside the school, was created at a fixed exchange rate from a student's tuition. Every job of the school was bid-for by students in scrip, with the largest bid winning. However,<space/><italics>any</italics><space/>student tutor could auction positions in his or her classes. Besides tutoring, students could use scrip to buy food, school supplies, books, and childish luxuries in a school store. The adult supervisors were paid from the bids on jobs.</paragraph><paragraph>With fully developed internal economies, Lancaster schools provided a grammar-school education for a cost per student near $40 per year in 1999 U.S. dollars. The students were very clever at reducing their costs, and once invented, improvements were widely adopted in a school. For example, Lancaster students, motivated to save scrip, ultimately rented individual pages of textbooks from the school library, and read them in groups around music stands to reduce textbook costs. Students commonly exchanged tutoring, and paid for items and services with receipts from &quot;down tutoring.&quot;</paragraph><paragraph>Lancaster schools usually lacked sufficient adult supervision. As a result, the older children acting as disciplinary monitors tended to become brutal task masters. Also, the schools did not teach submission to orthodox Christian beliefs or government authorities. As a result, most English-speaking countries developed mandatory publicly paid education explicitly to keep public education in &quot;responsible&quot; hands. These elites said that Lancaster schools might become dishonest, provide poor education and were not accountable to established authorities.</paragraph><paragraph>Lancaster's supporters responded that any schoolchild could avoid cheats, given the opportunity, and that the government was not paying for the education, and thus deserved no say in their composition.</paragraph><paragraph>Lancaster, though motivated by charity, claimed in his pamphlets to be surprised to find that he lived well on the income of his school, even while the low costs made it available to the poorest street-children.Ironically, Lancaster lived on the charity of friends in his later life.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.k12academics.com/education-reform/educational-economies-1800s'>Educational Economies in the 1800s K12 Academics</link></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Progressive reforms in Europe and the United States</heading><paragraph>The term<space/><italics>progressive</italics><space/>in education has been used somewhat indiscriminately; there are a number of kinds of<space/><link><target>educational progressivism</target></link>, most of the historically significant kinds peaking in the period between the late 19th and the middle of the 20th centuries.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Child-study</heading><paragraph><link><target>Image:Rousseau.jpg</target><part>right</part><part>thumb</part><part>190px</part><part>Jean-Jacques Rousseau</part></link><link><target>Jean-Jacques Rousseau</target></link><space/>has been called the father of the child-study movement.

He advocated a radical withdrawal of the child from society and an educational process that utilized the natural potential of the child and its curiosity, teaching it by confronting it with simulated real-life obstacles and conditioning it by experience rather than teaching it intellectually.

A wide class of temperaments (&quot;Sensors&quot;, half by category, 60% of the general population) prefer to use concrete information such as facts and procedures. They prefer not to use abstract theories or logic. In terms of education, some authorities interpret this to mean that 60% of the general population only use, and therefore would prefer to learn answers to concrete &quot;Who, what, when, where&quot;, and &quot;how&quot; questions, rather than answers to the theoretical &quot;which&quot; and &quot;why&quot; questions advocated by progressives. This information was confirmed (on another research track) by Jean Piaget, who discovered that nearly 60% of adults never habitually use what he called &quot;<link><target>Formal Operational stage</target><part>formal operational reasoning</part></link>&quot;, a term for the development and use of theories and explicit logic. If this criticism is true, then schools that teach only<space/><italics>principles</italics><space/>would fail to educate 60% of the general population.</paragraph><paragraph>The data from Piaget, Myers and Briggs can also be used to criticize classical teaching styles that<space/><italics>never</italics><space/>teach theory or principle. In particular, a wide class of temperaments (&quot;Intuitives&quot;, half by category, 40% of the general population) prefer to reason from trusted first principles, and then apply that theory to predict concrete facts. In terms of education, some authorities interpret this to mean that 40% of the general population prefer to use, and therefore want to learn, answers to theoretical &quot;Which and &quot;Why&quot; questions, rather than answers to the concrete &quot;Who, what, when, where&quot; and &quot;How&quot; questions.</paragraph><paragraph>The synthesis resulting from this two-part critique is a &quot;neoclassical&quot; learning theory similar to that practiced by<space/><link><target>Marva Collins</target></link>, in which both learning styles are accommodated.

It was argued that the associated increases in inequity and greater racial stratification in schools nullified the educational gains. Others, however, argued that the original system created more inequity (due to lower income students being required to attend poorer performing inner city schools and not being allowed school choice or better educations that are available to higher income inhabitants of suburbs). Instead, it was argued that the school choice promoted social mobility and increased test scores especially in the cases of low income students. Similar results have been found in other jurisdictions. Though discouraging, the merely slight improvements of some school choice policies often seems to reflect weaknesses in the way that choice is implemented rather than a failure of the basic principle itself.<extension extension_name='ref'>Whelan, Lessons Learned: How good policies produce better schools (2009).

In both cases some researchers have concluded these correlations as representing an underlying causal relationship: education causes socio-economic benefits. In the case of Iran, researchers concluded that the improvements were due to farmers gaining reliable access to national crop prices and scientific farming information.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Strategies</heading><paragraph>Reforms can be based on bringing education into alignment with a society's core values.<extension extension_name='ref' name="School1970"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="author">Sudbury Valley School</arg><arg name="title">The crisis in American education: an analysis and a proposal</arg><arg name="url">http://books.google.com/books?id</arg><arg name="accessdate">30 May 2013</arg><arg name="date">1 January 1970</arg><arg name="publisher">The Sudbury Valley School</arg><arg name="isbn">978-1-888947-05-2</arg><arg name="chapter">The American Dream</arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="Gutmann1999"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="author">Amy Gutmann</arg><arg name="title">Democratic Education</arg><arg name="url">http://books.google.com/books?id</arg><arg name="accessdate">30 May 2013</arg><arg name="date">29 March 1999</arg><arg name="publisher">Princeton University Press</arg><arg name="isbn">978-1-4008-2291-1</arg></template></extension><space/>Reforms that attempt to change a society's core values can connect alternative education initiatives with a network of other alternative institutions.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="author">Paula Polk Lillard</arg><arg name="title">Montessori Today: A Comprehensive Approach to Education from Birth to Adulthood</arg><arg name="url">http://books.google.com/books?id</arg><arg name="accessdate">30 May 2013</arg><arg name="date">7 September 2011</arg><arg name="publisher">Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group</arg><arg name="isbn">978-0-307-76132-3</arg><arg name="page">22</arg></template>, quoted in<space/><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="author">Mitchell Stevens</arg><arg name="title">Kingdom of Children: Culture and Controversy in the Homeschooling Movement</arg><arg name="url">http://books.google.com/books?id</arg><arg name="accessdate">30 May 2013</arg><arg name="date">9 February 2009</arg><arg name="publisher">Princeton University Press</arg><arg name="isbn">978-1-4008-2480-9</arg><arg name="page">183</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Digital Education</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Electronic learning</arg></template>The movement to use computers more in education naturally includes many unrelated ideas, methods, and pedagogies since there are many uses for digital computers. For example, the fact that computers are naturally good at math leads to the question of the use of calculators in math education. The Internet's communication capabilities make it potentially useful for collaboration, and foreign language learning. The computer's ability to simulate physical systems makes it potentially useful in teaching science. More often, however, debate of digital education reform centers around more general applications of computers to education, such as electronic test-taking and online classes.</paragraph><paragraph>The idea of creating<space/><link><target>artificial intelligence</target></link><space/>led some computer scientists to believe that teachers could be replaced by computers, through something like an<space/><link><target>expert system</target></link>; however, attempts to accomplish this have predictably proved inflexible. The computer is now more understood to be a tool or assistant for the teacher and students.</paragraph><paragraph>Harnessing the richness of the Internet is another goal. In some cases classrooms have been moved entirely online, while in other instances the goal is more to learn how the Internet can be more than a classroom.</paragraph><paragraph>Web-based international educational software is under development by students at New York University, based on the belief that current educational institutions are too rigid: effective teaching is not routine, students are not passive, and questions of practice are not predictable or standardized. The software allows for courses tailored to an individual's abilities through frequent and automatic<space/><link><target>multiple intelligences</target></link><space/>assessments. Ultimate goals include assisting students to be intrinsically motivated to educate themselves, and aiding the student in self-actualization. Courses typically taught only in college are being reformatted so that they can be taught to any level of student, whereby elementary school students may learn the foundations of any topic they desire. Such a program has the potential to remove the bureaucratic inefficiencies of education in modern countries, and with the decreasing digital divide, help developing nations rapidly achieve a similar quality of education. With an open format similar to Wikipedia, any teacher may upload their courses online and a feedback system will help students choose relevant courses of the highest quality. Teachers can provide links in their digital courses to webcast videos of their lectures. Students will have personal academic profiles and a forum will allow students to pose complex questions, while simpler questions will be automatically answered by the software, which will bring you to a solution by searching through the knowledge database, which includes all available courses and topics.</paragraph><paragraph>The 21st century ushered in the acceptance and encouragement of internet research conducted on college and university campuses, in homes, and even in gathering areas of shopping centers. Addition of cyber cafes on campuses and coffee shops, loaning of communication devices from libraries, and availability of more portable technology devices, opened up a world of educational resources. Availability of knowledge to the elite had always been obvious, yet provision of networking devices, even wireless gadget sign-outs from libraries, made availability of information an expectation of most persons.<space/><link><target>Cassandra B. Whyte</target></link><space/>researched the future of computer use on higher education campuses focusing on student affairs. Though at first seen as a data collection and outcome reporting tool, the use of computer technology in the classrooms, meeting areas, and homes continued to unfold. The sole dependence on paper resources for subject information diminished and e-books and articles, as well as on-line courses, were anticipated to become increasingly staple and affordable choices provided by higher education institutions according to Whyte in a 2002 presentation.<extension extension_name='ref'>Whyte, Cassandra Bolyard.

Education on the whole, as a stand-alone entity, has been slow to embrace these changes. The use of web tools such as wikis, blogs, and social networking sites is tied to increasing overall effectiveness of digital education in schools. Examples exist of teacher and student success stories where learning has transcended the classroom and has reached far out into society.<extension extension_name='ref' name="autogenerated1">Richardson, Will. 2010.

Media is in direct competition with formal educational institutions in shaping the minds of today and those of tomorrow.

As time presses on, new technologies will continue to break paradigms that will reshape human thinking regarding technological innovation. This concept stresses a certain disconnect between teachers and learners and the growing chasm that started some time ago. Richardson asserts that traditional classrooms will essentially enter entropy unless teachers increase their comfort and proficiency with technology.<extension extension_name='ref' name="autogenerated1"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Administrators are not exempt from the technological disconnect. They must recognize the existence of a younger generation of teachers who were born during the Digital Age and are very comfortable with technology.

The evidence of Lancaster schools suggests using students as teachers. If the culture supports it, perhaps the economic discipline of the Lancaster school can reduce costs even further. However, much of the success of Lancaster's &quot;school economy&quot; was that the children were natives of an intensely mercantile culture.</paragraph><paragraph>In order to be effective, classroom instruction needs to change subjects at times near a typical student's attention span, which can be as frequently as every two minutes for young children.

Many developmental psychologists say that it might be socially profitable to test for and target temperaments with special curricula.</paragraph><paragraph>Some of the Myers-Briggs temperaments are known to despise educational material that lacks theory.
