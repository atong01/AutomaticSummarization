'''Cytosine''' {{IPAc-en|'|s|ai|t|o-|s|i-|n}} ('''C''') is one of the four main bases found in [[DNA]] and [[RNA]], along with [[adenine]], [[guanine]], and [[thymine]] ([[uracil]] in RNA). It is a [[pyrimidine]] derivative, with a [[heterocyclic]] [[aromatic ring]] and two substituents attached (an [[amine]] group at position 4 and a [[Ketone|keto]] group at position 2). The [[nucleoside]] of cytosine is [[cytidine]].  In Watson-Crick [[base pair]]ing, it forms three hydrogen bonds with [[guanine]].

==History==
Cytosine was discovered and named by [[Albrecht Kossel]] and Albert Neumann in 1894 when it was hydrolyzed from calf [[thymus]] tissues.<ref>A. Kossel and Albert Neumann (1894) [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k90735d/f437.image.langEN "Darstellung und Spaltungsprodukte der Nucleïnsäure (Adenylsäure)"] (Preparation and cleavage products of nucleic acids (adenic acid)), ''Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft zu Berlin'', '''27''' :  2215-2222.  The name "cytosine" is coined on page 2219:  ''" … ein Produkt von basischen Eigenschaften, für welches wir den Namen "Cytosin" vorschlagen."'' ( … a product with basic properties, for which we suggest the name "cytosine".)</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Kossel, A.; Steudel, H. Z. | journal = Physiol.

Cytosine recently found use in [[quantum computation]]. The first time any [[quantum]] mechanical properties were harnessed to process [[information]] took place on August 1 in 1998 when researchers at Oxford implemented [[David Deutsch|David Deutsch's]] [[Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm|algorithm]] on a two [[qubit]] [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] quantum computer (NMRQC) based on cytosine.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Jones | first = J.A. |author2=M.

In March 2015, NASA scientists reported that, for the first time, complex [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] [[organic compound]]s of [[life]], including [[uracil]], cytosine and [[thymine]], have been formed in the laboratory under [[outer space]] conditions, using starting chemicals, such as [[pyrimidine]], found in [[meteorite]]s. Pyrimidine, like [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs), the most carbon-rich chemical found in the [[Universe]], may have been formed in [[red giant]]s or in [[Cosmic dust|interstellar dust]] and gas clouds, according to the scientists.<ref name="NASA-20150303">{{cite web |last=Marlaire |first=Ruth |title=NASA Ames Reproduces the Building Blocks of Life in Laboratory |url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-ames-reproduces-the-building-blocks-of-life-in-laboratory |date=3 March 2015 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=5 March 2015 }}</ref>

==Chemical reactions==
[[File:Cytosine chemical structure.svg|thumb|left|100px|Cytosine with numbered components. [[Methylation]] occurs on carbon nr 5.]]
Cytosine can be found as part of DNA, as part of RNA, or as a part of a [[nucleotide]]. As [[cytidine triphosphate]] (CTP), it can act as a co-factor to enzymes, and can transfer a phosphate to convert [[adenosine diphosphate]] (ADP) to [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP).

In DNA and RNA, cytosine is paired with [[guanine]]. However, it is inherently unstable, and can change into [[uracil]] ([[deamination|spontaneous deamination]]). This can lead to a [[point mutation]] if not repaired by the [[DNA repair]] [[enzyme]]s such as uracil glycosylase, which cleaves a uracil in DNA. 

When found third in a [[codon]] of [[RNA]], cytosine is synonymous with [[uracil]], as they are interchangeable as the third base.
When found as the second base in a codon, the third is always interchangeable. For example, UCU, UCC, UCA and UCG are all [[serine]], regardless of the third base. 

Cytosine can also be [[Methylation|methylated]] into [[5-Methylcytosine|5-methylcytosine]] by an enzyme called [[DNA methyltransferase]] or be methylated and [[Hydroxylation|hydroxylated]] to make [[5-Hydroxymethylcytosine|5-hydroxymethylcytosine]].
Active enzymatic deamination of cytosine or 5-methylcytosine by the [[APOBEC]] family of cytosine deaminases could have both beneficial and detrimental implications on various cellular processes as well as on organismal evolution.<ref name="Chahwan">{{cite journal| author= Chahwan R., Wontakal S.N., and Roa S.| title=Crosstalk between genetic and epigenetic information through cytosine deamination| journal=Trends in Genetics| volume = 26| pages = 443–448| year = 2010 | doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2010.07.005| pmid = 20800313| issue = 10}}</ref> The implications of deamination on 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, on the other hand, remains less understood.
