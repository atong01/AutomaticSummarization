The '''ColecoVision''' is [[Coleco|Coleco Industries]]' [[History of video game consoles (second generation)|second-generation]] [[home video game console|home video-game console]] which was released in August 1982. The ColecoVision offered near-[[arcade game|arcade-quality]] graphics and gaming style along with the means to expand the system's basic hardware. Released with a catalog of 12 [[launch title]]s, with an additional 10 games announced for 1982, approximately 145 titles in total were published as [[ROM cartridge]]s for the system between 1982 and 1984.<ref>{{Citation |last=Forster |first=Winnie |authorlink=Winnie Forster |title=The encyclopedia of consoles, handhelds & home computers 1972 - 2005 |year=2005 |publisher=GAMEPLAN |isbn=3-00-015359-4|page=50}}</ref> River West Brands currently owns the ColecoVision brand name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riverwestbrands.com/news/RiverWest_Underalls_Announcement.pdf |title=Press release for River West Brands |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-12-20}}</ref>

In 2009, [[IGN]] named the ColecoVision their 12th-best video-game console out of their list of 25, citing "its incredible accuracy in bringing current-generation arcade hits home."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/top-25-consoles/12.html |title=Colecovision is number 12 |publisher=IGN |date= |accessdate=2010-12-20}}</ref>

== History ==

Coleco licensed [[Nintendo]]'s ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' as the official pack-in cartridge for all ColecoVision consoles, helping to boost the console's popularity. By Christmas of 1982, Coleco had sold more than 500,000 units,<ref>{{Citation | journal=Business Week | title=Coleco hits with home video games | page=31 | date=1983-01-24 | quote=Most of 1982's action was in the second half, when Coleco shipped 550,000 ColecoVision game machines--which sell for $169 to $189--booking orders for nearly that many more.}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | publisher=Associated Press | title=Video Game Maker Says 1st-Quarter Profit More Than Tripled | date=1983-04-20 | quote=Arnold C.

One Donkey Kong cartridge comes with each Colecovision unit.}}</ref> The ColecoVision's main competitor was the arguably more advanced but less commercially successful [[Atari 5200]].<ref>{{Citation | journal=Christian Science Monitor | title=Zap!

Video games sparkle in holiday market | last=Aeppel | first=Timothy | page=7 | date=1982-12-10 | quote=In recent weeks, two particularly hot-selling systems have emerged - the Atari 5200 and ColecoVision.

The ColecoVision was distributed by [[CBS Electronics]] outside of [[North America]], and was branded the '''CBS ColecoVision'''.

Sales quickly passed 1 million in early 1983,<ref>Video Game Maker Says 1st-Quarter Profit More Than Tripled, 1983-04-20</ref> before the [[video game crash of 1983]]. By the beginning of 1984, quarterly sales of the ColecoVision had dramatically decreased.<ref name="coleco_report">{{Citation | publisher=PR Newswire | title=Coleco Industries sales report | date=1984-04-17 | quote='First quarter sales of ColecoVision were substantial, although much less {{sic|that}} those for the year ago quarter,' Greenberg said in a prepared statement.

Over the next 18 months, the Coleco company ramped down its video game division, ultimately withdrawing from the video game market by the end of the summer of 1985.<ref>{{Citation | journal=New York Times | publisher=Reuters | title=Coleco Reassesses Its Video Games | page=4 (Section D) | date=1985-06-13 | quote=Coleco Industries is assessing its continuing commitment to the video game business...Arnold C.

The company's chairman, Arnold Greenberg, said Coleco expects no more charges against earnings from the two discontinued products.}}</ref> Total sales of the ColecoVision are uncertain but were ultimately in excess of 2 million units, as sales had reached that number by the spring of 1984,<ref name="coleco_report"/> while the console continued to sell modestly up until its discontinuation the following year.<ref>{{Citation | journal=New York Times | last=Kleinfield | first=N.

In 1983 [[Spectravideo]] announced the SV-603 ColecoVision Video Game Adapter for its [[SV-318]] computer. The company stated that the $70 product allowed users to "enjoy the entire library of exciting ColecoVision video-game cartridges".<ref name="softline198303">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1983&pub=6&id=10 | title=Heavy Hardware | work=Softline | date=March 1983 | accessdate=28 July 2014 | pages=46}}</ref> In 1986, [[Bit Corporation]] produced a ColecoVision clone called the [[Dina (video game console)|Dina]], which was sold in the United States by Telegames as the [[Telegames Personal Arcade]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=ConsoleMuseum.Detail&id=24 |title=ColecoVision - 1982-1984 - Classic Gaming |publisher=Classicgaming.gamespy.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-20}}</ref>

== Hardware ==
[[File:ColecoVision-Controller-FR.jpg|thumb|left|The ColecoVision's controller featured a numberpad that could be fitted with overlays.]]
The main console unit consists of a 14×8×2&nbsp;inch rectangular plastic case that houses the motherboard, with a cartridge slot on the right side and connectors for the external [[power supply]] and [[RF connector|RF jack]] at the rear. The [[game controller|controller]]s connect into plugs in a recessed area on the top of the unit.

The design of the controllers is similar to that of [[Mattel]]'s [[Intellivision]]—the controller is rectangular and consists of a numeric keypad and a set of side buttons. In place of the circular control disc below the keypad, the Coleco controller has a short, 1.5-inch [[joystick]]. The keypad is designed to accept a thin plastic overlay that maps the keys for a particular game. Each ColecoVision console shipped with two controllers.

All first-party cartridges and most third-party software titles feature a 12-second pause before presenting the game select screen.<ref name="eg198306">{{cite news | url=http://www.archive.org/stream/electronic-games-magazine-1983-06/Electronic_Games_Issue_16_Vol_02_04_1983_Jun#page/n109/mode/2up | title=Q&A | work=Electronic Games | date=June 1983 | accessdate=7 January 2015 | author=The Game Doctor | pages=112}}</ref> This delay results from an intentional loop in the console's [[BIOS]] to enable on-screen display of the ColecoVision brand. Companies like [[Parker Brothers]], [[Activision]], and [[Micro Fun]] bypassed this loop, which necessitated embedding portions of the BIOS outside the delay loop, further reducing storage available to actual game programming.

=== Expansion Modules and accessories ===
From its introduction, Coleco touted the ColecoVision's hardware expandability by highlighting the ''Expansion Module Interface'' on the front of the unit.  These hardware expansion modules and accessories were sold separately.

==== Released ====
[[File:ColecoVision-ExpMod1-Attached.jpg|thumb|right|The Expansion Module #1 allowed the ColecoVision to play any game from the [[Atari 2600]].]]
# '''[[Shanzhai]] Expansion Module #1''' makes the ColecoVision compatible with the industry-leading [[Atari 2600]], with some exceptions.<ref name="eg198306">{{cite news | url=http://www.archive.org/stream/electronic-games-magazine-1983-06/Electronic_Games_Issue_16_Vol_02_04_1983_Jun#page/n109/mode/2up | title=Q&A | work=Electronic Games | date=June 1983 | accessdate=7 January 2015 | author=The Game Doctor | pages=112}}</ref> Functionally, this gave the ColecoVision the largest software library of any console of its day. The expansion module prompted legal action from Atari, but Atari was unable to stop sales of the module because the 2600 could be reproduced with off the shelf parts. Coleco also designed and sold the [[Coleco Gemini|Gemini game system]], which was a clone of the 2600, but with combined joystick/paddle controllers.
# '''Expansion Module #2''' is a driving controller ([[steering wheel]] / gas pedal) that came packaged with a port of the arcade game ''[[Turbo (video game)|Turbo]]''. The gas pedal is merely a simple on/off switch, so many games used the second ColecoVision controller as a gear shift for more precise speed control.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-liberator.net/site-files/retro-games/hardware/ColecoVision/colecovision-expansion-moduel-no-2-driving-controller.htm |title=Coleco ColecoVision Expansion Module No. 2 Driving Controller Disassembled |publisher=The-liberator.net |date= |accessdate=2014-05-27}}</ref> Although Coleco called the driving controller an expansion module, it actually plugs into the controller port, not the ''Expansion Module Interface''.<ref>http://www.colecovisionzone.com/photos/accessory/module2%20manual.pdf</ref> The driving controller is also compatible with the games ''Destructor'', ''Bump n Jump'', and ''Dukes Of Hazzard''.
# '''Expansion Module #3''' converts the ColecoVision into a full-fledged computer known as the [[Coleco Adam|Adam]], complete with keyboard, digital data pack (DDP) cassette drives and printer.
# The '''Roller Controller''' is a [[trackball]] that came packaged with a port of the arcade game ''[[Slither (video game)|Slither]]'', a ''[[Centipede (arcade game)|Centipede]]'' clone.<ref name="eg198306">{{cite news | url=http://www.archive.org/stream/electronic-games-magazine-1983-06/Electronic_Games_Issue_16_Vol_02_04_1983_Jun#page/n23/mode/2up | title=Controller Update: Probing the World of the Exotic | work=Electronic Games | date=June 1983 | accessdate=6 January 2015 | pages=24–28}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media |people= |year=2008 |title=Classic Game Room reviews COLECOVISION ROLLER CONTROLLER |trans_title= |medium=YouTube |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLnkQlMaQ1U |accessdate=April 2, 2014 |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format=YouTube |time=4:45 |location= |publisher=Lord Karnage |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}</ref>  The roller controller uses a special power connector which is not compatible with Expansion Module #3 (the Adam computer). Coleco mailed an adapter to owners of both units who complained.<ref>http://www.colecovisionzone.com/photos/accessory/roller%20manual.pdf</ref> The roller controller is also compatible with the games ''Victory'', ''Omega Race'', and ''[[Wargames (game)|Wargames]]'', and was also compatible with Atarisoft's port of  ''Centipede'', which used a trackball for arcade play.
# The '''Super Action Controller Set''' is a set of two joysticks (each resembling a boxing glove) that came packaged with the game ''Super Action Baseball''. Each joystick has four action buttons, a 12-button numeric keypad, and a "speed roller".<ref>http://www.colecovisionzone.com/photos/accessory/superaction%20manual.pdf</ref> The Super Action Controllers are also compatible with the games ''Super Action Football'', ''[[Rocky]]'' ''Super Action Boxing'', and a port of the arcade game ''[[Front Line (arcade game)|Front Line]]''.
