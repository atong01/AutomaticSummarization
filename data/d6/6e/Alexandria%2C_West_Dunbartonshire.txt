'''Alexandria''' ({{lang-sco|The Vale}},<ref name=lang>[http://newsnetscotland.com/index.php/component/content/article/2999-list-of-railway-station-names.html List of railway station names in English, Scots and Gaelic]</ref> {{lang-gd|Am Magh Leamhna}}<ref name=lang></ref>) is a town in [[West Dunbartonshire]], [[Scotland]].

==Economy==
The town's traditional industries, most importantly cotton manufacturing, bleaching and printing, have been phased out. The town was redeveloped in the 1970s with a new town centre layout and traffic system. Local landmarks include Christie Park, and the Fountain in the town centre. Lomond Galleries on North Main Street is a former car factory with an impressive dome and an even more impressive marble entrance hall and staircase. It was originally built in 1906 as the [[Argyll Motor Works]], for [[Argyll (car)|Argyll Motors Ltd]]. A carving above the entrance shows one of the company's cars. After the car production ceased in 1914 it was used by the [[Admiralty]] for the manufacture of [[torpedo]]es, which were test-fired in [[Loch Long]], and in the early 1970s was the scene of the [[Plessey]] sit-in.<ref name=wdc>{{cite web |url=http://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/tourism-and-visitor-attractions/museums-and-galleries/collections/industry/argyll-motor-works/ |title=Argyll Works |publisher=West Dunbartonshire Council |accessdate=28 August 2013}}</ref>
