In 1717, the<space/><link><target>Viceroyalty of New Granada</target></link><space/>was originally created, and then it was temporarily removed, to finally be reestablished in 1739. The Viceroyalty had Santa F de Bogot as its capital.

Although the Bogot junta called itself a &quot;Supreme Junta of the New Kingdom of Granada,&quot; it failed to provide political unity, and battles broke out between cities and towns as each tried to defend its sovereignty. There were two fruitless attempts at establishing a congress of provinces in the subsequent months.</paragraph><paragraph>By March 1811 the province of Bogot had transformed itself into a state called<space/><link><target>Free and Independent State of Cundinamarca</target><part>Cundinamarca</part></link>.

Bolvar's supporters, who later formed the nucleus of the Conservative Party, sought strong centralized government, alliance with the<space/><link><target>Roman Catholic Church</target></link>, and a limited franchise. Santander's followers, forerunners of the Liberals, wanted a decentralized government, state rather than church control over education and other civil matters, and a broadened suffrage.</paragraph><paragraph>Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, each party held the presidency for roughly equal periods of time. Colombia maintained a tradition of civilian government and regular, free elections. The military has seized power three times in Colombia's history: in 1830, after the dissolution of Great Colombia; again in 1854 (by General<space/><link><target>Jos Mara Melo</target></link>); and from 1953 to 1957 (under General<space/><link><target>Gustavo Rojas Pinilla</target></link>). Civilian rule was restored within one year in the first two instances.</paragraph><paragraph>Not withstanding the country's commitment to democratic institutions, Colombia's history has also been characterized by widespread, violent conflict. Two civil wars resulted from bitter rivalry between the Conservative and Liberal parties.<space/><link><target>Thousand Days War</target></link><space/>(18991902) cost an estimated 100,000 lives, and up to 300,000 people died during &quot;<link><target>La Violencia</target></link>&quot; (The Violence) of the late 1940s and 1950s, a bipartisan confrontation which erupted after the assassination of Liberal popular candidate<space/><link><target>Jorge Elicer Gaitn</target></link>.<space/><link><target>United States</target></link><space/>activity to influence the area (especially the<space/><link><target>Panama Canal</target></link><space/>construction and control) led to a military uprising in the province of Panama in 1903, which resulted in the establishment of it as a nation.</paragraph><paragraph>A military coup in 1953 toppled the right-wing government of Conservative<space/><link><target>Laureano Gmez</target></link><space/>and brought General<space/><link><target>Gustavo Rojas Pinilla</target><part>Gustavo Rojas</part></link><space/>to power. Initially, Rojas enjoyed considerable popular support, due largely to his success in reducing &quot;<link><target>La Violencia</target></link>&quot;. When he did not restore democratic rule and occasionally engaged in open repression, however, he was overthrown by the military in 1957 with the backing of both political parties, and a provisional government was installed.</paragraph><heading level='2'>The National Front regime (19581974)</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>National Front (Colombia)</arg></template>In July 1957, former Conservative President Laureano Gmez (19501953) and former Liberal President<space/><link><target>Alberto Lleras Camargo</target><part>Alberto Lleras</part></link><space/>(19451946, 19581962) issued the &quot;Declaration of Sitges,&quot; in which they proposed a &quot;National Front,&quot; whereby the Liberal and Conservative parties would govern jointly. The presidency would be determined by an alternating conservative and liberal president every 4 years for 16 years; the two parties would have parity in all other elective offices.</paragraph><paragraph>The National Front ended &quot;<link><target>La Violencia</target></link>&quot;, and National Front administrations attempted to institute far-reaching social and economic reforms in cooperation with the Alliance for Progress. In particular, the Liberal president<space/><link><target>Alberto Lleras Camargo</target></link><space/>(19581962) created the<space/><link><target>Colombian Institute for Agrarian Reform</target></link><space/>(INCORA), and<space/><link><target>Carlos Lleras Restrepo</target></link><space/>(19661970) further developed land entitlement. In 1968 and 1969 alone, the INCORA issued more than 60,000 land titles to farmers and workers.</paragraph><paragraph>In the end, the contradictions between each successive Liberal and Conservative administration made the results decidedly mixed. Despite the progress in certain sectors, many social and political injustices continued.</paragraph><paragraph>The National Front system itself eventually began to be seen as a form of political repression by dissidents and even many mainstream voters, especially after what was apparently later confirmed as the fraudulent election of<space/><link><target>Colombian Conservative Party</target><part>Conservative</part></link><space/>candidate<space/><link><target>Misael Pastrana Borrero</target><part>Misael Pastrana</part></link><space/>in 1970, which resulted in the defeat of the relatively populist candidate<space/><link><target>Gustavo Rojas Pinilla</target><part>Gustavo Rojas</part></link>. The<space/><link><target>19th of April Movement</target><part>M-19</part></link><space/>guerrilla movement, &quot;Movimiento 19 de Abril&quot; (19 April Movement), would eventually be founded in part as a response to this particular event. The<space/><link><target>FARC</target></link><space/>was formed in 1964 by<space/><link><target>Manuel Marulanda Vlez</target></link><space/>and other MarxistLeninist supporters, after a military attack on the community of<space/><link><target>Marquetalia, Caldas</target><part>Marquetalia</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Although the system established by the Sitges agreement was phased out by 1974, the 1886 Colombian constitution &amp;mdash; in effect until 1991&amp;mdash;required that the losing political party be given adequate and equitable participation in the government which, according to many observers and later analysis, eventually resulted in some increase in corruption and legal relaxation. The current 1991 constitution does not have that requirement, but subsequent administrations have tended to include members of opposition parties.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Post-National Front years</heading><paragraph>From 1974 until 1982, different presidential administrations chose to focus on ending the persistent<space/><link><target>Insurgency</target><part>insurgencies</part></link><space/>that sought to undermine Colombia's traditional political system.

At the same time, its larger profile soon made it the focus of the state's counterinsurgency efforts.</paragraph><paragraph>The ELN guerrilla had been seriously crippled by military operations in the region of Anor by 1974, but it managed to reconstitute itself and escape destruction, in part due to the administration of<space/><link><target>Alfonso Lpez Michelsen</target></link><space/>(19741978) allowing it to escape encirclement, hoping to initiate a peace process with the group.</paragraph><paragraph>By 1982, the perceived passivity of the<space/><link><target>FARC</target></link>, together with the relative success of the government's efforts against the M-19 and ELN, enabled the administration of the Liberal Party's<space/><link><target>Julio Csar Turbay Ayala</target><part>Julio Csar Turbay</part></link><space/>(19781982) to lift a state-of-siege decree that had been in effect, on and off, for most of the previous 30 years. Under the latest such decree, president Turbay had implemented security policies that, though of some military value against the M-19 in particular, were considered highly questionable both inside and outside Colombian circles due to numerous accusations of military<space/><link><target>human rights abuse</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>against suspects and captured guerrillas.</paragraph><paragraph>Citizen exhaustion due to the conflict's newfound intensity led to the election of president<space/><link><target>Belisario Betancur</target></link><space/>(19821986), a Conservative who won 47% of the popular vote, directed peace feelers at all the insurgents, and negotiated a 1984 cease-fire with the FARC and M-19 after a 1982 release of many guerrillas imprisoned during the previous effort to overpower them. The ELN rejected entering any negotiation and continued to recover itself through the use of extortions and threats, in particular against foreign oil companies of European and U.S. origin.</paragraph><paragraph>As these events were developing, the growing<space/><link><target>illegal drug trade</target></link><space/>and its consequences were also increasingly becoming a matter of widespread importance to all participants in the Colombian conflict. Guerrillas and newly wealthy drug lords had mutually uneven relations and thus numerous incidents occurred between them. Eventually the kidnapping of drug cartel family members by guerrillas led to the creation of the 1981<space/><italics>Muerte a Secuestradores</italics><space/>(MAS) death squad (&quot;Death to Kidnappers&quot;). Pressure from the U.S. government and critical sectors of Colombian society was met with further violence, as the<space/><link><target>Medelln Cartel</target></link><space/>and its hitmen, bribed or murdered numerous public officials, politicians and others who stood in its way by supporting the implementation of<space/><link><target>extradition</target></link><space/>of Colombian nationals to the U.S. Victims of cartel violence. This included Justice Minister<space/><link><target>Rodrigo Lara Bonilla</target><part>Rodrigo Lara</part></link>, whose assassination in 1984 made the Betancur administration begin to directly oppose the drug lords.</paragraph><paragraph>The first negotiated cease-fire with the M-19 ended when the guerrillas resumed fighting in 1985, claiming that the cease-fire had not been fully respected by official security forces, saying that several of its members had suffered threats and assaults, and also questioning the government's real willingness to implement any accords. The Betancur administration in turn questioned the M-19's actions and its commitment to the peace process, as it continued to advance high profile negotiations with the FARC, which led to the creation of the<space/><link><target>Patriotic Union (Colombia)</target></link><space/>(UP), a legal and non-clandestine political organization.</paragraph><paragraph>On November 6, 1985, the M-19<space/><link><target>Palace of Justice siege</target><part>stormed the Colombian Palace of Justice</part></link><space/>and held the Supreme Court magistrates hostage, intending to put president Betancur on trial. In the ensuing crossfire that followed the military's reaction, scores of people lost their lives, as did most of the guerrillas, including several high-ranking operatives. Both sides blamed each other for the outcome.</paragraph><paragraph>Meanwhile, individual FARC members initially joined the UP leadership in representation of the guerrilla command, though most of the guerrilla's chiefs and militiamen did not demobilize nor disarm, as that was not a requirement of the process at that point in time. Tension soon significantly increased, as both sides began to accuse each other of not respecting the cease-fire. Political violence against FARC and UP members (including presidential candidate<space/><link><target>Jaime Pardo Leal</target><part>Jaime Pardo</part></link>) was blamed on drug lords and also on members of the security forces (to a much lesser degree on the argued inaction of Betancur administration). Members of the government and security authorities increasingly accused the FARC of continuing to recruit guerrillas, as well as kidnapping, extorting and politically intimidating voters even as the UP was already participating in politics.</paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>Virgilio Barco Vargas</target><part>Virgilio Barco</part></link><space/>(19861990) administration, in addition to continuing to handle the difficulties of the complex negotiations with the guerrillas, also inherited a particularly chaotic confrontation against the drug lords, who were engaged in a campaign of<space/><link><target>terrorism</target></link><space/>and murder in response to government moves in favor of their extradition overseas. The UP also suffered an increasing number of losses during this term (including the assassination of presidential candidate<space/><link><target>Bernardo Jaramillo Ossa</target><part>Bernardo Jaramillo</part></link>), which stemmed both from private proto-<link><target>paramilitary</target></link><space/>organizations, increasingly powerful drug lords and a number of would-be paramilitary-sympathizers within the armed forces.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Post 1990</heading><paragraph>Following administrations had to contend with the guerrillas, paramilitaries, narcotics traffickers and the violence and corruption that they all perpetuated, both through force and negotiation. Narcoterrorists assassinated three presidential candidates before<space/><link><target>Csar Gaviria Trujillo</target><part>Csar Gaviria</part></link><space/>was elected in 1990. Since the death of<space/><link><target>Medelln</target></link><space/>cartel leader<space/><link><target>Pablo Escobar</target></link><space/>in a police shootout during December 1993, indiscriminate acts of violence associated with that organization have abated as the &quot;cartels&quot; have broken up into multiple, smaller and often-competing trafficking organizations. Nevertheless, violence continues as these drug organizations resort to violence as part of their operations but also to protest government policies, including extradition.</paragraph><paragraph>The M-19 and several smaller guerrilla groups were successfully incorporated into a peace process as the 1980s ended and the 1990s began, which culminated in the elections for a<space/><link><target>Constituent Assembly of Colombia</target></link><space/>that would write a new constitution, which took effect in 1991. The new Constitution, brought about a considerable number of institutional and legal reforms based on principles that the delegates considered as more modern, humanist, democratic and politically open than those in the 1886 constitution. Practical results were mixed and mingled emerged (such as the debate surrounding the constitutional prohibition of extradition, which later was reversed), but together with the reincorporation of some of the guerrilla groups to the legal political framework, the new Constitution inaugurated an era that was both a continuation and a gradual, but significant, departure from what had come before.</paragraph><paragraph>Contacts with the FARC, which had irregularly continued despite the generalized<space/><link><target>de facto</target></link><space/>interruptions of the ceasefire and the official 1987 break from negotiations, were temporarily cut off in 1990 under the presidency of<space/><link><target>Csar Gaviria Trujillo</target><part>Csar Gaviria</part></link><space/>(19901994). The Colombian Army's assault on the FARC's<space/><italics>Casa Verde</italics><space/>sanctuary at<space/><link><target>La Uribe</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Meta Department</target><part>Meta</part></link>, followed by a FARC offensive that sought to undermine the deliberations of the Constitutional Assembly, began to highlight a significant break in the uneven negotiations carried over from the previous decade.</paragraph><paragraph>President<space/><link><target>Ernesto Samper Pizano</target><part>Ernesto Samper</part></link><space/>assumed office in August 1994. However, a political crisis relating to large-scale contributions from drug traffickers to Samper's presidential campaign diverted attention from governance programs, thus slowing, and in many cases, halting progress on the nation's domestic reform agenda. The military also suffered several setbacks in its fight against the guerrillas, when several of its rural bases began to be overrun and a record number of soldiers and officers were taken prisoner by the FARC (which since 1982 was attempting to implement a more &quot;conventional&quot; style of warfare, seeking to eventually defeat the military in the field).</paragraph><paragraph>On August 7, 1998,<space/><link><target>Andrs Pastrana Arango</target><part>Andrs Pastrana</part></link><space/>was sworn in as the President of Colombia. A member of the Conservative Party, Pastrana defeated Liberal Party candidate Horacio Serpa in a run-off election marked by high voter turn-out and little political unrest. The new president's program was based on a commitment to bring about a peaceful resolution of Colombia's longstanding civil conflict and to cooperate fully with the United States to combat the trafficking of illegal drugs.</paragraph><paragraph>While early initiatives in the Colombian peace process gave reason for optimism, the Pastrana administration also has had to combat high unemployment and other economic problems, such as the fiscal deficit and the impact of global financial instability on Colombia. During his administration, unemployment has risen to over 20%. Additionally, the growing severity of countrywide guerrilla attacks by the FARC and ELN, and smaller movements, as well as the growth of drug production, corruption and the spread of even more violent paramilitary groups such as the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (<link><target>United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia</target><part>AUC</part></link>) has made it difficult to solve the country's problems.</paragraph><paragraph>Although the FARC and ELN accepted participation in the peace process, they did not make explicit commitments to end the conflict. The FARC suspended talks in November 2000, to protest what it called &quot;paramilitary terrorism&quot; but returned to the negotiating table in February 2001, following 2 days of meetings between President Pastrana and FARC leader Manuel Marulanda. The Colombian Government and ELN in early 2001 continued discussions aimed at opening a formal peace process.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Recent developments</heading><paragraph><template><target>update</target><arg name="date">November 2010</arg></template><template><target>As of</target><arg>2004</arg></template>, two years after its implementation began, the security situation of inside Colombia has shown some measure of an improvement and the economy, while still fragile, has also shown some positive signs according to observers, but relatively little has yet to have been accomplished in structurally solving most of the country's other grave problems, possibly in part due to legislative and political conflicts between the administration and the Colombian Congress (including those over the controversial project to eventually re-elect Uribe), and a relative lack of freely allocated funds and credits.</paragraph><paragraph>Some critical observers consider that Uribe's policies, while admittedly reducing crime and guerrilla activity, might be too slanted in favor of a military solution to Colombia's internal war, neglecting grave social and human rights concerns to a certain extent. They ask for Uribe's government to change this position and make serious efforts towards improving the human rights situation inside the country, protecting civilians and reducing any abuses committed by the armed forces.</paragraph><paragraph>Uribe's supporters in turn believe that increased military action is a necessary prelude to any serious negotiation attempt with the guerrillas and that the increased security situation will help to, in the long term, focus more actively on reducing most wide-scale abuses and human rights violations on the part of both the armed groups and any rogue security forces that might have links to the paramilitaries. In short, that the security situation must be stabilized in favor of the government before any other social concerns can take precedence.</paragraph><paragraph>With such conflicting perspectives, it can be argued that a certain polarization between both supporters and opponents of President Uribe seems to be forming both inside and outside the country. Uribe was reelected in 2006 after a change in the constitution allowed presidents to be reelected.</paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Economic history of Colombia</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>History of the Americas</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>History of Latin America</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>History of South America</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>List of Presidents of Colombia</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Politics of Colombia</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Spanish colonization of the Americas</target></link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>Further reading</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem>Earle, Rebecca.<space/><italics>Spain and the Independence of Colombia, 18101825</italics>.
