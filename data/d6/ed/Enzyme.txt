'''Enzymes''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|n|z|aɪ|m|z}} are [[macromolecular]] [[biological]] [[catalyst]]s. Enzymes accelerate, or [[catalyze]], [[chemical reactions]]. The molecules at the beginning of the process are called [[substrate (chemistry)|substrates]] and the enzyme converts these into different molecules, called [[product (chemistry)|products]]. Almost all [[metabolism|metabolic processes]] in the [[cell (biology)|cell]] need enzymes in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life.<ref name = "Stryer_2002">{{cite book |author= Stryer L, Berg JM, Tymoczko JL | title = Biochemistry | publisher = W.H.

Enzymes are known to catalyze more than 5,000 biochemical reaction types.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schomburg I, Chang A, Placzek S, Söhngen C, Rother M, Lang M, Munaretto C, Ulas S, Stelzer M, Grote A, Scheer M, Schomburg D | title = BRENDA in 2013: integrated reactions, kinetic data, enzyme function data, improved disease classification: new options and contents in BRENDA | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 41 | issue = Database issue | pages = D764-72 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23203881 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gks1049 }}</ref> Most enzymes are [[protein]]s, although a few are [[Ribozyme|catalytic RNA molecules]].

Like all catalysts, enzymes increase the [[reaction rate|rate of a reaction]] by lowering its [[activation energy]]. Some enzymes can make their conversion of substrate to product occur many millions of times faster. An extreme example is [[orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase]], which allows a reaction that would otherwise take millions of years to occur in milliseconds.<ref name="radzicka">{{cite journal | vauthors = Radzicka A, Wolfenden R | title = A proficient enzyme | journal = Science | volume = 267 | issue = 5194 | pages = 90–931 | date = January 1995 | pmid = 7809611 | doi=10.1126/science.7809611}}</ref><ref name="pmid17889251">{{cite journal | vauthors = Callahan BP, Miller BG | title = OMP decarboxylase—An enigma persists | journal = Bioorganic Chemistry | volume = 35 | issue = 6 | pages = 465–9 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 17889251 | doi = 10.1016/j.bioorg.2007.07.004 }}</ref> Chemically, enzymes are like any catalyst and are not consumed in chemical reactions, nor do they alter the [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] of a reaction. Enzymes differ from most other catalysts by being much more specific. Enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules: [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitors]] are molecules that decrease enzyme activity, and [[enzyme activator|activators]] are molecules that increase activity. Many [[drug]]s and [[poison]]s are enzyme inhibitors. An enzyme's activity decreases markedly outside its optimal [[temperature]] and [[pH]].

Some enzymes are used commercially, for example, in the synthesis of [[antibiotics]]. Some household products use enzymes to speed up chemical reactions: enzymes in biological [[washing powder]]s break down protein, starch or [[fat]] stains on clothes, and enzymes in [[papain|meat tenderizer]] break down proteins into smaller molecules, making the meat easier to chew.

In 1877, German physiologist [[Wilhelm Kühne]] (1837–1900) first used the term ''[[wiktionary:enzyme|enzyme]]'', which comes from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἔνζυμον, "leavened", to describe this process.<ref>Kühne coined the word "enzyme" in: {{cite journal | vauthors = Kühne W | year = 1877 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jzdMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA190&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html | language = German | title = Über das Verhalten verschiedener organisirter und sog. ungeformter Fermente | trans-title = On the behavior of various organized and so-called unformed ferments | journal = Verhandlungen des naturhistorisch-medicinischen Vereins zu Heidelberg | series = new series | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 190–193 }} The relevant passage occurs on page 190: ''"Um Missverständnissen vorzubeugen und lästige Umschreibungen zu vermeiden schlägt Vortragender vor, die ungeformten oder nicht organisirten Fermente, deren Wirkung ohne Anwesenheit von Organismen und ausserhalb derselben erfolgen kann, als ''Enzyme'' zu bezeichnen."''

The biochemical identity of enzymes was still unknown in the early 1900s.

A small number of [[Ribonucleic acid|RNA]]-based biological catalysts called [[ribozyme]]s exist, which again can act alone or in complex with proteins. The most common of these is the [[ribosome]] which is a complex of protein and catalytic RNA components.<ref name = "Stryer_2002"/>{{rp|2.2}}

== Mechanism ==

=== Substrate binding ===
Enzymes must bind their substrates before they can catalyse any chemical reaction. Enzymes are usually very specific as to what [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]] they bind and then the chemical reaction catalysed. Specificity is achieved by binding pockets with complementary shape, charge and [[hydrophilic]]/[[hydrophobic]] characteristics to the substrates. Enzymes can therefore distinguish between very similar substrate molecules to be [[chemoselectivity|chemoselective]], [[regioselectivity|regioselective]] and [[stereospecificity|stereospecific]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jaeger KE, Eggert T | title = Enantioselective biocatalysis optimized by directed evolution | journal = Current Opinion in Biotechnology | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 305–13 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15358000 | doi = 10.1016/j.copbio.2004.06.007 }}</ref>

Some of the enzymes showing the highest specificity and accuracy are involved in the copying and [[Gene expression|expression]] of the [[genome]]. Some of these enzymes have "[[Proofreading (biology)|proof-reading]]" mechanisms. Here, an enzyme such as [[DNA polymerase]] catalyzes a reaction in a first step and then checks that the product is correct in a second step.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Shevelev IV, Hübscher U | title = The 3' 5' exonucleases | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 5 | pages = 364–76 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 11988770 | doi = 10.1038/nrm804 }}</ref> This two-step process results in average error rates of less than 1 error in 100 million reactions in high-fidelity mammalian polymerases.<ref name = "Stryer_2002"/>{{rp|5.3.1}} Similar proofreading mechanisms are also found in [[RNA polymerase]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zenkin N, Yuzenkova Y, Severinov K | title = Transcript-assisted transcriptional proofreading | journal = Science | volume = 313 | issue = 5786 | pages = 518–20 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16873663 | doi = 10.1126/science.1127422 }}</ref> [[aminoacyl tRNA synthetase]]s<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ibba M, Soll D | title = Aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 69 | pages = 617–50 | pmid = 10966471 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.69.1.617 }}</ref> and [[ribosome]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rodnina MV, Wintermeyer W | title = Fidelity of aminoacyl-tRNA selection on the ribosome: kinetic and structural mechanisms | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 70 | pages = 415–35 | pmid = 11395413 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.70.1.415 }}</ref>

Conversely, some enzymes display [[enzyme promiscuity]], having broad specificity and acting on a range of different physiologically relevant substrates. Many enzymes possess small side activities which arose fortuitously (i.e. [[Neutral evolution|neutrally]]), which may be the starting point for the evolutionary selection of a new function.<ref name=Tawfik10>{{cite journal | vauthors = Khersonsky O, Tawfik DS | title = Enzyme promiscuity: a mechanistic and evolutionary perspective | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 79 | pages = 471–505 | pmid = 20235827 | pmc = | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-030409-143718 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Brien PJ, Herschlag D | title = Catalytic promiscuity and the evolution of new enzymatic activities | journal = Chemistry & Biology | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = R91-R105 | date = April 1999 | pmid = 10099128 | doi = 10.1016/S1074-5521(99)80033-7 }}</ref>

==== "Lock and key" model ====
To explain the observed specificity of enzymes, in 1894 [[Hermann Emil Fischer|Emil Fischer]] proposed that both the enzyme and the substrate possess specific complementary geometric shapes that fit exactly into one another.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fischer E | year = 1894 | title = Einfluss der Configuration auf die Wirkung der Enzyme | language = German | trans_title = Influence of configuration on the action of enzymes | journal=Berichte der Deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft zu Berlin | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 2985–93 | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k90736r/f364.chemindefer|doi=10.1002/cber.18940270364 }} From page 2992: ''"Um ein Bild zu gebrauchen, will ich sagen, dass Enzym und Glucosid wie Schloss und Schlüssel zu einander passen müssen, um eine chemische Wirkung auf einander ausüben zu können."''

==== Induced fit model ====
In 1958, [[Daniel E.

Enzymes may use several of these mechanisms simultaneously. For example, [[protease]]s such as [[trypsin]] perform covalent catalysis using a [[catalytic triad]], stabilise charge build-up on the transition states using an [[oxyanion hole]], complete [[hydrolysis]] using an oriented water substrate.

=== Dynamics ===

{{See also|Protein dynamics}}

Enzymes are not rigid, static structures; instead they have complex internal dynamic motions – that is, movements of parts of the enzyme's structure such as individual amino acid residues, groups of residues forming a [[turn (biochemistry)|protein loop]] or unit of [[protein secondary structure|secondary structure]], or even an entire [[protein domain]]. These motions give rise to a [[conformational ensemble]] of slightly different structures that interconvert with one another at [[thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]]. Different states within this ensemble may be associated with different aspects of an enzyme's function. For example, different conformations of the enzyme [[dihydrofolate reductase]] are associated with the substrate binding, catalysis, cofactor release, and product release steps of the catalytic cycle.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ramanathan A, Savol A, Burger V, Chennubhotla CS, Agarwal PK |title=Protein conformational populations and functionally relevant substates |journal=Acc.

=== Allosteric modulation ===
{{main |Allosteric regulation}}

Allosteric sites are pockets on the enzyme, distinct from the active site, that bind to molecules in the cellular environment. These molecules then cause a change in the conformation or dynamics of the enzyme that is transduced to the active site and thus affects the reaction rate of the enzyme.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Tsai CJ, Del Sol A, Nussinov R |title=Protein allostery, signal transmission and dynamics: a classification scheme of allosteric mechanisms |journal=Mol Biosyst |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=207–16 |year=2009 |pmid=19225609 |pmc=2898650 |doi=10.1039/b819720b |url=}}</ref> In this way, allosteric interactions can either inhibit or activate enzymes. Allosteric interactions with metabolites upstream or downstream in an enzyme's metabolic pathway cause [[feedback]] regulation, altering the activity of the enzyme according to the [[Flux (metabolism)|flux]] through the rest of the pathway.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Changeux JP, Edelstein SJ | title = Allosteric mechanisms of signal transduction | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5727 | pages = 1424–8 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15933191 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108595 }}</ref>

==Cofactors==

{{main|Cofactor (biochemistry)}}

Some enzymes do not need additional components to show full activity. Others require non-protein molecules called cofactors to be bound for activity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/bioinorg/CD.html#34 | title = Glossary of Terms Used in Bioinorganic Chemistry: Cofactor | accessdate = 30 October 2007 | last = de Bolster | first = M.W.G. | year = 1997 | publisher = International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry | name-list-format = vanc }}</ref> Cofactors can be either [[inorganic]] (e.g., [[ion|metal ions]] and [[iron-sulfur cluster]]s) or [[organic molecules|organic compounds]] (e.g., [[flavin group|flavin]] and [[heme]]). Organic cofactors can be either [[coenzyme]]s, which are released from the enzyme's active site during the reaction, or [[prosthetic groups]], which are tightly bound to an enzyme. Organic prosthetic groups can be covalently bound (e.g., [[biotin]] in enzymes such as [[pyruvate carboxylase]]).<ref name="pmid10470036">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chapman-Smith A, Cronan JE | title = The enzymatic biotinylation of proteins: a post-translational modification of exceptional specificity | journal = Trends Biochem. Sci. | volume = 24 | issue = 9 | pages = 359–63 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10470036 | doi = 10.1016/s0968-0004(99)01438-3}}</ref>

An example of an enzyme that contains a cofactor is [[carbonic anhydrase]], which is shown in the [[ribbon diagram]] above with a zinc cofactor bound as part of its active site.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fisher Z, Hernandez Prada JA, Tu C, Duda D, Yoshioka C, An H, Govindasamy L, Silverman DN, McKenna R | title = Structural and kinetic characterization of active-site histidine as a proton shuttle in catalysis by human carbonic anhydrase II | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 1097–115 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15667203 | doi = 10.1021/bi0480279 }}</ref> These tightly bound ions or molecules are usually found in the active site and are involved in catalysis.<ref name = "Stryer_2002"/>{{rp|8.1.1}} For example, flavin and heme cofactors are often involved in [[redox]] reactions.<ref name = "Stryer_2002"/>{{rp|17}}

Enzymes that require a cofactor but do not have one bound are called ''apoenzymes'' or ''apoproteins''. An enzyme together with the cofactor(s) required for activity is called a ''holoenzyme'' (or haloenzyme). The term ''holoenzyme'' can also be applied to enzymes that contain multiple protein subunits, such as the [[DNA polymerase]]s; here the holoenzyme is the complete complex containing all the subunits needed for activity.<ref name = "Stryer_2002"/>{{rp|8.1.1}}

===Coenzymes===

Coenzymes are small organic molecules that can be loosely or tightly bound to an enzyme. Coenzymes transport chemical groups from one enzyme to another.<ref name = "Wagner_1975">{{cite book | author = Wagner AL | title = Vitamins and Coenzymes | publisher = Krieger Pub Co | year = 1975 | isbn = 0-88275-258-8}}</ref> Examples include [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NADH]], [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADPH]] and [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP). Some coenzymes, such as [[riboflavin]], [[thiamine]] and [[folic acid]], are [[vitamins]], or compounds that cannot be synthesized by the body and must be acquired from the diet. The chemical groups carried include the [[hydride]] ion (H<sup>−</sup>) carried by [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD or NADP<sup>+</sup>]], the phosphate group carried by [[adenosine triphosphate]], the acetyl group carried by [[coenzyme A]], formyl, methenyl or methyl groups carried by [[folic acid]] and the methyl group carried by [[S-adenosylmethionine]].<ref name = "Wagner_1975"/>

Since coenzymes are chemically changed as a consequence of enzyme action, it is useful to consider coenzymes to be a special class of substrates, or second substrates, which are common to many different enzymes. For example, about 1000 enzymes are known to use the coenzyme NADH.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.brenda-enzymes.org | title = BRENDA The Comprehensive Enzyme Information System | publisher = Technische Universität Braunschweig | accessdate = 23 February 2015 }}</ref>

Coenzymes are usually continuously regenerated and their concentrations maintained at a steady level inside the cell. For example, NADPH is regenerated through the [[pentose phosphate pathway]] and ''S''-adenosylmethionine by [[methionine adenosyltransferase]]. This continuous regeneration means that small amounts of coenzymes can be used very intensively. For example, the human body turns over its own weight in ATP each day.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Törnroth-Horsefield S, Neutze R | title = Opening and closing the metabolite gate | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States | volume = 105 | issue = 50 | pages = 19565–6 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19073922 | pmc = 2604989 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0810654106 }}</ref>

==Thermodynamics==
[[File:Enzyme catalysis energy levels 2.svg|thumb|400px|alt=A two dimensional plot of reaction coordinate (x-axis) vs. energy (y-axis) for catalyzed and uncatalyzed reactions. The energy of the system steadily increases from reactants (x = 0) until a maximum is reached at the transition state (x = 0.5), and steadily decreases to the products (x = 1). However, in an enzyme catalysed reaction, binding generates an enzyme-substrate complex (with slightly reduced energy) then increases up to a transition state with a smaller maximum than the uncatalysed reaction.|The energies of the stages of a [[chemical reaction]]. Uncatalysed (dashed line), substrates need a lot of [[activation energy]] to reach a [[transition state]], which then decays into lower-energy products. When enzyme catalysed (solid line), the enzyme binds the substrates (ES), then stabilizes the transition state (ES<sup>‡</sup>) to reduce the activation energy required to produce products (EP) which are finally released.]]

{{main |Activation energy|Thermodynamic equilibrium|Chemical equilibrium}}

As with all catalysts, enzymes do not alter the position of the chemical equilibrium of the reaction. In the presence of an enzyme, the reaction runs in the same direction as it would without the enzyme, just more quickly.<ref name = "Stryer_2002"/>{{rp|8.2.3}} For example, [[carbonic anhydrase]] catalyzes its reaction in either direction depending on the concentration of its reactants:<ref>{{cite book | author = McArdle WD, Katch F, Katch VL | title = Essentials of Exercise Physiology | date = 2006 | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | location = Baltimore, Maryland | isbn = 978-0781749916 | pages = 312–3 | edition = 3rd | chapter = Chapter 9: The Pulmonary System and Exercise | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=L4aZIDbmV3oC&pg=PA313&lpg=PA313&dq=carbonic+anhydrase+lung+tissue+low+high+carbon+dioxide+equilibrium&source=bl&ots=WmoWpbFgYQ&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=carbonic%20anhydrase%20lung%20tissue%20low%20high%20carbon%20dioxide%20equilibrium&f=false}}</ref>

: <math>\mathrm{H_2CO_3 \xrightarrow{Carbonic\ anhydrase}
CO_2 + H_2O}</math> (in [[lung]]s; low CO<sub>2</sub> concentration)

The rate of a reaction is dependent on the [[activation energy]] needed to form the [[transition state]] which then decays into products. Enzymes increase reaction rates by lowering the energy of the transition state. First, binding forms a low energy enzyme-substrate complex (ES). Secondly the enzyme stabilises the transition state such that it requires less energy to achieve compared to the uncatalyzed reaction (ES<sup>‡</sup>). Finally the enzyme-product complex (EP) dissociates to release the products.<ref name = "Stryer_2002"/>{{rp|8.3}}

Enzymes can couple two or more reactions, so that a thermodynamically favorable reaction can be used to "drive" a thermodynamically unfavourable one so that the combined energy of the products is lower than the substrates. For example, the hydrolysis of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] is often used to drive other chemical reactions.<ref name="Nicholls">{{cite book | author = Ferguson SJ, Nicholls D, Ferguson S | title = Bioenergetics 3 | publisher = Academic | location = San Diego | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-12-518121-3 | edition = 3rd}}</ref>

{{main|Enzyme kinetics}}

Enzyme kinetics is the investigation of how enzymes bind substrates and turn them into products. The rate data used in kinetic analyses are commonly obtained from [[enzyme assay]]s. In 1913 [[Leonor Michaelis]] and [[Maud Leonora Menten]] proposed a quantitative theory of enzyme kinetics, which is referred to as [[Michaelis–Menten kinetics]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Michaelis L, Menten M | year = 1913 | title = Die Kinetik der Invertinwirkung | journal = Biochem. Z. | volume = 49 | pages = 333–369 | language = German | trans-title = The Kinetics of Invertase Action | url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/bi201284u/suppl_file/bi201284u_si_001.pdf |doi=10.1021/bi201284u}}; {{cite journal | vauthors = Michaelis L, Menten ML, Johnson KA, Goody RS | title = The original Michaelis constant: translation of the 1913 Michaelis-Menten paper | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 50 | issue = 39 | pages = 8264–9 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21888353 | pmc = 3381512 | doi = 10.1021/bi201284u }}</ref> The major contribution of Michaelis and Menten was to think of enzyme reactions in two stages. In the first, the substrate binds reversibly to the enzyme, forming the enzyme-substrate complex. This is sometimes called the Michaelis-Menten complex in their honor. The enzyme then catalyzes the chemical step in the reaction and releases the product. This work was further developed by [[George Edward Briggs|G. E. Briggs]] and [[J. B. S. Haldane]], who derived kinetic equations that are still widely used today.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Briggs GE, Haldane JB | title = A Note on the Kinetics of Enzyme Action | journal = The Biochemical Journal | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 339–339 | year = 1925 | pmid = 16743508 | pmc = 1259181 }}</ref>

Enzyme rates depend on [[solution]] conditions and substrate [[concentration]]. To find the maximum speed of an enzymatic reaction, the substrate concentration is increased until a constant rate of product formation is seen. This is shown in the saturation curve on the right. Saturation happens because, as substrate concentration increases, more and more of the free enzyme is converted into the substrate-bound ES complex. At the maximum reaction rate (''V''<sub>max</sub>) of the enzyme, all the enzyme active sites are bound to substrate, and the amount of ES complex is the same as the total amount of enzyme.<ref name = "Stryer_2002"/>{{rp|8.4}}

''V''<sub>max</sub> is only one of several important kinetic parameters. The amount of substrate needed to achieve a given rate of reaction is also important. This is given by the [[Michaelis-Menten constant]] (''K''<sub>m</sub>), which is the substrate concentration required for an enzyme to reach one-half its maximum reaction rate; generally, each enzyme has a characteristic ''K''<sub>m</sub> for a given substrate. Another useful constant is ''k''<sub>cat</sub>, also called the ''turnover number'', which is the number of substrate molecules handled by one active site per second.<ref name = "Stryer_2002"/>{{rp|8.4}}

The efficiency of an enzyme can be expressed in terms of ''k''<sub>cat</sub>/''K''<sub>m</sub>. This is also called the specificity constant and incorporates the [[rate constant]]s for all steps in the reaction up to and including the first irreversible step. Because the specificity constant reflects both affinity and catalytic ability, it is useful for comparing different enzymes against each other, or the same enzyme with different substrates. The theoretical maximum for the specificity constant is called the diffusion limit and is about 10<sup>8</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup> (M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>). At this point every collision of the enzyme with its substrate will result in catalysis, and the rate of product formation is not limited by the reaction rate but by the diffusion rate. Enzymes with this property are called ''[[catalytically perfect enzyme|catalytically perfect]]'' or ''kinetically perfect''. Example of such enzymes are [[triosephosphateisomerase|triose-phosphate isomerase]], [[carbonic anhydrase]], [[acetylcholinesterase]], [[catalase]], [[fumarase]], [[β-lactamase]], and [[superoxide dismutase]].<ref name = "Stryer_2002"/>{{rp|8.4.2}} The turnover of such enzymes can reach several million reactions per second.<ref name = "Stryer_2002"/>{{rp|9.2}}

Michaelis–Menten kinetics relies on the [[law of mass action]], which is derived from the assumptions of free [[diffusion]] and thermodynamically driven random collision. Many biochemical or cellular processes deviate significantly from these conditions, because of [[macromolecular crowding]] and constrained molecular movement.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ellis RJ | title = Macromolecular crowding: obvious but underappreciated | journal = Trends in Biochemical Sciences | volume = 26 | issue = 10 | pages = 597–604 | date = October 2001 | pmid = 11590012 | doi = 10.1016/S0968-0004(01)01938-7 }}</ref> More recent, complex extensions of the model attempt to correct for these effects.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kopelman R | title = Fractal reaction kinetics | journal = Science | volume = 241 | issue = 4873 | pages = 1620–26 | date = September 1988 | pmid = 17820893 | doi = 10.1126/science.241.4873.1620 }}</ref>

===Types of inhibition===

;Competitive: A [[competitive inhibitor]] and substrate cannot bind to the enzyme at the same time.<ref name = "Price_1979">{{cite journal | vauthors = Price NC | year = 1979 | title = What is meant by 'competitive inhibition'? | journal = Trends in Biochemical Sciences | volume = 4 | issue=11 | pages = N272–N273 | doi = 10.1016/0968-0004(79)90205-6 }}</ref> Often competitive inhibitors strongly resemble the real substrate of the enzyme. For example, the drug [[methotrexate]] is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme [[dihydrofolate reductase]], which catalyzes the reduction of [[folic acid|dihydrofolate]] to tetrahydrofolate. The similarity between the structures of dihydrofolate and this drug are shown in the accompanying figure. This type of inhibition can be overcome with high substrate concentration. In some cases, the inhibitor can bind to a site other than the binding-site of the usual substrate and exert an [[#Allosteric modulation|allosteric effect]] to change the shape of the usual binding-site.
;Non-competitive: A [[non-competitive inhibition|non-competitive inhibitor]] binds to a site other than where the substrate binds. The substrate still binds with its usual affinity and hence K<sub>m</sub> remains the same. However the inhibitor reduces the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme so that V<sub>max</sub> is reduced. In contrast to competitive inhibition, non-competitive inhibition cannot be overcome with high substrate concentration.<ref name = "Cornish-Bowden_2004"/>{{rp|76–78}}
; Uncompetitive: An [[uncompetitive inhibitor]] cannot bind to the free enzyme, only to the enzyme-substrate complex; hence, these types of inhibitors are most effective at high substrate concentration. In the presence of the inhibitor, the enzyme-substrate complex is inactive.<ref name = "Cornish-Bowden_2004"/>{{rp|78}} This type of inhibition is rare.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cornish-Bowden A | title = Why is uncompetitive inhibition so rare?

;Mixed: A [[mixed inhibition|mixed inhibitor]] binds to an allosteric site and the binding of the substrate and the inhibitor affect each other. The enzyme's function is reduced but not eliminated when bound to the inhibitor. This type of inhibitor does not follow the Michaelis-Menten equation.<ref name = "Cornish-Bowden_2004"/>{{rp|76–78}}
; Irreversible: An [[irreversible inhibitor]] permanently inactivates the enzyme, usually by forming a [[covalent bond]] to the protein.

===Functions of inhibitors===

In many organisms, inhibitors may act as part of a [[feedback]] mechanism. If an enzyme produces too much of one substance in the organism, that substance may act as an inhibitor for the enzyme at the beginning of the pathway that produces it, causing production of the substance to slow down or stop when there is sufficient amount. This is a form of [[negative feedback]]. Major metabolic pathways such as the [[citric acid cycle]] make use of this mechanism.<ref name = "Stryer_2002" />{{rp|17.2.2}}

An important function of enzymes is in the [[digestive systems]] of animals. Enzymes such as [[amylases]] and [[proteases]] break down large molecules ([[starch]] or [[protein]]s, respectively) into smaller ones, so they can be absorbed by the intestines. Starch molecules, for example, are too large to be absorbed from the intestine, but enzymes hydrolyze the starch chains into smaller molecules such as [[maltose]] and eventually [[glucose]], which can then be absorbed. Different enzymes digest different food substances. In [[ruminants]], which have [[herbivorous]] diets, microorganisms in the gut produce another enzyme, [[cellulase]], to break down the cellulose cell walls of plant fiber.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mackie RI, White BA | title = Recent advances in rumen microbial ecology and metabolism: potential impact on nutrient output | journal = Journal of Dairy Science | volume = 73 | issue = 10 | pages = 2971–95 | date = October 1990 | pmid = 2178174 | doi = 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(90)78986-2 }}</ref>

===Metabolism===

[[Image:Glycolysis metabolic pathway.svg|thumb|400px|alt=Schematic diagram of the glycolytic metabolic pathway starting with glucose and ending with pyruvate via several intermediate chemicals. Each step in the pathway is catalyzed by a unique enzyme.|The [[metabolic pathway]] of [[glycolysis]] releases energy by converting [[glucose]] to [[pyruvate]] by via a series of intermediate metabolites. Each chemical modification (red box) is performed by a different enzyme.]]

Several enzymes can work together in a specific order, creating [[metabolic pathway]]s.<ref name = "Stryer_2002" />{{rp|30.1}} In a metabolic pathway, one enzyme takes the product of another enzyme as a substrate. After the catalytic reaction, the product is then passed on to another enzyme. Sometimes more than one enzyme can catalyze the same reaction in parallel; this can allow more complex regulation: with, for example, a low constant activity provided by one enzyme but an inducible high activity from a second enzyme.<ref name="Rouzer_2009">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rouzer CA, Marnett LJ | title = Cyclooxygenases: structural and functional insights | journal = J. Lipid Res. | volume = 50 Suppl | issue = | pages = S29–34 | year = 2009 | pmid = 18952571 | pmc = 2674713 | doi = 10.1194/jlr.R800042-JLR200 }}</ref>

Enzymes determine what steps occur in these pathways. Without enzymes, metabolism would neither progress through the same steps and could not be regulated to serve the needs of the cell. Most central metabolic pathways are regulated at a few key steps, typically through enzymes whose activity involves the hydrolysis of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]. Because this reaction releases so much energy, other reactions that are [[endothermic|thermodynamically unfavorable]] can be coupled to ATP hydrolysis, driving the overall series of linked metabolic reactions.<ref name = "Stryer_2002" />{{rp|30.1}}

=== Control of activity ===

There are five main ways that enzyme activity is controlled in the cell.<ref name = "Stryer_2002" />{{rp|30.1.1}}

;Regulation: Enzymes can be either [[enzyme activator|activated]] or [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibited]] by other molecules. For example, the end product(s) of a metabolic pathway are often inhibitors for one of the first enzymes of the pathway (usually the first irreversible step, called committed step), thus regulating the amount of end product made by the pathways. Such a regulatory mechanism is called a [[negative feedback|negative feedback mechanism]], because the amount of the end product produced is regulated by its own concentration.<ref name = "Suzuki_2015_8"/>{{rp|141–48}} Negative feedback mechanism can effectively adjust the rate of synthesis of intermediate metabolites according to the demands of the cells. This helps with effective allocations of materials and energy economy, and it prevents the excess manufacture of end products. Like other [[homeostasis|homeostatic devices]], the control of enzymatic action helps to maintain a stable internal environment in living organisms.<ref name = "Suzuki_2015_8"/>{{rp|141}}

; Post-translational modification: Examples of [[post-translational modification]] include [[phosphorylation]], [[myristoylation]] and [[glycosylation]].<ref name = "Suzuki_2015_8">{{cite book | author = Suzuki H | title = How Enzymes Work: From Structure to Function | publisher = CRC Press | location = Boca Raton, FL | year = 2015 | isbn = 978-981-4463-92-8 | chapter = Chapter 8: Control of Enzyme Activity | pages = 141–69 }}</ref>{{rp|149–69}} For example, in the response to [[insulin]], the [[phosphorylation]] of multiple enzymes, including [[glycogen synthase]], helps control the synthesis or degradation of [[glycogen]] and allows the cell to respond to changes in [[blood sugar]].<ref name = "Doble_2003">{{cite journal | vauthors = Doble BW, Woodgett JR | title = GSK-3: tricks of the trade for a multi-tasking kinase | journal = Journal of Cell Science | volume = 116 | issue = Pt 7 | pages = 1175–86 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 12615961 | pmc = 3006448 | doi = 10.1242/jcs.00384 }}</ref> Another example of post-translational modification is the cleavage of the polypeptide chain. [[Chymotrypsin]], a digestive [[protease]], is produced in inactive form as [[chymotrypsinogen]] in the [[pancreas]] and transported in this form to the [[stomach]] where it is activated. This stops the enzyme from digesting the pancreas or other tissues before it enters the gut. This type of inactive precursor to an enzyme is known as a [[zymogen]].<ref name = "Suzuki_2015_8"/>{{rp|149–53}}

; Quantity: Enzyme production ([[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (genetics)|translation]] of enzyme genes) can be enhanced or diminished by a cell in response to changes in the cell's environment. This form of [[regulation of gene expression|gene regulation]] is called [[enzyme induction]]. For example, bacteria may become [[antibiotic resistance|resistant to antibiotics]] such as [[penicillin]] because enzymes called [[beta-lactamase]]s are induced that hydrolyse the crucial [[Beta-lactam|beta-lactam ring]] within the penicillin molecule.<ref name="pmid8452343">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bennett PM, Chopra I | title = Molecular basis of beta-lactamase induction in bacteria | journal = Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 153–8 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8452343 | pmc = 187630 | doi = 10.1128/aac.37.2.153| url = http://aac.asm.org/content/37/2/153.full.pdf }}</ref> Another example comes from enzymes in the [[liver]] called [[cytochrome P450 oxidase]]s, which are important in [[drug metabolism]]. Induction or inhibition of these enzymes can cause [[drug interaction]]s.<ref name = "Skett_Gibson_2001">{{cite book | author = Skett P, Gibson GG | title = Introduction to Drug Metabolism | date = 2001 | publisher = Nelson Thornes Publishers | location = Cheltenham, UK | isbn = 978-0748760114 | pages = 87–118 | edition = 3 | chapter = Chapter 3: Induction and Inhibition of Drug Metabolism }}</ref> Enzyme levels can also be regulated by changing the rate of enzyme [[catabolism|degradation]].<ref name="Stryer_2002" />{{rp|30.1.1}}

; Subcellular distribution: Enzymes can be compartmentalized, with different metabolic pathways occurring in different [[cellular compartment]]s. For example, [[fatty acids]] are synthesized by one set of enzymes in the [[cytosol]], [[endoplasmic reticulum]] and [[golgi apparatus|golgi]] and used by a different set of enzymes as a source of energy in the [[mitochondrion]], through [[β-oxidation]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Faergeman NJ, Knudsen J | title = Role of long-chain fatty acyl-CoA esters in the regulation of metabolism and in cell signalling | journal = The Biochemical Journal | volume = 323 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 1–12 | date = April 1997 | pmid = 9173866 | pmc = 1218279 }}</ref> In addition, [[protein targeting|trafficking]] of the enzyme to different compartments may change the degree of [[protonation]] ([[cytoplasm]] neutral and [[lysosome]] acidic) or oxidative state [e.g., oxidized ([[periplasm]]) or reduced ([[cytoplasm]])] which in turn affects enzyme activity.<ref name = "Suzuki_2015_4">{{cite book | author = Suzuki H | title = How Enzymes Work: From Structure to Function | publisher = CRC Press | location = Boca Raton, FL | year = 2015 | isbn = 978-981-4463-92-8 | chapter = Chapter 4: Effect of pH, Temperature, and High Pressure on Enzymatic Activity | pages = 53–74 }}</ref>

; Organ specialization: In [[multicellular]] [[eukaryote]]s, cells in different [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] and [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] have different patterns of [[gene expression]] and therefore have different sets of enzymes (known as [[isozyme]]s) available for metabolic reactions. This provides a mechanism for regulating the overall metabolism of the organism. For example, [[hexokinase]], the first enzyme in the [[glycolysis]] pathway, has a specialized form called [[glucokinase]] expressed in the [[liver]] and [[pancreas]] that has a lower [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for glucose yet is more sensitive to glucose concentration.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kamata K, Mitsuya M, Nishimura T, Eiki J, Nagata Y | title = Structural basis for allosteric regulation of the monomeric allosteric enzyme human glucokinase | journal = Structure | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 429–38 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 15016359 | doi = 10.1016/j.str.2004.02.005 }}</ref> This enzyme is involved in sensing [[blood sugar]] and regulating [[insulin]] production.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Froguel P, Zouali H, Vionnet N, Velho G, Vaxillaire M, Sun F, Lesage S, Stoffel M, Takeda J, Passa P | title = Familial hyperglycemia due to mutations in glucokinase.

=== Involvement in disease ===

[[File:Phenylalanine hydroxylase mutations.png|thumb|400px|alt= Ribbon diagram of phenylalanine hydroxylase with bound cofactor, coenzyme and substrate|In [[phenylalanine hydroxylase]] over 300 different mutations throughout the structure cause [[phenylketonuria]].

{{see also|Genetic disorder}}

Since the tight control of enzyme activity is essential for [[homeostasis]], any malfunction (mutation, overproduction, underproduction or deletion) of a single critical enzyme can lead to a [[genetic disease]]. The malfunction of just one type of enzyme out of the thousands of types present in the human body can be fatal. An example of a fatal [[genetic disease]] due to enzyme insufficiency is [[Tay-Sachs]] disease, in which patients lack the enzyme [[hexosaminidase]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Okada S, O'Brien JS | title = Tay-Sachs disease: generalized absence of a beta-D-N-acetylhexosaminidase component | journal = Science | volume = 165 | issue = 3894 | pages = 698–700 | date = August 1969 | pmid = 5793973 | doi=10.1126/science.165.3894.698}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Learning About Tay-Sachs Disease | url = http://www.genome.gov/10001220 | publisher = U.S. National Human Genome Research Institute | accessdate = 1 March 2015 }}</ref>

One example of enzyme deficiency is the most common type of [[phenylketonuria]]. Many different single amino acid mutations in the enzyme [[phenylalanine hydroxylase]], which catalyzes the first step in the degradation of [[phenylalanine]], result in build-up of phenylalanine and related products. Some mutations are in the active site, directly disrupting binding and catalysis, but many are far from the active site and reduce activity by destabilising the protein structure, or affecting correct oligomerisation.<ref name=pmid10527663>{{cite journal | vauthors = Erlandsen H, Stevens RC | title = The structural basis of phenylketonuria | journal = Molecular Genetics and Metabolism | volume = 68 | issue = 2 | pages = 103–25 | date = October 1999 | pmid = 10527663 | doi = 10.1006/mgme.1999.2922 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Flatmark T, Stevens RC | title = Structural Insight into the Aromatic Amino Acid Hydroxylases and Their Disease-Related Mutant Forms | journal = Chemical Reviews | volume = 99 | issue = 8 | pages = 2137–2160 | date = August 1999 | pmid = 11849022 | doi = 10.1021/cr980450y }}</ref> This can lead to [[intellectual disability]] if the disease is untreated.<ref>{{cite book | title = Genes and Disease [Internet] | chapterurl = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22253/ | chapter = Phenylketonuria | publisher = National Center for Biotechnology Information (US) | location = Bethesda (MD) | year = 1998–2015 | accessdate = 4 April 2007 }}</ref> Another example is [[pseudocholinesterase deficiency]], in which the body's ability to break down choline ester drugs is impaired.<ref>{{cite web | title = Pseudocholinesterase deficiency | url = http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/pseudocholinesterase-deficiency | publisher = U.S. National Library of Medicine | accessdate = 5 September 2013 }}</ref> 
Oral administration of enzymes can be used to treat some functional enzyme deficiencies, such as [[pancreatic insufficiency]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fieker A, Philpott J, Armand M | title = Enzyme replacement therapy for pancreatic insufficiency: present and future | journal = Clinical and Experimental Gastroenterology | volume = 4 | pages = 55–73 | date = 2011 | pmid = 21753892 | doi = 10.2147/CEG.S17634 }}</ref> and [[lactose intolerance]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Misselwitz B, Pohl D, Frühauf H, Fried M, Vavricka SR, Fox M | title = Lactose malabsorption and intolerance: pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment | journal = United European Gastroenterology Journal | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 151–9 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 24917953 | doi = 10.1177/2050640613484463 }}</ref>

Another way enzyme malfunctions can cause disease comes from [[germline mutation]]s in genes coding for [[DNA repair]] enzymes. Defects in these enzymes cause cancer because cells are less able to repair mutations in their [[genome]]s. This causes a slow accumulation of mutations and results in the [[carcinogenesis|development of cancers]]. An example of such a hereditary [[cancer syndrome]] is [[xeroderma pigmentosum]], which causes the development of [[skin cancer]]s in response to even minimal exposure to [[ultraviolet light]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cleaver JE | title = Defective repair replication of DNA in xeroderma pigmentosum | journal = Nature | volume = 218 | issue = 5142 | pages = 652–6 | date = May 1968 | pmid = 5655953 | doi = 10.1038/218652a0 }}</ref><ref name="Andrews">{{cite book | last1 = James | first1 = William D | last2 = Elston | first2 = Dirk | last3 = Berger | first3 = Timothy G | title = Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology | date = 2011 | publisher = Saunders/ Elsevier | location = London | isbn = 978-1437703146 | edition = 11th | page = 567 | name-list-format = vanc }}</ref>

== Naming conventions ==
An enzyme's name is often derived from its substrate or the chemical reaction it catalyzes, with the word ending in ''-ase''.<ref name="Stryer_2002" />{{rp|8.1.3}} Examples are [[lactase]], [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] and [[DNA polymerase]]. Different enzymes that catalyze the same chemical reaction are called [[isozymes]].<ref name = "Stryer_2002"/>{{rp|10.3}}

The [[International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology]] have developed a [[nomenclature]] for enzymes, the [[Enzyme Commission number|EC numbers]]; each enzyme is described by a sequence of four numbers preceded by "EC". The first number broadly classifies the enzyme based on its mechanism.<ref name="url_Enzyme_Classification">{{cite web | url = http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/rules.html | title = Classification and Nomenclature of Enzymes by the Reactions they Catalyse | author = Nomenclature Committee | work = International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (NC-IUBMB) | publisher = School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary, University of London }}</ref>

The top-level classification is:
*EC 1, [[Oxidoreductase]]s: catalyze [[oxidation]]/reduction reactions
*EC 2, [[Transferase]]s: transfer a [[functional group]] (''e.g.'' a methyl or phosphate group)
*EC 3, [[Hydrolase]]s: catalyze the [[hydrolysis]] of various bonds
*EC 4, [[Lyase]]s: cleave various bonds by means other than hydrolysis and oxidation
*EC 5, [[Isomerase]]s: catalyze [[isomer]]ization changes within a single molecule
*EC 6, [[Ligase]]s: join two molecules with [[covalent bond]]s.

These sections are subdivided by other features such as the substrate, products, and [[chemical mechanism]]. An enzyme is fully specified by four numerical designations. For example, [[hexokinase]] (EC 2.7.1.1) is a transferase (EC 2) that adds a phosphate group (EC 2.7) to a hexose sugar, a molecule containing an alcohol group (EC 2.7.1).<ref>{{cite web|title=EC 2.7.1.1|url=http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/EC2/7/1/1.html | author = Nomenclature Committee | work = International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (NC-IUBMB) | publisher = School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary, University of London }}</ref>

== Industrial applications ==
Enzymes are used in the [[chemical industry]] and other industrial applications when extremely specific catalysts are required. Enzymes in general are limited in the number of reactions they have evolved to catalyze and also by their lack of stability in [[organic solvent]]s and at high temperatures. As a consequence, [[protein engineering]] is an active area of research and involves attempts to create new enzymes with novel properties, either through rational design or ''in vitro'' evolution.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Renugopalakrishnan V, Garduño-Juárez R, Narasimhan G, Verma CS, Wei X, Li P | title = Rational design of thermally stable proteins: relevance to bionanotechnology | journal = Journal of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology | volume = 5 | issue = 11 | pages = 1759–1767 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16433409 | doi = 10.1166/jnn.2005.441 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hult K, Berglund P | title = Engineered enzymes for improved organic synthesis | journal = Current Opinion in Biotechnology | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 395–400 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12943848 | doi = 10.1016/S0958-1669(03)00095-8 }}</ref> These efforts have begun to be successful, and a few enzymes have now been designed "from scratch" to catalyze reactions that do not occur in nature.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jiang L, Althoff EA, Clemente FR, Doyle L, Röthlisberger D, Zanghellini A, Gallaher JL, Betker JL, Tanaka F, Barbas CF, Hilvert D, Houk KN, Stoddard BL, Baker D | title = De novo computational design of retro-aldol enzymes | journal = Science | volume = 319 | issue = 5868 | pages = 1387–91 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18323453 | pmc = 3431203 | doi = 10.1126/science.1152692 }}</ref>
