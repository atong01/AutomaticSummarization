A '''deed poll''' (plural: '''deeds poll''') is a [[Law|legal]] document binding only to a single person or several persons acting jointly to express an active intention. It is, strictly speaking, not a [[contract]] because it binds only one [[party (law)|party]] and expresses an intention instead of a promise.

The most common use is a [[name change]] through a [[deed of change of name]] {{fact|date=July 2014}} (often referred to simply as a ''deed poll''). Deeds poll are used for this purpose in countries including the [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]]. In the UK, a deed poll can also be used to change a child's name, as long as everyone with parental responsibility for the child consents to it and the child does not object to it.<ref>{{cite web|title=Changing your name|url=http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/england/relationships_e/relationships_birth_certificates_and_changing_your_name_e/changing_your_name.htm|website=AdviceGuide UK|accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> The child's parents execute the deed poll on the child's behalf. In some other jurisdictions, a person may simply start using a new name without any formal legal process. The usual requirements are that the new name must be used exclusively and that the change must not be made with intent to [[fraud|defraud]]. In [[Australia]], name change was formerly accomplished by deed poll but now is done by completing a Change of Name form.

Another common use is to [[Partition (law)|partition]] land into different sections. For example, a piece of land may be partitioned (or carved out) by a deed poll into Section A and the Remaining Portion thereof. This form of deed poll is commonly used in [[Hong Kong]].

==Origin of the term==
The term "deed", also known in this context as a "specialty", is common to signed written undertakings not supported by consideration: the seal (even if not a literal wax seal but only a notional one referred to by the execution formula, "signed, sealed and delivered", or even merely "executed as a deed") is deemed to be the consideration necessary to support the obligation. "Poll" is an [[Archaism|archaic]] legal term referring to documents with straight edges; these distinguished a deed binding only one person from one affecting more than a single person (an "[[indenture]]", so named during the time when such agreements would be written out repeatedly on a single sheet, then the copies separated by being irregularly torn or cut, i.e. "indented", so that each party had a document with corresponding tears, to discourage [[forgery]]).
