Arianespace shareholding is currently being restructured with the creation of an Airbus-Safran joint venture that will develop and manufacture the Ariane 6 launcher. Their subsidiaries shareholdings will be pooled along with the purchase of the French governments CNES stake. Airbus-Safran once the restructure is complete will have a 76% shareholding while the remaining 24% will be spread across ten countries.<ref>http://www.satellitetoday.com/launch/2015/06/16/airbus-safran-launchers-gains-cnes-35-percent-stake-in-arianespace/</ref>

==Competition and pricing==
{{main|Space launch market competition}}

The disruptive force represented in new sector entrant [[SpaceX]], forced Arianespace to cut workforce, and focus on cost-cutting, to decrease costs to remain competitive against the new low-cost entrant in the launch sector. According to one Arianespace managing director, ""It's quite clear there's a very significant challenge coming from [[SpaceX]]," he said. "Therefore things have to change … and the whole European industry is being restructured, consolidated, rationalised and streamlined."<ref name=SMH-2015-05-19>{{cite news |url= http://www.smh.com.au/business/nbn-launcher-arianespace-to-cut-jobs-and-costs-to-fight-spacex-20150519-gh4i4x.html |title= NBN launcher Arianespace to cut jobs and costs to fight SpaceX |date= 19 May 2015 |author= David Ramli |publisher= The Sydney Morning Herald (Australia) }}</ref>

In the midst of [[competition (economics)|pricing pressure]] from U.S. company [[SpaceX]], Arianespace made a November 2013 announcement of pricing flexibility for the "lighter satellites" it carries to [[Geostationary transfer orbit|Geostationary]] orbits aboard its Ariane 5.<ref name=sn20131125>

In early 2014, Arianespace requested additional subsidies from European governments to face the competition from SpaceX and unfavorable changes in the Euro-Dollar exchange rate.<ref name=aw20140211>{{cite news |last=Svitak|first=Amy |title=Arianespace To ESA: We Need Help |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=/article-xml/awx_02_11_2014_p0-663010.xml |accessdate=2014-02-12 |newspaper=Aviation Week |date=2014-02-11 }}</ref> Reducing pricing allowed Arianespace to sign four additional contracts in September 2014 for a lower slots on an Ariane 5 SYLDA dispenser for the satellites that otherwise could be flown on SpaceX launch vehicle. Overall Arianespace signed 11 contracts in 2014 until September with two additional being in a late stage of negotiations. {{As of|2014|September}} Arianespace has a backlog of launches worth {{Euro|4.5}} billion with 38 satellites to be launched on [[Ariane 5]], 7 on [[Soyuz at the Guiana Space Centre|Soyuz]] and 9 on [[Vega (rocket)|Vega]], claiming 60% of global satellite launch market.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1409/08ariane5contracts/|title=Arianespace nets four commercial launch contracts|date=8 September 2014|accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.arianespace.com/news-press-release/2014/9-8-2014-Euroconsult2014.asp|title=World Satellite Business Week 2014: A rich harvest of contracts for Arianespace|date=8 September 2014|accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2014/09/08/europes-arianespace-claims-60-of-the-commercial-launch-market/|title=Europe's Arianespace Claims 60% Of The Commercial Launch Market|date=9 September 2014|accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref>
By November 2014, SpaceX had "already begun to take market share"<ref name=sn20141120/> from Arianespace, and [[Eutelsat]] CEO [[Michel de Rosen]]—a major customer of Arianespace—said that "Each year that passes will see SpaceX advance, gain market share and further reduce its costs through [[economies of scale]]."<ref name=sn20141120/>
