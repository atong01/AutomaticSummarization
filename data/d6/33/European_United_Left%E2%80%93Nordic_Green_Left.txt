'''European United Left/Nordic Green Left''' ('''GUE/NGL''') is a [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[Political groups of the European Parliament|political group]] in the [[European Parliament]],<ref name="Staab2011">{{cite book|author=Andreas Staab|title=The European Union Explained, Second Edition: Institutions, Actors, Global Impact|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gePMlsVzZI0C&pg=PA67|accessdate=5 August 2013|date=24 June 2011|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-00164-1|page=67}}</ref> established in 1995.

==Position==
According to its 1994 constituent declaration, the group is opposed to the present European political structure, but committed to integration.<ref name="EULNGLConDec"/> That declaration sets out three aims for the construction of another European Union: the total change of institutions to make them "fully democratic"; and breaking with "neo-liberal monetarist policies"; and a policy of co-development and equitable cooperation. The group wants to disband the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) and "strengthen the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]" (OSCE).

The group is ambiguous between reformism and revolution, leaving it up to each party to decide on the manner they deem best suited to achieve these aims. As such, it has simultaneously positioned itself as "insiders" within the European institutions, enabling it to influence the decisions made by co-decision, and as "outsiders" by its willingness to seek "another Union" which would abolish the [[Maastricht Treaty]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Organisation==
The GUE/NGL is a confederal group: it is composed of [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] from national parties. Those national parties must share common political objectives with the group, as specified in the group's constituent declaration. Nevertheless, those national parties, not the group, retain control of their MEPs. Thus, the Group may be divided on certain issues.

Members of the group meet regularly to prepare for meetings, debate on policies and vote on resolutions. The group also publishes reports on various topics.

===Member parties===
[[File:GUE NGL after 2014 elections.png|thumb|250px|right|Member states with one MEP in GUE/NGL in pink, with two or more members in red]]
MEPs may be full or associate members.
* Full members must accept the constitutional declaration of the Group.
* Associate members need not fully do so but may sit with the full members.

National parties may be full or associate members.
* Full member parties must accept the constitutional declaration of the Group.
* Associate member parties may include parties that do not have MEPs (e.g., French Trotskyist parties which did not get elected in the 2004 European elections), are from states that are not part of the European Union, or do not wish to be full members.

==History==
In 1995, the enlargement of the [[European Union]] led to the creation of the [[Nordic Green Left Alliance|Nordic Green Left]] group of parties. The Nordic Green Left merged with the [[European United Left (1994–95)|Confederal Group of the European United Left]] (GUE) on 6 January 1995,<ref name="t1s4"/> forming the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left.<ref name="t1s5"/><ref name="t1s6"/><ref name="t1s40"/> The NGL suffix was added to the name of the expanded group on insistence of Swedish and Finnish MEPs.<ref name="RaunioTiilikainen2013">{{cite book|author1=Tapio Raunio|author2=Teija Tiilikainen|title=Finland in the European Union|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wzkF4lCzIJ4C&pg=PA59|date=5 September 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-76204-9|page=59}}</ref> The group initially consisted of MEPs from the Finnish [[Left Alliance (Finland)|Left Alliance]], Swedish [[Left Party (Sweden)|Left Party]], the Danish [[Socialist People's Party (Denmark)|Socialist People's Party]], [[United Left (Spain)|United Left of Spain]] (including the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Spanish Communist Party]]), [[Coalition of Left, of Movements and Ecology|Synaspismós]] of Greece, the [[French Communist Party]], [[Portuguese Communist Party]], the [[Communist Party of Greece]], and the [[Communist Refoundation Party]] of Italy.

In 1999, the German [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]] (PDS) and the Greek [[Democratic Social Movement]] (DIKKI) joined as full members, while the five MEPs elected from the list of the French Trotskyist alliance [[Workers' Struggle|LO]]-[[Revolutionary Communist League (France)|LCR]] joined as associate members.

In 2002, four MEPs from the French [[Citizen and Republican Movement]] also joined the group.

In 2004, no MEPs were elected from LO-LCR and DIKKI was dissolved. MEPs from the Portuguese [[Left Bloc]], [[Sinn Féin]] both from the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, the [[Progressive Party of Working People]] (AKEL) of Cyprus, and the [[Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia]] joined the group.
