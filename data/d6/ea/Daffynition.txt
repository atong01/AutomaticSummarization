A '''daffynition''' (derived from ''[[wikt:daffy|daffy]]'' and ''[[definition]]'') is a [[pun]] format involving the reinterpretation of an existing word, on the basis that it sounds like another word (or group of words). They are similar to [[transpositional puns]], but often much less complex and easier to create.   
Some daffynitions may be puns. For example, "a [[hangover]] is the wrath of [[grapes]]" is a play on the title of the book ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]''. A subclass of daffynition is the goofinition which relies strictly on literal associations and correct spellings, such as "lobster = a weak tennis player".

Under the name '''Uxbridge English Dictionary''' making up daffynitions is a popular game on the [[BBC Radio 4]] [[comedy]] [[quiz show]] ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]].
