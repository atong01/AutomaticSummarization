The '''northern cavefish''' or '''northern blindfish''', ''Amblyopsis spelaea'', is found in caves through [[Kentucky]] and southern [[Indiana]]. It is listed as a threatened species in the United States and the [[IUCN]] lists the species as vulnerable.

During a 2013 study of ''Amblyopsis spelaea'', scientists found that the species was divided into two distinct evolutionary lineages: one north of the [[Ohio River]], in Indiana, and one south of the river, in [[Kentucky]].  The southern population retained the name ''A. spelaea'' and the northern was re-designated ''[[Amblyopsis hoosieri]]'' in a 2014 paper published in the journal ''[[ZooKeys]]''.<ref name="ZooKeys">{{cite journal |last=Chakrabarty |first=Prosanta |last2=Prejean |first2=Jacques A. |last3=Niemiller |first3=Matthew L. |date=May 29, 2014 |title=The Hoosier cavefish, a new and endangered species (Amblyopsidae, ''Amblyopsis'') from the caves of southern Indiana |url=http://zookeys.pensoft.net/articles.php?id=3824 |journal=[[ZooKeys]] |publisher=Pensoft |issue=412 |pages=41-57 |doi=10.3897/zookeys.412.7245 |accessdate=January 23, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Howard |first=Brian Clark |date=May 30, 2014 |title=Blind Hoosier Cavefish: Freshwater Species of the Week |url=http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2014/05/30/blind-hoosier-cavefish-freshwater-species-of-the-week/ |website=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |accessdate=January 23, 2015 }}</ref> Neither species is found north of the [[White River (Indiana)|White River]], flowing east to west south of [[Bedford, Indiana]].
