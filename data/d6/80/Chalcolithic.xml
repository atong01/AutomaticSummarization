Originally the term &quot;Bronze Age&quot; meant that either copper or bronze was being used as the chief hard substance for the manufacture of tools and weapons. In 1881,<space/><link><target>John Evans (archaeologist)</target><part>John Evans</part></link>, recognizing that the use of copper often preceded the use of bronze, distinguished between a transitional Copper Age and the Bronze Age proper. He did not include this transitional period in the tripartite system of Early, Middle and Late Bronze Age but placed it at the beginning outside of it. He did not, however, present it as a fourth age, but chose to retain the traditional<space/><link><target>three-age system</target></link>.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">June 2015</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>In 1884, Gaetano Chierici, perhaps following the lead of Evans, renamed it in Italian as the<space/><italics>Eneo-litica</italics>, or &quot;Bronze-stone&quot; transition. This phrase was never intended to mean that the period was one in which both bronze and stone were used. The Copper Age features the use of copper, excluding bronze; moreover, stone continued to be used throughout both the Bronze Age and the Iron Age. &quot;Litica&quot; simply names the Stone Age as the point from which the transition began and is not another -lithic age. The Eneolithic was never part of the Stone Age, which ended conclusively the moment the first smelter succeeded in obtaining copper from copper ore for the first time.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">June 2015</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Subsequently British scholars used either Evans's &quot;Copper Age&quot; or the term &quot;Eneolithic&quot; (or Aeneolithic), a translation of Chierici's<space/><italics>eneo-litica</italics>. After several years, a number of complaints appeared in the literature that &quot;Eneolithic&quot; seemed to the untrained eye to be produced from e-neolithic, &quot;outside the Neolithic,&quot; clearly not a definitive characterization of the Copper Age. About the year 1900, many writers began to substitute &quot;Chalcolithic&quot; for Eneolithic, to avoid the false segmentation. It was at this time that the misunderstanding began among those who had not understood the Italian. The -lithic was seen as a new -lithic age, a part of the Stone Age in which copper was used, which may appear paradoxical. Today Copper Age, Eneolithic and Chalcolithic are used synonymously to mean Evans's original definition of Copper Age.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">June 2015</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>The period is a transitional one, but does not stand outside the traditional<space/><link><target>three-age system</target></link>. The analysing stone tool assemblages from sites on the Tehran Plain in Iran has illustrated the effects of the introduction of copper working technologies on the in place systems of lithic craft specialists and raw materials. Networks of exchange and specialized processing and production that had evolved during the Neolithic seem to have collapsed by the Middle Chalcolithic (<italics>c</italics><space/>4500-3500 BCE) and been replaced by the use of local materials by a primarily household base production of stone tools.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite journal</target><arg name="last1">Fazeli</arg><arg name="first1">H.</arg><arg name="last2">Donahue</arg><arg name="first2">R.E.</arg><arg name="last3">Coningham</arg><arg name="first3">R.A.E.</arg><arg name="title">Stone Tool Production, Distribution and Use during the Late Neolithic and Chalcolithic on the Tehran Plain, Iran</arg><arg name="journal">Journal of Persian Studies</arg><arg name="date">2002</arg><arg name="volume">40</arg><arg name="pages">1–14</arg><arg name="jstor">4300616</arg></template></extension><space/>It appears that copper was not widely exploited at first, and that efforts in alloying it with<space/><link><target>tin</target></link><space/>and other metals began quite soon, making it difficult to distinguish the distinct Chalcolithic cultures from later periods.
