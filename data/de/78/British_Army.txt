The '''British Army''' is the principal [[Army|land warfare force]] of the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]. The force was initially administered by the [[War Office]] from London, which in 1964 was subsumed into the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]. The professional head of the British Army is the [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the General Staff]].

The full-time element of the British Army is referred to as the ''Regular Army'' and has been since the creation of the reservist ''[[Territorial Force]]'' in 1908. All members of the British Army swear (or affirm) allegiance to the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch]] as [[commander-in-chief]]. However, the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights of 1689]] requires Parliamentary consent for [[The Crown]] to maintain a [[standing army]] in peacetime. Parliament approves the continued existence of the Army by passing an [[Armed Forces Act]] at least once every five years. In contrast to the [[Royal Navy]], [[Royal Marines]] and [[Royal Air Force]], the British Army does not include ''Royal'' in its title because, after a [[English Civil War|historic struggle]] between Parliament and monarchy, the British Army has always been answerable to Parliament rather than the Monarch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nam.ac.uk/about-us |title=National Army Museum: about us |publisher=Nam.ac.uk |date=8 September 2011 |accessdate=13 September 2013}}</ref> Many of the Army's constituent regiments and corps have been granted the "Royal" prefix and have members of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] occupying senior honorary positions within some regiments.

Throughout its history, the British Army has seen action in a number of major wars involving the world's [[great power]]s, including the [[Seven Years' War]], the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the [[Crimean War]], the [[World War I|First World War]] and [[World War II|Second World War]]. Repeatedly emerging victorious from these decisive wars allowed Britain to influence world events with its policies and establish itself as one of the world's leading military and economic powers. Since the end of the [[Cold war]], the British Army has been deployed to many conflict zones, often as part of an [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary force]] or a [[United Nations peacekeeping]] operation. Additionally, the British Army maintains several [[British Army#Permanent overseas postings|permanent overseas postings]].

== History ==
{{Main|History of the British Army}}
[[File:John Churchill Marlborough porträtterad av Adriaen van der Werff (1659-1722).jpg|thumb|[[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough]], was one of the first generals in the British Army, fighting campaigns in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].]]

The English Army was first established as a standing military force in 1660.<ref>Mallinson, p.2</ref> In 1707 many regiments of the English and Scottish armies were already combined under one operational command and stationed in the Netherlands fighting in the [[War of Spanish Succession]]. Consequently, although the regiments were now part of the new British military establishment, they remained under the same operational command, and so not only were the regiments of the old armies transferred ''in situ'' to the new army so too was the institutional ethos, customs, and traditions, of the old standing armies that had been created shortly after the [[restoration (England)|restoration of the monarchy]] 66 years earlier. The order of seniority of the most senior line regiments in the British Army is based on the order of seniority in the English army. Scottish and Irish regiments were only allowed to take a rank in the English army from the date of their arrival in England or the date when they were first placed on the English establishment. For example, in 1694 a board of general officers was convened to decide the rank of English, Irish and Scots regiments serving in the Netherlands; the regiment that became known as the [[Scots Greys]] were designated as the 4th Dragoons because there were three English regiments raised prior to 1688 when the Scots Greys were first placed on the English establishment. In 1713, when a new board of general officers was convened to decide upon the rank of several regiments, the seniority of the Scots Greys was reassessed and based on their entry into England in June 1685. At that time there was only one English regiment of dragoons, and so after some delay the Scots Greys obtained the rank of 2nd Dragoons in the British Army.{{sfn|Royal Scots Greys|1840|pp=56–57}}

Following William and Mary's accession to the throne, England involved itself in the [[War of the Grand Alliance]], primarily to prevent a French invasion restoring Mary's father, [[James II of England|James II]].<ref>{{harvnb|Miller|2000|p=144}}</ref> Following the [[Acts of Union 1707|union of England and Scotland]] in 1707, and the creation of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] in 1801, British foreign policy on the continent was to contain expansion by its competitor powers such as France and Spain. Spain, in the previous two centuries, had been the dominant global power, and the chief threat to England's early transatlantic ambitions, but was now waning. The territorial ambitions of the French, however, led to the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]<ref>{{harvnb|Mallinson|2009|p=50}}.</ref> and the [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref name=ma165/> Russian activity led to the [[Crimean War]].<ref name=ma195/> After 1745, recruits were increasingly drawn from Scotland; by the mid-1760s between one fifth and one third of officers were from Scotland.<ref>''The Oxford Illustrated History of the British Army'' (1994) p. 103 {{full|date=September 2014}}</ref>

From the time of the end of the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1763, Great Britain, and its successor, the United Kingdom, was one of the leading military and [[Economic history of the United Kingdom|economic powers]] of the world.{{sfn|Aptheker|1960|p=26}}

=== Early British Empire ===
[[File:The Battle of Culloden.jpg|thumb|The extinction of the [[Scottish clan]] system came with the defeat of the clansmen at the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746]]
The [[British Empire]] expanded in this time to include colonies, [[protectorate]]s, and [[Dominion]]s throughout the Americas, Africa, Asia and [[Australasia]]. Although the [[Royal Navy]] is widely regarded as having been vital for the rise of the [[British Empire]], and British dominance of the world, the British Army played an important role in the colonisation of India and other regions.<ref>{{harvnb|Mallinson|2009|p=104}}.</ref> Typical tasks included [[garrison]]ing the colonies, capturing strategically important territories, and participating in actions to pacify colonial borders, provide support to allied governments, suppress Britain's rivals, and protect against foreign powers and hostile natives.

[[File:Benjamin West 005.jpg|thumb|left|The death of [[James Wolfe|General Wolfe]] during the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]]; the campaigns of the [[French and Indian War]] resulted in British control of modern Canada.]]
British soldiers also helped capture strategically important territories, allowing the empire to expand. The army was also involved in numerous wars to pacify the borders, or to prop up friendly governments, and thereby keep other, competitive, empires away from the British Empire's borders. Among these actions were the [[Seven Years' War]],<ref name=ma106>{{harvnb|Mallinson|2009|p=106}}.</ref> the [[American Revolutionary War]],<ref>{{harvnb|Mallinson|2009|p=129}}.</ref> the [[Napoleonic Wars]],<ref name=ma165>{{harvnb|Mallinson|2009|p=165}}.</ref> the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]]s,<ref name=ma102>{{harvnb|Mallinson|2009|p=102}}.</ref> the [[Boxer Rebellion]],<ref name=boxer>{{harvnb|Bates|2010|p=25}}.</ref> the [[New Zealand wars]],<ref name=nz>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil.nz/culture-and-history/nz-army-history/historical-chronology/1827.htm |title=New Zealand Army: Timeline |publisher=Army.mil.nz |date=19 December 2008 |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref> the [[Sepoy Rebellion of 1857]],<ref name=ma210>{{harvnb|Mallinson|2009|p=210}}.</ref> the [[First Boer War|First]] and [[Second Boer War]]s,<ref name=ma257>{{harvnb|Mallinson|2009|p=257}}.</ref> the [[Fenian raids]],<ref name=fenian>{{cite web|url=http://www.doyle.com.au/fenian_raids.htm |title=The Fenian Raids |publisher=Doyle.com.au |date=15 September 2001 |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref> the [[Irish War of Independence]],<ref name=ma102>{{harvnb|Mallinson|2009|p=282}}.</ref> its serial interventions into [[Afghanistan]] (which were meant to maintain a friendly [[buffer state]] between British India and the [[Russian Empire]]),<ref>{{harvnb|Mallinson|2009|p=203}}.</ref> and the [[Crimean War]] (to keep the Russian Empire at a safe distance by coming to Turkey's aid).<ref name=ma195>{{harvnb|Mallinson|2009|p=195}}.</ref>

As had its predecessor, the [[English Army]], the British Army fought Spain, France, and the [[Netherlands]] for supremacy in North America and the [[West Indies]]. With native and provincial assistance, the Army conquered [[New France]] in the [[French and Indian War|North American theatre]] of the [[Seven Years' War]]<ref name=ma106/> and subsequently suppressed a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] uprising in [[Pontiac's War]].<ref>[http://www.umbc.edu/che/tahlessons/pdf/Pontiacs_War(PrinterFriendly).pdf Pontiac’s War] Baltimore County Public Schools</ref> The British Army suffered defeat in the [[American War of Independence]], losing the [[Thirteen Colonies]] but holding on to Canada.<ref>{{harvnb|Mallinson|2009|p=110}}.</ref>

The British Army was heavily involved in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and served in multiple campaigns across Europe (including continuous deployment in the [[Peninsular War]]), the [[Caribbean]], North Africa and later in [[War of 1812|North America]]. The war between the British and the [[First French Empire]] of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] stretched around the world and at its peak, in 1813, the regular army contained over 250,000 men. A Coalition of Anglo-Dutch and Prussian Armies under the [[Duke of Wellington]] and [[Field Marshal von Blücher]] defeated Napoleon at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815.<ref>{{harvnb|Mallinson|2009|p=177}}.</ref>

The English had been involved, both politically and militarily, in Ireland since being given the [[Lordship of Ireland]] by the Pope in 1171. The campaign of the English republican Protector, [[Oliver Cromwell]], involved uncompromising treatment of the Irish towns (most notably [[Drogheda]] and [[Wexford]]) that had supported the Royalists during the English Civil War. The English Army (and subsequently the British Army) stayed in Ireland primarily to suppress numerous Irish revolts and campaigns for independence. In addition to its ongoing conflict with ethnic Irish nationalists, it was faced with the prospect of battling Anglo-Irish and [[Ulster-Scots|Ulster Scots]] peoples in Ireland, angered primarily by unfavourable taxation of Irish produce imported into Britain, who, alongside other Irish groups, had raised their own volunteer army and threatened to emulate the American colonists if their conditions were not met. Having learnt from their experience in America, the British government sought a political solution. The British Army found itself fighting Irish rebels, both Protestant and Catholic, primarily in [[Ulster]] and [[Leinster]] ([[Theobald Wolfe Tone|Wolfe Tone's]] [[United Irishmen]]) in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 rebellion]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/irish_reb_01.shtml The 1798 Irish Rebellion] BBC</ref>

The vastly increasing demands of imperial expansion, and the inadequacies and inefficiencies of the underfunded, post-Napoleonic Wars British Army, and of the [[Militia (United Kingdom)|Militia]], [[Yeomanry]], and [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]], led to the [[Cardwell Reforms|Cardwell]] and [[Childers Reforms]] of the late 19th century, which gave the British Army its modern shape, and redefined its [[regimental system]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=24992|supp=|startpage=3300|date=1 July 1881|accessdate=13 December 2010}}</ref> The [[Haldane Reforms]] of 1907 formally created the [[Territorial Force]] as the Army's volunteer reserve component by merging and reorganising the Volunteer Force, Militia, and Yeomanry.<ref>{{harvnb|Cassidy|2006|p=79}}.</ref>

Great Britain's dominance of the world had been challenged by numerous other powers; in the 20th century, most notably [[German Empire|Germany]]. A century before, it was still vying with Napoleonic France for pre-eminence in Europe and around the world, and Hannoverian Britain's natural allies were the various Kingdoms and principalities of [[Northern Germany]]. By the middle of the 19th century, Britain and France were allied in preventing Russia's appropriation of the [[Ottoman Empire]] (although it was the fear of French invasion that led, shortly after, to the creation of the [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]]). By the first decade of the 20th century, however, the United Kingdom was allied with France (by the [[Entente Cordiale]]) and Russia (which had its own secret agreement with France of mutual support in any war against the [[Prussia]]n-led [[German Empire]] and the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]), and when the [[World War I|First World War]] broke out in 1914, the British Army sent the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) to [[Western Front (World War I)|France and Belgium]] to prevent Germany from occupying these countries.<ref>{{harvnb|Ensor|1980|pp=525–526}}.</ref> The British Army created the [[Mediterranean Expeditionary Force]] in Egypt and sent it to [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] in an unsuccessful attempt to capture [[Constantinople]] and secure a sea route to [[Russian Empire|Russia]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=3}} After the retreat from Gallipoli nearly 400,000 men in 13 divisions from the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force and the Force in Egypt formed a strategic reserve in Egypt called the Egyptian Expeditionary Force.<ref>Keogh 1955, p. 32</ref><ref>Wavell 1968, p. 41</ref> With most of the strategic reserve sent to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], an Egyptian Expeditionary Force of two British infantry and one Australian and [[New Zealand]] mounted division in the Eastern Force, successfully defend the [[Suez Canal]] and [[Battle of Romani|Romani]] in 1916 from [[German Empire|German]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] incursions.<ref>Powles 1922, p. 50</ref><ref>Falls 1930 Vol. 1, pp. 380–406</ref> This force captured the [[Sinai]] and garrisoned the extended [[lines of communication]], but in early 1917 their advance was stopped at [[Gaza City|Gaza]] until towards the end of the year when a greatly enlarged force of infantry and mounted troops captured [[Battle of Beersheba (1917)|Beersheba]], [[Battle of Mughar Ridge|most of southern Palestine]] and [[Battle of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]]. Allenby's force, now including [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]] units which replaced a number of British units sent to the Western Front, captured the southern [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] in 1918 and carried out two major, but unsuccessful attacks to [[First Transjordan attack on Amman (1918)|Amman]] and [[Second Transjordan attack on Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt (1918)|Es Salt]] and [[Occupation of the Jordan Valley (1918)|occupied]] part of the Jordan Valley, during preparations for his final successful assault in September at the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]].

The First World War was the most devastating in [[Military history of the United Kingdom|British military history]], with nearly 800,000 men killed and over 2&nbsp;million wounded. In the early part of the war, the professional force of the BEF was virtually destroyed and, by turns, a [[Kitchener's Army|volunteer]] (and then [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|conscripted]]) force replaced it.

In the three decades following 1969, the Army was heavily deployed in [[Northern Ireland]], to support the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (later the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]]) in their conflict with republican paramilitary groups, called [[Operation Banner]].<ref>{{harvnb|Mallinson|2009|p=411}}.</ref> The locally recruited [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] was formed, later becoming home service battalions in the [[The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling) 83rd and 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)|Royal Irish Regiment]] in 1992, before being disbanded in 2006.

The British Army is purely a professional force since [[National service]] came to an end. The full-time element of the British Army is referred to as the ''Regular Army'' since the creation of the reservist ''[[Territorial Force]]'' in 1908.

The size and structure of the British Army is continually evolving. Accordingly, the Ministry of Defence publishes monthly reports on personnel.<ref>PA - [http://www.skynews.com.au/news/world/europe/2015/07/29/british-army-sheds-more-than-20-000-early.html article: 07.29.2015] published by ''Sky News'' 12:18 pm, Wednesday, 29 July 2015 [Retrieved 2015-07-29]</ref> Figures reported on 29 July 2015 reveal there is 81,700 full-time army service personnel (according to the same report, during 2010, there were 102,260).<ref>Emma Atkinson - [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-33638492 article (29.07.2015)] published by British Broadcasting Corporation  [Retrieved 2015-07-29]</ref> Figures for 1 January 2015 show; 87,140 Regulars, 2,720 [[Brigade of Gurkhas|Gurkhas]]<ref name="Regular & Gurkha">[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/402652/MPR_January_2015.pdf gov.uk MoD - regular personnel], table 2-page 8. 1 January 2015.</ref> and 25,010 [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Army Reservists]]<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/402633/quarterly_personnel_report_jan15.pdf gov.uk MoD - quarterly personnel report], table 3 page 8. 1 January 2015.</ref> for a combined component strength of 114,870 personnel. Of those Regulars and Gurkhas; 80,590 and 2,650 were trained, respectively.<ref name="Regular & Gurkha"/>

The future transformation of the British Army is referred to as "[[Future of the British Army (Army 2020)|Army 2020]]", which is the result of the [[Strategic Defence and Security Review]] (SDSR) in October 2010 and a number of following reviews and modifications thereafter. According to the Ministry of Defence, Army 2020 will "ensure that the British Army remains the most capable Army in its class" and enable "it to better meet the security challenges of the 2020s and beyond".<ref>[http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/Army2020_brochure.pdf Transforming The British Army] July 2012</ref> Initially, the SDSR outlined a reduction of the Regular British Army by 7,000 to a trained strength of 95,000 personnel by 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_191634.pdf?CID=PDF&PLA=furl&CRE=sdsr |title=October 2010 SDSR |date= |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref> However, following a further independent review on the future structure of the British Army, "Future Reserves 2020",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/88_FutureReserves_2020_(1).pdf |title=Future Reserves 2020 – The Independent Commission to review the United Kingdom's Reserve Forces |format=PDF |date=18 July 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref> it was announced that the Regular Army will be reduced to a trained strength of 82,000 while the Army Reserve will be increased to a trained strength of around 30,000 personnel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/army-cuts-hundreds-more-soldiers-to-lose-jobs-9079073.html |title=Army cuts: Hundreds more soldiers to lose jobs |newspaper=The Independent |date= 23 January 2014 |author=Emma Clark |accessdate= 12 November 2014}}</ref> There will of course be an added margin for soldiers in training.

In addition to the active elements of the British Army (Regular and Army Reserve), all ex-Regular Army personnel remain liable to be recalled for duty in [[Total war|a time of need]], this is known as the [[Regular Reserve (United Kingdom)|Regular Reserve]].<ref name="Ragular-Reserve">[http://www.army.mod.uk/reserve/31789.aspx British Army: Regular Reserve], 27 January 2014</ref> The Regular Reserve is separated into two categories: A and D. Category A is mandatory, with the length of time serving in category A depending on time spent in Regular service. Category D is voluntary and consists of personnel who are no-longer required to serve in category A. Regular Reserves in both category A and D serve under a fixed-term reserve contract and are liable to report for training or service overseas and at home.<ref name="Ragular-Reserve"/> These contracts are similar in nature to those of the Army Reserve.<ref>[http://www.dasa.mod.uk/publications/personnel/military/reserves-and-cadets-strengths/2013-04-01/2013.pdf dasa.mod – reserves and cadet strengths], table 3-page 13 – read note 2. April 2013.</ref> The Long Term  reserve is also part of the Regular Reserve but excludes personnel serving in categories A and D. Unlike the other reserves the Long Term  reserve do not serve under a contract of any sort, instead they retain a "statutory liability for service" and may be recalled to service under Section 52 of the Reserve Forces Act (RFA) 1996 (until the age of 55).<ref name="Ragular-Reserve"/> In 2007 there were 121,800 Regular Reserves of the British Army, of which, 33,760 served in categories A and D.<ref>[http://www.dasa.mod.uk/publications/personnel/military/reserves-and-cadets-strengths/2012-04-01/2012-revised.pdf dasa.mod – reserves and cadet strengths], table 3-page 5. April 2012.</ref>

Publications since April 2013 no longer report the entire strength of the Regular Reserve, instead they only give a figure for the Regular Reserves serving in categories A and D only. They had a reported strength of 30,030 personnel in 2014.<ref name="DASA-Reserves">[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/314795/uk_reserve_force_cadets_2014.pdf gov.uk MoD – reserves and cadet strengths], table 3-page 12. April 2014.</ref>

The table below shows historical personnel trends of the British Army from 1750 to 2014. The Army Reserve – or Territorial Army, as it was known then – did not come into existence until 1908.<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/RP00-99.pdf Defence personnel statistics], (Library House of Commons) Page 8.</ref>{{sfn|Summers|2011}}{{sfn|SMH Military correspondent|1939|p=5}}<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1950/mar/20/territorial-army-recruitment Hansard 20 March 1950] Size of the Territorial Army 1950.</ref><ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1960/jul/20/the-territorial-army Hansard, THE TERRITORIAL ARMY] 20 July 1960.</ref><ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1970/mar/12/army-estimates-1970-71-vote-a Hansard, ARMY ESTIMATES] March 1970.</ref><ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/rp98/rp98-120.pdf Defence Statistics 1998] Table 7, years 1980 and 1990.</ref><ref>[http://www.dasa.mod.uk/publications/personnel/military/reserves-and-cadets-strengths/2012-04-01/2012-revised.pdf UK Reserve Forces Strengths, years 1995–2000] (Download PDF).</ref><ref>[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140116142443/http://www.dasa.mod.uk/publications/personnel/military/monthly-personnel-report/2009-05-01-1-may-2009-to-1-october-2011-compendium/1-may-2009-to-1-october-2011-compendium.pdf UK Armed Forces Revised Monthly Personnel Compendium: 1 May 2009 to 1 October 2011 (Archive)], dasa.mod.uk</ref>

=== Equipment ===
{{main|Modern equipment of the British Army}}

'''Infantry'''
The basic infantry weapon of the British Army is the [[SA80|L85A2]] assault rifle, sometimes equipped with an [[L17A2 UGL|L17A2]] underbarrel grenade launcher. The rifle has several variants, such as the [[L86 LSW|L86A2]], the Light Support Weapon (LSW), and the L22A2 carbine issued to tank crews. Support fire is provided by the [[FN Minimi]] light machine gun and the [[L7 (machine gun)|L7 General Purpose Machine Gun]] (GPMG); indirect fire by [[British 51&nbsp;mm Mortar|51]] and [[L16 81mm Mortar|81&nbsp;mm mortars]]. Sniper rifles used include the [[L118A1]]&nbsp;7.62&nbsp;mm, the [[L115A3]] and the [[AW50F]], all produced by [[Accuracy International]]. Some units use the [[M82 Barrett rifle|L82A1]]&nbsp;.50 calibre Barrett sniper rifle. More recently, the [[L128A1]] (Benelli M4) 'combat shotgun' has been adopted, and is intended for close quarters combat in Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/support-weapons/17927.aspx |title=Combat Shotgun – British Army Website |publisher=Army.mod.uk |date= |accessdate=22 October 2010|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKgzKZWI |archivedate = 18 November 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2009/04/10/british-armys-new-combat-shotgun/ |title=British Army's new combat shotgun |publisher=The Firearm Blog |date=10 April 2009 |accessdate=22 October 2010|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKgzjJBU |archivedate = 18 November 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref>

'''Armour'''
The British Army's [[main battle tank]] is the [[Challenger 2]].<ref>[http://www.baesystems.com/ProductsServices/l_and_a_ls_challenger.html Challenger 2] BA Systems</ref><ref>[http://www.dasa.mod.uk/publications/equipment/CFE-vehicles-and-aircraft/2013/2013.pdf "UKDS 2013"]</ref> Other armoured vehicles include the [[MWMIK|Supacat "Jackal" MWMIK]] and the [[Iveco LMV|Iveco "Panther" CLV]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defense-update.com/products/m/MLV.htm |title=Multi-role Light Vehicle |publisher=Defense-update.com |date=26 July 2006 |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref> The [[Warrior Infantry Fighting Vehicle]] is the primary [[armoured personnel carrier]], although many variants of the [[Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (tracked)]] are used too, as well as the [[Saxon APC]] and the [[FV430 series]], which is now having its engines and armour replaced and returned to front-line service as the [[Bulldog APC|Bulldog]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sloppyjalopy.com/fv432.htm |title=FV 432 |publisher=Sloppyjalopy.com |date= |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref> The British Army commonly uses the [[Land Rover Wolf]] and [[Land Rover Defender]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.landrover.com/gb/en/lr/defender/ |title=Land Rover Defender |publisher=Landrover.com |date= |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref>

'''Artillery'''
The Army uses three main artillery systems: the [[MLRS|Multi Launch Rocket System]] (MLRS), [[AS-90]] and [[L118]]. The MLRS was first used operationally in [[Operation Granby]] and has a range of {{convert|70|km|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/artillery-air-defence/1512.aspx GMLRS] British Army</ref> The AS-90 is a 155&nbsp;mm self-propelled gun.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armedforces.co.uk/army/listings/l0046.html |title=AS-90 |publisher=Armedforces.co.uk |date= |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref> The L118 Light Gun is a 105&nbsp;mm towed gun used primarily in support of 16 Air Assault Brigade, 19 Light Brigade and 3 Commando Brigade ([[Royal Marines]]).<ref>[http://www.baesystems.com/ProductsServices/l_and_a_ls_105mm_light_gun.html 105 mm Light Gun] BAe Systems</ref> The [[Rapier (missile)|Rapier FSC Missile System]] is the Army's primary battlefield air defence system, widely deployed since the [[Falklands War]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armedforces-int.com/projects/rapier_missile.html |title=Rapier missile |publisher=Armedforces-int.com |date= |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref> and the [[Starstreak (missile)|Starstreak HVM]] (High Velocity Missile) is a surface-to-air weapon, launched either by a single soldier or from a vehicle-mounted launcher.<ref>[http://www.janes.com/events/exhibitions/dsei2007/sections/daily/day1/starstreak-ii-sighted.shtml Starstreak II sighted] Janes</ref>

'''Army Aviation'''
The [[British Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] (AAC) provides direct aviation support for the Army, although the RAF also contributes by providing support helicopters. The primary attack helicopter is the [[Westland WAH-64 Apache]], a licence-built, modified version of the US [[AH-64 Apache]], which replaced the Westland Lynx AH7 in the anti-tank role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/aircraft/1531.aspx |title=Apache |publisher=Army.mod.uk |date= |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref> The [[Westland Lynx|Lynx]] remains in service as an armed escort, surveillance and light utility helicopter. Other types are used in specialised roles e.g. the [[Westland Gazelle]] as a light surveillance aircraft<ref>[http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/aircraft/1533.aspx Gazelle] British Army</ref> and the [[Bell 212]] for support in specific Jungle / 'hot and high' environments<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vectorsite.net/avhuey.html |title=Bell Huey |publisher=Vectorsite.net |date= |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref> The [[Eurocopter Dauphin|Eurocopter AS 365N Dauphin]] is used for Special Operations Aviation{{sfn|Ripley|2008|p=10}} and the [[Britten-Norman Islander]] is a light fixed-wing aircraft used for airborne reconnaissance and command and control.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britten-norman.com/products/bn2b/ |title=Islander |publisher=Britten-norman.com |date= |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref>

=== The Troubles ===
{{Main|Operation Banner}}
Although having permanent garrisons there, the British Army was initially deployed in a peacekeeping role – codenamed "Operation Banner" – in [[Northern Ireland]] in the wake of Unionist attacks on Nationalist communities in [[Derry]]<ref>[[Kenneth Bloomfield|Bloomfield, K]] Stormont in Crisis (Belfast 1994) p 114</ref> and [[Belfast]]<ref>[[Public Record Office of Northern Ireland|PRONI]]: Cabinet conclusions file CAB/4/1460</ref> and to prevent further Loyalist attacks on Catholic communities, under [[Operation Banner]] between 1969 and 2007 in support of the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) and its successor, the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI).{{sfn|McKernan|2005|p=17}} There has been a steady reduction in the number of troops deployed in Northern Ireland since the [[Good Friday Agreement]] was signed in 1998.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/859388.stm Army dismantles NI post] BBC News, 31 July 2000</ref> In 2005, after the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] announced an end to its armed conflict in Northern Ireland, the British Army dismantled posts and withdrew many troops, and restored troop levels to that of a peace-time garrison.<ref>[http://www.skyscrapernews.com/news.php?ref=391 Army To Dismantle Tower Block Post] Skyscrapernews, 2 August 2005</ref>

== Formation and structure ==
{{British Army Arms}}
{{Main|Structure of the British Army}}

The structure of the British Army is complex, due to the different origins of its various constituent parts. It is broadly split into the Regular Army (full-time Officers/soldiers and units) and the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Army Reserve]] (Spare-time Officers/soldiers and units).

In terms of its military structure, it has two parallel organisations, one administrative and one operational.

'''Administrative'''
* Regiments and Corps. These are listed below (in the template to the right), ranging from the [[Household Cavalry]] to the [[Army Physical Training Corps]] and the [[Royal Logistic Corps]]. Uniquely and somewhat confusingly, the Infantry, which is not a corps but a collection of separate regiments, is administered by 'Divisions' of infantry – [[Guards Division]], [[Queen's Division]], [[Scottish Division]] and so on.<ref>{{harvnb|Heyman|2009|p=105}}.</ref>

'''Operational'''
* The major operational command is based at [[Andover, Hampshire|Andover]] and is known as "[[Army Headquarters (United Kingdom)|Army Headquarters]]".<ref name=intel>[http://www.dmilt.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2506:uk-army-command-reorganization&catid=1:europe&Itemid=57 Army Command reorganization] Defence Marketing Intelligence, 10 November 2011</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/structure/142.aspx |title=Higher Command |publisher=Army.mod.uk |date=1 November 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref> It is split into divisions and subordinate units ranging from regiments to squadrons.
* [[Division (military)|Divisions]] (1 Div. based in [[Herford]] in Germany and 3 Div. based in [[Bulford]])<ref>{{harvnb|Heyman|2009|p=92}}.</ref>
** [[Brigade]]s, both fighting and in a non-fighting regional capacity within HQ LF (for example, 43 (Wessex) [[Brigade]] based in [[Bulford]]).

=== Structure of units ===

The standard operational units are structured as follows, although various units have their own structure, conventions, names and sizes:<ref name="SAS">{{cite web | title = British Army Formation & Structure | publisher = WhoDaresWins.com | year = 2011 | url = http://www.whodareswins.com/british-army-formation-structure-setup.html | accessdate = 15 April 2011}}

|[[Corporal#United Kingdom|Cpl]]
|[[Chosen man|LCpl]]
|}

[[Corps]] are made up of two or more divisions, but now are rarely deployed as a purely national formation due to the size of the British Army.<ref name="SAS"/>

In place of a Battalion, a task-specific [[Battlegroup (army)|Battlegroup]] may be formed. A battlegroup is grown around the core of either an armoured regiment or infantry battalion, and has other units added or removed from it as necessary for its purpose. It results in a mixed formation of armour, infantry, artillery, engineers and support units, typically consisting of between 600 and 700 soldiers under the command of a Lieutenant Colonel.<ref name="SAS"/>

A number of elements of the British Army use alternative terms for battalion, company and platoon. These include the [[Royal Armoured Corps]], [[Corps of Royal Engineers]], [[Royal Logistic Corps]], and the [[Royal Corps of Signals]] who use regiment (battalion), [[Squadron (cavalry)|squadron]] (company) and [[troop]] (platoon). The [[Royal Artillery]] are unique in using the term regiment in place of both [[corps]] and [[battalion]], they also replace company with [[artillery battery|battery]] and platoon with troop.<ref name="SAS"/>

=== Divisions ===

The British Army currently has two operational divisions.<ref>{{harvnb|Heyman|2009|pp=92–93}}</ref>

{| class="wikitable"

Brigades which are not under 1st (UK) Division at any one time report directly into [[Support Command (United Kingdom)|Support Command]].<ref>[http://www.army.mod.uk/structure/2082.aspx Support Command] Ministry of Defence</ref>

=== Rapid Reaction Force ===
[[16 Air Assault Brigade]] forms the bulk of the Army's rapid reaction force.

=== Combat support ===
[[Force Troops Command]], or FTC, forms the basis of the Army's Combat support, containing units ranging from artillery to military police.<ref>[http://www.army.mod.uk/structure/25417.aspx Ministry of Defence: Structure]</ref>

=== Aviation components ===

The British Army operates alongside the [[Royal Air Force]] and the [[Fleet Air Arm]] as part of [[Joint Helicopter Command]], but the army also has its own [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]].  Military helicopters of all three services are commanded by Joint Helicopter Command, a joint 2 star headquarters operating under HQ Land Forces.<ref>[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.mod.uk/issues/sdr/jhc.htm Joint Helicopter Command] Strategic Defence Review</ref>

=== Special forces ===

The [[Special Air Service]] overall comprises one regular regiment and two [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Army Reserve]] regiments.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=26 March 2010 |publisher=[[Defence Analytical Services Agency]] |title=UK Defence Statistics 2009 |url=http://www.dasa.mod.uk/publications/UK-defence-statistics-compendium/2009/2009.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20140201230645/http://www.dasa.mod.uk/publications/UK-defence-statistics-compendium/2009/2009.pdf |archivedate=1 February 2014 }}</ref> The regular regiment, 22 SAS, has its headquarters and depot located in [[Hereford]] and consists of five squadrons: A, B, D, G and Reserve with a training wing.<ref>{{harvnb|Fremont-Barnes|2009|p=62}}</ref> The two reserve regiments, [[Artists Rifles|21 SAS]] and 23 SAS (collectively, the Special Air Service (Reserve) (SAS(R))) are no longer part of the UK's special forces and now form part of [[1st Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Brigade]].<ref>Army Briefing Note 120/14, Newly formed Force Troops Command Specialist Brigades: "It commands all of the Army’s Intelligence, Surveillance and Electronic Warfare assets, and is made up of units specifically from the former 1 Military Intelligence Brigade and 1 Artillery Brigade, as well as 14 Signal Regiment, 21 and 23 SAS®."</ref>

The [[Special Reconnaissance Regiment]] (SRR), formed in 2005 from existing assets, undertakes close reconnaissance and special surveillance tasks.<ref name="PPUK"/> The [[Special Forces Support Group]] was formed around 1st Battalion the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]], with attached [[Royal Marines]] and [[RAF Regiment]] assets, the unit is also open to any member of the HM Armed Forces.

=== British Overseas Territories military units ===
Numerous military units were raised historically in British territories, including self-governing and Crown colonies, and protectorates. Whereas the old [[Dominion|Commonwealth Dominions]], such as [[Canada]] and [[Australia]], had their own armies before achieving complete independence, units raised in those territories which remained part of the realm of the UK were, and are, ultimately under the control of the UK government, and do not constitute separate armies. The UK retains responsibility for the defence of all of the fourteen remaining [[British Overseas Territories]]. Although the [[Cayman Islands]] premier has stated the desire to raise a Cayman Islands Defence Force<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caymannewsservice.com/crime/2012/03/09/bush-wants-ci-defence-force |title=''Bush wants CI defence force'' |publisher=Cayman News Service |date=13 March 2012 |accessdate=13 September 2013}}</ref> when it can be afforded (it currently has only the [[Cayman Islands Cadet Corps]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cicadetcorps.ky/ |title=Cayman Islands Cadet Force |publisher=Cicadetcorps.ky |date=8 June 2013 |accessdate=13 September 2013}}</ref> becoming the fifth, only four of the remaining British Overseas Territories retain locally raised regiments:

=== Royal Navy and RAF ground units ===
The other armed services have their own infantry units which are not part of the British Army. The [[Royal Marines]] are amphibious [[light infantry]] forming part of the [[Naval Service (United Kingdom)|Naval Service]], and the [[Royal Air Force]] has the [[RAF Regiment]] used for airfield defence, force protection duties and Forward Air Control.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafregiment/ |title=RAF Regiment |publisher=Raf.mod.uk |date=23 September 2011 |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref>

== Recruitment ==
{{Main|Recruitment in the British Army}}
The Army mainly recruits within the United Kingdom; it normally has a recruitment target of around 12,000 soldiers per year.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5261834.stm Army recruitment increases by 9%] BBC News, 18 August 2006</ref> Low unemployment in Britain has resulted in the Army having difficulty in meeting its target. In the early years of the 21st century there has been a marked increase in the number of recruits from other (mostly [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]) countries. In 2006 overseas recruitment, mostly in Commonwealth countries, generated more than 6,000 soldiers from 54 nations; together with the 3,000 Gurkhas, 10% of the British Army are foreign nationals.<ref>[http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2007/02/british-army-recruitment-iraq Britain's child army] ''New Statesman'', 5 February 2007</ref>

The [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] now caps the number of recruits from Commonwealth countries, although this will not affect the Gurkhas. If the trend continues 10% of the army will be from Commonwealth countries before 2012. The cap is in place as some fear the army's [[Britishness|British character]] is being diluted, and employing too many could make the army seen as employing [[mercenaries]].{{sfn|Norton-Taylor|2008}} The minimum recruitment age is 16&nbsp;years (after the end of [[GCSE]]s), although soldiers may not serve on operations below 18&nbsp;years; the maximum recruitment age was raised in January 2007 from 26 to 33&nbsp;years. The normal term of engagement is 22&nbsp;years, and, once enlisted, soldiers are not normally permitted to leave until they have served at least 4&nbsp;years.{{sfn|BBC staff|2007}}

There has been a strong and continuing tradition of recruiting from Ireland including what is now the [[Republic of Ireland]].{{efn|"Army recruitment in Northern Ireland has just revealed that 16 per cent of all those enlisting since April were from south of the border. That figure is up from 10.5 per cent last year – which was in itself more than double for 2006" {{harv|Sharrock|2008}}. }}{{efn|"Between 2005 and 2006, just 3% of recruits entering the military through its recruitment centres in Northern Ireland came from the Republic.  The figure so far this year is 14%, and officers believe it will rise further" {{harv|Buchanan|2008}}.}}{{efn|"There has been a seven-fold increase in Irish recruits to the British armed forces since the recession began. Figures obtained by Fine Gael TD Brian Hayes revealed 10 people with addresses in the Republic of Ireland joined the British military between 2007 and 2008. From 2009 to 2010 this number rose to 85" {{harv|McGarrigle|2010}}. }}{{sfn|Holmes2002|pp=48,55–57,59–65,177–8}} Over 200,000 Irish soldiers fought in the First World War.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qub.ac.uk/sites/irishhistorylive/IrishHistoryResources/ArticlesandLectures/IrelandandtheFirstWorldWar/|title=Ireland and the First World War: the Historical Context.|publisher=School of History and Anthropology}}</ref>{{efn|"Eager to place themselves in the best possible light after the war was over – six months at the most was a common reckoning – Irish Unionist and Nationalist politicians called on their followers to do their duty for their respective causes and enlist.

Perhaps as many as 49,000 died" ({{cite web|url=http://www.historytimes.com/fresh-perspectives-in-history/british-and-irish-history/486-remembering-irish-soldiers-in-world-war-i|title=Remembering Irish soldiers in World War I|publisher=History Times}} {{dead link|date=September 2014}})}} More than 60,000 Irishmen from what was then the [[Irish Free State]]{{efn|"Ian Malone's decision also had a long historical precedent.

As one of 400 or more men from the republic then serving in the British Army, some of them stationed in Northern Ireland, Ian Malone was part of a familiar Irish story of economic emigration – he was seeking work abroad when there was little at home. And never having left the country, he was no doubt seeking travel and adventure, too" {{harv|Watson|2004}}.}} (now the Republic of Ireland) and 38,000 from [[Northern Ireland]] served in the Second World War,{{sfn|Connolly|p=505}} all volunteered.

=== Oath of allegiance ===
[[File:Queens.guard.buck.palace.arp.jpg|thumb|right|Troops of the [[Grenadier Guards]] on guard at [[Buckingham Palace]]. Various army regiments supply troops to guard the Royal residences.]]

All soldiers must take an oath of allegiance upon joining the Army, a process known as ''attestation''. Those who wish to swear by [[God in Abrahamic religions|God]] use the following words:

{{quote|I, [soldier's name], swear by Almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to [[Elizabeth II|Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II]], her heirs and successors and that I will as in duty bound honestly and faithfully defend Her Majesty, her heirs and successors in person, [[British Crown|crown]] and dignity against all enemies and will observe and obey all orders of Her Majesty, her heirs and successors and of the generals and officers set over me.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whodareswins.com/british-army-oath-of-allegiance.html#selfless |title=British Army Oath of Allegiance |publisher= |date= |accessdate=29 November 2010}}</ref>}}

Others replace the words "swear by Almighty God" with "solemnly, sincerely and truly declare and affirm".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/v_s_of_the_british_army.pdf |title=Values and Standards of the British Army |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref> Under the reign of another monarch, the name of the monarch and all pronouns with gender are replaced appropriately.

== Flags and ensigns ==
[[File:Royal Corps Transport Vessel, Arezzo.jpg|thumb|An Army landing craft of the [[Royal Logistic Corps]]]]
The British Army does not have its own specific ensign for the whole Army, unlike the Royal Navy, which uses the [[White Ensign]], and the RAF, which uses the [[Royal Air Force Ensign]]. Instead, the Army has different flags and ensigns, some for the entire army and many for the different regiments and corps. The official flag of the Army as a whole is the [[Union Flag]], flown in a ratio of 3:5. A non-ceremonial flag also exists, which is used at recruiting events, military events and exhibitions. It also flies from the Ministry of Defence building in Whitehall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishflags.net/British%20Army.html |title=British Army (non-ceremonial) |publisher=britishflags.net |date= |accessdate=22 October 2010|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKh1taVz |archivedate = 18 November 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref>

Whilst at war, the Union Flag is always used, and this flag represents the Army on [[The Cenotaph, Whitehall|The Cenotaph]] at [[Whitehall]] in London (the UK's memorial to its war dead).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwQhSm7w |title=Whitehall Cenotaph |publisher=Webcitation.org |date= |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref>

The British Army has throughout its history operated ships, ports and myriad boats. [[Rigid Raider|boats]], [[landing craft]] and [[Marchwood Military Port|ports]] are still operated by the Army and ensigns exists for vessels commanded by the Army. The [[Royal Logistic Corps]] operates a large fleet of vessels from its base at Marchwood near [[Southampton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/rlc/regiments/17957.aspx |title=17 Port & Maritime Regiment RLC |publisher=Army.mod.uk |date= |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref> The [[Royal Engineers]] has had fleets since the introduction of diving in 1838 and was granted an ensign following the foundation of the [[Royal Engineers]] Submarine Mining Service in 1871, where it operated [[sea mine]] laying ships, before transfer of the trade to the [[Royal Navy]]. The Corps maintains a [[Blue Ensign]] defaced by the crest of the [[Board of Ordnance]] from where the Corps developed, which it flies from its fleet and shore establishments that routinely operate boats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/gb%5Erets.html |title=Royal Engineers Ensign |publisher=Fotw.net |date= |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref>

Each [[Foot Guards]] and line regiment (excluding [[The Rifles]] and [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]] (RGR)) also has its own flags, known as [[Colours, standards and guidons|Colours]]—normally a Regimental Colour and a Queen's Colour. The design of different Regimental Colours vary but typically the colour has the Regiment's badge in the centre. The RGR carry the [[Queen's Truncheon]] in place of Colours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegurkhamuseum.co.uk/Research/History_And_Facts/The_Queens_Truncheon/27 |title=The Queen's Truncheon |publisher=Thegurkhamuseum.co.uk |date= |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref>

Every regiment and corps has its own distinctive insignia, such as [[cap badge]], [[beret]], [[tactical recognition flash]] and [[stable belt]].

Throughout the army there are many official specialisms. They do not affect rank, but they do affect pay bands:

== Tommy Atkins and other nicknames ==
{{further2|[[List of nicknames of British Army regiments]]}}
A long established nickname for a British soldier has been ''[[Tommy Atkins]]'' or ''Tommy'' for short. The origins are obscure but most probably derive from a specimen army form circulated by the Adjutant-General Sir Harry Calvert to all units in 1815 where the blanks had been filled in with the particulars of a Private Thomas Atkins, No 6 Company, 23rd Regiment of Foot. German soldiers in both [[world war]]s would usually refer to their British opponents as ''Tommys''. Present-day British soldiers are often referred to as ''Toms'' or just ''Tom''. The British Army magazine ''Soldier'' has a regular cartoon strip, ''Tom'', featuring the everyday life of a British soldier. Outside the services, soldiers are generally known as ''squaddies'' by the [[Red tops|British popular press]], and the general public.{{sfn|Burnside|2010}}

Another nickname which applies only to soldiers in Scottish regiments is ''Jock'', derived from the fact that in Scotland the common Christian name John is often changed to Jock in the vernacular.
Welsh soldiers are occasionally referred to as ''Taffy'' or just ''Taff''. This may only apply to those from the Taff-Ely Valley in [[South Wales]], where a large portion of men, left unemployed from the decline of the coal industry in the area, enlisted during the First and Second World Wars. Alternatively, it is derived from the supposed Welsh pronunciation of ''Dafydd''<ref>The Concise Oxford Dictionary ISBN 978-0-19-861131-8</ref>—the vernacular form of Dave or Davey, the patron Saint of Wales being Saint David.<ref>''Collins English Dictionary'' ISBN 0-00-716334-7</ref> As a nickname for the Welsh it has existed since 1699.{{sfn|OED Taffy|2013}}


Junior officers in the army, especially those from a privileged background, are sometimes known as ''Ruperts'' by the [[Other ranks (UK)|Other ranks]].{{sfn|OED Rupert|2013}} This nickname is believed to have been derived from the children's comic book character [[Rupert Bear]] who epitomises traditional public school values and from the purported preponderance of that particular forename amongst young men from a public school background.{{sfn|Beevor|1990|p={{page needed|date=September 2014}} }}
