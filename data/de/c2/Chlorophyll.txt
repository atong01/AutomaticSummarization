[[File:MY1DMM CHLORA.ogv|thumb|These chlorophyll maps show milligrams of chlorophyll per cubic meter of seawater each month. Places where chlorophyll amounts were very low, indicating very low numbers of phytoplankton, are blue. Places where chlorophyll concentrations were high, meaning many phytoplankton were growing, are yellow. The observations come from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Aqua satellite. Land is dark gray, and places where MODIS could not collect data because of sea ice, polar darkness, or clouds are light gray.The highest chlorophyll concentrations, where tiny surface-dwelling ocean plants are [[thriving]], are in cold polar waters or in places where ocean currents bring cold water to the surface, such as around the equator and along the shores of continents. It is not the cold water itself that stimulates the phytoplankton. Instead, the cool temperatures are often a sign that the water has welled up to the surface from deeper in the ocean, carrying nutrients that have built up over time. In polar waters, nutrients accumulate in surface waters during the dark winter months when plants can’t grow. When sunlight returns in the spring and summer, the plants flourish in high concentrations.<ref>[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/GlobalMaps/view.php?d1=MY1DMM_CHLORA Chlorophyll : Global Maps].

Chlorophyll absorbs light most strongly in the [[Diffuse sky radiation|blue portion]] of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], followed by the red portion. Conversely, it is a poor absorber of green and near-green portions of the spectrum, hence the green color of chlorophyll-containing tissues.<ref>Chlorophyll molecules are specifically arranged in and around photosystems that are embedded in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. Two types of chlorophyll exist in the photosystems: chlorophyll a  and b.

The function of the vast majority of chlorophyll (up to several hundred molecules per photosystem) is to absorb light and transfer that light energy by [[resonance energy transfer]] to a specific chlorophyll pair in the [[reaction center]] of the photosystems.

The two currently accepted photosystem units are [[Photosystem II]] and [[Photosystem I]], which have their own distinct reaction centres, named P680 and P700, respectively. These centres are named after the wavelength (in [[nanometer]]s) of their red-peak absorption maximum. The identity, function and spectral properties of the types of chlorophyll in each photosystem are distinct and determined by each other and the protein structure surrounding them.

The function of the reaction center chlorophyll is to use the energy absorbed by and transferred to it from the other chlorophyll pigments in the photosystems to undergo a charge separation, a specific [[redox]] reaction in which the chlorophyll donates an [[electron]] into a series of molecular intermediates called an [[electron transport chain]]. The charged reaction center chlorophyll (P680<sup>+</sup>) is then reduced back to its ground state by accepting an electron. In Photosystem II, the electron that reduces P680<sup>+</sup> ultimately comes from the oxidation of water into O<sub>2</sub> and H<sup>+</sup> through several intermediates. This reaction is how photosynthetic organisms such as plants produce O<sub>2</sub> gas, and is the source for practically all the O<sub>2</sub> in Earth's atmosphere. Photosystem I typically works in series with Photosystem II; thus the P700<sup>+</sup> of Photosystem I is usually reduced, via many intermediates in the thylakoid membrane, by electrons ultimately from Photosystem II. Electron transfer reactions in the thylakoid membranes are complex, however, and the source of electrons used to reduce P700<sup>+</sup> can vary.

The electron flow produced by the reaction center chlorophyll pigments is used to shuttle H<sup>+</sup> ions across the thylakoid membrane, setting up a [[chemiosmosis|chemiosmotic]] potential used mainly to produce [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] chemical energy; and those electrons ultimately reduce NADP<sup>+</sup> to [[NADPH]], a universal [[redox|reductant]] used to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> into sugars as well as for other biosynthetic reductions.

Reaction center chlorophyll–protein complexes are capable of directly absorbing light and performing charge separation events without other chlorophyll pigments, but the absorption cross section (the likelihood of absorbing a photon under a given light intensity) is small. Thus, the remaining chlorophylls in the photosystem and antenna pigment protein complexes associated with the photosystems all cooperatively absorb and funnel light energy to the reaction center. Besides chlorophyll ''a'', there are other pigments, called [[accessory pigment]]s, which occur in these pigment–protein antenna complexes.

==Chemical structure==
[[Image:Chlorophyll-a-3D-vdW.png|thumb|Space-filling model of the chlorophyll a molecule]]
Chlorophyll is a [[chlorin]] pigment, which is structurally similar to and produced through the same metabolic pathway as other [[porphyrin]] pigments such as [[heme]]. At the center of the chlorin ring is a [[magnesium]] [[ion]]. This was discovered in 1906,<ref>Willstätter, Richard (1906) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002455980;view=1up;seq=436 "Zur Kenntniss der Zusammensetzung des Chlorophylls"] ([Contribution] to the knowledge of the composition of chlorophyll), ''Annalen der Chemie'', '''350''' :  48-82.  From p. 49:  ''"Das Hauptproduct der alkalischen Hydrolyse bilden tiefgrüne Alkalisalze.  In ihnen liegen complexe Magnesiumverbindungen vor, die das Metall in einer gegen Alkali auch bei hoher Temperatur merkwürdig widerstandsfähigen Bindung enthalten."''  (Deep green alkali salts form the main product of alkali hydrolysis.  In them, complex magnesium compounds are present, which contain the metal in a bond that's extraordinarily resistant to alkali even at high temperature.) </ref> and was the first time that magnesium had been detected in living tissue.<ref name="motilva">{{Cite book

The chlorin ring can have several different side chains, usually including a long [[phytol]] chain. There are a few different forms that occur naturally, but the most widely distributed form in terrestrial plants is chlorophyll ''a''. After initial work done by German chemist [[Richard Willstätter]] spanning from 1905 to 1915, the general structure of chlorophyll ''a'' was elucidated by [[Hans Fischer]] in 1940. By 1960, when most of the stereochemistry of chlorophyll ''a'' was known, [[Robert Burns Woodward]] published a total synthesis of the molecule.<ref name="motilva"/><ref>

When leaves degreen in the process of [[plant senescence]], chlorophyll is converted to a group of colourless [[tetrapyrrole]]s known as '''nonfluorescent chlorophyll catabolites''' (NCC's) with the general structure:

==Biosynthesis==
{{Further|Protochlorophyllide}}
In plants, chlorophyll may be synthesized from [[succinyl-CoA]] and [[glycine]], although the immediate precursor to chlorophyll ''a'' and ''b'' is [[protochlorophyllide]]. In [[Angiosperm]] plants, the last step, conversion of protochlorophyllide to chlorophyll, is light-dependent and such plants are pale ([[etiolation|etiolated]]) if grown in the darkness. [[Non-vascular plant]]s and green algae have an additional light-independent enzyme and grow green in the darkness instead.

Chlorophyll itself is bound to proteins and can transfer the absorbed energy in the required direction. Protochlorophyllide occurs mostly in the free form and, under light conditions, acts as a [[photosensitizer]], forming highly toxic [[free radicals]]. Hence, plants need an efficient mechanism of regulating the amount of chlorophyll precursor. In angiosperms, this is done at the step of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), one of the intermediate compounds in the biosynthesis pathway. Plants that are fed by ALA accumulate high and toxic levels of protochlorophyllide; so do the mutants with the damaged regulatory system.<ref>

{{Further|Chlorosis}}
Chlorosis is a condition in which [[leaf|leaves]] produce insufficient chlorophyll, turning them yellow. Chlorosis can be caused by a nutrient deficiency of [[Iron deficiency (plant disorder)|iron]]—called iron chlorosis—or by a shortage of [[magnesium deficiency (plants)|magnesium]] or [[Nitrogen deficiency|nitrogen]].  Soil pH sometimes plays a role in nutrient-caused chlorosis; many plants are adapted to grow in soils with specific pH levels and their ability to absorb nutrients from the soil can be dependent on this.<ref>

In 1952 the Toledo Blade published a story titled <ref>[http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/DSH/chlorophyll.html Amazing Claims for Chlorophyll], [[Quackwatch]]</ref> "Chlorophyll Held Useless As Body Deodorant",<ref>Ubell, Earl (December 10, 1952) [http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19521210&id=5vVOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZwAEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1878,4801922 "Chlorophyll Held Useless As Body Deodorant"], Toledo Blade</ref> arguing that the wide use of chlorophyll was ineffective in its purported purpose. Quackwatch, a website dedicated to debunking false medical claims, notes that "no deodorant effect can possibly occur from the quantities of chlorophyll put in products such as gum, foot powder, cough drops, etc."<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Ecological Botany|volume= 9|page=3|year= 1955|doi=10.1007/BF02984956|title=Chlorophyll derivatives—Their chemistry?
