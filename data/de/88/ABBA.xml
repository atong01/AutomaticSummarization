Ulvaeus started writing English-language songs for his group, and even had a brief solo career alongside. The Hootenanny Singers and The Hep Stars sometimes crossed paths while touring. In June 1966, Ulvaeus and Andersson decided to write a song together. Their first attempt was &quot;Isn't It Easy to Say&quot;, a song later recorded by The Hep Stars.<space/><link><target>Stig Anderson</target></link><space/>was the manager of The Hootenanny Singers and founder of the<space/><link><target>Polar Music</target></link><space/>label. He saw potential in the collaboration, and encouraged them to write more. The two also began playing occasionally with the other's bands on stage and on record, although it was not until 1969 that the pair wrote and produced some of their first real hits together: &quot;<link><target>Ljuva sextital</target></link>&quot; (&quot;Sweet Sixties&quot;), recorded by Brita Borg, and The Hep Stars' 1969 hit &quot;Speleman&quot; (&quot;Fiddler&quot;).</paragraph><paragraph>Andersson wrote and submitted the song &quot;Hej, Clown&quot; for the 1969<space/><link><target>Melodifestival</target></link>, the national festival to select the<space/><link><target>Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest</target><part>Swedish entry</part></link><space/>to the<space/><link><target>Eurovision Song Contest</target></link>.

A month later, the two had become a couple. As their respective bands began to break up during 1969, Andersson and Ulvaeus teamed up and recorded their first album together in 1970, called<space/><italics><link><target>Lycka</target></link></italics><space/>(&quot;Happiness&quot;), which included original songs sung by both men. Their spouses were often present in the recording studio, and sometimes added backing vocals; Fltskog even co-wrote a song with the two. Ulvaeus still occasionally recorded and performed with The Hootenanny Singers until the summer of 1974, and Andersson took part in producing their records.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Agnetha Fltskog</target></link><space/>(born 5 April 1950 in<space/><link><target>Jnkping</target></link>, Sweden) sang with a local dance band headed by Bernt Enghardt who sent a demo recording of the band to Karl Gerhard Lundkvist. The demo tape featured a song written and sung by Agnetha: &quot;Jag var s kr&quot;. Lundkvist was so impressed with her voice that he was convinced she would be a star. After going through considerable effort to locate the singer, he arranged for Agnetha to come to Stockholm and to record two of her own songs. This led to Agnetha at the age of 18 having a number-one record in Sweden with a self-composed song, which later went on to sell over 80,000 copies. She was soon noticed by the critics and songwriters as a talented singer/songwriter of<space/><link><target>schlager music</target><part>schlager</part></link><space/>style songs. Fltskog's main inspiration in her early years were singers such as<space/><link><target>Connie Francis</target></link>. Along with her own compositions, she recorded<space/><link><target>Cover version</target><part>covers</part></link><space/>of foreign hits and performed them on tours in Swedish<space/><link><target>folkpark</target><trail>s</trail></link>. Most of her biggest hits were self-composed, which was quite unusual for a female singer in the 1960s. Agnetha released four solo LPs between 1968 and 1971. She had many successful singles in the Swedish charts.</paragraph><paragraph>During filming of a Swedish TV special in May 1969, Fltskog met Ulvaeus, and they married on 6 July 1971.

She also formed her own band, the Anni-Frid Four. In the summer of 1967, she won a national talent competition with &quot;En ledig dag&quot; (&quot;A Day Off&quot;) a Swedish version of the bossa nova song &quot;A Day in Portofino&quot;, which is included in the EMI compilation<space/><italics><link><target>Frida 19671972</target></link></italics>. The first prize was a recording contract with<space/><link><target>EMI</target></link><space/>Sweden and to perform live on the most popular TV shows in the country. This TV performance, amongst many others, is included in the 3-hour documentary<space/><italics><link><target>Frida The DVD</target></link></italics>. Lyngstad released several<space/><link><target>schlager</target></link><space/>style singles on EMI without much success. When Benny Andersson started to produce her recordings in 1971, she had her first number-one single, &quot;Min egen stad&quot; (&quot;My Own Town&quot;), written by Benny and featuring all the future ABBA members on backing vocals. Lyngstad toured and performed regularly in the folkpark circuit and made appearances on radio and TV. She met Ulvaeus briefly in 1963 during a talent contest, and Fltskog during a TV show in early 1968.</paragraph><paragraph>Lyngstad finally linked up with her future bandmates in 1969. On 1 March 1969, she participated in the Melodifestival, where she met Andersson for the first time. A few weeks later they met again during a concert tour in southern Sweden and they soon became a couple. Andersson produced her single &quot;Peter Pan&quot; in September 1969&amp;mdash;her first collaboration with Benny &amp; Bjrn, as they had written the song. Andersson would then produce Lyngstad's debut studio album,<space/><italics><link><target>Frida (album)</target><part>Frida</part></link></italics>, which was released in March 1971. Lyngstad also played in several revues and cabaret shows in Stockholm between 1969 and 1973. After ABBA formed, she recorded another successful album in 1975,<space/><italics><link><target>Frida ensam</target></link></italics>, which included a Swedish rendition of &quot;<link><target>Fernando (song)</target><part>Fernando</part></link>&quot;, a hit on the Swedish radio charts before the English version was released.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>harvnb</target><arg>Palm</arg><arg>2001</arg><arg name="pp">41–58</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='4'>First live performance and the start of &quot;Festfolket&quot;</heading><paragraph>An attempt at combining their talents occurred in April 1970 when the two couples went on holiday together to the island of<space/><link><target>Cyprus</target></link>. What started as singing for fun on the beach ended up as an improvised live performance in front of the United Nations soldiers stationed on the island. Andersson and Ulvaeus were at this time recording their first album together,<space/><italics>Lycka</italics>, which was to be released in September 1970. Fltskog and Lyngstad added backing vocals on several tracks during June, and the idea of their working together saw them launch a stage act, &quot;Festfolket&quot; (which translates from Swedish to mean both &quot;Party People&quot; and &quot;Engaged Couples&quot;), on 1 November 1970 in<space/><link><target>Gothenburg</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>The cabaret show attracted generally negative reviews, except for the performance of the Andersson and Ulvaeus hit &quot;Hej, gamle man&quot; (&quot;Hello, Old Man&quot;)&amp;mdash;the first Bjrn and Benny recording to feature all four.

However, since the fish-canners were unknown outside Sweden, Anderson came to believe the name would work in international markets.

The group played eleven concerts to full houses, including six shows at Tokyo's<space/><link><target>Nippon Budokan</target><part>Budokan</part></link>. This tour was the last &quot;on the road&quot; adventure of their career.In the summer of 1980, the group released the single &quot;<link><target>The Winner Takes It All</target></link>&quot; the group's eighth UK chart topper (and their first since 1978). The song is widely misunderstood as being written about Ulvaeus and Fltskog's marital tribulations; Ulvaeus wrote the lyrics, but has stated they were not about his own divorce; Fltskog has repeatedly stated she was not the loser in their divorce. In the United States, the single peaked at number-eight on the<space/><italics>Billboard</italics><space/>Hot 100 chart and became ABBA's second<space/><italics>Billboard</italics><space/>Adult Contemporary number-one. It was also re-recorded by Andersson and Ulvaeus with a slightly different backing track, by French chanteuse<space/><link><target>Mireille Mathieu</target></link><space/>at the end of 1980&amp;nbsp; as &quot;Bravo Tu As Gagn&quot;, with French lyrics by Alain Boublil. November the same year saw the release of ABBA's seventh album<space/><italics><link><target>Super Trouper (album)</target><part>Super Trouper</part></link></italics>, which reflected a certain change in ABBA's style with more prominent use of synthesizers and increasingly personal lyrics. It set a record for the most pre-orders ever received for a UK album after one million copies were ordered before release. The second single from the album, &quot;<link><target>Super Trouper (song)</target><part>Super Trouper</part></link>&quot;, also hit number-one in the UK, becoming the group's ninth and final UK chart-topper.

For this occasion, ABBA recorded the track &quot;Hovas Vittne&quot; (a pun on the Swedish name for<space/><link><target>Jehovah's Witness</target></link><space/>and Anderson's birthplace,<space/><link><target>Hova, Sweden</target><part>Hova</part></link>) as a tribute to him, and released it only on 200 red vinyl copies, to be distributed to the guests attending the party. This single has become a sought-after collectible. In mid-February 1981, Andersson and Lyngstad announced they were filing for divorce. Information surfaced that their marriage had been an uphill struggle for years, and Benny had already met another woman, Mona Nrklit, whom he married in November 1981.</paragraph><paragraph>Andersson and Ulvaeus had songwriting sessions during the spring of 1981, and recording sessions began in mid-March.

Although not revealed at the time of its release, the album's title track, according to Ulvaeus, refers to the secret meetings held against the approval of totalitarian governments in Soviet-dominated states, while other tracks address topics like failed relationships, the threat of war, ageing, and loss of innocence. The album's only major single release, &quot;<link><target>One of Us (ABBA song)</target><part>One of Us</part></link>&quot;, proved to be the last of ABBA's nine number-one singles in Germany, this being in December 1981; and the swansong of their sixteen Top 5 singles on the South African chart. &quot;One of Us&quot; was also ABBA's final Top 10 hit in the UK.</paragraph><paragraph>Although it topped the album charts across most of Europe, including the UK and Germany,<space/><italics>The Visitors</italics><space/>was not as commercially successful as its predecessors, showing a commercial decline in previously loyal markets such as France, Australia and Japan. A track from the album, &quot;<link><target>When All Is Said and Done (song)</target><part>When All Is Said and Done</part></link>&quot;, was released as a single in North America, Australia and New Zealand, and fittingly became ABBA's final Top 40 hit in the US (debuting on the US charts on 31 December 1981), while also reaching the US Adult Contemporary Top 10, and number-four on the RPM Adult Contemporary chart in Canada. The song's lyrics, as with &quot;<link><target>The Winner Takes It All</target></link>&quot; and &quot;One of Us&quot;, dealt with the painful experience of separating from a long-term partner, though it looked at the trauma more optimistically. With the now publicised story of Andersson and Lyngstad's divorce, speculation increased of tension within the band. Also released in the United States was the title track of<space/><italics>The Visitors</italics>, which hit the Top Ten on the<space/><italics>Billboard</italics><space/>Hot Dance Club Play chart.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Final recording sessions</heading><paragraph>In the spring of 1982, songwriting sessions had started and the group came together for more recordings.

Nu tndas tusen julejus, which was Fltskog's first Swedish language recording for the Polar Music label after having left CBS-Cupol, peaked at No. 6 on the Swedish album chart in January 1982, has been re-released on CD by Polar Music/PolyGram/Universal Music all through the 1990s and 2000s and is one of the best-selling Swedish Christmas albums of all time.

The first single from the album was her self-penned &quot;I Won't Let You Go&quot;.

The album contained songs for children and was sung in Swedish. For the album Agnetha recorded duets with her son and with a choir of children. She also recorded a few solo songs. The production was modern and fresh. The single 'Pa Sondag' was much played at the radio and even made the Swedish top 10, unique for a song made for kids to enjoy.</paragraph><paragraph>Also in November 1987, Fltskog released her third post-ABBA solo album, the<space/><link><target>Peter Cetera</target></link>-produced<space/><italics><link><target>I Stand Alone (Agnetha Fltskog album)</target><part>I Stand Alone</part></link></italics>, which also included the<space/><italics>Billboard</italics><space/>Adult Contemporary duet with Cetera, &quot;<link><target>I Wasn't the One (Who Said Goodbye)</target></link>&quot;, as well as the European charting singles &quot;The Last Time&quot; and &quot;Let It Shine&quot;. The album was extremely successful in Sweden, where it spent eight weeks at number-one and was awarded double-platinum. Shortly after some minor European promotion for the album in early 1988, Fltskog withdrew from public life and halted her music career. In 1996, she released her autobiography,<space/><italics>As I Am</italics>, and a compilation album featuring her solo hits alongside some ABBA classics.</paragraph><paragraph>In 2004, she made a successful comeback, releasing the critically acclaimed album<space/><italics><link><target>My Colouring Book</target></link></italics>, which debuted at number-one in Sweden (achieving triple-platinum status), number-six in Germany, and number 12 in the UK, winning a silver award, and achieving gold status in Finland. The single &quot;<link><target>If I Thought You'd Ever Change Your Mind</target></link>&quot; (a cover of the Cilla Black 1960s song) became Fltskog's biggest solo hit in the United Kingdom, reaching number 11. The single peaked at number-two in Sweden and was a hit throughout Scandinavia and Europe. A further single, &quot;<link><target>When You Walk in the Room</target></link>&quot;, was released but met with less success, only peaking at number 34 in the United Kingdom. In January 2007, she sang a live duet on stage with Swedish singer Tommy Krberg at the after party for the final performance of the musical,<space/><italics>Mamma Mia!</italics>, in Stockholm, at which Benny Andersson and Bjrn Ulvaeus were also present.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1992, Lyngstad had been asked and chosen to be the chairperson for the environmental organisation<space/><italics>&quot;Artister fr miljn&quot;</italics><space/>(Artists for the Environment) in Sweden. She became chairperson for this organisation from 1992 to 1995. To mark her interests for the environment, she recorded the<space/><link><target>Julian Lennon</target></link><space/>song &quot;Saltwater&quot; and performed it live in Stockholm. She arranged and financed summer camps for poor children in Sweden, focusing on environmental and ecological issues. Her environmental work for this organisation led up to the decision to record again. The album<space/><italics><link><target>Djupa andetag</target></link></italics><space/>(<italics>Deep Breaths</italics>) was released towards the end of 1996 and became a success in Sweden, where it reached number-one. The lyrics for the single from this album, &quot;ven en blomma&quot; (&quot;Even a Flower&quot;), deal with environmental issues. In 2004, Lyngstad recorded a song called &quot;The Sun Will Shine Again&quot;, written especially for her and released with former<space/><link><target>Deep Purple</target></link><space/>member<space/><link><target>Jon Lord</target></link>. The couple made several TV performances with this song in Germany. Lyngstad lives a relatively low-profile life but occasionally appears at a party or charity function.

This was also done in an effort to minimize travelling, particularly to countries that would have required extremely long flights. Fltskog and Ulvaeus had two young children and Fltskog, who was also<space/><link><target>Fear of flying</target><part>afraid of flying</part></link>, was very reluctant to leave her children for such a long time. ABBA's manager, Stig Anderson, realized the potential of showing a simple video clip on television to publicize a single or album, thereby allowing easier and quicker exposure than a concert tour. Some of these videos became classics because of the 1970s-era costumes and early video effects, such as the grouping of the band members in different combinations of pairs, overlapping one singer's profile with the other's full face, and the contrasting of one member against another.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1976, ABBA participated in a high-profile advertising campaign by the Matsushita Electric Industrial (today's<space/><link><target>Panasonic</target></link>), which was designed to promote the brand<space/><link><target>National (brand)</target><part>National</part></link>.
