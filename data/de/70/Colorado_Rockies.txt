The '''Colorado Rockies''' are an [[United States|American]] [[professional baseball|professional]] [[baseball]] team based in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]. They are currently members of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB)'s [[National League]] (NL) [[National League West|West division]]. Their home venue is [[Coors Field]]. Their current manager is [[Walt Weiss]]. The Rockies have won one [[List of National League pennant winners|National League championship]] ([[2007 National League Championship Series|2007]]). They mounted a rally in the last month of the 2007 regular season, winning 21 of their final 22 games, and reached the [[2007 World Series]]. However, they were swept by the [[American League]] (AL) champion [[Boston Red Sox]] in four games.

==History==
{{main|History of the Colorado Rockies}}

Denver had long been a hotbed of [[Denver Zephyrs|Denver Bears/Zephyrs]] [[Minor League Baseball|Minor league baseball]] and many in the area desired a Major League team. Following the [[Pittsburgh drug trials]], an unsuccessful attempt was made to purchase the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] and relocate them. However, in 1991, as part of Major League Baseball's two-team expansion (they also added the [[Miami Marlins|Florida (now Miami) Marlins]]), an ownership group representing Denver led by John Antonucci and [[Michael I. Monus]] were granted a franchise; they took the name "Rockies" due to Denver's proximity to the [[Rocky Mountains]], which is reflected in their logo. Monus and Antonucci were forced to drop out in 1992 after Monus' reputation was ruined by an accounting scandal.  Trucking magnate [[Jerry McMorris]] stepped in at the 11th hour to save the franchise, allowing the team to begin play in 1993.  The Rockies shared [[Mile High Stadium]] (which had originally been built for the Zephyrs) with the [[National Football League]]'s [[Denver Broncos]] their first two seasons while [[Coors Field]] was constructed. It was completed for the [[1995 Major League Baseball season]].

In [[1993 Major League Baseball season|1993]], they started play in the [[National League West|Western division]] of the [[National League]]. Since that date, the Rockies have reached the [[Major League Baseball postseason]] three times, each time as the National League [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] team. Twice ([[1995 Major League Baseball season|1995]] and [[2009 Major League Baseball season|2009]]) they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs. In 2007, the Rockies advanced to the [[World Series]], only to be swept by the [[Boston Red Sox]].

The Rockies have played their home games at [[Coors Field]] since 1995. Their newest [[Spring Training]] home, [[Salt River Fields at Talking Stick]] in Scottsdale, Arizona, opened in March 2011 and is shared with the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]].
