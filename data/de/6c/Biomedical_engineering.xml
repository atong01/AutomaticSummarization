Careful study of the different functions and processes of the eyes, ears, and other organs paved the way for improved cameras, television, radio transmitters and receivers, and many other useful tools. These developments have indeed made our lives better, but the best contribution that bionics has made is in the field of biomedical engineering.Biomedical Engineering is the building of useful replacements for various parts of the human body. Modern hospitals now have available spare parts to replace a part of the body that is badly damaged by injury or disease.

Major roles of clinical engineers include training and supervising<space/><link><target>Biomedical Equipment Technician</target><part>biomedical equipment technicians (BMETs)</part></link>, selecting technological products/services and logistically managing their implementation, working with governmental regulators on inspections/audits, and serving as technological consultants for other hospital staff (e.g. physicians, administrators, I.T., etc.). Clinical engineers also advise and collaborate with medical device producers regarding prospective design improvements based on clinical experiences, as well as monitor the progression of the state of the art so as to redirect procurement patterns accordingly.</paragraph><paragraph>Their inherent focus on<space/><italics>practical</italics><space/>implementation of technology has tended to keep them oriented more towards<space/><italics>incremental</italics>-level redesigns and reconfigurations, as opposed to revolutionary research &amp; development or ideas that would be many years from clinical adoption; however, there is a growing effort to expand this time-horizon over which clinical engineers can influence the trajectory of biomedical innovation. In their various roles, they form a &quot;bridge&quot; between the primary designers and the end-users, by combining the perspectives of being both 1) close to the point-of-use, while 2) trained in product and process engineering. Clinical Engineering departments will sometimes hire not just biomedical engineers, but also industrial/systems engineers to help address operations research/optimization, human factors, cost analysis, etc. Also see<space/><link><target>safety engineering</target></link><space/>for a discussion of the procedures used to design safe systems.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Image:SinusRhythmLabels.svg</target><part>200px</part><part>right</part><part>thumb</part><part>Schematic representation of a normal ECG trace showing ''<link><target>sinus rhythm</target></link>;'' an example of widely used clinical medical equipment (operates by applying<space/><link><target>electronic engineering</target></link><space/>to<space/><link><target>electrophysiology</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>medical diagnosis</target></link>).</part></link></paragraph><heading level='2'>Regulatory issues</heading><paragraph>Regulatory issues have been constantly increased in the last decades to respond to the many incidents caused by devices to patients. For example, from 2008 to 2011, in US, there were 119 FDA recalls of medical devices classified as class I. According to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA),<space/><link><target>Class I recall</target></link><space/>is associated to a<italics><space/>situation in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, a product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death</italics><space/><extension extension_name='ref'>U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Medical &amp; Radiation Emitting Device Recalls http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfres/res.cfm</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Regardless of the country-specific legislation, the main regulatory objectives coincide worldwide.<extension extension_name='ref' name=":6">World Health Organization (WHO), 2003 Medical Device Regulations Global overview and guiding principles. http://www.who.int/medical_devices/publications/en/MD_Regulations.pdf (last visit Sept 2013)</extension><space/>For example, in the medical device regulations, a product must be: 1) safe<space/><italics>and</italics><space/>2) effective and 3) for all the manufactured devices</paragraph><paragraph>A product is safe if patients, users and third parties do not run unacceptable risks of physical hazards (death, injuries, ) in its intended use. Protective measures have to be introduced on the devices to reduce residual risks at acceptable level if compared with the benefit derived from the use of it.</paragraph><paragraph>A product is effective if it performs as specified by the manufacturer in the intended use. Effectiveness is achieved through clinical evaluation, compliance to performance standards or demonstrations of substantial equivalence with an already marketed device.</paragraph><paragraph>The previous features have to be ensured for all the manufactured items of the medical device. This requires that a quality system shall be in place for all the relevant entities and processes that may impact safety and effectiveness over the whole medical device lifecyle.</paragraph><paragraph>The medical device engineering area is among the most heavily regulated fields of engineering, and practicing biomedical engineers must routinely consult and cooperate with regulatory law attorneys and other experts. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the principal healthcare regulatory authority in the United States, having jurisdiction over medical<space/><italics>devices, drugs, biologics, and combination</italics><space/>products. The paramount objectives driving policy decisions by the FDA are safety and effectiveness of healthcare products that have to be assured through a quality system in place as specified under<space/><link><target>Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations</target><part>21 CFR 829 regulation</part></link>. In addition, because biomedical engineers often develop devices and technologies for &quot;consumer&quot; use, such as physical therapy devices (which are also &quot;medical&quot; devices), these may also be governed in some respects by the<space/><link><target>Consumer Product Safety Commission</target></link>. The greatest hurdles tend to be 510K &quot;clearance&quot; (typically for Class 2 devices) or pre-market &quot;approval&quot; (typically for drugs and class 3 devices).</paragraph><paragraph>In the European context, safety effectiveness and quality is ensured through the &quot;Conformity Assessment&quot; that is defined as &quot;the method by which a manufacturer demonstrates that its device complies with the requirements of the European<space/><link><target>Medical Devices Directive</target><part>Medical Device Directive</part></link>&quot;. The directive specifies different procedures according to the class of the device ranging from the simple Declaration of Conformity (Annex VII) for Class I devices to EC verification (Annex IV), Production quality assurance (Annex V), Product quality assurance (Annex VI) and Full quality assurance (Annex II). The Medical Device Directive specifies detailed procedures for Certification. In general terms, these procedures include tests and verifications that are to be contained in specific deliveries such as the risk management file, the technical file and the quality system deliveries. The risk management file is the first deliverable that conditions the following design and manufacturing steps. Risk management stage shall drive the product so that product risks are reduced at an acceptable level with respect to the benefits expected for the patients for the use of the device. The<space/><link><target>technical file</target></link><space/>contains all the documentation data and records supporting medical device certification. FDA technical file has similar content although organized in different structure. The Quality System deliverables usually includes procedures that ensure quality throughout all product life cycle. The same standard (ISO EN 13485) is usually applied for quality management systems in US and worldwide.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Image:Hip replacement Image 3684-PH.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>200px</part><part>Implants, such as<space/><link><target>artificial hip</target></link><space/>joints, are generally extensively regulated due to the invasive nature of such devices.</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>In the European Union, there are certifying entities named &quot;<link><target>Notified Body</target><part>Notified Bodies</part></link>&quot;, accredited by European Member States. The Notified Bodies must ensure the effectiveness of the certification process for all medical devices apart from the class I devices where a declaration of conformity produced by the manufacturer is sufficient for marketing. Once a product has passed all the steps required by the Medical Device Directive, the device is entitled to bear a<space/><link><target>CE marking</target></link>, indicating that the device is believed to be safe and effective when used as intended, and, therefore, it can be marketed within the European Union area.</paragraph><paragraph>The different regulatory arrangements sometimes result in particular technologies being developed first for either the U.S. or in Europe depending on the more favorable form of regulation. While nations often strive for substantive harmony to facilitate cross-national distribution, philosophical differences about the<space/><italics>optimal extent</italics><space/>of regulation can be a hindrance; more restrictive regulations seem appealing on an intuitive level, but critics decry the tradeoff cost in terms of slowing access to life-saving developments.</paragraph><heading level='3'>RoHS II</heading><paragraph>Directive 2011/65/EU, better known as RoHS 2 is a recast of legislation originally introduced in 2002. The original EU legislation Restrictions of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronics Devices (RoHS Directive 2002/95/EC) was replaced and superseded by 2011/65/EU published in July 2011 and commonly known as RoHS 2.<link><target>Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive</target><part>RoHS</part></link><space/>seeks to limit the dangerous substances in circulation in electronics products, in particular toxins and heavy metals, which are subsequently released into the environment when such devices are recycled.</paragraph><paragraph>The scope of RoHS 2 is widened to include products previously excluded, such as medical devices and industrial equipment. In addition, manufacturers are now obliged to provide conformity risk assessments and test reports or explain why they are lacking. For the first time, not only manufacturers, but also importers and distributors share a responsibility to ensure Electrical and Electronic Equipment within the scope of RoHS comply with the hazardous substances limits and have a CE mark on their products.</paragraph><heading level='3'>IEC 60601</heading><paragraph>The new International Standard<space/><link><target>IEC 60601</target></link><space/>for home healthcare electro-medical devices defining the requirements for devices used in the home healthcare environment.

The US FDA requires the use of the standard on June 30, 2013, while Health Canada recently extended the required date from June 2012 to April 2013. The North American agencies will only require these standards for new device submissions, while the EU will take the more severe approach of requiring all applicable devices being placed on the market to consider the home healthcare standard.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Training and certification</heading><heading level='3'>Education</heading><paragraph>Biomedical engineers require considerable knowledge of both engineering and biology, and typically have a Master's (M.S.,M.Tech, M.S.E., or M.Eng.) or a Doctoral (Ph.D.) degree in BME (Biomedical Engineering) or another branch of engineering with considerable potential for BME overlap.

The reputation of many undergraduate degrees are also linked to the institution's graduate or research programs, which have some tangible factors for rating, such as research funding and volume, publications and citations. With BME specifically, the ranking of a university's hospital and medical school can also be a significant factor in the perceived prestige of its BME department/program.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Graduate school</target><part>Graduate education</part></link><space/>is a particularly important aspect in BME. While many engineering fields (such as mechanical or electrical engineering) do not need graduate-level training to obtain an entry-level job in their field, the majority of BME positions do prefer or even require them.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos027.htm#outlook'>U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</link><template><target>dead link</target><arg name="date">September 2015</arg></template><space/>- Job Outlook for Engineers</extension><space/>Since most BME-related professions involve scientific research, such as in<space/><link><target>pharmaceutical</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>medical device</target></link><space/>development, graduate education is almost a requirement (as undergraduate degrees typically do not involve sufficient research training and experience). This can be either a Masters or Doctoral level degree; while in certain specialties a Ph.D. is notably more common than in others, it is hardly ever the majority (except in academia). In fact, the perceived need for some kind of graduate credential is so strong that some undergraduate BME programs will actively discourage students from majoring in BME without an expressed intention to also obtain a master's degree or apply to medical school afterwards.</paragraph><paragraph>Graduate programs in BME, like in other scientific fields, are highly varied, and particular programs may emphasize certain aspects within the field. They may also feature extensive collaborative efforts with programs in other fields (such as the University's Medical School or other engineering divisions), owing again to the interdisciplinary nature of BME. M.S. and Ph.D. programs will typically require applicants to have an undergraduate degree in BME, or<space/><italics>another engineering</italics><space/>discipline (plus certain life science coursework), or<space/><italics>life science</italics><space/>(plus certain engineering coursework).</paragraph><paragraph>Education in BME also varies greatly around the world. By virtue of its extensive biotechnology sector, its numerous major universities, and relatively few internal barriers, the U.S. has progressed a great deal in its development of BME education and training opportunities. Europe, which also has a large biotechnology sector and an impressive education system, has encountered trouble in creating uniform standards as the European community attempts to supplant some of the national jurisdictional barriers that still exist. Recently, initiatives such as BIOMEDEA have sprung up to develop BME-related education and professional standards.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.bmt.uni-stuttgart.de/biomedea/biomedea.htm'>BIOMEDEA</link><template><target>dead link</target><arg name="date">September 2015</arg></template><space/><template><target>wayback</target><arg name="url">http://www.bmt.uni-stuttgart.de/biomedea/biomedea.htm<space/></arg><arg name="date">20080506113817<space/></arg></template><template><target>dead link</target><arg name="date">September 2015</arg></template></extension><space/>Other countries, such as Australia, are recognizing and moving to correct deficiencies in their BME education.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&amp;amp;verb=getRecord&amp;amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;amp;identifier=ADA410442'>Biomedical Engineering Curriculum:</link><template><target>dead link</target><arg name="date">September 2015</arg></template><space/>A Comparison Between the USA, Europe and Australia</extension><space/>Also, as high technology endeavors are usually marks of developed nations, some areas of the world are prone to slower development in education, including in BME.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Licensure/certification</heading><paragraph><template><target>See also</target><arg>Professional engineer</arg></template>Engineering licensure in the US is largely optional, and rarely specified by branch/discipline.

For the second exam, called the Principles and Practices, Part 2, or the Professional Engineering exam, candidates may select a particular engineering discipline's content to be tested on; there is currently not an option for BME with this, meaning that any biomedical engineers seeking a license must prepare to take this examination in another category (which does not affect the actual license, since most jurisdictions do not recognize discipline specialties anyway). However, the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) is, as of 2009, exploring the possibility of seeking to implement a BME-specific version of this exam to facilitate biomedical engineers pursuing licensure.</paragraph><paragraph>Beyond governmental registration, certain private-sector professional/industrial organizations also offer certifications with varying degrees of prominence.
