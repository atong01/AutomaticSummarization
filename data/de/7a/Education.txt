'''Education''' is the process of facilitating [[learning]].  [[Knowledge]], [[skill]]s, [[values]], [[belief]]s, and [[habit (psychology)|habits]] of a group of people are transferred to other people, through storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, or research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also educate themselves in a process called [[autodidacticism|autodidactic]] learning.<ref>{{cite book

Education is commonly and formally divided into stages such as [[preschool]], [[primary school]], [[secondary school]] and then [[college]], [[university]] or [[apprenticeship]]. The methodology of teaching is called [[pedagogy]].

A [[right to education]] has been recognized by some governments. At the global level, Article 13 of the [[United Nations]]' 1966 [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] recognizes the right of everyone to an education.<ref name=ICESCR-art13.1>''ICESCR'', Article 13.1</ref> Although [[compulsory education|education is compulsory]] in most places up to a certain age, attendance at [[school]] often isn't, and a minority of parents choose [[home-schooling]], sometimes with the assistance of modern electronic [[educational technology]] (also called e-learning). Education can take place in [[Formality|formal]] or [[Informal education|informal]] settings.

==Etymology==
[[Etymologically]], the word "education" is derived from the Latin ''[[wikt:en:educatio#Latin|ēducātiō]]'' ("A breeding, a bringing up, a rearing") from ''[[wikt:en:educo#Latin|ēdūcō]]'' ("I educate, I train") which is related to the [[homonym]] ''[[wikt:en:educo#Latin|ēdūcō]]'' ("I lead forth, I take out; I raise up, I erect") from ''[[wikt:en:e-#Latin|ē-]]'' ("from, out of") and ''[[wikt:en:duco#Latin|dūcō]]'' ("I lead, I conduct").<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=educate educate].

==History==
{{Main|History of education}}

[[File:Nalanda.jpg|thumb| [[Nalanda]], ancient center for higher learning]]
[[File:Plato's Academy mosaic from Pompeii.jpg|thumb|left|[[Plato]]'s academy, [[mosaic]] from [[Pompeii]]]]

Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their [[knowledge]] beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite book | title=The Mind of Egypt: History and Meaning in the Time of the Pharaohs | author=Assmann, Jan | year=2002 | pages=127}}</ref>[[File:Ricci Guangqi 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Matteo Ricci]] (left) and [[Xu Guangqi]] (right) in the Chinese edition of ''[[Euclid's Elements]]'' published in 1607]]

[[Plato]] founded the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]] in [[Ancient Athens|Athens]], the first institution of higher learning in [[Europe]].<ref name="Br">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Plato|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica|year=2002}}</ref> The city of [[Alexandria]] in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle of [[Ancient Greece]]. There, mathematician [[Euclid]] and anatomist [[Herophilos|Herophilus]] constructed the great [[Library of Alexandria]] and translated the [[Hebrew Bible]] [[Septuagint|into Greek]]. European civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in AD 476.<ref name=autogenerated2>Geoffrey Blainey; ''A Very Short History of the World''; Penguin Books, 2004</ref>

In [[China]], [[Confucius]] (551-479 BCE), of the [[State of Lu]], was the country's most influential ancient philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies of China and neighbors like Korea, Japan and Vietnam. Confucius gathered disciples and searched in vain for a ruler who would adopt his ideals for good governance, but his [[Analects]] were written down by followers and have continued to influence education in East Asia into the modern era.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

After the [[Fall of Rome]], the [[Catholic Church]] became the sole preserver of literate scholarship in Western Europe. The church established [[cathedral schools]] in the Early Middle Ages as centers of advanced education. Some of these establishments ultimately evolved into [[medieval universities]] and forebears of many of Europe's modern universities.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> During the High Middle Ages, [[Chartres Cathedral]] operated the famous and influential [[School of Chartres|Chartres Cathedral School]]. The medieval universities of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged freedom of inquiry, and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers, including [[Thomas Aquinas]] of the [[University of Naples]], [[Robert Grosseteste]] of the [[University of Oxford]], an early expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07037a.htm |work=Catholic Encyclopedia|title=Robert Grosseteste |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 June 1910 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}</ref> and Saint [[Albertus Magnus|Albert the Great]], a pioneer of biological field research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01264a.htm |work=Catholic Encyclopedia|title=St. Albertus Magnus |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 March 1907 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}</ref> Founded in 1088, the [[University of Bologne]] is considered the first, and the oldest continually operating university.<ref>Nuria Sanz, Sjur Bergan: "The heritage of European universities", 2nd edition, Higher Education Series No. 7, Council of Europe, 2006, ISBN, p.136</ref>

Elsewhere during the Middle Ages, [[Islamic science]] and [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|mathematics]] flourished under the Islamic [[caliphate]] which was established across the Middle East, extending from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the west to the [[Indus]] in the east and to the [[Almoravid Dynasty]] and [[Mali Empire]] in the south.

[[The Renaissance]] in Europe ushered in a [[Scientific revolution|new age of scientific and intellectual inquiry]] and appreciation of ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. Around 1450, [[Johannes Gutenberg]] developed a printing press, which allowed works of literature to spread more quickly. The European Age of Empires saw European ideas of education in philosophy, religion, arts and sciences spread out across the globe. Missionaries and scholars also brought back new ideas from other civilisations&nbsp;— as with the [[Jesuit China missions]] who played a significant role in the transmission of knowledge, science, and culture between China and Europe, translating works from Europe like [[Euclid's Elements]] for Chinese scholars and the thoughts of [[Confucius]] for European audiences. [[The Enlightenment]] saw the emergence of a more secular educational outlook in Europe.

In most countries today, full-time education, whether at school or [[homeschooling|otherwise]], is compulsory for all children up to a certain age. Due to this the proliferation of compulsory education, combined with population growth, [[UNESCO]] has calculated that in the next 30&nbsp;years more people will receive formal education than in all of human history thus far.<ref>Robinson, K.: [http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html ''Schools Kill Creativity'']. TED Talks, 2006, Monterrey, CA, USA.</ref>

==Formal education==
Formal education occurs in a structured environment whose explicit purpose is teaching students. Usually, formal education takes place in a school environment with classrooms of multiple students learning together with a trained, certified teacher of the subject. Most school systems are designed around a set of values or ideals that govern all educational choices in that system. Such choices include curriculum, physical classroom design, student-teacher interactions, methods of assessment, class size, educational activities, and more.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://enhancinged.wgbh.org/started/what/formal.html|title = Enhancing Education|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.competencecentre.eu/index.php/home/74-what-is-the-difference-between-qinformalq-and-qnon-formalq-learning|title = Perspectives Competence Centre, Lifeling Learning Programme|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>

===Preschool===
[[File:Parent's day at Eirfan's Kindergarten.jpg|thumb|Young children in a [[kindergarten]] in Japan]]
{{Main|Early childhood education}}
Preschools provide education from ages approximately three to seven, depending on the country, when children enter [[primary education]]. These are also known as [[nursery schools]] and as [[kindergarten]], except in the USA, where kindergarten is a term used for primary education. Kindergarten "provide[s] a child-centered, preschool curriculum for three- to seven-year-old children that aim[s] at unfolding the child's physical, intellectual, and moral nature with balanced emphasis on each of them."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ross|first=Elizabeth Dale|title=The Kindergarten Crusade: The Establishment of Preschool in the United States|year=1976|publisher=Athens: Ohio University Press|page=1}}</ref>

===Primary===
[[File:School children line Cochin Kerala India.jpg|thumb|School children line, in Kerala, [[India]]]]
{{Main|Primary education}}
Primary (or elementary) education consists of the first five to seven years of formal, structured education. In general, primary education consists of six to eight years of schooling starting at the age of five or six, although this varies between, and sometimes within, countries. Globally, around 89% of children aged  six to twelve are enrolled in primary education, and this proportion is rising.<ref>UNESCO, Education For All Monitoring Report 2008, Net Enrollment Rate in primary education</ref> Under the [[Education For All]] programs driven by [[UNESCO]], most countries have committed to achieving universal enrollment in primary education by 2015, and in many countries, it is compulsory. The division between primary and [[secondary education]] is somewhat arbitrary, but it generally occurs at about eleven or twelve years of age. Some education systems have separate [[middle school]]s, with the transition to the final stage of secondary education taking place at around the age of fourteen. Schools that provide primary education, are mostly referred to as ''primary schools ''or ''elementary schools''. Primary schools are often subdivided into [[infant school]]s and [[junior school]].

In India, for example, [[Compulsory education#Variation in countries|compulsory education]] spans over twelve years, with eight years of elementary education, five years of primary schooling and three years of upper primary schooling. Various states in the republic of India provide 12 years of compulsory school education based on a national [[curriculum]] framework designed by the [[National Council of Educational Research and Training]].

===Secondary===
[[File:Ashs-teacher-and-students.jpg|thumb|Students working with a teacher at Albany Senior High School, [[New Zealand]]]]
{{Main|Secondary education}}
In most contemporary educational systems of the world, secondary education comprises the formal education that occurs during [[adolescence]]. It is characterized by transition from the typically compulsory, comprehensive [[primary education]] for [[minor (law)|minor]]s, to the optional, selective [[Tertiary education|tertiary]], "postsecondary", or "[[Higher education|higher]]" education (e.g. [[university]], vocational school) for [[adult]]s. Depending on the system, schools for this period, or a part of it, may be called secondary or [[high school]]s, [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]s, [[lyceum]]s, middle schools, [[college]]s, or vocational schools. The exact meaning of any of these terms varies from one system to another. The exact boundary between primary and secondary education also varies from country to country and even within them, but is generally around the seventh to the tenth year of schooling. Secondary education occurs mainly during the teenage years. In the United States, Canada and [[Australia]], primary and secondary education together are sometimes referred to as [[K–12 (education)|K-12]] education, and in New Zealand Year 1–13 is used. The purpose of secondary education can be to give [[common knowledge]], to prepare for [[higher education]], or to train directly in a [[profession]].

Secondary education in the United States did not emerge until 1910, with the rise of large corporations and advancing technology in factories, which required [[skilled worker]]s. In order to meet this new job demand, [[high school]]s were created, with a curriculum focused on practical job skills that would better prepare students for [[White-collar worker|white collar]] or skilled [[Blue-collar worker|blue collar]] work. This proved beneficial for both employers and employees, since the improved human capital lowered costs for the employer, while skilled employees received a higher wages.

Secondary education has a longer history in Europe, where grammar schools or academies date from as early as the 16th century, in the form of [[Public education|public schools]], [[fee-paying school]]s, or charitable educational foundations, which themselves date even further back.

[[Community college]]s offer another option at this transitional stage of education. They provide nonresidential junior college courses to people living in a particular area.

===Tertiary (higher)===
[[File:Distributed Intelligent Systems Department laboratory.jpg|thumb|Students in a laboratory, [[Saint Petersburg State Polytechnical University]]]]
{{see also|Higher education|Adult education}}
Higher education, also called tertiary, third stage, or postsecondary education, is the non-compulsory educational level that follows the completion of a school such as a high school or [[secondary school]]. Tertiary education is normally taken to include [[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate education]], as well as [[vocational education|vocational education and training]]. Colleges and universities mainly provide tertiary education. Collectively, these are sometimes known as tertiary institutions. Individuals who complete tertiary education generally receive [[Academic certificate|certificates]], [[diploma]]s, or [[academic degree]]s.

Higher education typically involves work towards a degree-level or [[foundation degree]] qualification. In most developed countries a high proportion of the population (up to 50%) now enter higher education at some time in their lives. Higher education is therefore very important to national [[economies]], both as a significant industry in its own right, and as a source of trained and educated personnel for the rest of the economy.

University education includes teaching, research, and social services activities, and it includes both the undergraduate level (sometimes referred to as [[tertiary education]]) and the [[graduate student|graduate]] (or postgraduate) level (sometimes referred to as [[graduate school]]). Universities are generally composed of several colleges. In the United States, universities can be private and independent like [[Yale University]]; public and state-governed like the [[Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education]]; or independent but state-funded like the [[University of Virginia]]. A number of career specific courses are now available to students through the [[Internet]].

One type of university education is a [[liberal arts]] education, which can be defined as a "[[college]] or [[university]] [[curriculum]] aimed at imparting broad general knowledge and developing general intellectual capacities, in contrast to a professional, [[vocational education|vocational]], or technical curriculum."<ref>{{cite web | title = Liberal Arts: ''Britannica Concise Encyclopædia''| work = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | url= http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9370154/liberal-arts}}</ref> Although what is known today as liberal arts education began in [[Europe]],<ref>{{cite journal | first =Philip | last =Harriman | title = Antecedents of the Liberal Arts College| year =1935|jstor=1975506 | pages =63–71 | volume =6 | issue =2 | journal =The Journal of Higher Education | ref =harv | doi =10.2307/1975506}}</ref> the term "[[liberal arts college]]" is more commonly associated with institutions in the [[United States]].<ref>{{Cite news|work=Inside Higher Ed|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/04/06/liberalarts|accessdate=2015-01-08|date=2009-04-06|first=Elizabeth|last=Redden|title=A Global Liberal Arts Alliance}}</ref>

===Vocational===
[[File:Fotothek df n-10 0000828.jpg|thumb|Carpentry is normally learned through [[apprenticeship]].]]
{{Main|Vocational education}}

[[Vocational education]] is a form of education focused on direct and practical training for a specific trade or craft. Vocational education may come in the form of an [[apprenticeship]] or [[internship]] as well as institutions teaching courses such as [[carpentry]], [[agriculture]], [[engineering]], [[medicine]], [[architecture]] and [[the arts]].

===Special===
{{Main|Special education}}
In the past, those who were disabled were often not eligible for public education. Children with disabilities were repeatedly denied an education by [[physicians]] or special tutors.  These early physicians (people like [[Itard]], [[Édouard Séguin|Seguin]], [[Samuel Gridley Howe|Howe]], [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet|Gallaudet]]) set the foundation for special education today. They focused on individualized instruction and functional skills.  In its early years, special education was only provided to people with severe disabilities, but more recently it has been opened to anyone who has experienced difficulty learning.<ref name="Credo Reference">{{Cite book|title=Special Education|year=2004|publisher=Oxford: Elsevier Science and Technology}}</ref>

==Other educational forms==

===Alternative===
{{Main|Alternative education}}
While considered "alternative" today, most alternative systems have existed since ancient times. After the public school system was widely developed beginning in the 19th century, some parents found reasons to be discontented with the new system. [[Alternative education]] developed in part as a reaction to perceived limitations and failings of [[traditional education]]. A broad range of educational approaches emerged, including [[alternative school]]s, [[autodidacticism|self learning]], [[homeschooling]] and [[unschooling]]. Example [[alternative school]]s include [[Montessori method|Montessori school]]s, [[Waldorf education|Waldorf school]]s (or [[Rudolf Steiner|Steiner]] schools), [[List of Friends Schools|Friends school]]s, [[Sands School]], [[Summerhill School]], [[The Peepal Grove School]], [[Sudbury Valley School]], [[Jiddu Krishnamurti|Krishnamurti school]]s, and [[open classroom]] schools. [[Charter school]]s are another example of alternative education, which have in the recent years grown in numbers in the US and gained greater importance in its public education system.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED535992.pdf|title = Federal Investment in Charter Schools|date = October 2011|accessdate = October 2, 2015|website = Institute of Education Sciences|publisher = Center for American Progress|last = Lazarin|first = Melissa}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/10/charter-schools_n_4419341.html|title = Charter Schools Continue Dramatic Growth Despite Controversies|date = December 10, 2013|accessdate = October 2, 2015|website = The Huffington Post|publisher = The Huffington Post|last = Resmovits|first = Joy}}</ref>

In time, some ideas from these experiments and paradigm challenges may be adopted as the norm in education, just as [[Friedrich Fröbel]]'s approach to [[early childhood education]] in 19th century Germany has been incorporated into contemporary [[kindergarten]] classrooms. Other influential writers and thinkers have included the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[humanitarianism|humanitarian]] [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]]; the [[United States|American]] [[transcendentalism|transcendentalist]]s [[Amos Bronson Alcott]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]]; the founders of [[educational progressivism|progressive education]], [[John Dewey]] and [[Francis Wayland Parker|Francis Parker]]; and educational pioneers such as [[Maria Montessori]] and [[Rudolf Steiner]], and more recently [[John Caldwell Holt]], [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]], [[Frederick Mayer]], [[George Dennison]] and [[Ivan Illich]].

===Indigenous===
[[File:Schoolyard essay2.JPG|thumb|alt=Na Schoolyard.|[[Indigenous education|Teaching indigenous knowledge]], models, methods in [[Yanyuan County]], Sichuan in China]]
{{Main|Indigenous education}}
[[Indigenous education]] refers to the inclusion of indigenous knowledge, models, methods, and content within formal and non-formal educational systems. Often in a post-colonial context, the growing recognition and use of indigenous education methods can be a response to the erosion and loss of indigenous knowledge and language through the processes of colonialism. Furthermore, it can enable indigenous communities to "reclaim and revalue their languages and cultures, and in so doing, improve the educational success of indigenous students."<ref>{{Cite journal|jstor=3099875|author=May, S. and Aikman, S. |title=Indigenous Education: Addressing Current Issues and Developments|journal=Comparative Education|volume= 39|issue=2 |year=2003|pages= 139–145|doi=10.1080/03050060302549}}</ref>

===Informal learning===
{{main|informal learning}}
'''Informal learning''' is one of three forms of learning defined by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD). Informal learning occurs in a variety of places, such as at [[home]], [[employment|work]], and through daily interactions and shared relationships among members of society. For many learners this includes [[language acquisition]], [[cultural norm]]s and [[manners]]. Informal learning for young people is an ongoing process that also occurs in a variety of places, such as [[out of school learning|out of school time]], in [[youth programs]] at [[community center]]s and [[media lab]]s.

Informal learning usually takes place outside educational [[school|establishments]], does not follow a specified [[curriculum]] and may originate accidentally, sporadically, in association with certain occasions, from changing [[practical]] requirements. It is not necessarily planned to be [[pedagogically]] conscious, systematic and according to [[course (education)|subject]]s, but rather unconsciously incidental, [[holistic]]ally [[problem]]-related, and related to situation [[management]] and fitness for [[life]]. It is experienced directly in its "[[natural]]" function of everyday life and is often spontaneous.

The concept of 'education through recreation' was applied to childhood development in the 19th century.<ref>{{cite journal | first =GH | last =Mead | title = The Relation of Play to Education| journal = University Record| year =1896| pages =141–145 | volume =1 | url=http://www.brocku.ca/MeadProject/Mead/pubs/Mead_1896.html}}</ref> In the early 20th century, the concept was broadened to include young adults but the emphasis was on physical activities.<ref>{{cite journal | first =GE | last =Johnson | title = Education through recreation| publisher = Cleveland Foundation, Ohio| year =1916|  url=http://www.archive.org/stream/educationthrough00johnuoft#page/n5/mode/2up}}</ref> [[L.P. Jacks]], also an early proponent of lifelong learning, described education through recreation: "''A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play, his labour and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his recreation. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. To himself he always seems to be doing both. Enough for him that he does it well.''"<ref>{{cite book | first =LP | last =Jacks | title = Education through recreation| publisher = New York: Harper and Brothers| year =1932| pages =1–2 }}</ref> Education through recreation is the opportunity to learn in a seamless fashion through all of life's activities.<ref name="Ullah 2012 165–170">{{cite journal | first =Sha | last =Ullah | title = Learning surgically oriented anatomy in a student-run extracurricular club: an education through recreation initiative| journal = Anat Sci Educ| year =2012| pages =165–170 | volume =5 |pmid=22434649 | doi=10.1002/ase.1273 | url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=1&article=1175&context=vivianmcalister&type=additional | last2 =Bodrogi | first2 =Andrew | last3 =Cristea | first3 =Octav | last4 =Johnson | first4 =Marjorie | last5 =McAlister | first5 =Vivian C. | issue =3}}</ref> The concept has been revived by the [[University of Western Ontario]] to teach [[anatomy]] to medical students.<ref name="Ullah 2012 165–170"/>

===Self-directed learning===
{{Main|Autodidacticism}}
[[Autodidacticism]] (also autodidactism) is a contemplative, absorbing process, of "learning on your own" or "by yourself", or as a self-teacher. Some [[autodidacts]] spend a great deal of time reviewing the resources of libraries and educational websites. One may become an autodidact at nearly any point in one's life. While some may have been informed in a conventional manner in a particular field, they may choose to inform themselves in other, often unrelated areas. [[List of autodidacts|Notable autodidacts]] include [[Abraham Lincoln]] (U.S. president), [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] (mathematician), [[Michael Faraday]] (chemist and physicist), [[Charles Darwin]] (naturalist), [[Thomas Alva Edison]] (inventor), [[Tadao Ando]] (architect), [[George Bernard Shaw]] (playwright), [[Frank Zappa]] (composer, recording engineer, film director), and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (engineer, scientist, mathematician).

===Open education and electronic technology===
''Main articles: [[Open education]]'' and ''[[Educational technology]]''

In 2012,  the modern use of electronic [[educational technology]] (also called e-learning) had grown at 14 times the rate of traditional learning.{{clarify|over what time period?|date=April 2014}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.knewton.com/digital-education/ |title=The State of Digital Education Infographic - #edtech #edutech #edu11 |publisher=Knewton.com |accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref> Open education is fast growing to become the dominant form of education, for many reasons such as its efficiency and results compared to traditional methods.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lohr |first=Steve |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/19/study-finds-that-online-education-beats-the-classroom/ |title=Study Finds That Online Education Beats the Classroom&nbsp;— NYTimes.com |work=The New York Times |date=19 August 2009 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref> Cost of education has been an issue throughout history, and a major political issue in most countries today.

The conventional merit-system degree is currently not as common in open education as it is in campus universities, although some open universities do already offer conventional degrees such as the [[Open University]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Presently, many of the major open education sources offer their own form of certificate. Due to the popularity of open education, these new kind of academic certificates are gaining more respect and equal "[[Academic capital|academic value]]" to traditional degrees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.good.is/posts/is-the-certificate-the-new-college-degree |title=Is the Certificate the New College Degree? &#124; Jobs on GOOD |publisher=Good.is |date=8 June 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref> Many open universities are working to have the ability to offer students standardized testing and traditional degrees and credentials.<ref>

A study conducted by the [[UNESCO International Institute for Educational Planning]] indicates that stronger capacities in educational planning and management may have an important spill-over effect on the system as a whole.<ref>de Grauwe, A. 2009. ''Without capacity, there is no development''. Paris: UNESCO-IIPE [http://www.iiep.unesco.org/en/capacity-development/capacity-development-strategies/synthesis.html].</ref> Sustainable capacity development requires complex interventions at the institutional, organizational and individual levels that could be based on some foundational principles:
* national leadership and ownership should be the touchstone of any intervention;
* strategies must be context relevant and context specific;{{Clarify|date=October 2012}}
* plans should employ an integrated set of complementary interventions, though implementation may need to proceed in steps;{{clarify|"one step at a time?" What are they trying to say here?|date=October 2012}}
* partners should commit to a long-term investment in capacity development, while working towards some short-term achievements;
* outside intervention should be conditional on an impact assessment of national capacities at various levels;
* a certain percentage of students should be removed for improvisation of academics (usually practiced in schools, after 10th grade).

===Internationalization===
Nearly every country now has [[Universal Primary Education]].

Similarities&nbsp;— in systems or even in ideas&nbsp;— that schools share internationally have led to an increase in international student exchanges. The European Socrates-[[Erasmus]] Program<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.erasmus.ac.uk |title=Socrates-Erasmus Program |publisher=Erasmus.ac.uk |accessdate=2010-06-19}}</ref> facilitates exchanges across European universities. The [[Soros Foundation]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soros.org/ |title=Soros Foundation |publisher=Soros.org |accessdate=2010-06-19}}</ref> provides many opportunities for students from central Asia and eastern Europe. Programs such as the [[International Baccalaureate]] have contributed to the internationalization of education. The [[global campus]] online, led by American universities, allows free access to class materials and lecture files recorded during the actual classes.

===Education and technology in developing countries===
[[File:OLPC Haiti.jpg|thumb|right|The OLPC laptop being introduced to children in [[Haiti]]]]
Technology plays an increasingly significant role in improving access to education for people living in impoverished areas and [[developing countries]]. Charities like [[One Laptop per Child]] are dedicated to providing infrastructures through which the disadvantaged may access educational materials.

The [[One Laptop per Child|OLPC foundation]], a group out of [[MIT Media Lab]] and supported by several major corporations, has a stated mission to develop a [[$100 laptop]] for delivering [[educational software]]. The laptops were widely available as of 2008. They are sold at cost or given away based on donations.

In Africa, the [[New Partnership for Africa's Development]] (NEPAD) has launched an "[[New Partnership for Africa's Development E-School Program|e-school program]]" to provide all 600,000 primary and high schools with computer equipment, learning materials and [[internet access]] within 10 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/network-wifi/3361705/african-nations-embrace-e-learning-says-new-report/ |title=African nations embrace e-learning, says new report |publisher=PC Advisor |date=16 October 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref> An International Development Agency project called nabuur.com,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nabuur.com/ |title=nabuur.com |publisher=nabuur.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}</ref> started with the support of former American President [[Bill Clinton]], uses the [[Internet]] to allow co-operation by individuals on issues of social development.

[[India]] is developing technologies that will bypass land-based [[telephone]] and Internet infrastructure to deliver [[distance learning]] directly to its students. In 2004, the [[Indian Space Research Organization]] launched [[GSAT-3|EDUSAT]], a communications satellite providing access to educational materials that can reach more of the country's population at a greatly reduced cost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isro.org/satellites/edusat.aspx |title=EDUSAT |publisher=[[ISRO]] |accessdate=2013-01-01}}</ref>

===Private vs public funding in developing countries===
Research into LCPS (low cost private schools) found that over 5 years to July 2013, debate around LCPSs to achieving [[Education for All]] (EFA) objectives was polarised and finding growing coverage in international policy.<ref name=report>{{cite web|url=http://www.eldis.org/go/display&type=Document&id=65993#.Uk1L14akrON|title=Low-cost private schools: evidence, approaches and emerging issues|publisher=Eldis|accessdate=10 January 2014}}</ref> The polarisation was due to disputes around whether the schools are affordable for the poor, reach disadvantaged groups, provide quality education, support or undermine equality, and are financially sustainable.
The report examined the main challenges encountered by development organisations which support LCPSs.<ref name=report/> Surveys suggest these types of schools are expanding across Africa and Asia. This success is attributed to excess demand. These surveys found concern for:
*Equity: This concern is widely found in the literature, suggesting the growth in low-cost private schooling may be exacerbating or perpetuating already existing inequalities in developing countries, between urban and rural populations, lower- and higher-income families, and between girls and boys. The report findings suggest that girls may be underrepresented and that LCPS are reaching low-income families in smaller numbers than higher-income families.
*Quality and educational outcomes: It is difficult to generalize about the quality of private schools. While most achieve better results than government counterparts, even after their social background is taken into account, some studies find the opposite. Quality in terms of levels of teacher absence, teaching activity, and pupil to teacher ratios in some countries are better in LCPSs than in government schools.
*Choice and affordability for the poor: Parents can choose private schools because of perceptions of better-quality teaching and facilities, and an English language instruction preference. Nevertheless, the concept of 'choice' does not apply in all contexts, or to all groups in society, partly because of limited affordability (which excludes most of the poorest) and other forms of exclusion, related to caste or social status.
*Cost-effectiveness and financial sustainability: There is evidence that private schools operate at low cost by keeping teacher salaries low, and their financial situation may be precarious where they are reliant on fees from low-income households.
The report showed some cases of successful voucher and subsidy programmes; evaluations of international support to the sector are not widespread.<ref name=report/> Addressing regulatory ineffectiveness is a key challenge. Emerging approaches stress the importance of understanding the political economy of the market for LCPS, specifically how relationships of power and accountability between users, government, and private providers can produce better education outcomes for the poor.

==Educational theory==
[[File:FinnGerberBoydZaharias2005.png|right|thumb|A class size experiment in the United States found that attending small classes for 3 or more years in the early grades increased [[high school]] [[graduation]] rates of students from [[low income]] families.<ref name=finn>{{Cite journal|author=Finn, J.

{{main|Educational theory}}

===Purpose of schools===
Individual purposes for pursuing education can vary. Understanding the goals and means of educational [[socialization]] processes may also differ according to the [[sociological paradigm]] used.

The early years of schooling generally focus around developing basic [[interpersonal communication]] and [[literacy]] skills. This lays a foundation for more complex skills and subjects. Later, education usually turns toward gaining the knowledge and skills needed to create value and establish a [[livelihood]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/opub/ooq/2006/fall/oochart.pdf|title=OOChart:Education and income: More education is key to higher earnings|work=Occupational Outlook Quarterly|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=10 January 2014}}</ref>

People also pursue education for its own sake to satisfy innate curiosity, out of interest in a specific subject or skill, or for overall [[Personal development planning|personal development]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reed.edu/apply/news_and_articles/knowledge.html |title=Reed College &#124; Reed College Admission Office |publisher=Reed.edu |accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref>

Education is often understood as a means of overcoming handicaps, achieving greater equality, and acquiring wealth and status for all (Sargent 1994). Education is also often perceived as a place where children can develop according to their unique needs and potentials,<ref>Schofield, K. (1999). [https://web.archive.org/web/20020214072003/http://www.aspa.asn.au/papers/eqfinalc.PDF The Purposes of Education], Queensland State Education</ref> with the purpose of developing every individual to their full potential.

===Educational psychology===
{{Main|Educational psychology}}
[[Educational psychology]] is the study of how humans learn in educational settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching, and the [[social psychology]] of [[school]]s as [[organization]]s. Although the terms "educational psychology" and "school psychology" are often used interchangeably, researchers and theorists are likely to be identified as [[:Category:Educational psychologists|educational psychologists]], whereas practitioners in schools or school-related settings are identified as [[school psychologist]]s. Educational psychology is concerned with the processes of educational attainment in the general population and in sub-populations such as [[gifted]] children and those with specific [[disabilities]].
[[File:2013. Донецк 336.jpg|thumb|Knowledge Day in [[Donetsk]], [[Ukraine]], 2013]]
Educational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with other disciplines. It is informed primarily by [[psychology]], bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous to the relationship between [[medicine]] and [[biology]]. Educational psychology in turn informs a wide range of specialties within educational studies, including [[instructional design]], [[educational technology]], curriculum development, [[organizational learning]], [[special education]] and [[classroom management]]. Educational psychology both draws from and contributes to [[cognitive science]] and the [[learning sciences]]. In universities, departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education, possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks (Lucas, Blazek, & Raley, 2006).

===The intelligence–education relationship===
{{Main|Psychology of education}}
[[Intelligence]] is an important factor in how the individual responds to education. Those who have a genetic advantage of being more intelligent than others tend to perform better at school and go on to higher levels of education.<ref>Butler, S., Marsh, H., & Sheppard, J. (1985). Seven year longitudinal study of the early prediction of reading achievement. Journal of Educational Psychology, 77, 349-361.</ref> This effect is also observable in the opposite direction, in that education increases measurable intelligence.<ref>Baltes, P., & Reinert, G. (1969). Cohort effects in cognitive development in children as revealed by cross sectional sequences. Developmental Psychology, 1, 169-177</ref> Studies have shown that while educational attainment is important in predicting intelligence in later life, intelligence at 8 years old is more predictive of intelligence at 53, than measures of educational attainment.<ref>Richards, M., Sacker, A. (2003) Lifetime Antecedents of Cognitive Reserve. Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology, 25, 614-624</ref> Furthermore, it is likely that this trend arises due to genetic factors. As twin studies have shown, inherited traits are more important in predicting educational attainment than any environmental measures.<ref>Johnson, W., McGue, M., Iacono, W. (2006). Genetic and environmental influences on academic achievement trajectories during adolescence. Developmental Psychology, 42, 514-532.</ref> Also, educational attainment and intelligence share more than one half of their genetic influences, suggesting the two are highly related.

===Learning modalities===
There has been much interest in learning modalities and styles over the last two decades. The most commonly employed learning modalities are:<ref>Swassing, R. H., Barbe, W. B., & Milone, M. N. (1979). ''The Swassing-Barbe Modality Index: Zaner-Bloser Modality Kit''. Columbus, OH: Zaner-Bloser.</ref>

* [[Visual]]: learning based on observation and seeing what is being learned.
* [[Hearing (sense)|Auditory]]: learning based on listening to instructions/information.
* [[Kinesthetic]]: learning based on movement, e.g. hands-on work and engaging in activities.

Other commonly employed modalities include [[music]]al, [[interpersonal]], [[Verbal reasoning|verbal]], [[logical]], and [[intrapersonal]].

Dunn and Dunn<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.learningstyles.net/ |title=Dunn and Dunn |publisher=Learningstyles.net | accessdate=2009-04-20}}</ref> focused on identifying relevant stimuli that may influence learning and manipulating the school environment, at about the same time as [[Joseph Renzulli]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/renzulli.shtml |title=Biographer of Renzulli |publisher=Indiana.edu | accessdate=2009-04-20}}</ref> recommended varying teaching strategies. [[Howard Gardner]]<ref>[http://www.thomasarmstrong.com/multiple_intelligences.htm Thomas Armstrong's website] detailing Multiple Intelligences</ref> identified a wide range of modalities in his [[Multiple Intelligences]] theories. The [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]] and [[Keirsey Temperament Sorter]], based on the works of [[Jung]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keirsey.com/ |title=Keirsey web-site |publisher=Keirsey.com | accessdate=2009-04-20}}</ref> focus on understanding how people's personality affects the way they interact personally, and how this affects the way individuals respond to each other within the learning environment. The work of [[David Kolb]] and [[Anthony Gregorc]]'s Type Delineator<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.algonquincollege.com/edtech/gened/styles.html |title=Type Delineator description |publisher=Algonquincollege.com | accessdate=2009-04-20}}</ref> follows a similar but more simplified approach.

Some theories propose that all individuals benefit from a variety of learning modalities, while others suggest that individuals may have preferred learning styles, learning more easily through visual or kinesthetic experiences.<ref>Barbe, W. B., & Swassing, R. H., with M. N. Milone. (1979). ''Teaching through modality strengths: Concepts and practices''. Columbus, OH: Zaner-Bloser</ref> A consequence of the latter theory is that effective teaching should present a variety of teaching methods which cover all three learning modalities so that different students have equal opportunities to learn in a way that is effective for them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C005704/content_hwl_learningmodalities.php3 |title=Learning modality description from the Learning Curve website |publisher=Library.thinkquest.org | accessdate=2010-06-19}}</ref> Guy Claxton has questioned the extent that [[learning styles]] such as Visual, Auditory and Kinesthetic(VAK) are helpful, particularly as they can have a tendency to label children and therefore restrict learning.<ref name="titleGuy Claxton speaking on What's The Point of School">{{cite web |url=http://www.dystalk.com/talks/49-whats-the-point-of-school |title=Guy Claxton speaking on What's The Point of School?|publisher=dystalk.com |accessdate=2009-04-23 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Learner%20Responsibility.pdf | title = Learner Responsibility in Management Education, or Ventures into Forbidden Research (with Comments) | author = J.

===Philosophy===
[[File:LockeEducation1693.jpg|right|thumb|[[John Locke]]'s work ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]'' was written in 1693 and still reflects traditional education priorities in the Western world.]]
{{Main|Philosophy of education}}
As an academic field, philosophy of education is "the philosophical study of education and its problems&nbsp;(...) its central subject matter is education, and its methods are those of [[philosophy]]".<ref name=NoddingsPOE>{{Cite book | last = Noddings| first = Nel| title = Philosophy of Education| publisher = Westview Press| year = 1995| location = Boulder, CO| isbn = 0-8133-8429-X|page=1}}</ref> "The philosophy of education may be either the philosophy of the process of education or the philosophy of the discipline of education. That is, it may be part of the discipline in the sense of being concerned with the aims, forms, methods, or results of the process of educating or being educated; or it may be metadisciplinary in the sense of being concerned with the concepts, aims, and methods of the discipline."<ref name=POEE>{{Cite book | last1 = Frankena | first1 = William K. | last2 = Raybeck | first2 = Nathan | last3 = Burbules | first3 = Nicholas | contribution = Philosophy of Education | year = 2002 | title = Encyclopedia of Education, 2nd edition | editor-last = Guthrie | editor-first = James W. | place = New York, NY | publisher = Macmillan Reference | isbn= 0-02-865594-X}}</ref> As such, it is both part of the field of education and a field of [[applied philosophy]], drawing from fields of [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[axiology]] and the philosophical approaches ([[speculative philosophy|speculative]], prescriptive, and/or [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]]) to address questions in and about [[pedagogy]], [[education policy]], and [[curriculum]], as well as the process of [[learning theory (education)|learning]], to name a few.<ref>{{Harvnb|Noddings|1995|pages=1–6}}</ref> For example, it might study what constitutes upbringing and education, the values and norms revealed through upbringing and educational practices, the limits and legitimization of education as an academic discipline, and the relation between [[education theory]] and practice.

===Curriculum===
{{Main|Curriculum|Curriculum theory|List of academic disciplines}}
In formal education, a [[curriculum]] is the set of courses and their content offered at a [[school]] or [[university]]. As an idea, '''curriculum''' stems from the [[Latin]] word for ''[[race course]]'', referring to the course of [[wikt:deed|deeds]] and experiences through which [[child]]ren grow to become mature [[adult]]s. A curriculum is prescriptive, and is based on a more general [[syllabus]] which merely specifies what topics must be understood and to what level to achieve a particular grade or standard.

An [[List of academic disciplines|academic discipline]] is a branch of knowledge which is formally taught, either at the university–or via some other such method. Each discipline usually has several sub-disciplines or branches, and distinguishing lines are often both arbitrary and ambiguous. Examples of broad areas of academic disciplines include the [[natural science]]s, [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[social science]]s, [[humanities]] and [[applied science]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.curriculumonline.gov.uk/Default.htm |title=Examples of subjects |publisher=Curriculumonline.gov.uk |accessdate=2009-04-20}}</ref>

Educational institutions may incorporate [[fine arts]] as part of K-12 grade curricula or within majors at [[college]]s and universities as electives.  The various types of fine arts are music, dance, and theater.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.educationworld.com/standards/national/arts/index.shtml |title=Fine Arts |publisher=Education World |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}</ref>

===Instruction===
Instruction is the facilitation of another's learning. Instructors in primary and secondary institutions are often called [[teacher]]s, and they direct the education of [[student]]s and might draw on many [[course (education)|subjects]] like [[Reading (process)|reading]], [[writing]], [[mathematics]], [[science]] and [[history]]. Instructors in post-secondary institutions might be called [[teacher]]s, instructors, or [[professor]]s, depending on the type of institution; and they primarily teach only their specific discipline. Studies from the United States suggest that the quality of teachers is the single most important factor affecting student performance, and that countries which score highly on international tests have multiple policies in place to ensure that the teachers they employ are as effective as possible.<ref>{{Cite book| last =Winters| first =Marcus| title =Teachers Matter: Rethinking How Public Schools Identify, Reward, and Retain Great Educators| publisher =Rowman & Littlefield| page =160| isbn =978-1-4422-1077-6}}</ref><ref name="WRS">[http://www.mckinsey.com/App_Media/Reports/SSO/Worlds_School_Systems_Final.pdf How the world's best-performing school systems come out on top]. mckinsey.com. September 2007</ref> With the passing of NCLB in the United States (No Child Left Behind), teachers must be highly qualified. A popular way to gauge teaching performance is to use student evaluations of teachers (SETS), but these evaluations have been criticized for being counterproductive to learning and inaccurate due to student bias.<ref name=autogenerated3>{{Cite journal|url= https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&fileID=8113 | title = Natural Learning in Higher Education| author = J.

==Economics of education==
{{Main|Economics of education}}
[[File:Students, Hakha, Chin State, Myanmar.jpg|thumb|right|Students on their way to school, [[Hakha]], [[Chin State]], [[Burma|Myanmar]]]]
It has been argued that high rates of education are essential for countries to be able to achieve high levels of [[economic growth]].<ref>{{Cite book|author=Eric A. Hanushek|title=Economic outcomes and school quality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=na7rAAAACAAJ|accessdate=21 October 2011|year=2005|publisher=International Institute for Educational Planning|isbn=978-92-803-1279-9}}</ref> Empirical analyses tend to support the theoretical prediction that poor countries should grow faster than rich countries because they can adopt cutting edge technologies already tried and tested by rich countries. However, [[technology transfer]] requires knowledgeable managers and engineers who are able to operate new machines or production practices borrowed from the leader in order to close the gap through imitation. Therefore, a country's ability to learn from the leader is a function of its stock of "[[human capital]]". Recent study of the determinants of aggregate economic growth have stressed the importance of fundamental economic institutions<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James A. Robinson|title=The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation|url=http://economics.mit.edu/files/4123|jstor=2677930 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.244582|journal=American Economic Review|volume= 91|issue=5 |year=2001|pages=1369–1401}}</ref> and the role of cognitive skills.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Eric A.

At the level of the individual, there is a large literature, generally related to the work of [[Jacob Mincer]],<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Jacob Mincer|title=The distribution of labor incomes: a survey with special reference to the human capital approach|jstor=2720384|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume= 8|issue=1|year=1970|pages=1–26}}</ref> on how earnings are related to the schooling and other human capital. This work has motivated a large number of studies, but is also controversial. The chief controversies revolve around how to interpret the impact of schooling.<ref>David Card, "Causal effect of education on earnings," in ''Handbook of labor economics'', Orley Ashenfelter and David Card (Eds).

Economists [[Samuel Bowles (economist)|Samuel Bowles]] and Herbert Gintis argued in 1976 that there was a fundamental conflict in American schooling between the [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] goal of democratic participation and the inequalities implied by the continued profitability of capitalist production.<ref>{{Cite book|author1=Samuel Bowles|author2=Herbert Gintis|title=Schooling In Capitalist America: Educational Reform and the Contradictions of Economic Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LcpLPKOL6XYC|accessdate=21 October 2011|date=18 October 2011|publisher=Haymarket Books|isbn=978-1-60846-131-8}}</ref>
