The '''aspect ratio''' of a [[geometry|geometric]] [[shape]] is the ratio of its sizes in different dimensions. For example, the aspect ratio of a [[rectangle]] is the [[ratio]] of its longer side to its shorter side - the ratio of width to height,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/aspect-ratio |title=What is aspect ratio? |first=Margaret |last=Rouse |date=September 2005 |accessdate=3 February 2013 |work=WhatIs? |publisher=TechTarget}}</ref> when the rectangle is oriented as a "landscape".

The aspect ratio is expressed as two numbers separated by a colon (x:y). The values x and y do not represent actual width and height but, rather, the "relation" between width and height. As an example, 8:5, 16:10 and 1.6:1 are the same aspect ratio.

In objects of more than two dimensions, such as [[Hyperrectangle]]s, the aspect ratio can still be defined as the ratio of the longest side to the shortest side.

==Applications and uses==
The term is most commonly used with reference to:
* Graphic / image
** [[Aspect ratio (image)|Image aspect ratio]]
** [[Display aspect ratio]]: the aspect ratio for computer displays.
** [[Paper size]]
** [[Standard photographic print sizes]]
** [[List of film formats|Motion picture film formats]]
** [[Standard ad size]]
** [[Pixel aspect ratio]]
** [[Photolithography]]: the aspect ratio of an etched, or deposited structure is the ratio of the height of its vertical side wall to its width.

==Aspect ratios of simple shapes==

===Rectangles===
{{Main|Aspect ratio (image)}}
For a rectangle, the aspect ratio denotes the ratio of the width to the height of the rectangle. A [[square]] has the smallest possible aspect ratio of 1:1.

Examples:
* 4:3 = 1.{{overline|3}}: Some (not all) 20th century computer monitors ([[VGA]], [[XGA]], etc.), [[standard-definition television]]
* √2:1 = 1.414…: International paper sizes ([[ISO 216]])
* 3:2 = 1.5: [[135 film|35mm still camera film]], [[iPhone#Model comparison|iPhone]] (until [[iPhone 5]]) displays
* [[16:10]] = 1.6 (not shown above): Commonly used [[widescreen]] [[computer display]]s ([[WXGA (graphics)|WXGA]])
* Φ:1 = 1.618…: [[Golden ratio]], close to 16:10
* 5:3 = 1.{{overline|6}}: [[Super 16 mm]],  a standard [[film gauge]] in many European countries
* 16:9 = 1.{{overline|7}}: [[Widescreen]] TV

===Ellipses===
For an ellipse, the aspect ratio denotes the ratio of the [[major axis]] to the [[minor axis]]. An ellipse with an aspect ratio of 1:1 is a circle.

==Aspect ratios of general shapes==

In [[geometry]], there are several alternative definitions to aspect ratios of general [[compact set]]s in a d-dimensional space:<ref name=SmithWormald1998>{{Cite book

* The Diameter-Width Aspect Ratio (DWAR) of a compact set is the ratio of its diameter to its width. A circle has the minimal DWAR which is 1. A square has a DWAR of sqrt(2). 
* The Cube-Volume Aspect Ratio (CVAR) of a compact set is the d-th root of the ratio of the d-volume of the smallest enclosing axes-parallel d-cube, to the set's own d-volume. A square has the minimal CVAR which is 1. A circle has a CVAR of sqrt(2). An axis-parallel rectangle of width W and height H, where W>H, has a CVAR of sqrt(W^2/WH) = sqrt(W/H).

If the dimension d is fixed, then all reasonable definitions of aspect ratio are equivalent to within constant factors.

==Notations==
Aspect ratios are mathematically expressed as ''x'':''y'' (pronounced "x-to-y") and ''x''×''y'' (pronounced "x-by-y"), with the latter particularly used for [[pixel dimensions]], such as 640×480.

Cinematographic aspect ratios are usually denoted as a (rounded) decimal multiple of width vs unit height, while photographic and videographic aspect ratios are usually defined and denoted by whole number ratios of width to height. In [[digital image]]s there is a subtle distinction between the ''Display'' Aspect Ratio (the image as displayed) and the [[Storage Aspect Ratio|''Storage'' Aspect Ratio]] (the ratio of pixel dimensions); see [[Aspect ratio (image)#Distinctions|Distinctions]].
