'''Christopher Haden-Guest, [[Baron Haden-Guest|5th Baron Haden-Guest]]''' (born February 5, 1948), better known as '''Christopher Guest''', is an English-American screenwriter, composer, musician, director, actor, and comedian who holds dual British and American citizenship. He is most widely known in [[Hollywood]] for having written, directed and starred in several [[improvisational theatre|improvisational]] "[[mockumentary]]" films featuring an [[ensemble cast]]. This series of films began with ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' (directed by [[Rob Reiner]]), and continued with ''[[Waiting for Guffman]]'', ''[[Best in Show (film)|Best In Show]]'', ''[[A Mighty Wind]]'', and ''[[For Your Consideration (film)|For Your Consideration]]''. Guest also had a featured role as the evil six-fingered [[The Princess Bride (film)#Cast|Count Rugen]] in the film ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]''.

He holds a hereditary [[British peerage]] as the 5th [[Baron Haden-Guest]], and has publicly expressed a desire to see the [[House of Lords]] reformed as a democratically elected chamber. Though he was initially active in the Lords, his career there was cut short by the [[House of Lords Act 1999]]. When using his title, he is normally [[Style (manner of address)|styled]] as Lord Haden-Guest. Guest is married to the actress and author [[Jamie Lee Curtis]].

==Early years==
Guest was born in New York City, the son of [[Peter Haden-Guest, 4th Baron Haden-Guest|Peter Haden-Guest]], a British [[United Nations]] diplomat who later became the 4th [[Baron Haden-Guest]], and his second wife, Jean Pauline Hindes, an American former vice president of casting at [[CBS]].<ref name="ny times"/> Guest's paternal grandfather, [[Leslie Haden-Guest, 1st Baron Haden-Guest|Leslie, Baron Haden-Guest]], was a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician who was a [[Conversion to Judaism|convert]] to Judaism. Guest's paternal grandmother, a descendant of the Dutch Jewish [[Goldsmid family]], was the daughter of [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|Colonel]] [[Albert Goldsmid]], a British officer who founded the [[Jewish Lads' and Girls' Brigade]] and the [[Maccabaeans]].<ref name=yar>{{cite book|last=Murray|first=William Henry|title=Adam and Cain: Symposium of Old Bible History, Sumerian Empire, Importance of Blood of Race, Juggling Juggernaut of the Leaders of the Jews, the Gothic Civilization of Adam and the Ten Commandments of His Church|publisher=Murray|year=1952}}</ref><ref name="guest1">{{cite journal|last=Rosen|first=Steven|title=Want to spoof Purim and the Oscars?

Guest spent parts of his childhood in his father's native United Kingdom. He attended [[The High School of Music & Art]] (New York City), studying classical music (clarinet) at the [[Stockbridge School]] in Interlaken, Massachusetts. He later took up the [[mandolin]], became interested in [[country music]], and played guitar with [[Arlo Guthrie]], a fellow student at Stockbridge School.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nowt so queer as folk|author=Richard Grant|date=January 10, 2004|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2004/jan/10/features.weekend|magazine=[[The Guardian Weekend]] }}</ref> Guest later began performing with [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] bands until he took up [[rock and roll]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Gross|first=Terry|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14081515|title=Christopher Guest Plays with Parody|work=[[Fresh Air]], [[WHYY-FM|WHYY]]|publisher=[[NPR]]|location=Philadelphia|date=September 14, 1989|accessdate=2010-08-06}}</ref>

Guest studied acting at [[New York University]]'s [[Tisch School of the Arts#Graduate Acting Program|Graduate Acting Program]] at the [[Tisch School of the Arts]], graduating in 1971.<ref>{{cite web|title=NYU Graduate Acting Alumni |url=http://gradacting.tisch.nyu.edu/object/ga_alumbios.html|year=2011|accessdate=2011-12-01}}</ref>

==Career==

===1970s===
Guest began his career in theatre during the early 1970s with one of his earliest professional performances being the role of Norman in [[Michael Weller]]'s ''[[Moonchildren]]'' for the play's American premiere at the [[Arena Stage]] in Washington D.C. in November 1971. Guest continued with the production when it moved to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1972. The following year he began making contributions to ''[[The National Lampoon Radio Hour]]'' for a variety of National Lampoon audio recordings. He both performed comic characters (Flash Bazbo—Space Explorer, Mr. Rogers, music critic Roger de Swans, and sleazy record company rep Ron Fields) and wrote, arranged and performed numerous musical parodies (of Bob Dylan, James Taylor and others). He was featured alongside [[Chevy Chase]] and [[John Belushi]] in the [[Off-Broadway]] revue ''[[National Lampoon's Lemmings]]''. Two of his earliest film roles were small parts as uniformed police officers in the 1972 film ''[[The Hot Rock (film)|The Hot Rock]]'' and 1974's ''[[Death Wish (film)|Death Wish]]''.

Guest played a small role in the 1977 ''All In the Family'' episode "[[List of All in the Family episodes#Season 8: 1977–1978|Mike and Gloria Meet]]", where in a [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]] sequence Mike and Gloria recall their first blind date, set up by Michael's college buddy Jim (Guest), who dated Gloria's girlfriend Debbie ([[Priscilla Lopez]]).

===1980s===
Guest's biggest role of the first two decades of his career is likely that of [[Nigel Tufnel]] in the 1984 [[mockumentary]] film ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]''. Guest made his first appearance as Tufnel on the 1978 sketch comedy program ''The TV Show''.

Along with [[Martin Short]], [[Billy Crystal]] and [[Harry Shearer]], Guest was hired as a one-year only cast member for the [[History of Saturday Night Live (1980–85)#1984–85 season|1984–85]] season on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. Recurring characters on SNL played by Guest include Frankie, of Willie and Frankie (coworkers who recount in detail physically painful situations in which they have found themselves, remarking laconically "I hate when that happens"); Herb Minkman, a shady novelty toymaker with a brother named Al (played by Crystal); Rajeev Vindaloo, an eccentric foreign man in the same vein as [[Andy Kaufman]]'s [[Latka Gravas|Latka]] character from ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]''; and Señor Cosa, a Spanish ventriloquist often seen on the recurring spoof of ''[[The Joe Franklin Show]]''. He also experimented behind the camera with pre-filmed sketches, notably directing a documentary-style short starring Shearer and Short as synchronized swimmers. In another short film from SNL, Guest and Crystal appear as retired [[Negro league baseball]] players, "The Rooster and the King".

He appeared as Count Rugen in ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]''. He had a cameo role as the first customer, a pedestrian, in the 1986 musical [[Little Shop of Horrors (1986 film)|remake]] of ''[[The Little Shop of Horrors]]'', that also featured his SNL co-star, Steve Martin. As a co-writer and director, Guest made the Hollywood satire ''[[The Big Picture (1989 film)|The Big Picture]]''.

Upon his father succeeding to the family [[peerage]] in 1987, he was known as ''[[The Honourable|The Hon.]] Christopher Haden-Guest''. This was his official [[Style (manner of address)|style]] and name until he inherited the barony in 1996.

===1990–present===
The experience of having made ''Spinal Tap'' would directly inform the second phase of his career. Starting in 1996, Guest began writing, directing and acting in his own series of substantially [[Improvisational comedy|improvised]] films. Many of them would come to be definitive examples of what came to be known as "mockumentaries".

His frequent writing partner is [[Eugene Levy]]. Together, Levy, Guest and a small band of other actors have formed a loose [[repertory]] group, which appear across several films. These include [[Catherine O'Hara]], [[Michael McKean]], [[Parker Posey]], [[Bob Balaban]], [[Jane Lynch]], [[John Michael Higgins]], [[Harry Shearer]], [[Jennifer Coolidge]], [[Ed Begley, Jr.]] and [[Fred Willard]]. Guest and Levy write backgrounds for each of the characters and notecards for each specific scene, outlining the plot, and then leave it up to the actors to improvise the dialogue, which is supposed to result in a much more natural conversation than scripted dialogue would. Notably, everyone who appears in these movies receives the same fee, and the same portion of profits.<ref name="crose03">{{cite web|url=http://www.charlierose.com/shows/2003/05/12/1/a-conversation-with-director-christopher-guest|last=Rose|first=Charlie|title=A conversation with director Christopher Guest|publisher=Charlie Rose LLC|date=May 12, 2003|accessdate=2010-08-06}}</ref>

Despite making a number of mockumentaries, Guest dislikes the term. He maintains that his intention is not to mock anyone, but to explore insular, perhaps obscure communities through his method of filmmaking.

He had a guest voice-over role in the animated comedy series ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' as SpongeBob's cousin, Stanley.

Guest appeared as Dr. Stone in ''[[A Few Good Men]]'' (1992), as Lord Cromer in ''[[Mrs Henderson Presents]]'' (2005) and in the 2009 comedy ''[[The Invention of Lying]]''.

He is also currently a member of the musical group [[The Beyman Bros]], which he formed with his childhood friend [[David Nichtern]] and Spinal Tap's current keyboardist [[C. J. Vanston]]. Their debut album ''Memories of Summer as a Child'' was released on January 20, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100007776|title=Beyman Bros: The Thinking Person's Americana|last=Moon|first=Tom|date=February 2, 2009|publisher=[[NPR]]|work=All Things Considered|accessdate=2010-08-06}}</ref>

In 2010, the [[United States Census Bureau]] paid $2.5 million to have a television commercial directed by Guest shown during television coverage of [[Super Bowl XLIV]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/02/03/taxpayers-fork-million-single-census-ad-super-bowl/|title=Taxpayers to Fork Out $2.5 Million for Single Census Ad During Super Bowl|date=February 3, 2010|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=2010-08-06}}</ref>

Guest holds an honorary doctorate from and is a member of the board of trustees for [[Berklee College of Music]] in Boston.<ref>{{cite news|last=Shanahan|first=Mark|title=Christopher Guest parties for Berklee|url=http://articles.boston.com/2011-10-18/ae/30293257_1_christopher-guest-honorary-doctorate-big-talents|accessdate=6 March 2012|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=18 October 2011}}</ref>

He was most recently the writer and producer of the [[HBO]] series, ''[[Family Tree (TV series)|Family Tree]],'' a lighthearted story in the mockumentary style he made famous in ''Spinal Tap'', in which the main character, Tom Chadwick, inherits a box of curios from his great aunt, spurring interest in his ancestry.

On August 11, 2015, [[Netflix]] announced that ''[[Mascots (film)|Mascots]]'', a mockumentary film about the competition for the World Mascot Association championships's Gold Fluffy Award, would debut in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McNary|first1=Dave|title=Netflix Acquires Christopher Guest’s ‘Mascots’ Mockumentary|url=http://variety.com/2015/digital/news/christopher-guest-netflix-movie-mascots-1201567417/|website=Variety|accessdate=5 September 2015}}</ref>

==Family==

===Peerage and heirs===
[[File:Coat of Arms - Baron Haden-Guest, of Saling in the County of Essex.png|thumb|Coat of arms - Baron Haden-Guest, of Saling in the County of Essex]]

Guest became the 5th [[Baron Haden-Guest]], of [[Great Saling]], in the [[Essex|County of Essex]], when his father died in 1996. He succeeded upon the ineligibility of his older half-brother, [[Anthony Haden-Guest]], who was [[illegitimacy|born prior to the marriage of his parents]]. According to an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'', Guest attended the [[House of Lords]] regularly until the [[House of Lords Act 1999]] barred most hereditary peers from their seats. In the article Guest remarked:
{{quote|There's no question that the old system was unfair. I mean, why should you be born to this? But now it's all just sheer cronyism. The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] can put in whoever he wants and bus them in to vote. The [[House of Lords|Upper House]] should be an elected body, it's that simple.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Guardian Weekend]]|title=Nowt so queer as folk|author=Richard Grant|date=January 10, 2004|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2004/jan/10/features.weekend}}</ref>}}

==Personal life==
Guest married actress [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] in 1984 at the home of their mutual friend, [[Rob Reiner]]. They have two [[adoption|adopted]] children: Anne (born 1986) and Thomas (born 1996). Because Guest's children are adopted, they cannot inherit the family barony under the terms of the [[letters patent]] that created it, though a 2004 [[Royal Warrant]] addressing the style of a peer's adopted children states that they can use [[Courtesy titles in the United Kingdom|courtesy titles]]. The current [[heir presumptive]] to the barony is Guest's younger brother, the actor [[Nicholas Guest|The Hon. Nicholas Haden-Guest]].

==Off-stage demeanor==
As reported by Louis B. Hobson, "On film, Guest is a hilariously droll comedian. In person he is serious and almost dour." He quotes Guest as saying "People want me to be funny all the time. They think I'm being funny no matter what I say or do and that's not the case. I rarely joke unless I'm in front of a camera. It's not what I am in real life. It's what I do for a living."<ref>{{cite news|last=Hobson|first=Louis B|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Artists/G/Guest_Christopher/2000/10/10/pf-758773.html|title=Guest Shots|publisher=Canoe Inc.|work=Canoe Jam!|date=October 10, 2000|accessdate=2007-08-29}}</ref>
