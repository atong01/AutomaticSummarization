In fact, the cars produced by Nissan already used the Datsun brand name, a successful brand in Japan since 1932, long before<space/><link><target>World War II</target></link>. Before the entry into the American market in 1958, Nissan did not produce cars under the Nissan brand name, but only trucks. Their in-house-designed cars were always branded as<space/><italics>Datsuns</italics>. Hence, for Nissan executives it would be only natural to use such a successful name when exporting models to the United States. Only in the 1960s did Datsun begin to brand some automobile models as<space/><italics>Nissans</italics>, and these were limited to their high-end models, for example the<space/><link><target>Nissan Cedric</target><part>Cedric</part></link><space/>luxury-type<space/><link><target>Sedan (automobile)</target><part>sedan</part></link>. The<space/><link><target>Japanese domestic market</target><part>Japanese market</part></link><space/>Z-car (sold as the Fairlady Z) also had Nissan badging. In America, the Nissan branch was named &quot;<italics>Nissan Motor Corporation in U.S.A.</italics>&quot;, and chartered on September 28, 1960, in California, but the small cars the firm exported to America were still named Datsun.</paragraph><paragraph>Corporate choice favored Datsun, so as to distance the parent factory Nissans association by<space/><link><target>United States</target><part>Americans</part></link><space/>with Japanese military manufacture. In fact Nissan's involvement in Japan's military industries was substantial. The company's car production at the Yokohama plant shifted towards military needs just a few years after the first passenger cars rolled off the assembly line, on April 11, 1935. By 1939 Nissan's operations had moved to<space/><link><target>Manchuria</target></link>, then under Japanese occupation, where its founder and President, Yoshisuke Ayukawa, established the Manchurian Motor Company to manufacture military trucks.</paragraph><paragraph>Ayukawa, a well-connected and aggressive risk taker, also made himself a principal partner of the Japanese Colonial Government of<space/><link><target>Manchukuo</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last">Halberstam<space/></arg><arg name="first">David<space/></arg><arg name="title">The Reckoning<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">HarperCollins<space/></arg><arg name="year">1994<space/></arg><arg name="isbn">9780380721474</arg></template></extension><space/>Ultimately, Nissan Heavy Industries emerged near the end of the war as an important player in Japans war machinery.
