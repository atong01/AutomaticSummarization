'''Caffeine''' is a [[central nervous system]] (CNS) [[stimulant]] of the [[methylxanthine]] class of [[psychoactive drug]]s.<ref name="pmid1356551">{{cite journal | author = Nehlig A, Daval JL, Debry G | title = Caffeine and the central nervous system: mechanisms of action, biochemical, metabolic and psychostimulant effects | journal = Brain Res.

It is a bitter, white crystalline [[purine]], a [[methylxanthine]] [[alkaloid]], and thus closely related chemically to the [[adenine]] and [[guanine]] contained in [[DNA|deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) and [[RNA|ribonucleic acid]] (RNA).  It is found in the seeds, nuts, or leaves of a number of plants native to South America and East Asia. The most well known source of caffeine is the seed (commonly incorrectly referred to as the "bean") of ''[[Coffea]]'' plants.  Beverages containing caffeine are ingested to relieve or prevent drowsiness and to increase one's energy level. Caffeine is extracted from the plant part containing it for making beverages by [[steeping]] it in water, a process called [[infusion]]. These beverages are very popular; in North America, 90% of adults consume caffeine daily.<ref name="demon drink">{{cite journal|author=Lovett R |title=Coffee: The demon drink? |journal=New Scientist |issue=2518 |date=24 September 2005 |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=mg18725181.700 |subscription=yes}}</ref>

Caffeine is classified by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] as "[[generally recognized as safe]]" (GRAS). Toxic doses, over 10 grams per day for an adult, are much higher than typical dose of under 500 milligrams per day. A cup of coffee contains 80–175&nbsp;mg of caffeine, depending on what "bean" (seed) is used and how it is prepared (e.g. [[Drip brew|drip]], [[Coffee percolator|percolation]], or [[espresso]]). Thus it requires roughly 50–100 ordinary cups of coffee to reach a lethal dose.  However pure powdered caffeine, which is available as a dietary supplement, can be lethal in tablespoon-sized amounts. There are several known mechanisms of action to explain the effects of caffeine. The most prominent is to reversibly block the action of [[adenosine]] on its receptor, which blocks the onset of drowsiness induced by adenosine. Caffeine also stimulates certain portions of the autonomic nervous system.

Caffeine can have both positive and negative health effects. It can be used to treat [[bronchopulmonary dysplasia]] of prematurity, and to prevent [[apnea of prematurity]]: [[caffeine citrate]] was placed on the [[WHO Model List of Essential Medicines]] in 2007.<ref name="WHOMedList">{{cite book |title= WHO Model List of Essential Medicines |url= http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/93142/1/EML_18_eng.pdf?ua=1 |edition= 18th |publisher= [[World Health Organization]] |accessdate= 23 December 2014 |page= 34 [p. 38 of pdf] |date= October 2013 |origyear= April 2013}}</ref> It may confer a modest protective effect against some diseases,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cano-Marquina A, Tarín JJ, Cano A | title = The impact of coffee on health | journal = Maturitas | volume = 75 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–21 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23465359 | doi = 10.1016/j.maturitas.2013.02.002 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378-5122(13)00047-9 | accessdate = 15 January 2014 }}</ref> including [[Parkinson's disease]]<ref>{{cite journal | author = Qi H, Li S | title = Dose-response meta-analysis on coffee, tea and caffeine consumption with risk of Parkinson's disease | journal = Geriatr Gerontol Int | date = 23 July 2003 | pmid = 23879665 | doi = 10.1111/ggi.12123 | volume=14 | pages=430–439}}</ref> and certain types of cancer.

Caffeine confers a survival advantage on the plant containing it in three ways. First, if it is ingested by an insect feeding on and potentially damaging or killing the plant, caffeine functions as a natural pesticide which can paralyze and kill the insect. Second, droppings from the plant infuse the surrounding soil with caffeine, which can inhibit the growth of and kill competing seedlings (and potentially its own progeny and itself). Third, caffeine can enhance the reward memory of pollinators such as honey bees, thus increasing the numbers of its progeny.

===Reinforcement disorders===

====Addiction====
Whether or not caffeine can result in an addictive disorder depends on how addiction is defined. Some diagnostic models, such as the {{nowrap|[[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems#ICDM-9|ICDM-9]]}} and [[ICD-10]], include a classification of caffeine addiction under a broader diagnostic model.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Budney|first1=AJ|last2=Emond|first2=JA|title=Caffeine addiction?

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
{{Synapse map}}
[[File:Caffeine and adenosine.svg|thumb|250px|Caffeine's primary mechanism of action is as an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of [[adenosine]] receptors in the brain|alt=Two skeletal formulas: left&nbsp;– caffeine, right&nbsp;– adenosine.]]
In the absence of caffeine and when a person is awake and alert, little [[adenosine]] is present in (CNS) neurons. With a continued wakeful state, over time it accumulates in the neuronal [[synapse]], in turn binding to and activating [[adenosine receptor]]s found on certain CNS neurons; when activated, these receptors produce a cellular response that ultimately increases [[drowsiness]]. When caffeine is consumed, it [[receptor antagonist|antagonizes]] adenosine receptors; in other words, caffeine prevents adenosine from activating the receptor by blocking the location on the receptor where adenosine binds to it. As a result, caffeine temporarily prevents or relieves drowsiness, and thus maintains or restores alertness.<ref name="Drugbank-Caffeine" />

====Receptor and ion channel targets====

Caffeine is a receptor antagonist at all [[adenosine receptor]] subtypes ([[adenosine receptor A1|A1]], [[adenosine receptor A2a|A2A]], [[adenosine receptor A2b|A2B]], and [[adenosine receptor A3|A3]] receptors).<ref name="Drugbank-Caffeine" />  Antagonism at these receptors stimulates the [[medulla oblongata|medullary]] vagal, vasomotor, and [[respiratory center]]s, which increases respiratory rate, reduces heartrate, and constricts blood vessels.<ref name="Drugbank-Caffeine" /> Adenosine receptor antagonism also promotes neurotransmitter release (e.g., [[monoamines]] and [[acetylcholine]]), which endows caffeine with its stimulant effects;<ref name="Drugbank-Caffeine" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldofcaffeine.com/caffeine-and-neurotransmitters/ |title=World of Caffeine |publisher=World of Caffeine |date=15 June 2013 |accessdate=19 December 2013}}</ref> [[adenosine]] acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter that suppresses activity in the central nervous system. [[Heart palpitation]]s are caused by blockade of the adenosine A1 receptor.<ref name="Drugbank-Caffeine" />

Because caffeine is both water- and lipid-soluble, it readily crosses the [[blood–brain barrier]] that separates the bloodstream from the interior of the brain. Once in the brain, the principal mode of action is as a nonselective [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of [[adenosine receptor]]s (in other words, an agent that reduces the effects of adenosine). The caffeine molecule is structurally similar to adenosine, and is capable of binding to adenosine receptors on the surface of cells without activating them, thereby acting as a [[competitive inhibitor]].<ref name="pmid15095008">{{cite journal|author=Fisone G, Borgkvist A, Usiello A |title=Caffeine as a psychomotor stimulant: mechanism of action |journal=Cell. Mol. Life Sci. |volume=61 |issue=7–8 |pages=857–72 |year=2004 |pmid=15095008 |doi=10.1007/s00018-003-3269-3}}</ref>

In addition to its activity at adenosine receptors, caffeine is an [[Inositol trisphosphate receptor|inositol triphosphate receptor 1]] antagonist and a voltage-independent activator of the [[ryanodine receptor]]s ([[RYR1]], [[RYR2]], and [[RYR3]]).<ref name="IUPHAR caffeine">{{cite web|title=Caffeine|url=http://www.iuphar-db.org/DATABASE/LigandDisplayForward?tab=biology&ligandId=407|website=IUPHAR|publisher=International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology|accessdate=2 November 2014}}</ref>  It is also a competitive antagonist of the [[glycine receptor|ionotropic glycine receptor]].<ref name="pmid19564396">{{cite journal | author = Duan L, Yang J, Slaughter MM | title = Caffeine inhibition of ionotropic glycine receptors | journal = J.

====Off-target effects====

Caffeine antagonizes [[adenosine A2A receptor]]s in the [[ventrolateral preoptic area]] (VLPO), thereby reducing inhibitory [[GABA]] [[neurotransmission]] to the [[tuberomammillary nucleus]], a [[histamine]]rgic projection nucleus that activation-dependently promotes arousal.<ref name="Ferre 2008">{{vcite2 journal | authors = Ferré S | title = An update on the mechanisms of the psychostimulant effects of caffeine | journal = J.

(2007) as ‘nucleus accumbens shell,’ where both studies show that caffeine does not modify the extracellular levels of dopamine. Therefore, the results of both experimental groups are basically the same and point to differential effects of caffeine in different striatal subcompartments. In fact, analyzing the effects of the intrastriatal perfusion of an A1 receptor antagonist in several other striatal compartments showed striking differences compared with the shell of the nucleus accumbens. Thus, A1 receptor blockade signiﬁcantly increased the extracellular concentration of dopamine, but not glutamate, in the core of the nucleus accumbens and in the caudate–putamen and the effect was more pronounced in the most medial compartments (Boryczet al. 2007). In summary, a subregional difference in the A1 receptor-mediated control of glutamate and dopamine release exists in the striatum&nbsp;... A2A receptors play a crucial role in the sleep-promoting effects of adenosine and the arousal-enhancing effects of caffeine (Huang et al. 2007; Ferre´ et al. 2007a).

An additional factor that might play a signiﬁcant role in caffeine tolerance is the signiﬁcant increase in plasma and extracellular concentrations of adenosine with chronic caffeine exposure&nbsp;...

===Detection in body fluids===
Caffeine can be quantified in blood, plasma, or serum to monitor therapy in neonates, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or facilitate a medicolegal death investigation. Plasma caffeine levels are usually in the range of 2–10&nbsp;mg/L in coffee drinkers, 12–36&nbsp;mg/L in neonates receiving treatment for apnea, and 40–400&nbsp;mg/L in victims of acute overdosage. Urinary caffeine concentration is frequently measured in competitive sports programs, for which a level in excess of 15&nbsp;mg/L is usually considered to represent abuse.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baselt R |title=Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man |edition=9th |publisher=Biomedical Publications |location=Seal Beach, CA |year=2011 |pages=236–9 |isbn=0-931890-08-X}}</ref>

===Analogs===
Some analog substances have been created which mimic caffeine's properties with either function or structure or both, one of the latter is the drug [[DMPX]].<ref name=DMPX>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3193854 3,7-Dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine: a potent and selective in vivo antagonist of adenosine analogs.] Life Sci. 1988;43(21):1671–84. PMID 3193854</ref>

==Natural occurrence==
Around sixty plant species are known to contain caffeine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/780334|title=Which Plants Contain Caffeine?
|work=medscape.com}}</ref> Common sources are the "bean" (seed) of the [[coffea arabica|coffee plant]] (the quantity varies, but 1.3% is a typical value<ref>For more information, see {{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions about Coffee and Caffeine|url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/caffeine-faq/|author=Alejandro Lopez-Ortiz}}</ref>); in the leaves of the [[camellia sinensis|tea bush]]; and in [[kola nut]]s. Other sources include [[ilex vomitoria|yaupon holly]] leaves, South American holly [[yerba mate]] leaves, seeds from Amazonian maple [[guarana]] berries, and Amazonian holly [[ilex guayusa|guayusa]] leaves. Temperate climates around the world have produced unrelated caffeine containing plants.

Caffeine in plants acts as a natural [[pesticide]]: it can paralyze and kill predator insects feeding on the plant:<ref name="insecticide">{{cite journal | author = Nathanson JA | title = Caffeine and related methylxanthines: possible naturally occurring pesticides | journal = Science | volume = 226 | issue = 4671 | pages = 184–7 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6207592 | doi = 10.1126/science.6207592 }}</ref>  high caffeine levels are found in coffee seedlings when they are developing foliage and lack mechanical protection.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Frischknecht PM, Ulmer-Dufek J, Baumann TW |title=Purine alkaloid formation in buds and developing leaflets of Coffea arabica: Expression of an optimal defence strategy? |journal=Phytochemistry |volume=25 |pages=613–6 |year=1986 |doi=10.1016/0031-9422(86)88009-8 |issue=3}}</ref> In addition, high caffeine levels are found in the surrounding soil of coffee seedlings, which inhibits seed germination of nearby coffee seedlings, thus giving seedlings with the highest caffeine levels fewer competitors for existing resources for survival.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Baumann TW |title=Metabolism and excretion of caffeine during germination of Coffea arabica L |journal=Plant and Cell Physiology |volume=25 |issue=8 |pages=1431–6 |year=1984 |url=http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/8/1431.abstract}}</ref>

The differing perceptions in the effects of ingesting beverages made from various plants containing caffeine could be explained by the fact that these beverages also contain  varying mixtures of other [[methylxanthine]] [[alkaloid]]s, including the [[cardiac]] stimulants [[theophylline]] and [[theobromine]], and [[polyphenol]]s that can form insoluble complexes with caffeine.<ref name="Ref-1">{{cite book|author=Balentine D.

Products containing caffeine are coffee, tea, soft drinks ("colas"), [[energy drinks]], other beverages, [[chocolate]],<ref name="Matissek R 1997 175–84">{{cite journal|author=Matissek R |title=Evaluation of xanthine derivatives in chocolate: nutritional and chemical aspects |id={{INIST|2861730}} |journal=European Food Research and Technology |volume=205 |issue=3 |pages=175–84 |year=1997 |doi=10.1007/s002170050148}}</ref> caffeine tablets,  other oral products, and inhalation.

===Beverages===

====Coffee====
The world's primary source of caffeine is the coffee "bean" (which is the seed of the [[coffea|coffee plant]]), from which coffee is brewed. Caffeine content in coffee varies widely depending on the type of [[coffee bean]] and the method of preparation used;<ref name="ICO">{{cite web|title=Caffeine |publisher=International Coffee Organization |url=http://www.ico.org/caffeine.asp |accessdate=1 August 2009}}</ref> even beans within a given bush can show variations in concentration. In general, one serving of coffee ranges from 80 to 100 milligrams, for a single shot (30 milliliters) of arabica-variety [[espresso]], to approximately 100–125 milligrams for a cup (120 milliliters) of [[drip coffee]].<ref name="caffaq_roast">{{cite web|title=Coffee and Caffeine FAQ: Does dark roast coffee have less caffeine than light roast? |url=http://coffeefaq.com/site/node/15 |accessdate=2 August 2009}}</ref><ref name="jeremiahspick">{{cite web|title=All About Coffee: Caffeine Level |publisher=Jeremiah's Pick Coffee Co |url=http://www.jeremiahspick.com/caffeine-e-13.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318102343/http://www.jeremiahspick.com/caffeine-e-13.html |archivedate=18 March 2008 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> ''[[coffea arabica|Arabica]]'' coffee typically contains half the caffeine of the ''[[coffea canephora|robusta]]'' variety.<ref name="ICO" />
In general, dark-roast coffee has very slightly less caffeine than lighter roasts because the roasting process reduces  caffeine content of the bean by a small amount.<ref name="caffaq_roast" /><ref name="jeremiahspick" />

====Tea====
Tea contains more caffeine than coffee by dry weight. A typical serving, however, contains much less, since tea is normally brewed more weakly than coffee. Also contributing to caffeine content are growing conditions, processing techniques, and other variables. Thus, certain types of tea may contain somewhat more caffeine than other teas.<ref name="FRI">{{cite journal|author=Hicks MB, Hsieh Y-H P, Bell LN |title=Tea preparation and its influence on methylxanthine concentration |journal=Food Research International |year=1996 |volume=29 |pages=325–330 |doi=10.1016/0963-9969(96)00038-5 |issue=3–4}}</ref>

Tea contains small amounts of [[theobromine]] and slightly higher levels of [[theophylline]] than coffee. Preparation and many other factors have a significant impact on tea, and color is a very poor indicator of caffeine content. Teas like the pale Japanese [[green tea]], ''[[gyokuro]]'', for example, contain far more caffeine than much darker teas like ''[[lapsang souchong]]'', which has very little.<ref name="FRI" />

====Soft drinks and energy drinks====
Caffeine is also a common ingredient of [[soft drink]]s, such as [[cola]], originally prepared from [[kola nut]]s. Soft drinks typically contain 10 to 69 milligrams of caffeine per  12 ounce serving.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} By contrast, [[energy drink]]s, such as [[Red Bull]], can start at 80 milligrams of caffeine per serving. The caffeine in these drinks either originates from the ingredients used or is an additive derived from the product of [[decaffeination]] or from chemical synthesis. Guarana, a prime ingredient of energy drinks, contains large amounts of caffeine with small amounts of theobromine and theophylline in a naturally occurring [[slow-release]] [[excipient]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Bempong DK, Houghton PJ, Steadman K |year=1993 |title=The xanthine content of guarana and its preparations |journal=Int J Pharmacog |issn=0925-1618 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=175–181 |doi=10.3109/13880209309082937}}</ref>

====Other beverages====
* [[Mate (beverage)|Mate]] is a drink popular in many parts of South America. Its preparation consists of filling a gourd with the leaves of the South American holly [[yerba mate]], pouring hot but not boiling water over the leaves, and drinking with a straw, the bombilla, which acts as a filter so as to draw only the liquid and not the yerba leaves.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}  
* [[Guaraná]] seeds ("beans") are used in making the commercially sold beverage [[Guaraná Antarctica]], which originated in Brazil and is currently the fifteenth most popular soft drink in the world.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
* The leaves of [[Ilex guayusa]], the Equadorian holly tree, are placed in boiling water to make a guayusa tea, which is both brewed locally and sold commercially throughout the world.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Chocolate===
[[Chocolate]] derived from cocoa beans contains a small amount of caffeine. The weak stimulant effect of chocolate may be due to a combination of theobromine and theophylline, as well as caffeine.<ref name="pmid15549276">{{cite journal | author = Smit HJ, Gaffan EA, Rogers PJ | title = Methylxanthines are the psycho-pharmacologically active constituents of chocolate | journal = Psychopharmacology (Berl.) | volume = 176 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 412–9 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15549276 | doi = 10.1007/s00213-004-1898-3 }}</ref> A typical 28-gram serving of a milk [[chocolate bar]] has about as much caffeine as a cup of decaffeinated coffee. By weight, [[dark chocolate]] has one to two times the amount caffeine as coffee: 80–160&nbsp;mg per 100&nbsp;g.<ref name=Erowid/>

===Tablets===
[[File:No-Doz.jpg|thumb|right|No-Doz 100 mg caffeine tablets]]
Tablets offer the advantages over coffee and tea of convenience, known dosage, and avoiding concomitant fluid intake. Manufacturers of caffeine tablets claim that using caffeine of pharmaceutical quality improves mental alertness.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}  These tablets are commonly used by students studying for their exams and by people who work or drive for long hours.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=YdpL2YCGLVYC&pg=PA195 |page=195 |title=The World of caffeine: The Science and Culture of the World's Most Popular Drug |author=Bennett Alan Weinberg, Bonnie K.

===Inhalants===
Taking caffeine by inhalation was under scrutiny by some U.S. lawmakers in 2011.<ref>http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/controversy-over-inhaled-caffeine-grows-as-as-sen-schumer-calls-for-fda-probe/2011/12/22/gIQAjQaVDP_story.html{{dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref>

===Combinations with other drugs===
* Some beverages combine [[ethanol|alcohol]] with caffeine to create a [[caffeinated alcoholic drink]].  The stimulant effects of caffeine may mask the [[depressant]] effects of alcohol, potentially reducing the user's awareness of their level of [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxication]].  Such beverages have been the subject of [[Ban on caffeinated alcoholic beverages|bans]] due to safety concerns.  In particular, [[United States Food and Drug Administration]] has classified caffeine added to malt liquor beverages as an "unsafe food additive".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/FoodAdditivesIngredients/ucm190366.htm|title=Food Additives & Ingredients > Caffeinated Alcoholic Beverages|date=17 November 2010|website=fda.gov|publisher=Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=24 January 2014}}</ref>
* [[Ya ba]] contains a combination of [[methamphetamine]] and caffeine.

==Decaffeination==

Extraction of caffeine from coffee, to produce caffeine and decaffeinated coffee, can be performed using a number of solvents. [[Benzene]], [[chloroform]], [[trichloroethylene]], and [[dichloromethane]] have all been used over the years but for reasons of safety, environmental impact, cost, and flavor, they have been superseded by the following main methods:
* '''Water extraction:''' Coffee beans are soaked in water. The water, which contains many other compounds in addition to caffeine and contributes to the flavor of coffee, is then passed through [[Activated carbon|activated charcoal]], which removes the caffeine. The water can then be put back with the beans and evaporated dry, leaving decaffeinated coffee with its original flavor. Coffee manufacturers recover the caffeine and resell it for use in soft drinks and over-the-counter caffeine tablets.<ref name="Decaffeination">{{cite web|author=Senese F |title=How is coffee decaffeinated? |publisher=General Chemistry Online |date=20 September 2005 |url=http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/consumer/faq/decaffeinating-coffee.shtml |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref>
* '''Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction:''' [[Supercritical carbon dioxide]] is an excellent nonpolar solvent for caffeine, and is safer than the organic solvents that are otherwise used. The extraction process is simple: {{CO2}} is forced through the green coffee beans at temperatures above 31.1&nbsp;°C and pressures above 73 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]]. Under these conditions, {{CO2}} is in a "[[Supercritical fluid|supercritical]]" [[Phase (matter)|state]]: It has gaslike properties that allow it to penetrate deep into the beans but also liquid-like properties that dissolve 97–99% of the caffeine. The caffeine-laden {{CO2}} is then sprayed with high pressure water to remove the caffeine. The caffeine can then be isolated by [[Activated carbon|charcoal]] [[adsorption]] (as above) or by [[distillation]], [[Recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallization]], or [[reverse osmosis]].<ref name="Decaffeination" />
* '''Extraction by organic solvents:''' Certain organic solvents such as [[ethyl acetate]] present much less health and environmental hazard than chlorinated and aromatic organic solvents used formerly. Another method is to use triglyceride oils obtained from spent coffee grounds.<ref name=Decaffeination/>

"Decaffeinated" coffees do in fact contain caffeine in many cases&nbsp;— some commercially available decaffeinated coffee products contain considerable levels. One study found that decaffeinated coffee contained 10&nbsp;mg of caffeine per cup, compared to approximately 85&nbsp;mg of caffeine per cup for regular coffee.<ref name="pmid17132260">{{cite journal | author = McCusker RR, Fuehrlein B, Goldberger BA, Gold MS, Cone EJ | title = Caffeine content of decaffeinated coffee | journal = J Anal Toxicol | volume = 30 | issue = 8 | pages = 611–3 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 17132260 | doi = 10.1093/jat/30.8.611 | laysummary = http://news.ufl.edu/2006/10/10/decaf/ | laysource = University of Florida News }}</ref>

[[Kola nut]] use appears to have ancient origins. It is chewed in many [[West Africa]]n cultures, individually or in a social setting, to restore vitality and ease hunger pangs.

The earliest evidence of [[cocoa bean]] use comes from residue found in an [[Maya civilization|ancient Mayan]] pot dated to 600 BCE. Also, [[chocolate]] was consumed in a bitter and spicy drink called ''xocolatl'', often seasoned with [[vanilla]], [[chile pepper]], and [[achiote]]. ''Xocolatl'' was believed to fight fatigue, a belief probably attributable to the theobromine and caffeine content. Chocolate was an important luxury good throughout [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]], and cocoa beans were often used as currency.{{citation needed |date=October 2011}}

''Xocolatl'' was introduced to [[Europe]] by the [[Spanish people|Spaniards]], and became a popular beverage by 1700. The Spaniards also introduced the [[Theobroma cacao|cacao tree]] into the [[West Indies]] and the [[Philippines]]. It was used in [[alchemy|alchemical]] processes, where it was known as "black bean".{{citation needed |date=October 2011}}

===Chemical identification, isolation, and synthesis===

In 1819, the German chemist [[Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge]] isolated relatively pure caffeine for the first time; he called it ''"Kaffebase"'' (i.e. a [[base (chemistry)|base]] that exists in coffee).<ref>{{cite book|last=Runge |first=Friedlieb Ferdinand |title=Neueste phytochemische Entdeckungen zur Begründung einer wissenschaftlichen Phytochemie |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KLg5AAAAcAAJ&pg=P146 |year=1820 |publisher=G. Reimer |location=Berlin |pages=144–159 |trans_title=Latest phytochemical discoveries for the founding of a scientific phytochemistry |accessdate=8 January 2014}}</ref> According to Runge, he did this at the behest of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].<ref>In 1819, Runge was invited to show Goethe how belladonna caused dilation of the pupil, which Runge did, using a cat as an experimental subject.  Goethe was so impressed with the demonstration that:  ''"Nachdem Goethe mir seine größte Zufriedenheit sowol über die Erzählung des durch scheinbaren schwarzen Staar Geretteten, wie auch über das andere ausgesprochen, übergab er mir noch eine Schachtel mit Kaffeebohnen, die ein Grieche ihm als etwas Vorzügliches gesandt. "Auch diese können Sie zu Ihren Untersuchungen brauchen," sagte Goethe.  Er hatte recht; denn bald darauf entdeckte ich darin das, wegen seines großen Stickstoffgehaltes so berühmt gewordene Coffein."''  (After Goethe had expressed to me his greatest satisfaction regarding the account of the man [whom I'd] rescued [from serving in Napoleon's army] by apparent "black star" [i.e., amaurosis, blindness] as well as the other, he handed me a carton of coffee beans, which a Greek had sent him as a delicacy.  "You can also use these in your investigations," said Goethe.  He was right; for soon thereafter I discovered therein caffeine, which became so famous on account of its high nitrogen content.)<br>
This account appeared in Runge's book ''Hauswirtschaftlichen Briefen'' (Domestic Letters [i.e., personal correspondence]) of 1866.  It was reprinted in:  Johann Wolfgang von Goethe with F.W. von Biedermann, ed., ''Goethes Gespräche'', vol. 10:  ''Nachträge, 1755–1832'' (Leipzig, (Germany):  F.W. v.

Furthermore, Berzelius stated that the French chemists had made their discoveries independently of any knowledge of Runge's or each other's work.<ref>{{cite journal|year=1825 |title=Jahres-Bericht über die Fortschritte der physischen Wissenschaften von Jacob Berzelius |volume=4 |page=180 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XJI8AAAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA180 |language=German |trans_title=Annual report on the progress of the physical sciences by Jacob Berzelius |last=Berzelius |first=Jöns Jakob}}  From page 180:  ''"Caféin ist eine Materie im Kaffee, die zu gleicher Zeit, 1821, von Robiquet und Pelletier und Caventou entdekt wurde, von denen aber keine etwas darüber im Drucke bekannt machte."''  (Caffeine is a material in coffee, which was discovered at the same time, 1821, by Robiquet and [by] Pelletier and Caventou, by whom however nothing was made known about it in the press.)</ref>  However, Berzelius later acknowledged Runge's priority in the extraction of caffeine, stating:<ref>{{cite book|title=Jahres-Bericht über die Fortschritte der physischen Wissenschaften von Jacob Berzelius |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iGs1AAAAcAAJ&pg=P270 |volume=7 |year=1828 |trans_title=Annual Report on the Progress of the Physical Sciences by Jacob Berzelius |language=German |page=270 |author=Berzelius JJ}} From page 270:  ''"Es darf indessen hierbei nicht unerwähnt bleiben, dass Runge (in seinen phytochemischen Entdeckungen 1820, p. 146-7.) dieselbe Methode angegeben, und das Caffein unter dem Namen ''Caffeebase'' ein Jahr eher beschrieben hat, als Robiquet, dem die Entdeckung dieser Substanz gewöhnlich zugeschrieben wird, in einer Zusammenkunft der Societé de Pharmacie in Paris die erste mündliche Mittheilung darüber gab."'' (However, at this point, it should not remain unmentioned that Runge (in his ''Phytochemical Discoveries'', 1820, pages 146–147) specified the same method and described caffeine under the name ''Caffeebase'' a year earlier than Robiquet, to whom the discovery of this substance is usually attributed, having made the first oral announcement about it at a meeting of the Pharmacy Society in Paris.)</ref> "However, at this point, it should not remain unmentioned that Runge (in his ''Phytochemical Discoveries'', 1820, pages 146–147) specified the same method and described caffeine under the name ''Caffeebase'' a year earlier than Robiquet, to whom the discovery of this substance is usually attributed, having made the first oral announcement about it at a meeting of the Pharmacy Society in Paris."

Pelletier's article on caffeine was the first to use the term in print (in the French form ''Caféine'' from the French word for coffee: ''café'').<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Pelletier |first=Pierre Joseph |authorlink=Pierre Joseph Pelletier |encyclopedia=Dictionnaire de Médecine |title=Cafeine |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rFw_AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA35 |accessdate=3 March 2011 |language=French |year=1822 |publisher=Béchet Jeune |volume=4 |location=Paris |pages=35–36}}</ref> It corroborates Berzelius's account:

{{quote|Caffeine, noun (feminine). Crystallizable substance discovered in coffee in 1821 by Mr. Robiquet. During the same period&nbsp;– while they were searching for quinine in coffee because coffee is considered by several doctors to be a medicine that reduces fevers and because coffee belongs to the same family as the cinchona [quinine] tree&nbsp;– on their part, Messrs. Pelletier and Caventou obtained caffeine; but because their research had a different goal and because their research had not been finished, they left priority on this subject to Mr. Robiquet.

In 1895, German chemist [[Hermann Emil Fischer]] (1852–1919) first synthesized caffeine from its chemical components (i.e. a "[[total synthesis]]"), and two years later, he also derived the structural formula of the compound.<ref>Fischer began his studies of caffeine in 1881; however, understanding of the molecule's structure long eluded him.  In 1895 he synthesized caffeine, but only in 1897 did he finally fully determine its molecular structure.

==Society and culture==

===Consumption===
Global consumption of caffeine has been estimated at 120,000&nbsp;tonnes per year, making it the world's most popular psychoactive substance. This amounts to one serving of a caffeinated beverage for every person every day.<ref name="abc.net">{{cite news|title=What's your poison: caffeine |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |year=1997 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/quantum/poison/caffeine/caffeine.htm |accessdate=15 January 2014 |author=Geoffrey Burchfield |editor=Meredith Hopes}}</ref>

===Governments===
Because it was recognized that coffee contained some compound that acted as a stimulant, first coffee and later also caffeine has sometimes been subject to regulation. For example, in the 16th century Islamists in Mecca and in the Ottoman Empire made coffee illegal for some classes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brown |first=Daniel W |title=A new introduction to Islam |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Chichester, West Sussex |year=2004 |pages=149–51 |isbn=1-4051-5807-7}}</ref><ref name="agostonmasters2009">{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire |last1=Ágoston |first1=Gábor |last2=Masters |first2=Bruce |year=2009 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=QjzYdCxumFcC&pg=PA138 |isbn=978-1-4381-1025-7 |page=138}}</ref><ref name="hopkins2006">{{cite web|url=http://accidentalhedonist.com/food-stories-the-sultans-coffee-prohibition/ |title=Food Stories: The Sultan's Coffee Prohibition |last=Hopkins |first=Kate |date=24 March 2006 |work=Accidental Hedonist |accessdate=3 January 2010}}<!-- doubtful WP:RS, but comments suggest it can be sourced to both "Devil's Cup" and "Devil's Picnic" --></ref> [[Charles II of England]] tried to ban it in 1676,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-giessen.de/gloning/tx/suppress.htm |title=By the King.

===Religions===
Some [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Church of God (Restoration)]] adherents, and [[Christian Scientists]] do not consume caffeine.{{citation needed |date=December 2011}} Some from these religions believe that one is not supposed to consume a non-medical, psychoactive substance, or believe that one is not supposed to consume a substance that is addictive. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] has said the following with regard to caffeinated beverages: "With reference to cola drinks, the Church has never officially taken a position on this matter, but the leaders of the Church have advised, and we do now specifically advise, against the use of any drink containing harmful habit-forming drugs under circumstances that would result in acquiring the habit. Any beverage that contains ingredients harmful to the body should be avoided."<ref>{{cite book|title=Doctrine and Covenants Student Manual: Religion 324 and 325 |publisher=LDS Church |location=Salt Lake City |year=2001 |page=209 |url=http://www.ldsces.org/inst_manuals/dc-in/dc-in-081.htm |accessdate=15 January 2014}}</ref>

[[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnavas]] generally also abstain from caffeine, because they believe it clouds the mind and over-stimulates the senses. To be initiated under a guru, one must have had no caffeine, alcohol, nicotine or other drugs, for at least a year.{{citation needed |date=September 2011}}
