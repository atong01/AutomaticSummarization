A '''condom''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|n|d|əm}} or {{IPAc-en|uk|ˈ|k|ɒ|n|d|ɒ|m}}) is a sheath-shaped [[Barrier contraception|barrier device]] that may be used during [[sexual intercourse]] to reduce the probability of [[pregnancy]] and spreading [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs/STDs) such as [[HIV/AIDS]]. It is rolled onto an [[erect penis]] before intercourse and physically blocks ejaculated semen from entering the body of a sexual partner. Condoms are also used during [[fellatio]] and for [[Semen collection|collection of semen]] for use in infertility treatment. In the modern age, condoms are most often made from [[latex]], but some are made from other materials such as [[polyurethane]], [[polyisoprene]], or lamb intestine. A [[female condom]] is also available, often made of [[Nitrile rubber|nitrile]].<ref>http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/condom</ref>

As a method of [[birth control]], male condoms have the advantages of being inexpensive, easy to use, having few side effects, and offering protection against sexually transmitted diseases.  With proper knowledge and application technique—and use at every act of intercourse—women whose partners use male condoms experience a 2% per-year pregnancy rate with perfect use and an 18% per-year pregnancy rate with typical use.<ref name="Summary table of contraceptive efficacy">{{cite news| last=Trussell| first=J| title=Contraceptive efficacy | publisher=Ardent Media |year=2007 | accessdate=2011-03-13 | url=http://www.contraceptivetechnology.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/CTFailureTable.pdf}}</ref> Condoms have been used for at least 400 years. Since the 19th century, they have been one of the most popular methods of contraception in the world. While widely accepted in modern times, condoms have generated some controversy, primarily over what role they should play in [[sex education]] classes.

The effectiveness of condoms, as of most forms of [[birth control|contraception]], can be assessed two ways. ''Perfect use'' or ''method'' effectiveness rates only include people who use condoms properly and consistently. ''Actual use'', or ''typical use'' effectiveness rates are of all condom users, including those who use condoms incorrectly or do not use condoms at every act of intercourse. Rates are generally presented for the first year of use.<ref name="hatcher">{{cite book |first=RA |last=Hatcher |author2=Trussel, J |author3=Nelson, AL |year=2007 |title=Contraceptive Technology |edition=19th |publisher=Ardent Media | location=New York | isbn=1-59708-001-2 | url=http://www.contraceptivetechnology.com/table.html |accessdate=2009-07-26|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080531095926/http://www.contraceptivetechnology.com/table.html |archivedate = May 31, 2008|deadurl=yes|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Most commonly the [[Pearl Index]] is used to calculate effectiveness rates, but some studies use [[decrement table]]s.<ref name="kippley">{{cite book | first=John | last=Kippley |author2=Kippley, Sheila | year=1996 | title=The Art of Natural Family Planning | edition=4th addition | publisher=The Couple to Couple League | location=Cincinnati, OH | isbn=0-926412-13-2}}</ref>{{Rp|141}}

Condoms are widely recommended for the prevention of [[sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs). They have been shown to be effective in reducing infection rates in both men and women. While not perfect, the condom is effective at reducing the transmission of organisms that cause [[AIDS]], [[Herpes genitalis|genital herpes]], [[cervical cancer]], [[genital wart]]s, [[syphilis]], [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], [[gonorrhea]], and other diseases.<ref name="planned parenthood">{{cite web |title=Condom |publisher=Planned Parenthood | year=2008 |url=http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/condom-10187.htm |accessdate=2007-11-19 }}</ref> Condoms are often recommended as an adjunct to more effective birth control methods (such as [[IUD]]) in situations where STD protection is also desired.<ref name=DualProtection>{{cite journal|author=Cates, W., Steiner, M.

According to a 2000 report by the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), consistent use of latex condoms reduces the risk of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] transmission by approximately 85% relative to risk when unprotected, putting the seroconversion rate (infection rate) at 0.9 per 100 person-years with condom, down from 6.7 per 100 person-years.<ref name="workshop">{{cite conference |last=National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases | authorlink = National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases |title=Workshop Summary: Scientific Evidence on Condom Effectiveness for Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Prevention |pages=13–15 |date=2001-07-20 |location=Hyatt Dulles Airport, Herndon, Virginia |url=https://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/organization/dmid/documents/condomreport.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-09-22 }}</ref> Analysis published in 2007 from the [[University of Texas Medical Branch]]<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003255|author=Cayley, W.E. & Davis-Beaty, K.|year=2007|title=Effectiveness of Condoms in Reducing Heterosexual Transmission of HIV (Review)|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. |editor1-last=Weller|editor1-first=Susan C}}</ref> and the [[World Health Organization]]<ref>{{cite book|author=World Health Organization Department of Reproductive Health and Research (WHO/RHR) & Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health/Center for Communication Programs (CCP), INFO Project|year=2007|title=Family Planning: A Global Handbook for Providers| publisher=INFO Project at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health|url=http://www.infoforhealth.org/globalhandbook/index.shtml|page=200}}</ref> found similar risk reductions of 80–95%.

The 2000 NIH review concluded that condom use significantly reduces the risk of [[gonorrhea]] for men.<ref name="workshop"/> A 2006 study reports that proper condom use decreases the risk of transmission of [[human papillomavirus]] to women by approximately 70%.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Winer, R; Hughes, J; Feng, Q; O'Reilly, S; Kiviat, N; Holmes, K; Koutsky, L |title=Condom use and the risk of genital human papillomavirus infection in young women  | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa053284|journal=N Engl J Med |volume=354 |issue=25 |pages=2645–54 |year=2006 |pmid=16790697 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/354/25/2645 |accessdate=2007-04-07}}</ref> Another study in the same year found consistent condom use was effective at reducing transmission of [[Herpes simplex virus|herpes simplex virus-2]] also known as genital [[Herpes simplex|herpes]], in both men and women.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wald |first1=Anna |title=The Relationship between Condom Use and Herpes Simplex Virus Acquisition| journal = Annals of Internal Medicine| volume = 143|pages=707–713|year=2005 |pmid=16287791 | url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/143/10/707 |accessdate=2007-04-07 |last2=Langenberg |first2=AG |last3=Krantz |first3=E |last4=Douglas Jr |first4=JM |last5=Handsfield |first5=HH |last6=Dicarlo |first6=RP |last7=Adimora |first7=AA |last8=Izu |first8=AE |last9=Morrow |first9=RA |last10=Lawrence |first10=C |issue=10 | doi=10.7326/0003-4819-143-10-200511150-00007}}</ref>

Although a condom is effective in limiting exposure, some disease transmission may occur even with a condom. Infectious areas of the genitals, especially when symptoms are present, may not be covered by a condom, and as a result, some diseases like HPV and herpes may be transmitted by direct contact.<ref>{{cite web |last=Villhauer |first=Tanya |title=Condoms Preventing HPV? |publisher=University of Iowa Student Health Service/Health Iowa |date=2005-05-20 |url=http://www.uistudenthealth.com/question/default.aspx?q=738 |accessdate=2009-07-26 }}</ref> The primary effectiveness issue with using condoms to prevent STDs, however, is inconsistent use.<ref name="badnews" />

Condoms may also be useful in treating potentially [[cervical cancer|precancerous cervical changes]]. Exposure to human papillomavirus, even in individuals already infected with the virus, appears to increase the risk of precancerous changes. The use of condoms helps promote regression of these changes.<ref name="Hogewoning2003">{{cite journal |last1=Hogewoning |first1=Cornelis J |last2=Bleeker |first2=MC |last3=van den Bruler |first3=AJ |last4=Voorhorst |first4=Feja J |last5=Snijders |first5=Peter JF |last6=Berkhof |first6=Johannes |last7=Westenend |first7=Pieter J |last8=Meijer |first8=Chris JLM |title=Condom use Promotes the Regression of Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia and Clearance of HPV: Randomized Clinical Trial | journal = International Journal of Cancer | volume = 107 |pages=811–816 |year=2003| pmid = 14566832 | doi = 10.1002/ijc.11474 |issue= 5}}</ref> In addition, researchers in the UK suggest that a hormone in semen can aggravate existing cervical cancer, condom use during sex can prevent exposure to the hormone.<ref>{{cite news | title=Semen can worsen cervical cancer | publisher=[[Medical Research Council (UK)]] | url =http://www.mrc.ac.uk/NewsViewsAndEvents/News/MRC002621 |work=|pages=|accessdate=2007-12-02 |language=}}</ref>

=== Causes of failure ===
Condoms may slip off the penis after [[ejaculation]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sparrow, M; Lavill, K |title=Breakage and slippage of condoms in family planning clients |journal=Contraception |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=117–29 |year=1994 |pmid=7956211 |doi=10.1016/0010-7824(94)90048-5}}</ref> break due to improper application or physical damage (such as tears caused when opening the package), or break or slip due to latex degradation (typically from usage past the expiration date, improper storage, or exposure to oils). The rate of breakage is between 0.4% and 2.3%, while the rate of slippage is between 0.6% and 1.3%.<ref name="workshop" /> Even if no breakage or slippage is observed, 1–3% of women will test positive for semen residue after intercourse with a condom.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Walsh, T; Frezieres, R; Peacock, K; Nelson, A; Clark, V; Bernstein, L; Wraxall, B |title=Effectiveness of the male latex condom: combined results for three popular condom brands used as controls in randomized clinical trials |journal=Contraception |volume=70 |issue=5 |pages=407–13 |year=2004 |pmid=15504381 |doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2004.05.008}}</ref><ref name="pinhole">{{cite journal |author=Walsh, T; Frezieres, R; Nelson, A; Wraxall, B; Clark, V |title=Evaluation of prostate-specific antigen as a quantifiable indicator of condom failure in clinical trials |journal=Contraception |volume=60 |issue=5 |pages=289–98 |year=1999 |pmid=10717781 |doi=10.1016/S0010-7824(99)00098-0}}</ref>

"Double bagging", using two condoms at once, is often believed to cause a higher rate of failure due to the friction of rubber on rubber.<ref>{{cite web |title=Does using two condoms provide more protection than using just one condom? |work=Condoms and Dental Dams |publisher=New York University Student Health Center |url=http://www.nyu.edu/shc/promotion/condoms.dental.dams.html |accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Are two condoms better than one? |work=[[Go Ask Alice!]] |publisher=Columbia University |date=2005-01-21 |url=http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/1139.html |accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref> This claim is not supported by research.

Different modes of condom failure result in different levels of semen exposure. If a failure occurs during application, the damaged condom may be disposed of and a new condom applied before intercourse begins&nbsp;– such failures generally pose no risk to the user.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Richters, J; Donovan, B; Gerofi, J |title=How often do condoms break or slip off in use? |journal=Int J STD AIDS |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=90–4 |year= 1993|pmid=8476971}}</ref> One study found that semen exposure from a broken condom was about half that of unprotected intercourse; semen exposure from a slipped condom was about one-fifth that of unprotected intercourse.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Walsh, T; Frezieres, R; Peacock, K; Nelson, A; Clark, V; Bernstein, L; Wraxall, B |title=Use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to measure semen exposure resulting from male condom failures: implications for contraceptive efficacy and the prevention of sexually transmitted disease |journal=Contraception |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=139–50 |year=2003 |pmid=12586324 |doi=10.1016/S0010-7824(02)00478-X}}</ref>

Standard condoms will fit almost any [[Human penis size|penis]], with varying degrees of comfort or risk of slippage. Many condom manufacturers offer "snug" or "magnum" sizes. Some manufacturers also offer custom sized-to-fit condoms, with claims that they are more reliable and offer improved sensation/comfort.<ref name="cbstheyfit">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/10/11/business/main3358444.shtml |title=For Condoms, Maybe Size Matters After All |accessdate=2008-11-11 |date=2007-10-11|publisher=CBS News }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/10/11/business/main3358444.shtml |title=Next big thing, why condom size matters |accessdate=2008-11-11 |publisher=Menstruation.com | date=2007-10-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theyfit.ch/launch/ |title=TheyFit: World's First Sized to Fit Condoms |accessdate=2008-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20081023203354/http://www.theyfit.ch:80/launch/ |archivedate=23 October 2008 }}</ref> Some studies have associated larger penises and smaller condoms with increased breakage and decreased slippage rates (and vice versa), but other studies have been inconclusive.<ref name="fhi3" />

It is recommended for condoms manufacturers to avoid very thick or very thin condoms, because they are both considered less effective.<ref>{{cite book|author=World Health Organization, Department of Reproductive Health and Research| title=The male latex condom: specification and guidelines for condom procurement 2003|year=2004|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/family_planning/9241591277/en/index.html}}</ref> Some authors encourage users to choose thinner condoms "for greater durability, sensation, and comfort",<ref>{{cite book|author=Corina, H.|year=2007|title=S.E.X.: The All-You-Need-To-Know Progressive Sexuality Guide to Get You Through High School and College|publisher=Marlowe and Company|location=New York|pages=207–210|isbn=978-1-60094-010-1}}</ref> but others warn that "the thinner the condom, the smaller the force required to break it".<ref>{{cite journal|author=World Health Organization and The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS|title=The male latex condom|url=http://data.unaids.org/Publications/IRC-pub01/JC003-MaleCondom-FactSheets_en.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

Among people who intend condoms to be their form of birth control, pregnancy may occur when the user has sex without a condom. The person may have run out of condoms, or be traveling and not have a condom with them, or simply dislike the feel of condoms and decide to "take a chance". This type of behavior is the primary cause of typical use failure (as opposed to method or perfect use failure).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Steiner, M; Cates, W; Warner, L |title=The real problem with male condoms is nonuse | journal = Sex Transm Dis | volume = 26 | issue = 8 |pages=459–62 |year=1999 | pmid = 10494937 | doi = 10.1097/00007435-199909000-00007}}</ref>

== Use ==
[[File:CondomUse2 alternative.jpg|thumb|Illustrations showing how to put on a condom]]
Male condoms are usually packaged inside a foil or plastic wrapper, in a rolled-up form, and are designed to be applied to the tip of the penis and then unrolled over the [[erection|erect]] penis. It is important that some space be left in the tip of the condom so that semen has a place to collect; otherwise it may be forced out of the base of the device. After use, it is recommended the condom be wrapped in tissue or tied in a knot, then disposed of in a trash receptacle.<ref name="AliceDisposal" /> Condoms are used to reduce the likelihood of pregnancy during intercourse and to reduce the likelihood of contracting sexually-transmitted infections (STIs). Condoms are also used during fellatio to reduce the likelihood of contracting STIs.

Some couples find that putting on a condom interrupts sex, although others incorporate condom application as part of their foreplay. Some men and women find the physical barrier of a condom dulls sensation. Advantages of dulled sensation can include prolonged erection and delayed ejaculation; disadvantages might include a loss of some sexual excitement.<ref name="planned parenthood" /> Advocates of condom use also cite their advantages of being inexpensive, easy to use, and having few side effects.<ref name="planned parenthood" /><ref name="fwhc">{{cite web |title=Male Condom |publisher=Feminist Women's Health Center  |date=October 18, 2007 |url=http://www.fwhc.org/birth-control/condom.htm |accessdate=2007-11-19 }}</ref>

=== Adult film industry ===

This requirement has received much criticism and is said by some to be counter-productive, merely forcing companies that make pornographic films to relocate to other places without this requirement.<ref>{{cite web|title=Editorial Condoms for porn actors: A statewide law isn't the answer|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-condoms-porn-20140810-story.html|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=27 May 2015|date=August 10, 2014}}</ref> Producers claim that condom use depresses sales.<ref>{{cite web|title=Southern California -- This Just In|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/10/porn-actor-has-tested-positive-for-hiv-industry-clinic-officials-confirm.html|website=Los Angeles Times'|accessdate=27 May 2015|date=October 12, 2010}}</ref>

=== Sex education ===
Condoms are often used in [[sex education]] programs, because they have the capability to reduce the chances of pregnancy and the spread of some sexually transmitted diseases when used correctly. A recent [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) press release supported the inclusion of information about condoms in sex education, saying "''comprehensive sexuality education programs... discuss the appropriate use of condoms''", and "''promote condom use for those who are sexually active''."<ref>{{cite press release |title=Based on the research, comprehensive sex education is more effective at stopping the spread of HIV infection, says APA committee |publisher=American Psychological Association|date=February 23, 2005 |url=http://www.apa.org/releases/sexeducation.html |accessdate=2006-08-11 }}</ref>

In the United States, teaching about condoms in public schools is opposed by some religious organizations.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rector, Robert E; Pardue, Melissa G; Martin, Shannan |title=What Do Parents Want Taught in Sex Education Programs? |publisher=The Heritage Foundation|date=January 28, 2004 |url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/Welfare/bg1722.cfm |accessdate=2006-08-11 }}</ref> [[Planned Parenthood]], which advocates [[family planning]] and sex education, argues that no studies have shown abstinence-only programs to result in delayed intercourse, and cites surveys showing that 76% of American parents want their children to receive comprehensive sexuality education including condom use.<ref>{{cite web |title=New Study Supports Comprehensive Sex Ed Programs |publisher=Planned Parenthood of Northeast Ohio |date= 2007-07-07 |url=http://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/local-press-releases/new-study-supports-comprehensive-sex-ed-programs-22184.htm |accessdate=2009-07-26 }}</ref>

=== Infertility treatment {{anchor|Infertility treatment}} ===
<!-- [[Conception device]] links to anchor Infertility treatment -->
Common procedures in [[infertility]] treatment such as [[semen analysis]] and [[Artificial insemination|intrauterine insemination]] (IUI) require collection of semen samples. These are most commonly obtained through [[masturbation]], but an alternative to masturbation is use of a special ''collection condom'' to collect semen during sexual intercourse.

Collection condoms are made from silicone or polyurethane, as latex is somewhat harmful to sperm. Many men prefer collection condoms to masturbation, and some religions prohibit masturbation entirely. Also, compared with samples obtained from masturbation, semen samples from collection condoms have higher total sperm counts, sperm motility, and percentage of sperm with normal morphology. For this reason, they are believed to give more accurate results when used for semen analysis, and to improve the chances of pregnancy when used in procedures such as intracervical or intrauterine [[Artificial insemination|insemination]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sofikitis NV, Miyagawa I |title=Endocrinological, biophysical, and biochemical parameters of semen collected via masturbation versus sexual intercourse |journal=J.

For fertility treatments, a collection condom may be used to collect semen during [[sexual intercourse]] where the semen is provided by the woman's partner. Private [[sperm donation|sperm donors]] may also use a collection condom to obtain samples through masturbation or by sexual intercourse with a partner and will transfer the ejaculate from the collection condom to a specially designed container. The sperm is transported in such containers, in the case of a donor, to a recipient woman to be used for insemination, and in the case of a woman's partner, to a fertility clinic for processing and use. However, transportation may reduce the fecundity of the sperm. Collection condoms may also be used where semen is produced at a sperm bank or fertility clinic.

''Condom therapy'' is sometimes prescribed to infertile couples when the female has high levels of antisperm antibodies. The theory is that preventing exposure to her partner's semen will lower her level of antisperm antibodies, and thus increase her chances of pregnancy when condom therapy is discontinued. However, condom therapy has not been shown to increase subsequent pregnancy rates.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0272.1979.tb02229.x |author=Franken D, Slabber C |title=Experimental findings with spermantibodies: condom therapy (a case report) | journal = Andrologia | volume = 11 | issue = 6 |pages=413–6 |year=1979 | pmid = 532982}}<br />

=== Other uses ===
<!--

IMPORTANT: When adding a new listing, please include a reliable source that discusses the use.  Many condom uses belong to larger categories of use (e.g., smuggling drugs vs. specifically smuggling alcohol; storing water in emergency situations vs. storage in general); consider referring to general use instead of specific use.

Condoms excel as multipurpose containers and barriers because they are waterproof, elastic, durable, and (for military and espionage uses) will not arouse suspicion if found.

Ongoing military utilization began during World War II, and includes covering the muzzles of rifle barrels to prevent fouling,<ref name="dday">{{cite book |author=Ambrose, Stephen E |title=D-Day, June 6, 1944: the climactic battle of World War II |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=0-671-71359-0}}</ref> the waterproofing of firing assemblies in underwater demolitions,<ref>Couch, D (2001).

Condoms have also been used to [[drug smuggling|smuggle]] [[alcohol]], [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], and other drugs across borders and into prisons by filling the condom with drugs, tying it in a knot and then either swallowing it or inserting it into the [[rectum]]. These methods are very dangerous and potentially lethal; if the condom breaks, the drugs inside become absorbed into the bloodstream and can cause an overdose.<ref>"<cite>A 41-year-old man has been remanded in custody after being stopped on Saturday by customs officials at the Norwegian border at Svinesund.

== Types ==
Most condoms have a reservoir tip or teat end, making it easier to accommodate the man's ejaculate. Condoms come in different sizes, from oversized to snug and they also come in a variety of surfaces intended to stimulate the user's partner. Condoms are usually supplied with a [[Personal lubricant|lubricant]] coating to facilitate penetration, while flavored condoms are principally used for oral sex. As mentioned above, most condoms are made of latex, but [[#Synthetic|polyurethane]] and [[#Lambskin|lambskin]] condoms also exist.

=== Female condom ===
{{main|Female condom}}
[[File:Préservatif féminin.jpg|thumb|right|A female condom]]

Male condoms have a tight ring to form a seal around the penis while female condoms typically have a large stiff ring to keep them from slipping into the [[body orifice]]. The Female Health Company produced a female condom that was initially made of polyurethane, but newer versions are made of [[nitrile rubber|nitrile]]. Medtech Products produces a female condom made of latex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/female-condom.htm|title=The Female Condom|publisher=AVERT|accessdate=2009-03-26}}</ref>

=== Materials ===

==== Natural latex ====
[[File:Condom unrolled durex.jpg|thumb|375px|An unrolled latex condom]]

Latex has outstanding elastic properties: Its [[tensile strength]] exceeds 30&nbsp;MPa, and latex condoms may be stretched in excess of 800% before breaking.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Relationship of condom strength to failure during use | journal = PIACT Prod News | volume = 2 | issue = 2 |pages=1–2 |year=1980 | pmid = 12264044 |author1=Program for the Introduction and Adaptation of Contraceptive Technology PIACT}}</ref> In 1990 the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] set standards for condom production (ISO 4074, Natural latex rubber condoms), and the [[European Union|EU]] followed suit with its [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]] standard (Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices). Every latex condom is tested for holes with an electric current. If the condom passes, it is rolled and packaged. In addition, a portion of each batch of condoms is subject to water leak and air burst testing.<ref name="badnews">{{cite journal |last=Nordenberg |first=Tamar |title=Condoms: Barriers to Bad News | journal = FDA Consumer magazine |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |date=March–April 1998|url=http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ByAudience/ForPatientAdvocates/HIVandAIDSActivities/ucm126370.htm|accessdate=2007-06-07 }}</ref>

While the advantages of latex have made it the most popular condom material, it does have some drawbacks. Latex condoms are damaged when used with oil-based substances as [[Personal lubricant|lubricants]], such as [[petroleum jelly]], [[cooking oil]], [[baby oil]], [[mineral oil]], [[skin lotion]]s, [[Sunscreen|suntan lotions]], [[cold cream]]s, [[butter]] or [[margarine]].<ref>[http://info.k4health.org/pubs/ect/chapter11.pdfEssentials of Contraceptive Technology > Chapter 11 Condoms] From the Knowledge for Health Project, The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

==== Synthetic ====
The most common non-latex condoms are made from [[polyurethane]]. Condoms may also be made from other synthetic materials, such as [[AT-10 resin]], and most recently [[polyisoprene]].<ref name="isoprenepr">{{cite press release | title = Lifestyles Condoms Introduces Polyisoprene Non-latex | publisher = HealthNewsDigest.com | date = 2008-07-31 |url = http://healthnewsdigest.com/news/New_Product_460/Lifestyles_Condoms_printer.shtml |accessdate = 2008-08-24}}</ref>

Polyurethane condoms tend to be the same width and thickness as latex condoms, with most polyurethane condoms between 0.04&nbsp;mm and 0.07&nbsp;mm thick.<ref>{{cite web|title=Condoms |work=Condom Statistics and Sizes |date=2008-03-12|url=http://blog.condomman.com/articles/condom-use/all-you-need-to-know-on-condom-statistics-and-sizes/ |accessdate=2012-05-31 }}</ref>

Polyurethane can be considered better than latex in several ways: it conducts heat better than latex, is not as sensitive to temperature and ultraviolet light (and so has less rigid storage requirements and a longer shelf life), can be used with oil-based [[Personal lubricant|lubricants]], is less allergenic than latex, and does not have an odor.<ref name="nonlatex">{{cite journal |title=Nonlatex vs Latex Condoms: An Update | journal = The Contraception Report | volume = 14 | issue = 2 |publisher=Contraception Online|date=September 2003|url=http://www.contraceptiononline.org/contrareport/article01.cfm?art=243|accessdate=2006-08-14 |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060926035226/http://www.contraceptiononline.org/contrareport/article01.cfm?art=243 |archivedate = September 26, 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Polyurethane condoms have gained [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approval for sale in the United States as an effective method of contraception and HIV prevention, and under laboratory conditions have been shown to be just as effective as latex for these purposes.<ref name="AlicePolyLatex">{{cite web |title=Are polyurethane condoms as effective as latex ones? |publisher=[[Go Ask Alice!]] |date=February 22, 2005 |url=http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/1842.html|accessdate=2007-05-25 }}</ref>

However, polyurethane condoms are less elastic than latex ones, and may be more likely to slip or break than latex,<ref name="nonlatex" /><ref name="AlicePoly">{{cite web|title=Prefers polyurethane protection |publisher=[[Go Ask Alice!]]  |date=March 4, 2005|url=http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/1203.html |accessdate=2007-05-25 }}</ref> lose their shape or bunch up more than latex,<ref name="PPAA">{{cite news|title=Allergic to Latex?

Polyisoprene is a synthetic version of natural rubber latex. While significantly more expensive,<ref name="isopreneglove">{{cite web | title = Polyisoprene Surgical Gloves |publisher = SurgicalGlove.net | year = 2008 | url =http://www.surgicalglove.net/polyisoprene.html | accessdate = 2008-08-24}}</ref> it has the advantages of latex (such as being softer and more elastic than polyurethane condoms)<ref name="isoprenepr" /> without the protein which is responsible for latex allergies.<ref name="isopreneglove" /> Like polyurethane condoms, polyisoprene condoms are said to do a better job of transmitting body heat. Unlike polyurethane condoms, they cannot be used with an oil-based lubricant.<ref name="PPAA"/>

==== Lambskin ====
Condoms made from [[sheep]] [[intestine]]s, labeled "lambskin", are also available. Although they are generally effective as a contraceptive by blocking sperm, it is presumed that they are likely less effective than latex in preventing the transmission of agents that cause [[Sexually transmitted disease|STDs]], because of pores in the material.<ref>{{cite book |author=Boston Women's Health Book Collective |title=Our Bodies, Ourselves: A New Edition for a New Era |publisher=Touchstone |location=New York, NY |year=2005 |isbn=0-7432-5611-5 |page=333}}</ref> This is based on the idea that intestines, by their nature, are porous, permeable membranes, and while sperm are too large to pass through the pores, viruses—such as [[HIV]], [[herpes]], and [[genital warts]]—are small enough to pass through.<ref name="PPAA"/> However, there are to date no clinical data confirming or denying this theory. Some believe that lambskin condoms provide a more "natural" sensation, and they lack the allergens that are inherent to latex, but because of their lesser protection against infection, other hypoallergenic materials such as [[polyurethane]] are recommended for latex-allergic users and/or partners. Lambskin condoms are also significantly more expensive than other types and as slaughter by-products they are also not [[vegetarian]].

=== Spermicide ===
Some latex condoms are lubricated at the manufacturer with a small amount of a [[nonoxynol-9]], a [[spermicide|spermicidal chemical]]. According to [[Consumer Reports]], condoms lubricated with spermicide have no additional benefit in preventing pregnancy, have a shorter shelf life, and may cause [[urinary tract infection|urinary-tract infections]] in women.<ref>{{cite web |title=Condoms: Extra protection |work=ConsumerReports.org|date=February 2005 |url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cu-press-room/pressroom/archive/2005/02/eng0502tcv.htm?resultPageIndex=1&resultIndex=1&searchTerm=condom |accessdate=2009-07-26 }} {{dead link|date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}</ref> In contrast, application of separately packaged spermicide ''is'' believed to increase the contraceptive efficacy of condoms.<ref name="simultaneous" />

Nonoxynol-9 was once believed to offer additional protection against STDs (including HIV) but recent studies have shown that, with frequent use, nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of HIV transmission.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nonoxynol-9 and the Risk of HIV Transmission |work=HIV/AIDS Epi Update |publisher=Health Canada, Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control|date=April 2003 |url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/epiu-aepi/hiv-vih/nonoxynol-eng.php |accessdate=2006-08-06 }}</ref> The [[World Health Organization]] says that spermicidally lubricated condoms should no longer be promoted.

=== Ribbed and studded ===
[[File:Kondom - abgerollt - hängend.jpg|thumb|75px|A ribbed condom]]
Textured condoms include studded and ribbed condoms which can provide extra sensations to both partners. The studs or ribs can be located on the inside, outside, or both; alternatively, they are located in specific sections to provide directed stimulation to either the [[g-spot]] or [[Frenulum of prepuce of penis|frenulum]]. Many textured condoms which advertise "mutual pleasure" also are bulb-shaped at the top, to provide extra stimulation to the penis.<ref name="about">{{cite web |title=Condom Types: A look at different condom styles|url=http://contraception.about.com/od/malecondom/tp/CondomTypes.htm |last=Stacey|first=Dawn |accessdate=2008-12-08}}</ref> Some women experience irritation during vaginal intercourse with studded condoms.

=== Youth condoms ===
In March 2010, the Swiss government announced that it was planning to promote smaller condoms intended for boys and youths of 12–14 years old following concern about the pregnancy rate among adolescent girls, and also about the potential spread of AIDS among this age group. This was due to the fact that standard condoms were too wide and consequently failed to afford protection to adolescent boys during vaginal and anal intercourse. Family planning groups and the Swiss AIDS Federation had campaigned to have a narrower condom produced for youths after a number of studies, including a government study researched at the Centre for Development and Personality Psychology at [[Basel University]], found that standard condoms were unsuitable for boys in this age range, and that the condoms either failed during use or that the boys rejected them altogether because they were too wide, and consequently they used no protection at all.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7361181/Extra-small-condoms-for-12-year-old-boys-go-on-sale-in-Switzerland.html | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | location=London |title=Extra small condoms for 12 year-old boys go on sale in Switzerland | first=Alexandra| last=Williams | date=2010-03-03 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref>

As a result of these studies, a condom aimed at 12- to 14-year-old boys is now produced and is available in Switzerland and in certain other countries. Manufactured by Ceylor, the "Hotshot" is a lubricated, teat-ended latex condom which is narrower than a standard condom and has a tight band at the opening to ensure that it remains on the youth's penis during intercourse. A standard condom has a diameter of 2&nbsp;inches (5.2&nbsp;cm) whereas the Hotshot has a diameter of 1.7&nbsp;inches (4.5&nbsp;cm). Both are the same length–7.4&nbsp;inches (19&nbsp;cm). In 2014, in response to demand for condoms from a younger age-group, German condom manufacturer Amor started producing another condom aimed at young people. Known as "Amor Young Love", these lubricated condoms have a diameter of 1.9&nbsp;inches (4.9&nbsp;cm).

=== Other ===
The [[Anti-rape device|anti-rape condom]] is another variation designed to be worn by women. It is designed to cause pain to the attacker, hopefully allowing the victim a chance to escape.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rape-aXe: Questions and answers |publisher=Rape-aXe |year=2006 |url=http://www.antirape.co.za/questions.htm |accessdate=2009-08-13}}</ref>

A [[#Infertility treatment|collection condom]] is used to collect semen for fertility treatments or sperm analysis. These condoms are designed to maximize sperm life.

Some condom-like devices are intended for entertainment only, such as glow-in-the dark condoms. These [[novelties|novelty]] condoms may not provide protection against pregnancy and STDs.<ref name="planned parenthood"/>

== Prevalence ==
The prevalence of condom use varies greatly between countries. Most surveys of contraceptive use are among married women, or women in informal unions. Japan has the highest rate of condom usage in the world: in that country, condoms account for almost 80% of contraceptive use by married women. On average, in developed countries, condoms are the most popular method of birth control: 28% of married contraceptive users rely on condoms. In the average less-developed country, condoms are less common: only 6-8% of married contraceptive users choose condoms.<ref name="factsheet">{{cite journal |title=Family Planning Worldwide: 2008 Data Sheet|publisher=Population Reference Bureau |year=2008 |url=http://www.prb.org/pdf08/fpds08.pdf |format=PDF  |accessdate=2008-06-27 }} Data from surveys 1997–2007.</ref><!--

{{main|History of condoms}}
[[File:De Morbo Gallico.jpg|thumb|A page from ''De Morbo Gallico'' (The French Disease), Gabriele Falloppio's treatise on syphilis. Published in 1564, it describes what is possibly the first use of condoms.]]

=== Before the 19th century ===
Whether condoms were used in ancient civilizations is debated by archaeologists and historians.<ref name="collier">{{cite book | first=Aine | last=Collier | year=2007 |title=The Humble Little Condom: A History | publisher=Prometheus Books | location=Amherst, NY | isbn=978-1-59102-556-6}}</ref>{{Rp|11}} In ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome, pregnancy prevention was generally seen as a woman's responsibility, and the only well documented contraception methods were female-controlled devices.<ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|17,23}} In Asia before the 15th century, some use of [[glans]] condoms (devices covering only the head of the penis) is recorded. Condoms seem to have been used for contraception, and to have been known only by members of the upper classes. In China, glans condoms may have been made of oiled silk paper, or of lamb intestines. In Japan, they were made of tortoise shell or animal horn.<ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|60–1}}

After this, the use of penis coverings to protect from disease is described in a wide variety of literature throughout Europe. The first indication that these devices were used for birth control, rather than disease prevention, is the 1605 theological publication ''De iustitia et iure'' (On justice and law) by Catholic theologian [[Leonardus Lessius]], who condemned them as immoral.<ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|56}} In 1666, the English Birth Rate Commission attributed a recent downward fertility rate to use of "condons", the first documented use of that word (or any similar spelling).<ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|66–8}}

From at least the 18th century, condom use was opposed in some legal, religious, and medical circles for essentially the same reasons that are given today: condoms reduce the likelihood of pregnancy, which some thought immoral or undesirable for the nation; they do not provide full protection against sexually transmitted infections, while belief in their protective powers was thought to encourage sexual promiscuity; and, they are not used consistently due to inconvenience, expense, or loss of sensation.<ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|73,86–8,92}}

=== Rubber and manufacturing advances ===
In 1839, [[Charles Goodyear]] discovered a way of processing natural [[rubber]], which is too stiff when cold and too soft when warm, in such a way as to make it elastic. This proved to have advantages for the manufacture of condoms; unlike the sheep's gut condoms, they could stretch and did not tear quickly when used. The [[vulcanized rubber|rubber vulcanization]] process was patented by Goodyear in 1844.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Reprinted from ''India Rubber World'' |title=CHARLES GOODYEAR—The life and discoveries of the inventor of vulcanized India rubber | journal = Scientific American Supplement | issue = 787 |publisher=Munn & Co.  |location=New York  |date= 1891-01-31|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14009 |accessdate=2008-06-08}}<br />

Besides this type, small rubber condoms covering only the [[glans]] were often used in England and the United States. There was more risk of losing them and if the rubber ring was too tight, it would constrict the penis. This type of condom was the original "capote" (French for condom), perhaps because of its resemblance to a woman's bonnet worn at that time, also called a [[Bonnet (headgear)|capote]].

For many decades, rubber condoms were manufactured by wrapping strips of raw rubber around penis-shaped molds, then dipping the wrapped molds in a chemical solution to cure the rubber.<ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|148}} In 1912, Polish inventor [[Julius Fromm]] developed a new, improved manufacturing technique for condoms: dipping glass molds into a raw rubber solution.<ref name="billy" /> Called ''cement dipping'', this method required adding gasoline or benzene to the rubber to make it liquid.<ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|200}} [[Latex]], rubber suspended in water, was invented in 1920. Latex condoms required less labor to produce than cement-dipped rubber condoms, which had to be smoothed by rubbing and trimming. The use of water to suspend the rubber instead of [[gasoline]] and [[benzene]] eliminated the fire hazard previously associated with all condom factories. Latex condoms also performed better for the consumer: they were stronger and thinner than rubber condoms, and had a shelf life of five years (compared to three months for rubber).<ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|199–200}}

Until the twenties, all condoms were individually hand-dipped by semi-skilled workers. Throughout the decade of the 1920s, advances in the automation of the condom assembly line were made.

=== Etymology and other terms ===
The term ''condom'' first appears in the early 18th century. Its etymology is unknown.

== Society and culture ==

Some [[moral]] and [[scientific]] criticism of condoms exists despite the many benefits of condoms agreed on by [[scientific consensus]] and sexual health experts.

Condom usage is typically recommended for new couples who have yet to develop full trust in their partner with regard to STDs. Established couples on the other hand have few concerns about STDs, and can use other methods of birth control such as [[birth control pill|the pill]], which does not act as a barrier to intimate sexual contact. Note that the polar debate with regard to condom usage is attenuated by the target group the argument is directed. Notably the age category and stable partner question are factors, as well as the distinction between heterosexual and homosexuals, who have different kinds of sex and have different risk consequences and factors.

Among the prime objections to condom usage is the blocking of erotic sensation, and/or the intimacy that barrier-free sex provides. As the condom is held tightly to the skin of the penis, it diminishes the delivery of stimulation through rubbing and friction. Condom proponents claim this has the benefit of making sex last longer, by diminishing sensation and delaying male ejaculation. Those who promote condom-free heterosexual sex (slang: "[[Bareback (sex)|bareback]]") claim that the condom puts a prophylactic barrier between partners, diminishing what is normally a highly sensual, intimate, and spiritual connection between partners.

[[Roman Catholic Church]] opposes all kinds of sexual acts outside of marriage, as well as any sexual act in which the chance of successful conception has been reduced by [[direct and intentional]] acts (for example, [[Human sterilization|surgery to prevent conception]]) or foreign objects (for example, condoms).<ref>{{cite web|title=Humanæ Vitæ |author=[[Pope Paul VI]] |date=1968-07-25 |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html |accessdate=2009-07-23}}</ref>

The use of condoms to prevent STD transmission is not specifically addressed by Catholic doctrine, and is currently a topic of debate among theologians and high-ranking Catholic authorities.

In addition, the large-scale use of disposable condoms has resulted in concerns over their environmental impact via [[littering]] and in [[landfills]], where they can eventually wind up in [[wildlife]] environments if not [[incinerated]] or otherwise permanently disposed of first. Polyurethane condoms in particular, given they are a form of [[plastic]], are not [[biodegradable]], and latex condoms take a very long time to break down. Experts, such as [[AVERT]], recommend condoms be disposed of in a garbage receptacle, as flushing them down the toilet (which some people do) may cause plumbing blockages and other problems.<ref name="AliceDisposal">{{cite web |title=Environmentally-friendly condom disposal |publisher=[[Go Ask Alice!]] |date=December 20, 2002 |url=http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/2311.html |accessdate=2007-10-28 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/condom.htm |title=Using Condoms, Condom Types & Condom Sizes |publisher=AVERT |accessdate=2009-03-26}}</ref> Furthermore, the plastic and foil wrappers condoms are packaged in are also not biodegradable. However, the benefits condoms offer are widely considered to offset their small landfill mass.<ref name="AliceDisposal" /> Frequent condom or wrapper disposal in public areas such as a parks have been seen as a persistent litter problem.<ref name="power">{{cite web|last=Power |first=Robert |title=The black plastic bag of qualitative research |work=BMJ.com |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/318/7175/48#1918 |accessdate=2007-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20050217003757/http://www.bmj.com:80/cgi/eletters/318/7175/48 |archivedate=17 February 2005 }}</ref>

While biodegradable,<ref name="AliceDisposal" /> latex condoms damage the environment when disposed of improperly. According to the Ocean Conservancy, condoms, along with [[marine debris|certain other types of trash]], cover the [[coral reef]]s and smother [[sea grass]] and other bottom dwellers. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] also has expressed concerns that many animals might mistake the litter for food.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hightower |first1=Eve |last2=Hall |first2=Phoebe |title=Clean sex, wasteful computers and dangerous mascara&nbsp;– Ask E | journal = [[E–The Environmental Magazine]] |date=March–April 2003 |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1594/is_2_14/ai_98469962 |accessdate=2007-10-28 }}</ref>

=== Cultural barriers to use ===
In much of the [[Western world]], the introduction of [[combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]] in the 1960s was associated with a decline in condom use.<ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|267–9,272–5}} In [[Japan]], oral contraceptives were not approved for use until September 1999, and even then access was more restricted than in other industrialized nations.<ref name="cbs">{{cite news |author=Hayashi, Aiko |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/08/20/health/main637523.shtml |title=Japanese Women Shun The Pill |publisher=CBS News |date=2004-08-20 |accessdate=2006-06-12}}</ref> Perhaps because of this restricted access to hormonal contraception, Japan has the highest rate of condom usage in the world: in 2008, 80% of contraceptive users relied on condoms.<ref name="factsheet"/>

Cultural attitudes toward [[gender roles]], [[contraception]], and [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] vary greatly around the world, and range from extremely conservative to extremely liberal. But in places where condoms are misunderstood, mischaracterised, demonised, or looked upon with overall cultural disapproval, the prevalence of condom use is directly affected. In less-developed countries and among less-educated populations, misperceptions about how disease transmission and conception work negatively affect the use of condoms; additionally, in cultures with more traditional gender roles, women may feel uncomfortable demanding that their partners use condoms.

As an example, [[Latino]] immigrants in the [[United States]] often face cultural barriers to condom use. A study on female HIV prevention published in the ''Journal of Sex Health Research'' asserts that Latino women often lack the attitudes needed to negotiate safe sex due to traditional gender-role norms in the Latino community, and may be afraid to bring up the subject of condom use with their partners. Women who participated in the study often reported that because of the general [[machismo]] subtly encouraged in Latino culture, their male partners would be angry or possibly [[domestic violence|violent]] at the woman's suggestion that they use condoms.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gomez |first=Cynthia A |year=1996 |title=Gender, Culture, and Power: Barriers to HIV-Prevention Strategies for Women |journal=The Journal of Sex Research |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=355–362 |author2=Marín |doi=10.1080/00224499609551853 |jstor=3813287 | url = http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00224499609551853 }}</ref> A similar phenomenon has been noted in a survey of low-income [[African-American|American black]] women; the women in this study also reported a fear of violence at the suggestion to their male partners that condoms be used.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Kalichman |first1=Seth C. | last2 = Williams | first2 = Ernestine A. | last3 = Cherry | first3 = Charsey | last4 = Belcher | first4 = Lisa | last5 = Nachimson | first5 = Dena | title = Sexual coercion, domestic violence, and negotiating condom use among low-income African American women | journal = [[Journal of Women's Health]] | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 371–378 | publisher = [[Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.]] | doi = 10.1089/jwh.1998.7.371 | date = April 1998 | url = http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/jwh.1998.7.371 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref>

A telephone survey conducted by [[Rand Corporation]] and [[Oregon State University]], and published in the ''[[Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes]]'' showed that belief in [[AIDS conspiracy theories]] among United States black men is linked to rates of condom use. As conspiracy beliefs about AIDS grow in a given sector of these black men, consistent condom use drops in that same sector. Female use of condoms was not similarly affected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sexualhealth.e-healthsource.com/?p=news1&id=523594|title=AIDS Conspiracy Theory Belief Linked to Less Condom Use|last=Dotinga|first=Randy|publisher=SexualHealth.com|accessdate=2009-03-26}}</ref>

In the African continent, condom promotion in some areas has been impeded by anti-condom campaigns by some Muslim<ref name="northeast kenya"/> and Catholic clerics.<ref name="catholicafrica"/> Among the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] in [[Tanzania]], condom use is hampered by an aversion to "wasting" sperm, which is given sociocultural importance beyond reproduction. Sperm is believed to be an "elixir" to women and to have beneficial health effects. Maasai women believe that, after conceiving a child, they must have sexual intercourse repeatedly so that the additional sperm aids the child's development. Frequent condom use is also considered by some Maasai to cause impotence.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Coast |first=Ernestina |year=2007 |title=Wasting semen: context and condom use among the Maasai |journal=Culture, health, and sexuality |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/2502/1/Wasting_semen-context_and_condom_use_among_the_Maasai(LSERO).pdf |accessdate=2009-07-26 |doi=10.1080/13691050701208474 |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=387}}</ref> Some women in Africa believe that condoms are "for prostitutes" and that respectable women should not use them.<ref name="northeast kenya">{{cite web|url=http://www.plusnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=74336|title=Muslim opposition to condoms limits distribution |date=Sep 17, 2007|publisher=PlusNews|accessdate=2009-03-26}}</ref> A few clerics even promote the idea that condoms are deliberately laced with HIV.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/pius-kamau/islam-condoms-and-aids_b_120418.html |title=Islam, Condoms and AIDS |last=Kamau |first=Pius |date=August 24, 2008 |publisher=The Huffington Post |accessdate=2009-03-26}}</ref> In the United States, possession of many condoms has been used by police to accuse women of engaging in prostitution.<ref name=Big2014>{{cite news |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ny-bill-would-bar-condoms-proof-prostitution |title=NY bill would bar condoms as proof of prostitution |last1=KLEPPER |first1=DAVID |date=27 April 2014 |website=ap.org |publisher=AP |accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref> The [[Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS]] has condemned this practice and there are efforts to end it.<ref name=Big2014/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Wurth|first=MH|author2=Schleifer, R |author3=McLemore, M |author4=Todrys, KW |author5= Amon, JJ |title=Condoms as evidence of prostitution in the United States and the criminalization of sex work.|journal=Journal of the International AIDS Society|date=May 24, 2013|volume=16|pages=18626|pmid=23706178 |pmc=3664300 |doi=10.7448/ias.16.1.18626}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sfbg.com/politics/2012/10/07/city-cease-using-condoms-evidence-prostitution-cases |title=City to cease using condoms as evidence in prostitution cases |last1=Chanoff |first1=Yael |date=7 October 2014 |website=www.sfbg.com |publisher=San Francisco Bay Guardian |accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref>

In March 2013, technology mogul [[Bill Gates]] offered a US$100,000 grant through his foundation for a condom design that "significantly preserves or enhances pleasure" to encourage more males to adopt the use of condoms for safer sex. The grant information states: “The primary drawback from the male perspective is that condoms decrease pleasure as compared to no condom, creating a trade-off that many men find unacceptable, particularly given that the decisions about use must be made just prior to intercourse. Is it possible to develop a product without this stigma, or better, one that is felt to enhance pleasure?” The project has been named the "Next Generation Condom" and anyone who can provide a "testable hypothesis" is eligible to apply.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bill Gates offers $100,000 grant for improved condoms|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/mar/24/bill-gates-offers-100000-grant-improved-condoms/|accessdate=2 May 2013|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=24 March 2013|author=Jessica Chasmar}}</ref>

Middle-Eastern couples who have not had children, because of the strong desire and social pressure to establish fertility as soon as possible within marriage, rarely use condoms.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3649633?uid=3739560&uid=2&uid=4&uid=3739256&sid=21103178898893|title= The Sociocultural Context of Condom Use Within Marriage in Rural Lebanon|last1= Kulczycki|first1= Andrzej|date= 4 December 2004|website= www.jstor.org|publisher= jstor.org|accessdate=December 10, 2013}}</ref>

One analyst described the size of the condom market as something that "boggles the mind". Numerous small manufacturers, nonprofit groups, and government-run manufacturing plants exist around the world.<ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|322,328}} Within the condom market, there are several major contributors, among them both for-profit businesses and philanthropic organizations. Most large manufacturers have ties to the business that reach back to the end of the 19th century.

A [[spray-on condom]] made of latex is intended to be easier to apply and more successful in preventing the transmission of diseases.

The Invisible Condom, developed at [[Université Laval]] in Québec, Canada, is a gel that hardens upon increased temperature after insertion into the vagina or rectum. In the lab, it has been shown to effectively block HIV and herpes simplex virus. The barrier breaks down and liquefies after several hours. As of 2005, the invisible condom is in the clinical trial phase, and has not yet been approved for use.<ref>{{cite web |title=Safety, Tolerance and Acceptability Trial of the Invisible Condom in Healthy Women |work=ClinicalTrials.gov |publisher=U.S. National Institutes of Health |date=August 2005 |url=http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/gui/show/NCT00136643?order=6 |accessdate=2006-08-14 }}</ref>

Also developed in 2005 is a condom treated with an erectogenic compound. The drug-treated condom is intended to help the wearer maintain his erection, which should also help reduce slippage. If approved, the condom would be marketed under the Durex brand. As of 2007, it was still in clinical trials.<ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|345}} In 2009, Ansell Healthcare, the makers of Lifestyle condoms, introduced the X2 condom lubricated with "Excite Gel" which contains the amino acid l-arginine and is intended to improve the strength of the erectile response.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lifestyles.com/condoms.php |title=Condoms: Lifestyles Condoms |publisher=Lifestyles.com |accessdate=2012-08-15}}</ref>
