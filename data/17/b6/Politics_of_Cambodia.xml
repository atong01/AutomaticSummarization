He or she is appointed by the King on the recommendation of the President and Vice Presidents of the National Assembly. In order for a person to become Prime Minister, he or she must first be given a vote of confidence by the National Assembly.</paragraph><paragraph>The Prime Minister is officially the<space/><link><target>Head of Government</target></link><space/>in Cambodia.

His government is regularly accused of ignoring human rights and suppressing political dissent.

Under the Constitution, the King has no political power, but as Norodom Sihanouk was revered in the country, his word often carried much influence in the government. For example, in February 2004, he issued a proclamation stating that since Cambodia is a &quot;liberal democracy,&quot; the Kingdom ought to allow<space/><link><target>gay marriage</target></link>. While such views are not prevalent in Cambodia, his word was respected by his subjects. The King, often irritated over the conflicts in his government, several times threatened to abdicate unless the political factions in the government got along. This put pressure on the government to solve their differences. This influence of the King was often used to help mediate differences in government.</paragraph><paragraph>After the abdication of King Norodom Sihanouk in 2004, he was succeeded by his son<space/><link><target>Norodom Sihamoni</target></link>. While the retired King was highly revered in his country for dedicating his lifetime to Cambodia, the current King has spent most of his life abroad in<space/><link><target>France</target></link>. Thus, it remains to be seen whether the new King's views will be as highly respected as his father's.</paragraph><paragraph>Although in the<space/><link><target>Khmer language</target></link><space/>there are many words meaning &quot;king&quot;, the word officially used in Khmer (as found in the 1993 Cambodian Constitution) is<space/><italics>preahmhaksat</italics><space/>(Khmer regular script:<link><target>Image:Seihamuni11.png</target><part>80px</part></link>), which literally means:<space/><italics>preah</italics>- (&quot;sacred&quot;, cognate of the Indian word<space/><link><target>Brahmin</target></link>) -<italics>mha</italics>- (from<space/><link><target>Sanskrit</target></link>, meaning &quot;great&quot;, cognate with &quot;maha-&quot; in<space/><link><target>maharaja</target></link>) -<italics>ksat</italics><space/>(&quot;warrior, ruler&quot;, cognate of the Indian word<space/><link><target>Kshatriya</target></link>).</paragraph><paragraph>On the occasion of HM King Norodom Sihanouk's retirement in September 2004, the Cambodian National Assembly coined a new word for the retired king:<space/><italics>preahmhaviraksat</italics><space/>(Khmer regular script:<link><target>Image:Sihanouk6.png</target><part>90px</part></link>), where<space/><italics>vira</italics><space/>comes from Sanskrit<space/><italics>vra</italics>, meaning &quot;brave or eminent man, hero, chief&quot;, cognate of<space/><link><target>Latin</target></link><space/><italics>vir</italics>,<space/><italics>viris</italics>,<space/><link><target>English language</target><part>English</part></link><space/><italics>virile</italics>.<space/><italics>Preahmhaviraksat</italics><space/>is translated in English as &quot;King-Father&quot; (<template><target>lang-fr</target><arg>Roi-Père</arg></template>), although the word &quot;father&quot; does not appear in the Khmer noun.</paragraph><paragraph>As<space/><italics>preahmhaviraksat</italics>, Norodom Sihanouk retained many of the prerogatives he formerly held as<space/><italics>preahmhaksat</italics><space/>and was a highly respected and listened-to figure.
