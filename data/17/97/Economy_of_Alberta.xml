This area is slightly more humid and treed than the drier<space/><link><target>prairie</target></link><space/>(grassland) region called<space/><link><target>Palliser's Triangle</target></link><space/>to its south, and large areas of the south (the<space/><link><target>Special Areas, Alberta</target><part>Special Areas</part></link>) were<space/><link><target>depopulated</target></link><space/>during the<space/><link><target>droughts</target></link><space/>of the 1920s and 30s. The<space/><link><target>chernozem</target></link><space/>(black soil) of the parkland region is more agriculturally productive than the red and grey soils to the south. Urban development has also been most advanced in the parkland belt. Edmonton and Red Deer are parkland cities, while Calgary is on the parkland-prairie fringe.

Both cities are mature service economies built on a base of resource extraction in their hinterlands. However Calgary is predominant in hosting the regional and national headquarters of oil and gas exploration and drilling companies.

In line with<space/><link><target>Harold Innis</target></link>' &quot;<link><target>Staples Thesis</target></link>&quot;, the economy has changed substantially as different export commodities have risen or fallen in importance. In sequence, the most important products have been: fur, wheat and beef, and oil and gas.</paragraph><paragraph>The development of<space/><link><target>transportation in Alberta</target></link><space/>has been crucial to its historical economic development.

Immigration into the province was eased tremendously by the arrival of the<space/><link><target>Canadian Pacific Railway</target></link>'s<space/><link><target>transcontinental line</target></link><space/>in 1880s. Commercial farming became viable in the area once the<space/><link><target>grain trade</target></link><space/>had developed technologies to handle the<space/><link><target>bulk cargo</target><part>bulk</part></link><space/>export of grain, especially<space/><link><target>hopper car</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>grain elevator</target><trail>s</trail></link>.

The health of economy was closely bound up with the<space/><link><target>price of wheat</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1947 a major<space/><link><target>oil field</target></link><space/>was discovered near Edmonton. It was not the first petroleum find in Alberta, but it was large enough to significantly alter the economy of the province (and coincided with growing American demand for energy). Since that time, Alberta's economic fortunes have largely tracked the<space/><link><target>price of oil</target></link>, and increasingly<space/><link><target>natural gas prices</target></link>. When oil prices spiked during the<space/><link><target>1967 Oil Embargo</target></link>,<space/><link><target>1973 oil crisis</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>1979 energy crisis</target></link>, Alberta's economy boomed. However, during the<space/><link><target>1980s oil glut</target></link><space/>Alberta's economy suffered. Alberta boomed once again during the<space/><link><target>2003 to 2008 world oil market chronology</target><part>2003-2008 oil price spike</part></link>. In July 2008 the price of oil peaked and began to decline and Alberta's economy soon followed suit, with unemployment doubling within a year. By 2009 with natural gas prices at a long-term low, Alberta's economy was in poor health compared to before, although still relatively better than many other comparable jurisdictions. By 2012, despite natural gas prices at a ten-year low and a higher Canadian dollar, oil prices had recovered enough to restart economic growth.</paragraph><paragraph>The spin-offs from petroleum have allowed Alberta to develop many other industries.
