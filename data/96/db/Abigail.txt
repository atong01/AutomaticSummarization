==Biblical history==
In the passage from 1 Samuel, [[Nabal]] demonstrates ingratitude towards [[David]], and Abigail attempts to placate David in order to stop him taking revenge. She gives him food, and speaks to him, urging him not to "have on his conscience the staggering burden of needless bloodshed" (verse 31, [[NIV]]) and reminding him that [[God]] will make him a "[[Davidic line|lasting dynasty]]" (verse 28). [[Jon Levenson]] calls this an "undeniable [[wikt:adumbration|adumbration]]" of [[Nathan (prophet)|Nathan]]'s prophecy in [[Covenant (biblical)#Davidic covenant|2 Samuel 7]].<ref name=Levenson>[[Jon D. Levenson]], "1 Samuel 25 as Literature and History," ''[[Catholic Biblical Quarterly|CBQ]]'' 40 [1978] 20.</ref> [[Alice Bach]] notes that Abigail pronounces a "crucial prophecy,"<ref>[[Alice Bach]], "[http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=1945&C=1780 The Pleasure of Her Text]," ''[[Union Seminary Quarterly Review]]'' 43 [1989] 44.</ref> and the [[Talmud]] regards her as one of the [[Tanakh]]'s seven female prophets.<ref>[[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] [http://www.halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Megilah.pdf 14a]</ref> Levenson, however, suggests that she "senses the drift of history" from intelligence rather than from special revelation.<ref name=Levenson />

After Abigail reveals to Nabal what she has done, "[[Yahweh]] struck Nabal and he died," (v.38), after which David married her. Abigail is described as intelligent and beautiful. The [[Talmud]] amplifies this idea, mentioning her as being one of the "four women of surpassing beauty in the world," (the other three being [[Rahab]], [[Sarah]], and [[Esther]]).  As the wife of the wealthy Nabal, she is also a woman of high socioeconomic status. Whether David married her because he was attracted to her, or as an astute political move, or both is unclear.<ref name=Berlin>[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/abigail-bible Berlin, Adele. "Abigail: Bible", Jewish Women's Archive]</ref>

Abigail and David's third wife, Ahinoam the Jezreelite, accompany David and his war band when they seek refuge in Philistine territory. While David and his men were encamped near Jezreel, and when they are captured by Amalekites raided the town of Ziglak and carried off the women and children. David led the pursuit and they were subsequently rescued. Both wives then settle with David in Hebron, where Abigail gives birth to David’s second son, Chileab (also called Daniel).<ref name=Berlin/>

Abigail is also listed as one of the seven Jewish women prophets, the other six being [[Miriam]], [[Deborah]], [[Hannah (biblical figure)|Hannah]], [[Sarah]], [[Huldah]],and [[Esther]].<ref>[[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] [http://www.halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Megilah.pdf 15a]</ref> In terms of her moral character, [[Abraham Kuyper]] argues that Abigail's conduct indicates "a most appealing character and unwavering faith,"<ref>[[Abraham Kuyper]], ''Women of the Old Testament'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1941), 106.</ref> but Alice Bach regards her as subversive.<ref>Alice Bach, "[http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=1945&C=1780 The Pleasure of Her Text]," ''Union Seminary Quarterly Review'' 43 [1989] 41.</ref>

Adele Berlin contrasts the story of Abigail with that of Bathsheba. In one, the wife prevents David from murdering her foolish and greedy husband. In the second, David orders the murder of a good man because he desires his wife. "In the Abigail story, David, the potential king, is seen as increasingly strong and virtuous, whereas in the Bathsheba story, the reigning monarch shows his flaws ever more overtly and begins to lose control of his family."<ref name=Berlin/>

[[Jon D. Levenson|Levenson]] and [[Halpern]] suggest that Abigail may, in fact, also be the same person as [[Abigail (mother of Amasa)|Abigail, mother of Amasa]].<ref>[[Jon D. Levenson]] and [[Baruch Halpern]], "The Political Import of David's Marriages," ''[[Journal of Biblical Literature|JBL]]'' 99 [1980] 511–512.</ref> [[Richard M. Davidson]], however, points out that "on the basis of the final form of Old Testament canon, references to Abigail in the biblical accounts indicate two different individuals."<ref>{{cite book|last=Davidson|first=Richard M.|author-link=Richard M. Davidson|title=Flame of Yahweh: A Theology of Sexuality in the Old Testament|year=2007|publisher=Hendrickson|page=444}}</ref>

==Generic use==
Abigail's self-styling as a ''[[handmaid]]''<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|25:25|}} and following</ref> led to ''Abigail'' being the traditional term for a waiting-woman, for example as the ''waiting [[gentlewoman]]'' in [[Beaumont and Fletcher]]'s ''[[The Scornful Lady]]'', published in 1616. [[Jonathan Swift]] and [[Henry Fielding]] use ''Abigail'' in this generic sense, as does [[Charlotte Brontë]]. [[Anthony Trollope]] makes two references to ''the abigail'' (all lower case) in ''[[The Eustace Diamonds]]'', at the beginning of Chapter 42, whilst [[Thomas Mann]] makes the same reference at the start of the second chapter of Part 2 in [[Buddenbrooks]] (published in 1901). [[William Rose Benet]] notes the notoriety of [[Abigail Hill]], better known as "Mrs Masham", a [[lady-in-waiting]] to [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].<ref>''The Reader's Encyclopedia'', 1948, ''s.v.'' "Abigail".</ref> [[George MacDonald Fraser]] makes mention of "an ''abigail'' fussing about the room" in his novel ''[[Flashman (novel)|Flashman]]'' from ''[[The Flashman Papers]]'' series.
