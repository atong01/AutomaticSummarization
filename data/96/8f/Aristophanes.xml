An elaborate series of lotteries, designed to prevent prejudice and corruption, reduced the voting judges at the City Dionysia to just five in number. These judges probably reflected the mood of the audiences<extension extension_name='ref'>Barrett (1964) p.26</extension><space/>yet there is much uncertainty about the composition of those audiences.<extension extension_name='ref'>Barrett (1964) p.25</extension><space/>The theatres were certainly huge, with seating for at least 10&amp;nbsp;000 at the Theatre of Dionysus. The day's program at the City Dionysia for example was crowded, with three tragedies and a '<link><target>satyr</target></link>' play ahead of a comedy, but it is possible that many of the poorer citizens (typically the main supporters of<space/><link><target>demagogues</target></link><space/>like Cleon) occupied the festival holiday with other pursuits. The conservative views expressed in the plays might therefore reflect the attitudes of the dominant group in an unrepresentative audience. The production process might also have influenced the views expressed in the plays. Throughout most of Aristophanes' career, the Chorus was essential to a play's success and it was recruited and funded by a<space/><italics><link><target>choregus</target></link></italics>, a wealthy citizen appointed to the task by one of the<space/><link><target>archon</target><trail>s</trail></link>. A choregus could regard his personal expenditure on the Chorus as a civic duty and a public honour, but Aristophanes showed in<space/><italics><link><target>The Knights</target></link></italics><space/>that wealthy citizens might regard civic responsibilities as punishment imposed on them by demagogues and populists like Cleon.<extension extension_name='ref'><italics>Aristophanis Comoediae</italics><space/>Tomus 1, F.W.Hall and W.M.Geldart (eds), Oxford Classical Texts,<space/><italics>The Knights</italics><space/>lines 911-25</extension><space/>Thus the political conservatism of the plays may reflect the views of the wealthiest section of Athenian society, on whose generosity all dramatists depended for putting on their plays.<extension extension_name='ref'>W.Rennie,<space/><italics>The Acharnians of Aristophanes</italics>,<space/><link><target>Edward Arnold (publisher)</target><part>Edward Arnold</part></link><space/>(London, 1909), page 7, reproduced by Bibliolife</extension></paragraph><paragraph>When Aristophanes' first play<space/><italics>The Banqueters</italics><space/>was produced, Athens was an ambitious, imperial power and<space/><link><target>The Peloponnesian War</target></link><space/>was only in its fourth year.

The plays are particularly scathing in criticism of war profiteers, among whom populists such as Cleon figure prominently.

One of the main reasons why Aristophanes was so against the sophists came into existence from the requirements listed by the leaders of the organization. Money was essential, which meant that roughly all of the pupils studying with the sophists came from upper-class backgrounds and excluded the rest of the polis.
