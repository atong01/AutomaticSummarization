Antacids are available [[over the counter]] and are taken by mouth to quickly relieve occasional [[heartburn]], the major symptom of [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]]. Treatment with antacids alone is symptomatic and only justified for minor symptoms.<ref name=AHRQ>U.S. Department of Health & Human Services. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality 23 September 2011 [http://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/index.cfm/search-for-guides-reviews-and-reports/?pageaction=displayproduct&productID=756 Consumer Summary - Treatment Options for GERD or Acid Reflux Disease: A Review of the Research for Adults]</ref>

Antacids are distinct from acid-reducing drugs like [[H2-receptor antagonist]]s or [[proton pump inhibitor]]s and they do not kill the bacteria, ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'', which causes most [[gastric ulcer|ulcers]].<ref name=AHRQ/>

Versions with magnesium may cause diarrhea, and brands with calcium or aluminium may cause constipation and rarely, long-term use may cause kidney stones. Long term use of versions with aluminum may increase the risk for getting [[osteoporosis]].<ref name=MedlinePlus>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, U.S. National Library of Medicine.
