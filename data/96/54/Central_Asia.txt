'''Central Asia''' is the core region of the [[Asia]]n [[continent]] and stretches from the [[Caspian Sea]] in the west to [[People's Republic of China|China]] in the east and from [[Afghanistan]] in the south to [[Russia]] in the north. It is also sometimes referred to as '''Middle Asia''', and, colloquially, "the [[-stan|'stans]]" (as the six countries generally considered to be within the region all have names ending with the [[Persian language|Persian]] suffix "-stan", meaning "land of")<ref>{{cite web|author=Paul McFedries |url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/stans.asp |title=stans |publisher=Word Spy |date=25 October 2001 |accessdate=16 February 2011}}</ref> and is within the scope of the wider [[Eurasia]]n continent.

In modern contexts, all definitions of Central Asia include these five republics of the former [[Soviet Union]]: [[Kazakhstan]] (pop. 17 million), [[Kyrgyzstan]] (5.7 million), [[Tajikistan]] (8.0 million), [[Turkmenistan]] (5.2 million), and [[Uzbekistan]] (30 million), for a total population of about 66 million as of 2013–2014. [[Afghanistan]] (pop. 31.1 million) is also sometimes included.

Various definitions of Central Asia's exact composition exist, and not one definition is universally accepted. Despite this uncertainty in defining borders, the region does have some important overall characteristics. For one, Central Asia has historically been closely tied to its [[nomad]]ic peoples and the [[Silk Road]].<ref>[http://www.allempires.com/article/index.php?q=Central_Asia Steppe Nomads and Central Asia]</ref> As a result, it has acted as a crossroads for the movement of people, goods, and ideas between [[Europe]], [[Western Asia]], [[South Asia]], and [[East Asia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.silk-road.com/artl/srtravelmain.shtml|title=Travelers on the Silk Road|author=Silkroad Foundation, Adela C.Y.

During pre-Islamic and early Islamic times, Central Asia was a predominantly [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]]<ref name="ReferenceA">Encyclopædia Iranica, "CENTRAL ASIA: The Islamic period up to the Mongols", C. Edmund Bosworth: "In early Islamic times Persians tended to identify all the lands to the northeast of Khorasan and lying beyond the Oxus with the region of Turan, which in the Shahnama of Ferdowsi is regarded as the land allotted to Fereydun's son Tur. The denizens of Turan were held to include the Turks, in the first four centuries of Islam essentially those nomadizing beyond the Jaxartes, and behind them the Chinese (see Kowalski; Minorsky, "Turan"). Turan thus became both an ethnic and a diareeah term, but always containing ambiguities and contradictions, arising from the fact that all through Islamic times the lands immediately beyond the Oxus and along its lower reaches were the homes not of Turks but of Iranian peoples, such as the Sogdians and Khwarezmians."</ref><ref>C.E.

After expansion by [[Turkic peoples]], Central Asia also became the homeland for many Turkic peoples, including the [[Kazakhs]], [[Uzbeks]], [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]], [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] and other extinct Turkic nations. Central Asia is sometimes referred to as [[Turkestan]].<ref>{{cite book| last1 = Polo| first1 = Marco| last2 = Smethurst| first2 = Paul| title = The Travels of Marco Polo| year = 2005| isbn = 978-0-7607-6589-0| page = 676 }}</ref><ref>Ferrand, Gabriel (1913), "Ibn Batūtā", Relations de voyages et textes géographiques arabes, persans et turks relatifs à l'Extrème-Orient du 8e au 18e siècles (Volumes 1 and 2) (in French), Paris: Ernest Laroux, pp. 426–458</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Andrea | first1 = Bernadette | year = | title = Ibn Fadlan's Journey to Russia: A Tenth‐Century Traveler from Baghdad to the Volga River by Richard N.

Since the earliest of times, Central Asia has been a crossroads between different civilizations. The Silk Road connected Muslim lands with the people of Europe, India, and China.<ref>Ta'lim Primary 6 Parent and Teacher Guide (p.72) – Islamic Publications Limited for the Institute of Ismaili Studies London</ref> This crossroads position has intensified the conflict between what Andrew Phillips and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] call continuing formations of tribalism and traditionalism and intensifying processes of modernization. They argue that:

{{quote| In Central Asia the collision of modernity and tradition led all but the most deracinated of the [[intellectual]]s-[[cleric]]s to seek salvation in reconstituted variants of traditional identities rather than succumb to the modern European idea of nationalism. The inability of the elites to form a united front, as demonstrated in the numerous declarations of autonomy by different authorities during the Russian civil war, paved the way for the Soviet re-conquest of Central Asia in the early 1920s.<ref>{{Cite journal | year= 2013 | last1= Phillips | first1= Andrew | last2= James | first2= Paul | authorlink2= Paul James (academic) | title= National Identity between Tradition and Reflexive Modernisation: The Contradictions of Central Asia | url= http://www.academia.edu/2832538/National_Identity_between_Tradition_and_Reflexive_Modernisation_in_Central_Asia | journal= National Identities | volume=  3 | issue=  1 | pages= pp. 23–35}}</ref>}}

From the mid-19th century, up to the end of the 20th century, most of Central Asia was part of the [[Russian Empire]] and later the [[Soviet Union]], both being [[Slavic Peoples|Slavic]]-majority countries. As of 2011, the 5 "'stans'" are still home to about 7 million Russians and 500,000 [[Ukrainians]].<ref>[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_89.php Демоскоп Weekly – Приложение.

==Definitions==
[[Image:Central Asia borders4.png|260px|thumb|Three sets of possible boundaries for the region]]
[[File:Map of Central Asia.png|thumb|Map of Central Asia]]

The idea of Central Asia as a distinct region of the world was introduced in 1843 by the geographer [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. The borders of Central Asia are subject to multiple definitions. Historically built political geography and geoculture are two significant parameters widely used in the scholarly literature about the definitions of the Central Asia.<ref>Mehmet Akif Okur, "Classical Texts Of the Geopolitics and the "Heart Of Eurasia", Journal of Turkish World Studies, XIV/2, pp.74-75 http://tdid.ege.edu.tr/files/dergi_14_2/mehmet_akif_okur.pdf https://www.academia.edu/10035574/CLASSICAL_TEXTS_OF_THE_GEOPOLITICS_AND_THE_HEART_OF_EURASIA_Jeopoliti%C4%9Fin_Klasik_Metinleri_ve_Avrasya_n%C4%B1n_Kalbi_</ref>

The most limited definition was the official one of the [[Soviet Union]], which defined Middle Asia as consisting solely of [[Uzbekistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Tajikistan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]]. This definition was also often used outside the USSR during this period.

However, the [[Russian culture]] has two distinct terms: ''Средняя Азия'' (''Srednyaya Aziya'' or "[[Middle Asia]]", the narrower definition, which includes only those traditionally non-Slavic, Central Asian lands that were incorporated within those borders of historical Russia) and ''Центральная Азия'' (''Centralïnaya Aziya'' or "Central Asia", the wider definition, which includes Central Asian lands that have never been part of historical Russia).

Soon after independence, the leaders of the four former [[Soviet Central Asia|Soviet Central Asian Republics]] met in [[Tashkent]] and declared that the definition of Central Asia should include Kazakhstan as well as the original four included by the Soviets. Since then, this has become the most common definition of Central Asia.

The [[UNESCO]] general history of Central Asia, written just before the collapse of the USSR, defines the region based on climate and uses far larger borders. According to it, Central Asia includes [[Mongolia]], [[Tibet]], northeast [[Iran]] ([[Golestan Province|Golestan]], [[North Khorasan Province|North Khorasan]] and [[Razavi Khorasan Province|Razavi]] provinces), central-east [[Russia]] south of the [[Taiga]], large parts of [[China]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], and the former Central Asian Soviet republics (the five "Stans" of the former [[Soviet Union]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

An alternative method is to define the region based on ethnicity, and in particular, areas populated by Eastern [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]], Eastern [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], or [[Mongols|Mongolian]] peoples. These areas include [[Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]], the Turkic regions of southern [[Siberia]], the five republics, and [[Afghan Turkestan]]. Afghanistan as a whole, the northern and western areas of Pakistan and the [[Kashmir Valley]] of India may also be included. The [[Tibetans]] and [[Ladakhi]] are also included. Insofar, most of the mentioned peoples are considered the "indigenous" peoples of the vast region.

There are several places that claim to be the geographic center of Asia, for example [[Kyzyl]], the capital of [[Tuva]] in the [[Russian Federation]], and a village {{convert|200|mi|km}} north of [[Ürümqi]], the capital of the [[Xinjiang]] region of China.<ref>[http://www.confluence.org/confluence.php?visitid=12710 43°40'52"N 87°19'52"E] Degree Confluence Project.</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Bringing the sheep home, on the southern shore of Issy-Kol. (3968109583).jpg|thumb|right|On the southern shore of Issyk Kul lake, [[Issyk Kul Region]].]]

Central Asia is an extremely large region of varied geography, including high passes and [[mountain ranges|mountains]] ([[Tian Shan]]), vast [[desert]]s ([[Kara Kum]], [[Kyzyl Kum]], [[Taklamakan]]), and especially treeless, grassy [[steppe]]s.<ref>Mughal, Muhammad Aurang Zeb. 2013. "Pamir Alpine Desert and Tundra." Robert Warren Howarth (ed.), ''Biomes & Ecosystems'', Vol. 3. Ipswich, MA: Salem Press, pp. 978–980.</ref>
The vast steppe areas of Central Asia are considered together with the steppes of [[Eastern Europe]] as a homogeneous geographical zone known as the [[Eurasian Steppe]].

Much of the land of Central Asia is too dry or too rugged for farming. The [[Gobi desert]] extends from the foot of the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamirs]], 77°&nbsp;E, to the [[Great Khingan]] (Da Hinggan) Mountains, 116°–118°&nbsp;E.

Central Asia has the following geographic extremes:
* The world's northernmost [[desert]] ([[dune|sand dunes]]), at Buurug Deliin Els, [[Mongolia]], 50°18′&nbsp;N.
* The [[Northern Hemisphere|Northern Hemisphere's]] southernmost [[permafrost]], at Erdenetsogt sum, [[Mongolia]], 46°17′&nbsp;N.
* The world's shortest distance between non-frozen [[desert]] and [[permafrost]]: {{convert|770|km|mi|abbr=on}}.
* The Eurasian [[pole of inaccessibility]].

A majority of the people earn a living by herding livestock. Industrial activity centers in the region's cities.

Major rivers of the region include the [[Amu Darya]], the [[Syr Darya]], [[Irtysh]], the [[Hari River, Afghanistan|Hari River]] and the [[Morghab River (Afghanistan)|Murghab River]]. Major bodies of water include the [[Aral Sea]] and [[Lake Balkhash]], both of which are part of the huge west-central Asian [[endorheic]] basin that also includes the [[Caspian Sea]].<ref>Mughal, Muhammad Aurang Zeb. 2013. "Caspian Sea." Robert Warren Howarth (ed.), ''Biomes & Ecosystems'', vol. 2. Ipswich, MA: Salem Press, pp. 431–433.</ref>

Both of these bodies of water have shrunk significantly in recent decades due to diversion of water from rivers that feed them for irrigation and industrial purposes. Water is an extremely valuable resource in arid Central Asia and can lead to rather significant international disputes.

==Divisions==
The northern belt is part of the Eurasian Steppe. In the northwest, north of the Caspian Sea, Central Asia merges into the Russian Steppe. To the northeast, [[Dzungaria]] and the [[Tarim Basin]] may sometimes be included in Central Asia. Just west of Dzungaria, [[Zhetysu]], or Semirechye, is south of [[Lake Balkhash]] and north of the [[Tian Shan]] Mountains. [[Khorezm]] is south of the [[Aral Sea]] along the [[Amu Darya]]. Southeast of the Aral Sea, Maveranahr is between the Amu Darya and Syr Darya. [[Transoxiana]] is the land north of the middle and upper Amu Darya (Oxus). [[Bactria]] included northern Afghanistan and the upper Amu Darya. [[Sogdiana]] was north of Bactria and included the trading cities of Bukhara and Samarkhand. [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Margiana]] approximate northeastern Iran. The [[Kyzyl Kum]] Desert is northeast of the Amu Darya, and the [[Karakum Desert]] southwest of it.

===Climate===

Because Central Asia is not buffered by a large body of water, temperature fluctuations are more severe. In most of the places the climate is moderate.

According to the [[Biome#WWF system|WWF Ecozones system]], Central Asia is part of the [[Palearctic]] [[ecozone]]. The largest [[biomes]] in Central Asia are the [[temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] biome. Central Asia also contains the [[montane grasslands and shrublands]], [[deserts and xeric shrublands]] as well as [[temperate coniferous forests]] biomes.

Although, during the golden age of Orientalism the place of Central Asia in the world history was marginalized,contemporary historiography has rediscovered the "centrality" of the Central Asia.<ref>Mehmet Akif Okur, "Classical Texts Of the Geopolitics and the "Heart Of Eurasia", Journal of Turkish World Studies, XIV/2, pp.86-90 https://www.academia.edu/10035574/CLASSICAL_TEXTS_OF_THE_GEOPOLITICS_AND_THE_HEART_OF_EURASIA_Jeopoliti%C4%9Fin_Klasik_Metinleri_ve_Avrasya_n%C4%B1n_Kalbi_ http://tdid.ege.edu.tr/files/dergi_14_2/mehmet_akif_okur.pdf</ref> The history of Central Asia is defined by the area's climate and geography. The aridness of the region made [[Agriculture in Central Asia|agriculture]] difficult, and its distance from the sea cut it off from much trade. Thus, few major cities developed in the region; instead, the area was for millennia dominated by the nomadic horse peoples of the [[steppe]].

Relations between the [[Eurasian nomads|steppe nomads]] and the settled people in and around Central Asia were long marked by conflict. The nomadic lifestyle was well suited to [[war]]fare, and the steppe [[Horses in warfare|horse riders]] became some of the most militarily potent people in the world, limited only by their lack of internal unity. Any internal unity that was achieved was most probably due to the influence of the [[Silk Road]], which traveled along Central Asia. Periodically, great leaders or changing conditions would organize several tribes into one force and create an almost unstoppable power. These included the [[Huns|Hun]] invasion of Europe, the [[Five Barbarians|Wu Hu]] attacks on China and most notably the [[Timeline of Mongol conquests|Mongol conquest]] of much of [[Eurasia]].<ref>[http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Battuta's_Trip_Three.html A Land Conquered by the Mongols]</ref>

During pre-Islamic and early Islamic times, southern Central Asia was inhabited predominantly by speakers of [[Iranian languages]].<ref name="ReferenceA" /><ref>C.E.

The main migration of [[Turkic peoples]] occurred between the 5th and 10th centuries, when they spread across most of Central Asia. The [[Tang Dynasty|Tang Chinese]] were defeated by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Arabs]] at the [[battle of Talas]] in 751, marking the end of the Tang Dynasty's western expansion. The [[Tibetan Empire]] would take the chance to rule portion of Central Asia along with South Asia. During the 13th and 14th centuries, the [[Mongols]] conquered and ruled the largest contiguous empire in recorded history.  Most of Central Asia fell under the control of the [[Chagatai Khanate]]. [[File:SB - Kazakh man on horse with golden eagle.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] man on a horse with golden eagle]]
The dominance of the nomads ended in the 16th century, as [[firearm]]s allowed settled peoples to gain control of the region. [[Russia]], [[China]], and other powers expanded into the region and had captured the bulk of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century. After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], the western Central Asian regions were incorporated into the [[Soviet Union]]. The eastern part of Central Asia, known as East Turkistan or [[Xinjiang]], was [[Incorporation of Xinjiang into the People's Republic of China|incorporated]] into the [[People's Republic of China]]. Mongolia remained independent but became a Soviet [[satellite state]]. Afghanistan remained relatively independent of major influence by the USSR until the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet invasion]] of 1979.

The Soviet areas of Central Asia saw much [[Soviet infrastructure in Central Asia|industrialization and construction of infrastructure]], but also the suppression of local cultures, hundreds of thousands of deaths from failed collectivization programs, and a lasting legacy of ethnic tensions and environmental problems. Soviet authorities [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported]] millions of people, including entire nationalities,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/minorities/USSR/Deported-Nationalities.html|title=Deported Nationalities|publisher=|accessdate=14 November 2014}}</ref> from western areas of the USSR to Central Asia and [[Siberia]].<ref>[http://www.anneapplebaum.com/gulag/intro.html Anne Applebaum – Gulag: A History Intro]</ref> According to Touraj Atabaki and Sanjyot Mehendale, "From 1959 to 1970, about two million people from various parts of the Soviet Union migrated to Central Asia, of which about one million moved to Kazakhstan."<ref>"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=zwKBZmpBo5YC&pg=PA66&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Central Asia and the Caucasus: transnationalism and diaspora]''". Touraj Atabaki, Sanjyot Mehendale (2005). p.66. ISBN 0-415-33260-5</ref>

With the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], five countries gained independence. In nearly all the new states, former Communist Party officials retained power as local strongmen. None of the new republics could be considered functional democracies in the early days of independence, although in recent years [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Mongolia]] have made further progress towards more open societies, unlike [[Uzbekistan]], [[Tajikistan]], and [[Turkmenistan]], which have maintained many Soviet-style repressive tactics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eiu.com//public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=DemocracyIndex2011 |title=Democracy Index 2011 |work=Economist Intelligence Unit}}</ref>

==Culture==
[[File:Petropavl mosque.jpg|thumb|Mosque in [[Petropavl]], Kazakhstan]]
===Religions===<!-- This section is linked from [[Kashgar]] -->
[[Islam in Central Asia|Islam]] is the religion most common in the Central Asian Republics, [[Afghanistan]], Xinjiang and the peripheral western regions, such as [[Bashkortostan]]. Most Central Asian Muslims are [[Sunni]], although there are sizable [[Shia Islam|Shia]] minorities in Afghanistan and Tajikistan.

[[Buddhism]] and [[Zoroastrianism]] were the major faiths in Central Asia prior to the arrival of Islam. Zoroastrian influence is still felt today in such celebrations as [[Nowruz]], held in all five of the Central Asian states.

[[Buddhism in Central Asia|Buddhism]] was a prominent religion in Central Asia prior to the arrival of Islam, and the [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|transmission of Buddhism along the Silk Road]] eventually brought the religion to China. Amongst the [[Turkic peoples]], [[Tengriism|Tengrianism]] was the popular religion before arrival of Islam. [[Tibetan Buddhism]] is most common in Tibet, Mongolia, [[Ladakh]] and the southern Russian regions of Siberia.

The form of [[Christianity]] most practiced in the region in previous centuries was [[Nestorianism]], but now the largest denomination is the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], with many members in Kazakhstan.

The [[Bukharan Jews]] were once a sizable community in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, but nearly all have emigrated since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].

In Siberia, [[Shamanism]] is practiced, including forms of [[divination]], such as [[Kumalak]].

Contact and migration with [[Han Chinese|Han people]] from China has brought [[Confucianism]], [[Daoism]], [[Mahayana Buddhism]], and other [[Chinese Folk Religion|Chinese folk beliefs]] into the region.

===Arts===
[[File:Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi in Hazrat-e Turkestan, Kazakhstan.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi]] in Hazrat-e Turkestan, [[Kazakhstan]]. Timurid architecture consisted of [[Persian art]].]]
[[File:Sadi and the youth of kashgar Bukhara 1547.JPG|thumb|Saadi Shirazi is welcomed by a youth from [[Kashgar]] during a forum in [[Bukhara]].]]
At the crossroads of Asia, shamanistic practices live alongside [[Buddhism]]. Thus, [[Yama (East Asia)|Yama]], Lord of Death, was revered in Tibet as a spiritual guardian and judge. Mongolian Buddhism, in particular, was influenced by Tibetan Buddhism. The [[Qianlong Emperor]] of Qing China in the 18th century was Tibetan Buddhist and would sometimes travel from [[Beijing]] to other cities for personal religious worship.

Central Asia also has an indigenous form of improvisational [[oral poetry]] that is over 1000 years old. It is principally practiced in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan by ''akyns'', lyrical improvisationists. They engage in [[Freestyle battle|lyrical battles]], the ''aitysh'' or the ''alym sabak''. The tradition arose out of early bardic [[Oral history|oral historians]]. They are usually accompanied by a [[String instrument|stringed instrument]]—in Kyrgyzstan, a three-stringed [[komuz]], and in Kazakhstan, a similar two-stringed instrument, the dombra.

Photography in Central Asia began to develop after 1882, when a [[Russian Mennonite]] photographer named Wilhelm Penner moved to the [[Khanate of Khiva]] during the Mennonite migration to Central Asia led by [[Claas Epp, Jr.]]. Upon his arrival to [[Khanate of Khiva]], Penner shared his photography skills with a local student Khudaybergen Divanov, who later became the founder of the [[Uzbek photography]].<ref>Walter Ratliff, "Pilgrims on the Silk Road: A Muslim-Christian Encounter in Khiva", Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2010</ref>

Some also learn to sing the ''[[Manas (epic)|Manas]]'', Kyrgyzstan's epic poem (those who learn the ''Manas'' exclusively but do not improvise are called ''manaschis''). During Soviet rule, ''akyn'' performance was co-opted by the authorities and subsequently declined in popularity. With the fall of the Soviet Union, it has enjoyed a resurgence, although ''akyns'' still do use their art to campaign for political candidates. A 2005 ''[[The Washington Post]]'' article proposed a similarity between the improvisational art of ''akyns'' and modern [[freestyle rap]] performed in the West.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A10646-2005Mar5.html|title="In Central Asia, a Revival of an Ancient Form of Rap – Art of Ad-Libbing Oral History Draws New Devotees in Post-Communist Era" by Peter Finn, Washington Post Foreign Service, Sunday, March 6, 2005, p.

As a consequence of Russian colonization, European fine arts – painting, sculpture and graphics – have developed in Central Asia. The first years of the Soviet regime saw the appearance of modernism, which took inspiration from the Russian avant-garde movement. Until the 1980s, Central Asian arts had developed along with general tendencies of Soviet arts. In the 90's, arts of the region underwent some significant changes. Institutionally speaking, some fields of arts were regulated by the birth of the art market, some stayed as representatives of official views, while many were sponsored by international organizations. The years of 1990 – 2000 were times for the establishment of contemporary arts. In the region, many important international exhibitions are taking place, Central Asian art is represented in European and American museums, and the Central Asian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale has been organized since 2005.

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of Central Asia}}
[[Image:Central Asia Ethnic en.svg|thumb|right|250px|The ethnolinguistic patchwork of Central Asia]]
[[File:Uzbek Kids.JPG|thumb|Uzbek children in [[Samarkand]]]]
By a broad definition including Mongolia and Afghanistan, more than 90 million people live in Central Asia, about 2% of Asia's total population. Of the regions of Asia, only [[North Asia]] has fewer people. It has a population density of 9 people per km<sup>2</sup>, vastly less than the 80.5 people per km<sup>2</sup> of the continent as a whole.

===Languages===
<!-- ''[[Central Asian Languages|Main Article]]'' -->

[[Russian language|Russian]], as well as being spoken by around six million ethnic [[Russians]] and [[Ukrainians]] of Central Asia,<ref>Robert Greenall, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4420922.stm Russians left behind in Central Asia], [[BBC News]], 23 November 2005.</ref> is the de facto [[lingua franca]] throughout the former Soviet Central Asian Republics. [[Chinese language|Mandarin Chinese]] has an equally dominant presence in [[Inner Mongolia]], [[Qinghai]] and [[Xinjiang]].

The languages of the majority of the inhabitants of the former Soviet [[Central Asian Republics]] come from the [[Turkic languages|Turkic language group]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hunmagyar.org/turan/ethno.html|title=Ethnographic maps|publisher=|accessdate=14 November 2014}}</ref> [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], is mainly spoken in [[Turkmenistan]], and as a minority language in [[Afghanistan]], [[Russia]], [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]]. [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] and [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]] are related languages of the [[Kipchaks|Kypchak]] group of Turkic languages and are spoken throughout [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], and as a minority language in [[Tajikistan]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Xinjiang]]. [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] and [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] are spoken in [[Uzbekistan]], [[Tajikistan]], Kyrgyzstan, [[Afghanistan]] and [[Xinjiang]].

The [[Turkic language]]s may belong to a larger, but controversial, [[Altaic language]] family, which includes [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]]. Mongolian is spoken throughout Mongolia and into Buryatia, Kalmyk, Tuva, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang.

[[Middle Iranian languages]] were once spoken throughout Central Asia, such as the once prominent [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]], [[Khwarezmian language|Khwarezmian]], [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]] and [[Scythian language|Scythian]], which are now extinct and belonged to the [[Eastern Iranian languages|Eastern Iranian]] family. The Eastern Iranian [[Pashto language]] is still spoken in [[Afghanistan]] and northwestern [[Pakistan]]. Other minor Eastern Iranian languages such as [[Shughni language|Shughni]], [[Munji language|Munji]], [[Ishkashimi language|Ishkashimi]], [[Sarikoli language|Sarikoli]], [[Wakhi language|Wakhi]], [[Yaghnobi language|Yaghnobi]] and [[Ossetic language|Ossetic]] are also spoken at various places in Central Asia. Varieties of [[Persian language|Persian]] are also spoken as a major language in the region, locally known as [[Dari (Eastern Persian)|Dari]] (in Afghanistan), [[Tajik language|Tajik]] (in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan), and [[Bukhori dialect|Bukhori]] (by the [[Bukharan Jews]] of Central Asia).

[[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]], another Indo-European language group, which was once predominant in oases on the northern edge of the [[Tarim Basin]] of Xinjiang, is now extinct.

Other language groups include the [[Tibetic languages]], spoken by around six million people across the [[Tibetan Plateau]] and into [[Qinghai]], [[Sichuan]], [[Ladakh]] and [[Baltistan]], and the [[Nuristani languages]] of northeastern Afghanistan. [[Dardic languages]], such as [[Shina language|Shina]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], [[Pashayi language|Pashayi]] and [[Khowar language|Khowar]], are also spoken in eastern Afghanistan, the [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] of Pakistan and the [[Jammu and Kashmir|Kashmir]] state of India.

==Geostrategy==
{{Main|Geostrategy in Central Asia}}
[[File:Qianlong Horse.jpg|thumb|left|Kazakh prostrating before [[Qianlong Emperor]] of China (1757).<ref>{{citation|first=James A. |last=Millward|publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2007

Central Asia has long been a strategic location merely because of its proximity to several great powers on the Eurasian landmass. The region itself never held a dominant stationary population nor was able to make use of natural resources. Thus, it has rarely throughout history become the seat of power for an empire or influential state. Central Asia has been divided, redivided, conquered out of existence, and fragmented time and time again. Central Asia has served more as the battleground for outside powers than as a power in its own right.

Central Asia had both the advantage and disadvantage of a central location between four historical seats of power. From its central location, it has access to trade routes to and from all the regional powers. On the other hand, it has been continuously vulnerable to attack from all sides throughout its history, resulting in political fragmentation or outright power vacuum, as it is successively dominated.
[[Image:Great Game cartoon from 1878.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Political cartoon from the period of the [[The Great Game|Great Game]] showing the Afghan Amir Sher Ali with his "friends" Imperial Russia and the United Kingdom (1878)]]
* To the North, the steppe allowed for rapid mobility, first for nomadic horseback warriors like the Huns and Mongols, and later for Russian traders, eventually supported by railroads. As the Russian Empire expanded to the East, it would also push down into Central Asia towards the sea, in a search for warm water ports. The Soviet bloc would reinforce dominance from the North and attempt to project power as far south as Afghanistan.
* To the East, the demographic and cultural weight of Chinese empires continually pushed outward into Central Asia since the [[Silk road]] period of [[Han Dynasty]]. However, with the Sino-Soviet split and collapse of Soviet Union, China would project its soft power into Central Asia, most notably in the case of Afghanistan, to counter Russian dominance of the region.
* To the Southeast, the demographic and cultural influence of India was felt in Central Asia, notably in Tibet, the [[Hindu Kush]], and slightly beyond. From its base in India, the [[British Empire]] competed with the Russian Empire for influence in the region in the 19th and 20th centuries.
* To the Southwest, Western Asian powers have expanded into the southern areas of Central Asia (usually Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan). Several Persian empires would conquer and reconquer parts of Central Asia; Alexander the Great's Hellenic empire would extend into Central Asia; two Islamic empires would exert substantial influence throughout the region; and the modern state of Iran has projected influence throughout the region as well. Turkey, through a common [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] nation identity, has gradually increased its ties and influence as well in the region. Furthermore, all Central Asian Turkic-speaking states are together with Turkey part of the [[Turkic Council]].

In the post–Cold War era, Central Asia is an ethnic cauldron, prone to instability and conflicts, without a sense of national identity, but rather a mess of historical cultural influences, tribal and clan loyalties, and religious fervor. Projecting influence into the area is no longer just Russia, but also Turkey, Iran, China, Pakistan, India and the United States:
* Russia continues to dominate political decision-making throughout the former SSRs; although, as other countries move into the area, Russia's influence has begun to wane though Russia still maintains military bases in [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Tajikistan]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Why Russia Will Send More Troops to Central Asia|url = https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/why-russia-will-send-more-troops-central-asia|website = Stratfor|accessdate = 2015-09-26}}</ref>
* The United States, with its military involvement in the region and oil diplomacy, is also significantly involved in the region's politics. The United States and other NATO members are the main contributors to the [[International Security Assistance Force]] in Afghanistan and also exert considerable influence in other Central Asian nations.
* China has security ties with Central Asian states through the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]], and conducts energy trade bilaterally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/10883/shanghai_cooperation_organization.html|title=The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation|first=Andrew|last=Scheineson|date=24 March 2009|accessdate=24 September 2010|work=Backgrounder|publisher=[[Council on Foreign Relations]]}}</ref>

* Turkey also exerts considerable influence in the region on account of its ethnic and linguistic ties with the Turkic peoples of Central Asia and its involvement in the [[Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline|Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline]]. Political and economic relations are growing rapidly (e.g., Turkey recently eliminated visa requirements for citizens of the Central Asian Turkic republics).
* Iran, the seat of historical empires that controlled parts of Central Asia, has historical and cultural links to the region and is vying to construct an oil pipeline from the Caspian Sea to the Persian Gulf.
* [[Pakistan]], a nuclear-armed Islamic state, has a history of political relations with neighboring Afghanistan and is termed capable of exercising influence. For some Central Asian nations, the shortest route to the ocean lies through Pakistan. Pakistan seeks [[natural gas]] from Central Asia and supports the development of pipelines from its countries. According to an independent study, [[Turkmenistan]] is supposed to be the '''fifth''' largest natural gas field in the world.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Turkmenistan Gas Field Is One of World's Largest|url = http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122409510811337137|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|access-date = 2015-09-26|issn = 0099-9660|first = Guy|last = Chazan}}</ref> The mountain ranges and areas in northern Pakistan lie on the fringes of greater Central Asia; the [[Gilgit–Baltistan]] region of Pakistan lies adjacent to Tajikistan, separated only by the narrow Afghan [[Wakhan Corridor]]. Being located on the northwest of South Asia, the area forming modern-day Pakistan maintained extensive historical and cultural links with the central Asian region.

Russian historian [[Lev Gumilev]] wrote that [[Xiongnu]], [[Mongols]] ([[Mongol Empire]], [[Zunghar Khanate]]) and [[Turkic peoples]] ([[Turkic Khaganate]], [[Uyghur Khaganate]])  played a role to stop Chinese [[List of endangered languages in China|aggression]] [[Ethnic groups in Chinese history|to the north]]. The Turkic Khaganate had special policy against Chinese assimilation policy.<ref>[http://gumilevica.kulichki.net/articles/Article16.htm ЛЮДИ И ПРИРОДА ВЕЛИКОЙ СТЕПИ] '''(Russian)'''</ref> Another interesting theoretical analysis on the historical-geopolitics of the Central Asia was made through the reinterpretation of Orkhun Inscripts.<ref>Mehmet Akif Okur, "Classical Texts Of the Geopolitics and the "Heart Of Eurasia", Journal of Turkish World Studies, XIV/2, pp.91-100 https://www.academia.edu/10035574/CLASSICAL_TEXTS_OF_THE_GEOPOLITICS_AND_THE_HEART_OF_EURASIA_Jeopoliti%C4%9Fin_Klasik_Metinleri_ve_Avrasya_n%C4%B1n_Kalbi_ http://tdid.ege.edu.tr/files/dergi_14_2/mehmet_akif_okur.pdf</ref>

The region, along with Russia, is also part of "the great pivot" as per the [[Heartland Theory]] of [[Halford Mackinder]], which says that the power which controls Central Asia—richly endowed with natural resources—shall ultimately be the "empire of the world".<ref>For an analysis of Mackinder's approach from the perspective of "Critical Geopolitics" look: Mehmet Akif Okur, "Classical Texts Of the Geopolitics and the "Heart Of Eurasia", Journal of Turkish World Studies, XIV/2, pp.76-80 https://www.academia.edu/10035574/CLASSICAL_TEXTS_OF_THE_GEOPOLITICS_AND_THE_HEART_OF_EURASIA_Jeopoliti%C4%9Fin_Klasik_Metinleri_ve_Avrasya_n%C4%B1n_Kalbi_ http://tdid.ege.edu.tr/files/dergi_14_2/mehmet_akif_okur.pdf</ref>

===War on Terror===
[[File:Islam karimov.jpg|thumb|180px|Uzbekistan's authoritarian leader [[Islam Karimov]] in [[the Pentagon]], March 2002]]
In the context of the United States' [[War on Terror]], Central Asia has once again become the center of geostrategic calculations. Pakistan's status has been upgraded by the U.S. government to [[Major non-NATO ally]] because of its central role in serving as a staging point for the invasion of Afghanistan, providing intelligence on Al-Qaeda operations in the region, and leading the hunt on Osama bin Laden.

Afghanistan, which had served as a haven and source of support for Al-Qaeda under the protection of Mullah Omar and the [[Taliban]], was the target of a [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|U.S. invasion]] in 2001 and ongoing reconstruction and drug-eradication efforts. U.S. military bases have also been established in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, causing both Russia and the People's Republic of China to voice their concern over a permanent U.S. military presence in the region.

Western governments have accused Russia, China and the former Soviet republics of justifying the suppression of separatist movements, and the associated ethnics and religion with the War on Terror.

| The capital and second largest city in Kazakhstan. After Kazakhstan gained its independence in 1991, the city and the region were renamed Aqmola. The name was often translated as "White Tombstone", but actually means "Holy Place" or "Holy Shrine". The "White Tombstone" literal translation was too appropriate for many visitors to escape notice in almost all guide books and travel accounts. In 1994, the city was designated as the future capital of the newly independent country and again renamed to the present Astana after the capital was officially moved from [[Almaty]] in 1997.

It is not far from the site of [[Nisa (village)|Nisa]], the ancient capital of the [[Parthia]]ns, and it grew on the ruins of the [[Silk Road]] city of Konjikala, which was first mentioned as a wine-producing village in the 2nd century BCE and was leveled by an earthquake in the 1st century BCE (a precursor of the 1948 Ashgabat earthquake). Konjikala was rebuilt because of its advantageous location on the Silk Road, and it flourished until its destruction by Mongols in the 13th century CE. After that, it survived as a small village until the Russians took over in the 19th century.<ref>[http://www.geographicbureau.com/trips/central_asia/turkmenistan/info/brief_description_of_the_main_s.jdx Konjikala]: the Silk Road precursor of Ashgabat</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=UGanxmJgQNIC&pg=PA40&lpg=PA40&dq=konjikala&source=bl&ots=76-v-N-YOn&sig=_SxnsotPclSEHqnFjepj4qQhlzc&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result#PPA41,M1 Konjikala], in: MaryLee Knowlton, ''Turkmenistan'', Marshall Cavendish, 2006, pp. 40–41, ISBN 0-7614-2014-2, ISBN 978-0-7614-2014-9 (viewable on [[Google Books]]).</ref>
