'''Cross-country skiing''' is travel on [[skis]] over snow-covered terrain, whereby skiers rely on their own [[Terrestrial locomotion|locomotion]] rather than on [[ski lift]]s or other forms of assistance. Modern cross-country skiing shares self-locomotion as a core attribute with the original form of skiing from which all skiing disciplines evolved, including [[alpine skiing]], [[ski jumping]] and [[telemark skiing]]. It is widely practised as a sport and recreational activity, however some still use it as a means of transportation. Variants of cross-country skiing are adapted to a range of terrain which spans unimproved, sometimes mountainous terrain to groomed courses that are specifically designed for the sport. Skiers propel themselves either by striding forward (classic style) or side-to-side in a skating motion (skate skiing), aided by arms pushing on [[ski poles]] against the snow. It is practised in regions with snow-covered landscapes, including [[Northern Europe]], [[Canada]], [[Russia]] and regions in the [[United States]].
[[Cross-country skiing (sport)|Competitive cross-country skiing]] is one of the [[Nordic skiing]] sports. Cross-country skiing and [[marksmanship|rifle marksmanship]] are the two components of [[biathlon]], [[ski-orienteering]] is a form of cross-country skiing, which includes map navigation along snow trails and tracks.<ref name=Idrettsleksikon>{{cite book |title= Kunnskapsforlagets idrettsleksikon |trans-title= Encyclopedia of Sports |language= no |location=Oslo |publisher= Kunnskapsforlaget |year= 1990 |isbn= 82-573-0408-5}}</ref>

Norwegian skiing regiments organized military skiing contests in the 18th century, divided in four classes: shooting at a target while skiing at "top speed," downhill racing among trees, downhill racing on large slopes without falling, and "long racing" on "flat ground."<ref name=Bergsland/> An early record of a public ski competition occurred in [[Tromsø]], 1843. In Norwegian, ''langrenn'' refers to "competitive skiing where the goal is to complete a specific distance in groomed tracks in the shortest possible time." In Norway,  ''ski touring competitions'' ({{lang-no|turrenn}}) are long-distance cross-country competitions open to the public, competition is usually within age intervals.<ref name=Idrettsleksikon/>

A new technique, [[skate skiing]], was experimented with early in the 20th Century, but was not widely adopted until the 1980s. [[Johan Grøttumsbråten]] used the skating technique at the [[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1931|1931 World Championship]] in Oberhof, one of the earliest recorded use of skating in competitive cross-country skiing.<ref name="Olav 1993">{{cite book |last= Bø |first= Olav |title= Skiing throughout history |others= W. Edson Richmond (trans.) |location= Oslo |publisher= Samlaget |year= 1993}}</ref> This technique was later used in ski orienteering in the 1960s on roads and other firm surfaces. It became widespread during the 1980s after the success of [[Bill Koch (skier)|Bill Koch]] ([[United States|USA]]) in [[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1982|1982 Cross-country Skiing Championships]] drew more attention to the skating style. Norwegian skier [[Ove Aunli]] started using the technique in 1984, when he found it to be much faster than classic style.<ref>{{cite web | last = Bengtsson | first = Bengt Erik | title = Cross-country skating: How it started | work = Skiing History Magazine

===Terminology===
[[File:NansenJohansen.jpg|thumb|right|Arctic travelers, [[Fridtjov Nansen]] and [[Hjalmar Johansen]] at the camp of [[Frederick George Jackson|Frederick Jackson]] on [[Northbrook Island]].]]
While the noun ''ski'' originates from the [[Norwegian language]], unlike the English ''skiing'' there is no corresponding verb in Norwegian. [[Fridtjov Nansen]], for instance, describes the crossing of Greenland as ''På ski over Grønland'', literally "On skis across Greenland",<ref>{{cite book |last= Nansen |first= Fridtjof |title= Paa ski over Grønland. En skildring af Den norske Grønlands-ekspedition 1888-89 |location= Kristiania |publisher= Aschehoug}}</ref> while the English edition of the report was titled, ''The first crossing of Greenland''. Nansen referred to the activity of traversing snow on skis as {{lang-no|skilöbning}} (he used the term also in the English translation), which may be translated as ''ski running''. Nansen used ''skilöbning'', regarding all forms of skiing, but noted that ski jumping is purely a competitive sport and not for amateurs. He further noted that in some competitions the skier "is also required to show his skill in turning his ski to one side or the other within given marks" at full speed on a steep hill. Nansen regarded these forms (i.e., jumping and slalom) as "special arts", and believed that the most important branch of skiing was travel "in an ordinary way across the country."<ref>{{cite book |last= Nansen |first= Fridtjof |title= The first crossing of Greenland |location= London |publisher= Longmans, Green and Co. |year= 1890}}</ref> In Germany, Nansen's Greenland report was published as ''Auf Schneeschuhen durch Grönland'' (literally "On snowshoes through Greenland").<ref>{{cite book |last= Nansen |first= Fridtjov |title= Auf Schneeschuhen durch Grönland |publisher= autorisirte deutsche Uebersetzung von M. Mann |location= Hamburg |year= 1891}}</ref> The German term, ''Schneeschuh'', was supplanted by the borrowed Norwegian word, ''Ski'', in late 19th century.<ref name=Vaage/> The Norwegian encyclopedia of sports also uses the term, ''skiløping'', (literally "ski running") for all forms of skiing.<ref name=Idrettsleksikon/> Around 1900 the word ''Skilaufen'' was used in German in the same sense as {{lang-no|skiløping}}.<ref name=Vaage>{{cite book |last= Vaage |first= Jacob |title= Norske ski erobrer verden |location= Oslo |publisher= Gyldendal |year= 1952}}</ref> In modern Norwegian, self-propelled skiing is often referred to as ''gå på ski'' (literally "go on skis") whereas alpine skiing is referred to as ''stå på ski'' (literally ''ski standing'', but also translated as ''skiing'').<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nob-ordbok.uio.no |title= Nynorskordboka og Bokmålsordboka |publisher= Språkrådet (Language Council of Norway) and University of Oslo |type= database search |accessdate= 2014-10-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Follestad |first= Sverre |title= Engelske idiomer.

==Recreation==
[[File:Påske.jpg|thumb|right|Ski touring in untracked terrain.]]
Recreational cross-country skiing includes [[ski touring]] and groomed-trail skiing, typically at resorts or in parklands. It is an accessible form of recreation for persons with [[Ski for Light|vision and mobility impairments]]. A related form of recreation is [[Skijoring#Dog skijoring|dog skijoring]]—a winter sport where a cross-country skier is assisted by one or more dogs.

===Ski touring===
[[Ski touring]] is done off-[[piste]] and outside of [[ski resorts]]. Tours may extend over multiple days. Typically, [[skis]], [[ski bindings|bindings]], and [[ski boot|boots]] allow for free movement of the heel to enable a walking pace, as with [[Nordic skiing|Nordic disciplines]] and unlike [[Alpine skiing]].<ref name=branigan>{{cite book|title=A Complete Guide to Alpine Ski Touring Ski Mountaineering and Nordic Ski Touring Including Useful Information for Off Piste Skiers and Snow Boarders|date=2014|publisher=Authorhouse|isbn=978-1491888087|page=xvii}}</ref> Ski touring's subgenre [[ski mountaineering]] involves independently navigating and route finding through potential [[avalanche]] terrain, and often requires familiarity with [[meteorology]] along with skiing skills. Ski touring can also be faster and easier than summer [[hiking]] in some terrain allowing for traverses and ascents that would be harder in the summer. Skis can also be used to access backcountry alpine climbing routes when snow is off the technical route, but still covers the hiking trail.In some countries, organizations maintain a network of huts for use by cross-country skiers in wintertime. For example, the [[Norwegian Trekking Association]] maintains over 400 huts stretching across thousands of kilometres of trails which are used by hikers in the summer and by skiers in the winter.<ref name=volken>{{cite book|last1=Volken|first1=Martin|last2=Schnell|first2=Scott|last3=Wheeler|first3=Margaret|title=Backcountry Skiing: Skills for Ski Touring and Ski Mountaineering|date=2007|publisher=Mountaineers Books|isbn=978-1594850387|page=12|url=http://www.amazon.com/reader/1594850380/ref=rdr_sb_li_hist_3&state=01111|accessdate=2014-07-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web

===Groomed-trail skiing===
{{main|Cross-country skiing trail}}
[[File:Loipe am Mordfleck.jpg|thumb|right|Groomed ski trails for cross-country in [[Thuringia]], track-set for classic skiing at the sides and groomed for skate skiing in the center.]]
[[snow grooming|Groomed]] trail skiing occurs at facilities, such as [[Royal Gorge Cross Country Ski Resort]] and [[Gatineau Park]], [[Quebec]], where trails are laid out and groomed for both classic and skate-skiing. Such grooming and track setting (for classic technique) requires specialized equipment and techniques that adapt to the condition of the snow. Trail preparation employs snow machines that tow snow compaction, texturing and track-setting devices. Groomers must adapt such equipment to the condition of the snow—crystal structure, temperature, degree of compaction, moisture content, etc. Depending on the initial condition of the snow, grooming may achieve an increase in density for new-fallen snow or a decrease in density for icy or compacted snow. Cross-country ski facilities may incorporate a course design that meets [[homologation]] standards for such organizations as the International Olympic Committee, the International Ski Federation or national standards. Standards address course distances, degree of difficulty with maximums in elevation difference and steepness—both up and downhill, plus other factors.<ref name=CanadianManual>{{cite web | last = Thomson | first = Jim | title = A Technical Manual for the Organization of Cross Country Ski Events | work = Officials’ Manual Version 3.4 | publisher = Cross Country Canada | date = November 2009 | url = http://www.cccski.com/getmedia/79317bda-f719-4390-a8cd-a7636ef63ba9/CompetitionOfficialsHandbookv34.pdf.aspx | accessdate = 2014-10-21 }}</ref>

==Competition==
{{Main|Cross-country skiing (sport)}}
Cross-country ski competition encompasses a variety of formats for races over courses of varying lengths according to rules sanctioned by the [[International Ski Federation]] (FIS) and by national organizations, such as the [[U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association]]<ref>{{cite web | last = Directors | title = Cross Country Sport Committee | work = USSA Programs | publisher = U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association (USSA) | date = 2012 | url = http://ussa.org/ussa/cross-country-sport-committee | accessdate = 2014-11-04}}</ref> and Cross Country Ski Canada.<ref>{{cite web | last = Directors | title = Rules and Regulations | publisher = Cross Country Ski Canada | date = 2012 | url = http://www.cccski.com/Events/Rules-and-Regulations.aspx | accessdate = 2014-11-04}}</ref> It also encompasses cross-country [[ski marathon]] events, sanctioned by the [[Worldloppet Ski Federation]], cross-country [[ski orienteering]] events, sanctioned by the [[International Orienteering Federation]], and Paralympic cross-country skiing, sanctioned by the [[International Paralympic Committee]].

[[Biathlon]] combines cross-country skiing and [[shooting sport|rifle shooting]]. Depending on the shooting performance, extra distance or time is added to the contestant's total running distance/time. For each shooting round, the biathlete must hit five targets; the skier receives a penalty for each missed target, which varies according to the competition rules.<ref>{{cite web | last = IBU Congress | title = IBU Event and Competition Rules | work = Rules adopted by the 2012 10th Regular IBU Congress | publisher = International Biathlon Union | date = 2012 | url = http://www.biathlonworld.com/media/download/Handbook_event_and_competition_rules.pdf| accessdate = 2015-06-29 }}</ref>

[[Ski orienteering]] is a form of cross-country skiing competition that requires navigation in a landscape, making optimal route choices at racing speeds. Standard [[orienteering map]]s are used, but with special green overprinting of trails and tracks to indicate their [[Navigate|navigability]] in [[snow]]; other symbols indicate whether any roads are snow-covered or clear. Standard skate-skiing equipment is used, along with a map holder attached to the chest. It is one of the four [[orienteering]] disciplines [[Sport governing body|recognized]] by the [[International Orienteering Federation]]. Upper body strength is especially important because of frequent double poling along narrow snow trails.<ref>{{cite web

==Techniques==
[[File:Rotchev-veerpalu-2006.jpg|Skiers employing step turns, while descending during a 2006 FIS World Cup Cross Country competition in Otepää, [[Estonia]].|thumb|right]]
Cross-country skiing has two basic propulsion techniques, which apply to different surfaces: classic (undisturbed snow and tracked snow) and skate skiing (firm, smooth snow surfaces). The classic technique relies on a wax or texture on the ski bottom under the foot for [[Traction (engineering)|traction]] on the snow to allow the skier to slide the other ski forward in virgin or tracked snow. With the skate skiing technique a skier slides on alternating skis on a firm snow surface at an angle from each other in a manner similar to ice skating. Both techniques employ poles with baskets that allow the arms to participate in the propulsion. Specialized equipment is adapted to each technique and each type of terrain.<ref name="Rees"/> A variety of turns are used, when descending.

Both poles can be used simultaneously ("double-poling"), or alternating, in classic the alternating technique is most common (the "diagonal stride") while in the skating technique double poles are more common.<ref name="Rees"/><ref name=pole/>

===Classic===
The classic style is often used on prepared trails (pistes) that have pairs of parallel grooves (tracks) cut into the snow. It is also the most usual technique where no tracks have been prepared. With this technique, each ski is pushed forward from the other stationary ski in a striding and gliding motion, alternating foot to foot. With the "diagonal stride" variant the poles are planted alternately on the opposite side of the forward-striding foot; with the "kick-double-pole" variant the poles are planted simultaneously with every other stride. At times, especially with gentle descents, double poling is the sole means of propulsion.<ref name="Rees">{{Cite book | edition = 3d | publisher = Copp C. Pitman | isbn = 978-0-7730-4045-8 | oclc = 300405310 | last = Rees | first = David| title = Cross-country skiing: touring and competition | location = Toronto | year = 1981}}</ref> On uphill terrain, techniques include the "side step" for steep slopes, moving the skis perpendicular to the fall line, the "herringbone" for moderate slopes, where the skier takes alternating steps with the skis splayed outwards, and, for gentle slopes, the skier uses the diagonal technique with shorter strides and greater arm force on the poles.<ref name="Rees"/>

===Skate skiing===
With skate skiing, the skier provides propulsion on a smooth, firm snow surface by pushing alternating skis away from one another at an angle, in a manner similar to [[ice skating]]. Skate-skiing usually involves a coordinated use of poles and the upper body to add impetus, sometimes with a double pole plant each time the ski is extended on a temporarily "dominant" side ("V1") or with a double pole plant each time the ski is extended on either side ("V2"). Skiers climb hills, using these techniques, by widening the angle of the "V" and by making more frequent, shorter strides and more forceful use of poles.<ref>{{cite web | last = Hindman | first = Steve | title = Technique & Training: Three steps to skating | work = Cross Country Skier Magazine

==Equipment==
Equipment comprises skis, poles, boots and bindings; these vary according to:
* Technique, classic vs skate
* Terrain, which may vary from groomed trails to wilderness
* Performance level, from recreational use to competition at the elite level<ref name="Rees"/>

===Skis===
{{main|Ski}}

Skis used in cross-country are lighter and narrower than those used in [[alpine skiing]]. Ski bottoms are designed to provide a gliding surface and, for classic skis, a traction zone under foot. The base of the gliding surface is a plastic material that is designed both to minimize friction and, in many cases, to accept waxes.<ref name=oly>{{cite web|title=Cross Country Skiing Equipment and History|url=http://www.olympic.org/cross-country-skiing-equipment-and-history?tab=history|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=2014-10-11}}</ref> Glide wax may be used on the tails and tips of classic skis and across the length of skate skis.<ref name="Rees"/><ref name=mec>{{cite web|title=Cross Country Skis (Nordic Skis) |url=http://www.mec.ca/AST/ContentPrimary/Learn/Snowsports/SkisBootsAndSkins/NordicSkis.jsp|website=MEC|publisher=Mountain Equipment Coop|accessdate=2014-10-19}}</ref> Each type of ski is sized and designed differently:
* Classic skis: Designed for skiing in tracks. For adult skiers (between 155&nbsp;cm/50&nbsp;kg and 185&nbsp;cm/75&nbsp;kg), recommended lengths are between 180 to 210 centimetres (approximately 115% of the skier's height). Traction comes from a “kick zone” underfoot that when bearing the skier’s weight engages either a textured gripping surface or a kick wax. When the skier’s weight is distributed on both skis, the ski’s [[wikt:camber|camber]] diminishes the pressure of the kick zone on the snow and promotes bearing on the remaining area of the ski, which has the best glide. Accordingly, these skis are classified as "waxable" or "waxless." Recreational waxless skis generally require little attention and are adapted for casual use. Waxable skis, if prepared correctly, provide better grip and glide.<ref name="Rees"/><ref name="Bergin">{{cite web|url = http://www.snocountry.com/article.php/20041227133240622 |title = Back to Basics: A Quick Look at Paste Waxes, Waxless Ski Preparation and Kick Waxing|accessdate = 2009-01-25|last = Bergin|first = Ron |authorlink = |year = 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070402051820/http://www.snocountry.com/article.php/20041227133240622 |archivedate = 2 April 2007}}</ref><ref name="REIAdvice">{{cite web|url = http://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/crosscountry-ski-touring-gear.html|title = Cross-Country Ski Gear: How to Choose|accessdate = 2015-06-29|last = Recreational Equipment, Inc.|authorlink = |year = 2015}}</ref>
* Skate skis: Designed for skiing on groomed surfaces. Recommended lengths are between 170 to 200 centimetres (up to 110% of the skier's height) for adult skiers.  The entire bottom of skate skis are prepared for maximum glide. Traction comes from the skier pushing away from the edge of the previous ski onto the next ski.<ref name="Rees"/>
* Back country skis: Designed for ski touring on natural snow conditions. Recommended lengths are between 150 to 195 centimeters for adult skiers.  Traction may come from a textured or waxed kick zone, as with classic skis, or from [[ski skins]], which are applied to the ski bottom for long, steep ascents and have hairs or mechanical texture that prevents sliding backwards. Touring skis are typically heavier, shorter, and wider than classic and skate skis; they have metal edges for better grip on hard snow. Their greater [[sidecut]] helps carving turns.<ref>{{cite web | last = Editors | title = How to choose the right ski length | work = Back Country | date = 2 September 2013

====Gliding surface====
Glide waxes enhance the speed of the gliding surface, and are applied by ironing them onto the ski and then polishing the ski bottom.  Three classes of glide wax are available, depending on the level of desired performance with higher performance coming at higher cost.  Hydrocarbon glide waxes, based on [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]] are common for recreational use.  Race waxes comprise a combination of fluorinated hydrocarbon waxes and fluorocarbon overlays.<ref>{{cite web | last = Harvey | first = Ian | title = Information on Fluorinated Waxes | work = A Michigan Nordic Ski Racer | date = 9 February 2011 | url = http://www.nordicskiracer.com/news.asp?NewsID=5429 | accessdate = 2014-10-21}}</ref>  Fluorocarbons decrease surface tension and surface area of the water between the ski and the snow, increasing speed and glide of the ski under specific conditions. Either combined with the wax or applied after in a spray, powder, or block form, fluorocarbons significantly improve the glide of the ski and are widely used in cross-country ski races.<ref>{{cite web | last = Swix | title = Information on Fluorinated Waxes | work = A Michigan Nordic Ski Racer | date = 22 February 2011

====Traction surface====
Skis designed for classic technique, both in track and in virgin snow, rely on a traction zone, called the "kick zone," underfoot. This comes either from a texture designed to slide forward, but not backwards, from applied devices, e.g. climbing skins, or from kick waxes. Kick waxes are classified according to their hardness: harder waxes are for colder and newer snow. An incorrect choice of kick wax for the snow conditions encountered may cause ski slippage (wax too hard for the conditions) or snow sticking to the kick zone (wax too soft for the conditions).<ref name="Rees"/> Kick waxes generate grip by interacting with snow crystals, which vary with temperature, age and compaction.<ref name="Rees"/> Hard kick waxes don't work well for snow which has metamorphosed to having coarse grains, whether icy or wet. In these conditions, skiers opt for a stickier substance, called ''klister''.<ref name="Rees"/>

===Boots and bindings===
[[File:Cross-country ski boot and binding system--Classic.jpg|thumb|Cross-country ski boot and binding system for classic skiing. The skier clicks the toe of the boot into the binding and releases with the button in front of the boot.]]
[[Ski boots]] are attached to the ski only at the toe, leaving the heel free. Depending on application, boots may be lightweight (performance skiing) or heavier and more supportive (back-country skiing).<ref name=Boot-binding/>

[[Nordic Integrated System|Bindings]] connect the boot to the ski. There are three primary groups of [[Nordic Integrated System|binding systems]] used in cross-country skiing (in descending order of importance):<ref name=Boot-binding>{{cite web | last = Dzierzak | first = Lou | title = Cross country skiers venture off track | department = On the Wild Side | work = Cross Country Skier Magazine | date = November 2008 | url = http://www.crosscountryskier.com/magazine/08_nov/wild_side.htm | accessdate = 2014-10-21}}</ref>
* Standardized system: Boots and bindings have an integrated connection, typically a bar across the front end of the sole of the boot, and platform on which the boot rests. Two families of standards prevail: NNN (New Nordic Norm) and SNS (Salomon Nordic System) Profil. Both systems have variants for skiing on groomed surfaces and in back country. These systems are the most common type of binding.
* Three-pin: The boot-gripping system comprises three pins that correspond to three holes in the sole of the boot's toe, used primarily for back-country skiing.
* Cable: A cable secures the free-moving heel and keeps the toe of the boot pushed into a boot-gripping section, used primarily for back-country and telemark skiing.

===Poles===
{{main|Ski pole}}
Ski poles are used for balance and propulsion. Modern cross-country ski poles are made from [[aluminium]], [[fibreglass-reinforced plastic]], or [[carbon fibre]], depending on weight, cost and performance parameters. Formerly they were made of [[bamboo]].  They feature a foot (called a basket) near the end of the shaft that provides a pushing platform, as it makes contact with the snow. Baskets vary in size, according to the expected softness/firmness of the snow. Racing poles feature smaller, lighter baskets than recreational poles. Poles designed for skating are longer than those designed for classic skiing.<ref name=pole>{{cite web | last = Hindman | first = Steve | title = Poling Principles | department = Training & Technique | work = Cross Country Skier | date = February 2004 | url = http://www.crosscountryskier.com/training_technique_feb_2004.html | accessdate = 2014-11-18}}</ref>
