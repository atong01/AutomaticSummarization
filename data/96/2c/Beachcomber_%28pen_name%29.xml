Morton</target></link>, as authors of the<space/><italics><link><target>Daily Express</target></link></italics><space/>column &quot;By the Way&quot; in the period 19191975.

It was then passed to Morton during 1924, though it is likely there was a period when they overlapped. Morton wrote the column until 1975; it was revived in January 1996<space/><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite news</target><arg name="title">Beachcomber lives again</arg><arg name="date">5 January 1996</arg><arg name="work">Daily Express</arg><arg name="page">2</arg><arg name="accessdate">21 January 2011</arg></template></extension><space/>and continues today, written by<space/><link><target>William Hartston</target></link>. The column is unsigned except by &quot;Beachcomber&quot; and it was not publicly known that Morton or Wyndham-Lewis wrote it until the 1930s. The name is mainly associated with Morton, who has been credited as an influence by<space/><link><target>Spike Milligan</target></link><space/>amongst others. Morton introduced the recurring characters and continuing stories that were a major feature of the column during his 51-year run.</paragraph><paragraph>The format of the column was a random assortment of small paragraphs which were otherwise unconnected. These could be anything, such as:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>court reports, often involving Twelve Red-Bearded Dwarfs before Mr Justice Cocklecarrot.</listitem><listitem>angry exchanges of letters between characters such as Florence McGurgle and her dissatisfied boarders.</listitem><listitem>interruptions from &quot;Prodnose&quot;, representing the public, who would then be roundly cursed by the author and kicked out.</listitem><listitem>installments of serials that could stop, restart from earlier, be abandoned altogether or change direction abruptly without warning.</listitem><listitem>parodies of poetry or drama, particularly of the extremely &quot;literary&quot; type such as<space/><link><target>Ibsen</target></link>.</listitem><listitem>unlikely headlines, such as &quot;SIXTY HORSES WEDGED IN A CHIMNEY&quot;, for which the copy in its entirety was &quot;The story to fit this sensational headline has not turned up yet.&quot;</listitem><listitem>news reports from around the country.</listitem><listitem>or just anything that the author thought funny at the time.</listitem></list><paragraph>Morton's other interest,<space/><link><target>France</target></link>, was occasionally represented by epic tales of his rambling walks through the French countryside. These were not intended as humour.</paragraph><paragraph>&quot;By the Way&quot; was popular with the readership, and of course, one of the reasons it lasted so long. Its style and randomness could be off-putting, however, and it is safe to say the humour could be something of an acquired taste. Oddly, one of the column's greatest opponents was the<space/><italics>Express</italics><space/>newspaper's owner,<space/><link><target>Lord Beaverbrook</target></link>, who had to keep being assured the column was indeed funny. A prominent critic was<space/><link><target>George Orwell</target></link>, who frequently referred to him in his essays and diaries as &quot;A Catholic Apologist&quot; and accused him of being &quot;silly-clever&quot;, in line with his criticisms of<space/><link><target>G. K. Chesterton</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Hilaire Belloc</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Ronald Knox</target></link><space/>and Wyndham-Lewis.<space/></paragraph><paragraph>But<space/><italics>By the Way</italics><space/>was one of the few features kept continuously running in the often seriously reduced<space/><italics>Daily Express</italics><space/>throughout<space/><link><target>World War II</target></link>, when Morton's lampooning of<space/><link><target>Hitler</target></link>, including the British invention of bracerot to make the Nazi's trousers fall down at inopportune moments, was regarded as valuable for morale.</paragraph><paragraph>The column appeared daily until 1965 when it was changed to weekly. It was cancelled in 1975 and revived as a daily piece in the early 1990s. It continues to the present day in much the same format, but is now entitled &quot;Beachcomber&quot;, not &quot;By the Way&quot;.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Recurrent characters</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem>Mr. Justice Cocklecarrot: well-meaning but ineffectual<space/><link><target>High Court judge</target></link>, plagued by litigation involving the<space/><bold>twelve red-bearded dwarfs</bold>.
