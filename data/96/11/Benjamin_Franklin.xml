The<space/><italics>Gazette</italics><space/>gave Franklin a forum for agitation about a variety of local reforms and initiatives through printed essays and observations. Over time, his commentary, and his adroit cultivation of a positive image as an industrious and intellectual young man, earned him a great deal of social respect.

Frasca argues he saw this as a service to God, because he understood moral virtue in terms of actions, thus, doing good provides a service to God. Despite his own moral lapses, Franklin saw himself as uniquely qualified to instruct Americans in morality. He tried to influence American moral life through construction of a printing network based on a chain of partnerships from the Carolinas to New England. Franklin thereby invented the first newspaper chain. It was more than a business venture, for like many publishers since, he believed that the press had a public-service duty.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite journal</target><arg name="last1"><space/>Frasca<space/></arg><arg name="first1"><space/>Ralph<space/></arg><arg name="year"><space/>1997<space/></arg><arg name="title"><space/>Benjamin Franklin's Journalism<space/></arg><arg name="url"><space/></arg><arg name="journal"><space/>[[Fides et Historia]]<space/></arg><arg name="volume"><space/>29<space/></arg><arg name="issue"><space/>1</arg><arg name="pages"><space/>60–72<space/></arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>When Franklin established himself in Philadelphia, shortly before 1730, the town boasted two &quot;wretched little&quot; news sheets,<space/><link><target>Andrew Bradford</target></link>'s<space/><italics>American Mercury</italics>, and<space/><link><target>Samuel Keimer</target></link>'s<space/><italics>Universal Instructor in all Arts and Sciences, and Pennsylvania Gazette</italics>.

The<space/><italics>Gazette</italics><space/>soon became Franklin's characteristic organ, which he freely used for satire, for the play of his wit, even for sheer excess of mischief or of fun. From the first he had a way of adapting his models to his own uses. The series of essays called &quot;The Busy-Body&quot;, which he wrote for Bradford's<space/><italics>American Mercury</italics><space/>in 1729, followed the general<space/><link><target>Joseph Addison</target><part>Addisonian</part></link><space/>form, already modified to suit homelier conditions. The thrifty Patience, in her busy little shop, complaining of the useless visitors who waste her valuable time, is related to the ladies who address Mr. Spectator. The Busy-Body himself is a true Censor Morum, as<space/><link><target>Isaac Bickerstaff</target></link><space/>had been in the<space/><italics>Tatler</italics>. And a number of the fictitious characters, Ridentius, Eugenius, Cato, and Cretico, represent traditional 18th-century classicism. Even this Franklin could use for contemporary satire, since Cretico, the &quot;sowre Philosopher&quot;, is evidently a portrait of Franklin's rival,<space/><link><target>Samuel Keimer</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>As time went on, Franklin depended less on his literary conventions, and more on his own native humor.

Cadell, 1785.</extension><space/>Franklin, who was 79 years old at the time, wrote thanking him for a great idea and telling him that he had decided to leave a bequest of 1,000&amp;nbsp;pounds each to his native Boston and his adopted Philadelphia. By 1990, more than $2,000,000 had accumulated in Franklin's Philadelphia trust, which had loaned the money to local residents. From 1940 to 1990, the money was used mostly for mortgage loans. When the trust came due, Philadelphia decided to spend it on scholarships for local high school students. Franklin's Boston trust fund accumulated almost $5,000,000 during that same time; at the end of its first 100 years a portion was allocated to help establish a<space/><link><target>Vocational school</target><part>trade school</part></link><space/>that became the<space/><link><target>Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology</target><part>Franklin Institute of Boston</part></link>, and the whole fund was later dedicated to supporting this institute.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.mathsci.appstate.edu/~sjg/class/1010/wc/finance/franklin1.html<space/></arg><arg name="title">Excerpt from Philadelphia Inquirer article by Clark De Leon<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Mathsci.appstate.edu<space/></arg><arg name="date">February 7, 1993<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">September 21, 2009</arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.bfit.edu/aboutus/history.php<space/></arg><arg name="title">History of the Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Bfit.edu<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">September 21, 2009</arg><arg name="archiveurl"><space/>https://web.archive.org/web/20080731130624/http://www.bfit.edu/aboutus/history.php</arg><arg name="archivedate"><space/>July 31, 2008</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Franklin on U.S. postage</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Benjamin Franklin 1861 Issue-1c.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>170px</part><part><xhtml:center>Issue of 1861</xhtml:center></part></link><link><target>File:Benjamin Franklin2 1895 Issue-1c.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>186px</part><part><xhtml:center>Issue of 1895</xhtml:center></part></link>Benjamin Franklin is a prominent figure in American history comparable to Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln, and as such he has been honored on U.S. postage stamps many times.
