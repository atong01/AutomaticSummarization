'''Canis Major''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|eɪ|n|ɨ|s|_|ˈ|m|eɪ|dʒ|ər}} is a [[constellation]] in the [[Southern Celestial Hemisphere|southern celestial hemisphere]]. In the second century, it was included in [[Ptolemy]]'s 48 constellations, and is counted among the [[88 modern constellations]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for "greater dog" in contrast to [[Canis Minor]], the "lesser dog"; both figures are commonly represented as following the constellation of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] the hunter through the sky. The [[Milky Way]] passes through Canis Major and several [[open cluster]]s lie within its borders, most notably [[Messier 41|M41]].

Canis Major contains [[Sirius]], the [[List of brightest stars|brightest star]] in the night sky, known as the "dog star". It is bright because of its proximity to our Solar System. In contrast, the other bright stars of the constellation are stars of great distance and high [[luminosity]]. At magnitude 1.5, [[Epsilon Canis Majoris]] (Adhara) is the second brightest star of the [[constellation]] and the brightest source of [[extreme ultraviolet]] radiation in the night sky. Next in brightness are the yellow-white supergiant [[Delta Canis Majoris|Delta]] (Wezen) at 1.8, the blue-white giant [[Beta Canis Majoris|Beta]] (Mirzam) at 2.0, blue-white supergiants [[Eta Canis Majoris|Eta]] (Aludra) at 2.4 and [[Omicron1 Canis Majoris|Omicron<sup>1</sup>]] at 3.0, and white spectroscopic binary [[Zeta Canis Majoris|Zeta]] (Furud), also at 3.0. The red hypergiant [[VY Canis Majoris]] is one of the [[List of largest known stars|largest stars known]], while the [[neutron star]] [[RX J0720.4-3125]] has a radius of a mere 5&nbsp;km.

== History and mythology ==

=== In western astronomy ===
In ancient [[Mesopotamia]], Sirius, named KAK.SI.DI by the [[Babylon]]ians, was seen as an arrow aiming towards Orion, while the southern stars of Canis Major and a part of [[Puppis]] were viewed as a bow, named BAN in the ''[[Babylonian star catalogues#Three Stars Each|Three Stars Each]]'' tablets, dating to around 1100 BC. In the later compendium of Babylonian astronomy and astrology titled ''[[MUL.APIN]]'', the arrow, Sirius, was also linked with the warrior [[Ninurta]], and the bow with [[Ishtar]], daughter of [[Enlil]].<ref name="rogers1998">{{cite journal | first=John H. | last=Rogers | year=1998 | title=Origins of the Ancient Constellations: I.

In Greek Mythology, Canis Major represented the dog [[Laelaps (mythology)|Laelaps]], a gift from [[Zeus]] to [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]]; or sometimes the hound of [[Procris]], [[Diana (mythology)|Diana's]] nymph; or the one given by [[Eos|Aurora]] to [[Cephalus]], so famed for its speed that Zeus elevated it to the sky.{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=117}} It was also considered to represent one of Orion's hunting dogs,{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=98–99}} pursuing [[Lepus (constellation)|Lepus]] the [[Hare]] or helping Orion fight [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] the Bull; and is referred to in this way by [[Aratus|Aratos]], [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]]. The [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] refer only to one dog, but by [[ancient Rome|Roman]] times, [[Canis Minor]] appears as Orion's second dog. Alternative names include Canis Sequens and Canis Alter.{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=117}} Canis Syrius was the name used in the 1521 ''[[Alfonsine tables]]''.{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=117}}

The Roman myth refers to Canis Major as ''Custos Europae'', the dog guarding Europa but failing to prevent her abduction by [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] in the form of a bull, and as ''[[Cerberus|Janitor Lethaeus]]'', "the watchdog".{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=118}} In medieval Arab astronomy, the constellation became ''Al Kalb al Akbar'', "the Greater Dog", transcribed as ''Alcheleb Alachbar'' by 17th century writer [[Edmund Chilmead]]. Islamic scholar [[Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī]] referred to Orion as  ''Al Kalb al Jabbār'', "the Dog of the Giant".{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=117}} Among the [[Merazig]] of [[Tunisia]], shepherds note six constellations that mark the passage of the dry, hot season. One of them, called ''[[Merzem]]'', includes the stars of Canis Major and Canis Minor and is the herald of two weeks of hot weather.<ref>{{cite journal |title = A Review of African Ethno-Astronomy: With Particular Reference to Saharan Livestock-Keepers |last = Oxby |first = Claire |journal = La Ricerca Folklorica |date = October 1999 |pages = 57–58 | jstor = 1479768 |issue = 40}}</ref>

=== In non-western astronomy ===
In [[Chinese astronomy]], the modern constellation of [[Canis Major (Chinese astronomy)|Canis Major]] lies in the [[Vermilion Bird]] (南方朱雀, ''Nán Fāng Zhū Què''), where the stars were classified in several separate [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]]s of stars. The Military Market (''Jūnshì'' 軍市) was a circular pattern of stars containing [[Nu3 Canis Majoris|Nu<sup>3</sup>]], [[Beta Canis Majoris|Beta]], [[Xi1 Canis Majoris|Xi<sup>1</sup>]] and [[Xi2 Canis Majoris|Xi<sup>2</sup>]], and some stars from Lepus.{{sfn|Schlegel|1967|p=428}} The Wild Cockerel (''Yějī'' 野雞) was at the centre of the Military Market, although it is uncertain which stars depicted what. Schlegel reported that the stars [[Omicron Canis Majoris|Omicron]] and [[Pi Canis Majoris]] might have been them,{{sfn|Schlegel|1967|p=430}} while Beta or [[Nu2 Canis Majoris|Nu<sup>2</sup>]] have also been proposed.<ref name="ridpathcma">{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/canismajor.htm |work=Star Tales  | title=Canis Major – the Greater Dog |last1=Ridpath|first1=Ian|publisher=self-published | accessdate= 1 March 2014}}</ref> [[Sirius]] was ''Tiānláng'' (天狼), the Celestial Wolf,{{sfn|Schlegel|1967|p=431}} denoting invasion and plunder.<ref name="ridpathcma"/> Southeast of the Wolf was the asterism ''Húshǐ'' (弧矢), the celestial Bow and Arrow, which was interpreted as containing [[Delta Canis Majoris|Delta]], [[Epsilon Canis Majoris|Epsilon]], [[Eta Canis Majoris|Eta]] and [[Kappa Canis Majoris]] and [[Delta Velorum]]. Alternatively, the arrow was depicted by [[Omicron2 Canis Majoris|Omicron<sup>2</sup>]] and Eta and aiming at Sirius (the Wolf), while the bow comprised Kappa, Epsilon, [[Sigma Canis Majoris|Sigma]], Delta and 164 Canis Majoris, and [[Pi Puppis|Pi]] and [[Omicron Puppis]].{{sfn|Schlegel|1967|p=434}}<!-- cites previous two sentences -->

Both the [[Māori people]] and the people of the [[Tuamotus]] recognized the figure of Canis Major as a distinct entity, though it was sometimes absorbed into other constellations. ''Te Huinga-o-Rehua'', also called ''Te Putahi-nui-o-Rehua'' and ''Te Kahui-Takurua'', ("The Assembly of Rehua" or "The Assembly of Sirius") was a Maori constellation that included both Canis Minor and Canis Major, along with some surrounding stars.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=212}}{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=215}} Related was ''Taumata-o-Rehua'', also called ''Pukawanui'', the Mirror of Rehua, formed from an undefined group of stars in Canis Major.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=258}}{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=247}} They called Sirius ''Rehua'' and ''Takarua'', corresponding to two of the names for the constellation, though ''Rehua'' was a name applied to other stars in various Maori groups and other Polynesian cosmologies.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=249}}{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=254}} The Tuamotu people called Canis Major ''Muihanga-hetika-o-Takurua'', "the abiding assemblage of Takurua".{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=236}}

The Tharumba people of the [[Shoalhaven River]] saw three stars of Canis Major as ''Wunbula'' (Bat) and his two wives ''Murrumbool'' (Mrs Brown Snake) and ''Moodtha'' (Mrs Black Snake); bored of following their husband around, the women try to bury him while he is hunting a wombat down its hole.

Canis Major is a prominent constellation because of its many bright stars. These include Sirius (Alpha Canis Majoris), the [[List of brightest stars|brightest star]] in the night sky, as well as three other stars above magnitude 2.0.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=98–99}} Furthermore, two other stars are thought to have previously outshone all others in the night sky—Adhara (Epsilon Canis Majoris) shone at -3.99 around 4.7 million years ago, and Mirzam (Beta Canis Majoris) peaked at −3.65 around 4.42 million years ago.

The German cartographer [[Johann Bayer]] used the Greek letters [[Alpha]] through [[Omicron]] to label the most prominent stars in the constellation, including three adjacent stars as Nu and two further pairs as Xi and Omicron,{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=73}} while subsequent observers designated further stars in the southern parts of the constellation that were hard to discern from Central Europe.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=71}} Bayer's countryman [[Johann Elert Bode]] later added Sigma, Tau and Omega;{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=74}} the French astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] added lettered stars a to k (though none are in use today).{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=74}}  [[John Flamsteed]] numbered 31 stars, with 3 Canis Majoris being placed by Lacaille into Columba as [[Delta Columbae]] (Flamsteed had not recognised Columba as a distinct constellation).{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=368}} He also labelled two stars—his [[10 Canis Majoris|10]] and [[Kappa Canis Majoris|13 Canis Majoris]]—as Kappa<sup>1</sup> and Kappa<sup>2</sup> respectively, but subsequent cartographers such as [[Francis Baily]] and [[John Bevis]] dropped the fainter former star, leaving Kappa<sup>2</sup> as the sole Kappa.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=73}} Flamsteed's listing of Nu<sup>1</sup>, Nu<sup>2</sup>, Nu<sup>3</sup>, Xi<sup>1</sup>, Xi<sup>2</sup>, Omicron<sup>1</sup> and Omicron<sup>2</sup> have all remained in use.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|pp=73-74}}

Sirius is the [[List of brightest stars|brightest star in the night sky]] at [[apparent magnitude]] −1.46 and one of the [[List of nearest stars|closest stars to Earth]] at a distance of 8.6 [[light-year]]s. Its name comes from the Greek word for "scorching" or "searing".

In 2003, an overdensity of stars in the region was announced to be the [[Canis Major Overdensity|Canis Major Dwarf]], the closest [[satellite galaxy]] to Earth. However, there remains debate over whether it represents a disrupted dwarf galaxy or in fact a variation in the thin and thick disk and spiral arm populations of the Milky Way. Investigation of the area yielded only ten [[RR Lyrae variable]]s—consistent with the Milky Way's halo and thick disk populations rather than a separate dwarf spheroidal galaxy.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Mateu, Cecilia; Vivas, A.

[[NGC 2207 and IC 2163]] are a pair of face-on [[interacting galaxy|interacting]] spiral galaxies located 125 million light-years from Earth. About 40 million years ago, the two galaxies had a close encounter and are now moving farther apart; nevertheless, the smaller IC 2163 will eventually be incorporated into NGC 2207. As the interaction continues, gas and dust will be perturbed, sparking extensive [[star formation]] in both galaxies.{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006|p=456}} Supernovae have been observed in NGC 2207 in 1975 (type Ia [[SN 1975a]]),<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kirshner, Robert P.; Arp, H.C.; Dunlap, J.R.|year=1976|title=Observations of Supernovae - 1975a in NGC 2207 and 1975b in the Perseus Cluster|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=207|issue=1|pages=44–52.|bibcode=1976ApJ...207...44K|last2=Arp|last3=Dunlap|doi=10.1086/154465}}</ref> 1999 (the type Ib [[SN 1999ec]]),<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jha, S.; Garnavich, P.; Challis, P.; Kirshner, R.; Berlind, P.|year=1999|title=Supernova 1999ec in NGC 2207|journal=IAUC|volume=7269|page=2|bibcode=1999IAUC.7269....2J|last2=Garnavich|first2=P.|last3=Challis|first3=P.|last4=Kirshner|first4=R.|last5=Berlind|first5=P.}}</ref> 2003 (type 1b supernova [[SN 2003H]]),<ref>{{cite web | first=David | last=Bishop | title=Bright Supernovae - 2003 | publisher=Rochester University | url=http://www.rochesterastronomy.org/sn2003/ | accessdate=7 March 2014}}</ref> and 2013 (type II supernova [[SN 2013ai]]).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Conseil |first1= E.|year=2013|title=Supernova 2013ai in NGC 2207 = Psn J06161835-2122329|journal=Central Bureau Electronic Telegrams |volume=3431|issue=3431|page=1|bibcode=2013CBET.3431....1C|last2=Fraser|first2=M.|last3=Inserra|first3=C.|last4=Walton|first4=N.|last5=Blagorodnova|first5=N.|last6=Nicholl|first6=M.|last7=Benetti|first7=S.|last8=Pastorello|first8=A.|last9=Valenti|first9=S.|last10=Taubenberger|first10=S.|last11=Smartt|first11=S.
