'''Drawing''' is a form of [[visual art]] in which a person uses various drawing instruments to mark [[paper]] or another [[two-dimensional]] medium. Instruments include [[graphite]] [[pencil]]s, [[pen and ink]], [[ink]]ed [[brush]]es, wax [[color pencil]]s, [[crayon]]s, [[charcoal]], [[chalk]], [[pastel]]s, various kinds of [[erasers]], [[Marker pen|markers]], [[stylus]]es, various metals (such as [[silverpoint]]), and electronic drawing.
An artist who practices or works in technical drawing may be called a ''[[drafter]],''  ''[[draftsman]],'' or ''[[draughtsman]]''.<ref>http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/draftsman</ref>

A drawing instrument releases small amount of material onto a surface, leaving a visible mark. The most common support for drawing is [[paper]], although other materials, such as [[Paperboard|cardboard]], plastic, [[leather]], [[canvas]], and [[Lumber|board]], may be used. Temporary drawings may be made on a [[blackboard]] or [[whiteboard]] or indeed almost anything. The medium has been a popular and fundamental means of public expression throughout human history. It is one of the simplest and most efficient means of communicating visual ideas.<ref name=SBTCModule6>{{cite web|last=www.sbctc.edu (adapted)|title=Module 6: Media for 2-D Art|url=http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Module-6.pdf|publisher=Saylor.org|accessdate=2 April 2012}}</ref> The wide availability of drawing instruments makes drawing one of the most common artistic activities.

==Overview==
[[File:Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec - Madame Palmyre with Her Dog, 1897.jpg|thumb|upright|''Madame Palmyre with Her Dog'', 1897. [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]]]
Drawing is one of the major forms of expression within the visual arts. It is generally concerned with the marking of lines and areas of tone onto paper, where the accurate representation of the visual world is expressed upon a plane surface.<ref>http://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-education/publications/Reprints2010/2010-PACA-ArtStudentsWhoCannotDraw.pdf</ref> Traditional drawings were [[monochrome]], or at least had little colour,<ref>See [[grisaille]] and [[chiaroscuro]]</ref> while modern colored-pencil drawings may approach or cross a boundary between drawing and painting. In Western terminology, drawing is distinct from painting, even though similar [[List of artistic mediums#Drawing|media]] often are employed in both tasks. Dry media, normally associated with drawing, such as chalk, may be used in [[pastel]] paintings. Drawing may be done with a liquid medium, applied with brushes or pens. Similar supports likewise can serve both: painting generally involves the application of liquid paint onto prepared canvas or panels, but sometimes an [[underdrawing]] is drawn first on that same support.

Drawing is often exploratory, with considerable emphasis on observation, problem-solving and composition. Drawing is also regularly used in preparation for a painting, further obfuscating their distinction. Drawings created for these purposes are called [[Study (art)|studies]].

There are several categories of drawing, including [[figure drawing]], [[cartooning]], [[doodling]] and [[shading]]. There are also many drawing methods, such as line drawing, stippling, shading, the surrealist method of [[Surrealist techniques#Entopic graphomania|entopic graphomania]] (in which dots are made at the sites of impurities in a blank sheet of paper, and lines are then made between the dots), and tracing (drawing on a translucent paper, such as ''[[tracing paper]]'', around the outline of preexisting shapes that show through the paper).

A quick, unrefined drawing may be called a ''[[Sketch (drawing)|sketch]]''.

In fields outside art, [[technical drawing]]s or plans of buildings, machinery, circuitry and other things are often called "drawings" even when they have been transferred to another medium by printing.

'''''Drawing as a Form of Communication'''''
Drawing is one of the oldest forms of human expression, with evidence for its existence preceding that of written communication.<ref name="Tversky 2011 499–535">{{cite journal|last=Tversky|first=B|title=Visualizing thought|journal=Topics in Cognitive Science|year=2011|volume=3|issue=3|pages=499–535|doi=10.1111/j.1756-8765.2010.01113.x}}</ref> It is believed that drawing was used as a specialised form of communication before the invent of the written language,<ref name="Tversky 2011 499–535"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Farthing|first=S|title=The Bigger Picture of Drawing|url=http://ttd2011.pressible.org/files/2012/05/Thinking-through-Drawing_Practice-into-Knowledge.pdf|year=2011}}</ref> demonstrated by the production of cave and rock paintings created by ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]'' around 30,000 years ago.<ref>http://ttd2011.pressible.org/files/2012/05/Thinking-through-Drawing_Practice-into-Knowledge.pdf</ref> These drawings, known as pictograms, depicted objects and abstract concepts.<ref>{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=A|title=Writing and script: a very short introduction|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}</ref> The sketches and paintings produced in [[prehistoric]] times were eventually stylised and simplified, leading to the development of the [[written language]] as we know it today.

'''''Drawing in the Arts'''''
Drawing is used to express one's creativity, and therefore has been prominent in the world of art. Throughout much of history, drawing was regarded as the foundation for artistic practise.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Walker|first1=J. F|title=Drawing- The Process|year=2005|publisher=Intellect Books|location=Bristol|author2=Duff, L|author3=Davies, J|chapter=Old Manuals and New Pencils}}</ref> Initially, artists used and re-used wooden tablets for the production of their drawings.<ref>See the discussion on erasable drawing boards and 'tafeletten' in {{cite book|last=van de Wetering|first=Ernst|title=Rembrandt: The Painter at Work}}</ref> Following the widespread availability of paper in the 14th century, the use drawing in the arts increased. At this point, drawing was commonly used as a tool for thought and investigation, acting as a study medium whilst artists were preparing for their final pieces of work.<ref>{{cite web|last=Burton|first=J|title=Preface|url=http://ttd2011.pressible.org/files/2012/05/Thinking-through-Drawing_Practice-into-Knowledge.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Chamberlain|first=R|title=Drawing Conclusions: An exploration of the cognitive and neuroscientific foundations of representational drawing.|year=2013|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1408829/}}</ref> In a period of artistic flourish, the Renaissance brought about drawings exhibiting realistic representational qualities,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Davis |first1=P|title=Drawing- The Process|year=2005|publisher=Intellect Books|location=Bristol|pages=15–25|author2=Duff, L |author3=Davies, J|chapter=Drawing a Blank}}</ref> where there was a lot of influence from geometry and philosophy.<ref>{{cite web |last=Simmons |first=S |title=Philosophical Dimension of Drawing Instruction |url=http://ttd2011.pressible.org/files/2012/05/Thinking-through-Drawing_Practice-into-Knowledge.pdf|year=2011}}</ref>

The invention of the first widely available form of [[photography]] led to a shift in the use of drawing in the arts.<ref>{{cite book|last=Poe|first=E. A.|title=The Daguerreotype. Classic Essays on Photography.|year=1840|publisher=Leete's Island Books|location=New Haven, CN|pages=37–38}}</ref> Photography took over from drawing as a more superior method for accurately representing the visual world. Following the invention of photography, artists began to abandon traditional drawing practises.<ref name="Kovats 2005">{{cite book|last=Kovats|first=T|title=The Drawing Book|year=2005|publisher=Black Dog Publishing|location=London}}</ref> [[Modernism]] in the arts encouraged 'imaginative originality'<ref>{{cite book|last1=Duff|first1=L|title=Drawing- The Process|year=2005|publisher=Intellect Books|location=Bristol|author2=Davies, J}}</ref> and artists became more abstract in their approach to drawing.

'''''Drawing Outside of the Arts'''''
Although the use of drawing is extensive in the arts, its practice is not confined purely to this field. Before the widespread availability of paper, 12th century [[monks]] in European monasteries used intricate drawings to prepare illustrated, illuminated manuscripts on vellum and parchment. Drawing has also been used extensively in the field of science, as a method of discovery, understanding and explanation. In 1616, astronomer [[Galileo Galilei]] explained the changing phases of the moon through his observational telescopic drawings.<ref name="Kovats 2005"/> Additionally, in 1924, geophysicist [[Alfred Wegener]] used illustrations to visually demonstrate the origin of the continents.<ref name="Kovats 2005"/>

===Notable draftsmen===
Since the 14th century, each century has produced artists who have created great drawings.
* Notable draftsmen of the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries include [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Michelangelo]] and [[Raphael]].

* Notable draftsmen of the 19th century include [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Aubrey Beardsley]], [[Jacques-Louis David]], [[Pierre-Paul Prud'hon]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Théodore Géricault]], [[Francisco Goya]], [[Jean Ingres]], [[Odilon Redon]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Honoré Daumier]], and [[Vincent van Gogh]].
* Notable draftsmen of the 20th century include [[Käthe Kollwitz]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[George Grosz]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Oscar Kokoschka]], [[Alphonse Mucha]], [[M. C. Escher]], [[André Masson]], [[Jules Pascin]], and [[Pablo Picasso]].

==Materials==
[[File:Watteau jeune fille.jpg|thumb|left|[[Antoine Watteau]], ''[[trois crayons]]'' technique]]
The medium is the means by which ink, pigment or color are delivered onto the drawing surface. Most drawing media are either dry (e.g. [[graphite]], [[charcoal]], [[pastels]], [[Conté]], [[silverpoint]]), or use a fluid solvent or carrier ([[Marker pen|marker]], [[pen and ink]]). Watercolor pencils can be used dry like ordinary pencils, then moistened with a wet brush to get various painterly effects. Very rarely, artists have drawn with (usually decoded) [[invisible ink]]. Metalpoint drawing usually employs either of two metals: silver or lead.<ref>Cennino Cennini, The Craftsman's Handbook (Il Libra dell'Arte), trans. David V. Thompson, Jr. New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University Press, 1933</ref> More rarely used are gold, platinum, copper, brass, bronze, and tinpoint.

Paper comes in a variety of different sizes and qualities, ranging from newspaper grade up to high quality and relatively expensive paper sold as individual sheets.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mayer |first=Ralph |title=The Artist's Handbook of Materials and Techniques |publisher=Viking |isbn=0-670-83701-6 }}</ref> Papers can vary in texture, hue, acidity, and strength when wet. Smooth paper is good for rendering fine detail, but a more "toothy" paper holds the drawing material better. Thus a coarser material is useful for producing deeper contrast.

Newsprint and typing paper may be useful for practice and rough sketches. Tracing paper is used to experiment over a half-finished drawing, and to transfer a design from one sheet to another. Cartridge paper is the basic type of drawing paper sold in pads. Bristol board and even heavier acid-free boards, frequently with smooth finishes, are used for drawing fine detail and do not distort when wet media (ink, washes) are applied. Vellum is extremely smooth and suitable for very fine detail. Coldpressed watercolor paper may be favored for ink drawing due to its texture.

Acid-free, archival quality paper keeps its color and texture far longer than [[wood pulp]] based paper such as [[newsprint]], which turns yellow and become brittle much sooner.

The basic tools are a [[drawing board]] or table, [[pencil sharpener]] and [[eraser]], and for ink drawing, [[blotting paper]]. Other tools used are [[circle compass]], [[ruler]], and [[set square]]. [[Fixative (drawing)|Fixative]] is used to prevent pencil and crayon marks from smudging. [[Drafting tape]] is used to secure paper to drawing surface, and also to mask an area to keep it free of accidental marks sprayed or spattered materials and washes. An easel or slanted table is used to keep the drawing surface in a suitable position, which is generally more horizontal than the position used in painting.

==Technique==
[[File:Raphaël - Étude Madone d'Albe 1.jpg|thumb|[[Raphael]], study for what became the [[Alba Madonna]], with other sketches]]
Almost all draftsmen use their hands and fingers to apply the media, with the exception of some handicapped individuals who draw with their mouth or feet.<ref>http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2010/03/the-amazing-art-of-disabled-artists/</ref>

Prior to working on an image, the artist typically explores how various media work. They may try different drawing implements on practice sheets to determine value and texture, and how to apply the implement to produce various effects.

The artist's choice of drawing strokes affects the appearance of the image. Pen and ink drawings often use [[hatching]]—groups of parallel lines.<ref>This is unrelated to the [[hatching system]] in heraldry that indicates [[tincture (heraldry)|tincture]] (i.e., the color of arms depicted in monochrome.)</ref> Cross-hatching uses hatching in two or more different directions to create a darker tone. Broken hatching, or lines with intermittent breaks, form lighter tones—and controlling the density of the breaks achieves a gradation of tone. [[stipple|Stippling]], uses dots to produce tone, [[wikt:Texture|texture]] or [[shading|shade]]. Different textures can be achieved depending on the method used to build tone.<ref>{{cite book|last=Guptill|first=Arthur L.|title=Drawing with Pen and Ink|year=1930|publisher=Reinhold Publishing Corporation|location=New York}}</ref>

Drawings in dry media often use similar techniques, though pencils and drawing sticks can achieve continuous variations in tone. Typically a drawing is filled in based on which hand the artist favors. A right-handed artist draws from left to right to avoid smearing the image. [[Erasers]] can remove unwanted lines, lighten tones, and clean up stray marks. In a sketch or outline drawing, lines drawn often follow the contour of the subject, creating depth by looking like shadows cast from a light in the artist's position.

Sometimes the artist leaves a section of the image untouched while filling in the remainder. The shape of the area to preserve can be painted with [[Masking (in art)|masking fluid]] or cut out of a [[frisket]] and applied to the drawing surface, protecting the surface from stray marks until the mask is removed.

Another method to preserve a section of the image is to apply a spray-on ''fixative'' to the surface. This holds loose material more firmly to the sheet and prevents it from smearing. However the fixative spray typically uses chemicals that can harm the respiratory system, so it should be employed in a well-ventilated area such as outdoors.

Another technique is [[subtractive drawing]] in which the drawing surface is covered with graphite or charcoal and then erased to make the image.<ref>South, Helen, ''The Everything Drawing Book'', Adams Media, Avon, MA, 2004, pp. 152-3, ISBN 1593372132</ref>

==Tone==
[[File:Leonardo da Vinci - presumed self-portrait - WGA12798.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Line drawing in [[sanguine]] by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]]]
Shading is the technique of varying the tonal values on the paper to represent the shade of the material as well as the placement of the shadows. Careful attention to reflected light, shadows and highlights can result in a very realistic rendition of the image.

Blending uses an implement to soften or spread the original drawing strokes. Blending is most easily done with a medium that does not immediately [[Fixative (drawing)|fix]] itself, such as graphite, chalk, or charcoal, although freshly applied ink can be smudged, wet or dry, for some effects. For shading and blending, the artist can use a [[Tortillon|blending stump]], [[Facial tissue|tissue]], a [[kneaded eraser]], a fingertip, or any combination of them. A piece of [[Chamois leather|chamois]] is useful for creating smooth textures, and for removing material to lighten the tone. Continuous tone can be achieved with graphite on a smooth surface without blending, but the technique is laborious, involving small circular or oval strokes with a somewhat blunt point.

Shading techniques that also introduce texture to the drawing include [[hatching]] and [[stippling]]. A number of other methods produce texture. In addition to the choice of paper, drawing material and technique affect texture. Texture can be made to appear more realistic when it is drawn next to a contrasting texture; a coarse texture is more obvious when placed next to a smoothly blended area. A similar effect can be achieved by drawing different tones close together. A light edge next to a dark background stands out to the eye, and almost appears to float above the surface.

==Form and proportion==
[[File:Ingres montagu.jpg|thumb|upright|Pencil portrait by [[Ingres]]]]
Measuring the dimensions of a subject while blocking in the drawing is an important step in producing a realistic rendition of the subject. Tools such as a [[Compass (drafting)|compass]] can be used to measure the angles of different sides. These angles can be reproduced on the drawing surface and then rechecked to make sure they are accurate. Another form of measurement is to compare the relative sizes of different parts of the subject with each other. A finger placed at a point along the drawing implement can be used to compare that dimension with other parts of the image. A [[ruler]] can be used both as a [[straightedge]] and a device to compute proportions.

When attempting to draw a complicated shape such as a human figure, it is helpful at first to represent the form with a set of primitive shapes. Almost any form can be represented by some combination of the cube, sphere, cylinder, and cone. Once these basic shapes have been assembled into a likeness, then the drawing can be refined into a more accurate and polished form. The lines of the primitive shapes are removed and replaced by the final likeness. Drawing the underlying construction is a fundamental skill for representational art, and is taught in many books and schools. Its correct application resolves most uncertainties about smaller details, and makes the final image look consistent.<ref name=drawinghale>{{cite book|last=Hale|first=Robert Beverly|title=Drawing Lessons from the Great Masters|year=1964|publication-date=2009|edition=45th Anniversary|publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications|isbn=978-0-8230-1401-9}}</ref>

A more refined art of [[figure drawing]] relies upon the artist possessing a deep understanding of anatomy and the human proportions. A trained artist is familiar with the skeleton structure, joint location, muscle placement, tendon movement, and how the different parts work together during movement. This allows the artist to render more natural poses that do not appear artificially stiff. The artist is also familiar with how the proportions vary depending on the age of the subject, particularly when drawing a portrait.

==Perspective==
[[Perspective (graphical)|Linear perspective]] is a method of portraying objects on a flat surface so that the dimensions shrink with distance. Each set of parallel, straight edges of any object, whether a building or a table, follows lines that eventually converge at a vanishing point. Typically this convergence point is somewhere along the horizon, as buildings are built level with the flat surface. When multiple structures are aligned with each other, such as buildings along a street, the horizontal tops and bottoms of the structures typically converge at a vanishing point.

[[File:2-punktperspektive.svg|thumb|right|Two-point [[perspective drawing]]]]
When both the fronts and sides of a building are drawn, then the parallel lines forming a side converge at a second point along the horizon (which may be off the drawing paper.) This is a two-point perspective.<ref>{{cite book|last=Watson|first=Ernest W.|title=Course in Pencil Sketching: Four Books in One|year=1978|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold Company|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-442-29229-5|pages=167–175}}</ref> Converging the vertical lines to a third point above or below the horizon then produces a three-point perspective.

Depth can also be portrayed by several techniques in addition to the perspective approach above. Objects of similar '''size''' should appear ever smaller the further they are from the viewer. Thus the back wheel of a cart appears slightly smaller than the front wheel. Depth can be portrayed through the use of '''texture'''. As the texture of an object gets further away it becomes more compressed and busy, taking on an entirely different character than if it was close. Depth can also be portrayed by reducing the contrast in more distant objects, and by making their colors less saturated. This reproduces the effect of '''atmospheric''' haze, and cause the eye to focus primarily on objects drawn in the foreground.

==Artistry==
[[File:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - Study of a Seated Veiled Female Figure (19th Century).png|left|thumb|upright|[[Chiaroscuro]] [[Study (drawing)|study drawing]] by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]]]]
The [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] of the image is an important element in producing an interesting work of [[artistic merit]]. The artist plans element placement in the art to communicate ideas and feelings with the viewer. The composition can determine the focus of the art, and result in a harmonious whole that is aesthetically appealing and stimulating.

The [[illumination (image)|illumination]] of the subject is also a key element in creating an artistic piece, and the interplay of [[Chiaroscuro|light and shadow]] is a valuable method in the artist's toolbox. The [[Three-point lighting|placement of the light sources]] can make a considerable difference in the type of message that is being presented. Multiple light sources can wash out any wrinkles in a person's face, for instance, and give a more youthful appearance. In contrast, a single light source, such as harsh daylight, can serve to highlight any texture or interesting features.

When drawing an object or figure, the skilled artist pays attention to both the area within the silhouette and what lies outside. The exterior is termed the [[negative space]], and can be as important in the representation as the figure. Objects placed in the background of the figure should appear properly placed wherever they can be viewed.

[[File:Ingres Academic Study (detail) 03.jpg|thumb|upright|Drawing process in the ''Academic Study of a Male Torso'' by [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]] (1801, [[National Museum, Warsaw]])]]

A [[Study (drawing)|study]] is a draft drawing that is made in preparation for a planned final image. Studies can be used to determine the appearances of specific parts of the completed image, or for experimenting with the best approach for accomplishing the end goal. However a well-crafted study can be a piece of art in its own right, and many hours of careful work can go into completing a study.

==The Drawing Process==
Individuals display differences in their ability to produce visually accurate drawings.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ostrofsky|first=J|title=A Multi-Stage Attention Hypothesis of Drawing Ability|url=Retrieved from http://ttd2011.pressible.org/files/2012/05/Thinking-through-Drawing_Practice-into-Knowledge.pdf|year=2011}}</ref> A visually accurate drawing is described as being "recognized as a particular object at a particular time and in a particular space, rendered with little addition of visual detail that can not be seen in the object represented or with little deletion of visual detail”.<ref name="Cohen 1997 609–621">{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=D. J|author2=Bennett, S.|title=Why can't most people draw what they see?|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=1997|volume=67|issue=6|pages=609–621|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.23.3.609 }}</ref>

Investigative studies have aimed to explain the reasons why some individuals draw better than others. 
One study posited four key abilities in the drawing process: perception of objects being drawn, ability to make good representational decisions, motor skills required for mark-making and the drawer's own perception of their drawing.<ref name="Cohen 1997 609–621"/> Following this hypothesis, several studies have sought to conclude which of these processes are most significant in affecting the accuracy of drawings.

'''''Motor Function'''''
Motor function is an important physical component in the 'Production Phase' of the drawing process.<ref>{{cite journal|last=van Somers|first=P|title=A system for drawing and drawing-related neuropsychology.|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychology|year=1989|volume=6|pages=117–164|doi=10.1080/02643298908253416}}</ref> It has been suggested that motor function plays a role in drawing ability, though its effects are not significant.<ref name="Cohen 1997 609–621"/>

'''''[[Perception]]'''''
It has been suggested that an individual's ability to perceive an object they are drawing is the most important stage in the drawing process.<ref name="Cohen 1997 609–621"/>  This suggestion is supported by the discovery of a robust relationship between perception and drawing ability.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=D. J.|author2=Jones, H. E.|title=How shape constanct related to drawing accuracy|journal=The Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity and the Arts|year=2008|volume=2|issue=1|pages=8–19|doi=10.1037/1931-3896.2.1.8}}</ref>

This evidence acted as the basis of [[Betty Edwards]]' how-to drawing book, [[Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=B|year=1989|publisher=Putnam|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1585429202}}</ref> Edwards aimed to teach her readers how to draw, based on the development of the reader's perceptual abilities.

Furthermore, the influential artist and art critic [[John Ruskin]] emphasised the importance perception in the drawing process in his book The Elements of Drawing.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ruskin|first=John|title=The Elements of Drawing|year=1857|publisher=Dover Publishcations Inc|location=Mineola, NY}}</ref>  He stated that "For I am nearly convinced, that once we see keenly enough, there is very little difficult in drawing what we see".

'''''[[Visual memory]]'''''
has also been shown to influence one's ability to create visually accurate drawings. 
[[Short-term memory]] plays an important part in drawing as one’s gaze shifts between the object they are drawing and the drawing itself.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McManus|first=I. C.|coauthors=Chamberlain, R. S., Loo, P.-K., Rankin, Q., Riley, H., & Brunswick, N.|title=Art students who cannot draw: exploring the relations between drawing ability, visual memory, accuracy of copying, and dyslexia.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity and the Arts|year=2010|volume=4|pages=18–30|doi=10.1037/a0017335}}</ref>
