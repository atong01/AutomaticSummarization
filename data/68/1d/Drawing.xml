Bristol board and even heavier acid-free boards, frequently with smooth finishes, are used for drawing fine detail and do not distort when wet media (ink, washes) are applied.

A number of other methods produce texture. In addition to the choice of paper, drawing material and technique affect texture. Texture can be made to appear more realistic when it is drawn next to a contrasting texture; a coarse texture is more obvious when placed next to a smoothly blended area. A similar effect can be achieved by drawing different tones close together. A light edge next to a dark background stands out to the eye, and almost appears to float above the surface.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Form and proportion</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Ingres montagu.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>upright</part><part>Pencil portrait by<space/><link><target>Ingres</target></link></part></link>Measuring the dimensions of a subject while blocking in the drawing is an important step in producing a realistic rendition of the subject.

Once these basic shapes have been assembled into a likeness, then the drawing can be refined into a more accurate and polished form. The lines of the primitive shapes are removed and replaced by the final likeness.

Typically this convergence point is somewhere along the horizon, as buildings are built level with the flat surface. When multiple structures are aligned with each other, such as buildings along a street, the horizontal tops and bottoms of the structures typically converge at a vanishing point.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:2-punktperspektive.svg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>Two-point<space/><link><target>perspective drawing</target></link></part></link>When both the fronts and sides of a building are drawn, then the parallel lines forming a side converge at a second point along the horizon (which may be off the drawing paper.)

Objects of similar<space/><bold>size</bold><space/>should appear ever smaller the further they are from the viewer. Thus the back wheel of a cart appears slightly smaller than the front wheel. Depth can be portrayed through the use of<space/><bold>texture</bold>. As the texture of an object gets further away it becomes more compressed and busy, taking on an entirely different character than if it was close. Depth can also be portrayed by reducing the contrast in more distant objects, and by making their colors less saturated. This reproduces the effect of<space/><bold>atmospheric</bold><space/>haze, and cause the eye to focus primarily on objects drawn in the foreground.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Artistry</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - Study of a Seated Veiled Female Figure (19th Century).png</target><part>left</part><part>thumb</part><part>upright</part><part><link><target>Chiaroscuro</target></link><space/><link><target>Study (drawing)</target><part>study drawing</part></link><space/>by<space/><link><target>William-Adolphe Bouguereau</target></link></part></link>The<space/><link><target>Composition (visual arts)</target><part>composition</part></link><space/>of the image is an important element in producing an interesting work of<space/><link><target>artistic merit</target></link>.
