[[Costa Rica]] does not officially have a military.<ref>{{cite web|title=Costa Rica 1949 (rev. 2011)|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Costa_Rica_2011?lang=en#38|website=Constitute|accessdate=28 April 2015}}</ref> A small Costa Rican armed force performs policing and border patrol functions.

== History ==
On December 1, 1948, [[List of Presidents of Costa Rica|President]] [[José Figueres Ferrer]] of [[Costa Rica]] abolished the '''military of Costa Rica''' after victory in [[Costa Rican Civil War|the civil war]] in that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elespiritudel48.org/docu/h013.htm|author=El Espíritu del 48|title=Abolición del Ejército|accessdate=2008-03-09}} (Spanish)</ref>
In a ceremony in the ''Cuartel Bellavista'', Figueres broke a wall with a [[mallet]] symbolizing an end to Costa Rica's military spirit. 

In 1949, the abolition of the military was introduced in Article 12 of the [[Costa Rican Constitution]]. The budget previously dedicated to the military now is dedicated to security, education and culture. Costa Rica maintains Police Guard forces. 

The museum ''Museo Nacional de Costa Rica'' was placed in the ''Cuartel Bellavista'' as a symbol of commitment to culture. In 1986, President [[Oscar Arias Sánchez]] declared December 1 as the ''Día de la Abolición del Ejército'' (Military abolition day) with Law #8115. Unlike its neighbors, Costa Rica has not endured a [[civil war]] since 1948. Costa Rica maintains small forces capable of law enforcement and foreign peacekeeping, but has no permanent standing army. 

===Ministry of Public Security's Public Force (1996)===
In 1996, the Ministry of Public Security established the ''Fuerza Pública'' or Public Force which reorganized and eliminated the [[Civil Guard (Costa Rica)|Civil Guard]], Rural Assistance Guard, and Frontier Guards as separate entities. They are now under the Ministry and operate on a geographic command basis performing ground security, law enforcement, counter-narcotics, border patrol and tourism security functions.

Outside the ''Fuerza Pública'', there is a small Special Forces Unit, the Unidad Especial de Intervencion (UEI) or Special Intervention Unit, which trains with special forces of [[Israel]], and its namesake in Spain and other democratic nations, but is not part of the main police forces.  Instead it is part of the Intelligence and Security Directorate (DIS) which reports directly to the Minister of the Presidency.

Its motto is "God, Fatherland and Honor". Commissioner of Police Juan José Andrade Morales serves as its current Commissioner General.

==Aircraft inventory==
There are 13 aircraft on government support, law enforcement, and civil duties.
