This is the assembly line style of job specialization where employees are given a very narrow set of tasks or one specific task. Commitment division of labour is oriented on including the employee and building a level of internal commitment towards accomplishing tasks. Tasks include more responsibility and are coordinated based on expertise rather than formal position.<extension extension_name='ref' name="autogenerated2007">McAlister-Kizzier, Donna. &quot;Division of Labor.&quot; Encyclopedia of Business and Finance, 2nd ed.. 2007.

However, disadvantages of job specialization included limited employee skill, a dependence on entire department fluency, and employee discontent with repetitious tasks.<template><target>cn</target><arg name="date">October 2015</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>It is widely accepted that the division of labour is to a great extent inevitable, simply because no one can do all tasks at once. Labour<space/><link><target>hierarchy</target></link><space/>is a very common feature of the modern workplace structure, but of course the way these hierarchies are structured can be influenced by a variety of different factors.</paragraph><paragraph>Size, cost, and the development of new technology are factors that have influenced job specialization structures in the modern workplace. The cost of job specialization is what limits small organizations from dividing their labour responsibilities, but as organizations increase in size there is a correlation in the rise of division of labour. Technological developments have led to a decrease in the amount of job specialization in organizations as new technology makes it easier for fewer employees to accomplish a variety of tasks and still enhance production. New technology has also been supportive in the flow of information between departments helping to reduce the feeling of department isolation.<extension extension_name='ref' name="autogenerated2007"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>It is often agreed that the most equitable principle in allocating people within hierarchies is that of true (or proven) competency or ability.

Different people try different things, and that which is most effective cost-wise (produces the most and best output with the least input) will generally be adopted. Often techniques that work in one place or time do not work as well in another.

This is because it is by exchange that each person can be specialised in their work and yet still have access to a wide range of goods and services. Hence, reductions in barriers to exchange lead to increases in the division of labour and so help to drive economic growth. Limitations to the division of labour have also been related to coordination and transportation costs.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-6435.1956.tb02717.x'></link>, Houthakker, H.S.

For instance, one stage of a production process may temporarily work at a slower pace, forcing other stages to slow down. One answer to this is to make some portion of resources mobile between stages, so that those resources must be capable of undertaking a wider range of tasks. Another is to consolidate tasks so that they are undertaken one after another by the same workers and other resources. Stocks between stages can also help to reduce the problem to some extent but are costly and can hamper quality control. Note also that modern<space/><link><target>flexible manufacturing system</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>require both flexible machines and flexible workers.</paragraph><paragraph>In project-based work, the coordination of resources is a difficult issue for the<space/><link><target>project manager</target></link><space/>as project<space/><link><target>Schedule (project management)</target><part>schedules</part></link><space/>and resulting resource bookings are based on<space/><link><target>Estimation (project management)</target><part>estimates</part></link><space/>of task durations and so are subject to subsequent revisions. Again, consolidating tasks so that they are undertaken consecutively by the same resources and having resources available that can be called on at short-notice from other tasks can help to reduce such problems, though at the cost of reduced specialisation.</paragraph><paragraph>There are also advantages in a reduced division of labour where knowledge would otherwise have to be transferred between stages.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2003.07.015'></link>, Rummel, J.L., Walter, Z., Dewan, R. and Seidmann, A.
