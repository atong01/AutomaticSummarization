'''JavaScript''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɑː|v|ə|ˌ|s|k|r|ɪ|p|t}}<ref>{{cite web | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/javascript | title=JavaScript | publisher=William Collins Sons & Co | work=Collins English Dictionary - Complete & Unabridged 2012 Digital Edition | date=2012 | accessdate=21 August 2015}}</ref>) is a [[High-level programming language|high-level]], [[dynamic programming language|dynamic]], [[Programming language#Type system|untyped]], and [[Interpreted language|interpreted]] programming language.{{Sfn|Flanagan|2011|p=1}} It has been standardized in the [[ECMAScript]] language specification.{{Sfn|Flanagan|2011|p=2}} Alongside [[HTML]] and [[CSS]], it is one of the three essential technologies of [[World Wide Web]] content production; the majority of [[website]]s employ it and it is supported by all modern [[web browser]]s without [[Browser extension|plug-ins]].{{Sfn|Flanagan|2011|p=1}} JavaScript is [[Prototype-based programming|prototype-based]] with [[first-class functions]], making it a [[multi-paradigm]] language, supporting [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]],<ref name="ECMA-262">{{cite web | url=http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-262.pdf | title= ECMAScript Language Specification }}</ref> [[imperative programming|imperative]], and [[functional programming|functional]] programming styles.{{Sfn|Flanagan|2011|p=1}} It has an [[Application programming interface|API]] for working with text, [[Array data type|arrays]], dates and [[regular expression]]s, but does not include any [[Input/output|I/O]], such as networking, storage or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.{{Sfn|Flanagan|2011|p=2}}

Despite some naming, [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntactic]], and [[standard library]] similarities, JavaScript and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] are otherwise unrelated and have very different [[Semantics (computer science)|semantics]]. The syntax of JavaScript is actually derived from [[C (programming language)|C]], while the semantics and design are influenced by the [[Self (programming language)|Self]] and [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] programming languages.<ref>{{cite web | title=ECMAScript Language Overview|url=http://www.ecmascript.org/es4/spec/overview.pdf|format=PDF|page=4|date=2007-10-23|accessdate=2009-05-03}}</ref>

JavaScript is also used in environments that are not web-based, such as [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] documents, [[site-specific browser]]s, and [[desktop widget]]s. Newer and faster JavaScript [[virtual machine]]s (VMs) and platforms built upon them have also increased the popularity of JavaScript for server-side [[web application]]s. On the client side, JavaScript has been traditionally implemented as an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreted]] language, but more recent browsers perform [[just-in-time compilation]]. It is also used in game development, the creation of desktop and mobile applications, and server-side network programming with runtime environments such as [[Node.js]].

==History==

===Beginnings at Netscape===
JavaScript was originally developed in 10 days in May 1995 by [[Brendan Eich]], while he was working for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]]. Indeed, while competing with [[Microsoft]] for user adoption of web technologies and platforms, Netscape considered their client-server offering a distributed OS with a portable version of [[Sun Microsystems]]' Java providing an environment in which [[Java applet|applets]] could be run.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} Because Java was a competitor of [[C++]] and aimed at professional programmers, Netscape also wanted a lightweight [[interpreted language]] that would complement Java by appealing to nonprofessional programmers, like Microsoft's Visual Basic  (see [[#JavaScript and Java|JavaScript and Java]]).<ref>{{cite journal | last=Severance | first=Charles | date=February 2012 | title=JavaScript: Designing a Language in 10 Days | journal=Computer | volume=45 | issue=2 | pages=7–8 | publisher=IEEE Computer Society | url=http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/co/2012/02/mco2012020007-abs.html | accessdate=23 March 2013 | doi=10.1109/MC.2012.57 }}</ref>

Although it was developed under the name '''Mocha''', the language was officially called '''LiveScript''' when it first shipped in beta releases of Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995, but it was renamed JavaScript<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070916144913/http://wp.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease67.html Press release announcing JavaScript], "Netscape and Sun announce JavaScript", PR Newswire, December 4, 1995</ref> when it was deployed in the Netscape browser version 2.0B3.<ref name="techvision">{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208124612/http://wp.netscape.com/comprod/columns/techvision/innovators_be.html | archivedate=2008-02-08 | title=TechVision: Innovators of the Net: Brendan Eich and JavaScript | publisher=web.archive.org | url=http://wp.netscape.com/comprod/columns/techvision/innovators_be.html }}</ref>

The change of name from LiveScript to JavaScript roughly coincided with Netscape adding support for Java technology in its [[Netscape Navigator]] web browser. The final choice of name caused confusion, giving the impression that the language was a spin-off of the Java programming language, and the choice has been characterized as a marketing ploy by Netscape to give JavaScript the cachet of what was then the hot new web programming language.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.webdevelopersnotes.com/basics/languages_on_the_internet.php3 | title=Programming languages used on the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW) | publisher=webdevelopersnotes.com | accessdate=2009-05-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://safari.oreilly.com/0596101996/jscript5-CHP-1 | title=O'Reilly - Safari Books Online - 0596101996 - JavaScript: The Definitive Guide, 5th Edition | publisher=Safari.oreilly.com | accessdate=2009-05-19}}</ref>

There is a common misconception that the JavaScript language was influenced by an earlier web page scripting language developed by [[Openwave|Nombas]] named C--, not to be confused with the later [[C--]] created in 1997.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://oreilly.com/news/languageposter_0504.html | title=The History of Programming Languages - O'Reilly Media | publisher=Oreilly.com | accessdate=2014-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.brenkoweb.com/articles/world-wide-web/web-design-software/history-of-javascript.php | title=History of JavaScript, ©Brenkoweb | publisher=Brenkoweb.com | accessdate=2014-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/88/07645790/0764579088.pdf | title=What Is JavaScript? | publisher=media.wiley.com | accessdate=2014-04-21}}</ref> Brendan Eich, however, had never heard of C-- before he created LiveScript.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.quora.com/Brent-Noorda/answers/ECMA | title=Brent Noorda's Answers on ECMA | publisher=Quora | accessdate=2014-04-13}}</ref> Nombas did pitch their embedded web page scripting to Netscape, though web page scripting was not a new concept, as shown by [[ViolaWWW]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.brent-noorda.com/nombas/history/HistoryOfNombas.html#h.yal3k216ii2r | title=History of Nombas | publisher=Brent-noorda.com | date=2010-06-24 | accessdate=2014-04-13}}</ref> Nombas later switched to offering JavaScript instead of C-- in their ScriptEase product and was part of the TC39 group that standardized [[ECMAScript]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://brendaneich.com/2011/06/new-javascript-engine-module-owner/ | title=New JavaScript Engine Module Owner | publisher=Brendan Eich | date=2011-06-21 | accessdate=2014-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://read.uberflip.com/i/113144/44 | title=Tech - JavaScript for Web Developers | publisher=Read.uberflip.com | accessdate=2014-04-13}}</ref>

===Server-side JavaScript===
Netscape introduced an implementation of the language for [[server-side scripting]] with [[Netscape Enterprise Server]] in December, 1995, soon after releasing JavaScript for browsers.<ref name = "Newscape JavaScript Guide-1998">{{cite web | title=Server-Side JavaScript Guide|publisher=Netscape Communications Corporation |year=1998 |url=http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/816-6411-10/getstart.htm|accessdate=2012-04-25}}</ref><ref name = "Morgan-Netcape LiveWire">{{cite web | title=Using Netscape™ LiveWire™, Special Edition | author=Mike Morgan |url=http://vampire.rulez.org/onlinedoc/book/NetscapeLiveWire/ch6.htm |year=1996 |publisher=Que }}</ref>
Since the mid-2000s, there has been a resurgence of [[Comparison of server-side JavaScript solutions|server-side JavaScript implementations]], such as Node.js.<ref name="RWW-Server-Side-2009-12-17">{{cite web | title = Server-Side JavaScript Back With a Vengeance | work = Read Write Web | date = December 17, 2009 | accessdate = May 28, 2012 | url = http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/server-side_javascript_back_with_a_vengeance.php }}</ref><ref name="node.js-about">{{cite web | url=http://nodejs.org/about/ | title  = Node's goal is to provide an easy way to build scalable network programs | work = About Node.js | publisher = Joyent}}</ref>

===Adoption by Microsoft===
[[Microsoft Windows]] script technologies including [[VBScript]] and [[JScript]] were released in 1996. JScript, a port of Netscape's JavaScript, was released on July 16, 1996 and was part of [[Internet Explorer 3]], as well as being available server-side in [[Internet Information Server]]. IE3 also included Microsoft's first support for [[Cascading Style Sheets]] and various extensions to HTML, but in each case the implementation was noticeably different to that found in [[Netscape Navigator]] at the time.<ref name="O'Reilly-2001">{{cite web|last1=Champeon|first1=Steve|title=JavaScript: How Did We Get Here?|url=http://archive.oreilly.com/pub/a/javascript/2001/04/06/js_history.html|publisher=O'Reilly Media|accessdate=9 March 2015|date=4 June 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 Beta Now Available|url=http://news.microsoft.com/1996/05/29/microsoft-internet-explorer-3-0-beta-now-available/|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=9 March 2015|date=29 May 1996}}</ref> These differences made it difficult for designers and programmers to make a single website work well in both browsers leading to the use of 'best viewed in Netscape' and 'best viewed in Internet Explorer' logos that characterised these early years of the [[browser wars]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=McCracken|first1=Harry|title=The Unwelcome Return of "Best Viewed With Internet Explorer"|url=http://www.technologizer.com/2010/09/16/the-unwelcome-return-of-best-viewed-with-internet-explorer/|publisher=Technologizer|accessdate=9 March 2015|date=16 September 2010}}</ref> JavaScript began to acquire a reputation for being one of the roadblocks to a cross-platform and standards-driven web. Some developers took on the difficult task of trying to make their sites work in both major browsers, but many could not afford the time.<ref name="O'Reilly-2001"/> With the release of [[Internet Explorer 4]], Microsoft introduced the concept of [[Dynamic HTML]], but the differences in language implementations and the different and proprietary [[Document Object Model]]s remained, and were obstacles to widespread take-up of JavaScript on the web.<ref name="O'Reilly-2001"/>

===Standardization===
In November 1996, Netscape announced that it had submitted JavaScript to [[Ecma International]] for consideration as an industry standard, and subsequent work resulted in the standardized version named [[ECMAScript]]. In June 1997, [[Ecma International]] published the first edition of the [[ECMA-262]] [[specification]]. In June 1998, some modifications were made to adapt it to the ISO/IEC-16262 standard, and the second edition was released. The third edition of [[ECMA-262]] was published on December 1999.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-262.pdf | title=ECMAScript 3rd Edition specification | format=PDF | accessdate=2013-05-26}}</ref>

Development of the fourth edition of the ECMAScript standard was never completed.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ecmascript.org/docs.php | title=Documentation | publisher=ECMAScript | accessdate=2014-04-13}}</ref> The fifth edition was released in December 2009. The current edition of the ECMAScript standard is 6, released in June 2015.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-262.pdf | title=Standard ECMA-262 | format=PDF | accessdate=2015-06-18}}</ref>

===Later developments===
JavaScript has become one of the most popular programming languages on the Web. Initially, however, many professional programmers denigrated the language because its target audience consisted of Web authors and other such "amateurs", among other reasons.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.crockford.com/javascript/javascript.html | title=JavaScript: The World's Most Misunderstood Programming Language | publisher=Crockford.com | accessdate=2009-05-19}}</ref> The advent of [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] returned JavaScript to the spotlight and brought more professional programming attention. The result was a proliferation of comprehensive [[List of JavaScript libraries|frameworks and libraries]], improved JavaScript programming practices, and increased usage of JavaScript outside Web browsers, as seen by the proliferation of [[server-side JavaScript]] platforms.

In January 2009, the [[CommonJS]] project was founded with the goal of specifying a common standard library mainly for JavaScript development outside the browser.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://arstechnica.com/web/news/2009/12/commonjs-effort-sets-javascript-on-path-for-world-domination.ars | title=CommonJS effort sets JavaScript on path for World domination | author=Kris Kowal | date=1 December 2009 | work=[[Ars Technica]] | publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications]] | accessdate=18 April 2010}}</ref>

With the rise of the single-page web app and JavaScript-heavy sites, it is increasingly being used as a compile target for [[source-to-source compiler]]s from both [[dynamic typing|dynamic languages]] and [[static typing|static languages]]. In particular, [[Emscripten]] and highly optimized [[just-in-time compiler|JIT compilers]], in tandem with [[asm.js]] that is friendly to [[ahead-of-time compilation|AOT compilers]] like [[OdinMonkey]], have enabled [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] programs to be compiled into JavaScript and execute at near-native speeds, causing JavaScript to be considered the "assembly language of the web",<ref name=asm.js>{{cite web | url=http://www.hanselman.com/blog/JavaScriptisAssemblyLanguagefortheWebPart2MadnessorjustInsanity.aspx | title=JavaScript is Assembly Language for the Web: Part 2 - Madness or just Insanity? | first=Scott | last=Hanselman | date=July 19, 2011}}</ref> according to its creator and others.

==Features==
The following features are common to all conforming ECMAScript implementations, unless explicitly specified otherwise.

===Imperative and structured===
JavaScript supports much of the [[structured programming]] syntax from [[C (computer language)|C]] (e.g., <tt>if</tt> statements, <tt>while</tt> loops, <tt>switch</tt> statements, <tt>do while</tt> loops, etc.). One partial exception is [[scope (computer science)|scoping]]: JavaScript originally had only [[function scoping]] with <tt>var</tt>. ECMAScript 2015 adds a <tt>let</tt> keyword for block scoping, meaning JavaScript now has both function and block scoping. Like C, JavaScript makes a distinction between [[Expression (computer science)|expressions]] and [[Statement (computer science)|statements]]. One syntactic difference from C is [[Defensive semicolon|automatic semicolon insertion]], which allows the semicolons that would normally terminate statements to be omitted.{{Sfn|Flanagan|2006|p=16}}

===Dynamic===
; Dynamic typing: As in most [[scripting language]]s, [[type system|types]] are associated with [[value (computer science)|values]], not with [[Variable (programming)|variables]]. For example, a variable {{mono|x}} could be bound to a number, then later rebound to a [[string (computer science)|string]]. JavaScript supports various ways to test the type of an object, including [[duck typing]].{{Sfn|Flanagan|2006|pp=176–178}}
; Object-based: JavaScript is almost entirely [[object-based]]. JavaScript [[Object (computer science)|objects]] are [[associative array]]s, augmented with prototypes (see below). Object property names are string keys. They support two equivalent syntaxes: dot notation (<code>obj.x&nbsp;=&nbsp;10</code>) and bracket notation (<code>obj['x']&nbsp;=&nbsp;10</code>). Properties and their values can be added, changed, or deleted at run-time. Most properties of an object (and those on its prototype inheritance chain) can be enumerated using a <code>for...in</code> loop. JavaScript has a small number of built-in objects such as {{mono|Function}} and {{mono|Date}}.
; Run-time evaluation: JavaScript includes an <code>[[eval]]</code> function that can execute statements provided as strings at run-time.

===Functional===
; First-class functions: [[Subroutine|Functions]] are [[first-class function|first-class]]; they are objects themselves. As such, they have properties and methods, such as <tt>.call()</tt> and <tt>.bind()</tt>.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://es5.github.com/#x15.3.4-toc | title=Properties of the Function Object | publisher=Es5.github.com | accessdate=2013-05-26}}</ref> A ''nested'' function is a function defined within another function. It is created each time the outer function is invoked. In addition, each created function forms a [[Closure (computer science)|lexical closure]]: the [[Scope (programming)#Lexical scoping vs. dynamic scoping|lexical scope]] of the outer function, including any constants, local variables and argument values, becomes part of the internal state of each inner function object, even after execution of the outer function concludes.{{Sfn|Flanagan|2006|p=141}} JavaScript also supports [[anonymous function]]s.

===Prototype-based object-oriented programming===
; Prototypes: JavaScript uses [[prototype-based programming|prototypes]] where many other object-oriented languages use [[Class (computer science)|classes]] for [[Inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Inheritance and the prototype chain|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain|work=Mozilla Developer Network|publisher=[[Mozilla]]|accessdate=6 April 2013}}</ref> It is possible to simulate many class-based features with prototypes in JavaScript.<ref>{{cite book|last=Herman|first=David|title=Effective JavaScript|year=2013|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=9780321812186|page=83}}</ref>
; Functions as object constructors: Functions double as object constructors along with their typical role. Prefixing a function call with <tt>new</tt> will create an instance of a prototype, inheriting properties and methods from the constructor (including properties from the <tt>Object</tt> prototype).<ref>{{cite book|last=Haverbeke|first=Marjin|title=Eloquent JavaScript|year=2011|publisher=No Starch Press|isbn=9781593272821|pages=95–97}}</ref> ECMAScript 5 offers the <tt>Object.create</tt> method, allowing explicit creation of an instance without automatically inheriting from the <tt>Object</tt> prototype (older environments can assign the prototype to <tt>null</tt>).<ref>{{cite web | last=Katz|first=Yehuda|title=Understanding "Prototypes" in JavaScript|url=http://yehudakatz.com/2011/08/12/understanding-prototypes-in-javascript/|accessdate=6 April 2013}}</ref> The constructor's <tt>prototype</tt> property determines the object used for the new object's internal prototype. New methods can be added by modifying the prototype of the function used as a constructor. JavaScript's built-in constructors, such as <tt>Array</tt> or <tt>Object</tt>, also have prototypes that can be modified. While it is possible to modify the <tt>Object</tt> prototype, it is generally considered bad practice because most objects in JavaScript will inherit methods and properties from the <tt>Object</tt> prototype and they may not expect the prototype to be modified.<ref>{{cite book|last=Herman|first=David|title=Effective JavaScript|year=2013|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=9780321812186|pages=125–127}}</ref>
; Functions as methods<!--not sure where to classify this under-->: Unlike many object-oriented languages, there is no distinction between a function definition and a [[method (computer science)|method]] definition. Rather, the distinction occurs during function calling; when a function is called as a method of an object, the function's local <em>this</em> keyword is bound to that object for that invocation.

===Implicit and explicit delegation===
JavaScript is a [[Delegation (programming)|delegation language]].

; Functions as Roles (Traits and Mixins): JavaScript natively supports various function-based implementations of [[Role-oriented programming|Role]]<ref>[http://peterseliger.blogspot.de/2014/04/the-many-talents-of-javascript.html#the-many-talents-of-javascript-for-generalizing-role-oriented-programming-approaches-like-traits-and-mixins The many talents of JavaScript for generalizing Role-Oriented Programming approaches like Traits and Mixins], April 11, 2014.</ref> patterns like [[Traits (computer science)|Traits]]<ref>[http://soft.vub.ac.be/~tvcutsem/traitsjs/ Traits for JavaScript], 2010.</ref><ref>[http://cocktailjs.github.io/ CocktailJS - ANNOTATIONS. TRAITS. TALENTS.], April 2013.</ref> and [[Mixin]]s.<ref>Angus Croll, [http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2011/05/31/a-fresh-look-at-javascript-mixins/ A fresh look at JavaScript Mixins], published May 31, 2011.</ref><ref>[https://github.com/petsel/javascript-code-reuse-patterns/tree/master/source/components/composition/ JavaScript Code Reuse Patterns], April 19, 2013.</ref> Such a function defines additional behavior by at least one method bound to the <tt>this</tt> keyword within its <tt>function</tt> body. A Role then has to be delegated explicitly via <tt>call</tt> or <tt>apply</tt> to objects that need to feature additional behavior that is not shared via the prototype chain.
; Object Composition and Inheritance: Whereas explicit function-based delegation does cover [[Object composition|composition]] in JavaScript, implicit delegation already happens every time the prototype chain is walked in order to, e.g., find a method that might be related to but is not directly owned by an object. Once the method is found it gets called within this object's context. Thus [[Inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]] in JavaScript is covered by a delegation automatism that is bound to the prototype property of constructor functions.

===Miscellaneous===
; Run-time environment: JavaScript typically relies on a run-time environment (e.g., a [[Web browser]]) to provide objects and methods by which scripts can interact with the environment (e.g., a webpage DOM). It also relies on the run-time environment to provide the ability to include/import scripts (e.g., [[HTML]] <code><nowiki><script></nowiki></code> elements). This is not a language feature per se, but it is common in most JavaScript implementations.

: JavaScript processes [[Message (computer science)|messages]] from a [[Queue (abstract data type)|queue]] one at a time. Upon loading a new message, JavaScript calls a [[Subroutine|function]] associated with that message, which creates a [[call stack]] frame (the function's [[Parameter (computer programming)|arguments]] and [[Local variable|local variables]]). The call stack shrinks and grows based on the function's needs. Upon function completion, when the stack is empty, JavaScript proceeds to the next message in the queue. This is called the [[event loop]], described as "run to completion" because each message is fully processed before the next message is considered. However, the language's [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrency model]] describes the event loop as [[Asynchronous I/O|non-blocking]]: program [[input/output]] is performed using [[Event (computing)|events]] and [[Callback (computer programming)|callback functions]]. This means, for instance, that JavaScript can process a mouse click while waiting for a database query to return information.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Concurrency model and Event Loop|url = https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop|website = Mozilla Developer Network|accessdate = 2015-08-28}}</ref>

; Variadic functions<!--note: this is not a functional programming feature-->: An indefinite number of parameters can be passed to a function. The function can access them through [[formal parameter]]s and also through the local {{mono|arguments}} object. [[Variadic functions]] can also be created by using the <code>[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind bind]</code> method.

; Array and object literals: Like many scripting languages, arrays and objects ([[associative arrays]] in other languages) can each be created with a succinct shortcut syntax. In fact, these [[Object literal|literals]] form the basis of the [[JSON]] data format.

; Regular expressions: JavaScript also supports [[regular expression]]s in a manner similar to [[Perl]], which provide a concise and powerful syntax for text manipulation that is more sophisticated than the built-in string functions.<ref>{{cite book | last=Haverbeke | first=Marijn | title=Eloquent JavaScript | year=2011 | publisher=No Starch Press|isbn=978-1593272821|pages=139–149}}</ref>

===Vendor-specific extensions===
JavaScript is officially managed by [[Mozilla Foundation]], and new language features are added periodically. However, only some [[JavaScript engine]]s support these new features:

* property getter and setter functions (supported by WebKit, Gecko, Opera,<ref>Robert Nyman, [http://robertnyman.com/2009/05/28/getters-and-setters-with-javascript-code-samples-and-demos/ Getters And Setters With JavaScript - Code Samples And Demos], published 29 May 2009, accessed 2 January 2010.</ref> ActionScript, and Rhino)<ref>John Resig, [http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-getters-and-setters/ JavaScript Getters and Setters], 18 July 2007, accessed 2 January 2010</ref>
* conditional <tt>catch</tt> clauses
* iterator protocol (adopted from [[Python (programming language)|Python]])
* shallow [[generator (computer programming)|generators]]-[[coroutine]]s (adopted from Python)
* [[List comprehension|array comprehensions]] and generator expressions (adopted from Python)
* proper block scope via the <tt>let</tt> keyword
* array and object destructuring (limited form of [[pattern matching]])
* concise function expressions (<tt>function(args) expr</tt>)
* [[ECMAScript for XML]] (E4X), an extension that adds native XML support to ECMAScript (unsupported in Firefox since version 21<ref>{{cite web | title=E4X - Archive of obsolete content &#124; MDN|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/Web/E4X|website=Mozilla Developer Network|publisher=Mozilla Foundation|date=Feb 14, 2014|accessdate=13 July 2014}}</ref>)

==Syntax==
{{Main|JavaScript syntax}}

===Simple examples===
[[Variable (computer science)|Variables]] in JavaScript can be defined using the <tt>var</tt> keyword:<ref>{{cite web | url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var | title=var - JavaScript - MDN | publisher=The [[Mozilla Developer Network]] | accessdate=22 December 2012}}</ref>

<syntaxhighlight lang="javascript">
var x; // defines the variable x, the special value “undefined” (not to be confused with an undefined value) is assigned to it by default
var y = 2; // defines the variable y and assigns the value of 2 to it
</syntaxhighlight>

Note the [[Comment (computer programming)|comments]] in the example above, both of which were preceded with two [[Slash (punctuation)|forward slashes]].

There is no built-in [[Input/output|I/O]] functionality in JavaScript; the run-time environment provides that. The ECMAScript specification in edition 5.1 mentions:<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-4 | title=ECMAScript Language Specification - ECMA-262 Edition 5.1|publisher=[[Ecma International]] | accessdate=22 December 2012}}</ref>
<blockquote>... indeed, there are no provisions in this specification for input of external data or output of computed results.</blockquote>
However, most runtime environments have a <tt>console</tt> object<ref>{{cite web | title=console|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/console|work=Mozilla Developer Network|publisher=[[Mozilla]]|accessdate=6 April 2013}}</ref> that can be used to print output. Here is a minimalist [[Hello World program]]:

<syntaxhighlight lang="javascript">
console.log("Hello World!");
</syntaxhighlight>

A simple [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive]] function:
<syntaxhighlight lang="javascript">
function factorial(n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        return 1;
    }
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
</syntaxhighlight>

[[Anonymous function]] (or lambda) syntax and [[Closure (Computer Science)|closure]] example:
<syntaxhighlight lang="javascript">
var displayClosure = function() {
    var count = 0;
    return function () {
        return ++count;
    };
}
var inc = displayClosure();
inc(); // returns 1
inc(); // returns 2
inc(); // returns 3
</syntaxhighlight>

[[Variadic function]] demonstration (<tt>arguments</tt> is a special [[variable (programming)|variable]]).<ref>{{cite web | title=arguments|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/arguments|work=Mozilla Developer Network|publisher=[[Mozilla]]|accessdate=6 April 2013}}</ref>
<syntaxhighlight lang="javascript">
var sum = function() {
    var i, x = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < arguments.length; ++i) {
        x += arguments[i];
    }
    return x;
}
sum(1, 2, 3); // returns 6
</syntaxhighlight>

[[Immediately-invoked function expression]]s allow functions to pass around variables under their own closures.

<syntaxhighlight lang="JavaScript">
var v;
v = 1;
var getValue = (function(v) {
  return function() {return v;};
})(v);

v = 2;

getValue(); // 1
</syntaxhighlight>

==Use in web pages==
{{See also|Dynamic HTML|Ajax (programming)}}

The most common use of JavaScript is to add client-side behavior to [[HTML]] pages, a.k.a. [[Dynamic HTML]] (DHTML). Scripts are embedded in or included from [[HTML]] pages and interact with the [[Document Object Model]] (DOM) of the page. Some simple examples of this usage are:

* Loading new page content or submitting data to the server via [[AJAX]] without reloading the page (for example, a social network might allow the user to post status updates without leaving the page)
* Animation of page elements, fading them in and out, resizing them, moving them, etc.
* Interactive content, for example games, and playing audio and video
* [[Data validation|Validating]] input values of a [[Form (HTML)|Web form]] to make sure that they are acceptable before being submitted to the server.
* Transmitting information about the user's reading habits and browsing activities to various websites. Web pages frequently do this for [[web analytics]], [[ad tracking]], [[personalization]] or other purposes.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://piwik.org/docs/javascript-tracking/ | title=JavaScript tracking - Piwik | publisher=[[Piwik]] | accessdate=31 March 2012<!-- 17:56 (UTC)-->}}</ref>

Because JavaScript code can run locally in a user's browser (rather than on a remote server), the browser can respond to user actions quickly, making an application more responsive. Furthermore, JavaScript code can detect user actions that HTML alone cannot, such as individual keystrokes. Applications such as [[Gmail]] take advantage of this: much of the user-interface logic is written in JavaScript, and JavaScript dispatches requests for information (such as the content of an e-mail message) to the server. The wider trend of [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] programming similarly exploits this strength.

A [[JavaScript engine]] (also known as ''JavaScript interpreter'' or ''JavaScript implementation'') is an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] that interprets JavaScript [[source code]] and executes the [[computer program|script]] accordingly. The first JavaScript engine was created by [[Brendan Eich]] at [[Netscape Communications Corporation]], for the [[Netscape Navigator]] [[web browser]]. The engine, code-named [[SpiderMonkey (JavaScript engine)|SpiderMonkey]], is implemented in [[C (programming language)|C]]. It has since been updated (in JavaScript 1.5) to conform to ECMA-262 Edition 3. The [[Rhino (JavaScript engine)|Rhino]] engine, created primarily by Norris Boyd (formerly of Netscape; now at Google) is a JavaScript implementation in [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. Rhino, like SpiderMonkey, is ECMA-262 Edition 3 compliant.

A web browser is by far the most common host environment for JavaScript. Web browsers typically create "host objects" to represent the [[Document Object Model]] (DOM) in JavaScript. The [[web server]] is another common host environment. A [[Server-side JavaScript|JavaScript web server]] would typically expose host objects representing [[HTTP]] request and response objects, which a JavaScript program could then interrogate and manipulate to dynamically generate web pages.

Because JavaScript is the only language that the most popular browsers share support for, it has become a [[target language (computing)|target language]] for many frameworks in other languages, even though JavaScript was never intended to be such a language.<ref name="computerworld">{{cite web | last=Hamilton|first=Naomi|url=http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/255293/-z_programming_languages_javascript|title=The A-Z of Programming Languages: JavaScript|publisher=computerworld.com.au|date=2008-07-31}}</ref> Despite the performance limitations inherent to its dynamic nature, the increasing speed of JavaScript engines has made the language a surprisingly feasible compilation target.

===Example script===
Below is a minimal example of a standards-conforming web page containing JavaScript (using [[HTML|HTML 5]] syntax) and the [[Document object model|DOM]]:

<syntaxhighlight lang="html5">
<!DOCTYPE html>

<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Minimal Example</title>

<h1 id="header">This is JavaScript</h1>

<script>
    document.body.appendChild(document.createTextNode('Hello World!'));

    var h1 = document.getElementById('header'); // holds a reference to the <h1> tag
    h1 = document.getElementsByTagName('h1')[0]; // accessing the same <h1> element
</script>

<noscript>Your browser either does not support JavaScript, or has it turned off.</noscript>
</syntaxhighlight>

===Compatibility considerations===
{{Main|Web interoperability}}

Because JavaScript runs in widely varying environments, an important part of testing and debugging is to test and verify that the JavaScript works across multiple browsers.

The DOM interfaces for manipulating web pages are not part of the ECMAScript standard, or of JavaScript itself. Officially, the DOM interfaces are defined by a separate standardization effort by the [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]]; in practice, browser implementations differ from the standards and from each other, and not all browsers execute JavaScript.

To deal with these differences, JavaScript authors can attempt to write standards-compliant code that will also be executed correctly by most browsers; failing that, they can write code that checks for the presence of certain browser features and behaves differently if they are not available.<ref>Peter-Paul Koch, [http://www.quirksmode.org/js/support.html Object detection]</ref> In some cases, two browsers may both implement a feature but with different behavior, and authors may find it practical to detect what browser is running and change their script's behavior to match.<ref>Peter-Paul Koch, [http://www.evolt.org/node/23335 Mission Impossible - mouse position]</ref><ref>Peter-Paul Koch, [http://www.quirksmode.org/js/detect.html Browser detect]</ref> Programmers may also use libraries or toolkits that take browser differences into account.

Furthermore, scripts may not work for some users. For example, a user may:

* use an old or rare browser with incomplete or unusual DOM support,
* use a [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] or [[mobile phone]] browser that cannot execute JavaScript,
* have JavaScript execution disabled as a security precaution,
* use a speech browser due to, for example, a visual disability.

To support these users, Web authors can try to create pages that [[Fault-tolerant system|degrade gracefully]] on user agents (browsers) that do not support the page's JavaScript. In particular, the page should remain usable albeit without the extra features that the JavaScript would have added. An alternative approach that many find preferable is to first author content using basic technologies that work in all browsers, then enhance the content for users that have JavaScript enabled. This is known as [[progressive enhancement]].

==Security==
{{See also|Browser security}}

JavaScript and the DOM provide the potential for malicious authors to deliver scripts to run on a client computer via the Web. Browser authors contain this risk using two restrictions. First, scripts run in a [[Sandbox (computer security)|sandbox]] in which they can only perform Web-related actions, not general-purpose programming tasks like creating files. Second, scripts are constrained by the [[same origin policy]]: scripts from one Web site do not have access to information such as usernames, passwords, or cookies sent to another site. Most JavaScript-related security bugs are breaches of either the same origin policy or the sandbox.

There are subsets of general JavaScript — ADsafe, Secure ECMA Script (SES) — that provide greater level of security, especially on code created by third parties (such as advertisements).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.adsafe.org/ | title=Making JavaScript Safe for Advertising | publisher=ADsafe | accessdate=2013-05-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://code.google.com/p/es-lab/wiki/SecureEcmaScript | title=Secure ECMA Script (SES) | publisher=Code.google.com | accessdate=2013-05-26}}</ref>

[[Content Security Policy]] is the main intended method of ensuring that only trusted code is executed on a web page.

{{see also|Content Security Policy}}

===Cross-site vulnerabilities===
{{Main|Cross-site scripting|Cross-site request forgery}}

A common JavaScript-related security problem is [[cross-site scripting]], or XSS, a violation of the [[same origin policy|same-origin policy]]. XSS vulnerabilities occur when an attacker is able to cause a target Web site, such as an online banking website, to include a malicious script in the webpage presented to a victim. The script in this example can then access the banking application with the privileges of the victim, potentially disclosing secret information or transferring money without the victim's authorization. A solution to XSS vulnerabilities is to use ''HTML escaping'' whenever displaying untrusted data.

Some browsers include partial protection against ''reflected'' XSS attacks, in which the attacker provides a URL including malicious script. However, even users of those browsers are vulnerable to other XSS attacks, such as those where the malicious code is stored in a database. Only correct design of Web applications on the server side can fully prevent XSS.

XSS vulnerabilities can also occur because of implementation mistakes by browser authors.<ref>MozillaZine, [http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=4392 Mozilla Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability Reported and Fixed]</ref>

Another cross-site vulnerability is [[cross-site request forgery]] or CSRF. In CSRF, code on an attacker's site tricks the victim's browser into taking actions the user didn't intend at a target site (like transferring money at a bank). It works because, if the target site relies only on cookies to authenticate requests, then requests initiated by code on the attacker's site will carry the same legitimate login credentials as requests initiated by the user. In general, the solution to CSRF is to require an authentication value in a hidden form field, and not only in the cookies, to authenticate any request that might have lasting effects. Checking the HTTP Referrer header can also help.

"JavaScript hijacking" is a type of CSRF attack in which a <code><nowiki><script></nowiki></code> tag on an attacker's site exploits a page on the victim's site that returns private information such as JSON or JavaScript. Possible solutions include:

* requiring an authentication token in the [[POST (HTTP)|POST]] and [[GET (HTTP)|GET]] parameters for any response that returns private information

====Misplaced trust in the client====
Developers of client-server applications must recognize that untrusted clients may be under the control of attackers. The application author cannot assume that his JavaScript code will run as intended (or at all) because any secret embedded in the code could be extracted by a determined adversary. Some implications are:

* Web site authors cannot perfectly conceal how their JavaScript operates because the raw source code must be sent to the client. The code can be [[obfuscated code|obfuscated]], but obfuscation can be reverse-engineered.
* JavaScript form validation only provides convenience for users, not security. If a site verifies that the user agreed to its terms of service, or filters invalid characters out of fields that should only contain numbers, it must do so on the server, not only the client.
* Scripts can be selectively disabled, so JavaScript can't be relied on to prevent operations such as right-clicking on an image to save it.<ref>

 | accessdate = 2008-06-17 }}
</ref>
* It is extremely bad practice to embed sensitive information such as passwords in JavaScript because it can be extracted by an attacker.

====Browser and plugin coding errors====
JavaScript provides an interface to a wide range of browser capabilities, some of which may have flaws such as [[buffer overflow]]s. These flaws can allow attackers to write scripts that would run any code they wish on the user's system. This code is not by any means limited to another JavaScript application. For example, a buffer overrun exploit can allow an attacker to gain access to the operating system's API with superuser privileges.

These flaws have affected major browsers including Firefox,<ref>Mozilla Corporation, [http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2006/mfsa2006-38.html Buffer overflow in crypto.signText()]</ref> Internet Explorer,<ref>Paul Festa, CNet, [http://archive.is/20120724070835/http://news.com.com/2100-1001-214620.html Buffer-overflow bug in IE]</ref> and Safari.<ref>SecurityTracker.com, [http://securitytracker.com/alerts/2006/Mar/1015713.html Apple Safari JavaScript Buffer Overflow Lets Remote Users Execute Arbitrary Code and HTTP Redirect Bug Lets Remote Users Access Files]</ref>

Plugins, such as video players, [[Adobe Flash#Flash client security|Adobe Flash]], and the wide range of [[ActiveX]] controls enabled by default in Microsoft Internet Explorer, may also have flaws exploitable via JavaScript (such flaws have been exploited in the past).<ref>SecurityFocus, [http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/19030/info Microsoft WebViewFolderIcon ActiveX Control Buffer Overflow Vulnerability]</ref><ref>Fusion Authority, [http://www.fusionauthority.com/security/3234-macromedia-flash-activex-buffer-overflow.htm Macromedia Flash ActiveX Buffer Overflow]</ref>

In Windows Vista, Microsoft has attempted to contain the risks of bugs such as buffer overflows by running the Internet Explorer process with limited privileges.<ref>Mike Friedman, [http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/02/09/528963.aspx Protected Mode in Vista IE7]</ref> [[Google Chrome]] similarly confines its page renderers to their own "sandbox".

====Sandbox implementation errors====
Web browsers are capable of running JavaScript outside the sandbox, with the privileges necessary to, for example, create or delete files. Of course, such privileges aren't meant to be granted to code from the Web.

Incorrectly granting privileges to JavaScript from the Web has played a role in vulnerabilities in both Internet Explorer<ref>US CERT, [https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/713878 Vulnerability Note VU#713878: Microsoft Internet Explorer does not properly validate source of redirected frame]</ref> and Firefox.<ref>Mozilla Foundation, [http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2005/mfsa2005-41.html Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2005-41: Privilege escalation via DOM property overrides]</ref> In Windows XP Service Pack 2, Microsoft demoted JScript's privileges in Internet Explorer.<ref>Microsoft Corporation, [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb457150.aspx#EHAA Changes to Functionality in Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2: Part 5: Enhanced Browsing Security]</ref>

[[Microsoft Windows]] allows JavaScript source files on a computer's hard drive to be launched as general-purpose, non-sandboxed programs (see: [[Windows Script Host]]). This makes JavaScript (like [[VBScript]]) a theoretically viable vector for a [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]], although JavaScript Trojan horses are uncommon in practice.<ref>For one example of a rare JavaScript Trojan Horse, see Symantec Corporation, [http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2003-100111-0931-99 JS.Seeker.K]</ref>

==Uses outside web pages==
In addition to web browsers and servers, JavaScript interpreters are embedded in a number of tools. Each of these applications provides its own [[object model]] that provides access to the host environment. The core JavaScript language remains mostly the same in each application.

===Embedded scripting language===

* Microsoft's [[Active Scripting]] technology supports [[JScript]] as a scripting language.<ref name="VersionInformation">{{cite web | url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/s4esdbwz(v=VS.94).aspx | title=Version Information (JavaScript) | publisher=Msdn.microsoft.com | accessdate=2013-05-26}}</ref>
* The [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]] introduced the <tt>javax.script</tt> package in version 6 that includes a JavaScript implementation based on [[Rhino (JavaScript engine)|Mozilla Rhino]]. Thus, Java applications can host scripts that access the application's variables and objects, much like web browsers host scripts that access a webpage's [[Document Object Model]] (DOM).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://java.sun.com/javase/6/webnotes/index.html#scripting | title=javax.script release notes | publisher=Java.sun.com | accessdate=2009-05-19}}</ref>{{Sfn|Flanagan|2006|pp=214 et seq}}

It has the ability to call functions in commonly used libraries like NSPR, SQLite, libTomCrypt, OpenGL, OpenAL, and librsvg.<ref>[https://code.google.com/p/jslibs/ jslibs] on Google Code</ref>
* [[OS X Yosemite]] introduced JavaScript for Automation (JXA), which is built upon [[JavaScriptCore]] and the [[Open Scripting Architecture]]. It features an [[Objective-C]] bridge which enables entire [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]] applications to be programmed in JavaScript.
* Late Night Software's [[JavaScript OSA]] (a.k.a. JavaScript for OSA, or JSOSA) is a freeware alternative to [[AppleScript]] for Mac OS X. It is based on the Mozilla 1.5 JavaScript implementation, with the addition of a <tt>MacOS</tt> object for interaction with the operating system and third-party applications.<ref>[[Open Scripting Architecture]]</ref>

===Application platform===
* [[ActionScript]], the programming language used in [[Adobe Flash]], is another implementation of the ECMAScript standard.
* [[Adobe Integrated Runtime]] is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to create desktop applications.
* [[CA, Inc.]]'s AutoShell cross-application scripting environment is built on the [[SpiderMonkey (JavaScript engine)|SpiderMonkey]] JavaScript engine. It contains [[preprocessor]]-like extensions for command definition, as well as custom classes for various system-related tasks like file I/O, operation system command invocation and redirection, and COM scripting.

* The [[Mozilla]] platform, which underlies [[Firefox]], [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]], and some other web browsers, uses JavaScript to implement the [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) of its various products.
* [[Digital Airways|myNFC]] is a JavaScript based framework that allows developers to create applications for smart phones.<ref>{{cite web | author=Category: Project's basics | url=http://www.mynfc.org/ | title=myNFC.org | publisher=myNFC.org | date=2013-05-22 | accessdate=2013-05-26}}</ref>
* [[Qt Quick]]'s markup language (available since Qt 4.7) uses JavaScript for its application logic. Its declarative syntax is also similar to JavaScript.
* [[TypeScript]] is a programming language based on JavaScript that adds support for optional [[type annotation]]s and some other language extensions such as classes, interfaces and modules. A TS-script compiles into plain JavaScript and can be executed in any JS host supporting [[ECMAScript|ECMAScript 3]] or higher. The compiler is itself written in TypeScript.
* [[Ubuntu Touch]] provides a JavaScript API for its unified usability interface.
* [[webOS]] uses the [[WebKit]] implementation of JavaScript in its [[Software development kit|SDK]] to allow developers to create stand-alone applications solely in JavaScript.
* [[Windows Runtime#JavaScript|WinJS]] provides a special Windows Library for JavaScript functionality in [[Windows 8]] that enables the development of [[Metro (design language)|Modern style]] (formerly ''Metro style'') applications in [[HTML5]] and JavaScript.

===Microcontrollers===
As the specifications of [[microcontroller]]s have increased over the last few years, it has become possible to use JavaScript to control hardware in embedded devices. There are currently two main implementations:<ref>MAKE: Magazine, [http://makezine.com/magazine/first-look-javascript-micro-controllers-for-web-developers/ First Look: JavaScript Microcontrollers]</ref>

* [http://www.espruino.com Espruino] is a JavaScript interpreter for low power microcontrollers.
* [http://www.tessel.io Tessel] is a microcontroller board with built-in WiFi.

==Development tools==
Within JavaScript, access to a [[debugger]] becomes invaluable when developing large, non-trivial programs. Because there can be implementation differences between the various browsers (particularly within the [[Document Object Model]]), it is useful to have access to a debugger for each of the browsers that a Web application targets.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.alistapart.com/articles/advanced-debugging-with-javascript/ | title=Advanced Debugging With JavaScript | publisher=alistapart.com | date=2009-02-03 | accessdate=2010-05-28}}</ref>

Script debuggers are integrated within [[Internet Explorer]], [[Firefox]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], [[Google Chrome]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] and [[Node.js]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://javascript.about.com/od/problemsolving/ig/JavaScript-Debugging/ | title=The JavaScript Debugging Console | publisher=javascript.about.com | date=2010-05-28 | accessdate=2010-05-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.javascript-debugger.com | title=SplineTech JavaScript Debugger - an independent standalone JavaScript Debugger | publisher=javascript-debugger.com | date=2013-08-26 | accessdate=2013-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://docs.strongloop.com/display/DOC/Debugging+with+Node+Inspector | title=Debugging with Node Inspector | publisher=http://docs.strongloop.com/ | accessdate=2014-05-07}}</ref>

In addition to the native [[Internet Explorer Developer Tools]], three debuggers are available for Internet Explorer: [[Microsoft Visual Studio]] is the richest of the three, closely followed by [[Microsoft Script Editor]] (a component of [[Microsoft Office]]),<ref>[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa202668(office.11).aspx JScript development in Microsoft Office 11] (MS InfoPath 2003)</ref> and finally the free [[Microsoft Script Debugger]] that is far more basic than the other two. The free [[Microsoft Visual Web Developer Express]] provides a limited version of the JavaScript debugging functionality in Microsoft Visual Studio. Internet Explorer has included developer tools since version 8 (reached by pressing the F12 key).

In comparison to Internet Explorer, Firefox has a more comprehensive set of developer tools, which include a debugger as well. Old versions of Firefox without these tools used a [[Firefox addon]] called [[Firebug (Firefox extension)|Firebug]], or the older [[Venkman]] debugger. Also, [[WebKit]]'s Web Inspector includes a JavaScript debugger,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://webkit.org/blog/61/introducing-drosera/ | title=Introducing Drosera - Surfin' Safari | publisher=Webkit.org | date=2006-06-28 | accessdate=2009-05-19}}</ref> which is used in [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]]. A modified version called Blink DevTools is used in [[Google Chrome]]. [[Node.js]] has node-inspector, an interactive debugger that integrates with the Blink DevTools, available in [[Google Chrome]]. Last but not least, [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] includes a set of tools called [[Opera Dragonfly|Dragonfly]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.opera.com/dragonfly/|title=Opera DragonFly|publisher=Opera Software}}</ref>

{{Anchor|Online dev tools}}In addition to the native computer software, there are ''online JavaScript IDEs'',  debugging aids are themselves written in JavaScript and built to run on the Web. An example is the program [[JSLint]], developed by [[Douglas Crockford]] who has written extensively on the language. JSLint scans JavaScript code for conformance to a set of standards and guidelines. Many libraries for JavaScript, such as [[three.js]], provide links to demonstration code that can be edited by users. They are also used as a pedagogical tool by institutions such as [[Khan Academy]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.khanacademy.org/cs |title=Khan Academy Computer Science|accessdate=28 Sep 2012}}</ref> to allow students to experience writing code in an environment where they can see the output of their programs, without needing any setup beyond a web browser.

On October 6, 2008<ref>{{cite web |url=http://remysharp.com/2008/10/06/js-bin-for-collaborative-javascript-debugging/|title=JS Bin for Collaborative JavaScript Debugging|accessdate=20 Nov 2012}}</ref> [[Remy Sharp]] release jsbin, one of the earliest environments to support live updates of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. He credits [[John Resig]]'s Learning App, [http://ejohn.org/apps/learn/] as inspiration.

==Related languages and features==
[[JSON]], or JavaScript Object Notation, is a general-purpose data interchange format that is defined as a subset of JavaScript's object literal syntax.  Like much of JavaScript (regexps and anonymous functions as 1st class elements, closures, flexible classes, 'use strict'), [[JSON]], except for replacing [[Perl]]'s key-value operator '=>' by an [[RFC 822]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc822#section-3.2|title=RFC 822}}</ref> inspired ':', is syntactically pure Perl.

[[jQuery]] is a popular JavaScript library designed to simplify [[Document Object Model|DOM]]-oriented client-side HTML scripting along with offering cross-browser compatibility because various browsers respond differently to certain vanilla JavaScript code.

[[Underscore.js]] is a utility JavaScript library for data manipulation that is used in both client-side and server-side network applications.

Mozilla browsers currently support [[LiveConnect]], a feature that allows JavaScript and Java to intercommunicate on the Web. However, Mozilla-specific support for LiveConnect is scheduled to be phased out in the future in favor of passing on the LiveConnect handling via [[NPAPI]] to the Java 1.6+ plug-in (not yet supported on the Mac {{as of|March 2010|lc=y}}).<ref>[http://java.sun.com/javase/6/webnotes/6u10/plugin2/liveconnect/ Release Notes for the Next-Generation Java™ Plug-In Technology (introduced in Java SE 6 update 10)]. Java.sun.com. Retrieved on 2013-06-13.</ref> Most browser inspection tools, such as [[Firebug (software)|Firebug]] in Firefox, include JavaScript interpreters that can act on the visible page's DOM.

[[asm.js]] is a subset of JavaScript that can be run in any JavaScript engine or run faster in an [[ahead-of-time]] (AOT) compiling engine.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://asmjs.org/faq.html | title=frequently asked questions | publisher=asm.js | accessdate=2014-04-13}}</ref>

===Use as an intermediate language===
As JavaScript is the most widely supported client-side language that can run within a web browser, it has become an [[intermediate language]] for other languages to target. This has included both newly created languages and ports of existing languages. Some of these include:

* [[Objective-J]], a superset of JavaScript that compiles to standard JavaScript. It adds traditional inheritance and [[Smalltalk]]/[[Objective-C]] style dynamic dispatch and optional pseudo-static typing to JavaScript.
* [[Processing.js]], a JavaScript port of Processing, a programming language designed to write visualizations, images, and interactive content. It allows web browsers to display animations, visual applications, games and other graphical rich content without the need for a Java applet or Flash plugin.
* [[CoffeeScript]], an alternate syntax for JavaScript intended to be more concise and readable. It adds features like array comprehensions (also available in JavaScript since version 1.7)<ref>{{cite web | url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en/New_in_JavaScript_1.7#Array_comprehensions_%28Merge_into_Array_comprehensions%29 | title=New in JavaScript 1.7 | publisher=Developer.mozilla.org | date=2012-12-05 | accessdate=2013-05-26}}</ref> and pattern matching. Like Objective-J, it compiles to JavaScript. Ruby and Python have been cited as influential on CoffeeScript syntax.
* [[Google Web Toolkit]] translates a subset of Java to JavaScript.
* [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], an object-oriented and functional programming language, has an experimental Scala-to-JavaScript compiler.<ref>{{cite web | author=Sébastien Doeraene | url=http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~doeraene/scala-js/ | title=Scala.js | publisher=Lampwww.epfl.ch | accessdate=2014-04-13}}</ref>
* [[Pyjamas (software)|Pyjamas]], a port of [[Google Web Toolkit]] to [[Python (programming language)|Python]] (translates a subset of Python to JavaScript)
* [[Dart (programming language)|Dart]], an open-source programming language developed by Google, can be compiled to JavaScript.
* Whalesong,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://hashcollision.org/whalesong/ | title=Whalesong: a Racket to JavaScript compiler | publisher=Hashcollision.org | accessdate=2014-04-13}}</ref> a [[Racket (programming language)|Racket]]-to-JavaScript compiler.
* [[Emscripten]], a [[LLVM]]-backend for porting native libraries to JavaScript.
* [[Fantom (programming language)|Fantom]] a programming language that runs on JVM, .NET and JavaScript.
* [[TypeScript]], a free and open-source programming language developed by Microsoft. It is a superset of JavaScript, and essentially adds optional static typing and class-based object-oriented programming to the language.
* [[Haxe]], an open-source high-level multiplatform programming language and compiler that can produce applications and source code for many different platforms including JavaScript.
* ClojureScript,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript | title=clojure/clojurescript · GitHub | publisher=Github.com | accessdate=2014-04-13}}</ref> a compiler for [[Clojure]] that targets JavaScript. It is designed to emit JavaScript code that is compatible with the advanced compilation mode of the Google Closure optimizing compiler.
* [[Kotlin (programming language)|Kotlin]], a [[Type system#Static type-checking|statically-typed]] language that also compiles to [[Java byte code]].

As JavaScript has unusual limitations – such as no separate integer type, using floating point – languages<!--such as Scala--> that compile to JavaScript commonly have slightly different behavior than in other environments.

===JavaScript and Java===
A common misconception is that JavaScript is similar or closely related to [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. It is true that both have a C-like syntax (the C language being their most immediate common ancestor language). They also are both typically [[Sandbox (computer security)|sandboxed]] (when used inside a browser), and JavaScript was designed with Java's syntax and standard library in mind. In particular, all Java keywords were reserved in original JavaScript, JavaScript's standard library follows Java's naming conventions, and JavaScript's Math and Date objects are based on classes from Java 1.0,<ref name="popularity">{{cite web | url=http://brendaneich.com/2008/04/popularity/ | title=Popularity | author=Brendan Eich | date=3 April 2008 | accessdate=2012-01-19}}</ref> but the similarities end there.

The differences between the two languages are more prominent than their similarities. Java has [[static typing]], while JavaScript's typing is [[Dynamic typing|dynamic]]. Java is loaded from compiled bytecode, while JavaScript is loaded as human-readable source code. Java's objects are [[Class-based programming|class-based]], while JavaScript's are [[Prototype-based programming|prototype-based]]. Finally, Java did not support [[functional programming]] until Java 8, while JavaScript does, as it contains many features based on [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]].
