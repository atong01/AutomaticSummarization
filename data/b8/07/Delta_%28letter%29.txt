{{Greek Alphabet|letter=delta}}
'''Delta''' (uppercase '''Œî''', lowercase '''Œ¥''' or '''ùõø'''; {{lang|el|ŒîŒ≠ŒªœÑŒ±}} ''D√©lta''; Modern Greek {{IPA-el|Àà√∞elta|}}) is the fourth letter of the [[Greek alphabet]]. In the system of [[Greek numerals]] it has a value of 4. It was derived from the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician letter]] [[Dalet (letter)|dalet]] [[Image:phoenician daleth.png|20px]].<ref>http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/delta</ref> Letters that come from delta include [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] [[D]] and [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] [[De (Cyrillic)|–î]].

A [[river delta]] (originally, the [[Nile River]] delta) is so named because its shape approximates the upper-case letter delta (the shape is a triangle). Despite a popular legend, this use of the word ''delta'' was not coined by [[Herodotus]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Celoria|first=Francis|title=Delta as a geographical concept in Greek literature|journal=Isis|year=1966|volume=57|issue=3|pages=385‚Äì388|url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/228368|doi=10.1086/350146}}</ref>

==Pronunciation==
In [[Ancient Greek]], delta represented a [[voiced dental plosive]] {{IPA|/d/}}. In [[Modern Greek]], it represents a [[voiced dental fricative]] {{IPA|/√∞/}}, like the "th" in "that" or "this". It is [[romanization of Greek|romanized]] as ''d'' or ''dh''.

==Upper case==
The upper-case letter Œî can be used to denote:
*[[Change (mathematics)|Change]] of any changeable quantity, in mathematics and the sciences (more specifically, the [[difference operator]]{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}); for example, in:
::<math>{y_2-y_1\over x_2-x_1} = {\Delta y \over \Delta x} ,</math>
:the average change of y per unit x (i.e. the change of y over the change of x).  Delta is the initial letter of the Greek word Œ¥ŒπŒ±œÜŒøœÅŒ¨ ''diaphor√°'', "difference".  (The small [[Latin]] letter '''d''' is used in much the same way for the notation of [[derivative]]s and [[differential (mathematics)|differential]]s, which also describe change.)
*The [[Laplace operator]]:
:<math>\Delta f = \sum_{i=1}^n {\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i^2}}</math>
*The [[discriminant]] of a [[polynomial]] equation, especially the [[quadratic equation]]:
:<math>\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\,\!</math>
*The [[area of a triangle]]
:<math>\Delta = \tfrac{1}{2} a b \sin{C}</math>
*The [[symmetric difference]] of two sets
*A [[derivative|macroscopic change]] in the value of a variable in mathematics or science
*[[Uncertainty]] in a physical variable as seen in the [[uncertainty principle]]
*An interval of possible values for a given quantity (i.e. across a sample{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}})
*Any of the [[Delta baryon|delta particles]] in particle physics
*The determinant of the matrix of coefficients of a set of linear equations (see [[Cramer's Rule]])
*That an associated [[locant]] number represents the location of a [[covalent bond]] in an [[organic compound]], the position of which is variant between [[isomers|isomeric]] forms
*A [[simplex]], [[simplicial complex]], or [[convex hull]]
*In chemistry, the addition of heat in a reaction
*In [[legal shorthand]], it represents a [[defendant]].
*In the financial markets, one of the [[Greeks (finance)|Greeks]], describing the rate of change of an option price for a given change in the underlying benchmark
*The symbol of the Greek inventor and architect [[Daedalus]]
*A major seventh chord in jazz music notation
*In [[genetics]], it can stand for a [[Deletion (genetics)|gene deletion]] (e.g. the [[CCR5-Œî32]], a deletion of the CCR5 at the 32nd base pair segment)
*The [[American Dental Association]] cites it (together with omicron for "odont") as the symbol of dentistry.<ref>[http://www.ada.org/2517.aspx?currentTab=2 Caduceus, the emblem of dentistry - American Dental Association - ADA.org]</ref>
*English [[indie rock]] band [[Alt-J]] (so known because the symbol can be typed on a [[OS X|Mac OS X]] computer system by pressing Alt-J.
*Often used as a symbol of homosexuality in the British gay community.

==Lower case==

The lower-case letter Œ¥ (or ùõø) can be used to denote:
*A change in the value of a variable in [[calculus]]
*An auxiliary function in calculus, used to rigorously define the [[Limit of a function|limit]] or [[Continuous function|continuity]] of a given function
*The [[Kronecker delta]] in mathematics
*The [[Dirac delta function]] in mathematics
*In mathematics (specifically [[point-set topology]]), the boundary of a set '''A''' is denoted by '''Œ¥A''' .
*The transition function in [[Finite state machine|automata]]
*[[Deflection (engineering)|Deflection]] in engineering mechanics
*The [[Compound interest|Force of interest]] in actuarial science
*The [[chemical shift]] of [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] in chemistry
*The relative [[electronegativity]] of different atoms in a molecule, Œ¥<sup>&minus;</sup> being more electronegative than Œ¥<sup>+</sup>
*Text requiring deletion in [[proofreading]]; The usage is said to date back to classical times.
*In some of the manuscripts written by Dr. [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]], the character of delta is used to represent Dee.
*A subunit of the F1 sector of the [[F-ATPase]]
*The [[declination]] of an object in the [[equatorial coordinate system]] of [[astronomy]]
*The dividend yield in the [[Black‚ÄìScholes]] option pricing formula
*Ratios of [[environmental isotopes]], such as <sup>18</sup>O/<sup>16</sup>O and [[Deuterium|D]]/<sup>1</sup>H from water are displayed using [[Isotope geochemistry|delta notation]]&nbsp;‚Äì '''Œ¥<sup>18</sup>O''' and '''Œ¥D''' , respectively
*The rate of depreciation of the aggregate capital stock of an economy in an [[exogenous growth model]] in [[macroeconomics]]<ref>http://econ.duke.edu/people?subpage=unit&Gurl=%2Faas%2FEconomics&cname=Masters+Students</ref>
*In a system that exhibits [[electrical reactance]], the angle between [[voltage]] and [[Electric current|current]]

==Meteorology==
*Delta was used as a name during the [[1972 Atlantic hurricane season]] and the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]] as [[Tropical Storm Delta (2005)]].

==Keyboard Entry==
On [[Microsoft Windows]], a small delta can be generated by typing {{key press|[[Alt key|Alt]]|2}}{{key press|3}}{{key press|5}}. In certain programs (e.g. [[Microsoft Word]]), an uppercase delta can be typed using {{key press|[[Alt key|Alt]]|0}}{{key press|9}}{{key press|1}}{{key press|6}}. However, in most other programs, {{key press|[[Alt key|Alt]]|0}}{{key press|9}}{{key press|1}}{{key press|6}} generates a closing quotation mark (‚Äù).

On [[OS X]], option-j yields an upper-case delta (‚àÜ).
