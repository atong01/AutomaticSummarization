A '''clade''' (from {{lang-grc|{{lang|grc|κλάδος}}}}, ''klados'', "branch") is a group of [[organism]]s that consists of a [[Common descent|common ancestor]] and all its [[lineal descendant]]s, and represents a single "branch" on the "[[Tree of life (science)|tree of life]]".<ref name=Dupuis>{{cite journal | last=Dupuis | first=Claude | year=1984 | title=Willi Hennig's impact on taxonomic thought | journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume=15 | pages=1–24 | doi=10.1146/annurev.es.15.110184.000245}}</ref>

The common ancestor may be an individual, a [[population]], a [[species]] ([[extinct]] or [[Extant taxon|extant]]), and so on right up to a [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]]. Clades are nested, one in another, as each branch in turn splits into smaller branches. These splits reflect [[evolutionary history]] as populations diverged and evolved independently. 

Increasingly, [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomists]] try to avoid naming [[Taxon|taxa]] that are not clades.{{cite needed|date=July 2015}}

==Etymology==
The term "clade" was coined in 1957 by the biologist [[Julian Huxley]] to refer to the result of [[cladogenesis]], a concept Huxley borrowed from [[Bernhard Rensch]].<ref name=Dupuis/><ref name=Huxley>{{cite journal | last = Huxley | first = J. S. | year =1957 |  title = The three types of evolutionary process | journal=Nature | volume=180 | pages=454–455 | doi=10.1038/180454a0}}</ref>

Many commonly named groups are clades, for example, [[rodent]]s, or [[insect]]s; because in each case, their name comprises a common ancestor with all its descendant branches. Rodents, for example, are a branch of [[mammal]]s that split off after the end of the period when the clade [[Dinosaur]]ia stopped being the dominant terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s 66 million years ago. The original population and all its descendants are a clade. The [[rodent]] clade corresponds to the order Rodentia, and [[insect]]s to the class Insecta. These clades include smaller clades, such as [[chipmunk]] or [[ant]], each of which comprises even smaller clades. The clade "rodent" is in turn included in the mammal, [[vertebrate]] and animal clades.

[[File:Cladogram Crocodilia NL.PNG|thumb|right|200 px|Gavialidae, Crocodylidae and Alligatoridae are clade names that are here applied to a [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] tree of crocodylians.]]

A clade is by definition [[monophyletic]], meaning it contains one ancestor (which can be an organism, a [[population]], or a [[species]]) and all its descendants.<ref group=note>
A semantic case has been made that the name should be "holophyletic," but this term has not acquired widespread use.

==Clades and phylogenetic trees==
{{main|Phylogenetics}}
{{main|Cladistics}}

The science that tries to reconstruct phylogenetic trees and thus discover clades is called [[phylogenetics]] or [[cladistics]], the latter term being derived from "clade" by [[Ernst Mayr]] (1965). The results of phylogenetic/cladistic analyses are tree-shaped diagrams called ''[[cladogram]]s''; they, and all their branches, are phylogenetic hypotheses.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nixon|first=Kevin C.|author2=Carpenter, James M.|title=On the Other "Phylogenetic Systematics"|journal=Cladistics|date=1 September 2000|volume=16|issue=3|pages=298–318|doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2000.tb00285.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1096-0031.2000.tb00285.x/pdf}}</ref>

Three methods of defining clades are featured in [[phylogenetic nomenclature]]: node-, stem-, and apomorphy-based (see [[Phylogenetic nomenclature#Phylogenetic definitions of clade names|here]] for detailed definitions).

==Terminology==
[[File:Primate cladogram.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|[[Cladogram]] of the [[primates]], showing the nested nature of the primate tree]]
The relationship between clades can be described in several ways:

* A clade located within a clade is said to be ''nested'' within that clade. In the diagram, the [[Ape|hominoid]] clade, the apes and humans, is nested within the primate clade.
* Two clades are ''[[Sister group|sisters]]'' if they have an immediate common ancestor. In the diagram, lemurs and lorises are sister clades.
* A clade ''A'' is ''[[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]]'' to a clade ''B'' if ''A'' branches off the lineage leading to ''B'' before the first branch leading only to members of ''B''. In the diagram to the right, the [[Strepsirrhini|strepsirrhine]] clade, including the lemurs and lorises, is basal to the [[Hominoidea|hominoids]], the apes and humans. Some authors have used "basal" differently, using it to mean a clade that is "more primitive" or less species-rich than its sister clade; others consider this usage to be incorrect.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Krell |first=F.-T. |last2=Cranston |first2=P. |year=2004 |title=Which side of the tree is more basal? |journal=Systematic Entomology |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=279–281 |doi=10.1111/j.0307-6970.2004.00262.x |lastauthoramp=yes }}</ref>

== Nomenclature and taxonomy ==
[[File:Haeckel arbol bn.png|thumb|right|Early phylogenetic tree by [[Ernst Haeckel|Haeckel]], 1866]]

The idea of a clade did not exist in pre-[[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] [[Linnaean taxonomy]], which was based by necessity only on internal or external [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] similarities between organisms – although as it happens, many of the better known animal groups in Linnaeus' original [[Systema Naturae]] (notably among the [[vertebrate]] groups) do represent clades. The phenomenon of [[convergent evolution]] is however responsible for many cases where there are misleading similarities in the morphology of groups that evolved from different lineages.

With the publication of Darwin's [[Evolution|theory of evolution]] in 1859, the idea was born that groups used in a system of classification should represent branches on the evolutionary [[tree of life (biology)|tree of life]]. In the century and a half since then, taxonomists have increasingly worked to make the taxonomic system reflect evolution. When it comes to [[Nomenclature#Biology|naming]], however, this principle is not always compatible with the traditional [[Linnaean taxonomy|rank-based nomenclature]]. In the latter, only taxa associated with a [[Taxonomic rank|rank]] can be named, yet there are not enough ranks to name a long series of nested clades; also, taxon names cannot be defined in a way that guarantees them to refer to clades. For these and other reasons, [[phylogenetic nomenclature]] has been developed; it is still controversial.
