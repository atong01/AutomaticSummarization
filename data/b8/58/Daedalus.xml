He could not leave Crete by sea, as the king kept strict watch on all vessels, permitting none to sail without being carefully searched. Since Minos controlled the land and sea routes, Daedalus set to work to fabricate wings for himself and his young son<space/><link><target>Icarus</target></link>. He tied feathers together, from smallest to largest so as to form an increasing surface. He secured the feathers at their midpoints with string and at their bases with wax, and gave the whole a gentle curvature like the wings of a bird. When the work was done, the artist, waving his wings, found himself buoyed upward and hung suspended, poising himself on the beaten air. He next equipped his son in the same manner, and taught him how to fly. When both were prepared for flight, Daedalus warned Icarus not to fly too high, because the heat of the sun would melt the wax, nor too low, because the sea foam would soak the feathers.</paragraph><paragraph>They had passed<space/><link><target>Samos</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Delos</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Lebynthos</target></link><space/>by the time the boy, forgetting himself, began to soar upward toward the sun. The blazing sun softened the wax which held the feathers together and they came off. Icarus quickly fell in the sea and drowned. His father cried, bitterly lamenting his own arts, and called the land near the place where Icarus fell into the ocean<space/><link><target>Icaria</target></link><space/>in memory of his child. Some time later, the goddess Athena visited Daedalus and gave him wings, telling him to fly like a god.</paragraph><paragraph>An early image of winged Daedalus appears on an<space/><link><target>Etruscan civilization</target><part>Etruscan</part></link><space/>jug of ca 630 BC found at<space/><link><target>Cerveteri</target></link>, where a winged figure captioned<space/><italics>Taitale</italics><space/>appears on one side of the vessel, paired on the other side, uniquely, with<space/><italics>Metaia</italics>,<space/><link><target>Medea</target></link>:<extension extension_name='ref'>Erika Simon, &quot;Daidalos-Taitale-Daedalus: neues zu einem wohlbekannten Mythos&quot;,<space/><italics>Archologischer Anzeiger</italics><space/>(2004:419-22).</extension><space/>&quot;its linking of these two mythical figures is unparalleled,&quot; Robin Lane Fox observes: &quot;The link was probably based on their wondrous, miraculous art.

He presented a spiral seashell and asked for a string to be run through it. When he reached Kamikos, King Cocalus, knowing Daedalus would be able to solve the riddle, privately fetched the old man to him. He tied the string to an ant which, lured by a drop of honey at one end, walked through the seashell stringing it all the way through. Minos then knew Daedalus was in the court of King Cocalus and demanded he be handed over. Cocalus managed to convince Minos to take a bath first, where Cocalus' daughters killed Minos. In some versions, Daedalus himself poured boiling water on Minos and killed him.</paragraph><paragraph>The anecdotes are literary, and late; however, in the founding tales of the Greek colony of<space/><link><target>Gela</target></link>, founded in the 680s on the southwest coast of Sicily, a tradition was preserved that the Greeks had seized<space/><link><target>cult image</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>wrought by Daedalus from their local predecessors, the<space/><link><target>Sicani</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'><link><target>Pausanias (geographer)</target><part>Pausanias</part></link>, viii.46.2, ix.40.3-4; T.J.
