Indeed, this part of Henry's reign saw the trial for heresy of Protestants as well as Roman Catholics.</paragraph><paragraph>Under his son,<space/><link><target>Edward VI of England</target><part>King Edward VI</part></link>, more Protestant-influenced forms of worship were adopted. Under the leadership of the Archbishop of Canterbury,<space/><link><target>Thomas Cranmer</target></link>, a more radical reformation proceeded. A new pattern of worship was set out in the<space/><link><target>Book of Common Prayer</target></link><space/>(1549 and 1552). These were based on the older liturgy but influenced by Protestant principles. The confession of the reformed Church of England was set out in the<space/><link><target>Forty-two Articles</target></link><space/>(later revised to thirty-nine). The reformation however was cut short by the death of the king.<space/><link><target>Mary I of England</target><part>Queen Mary I</part></link>, who succeeded him, returned England again to the authority of the papacy, thereby ending the first attempt at an independent Church of England. During her co-reign with her husband,<space/><link><target>Philip II of Spain</target><part>King Philip</part></link>, many leaders and common people were burnt for their refusal to recant of their reformed faith.

The failure of political and ecclesiastical authorities to submit to Puritan demands for more extensive reform was one of the causes of open warfare. By Continental standards, the level of violence over religion was not high, but the casualties included King Charles I and Archbishop of Canterbury<space/><link><target>William Laud</target></link>.

The 39 Articles were replaced by the<space/><link><target>Westminster Confession</target></link>, the Book of Common Prayer by the Directory of Public Worship. Despite this, about one quarter of English clergy refused to conform to this form of State Presbyterianism.</paragraph><paragraph>With the Restoration of Charles II, Parliament restored the Church of England to a form not far removed from the Elizabethan version. One difference was that the ideal of encompassing all the people of England in one religious organisation, taken for granted by the Tudors, had to be abandoned.

The Church of England affirms the Protestant Reformation principle that scripture contains all things necessary to salvation and is the final arbiter in doctrinal matters. The Thirty-nine Articles are the church's only official confessional statement. Though not a complete system of doctrine, the articles highlight areas of agreement with<space/><link><target>Lutheran</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Calvinism</target><part>Reformed</part></link><space/>positions, while differentiating Anglicanism from Roman Catholicism and<space/><link><target>Anabaptism</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="EncRelg349-350"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>While embracing some themes of the Protestant Reformation, the Church of England also maintains Catholic traditions of the ancient church and teachings of the Church Fathers, unless these are considered contrary to scripture. It accepts the decisions of the first four ecumenical councils concerning the<space/><link><target>Trinity</target></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>Incarnation (Christianity)</target><part>Incarnation</part></link>. The Church of England also preserves Catholic order by adhering to<space/><link><target>episcopal polity</target></link>, with ordained orders of bishops, priests and deacons. There are differences of opinion within the Church of England over the necessity of episcopacy. Some consider it essential, while others feel it is needed for the proper ordering of the church.<extension extension_name='ref' name="EncRelg349-350"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The Church of England has, as one of its distinguishing marks, a breadth and &quot;open-mindedness&quot;. This tolerance has allowed Anglicans who emphasise the Catholic tradition and others who emphasise the Reformed tradition to coexist.

The high church party places importance on the Church of England's continuity with the pre-Reformation Catholic Church, adherence to ancient liturgical usages and the sacerdotal nature of the priesthood.
