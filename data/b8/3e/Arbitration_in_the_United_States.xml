In practice arbitration is generally used as a substitute for judicial systems, particularly when the judicial processes are viewed as too slow, expensive or biased. Arbitration is also used by communities which lack formal law, as a substitute for formal law.</paragraph><paragraph>Arbitration may also serve a distinct purpose: as an alternative to strikes and<space/><link><target>Lockout (industry)</target><part>lockouts</part></link><space/>as a means of resolving labor disputes. Labor arbitration comes in two varieties:<space/><bold>interest arbitration</bold>, which provides a method for resolving disputes about the terms to be included in a new contract when the parties are unable to agree, and<space/><bold>grievance arbitration</bold>, which provides a method for resolving disputes over the interpretation and application of a<space/><link><target>collective bargaining agreement</target></link>.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Species of Arbitration</heading><heading level='3'>Commercial and other forms of contract arbitration</heading><paragraph>Agreements to arbitrate were not enforceable at common law, though once the parties had actually submitted a pending dispute to an arbitrator, the arbitrator's judgment was usually enforceable. The reasoning for this was that the power of the arbitrator arose solely from the<space/><italics>mutual</italics><space/>consent of the parties to his jurisdiction; but by the time a dispute reached the point that one party wished to take it to an arbitrator, the other often preferred to take their chances in court instead. Thus, without the consent of both parties to his jurisdiction, the arbitrator lacked the power to decide the case.</paragraph><paragraph>During the<space/><link><target>Industrial Revolution</target></link>, large<space/><link><target>corporations</target></link><space/>became increasingly opposed to this policy. They argued that too many valuable<space/><link><target>business</target></link><space/>relationships were being destroyed through years of expensive adversarial<space/><link><target>litigation</target></link>, in courts whose rules differed significantly from the informal norms and<space/><link><target>Convention (norm)</target><part>convention</part><trail>s</trail></link><space/>of businesspeople (the private law of<space/><link><target>commerce</target></link>, or<space/><italics>jus merchant</italics>). Arbitration was promoted as being faster, less adversarial, and cheaper.</paragraph><paragraph>The result was the<space/><link><target>New York Arbitration Act</target></link><space/>of 1920, followed by the United States Arbitration Act of 1925 (now known as the<space/><link><target>Federal Arbitration Act</target></link>). Both made agreements to arbitrate valid and enforceable (unless one party could show fraud or unconscionability or some other ground for rescission which undermined the validity of the entire contract). Due to the subsequent judicial expansion of the meaning of<space/><link><target>interstate commerce</target></link>, the<space/><link><target>U.S. Supreme Court</target></link><space/>reinterpreted the FAA in a series of cases in the 1980s and 1990s to cover almost the full scope of interstate commerce. In the process, the Court held that the FAA preempted many state laws covering arbitration, some of which had been passed by state<space/><link><target>legislature</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>to protect their<space/><link><target>consumer</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>against powerful corporations.</paragraph><paragraph>Since commercial arbitration is based upon either contract law or the<space/><link><target>law of treaties</target></link>, the agreement between the parties to submit their dispute to arbitration is a legally binding<space/><link><target>contract</target></link>. All arbitral decisions are considered to be &quot;final and binding.&quot; This does not, however, void the requirements of law. Any dispute not excluded from arbitration by virtue of law (for example, criminal proceedings) may be submitted to arbitration.</paragraph><paragraph>Furthermore, arbitration agreements can only bind parties who have agreed, expressly or impliedly to arbitrate. Arbitration cannot bind nonsignatories to an arbitration contract, even if those nonsignatories later become involved with a signatory to a contract by accident (usually through the commission of a<space/><link><target>tort</target></link>).<extension extension_name='ref'><italics>County of Contra Costa v.

Labor organizations in the<space/><link><target>United States</target></link>, such as the<space/><link><target>National Labor Union</target></link>, called for arbitration as early as 1866 as an alternative to strikes to resolve disputes over the wages, benefits and other rights that workers would enjoy. Governments have also relied on arbitration to resolve particularly large labor disputes, such as the<space/><link><target>Coal Strike of 1902</target></link>. This type of arbitration, wherein a neutral arbitrator decides the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, is commonly known as interest arbitration. The<space/><link><target>United Steelworkers of America</target></link><space/>adopted an elaborate form of interest arbitration, known as the Experimental Negotiating Agreement, in the 1970s as a means of avoiding the long and costly strikes that had made the industry vulnerable to foreign competition.<space/><link><target>Major League Baseball</target></link><space/>uses a variant of interest arbitration, in which an arbitrator chooses between the two sides' final offers, to set the terms for contracts for players who are not eligible for free agency. Interest arbitration is now most frequently used by public employees who have no right to strike (for example, law enforcement and firefighters).</paragraph><paragraph>Unions and employers have also employed arbitration to resolve employee and union grievances arising under a collective bargaining agreement. The<space/><link><target>Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America</target></link><space/>made arbitration a central element of the<space/><italics>Protocol of Peace</italics><space/>it negotiated with garment manufacturers in the second decade of the twentieth century. Grievance arbitration became even more popular during<space/><link><target>World War II</target></link>, when most unions had adopted a no-strike pledge. The<space/><link><target>War Labor Board</target></link>, which attempted to mediate disputes over contract terms, pressed for inclusion of grievance arbitration in collective bargaining agreements. The Supreme Court subsequently made labor arbitration a key aspect of federal labor policy in three cases which came to be known as the Steelworkers' Trilogy. The Court held that grievance arbitration was a preferred dispute resolution technique and that courts could not overturn arbitrators' awards unless the award does not draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement. State and federal statutes may allow vacating an award on narrow grounds (<italics>e.g.</italics>, fraud). These protections for arbitrator awards are premised on the union-management system, which provides both parties with due process. Due process in this context means that both parties have experienced representation throughout the process, and that the arbitrators practice only as neutrals.<space/><italics>See</italics><space/><link><target>National Academy of Arbitrators</target></link>.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Securities arbitration</heading><paragraph>In the United States securities industry, arbitration has long been the preferred method of resolving disputes between brokerage firms, and between firms and their customers. The securities industry uses a pre-dispute arbitration agreement, where the parties agree to arbitrate their disputes before any such dispute arises. Those agreements were upheld by the United States Supreme Court in Shearson v. MacMahon, 482 U.S. 220 (1987) and today nearly all disputes involving brokerage firms, other than Securities class action claims,<extension extension_name='ref'>http://finra.complinet.com/en/display/display.html?rbid=2403&amp;record_id=1901&amp;element_id=1660</extension><space/>are resolved in arbitration. The SEC has come under fire from members of the<space/><link><target>Senate Judiciary Committee</target></link><space/>for not fulfilling statutory duty to protect individual investors, because all brokers require arbitration, and arbitration does not provide a court-supervised discovery process, require arbitrators to follow rules of evidence or result in written opinions establishing precedence, or case law, or provide the efficiency gains it once did. Arbitrator selection bias, hidden conflicts of interest, and a case where an arbitration panel refused to follow instructions handed down from a judge, were also raised as issues.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='https://archiveDOTtoday/YiutI#selection-765.145-765.335'>Dear S.E.C., Reconsider Arbitration</link>, the New York Times, May 6, 2007</extension><space/>The final result in the case where the arbitrators were in contempt of court is unknown; it was settled out of court under settlement agreement terms that, at the broker's insistence, are confidential.<extension extension_name='ref'>http://books.google.com/books?id=-4XWcYqroB0C&amp;pg=PT118&amp;lpg=PT117&amp;ots=K1ATI6WWQX&amp;focus=viewport&amp;dq=Roger+T.+Benitez+Mabel+Strobel</extension></paragraph><paragraph>The process operates under its own rules.

Judicial arbitration is often merely advisory dispute resolution technique, serving as the first step toward resolution, but not binding either side and allowing for trial de novo. Litigation attorneys present their side of the case to an independent teritary lawyer, who issues an opinion on settlement. Should the parties in question decide to continue to dispute resolution process, there can be some sanctions imposed from the initial arbitration per terms of the contract.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Validity of arbitration clauses</heading><paragraph>The validity of arbitration clauses in the US is not a settled legal matter.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="title">Guide to Arbitration in New York</arg><arg name="url">http://eguides.cmslegal.com/pdf/arbitration_volume_I/CMS%20GtA_Vol%20I_NEW%20YORK.pdf</arg><arg name="publisher">CMS Legal</arg><arg name="accessdate">10 May 2012</arg></template></extension><space/>Typically, the validity of an arbitration clause is decided by a court rather than an arbitrator.

The two most important are the<space/><link><target>UNCITRAL</target></link><space/>rules and the ICSID rules. The rules to be followed by the arbitrator are specified by the agreement establishing the arbitration.</paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards</target></link><space/>(Done at New York, 10 June 1958; Entered into force, 7 June 1959; 330 U.N.T.S. 38, 1959) provides for the enforcement of foreign arbitral awards on the territory of the contracting parties. Similar provisions are contained in the earlier<space/><link><target>Convention on the Execution of Foreign Arbitral Awards</target></link><space/>(Done at Geneva, 26 September 1927; Entered into force, 25 July 1929; L.N.T.S. ???).</paragraph><paragraph>Some jurisdictions have instituted a limited grace period during which an arbitral decision may be appealed against, but after which there can be no appeal. In the case of arbitration under international law, a right of appeal does not in general exist, although one may be provided for by the arbitration agreement, provided a court exists capable of hearing the appeal.</paragraph><paragraph>When arbitration occurs under U.S. law, either party to an arbitration may appeal from the arbitrator's decision to a court, however the court will generally not change the arbitrator's findings of fact but will decide only whether the arbitrator was guilty of malfeasance, or whether the arbitrator exceeded the limits of his or her authority in the arbitral award or whether the award conflicts with positive law. The Supreme Court has described the standard of review as one of the narrowest known to Western jurisprudence. Wherever so seen, arbitration may be the best approach to the legal manners and parties involved.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Arbitrators</heading><paragraph>Arbitrators have wide latitude in crafting remedies in the arbitral decision, with the only real limitation being that they may not exceed the limits of their authority in their award. An example of exceeding arbitral authority might be awarding one party to a dispute the personal automobile of the other party when the dispute concerns the specific performance of a business-related contract.</paragraph><paragraph>It is open to the parties to restrict the possible awards that the arbitrator can make. If this restriction requires a straight choice between the position of one party or the position of the other, then it is known as<space/><italics><link><target>pendulum arbitration</target></link></italics><space/>or<space/><italics>final offer arbitration</italics>. It is designed to encourage the parties to moderate their initial positions so as to make it more likely they receive a favorable decision.</paragraph><paragraph>No definitive statement can be made concerning the credentials or experience levels of arbitrators, although some jurisdictions have elected to establish standards for arbitrators in certain fields. Several independent organizations, such as the<space/><link><target>American Arbitration Association</target></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>National Arbitration Forum</target></link>,<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.adrforum.com'>National Arbitration Forum</link></extension><space/>offer arbitrator training programs and thus in effect, credentials. Generally speaking, however, the credibility of an arbitrator rests upon reputation, experience level in arbitrating particular issues, or expertise/experience in a particular field. Arbitrators are generally not required to be members of the legal profession.</paragraph><paragraph>To ensure effective arbitration and to increase the general credibility of the arbitral process, arbitrators will sometimes sit as a panel, usually consisting of three arbitrators. Often the three consist of an expert in the legal area within which the dispute falls (such as contract law in the case of a dispute over the terms and conditions of a contract), an expert in the industry within which the dispute falls (such as the construction industry, in the case of a dispute between a homeowner and his general contractor), and an experienced arbitrator.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Umpire</heading><paragraph>The umpire is a third party chosen either by the method of the arbitral parties or by a court<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>usc</target><arg>9</arg><arg>5</arg></template></extension><space/>to render an independent decision usually in labour disputes when the arbitrators disagree on something.
