==History==
{{Main|History of Cheshire|Timeline of Cheshire history}}

===Toponymy===

Cheshire's name was originally derived from an early name for Chester, and was first recorded as ''Legeceasterscir'' in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'',<ref name=vch-vol1-p237>Harris, B. E. and Thacker, A. T. (1987). p. 237.</ref> meaning ''the shire of the city of legions''.<ref name=crosby-p31>Crosby, A. (1996). page 31.</ref> Although the name first appears in 980, it is thought that the county was created by [[Edward the Elder]] around 920.<ref name=crosby-p31/> In the [[Domesday Book]], Chester was recorded as having the name ''Cestrescir'' (Chestershire), derived from the name for Chester at the time.<ref name=vch-vol1-p237/> A series of changes that occurred as English itself changed, together with some simplifications and [[elision]], resulted in the name Cheshire, as it occurs today.

Because of the historically close links with the land bordering Cheshire to the west, which became modern [[Wales]], there is a history of interaction between Cheshire and North Wales. The Domesday Book records Cheshire as having two complete [[Hundreds of Cheshire|Hundreds]] (Atiscross and Exestan) that later became the principal part of [[Flintshire]]. Additionally, another large portion of the Duddestan Hundred later became known as [[English Maelor|Maelor Saesneg]] when it was transferred to North Wales.<ref>Harris, B.E. and Thacker, A.T. (1987). pp. 340–341.</ref> For this and other reasons, the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name for Cheshire (''Swydd Gaerlleon'')<ref>[http://www.geiriadur.net/atebion.php?PHPSESSID=6629e0a737dd330fd4fecaf52d21efd7&uni=y&prefLang=en&term=Swydd+Gaerlleon&direction=we&whichpart=exact&type=noun Welsh dictionary entry for Cheshire.] www.geriadur.net website (''Welsh-English / English-Welsh On-line Dictionary''  ). Department of Welsh, University of Wales, Lampeter. Retrieval Date: 21 February 2008</ref> is sometimes used within Wales and by Welsh speakers.

===Administrative history===
[[File:Wales 1234 (Marchia Wallie and Pura Wallia).svg|thumb|The strategic location of the [[Earl of Chester|Earldom of Chester]]; the only [[county palatine]] on the Welsh Marches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrexham.gov.uk/english/heritage/medieval_exhibition/struggles.htm |title=Wrexham County Borough Council: The Princes and the Marcher Lords |publisher=Wrexham.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=14 May 2014}}</ref><br><br>{{legend|#87de87|Pura Wallia (independent Wales)}}{{legend|#aaeeff|Lands gained by [[Llywelyn the Great]] in 1234}}{{legend|#ffb380|Marchia Wallie (lands controlled by Norman Marcher barons)}}]]
After the Norman conquest of 1066 by William I, dissent and resistance continued for many years after the invasion. In 1069 local resistance in Cheshire was finally put down using draconian measures as part of the [[Harrying of the North]]. The ferocity of the campaign against the Saxon populace was enough to end all future resistance. Examples were made of major landowners such as Saxon Earl [[Edwin of Mercia]], their properties confiscated and redistributed amongst Norman barons. William I made Cheshire a [[county palatine]] and gave [[Gerbod the Fleming, 1st Earl of Chester|Gerbod the Fleming]] the new title of [[Earl of Chester]]. When Gerbod returned to [[Normandy]] in about 1070, the king used his absence to declare the earldom forfeit and gave the title to [[Hugh d'Avranches]] (nicknamed Hugh Lupus, or "wolf"). Due to Cheshire's strategic location on [[Welsh Marches]], the Earl had complete autonomous powers to rule on behalf of the king in the county palatine.

====Palatine hundreds====
[[File:Cheshire domesday hundreds.svg|thumb|left|Hundreds of Cheshire in Domesday Book. Areas highlighted in pink now in [[Flintshire]].]]
Cheshire in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' (1086) is recorded as a much larger county than it is today. It included two [[hundred (division)|hundreds]], Atiscross and Exestan, that later became part of North [[Wales]]. At the time of the ''Domesday Book'', it also included as part of Duddestan Hundred the area of land later known as [[English Maelor]] (which used to be a detached part of [[Flintshire (historic)|Flintshire]]) in Wales.<ref>{{cite book | last = Davies | first = R. | title = The Age of Conquest: Wales 1063–1415 | year= 2000}}</ref> The area between the [[Mersey]] and [[River Ribble|Ribble]] (referred to in the Domesday Book as "Inter Ripam et Mersam") formed part of the returns for Cheshire.<ref>Morgan (1978). pp.269c–301c,d.</ref><ref name=sylvesterp14>Sylvester (1980). p. 14.</ref> Although this has been interpreted to mean that at that time south Lancashire was part of Cheshire,<ref name=sylvesterp14/><ref>Roffe (2000)</ref> more exhaustive research indicates that the boundary between Cheshire and what was to become Lancashire remained the [[River Mersey]].<ref>Harris and Thacker (1987) write on page 252: {{quotation|Certainly there were links between Cheshire and south Lancashire before 1000, when [[Wulfric Spot]] held lands in both territories. Wulfric's estates remained grouped together after his death, when they were left to his brother Aelfhelm, and indeed there still seems to have been some kind of connexion in 1086, when south Lancashire was surveyed together with Cheshire by the Domesday commissioners. Nevertheless, the two territories do seem to have been distinguished from one another in some way and it is not certain that the shire-moot and the reeves referred to in the south Lancashire section of Domesday were the Cheshire ones.}}</ref><ref>Phillips and Phillips (2002); pp. 26–31.</ref><ref>Crosby, A. (1996) writes on page 31: {{quotation|The Domesday Survey (1086) included south Lancashire with Cheshire for convenience, but the Mersey, the name of which means 'boundary river' is known to have divided the kingdoms of Northumbria and Mercia and there is no doubt that this was the real boundary.}}</ref> With minor variations in spelling across sources, the complete list of [[hundreds of Cheshire]] at this time are: Atiscross, Bochelau, Chester, Dudestan, Exestan, Hamestan, Middlewich, Riseton, Roelau, Tunendune, Warmundestrou and Wilaveston.<ref>Harris, B. E., and Thacker, A. T. (1987); pages 340–341.</ref>

====Palatine feudal baronies====
Feudal baronies or baronies by tenure were granted by the Earl as forms of [[feudal land tenure]] within the palatinate in a similar way to which the king granted [[English feudal barony|English feudal baronies]] within England proper. An example is the barony of Halton.<ref>Sanders, I.J. English Baronies, a Study of their Origin and Descent 1086–1327, Oxford, 1960, p.138, refers to the "Lord" of Halton being the hereditary constable of the County Palatine of Chester, but omits Halton from both his lists of English feudal baronies</ref> One of Hugh d'Avranche's barons has been identified as Robert Nicholls, Baron of Halton and Montebourg.<ref>Crosby, A. A History of Cheshire; Norman Chapter</ref>

====Lands devolved to Lancashire====
In 1182 the land north of the Mersey became administered as part of the new county of [[Lancashire]], thus resolving any uncertainty about the county in which the land "Inter Ripam et Mersam" was.<ref>{{cite book | last = George | first = D. | title = Lancashire | year = 1991}}</ref> Over the years, the ten hundreds consolidated and changed names to leave just seven—Broxton, Bucklow, Eddisbury, Macclesfield, Nantwich, Northwich and Wirral.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cheshire ancient divisions |work=Vision of Britain website |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10193850 |accessdate=6 March 2007}}</ref>

====Acquires Welsh-March lands====
In 1397 the county had lands in the [[march of Wales]] added to its territory, and was promoted to the rank of principality. This was because of the support the men of the county had given to King Richard II, in particular by his standing armed force of about 500 men called the "Cheshire Guard". As a result, the King's title was changed to "King of England and France, Lord of Ireland, and Prince of Chester". No other English county has been honoured in this way, although it lost the distinction on Richard's fall in 1399.<ref>Davies, R. R. 'Richard II and the Principality of Chester' in ''The Reign of Richard II: Essays in Honour of May McKisack'', ed. F. R. H. Du Boulay and Caroline Baron (1971)</ref>

====Lands devolved to Greater Manchester and Merseyside metropolitan counties====
Through the Local Government Act 1972, which came into effect on 1 April 1974, some areas in the north-west became part of the metropolitan counties of [[Greater Manchester]] and [[Merseyside]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Jones | first= B. | title=Politics UK | year = 2004|display-authors=etal}}</ref> [[Stockport]] (previously a county borough), [[Altrincham]], [[Hyde, Greater Manchester|Hyde]], [[Dukinfield]] and [[Stalybridge]] in the north-east became part of Greater Manchester. Much of the [[Wirral Peninsula]] in the north-west, including the county boroughs of Birkenhead and Wallasey, joined Merseyside as the [[Metropolitan Borough of Wirral]]. At the same time the [[Tintwistle Rural District]] was transferred to [[Derbyshire]]. The area of south Lancashire not included within either the Merseyside or Greater Manchester counties, including [[Widnes]] and the county borough of [[Warrington]], was added to the new non-metropolitan county of Cheshire.<ref name = "fipqxl">Local Government Act 1972</ref>

====Unitary Authorities created====
[[Halton (borough)|Halton]] and [[Warrington]] became unitary authorities independent of Cheshire County Council on 1 April 1998, but remain part of Cheshire for ceremonial purposes and also for fire and policing.<ref name="Ref-1">{{cite web | title = The Cheshire (Boroughs of Halton and Warrington) (Structural Change) Order 1996 | work=Office of Public Sector Information | url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1996/1863/contents/made | accessdate = 6 March 2007}}</ref>

====Regional Assemblies proposed====
{{further|Northern England referendum, 2004}}
A referendum for a further local government reform connected with an elected [[regional assemblies in England|regional assembly]] was planned for 2004, but was abandoned.

====Abolition of Cheshire County Council====
As part of the [[2009 structural changes to local government in England|local government restructuring]] in April 2009, [[Cheshire County Council]] and the Cheshire districts were abolished and replaced by two new unitary authorities, [[Cheshire East]] and [[Cheshire West and Chester]]. The existing unitary authorities of [[Halton (borough)|Halton]] and [[Warrington]] were not affected by the change.

Prehistoric burial grounds have been discovered at [[The Bridestones]], near [[Congleton]] ([[Neolithic]]) and Robin Hood's Tump, near [[Alpraham]] ([[Bronze Age]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.cheshire.gov.uk/Archaeology/RCP/PrehistoricSitesToVisit.htm |title=Cheshire County Council: Revealing Cheshire's Past |publisher=.cheshire.gov.uk |date=1 September 2004 |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref> The remains of Iron Age [[hill fort]]s are found on sandstone ridges at several locations in Cheshire. Examples include [[Maiden Castle, Cheshire|Maiden Castle]] on [[Bickerton Hill]], [[Helsby]] Hillfort and Woodhouse Hillfort at [[Frodsham]]. The Roman fortress and walls of [[Chester]], perhaps the earliest building works in Cheshire remaining above ground, are constructed from purple-grey sandstone.<ref name="IOE">{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/ |title=Images of England |publisher=Images of England |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref>

The distinctive local red sandstone has been used for many monumental and ecclesiastical buildings throughout the county: for example, the medieval [[Beeston Castle]], [[Chester Cathedral]] and numerous parish churches. Occasional residential and industrial buildings, such as [[Helsby railway station]] (1849),<ref>{{National Heritage List for England |num=1261746}}</ref> are also in this sandstone.

Many surviving buildings from the 15th to 17th centuries are timbered, particularly in the southern part of the county. Notable examples include the moated manor house [[Little Moreton Hall]], dating from around 1450, and many commercial and residential buildings in Chester, [[Nantwich]] and surrounding villages.

Early brick buildings include [[Peover Hall]] near [[Macclesfield]] (1585), [[Tattenhall Hall]] (pre-1622), and the [[Pied Bull Hotel]] in Chester (17th century). From the 18th century, orange, red or brown brick became the predominant building material used in Cheshire, although earlier buildings are often faced or dressed with stone. Examples from the Victorian period onwards often employ distinctive brick detailing, such as brick patterning and ornate chimney stacks and gables. Notable examples include [[Arley Hall]] near [[Northwich]], [[Willington Hall]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&id=55781 |title=Detailed Record |publisher=Imagesofengland.org.uk |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref> near Chester (both by Nantwich architect [[George Latham (architect)|George Latham]]) and [[Overleigh Lodge]], Chester. From the Victorian era, brick buildings often incorporate timberwork in a mock Tudor style, and this hybrid style has been used in some modern residential developments in the county. Industrial buildings, such as the Macclesfield silk mills (for example, [http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&id=390900 Waters Green New Mill]), are also usually in brick.

==Physical geography==

{{Main|Geology of Cheshire}}

Cheshire covers a [[boulder clay]] plain separating the hills of [[North Wales]] and the [[Peak District]] of [[Derbyshire]] (the area is also known as the [[Cheshire Plain|Cheshire Gap]]). This was formed following the retreat of [[Quaternary glaciation|ice age]] glaciers which left the area dotted with [[kettle hole]]s, locally referred to as meres. The bedrock of this region is almost entirely [[Triassic]] [[sandstone]], outcrops of which have long been quarried, notably at [[Runcorn]], providing the distinctive red stone for [[Liverpool Cathedral]] and [[Chester Cathedral]].

The eastern half of the county is Upper Triassic [[Mercia Mudstone Group|Mercia Mudstone]] laid down with large [[table salt|salt]] deposits which were mined for hundreds of years around [[Northwich]]. Separating this area from Lower Triassic Sherwood Sandstone to the west is a prominent sandstone ridge known as the [[Mid Cheshire Ridge]]. A {{convert|55|km|mi|0|sing=on}} footpath,<ref>[http://www.cheshire.gov.uk/countryside/Walking/ ] {{wayback|url=http://www.cheshire.gov.uk/countryside/Walking/ |date=20110814130851 }}</ref> the [[Sandstone Trail]], follows this ridge from [[Frodsham]] to [[Whitchurch, Shropshire|Whitchurch]] passing [[Delamere Forest]], [[Beeston Castle]] and earlier [[Iron Age]] forts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sandstonetrail.co.uk/ |title=Walking Cheshire's Sandstone Trail}}</ref>

The highest point in Cheshire is [[Shining Tor]] on the Derbyshire/Cheshire border between [[Macclesfield]] and [[Buxton]], at {{convert|559|m}} above sea level. Before county boundary alterations in 1974, the county top was [[Black Hill (Peak District)|Black Hill]] ({{convert|582|m|abbr=on}}) near [[Crowden, Derbyshire|Crowden]] in the far east of the historic county on the border with the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]. Black Hill is now the highest point in [[West Yorkshire]].

==Demography==

===Population===
Based on the Census of 2001, the overall population of Cheshire is 673,781, of which 51.3% of the population were male and 48.7% were female. Of those aged between 0–14 years, 51.5% were male and 48.4% were female; and of those aged over 75 years, 62.9% were female and 37.1% were male.

The population density of Cheshire is 32 people per km², lower than the North West average of 42 people/km² and the England and Wales average of 38 people/km². [[Ellesmere Port]] and [[Neston]] has a greater urban density than the rest of the county with 92 people/km².<ref>{{cite web | title = Census 2001 – Population | work=Cheshire Census Consortium | url = http://www.cheshire.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/2BA86039-3905-4E03-B2CC-1A56FF239192/0/Population.pdf | accessdate = 6 March 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070605061912/http://www.cheshire.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/2BA86039-3905-4E03-B2CC-1A56FF239192/0/Population.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 5 June 2007}}</ref>

Cheshire is a ceremonial county. This means that although there is no county-wide elected local council, Cheshire has a [[Lord Lieutenant]] and [[High Sheriff of Cheshire|High Sheriff]] for ceremonial purposes under the [[Lieutenancies Act 1997]].

Local government functions apart from the Police and Fire/Rescue services are carried out by four smaller unitary authorities: [[Cheshire East]], [[Cheshire West and Chester]], [[Halton (borough)|Halton]], and [[Warrington]]. All four unitary authority areas have [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough status]].

Policing and fire and rescue services are still provided across the County as a whole, but by unelected bodies. The [[Cheshire Constabulary|Cheshire Police Authority]] and [[Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service|Cheshire Fire Authority]] consist of members of the four councils.

===Transition from the previous (1974) arrangement===
From 1 April 1974 the area under the control of the county council was divided into eight local government districts; [[Chester (district)|Chester]], [[Congleton (borough)|Congleton]], [[Crewe and Nantwich]], [[Ellesmere Port and Neston]], [[Halton (borough)|Halton]], [[Macclesfield (borough)|Macclesfield]], [[Vale Royal]] and [[Warrington]].<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10032957 Vision of Britain] – Divisions of Cheshire</ref><ref>[http://www.cheshire.gov.uk/Council/districtcouncils.htm Cheshire County Council] – Map of Cheshire districts</ref> [[Halton (borough)|Halton]] (which includes the towns of [[Runcorn]] and [[Widnes]]) and [[Warrington]] became [[unitary authority|unitary authorities]] in 1998.<ref name="Ref-1"/><ref>{{cite web | title = The Lord Lieutenant of Cheshire | work=Cheshire County Council | url = http://www.cheshire.gov.uk/aboutcheshire/lord.htm | accessdate = 6 March 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070203042519/http://www.cheshire.gov.uk/aboutcheshire/lord.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 3 February 2007}}</ref> The remaining districts and the county were abolished as part of local government restructuring on 1 April 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/634/contents/made|title=Cheshire (Structural Changes) Order 2008 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref> The Halton and Warrington boroughs were not affected by the 2009 restructuring.

On 25 July 2007, the Secretary of State [[Hazel Blears]] announced she was 'minded' to split Cheshire into two new unitary authorities, [[Cheshire West and Chester]], and [[Cheshire East]]. She confirmed she had not changed her mind on 19 December 2007 and therefore the proposal to split two-tier Cheshire into two would proceed.

Cheshire County Council leader Paul Findlow, who attempted High Court legal action against the proposal, claimed that splitting Cheshire would only disrupt excellent services while increasing living costs for all. A widespread sentiment that this decision was taken by the [[European Union]] long ago has often been portrayed via angered letters from Cheshire residents to local papers. On 31 January 2008 ''The Standard'', Cheshire and district's newspaper, announced that the legal action had been dropped. Members against the proposal were advised that they may be unable to persuade the court that the decision of Hazel Blears was "manifestly absurd".

The Cheshire West and Chester unitary authority covers the area formerly occupied by the City of Chester and the boroughs of Ellesmere Port and Neston and Vale Royal; Cheshire East now covers the area formerly occupied by the boroughs of Congleton, Crewe and Nantwich, and Macclesfield. The changes were implemented on 1 April 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/staffordshire/6916055.stm |title=BBC News, 25 July 2007 – County split into two authorities |publisher=BBC News  |date=25 July 2007 |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = The Cheshire (Structural Changes) Order 2008 | work=Office of Public Sector Information | url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/uksi_20080634_en_1 | accessdate = 25 February 2009}}</ref>

The appeal was dismissed on 4 March 2008.<ref>{{cite web | title = Unitary legal fight over in 60 seconds | work=LocalGov.co.uk | url = http://www.localgov.co.uk/index.cfm?method=news.detail&ID=64451 | accessdate = 25 February 2009}}</ref>

==Economy and industry==
{{Main|Economy of Cheshire}}
Cheshire has a diverse economy with significant sectors including agriculture, automotive, bio-technology, chemical, financial services, food and drink, ICT, and tourism. The county is famous for the production of [[Cheshire cheese]], [[Salt in Cheshire|salt]] and silk. The county has seen a number of [[Cheshire Inventions, Innovations and Firsts|inventions and firsts]] in its history.

A mainly rural county, Cheshire has a high concentration of villages. Agriculture is generally based on the dairy trade, and cattle are the predominant livestock. Land use given to agriculture has fluctuated somewhat, and in 2005 totalled 1558&nbsp;km² over 4,609 holdings.<ref>{{cite web | title = Agricultural Holdings – Land and Employment – Cheshire – 2002 to 2005| work=Cheshire County Council | url = http://www.cheshire.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/8AC07978-47FE-4BA6-8063-39F5AFB0978D/0/EcE3.pdf | accessdate = 3 June 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070605061926/http://www.cheshire.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/8AC07978-47FE-4BA6-8063-39F5AFB0978D/0/EcE3.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 5 June 2007}}</ref> Based on holdings by EC farm type in 2005, 8.51&nbsp;km² was allocated to dairy farming, with another 11.78&nbsp;km² allocated to cattle and sheep.
[[File:Cheshire Cattle.JPG|thumb|Cattle farming in the county]]
The chemical industry in Cheshire was founded in [[Roman Britain|Roman]] times, with the [[Salt in Cheshire|mining of salt]] in Middlewich and Northwich. Salt is still mined in the area by [[British Salt]]. The salt mining has led to a continued chemical industry around Northwich, with [[Brunner Mond]] based in the town. Other chemical companies, including [[Ineos]] (formerly [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]]), have plants at [[Runcorn]]. The [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] [[Stanlow Refinery]] is at Ellesmere Port. The oil refinery has operated since 1924 and has a capacity of 12&nbsp;million tonnes per year. {{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Crewe was once the centre of the [[Rail transport in Great Britain|British railway industry]], and remains a major railway junction. The [[Crewe Works|Crewe railway works]], built in 1840, employed 20,000 people at its peak, although the workforce is now less than 1,000. Crewe is also the home of [[Bentley]] cars. Also within Cheshire are manufacturing plants for [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]] and [[Vauxhall Motors]] in Ellesmere Port. The county also has an aircraft industry, with the [[BAE Systems]] facility at [[Woodford Aerodrome]], part of BAE System's Military Air Solutions division. The facility designed and constructed [[Avro Lancaster]] and [[Avro Vulcan]] bombers and the [[Hawker-Siddeley Nimrod]]. On the Cheshire border with [[Flintshire]] is the [[Broughton, Flintshire|Broughton]] aircraft factory, more recently associated with [[Airbus]].

Tourism in Cheshire from within the UK and overseas continues to perform strongly. Over 8&nbsp;million nights of accommodation (both UK and overseas) and over 2.8&nbsp;million visits to Cheshire were recorded during 2003.<ref name = "ygcyzn">{{cite web | title = Cheshire Economy (page 64)| work=Cheshire County Council | url = http://www.cheshire.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/5F4B2042-1BCB-4F74-B53B-6EE65E28372E/0/CheshireEconomy.pdf | accessdate = 6 March 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070605061855/http://www.cheshire.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/5F4B2042-1BCB-4F74-B53B-6EE65E28372E/0/CheshireEconomy.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 5 June 2007}}</ref>

At the start of 2003, there were 22,020 VAT-registered enterprises in Cheshire, an increase of 7% since 1998, many in the business services (31.9%) and wholesale/retail (21.7%) sectors. Between 2002 and 2003 the number of businesses grew in four sectors: public administration and other services (6.0%), hotels and restaurants (5.1%), construction (1.7%), and business services (1.0%).<ref name = "ygcyzn"/>  The county saw the largest proportional reduction between 2001 and 2002 in employment in the energy and water sector and there was also a significant reduction in the manufacturing sector. The largest growth during this period was in the other services and distribution, hotels and retail sectors.<ref name = "ygcyzn"/>

Cheshire is considered to be an affluent county. {{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Due to its proximity to the cities of [[Manchester]] and [[Liverpool]], [[counter urbanisation]] is common. Cheshire West has a fairly large proportion of residents who work in Liverpool, while the Northwich area and Cheshire East fall within Manchester's sphere of influence.

==Education==
''See also: [[List of schools in Cheshire East]]; [[List of schools in Cheshire West and Chester]]; [[List of schools in Halton]]; [[List of schools in Warrington]]

All four [[Local Education Authority|local education authorities]] in Cheshire operate only comprehensive state school systems. When [[Altrincham]], [[Sale, Greater Manchester|Sale]] and [[Bebbington]] were moved from Cheshire to [[Metropolitan Borough of Trafford|Trafford]] and [[Merseyside]] in 1974, they took some former Cheshire selective schools. Today, there are three universities based in the county, the [[University of Chester]], the [[Crewe]] campus of [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] and the Chester campus of [[The University of Law]].
