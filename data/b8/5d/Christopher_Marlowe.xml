While versions of &quot;The Devil's Pact&quot; can be traced back to the 4th century, Marlowe deviates significantly by having his hero unable to &quot;burn his books&quot; or repent to a merciful God in order to have his contract annulled at the end of the play. Marlowe's protagonist is instead carried off by demons, and in the 1616 quarto his mangled corpse is found by several scholars. Doctor Faustus is a textual problem for scholars as two versions of the play exist: the 1604<space/><link><target>quarto</target></link>, also known as the A text, and the 1616 quarto or B text. Both were published after Marlowe's death. Scholars have disagreed which text is more representative of Marlowe's original, and some editions are based on a combination of the two. The latest scholarly consensus (as of the late 20th century) holds the A text is more representative because it contains irregular character names and idiosyncratic spelling, which are believed to reflect a text based on the author's handwritten manuscript, or &quot;<link><target>foul papers</target></link>.&quot; The B text, in comparison, was highly edited, censored because of shifting theatre laws regarding religious words onstage, and contains several additional scenes which scholars believe to be the additions of other playwrights, particularly<space/><link><target>Samuel Rowley</target></link><space/>and William Bird (<italics>alias</italics><space/>Borne).</listitem></list><paragraph>Marlowe's plays were enormously successful, thanks in part, no doubt, to the imposing stage presence of<space/><link><target>Edward Alleyn</target></link>.
