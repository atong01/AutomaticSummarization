There was some hope that settlers in western Canadamost of them recent immigrants from the U.S.would welcome the chance to overthrow their British rulers. However, the American invasions were defeated primarily by British regulars with support from Native Americans and<space/><link><target>Upper Canada</target></link><space/>(Ontario) militia. Aided by the powerful Royal Navy, a series of British raids on the American coast were highly successful, culminating with an<space/><link><target>Burning of Washington</target><part>attack on Washington</part></link><space/>that resulted in the British burning of the<space/><link><target>White House</target></link>,<space/><link><target>United States Capitol</target><part>Capitol</part></link>, and other public buildings.

With the surrender of Napoleon in 1814, Britain ended naval policies that angered Americans; with the defeat of the Indian tribes the threat to American expansion was ended.

The idea reached a peak in the spring and summer of 1870, with American expansionists, Canadian separatists, and British anti-imperialists seemingly combining forces. The plan was dropped for multiple reasons. London continued to stall, American commercial and financial groups pressed Washington for a quick settlement of the dispute on a cash basis, growing Canadian nationalist sentiment in British Columbia called for staying inside the British Empire, Congress became preoccupied with Reconstruction, and most Americans showed little interest in territorial expansion. The &quot;<link><target>Alabama Claims</target></link>&quot; dispute went to international arbitration. In one of the first major cases of arbitration, the tribunal in 1872 supported the American claims and ordered Britain to pay $15.5 million.

Canadas assertion that the Northwest Passage represents internal (territorial) waters has been challenged by other countries, especially the U.S., which argue that these waters constitute an international strait (<link><target>international waters</target></link>). Canadians were alarmed when Americans drove the reinforced oil tanker<space/><template><target>SS</target><arg>Manhattan</arg><arg>1962</arg><arg>2</arg></template><space/>through the Northwest Passage in 1969, followed by the icebreaker<space/><link><target>USCGC Polar Sea (WAGB-11)</target><part>Polar Sea</part></link><space/>in 1985, which actually resulted in a<space/><link><target>1985 Polar Sea controversy</target><part>minor diplomatic incident</part></link>. In 1970, the Canadian parliament enacted the Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act, which asserts Canadian regulatory control over pollution within a 100-mile zone. In response, the United States in 1970 stated, &quot;We cannot accept the assertion of a Canadian claim that the Arctic waters are internal waters of Canada. ... Such acceptance would jeopardize the freedom of navigation essential for United States naval activities worldwide.&quot; A compromise of sorts was reached in 1988, by an agreement on &quot;Arctic Cooperation,&quot; which pledges that voyages of American icebreakers &quot;will be undertaken with the consent of the Government of Canada.&quot; However the agreement did not alter either country's basic legal position.<space/><link><target>Paul Cellucci</target></link>, the American ambassador to Canada, in 2005 suggested to Washington that it should recognize the straits as belonging to Canada. His advice was rejected and Harper took opposite positions. The U.S. opposes Harper's proposed plan to deploy military icebreakers in the Arctic to detect interlopers and assert Canadian sovereignty over those waters.<extension extension_name='ref'>Matthew Carnaghan, Allison Goody,<space/><link type='external' href='http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/researchpublications/prb0561-e.htm'>&quot;Canadian Arctic Sovereignty&quot;</link><space/>(Library of Parliament: Political and Social Affairs Division, January 26, 2006);<space/><link type='external' href='http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/01/26/wilkins-harper060126.html'>2006 news</link></extension><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070817/qp_cellucci_070819/20070819?hub</arg><arg name="title">Cellucci: Canada should control Northwest Passage<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">CTV.ca<space/></arg><arg name="date"><space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">February 26, 2011</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>See also</target><arg>Beaufort Sea#Border dispute</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='3'>Common memberships</heading><paragraph><template><target>UKUSA</target></template>Canada and the United States both hold membership in a number of multinational organizations such as:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Arctic Council</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Food and Agriculture Organization</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>G7</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Group of Ten (economic)</target><part>G-10</part></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>G-20 major economies</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>International Chamber of Commerce</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>International Development Association</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>International Monetary Fund</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>International Olympic Committee</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Interpol</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>MLB</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>NBA</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>NHL</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>North American Free Trade Agreement</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>North American Aerospace Defense Command</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>North American Numbering Plan</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>North Atlantic Treaty Organization</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Organization of American States</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>UKUSA Community</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>United Nations</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>UNESCO</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>World Health Organization</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>World Trade Organization</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>World Bank</target></link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>Diplomatic missions</heading><heading level='3'>Canadian missions in the United States</heading><paragraph><template><target>multiple image</target><arg name="width1"><space/>#expr: (140 * 2968 / 1873) round 0
