'''Arcturus''' ({{IPAc-en|ɑr|k|ˈ|tj|ʊər|ə|s}}; α&nbsp;Boo, α&nbsp;Boötis, [[alpha (letter)|Alpha]] Boötis) of the [[constellation]] [[Boötes]] is the brightest [[star]] in the [[Northern Celestial Hemisphere|northern celestial hemisphere]]. With a [[Apparent magnitude|visual magnitude]] of&nbsp;&minus;0.05, it is the [[list of brightest stars|fourth brightest star]] in the [[night sky]], after &minus;1.46&nbsp;magnitude [[Sirius]], &minus;0.86 magnitude [[Canopus (star)|Canopus]], and &minus;0.27&nbsp;magnitude [[Alpha Centauri]]. It is a relatively close star at only 36.7 [[light-year]]s from Earth, and, together with [[Vega]] and Sirius, one of the most luminous stars in the [[Sun]]'s neighborhood.

Arcturus is a [[stellar classification|type]] K0&nbsp;III [[Giant star|orange giant]] star, with an [[absolute magnitude]] of −0.30. It has likely exhausted its hydrogen from its [[Solar core|core]] and is currently in its active [[red giant|hydrogen shell burning]] phase. It will continue to expand before entering [[horizontal branch]] stage of its life cycle.

==Observational history==
As one of the brightest stars in the sky, Arcturus has been significant to observers since antiquity. In Mesopotamia, it was linked to the god [[Enlil]], and also known as Shudun, "yoke",<ref name=rogers982/> or SHU-PA of unknown derivation in the ''Three Stars Each'' [[Babylonian star catalogues]] and later [[MUL.APIN]] around 1100 BC.<ref>{{cite journal  | last = Rogers  | first = John H.  | date = 1998  | title = Origins of the Ancient Constellations: I. The Mesopotamian Traditions  | journal = Journal of the British Astronomical Association  | volume = 108  | issue = 1  | pages = 9–28 | bibcode = 1998JBAA..108....9R}}</ref>

Ptolemy described Arcturus as ''subrufa'' "slightly red", and it has a B-V color index of +1.23, roughly midway between [[Pollux (star)|Pollux]] (B-V +1.00) and [[Aldebaran]] (B-V +1.54).<ref name=schaaf/>

Prehistoric [[Polynesian navigation|Polynesian navigators]] knew Arcturus as ''Hōkūleʻa'', the "Star of Joy". Arcturus is the [[zenith]] star of the [[Hawaiian Islands]]. Using Hōkūleʻa and other stars, the Polynesians launched their double-hulled [[canoe]]s from [[Tahiti]] and the [[Marquesas Islands]]. Traveling east and north they eventually crossed the [[equator]] and reached the [[latitude]] at which Arcturus would appear directly overhead in the summer [[night sky]]. Knowing they had arrived at the exact latitude of the island chain, they sailed due west on the [[trade winds]] to landfall. If Hōkūleʻa could be kept directly overhead, they landed on the southeastern shores of the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of [[Hawaii|Hawaiʻi]]. For a return trip to Tahiti the navigators could use [[Sirius]], the zenith star of that island. Since 1976, the [[Polynesian Voyaging Society]]'s ''[[Hokulea|Hōkūle‘a]]'' has crossed the Pacific Ocean many times under navigators who have incorporated this [[wayfinding]] technique in their non-instrument navigation.

The French mathematician and astronomer [[Jean-Baptiste Morin (mathematician)|Jean-Baptiste Morin]] observed Arcturus in the daytime with a telescope (a first for any star other than the Sun and [[supernova]]e) in 1635, and Arcturus has been seen at or just before sunset with the naked eye.<ref name=schaaf/>

Based upon an annual [[parallax]] shift of 88.83&nbsp;[[Minute of arc|milliarcseconds]] as measured by the [[Hipparcos]] satellite,<ref name="vanLeeuwen2007">{{cite journal | first=F. | last=van Leeuwen | title=Validation of the new Hipparcos reduction | journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics

The margin of error is 0.54 milliarcseconds, translating to a margin of error of ±{{Convert|0.7|pc|ly|abbr=off|lk=on|disp=flip}}.<ref name="vanLeeuwen2007"/>

Together with [[Spica]] and [[Denebola]] (or [[Regulus]], depending on the source), Arcturus is part of the [[Spring Triangle]] asterism, and by extension, also of the [[Great Diamond]] after factoring in [[Cor Caroli]].

==Visibility==
Arcturus has a [[visual magnitude]] of&nbsp;&minus;0.05, making it the brightest star north of the [[celestial equator]], and the [[list of brightest stars|fourth brightest star]] in the [[night sky]].<ref name="100greatest">{{cite book | title=The Hundred Greatest Stars | author=Kaler, James B. | date=2002 | publisher=Copernicus Books | location=New York, New York | isbn=0-387-95436-8 | page=21}}</ref> However, Alpha Centauri is a bright binary star, whose unresolved components to the naked eye are both fainter than Arcturus. This makes Arcturus the [[list of brightest stars|third brightest ''individual'' star]], just ahead of Alpha Centauri&nbsp;A (α&nbsp;Cen&nbsp;A), whose visual magnitude is&nbsp;&minus;0.01.<ref name=schaaf>{{cite book| first=Fred | last=Schaaf | date=2008 | title=The Brightest Stars: Discovering the Universe Through the Sky's Most Brilliant Stars | pages=126–36 | publisher=John Wiley and Sons|location=Hoboken, New Jersey | isbn=978-0-471-70410-2 }}</ref>

Arcturus is visible from both Earth's hemispheres as it is located 19° north of the [[celestial equator]]. The star [[culmination|culminates]] at midnight on 27 April, and at 9PM on June 10 being visible during the late northern spring or the southern autumn.<ref>Schaaf, p. 257.</ref> From the [[northern hemisphere]], an easy way to find Arcturus is to follow the arc of the handle of the [[Big Dipper]]. By continuing in this path, one can find [[Spica]], "Arc to Arcturus, then spike to [[Spica]]".

[[Eta Boötis]], or Muphrid, is only 3.3 [[light-year]]s distant from Arcturus, and would have a visual magnitude −2.5, whereas an observer on the former system would find Arcturus as bright as Venus as seen from Earth.<ref name=schaaf/>

==Properties==
[[File:Arcturus (optical).png|thumb|right|275 px|Optical image of Arcturus (DSS2 / MAST / STScI / NASA)]]
Arcturus is a [[stellar classification|type]] K0&nbsp;III [[red giant]] star. It is at least 110 times more [[luminosity|luminous]] than the [[Sun]] in visible light wavelengths, but this underestimates its strength as much of the light it gives off is in the [[infrared]]; total ([[Bolometric correction|bolometric]]) power output is about 180&nbsp;times that of the Sun. The lower output in visible light is due to a lower [[Luminous efficacy|efficacy]] as the star has a lower [[effective temperature|surface temperature]] than the Sun. With a near-infrared [[J band]] [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] of −2.2, only [[Betelgeuse]] (−2.9) and [[R Doradus]] (−2.6) are brighter.

As the brightest K-type [[Giant star#Red giants|giant]] in the sky, it was the subject of an [[spectral atlas|atlas]] of its [[visible spectrum]], made from [[photographic plate|photographic]] spectra taken with the [[Reflecting telescope#Coudé|coudé]] [[spectrograph]] of the [[Hooker telescope|Mt. Wilson 2.5m telescope]] published in 1968,<ref>{{cite book | last=Griffin | first=R.

The mass of Arcturus is hard to determine precisely, but may be slightly larger than that of the Sun (1.08 ± 0.06 solar masses).<ref name=ramirez_prieto_2011/> Arcturus has been estimated to be around 6 billion to 8.5 billion years old,<ref name=ramirez_prieto_2011/> and has likely begun fusing helium into oxygen and carbon in its core. It will expand further after its helium supply is exhausted, slough off its outer shell and become a white dwarf inside a planetary nebula.<ref name="100greatest"/>

===Oscillations===
As one of the brightest stars in the sky, Arcturus has been the subject of a number of studies in the emerging field of [[asteroseismology]].

Belmonte and colleagues carried out a radial velocity (Doppler shift of spectral lines) study of the star in April and May 1988, which showed variability with a frequency of the order of a few [[Hertz|microhertz]], the highest peak corresponding to 4.3&nbsp;μHz (2.7&nbsp;days) with an amplitude of 60 ms<sup>−1</sup>, with a [[frequency separation]] of ~5&nbsp;μHz. They suggested that the most plausible explanation for the variability of Arcturus is stellar oscillations.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Belmonte, J. A.; Jones, A. R.; Palle, P. L.; Roca Cortes, T.|date=1990|title=Acoustic oscillations in the K2 III star Arcturus|journal=Astrophysics and Space Science|volume=169|issue=1–2|pages=77–84|issn=0004-640X|doi=10.1007/BF00640689 |bibcode=1990Ap&SS.169...77B}}</ref>

It is believed that the surface of the star oscillates slightly, a common feature of red giant stars. In the case of Arcturus, this was an interesting discovery as it is known that the redder (more towards or within the M spectral class) a giant gets, the more variable it will be. Extreme cases like [[Mira]] undergo large swings over hundreds of days; Arcturus is not very red and is a borderline case between variability and stability with its short period and tiny range.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Element abundance===
Astronomers term "metals" those elements with higher [[atomic number]]s than helium. Arcturus has an enrichment of [[alpha elements]] relative to iron<ref>http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March03/McWilliam/McWilliam6_4.html</ref> but only 17 to 32% metallicity relative to our Sun.<ref>http://www.solstation.com/stars2/arcturus.htm</ref> Arcturus is possibly a [[Metallicity#Population II stars|Population II star]].<ref name=schaaf/>

===Kinematics===
Arcturus is notable for its high [[proper motion]], two [[Minute of arc|arc seconds]] a year, greater than any first magnitude star other than [[Alpha Centauri|α&nbsp;Centauri]]. It is moving rapidly ({{nowrap|122 km/s}}) relative to the Solar System, and is now almost at its closest point to the Sun. Closest approach will happen in about 4,000 years, when the star will be a few hundredths of a light year closer to Earth than it is today. Arcturus is thought to be an [[old disk star]], and appears to be moving with a group of 52 other such stars, known as the [[Arcturus stream]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthsky.org/brightest-stars/bright-orange-arcturus-use-the-big-dipper-to-find-it|title=Arcturus, orange star, cuts through galaxy’s disk|publisher=[[EarthSky]]|date=2011-05-18|accessdate= 2012-01-24|quote= |page= |author=Larry Sessions|author2=Deborah Byrd}}</ref>

In antiquity, Arcturus was closer to the centre of the constellation.<ref name=rogers982>{{cite journal  | last = Rogers  | first = John H.  | date = 1998  | title = Origins of the Ancient Constellations: II.

==Possible planetary system==
''Hipparcos'' also suggested that Arcturus is a [[binary star]], with the companion about twenty times dimmer than the primary and orbiting close enough to be at the very limits of our current ability to make it out. Recent results remain inconclusive, but do support the marginal ''Hipparcos'' detection of a binary companion.<ref>{{Cite journal| first1=T.|last1=Verhoelst|first2=P.

In 1993, radial velocity measurements of [[Aldebaran]], Arcturus and [[Pollux (star)|Pollux]] showed that Arcturus exhibited a long-period radial velocity oscillation, which could be interpreted as a ''substellar companion''. This [[substellar object]] would be nearly 12&nbsp;times the mass of [[Jupiter]] and be located roughly at the same orbital distance from Arcturus as the Earth is from the Sun, at 1.1&nbsp;[[Astronomical Unit]]s. However, all three stars surveyed showed similar oscillations yielding similar companion masses, and the authors concluded that the variation was likely to be intrinsic to the star rather than due to the gravitational effect of a companion. So far no substellar companion has been confirmed.<ref name=Kgiants>{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/173002|title=Long-period radial velocity variations in three K giants|author=Hatzes, A.|author2=Cochran, W.|journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]]|volume=413|issue = 1|pages=339–348|date=August 1993|bibcode=1993ApJ...413..339H}}</ref>

==Names and cultural significance==
[[File:Redgiants.svg|thumb|right|200px|Comparison between Arcturus, red supergiant [[Antares]], and the Sun. The black circle is the size of the orbit of Mars.]]
The name of the star derives from [[Ancient Greek]] Αρκτοῦρος (''Arktouros'') and means "Guardian of the Bear",<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*%29arktou%3Dros Αρκτοῦρος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> ultimately from ἄρκτος (''arktos''), "bear"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29%2Frktos ἄρκτος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> + οὖρος (''ouros''), "watcher, guardian".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dou%29%3Dros2 οὖρος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> It has been known by this name since at least the time of [[Hesiod]].<ref name=rogers982/> This is a reference to its being the brightest star in the constellation Boötes (of which it forms the left foot), which is next to the Greater and Lesser Bears, [[Ursa Major]] and [[Ursa Minor]].

In [[Ancient Rome]], the star's celestial activity was supposed to portend tempestuous weather, and a personification of the star acts as narrator of the prologue to [[Plautus]]' comedy ''[[Rudens (play)|Rudens]]'' (circa 211 BC).<ref>{{cite news|author=Plautus |author-link=Plautus |work=Rudens|page= prol.&nbsp;71}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author= Lewis and Short |author-link= Lewis and Short|work= Latin Dictionary |title= Arcturus}}</ref>

In the [[Middle Ages]], Arcturus was considered a [[Behenian fixed star]]<ref name=tyson1993>{{citation | first1=Donald | last1=Tyson | last2=Freake | first2=James | date=1993 | title=Three Books of Occult Philosophy | publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide | isbn=0-87542-832-0 }}</ref> and attributed to the stone [[Jasper]] and the [[Plantago|plantain]] herb. [[Cornelius Agrippa]] listed its [[Kabbalah|kabbalistic]] sign [[Image:Agrippa1531 Alchameth.png]] under the alternate name ''Alchameth''.

=== In Arabic ===
In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], Arcturus is one of two stars called ''al-simāk'' ("the uplifted one"); the other is [[Spica]]. Arcturus is specified as السماك الرامح ''as-simāk ar-rāmiħ'' "the uplifted one of the lancer".  The term '''Al Simak Al Ramih''' has appeared in Al Achsasi Al Mouakket catalogue (translated into [[Latin]] as '''Al Simak Lanceator''').<ref>{{cite journal|last=Knobel|first=E.

This has been variously [[Romanization|romanized]] in the past, leading to obsolete variants such as '''Aramec''' and '''Azimech'''. For example, the name '''Alramih''' is used in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Treatise on the Astrolabe]]'' (1391). Another Arabic name is '''Haris-el-sema''', from '''حارس السماء''' ''ħāris al-samā’'' "the keeper of heaven".<ref name=arabicstar>{{cite web|url=http://www.jas.org.jo/arabic/alma.html|title= List of the 25&nbsp;brightest stars|website = Jordanian Astronomical Society|accessdate=March 28, 2007}}</ref><ref name=allen>{{cite book|author=Allen, Richard Hinckley |title=Star-names and their meanings|date=1936|pages= 100–101}}</ref><ref name=arabicdict>{{cite book|author=Wehr, Hans |editor=Cowan, J.

This constellation marked the path for [[Hawaiiloa]] on his return to Hawaii from the South Pacific Ocean.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=209}} The Hawaiians called Arcturus ''Hoku-lea''.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=280}} It was equated to the [[Tuamotu]]an constellation ''Te Kiva'', meaning "[[frigate-bird]]", which could either represent the figure of Boötes or just Arcturus.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=221}} However, Arcturus may instead be the Tuamotuan star called ''Turu''.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=264}} The Hawaiian name for Arcturus as a single star was likely ''Hoku-lea'', which means "star of gladness".{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=210}} In the [[Marquesas Islands]], Arcturus was probably called ''Tau-tou'' and was the star that ruled the month approximating January. The [[Māori people|Maori]] and [[Moriori people|Moriori]] called it ''Tautoru'', a variant of the Marquesan name and a name shared with [[Orion's Belt]].{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=260}}

The star was chosen as it was thought that light from Arcturus had started its journey at about the time of the [[World's Columbian Exposition|previous Chicago World's Fair]] in 1893.  The star is 36.7&nbsp;[[light-year]]s from [[Earth]], and the light started its journey in 1896.<ref>{{cite web|title=Century of Progress World's Fair, 1933-1934|publisher=University of Illinois-Chicago|date=January 2008|url=http://collections.carli.illinois.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/uic_cop&CISOPTR=45&CISOBOX=1&REC=1| accessdate=2009-09-06}}</ref>
