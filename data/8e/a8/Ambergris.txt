'''Ambergris''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|m|b|ər|g|r|iː|s|}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|m|b|ər|g|r|I|s|}}, {{lang-la|Ambra grisea}}, ''Ambre gris'', ''ambergrease'' or ''grey amber'') is a solid, waxy, flammable substance of a dull grey or blackish colour produced in the digestive system of [[sperm whale]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/18871/ambergris |title=Ambergris |author= |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=31 January 2013 }}</ref> The word amber is derived from the Arabic word 'anbar'(عنبر).<ref>Cupboard love 2: A dictionary of cullinary curiosities.

Freshly produced ambergris has a marine, [[feces|faecal]] odour.  However, as it ages, it acquires a sweet, earthy scent commonly likened to the fragrance of [[Isopropyl alcohol|rubbing alcohol]] without the vaporous chemical astringency.<ref name="Burr">{{cite book | author=Burr, Chandler | title=The Emperor of Scent: A Story of Perfume, Obsession, and the Last Mystery of the Senses | year=2003 | location=New York | publisher=Random House | isbn=978-0-375-50797-7}}</ref> Although ambergris was formerly highly valued by [[perfume]]rs as a fixative (allowing the scent to last much longer), It has now largely been replaced by synthetic [[ambroxan]].

==Sources==
Ambergris occurs as a [[biliary|bile duct]] secretion of the [[intestines]] of the sperm whale and can be found floating upon the sea, or lying on the coast. It is also sometimes found in the [[abdomen]]s of [[whale]]s. Because the beaks of [[giant squid]]s have been found embedded within lumps of ambergris, scientists have theorised that the substance is produced by the whale's gastrointestinal tract to ease the passage of hard, sharp objects that the whale might have eaten. The sperm whale usually vomits these, but if one travels further down the gut, it will be covered in ambergris.<ref name="uchicago1">{{cite web|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/books/excerpt/2012/kemp_floating.html|title=The Origin of Ambergris|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube|-ChivtjDjh4}}</ref>

Ambergris is usually passed in the fecal matter. It is speculated that an ambergris mass too large to be passed through the intestines is expelled via the mouth, leading to the reputation of ambergris as primarily coming from whale vomit.<ref>{{cite book |author=William F. Perrin, Bernd Wursig, J. G.M. Thewissen |title=Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals |year=2009 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=0080919936 |page=28 }}</ref> It takes years for ambergris to form. Christopher Kemp, the author of ''Floating Gold: A Natural (and Unnatural) History of Ambergris'', says that It is only produced by sperm whales, and only by an estimated one percent of them. Once expelled by a whale, it must float for years, then it must make landfall, avoid being broken into pieces by rough seas, and someone must find it.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kemp|first=Christopher|title=Floating Gold: A Natural (and Unnatural) History of Ambergris|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=F0CKIxwLT-oC|year=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-43036-2|pages=[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=F0CKIxwLT–oC&pg=PA12 12–13]}}</ref> In other words, the odds of finding ambergris are extremely small. The very small chance of finding ambergris and the legal ambiguity involved led perfume makers away from ambergris.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Ambergris can be found in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and on the coasts of [[South Africa]], [[Brazil]], [[Madagascar]], the [[East Indies]], [[The Maldives]], [[China]], [[Japan]], [[India]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[Maluku Islands|Molucca Islands]]. In rarer cases, it can be found in other locations. Most commercially collected ambergris comes from the [[Bahamas]] in the [[Caribbean]], particularly [[New Providence]].  Fossilised ambergris from 1.75 million years ago has also been found.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Baldanza|first=Angela|first2=Roberto |last2=Bizzarri |first3=Federico |last3=Famiani |first4=Paolo |last4=Monaco |first5=Roberto |last5=Pellegrino |first6=Paola |last6=Sassi|title=Enigmatic, biogenically induced structures in Pleistocene marine deposits: A first record of fossil ambergris|journal=Geology|volume=41|issue=10|pages=1075|date=30 July 2013|doi=10.1130/G34731.1|url=http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/early/2013/07/30/G34731.1|bibcode=2013Geo....41.1075B}}</ref>

A 1.1&nbsp;kg  (2.4&nbsp;lb) piece of ambergris found on a beach at [[Anglesey]], [[Wales]], was sold for £11,000 at an auction in [[Macclesfield]], UK, on 25 September 2015 to a French buyer.<ref>[http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-north-west-wales-34362556 Ambergris found on Anglesey beach sells for £11,000] [[BBC]]  25 September 2015</ref>

==Physical properties==
Ambergris is found in lumps of various shapes and sizes, usually weighing from 15&nbsp;g (~½&nbsp;oz) to 50&nbsp;kg (110&nbsp;pounds), sometimes more. When initially expelled by or removed from the whale, the fatty precursor of ambergris is pale white in colour (sometimes streaked with black), soft, with a strong fecal smell. Following months to years of [[photodegradation]] and [[oxidation]] in the ocean, this precursor gradually hardens, developing a dark grey or black colour, a crusty and waxy texture, and a peculiar odour that is at once sweet, earthy, marine, and animalic. Its smell has been generally described as a vastly richer and smoother version of [[isopropanol]] without its stinging harshness. In this developed condition, ambergris has a [[specific gravity]] ranging from 0.780 to 0.926. It melts at about 62&nbsp;°C to a fatty, yellow resinous liquid; and at {{convert|100|C|0|abbr=on}} it is volatilised into a white vapour. It is soluble in [[diethyl ether|ether]], and in volatile and fixed oils.

==Chemical properties==
Ambergris is relatively nonreactive to acid. White crystals of a [[terpene]] known as [[ambrein]] can be separated from ambergris by heating raw ambergris in alcohol, then allowing the resulting solution to cool. Breakdown of the relatively scentless ambrein through oxidation produces [[ambroxan]] and ambrinol, the main odor components of ambergris.

[[Ambroxan]] is now produced synthetically and used extensively in the perfume industry.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://perfumeshrine.blogspot.co.uk/2010/11/ambroxambroxan-modern-fascination-on.html |title=Ambrox/Ambroxan: a Modern Fascination on an Elegant Material |date=5 November 2010 |author= |publisher=Perfume Shrine |accessdate=31 January 2013 }}</ref>

==Applications==
Ambergris has been mostly known for its use in creating perfume and fragrance much like [[musk]]. Perfumes can still be found with ambergris around the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/ambergris-treasure-of-the-deep-01122012.html |title=Ambergris, Treasure of the Deep |date=January 12, 2012 |first=Eric |last=Spitznagel |publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek |accessdate=31 January 2013 }}</ref> It is collected from remains found at sea and on beaches, although its precursor originates from the sperm whale, which is a vulnerable species.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/41755/0 |title=Physeter macrocephalus |publisher=International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources |accessdate=31 January 2013 }}</ref>

This was because the fragrance covered the smell of the air which was believed to be a [[Miasma theory of disease|cause of plague]].

This substance has also been used historically as a [[flavor]]ing for food and is considered an [[aphrodisiac]] in some cultures.<ref name="uchicago1"/> During the [[Middle Ages]], Europeans used ambergris as a [[Pharmaceutical drug|medication]] for [[headache]]s, [[Common cold|colds]], [[epilepsy]], and other ailments.<ref name=sciam />

===Legality===
{{Main|International Whaling Commission#1986 moratorium}}
From the 18th to the mid 19th century, the whaling industry prospered. By some reports, nearly 5,000 whales, including sperm whales, were killed each year. Due to studies showing that the whale populations were being threatened, the International Whaling Commission instituted a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1986. Although ambergris is not harvested from whales, many countries also ban the trade of ambergris as part of the more general ban on the hunting and exploitation of whales.

Urine, faeces and ambergris (that has been naturally excreted by a sperm whale) are waste products not considered parts or derivatives of a CITES species and are therefore not covered by the provisions of the Convention.<ref>CITES CoP16 Com. II Rec. 2 (Rev. 1), Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, Sixteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties Bangkok (Thailand), 3–14 March 2013

'''Illegal'''
*Australia – Under federal law, the export and import of ambergris for commercial purposes is banned by the [[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]].

In chapter 91 of [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' (1851), Stubb, one of the mates of the ''[[Pequod (Moby-Dick)|Pequod]],'' fools the captain of a French whaler (''Rose-bud'') into abandoning the corpse of a sperm whale found floating in the sea. His plan is to recover the corpse himself in hopes that it contains ambergris. His hope proves well founded, and the ''Pequod'''s crew recovers a valuable quantity of the substance.<ref>[[s:Moby-Dick/Chapter 91|''Moby-Dick'', Chapter 91]] at [[Wikisource]].</ref> Melville devotes the following chapter to a discussion of ambergris, with special attention to the irony that "fine ladies and gentlemen should regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale."<ref>[[s:Moby-Dick/Chapter 92|''Moby-Dick'', Chapter 92]] at [[Wikisource]].</ref>

In the 2001 film ''[[Hannibal (film)|Hannibal]]'', [[Hannibal Lecter]] sends Clarice Starling a letter which he writes while intentionally wearing a hand lotion containing ambergris, correctly assuming that this would lead her to discover his location in [[Florence, Italy]], due to lotion utilizing ambergris being legal in only a few countries.

Ambergris plays a prominent role in the plot of the 2003 ''[[Futurama]]'' episode "[[Three Hundred Big Boys]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theinfosphere.org/Three_Hundred_Big_Boys#Act_III:_.22The_loot.21_The_loot.21.21_The_loot_is_on_fire.21.21.22 |title=Three Hundred Big Boys - The Infosphere, the Futurama Wiki |publisher=Theinfosphere.org |accessdate=2014-03-13}}</ref> The episode guest-stars [[Roseanne Barr]], who appears as a hologram of herself, reading the dictionary definition of "ambergris."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0584461/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_10|title=Futurama: Season 5, Episode 11 : Three Hundred Big Boys (15 June 2003)|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2014-03-13}}</ref>

The 1969 book ''[[The Lost Ones (novel)|The Lost Ones]]'' by Ian Cameron, later made into Disney's 1974 film ''[[The Island at the Top of the World]]'' depicts a dirigible trip to the 'Whale Graveyard' where they find so much ambergris that it becomes a point of contention.

In the 1956 episode "Whale Gold" of the British television series ''[[The Buccaneers (TV series)|The Buccaneers]]'', a crew of eighteenth-century pirates led by Captain Dan Tempest (actor [[Robert Shaw (British actor)|Robert Shaw]]) find large pieces of ambergris at sea and on a beach, discoveries that lead to quarrels and death due to "whale gold fever."

The plot of [[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]] 1963 episode [[Killer Whale (The Avengers)|Killer Whale]] revolves around an ambergris smuggling operation.

In the 2014 episode "[[Ambergris (Bob's Burgers)|Ambergris]]" of the television program ''[[Bob's Burgers]]'', a lump of ambergris found on the beach plays an important role, as Louise, Tina, and Gene attempt to sell the ambergris illegally for $30,000.

In "[[Sinbad the Sailor#The Sixth Voyage of Sinbad the Sailor|The Sixth Voyage of Sinbad the Sailor]]" in "The Arabian Nights" by [[Richard Francis Burton|Sir Richard Burton]], Sinbad finds vast quantities of Ambergris after being shipwrecked on an unknown island after setting sail from [[Basra|Bassorāh]].

In "A Romance of Perfume Lands or the Search for Capt. Jacob Cole", F. S. Clifford, October 1881, the last chapter concerns one of the novel's characters discovering an area off of remote island which contains large amounts of ambergris. He hopes to use this knowledge to help make his fortune in the manufacture of perfumes.
