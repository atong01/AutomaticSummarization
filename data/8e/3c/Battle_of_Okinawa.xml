By the night of 8 April, U.S. troops had cleared these and several other strongly fortified positions. They suffered over 1,500 battle casualties in the process, while killing or capturing about 4,500 Japanese, yet the battle had only just begun, for it was now realized they were merely outposts guarding the Shuri Line.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:OkinawaMarinesDeadJapanese.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>U.S. Marines pass a dead Japanese soldier in a destroyed village, April 1945.</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>The next American objective was<space/><link><target>Kakazu Ridge</target></link>, two hills with a connecting saddle that formed part of Shuri's outer defenses. The Japanese had prepared their positions well and fought tenaciously. The Japanese soldiers hid in fortified caves. The U.S. forces often lost men before clearing the Japanese out from each cave or other hiding place. The Japanese sent Okinawans at gunpoint out to acquire water and supplies for them, which led to civilian casualties. The American advance was inexorable but resulted in a high number of casualties on both sides.</paragraph><paragraph>As the American assault against Kakazu Ridge stalled, Gen. Ushijima influenced by Gen. Ch decided to take the offensive. On the evening of 12 April, the 32nd Army attacked U.S. positions across the entire front. The Japanese attack was heavy, sustained, and well organized. After fierce<space/><link><target>close combat</target></link><space/>the attackers retreated, only to repeat their offensive the following night. A final assault on 14 April was again repulsed. The effort led 32nd Army's staff to conclude that the Americans were vulnerable to night<space/><link><target>infiltration tactics</target></link>, but that their superior firepower made any offensive Japanese troop concentrations extremely dangerous, and they reverted to their defensive strategy.</paragraph><paragraph>The 27th Infantry Divisionwhich had landed on 9 Apriltook over on the right, along the west coast of Okinawa.
