General Amasis, sent to meet them and quell the revolt, was proclaimed king by the rebels instead, and Apries, who had now to rely entirely on his mercenaries, was defeated. Apries fled to the Babylonians and was killed mounting an invasion of his native homeland in 567 B.C.E. with the aid of a Babylonian army. An inscription confirms the struggle between the native Egyptian and the foreign soldiery, and proves that Apries was killed and honourably buried in the third year of Amasis (c.567 B.C.E.).<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">January 2011</arg></template><space/>Amasis then married Chedebnitjerbone II, one of the daughters of his predecessor<space/><link><target>Apries</target></link>, in order to legitimise his kingship.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">January 2011</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Some information is known about the family origins of Amasis: his mother was a certain Tashereniset as a bust statue of this lady, which is today located in the British Museum, shows.<extension extension_name='ref'>Aidan Dodson &amp; Dyan Hilton, The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt, Thames &amp; Hudson, 2004. pp.245 &amp; 247</extension><space/>A stone block from Mehallet el-Kubra also establishes that his maternal grandmotherTashereniset's motherwas a certain Tjenmutetj.<extension extension_name='ref'>Dodson &amp; Hilton, pp.245 &amp; 247</extension></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Herodotus</target></link><space/>describes how Amasis II would eventually cause a confrontation with the Persian armies.
