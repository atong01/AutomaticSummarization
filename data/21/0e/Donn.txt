According to [[Irish mythology]], '''Donn''', or '''the Dark One''', is the Lord of the Dead and father of [[Diarmuid Ua Duibhne]], whom he gave to [[Aengus|Aengus Óg]] to be nurtured.  Donn is regarded as the father of the [[Irish people|Irish race]]; a position similar to that of [[Dis Pater]] and the [[Gaul]]s, as noted by [[Julius Caesar]].

Originally, Donn was the chief of the Sons of Mil, a mythological race who invaded [[Ireland]], ousting the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]]. Donn slighted [[Ériu]], one of the [[eponymous]] goddesses of Ireland, and he was drowned off the south-west coast of the island. A place near this spot, on a small rocky island named 'Tech nDuinn' ('the House of Donn'), became Donn's dwelling place as god of the dead. This house was the assembly place for the dead before they began the journey to the [[Otherworld]]. He is similar in some regards to the [[Hindu]] deity [[Yama]].

Knockfierna, [[County Limerick]] was Donn Fírinne's residence. Cnoc Fírinne (meaning 'Hill of Truth') takes its name from Donn, who is said to forewarn the local people of bad weather by gathering up rain clouds around him on the hill.

Donn is also associated with [[Doonbeg]], County Clare, specifically the sand dunes located near the modern-day golf course.
In modern [[Irish language|Irish]], the word for the colour [[brown]] is "donn".
