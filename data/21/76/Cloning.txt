In biology, '''cloning''' is the process of producing similar populations of genetically identical individuals that occurs in nature when organisms such as [[bacteria]], [[insect]]s or [[plant]]s reproduce [[Asexual reproduction|asexually]]. Cloning in [[biotechnology]] refers to processes used to create copies of [[DNA]] fragments ([[molecular cloning]]), [[Cell (biology)|cells]] (cell cloning), or [[organisms]]. The term also refers to the production of multiple copies of a product such as [[digital media]] or [[software]].

The term '''clone''', invented by [[J. B. S. Haldane]], is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] word [[wikt:κλών#Ancient Greek|κλών]] ''klōn'', "twig", referring to the process whereby a new plant can be created from a twig. In [[horticulture]], the spelling ''clon'' was used until the twentieth century; the final ''e'' came into use to indicate the vowel is a "long o" instead of a "short o".<ref>{{Cite journal

==Natural cloning==

Cloning is a natural form of reproduction that has allowed life forms to spread for more than 50 thousand years. It is the reproduction method used by  [[plant]]s, [[fungi]], and [[bacteria]], and is also the way that [[Clonal colony|clonal colonies]] reproduce themselves.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.exn.ca/Stories/1996/10/21/01.asp |title=Tasmanian bush could be oldest living organism |accessdate=2008-05-07 |publisher=[[Discovery Channel]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiza-spotlight.com/news/2006/monster_plant_280506_i.htm |title=Ibiza's Monster Marine Plant |accessdate=2008-05-07 |publisher=Ibiza Spotlight }}</ref> Examples of these organisms include [[Vaccinium corymbosum|Blueberry plants]], [[Hazel|Hazel trees,]] [[Pando (tree)|Pando trees]],<ref>{{cite journal|author=DeWoody, J.; Rowe, C.A.; Hipkins, V.D.; Mock, K.E. |date=2008 |title= "Pando" Lives: Molecular Genetic Evidence of a Giant Aspen Clone in Central Utah |journal=Western North American Naturalist |volume=68 |issue=4 |pages=493–497 |doi=10.3398/1527-0904-68.4.493}}</ref><ref name="NALDC">{{cite web | url=http://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/27665/PDF | title=Blackwell Publishing Ltd Clonal dynamics in western North American aspen (Populus  tremuloides) | publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture, Oxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltd | date=2008 | accessdate=2013-12-05 | author=Mock, K.E. , Rowe, C.A. , Hooten, M.B. , Dewoody, J. , Hipkins, V.D. | pages=17}}</ref> the [[Kentucky coffeetree]], [[Myrica|Myricas,]] and the [[Liquidambar styraciflua|American sweetgum.]]

==Molecular cloning==
{{Main|Molecular cloning}}
Molecular cloning refers to the process of making multiple molecules. Cloning is commonly used to amplify [[DNA]] fragments containing whole [[genes]], but it can also be used to amplify any DNA sequence such as [[Promoter (biology)|promoters]], non-coding sequences and randomly fragmented DNA. It is used in a wide array of biological experiments and practical applications ranging from [[genetic fingerprinting]] to large scale protein production. Occasionally, the term cloning is misleadingly used to refer to the identification of the [[chromosome|chromosomal]] location of a gene associated with a particular phenotype of interest, such as in [[positional cloning]]. In practice, localization of the gene to a chromosome or genomic region does not necessarily enable one to isolate or amplify the relevant genomic sequence. To amplify any DNA sequence in a living organism, that sequence must be linked to an [[origin of replication]], which is a sequence of DNA capable of directing the propagation of itself and any linked sequence. However, a number of other features are needed and a variety of specialised [[cloning vector]]s (small piece of DNA into which a foreign DNA fragment can be inserted) exist that allow [[protein expression]], tagging, single stranded [[RNA]] and DNA production and a host of other manipulations.

Cloning of any DNA fragment essentially involves four steps<ref>{{cite book |title=iGenetics: A Molecular Approach |author= Peter J. Russel |year= 2005 |isbn=0-8053-4665-1 |location=San Francisco, California, United States of America |publisher=Pearson Education}}</ref>
# fragmentation - breaking apart a strand of DNA
# [[DNA ligase|ligation]] - gluing together pieces of DNA in a desired sequence
# [[transfection]] - inserting the newly formed pieces of DNA into cells
# screening/selection - selecting out the cells that were successfully transfected with the new DNA

Although these steps are invariable among cloning procedures a number of alternative routes can be selected;  these are summarized as a ''cloning strategy''.

Initially, the DNA of interest needs to be isolated to provide a DNA segment of suitable size. Subsequently, a ligation procedure is used where the amplified fragment is inserted into a [[vector (molecular biology)|vector]] (piece of DNA). The vector (which is frequently circular) is linearised using [[restriction enzyme]]s, and incubated with the fragment of interest under appropriate conditions with an enzyme called [[DNA ligase]]. Following ligation the vector with the insert of interest is transfected into cells. A number of alternative techniques are available, such as chemical sensitivation of cells, [[electroporation]], [[optical injection]] and [[biolistics]]. Finally, the transfected cells are cultured. As the aforementioned procedures are of particularly low efficiency, there is a need to identify the cells that have been successfully transfected with the vector construct containing the desired insertion sequence in the required orientation. Modern cloning vectors include selectable [[antibiotic]] resistance markers, which allow only cells in which the vector has been transfected, to grow. Additionally, the cloning vectors may contain colour selection markers, which provide blue/white screening (alpha-factor complementation) on [[X-gal]] medium. Nevertheless, these selection steps do not absolutely guarantee that the DNA insert is present in the cells obtained. Further investigation of the resulting colonies must be required to confirm that cloning was successful. This may be accomplished by means of [[PCR]], restriction fragment analysis and/or [[DNA sequencing]].

== Cell cloning ==

===Cloning unicellular organisms===
[[File:Human cell-line colony being cloned in vitro through use of cloning rings.jpg|right|thumb|Cloning cell-line colonies using cloning rings]]
Cloning a cell means to derive a population of cells from a single cell. In the case of unicellular organisms such as bacteria and yeast, this process is remarkably simple and essentially only requires the [[inoculation]] of the appropriate medium. However, in the case of cell cultures from multi-cellular organisms, cell cloning is an arduous task as these cells will not readily grow in standard media.

A useful tissue culture technique used to clone distinct lineages of cell lines involves the use of cloning rings (cylinders).<ref name="CloningRings">{{cite journal|last=McFarland|first=Douglas|authorlink=Douglas McFarland|year=2000|title= Preparation of pure cell cultures by cloning|journal=Methods in Cell Science|volume=22|issue=1|pages=63–66|pmid=10650336|doi= 10.1023/A:1009838416621}}</ref> According to this technique, a single-cell suspension of cells that have been exposed to a [[mutagen|mutagenic agent]] or drug used to drive [[Selection (biology)|selection]] is plated at high dilution to create isolated colonies, each arising from a single and potentially clonal distinct cell. At an early growth stage when colonies consist of only a few cells, sterile [[polystyrene]] rings (cloning rings), which have been dipped in grease, are placed over an individual colony and a small amount of [[trypsin]] is added. Cloned cells are collected from inside the ring and transferred to a new vessel for further growth.

=== Cloning stem cells ===
{{Main|Somatic-cell nuclear transfer}}
[[Somatic-cell nuclear transfer]], known as SCNT, can also be used to create embryos for research or therapeutic purposes. The most likely purpose for this is to produce embryos for use in [[stem cell research]]. This process is also called "research cloning" or "therapeutic cloning." The goal is not to create cloned human beings (called "reproductive cloning"), but rather to harvest stem cells that can be used to study human development and to potentially treat disease. While a clonal human blastocyst has been created, stem cell lines are yet to be isolated from a clonal source.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/health/blog/2008/01/california_biot.html|title=California biotech says it cloned a human embryo, but no stem cells produced|first=Gideon|last=Gil|publisher=Boston Globe|date=2008-01-17}}</ref>

Therapeutic cloning is achieved by creating embryonic stem cells in the hopes of treating diseases such as diabetes and Alzheimer's. The process begins by removing the nucleus (containing the DNA) from an egg cell and inserting a nucleus from the adult cell to be cloned.<ref name="Halim">{{cite web |last=Halim |first=N. |date=September 2002 |title=Extensive new study shows abnormalities in cloned animals |accessdate=October 2011 |publisher=Massachusetts institute of technology |url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2002/cloning-0911.html}}</ref> In the case of someone with Alzheimer's disease, the nucleus from a skin cell of that patient is placed into an empty egg. The reprogrammed cell begins to develop into an embryo because the egg reacts with the transferred nucleus. The embryo will become genetically identical to the patient.<ref name=Halim /> The embryo will then form a blastocyst which has the potential to form/become any cell in the body.<ref name="Plus">{{cite web |last=Plus |first=M. |year=2011 |title= Fetal development |accessdate=October 2011 |url= http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002398.htm |publisher=Nlm.nih.gov }}</ref>

The reason why SCNT is used for cloning is because somatic cells can be easily acquired and cultured in the lab. This process can either add or delete specific genomes of farm animals. A key point to remember is that cloning is achieved when the oocyte maintains its normal functions and instead of using sperm and egg genomes to replicate, the oocyte is inserted into the donor’s somatic cell nucleus.<ref name="Latham">{{cite web |last=Latham |first=K. E. |year=2005 |title= Early and delayed aspects of nuclear reprogramming during cloning |publisher=Biology of the Cell |pages=97, 119–132 |url=http://submit.biolcell.org/boc/097/0119/0970119.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=}}</ref> The oocyte will react on the somatic cell nucleus, the same way it would on sperm cells.<ref name=Latham />

The process of cloning a particular farm animal using SCNT is relatively the same for all animals. The first step is to collect the somatic cells from the animal that will be cloned. The somatic cells could be used immediately or stored in the laboratory for later use.<ref name=Latham /> The hardest part of SCNT is removing maternal DNA from an oocyte at metaphase II. Once this has been done, the somatic nucleus can be inserted into an egg cytoplasm.<ref name=Latham /> This creates a one-cell embryo. The grouped somatic cell and egg cytoplasm are then introduced to an electrical current.<ref name=Latham /> This energy will hopefully allow the cloned embryo to begin development. The successfully developed embryos are then placed in surrogate recipients, such as a cow or sheep in the case of farm animals.<ref name=Latham />

SCNT is seen as a good method for producing agriculture animals for food consumption. It successfully cloned sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs. Another benefit is SCNT is seen as a solution to clone endangered species that are on the verge of going extinct.<ref name=Latham /> However, stresses placed on both the egg cell and the introduced nucleus are enormous, leading to a high loss in resulting cells. For example, [[Dolly (sheep)|the cloned sheep Dolly]] was born after 277 eggs were used for SCNT, which created 29 viable embryos. Only three of these embryos survived until birth, and only one survived to adulthood.<ref name=Campbell>{{cite journal |author=Campbell KH, McWhir J, Ritchie WA, Wilmut I |title=Sheep cloned by nuclear transfer from a cultured cell line |journal=Nature |volume=380 |issue=6569 |pages=64–6 |date=March 1996 |pmid=8598906 |doi=10.1038/380064a0 |url=}}</ref> As the procedure currently cannot be automated, and has to be performed manually under a [[microscope]], SCNT is very resource intensive. The biochemistry involved in reprogramming the [[cellular differentiation|differentiated]] somatic cell nucleus and activating the recipient egg is also far from being well-understood.

In SCNT, not all of the donor cell's genetic information is transferred, as the donor cell's [[mitochondria]] that contain their own [[mitochondrial DNA]] are left behind. The resulting hybrid cells retain those mitochondrial structures which originally belonged to the egg. As a consequence, clones such as Dolly that are born from SCNT are not perfect copies of the donor of the nucleus.

== Organism cloning ==
{{Further|Asexual reproduction}}
'''Organism cloning''' (also called reproductive cloning) refers to the procedure of creating a new multicellular organism, genetically identical to another. In essence this form of cloning is an asexual method of reproduction, where fertilization or inter-gamete contact does not take place. Asexual reproduction is a naturally occurring phenomenon in many species, including most plants (see [[vegetative reproduction]]) and some insects. Scientists have made some major achievements with cloning, including the asexual reproduction of sheep and cows. There is a lot of ethical debate over whether or not cloning should be used. However, cloning, or asexual propagation,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/plantanswers/misc/asexualpropagation.html |title=Asexual Propagation |publisher=Aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-04}}</ref> has been common practice in the horticultural world for hundreds of years.

=== Horticultural ===
{{For|the use of cloning in viticulture|Propagation of grapevines}}
The term ''clone'' is used in horticulture to refer to descendants of a single plant which were produced by [[vegetative reproduction]] or [[apomixis]]. Many horticultural plant [[cultivar]]s are clones, having been derived from a single individual, multiplied by some process other than sexual reproduction.<ref>Sagers, Larry A. (2 March 2009) [http://www.usu.edu/ust/pdf/2009/march/itn03030976.pdf Proliferate favorite trees by grafting, cloning] Utah Stae University, Deseret News (Salt Lake City) Retrieved 21 February 2014</ref> As an example, some European cultivars of [[grape]]s represent clones that have been propagated for over two millennia. Other examples are [[potato]] and [[banana]].<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1102001108| title = Multidisciplinary perspectives on banana (''Musa'' spp.) domestication| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| volume = 108|url=http://www.agr.kuleuven.ac.be/nieuws/fiches/PNAS-110720.pdf| issue = 28| pages = 11311–11318| year = 2011| last1 = Perrier | first1 = X.| last2 = De Langhe | first2 = E.| last3 = Donohue | first3 = M.| last4 = Lentfer | first4 = C.| last5 = Vrydaghs | first5 = L.| last6 = Bakry | first6 = F.| last7 = Carreel | first7 = F.| last8 = Hippolyte | first8 = I.| last9 = Horry | first9 = J. -P. | last10 = Jenny | first10 = C.| last11 = Lebot | first11 = V.| last12 = Risterucci | first12 = A. -M. | last13 = Tomekpe | first13 = K.| last14 = Doutrelepont | first14 = H.| last15 = Ball | first15 = T.| last16 = Manwaring | first16 = J.| last17 = De Maret | first17 = P.| last18 = Denham | first18 = T.}}</ref> [[Grafting]] can be regarded as cloning, since all the shoots and branches coming from the graft are genetically a clone of a single individual, but this particular kind of cloning has not come under [[ethics|ethical]] scrutiny and is generally treated as an entirely different kind of operation.

Many [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s, [[vine]]s, [[fern]]s and other [[perennials|herbaceous perennial]]s form [[clonal colony|clonal colonies]] naturally. Parts of an individual plant may become detached by [[Fragmentation (cell biology)|fragmentation]] and grow on to become separate clonal individuals. A common example is in the vegetative reproduction of moss and liverwort gametophyte clones by means of [[gemma (botany)|gemmae]]. Some vascular plants e.g. [[dandelion]] and certain [[vivipary|viviparous]] grasses also form [[seed]]s asexually, termed [[apomixis]], resulting in clonal populations of genetically identical individuals.

=== Parthenogenesis ===
Clonal derivation exists in nature in some animal species and is referred to as [[parthenogenesis]] (reproduction of an organism by itself without a mate). This is an asexual form of reproduction that is only found in females of some insects, crustaceans, nematodes,<ref>Castagnone-Sereno P, et al. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23682915 Diversity and evolution of root-knot nematodes, genus Meloidogyne: new insights from the genomic era] Annu Rev Phytopathol. 2013;51:203-20</ref> fish (for example the [[Hammerhead shark]]<ref name =NYTShubin>Shubin, Neil (24 February 2008) [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/opinion/24shubin.html?_r=0 Birds Do It. Bees Do It. Dragons Don’t Need To] New York Times, Retrieved 21 February 2014</ref>), the [[Komodo dragon]]<ref name =NYTShubin/> and [[whiptail lizard|lizards]]. The growth and development occurs without fertilization by a male. In plants, parthenogenesis means the development of an embryo from an unfertilized egg cell, and is a component process of apomixis. In species that use the [[XY sex-determination system]], the offspring will always be female. An example is the little fire ant (''[[Wasmannia auropunctata]]''), which is native to [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]] but has spread throughout many tropical environments.

=== Artificial cloning of organisms ===
Artificial cloning of organisms may also be called ''reproductive cloning''.

==== First moves ====
[[Hans Spemann]], a [[Germans|German]] [[embryologist]] was awarded a [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1935 for his discovery of the effect now known as embryonic induction, exercised by various parts of the embryo, that directs the development of groups of cells into particular tissues and organs. In 1928 he and his student, [[Hilde Mangold]], were the first to perform [[somatic-cell nuclear transfer]] using [[amphibian]] embryos – one of the first moves towards cloning.<ref>Explanation of the Spemann-Mangold experiment from a Nature Reviews article http://www.nature.com/nrm/journal/v7/n4/box/nrm1855_BX1.html</ref>

==== Methods ====
Reproductive cloning generally uses "[[somatic cell nuclear transfer]]" (SCNT) to create animals that are genetically identical. This process entails the transfer of a nucleus from a donor adult cell (somatic cell) to an egg from which the nucleus has been removed, or to a cell from a [[blastocyst]] from which the nucleus has been removed.<ref name=HumanGenomeInfo>{{cite web|title=Cloning Fact Sheet|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml|publisher=Human Genome Project Information|accessdate=25 October 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502125744/http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml|archivedate=2 May 2013}}</ref> If the egg begins to divide normally it is transferred into the uterus of the surrogate mother. Such clones are not strictly identical since the somatic cells may contain mutations in their nuclear DNA. Additionally, the [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] in the [[cytoplasm]] also contains DNA and during SCNT this mitochondrial DNA is wholly from the cytoplasmic donor's egg, thus the [[mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] genome is not the same as that of the nucleus donor cell from which it was produced. This may have important implications for cross-species nuclear transfer in which nuclear-mitochondrial incompatibilities may lead to death.

Artificial ''embryo splitting'' or ''embryo twinning'', a technique that creates monozygotic twins from a single embryo, is not considered in the same fashion as other methods of cloning. During that procedure, an donor [[embryo]] is split in two distinct embryos, that can then be transferred via [[embryo transfer]]. It is optimally performed at the 6- to 8-cell stage, where it can be used as an expansion of [[IVF]] to increase the number of available embryos.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Illmensee K, Levanduski M, Vidali A, Husami N, Goudas VT |title=Human embryo twinning with applications in reproductive medicine |journal=Fertil.

[[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly]], a [[Finn-Dorset]] [[domestic sheep|ewe]], was the first mammal to have been successfully cloned from an adult cell.

Dolly was publicly significant because the effort showed that genetic material from a specific adult cell, programmed to express only a distinct subset of its genes, can be reprogrammed to grow an entirely new organism. Before this demonstration, it had been shown by John Gurdon that nuclei from differentiated cells could give rise to an entire organism after transplantation into an enucleated egg.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gurdon J | journal=Dev Biol. | date= Apr 1962 | volume=4| pages=256–73 | title=Adult frogs derived from the nuclei of single somatic cells | PMID= 13903027 | doi=10.1016/0012-1606(62)90043-x}}</ref> However, this concept was not yet demonstrated in a mammalian system.

The first mammalian cloning (resulting in Dolly the sheep) had a success rate per 277 fertilized eggs of 29 embryos, which produced three lambs at birth, one of which lived. For a bovine experiment involving seventy cloned calves, one third of them died young. For horses, [[Prometea]] took 814 attempts. Notably, although the first clones were frogs, no adult cloned frog has yet been produced from a somatic adult nucleus donor cell.

There were early claims that [[Dolly the sheep]] had pathologies resembling accelerated aging. Scientists speculated that Dolly's death in 2003 was related to the shortening of [[telomere]]s, DNA-protein complexes that protect the end of linear [[chromosome]]s. However, other researchers, including [[Ian Wilmut]] who led the team that successfully cloned Dolly, argue that Dolly's early death due to respiratory infection was unrelated to deficiencies with the cloning process. This idea that the nuclei have not irreversibly aged was shown in 2013 to be true for mice.<ref name="Wakayama" />

Dolly was named after performer [[Dolly Parton]] because the cells cloned to make her were from a [[mammary gland]] cell, and Parton is known for her ample cleavage.<ref name=BBCname>BBC. 22 February 2008.

==== Human cloning ====
{{Main|Human cloning}}
Human cloning is the creation of a genetically identical copy of a human. The term is generally used to refer to artificial human cloning, which is the reproduction of human cells and tissues. It does not refer to the natural conception and delivery of [[monozygotic|identical]] [[multiple birth|twins]].  The possibility of human cloning has raised [[ethics of cloning|controversies]]. These ethical concerns have prompted several nations to pass [[legislature]] regarding human cloning and its legality.

Two commonly discussed types of theoretical human cloning are ''therapeutic cloning'' and ''reproductive cloning''. Therapeutic cloning would involve cloning cells from a human for use in medicine and transplants, and is an active area of research, but is not in medical practice anywhere in the world, as of 2014. Two common methods of therapeutic cloning that are being researched are [[somatic-cell nuclear transfer]] and, more recently, [[Induced pluripotent stem cell|pluripotent stem cell induction]]. Reproductive cloning would involve making an entire cloned human, instead of just specific cells or tissues.<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">{{cite journal | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2323472/ | pmid = 18523539 | volume=10 | title=Therapeutic cloning: promises and issues | pmc=2323472 | date=July 2007 | journal=Mcgill J Med | pages=112–20}}</ref>

==== Ethical issues of cloning ====
{{Main|Ethics of cloning}}

There are a variety of [[bioethics|ethical]] positions regarding the possibilities of cloning, especially [[human cloning]]. While many of these views are [[religious]] in origin, the questions raised by cloning are faced by [[secular]] perspectives as well.  Perspectives on human cloning are theoretical, as human therapeutic and reproductive cloning are not commercially used; animals are currently cloned in laboratories and in livestock production.

Advocates support development of therapeutic cloning in order to generate tissues and whole organs to treat patients who otherwise cannot obtain transplants,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml#organsQ |title=Cloning Fact Sheet |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502125744/http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy Genome Program |date=2009-05-11 |archivedate=2013-05-02}}</ref> to avoid the need for [[immunosuppressive drugs]],<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/> and to stave off the effects of aging.<ref name=EndingAging>de Grey, Aubrey; Rae, Michael (September 2007).

Opponents of cloning have concerns that technology is not yet developed enough to be safe,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.aaas.org/spp/sfrl/docs/cloningstatement.shtml| title = AAAS Statement on Human Cloning}}</ref> that it could be prone to abuse (leading to the generation of humans from whom organs and tissues would be harvested),<ref name="McGee">{{cite web |last=McGee |first=G.  |title= Primer on Ethics and Human Cloning |date=October 2011 |publisher=American Institute of Biological Sciences |url=http://www.actionbioscience.org/biotech/mcgee.html }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |publisher=UNESCO |date=1997-11-11 |url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13177&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights |accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref> and have concerns about how cloned individuals could integrate with families and with society at large.<ref>McGee, Glenn (2000).

==== Cloning extinct and endangered species ====
Cloning, or more precisely, the reconstruction of functional DNA from [[extinct]] species has, for decades, been a dream.

In 2001, a cow named Bessie gave birth to a cloned Asian [[gaur]], an endangered species, but the calf died after two days. In 2003, a [[banteng]] was successfully cloned, followed by three African wildcats from a thawed frozen embryo. These successes provided hope that similar techniques (using surrogate mothers of another species) might be used to clone extinct species. Anticipating this possibility, tissue samples from the last ''bucardo'' ([[Pyrenean ibex]]) were frozen in [[liquid nitrogen]] immediately after it died in 2000. Researchers are also considering cloning endangered species such as the giant panda and cheetah.

In 2002, geneticists at the [[Australian Museum]] announced that they had replicated DNA of the [[thylacine]] (Tasmanian tiger), at the time extinct for about 65 years, using [[polymerase chain reaction]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/auspac/05/28/aust.thylacines/|title=Cloning to revive extinct species|first=Grant|last=Holloway|publisher=CNN.com|date=2002-05-28}}</ref> However, on 15 February 2005 the museum announced that it was stopping the project after tests showed the specimens' DNA had been too badly degraded by the ([[ethanol]]) preservative. On 15 May 2005 it was announced that the thylacine project would be revived, with new participation from researchers in [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

In January 2009, for the first time, an extinct animal, the Pyrenean ibex mentioned above was cloned, at the Centre of Food Technology and Research of Aragon, using the preserved frozen cell nucleus of the skin samples from 2001 and domestic goat egg-cells. The ibex died shortly after birth due to physical defects in its lungs.<ref name="The Telegraph">{{cite news | title =Extinct ibex is resurrected by cloning | url =http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/science/sciencenews/4409958/Extinct-ibex-is-resurrected-by-cloning.html | accessdate = 2009-02-01 |work = The Telegraph | location=London | first1=Richard | last1=Gray | first2=Roger | last2=Dobson | date=31 January 2009}}</ref>

One of the most anticipated targets for cloning was once the [[woolly mammoth]], but attempts to extract DNA from frozen mammoths have been unsuccessful, though a joint Russo-Japanese team is currently working toward this goal.  In January 2011, it was reported by Yomiuri Shimbun that a team of scientists headed by Akira Iritani of Kyoto University had built upon research by Dr. Wakayama, saying that they will extract DNA from a mammoth carcass that had been preserved in a Russian laboratory and insert it into the egg cells of an African elephant in hopes of producing a mammoth embryo. The researchers said they hoped to produce a baby mammoth within six years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3075381.stm|title=Scientists 'to clone mammoth'|publisher=BBC News|date=2003-08-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16068581 |title=BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-12-07 |accessdate=2012-08-19}}</ref> It was noted, however that the result, if possible, would be an elephant-mammoth hybrid rather than a true mammoth.<ref name=rure>[http://expert.ru/russian_reporter/2015/05/kogda-oni-vernutsya/ "Когда вернутся мамонты"] ("When the Mammoths Return"), February 5, 2015 (retrieved September 6, 2015)</ref> Another problem is the survival of the reconstructed mammoth: [[ruminant]]s rely on a [[symbiosis]] with specific [[microbiota]] in their stomachs for digestion.<ref name=rure/>

Scientists at the [[University of Newcastle (Australia)|University of Newcastle]] and [[University of New South Wales]] announced in March 2013 that the very recently extinct [[gastric-brooding frog]] would be the subject of a cloning attempt to resurrect the species.<ref name="National Geographic">{{cite web|last=Yong|first=Ed|title=Resurrecting the Extinct Frog with a Stomach for a Womb|work=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|date=2013-03-15|url=http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/03/15/resurrecting-the-extinct-frog-with-a-stomach-for-a-womb/|accessdate=2013-03-15}}</ref>

After an eight-year project involving the use of a pioneering cloning technique, Japanese researchers created 25 generations of healthy cloned mice with normal lifespans, demonstrating that clones are not intrinsically shorter-lived than naturally born animals.<ref name="Wakayama">{{cite journal| journal=Cell Stem Cell. | date = 7 March 2013  | volume=12 |issue=3 | pages=293–7 | title=Successful serial recloning in the mouse over multiple generations | author=Wakayama S1, Kohda T, Obokata H, Tokoro M, Li C, Terashita Y, Mizutani E, Nguyen VT, Kishigami S, Ishino F, Wakayama T | PMID = 23472871 | doi=10.1016/j.stem.2013.01.005}}</ref><ref name="gen25">{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/03/130307122958.htm|title=Generations of Cloned Mice With Normal Lifespans Created: 25th Generation and Counting|publisher=Science Daily|date=7 March 2013|accessdate=8 March 2013}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
In an article in the 8 November 1993 article of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', cloning was portrayed in a negative way, modifying Michelangelo's ''[[Creation of Adam]]'' to depict Adam with five identical hands. ''[[Newsweek]]'''s 10 March 1997 issue also critiqued the ethics of human cloning, and included a graphic depicting identical babies in beakers.

Cloning is a recurring theme in a wide variety of contemporary [[science fiction]], ranging from action films such as ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993), ''[[The 6th Day]]'' (2000), ''[[Resident Evil (film)|Resident Evil]]'' (2002), ''[[Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones|Star Wars]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Island (2005 film)|The Island]]'' (2005), to comedies such as [[Woody Allen]]'s 1973 film ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070707/|title=Sleeper (1973)|author=planktonrules|date=17 December 1973|work=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}</ref>

Science fiction has used cloning, most commonly and specifically human cloning, due to the fact that it brings up controversial questions of identity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hopkins|first=Patrick|title=How Popular media represent cloning as an ethical problem|jstor=3527566|publisher=The Hastings Center|volume=28|pages=6–13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csustan.edu/honors/documents/journals/thresholds/Delacruz.pdf |title=Yvonne A.

The story, set in the near future, is structured around the conflict between a father (Salter) and his sons (Bernard 1, Bernard 2, and Michael Black) – two of whom are clones of the first one. ''A Number'' was adapted by Caryl Churchill for television, in a co-production between the [[BBC]] and [[HBO Films]].<ref>{{cite press release| title = Uma Thurman, Rhys Ifans and Tom Wilkinson star in two plays for BBC Two| publisher = BBC| date = 2008-06-19| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/06_june/19/stage.shtml| accessdate = 2008-09-09 }}</ref>

A recurring sub-theme of cloning fiction is the use of clones as a supply of [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] for [[Organ transplant|transplantation]]. The 2005 [[Kazuo Ishiguro]] novel ''[[Never Let Me Go (novel)|Never Let Me Go]]'' and the [[Never Let Me Go (2010 film)|2010 film adaption]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1334260/|title=Never Let Me Go (2010)|author=espenshade55|date=11 February 2011|work=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}</ref> are set in an [[alternate history]] in which cloned humans are created for the sole purpose of providing organ donations to naturally born humans, despite the fact that they are fully sentient and self-aware. The 2005 film ''[[The Island (2005 film)|The Island]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399201/|title=The Island (2005)|date=22 July 2005|work=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}</ref> revolves around a similar plot, with the exception that the clones are unaware of the reason for their existence.

The use of human cloning for military purposes has also been explored in several works.  ''[[Star Wars]]'' portrays human cloning in ''[[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1185834/|title=Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008)|author=compel_bast|date=15 August 2008|work=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}</ref>

The exploitation of human clones for dangerous and undesirable work was examined in the 2009 British science fiction film ''[[Moon (film)|Moon]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1182345/|title=Moon (2009)|author=larry-411|date=17 July 2009|work=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}</ref>  In the futuristic novel ''[[Cloud Atlas (novel)|Cloud Atlas]]'' and subsequent [[Cloud Atlas (film)|film]], one of the story lines focuses on a genetically-engineered fabricant clone named Sonmi~451 who is one of millions raised in an artificial "wombtank," destined to serve from birth. She is one of thousands of clones created for manual and [[emotional labor]]; Sonmi herself works as a server in a restaurant. She later discovers that the sole source of food for clones, called 'Soap', is manufactured from the clones themselves.<ref>[http://www.technewsdaily.com/8402-human-clones-cloud-atlas.html Could the Human Clones of 'Cloud Atlas' Be in Our Future?]</ref>

Cloning has been used in fiction as a way of recreating historical figures. In the 1976 [[Ira Levin]] novel ''[[The Boys from Brazil (novel)|The Boys from Brazil]]'' and its [[The Boys from Brazil (film)|1978 film adaptation]], [[Josef Mengele]] uses cloning to create copies of [[Adolf Hitler]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077269/|title=The Boys from Brazil (1978)|author=Christian Lee Pyle (CLPyle)|date=12 October 1978|work=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}</ref>

In 2012, a Japanese television show named "Bunshin" was created. The story's main character, Mariko, is a woman studying child welfare in Hokkaido. She grew up always doubtful about the love from her mother, who looked nothing like her and who died nine years before.
