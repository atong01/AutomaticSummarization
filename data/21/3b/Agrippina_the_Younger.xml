They married, and Crispus became a step-father to Lucius. Crispus was a prominent, influential, witty, wealthy and powerful man, who served twice as consul. He was the adopted grandson and biological great, great nephew of the historian<space/><link><target>Sallust</target></link>. Little is known on their relationship, but Crispus soon died and left his estate to Nero.</paragraph><paragraph>In the first years of Claudius' reign, Claudius was married to the infamous Empress<space/><link><target>Valeria Messalina</target></link>. Although Agrippina was very influential, she kept a very low profile and stayed away from the imperial palace and the court of the emperor. Messalina was Agrippina's second paternal cousin. Among the victims of Messalina's intrigues were Agrippina's surviving sister Livilla, who was charged with having adultery with<space/><link><target>Seneca the Younger</target></link>. Seneca was later called back from exile to be a tutor to Nero.</paragraph><paragraph>Messalina considered Agrippina's son a threat to her son's position and sent assassins to strangle Lucius during his siesta. The assassins fled in terror when they saw a snake suddenly dart from beneath Lucius' pillowbut it was only a sloughed-off snake-skin in his bed, near his pillow.</paragraph><paragraph>In 47, Crispus died, and at his funeral, the rumor spread around that Agrippina poisoned Crispus to gain his estate. After being widowed a second time, Agrippina was left very wealthy. Later that year at the<space/><link><target>Secular Games</target></link>, at the performance of the Troy Pageant, Messalina attended the event with her son Britannicus. Agrippina was also present with Lucius. Agrippina and Lucius received greater applause from the audience than Messalina and<space/><link><target>Britannicus</target></link><space/>did. Many people began to show pity and sympathy to Agrippina, due to the unfortunate circumstances in her life. Agrippina wrote a memoir that recorded the misfortunes of her family (casus suorum) and wrote an account of her mother's life.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Rise to power</heading><paragraph>After Messalina was executed in 48 for conspiring with<space/><link><target>Gaius Silius</target></link><space/>to overthrow her husband, Claudius considered remarrying for the fourth time. Around this time, Agrippina became the mistress to one of Claudius' advisers, the former Greek Freedman<space/><link><target>Pallas (freedman)</target><part>Marcus Antonius Pallas</part></link>. At that time Claudius' advisers were discussing which noblewoman Claudius should marry. Claudius had a reputation that he was easily persuaded. In more recent times, it has been suggested that the Senate may have pushed for the marriage between Agrippina and Claudius to end the feud between the Julian and Claudian branches.<extension extension_name='ref'>Scramuzza (1940) pp.&amp;nbsp;9192.

Claudius was seduced by her passions. Claudius made references to her in his speeches: &quot;my daughter and foster child, born and bred, in my lap, so to speak&quot;. When Claudius decided to marry her, he persuaded a group of senators that the marriage should be arranged in the public interest. In Roman society, an uncle (Claudius) marrying his niece (Agrippina) was considered incestuous, and obviously immoral.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Marriage to Claudius</heading><paragraph>Agrippina and Claudius married on New Year's Day, 49. This marriage caused widespread disapproval. This was a part of Agrippina's scheming plan to make Lucius the new emperor. Her marriage to Claudius was not based on love, but on power. She quickly eliminated her rival<space/><link><target>Lollia Paulina</target></link>. In 49, shortly after marrying Claudius, Agrippina charged Paulina with<space/><link><target>black magic</target></link>. Paulina did not receive a hearing. Her property was confiscated. She left Italy and, on Agrippina's orders, committed suicide.</paragraph><paragraph>In the months leading up to her marriage to Claudius, Agrippina's maternal second cousin, the<space/><link><target>praetor</target></link><space/><link><target>Lucius Junius Silanus Torquatus</target></link>, was betrothed to Claudius' daughter<space/><link><target>Claudia Octavia</target></link>. This betrothal was broken off in 48 when Agrippina, scheming with the consul<space/><link><target>Lucius Vitellius the Elder</target></link>, the father of the future Emperor<space/><link><target>Aulus Vitellius</target></link>, falsely accused Silanus of incest with his sister<space/><link><target>Junia Calvina</target></link>. Agrippina did this hoping to secure a marriage between Octavia and her son. Consequently, Claudius broke off the engagement and forced Silanus to resign from public office.</paragraph><paragraph>Silanus committed suicide on the day that Agrippina married her uncle, and Calvina was exiled from<space/><link><target>Italy</target></link><space/>in early 49.

Agrippina removed or eliminated anyone from the palace or the imperial court who she thought was loyal and dedicated to the memory of the late Messalina. She also eliminated or removed anyone who she considered was a potential threat to her position and the future of her son, one of her victims being Lucius' second paternal aunt and Messalina's mother<space/><link><target>Domitia Lepida the Younger</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>In 49, Agrippina was seated on a dais at a parade of captives when their leader the<space/><link><target>Celts</target><part>Celtic</part></link><space/>King<space/><link><target>Caratacus</target></link><space/>bowed before her with the same homage and gratitude as he accorded the emperor. In 50, Agrippina was granted the honorific title of<space/><link><target>Augusta (honorific)</target><part>Augusta</part></link>, a title which, up until this point, no other imperial woman had ever received in the lifetime of her husband. She was only the third Roman woman (<link><target>Livia</target></link><space/>Drusilla and<space/><link><target>Antonia Minor</target></link><space/>received this title) and only the second living Roman woman (the first being Antonia) to receive this title.</paragraph><paragraph>Also that year, Claudius had founded a Roman colony and called the colony<space/><italics>Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensis</italics><space/>or<space/><italics>Agrippinensium</italics>, today known as<space/><link><target>Cologne</target></link>, after Agrippina who was born there. This colony was the only Roman colony to be named after a Roman woman. In 51, she was given a<space/><italics>carpentum</italics><space/>which she used. A carpentum was a sort of ceremonial carriage usually reserved for priests, such as the<space/><link><target>Vestal Virgin</target><trail>s</trail></link>, and sacred statues.

Tiberius had few descendants and Gemellus was the youngest of all of them. First Tiberius designated the older brothers of Caligula (his adopted son's sons) as his successors. Later he accused and imprisoned them. All he had left was Caligula (by then over 20) and Gemellus (under 10). There would be more approbation for overlooking Caligula in Gemellus' favor.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Nero and Octavia were married on June 9, 53. Claudius later repented of marrying Agrippina and adopting Nero, began to favor Britannicus, and started preparing him for the throne.

In 55, Agrippina was forced out of the palace by her son to live in imperial residence. Nero deprived his mother of all honors and powers, and even removed her Roman and German bodyguards.
