'''European route E&nbsp;4''' passes from north to south through [[Sweden]] from the border with [[Finland]], with a total length of {{convert|1590|km}}. The Finnish part lies entirely within [[Tornio]] in northern Finland, and is actually only {{convert|800|m|mi}} long. The Swedish part, however, traverses most of Sweden except the extreme north and the west coast region, and is commonly considered the highway backbone of Sweden, since it passes in the vicinity of most of its largest cities (exceptions include [[Gothenburg]], [[Karlstad]], [[Västerås]], [[Östersund]] and [[Örebro]]) and through the capital [[Stockholm]]. In particular, it is the mainline road used by most vehicle traffic, both personal cars and freight trailers, between the north ([[Norrland]]) and southern Sweden or beyond.

From [[Haparanda]] on the Finnish border, it stretches south along the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] to [[Gävle]], then on a more inland route southwards. It ends in [[Helsingborg]] in Sweden, at the port for the ferry to [[Elsinore]] in Denmark. Under the new system of [[European route]]s, it was planned to have been a part of [[European route E55|E&nbsp;55]], but it remains in the pre-1992 designation (E&nbsp;4) within Sweden, because{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} the expenses connected with re-signing this long road portion would be too large. Besides the signs along the road, there are thousands of signs, especially in cities, showing how to reach the E&nbsp;4 road. The road is now fully authorized as E&nbsp;4 by the relevant authority, not as E&nbsp;55.

North of Gävle the road is of mixed standard. Depending on the fashion at the time of construction it is either a single standard carriageway road, usually {{convert|8|-|13|m}} wide, or a [[2+1 road]], a {{convert|13|-|14|m}} wide road with two lanes in one direction and one in the other with a steel wire barrier in between, or sometimes a motorway with two lanes in each direction. From Sundsvall and further north, the road passes through most larger cities as city streets. 

South of [[Gävle]], the road becomes an almost continuous motorway. On October 17, 2007, the final stretch of the motorway, between [[Uppsala]] and [[Mehedeby]] was opened. South of Gävle, the speed limit is {{convert|110|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} on 60% and {{convert|120|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} on 30% of the road. North of Gävle there are varying speed limits, with {{convert|90|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|100|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|110|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} as the most common. The speed limits on the main roads in Sweden were changed on many stretches in October 2008, which saw the introduction of the 120&nbsp;km/h limit.<ref>http://www.vv.se/templates/page3wide____24153.aspx</ref>

The E&nbsp;4 is the fastest road to go from Germany/Denmark to areas north of the [[arctic circle]], including places in Norway like [[Tromsø]]. To go from Helsingborg to the [[North Cape, Norway|North Cape]], the fastest road is E&nbsp;4 to [[Luleå]], then [[European route E10|E&nbsp;10]], road 392, road 403, [[European route E08|E&nbsp;08]] and road 93 to [[Alta, Norway|Alta]] and on.
