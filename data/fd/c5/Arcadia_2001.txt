The '''Emerson''' '''Arcadia 2001''' is a second-generation [[8-bit]] console released by [[Emerson Radio|Emerson Radio Corp]] in 1982 following the release of [[ColecoVision]]. It was discontinued only 18 months later, with a total of 35 games having been released.<ref name="Watcher reviews">{{cite web|last=Watcher|first=Dark|title=Emerson Arcadia 2001 - DW Facts|url=http://www.videogameconsolelibrary.com/pg80-arcadia.htm#page=reviews|publisher=Video Game Console Library|accessdate=6 January 2014}}</ref>

Arcadia 2001 is not a product of Arcadia Corporation, manufacturer of the 2600 [[Starpath Supercharger|Supercharger]], and was sued by Emerson for trademark infringement. Arcadia Corporation then changed its name to [[Starpath]].<ref name="starpath">[http://thedoteaters.com/?bitstory=epyx The Dot Eaters - Epyx | The Dot Eaters<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Emerson licensed the Arcadia 2001 to Bandai which released it in Japan,<ref name="Watcher reviews"/> and over 30 Arcadia clones exist. {{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Description==
[[File:Hanimex HMG-2650 Tietokonemuseo.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Hanimex HMG-2650]]
The Arcadia is much smaller than its contemporary competitors and is powered by a standard 12-volt power supply so it can be used in a boat or a vehicle. This portability feature, however, requires a portable television, which was extremely rare in the early 1980s. It also has two outputs (or inputs) headphone jacks on the back of the unit, on the far left and far right sides.

The system came with two [[Intellivision]]-style controllers with a 12 button keypad and 'fire' buttons on the sides. The direction pads have a removable joystick attachment. Most games came with [[BoPET]] overlays that could be applied to the controller's keypads. The console itself had five buttons: power, start, reset, option, and select.

There are at least three different types of cartridge case styles and artwork, with variations on each.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Emerson-family carts come in two different lengths (short and long) of black plastic cases.

Emerson actually created many popular arcade titles including ''[[Pac-Man]]'', ''[[Galaxian]]'' and ''[[Defender (video game)|Defender]]'' for the Arcadia, but never had them manufactured as Atari started to sue its competitors companies for releasing games to which it had exclusive-rights agreements{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}. Early marketing showed popular arcade games, but they were later released as clones. For instance, the Arcadia 2001 game ''Space Raiders'' is a clone of ''Defender'', and ''Breakaway'' is a clone of ''[[Breakout clone|Breakout]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lester|first=John|title=History of Consoles: Arcadia 2001 (1982)|url=http://gamester81.com/history-of-consoles-arcadia-2001-1982/|publisher=Gamster81|accessdate=6 January 2014}}</ref>
