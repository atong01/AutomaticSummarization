The '''Distinguished Service Medal''' (DSM) is a [[Awards and decorations of the United States military|military award]] of the [[United States Army]] that is presented to any person who, while serving in any capacity with the [[United States military]], has distinguished himself or herself by exceptionally meritorious service to the Government in a duty of great responsibility. The performance must be such as to merit recognition for service that is clearly exceptional. Exceptional performance of normal duty will not alone justify an award of this decoration.<ref>[http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Awards/distinguished_srv_medal.aspx Institute of Heraldry Distinguished Service Medal]</ref>

Separate Distinguished Service Medals exist for the different branches of the military as well as a fifth version of the medal which is a senior award of the United States Department of Defense.  The Army version of the Distinguished Service Medal is typically referred to simply as the "Distinguished Service Medal" while the other branches of service use the service name as a prefix.

For service not related to actual war, the term "duty of a great responsibility" applies to a narrower range of positions than in time of war, and requires evidence of conspicuously significant achievement. However, justification of the award may accrue by virtue of exceptionally meritorious service in a succession of high positions of great importance.

Awards may be made to persons other than members of the [[United States military|Armed Forces of the United States]] for wartime services only, and then only under exceptional circumstances, with the express approval of the President in each case.

==Description==

*On the reverse is a scroll for the name of the recipient (which is to be engraved) upon a trophy of flags and weapons. The medal is suspended by a bar attached to the ribbon.

==History of the Distinguished Service Medal==
The Distinguished Service Medal was authorized by Presidential Order dated 01-02-1918, and confirmed by Congress on 07-09-1918. It was announced by War Department General Order No. 6, 1918-01-12, with the following information concerning the medal: "A bronze medal of appropriate design and a ribbon to be worn in lieu thereof, to be awarded by the President to any person who, while serving in any capacity with the Army shall hereafter distinguish himself or herself, or who, since 04-06-1917, has distinguished himself or herself by exceptionally meritorious service to the Government in a duty of great responsibility in time of war or in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United States." The Act of Congress on 07-09-1918, recognized the need for different types and degrees of heroism and meritorious service and included such provisions for award criteria. The current statutory authorization for the Distinguished Service Medal is Title 10, [[United States Code]], Section 3743.

==Recipients==
{{see also|Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Service Medal (United States)}}
*Among the first awards of the Distinguished Service Medal for service in World War I, were those to the Commanding Officers of the Allied Armies:
#Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]]
#Marshal [[Joseph Joffre]],
#General [[Philippe Petain]] of France,
#General [[Louis Franchet d'Espèrey]] of France,
#General Sir [[Arthur Currie]] of Canada,

More than 2,000 awards were made during World War I, and by the time the United States entered World War II, approximately 2,800 awards had been made.  From July 1, 1941 to June 6, 1969, when the Army stopped publishing awards of the DSM in Department of the Army General Orders, over 2,800 further awards were made.<ref>George H. Apgar (1995), ''Awards of the US Army Distinguished Service Medal 1942-1969'', Planchet Press</ref>

Until the first award of the [[Air Force Distinguished Service Medal]] in 1965, [[United States Air Force]] personnel received this award as well, as was the case with several other Army decorations until the Air Force fully established its own system of decorations.

===Notable recipients===
Because the Army Distinguished Service Medal is principally awarded to general officers, a list of notable recipients would include nearly every general and admiral since 1918, many of whom received multiple awards, as well as a few civilians and sergeants major prominent for their contributions to national defense.  

Generals of the Army Douglas MacArthur and Dwight Eisenhower are tied for the record of the greatest number of awards received of the Army Distinguished Service Medal at five each.  They also each received one award of the Navy Distinguished Service Medal.  

Among notable recipients below flag rank are: X-1 test pilot [[Chuck Yeager]] and X-15 test pilot [[Robert M. White]], who both received the DSM as U.S. Air Force majors; Air Force Major [[Rudolf Anderson]], the [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] pilot shot down during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]; director [[Frank Capra]], decorated in 1945 as an Army colonel; actor [[James Stewart]], decorated in 1945 as an Army Air Forces colonel (later Air Force Brigadier General); Col. [[Wendell Fertig]], who led Filipino guerrillas behind Japanese lines; Col. (later Major General) [[John K. Singlaub]], who led partisan forces in the Korean War; and Maj. Maude C. Davison, who led the "[[Angels of Bataan]] and Corregidor" during their imprisonment by the Japanese, and Colonel William S. Taylor, Program Manager Multiple Launch Rocket System.
