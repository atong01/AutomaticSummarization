A '''biennial plant''' is a flowering plant that takes two years to complete its biological lifecycle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/wildseed/growing/annual.html|title=Annual, Perennial, Biennial?|work=Texas Cooperative Extension|accessdate=31 August 2012}}</ref> <ref>http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/biennial</ref>In the first year the plant grows leaves, stems, and roots (vegetative structures), then it enters a period of dormancy over the colder months. Usually the stem remains very short and the leaves are low to the ground, forming a rosette.  Many biennials require a cold treatment, or [[vernalization]], before they will flower. During the next [[spring (season)|spring]] or [[summer (season)|summer]], the stem of the biennial plant elongates greatly, or "bolts". This typically makes biennial vegetables such as [[spinach]], [[fennel]] and [[lettuce]] unusable as food.<ref name=RHSbolting>{{cite web |title=Bolting in vegetables |url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?pid=262 |publisher=Royal Horticultural Society |accessdate=21 June 2015}}</ref>  The plant then flowers, producing [[fruit]]s and [[seed]]s before it finally dies. There are far fewer biennials than either [[perennial plant]]s or [[annual plant]]s.

Under extreme climatic conditions, a biennial plant may complete its life cycle rapidly (e.g. three months instead of two years). This is quite common in vegetable or flower seedlings that were exposed to cold conditions, or vernalized, before they were planted in the ground. This behavior leads to many normally biennial plants being treated as [[annual plant|annuals]] in some areas.  

[[Image:Spring Flowers.JPG|thumb|The Sweet William Dwarf plant is a biennial plant]]From a gardener's perspective, a plant's status as [[annual plant|annual]], biennial, or [[perennial plant|perennial]] often varies based on location or purpose. Biennials grown for flowers, fruits, or seeds need to be grown for two years. Biennials that are grown for edible leaves or roots are grown for just one year (and not grown on a second year to run to seed).

Examples of biennial plants are members of the [[onion]] family including [[leek]],<ref name=RHSbolting/> some members of the [[cabbage]] family,<ref name=RHSbolting/> [[Verbascum thapsus|common mullein]], [[parsley]], fennel,<ref name=RHSbolting/> ''[[Lunaria]]'', [[silverbeet]], [[Rudbeckia hirta|Black-eyed Susan]], [[Sweet William]], [[Aletris|colic weed]], [[carrot]],<ref name=RHSbolting/> and  some [[hollyhock]]s.  Plant breeders have produced annual cultivars of several biennials that will flower the first year from seed, e.g. [[foxglove]] and [[Matthiola incana|stock]].
