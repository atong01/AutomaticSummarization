Denmark is a net exporter of food. The center-left coalition government (19932001) concentrated on reducing the unemployment rate and turning the budget deficit into a surplus, as well as following the previous government's policies of maintaining low inflation and a current account surplus. The coalition also committed itself to maintaining a stable currency. The coalition lowered marginal income tax rates while maintaining overall tax revenues; boosted industrial competitiveness through labor market and tax reforms, increased research and development funds. The availability and duration of unemployment benefit has been restricted to four years and because of rapidly rising prices on housing this has led to an increase in poverty from below 4% in 1995 to 5% in 2006 according to the Danish Economic Council<space/><link type='external' href='http://politiken.dk/debat/article215345.ece'></link>. Despite these cuts, the part of the public sector in Denmark which buys goods and services from the private sector and provides the public sector administration and direct service to the public - nursing institutions for the young or old, hospitals, schools, police, and so on. - has risen from 25.5% of GDP during the former government to 26% today and is projected to be at 26.5% in 2015 if current policies continue<space/><link type='external' href='http://nyhederne-dyn.tv2.dk/article.php/id-8042192.html'></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Denmark chose not to join the 11 other European Union members who launched the<space/><link><target>euro</target></link><space/>on 1 January 1999. Especially from 2006, economists and political pundits have expressed concern that the lack of skilled labour will result in higher pay increases and an overheating of the economy, which would repeat the boom-and-bust cycle in 1986, when government introduced a tax reform and restricted the private loan market because of a record balance-of-payments deficit. As a consequence, the trade balance showed a surplus in 1987, and the balance-of-payments in 1990 (first surplus since 1963). They have remained in surplus since, except for the balance of payments in 1998.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Welfare state</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Welfare state</arg></template><link><target>File:Labour productivity levels in europe.svg</target><part>thumb</part><part>250px</part><part>The<space/><link><target>Workforce productivity</target><part>labour productivity</part></link><space/>level of Denmark is one of highest in<space/><link><target>Europe</target></link>.<space/><link><target>OECD</target></link>, 2012</part></link>Denmark has a broad-reaching welfare system, which ensures that all Danes receive tax-funded health care.

Denmark has a countrywide, but municipal administered social support system against poverty, securing that qualified citizens has a minimum income of living. All Danish citizens above 18 years of age can apply for some financial support, if they cannot sustain themselves or their family. Approval is by no means automatic and the extent of this system has generally been diminished over the last 30 years. After a newly implemented reform by 5. January 2015, sick people can receive some financial support throughout the extent of their illness and not just for the maximum of 1 year as previously.

Within animal husbandry, it includes dairy and beef cattle, pigs, poultry and fur animals primarily mink, all sectors with a major export. Regarding vegetable production, Denmark is a leading producer of grass-, clover- and horticultural seeds.</paragraph><paragraph>The Danish agricultural industry is characterized by freehold and family ownership but due to structural development farms have become fewer and larger. With modern trade patterns the profitability increasingly depends on global market trends. The arable land in Denmark is approximately 2,646,000 hectares, and the number of farms approximately 40,000, out of which approximately one third is owned by full-time farmers.</paragraph><paragraph>The agriculture is intensive with 64 per cent of the land area being used for production. This equals production of food for 15 million people. The value of Danish agricultural export, including the agribusiness sector, has risen steadily in recent years and accounted for 16 billion Euros in 2011. The agriculture and food sector as a whole represents 20 per cent of total Danish commodity exports.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Animal production</heading><paragraph>The tendency towards fewer and larger farms has been accompanied by an increased animal production, using fewer resources per produced unit.</paragraph><paragraph>The number of dairy farmers has reduced to about 3,800 with an average herd size of 150 cows. The milk quota is 1,142 tonnes. Danish dairy farmers are among the largest and most modern producers in Europe. More than half of the cows live in new loose-housing systems. Export of dairy products accounts for more than 20 per cent of the total Danish agricultural export. The total number of cattle in 2011 was approximately 1.5 million. Of these, 565,000 were dairy cows and 99,000 were suckler cows. The yearly number of slaughtering of beef cattle is around 550,000.</paragraph><paragraph>For more than 100 years the production of pigs and pig meat has been a major source of income in Denmark. The Danish pig industry is among the worlds leaders in areas such as breeding, quality, food safety, animal welfare and traceability creating the basis for Denmark being among the worlds largest pig meat exporters. Approximately 90 per cent of the production is exported. This accounts for almost half of all agricultural exports and for more than 5 per cent of Denmarks total exports. About 4,200 farmers produce 28 million pigs annually. Of these, 20.9 million are slaughtered in Denmark.</paragraph><paragraph>Fur animal production started in the 1930s in Denmark. Denmark is the worlds second largest producer of mink skin. In 2012, 1525 farmers produced 15.6 million mink skin of the highest quality. Approximately 98 per cent of the skins sold at Kopenhagen Fur Auction are exported. Fur ranks as Danish agricultures third largest export article. Special attention is given to the welfare of the mink, and regular Open Farm arrangements are made for the general public.<template><target>cn</target><arg name="reason">refs are needed in general.

Chickens for slaughter are often produced in units with 40,000 broilers. In 2012, 100 million chickens were slaughtered. In the minor productions of poultry, 13 million ducks, 1.4 million geese and 5.0 million turkeys were slaughtered in 2012.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Organic production</heading><paragraph>Organic farming and production has increased dramatically in Denmark in the last 25 years and continues to expand with more than a quadrupling of exports since 2006. In 2012 the export of organic products reached DK 1.2 billion, a 12.3 % increase from 2011. This figure should be seen in the context of a DK 360 billion global market for organic products and a total export from the Danish food and agriculture sector at DK 148 billion that same year. The import of organic products has always been higher than the exports though and reached DK 1.5 billion in 2012. 7 % of the cultivated land is now categorized as organically farmed and 10 % for the dairy industry as of 2008.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://en.fvm.dk/fileadmin/user_upload/ENGLISH_FVM.DK/Themes/Organic_production/Organic_consumption_and_production_in_Denmark.pdf</arg><arg name="title">Organic consumption and production

A tight fiscal policy by the Greenland Home Rule Government since the late 1980s helped create a low inflation rate and surpluses in the public budget, but at the cost of rising foreign debt in the Home Rule Government's commercial entities. Since 1990, Greenland has registered a foreign trade deficit.</paragraph><paragraph>Following the closure of Greenland's last lead and zinc mine in 1989, Greenland's economy is solely dependent on the fishing and tourism and financial transfers from the Danish central government. Despite resumption of several interesting hydrocarbon and<space/><link><target>mineral</target></link><space/>exploration activities, it will take several years before production will begin. Greenland's shrimp fishery is by far the largest source of income, since cod catches have dropped to historically low levels. Greenland also has a prominent whaling industry, Greenlandic Inuit whalers catch around 175 whales per year, making them the third largest hunt in the world after Japan and Norway, though their take is small compared to those nations, who annually averaged around 730 and 590 whales respectively in 19982007. The IWC treats the west and east coasts of Greenland as two separate population areas and sets separate quotas for each coast. The far more densely populated west coast accounts for over 90 percent of the catch. In a typical year around 150 minke and 10 fin whales are taken from west coast waters and around 10 minkes are from east coast waters. Since the fishing industry is in decline including whaling, tourism is the only sector offering any near-term potential, and even this is limited due to the short season and high costs. The public sector plays a dominant role in Greenland's economy. Grants from mainland Denmark and EU fisheries payments make up about one-half of the home-rule government's revenues. Recently, Greenland has seen interest from other countries due to the possibilities of large amounts of natural resources, which include: coal, iron ore, lead, zinc, molybdenum, diamonds, gold, platinum, niobium, tantalite, uranium, fish, seals, whales, hydropower, possible oil and gas.</paragraph><paragraph>The Faroe Islands also depend almost entirely on fisheries, salmon farming, tourism and related exports. Without Danish Government bailouts in 1992 and 1993, the Faroese economy would have gone bankrupt. Since 1995, the Faroese economy has seen a noticeable upturn, but remains extremely vulnerable. Recent off-shore oil finds close to the Faroese area give hope for Faroese deposits, too, which may form the basis for an economic rebound over the longer term. Like Greenland, the Faroe Islands are also known for its<space/><link><target>Whaling in the Faroe Islands</target><part>whale hunting</part></link>, around 950<space/><link><target>long-finned pilot whale</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>(Globicephala melaena) are caught each year, mainly during the summer. This should be seen in the context of an estimated local pilot whale population of more than 100,000. Other species are not hunted, though occasionally Atlantic white-sided dolphin can be found among the pilot whales. The Faroese whale slaughter has recently been under attack by the media because of the way it is generally perceived. The whale hunting is not a commercial industry, of no significance to the economy other than the fact that the Faroes need to import less meat from other animals because people get meat for free from the pilot whales, and the whales are for local consumption only.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.whaling.fo</arg><arg name="title">Whales and Whaling in the Faroe Islands</arg><arg name="website">whaling.fo</arg><arg name="publisher">Whales and Whaling in the Faroe Islands</arg><arg name="accessdate">23 September 2015</arg></template></extension><space/></paragraph><paragraph>Neither Greenland, nor the Faroe Islands are members of the European Union.
