The discovery of exoplanets has intensified interest in the search for [[extraterrestrial life]]. There is special interest in planets that orbit in a star's [[habitable zone]], where it is possible for liquid water (and therefore [[life]]) to exist on the surface.

==Definition==

===IAU===
The official [[Definition of planet|definition of "planet"]] used by the [[International Astronomical Union|International Astronomical Union (IAU)]] only covers the [[Solar System]] and thus does not apply to exoplanets.<ref>{{cite web

That definition contains the following criteria:

{{quote|
* Objects with [[true mass]]es below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium (currently calculated to be 13 Jupiter masses for objects of solar metallicity) that orbit stars or stellar remnants are "planets" (no matter how they formed). The minimum mass/size required for an extrasolar object to be considered a planet should be the same as that used in the Solar System.
* Substellar objects with true masses above the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are "[[brown dwarfs]]", no matter how they formed or where they are located.
* Free-floating objects in young star clusters with masses below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are not "planets", but are "sub-brown dwarfs" (or whatever name is most appropriate).
}}

===Alternatives===
However, the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]]'s working definition is not universally accepted. One alternate suggestion is that planets should be distinguished from [[brown dwarf]]s on the basis of formation. It is widely believed that giant planets form through core accretion, and that process may sometimes produce planets with masses above the deuterium fusion threshold;<ref>{{cite arXiv|eprint=0710.5667v1|class=astro-ph|title=Giant Planet Formation by Core Accretion|version=|author=Mordasini, C. et al.|date=2007|last2=Alibert|last3=Benz|last4=Naef}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|arxiv=0802.1810|title=Structure and evolution of super-Earth to super-Jupiter exoplanets.

Another suggestion, based on mass-density relationships, is that the dividing line should be at 60 Jupiter masses.<ref>[http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05097 A Definition for Giant Planets Based on the Mass-Density Relationship], Artie P. Hatzes, Heike Rauer, (Submitted on 16 Jun 2015) </ref>

==History of detection==
For centuries philosophers and scientists supposed that extrasolar planets existed, but there was no way of detecting them or of knowing their frequency or how similar they might be to the planets of the [[Solar System]]. Various detection claims made in the nineteenth century were rejected by astronomers. The first confirmed detection came in 1992, with the discovery of several terrestrial-mass planets orbiting the [[pulsar]] [[PSR B1257+12]].<ref name="Wolszczan" /> The first confirmation of an exoplanet orbiting a [[main-sequence]] star was made in 1995, when a giant planet was found in a four-day orbit around the nearby star [[51 Pegasi]]. Some exoplanets have been [[Direct imaging|imaged directly]] by telescopes, but the vast majority have been detected through indirect methods such as the [[transit method]] and the [[Doppler spectroscopy|radial-velocity method]].

===Early speculations===
{{quote box|align=right|width=30em|This space we declare to be infinite... In it are an infinity of worlds of the same kind as our own.|Giordano Bruno (1584)<ref>Bruno, Giordano (1584). ''On the Infinite Universe and Worlds''.</ref>}}

In the sixteenth century the Italian philosopher [[Giordano Bruno]], an early supporter of the [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] theory that Earth and other planets orbit the Sun ([[heliocentrism]]), put forward the view that the fixed stars are similar to the Sun and are likewise accompanied by planets.

In the eighteenth century the same possibility was mentioned by [[Isaac Newton]] in the "[[General Scholium]]" that concludes his ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]''. Making a comparison to the Sun's planets, he wrote "And if the fixed stars are the centers of similar systems, they will all be constructed according to a similar design and subject to the dominion of ''One''."<ref>{{Cite book |last = Newton|first = Isaac|author2 = I.

In 1952, more than 40 years before the first [[hot Jupiter]] was discovered, [[Otto Struve]] wrote that there is no compelling reason why planets could not be much closer to their parent star than is the case in the Solar System, and proposed that [[Doppler spectroscopy]] and the [[transit method]] could detect [[super-Jupiter]]s in short orbits.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://astro.berkeley.edu/~gmarcy/struve.html|title= Proposal for a project of high-precision stellar radial velocity work|author=Struve, Otto |journal= The Observatory|volume=72|pages=199–200 |year=1952|bibcode = 1952Obs....72..199S }}</ref>

Claims of exoplanet detections have been made since the nineteenth century. Some of the earliest involve the [[binary star]] [[70 Ophiuchi|70&nbsp;Ophiuchi]]. In 1855 Capt. W. S. Jacob at the [[British East India Company|East India Company]]'s [[Madras Observatory]] reported that orbital anomalies made it "highly probable" that there was a "planetary body" in this system.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Jacob, W.

On 9 January 1992, radio astronomers [[Aleksander Wolszczan]] and [[Dale Frail]] announced the discovery of two planets orbiting the [[pulsar]] [[PSR B1257+12|PSR 1257+12]].<ref name="Wolszczan">{{Cite journal | last1 = Wolszczan | first1 = A. |bibcode=1992Natur.355..145W| last2 = Frail | first2 = D.

On 6 October 1995, [[Michel Mayor]] and [[Didier Queloz]] of the [[University of Geneva]] announced the first definitive detection of [[51 Pegasi b|an exoplanet]] orbiting a [[main sequence|main-sequence]] star, namely the nearby G-type star [[51 Pegasi]].<ref name="Mayor">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/378355a0| title = A Jupiter-mass companion to a solar-type star| journal = Nature| volume = 378| issue = 6555| pages = 355–359| year = 1995| last1 = Mayor | first1 = M. | last2 = Queloz | first2 = D. | bibcode = 1995Natur.378..355M}}</ref><ref name=gibn>{{cite journal|last1=Gibney|first1=Elizabeth|title=In search of sister earths|journal=Nature|date=19/26 December 2013|volume=504|page=361|doi=10.1038/504357a|url=http://www.nature.com/news/365-days-nature-s-10-1.14367|bibcode = 2013Natur.504..357. }}</ref> This discovery, made at the [[Observatoire de Haute-Provence]], ushered in the modern era of exoplanetary discovery. Technological advances, most notably in high-resolution [[spectroscopy]], led to the rapid detection of many new exoplanets: astronomers could detect exoplanets indirectly by measuring their [[gravity|gravitational]] influence on the motion of their host stars. More extrasolar planets were later detected by observing the variation in a star's apparent luminosity as an orbiting planet passed in front of it.

Initially, most known exoplanets were massive planets that orbited very close to their parent stars. Astronomers were surprised by these "[[hot Jupiter]]s", because theories of [[Nebular hypothesis#Formation of planets|planetary formation]] had indicated that giant planets should only form at large distances from stars. But eventually more planets of other sorts were found, and it is now clear that hot Jupiters are a minority of exoplanets.

==Detection methods==
{{Main|Methods of detecting extrasolar planets}}

===Direct imaging===
{{main|Direct imaging}}
[[File:Beta Pictoris.jpg|thumb|Directly imaged planet, [[Beta Pictoris b]]]]
Planets are extremely faint compared to their parent stars. At visible wavelengths, they usually have less than a millionth of their host star's brightness. It is difficult to detect such a faint light source, and furthermore the parent star causes a glare that tends to wash it out. It is necessary to block the light from the parent star in order to reduce the glare while leaving the light from the planet detectable; doing so is a major technical challenge.<ref name="Perryman_book11">{{Cite book|last = Perryman|first = Michael|title = The Exoplanet Handbook|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 2011|page = 149|isbn = 978-0-521-76559-6}}</ref>

All exoplanets that have been directly imaged are both large (more massive than [[Jupiter]]) and widely separated from their parent star. Most of them are also very hot, so that they emit intense [[infrared|infrared radiation]]; the images have then been made at infrared where the planet is brighter than it is at visible wavelengths. During the gas-accretion phase of [[Nebular hypothesis#Giant planets|giant-planet formation]] the star–planet contrast may be even better in [[H alpha]] than it is in infrared—an H alpha survey is currently underway.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/781/2/L30|arxiv=1401.1273| title = Discovery of Hα Emission from the Close Companion Inside the Gap of Transitional Disk HD142527| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 781| issue = 2| pages = L30| year = 2014| last1 = Close | first1 = L.

Specially designed direct-imaging instruments such as [[Gemini Planet Imager]], [[VLT-SPHERE]], and [[Subaru Telescope#Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics system|SCExAO]] will image dozens of gas giants, however the vast majority of known extrasolar planets have only been detected through indirect methods. The following are the indirect methods that have proven useful:

=== Indirect methods ===
* [[Transit method]]
:[[File:Dopspec-inline.gif|thumb|When the star is behind a planet, its brightness will seem to dim]]If a planet crosses (or [[Astronomical transit|transits]]) in front of its parent star's disk, then the observed brightness of the star drops by a small amount. The amount by which the star dims depends on its size and on the size of the planet, among other factors. This method suffers from a substantial rate of false positives and confirmation from another method is usually considered necessary. The transit method reveals the radius of a planet, and it has the benefit that it sometimes allows a planet's atmosphere to be investigated through [[spectroscopy]]. Because the transit method requires that part of the planet's orbit intersect a line-of-sight between the host star and Earth, the probability that an exoplanet in a randomly oriented orbit will be observed to transit the star is somewhat small. The [[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler telescope]] uses this method.

* [[Doppler spectroscopy|Radial velocity or Doppler method]]
:As a planet orbits a star, the star also moves in its own small orbit around the system's center of mass. Variations in the star's radial velocity—that is, the speed with which it moves towards or away from Earth—can be detected from displacements in the star's [[spectral line]]s due to the [[Doppler effect]]. Extremely small radial-velocity variations can be observed, of 1 m/s or even somewhat less.<ref name="Pepe_HarpsEarthlike11">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361/201117055| title = The HARPS search for Earth-like planets in the habitable zone| journal = Astronomy & Astrophysics| volume = 534| pages = A58| year = 2011| last1 = Pepe | first1 = F.| last2 = Lovis | first2 = C.| last3 = Ségransan | first3 = D.| last4 = Benz | first4 = W.| last5 = Bouchy | first5 = F.| last6 = Dumusque | first6 = X.| last7 = Mayor | first7 = M.| last8 = Queloz | first8 = D.| last9 = Santos | first9 = N.

* [[Transit timing variation]] (TTV)
:When multiple planets are present, each one slightly perturbs the others' orbits. Small variations in the times of transit for one planet can thus indicate the presence of another planet, which itself may or may not transit.

* [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Gravitational microlensing|Gravitational microlensing]]
:Microlensing occurs when the gravitational field of a star acts like a lens, magnifying the light of a distant background star. Planets orbiting the lensing star can cause detectable anomalies in the magnification as it varies over time. Unlike most other methods which have detection bias towards planets with small (or for resolved imaging, large) orbits, microlensing method is most sensitive to detecting planets around 1–10&nbsp;[[astronomical unit|AU]] away from Sun-like stars.
* [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Astrometry|Astrometry]]
:Astrometry consists of precisely measuring a star's position in the sky and observing the changes in that position over time. The motion of a star due to the gravitational influence of a planet may be observable. Because the motion is so small, however, this method has not yet been very productive. It has produced only a few disputed detections, though it has been successfully used to investigate the properties of planets found in other ways.
* [[Pulsar timing]]
:A [[pulsar]] (the small, ultradense remnant of a star that has exploded as a [[supernova]]) emits radio waves extremely regularly as it rotates. If planets orbit the pulsar, they will cause slight anomalies in the timing of its observed radio pulses. [[PSR B1257+12|The first confirmed discovery of an extrasolar planet]] was made using this method. But as of 2011, it has not been very productive; five planets have been detected in this way, around three different pulsars.

==Nomenclature==

===Proper names===
Most exoplanets have catalog names which are explained in the following sections, but in July 2014 the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] launched a process for giving proper names to exoplanets.<ref>[http://www.iau.org/news/pressreleases/detail/iau1404/ NameExoWorlds: An IAU Worldwide Contest to Name Exoplanets and their Host Stars]. IAU.org. 9 July 2014</ref><ref>[http://nameexoworlds.iau.org/ NameExoWorlds].</ref> The process involves public nomination and voting for the new names, and the IAU plans to announce new names for 32 planets in 20 systems in mid-November 2015.<ref>[http://nameexoworlds.iau.org/process NameExoWorlds].</ref> The decision to give the planets new names followed the private company [[Uwingu]]'s exoplanet naming contest, which the IAU harshly criticized.<ref name=JStromberg>{{cite news|last1=Stromberg|first1=Joseph|title=We've found hundreds of new planets. And now they're going to get cool names|url=http://www.vox.com/2014/7/10/5887453/weve-found-hundreds-of-new-planets-and-now-theyre-going-to-get-cool|accessdate=10 July 2014|publisher=Vox|date=10 July 2014}}</ref> Previously a few planets had received unofficial names: notably Osiris ([[HD 209458 b]]), Bellerophon ([[51 Pegasi b]]), and Methuselah ([[PSR B1620-26 b]]).

===Multiple-star standard===
The convention for naming exoplanets is an extension of the one used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple-[[star system]]s, and adopted by the [[IAU|International Astronomical Union]].<ref name="planetnaming">{{cite arXiv |title=On the naming convention used for multiple star systems and extrasolar planets |date=2010 |eprint=1012.0707 |class=astro-ph.SR |last1= Hessman |first1=F.

The brightest member of a star system receives the letter "A". Distinct components not contained within "A" are labeled "B", "C", etc. Subcomponents are designated by one or more suffixes with the primary label, starting with lowercase letters for the 2nd hierarchical level and then numbers for the 3rd.<ref name=WMC>{{cite web | url=http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/wmc/wmc_post191.html | title=Addressing confusion in double star nomenclature: The Washington Multiplicity Catalog | author=Hartkopf, William I. and Mason, Brian D. | publisher=United States Naval Observatory | accessdate=12 September 2008 }}</ref> For example, if there is a triple star system in which two stars orbit each other closely with a third star in a more distant orbit, the two closely orbiting stars would be named Aa and Ab, whereas the distant star would named B. For historical reasons, this standard is not always followed: for example [[Alpha Centauri]] A, B and C are ''not'' labelled Alpha Centauri Aa, Ab and B.

===Extrasolar planet standard===
Following an extension of the above standard, an exoplanet's name is normally formed by taking the name of its parent star and adding a lowercase letter. The first planet discovered in a system is given the designation "b" and later planets are given subsequent letters. If several planets in the same system are discovered at the same time, the closest one to the star gets the next letter, followed by the other planets in order of orbital size.

For instance, in the [[55 Cancri]] system the first planet&nbsp;– [[55 Cancri b]]&nbsp;– was discovered in 1996; two additional farther planets were simultaneously discovered in 2002 with the nearest to the star being named [[55 Cancri c]] and the other [[55 Cancri d]]; a fourth planet was claimed (its existence was later disputed) in 2004 and named [[55 Cancri e]] despite lying closer to the star than 55 Cancri b; and the most recently discovered planet, in 2007, was named [[55 Cancri f]] despite lying between 55 Cancri c and 55 Cancri d.<ref name=EPE55Can>{{cite web |url=http://exoplanet.eu/star.php?st=55+Cnc |title=Notes for star 55 Cnc |author=Schneider, J. |date=2011 |publisher=[[Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia]] |accessdate=26 September 2011}}</ref> As of April 2012 the highest letter in use is "j", for the unconfirmed planet [[HD 10180|HD 10180 j]], and with "h" being the highest letter for a confirmed planet, belonging to the same host star).<ref name="Encyclopaedia" />

If a planet orbits one member of a [[binary star]] system, then an uppercase letter for the star will be followed by a lowercase letter for the planet. Examples are [[16 Cygni Bb]]<ref name=EPE16CygBb>{{cite web |url=http://exoplanet.eu/planet.php?p1=HD+41004+A&p2=b |title=Notes for Planet 16 Cyg B b |author=Schneider, J. |date=2011 |publisher=[[Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia]] |accessdate=26 September 2011}}</ref> and [[HD 178911 Bb]].<ref name=EPEHD178911Bb>{{cite web |url=http://exoplanet.eu/planet.php?p1=HD+178911+B&p2=b |title=Notes for Planet HD 178911 B b |author=Schneider, J. |date=2011 |publisher=[[Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia]] |accessdate=26 September 2011}}</ref> Planets orbiting the primary or "A" star should have 'Ab' after the name of the system, as in [[HD 41004 Ab]].<ref name=EPEHD41004Ab>{{cite web |url=http://exoplanet.eu/planet.php?p1=HD+41004+A&p2=b |title=Notes for Planet HD 41004 A b |author=Schneider, J. |date=2011 |publisher=[[Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia]] |accessdate=26 September 2011}}</ref> However, the "A" is sometimes omitted; for example the first planet discovered around the primary star of the [[Tau Boötis]] binary system is usually called simply [[Tau Boötis b]].<ref name=EPEHDTauBoob>{{cite web |url=http://exoplanet.eu/planet.php?p1=tau+Boo&p2=b |title=Notes for Planet Tau Boo b |author=Schneider, J. |date=2011 |publisher=[[Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia]] |accessdate=26 September 2011}}</ref> The star designation is necessary when more than one star in the system has its own planetary system such as in case of WASP-94 A and WASP-94 B.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361/201424744| title = WASP-94 a and B planets: Hot-Jupiter cousins in a twin-star system| journal = Astronomy & Astrophysics| volume = 572| pages = A49| year = 2014| last1 = Neveu-Vanmalle | first1 = M.| last2 = Queloz | first2 = D.| last3 = Anderson | first3 = D.

If the parent star is a single star, then it may still be regarded as having an "A" designation, though the "A" is not normally written. The first exoplanet found to be orbiting such a star could then be regarded as a secondary subcomponent that should be given the suffix "Ab". For example, 51 Peg Aa is the host star in the system [[51 Pegasi|51 Peg]]; and the first exoplanet is then 51 Peg Ab. Because most exoplanets are in single-star systems, the implicit "A" designation was simply dropped, leaving the exoplanet name with the lower-case letter only: [[51 Pegasi b|51 Peg b]].

A few exoplanets have been given names that do not conform to the above standard. For example, the planets that orbit the pulsar PSR 1257 are often referred to with capital rather than lowercase letters. Also, the underlying name of the star system itself can follow several different systems. In fact, some stars (such as [[Kepler-11]]) have only received their names due to their inclusion in planet-search programs, previously only being referred to by their [[celestial coordinates]].

===Circumbinary planets and 2010 proposal===
Hessman et al. state that the implicit system for exoplanet names utterly failed with the discovery of [[circumbinary planet]]s.<ref name="planetnaming"/> They note that the discoverers of the two planets around [[HW Virginis]] tried to circumvent the naming problem by calling them "HW Vir 3" and "HW Vir 4", i.e. the latter is the 4th object&nbsp;– stellar or planetary&nbsp;– discovered in the system. They also note that the discoverers of the two planets around [[NN Serpentis]] were confronted with multiple suggestions from various official sources and finally chose to use the designations "NN Ser c" and "NN Ser d".

The proposal of Hessman et al. starts with the following two rules:
:'''Rule 1'''. The formal name of an exoplanet is obtained by appending the appropriate suffixes to the formal name of the host star or stellar system. The upper hierarchy is defined by upper-case letters, followed by lower-case letters, followed by numbers, etc. The naming order within a hierarchical level is for the order of discovery only. (This rule corresponds to the present provisional WMC naming convention.)
:'''Rule 2'''. Whenever the leading capital letter designation is missing, this is interpreted as being an informal form with an implicit "A" unless otherwise explicitly stated. (This rule corresponds to the present exoplanet community usage for planets around single stars.)
They note that under these two proposed rules all of the present names for 99% of the planets around single stars are preserved as informal forms of the IAU sanctioned provisional standard. They would rename Tau Boötis b formally as Tau Boötis Ab, retaining the prior form as an informal usage (using Rule 2, above).

To deal with the difficulties relating to circumbinary planets, the proposal contains two further rules:
:'''Rule 3.''' As an alternative to the nomenclature standard in Rule 1, a hierarchical relationship can be expressed by concatenating the names of the higher order system and placing them in [[bracket|parentheses]], after which the suffix for a lower order system is added.
:'''Rule 4'''. When in doubt (i.e. if a different name has not been clearly set in the literature), the hierarchy expressed by the nomenclature should correspond to dynamically distinct (sub)systems in order of their dynamical relevance. The choice of hierarchical levels should be made to emphasize dynamical relationships, if known.

They submit that the new form using parentheses is the best for known circumbinary planets and has the desirable effect of giving these planets identical sublevel hierarchical labels and stellar component names that conform to the usage for binary stars. They say that it requires the complete renaming of only two exoplanetary systems: The planets around HW Virginis would be renamed HW Vir (AB) b & (AB) c, whereas those around NN Serpentis would be renamed NN Ser (AB) b & (AB) c. In addition the previously known single circumbinary planets around [[PSR B1620-26]] and [[DP Leonis]]) can almost retain their names ([[PSR B1620-26 b]] and [[DP Leonis b]]) as unofficial informal forms of the "(AB)b" designation where the "(AB)" is left out.

The discoverers of the circumbinary planet around [[Kepler-16]] followed the naming scheme proposed by Hessman et al. when naming the body Kepler-16 (AB)-b, or simply [[Kepler-16b]] when there is no ambiguity.<ref name=Doyle>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1210923| pmid = 21921192| title = Kepler-16: A Transiting Circumbinary Planet| journal = Science| volume = 333| issue = 6049| pages = 1602–6| year = 2011| last1 = Doyle | first1 = L.

===Other naming systems===
Another nomenclature, often seen in science fiction, uses [[Roman numerals]] in the order of planets' positions from the star. (This was inspired by an old system for naming moons of the outer planets, such as "Jupiter IV" for [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]].) But such a system is impractical for scientific use, because new planets may be found closer to the star, changing all numerals.

For example, out of the six independent [[orbital element|parameters]] that define an orbit, the radial-velocity method can determine four: [[semi-major axis]], [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]], [[longitude of periastron]], and time of periastron. Two parameters remain unknown: [[inclination]] and [[longitude of the ascending node]].

There are exoplanets that are much closer to their parent star than any planet in the Solar System is to the Sun, and there are also exoplanets that are much further from their star. [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], the closest planet to the Sun at 0.4&nbsp;[[astronomical unit]]s (AU), takes 88 days for an orbit, but the smallest known orbits of exoplanets have orbital periods of only a few hours, e.g. [[Kepler-70b]]. The [[Kepler-11]] system has five of its planets in smaller orbits than Mercury's. [[Neptune]] is 30&nbsp;AU from the Sun and takes 165 years to orbit it, but there are exoplanets that are thousands of AU from their star and take tens of thousands of years to orbit, e.g. [[GU Piscium b]].<ref>[http://www.nouvelles.umontreal.ca/udem-news/news/20140513-enlightening-pisces-star-signs-lead-scientists-to-discovery.html Odd planet, so far from its star...] Université de Montréal. 13 May 2014</ref>

The orbit of a planet is not centered on the star but on their common [[center of mass]] (see diagram on right). For circular orbits, the [[semi-major axis]] is the distance between the planet and the center of mass of the system. For elliptical orbits, the planet–star distance varies over the course of the orbit, in which case the semi-major axis is the average of the [[apastron|largest]] and [[periastron|smallest distances]] between the planet and the center of mass of the system. If the sizes of the star and planet are relatively small compared to the size of the orbit and the orbit is nearly circular and the center of mass is not too far from the star's center, such as in the Earth–Sun system, then the distance from any point on the star to any point on the planet is approximately the same as the semi-major axis. However, when a star's radius expands when it turns into a [[red giant]], then the distance between the planet and the star's surface can become close to zero, or even less than zero if the planet has been engulfed by the expanding red giant, whereas the center of mass from which the semi-major axis is measured will still be near the center of the red giant.

[[Orbital period]] is the time taken to complete one orbit. For any given star, the shorter the semi-major axis of a planet, the shorter the orbital period. Also comparing planets around different stars but with the same semi-major axis, the more massive the star, the shorter the orbital period.

Over the [[Stellar evolution|lifetime]] of a star, the semi-major axes of its planets changes. This [[planetary migration]] happens especially during the [[Nebular hypothesis#Formation of planets|formation]] of the planetary system when planets interact with the [[protoplanetary disk]] and each other until a relatively stable position is reached, and later in the [[red giant|red-giant]] and [[asymptotic giant branch|asymptotic-giant-branch phases]] when the star expands and engulfs the nearest planets that can cause them to move inwards, and when the red giant loses mass as the outer layers dissipate causing planets to move outwards as a result of the red giant's reduced [[gravity|gravitational field]].

The [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Radial velocity|radial-velocity]] and [[Transit method|transit]] methods are most sensitive to planets with small orbits. The earliest discoveries such as [[51 Peg b]] were [[gas giant]]s with orbits of a few days.<ref name="cumming08">{{Cite journal| first=Andrew |last=Cumming|year=2008|title=The Keck Planet Search: Detectability and the Minimum Mass and Orbital Period Distribution of Extrasolar Planets|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific|volume=120| issue=867|pages=531–554| arxiv=0803.3357|doi=10.1086/588487| bibcode=2008PASP..120..531C| first2=R.

Most planets that have been discovered are within a couple of AU from their host star because the most used methods (radial-velocity and transit) require observation of several orbits to confirm that the planet exists and there has only been enough time since these methods were first used to cover small separations. Some planets with larger orbits have been discovered by direct imaging but there is a middle range of distances, roughly equivalent to the Solar System's gas giant region, which is largely unexplored. Direct imaging equipment for exploring that region is being installed on the world's largest telescopes and should begin operation in 2014. e.g. [[Gemini Planet Imager]] and [[VLT-SPHERE]]. The [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#microlensing|microlensing]] method has detected a few planets in the 1–10&nbsp;AU range.<ref>[http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/?f=%22microlensing%22+IN+detection Catalog Listing].

It appears plausible that in most exoplanetary systems, there are one or two giant planets with orbits comparable in size to those of Jupiter and Saturn in the Solar System. Giant planets with substantially larger orbits are now known to be rare, at least around Sun-like stars.<ref>

===Eccentricity===
The [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of an orbit is a measure of how elliptical (elongated) it is. All the planets of the Solar System except for [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] have near-circular orbits (e<0.1).<ref name="marcyprogth05">

}}</ref> Most exoplanets with orbital periods of 20 days or less have near-circular orbits, i.e. very low eccentricity. That is believed to be due to [[tidal circularization]]: reduction of eccentricity over time due to gravitational interaction between two bodies. The mostly sub-Neptune-sized planets found by the Kepler spacecraft with short orbital periods have very circular orbits.<ref name="kepler1700"/> By contrast, the giant planets with longer orbital periods discovered by radial-velocity methods have quite eccentric orbits. (As of July 2010, 55% of such exoplanets have eccentricities greater than 0.2, whereas 17% have eccentricities greater than 0.5.<ref name="Encyclopaedia"/>) Moderate to high eccentricities (e>0.2) of giant planets are ''not'' an observational selection effect, because a planet can be detected about equally well regardless of the eccentricity of its orbit. The prevalence of elliptical orbits for giant planets is a major puzzle, because current theories of [[Nebular hypothesis#Formation of planets|planetary formation]] strongly suggest planets should form with circular (that is, non-eccentric) orbits.<ref name="boss_book p26">{{Cite book

However, for weak [[Doppler spectroscopy|Doppler]] signals near the limits of the current detection ability the eccentricity becomes poorly constrained and biased towards higher values. It is suggested that some of the high eccentricities reported for low-mass exoplanets may be overestimates, because simulations show that many observations are also consistent with two planets on circular orbits. Reported observations of single planets in moderately eccentric orbits have about a 15% chance of being a pair of planets.<ref>

Radial velocity surveys found exoplanet orbits beyond 0.1 AU to be eccentric, particularly for large planets. [[Kepler spacecraft]] transit data is consistent with the RV surveys and also revealed that smaller planets tend to have less eccentric orbits.<ref>Kane, Stephen R. ''et al.''

===Inclination vs. spin–orbit angle===
[[Orbital inclination]] is the angle between a planet's [[orbital plane]] and another plane of reference. For exoplanets the inclination is usually stated with respect to an observer on Earth: the angle used is that between the [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] to the planet's orbital plane and the line of sight from Earth to the star. Therefore, most planets observed by the [[transit method]] are close to 90 degrees.<ref>Mason, John (2008) ''Exoplanets: Detection, Formation, Properties, Habitability''.  Springer. ISBN 3540740074. p. 2</ref> Because the word 'inclination' is used in exoplanet studies for this line-of-sight inclination then the angle between the planet's orbit and the star's rotation must use a different word and is termed the spin–orbit angle or spin–orbit alignment. In most cases the orientation of the star's rotational axis is unknown. The Kepler spacecraft has found a few hundred multi-planet systems and in most of these systems the planets all orbit in nearly the same plane, much like the Solar System.<ref name="kepler1700"/> However, a combination of astrometric and radial-velocity measurements has shown that some planetary systems contain planets whose orbital planes are significantly tilted relative to each other.<ref>[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=exoplanet-tilt Out of Flatland: Orbits Are Askew in a Nearby Planetary System]. ''Scientific American''. 24 May 2010.</ref> More than half of [[hot Jupiter]]s have orbital planes substantially misaligned with their parent star's rotation. A substantial fraction of hot-Jupiters even have [[retrograde orbit]]s, meaning that they orbit in the opposite direction from the star's rotation.<ref name="2010question">{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.gla.ac.uk/nam2010/pr10.php |title=Turning planetary theory upside down |publisher=Astro.gla.ac.uk |date=13 April 2010}}</ref> Rather than a planet's orbit having been disturbed, it may be that the star itself flipped early in their system's formation due to interactions between the star's magnetic field and the planet-forming disc.<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727765.200-tilting-stars-may-explain-backwards-planets.html "Tilting stars may explain backwards planets"], ''New Scientist'', 1 September 2010, Vol. 2776.</ref>

===Periastron precession===
[[Apsidal precession|Periastron precession]] is the rotation of a planet's orbit within the orbital plane, i.e. the axes of the ellipse change direction. Various factors cause the precession. In the Solar System perturbations from other planets are the main cause, but for close-in exoplanets the largest factor can be tidal forces between the star and planet. For close-in exoplanets, the [[general relativity|general relativistic]] contribution to the precession is also significant and can be orders of magnitude larger than the [[Perihelion precession of Mercury|same effect for Mercury]]. Some exoplanets have significantly [[#Eccentricity|eccentric orbits]], which makes it easier to detect the precession. The effect of general relativity can be detectable in timescales of roughly 10 years or less.<ref>[http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.0630 Observability of the General Relativistic Precession of Periastra in Exoplanets], Andres Jordan, Gaspar A. Bakos, 3 June 2008</ref>

===Nodal precession===
[[Nodal precession]] is rotation of a planet's orbital plane. This differs from periastron precession, which is rotation of a planet's orbit within that plane. Nodal precession is more easily seen as distinct from periastron precession when the orbital plane is [[inclination|inclined]] to the star's rotation, the extreme case being a polar orbit.

[[WASP-33]] is a fast-rotating star that hosts a [[hot Jupiter]] in an almost polar orbit. The [[Quadrupole#Gravitational quadrupole|quadrupole mass moment]] and the proper [[angular momentum]] of the star are 1900 and 400 times, respectively, larger than those of the Sun. This causes significant [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|classical]] and [[general relativity|relativistic]] deviations from [[Kepler's laws]]. In particular, the fast rotation causes large nodal precession because of the star's [[oblateness]] and the [[Lense–Thirring precession|Lense–Thirring effect]].<ref>[http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.2707 Classical and relativistic node precessional effects in WASP-33b and perspectives for detecting them], Lorenzo Iorio, 25 August 2010</ref>

===Origin of spin and tilt of terrestrial planets===
[[Impact event|Giant impacts]] have a large effect on the spin of [[terrestrial planets]]. The last few giant impacts during [[Nebular hypothesis#Formation of planets|planetary formation]] tend to be the main determiner of a terrestrial planet's rotation rate. On average the spin [[angular velocity]] will be about 70% of the velocity that would cause the planet to break up and fly apart; the natural outcome of [[planetary embryo]] impacts at speeds slightly larger than [[escape velocity]]. In later stages terrestrial planet spin is also affected by impacts with [[planetesimal]]s. During the giant impact stage, the thickness of a [[protoplanetary disk]] is far larger than the size of planetary embryos so collisions are equally likely to come from any direction in three-dimensions. This results in the [[axial tilt]] of accreted planets ranging from 0 to 180 degrees with any direction as likely as any other with both [[retrograde and prograde motion|prograde and retrograde]] spins equally probable. Therefore, prograde spin with a small axial tilt, common for the Solar System's terrestrial planets except Venus, is not common in general for terrestrial planets built by giant impacts. The initial axial tilt of a planet determined by giant impacts can be substantially changed by stellar tides if the planet is close to its star and by satellite tides if the planet has a large satellite.<ref>Raymond, Sean N. ''et al.'' (5 December 2013) [http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1689 Terrestrial Planet Formation at Home and Abroad]. arxiv.org</ref>

===Tidal effects===
For most planets the rotation period and [[axial tilt]] (also called obliquity) are not known, but a large number of planets have been detected with very short orbits (where tidal effects are greater) and will probably have reached an [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] rotation that can be predicted.

Tidal effects are the result of forces acting on a body differing from one part of the body to another.<ref name="TidalEvoExop"/> For example, the gravitational effect of a star varies with distance from one side of a planet to another. Also heat from a star creates a temperature gradient between the day and nightsides which is another source of tides. For example, on Earth, air pressure variations on the ground are affected more by temperature differences than gravitational ones.

Tides modify the rotation and orbit of planets until an equilibrium is reached. Whenever the rotation rate is slowed, there is an increase of the orbit semi-major axis due to the conservation of angular momentum. Most of the large moons in the Solar System, including the [[Moon]], are [[tidally locked]] to their host planet; the same side of the moon is always facing the planet. This means the moons' rotation periods are synchronous with their orbital period. However, when an orbit is [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentric]], as is the case with many exoplanets' orbits of their host stars, there are equilibrium states such as [[Mercury (planet)#Spin–orbit resonance|spin–orbit resonances]] that are far more likely than synchronous rotation. A spin–orbit resonance is when the rotation period and the orbital period are in an [[integer]] [[ratio]] – this is called a commensurability. Non-resonant equilibriums such as the [[Retrograde and prograde motion#Planets|retrograde rotation of Venus]] can also occur when both gravitational and thermal atmospheric tides are both significant.

A synchronous tidal lock isn't necessarily particularly slow – there are planets with orbits that take only a few hours.

Gravitational tides tend to reduce the axial tilt to zero but over a longer time-scale than the rotation rate reaches equilibrium. However, the presence of multiple planets in a system can cause axial tilt to be captured in a resonance called a [[Cassini state]]. There are small oscillations around this state and in the case of [[Mars]] these axial tilt variations are [[chaotic]].

[[Hot Jupiter]]s' close proximity to their host star means that their spin–orbit evolution is mostly due to the star's gravity and not the other effects. Hot Jupiters rotation rate is not thought to be captured into spin–orbit resonance due to way fluid-body reacts to tides, and therefore slows down to synchronous rotation if it is on a circular orbit or slows to a non-synchronous rotation if on an eccentric orbit. Hot Jupiters are likely to evolve towards zero axial tilt even if they had been in a Cassini state during planetary migration when they were further from their star. Hot Jupiters' orbits will become more circular over time, however the presence of other planets in the system on eccentric orbits, even ones as small as Earth and as far away as the habitable zone, can continue to maintain the eccentricity of the Hot Jupiter so that the length of time for [[tidal circularization]] can be billions instead of millions of years.

The rotation rate of planet [[HD 80606 b]] is predicted to be about 1.9 days. HD 80606 b avoids spin–orbit resonance because it is a gas giant. The eccentricity of its orbit means that it avoids becoming tidally locked.

===Mass===
When a planet is found by the [[radial-velocity method]], its [[#Inclination vs. spin–orbit angle|orbital inclination]] ''i'' is unknown and can range from 0 to 90 degrees. The method is unable to determine the [[true mass]] (''M'') of the planet, but rather gives a [[minimum mass|lower limit for its mass]], ''M''&nbsp;sin''i''. In a few cases an apparent exoplanet may be a more massive object such as a brown dwarf or red dwarf. However, the probability of a small value of i (say less than 30 degrees, which would give a true mass at least double the observed lower limit) is relatively low (1−(√3)/2 ≈ 13%) and hence most planets will have true masses fairly close to the observed lower limit.<ref name="cumming08"/>

If a planet's orbit is nearly perpendicular to the line of vision (i.e. ''i'' close to 90°), a planet can be detected through the [[transit method]]. The inclination will then be known, and the inclination combined with ''M''&nbsp;sin''i'' from radial-velocity observations will give the planet's true mass.

Also, [[astrometry|astrometric]] observations and dynamical considerations in multiple-planet systems can sometimes provide an upper limit to the planet's true mass.

The mass of a transiting exoplanet can also be determined from the transmission spectrum of its atmosphere, as it can be used to constrain independently the atmospheric composition, temperature, pressure, and [[scale height]].<ref name="JulienSeager2013">{{cite journal|last=de Wit|first=Julien|author2=Seager, S.|title=Constraining Exoplanet Mass from Transmission Spectroscopy|journal=Science|date=19 December 2013|volume=342|issue=6165|pages=1473–1477|arxiv=1401.6181|doi=10.1126/science.1245450|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6165/1473|pmid=24357312|bibcode = 2013Sci...342.1473D }}</ref>

===Radius, density and bulk composition===
Prior to recent results from the Kepler spacecraft most confirmed planets were gas giants comparable in size to Jupiter or larger because they are most easily detected. However, the planets detected by Kepler are mostly between the size of Neptune and the size of Earth.<ref name="kepler1700"/>

If a planet is detectable by both the radial-velocity and the transit methods, then both its true mass and its radius can be found. The planet's [[density]] can then be calculated. Planets with low density are inferred to be composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, whereas planets of intermediate density are inferred to have water as a major constituent. A planet of high density is inferred to be rocky, like Earth and the other terrestrial planets of the Solar System.

Gaseous planets that are hot because they are close to their star or because they are still hot from their formation are expanded by the heat. For colder gas planets there is a maximum radius which is slightly larger than Jupiter which occurs when the mass reaches a few Jupiter-masses. Adding mass beyond this point causes the radius to shrink.<ref name="whatbasribrown"/><ref>Seager, S. and Lissauer, J. J.

====Super-Earths, mini-Neptunes, and gas dwarfs====
{{Main|Super-Earth|Mini-Neptune|Helium planet|Gas dwarf}}
If a planet has a radius and/or mass between that of Earth and Neptune then there is a question about whether the planet is rocky like Earth, a mixture of volatiles and gas like Neptune, a small planet with a hydrogen/helium envelope (mini-Jupiter), or of some other composition.

Some of the Kepler transiting planets with radii in the range 1–4 Earth radii have had their masses measured by radial-velocity or transit-timing methods. The calculated densities show that up to 1.5 Earth radii, these planets are rocky and that density increases with increasing radius due to gravitational compression. However, between 1.5 and 4 Earth radii the density decreases with increasing radius. This indicates that above 1.5 Earth radii planets tend to have increasing amounts of volatiles and gas. Despite this general trend there is a wide range of masses at a given radius, which could be because gas planets can have rocky cores of different masses or compositions<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/783/1/L6| title = The Mass-Radius Relation for 65 Exoplanets Smaller Than 4 Earth Radii| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 783| pages = L6| year = 2014| last1 = Weiss | first1 = L.

Excluding close-in planets that have lost their gas envelope due to stellar irradiation, studies of the [[metallicity]] of stars suggest a dividing line of 1.7 Earth radii between rocky planets and gas dwarfs; then another dividing line at 3.9 Earth radii between gas dwarfs and gas giants. These dividing lines are statistical trends and do not necessarily apply to specific planets because there are many other factors besides metallicity that affect planet formation, including distance from star – there may be larger rocky planets formed at larger distances.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature13254| title = Three regimes of extrasolar planet radius inferred from host star metallicities| journal = Nature| volume = 509| issue = 7502| pages = 593–595| year = 2014| last1 = Buchhave | first1 = L.

An independent reanalysis of the data suggests that there are no such dividing lines and that there is a continuum of planet formation between 1 and 4 Earth radii and no reason to expect that the amount of solid material in a protoplanetary disk determines whether super-Earths or mini-Neptunes are formed.<ref>[http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05953 A Continuum of Planet Formation Between 1 and 4 Earth Radii], Kevin C.

In 2014, new measurements of [[Kepler-10c]] found that it is a Neptune-mass planet (17 Earth masses) with a density higher than Earth's, indicating that Kepler-10c is made mostly of rock with possibly up to 20% high-pressure water ice but without a hydrogen-dominated envelope.

Gas planets can also have large solid cores: the Saturn-mass planet [[HD 149026 b]] has only two-thirds of Saturn's radius, so it may have a rock–ice core of 60 Earth masses or more.<ref name="whatbasribrown"/> [[Corot-20b]] has 4.24 times Jupiter's mass but a radius of only 0.84 that of Jupiter—it may have a metal core of 800 Earth masses if the heavy elements are concentrated in the core or a core of 300 Earth masses if the heavy elements are more distributed throughout the planet.<ref>[http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.01630 Tidal Downsizing Model.

[[Transit-timing variation]] measurements indicate that Kepler-52b, Kepler-52c and Kepler-57b have maximum-masses between 30 and 100 times the mass of Earth, although the actual masses could be much lower. With radii about 2 Earth radii in size, they might have densities larger than that of an [[iron planet]] of the same size. They orbit very close to their stars, so they could be the remnant cores ([[chthonian planet]]s) of evaporated [[gas giant]]s or [[brown dwarf]]s. If cores are massive enough they could remain compressed for billions of years despite losing the atmospheric mass.<ref>Mocquet, A.; Grasset, O. and Sotin, C.

Solid planets up to thousands of Earth masses may be able to form around massive stars ([[B-type main-sequence star|B-type]] and [[O-type main-sequence star|O-type]] stars; 5–120 solar masses), where the [[protoplanetary disk]] would contain enough heavy elements. Also, these stars have high [[UV radiation]] and [[stellar wind|winds]] that could [[Photoevaporation|photoevaporate]] the gas in the disk, leaving just the heavy elements.<ref name="mass/radius sold">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1086/521346| title = Mass‐Radius Relationships for Solid Exoplanets| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 669| issue = 2| pages = 1279–1297| year = 2007| last1 = Seager | first1 = S.| last2 = Kuchner | first2 = M.| last3 = Hier‐Majumder | first3 = C.

For comparison, Neptune's mass equals 17 Earth masses, Jupiter has 318 Earth masses, and the 13 Jupiter-mass limit used in the [[IAU]]'s working definition of an exoplanet equals approximately 4000 Earth masses.<ref name="mass/radius sold"/>

Another way of forming massive solid planets is when a [[white dwarf]] in a close binary system loses material to a companion [[neutron star]]. The white dwarf can be reduced to planetary-mass, leaving just its crystallised carbon–oxygen core. A likely example of this is [[PSR J1719-1438 b]].

Cold planets have a maximum radius because adding more mass at that point causes the planet to compress under the weight instead of increasing the radius. The maximum radius for solid planets is smaller than the maximum radius for gas planets.<ref name="mass/radius sold"/>

===Shape===
When the size of a planet is described using its radius this is approximating the shape by a [[sphere]]. However, the rotation of a planet causes it to be flattened at the poles so that the equatorial radius is larger than the polar radius, making it closer to an [[oblate spheroid]]. The oblateness of [[transit method|transiting]] exoplanets will affect the transit light curves. At the limits of current technology it has been possible to show that [[HD 189733b]] is less oblate than [[Saturn]].<ref name="CarterWinn">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/709/2/1219| title = Empirical Constraints on the Oblateness of an Exoplanet| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 709| issue = 2| pages = 1219–1229| year = 2010| last1 = Carter | first1 = J.

===Abiotic oxygen===
{{hatnote|There are non-biological processes that produce oxygen, so the detection of oxygen is not necessarily an indication of life.}}

The processes of life result in a mixture of chemicals that are not in [[chemical equilibrium]] but there are also abiotic disequilibrium processes that need to be considered. The most robust atmospheric [[biosignature]] is often considered to be molecular [[oxygen]] O<sub>2</sub> and its [[photochemical]] byproduct [[ozone]] O<sub>3</sub>. The [[photolysis]] of water H<sub>2</sub>O by [[UV rays]] followed by [[hydrodynamic escape]] of hydrogen can lead to a build-up of oxygen in planets close to their star undergoing [[runaway greenhouse effect]]. For planets in the [[habitable zone]] it was believed that water photolysis would be strongly limited by [[Cold trap (astronomy)|cold-trapping]] of water vapour in the lower atmosphere. However, the extent of H<sub>2</sub>O cold-trapping depends strongly on the amount of non-[[Condensation|condensible]] gases in the atmosphere such as [[nitrogen]] N<sub>2</sub> and [[argon]]. In the absence of such gases the likelihood of build-up of oxygen also depends in complex ways on the planet's accretion history, internal chemistry, atmospheric dynamics and orbital state. Therefore, oxygen on its own cannot be considered a robust biosignature.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/785/2/L20| title = Abiotic Oxygen-Dominated Atmospheres on Terrestrial Habitable Zone Planets| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 785| issue = 2| pages = L20| year = 2014| last1 = Wordsworth | first1 = R. | last2 = Pierrehumbert | first2 = R. |arxiv = 1403.2713 |bibcode = 2014ApJ...785L..20W }}</ref> The ratio of nitrogen and argon to oxygen could be detected by studying [[infrared|thermal]] [[Phase curve (astronomy)|phase curves]]<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361/201116654| title = Thermal phase curves of nontransiting terrestrial exoplanets| journal = Astronomy & Astrophysics| volume = 532| pages = A1| year = 2011| last1 = Selsis | first1 = F.| last2 = Wordsworth | first2 = R.

==Surface==

===Surface composition===
Surface features can be distinguished from atmospheric features by comparing emission and reflection spectroscopy with [[transmission spectroscopy]]. Mid-infrared spectroscopy of exoplanets may detect rocky surfaces, and near-infrared may identify magma oceans or high-temperature lavas, hydrated silicate surfaces and water ice, giving an unambiguous method to distinguish between rocky and gaseous exoplanets.<ref>Hu, Renyu (6 April 2012) [http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1544 Theoretical Spectra of Terrestrial Exoplanet Surfaces]. arxiv.org</ref>

One can estimate the temperature of an exoplanet based on the intensity of the light it receives from its parent star. For example, the planet [[OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb]] is estimated to have a surface temperature of roughly −220&nbsp;°C (50 K). However, such estimates may be substantially in error because they depend on the planet's usually unknown [[albedo]], and because factors such as the greenhouse effect may introduce unknown complications. A few planets have had their temperature measured by observing the variation in infrared radiation as the planet moves around in its orbit and is eclipsed by its parent star. For example, the planet [[HD 189733b]] has been found to have an average temperature of 1205±9 K (932±9&nbsp;°C) on its dayside and 973±33 K (700±33&nbsp;°C) on its nightside.<ref name="knutson_charbonneau07">

The apparent brightness ([[apparent magnitude]]) of a planet depends on how far away the observer is, how reflective the planet is ([[albedo]]), and how much light the planet receives from its star, which depends on how far the planet is from the star and how bright the star is. So, a planet with a low albedo that is close to its star can appear brighter than a planet with high albedo that is far from the star.<ref>[http://phl.upr.edu/library/notes/theapparentbrightnessandsizeofexoplanetsandtheirstars The Apparent Brightness and Size of Exoplanets and their Stars], Abel Mendez, updated 30 June 2012, 12:10 PM</ref>

The darkest known planet in terms of [[geometric albedo]] is [[TrES-2b]], a [[hot Jupiter]] that reflects less than 1% of the light from its star, making it less reflective than coal or black acrylic paint.

For [[gas giant]]s, geometric albedo generally decreases with increasing metallicity or atmospheric temperature unless there are clouds to modify this effect. Increased cloud-column depth increases the albedo at optical wavelengths, but decreases it at some infrared wavelengths. Optical albedo increases with age, because older planets have higher cloud-column depths. Optical albedo decreases with increasing mass, because higher-mass giant planets have higher surface gravities, which produces lower cloud-column depths. Also, elliptical orbits can cause major fluctuations in atmospheric composition, which can have a significant effect.<ref name="wfirstreturn">Burrows, Adam (18 December 2014) [http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6097 Scientific Return of Coronagraphic Exoplanet Imaging and Spectroscopy Using WFIRST].  arxiv.org</ref>

There is more thermal emission than reflection at some near-infrared wavelengths for massive and/or young gas giants. So, although optical brightness is fully [[Planetary phase|phase]]-dependent, this is not always the case in the near infrared.<ref name="wfirstreturn"/>

Temperatures of gas giants reduce over time and with distance from their star. Lowering the temperature increases optical albedo even without clouds. At a sufficiently low temperature, water clouds form, which further increase optical albedo.

Interaction between a close-in planet's magnetic field and a star can produce spots on the star in a similar way to how the [[Galilean moons]] produce aurorae on Jupiter.<ref>[http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/3308581.html Footprint of a Magnetic Exoplanet], www.skyandtelescope.com, 9 January 2004, Robert Naeye

Earth's magnetic field results from its flowing liquid metallic core, but in super-Earths the mass can produce high pressures with large viscosities and high melting temperatures which could prevent the interiors from separating into different layers and so result in undifferentiated coreless mantles. Magnesium oxide, which is rocky on Earth, can be a liquid metal at the pressures and temperatures found in super-Earths and could generate a magnetic field in the mantles of super-Earths.<ref>[http://www.space.com/18604-super-earth-planets-liquid-metal.html Super-Earths Get Magnetic 'Shield' from Liquid Metal], Charles Q.

[[Hot Jupiter]]s have been observed to have a larger radius than expected. This could be caused by the interaction between the [[stellar wind]] and the planet's magnetosphere creating an [[Joule heating|electric current through the planet that heats]] it up causing it to expand. The more magnetically active a star is the greater the stellar wind and the larger the electric current leading to more heating and expansion of the planet. This theory matches the observation that stellar activity is correlated with inflated planetary radii.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/765/2/L25| title = Stellar Magnetic Fields As a Heating Source for Extrasolar Giant Planets| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 765| issue = 2| pages = L25| year = 2013| last1 = Buzasi | first1 = D.|arxiv = 1302.1466 |bibcode = 2013ApJ...765L..25B }}</ref>

===Plate tectonics===

On Earth-sized planets, [[plate tectonics]] is more likely if there are oceans of water{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}; however, in 2007 two independent teams of researchers came to opposing conclusions about the likelihood of plate tectonics on larger [[super-earth]]s<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2009.07.015|title=Convection scaling and subduction on Earth and super-Earths|date=2009|last1=Valencia|first1=Diana|last2=O'Connell|first2=Richard J.|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=286|issue=3–4|pages=492–502|bibcode = 2009E&PSL.286..492V }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2011.07.029|title=Plate tectonics on super-Earths: Equally or more likely than on Earth|date=2011|last1=Van Heck|first1=H.J.|last2=Tackley|first2=P.J.|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=310|issue=3–4|pages=252–261|bibcode = 2011E&PSL.310..252V }}</ref> with one team saying that plate tectonics would be episodic or stagnant<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1029/2007GL030598 |title=Geological consequences of super-sized Earths |date=2007 |last1=O'Neill |first1=C. |last2=Lenardic |first2=A. |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=34 |issue=19|bibcode = 2007GeoRL..3419204O }}</ref> and the other team saying that plate tectonics is very likely on super-earths even if the planet is dry.<ref>{{Cite journal |first1=Diana |last1=Valencia |first2=Richard J. |last2=O'Connell |first3=Dimitar D |last3=Sasselov |date=November 2007 |title=Inevitability of Plate Tectonics on Super-Earths |journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters |volume=670 |issue=1 |pages=L45–L48 |doi=10.1086/524012 |arxiv=0710.0699 |ref=CITEREFValenciaO'ConnellSasselov2007 |bibcode=2007ApJ...670L..45V}}</ref>

The rings of the Solar System's gas giants are aligned with their planet's equator. However, for exoplanets that orbit close to their star, tidal forces from the star would lead to the outermost rings of a planet being aligned with the planet's orbital plane around the star. A planet's innermost rings would still be aligned with the planet's equator so that if the planet has a [[axial tilt|tilted rotational axis]], then the different alignments between the inner and outer rings would create a warped ring system.<ref>Schlichting, Hilke E. and Chang, Philip (19 Apr 2011) [http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.3863 Warm Saturns: On the Nature of Rings around Extrasolar Planets that Reside Inside the Ice Line]. arxiv.org</ref>

===Comet-like tails===

[[KIC 12557548 b]] is a small rocky planet, very close to its star, that is evaporating and leaving a trailing tail of cloud and dust like a [[comet]].<ref>[http://phys.org/news/2012-08-evaporating-exoplanet.html Evaporating exoplanet stirs up dust]. Phys.org. 28 August 2012</ref> The dust could be ash erupting from volcanos and escaping due to the small planet's low surface-gravity, or it could be from metals that are vaporized by the high temperatures of being so close to the star with the metal vapor then condensing into dust.<ref>Woollacott, Emma (18 May 2012) [http://www.tgdaily.com/space-features/63469-new-found-exoplanet-is-evaporating-away New-found exoplanet is evaporating away].

In June 2015, scientists reported that the atmosphere of [[GJ 436 b]] was evaporating, resulting in a giant cloud around the planet and, due to radiation from the host star, a long trailing tail {{convert|9|e6mi|e6km|disp=flip|abbr=on}} long.<ref name="NYT-20150625">{{cite news |last=Bhanoo |first=Sindya N. |title=A Planet with a Tail Nine Million Miles Long |url=http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/summer-of-science-2015/latest/exoplanet-tail |date=25 June 2015 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=25 June 2015 }}</ref>

==Habitability==
{{Main|Planetary habitability|Astrobiology|Drake equation}}

===Habitable zone===
The [[habitable zone]] around a star is the region where the temperature is just right to allow liquid water to exist on a planet; that is, not too close to the star for the water to evaporate and not too far away from the star for the water to freeze. The heat produced by stars varies depending on the size and age of the star so that the habitable zone can be at different distances. Also, the atmospheric conditions on the planet influence the planet's ability to retain heat so that the location of the habitable zone is also specific to each type of planet: [[desert planet]]s (also known as dry planets), with very little water, will have less water vapor in the atmosphere than Earth and so have a reduced greenhouse effect, meaning that a desert planet could maintain oases of water closer to its star than Earth is to the Sun. The lack of water also means there is less ice to reflect heat into space, so the outer edge of desert-planet habitable zones is further out.<ref>Choi, Charles Q.

Planetary [[#Rotation and axial tilt|rotation rate]] is one of the major factors determining the [[#Atmospheric circulation|circulation of the atmosphere]] and hence the pattern of clouds: slowly rotating planets create thick clouds that [[albedo|reflect]] more and so can be habitable much closer to their star.

===Ice ages and snowball states===
{{See also|Ice age|Snowball Earth}}
The outer edge of the habitable zone is where planets will be completely frozen but even planets well inside the habitable zone can periodically become frozen. If orbital fluctuations or other causes produce cooling then this creates more ice but ice reflects sunlight causing even more cooling creating a feedback loop until the planet is completely or nearly completely frozen. When the surface is frozen this stops [[Weathering#Dissolution and carbonation|carbon dioxide weathering]] resulting in a build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from volcanic emissions. This creates a greenhouse effect which unfreezes the planet again. Planets with a large [[axial tilt]]<ref>Linsenmeier, Manuel ''et al.'' (21 January 2014)

===Tidal heating===
If a planet has an eccentric orbit then [[tidal heating]] can provide another source of energy besides stellar irradiation. This means that eccentric planets in the radiative habitable zone can be too hot for liquid water ([[Tidal Venus]]). Tides also [[tidal circularization|circularize]] orbits over time so there could be planets in the habitable zone with circular orbits that have no water because they used to have eccentric orbits.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1089/ast.2012.0851| title = Tidal Venuses: Triggering a Climate Catastrophe via Tidal Heating| journal = Astrobiology| volume = 13| issue = 3| pages = 225–250| year = 2013| last1 = Barnes | first1 = R. | last2 = Mullins | first2 = K. | last3 = Goldblatt | first3 = C. | last4 = Meadows | first4 = V.

* In November 2013 it was announced that 22±8% of Sun-like<ref group="lower-alpha" name="footnoteA" /> stars have an Earth-sized<ref group="lower-alpha" name="footnoteB" /> planet in the habitable<ref group="lower-alpha" name="footnoteC" /> zone.<ref name="ucb1in5" /><ref name="earthsunhzprev" /> Assuming 200 billion stars in the Milky Way,<ref group="lower-alpha" name="footnoteD" /> that would be 11 billion potentially habitable Earths, rising to 40 billion if [[red dwarf]]s are included.<ref name="LATimes-20131104" />
* [[Kepler-186f]], a 1.2-Earth-radius planet in the habitable zone of a [[red dwarf]], announced in April 2014.
* In February 2013, researchers calculated that up to 6% of small red dwarfs may have planets with Earth-like properties. This suggests that the closest "alien Earth" to the Solar System could be 13 light-years away. The estimated distance increases to 21 light-years when a 95 percent [[confidence interval]] is used.<ref name="howell-2013">{{cite news | url=http://www.space.com/19667-closest-alien-earth-exoplanets.html | title=Closest 'Alien Earth' May Be 13 Light-Years Away | work=Space.com | date=6 February 2013 | agency=TechMediaNetwork | accessdate=7 February 2013 | author=Howell, Elizabeth}}</ref> In March 2013 a revised estimate based on a more accurate consideration of the size of the habitable zone around red dwarfs gave an occurrence rate of 50% for Earth-size planets in the habitable zone of red dwarfs.<ref name="Habitable Exoplanet Re-estimate">{{cite journal|last=Kopparapu |first=Ravi Kumar |title=A revised estimate of the occurrence rate of terrestrial planets in the habitable zones around kepler m-dwarfs |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Letters]] |date=March 2013 |arxiv=1303.2649 |bibcode=2013ApJ...767L...8K|volume=767|pages=L8|doi=10.1088/2041-8205/767/1/L8}}</ref>
* At 1.63 times Earth's radius [[Kepler-452b]] is the first discovered near-Earth-size planet in the [[Circumstellar habitable zone|“habitable zone]]” around a [[G star|G2-type]] [[Sun-like]] star (July 23, 2015).<ref>{{Cite web|title = NASA’s Kepler Mission Discovers Bigger, Older Cousin to Earth|url = http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-kepler-mission-discovers-bigger-older-cousin-to-earth|accessdate = 2015-07-23}}</ref>

==Cultural impact==
On 9 May 2013, a [http://science.edgeboss.net/wmedia/science/sst2013/SP050913.wvx congressional hearing] by two [[United States House of Representatives]] [[United States congressional committee|subcommittees]] discussed "[https://science.house.gov/hearing/subcommittee-space-and-subcommittee-research-joint-hearing-exoplanet-discoveries-have-we Exoplanet Discoveries: Have We Found Other Earths?]", prompted by the discovery of exoplanet [[Kepler-62f]], along with [[Kepler-62e]] and [[Kepler-62c]]. A related special issue of the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', published earlier, described the discovery of the exoplanets.<ref name="SCI-20130503">{{cite journal |title=Special Issue: Exoplanets |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/site/special/exoplanets/ |date=3 May 2013 |journal=Science }}</ref>

After hydrogen and helium, oxygen is the most common [[chemical element|element]] in many planetary systems (in some systems carbon is more common than oxygen), and water H<sub>2</sub>O one of the most common compounds. [[Gas giant]]s are composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, but most planets are between the size of Earth and Neptune, where many planets will have deep water oceans covering the entire surface in addition to a H–He envelope.
